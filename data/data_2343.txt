Figure S1 . Phylogeny of all sequences belonging to the UMRV phylogroup. A global phylogeny of 308 partial L-gene sequences calculated in 10,000,000 iterations in MrBayes with the GTR + G + I evolutionary model and a 10% burn-in rooted with an Aquaparamyxovirus sequence (GenBank number EF646380). All Malagasy bat paramyxoviruses sequences obtained within this study fell within group of Unclassified Morbillivirus-Related viruses. Genbank accession numbers used for each virus genera are indicated in Table S6 .
