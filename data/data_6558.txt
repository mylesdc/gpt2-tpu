for fixed constant weights λ i ≥ 1, (often taken to be 2), i = 1, 2, 3. Under these assumptions single statistics
can be expressed [1] , where S k (y), U k (y) and T k (y) are the number of k-stars, k-2-paths and k-triangles in network y, respectively [1] . These single statistics are called the alternating k-star, alternating two-path and alternating k-triangle statistics, respectively.
