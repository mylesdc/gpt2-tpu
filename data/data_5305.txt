A series of etacrynic acid derivatives was synthesized and screened for their in vitro activity against Plasmodium falciparum, as well as their activity against recombinantly expressed falcipain-2 and -3. The two most active compounds of the series displayed IC 50 values of 9.0 and 18.8 μM against Plasmodia.
Malaria is still a major cause of global human morbidity and mortality, with Plasmodium falciparum being the deadliest among the four Plasmodium species that infect humans. Annually 350-500 million clinical malaria episodes occur, causing more than 1 million deaths each year [1]. The
increasing spread of P. falciparum due to inadequate vector control, increasing drug resistance, and the lack of effective vaccine strengthens the need for the development of novel drugs for the treatment of malaria [2, 3] . New therapeutic strategies are therefore urgently needed. Cysteine proteases of P. falciparum represent attractive antiplasmodial drug targets due to their essential functions for the parasite erythrocytic cycle [4, 5, 6] . Among them are falcipain-2 and falcipain-3, which are located in the acidic food vacuole of the parasite, play a pivotal role in hemoglobin hydrolysis, and may also participate in erythrocyte rupture [5, 7] . Disruption of the hemoglobin degradation pathway is lethal for the parasite. Development of compounds targeting falcipain-2 and falcipain-3 is therefore currently a focus of research. A recent study has further shown that individual cysteine protease inhibitors significantly reduce microgametogenesis in P. falciparum, pointing to a potential role of these inhibitors for transmission blocking strategies [8] . So far several peptidic and peptidomimetic as well as non-peptidic cysteine protease inhibitors have been synthesized and tested against malaria parasites [9] [10] [11] [12] . In the present work a set of non-peptidic cysteine protease inhibitors derived from the loop diuretic etacrynic acid as a lead compound were evaluated for their potency to inhibit recombinantly expressed falcipain-2 and falcipain-3 [13] [14] [15] . Furthermore, activities against chloroquine-sensitive P. falciparum strain 3D7 and the chloroquine-resistant strain W2 were investigated. Several of these compounds have initially been tested against papain, the prototype cysteine protease of the CAC1 family, and against the SARS coronavirus main protease M pro , as described elsewhere [16, 17] .
In these previous studies compounds possessing an activated double bond revealed covalent, but reversible binding to the cysteine residue of the respective protease. In addition to the structural modifications implemented in previous work [16, 17] , namely within the compounds 1, 2, 8-21, we now included fluoro-substituted compounds 3-7, several analogues without an activated double bond 25-32, as well as derivatives with polar side chains 22-23, and finally, a biotin-labeled inhibitor 24. In summary, the structure of etacrynic acid was modified as follows (Scheme 1): A: substitution pattern of the aromatic ring, B: esters and amides, C: ortho-position of the double bond containing side chain (cpd. 2), D: removal of the double bond.
The inhibitors were synthesized according to previously described pathways [16, 17] which are summarized in Scheme 2. Halogen substituted anisoles were subjected to Friedel-Crafts acylation yielding the corresponding phenolic ketones. Further alkylation of the phenolic hydroxyl functions yielded amides 28, 30 -32, and esters 1, 9 and 29. Introduction of the double bond was performed either by Mannich reaction with TMDM ( 3, 6, 7) or by aldol condensation with formaldehyde ( 4, 8). The latter yielded the free acids 4 and 8 due to concurrent hydrolysis of the ester function. The free acids were coupled to various amides to give the amides 5, 10 -24. Amides 26 and 27 without activated double bond were also synthesized by standard amide coupling methods. 
Br-CH 2 -CO 2 R K 2 CO 3 , KI Recombinant falcipain-2 and falcipain-3 were produced as previously described [14, 18] . Inhibitory activities against recombinant falcipain-2 and falcipain-3 were evaluated in fluorometric microplate assays using the substrates Cbz-Phe-Arg-AMC and Cbz-Leu-Arg-AMC (AMC, 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin) [19] . The cysteine protease inhibitor E-64 was used as a positive control [20] . The solvent DMSO was used as negative control. Compounds 1-6, 8-11 and 13-28 were tested in vitro against the CQ-sensitive 3D7 P. falciparum strain or the CQ-resistant W2 P. falciparum strain. IC 50 values are shown in Table 1 . The in vitro data for the etacrynic acid derivatives are compared to those of the well known drug chloroquine and to E-64. In addition, the cytotoxicity of the inhibitor 23 was studied on human kidney epithelium cell-line 293T, as described previously [21, 22] , resulting in an IC 50 value of >160 μM. Inspection of the data in Table 1 allows the following conclusions to be drawn: in general, the etacrynic acid derivatives are weak or moderate inhibitors of falcipains and P. falciparum. Nevertheless, some structure-activity relationship can be found:
The ethyl ester derivative (9) is more potent than the etacrynic acid (8), both against falcipain-2 and -3. This is in accordance with the results for papain and the SARS-CoV M pro . The dichlorosubstituted compounds (e.g. 9, 20) are better inhibitors than the mono-chloro-(e.g. 1) or fluorosubstituted (6) compounds, with one exception, namely inhibitor 5 (compared to 18). The α,ßunsaturated system appears to be favourable for activity against falcipains when comparing the analogous dichloro-compounds 20 and 27 or compounds 18 and 26. Short voluminous moieties such as the tertbutyl moiety of compounds 5, 28, 29, seem to be advantageous if combined with the fluorosubstituted aromate. In these cases, the activated double bond is apparently not essential for inhibition.
Nearly all etacrynic acid amides show better inhibition properties than the free acid (8) . A longer acidic side-chain significantly enhances the activity (23, compared to 20, 21), making 23 the most active inhibitor of falcipains and P. falciparum within the series. However, insertion of an additional acidic group (e.g. 22) diminishes the inhibiting activity. The cytotoxicity/antiplasmodial ratio for the most active compound 23 is >8.5, indicating selectivity against the parasite. As the data against the target enzymes and the parasites do not correlate in all cases (e.g. 14), the question arises whether there are additional or other targets. In order to allow further affinity binding studies the biotinylated dichloro-substituted etacrynic acid amide 24 was included and synthesized according to the methods
recently described [17, 23] (Scheme 2). Notably, this compound emerged as the most potent inhibitor of falcipains and P. falciparum within the series.
In summary, this paper describes a comprehensive screening of non-peptidic Michael acceptors using etacrynic acid as lead structure. The best inhibition against recombinantly synthesized falcipain-2 and falcipain-3 revealed the compound 24. Moreover, this etacrynic acid amide as well as compound 23 displayed modest antiplasmodial activity in vitro with IC 50 values of 9 and 18.8 μM, respectively, which are in the range of the standard cysteine protease inhibitor E-64. In addition, the high IC 50 value of >160 μM for compound 23 obtained from cytotoxicity assays using the human kidney epithelium cell-line 293T indicates selectivity against the parasite. These results provide basic information for the development of further non-peptidic irreversible cysteine protease inhibitors with etacrynic acid amides as lead compounds. In addition, the good inhibitory properties of 24 allow further affinity binding studies.

Falcipain-2 and falcipain-3 were recombinantly expressed in E. coli and refolded to active enzyme as previously described [13, 24] .
IC 50 values for inhibition of falcipain-2 and falcipain-3 were determined as described previously using the fluorogenic substrates Cbz-Phe-Arg-AMC and Cbz-Leu-Arg-AMC, respectively (AMC, 7amino-4 methylcoumarin) [7, 13, 14] . As a positive control the well-known cysteine protease inhibitor E-64 [7, 25, 26] and as a negative control the solvent (DMSO) was used. Dose-dependent effects of compounds on parasite development (P. falciparum strain W2) were quantified by flow cytometry according to a previously published method [27] . First, a screening with inhibitor concentrations of 100, 10 and 1 mM was performed and the percentage activity of infected red blood cells (RBCs) relative to the negative control was determined. Compounds showing concentration dependent inhibition in these assays were selected for determination of IC 50 values (Table 1) . Chloroquine [20] and E-64 were used as positive controls, and the solvent DMSO was used as a negative control. For selected compounds assays with the P. falciparum strain 3D7 were performed using a fluorometric assay with Hoechst-33258 [28] , or the microculture tetrazolium test measuring parasite lactate dehydrogenase activity [12, 29] . The parasites were cultivated in vitro as described previously [30] . Compounds were screened at concentrations between 1 nM and 100 μM. Synchronized ring stages were plated in 96-well plates at a parasitemia of 1%, in the presence of the compounds (dissolved in DMSO). Incubation of parasites with DMSO alone at a concentration of 0.5% v/v was used as a negative control. IC 50 values were calculated by non-linear regression analyses using the programs GaphPad ® Prism 4 and GraFit ® [31, 32] .
