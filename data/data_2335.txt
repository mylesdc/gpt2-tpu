• Large size and aggregation prone antimicrobial peptides are eligible • His-tag is usually used for purification, and can block toxicity of antimicrobial peptides o Refolding is time-consuming and may not guarantee recovery of activity Fusion expression Solubilityenhancing carriers GST (26.9 kDa)
• Rapid purification of the GST-fused protein from crude lysate • Blocks toxicity to the host cell o GST was highly susceptible to proteolytic degradation in several cases o Reduced yield due to the large size of the GST due to low peptide-to-carrier ratio Thioredoxin (11.8 kDa)
• High yield due to high peptide-to-carrier ratio • Chaperone-like activity can promote correct disulfide bond formation • Blocks toxicity to the host cell and prevents proteolytic degradation of peptides o Affinity tag such as His-tag is usually used for purification SUMO (11.2 kDa)
• High yield due to high peptide-to-carrier ratio • Improves folding by the attachment of the carrier • Peptide release by SUMO protease is both efficient and highly accurate, leaving no additional amino acids • Blocks toxicity to the host cell and prevents proteolytic degradation of peptides o Requires additional affinity tag such as His for purification 
• Released peptides are usually purified by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) • Liberated peptides can also be more efficiently purified using cation-exchange chromatography due to the high PI values of antimicrobial peptides compared to carrier proteins • advantages o disadvantages
