4°C. Viruses were pelleted at 3500 rpm for 20 minutes, suspended in 1 mL 1xPBS, and aliquoted for storage at -80°C. To generate stable cells, A549 cells were transduced with the lentiviral concentrate, and after 48 hours, the media was replaced and supplemented with 1 µg/mL puromycin. Cells were allowed to expand for 72 hours to select for successfully transduced cells.
Immunofluorescence analysis. A549 cells were seeded on coverslips in a 24 well plate transfected with siRNA as described above. 96 h post siRNA transfection cells were washed with PBS containing calcium and magnesium chloride and fixed with paraformaldehyde (4%) for 15 min at RT. Fixed cells were washed three times with PBS, permeabilized with Triton-X-100 (0.5%) for 5 min at RT and washed again three times with PBS. The staining was performed with primary antibodies (mouse anti-MxA, 1:1000 ; rabbit anti-NP, 1:2000, GeneTex) diluted in 5 % Normal Goat Serum (NGS) for 1.5 h at RT. Coverslips were washed four times with PBS and incubated with the secondary antibodies (CyTM3-conjugated goat anti-mouse, 1:500, Jackson ImmunoResearch;
CyTM2-conjugated goat anti-rabbit, 1:500, Jackson ImmunoResearch) diluted in 5 % NGS for 30 min at RT in the dark. Cells were washed once with PBS, stained with DAPI at a concentration of 1:10000, followed by two further wash steps with PBS. Coverslips were finally dipped in Milli-Q water, mounted on glass slides using Immuno-Mount (Thermo Scientific) and incubated overnight at RT. Images were taken with the Axio Observer.Z1 (Zeiss) and analyzed using AxioVision software.
Flow cytometry analysis. Intracellular staining of A549 cells was performed using the FoxP3/Transcription Factor Staining Buffer Set (eBioscience). Cells were collected from a 24-well plate and centrifuged at 900 rpm for 5 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in 500 µl of 1 x Fixation/Permeabilization solution and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were then washed twice with 1 x permeabilization buffer, centrifuged at 1600 rpm for 10 min and incubated with the primary antibodies (mouse anti-MxA, 1:100 (79); rabbit anti-NP, 1:100, GeneTex) in 50 µl of 1 x permeabilization buffer for 30 min at 4 °C in the dark. After washing the cells twice, they were incubated with the secondary antibodies (Brilliant Violet 421TM-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit, IgG, 1:50, BioLegend; PE conjugated rat anti-mouse, IgG1, κ, 1:50, BD Biosciences) for 30 min at 4 °C in the dark.
Washed cells were then resuspended in 100 µl of 2% PFA and analyzed using the FACSCantoTM (BD Bioscience). The results were analyzed using FlowJo software.
Cell viability. Cellular cytotoxicity was assessed using the 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay (Roche) following manufacturer's instructions. Absorbance was measured at 565 nm using the Tecan plate reader.
Results from the primary siRNA screen were analyzed based on the Z-score calculation. Results from the secondary siRNA screen were analyzed using the redundant siRNA activity method (RSA) as previously described (27 In case of the wild type HA, a multibasic cleavage site composed of a stretch of lysine (K) and/or arginine (R) residues is present at the cleavage site. By deletion of the basic amino acids, a monobasic HA cleavage site was generated. TM = transmembrane domain. Figure S4 depletion led to a stronger increase of viral replication than MX1 depletion (> 90%; dashed line) for at least 2 out of 4 siRNAs were considered validated (3 technical replicates). Student's t-test was performed to determine the P value. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001. AP-MS = Affinity Purification-Mass Spectrometry.
