A series of phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids 1-24 were prepared and first evaluated for their antiviral activity against tobacco mosaic virus (TMV). The bioassay results showed that most of these compounds exhibited good to excellent in vivo anti-TMV activity, of which compounds 1, 2, 15 and 16 displayed significantly higher activity than (R)-antofine and commercial Ningnanmycin at the same test condition. The substituents on the phenanthrene moiety play an important role for maintaining high in vivo antiviral activity.
Plant viruses cause numerous diseases in a wide range of crop plant species and lead to an estimated $600 billion in annual losses worldwide [1] . Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), the type member of Tobamovirus genus, is a prevalent plant pathogen all over the world and has the widest host range of over 885 plant species in 65 families. Most TMVs have infected a number of economically important crops and have induced general mosaic symptoms to cause significant economic losses worldwide [2] . It is found that in certain fields 90-100% of the plants show mosic or leaf necrosis by harvesting time. Therefore, this plant virus has the name ''plant cancer'' and is difficult to control.
To control viral plant diseases, many approaches have been used, including chemicals, breeding, cross-protection and transgenic plants. However, there are no control measures that can totally inhibit plant viruses after they have infected plants. Ningnanmycin (Figure 1) , perhaps the most successful registered antiplant viral agent, displayed 56.0% in vivo curative effect at 500 mg/mL. Ribavirin (Figure 1 ) is another widely used plantviral inhibitor, its inhibitory effects are also less than 50% at 500 mg/mL. Because of the unsatisfactory cure rate (30-60%) of common antiviral agents (Ningnanmycin, Ribavirin, Virus A, et al.) and economic loss of tobacco, many efforts have been done to develop novel, potent and structure concise antiviral agents. Some chemicals, such as triazolyl compounds [3] , pyrazole derivatives [4, 5] , cyanoacrylate derivatives [5, 6] , a-aminophosphonate derivatives [5, 7] , N-(pyrimidin-5-yl)-N9-phenylureas [8] , and some natural products [9] [10] [11] , have been found to possess antiviral activity. However, there are only a few reports on economically viable antiviral chemicals available for application in agriculture [12] , so there still lies a great deal of scope for further research in this field.
Natural product-based agrochemicals offer advantages in that they can sometimes be specific to a target species and often have unique modes of action with little mammalian toxicity. Another benefit is their ability to decompose rapidly, thereby reducing their risk to the environment [13, 14] . An additional advantage is the natural products can be a candidate that possesses the desirable biological activities.
Phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids are a small group of alkaloids existing in the Lauraceae, Vitaceae and Urticaceae family of plants. Only five of these alkaloids ((R)-cryptopleurine (2), (R)-boehmeriasin A (5), boehmeriasin B (18) , cryptopleuridine and (14aR,15R)-15-hydroxycryptopleurine (19) , Figure 1 ) have been isolated by now [15] [16] [17] [18] . It has been reported that these alkaloids possess unique and interesting biological properties including vesicant [15] , antimicrobial [19] , antiviral [20, 21] and anti-tumor [22] [23] [24] activities. To date, most of the studies have been focused on antitumor activity in medicinal formulation. However, there have been no reports about the anti-TMV activity of phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids in pesticide formulation.
In our previous work, the phenanthroindolizidine alkaloid (2)antofine ( Figure 1 ) was isolated from the aerial parts of Cynanchum komarovii and was first found to have good antiviral activity against TMV in vitro [25] . Further antiviral mechanism studies revealed that antofine has favorable interaction with origin of TMV RNA (oriRNA), likely exerting its virus inhibition by binding to oriRNA and interfering with virus assembly initiation [26] . Although phenanthroquinolizidine and phenanthroindolizidine are structure analogs, their biological properties are different [22] . Did the phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids possess anti-TMV activity?
Based on the above findings, a series of phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids 1-24 were prepared and systematically evaluated for their antiviral activity against TMV.
The alkaloids 1-9 [27] , 18 [28] , 19-24 [27] and acids 25a-f [24] were prepared according to the corresponding reported procedures. Phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids 10-17 were synthesized by using a practical synthetic approach involving coupling of the phenanthrene ring with 2-bromopyridine through a nucleophilic substitution reaction and subsequent reduction of the resulting pyridyl ketone as key steps.
As shown in Figure 2 , 2-bromopyridine was treated with n-BuLi at -78uC to afford 2-lithiopyridine, which reacted smoothly with 25a-f to give pyridyl ketones 26a-f, respectively. By using PtO 2 as the catalyst, the hydrogenation of 26a-e proceeded smoothly in the solution of acetic acid and trifluoroacetic acid (v/v 5:1) at 50 atm to give 27a-e, respectively. It should be noted that pyridyl ketone 26f could not been reduced under above reduction condition. The reduction of 27a-e in Et 3 SiH/TFA at reflux afforded 28a-e, which were then converted into phenanthroquinuolizidine alkaloids 10-14, respectively, by using the Pictet-Spengler cyclomethylenation.
The hydrogenation of 26f was carried out at several different conditions. The best result is that treatment of compound 26f with PtO 2 in the solution of acetic acid and trifluoroacetic acid (v/v 4:1) at 50 atm gave the carbonyl group reduced intermediate 29 in 53% yield. Reduction of 29 using the similar procedure for the preparation of 27a-e gave the key intermediate 30 in 92% yield, which was converted into phenanthroquinuolizidine alkaloid 15 by using the Pictet-Spengler cyclomethylenation ( Figure 3) .
In order to further evaluate the effect of 6-hydroxy group on antiviral activity, which is proposed to interact with TMV RNA [26] , phenanthroquinuolizidine alkaloids 16 and 17 were designed and synthesized. Phenanthrene-9-carboxylic acid 34 was synthesized by employing 2-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)acetic acid and 4hydroxybenzaldehyde as the starting materials ( Figure 4) . Ester 33 was obtained by the conventional four steps previously reported in the literature [29] . Then hydrolysis of ester 33 gave acid 34, which was treated with 2-lithiopyridine to afford the desired ketone 35. The catalytic hydrogenation of 35 to give 38 was carried out under two different procedures. Treatment of compound 35 with Pd/C as the catalyst in reluxing methanol at 1 atm gave the alcohol 36 in 83% yield. Reduction of 36 using the Et 3 SiH/TFA system afforded the desired product 37, which was further reduced using PtO 2 as the catalyst in acetic acid and trifluoroacetic acid (v/v 5:1) at 10 atm gave 38 in 82% yield. For another method, treatment of ketone 35 with Pd/C as the catalyst Phenanthroquinolizidines as Novel Anti-TMV Agents PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org in reluxing acetic acid at 1 atm gave the key intermediate 38 in 59% yield. Then amino and phenol protection and Pictet-Spengler cyclomethylenation proceeded sequentially to give 40, which deprotection afforded phenanthroquinuolizidine alkaloid 16 in 69% yield ( Figure 4) . Treatment of pyridine 37 with cyclopropylmethyl bromide obtained 41, which was reduced using PtO 2 as the catalyst in ethanol and conc. HCl (v/v 20:1) at 50 atm to afford the key intermediate 42. The Pictet-Spengler cyclomethylenation of 42 gave phenanthroquinuolizidine alkaloid 17 in 80% yield ( Figure 5 ).
The phenanthroquinuolizidine alkaloids 1-24 were first tested for their phytotoxic activity against the test plant, and the results indicated that these natural product-based compounds showed no phytotoxic activity at 500 mg/mL.
The commercial plant virucide Ningnanmycin, perhaps the most successful registered anti-plant viral agent, Ribavirin and (R)antofine were used as the controls.
In order to investigate the subsituent effects of phenanthrene moiety, a series of racemic phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids 1, 4, 7, and 10-18 were designed, synthesized and evaluated for their antiviral activity (Table 1) . To our delight, all the racemic phenanthroquinuolizidine alkaloids displayed higher antiviral activity than Ribavirin, of which cryptopleurine (1) and alkaloid 16 exhibited significantly higher activity than (R)-antofine and commercial Ningnanmycin, thus emerged as novel potent lead compounds for anti-TMV agents. The in vitro activity and in vivo activity of each alkaloid are about similar, which indicates that these alkaloids possess a good biological availability.
Cryptopleurine (1) exhibited significantly higher activity than alkaloid 7, which indicated that the removal of methoxyl at 7- Phenanthroquinolizidines as Novel Anti-TMV Agents PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org position of the phenanthrene moiety is beneficial for mataining excellent antiviral activity. Alkaloids 4 and 7 displayed about similar activity, which indicated that the removal of methoxyl at 2position of the phenanthrene moiety is tolerant. The 6-position of the phenanthrene moiety, which is proposed to interact with TMV RNA [26] , really is a sensitive site: removal of 6-O methyl increased the antiviral activity (antiviral activity: 16.1; 18.2), which indicated that the 6-position may be a hydrogen donor site; replacement of 6-O methyl with 6-O cyclopropyl methyl significantly decreased the antiviral activity (antiviral activity: 1.17), which indicated that the steric effect is also a very important factor. Instead of 2,3-dimethoxyl or 6,7-dimethoxyl with methylenedioxyl is tolerant (antiviral activity: 7 < 10 < 11 < 12). However, replacement of 2,3-dimethoxyl or 6,7-dimethoxyl with ethylenedioxyl significantly increased the anti-TMV activity, especially for 6,7-dimethoxyl (antiviral activity: 15.13.14.7).
Further to investigated the effect of C 14a chirality on anti-TMV activity, a series of chiral phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids 2, 3, 5, 6, 8 and 9 were prepared and evaluated for their antiviral activity ( Table 2 ). The (R)-phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids exhibited significantly higher activity than their enantiomers (antiviral activity: 2.3; 5.6; 8.9). The structure difference between (R)-cryptopleurine (2) and (R)-antofine lies in the ''E'' ring. (R)-Antofine with a 5-member ''E'' ring displayed inhibition activity of 42.7% inactivation effect, 46.0% curative effect and 45.5% protection effect at 500 mg/mL. However, (R)-cryptopleurine (2) with a 6-member ''E'' ring exhibited significantly higher in vivo antiviral activity than (R)-antofine even at 100 mg/mL. The results further indicated that although phenanthroquinolizidine and phenanthroindolizidine are structure analogs, their biological properties are different [22] . For (R)-phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids: removal of 7-methoxyl increased antiviral activity (antiviral activity: 2.8); removal of 2-methoxyl decreased antiviral activity (antiviral activity: 5.6). However, the (S)-phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids displayed about similar moderate antiviral activity (antiviral activity: 3 < 6 < 9).
In order to investigated the effect of 15-hydroxyl on antiviral activity, a series of 15-hydroxyphenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids 19-24 were prepared and evaluated for their antiviral activity ( Table 3 ). The bioassay results showed that the 15-hydroxyphenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids also displayed good to excellent in vivo anti-TMV activity, of which alkaloids 19, 20, 22 and 24 exhibited signigicantly higher antiviral activity than Ribavirin, and alkaloids 19 and 22 displayed higher in vivo activity than Ningnanmycin at 100 mg/mL. The introduction of hydroxy group at 15-position significantly increased antiviral activity for (S)phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids (antiviral activity: 2.19; 5.21; 8.23), but decreased antiviral activity for (R)-phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids (antiviral activity: 20.3; 22.6; 24.9). The (S,S)-enantiomers 22 and 24 exhibited significantly higher antiviral activity than their corresponding enantiomers 21 and 23. However, the (S,S)-enantiomer 20 showed a lower activity than its enantiomer 19. For (14aS,15S)-phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids: removal of 7-methoxyl decreased antiviral activity (antiviral activity: 20,24); removal of 2-methoxyl increased antiviral activity (antiviral activity: 22.24). For (14aR,15R)phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids, removal of 7-methoxyl or 2methoxyl all increased antiviral activity (antiviral activity: 19.21.23).

Each compound was replicated at least three times.
Protective effect of compounds against TMV in vivo. The compound solution was smeared on the left side and the solvent serving as control on the right side of growing tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum var Xanthi nc) leaves of the same ages. The leaves were then inoculated with the virus after 12 h. A brush was dipped in TMV of 6 6 10 23 mg/mL to inoculate the leaves, which were previously scattered with silicon carbide.

Inhibition rate (%) = [(av local lesion no. of control 2 av local lesion no. of drug-treated)/av local lesion no. of control] 6 100%.
In summary, based on the literature report and our previous work, a series of phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids 1-24 were designed, prepared and evaluated for their anti-TMV activity for the first time. The in vitro and in vivo antiviral bioassays showed that most of these alkaloids exhibited good to excellent in vivo anti-TMV activity, of which compounds 1, 2, 15 and 16 displayed significantly higher activity than (R)-antofine and commercial Ningnanmycin at the same test condition. The in vitro activity and in vivo activity of each alkaloid are about similar, which indicates that these alkaloids possess a good biological availability. The introduction of 6-hydroxyl, which is proposed to interact with TMV RNA, did increased anti-TMV activity. The 14aRconfiguration was confirmed to be the preferred antiviral configuration for phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids. Introduction of hydroxy group at 15-position of phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids increased antiviral activity for S-configuration but decreased activity for R-configuration. Present study provides fundamental support for development and optimization of phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids as potential inhibitors of plant virus. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on anti-TMV activity of phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids. Further studies on mode of action are currently underway in our laboratories.
