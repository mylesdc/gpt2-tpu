DEGs in lungs and blood were determined between infected and control mouse of C57BL/6J 17 (B6) and 129S1/SvImJ (129) CC founder strains using the data set described by (Leist et al. 18 2016) (GSE74077). 26% of DEGs were shared in the lungs of B6 and 129 strains and 3.8 % 19
in the blood between B6 and 129 strains. However, only 0.1 % were shared when blood of 20 B6 was compared to lung of 129 and 0.3 % when lung of B6 was compared to blood of 129. 21
Thus, lung and blood DEG do not show a strong overlap and, therefore, lung DEGs of mice 22
should not be compared with blood DEGs in humans to evaluate validity of the mouse model. Table S1 : Sample list with annotations for CC strains 36 Table S11 : Genes in different groups from VENN diagram in Figure 4A . 52 Table S12 : Genes in different groups from VENN diagram in Figure 4B . 53 54
