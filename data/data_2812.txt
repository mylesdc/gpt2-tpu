Particles were generated by the method described by Roth et al. 2004 . The aerosol consists 28 of primary particles of 7-12nm diameter, forming agglomerates with an average number size 29 distribution of 48.9 ±1.8 nm (equivalent mobility diameter) and a mean number 30 concentration of 7.7 ±0.86 10 6 cm -3 (Andre et al. 2006 ). According to the particle spectra, 31 92% of the generated particle agglomerates where nanoparticles (<0.1 µm). Airborne 32 particles were collected on 0.2 μm pore size polytetrafluorethylen (PTFE) filters (no. 11807-33 50-N, Sartorius, Germany) using a vacuum pump, and removed from the filters using a 34 stainless steel spatula in a clean bench ( Figure S1A ). Particles were resupended in water in 35 the same way as for the instillation procedure, mounted on the TEM-grids and analyzed by Figure S61 D, E and F show a 4 fold 127 magnification of A, B and C. Immunostaining for the NFkB driven GFP-reporter protein shows 128 a clear inflammatory activation of alveolar epithelial cells and macrophages (red staining) for 129 the LPS exposed lungs and BAL macrophages, not seen in sham and CNP exposed animals. 130 Images shown are representative for micrographs obtained from two different mice. 131
