Estimates of Pagel's lambda (λ) for bat species' traits based on the Bininda-Emonds et al. [1] and Shi & Rabosky phylogenetic trees [2] . Values of λ close to 1 indicate that species' traits are related to shared branch lengths, while values close to 0 indicate traits are phylogenetically independent. Significant values of λ are bolded.
