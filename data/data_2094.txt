. Growth curves of recombinant MHV-α viruses. Murine LR7 cells were inoculated at 1 MOI=1 with the recombinant and wild-type A59 strain viruses, respectively. At the indicated 2 times post infection, infectivity in the culture supernatants was assayed by TCID50 analysis. 3
Error bars represent 1 SEM, n=4. 4 Figure S4 . Morphology of negatively stained VSVΔG/GFP-Gα virus at neutral and low pH. 1 20% sucrose cushion purified stocks of VSVΔG/GFP-Gα, resuspended in TD buffer were 2 sequentially brought to pH 6.5 and to the final pH of 5.5. Samples were negatively stained and 3 imaged by electron microscopy. Three representative images for pH 6.5 and pH 5.5 are shown in 4 the left or right panel, respectively. 5
