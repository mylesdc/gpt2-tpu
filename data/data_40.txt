The full-length genome sequence of a novel swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV), CH/FJWT/2018, was determined, which was genetically most closely related to CN/GDWT/2017, recently discovered in Fujian, China. The indel sites of the spike (S) gene of CH/FJWT/2018 were most similar to those of bat-origin SADS-related coronaviruses.
Alphacoronavirus in the family Coronaviridae and is an enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus (1) . In January 2017, SADS-CoV was first discovered in suckling piglets with severe enteritis in South China after ruling out the presence of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), and other known pathogens associated with piglet diarrhea (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) . SADS-CoV had 95% nucleotide (nt) identity at the full-genome level with the previously reported bat-HKU2 strains (3, 4) .
In this study, fecal and small intestinal samples (n Ï­ 168) collected from diarrheal piglets from seven farms in Fujian Province, China, in 2018 were tested for the presence of SADS-CoV based on reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), as described previously (6) . CoV, and 98.9% nt identity with bat CoV HKU2 (EF203064) (10, 11) , respectively. The complete genome sequence of CH/FJWT/2018 is 3 nt longer than that of HKU2. The mutations that occurred included a 3-nt (TTG) insertion between nucleotides 4554 and 4555 in the ORF1a gene, a 6-nt (GGCCTC) insertion between nucleotides 20504 and 20505, a 3-nt (GGC) deletion between nucleotides 22463 and 22465 in the spike (S) gene, and a 3-nt (GTA) deletion between nt 24773 and 24775 in the membrane (M) gene. Interestingly, the insertion/deletion patterns of CH/FJWT/2018 were more similar to those of bat-origin SADS-related coronaviruses (SADSr-CoVs) (6) than to those of swine-origin SADS-CoVs, suggesting that CH/FJWT/2018 might originate from bats. The findings determined in this study suggest that CH/FJWT/2018 was a novel SADS-CoV, and further study is required to address its biological properties, etiologies, and pathogenesis.
