Under certain circumstances, we can find a simple expression for R 0 from the next generation matrix. The derivation is similar to the simplification of R 0 for the multi-city epidemic model described in Ref. [1] . For this we need the following theorems:
Proof By Theorem 0.1 it is true that for the matrices C and B where C = B T , the spectral radius of C and B is the same: ρ(C) = ρ(B). By Theorem 0.2 it is true that the spectral radius of matrix C is bounded by the limits of the row sums of matrix C: min(
As C = B T the row sums of matrix C are equivalent to the column sums of matrix B: min( j c ij ) = min( i b ij ). Therefore it follows that Eqn. S1 may be equivalently written:
where T was the time spent infected (which depended on recovery rate r such that T = 1 r , same for all pixels), N i was the number of individuals in pixel i, infectious contacts were made with other individuals present in the pixel with rate β and m was the mobility matrix defined earlier. We let D k=1 m ki N k = N N i , the total number of individuals in pixel i at any time (where m ki is the probability that for an individual from pixel k, given that the individual made a contact, this contact was with an individual from pixel i). Recall that D k=1 m jk = 1. Then summing the jth column of the next generation matrix gives:
This holds for all columns j of G. Therefore using Corollary S1.3 it follows that ρ(G) = βT . This holds for all values of s d and γ in the mobility matrix m and for any resolution (any number of pixels over the same region).
We showed in the main text that the final epidemic size (the final cumulative attack rate) for a population was the same at all resolutions and all mobilities we considered (as long as for all pixels, i and j, m ij > 0). Here we demonstrate how this is an outcome of the particular way our model was defined. The derivation is based on those in Refs. [3, 4] .
Our SIR meta-population model can be defined as a system of differential equations as follows:
where r is the recovery rate and λ i is the force of infection in pixel i:
D is the total number of pixels, m is the mobility model and N i is the total number of individuals in pixel i. Transmission occurs during a contact between an infected and a susceptible individual at a rate β.
Then it is straightforward to show that a final equilibrium exists, we represent this equilibrium as S i (∞), I i (∞) and R i (∞) and we can show that I i (∞) = 0 and S i (∞) + R i (∞) = N i .
We have shown earlier that R 0 for the system is constant and R 0 = βT , where T = 1 r , the mean infectious period.
In each pixel i the fraction who did not get infected is σ i = S i (∞) S i (0) , so the final epidemic size in each pixel is x i = N i (1 − σ i ) (recall that N i is the total population in pixel i). Then the total final epidemic size in the whole population is
We divide dS i dt (Eqn. (S4)) by S i and integrate between 0 and ∞, then we have:
and we note that:
and as it is also true that:
we can write (recalling that 1 r = T ):
Now, with the condition that m ij > 0 for all i, j (i.e. there is always some contact between every pixel), then if the total final epidemic size is non-zero, then the final epidemic size in each pixel, x i or (1 − σ i ), is also non-zero [3] . To see this, let an arbitrary pixel i have no infection, so σ i = 1, then Eqn. (S11) implies that
(S13)
But, as m ij > 0, then for the left hand side to be zero it must be that (1 − σ l ) = 0 for all l, so no pixel has infection. Therefore, if Z > 0 then x i > 0 for all pixels i. Now, we focus on the RHS of Eqn. (S11). Note that the matrix m (mobility) is a positive, right stochastic matrix, as its rows sum to 1. Therefore, ρ(m) = 1 (by definition of a stochastic matrix, and using Corollary S1.3).
We can simplify the RHS as follows (recall that D p=1 m pj N p = N N j :
, then the RHS of Eqn.
(S11) is the ith row of matrix C multiplied by (1-σ), which is a vector of length D with entries (1−σ j ). Note that the matrix C is mathematically similar to R, the next generation matrix (defined in Eqn. (S2)); this means that there exists a matrix ∆, such that C = ∆ −1 R∆. In this case, ∆ is the D x D matrix with the number of individuals in each pixel, N i , on its diagonal. As C and R are similar, they have the same spectral radius: ρ(C) = ρ(R) = R 0 = βT . We note that the row sums of C are all equal to βT , the proof is similar to that for the column sums of R in the next generation matrix simplification (i.e. note that D j=1 D l=1 m ij m lj N l N N j = 1).
Then, as all rows are equal, transmission in each patch is equal (to βT ) and so, as in [3] , the final fraction infected is given implicitly by F = 1 − exp(−R 0 F ). With R 0 = 1.8 as in the main text, this can be solved numerically to give F = 0.73243, as we saw from the simulations.
