We report four full-genome sequences of bovine coronavirus (BCoV) isolates from dairy calves in Pennsylvania obtained in 2016 and 2017. BCoV is a pathogen of great importance to cattle health, and this is the first report of fullgenome sequences of BCoV from PA cattle.
B ovine coronavirus (BCoV), a member of the Betacoronavirus genus of the Coronaviridae family, is an enveloped virus with an approximately 31-kb single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome. Infection of cattle with bovine coronavirus is a major contributor to diarrhea in calves, is involved in the etiology of winter dysentery in adult cattle, and serves as a contributing pathogen in bovine respiratory disease complex (1, 2) .
Coronaviruses are difficult to cultivate in the laboratory, and only 17 full-genome sequences of unique BCoV isolates are publicly available in GenBank (3). We generated full-genome sequences of four BCoV isolates, 7-16-23, 4-17-03, 4-17-08, and 4-17-25, recovered from fecal samples of 3-to 14-day-old dairy calves in July 2016 and April 2017. Fecal samples were screened for presence of BCoV genetic material by real-time reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR), as described previously (4) . The study has been approved by the Pennsylvania State University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC protocol no. 46948). Fecal extracts from positive samples were cultured on HRT-18G cells, and after 3 to 5 days, culture medium samples were rescreened by qRT-PCR. Libraries were prepared from viral RNA extracted from positive-culture media using the TruSeq stranded mRNA kit without the poly(A) selection step. Genetic material was subjected to whole-genome sequencing using a 150-nucleotide (nt) read-length single-read approach on the Illumina MiSeq platform. Sequence files were assembled with the BCoV Mebus strain (GenBank accession number U00735) as a reference using SeqMan NGen build 15.0.1.1.
The four sequences generated contained 31,016 to 31,032 nucleotides, with 99.36% nucleotide identity between isolates. Following alignment of full-genome nucleotide sequences by the MUSCLE algorithm implemented in the MEGA7 package (5, 6), phylogenetic analysis indicated that the four isolates were closely related to one another and shared 99% coverage and 99% identity with their closest relative, sable antelope coronavirus US/OH1/2003 (GenBank accession number EF424621). Other closely related sequences were those of isolates from diverse cattle and captive ruminants obtained in Ohio, a neighboring state with a border approximately 270 km away from the collection sites of these samples.
The ORF1ab, HE, S, NS5, E, M, and N genes of the four sequences were subjected to BLASTN analysis (7, 8) . According to these analyses, the ORF1ab and HE genes of the four isolates were closely related to the strain calf-giraffe coronavirus US/OH3/2006 (GenBank accession number EF424624), with Ͼ99% nucleotide identity. Similarly, the S, E, and M genes from all four isolates had Ͼ99% nucleotide identity with sequences with GenBank accession numbers HE616738 (strain VB 7/09/MAYABEQUE/2009), KX982264 (strain BCoV_2014_13), and EF424615 (strain E-AH65), respectively. Of interest, the first codon position of the E gene of 4-17-25 contained a point mutation shifting ATG to ACG. The N gene sequence was similar to that of BCoV strain E-AH65 in most of the isolates, but that of 4-17-08 shared Ͼ99% nucleotide identity with that of the giraffe coronavirus US/OH3/2003 strain (GenBank accession number EF424623).
Accession number(s). The complete genome sequences of the BCoV isolates 4-17-03, 4-17-25, 4-17-08, and 7-16-23 have been deposited in GenBank under the accession numbers MH043952 to MH043955.
