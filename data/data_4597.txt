Despite being frequently detected as a copathogen in respiratory infections, the human bocavirus has also been shown to be a major player in viral respiratory mono-infections in all age-groups. [1] [2] [3] [4] However, although known since more than a decade, cultivation of the virus remains a major challenge and was so far limited to some selected laboratories, which made either use of primary air-liquid interface cell cultures or not commercially available CuFi-8 cells. 5, 6 Recently, Ghietto and coworkers proposed that CaCo-2 cells, a cell line derived from a colorectal tumor, could be used to study parts of the HBoV replication cycle, as these cells could be infected with HBoV and shed the virus. 7 Without doubts, this is a major progress, as CaCo-2 cells are easily available and do not require extensive and expensive cell culturing efforts. Nevertheless, especially with respect to the pathogenesis of HBoV strains causing respiratory infections, the CaCo-2 model remains limited, although the study by Ghietto and coworkers unintendedly confirmed the previous assumption that HBoV displays a tropism to colorectal tumors. 8, 9 In search for alternative cell culture models, we became aware of the cell line T84 (ATCC ® CCL-248™), which originates from a colon metastasis of a bronchial tumor; the colorectal localization of the primary tumor from which T84 derived as well as the fact that the tumor was of bronchial origin made the cells thus an ideal candidate cell line to test, as two putative perquisites for HBoV growth; that is, tumor type(s) and target/organ tissue were fulfilled. T84 cells could be easily grown as monolayer cultures and by mounting them on filter membranes coated with rat or human collagen can be differentiated into a multilayer respiratory epithelium (detailed protocols on request).
