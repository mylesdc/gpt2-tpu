were administered due to exposure in enzootic areas). The majority of animals known to be involved in exposures in Alaska were dogs [1] . Rates of serious dog bites to humans (those requiring hospitalization) are significantly higher in Alaska than the national average. The high rate of those severe dog bite injuries are concentrated in the same regions as reported cases of animal rabies on a per capita basis [3] This highlights the importance of rabies to human health in Alaska, especially in those regions with enzootic rabies activity that are characterized by significant healthcare disparities and limited access to both veterinary and human medical services [4] .
