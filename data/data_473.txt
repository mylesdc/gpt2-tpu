S13 Table. Different criteria of importance for the choice of a suitable binding site comparison method. A plus in brackets means that the predicted binding site has to be given with the corresponding coordinates of a binding site prediction as "artificial" ligand, a simple plus denotes tools that offer a way of binding site prediction. With respect to run time evaluation, "+", "/", and "-" denote comparison algorithms that require several ns, Âµs, or s per comparison, respectively. With respect to the scoring, a "+" was assigned to those tools where the intervals of upper and lower whiskers of active and inactive pairs did not overlap. A "/" denotes tools where the upper and lower quartile for the pairs do not overlap. With respect to other factors, tools that were clearly outperformed by many other tools were assigned a "-".
