Willebrand factor (vWF) polyclonal antibody and rabbit anti-early endosome antigen 1 (EEA1) monoclonal antibody were purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). Rabbit anti-Akt polyclonal antibody and rabbit phospho-Akt (Ser473) polyclonal antibody were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA). Mouse anti-human Na+, K+ ATPase antibody was purchased from BD Biosciences (San Jose, CA). Unless otherwise indicated, all reagents were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Rockford, IL).
For immunoblotting assays, equal amounts of soluble protein were subjected to 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Proteins were transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and then incubated with primary antibody at 1:1000 overnight, followed by incubation with a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody at 1:2000 for 1 h. Blots were visualized by using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE). All experiments were repeated three times.
For the IP study, equal amounts of soluble proteins were mixed with Dynabead Protein G (Invitrogen) conjugated with anti-Akt-1 antibody, and were incubated for 24 h at 4 Â°C. The Dynabead-antibody-antigen complex pellets were precipitated and separated using DynaMag-2 (Invitrogen). Samples were then separated by gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblotting. All experiments were repeated three times.
For EM assays, HUVECs were subjected to fixation, LR White embedding, and ultrathin sectioning as previously described [3] . Uninfected HUVECs were used as mock controls and were subjected to the same procedure.
