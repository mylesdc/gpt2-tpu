1. For a given trait, conduct a genome scan according to model:
where y i is the trait level for individual i, µ is the intercept, batch b is a categorical fixed effect covariate with five levels b = 1, . . . , 5 representing five sequencing batches for both gene expression and chromatin accessibility and b[i] denoting the batch relevant to i, ε i ∼ N(0, σ 2 ) models the residual error, and QTL i models the genetic effect at the locus.
2. Perform permutation scans to characterize a GEV. Calculate a genome-wide error rate controlled pvalue, permP G , from the observed maximum logP of the genome scan. The permP G is stored to be used as input to an FDR procedure.
3. Specify a genome-wide α step for determining whether subsequent conditional scans should be conducted for the trait. We set α step = 0.1. If permP G > α step , no further conditional scans are conducted.
4. If permP G ≤ α step , steps 1-3 are repeated for an additional conditional scan of the outcome. For j > 1, the j th conditional scan uses the same form of alternative and null model as described in Eq 1, except with the inclusion of locus effects from the peak associations from previous stages. Generally, the alternative model for conditional scan J follows as:
with locus j i representing the locus effect of the peak association from the j th stage scan of the outcome for individual i, and is also included in the null model of conditional scans. Now steps 2-4 are repeated.
A multi-stage conditional scan approach could have issues with over-fitting, given the data comprise 47 mice and each QTL and locus effect represents the estimation of seven fixed effects. However, permutation thresholds were found to appropriately compensate for this potential problem based on the recalculation of the GEV using permutations of the conditional scans in step 2. Fig S21 provides a clear example in which the gene Gpn3 has a local-eQTL detected after a strong distal-eQTL is conditioned on in lung tissue.
