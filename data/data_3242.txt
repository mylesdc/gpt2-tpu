A. The basic reproduction number R 0 of system (1)
A. The basic reproduction number R 0 of system (1) Through simple calculation, we can obtain a disease free equilibrium E 1 = (S 1 , 0, 0, 0, 0, R 1 ). Then we use the spectral radius of the next generation matrix (the method proposed by the Van Den Driessche in [1] ) to get the expression of R 0 of system (1) . Firstly, only the infected compartments satisfied by the following system are considered:
where F denotes the rate of appearance of new infection and V denotes the rate of transfer of individuals. Calculating the derivative of F and V about x = (E, A, I, H), respectively. Then substitute initial data(S 0 , E 0 , A 0 , I 0 , H 0 , R 0 ) into variables, we can get:
and thus
. The expression of R 0 is as follows:
In this part, we give the expression of R c :
The actual situation is that there is no additional confirmed cases reported from July 4, 2015. In this case we are more concerned about the final size of confirmed cases during disease prevalence process 
For an arbitrary function x(t) with non-negative components,
Apply this equation, we integrate the above equation from t = 0 to +∞:
Similarly, we have: 
It is easy to get:
Integration of the first equation of model(3) from 0 to t 1 , we get:
Letting t 1 → +∞, we have:
Since S(0), A(0), E(0), I(0) and H(0) are known, we obtain a relation about the final size of accumulated confirmed cases.
