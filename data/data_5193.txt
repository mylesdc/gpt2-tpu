Two porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) strains, named DH1/2016 and DH2/ 2016, were isolated from feces of piglets which had severe watery diarrhea symptoms. A comparison of the complete genome sequences suggested that the DH1/2016 and DH2/2016 strains are highly homologous to each other and to PDCoVs isolated in early 2014 from the United States.
strains was similar to that of the previously described strain KOR/KNU14-04/2014 (GenBank accession no. KM820765) (7) . The full-length genome of DH/2016 strains had very high nucleotide (99.7%) and amino acid identities (99.5%) compared to the KNU14-04 strain of PDCoV. In particular, open reading frame 1a/1b (19 amino acids [aa]) and nucleocapsid (2 aa) gene substitutions at the amino acid level were observed.
According to a phylogenetic analysis based on the full-length PDCoV genomes of 65 isolates available in GenBank, the DH/2016 strains belong to a strain identified in 2014 by the U.S. groups separated from PDCoVs reported in both China and the United States. In comparison to the complete genome sequence of the viruses isolated in China (GenBank accession numbers JQ065042 and JQ065043) and the United States (GenBank accession numbers KJ462462, KJ481931, KJ567050, KJ569769, KJ601777, KJ601778, KJ601779, and KJ601780), the DH/2016 strains were also highly similar (98.8 to 99.0% and 99.6 to 99.8%, respectively).
In conclusion, our study contributed to the collection of the complete genome sequences of PDCoVs, which might be useful for molecular analyses of the virus.
Accession number(s). The complete genome sequences (DH1/2016 and DH2/2016) have been deposited to GenBank under the accession numbers KY354363 and KY354364.
