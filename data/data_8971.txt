We describe here the procedure used to simulate an epidemic with parameters β t ,β t , m, q, ξ Y , τ Y 0 , τ Y 1 , ξ X , τ X 0 , τ X 1 in a population of size N including N hw healthcare workers, N hp hospitalized patients and N gp people in the general population, so that N = N gp + N hw + N hp . The first infected patient was assumed to belong to the general population. We assumed that his/her symptoms appear on O 1 = February 15, 2003, and he/she is admitted to hospital on A 1 = February 22, 2003. Furthermore, we assumed that he/she dies from SARS (d 1 = 1). The time ν 1 when the patient becomes infectious was sampled from a uniform distribution on {O 1 − 1, . . . , O 1 + 4}. His/her time of contamination was then chosen as ω 1 = ν 1 − 5. The duration of infectious period for the first case was drawn from a uniform distribution in {0, . . . , X}, where X was sampled from the gamma distribution with mean and standard deviation (m, q). The patient's duration of hospital stay was drawn from a gamma distribution with mean and standard deviation as in the dataset. The number n C t+1 of new category-C individuals infected on day t + 1 was drawn from a binomial distribution with parameters S C t and p C t where [1] :
where the λ C t were defined in the Material and Methods part. For each case i infected on day t + 1, ω i = t + 1 and ν i = ω i + 5. The probability π gp that a case would die was estimated as the observed mortality rate among patients in the general population : π gp = 0.1308. Similarly, the probability of dying was given by π hp = 0.3977 for nosocomial SARS cases and by π hw = 0.0228 for a healthcare worker. For all i = 1, . . . , n C t , category C patient i had a probability π C of dying. If the patient would not die (d i = 0), the duration of the infectious period was drawn from the gamma distribution with mean and standard deviation (m, q). If the patient would die (d i = 1), a number X was drawn from the gamma distribution with mean and standard deviation (m, q) ; then, the duration of the infectious period was drawn from a uniform distribution on {0, . . . , X} to take into account the potential reduction of infectious period caused by death. The time of the first symptoms was drawn from a uniform distribution in {ν i − 4, . . . , ν i + 1} . For all non nosocomial cases, the time from symptom onset to hospital admission was drawn from a gamma distribution, with parameters depending on the time of symptom onset, taken from Donnelly et al. [2] . For nosocomial cases, the admission time was arbitrarily chosen as November 5, 2002. The time of discharge from hospital was Y days after symptoms onset, where Y was sampled from the dataset.
