Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is an emerging virus that was first reported in humans in June 2012 [1] . To date, MERS-CoV continues to infect humans with a fatality rate of~35%. At least 27 countries have reported human infections with MERS-CoV (https://www.who.int/emergencies/mers-cov/en/). MERS-CoV is a zoonotic virus. Like severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), MERS-CoV is believed to have originated from bats [2, 3] . However, whereas the bat-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV was likely mediated by palm civets as intermediate hosts, humans likely acquired MERS-CoV from dromedary camels [4] [5] [6] . Human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV does occur, but it is limited mostly to health care environments [7, 8] . Moreover, whereas SARS-CoV recognizes angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a cellular receptor [9,10], MERS-CoV uses dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) to enter target cells [11, 12] . Currently, no vaccines or antiviral therapeutics have been approved for the prevention or treatment of MERS-CoV infection, although a number of them have been developed preclinically and/or tested clinically [13] [14] [15] [16] .
transmission in rabbits [30] . Fan and colleagues report the development of an hDPP4-expressing mouse model through inserting hDPP4 gene into a constitutive and ubiquitous gene expression locus using CRISPR/Cas9 technology. This mouse model is susceptible to MERS-CoV infection [31] . These articles have established platforms for testing vaccines and therapeutic agents targeting MERS-CoV.
Effective vaccines are essential for preventing MERS-CoV infection. The MERS-CoV surface spike (S) protein is a key target for vaccine design [14] . The S protein comprises two subunits: the S1 subunit is responsible for binding to the DPP4 receptor via a receptor-binding domain (RBD), and the S2 subunit mediates virus-host membrane fusion [32] [33] [34] [35] . Several MERS-CoV S protein-based vaccines have been developed; when tested in animal models, they showed protective efficacy against MERS-CoV [14] . In this issue, Schindewolf and Menachery summarize the progress of MERS-CoV S-protein-based vaccine development and also describe potential challenges [36] . Zhou and colleagues review current advances in RBD-based MERS-CoV vaccines [37] . A research paper by Adney and colleagues evaluates the efficacy of a MERS-CoV S1 subunit vaccine aided by adjuvants; the authors report reduced and delayed viral shedding in dromedary camels as well as the complete protection of alpacas from MERS-CoV infection [38] . This and other studies demonstrate that the protective efficacy of MERS vaccines positively correlates with neutralizing antibody titers in serum [38, 39] . In addition to inducing neutralizing antibodies, some types of vaccines can induce cellular immune responses against MERS-CoV. Other than the S protein, structural proteins such as the nucleocapsid (N) protein may also serve as vaccine targets. Here, Veit and colleagues report that a MERS-CoV N protein-based vaccine, which is delivered through a modified Vaccinia virus, induces CD8 + T cell responses in a mouse model; they further identify a MERS-CoV N protein-specific CD8 + T cell epitope on the vaccine [40] . Overall, these reports demonstrate that a variety of promising vaccine tools are available to prevent MERS-CoV infection in humans and other animals.
Therapeutics are critical tools for treating MERS-CoV infection. Again, the MERS-CoV S protein is an important target for therapeutic development [16] . MERS-CoV S2 contains two heptad repeat regions, HR1 and HR2, that are critical for S protein-mediated membrane fusion [34] . Hence, peptides mimicking HR1 or HR2 may interfere with the viral membrane-fusion process [34] . Moreover, RBD-targeting neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) can block the viral attachment step [37] . In addition to conventional mAbs, single-domain antibodies isolated from camelids, called nanobodies (Nbs), can also block RBD/receptor interactions; these Nbs have been gaining popularity as therapeutic agents due to their small size and high stability [41, 42] . Thus, both the HR1/HR2 peptide mimics and RBD-targeting mAbs and Nbs may serve as MERS-CoV entry inhibitors. Furthermore, small molecules targeting the S protein or nonstructural proteins may serve as therapeutic alternatives to peptide mimics and antibodies [16, 43] . In this issue, two review articles report the current advances in therapeutic neutralizing antibodies, one by Han and colleagues and the other by Zhou and colleagues [37, 44] . The latter article also discusses potential strategies and challenges to improving the efficacy of therapeutic neutralizing antibodies. In a research article, He and colleagues describe the construction and expression of dimeric and trimeric Nbs that target MERS-CoV RBD and further demonstrate the strong stability and high neutralizing activity of these Nbs against multiple MERS-CoV strains [42] . In another research article, Xia and colleagues report that three peptides mimicking HR2 from HKU4 (which is a MERS-related coronavirus from bats) strongly inhibit MERS-CoV infection [45] . Interestingly, Wang and colleagues report that the combination of a MERS-CoV HR2 peptide mimic and an RBD-targeting neutralizing mAb demonstrate potent synergistic effects in inhibiting MERS-CoV S protein-mediated viral entry [46] . In another research article, Jiang and colleagues report that an antibody targeting complement receptor C5aR1 inhibits MERS-CoV infection, indicating that MERS-CoV infection elicits the over-activation of the complement system, and this process can be blocked by anti-C5aR1 antibodies [47] . Moreover, Liang and colleagues review advances in the development of small-molecular MERS-CoV inhibitors [48] . Overall, these articles confirm that anti-MERS-CoV therapeutics have great potentials in treating MERS-CoV infections in humans and other animals.
To summarize, significant progress has been made in MERS-CoV research in the past seven years since the virus was discovered. This progress includes, but is not limited to, the epidemiology, transmission, and pathogenesis of MERS-CoV, as well as animal models, vaccines, and antivirals for MERS-CoV. This special issue of Viruses provides updated reports on this progress. However, challenges remain. For example, we still do not understand how exactly MERS-CoV transmits from bats to camels or humans. Moreover, compared to HIV and influenza viruses, the potential market for MERS-CoV vaccines and therapeutics is much smaller, making commercialization of MERS-related products more challenging. Nevertheless, the past two decades have witnessed the emergence of two highly pathogenic coronaviruses, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. While these two viruses remain significant threats to global health, future novel coronaviruses with pandemic potential may emerge from their animal reservoirs and infect humans. Thus, research into MERS-CoV should remain a high priority for the virology community. In fact, the impressive progress in MERS-CoV research has benefitted tremendously from previous research into coronaviruses including SARS-CoV. Therefore, scientists' current efforts regarding MERS-CoV will prepare humans to battle any future novel coronaviruses with pandemic potential.
