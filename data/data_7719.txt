the Deltacoronavirus genus of the Coronaviridae family, is an enveloped, positive-sense, single-strand RNA virus (1) . Previously, only one surveillance study reported detection of PorCoV HKU15 in pigs in Hong Kong (1) . It has never been associated with clinical diseases in pigs. On 7 February 2014, a deltacoronavirus (porcine coronavirus HKU15-OH1987) was detected in fecal and small intestine samples from a pig farm in Ohio (unpublished data). Subsequently, the whole genome of the coronavirus was sequenced and the virus was determined to be PorCoV HKU15 (L. Wang, B. Byrum, and Y. Zhang, submitted for publication). Here, we report the whole genome sequence of another PorCoV HKU15 strain, IN2847, which has been detected in Indiana.
Three fecal samples and an intestine sample from pigs experiencing an outbreak of a diarrheal disease at a farm located in Indiana were submitted to the Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory, Ohio Department of Agriculture. RNA samples were extracted and tested for porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) and PorCoV HKU15. All samples were positive for PorCoV In conclusion, PorCoV HKU15 Indiana strain IN2847 is similar in genetic profile to another U.S. strain of PorCoV HKU15, OH1987, detected in Ohio. The sequence data suggest that both U.S. strains of PorCoV HKU15 were introduced into the United States by a common source. Further study of the virus from other geographic locations in the United States will facilitate our understanding of the genetic diversity and evolution of PorCoV HKU15 in the United States.
Nucleotide sequence accession number. The complete genome sequence of PorCoV HKU15 strain IN2847 was submitted to GenBank under the accession no. KJ569769.
