S-4 1-Phenethoxy-1H-benzo[d] [1, 2, 3] S-24 Reaction of 1-phenethoxy-1H-benzo[d] [1, 2, 3] triazole (1f) with NaN 3 leading to (2azidoethyl)benzene S-25 2-Cinnamylcyclohexan-1-one (18)

Synthesized from At-OTs (0.878 g, 3.0 mmol), 3-buten-1-ol (312 μL, 3.6 mmol), and DBU (0.54 mL, 3.6 mmol) in anhydrous THF (15 mL), over 24 h at 60 ˚C. The reaction mixture was partitioned between EtOAc and water. 
Benzyl nitrile (6) [11] : Benzyl phenyl ether (7) [12] : To a solution of benzyloxy benzotriazole 1d (112.6 mg, 0.50 mmol) in anhydrous DMSO (1.25 mL), were added phenol (94.2 mg, 1.0 mmol) and Cs 2 CO 3 (325.8 mg, 1.0 mmol). The mixture was stirred at 100 ˚C for 3 h. The mixture was then diluted with Et 2 O and washed with a water/brine mixture (1:1), followed by water (3-4x). The organic layer was dried over anhydrous Na 2 SO 4 , filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The crude material was purified on a silica gel column using 3% EtOAc/hexanes as eluting solvent.
Compound 7 was obtained as a white solid (42.6 mg, 46% yield The organic layer was dried over anhydrous Na 2 SO 4 , filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The crude material was purified on a silica gel column. Initial elution with 3% EtOAc in hexanes led to the isolation of a less polar, minor component, and further elution with 6%
EtOAc in hexanes led to the isolation of the major component. NMR analysis of this material indicated it to be a 7.3:1 mixture of (2-azidoethyl)benzene [22] and precursor 1f. 
cinnamylcyclohexan-1-one (20b): To a solution of cinnamyloxy benzotriazole 1g (125.6 mg, 0.50 mmol) in DMSO (2 mL), Pd(PPh 3 ) 4 (28.8 mg, 25 μmol, 5 mol%) was added, and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 5 min. Then t-butylcyclohexanone (231 mg, 1.50 mmol) and pyrrolidine (12 µL, 0.15 mmol, 30 mol%) were added. The reaction vial was flushed with nitrogen gas and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 2 h. The reaction mixture was diluted with EtOAc and was washed with water followed by brine. The organic layer was dried over anhydrous Na 2 SO 4 and evaporated. The crude material was chromatographed on a silica gel column by sequential elution with hexanes, 1% (2 x 100 mL), and 2% EtOAc in hexanes. Syn-20a and anti-20b were obtained as a clear oil (113.4 mg, 84% yield) and were an inseparable mixture of diastereomers. In this mixture syn-20a was the major isomer. However, during the chromatographic purification a few fractions of pure syn-20a (early eluting) and a few fractions containing anti-20b (late eluting) were obtained. These fractions were used to characterize the two diastereomers. 
In an oven-dried NMR tube were placed BOP (13.2 mg, 30.0 μmol, 1 molar equiv) in distilled THF (0.5 mL) at -78 o C. The tube was transferred to the NMR probe maintained at -30 o C and a spectrum was acquired. The tube was removed and placed at -78 o C, 2-phenylethanol (3.6 μL, 30.0 μmol, 1 molar equiv) was added, and another spectrum was obtained at -30 o C. The tube was again removed, placed at -78 o C, and DBU (4.5 μL, 30.0 μmol, 1 molar equiv) was added.
A spectrum was obtained every five minutes for 50 min at -30 o C (total acquisition time for each spectrum was about 4 min). The NMR tube was then left at room temperature and a spectrum was obtained after 24 h.
