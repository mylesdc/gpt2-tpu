a Initial seed value for ω (dN/dS) used in the maximum likelihood simulation b
Model of codon frequency c Twice the di erence in the natural logs of the likelihoods (∆lnL x 2) of the two models being compared. This value is used in a likelihood ratio test along with the degrees of freedom. In all cases (M1a-M2a), (M7-M8), (M8a-M8), a model that allows positive selection is compared to a null model. The p-value indicates the con dence with which the null model can be rejected. d The tree length is the number of substitutions per site along all branches in the phylogeny. It is calculated as the sum of the branch lengths, and is a representation of total diversity in the dataset e dN/dS value of the dN/dS>1 class of codons in M8, and the percent of codons falling in that class. f Posterior probabilities of codons under positive selection in M8 were inferred using the Naive Empirical Bayes (NEB) algorithm. Codons listed were assigned to the dN/dS > 1 class in M8 with P > 0.90 by NEB. g 114** 115** 119** 122* 145** 170** 185** 206** 212** 230** 231** 2 d 2 d 2 d
