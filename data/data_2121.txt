Objectives: To analyze trends in mortalities and causes of death among under-5 children in Beijing, China between 1992 and 2015, and to forecast U5MRs in the period of 2016-2020.
2. We are the first to report the health condition of under-5 children after "Selective Two-child Policy"
implemented in Beijing in 2014 and forecast U5MRs in the following five years.
3. The accuracy of our study is very reliable because it is an entire-population epidemiological study covering all under-5 children in all districts in Beijing.
1. Due to the particularity of region division in Beijing and lacking of specific data in each district, we did not analyze the differences between rural and urban areas. System in 1991 and has made great progress in reducing U5MR in past decades. The nationwide U5MR has achieved MDG4 in 2008, 7 years in advance of the target. [2] [3] [4] [5] In 2015, U5MR in China declined to 10.7‰, a 80.1% reduction from 1990. 6 Beijing established Beijing Under-5 mortality rate Surveillance Network in 1992. However, there has been no report on the long-term dynamic trend in U5MR since the monitoring network established.
The distribution of death causes is influenced by the development of social economy and health care. There were some changes in nationwide distribution of death causes that pneumonia dropped to the third place from the first place, while congenital heart disease climbed to the fourth place from the sixth place during 1996-2006. 7 Beijing, the capital city of China, is experiencing the fastest economic and health care changes. However, the distribution of death causes in under-5 children has not been investigated in the past 24 years.
What's more, Beijing implemented "Selective Two-child Policy" in 2014 8 and "Entire Two-child Policy" in 2016 9 which has led to a boost in the number of livebirths and elder parturient. 10 It is unknown whether the policy changing will contribute to an increase in U5MR. Therefore, it is worth to establish a forecasting model to predict U5MR in advance.
The present study aimed to analyze the dynamic changes in U5MR and the distribution of death causes in Beijing,
China from 1992 to 2015 and to establish a forecasting model to predict U5MR in the following five years.
We Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) at district level. What's more, data are extracted from 20% of the communities and hospitals annually for quality control inspection and investigation of missing report. Then maternal and child health care institution at municipal level also quarterly checks the cards reported by district level and extracts data collected from 20% of the districts annually for inspection to ensure data integrity and accuracy. In addition, data-related staff of local maternal and child health care facilities are trained by specialist groups at regular intervals. Annual livebirth under reporting rate was less than 1% and death under reporting rate was less than 0.5% during recent 10 years in Beijing.
The surveillance objects are livebirths. A livebirth was defined as a fetus born after 28 gestational weeks (or with a birth weight >1000 g) with at least one of the following vital signs: heartbeat, breathing, pulsation of the umbilical cord, or contraction of voluntary muscle. Only livebirths who or whose parents have census register in Beijing were included. During 1992-2015, a total of 1,881,952 livebirths and 12,541 deaths were under surveillance.
Categorization of causes of death was in accordance with the International Categorization of Diseases (ICD-10).
We collected data based on "Children's Death Reporting Card" of the surveillance network and information system. We used double entry and consistency check with 
The trends in mortality rates and distribution of death causes were analyzed by descriptive statistics and 
The total number of death in neonates (<28 days), infants aged 28 days-1 year and children aged 1-4 years was 7619 (60.75%), 2217 (17.68%) and 2705 (21.55%) respectively. Deaths in neonates accounted for more than 50% of all deaths among for under-5 children in these 24 consecutive years. and 77.08%. In the five leading causes of death, the fastest rate of reduction was seen in pneumonia whose AARR was 10.53%; and the slowest rate reduction was seen in prematurity/low birth weight whose AARR was only 3.62%. Particularly, prematurity/low birth weight increased continuously from 2013 to 2015, with a 44.42%
growth. The similar condition could not be seen in other diseases. As for all causes of death, deaths due to neural tube defects decreased by 98.94% which had the greatest rate reduction; however, deaths due to endocrine, nutritional and metabolic disease had an increasing trend with a growth of 110.70%.

-, disease dropped out of the leading five causes of death in that year. asphyxia had obvious fluctuation whose largest annual rate variation were 76.19%, 90.78% and 389.90% ( Figure   1C ). The main causes of death in children among 1-4 years were tumor (leukemia and other tumor) and accidental death (drowning, traffic accident, accidental asphyxia, accidental poisoning, accidental fall and other accidents) besides pneumonia and congenital heart disease. The cause-specific mortality in these diseases were also fluctuated significantly, but all reduced by varying degrees compared to 1992 ( Figure 1D ).
We 
The AC value and PAC value of residual plots of ARIMA (1, 1, 1) model were all in 95% confidence interval and P>0.05 through BOX-Ljung test. Therefore, the assumption that overall autocorrelation function was zero stood and met the white noise. So, the forecasting model we established was appropriate.
The surveillance data from 1992 to 2013 and from 2014 to 2015 was used to do model internal and external validation. Several studies have revealed an increase in mean maternal age at childbirth in Beijing since the "Selective Two-child Policy" was implemented in 2014. 10, 16 It has been known that advance maternal age was a risk factor of many diseases in under-5 children, such as prematurity and congenital abnormalities. [17] [18] [19] Our study detected that the mortality rates for neonates, infants and under-5 children increased slightly in 2015, with 5.46%, 6.84% and 6.82% growth compared to 2014 and 4.58%, 7.21% and 7.20% growth compared to 2013. What's more, the cause-specific mortality rate of prematurity/low birth weight increased 44.42% during 2013-2015. However, the cause-specific mortality rate of other diseases fluctuated in normal changing interval. Therefore, "Selective Two-child Policy" only made U5MR in Beijing occur a slightly upward trend instead of a boosting which may be the high level of health care and medical treatment reducing the influence of policy in U5MR. In this study, we predicted U5MRs between 2016 and 2020 through the forecasting model we established, 2.88‰, 2.87‰, 2.90‰, 2.97‰ and 3.09‰ respectively, which also indicated U5MR may appear a slightly upward trend in the next five years. So the maternal and child health care work in Beijing still face challenges and more investment and attention should be provided to health facilities involved into this field.
Deaths due to birth asphyxia declined steadily through Beijing intensifying intrapartum monitoring and promotion of neonatal recovery technology. Whereas, birth asphyxia was still the first and second causes of death in 2012 and 2013. There have been several studies verifying that it is closely related to increased maternal age, obesity and diabetes, 20-22 which suggests that maternal education programs targeted at the high risk groups will probably reduce the deaths from birth asphyxia further.
Congenital heart disease has been the first place of death in under-5 children in Beijing since 1998. In 2009, Beijing established a local children congenital heart disease screening and referral network. With the aim of achieving early detection, early diagnosis and early treatment, the network has improved the survival rate and living quality of children with congenital heart disease. In 2010, congenital heart disease dropped to the second cause of death. However, the cause-specific mortality of congenital heart disease in children with 28 days-1 years and 1-4 years fluctuated significantly. They even increased during some years, preventing the U5MR in Beijing from declining further. Several studies have verified that congenital heart disease has several influence factors, such as increased maternal age, prenatal infections, gestational hypertension, gestational diabetes, etc. 18, 23
Therefore, we should provide pre-pregnancy education to avoid gestational hypertension and diabetes and improve prenatal diagnosis rate to adopt measures in advance.
Prematurity/low birth weight continued to be one of the five leading causes of death in children under 5 years of Therefore, Beijing, with severe air pollution, should concern this point to decrease the occurrence of low birth weight.
Pneumonia had the greatest and the fastest reduction rate among the five leading causes of death which contributed to the decreasing U5MR in Beijing greatly. This may be related to the implement of neonatal visit and childhood respiratory infections prevention. 27 The remarkable decrease of mortality caused by neural tube defects was probably due to the increase intake of folic acid supplements among pregnant women in Beijing (One Hundred Achievements Promotion Plan in Ten Years in China). However, deaths due to endocrine, nutritional and metabolic disease had an increasing trend, which increased by 110.70% from 1992 to 2015. It may be relevant to elder parturient and improper feeding, but further studies and effective prevention measures are still needed.
It was worth noting that the trends in mortality rates and the composition of causes of death were significant different in children of different ages. Neonates (<28 days) have been the major group of death in under-5 children, whose proportion was more than 50%. Therefore, the entire condition in trends in mortality rates and the composition of causes of death were significantly influenced by neonates. However, the conditions in children Our study has several advantages. Firstly, the accuracy of this study is very reliable, because our study is an as environment, economy and politics. We have to update data continually to predict further mortality rates.
Beijing has achieved great progress in reducing the mortality rates for under-5 children from 1992 to 2015.
However, U5MR may show a slightly upward trend from 2016 to 2020 as influenced by the "Selective Two-child Owing to the unique regional divisions in Beijing and lack of specific data on each district, we did not analyse the differences between rural and urban areas. 9 in Beijing, has led to a rise in the number of live births and elder parturients. 10 Whether or not policy changes will contribute to an increase in the U5MR remains unknown. Therefore, it is worthwhile to report the health conditions of under-5 children during this period and predict future U5MRs.
The present study aimed to analyse dynamic changes in the U5MR and the distribution of the causes of death in Beijing, China from 1992 to 2015. The study also sought to establish a forecasting model to predict the U5MR for the following five years.
We used the surveillance data between 1992 and 2015 from the Beijing Under-5 mortality rate Surveillance Children in Beijing' and information on deaths was collected from the 'Children's Death Reporting Cards' through a three-level network approach (community/hospital level, district level and municipal level).
Stringent quality control was enforced at all three levels. Maternal and child health care institutions at the district level checks the 'Child Death Reporting Card' within the jurisdiction on a quarterly basis and verifies the cards with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) at the district level. Furthermore, data from 20% of the communities and hospitals were extracted annually for quality control, inspection and investigation of missing reports. Moreover, maternal and child health care institutions at the municipal level checked the cards reported by the district on a quarterly basis, and extracted data collected annually from 20% of the districts to ensure data integrity and accuracy. In addition, data-related staff of local maternal and child health care facilities were trained by specialist groups at regular intervals. The annual live birth under-reporting rate was less than 1% and the under-reporting rate of deaths was less than 0.5% over the last 10 years in Beijing.
The main factor under surveillance was live births. A live birth was defined as a foetus born after 28 weeks of gestation (or with a birth weight >1000 g) with at least one of the following vital signs: heartbeat, breathing, Surveillance Network, no further ethical approval was required for the present study.
We collected data from the 'Child Death Reporting Card' of the surveillance network and information system. 
The total number of deaths in neonates (<28 days), infants (<1 year), and under-5 children was 7,619 (60.75%), 9,836 (78.43%), and 12,541 (100%), respectively. Deaths in neonates accounted for more than 50% of all deaths among under-5 children during the 24 consecutive years under investigation (Figure 1 ). 
There were 35 species of 9 types causes of death for under-5 children under the surveillance in Beijing. Table 2 summarizes mortality rates for the leading causes of death in under-5 children from 1992 to 2015. The five leading causes of death were pneumonia (19.01%), birth asphyxia (13.15%), congenital heart disease (11.66%), preterm/low birth weight (8.53%) and other congenital abnormalities (7.75%) in 1992, in that order; whereas in 2015, this order became preterm/low birth weight (18.41%), congenital heart disease (12.53%), birth asphyxia (10.23%), other congenital abnormalities (8.95%) and pneumonia (7.42%). In particular, pneumonia dropped from 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 The number of deaths due to pneumonia, birth asphyxia, congenital heart disease, preterm/low birth weight and other congenital abnormalities declined by 92.26%, 84.56%, 78.68%, 57.18%, and 77.08%. Among the five leading causes of death during this time period, the fastest rate of decline was observed in pneumonia, the AARR of which was 10.53%; and the slowest rate of decline was observed in preterm/low birth weight, the AARR of which was only 3.62%. In particular, preterm/low birth weight showed a steady overall increase of 44.42% from 2013 to 2015. A similar trend however, was not evident in other diseases. With respect to all causes of death, deaths due to neural tube defects showed a decline by 98.94%, which was the greatest reduction observed; however, deaths due to endocrine, nutritional and metabolic diseases showed an increasing trend by as much as 110.70%. The cause-specific mortality in these diseases also showed significant fluctuations, but were all reduced by varying degrees after 1992 ( Figure 2D ).
We used the U5MR from 1992 to 2013 as the training sample to fit the forecasting model through stabilization, model identification, parameter estimation and model diagnosis. The U5MR in Beijing from 1992 to 2013 showed a non-stationary declining trend with time. After the first notable difference, the sequence chart showed no obvious changes in trend, as confirmed by the unit root test (t=-3.05, P<0.05). Therefore, the difference in order (d) was 1. From Table 3 , the auto correlation function (ACF) and partial autocorrelation function (PACF) charts both showed trailing and declined to 0 after lag 1. Thus, we confirmed that p=1 and q=1. The model was confirmed to be ARIMA (1, 1, 1). The model coefficients were not significantly zero according to the t-test (P<0.05, R 2 =0.982).
The Akaike information criterion (AIC) and Bayes information criterion (BIC) values of the ARIMA (1, 1, 1) model were 2.15 and 2.30, respectively. The results of parameter estimation were incorporated with the general formula of the model to obtain the forecasting model for the under-5 mortality rate as follows:
The autocorrelation (AC) and partial autocorrelation (PAC) values of the residual plots of the ARIMA (1, 1, 1) model were all within the 95% confidence interval (P>0.05) based on the Box-Ljung test. Therefore, the assumption that the overall autocorrelation function was zero stood and met the criteria for white noise. Thus, the forecasting model we established was appropriate.
The surveillance data from 1992-2013 and 2014-2015 was used for internal and external validation of the model. 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 Therefore, given the levels of severe air pollution in Beijing, this should be a major point of concern to reduce the incidence of low birth weight.
Pneumonia showed the greatest and fastest rate of reduction among the five leading causes of death, and this contributed considerably to the reduced U5MR in Beijing. This might be related to the implementation of neonatal visits and the prevention of childhood respiratory infections. 28 The remarkable reduction in mortality caused by neural tube defects was probably due to the increased intake of folic acid supplements among pregnant women in 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 System, which covers all under-5 children in all districts of Beijing. Thus, the present study is not limited by a small sample size, or low coverage rate. Secondly, our study revealed the long-term trends in mortality rates and leading causes of death in under-5 children through a 24-year analysis. Furthermore, we reported the health conditions of under-5 children following the implementation of the 'Selective Two-child Policy' in Beijing in 2014. The results of our study will provide suggestion for the government to assess the present policy and formulate further regulations related to maternal and child health care. However, several limitations should be considered when interpreting our findings. Firstly, because of the unique regional divisions in Beijing and the lack of specific data on each district, we did not analyse the differences between rural and urban areas. Secondly, the ARIMA (1, 1, 1) model forecasts future U5MRs reliably, but only for a short period. This is because the model only considered variations in mortality with time, instead of other possible impacting factors, such as environment, economy and politics. Data must be continually updated to predict further mortality rates. Other model which can predict U5MRs more accuracy and capture its patterns more specific are needed to explore. Thirdly, since we only 
From 1992 to 2015, Beijing has made considerable progress in reducing the mortality rates of under-5 children.
However, the U5MR might show a slight upward trend from 2016 to 2020. The key points for future consideration regarding child health care include the management of birth asphyxia, congenital heart disease, prematurity/low birth weight and other congenital abnormalities. To further reduce the U5MR in Beijing, specific prevention measures should be adopted for children of various age groups. 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46 47 48 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48
