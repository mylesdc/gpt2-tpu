(from December to April) and rainy season (from May to November). Population and district 156 characteristic data (urban vs. rural districts, district population density, district economic indicators 157 (expenditure of district budget, revenues of district budget), district agricultural indicators (number of 158 pigs in herds > 2 months of age by district, % area of district used as rice paddy), district education 159 indicator (number of primary and secondary schools per district)) were obtained from the HCMC 160
Statistical Office [17] . As population figures for those aged <16 years per ward or district was not 161 obtainable, the total population was used to estimate disease incidence. Patient addresses in HCMC were 162 geocoded to districts and wards. City level weekly average climate data during 2005-2010 were obtained 163 from the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment of Vietnam including relative humidity 164 (median=76.5%, range=61.7% to 88%), temperature (median=28.1°C, range=24.4°C to 31.8°C), rainfall 165 (median=24.4mm, range=0mm to 230.7mm) and water level of the Dong Dien River (median=4.93cm, 166 range= -34.43cm to 49.43cm) [18] . 167 168
To reduce variation in the variance of raw incidence estimates due to the variation in population size, 170 ward incidence rates (number of ARI cases per 1,000 ward total population for the whole study period) 171 were smoothed using local empirical Bayes estimates for rates reduced to a neighborhood mean. The 172 neighborhoods were selected using a the neighborhood list based on wards with contiguous boundaries (R 173 package spdep version 0.5-88) [19] . Kulldorff and Nagarwalla's method over the centroids was be used to 174 scan for clusters of diseases [20] . 175 10 0.80, 0.96) and for rural districts (RR for urban vs. rural districts= 1.54; 95% CI = 1.10, 2.15). Other 232 district characteristics were not significantly associated with district ARI incidence. 233 234
The mean of weekly incidence of URIs for the study period was 3.12/1,000 population. Weekly URI 236 incidence showed a relatively small increase through time, with a difference in mean weekly URI 237 incidence at the end and the start of the study period of 0.86 patients per 1,000 population. The basic 238
Poisson GAMM model indicated that URIs admissions in the study hospitals exhibited a significant 239 temporal increasing trend (p<0.0013) and seasonality (p<0.0001) with a peak in May to June and a 240 smaller peak in December to January (Figure 2a) . 241
The mean of weekly LRI incidence for the study period was 4.02/1,000 population. There was a 243 significant increase of weekly LRI incidence over time (p=0.0037) with a substantial difference in the 244 mean weekly LRI incidence at the end vs. the start of the study period of 1.54 patients/1,000 population. 245
The seasonal cycle of LRIs (p<0.0001) was more obvious than that of URIs with a single strong and wide 246 peak annually in the months of September and October (Figure 2b) . 247
In a univariate analysis with Poisson generalized linear model, we found that weekly URI incidence was 249 significantly associated with concurrent weekly average temperature (RR for 1 degree increase of 250 temperature=1.048, 95%CI=1.030-1.066) and humidity (RR for 1% increase in relative humidity=1.006, 251 95%CI= 1.001-1.011). Further, weekly LRI incidence was significantly associated with concurrent 252 weekly average humidity (RR=1.030, 95%CI=1.024-1.036) and rainfall (RR for 1mm increase in 253 rainfall= 1.019, 95%CI=1.014-1.024) ( Figure 3 ). However, after controlling for seasonality, time trend, 254 lags of weekly incidence, concurrent and lags of other climatic covariates in the full GAMM model, the 255 weekly URI incidence was significantly associated with one and two week lags in URI incidence 256 (RR=1.202, 95%CI=1.159-1.245 and RR=1.063, 95%CI=1.019-1.109, respectively), one and three week 257 014 and RR=0.990, 258 respectively), a three week lag in weekly average rainfall (RR=1.006, 95%CI=1.003-1.009) and a four 259
week lag in weekly average river water level (RR for 1 cm increase in water level=1.003, 95%CI=1.002-260 1.005). 261 262 After adjusting for other factors in the full GAMM model, weekly LRI incidence was significantly 263 associated with a one and two week lags in LRI incidence (RR=1.173, 95%CI=1.138-1.208 and 264 RR=1.053, 95%CI=1.015-1.092 respectively), a one week lag in weekly average temperature (RR=0.976, 265 95%CI=0.953-0.998), a one week lag in weekly average rainfall (RR=1.004, 95%CI=1.001-1.007) and a 266 one week lag in weekly average water level (RR=0.998, 95%CI=0.997-1.000) ( Table 2 ). The time trends 267 remained significant for both URIs (p=0.0096) and LRIs (p=0.0345) while only LRIs exhibited 268 significant seasonality (p<0.0001) in the full GAMM models. The full GAMM models fitted the data well 269 for both URIs (adjusted R squared =0.72) and LRIs (adjusted R squared =0.88) (Figure 2 and Figure S3 ). 270
Temporal correlation of weekly incidence was well controlled for URIs and also relatively well controlled 271 for LRIs in the full GAMM models ( Figure S4 ). 272 areas. The increase in hospitalized ARI incidence over time that we observed could also be explained by 285 better healthcare awareness in the population, through better access to tertiary hospitals or a real increase 286 in the incidence of ARIs. The citywide increase of ARI incidence, especially LRI, could also be attributed 287 to the increase of pollution. Pollution was shown to be associated with an increase in LRI incidence by 288 the study of the Collaborative Working Group on Air Pollution, Poverty, and Health in HCMC [25] . 289 290
The weekly incidence of both URIs and LRIs showed significant association with 1 and 2 week lags of 291 incidence indicating that temporal correlation plays an important role in URI and LRI incidence. 292 Furthermore, we additionally noted a difference in seasonal patterns of URIs (two small peaks a year) and 293
LRIs (one strong peak a year) and a difference in association patterns with climatic factors of URIs and 294
LRIs. These findings suggest that climatic factors may differentially influence the pathogens causing 295
URIs and LRIs in HCMC. In addition, the fact that a sharp increase of LRI incidence was observed soon 296 after the peak of URI (May-June) indicate that URIs and LRIs may share some common epidemiological 297 features or LRIs were associated with URI complications or even the pathogens of LRIs infected URI 298 patients. A study conducted at Children Hospital 2 (one of the three study hospitals) investigating viral 299 pathogens associated with ARIs found that the peak of RSV infections occurred in rainy season November in HCMC). This period includes the peak of LRI months and the stronger peak of URIs [10] . 301 Furthermore, RSV is also thought to predispose infected hosts to bacterial infection [26] . Therefore, RSV 302 is likely to be an important pathogen with respect to seasonality and the peaks of URIs and LRIs in this 303 location. As a consequence, appropriate treatment and transmission control for URIs may impact on the 304 incidence of later hospitalization due to LRI. As the peaks of hospitalization for LRI are around 305 September-October, resources for pediatric healthcare should be prepared and local healthcare facilities 306 Our study has limitations as it was derived from routine electronic hospital databases. First, it might not 310 be generalizable for all outpatients, especially for URIs, as many of patients with URI may not be 311 admitted to hospital. The findings for LRIs may be more generalizable as LRIs are more severe than URIs 312 and more likely to be hospitalized. Second, the databases contained limited information with general 313 ICD10 codes and no specific diagnostic information regarding the infecting pathogens. Different 314 pathogens may cause differing URI and LRI disease presentation and different pathogens may be 315 influenced differently by climatic, environmental, population factors as well as host immunity. Therefore, 316 prospective studies investigating different groups of pathogens for ARIs are necessary. 317 318
We found that ARIs accounted for 1/3 of total hospital admission and were the leading cause of 320 hospitalization in children in HCMC, Vietnam. The spatial distribution of hospitalized ARIs was similar 321
to general spatial distribution of other hospitalized diseases with high incidences in the districts 322 surrounding the locations of the three study hospitals and also in districts 2, 7 and Nha Be. The 323 seasonality of ARIs, with strong peak in rainy season, might be explained by the association of ARI 324 incidence with climatic factors (temperature, humidity and rainfall) and the seasonality of RSV infection. 325
The increase of LRI incidence soon after the peak of URIs suggests that URIs and LRIs share common 326 epidemiological pathways or that LRIs are complications of URIs. Understanding the spatial distribution, 327 temporal patterns and climatic risk factors of ARIs should aid health authorities in outbreak preparation 328 and assist in allocating resources for the prevention and control of the diseases, especially in settings 329
where vaccines for viral and bacterial pathogens of ARIs are not routinely available. 330 331 Acknowledgements 332

There were 68,120 URIs (14%) and 87,879 LRIs (19%). The most common diagnoses were 62 acute pharyngitis (28% of all ARI), pneumonia (21%), bronchitis (18%), and bronchiolitis (16%). A 63 significant increasing incidence trend was found for URIs (incidence rate ratio for 1 week increase in time 64
(RR)=1.09, 95%CI=1.02-1.17) and LRIs (RR=1.08, 95%CI=1.006-1.16). The weekly URI incidence 65 peaked in May-June and was significantly associated with lags in weekly URI incidence and the average 66 humidity, rainfall, and water level. The weekly LRI incidence exhibited significant seasonality 67 (p<0.0001), with an annual peak in September-October and was significantly associated with lags in 68 weekly LRI incidence and lags in weekly average temperature, rainfall, and water level. examine the spatial distribution, temporal patterns, and climatic risk factors of pediatric ARIs. 83
• Pediatric ARI admissions were mapped and compared with all other pediatric admissions to 84 assess the spatial distribution of ARI admissions in comparison with the spatial referral pattern of 85 the study hospitals. 86
• Data were stratified in two clinically differentiable groups: upper respiratory infections (URIs) 87 and lower respiratory infections (LRIs) to utilize the general ICD10 codes in the databases. 88
• Our findings were generated using hospitalized patient data and thus might not be generalizable 89 for all outpatients. This may be particularly true for URIs, as many patients with URIs do not 90 require hospitalization. 91
• There was limited data on the specific pathogens associated with ARIs in the databases. URIs and 92 Saharan Africa [5, 6] . In industrializing regions, ARIs in children aged <5 years are generally more 113 severe than in older children and adults, resulting in a higher case-fatality than in industrialized 114 countries [1, 7] . This disparity in mortality rate is multifactorial and associated with differing etiological 115 agents, available therapies, exposure frequencies, and host immunity. There are data to suggest that the incidence of ARIs is associated with specific spatial, meteorological, 127 and socio-demographic risk factors [13] [14] [15] [16] . However, specific temporal and climatic risk factors for 128 both URIs and LRIs in HCMC have not been investigated. Here we aimed to examine the spatial 129 Geographically, it is divided into 24 districts (land areas ranging from 4.18 km 2 -704.22 km 2 ), which are 154 subdivided in 322 smaller administrative wards. There are 5 rural districts (population density ranging 155 The variance of raw ward ARI incidence rates (number of ARI cases per 1,000 ward total population for 183 the whole study period) may largely vary due to the large variation in ward population size in HCMC. To 184 take into account the spatial heterogeneity of variance and any dependence of ARI incidence rates 185 between wards, ward ARI incidence rates were smoothed using local empirical Bayes estimates for rates 186 reduced to a neighborhood mean [19] . The neighborhoods were selected using the neighborhood list 187 to 52)) as cyclic cubic regression splines and the week of the whole study period (Wt=1 to 312)) as cubic 201 regression spline. As weekly ARI incidence may be associated with the ARI incidence and climatic 202 condition of the previous weeks, in addition to the elements in the basic model, the full GAMM model 203 contained lags of ARI weekly incidence up to eight weeks, concurrent climatic condition and lags of 204 climatic condition up to 8 weeks. The performance of the GAMM models was evaluated using adjusted 205 R-squared and model diagnostic plots. Temporal correlation of the model residuals was evaluated by 206 autocorrelation function (ACF) and partial autocorrelation function (PACF). 207 The proportion of males (62%) and females (38%) was comparable between URIs and LRIs. The median 218 age of the patients was 1.5 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 0.7-2.9 years). However, patients with LRIs 219 were significantly younger than those with URIs (median age in years (IQR) = 1.1 (0.5, 2.1) vs. 2.1 (1.1, 220 3.9)), Wilcoxon's test p<0.0001) and LRI patients were hospitalized significantly longer than those with 221 URIs (median days of hospitalization (IQR) = 6.0 (4.0, 9.0) vs. 4.0 (2.0, 5.0), Wilcoxon's test p<0.0001) 222 (Table 1) . 223 224 Overall, the most common diagnoses were acute pharyngitis (28% of all ARIs), pneumonia (21% of all 225 ARIs), bronchitis (18% of all ARIs) and bronchiolitis (16% of all ARIs). Among the URI patients, the 226 majority of patients were diagnosed with acute pharyngitis (63% of all URIs), acute upper respiratory 227 infections of multiple and unspecified sites (14%), acute tonsillitis (8%), acute laryngitis and tracheitis 228 (6%), and acute nasopharyngitis (6%). Among the LRI patients, the most common diagnoses were 229 pneumonia with an unspecified organism (37% of all LRIs), acute bronchitis (32%), acute bronchiolitis 230 (29%), and bacterial pneumonia not elsewhere classified (2%) ( 
The raw ward-level incidence rates of ARIs for the entire study period ranged from zero to 50 per 1,000 236 total population (median (IQR) = 18.8 (14.2, 23 .5)) and the smoothed ward level empirical Bayesian 237 estimated ARI incidence rates ranged from 1.2 to 48.8 ARI cases per 1,000 population (median (IQR) = 238 18.6 (14.7, 23.7)). High incidence rates (>30 cases/1,000 population) of ARI were observed not only in 239 the wards surrounding the three study hospitals (wards in districts 1 and 4 in central HCMC) but also in 240 multiple wards located outside the central region of the city, specifically wards located in districts 2, 7, 241 and Nha Be (observed vs. expected incidence rate ratio >1.4, p<0.0001 using Kulldorff and Nagarwalla's 242 scan) ( Figure 1a) . Notably, the spatial distribution of ARIs and diseases other than ARI were comparable 243 ( Figure 1a and 1b) . We observed an increase with time in ward incidence of ARIs in the majority of the 244 wards with the most apparent high incidences in wards in the south of the city ( Figure S1 ). We 245 additionally found the spatial distribution of URIs and LRIs were comparable ( Figure S2 ). 246
The district level incidence over the entire study period of ARIs was significantly lower in the districts 248 located further away from the hospitals (RR for 2 times increase in distance to hospital = 0.88; 95% CI = 249 0.80, 0.96) and in rural districts (RR for urban vs. rural districts= 1.54; 95% CI = 1.10, 2.15) ( Figure 1a) . 250
Other district characteristics were not significantly associated with district ARI incidence. 251 252
The mean of weekly incidence of URIs for the study period was 3.12/1,000 population. Weekly URI 254 incidence showed a relatively small increase with time, with a difference in mean weekly URI incidence 255 at the end and the start of the study period of 0.86 patients per 1,000 population. The basic Poisson 256 GAMM model indicated that URI admissions in the study hospitals exhibited a significant increasing 257 trend with time (p<0.0013) and seasonality (p<0.0001) with a peak in May to June and a smaller peak in 258
December to January (Figure 2a) . 259 The mean weekly LRI incidence for the study period was 4.02/1,000 population. There was a significant 261 increase of weekly LRI incidence over time (p=0.0037) with a substantial difference in the mean weekly 262 LRI incidence at the end vs. the start of the study period of 1.54 patients/1,000 population. The seasonal 263 cycle of LRIs (p<0.0001) was more obvious than that of URIs, with a single, wide annual peak in the 264 months of September and October (Figure 2b) . 265 266 In a univariate analysis with Poisson generalized linear model, we found that weekly URI incidence was 267 significantly associated with weekly average temperature (RR for 1 degree increase of 268 temperature=1.048, 95%CI=1.030-1.066) and humidity (RR for 1% increase in relative humidity=1.006, 269 95%CI= 1.001-1.011). Further, weekly LRI incidence was significantly associated with weekly average 270 humidity (RR=1.030, 95%CI=1.024-1.036) and rainfall (RR for 1mm increase in rainfall= 1.019, 271 95%CI=1.014-1.024) (Figure 3 ). However, after controlling for seasonality, time trend, lags of weekly 272 incidence, and other climatic covariates in the full GAMM model, the weekly URI incidence was 273 significantly associated with one and two week lags in URI incidence (RR=1. Our study examined the spatial distribution, temporal patterns, and climatic risk factors of ARIs in 292 HCMC, Vietnam. The findings were based on the data of a large number of ARI inpatients retrieved from 293 routinely collected electronic hospital databases over a 6-year period. Our data showed that ARIs 294 accounted for one third of all hospital admissions over the study period and were the most common cause 295 of hospitalized diseases in children in HCMC. The spatial distribution of ARIs was comparable to the 296 spatial referral patterns of study hospitals in HCMC (the spatial distribution of diseases other than ARIs). 297
High incidence of ARIs was found not only in districts close to the study hospitals (districts 1 and 4) but 298 also districts 2, 7, and Nha Be, which are located further away from three study hospitals. This finding is 299 likely a result of urbanization or better economic status of those living in these districts. 300
The observed increase in hospitalized ARI incidence with time may be explained by better healthcare 302 awareness within the population, through better access to tertiary hospitals, better healthcare policies (free 303 healthcare for children aged <6 years was initiated in Vietnam), or a real increase in ARI incidence. The 304 citywide increase of ARI incidence, especially LRIs, may also be attributed to an increase in air pollution. 305
Pollution was shown to be associated with an increase in LRI incidence in study conducted by the 306 Collaborative Working Group on Air Pollution, Poverty, and Health in HCMC [26] . The number of beds 307 in these tertiary hospitals did not increase over the study period, and the policy of these hospitals is to 308 accommodate all patients visiting the hospitals regardless of the capacity of the hospital and staff. An 309 increase in ARI admission indicates an increase in burden for these tertiary hospitals and an increased 310 workload for healthcare, which may impact negatively on the quality of care. Therefore, there should be 311 13 effective policies to improve the allocation of healthcare resources in these hospitals as well as to improve 312 the quality and capacity of local healthcare facilities to share this increasing disease burden. 313
The weekly incidence of both URIs and LRIs showed significant association with 1 and 2 week lags of 315 incidence indicating that temporal correlation might play an important role in URI and LRI incidence. 316 Furthermore, we additionally noted a difference in seasonal patterns of URIs (two small peaks a year) and 317
LRIs (one strong peak a year) and a difference in association patterns with climatic factors of URIs and 318
LRIs. These findings suggested that climatic factors might differentially influence the pathogens causing 319
URIs and LRIs in HCMC. The association of URI incidence with one and three week lags of weekly 320 average humidity was consistent with the association between the seasonality of absolute humidity and 321 influenza-like illness (ILI) in Vietnam as previously reported [27] . In addition, the national surveillance of 322 influenza and ILI in Vietnam during the study period exhibited a similar seasonal pattern with two peaks 323 a year at approximately the same months with the two peaks of URIs in our data [28] . The exceptional 324 high peak of URIs without a concurrent peak of LRIs in 2009 also occurred simultaneously with 2009 325 H1N1. Therefore, influenza and ILI were likely key contributors to the seasonality and the peaks of URIs 326 in our data. Moreover, a study conducted at CH2 investigating viral ARI pathogens found that the peak of 327 RSV infections occurred in rainy season (May-November in HCMC). This period included the peak of 328 LRI months and the larger URI peak [10] . Furthermore, RSV is also thought to predispose infected hosts 329 to bacterial infections [29] . In addition, a sharp increase of LRI incidence was observed soon after the 330 peak of URIs (May-June) suggests that URIs and LRIs share some common epidemiological features. As 331 a consequence, appropriate treatment and transmission control for URIs may impact on the incidence of 332 later hospitalization due to LRIs. As the peaks of hospitalization for LRIs are in September-October, 333 resources for pediatric healthcare should be prepared and local healthcare facilities should be enhanced to 334 share the increase in hospitalization caused by LRIs at tertiary hospitals during this period. 335 336 We found that ARIs accounted for one third of total hospital admission and were the leading cause of 356 hospitalization in children in HCMC, Vietnam. The spatial distribution of hospitalized ARIs was similar 357 to the spatial referral patterns of the study hospitals with high incidences in the districts surrounding the 358 locations of the three study hospitals and also in three districts further out the city. The seasonality of 359 ARIs may be explained by the association of ARI incidence with various climatic factors (temperature, 360 humidity and rainfall) and the seasonality of influenza, ILI, and RSV. The increase of LRI incidence soon 361 after the peak of URIs suggests that URIs and LRIs share common epidemiological factors or LRIs are 362 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 • Pediatric ARI admissions were mapped and compared with all other pediatric admissions to 84 assess the spatial distribution of ARI admissions in comparison with the spatial referral pattern of 85 the study hospitals. 86

LRIs are comprised of various diseases associated with a wide range of pathogens, which may 93 have different spatial temporal patterns. 94 Saharan Africa [5, 6] . In industrializing regions, ARIs in children aged <5 years are generally more 113 severe than in older children and adults, resulting in a higher case-fatality than in industrialized 114 countries [1, 7] . This disparity in mortality rate is multifactorial and associated with differing etiological 115 agents, available therapies, exposure frequencies, and host immunity. The variance of raw ward ARI incidence rates (number of ARI cases per 1,000 ward total population for 182 the whole study period) may largely vary due to the large variation in ward population size in HCMC. To 183 take into account the spatial heterogeneity of variance and any dependence of ARI incidence rates 184 between wards, ward ARI incidence rates were smoothed using local empirical Bayes estimates for rates 185 reduced to a neighborhood mean [19] . The neighborhoods were selected using the neighborhood list 186 8-7 [23,24] . The seasonal cycles and time trends 198 of weekly ARI incidence were evaluated by the basic GAMM models containing the week of year (Ws=1 199 to 52)) as cyclic cubic regression splines and the week of the whole study period (Wt=1 to 312)) as cubic 200 regression spline. As weekly ARI incidence may be associated with the ARI incidence and climatic 201 condition of the previous weeks, in addition to the elements in the basic model, the full GAMM model 202 contained lags of ARI weekly incidence up to eight weeks, concurrent climatic condition and lags of 203 climatic condition up to 8 weeks. The performance of the GAMM models was evaluated using adjusted 204 R-squared and model diagnostic plots. Temporal correlation of the model residuals was evaluated by 205 autocorrelation function (ACF) and partial autocorrelation function (PACF). 206 The proportion of males (62%) and females (38%) was comparable between URIs and LRIs. The median 217 age of the patients was 1.5 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 0.7-2.9 years). However, patients with LRIs 218 were significantly younger than those with URIs (median age in years (IQR) = 1.1 (0.5, 2.1) vs. 2.1 (1.1, 219 3.9)), Wilcoxon's test p<0.0001) and LRI patients were hospitalized significantly longer than those with 220 URIs (median days of hospitalization (IQR) = 6.0 (4.0, 9.0) vs. 4.0 (2.0, 5.0), Wilcoxon's test p<0.0001) 221 (Table 1) . 222 223 Overall, the most common diagnoses were acute pharyngitis (28% of all ARIs), pneumonia (21% of all 224 ARIs), bronchitis (18% of all ARIs) and bronchiolitis (16% of all ARIs). Among the URI patients, the 225 majority of patients were diagnosed with acute pharyngitis (63% of all URIs), acute upper respiratory 226 infections of multiple and unspecified sites (14%), acute tonsillitis (8%), acute laryngitis and tracheitis 227 (6%), and acute nasopharyngitis (6%). Among the LRI patients, the most common diagnoses were 228 pneumonia with an unspecified organism (37% of all LRIs), acute bronchitis (32%), acute bronchiolitis 229 (29%), and bacterial pneumonia not elsewhere classified (2%) ( (14.7, 23.7) ). High incidence rates (>30 cases/1,000 population) of ARI were observed not only in 237 the wards surrounding the three study hospitals (wards in districts 1 and 4 in central HCMC) but also in 238 multiple wards located outside the central region of the city, specifically wards located in districts 2, 7, 239 and Nha Be (observed vs. expected incidence rate ratio >1.4, p<0.0001 using Kulldorff and Nagarwalla's 240 scan) (Figure 1a) . Notably, the spatial distribution of ARIs and diseases other than ARI were comparable 241 ( Figure 1a and 1b) . We observed an increase with time in ward incidence of ARIs in the majority of the 242 wards with the most apparent high incidences in wards in the south of the city ( Figure S1 ). We 243 additionally found the spatial distribution of URIs and LRIs were comparable ( Figure S2 ). 244
The district level incidence over the entire study period of ARIs was significantly lower in the districts 246 located further away from the hospitals (mean district incidence=26.7 per 1,000 population, RR for 2 247 times increase in distance to hospital =0.88, 95% CI=[0.80, 0.96]) and in rural districts (RR for urban vs. 248 rural districts =1.54, 95% CI=[1.10, 2.15]) ( Figure 1a ). Other district characteristics were not significantly 249 associated with district ARI incidence. 250 251
The mean of weekly incidence of URIs for the study period was 3.12/1,000 population. Weekly URI 253 incidence showed a relatively small increase with time, with a difference in mean weekly URI incidence 254 at the end and the start of the study period of 0.86 patients per 1,000 population. The basic Poisson 255 GAMM model indicated that URI admissions in the study hospitals exhibited a significant increasing 256 trend with time (p<0.0013) and seasonality (p<0.0001) with a peak in May to June and a smaller peak in 257
December to January (Figure 2a) . 258 increase of weekly LRI incidence over time (p=0.0037) with a substantial difference in the mean weekly 261 LRI incidence at the end vs. the start of the study period of 1.54 patients/1,000 population. The seasonal 262 cycle of LRIs (p<0.0001) was more obvious than that of URIs, with a single, wide annual peak in the 263 months of September and October (Figure 2b) (Figure 2 and Figure S3 ). Temporal correlation of weekly incidence 288 was well controlled for URIs and also relatively well controlled for LRIs in the full GAMM models 289 ( Figure S4 ). 290 291 Discussion 292
Our study examined the spatial distribution, temporal patterns, and climatic risk factors of ARIs in 293 HCMC, Vietnam. The findings were based on the data of a large number of ARI inpatients retrieved from 294 routinely collected electronic hospital databases over a 6-year period. Our data showed that ARIs 295 accounted for one third of all hospital admissions over the study period and were the most common cause 296 of hospitalized diseases in children in HCMC. The spatial distribution of ARIs was comparable to the 297 spatial referral patterns of study hospitals in HCMC (the spatial distribution of diseases other than ARIs). 298
High incidence of ARIs was found not only in districts close to the study hospitals (districts 1 and 4) but 299 also districts 2, 7, and Nha Be, which are located further away from three study hospitals. This finding is 300 likely a result of urbanization or better economic status of those living in these districts. 301
The observed increase in hospitalized ARI incidence with time may be explained by better healthcare 303 awareness within the population, through better access to tertiary hospitals, better healthcare policies (free 304 healthcare for children aged <6 years was initiated in Vietnam), or a real increase in ARI incidence. The 305 citywide increase of ARI incidence, especially LRIs, may also be attributed to an increase in air pollution.
in these tertiary hospitals did not increase over the study period, and the policy of these hospitals is to 309 accommodate all patients visiting the hospitals regardless of the capacity of the hospital and staff.

Therefore, there should be 312 effective policies to improve the allocation of healthcare resources in these hospitals as well as to improve 313 the quality and capacity of local healthcare facilities to share this increasing disease burden. 314
The weekly incidence of both URIs and LRIs showed significant association with 1 and 2 week lags of 316 incidence indicating that temporal correlation might play an important role in URI and LRI incidence. 317 Furthermore, we additionally noted a difference in seasonal patterns of URIs (two small peaks a year) and 318
LRIs (one strong peak a year) and a difference in association patterns with climatic factors of URIs and 319
LRIs. These findings suggested that climatic factors might differentially influence the pathogens causing 320
URIs and LRIs in HCMC. The association of URI incidence with one and three week lags of weekly 321 average humidity was consistent with the association between the seasonality of absolute humidity and 322 influenza-like illness (ILI) in Vietnam as previously reported [27] . In addition, the national surveillance of 323 influenza and ILI in Vietnam during the study period exhibited a similar seasonal pattern with two peaks 324 a year at approximately the same months with the two peaks of URIs in our data [28] . The exceptional 325 high peak of URIs without a concurrent peak of LRIs in 2009 also occurred simultaneously with 2009 326 H1N1. Therefore, influenza and ILI were likely key contributors to the seasonality and the peaks of URIs 327 in our data. Moreover, a study conducted at CH2 investigating viral ARI pathogens found that the peak of 328 RSV infections occurred in rainy season (May-November in HCMC). This period included the peak of 329 LRI months and the larger URI peak [10] . Furthermore, RSV is also thought to predispose infected hosts 330 to bacterial infections [29] . In addition, a sharp increase of LRI incidence was observed soon after the 331 peak of URIs (May-June) suggests that URIs and LRIs share some common epidemiological features. As 332 a consequence, appropriate treatment and transmission control for URIs may impact on the incidence of 333 later hospitalization due to LRIs. As the peaks of hospitalization for LRIs are in September-October, 334 resources for pediatric healthcare should be prepared and local healthcare facilities should be enhanced to 335 share the increase in hospitalization caused by LRIs at tertiary hospitals during this period. 336 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 A large proportion of ARI admissions in these data were URIs, two third of these were diagnosed with 338 acute pharyngitis. These conditions can usually be treated in outpatient settings and do not typically 339 require hospitalization. However, the decision to hospitalize ARI patients in these tertiary hospitals is not 340 strictly based on the WHO Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) guidelines and is also 341 dependent on the preferences of caregivers and the subjective patient evaluation of the attending 342 physicians. Therefore, there should stricter policies for applying IMCI guidelines and other clinical 343 criteria to reduce unnecessary URI admissions in these hospitals, as well as to improving outpatient care 344 and follow up. 345
Our study has limitations as the findings were generated using routine data of from hospitalized patients. 347
Therefore, are finding may be generalizable for outpatients, especially for URIs, as many patients with 348 URI may not be admitted to hospital. The findings for LRIs may be more generalizable as LRIs are more 349 severe than URIs and more likely to be hospitalized. Second, the databases contained mostly general 350 ICD10 codes and very limited specific diagnostic information regarding the ARI pathogens. Different 351 pathogens can cause differing URI and LRI disease presentations and different pathogens may be 352 influenced differently by climatic, environmental, population factors as well as host immunity. Therefore, 353 further surveillance and studies investigating different groups of pathogens for ARIs are necessary. 354 355
We found that ARIs accounted for one third of total hospital admission and were the leading cause of 357 hospitalization in children in HCMC, Vietnam. The spatial distribution of hospitalized ARIs was similar 358 to the spatial referral patterns of the study hospitals with high incidences in the districts surrounding the 359 locations of the three study hospitals and also in three districts further out the city. The seasonality of 360 ARIs may be explained by the association of ARI incidence with various climatic factors (temperature, 361 humidity and rainfall) and the seasonality of influenza, ILI, and RSV.
