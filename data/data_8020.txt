: Read statistics. Read counts and assembly/mapping statistics for all 18 HiSeq samples and the additional MiSeq library for R. aegyptiacus. We mapped all corresponding samples to the H. sapiens and R. aegyptiacus genome with TopHat and segemehl. Additionally, we build de novo transcriptome assemblies for both species. For R. aegyptiacus, a de novo transcriptome assembly was computed based on the HiSeq and pooled MiSeq reads. MiSeq data was assembled with Mira only. For each assembly tool, the number of contigs (>= 0 bp, >= 1000 bp) and the N50 value are listed. For TopHat and segemehl, overall read mapping statistics are provided. A large amount of reads in the EBOV 23 h sample mapped to the EBOV genome. Detailed statistics can be found in the electronic supplement.
HuH7 ( Table 2 : Number of reads mapping to the viral genomes. For R06E-J samples, we used Blastn+ to find contigs within the R. aegyptiacus transcriptome assembly which represent the full EBOV (contig610) and MARV (contig5818) genome, respectively. Read counts were normalized by library size. Read maximum peaks were calculated for each sample. Interestingly, EBOV seems to replicate much faster in human cells compared to bat cells between 3 and 7 h (15.6X). However, EBOV decreases its transcription speed again in the following 16 h (15.5X) (see Fig. 1B and Fig. 3 in the manuscript). Similarly, MARV replicates faster between 3 and 7 h in human cells (7.6X) than bat cells ( Supplementary Table 3 : Comparison of genome and de novo transcriptome assemblies. From the genomic sequences of H. sapiens and R. aegyptiacus we selected different sets of expressed genes using various filter thresholds: 1) we selected transcripts from the genome with at least N ∈ {100, 1000, 5000} unique mapped reads in one sample (= ∃) or 2) accumulated all unqiue mapped reads over all samples (= ∀). The selected transcript sets were further blasted against the corresponding de novo transcriptome assembly of human and bat, respectively. We defined a transcript (derived from the genomic sequence) as true positive and therefore correctly assembled, if we got at least one blast hit with an alignment length > 90%. Table 4 : Differential gene expression. Differential expression levels of NCBI-annotated proteincoding genes and ncRNAs, de novo Cufflinks-predicted genes, and hand-selected genes of interest from the literature. From the 2 364 de novo gene loci showing differential expression, 92 % could be mapped back to already annotated genes (hg19 annotations). Thus, we detected 189 (8 %) unannotated gene loci with significant differential expression. DEG -differential expressed genes ((padj) < 0.1); FC -mean fold change of differential expressed genes (top 300 and all) calculated with DESeq (padj < 0.1); for each gene the maximum fold change obtained over all combinations of time points and infections was used. Table 6 : Top 10 differences between EBOV/Mock, MARV/Mock and EBOV/MARV in human cells. Genes with highest differential expression between Mock samples and EBOV-and MARV-infected samples, respectively. In addition, genes with the highest differential expression between EBOV-and MARV-infected samples are summarized. By manual inspection, we found CXCL8 , AKR1B10 and AKR1B15 to play rather a minor role, since we determined only low level transcription and mapping artifacts (AKR1B10 and AKR1B15 are located next to each other, reads were mapped twice). AMOTL2 is part of the MAPK signalling pathway (see electronic supplement). LOC100507347 refers to a protein with unknown function (also described as BC078172). Abbreviations as in STab. 5. Supplementary Table 11 : Expression of genes involved in IFN-induction and -signaling. The IFN signaling pathway and the induced antiviral effector proteins are important antiviral defence mechanisms 1 . We checked the expression of genes involved in IFN signal transduction, immune/antiviral response and ISGylation for differential expression during EBOV and MARV infection. We found many genes to be not expressed (IFIH1, IRF7, GBP1, IFI16,  IFI27, IFI35, IFI44, IFI44L, IFIITM1, IFITM2, OAS1, OAS2, Ozato et al. 2 . They represent a superfamily of tripartite motif-containing proteins with more than 60 members from which several are known to be required for the restriction of lentivirus infections. Based on their emerging role in innate immunity, we investigated their features. We identified at least 11 TRIM genes (TRIM2, 6, 8, 15, 16L, 25, 32, 34, 38, 45, 47, 54, 67, 71 )
