Setting: International sporting event (participants/spectators from Canada, China, Taiwan, Curacao, Japan, Netherlands, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, United States, and Venezuela) State: Pennsylvania Size of gathering: 265,000 (including 471 participants and staff) Approximate dates: August 17 to August 26, 2007 Disease information Etiology: Measles (virus) Mode of transmission: Person-to-Person Number of case-patients: 7 (including index case, all laboratory confirmed), 1 exposed to index case in Japan, 2 co-workers at Detroit airport, and 1 exposed to index case at sporting event, and leading to second generation of 2 cases in Texas. Onset date of index case: August 15, 2007 (rash onset -infected in Japan) Hospitalizations: 1 Age of case-patients: 12 to 53 years Attack rate: Unknown
International importation of infectious case-patient (unvaccinated participant from Japan) Transmission during airline-travel and in shared participant housing Low measles vaccination coverage among participants and staff 4) Chen TH, et al. [19] (same outbreak as above). Type of report/study: Outbreak investigation-case report 
Etiology: Measles (virus) Mode of transmission: Person-to-Person Number of case-patients: 7 (including index case, all laboratory confirmed), 1 exposed to index case in Japan, 2 co-workers at Detroit airport, and 1 exposed to index case at sporting event, and leading to second generation of 2 cases in Texas. Major factors contributing to outbreak Close social mixing and contact in communal housing (cabins) and during camp activities. Case-patients with Oseltamivir resistant infection were cabin mates -either due to transmission of resistant virus from one case-patient to another, transmission to both case-patients from a 3 rd unidentified person with resistant infection, or independent mutation in both case-patients resulting in Oseltamivir resistance (possibly due to sub-therapeutic dose when symptomatic). -Cluster 1 = 60 (across 3 camps), 4 additional case-patients identified but not epidemiologically linked to cluster (June 15 to July 2). Of 64, 27 were laboratory confirmed.
-Cluster 2 = 47, 8 additional case-patients identified but not linked to other case-patients (July 13 to July 24). Of 55, 40 were laboratory confirmed. Onset date of index case: Cluster 1 = June 14, Cluster 2 = July 13 Age of case-patients: 9 to 68 years Attack rate: Among participants in Cluster 1 = 14.9%, among participants in Cluster 2 = 15%
Major factors contributing to outbreak Close social mixing and contact in communal housing and during camp activities (prolonged close contact in and out of the classroom during academic camps, transmission linked to social interactions outside of class and housing) Delay in seeking medical attention early after symptom onset Implementation of infection control activities at may be insufficient to control influenza transmission at large university-based camp 13) Tsalik EL, et al.
[28] (same outbreak as above).
Mass gathering Setting: University-based camp(s) State: North Carolina Size of gathering: 7,906 participants in 73 residential camps (academic, athletic, and single social reunion) across 3 campuses Approximate dates: May 2 -August 2009 (camps ranging from 3 to 73 days in duration)
Etiology: Pandemic Influenza A H1N1 (virus) Mode of transmission: Person-to-Person Number of case-patients: Total = 119 -Cluster 1 = 60 (across 3 camps), 4 additional case-patients identified but not epidemiologically linked to cluster (June 15 to July 2). Of 64, 27 were laboratory confirmed. -Cluster 2 = 47, 8 additional case-patients identified but not linked to other case-patients (July 13 to July 24). Of 55, 40 were laboratory confirmed. Onset date of index case: Cluster 1 = June 14, Cluster 2 = July 13 Age of case-patients: 9 to 68 years Attack rate: Among participants in Cluster 1 = 14.9%, among participants in Cluster 2 = 15%
