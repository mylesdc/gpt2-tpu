. Verifica*on of siRNA knockdown experiments using addi*onal siRNAs. (A) Knockdown efficiency of two different ISG15 siRNAs. A549 cells were transfected with 10nM of either control (ctrl) siRNA or the indicated ISG15 siRNA, followed by 24hour treatment with 1000IU/ml human IFN-β. Cell extracts were analyzed by immunoblots with the indicated Abs. ISG15 #1 siRNA is the siRNA used for the knockdown experiments described in the text. (B) ISG15 knockdown using ISG15 siRNA#2, like ISG15 siRNA#1, rescued the replica*on of 67 mutant virus (C) Knockdown efficiency of two different USP18 siRNAs as assayed by USP18 immunoblots of siRNA-transfected, IFN-treated A549 cells. USP18 siRNA #1 was used.in the experiments described in the text (D) USP18 siRNA #2, like USP18 siRNA#1, enhanced ISGyla*on and inhibited HA and NP protein produc*on in 67 mutant-infected cells. Related to Figures 1 and 4. 
ISGyla'on occurs only when IFN-β treatment precedes influenza B virus infec'on. (A) A549 cells were treated with1000IU/ml of human IFNβ for 12 hours or were not treated with IFN. Cells were then either mock infected, or infected with 5 pfu/cell of wt virus. Cell extracts isolated at 24 hours aPer infec'on or mock infec'on were analyzed by immunoblots probed with the indicated Abs. (B) Both wt and 67 mutant viruses inhibit IFN-induced synthesis of UbcH8. A549 cells were infected with 5 pfu/cell of wt or 67 mutant virus, or mock infected. At 6 hours aPer infec'on the cultural medium were replaced with fresh medium containing 1000IU/ml of human IFN-β. Cell extracts isolated at 24 hours aPer infec'on or mock infec'on were analyzed by immunoblots probed with the indicated Abs. Related to Figure 1 . A549 cells were transfected with USP18 siRNA for 24hrs, followed by 16 hours of treatment with 1000IU/ml human IFN-β and subsequently infected with 5 pfu/cell of wt or 67 mutant virus. At 24 hours aOer infecPon, cells were collected, and the levels of NP mRNA, NS1B mRNA, NP vRNA, and NS vRNA were determined by RT-PCR, normalized to the level of β-acPn mRNA. The raPos of the levels of these RNAs in 67-infected cells to the levels in wt-infected cells are shown. Results shown are mean +/-standard deviaPon of three independent experiments, with each measurement performed in triplicate. P values were calculated using 2-way ANOVA test. *** P< 0.001, * P<0.05, ns P>0.05. A likely explanaPon for these results stems from the fact that NS1B mRNA, like the NS1A mRNA of influenza A virus, is synthesized predominantly at early Pmes of infecPon. Experiments with influenza A virus has established that the early synthesis of NS1A mRNA is coupled with the early synthesis of NS vRNA, the template for the transcripPon of NS1A mRNA 1,2 . It is likely that this is also the case for NS1B mRNA and NS vRNA of influenza B virus. Consequently, a substanPal amount of NS vRNA synthesis probably occurs prior to the Pme that ISGylaPon of NP results in the most effecPve inhibiPon of vRNA synthesis, resulPng in lible or no inhibiPon of NS1B mRNA. In human cells infected with wt influenza B virus, the NS1B protein does not block the ISGyla+on process per se. The viral NP protein is thus ISGylated. However, the ISGylated NP proteins are not func+onal as they are bound and sequestered by the NS1B protein in the cytoplasm. When NS1B sequestra+on is eliminated, as demonstrated in the case of the 67 mutant virus, the ISGyla+ed NP proteins are free to enter the nucleus, where they terminate the oligomeriza+on of NP molecules that lack ISG15 modifica+ons, resul+ng in incomplete NP oligomers containing ISGylated NP. As a result, ISGylated NP inhibits the forma+on of viral RNPs that catalyze viral RNA synthesis.
