Two new asteltoxins named asteltoxin E (2) and F (3), and a new chromone (4), together with four known compounds were isolated from a marine sponge-derived fungus, Aspergillus sp. SCSIO XWS02F40. The structures of the compounds (1-7) were determined by the extensive 1D-and 2D-NMR spectra, and HRESIMS spectrometry. All the compounds were tested for their antiviral (H1N1 and H3N2) activity. Compounds 2 and 3 showed significant activity against H3N2 with the prominent IC 50 values of 6.2˘0.08 and 8.9˘0.3 µM, respectively. In addition, compound 2 also exhibited inhibitory activity against H1N1 with an IC 50 value of 3.5˘1.3 µM.
In 2015, viral pathogenesis became an intriguing hot topic among human society. This is exemplified by the recent Ebola virus outbreak in Western Africa and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in South Korea [1] . Meanwhile, influenza viruses are still a great threat to human health [2, 3] . So far, only two classes of antiviral drugs, which include amantadine and the neuraminidase inhibitors, are currently used as anti-influenza therapeutic drugs, but both of them have some adverse side effects in humans as well as the resistance of the virus towards this drug [4, 5] . Hence, a concerted effort is aimed at discovering new antiviral agents to treat and eradicate these infectious agents [6, 7] .
Marine sponge-derived fungus tends to produce structurally unique and biologically active natural products which have been documented in recent years; however, only a handful of reports have described new metabolites which have antiviral activities [7, 8] . To further the scope of this particular research theme, a fungus, Aspergillus sp. SCSIO XWS02F40, attracted our attention because its crude EtOAc extract exhibited potential antiviral activity. Further isolation yielded three new compounds: asteltoxin E (2), asteltoxin F (3) and 7-hydroxy-2-(2-hydroxypropyl)-5-pentylchro mone (4), together with four known compounds: asteltoxin (1) [9] , sterigmatocystin (5) [10, 11] , dihydrosterigmatocystin (4), together with four known compounds: asteltoxin (1) [9] , sterigmatocystin (5) [10, 11] , dihydrosterigmatocystin (6) [11, 12] , diorcinol (7) [13, 14] (Figure 1 ). The antiviral (H1N1 and H3N2) activities of these compounds were individually evaluated. Herein, we described the isolation, structural elucidation, and bioactivity screening of these metabolites 1-7 from Aspergillus sp. SCSIO XWS02F40. 
Compound 2 was obtained as a yellow amorphous solid. The molecular formula of 2 was established as C28H36O9 by the HRESIMS data (m/z 517.2440 [M + H] + ), requiring 11 degrees of unsaturations. The UV spectrum showed maxima at 356, 300, 267, 211 nm, indicating the presence of an extended conjugated moiety. The IR spectrum exhibited absorptions for a hydroxy group at 3390 cm −1 and an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl group at 1697 cm −1 [15] . Close inspection of the 1 H-and 13 C-NMR spectra (Table 1 , Figures S1 and S2) of 2 using DEPT and 1 H-13 C correlation spectroscopy (HSQC) revealed the presence of six methyls (one oxygenated), two methylenes including one oxygen-bearing, 12 methines including three oxygenated methines, one double oxygenated methine (δH 5.27, δC 111.9) and eight olefinic methines ,as well as two sp 3 quaternary carbons (one oxygenated), four sp 2 quaternary carbons, including two oxygenated carbons (δC 154.7, 169.5) and two ester carbonyls (δC 163.7, 167.5). Comparing UV-vis and NMR data of compound 2 with those of asteltoxin (1) [9, 16, 17] revealed a high degree of similarity and a difference in the substituents of C-17. HMBC correlations observed from H3-28/C-24, C-25, C-26, H3-23/C-24 and H2-27/C-24, C-25, C-26 indicated the existence of a methyl crotonate moiety. In addition to this, the HMBC correlation of H2-27/C-17 and the chemical shift values of C-17 (δC 169.5) and C-27 (δC 65.9) suggested that C-27 was linked with C-17 through an oxygen bridge. Based on these analyses, the planar structure of 2 was determined to be as shown in Figure 2 .
The relative stereochemistry of (2) was deduced from NOESY correlations as shown in Figure 3 . The double-bond geometry of the C-25/C-26 of substituent was deduced from the NOESY correlations of H3-28/H2-27 and H-26/H3-23, which suggested E-configurations. The NOESY correlations of H-6/H3-21 revealed the cis fusion of the 2,8-dioxabi cyclo [3.3 .0] octane. The NOESY correlations from H-6 to H-8; H-7 to H-8, H3-21 suggested that H-6, H-7, H-8 and H3-21 are positioned on the same side. The NOESY correlation of H-7/H3-20, as well as the lack of NOESY correlation between H3-20/H3-21, indicated that 4-OH was an α-configuration. The NOESY correlation of H3-20/H-3 indicated that the ethyl group at C-3 was in the α-configuration. So, the relative configuration of 2 would be identical with that of an asteltoxin and named asteltoxin E [18] . 
Compound 2 was obtained as a yellow amorphous solid. The molecular formula of 2 was established as C 28 H 36 O 9 by the HRESIMS data (m/z 517.2440 [M + H] + ), requiring 11 degrees of unsaturations. The UV spectrum showed maxima at 356, 300, 267, 211 nm, indicating the presence of an extended conjugated moiety. The IR spectrum exhibited absorptions for a hydroxy group at 3390 cm´1 and an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl group at 1697 cm´1 [15] . Close inspection of the 1 H-and 13 C-NMR spectra (Table 1 , Figures S1 and S2) of 2 using DEPT and 1 H-13 C correlation spectroscopy (HSQC) revealed the presence of six methyls (one oxygenated), two methylenes including one oxygen-bearing, 12 methines including three oxygenated methines, one double oxygenated methine (δ H 5.27, δ C 111.9) and eight olefinic methines ,as well as two sp 3 quaternary carbons (one oxygenated), four sp 2 quaternary carbons, including two oxygenated carbons (δ C 154.7, 169.5) and two ester carbonyls (δ C 163.7, 167.5). Comparing UV-vis and NMR data of compound 2 with those of asteltoxin (1) [9, 16, 17] revealed a high degree of similarity and a difference in the substituents of C-17. HMBC correlations observed from H 3 -28/C-24, C-25, C-26, H 3 -23/C-24 and H 2 -27/C-24, C-25, C-26 indicated the existence of a methyl crotonate moiety. In addition to this, the HMBC correlation of H 2 -27/C-17 and the chemical shift values of C-17 (δ C 169.5) and C-27 (δ C 65.9) suggested that C-27 was linked with C-17 through an oxygen bridge. Based on these analyses, the planar structure of 2 was determined to be as shown in Figure 2 .
The relative stereochemistry of (2) was deduced from NOESY correlations as shown in Figure 3 . The NOESY correlation of H-7/H 3 -20, as well as the lack of NOESY correlation between H 3 -20/H 3 -21, indicated that 4-OH was an α-configuration. The NOESY correlation of H 3 -20/H-3 indicated that the ethyl group at C-3 was in the α-configuration. So, the relative configuration of 2 would be identical with that of an asteltoxin and named asteltoxin E [18] . The molecular formula of compound 3 was determined as C 27 H 34 O 9 by its HRESIMS ion peak (m/z 503.2279 [M + H] + ), which corresponded to 11 units of unsaturations. A comparison of UV-vis and NMR data with those of 2 revealed that compound 3 also was an analogue of asteltoxin. The only difference was the absence of methylene between C-1 and C-3. This was proved by the HMBC spectrum showing correlation of H 3 -1 with C-3, C-4 and the splitting pattern of H 3 -1 (δ H 1.17, d, J = 6.0 Hz) and H-3 (δ H 4.57, q, J = 6.0 Hz). Based on the NOESY experiments, the relative configuration of 3 was also suggested to be analogous to that of an asteltoxin and named asteltoxin F [18] .
Compound 4 was obtained as needle crystal. The molecular formula of 4 was established as C 17 [19, 20] . The 1 H-NMR spectrum showed 20 proton signals, two sp 3 aliphatic methy protons (δ H 0.86 and 1.15), five sp 3 methylene protons (δ H 1.29, 1.29, 1.48, 2.57 and 3.08), one oxymethine proton (δ H 4.03), and three sp 2 methine protons (δ H 5.95, 6.59 and 6.62). The 13 C-NMR spectra showed 17 signals, comprising two methyls, five methylenes, four methines and six quaternary carbon atoms. Accounting for five of the seven degrees of unsaturation suggested the presence of two rings. The 1 H-and 13 C-NMR spectroscopic data of compound 4 indicate that it is a chromone analogue. The only difference from 5-carbomethoxy methyl-2 heptyl-7-hydroxy chromone was the substituent of C-5 [21] . In addition, the HMBC correlation of H 3 -14/C-5, C-6 and C-10 suggested that the pentyl was located at C-5 ( Figure 4 and Table 2 ). The molecular formula of compound 3 was determined as C27H34O9 by its HRESIMS ion peak (m/z 503.2279 [M + H] + ), which corresponded to 11 units of unsaturations. A comparison of UV-vis and NMR data with those of 2 revealed that compound 3 also was an analogue of asteltoxin. The only difference was the absence of methylene between C-1 and C-3. This was proved by the HMBC spectrum showing correlation of H3-1 with C-3, C-4 and the splitting pattern of H3-1 (δH 1.17, d, J = 6.0 Hz) and H-3 (δH 4.57, q, J = 6.0 Hz). Based on the NOESY experiments, the relative configuration of 3 was also suggested to be analogous to that of an asteltoxin and named asteltoxin F [18] .
Compound 4 was obtained as needle crystal. The molecular formula of 4 was established as C17H22O4 by the HRESIMS ion peak at m /z 291.1588 [M + H] + (calculated for C17H23O4, 291.1591) requiring seven degrees of unsaturation. The strong absorptions in the IR spectrum at 3354 and 1628 cm -1 showed the existence of a hydroxy group and a carbonyl group [19, 20] . The 1 H-NMR spectrum showed 20 proton signals, two sp 3 aliphatic methy protons (δH 0.86 and 1.15), five sp 3 methylene protons (δH 1.29, 1.29, 1.48, 2.57 and 3.08), one oxymethine proton (δH 4.03), and three sp 2 methine protons (δH 5.95, 6.59 and 6.62). The 13 C-NMR spectra showed 17 signals, comprising two methyls, five methylenes, four methines and six quaternary carbon atoms. Accounting for five of the seven degrees of unsaturation suggested the presence of two rings. The 1 H-and 13 C-NMR spectroscopic data of compound 4 indicate that it is a chromone analogue. The only difference from 5-carbomethoxy methyl-2 heptyl-7-hydroxy chromone was the substituent of C-5 [21] . The 1 H-1 H COSY correlation of H2-14/H2-15, H2-17/H3-18 and HMBC correlations of H3-18/C-16 and C-17, H2-15/C-16 and C-17 indicated the presence of a pentyl moiety. In addition, the HMBC correlation of H3-14/C-5, C-6 and C-10 suggested that the pentyl was located at C-5 ( Figure 4 and Table 2 ). The absolute configuration of C-12 was established by comparison of the optical rotation of compound 4 rαs 25 D = +17.11 (c 0.31, MeOH) with that of 7-Hydroxy-2-(2-hydroxypropyl)-5-methyl chromone: rαs 25 D = +32 (c 0.02, MeOH) [21, 22] . Thus, this establishes the absolute configuration of C-12 to be S. Thus, the structure of compound 4 was determined and named as 7-hydroxy-2-(2-hydroxypropyl)-5-pentylchromone.
The antiviral (H1N1 and H3N2) activities of these compounds were individually evaluated through Cytopathic Effect (CPE) inhibition assay. Compounds 2 and 3 showed significant inhibitory activities against the H3N2 strain with the prominent IC 50 values of 6.2˘0.08 and 8.9˘0.3 µM, respectively. In addition, compound 2 also exhibited significant activity against the H1N1 strain with an IC 50 value of 3.5˘1.3 µM.
The fungal strain SCSIO XWS02F40, which was isolated from a sponge Callyspongia sp. collected from the sea area near Xuwen County, Guangdong Province, China, exhibited potential antiviral activity in our previous screening tests. After seven days of growth on MB (Malt Extract Agar Base) medium at 25˝C, colonies were 15 mm to 20 mm in diameter, showed good sporulation, and were light green, whereas the color of the reverse was the same as that of the surface ( Figure 5B ). Light microscopy revealed that the stipes were erecting hyphae. Spherical expansion (vesicles) were formed at the end of the stipes, on which there were green conidial chains. A teleomorphic state was not observed ( Figure 5C,D) .
The ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 sequence region (524 base pairs (bp), accession number KT164776) of strain SCSIO XWS02F40 was amplified by PCR and sequenced. A phylogenetic tree was procured by the neighbor-joining method as per a similarity based off a 510-bp consensus length of the ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 sequence ( Figure 6 ). Strain SCSIO XWS02F40 was found to belong to a clade related to A. austroafricanus NRRL 233 (accession number JQ301891), with a sequence identity of 99.4%. On the basis of its properties of culture and morphology, and ITS phylogenetic analysis, strain SCSIO XWS02F40 was identified as a member of the Aspergillus genus, and was named as Aspergillus sp. SCSIO XWS02F40. [21, 22] . Thus, this establishes the absolute configuration of C-12 to be S. Thus, the structure of compound 4 was determined and named as 7-hydroxy-2-(2hydroxypropyl)-5-pentylchromone.
The antiviral (H1N1 and H3N2) activities of these compounds were individually evaluated through Cytopathic Effect (CPE) inhibition assay. Compounds 2 and 3 showed significant inhibitory activities against the H3N2 strain with the prominent IC50 values of 6.2 ± 0.08 and 8.9 ± 0.3 μM, respectively. In addition, compound 2 also exhibited significant activity against the H1N1 strain with an IC50 value of 3.5 ± 1.3 μM.

Aspergillus sp. was cultured on MB-agar plates at 25˝C for seven days. The seed medium consisted of malt extract: 15 g, sea salt: 10 g, distilled water: 1000 mL, pH 7.4-7.8, and was inoculated with strain SCSIO XWS02F40 and incubated at 25˝C for 72 h on a rotating shaker (170 rpm). Mass scale fermentation of fungal isolate SCSIO XWS02F40 was carried out using solid rice medium in 1000 mL flasks (rice: 200 g, sea salt: 2.5 g, distilled water: 200 mL), and inoculated with 10 mL of seed solution. Flasks were incubated at 25˝C under normal day-night cycle. After 30 days, cultures from 30 flasks were harvested and subjected for organic extraction using Ethyl acetate (EtOAc). The EtOAc extracts of rice solid media of Aspergillus sp. SCSIO XWS02F40 were partitioned between petroleum ether, and 90% aqueous MeOH, The resulting MeOH phase was fractionated using silica column, Sephadex LH-20, and then semi-preparative reversed-phase HPLC to yield compounds 1-7 (Figure 1 ).
The culture of solid rice medium was soaked in acetone and cut into small pieces and kept for 1 day. The content was filtered and evaporated under vacuum using a Buchner funnel and extracted with EtOAc until exhaustion and this process was repeated thrice. The organic phase was collected and evaporated to obtain a dark brown oil crude extract (60.5 g). The crude EtOAc extract was subjected to silica gel column chromatography (CC) eluted with petroleum ether/ EtOAc in a gradient eluent (v/v, 50:1, 30:1, 20:1, 10:1, 5:1, 1:1, 0:1) to obtain 10 fractions (fractions 1-10) on the basis of TLC.

The antiviral activities against H1N1 and H3N2 were evaluated by the CPE inhibition assay in duplicate assay [23] . Confluent MDCK cell monolayers were firstly incubated with influenza virus at 37˝C for 1 h. After removing the virus dilution, cells were maintained in infecting media (RPMI 1640, 4 µg/mL of trypsin) containing different concentrations of test compounds. After 48 h incubation at 37˝C, the cells were fixed with 100 µL of 4% formaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature. After removal of the formaldehyde, the cells were stained with 0.1% crystal violet for 30 min. The plates were washed and dried, and the intensity of crystal violet staining for each well was measured in a microplate reader (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) at 570 nm. The IC 50 was calculated as the compounds concentration required to inhibit influenza virus yield at 48 h post-infection by 50%. Oseltamivir was used as the positive control with IC 50 values of 18.5 and 16.9 nM, respectively.
In conclusion, three new compounds, Asteltoxin E (2), Asteltoxin F (3) and 7-hydroxy-2-(2-hydroxypropyl)-5-pentyl chromone (4), together with four known compounds were isolated from a marine sponge-derived fungus, Aspergillus sp.
