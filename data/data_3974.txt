This close proximity may induce severe steric clashes causing the large loss of potency observed for 107 HsLTA4H inhibition. The active site residues are represented in line and the zinc ion is shown as grey 108 sphere. The key residues involved in HsLTA4H's S1 subsite modulation were represented in stick.
Images generated with PyMOL. 
The catalytic zinc ion is shown as grey sphere. Residues involved in S1' plasticity are 121 shown in stick. In blue, residues which reduce the cavity width; in red, residues which 122 modulate the cavity depth. Images generated with KVFinder plugin in PyMOL. 
PDB 4FYR (cyan, cavity volume 811.87 Ã… 3 ). In the "Phe-In" conformation, Phe896 is oriented into the 135 active site inducing a partial closing of the S1 subsite. The active site cavity was computed by
KVFinder. The flexible 891-998 loop was represented in cartoon and the key Phe896 residue involved 137 in S1 subsite modulation was represented in stick.
