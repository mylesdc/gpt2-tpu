The viral-infected cells were exposed to compounds 11, 12, 13, and 14 (20 µM) and 107 ribavirin (20 µM) as a positive control. After 1 day of incubation, the cell lysates were 108 collected and target proteins were measured using Western blotting method. Equal amounts 109 of proteins were loaded on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. After transferred to PVDF 110 membranes, they were firstly incubated with neuraminidase antibody overnight. For 111 removing bound primary and secondary antibodies, the membranes were incubated with a 112
Restore TM Western blot stripping buffer (Thermo Sci.) and they were then detected the β-113 actin protein using a LAS4000 luminescent image analyzer. Sample names were from 1-7 114 as follows: uninfected ctrl, viral-infected (vi) ctrl, vi + ribavirin (20 µM), vi + 11, 12, 13, 115 and 14 (20 µM), respectively. Data were included in the final analysis in Figure 4A . 116 Figure S179 . Inhibitory effects of compound 12 on the viral proteins synthesis in a 118 concentration-dependent manner; original uncropped blots. 119
The procedure of Western blot experiment was successfully carried as above described in 120 Figure S18 . The membranes were firstly detected neuraminidase or hemagglutinin proteins. 121
