Dynamics of the seasonal airborne propagation of Staphylococcus aureus in academic dental clinics Objective: Staphylococcus aureus strains can be disseminated during dental treatments and occasionally lead to the contamination and infection of patients and dentists, which is an important public health problem. The dynamics of the airborne propagation and the genetic diversity of S. aureus isolated in an academic dental clinic environment were investigated using isoenzyme typing. Material and Methods: The isoenzymes of 44 previously reported isolates were obtained from fresh cultures and extracted using glass beads. Nine isoenzymes were investigated using multilocus enzyme electrophoresis (MLEE). The genetic diversity and relationship among the strains (electrophoretic type -ET) were determined using statistics previously described by Nei 25 (1972) and the SAHN grouping method (UPGMA algorithm). Results: Clonal pattern analyses indicated a high level of genetic polymorphism occurring among the 33 ETs, which were grouped into five taxa. Each taxon presented one or more clusters that were moderately related and that contained two or more identical/highly related isolates, revealing seasonal airborne propagation in these dental clinic environments.
The dissemination of S. aureus is an important public health problem because its resistant strains are involved in severe infections, predominantly in children and hospitalized patients 21 . Dental practitioners treat a wide range of patients. Therefore, it is likely that they will have contact with people colonized or infected with drug-resistant microorganisms 4 Phenotype-and genotype-based methods have allowed researchers to classify microbial isolates in systematic, taxonomic, evolutionary, phylogenetic, and epidemiological studies 2, 28 . MLEE has been used for several decades as a standard method in eukaryotic population genetics and systematics 26 as well as in large-scale studies to estimate the genetic diversity and structure in natural populations of a variety of bacterial 23 , fungal, and yeast 3 species. Its special advantage is that mobility variants (electromorphs or allozymes) of an enzyme can be directly equated with alleles at the corresponding structural gene loci.
Another attractive feature is the likelihood that much of the electrophoretically demonstrable polymorphic variation in enzymes is selectively neutral or nearly so and, therefore, minimally subjected to evolutionary convergence 2, 28 . The genetic interpretation of patterns depends on the ploidy of the organism, and different rules have to be applied for haploid and diploid organisms 2, 28 . Based on these rules, the allelic makeup of each isolate is determined over the set of different enzymes studied (between 10 and 30).
The enzymes examined in MLEE typically participate in the basic metabolism of the cell and are less likely than other loci to be under selective pressure from the environment or to be subjected to convergence 2 .
Therefore, MLEE data are considered representative of the whole genome of an organism and form a good basis for population genetic studies of bacteria, fungi, and protozoa 2 . The genetic data obtained by MLEE can be used for a variety of purposes in the medical microbiology field: (i) to infer the degree of genetic recombination occurring within a natural population, (ii) to assess the degree of genetic isolation of natural populations, either for geographical and ecological reasons or because of biological barriers, (iii) to assess the degree of genetic relatedness between organisms or populations, and thus, provide systematic and taxonomic implications, (iv) to identify bacterial clones within species that can be associated with particular clinical patterns, with a particular frequency in clinical diseases or with a higher level of pathogenicity, and (v) epidemiological tracing of microorganisms. This method represents an invaluable complement to the most recent molecular typing methods, particularly for large-scale epidemiological studies 2 . In addition, MLEE possesses an excellent typeability (i.e., the percentage of distinct strains obtained), excellent reproducibility (i.e., the percentage of strains that show the same results in repeated assays), and good discriminatory power (i.e., its ability to differentiate unrelated strains) 2,3 .
Here, we evaluated the genetic diversity and the distribution of airborne S. aureus in a multi-user academic clinic by MLEE and a clustering analysis in an attempt to understand the air-spreading behavior of this bacterium.
A total of forty-four S. aureus isolates (predominantly ampicillin-resistant and β-lactamase positive) were employed. The bacteria were isolated, identified, and had their resistance profiles performed as described in a previous study 1 . Briefly, these isolates were S is the total number of types (strains) described, and n j is the number of isolates belonging to the j th type (strain). This equation was derived as follows. The probability that two isolates sampled consecutively will belong to that type (strain) is: .
These probabilities can be summed for all the described types (strains) to determine the probability that any two consecutively sampled isolates will be the same type (strain). This summation can be subtracted G  42  2  2  3  2  1  2  2  2  2  1  4  4  4  3   ET1  H  43  2  2  3  2  1  2  2  2  2  1  4  4  4  3   ET1  E  44  2  2  3  2  1  2  2  2  2  1  4  4  4  3   ET2  A  23  2  2  3  2  1  2  2  2  2  1  3  4  3  3   ET3  A  15  2  2  3  2  1  2  2  2  2  1  3  3  3  2   ET4  G  30  2  2  2  2  1  2  3  2  2  1  3  3  3  3   ET5  L  32  2  2  2  2  1  2  3  2  2  1  3  0  3 Cluster II: 3 highly related isolates 6.8% (isolates 13 ET13 -area C , 14 ET6 -area A , and 16 ET7 -area C ), or 3 highly related ETs 9.1% , including S. aureus ATCC 29213, Cluster III: 2 highly related isolates 4.5% (isolates 12 ET14 -area L and 27 ET18 -area I ), or 2 highly related ETs 6.1% obtained from 2 16.7% areas during ±5 months (from Dec. 5, 2000 to May 29, 2001 ).
