White leghorn chicken (Gallus gallus var. domesticus) were hatched and raised at the 5 FLI from SPF-eggs purchased from VALO BioMedia, Germany. One day old Pekin 6 ducklings (Anas platyrhynchos var. domesticus) and Muscovy ducklings (Cairina moschata) 7 were obtained from commercial sources. Adult 6-7 month old throughbreed ducks (Anas 8 platyrhynchos var. domesticus, "Rouen Claire") and geese (Anser anser var. domesticus, 9 "Pommeranian goose") were obtained from a local breeder and tested AIV-seronegative by 10 ELISA (ID-Vet, France) before inoculation. Animal numbers and group assignment are 11 summarized in table S2. Intravenous pathogenicity index testing (IVPI) was done according to 12 standard procedures 1 . Intramuscular pathogenicity index (IMPI) testing in one week old 13 Pekin and Muscovy ducklings followed the procedure of the IVPI in chicken, but with 14 injection of virus into the caudal femoral muscles and subsequent clinical scoring for 10 days. 15 In two subsequent experiments aadult ducks were inoculated oculo-nasally (o.n.) with 10 6 16 TCID 50 of either DE14-H5N8A or DE16-H5N8B. During the first infection experiment geese 17 (n=10) were simultaneously infected with DE14-H5N8A and housed together with inoculated 18 ducks. Virus replication was monitored by pharyngeal-and cloacal-swabs on day 2, 4, 7, 10 19 and 14 and on day 2 and 4 2 animals were sacrificed to investigate birds pathologically.
inoculated waterfowl and served as sentinels. Animals were monitored daily for clinical signs 25 for a period of up to 21 days. Animals the suffered severe disease like pronounced lethargy or 26 apathy were sacrificed before and considered dead on the subsequent day. The intramuscular 27 pathogenicity and clinical scoring indices (IMPI) were calculated based on the following tissues, three mice of each group were euthanized on 3 dpi, in addition three mice from the 53 groups 10 3 , 10 5 , 10 6 were euthanized on 6 dpi, and organs (i.e., lungs, conchae, heart, and 54 brains) were harvested for histopathological-and virological examinations. The primer and probe set of the generic PB1 assay (summarized in table S4) was used to 87 determine the quantification cycle (Cq) in swabs, nasal washes, and organs using the one-step 88 RT-qPCR Kit qScript™ XLT One-Step RT-qPCR ToughMix® (Quantabio, Beverly USA).
The RT-qPCR assay was optimized for using a total volume of 12.5 µl. Briefly, for a single 90 well 1.75 µl RNase-free water, 6.25 µl 2x RT-PCR buffer, and 1.0 µl primer-probe-mix for 91 template detection as well as 1.0 µl primer-probe-mix for detection of the internal extraction 92 control RNA, were pooled as a master mix. Finally, 2.5 µl RNA template was added and the 93 reaction was run on an CFX96 machine. Genome copy numbers per µl were determined by
