Tables S4.1 and S4.2 show the goodness-of-fit results (burn-in 1,000,000 iterations, 1,000,000 iterations per graph, 1000 graphs) for the multilevel exponential random graph model (ERGM) for the relationships network. Results were generated using MPNet [1] [2] [3] . Table S4 .1 shows the results for just the bipartite network. Column 1 lists the various statistics that are evaluated. Column 2 shows the value of the statistic for the empirical network ("Sample"). Columns 3 and 4 show the mean ("Mean") and sample standard deviation ("Std. Dev."), respectively, of the statistic over simulated networks. Column 5 shows the "t-ratio", defined as (observed value-mean value)/standard deviation. For each parameter, using standard methodology, the model is a good fit for the empirical network if the "t-ratio" has absolute value less than 0.1 for parameters explicitly in the model (shown in boldface) and less than 2 otherwise.
.2 shows the additional goodness-of-fit results arising from treating the network as multilevel. In particular, results for female-bipartite, male-bipartite, and female-bipartite-male network interactions are shown. All statistics are fit to an acceptable standard. Because the same-sex networks are fixed, graph statistics without bipartite edges show zero variation. The ability of this model specification to closely capture all these features of the empirical network, including ones not explicitly modelled, is strong evidence that a useful model has been specified.
