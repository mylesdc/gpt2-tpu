Random motility of virus (D v , D P BS ), controlling parameter (λ 51 ), Inhibition parameter of virus motility from ECM (K E ): Mok et al.
Clearance rate of viruses (γ): Friedman et al. [4] used γ = 2.5 × 10 −2 h −1 . Mok et al. [8] used γ = 4.8 × 10 −5 s −1 = 1.728 × 10 −1 h −1 for free (interstitial) and bound virus. In the in vitro experiments in [1] , the half-lives of HSV particles at 37 o C were ∼4 hours (∼ 1.733 × 10 −1 h −1 ) and ∼24 hours (∼ 2.89 × 10 −2 h −1 ) in tumor cell conditioned media and in PBS, respectively. However, as Mok et al. [1] noted, virus is internalized rapidly without much time for degradation. We found that the computational results is not sensitive to this parameters in several magnitudes as also noted in Wu et al. [9] . We take rather small value γ = 1.8 × 10 −3 h −1 .
Burst size of infected cells (b): We take b = 50 virus/cell from Friedman et al. [4] .
ECM production rate from uninfected tumor cells (λ 42 ): Kim et al. [10] took ECM remodeling/production rate of 5.0 × 10 −6 s −1 = 0.018 h −1 . We take λ 42 = 6.0 × 10 −3 h −1 . Assuming uninfected cell density x = (10 4 − 10 6 ) cells/mm 3 [4, 11] and K x = x * , m 2 = 1 in Table 1 , and λ 42 above, we get the effective production rate by uninfected tumor cells λ 42
ECM degradation rate (λ 41 ): Kim et al. [10] took 3.0 × 10 8 cm 3 /(g.s) for ECM degradation rate from MMP secretion of tumor cells. We take λ 41 = 9.0×10 1 h −1 . By assuming C = (0.5−250) mU/ml [12] [13] [14] and with K C = C * , m 1 = 1 in Table 1 , this estimated value λ 21 leads to the effective degradation rate λ 41
Natural decay rate of Chase (λ 62 ): Kim et al. [10] took the natural decay rate of MMPs to be 5.0 × 10 −6 s −1 = 1.8 × 10 −2 h −1 . The half-life of Chase-ABC (at 37 o C) can vary significantly [15] . The halflife was 6 days in brain of injected rat [13] while it can be 2-3 weeks with trehalose or albumin (stabilizers) [16, 17] . In the simulation, assuming the half-life of 115 hours, we take λ 62 = log(2)/115h = 6.0×10 −3 h −1 .
Secretion rate of ECM degrading enzyme (λ C ): This parameter value is largely unknown. We take λ C = 3.0 × 10 1 mU/(h.g), but also ran several trials ( Figure 5 in the main text) in order to gauge the effect of this parameter. Table 2 in the main text lists the reference values in the model. We define L = 3 mm following experimental setup in [5] and take the characteristic diffusion coefficient D = 1.5 × 10 −5 cm 2 /s so that T = 1.67 h. We determine the reference values for x, y, n, v, E, C as follows:
Cell density (x, y, n): Chicoine et al. took 5 × 10 5 cells/cm 3 [18] . Mok et al. [1] used high value 7.23 × 10 8 cells/ml from Thurber and Wittrup [19] . Friedman et al. used 10 6 cells/mm 3 = 10 9 cells/cm 3 from [11] . Following [4, 11] , we take x * = y * = n * = 10 6 cells/mm 3 .
We take v * = 2.2 × 10 11 virus/cm 3 = 2.2 × 10 8 virus/mm 3 [4, 11] . We also note that virus concentration can be calculated indirectly from plaque-forming unit (pfu). For instance, Mok et al. [1] estimated the total viral concentration from 1 × 10 6 pfu by using a factor of 50. In [5] , 3 × 10 5 pfu of rHsvQ or OV-Chase were used.
ECM density (CSPG (E * ), Tumor ECM (ρ * )): Various CSPG concentrations (0-500 µg/ml) and 5 µg/ml laminin were used for the invasive and noninvasive coculture spot assays in a study of the role of CSPG in regulation of glioma invasion and CSPG was shown to be a potent activator of microglia in vivo and to play as a key organizer of the brain tumor microenvironment [20] . High molecular weight Cat-301 CNS CSPG from brain in the density of 1.4 g/ml [21] was shown to have similar properties as aggrecan, the high molecular weight CSPG from cartilage with typical low-buoyant-densities 1.35-1.4g/ml [22] . Using isoforms of one of major CSPG components, version (Intact versicans V1, V2, and amixture of V0 and V1) isolated from calf aorta, bovine spinal cord, and the spent culture medium of the human glioma cell line U251MG, respectively, Dutt et al. investigated the role of versican V0 and V1 in the range of 0-100 µg/ml in regulation of neural crest cell migration. They found that even low levels of version V0/V1 (> 25 µg/ml) can inhibit neural crest stem cell migration [23, 24] . Also, total expression of noncleaved isoforms of BEHAB/Brevican was found to be >4-fold higher in human malignant gliomas compared with normal brain tissue [25] . Isolated versican from brain tissue was estimated to be 3mg/100g wet tissue [26] . We take E * = 1.0 mg/cm 3 . Glial HA-binding protein (GHAP), a brain-specific protein mainly localized in white matter, is present in high concentrations in CNS tissues, 8.2 mg/100g in human white matter (wet tissue) [26] compared to the concentration of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in buffered extracts of human spinal cord, 3.5 mg/100g [27] . We take ρ * =1.0 mg/cm 3 .
Concentration of Chase-ABC (C * ): High-dose infusions of Chase (2 − 1, 000 U/mL) is necessary in order to get diffusion of Chase-ABC into deep regions of the spinal cord when it is delivered intrathecally because of attendant dilution and overflow beyond the intrathecal space [17] . In a study of delivery of thermostabilized Chase for functional recovery after injury, Lee et al. [17] found that trahalose-assisted Chase in the concentration of 2 U/0.5mL was enough to digest CSPG decorin. In a study of effects of Chase ABC on the morphology of neural precursor cells (NPCs) expanded in spheres, Gu et al. [14] used a wide concentration range of Chase ABC (0.5-50 mU/mL) in addition to 20 ng/ml EGF and 20 ng/ml bFGF. In a study of effect of Chase-ABC on acute and long-lasting changes in CSPG, injected Chase ABC at a concentration of 0.25 U/µl led to significant degradation of ECM in the adult rat brain [12] . The protease-free Chase-ABC in the concentration of 50 U/ml showed digestion of CSPGs around the injection site (leading to low GAG content (1,200-2,000 µg/mg) compared to high peak values (4, 000 µg/mg) with penicillinase-treatment) and promoted axon regeneration [13] . We take C * = 50 mU/ml.
We nondimensionalize the variables and parameters in the partial differential equations (A.1)-(A.9) as follows:t
The governing equations in a dimensionless form are
∂C ∂ν = 0, on ∂Ω 0 .
*Note thatβ † =β,δ † =δ under the assumption of x * = y * = n * ; otherwiseβ † ,δ † fromβ,δ, respectively.
Equations (2)-(13) were solved using multigrid method [28] and vanka relaxation method [29] .
Velocities are defined at cell boundaries while x, y, n, E, ρ, v, C, and p are defined at the cell centers. Let a computational domain be partitioned in Cartesian geometry into a uniform mesh with mesh spacing h. The center of each cell, Ω ij , is located at (x i , y j ) = ((i−0.5)h, (j−0.5)h) for i = 1, · · · , N x and j = 1, · · · , N y . N x and N y are the numbers of cells in x and y-directions, respectively. The cell vertices are located at (x i+ 1 2 , y j+ 1 2 ) = (ih, jh). Let ∆t be a time step and k be a time step index. At the beginning of each time step, given x k , y k , n k , E k , ρ k , v k , C k , and u k , we want to find x k+1 , y k+1 , n k+1 , E k+1 , ρ k+1 , v k+1 , C k+1 , u k+1 , and p k+1 which solve the following temporal discretization of equations (2)-(10):
The outline of the main procedures in one time step is:
Step 1. Initialize x 0 , y 0 , n 0 , E 0 , ρ 0 , v 0 , C 0 , and u 0 .
Step 2. Solve x k+1 , y k+1 , n k+1 , E k+1 , and ρ k+1 . The resulting finite difference equations (14)-(18) are written out explicitly. They take the form
where the advection term, ∇ · (x k u k ), is defined by:
where u and w are horizontal and vertical velocity components, respectively. The quantities ∇ · (y k u k ), ∇ · (n k u k ), ∇ · (E k u k ), and ∇ · (ρ k u k ) are computed in a similar manner.
Step 3. The resulting implicit discrete system (19)- (20) is solved by a linear geometric multigrid method [28] .
Step 4. The resulting implicit discrete system (21)- (22) is solved by a coupled block-implicit multigrid method [29] .
A pointwise Gauss-Seidel relaxation scheme is used as the smoother in the linear geometric and coupled block-implicit multigrid methods.
These complete the one time step.
