. b The severity of each patient was assessed with the use of the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score within the first 24 h after ICU admission (Knaus et al. 1985) . c The Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score was evaluated as an indicator of organ dysfunction (Vincent et al. 1986 ELISA -819 C/T PCR-RFLP C/C genotype was associated with higher IL10 production after LPS stimulation (P = 0.03) and hyaluronic acid stimulation (P = 0.05) Zeng 2009 China ( Supplementary Figure S3 . Linkage disequilibrium plots of the IL1B, IL8, IL4, IL13, TLR4 and TLR9 gene regions generated with the LD tag SNP selection tool within SNPinfo resource. Pair-wise LD values are indicated by different color, which changes from red to white as the D' value decreases. SNP name is colored with genomic context: black, intron region; red: coding region; blue, UTR (untranslated) region, green, non-genic region. Minor allele frequency for each SNP in the European population is denoted by the height of green bar. Functional annotations from the SNP info web server are shown with red arrows: one arrow, regulatory potential is in the range of 0.10-0.20; two arrows, regulatory potential is in the range of 0.20-0.30; three arrows, regulatory potential is higher than 0.30. Functional annotations from the RegulomeDB info web server are represented with dark blue arrows: one arrow, score 2a-2f; two arrows, score 1a-1f. Scores 3-7 are not provided. SNPs with category 7 score lack evidence of regulatory function, while category 1 variants are assumed to affect binding and expression of a gene target. Within subcategories a-f, variant scored as 1a has the highest confidence on functionality. Functional annotations from the NHGRI GWAS Catalog are marked by green arrows. The number of arrows corresponds to the number of associations in the Catalog.
