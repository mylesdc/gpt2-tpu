Here, we report the near-complete genome sequence of the infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) strain VFAR-047, isolated in Peru in 2014. This strain was classified into GI lineage 16 (GI-16) based on both the genome and Spike 1 (S1) sequence analysis. Furthermore, four potential recombination events with other GI-16 and GI-11 strains were identified.
sharing 98% to 93% identity with GI-16 representative strains gammaCoV/Ck/Italy/I2022/13 (GenBank accession number KP780179), ck/CH/LDL/97I (JX195177 and JX195178), UY/ 09/CA/01 (MF421319), and IZO 28/86 (KJ941019). Phylogenetic analysis of the nearcomplete genome showed that VFAR-047 is grouped in the same branch with UY/09/CA/ 01, UY/11/CA/18 (MF421320), gammaCoV/Ck/Italy/I2022/13, and CK/CH/LDL/97I, with average nucleotide identities ranging from 93% to 92%. The phylogenetic network ( Fig. 1 ) and the phi test showed statistically significant evidence of recombination (P ϭ 0.0). Furthermore, five recombined sequences were identified with high reliability by six methods embedded in RDP4, which include four potential recombination events with GI-16 and GI-11 strains.
The VFAR-047 genome will facilitate future development of new vaccines and other infection control strategies in the poultry industry.
Data availability. The near-complete genome sequence of infectious bronchitis virus isolate VFAR-047 has been deposited in GenBank under the accession number MH878976. Raw data were deposited in the SRA under BioSample number SAMN10521748 and SRA run number SRR8281084, which are part of SRA study number SRP172861.
