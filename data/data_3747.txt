In 2016 and 2018, two porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) strains, CH-01 and HNZK-02, were identified from fecal samples of piglets with diarrhea in Henan Province, China. The full-length genomic sequence analysis indicated that these two strains had high nucleotide identities with the other Chinese PDCoV epidemic strains.
genomic structure of the two PDCoVs contained the following gene order: 5= untranslated region (UTR), open reading frame 1a/1b (ORF 1a/1b), spike glycoprotein (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), nonstructural protein 6 (Nsp6), nucleocapsid (N), Nsp7, and 3= UTR. The sizes of these genes of the PDCoV strain CH-01 were 539, 18,788, 3,480, 252, 654, 285, 1,029, 603, and 392 nt, respectively. The PDCoV strain HNZK-02 contained an 18,803-nt ORF1a/1b, which had a 6-nt and 9-nt insert at nucleotide positions 1739 and 2804, respectively, compared with that of the CH-01 strain (the nucleotide positions were numbered according to the entire genome sequence of PDCoV CH-01). The other genes in strain HNZK-02 had the same sizes as those of the PDCoV CH-01 strain.
The identities of PDCoV nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences were aligned and analyzed using the Clustal W program of DNAStar 7.0 green. The two sequenced PDCoV strains have nucleotide identities from 98.1% to 99.4% with the Chinese epidemic PDCoV strains (GenBank accession numbers KP757892, KR131621, MF280390, KU981062, and KP757890) and nucleotide identities from 98.9% to 99.0% with some U.S. PDCoV strains (GenBank accession numbers KJ481931, KJ462462, KJ567050, and KJ769231).
The sequence data of the two PDCoV strains will facilitate future research on the epidemiology and evolutionary biology of PDCoV in China.
Data availability. The complete genome sequences of the two PDCoV strains (HNZK-02 and CH-01) have been deposited in GenBank under the accession numbers MH708123 and KX443143.
