Orange indicates low quality modeling while blue indicates high quality modeling. The model was assigned a QMEAN Z-score of -2.13 which indicates that the model is comparable to what one would expect from experimental structures of similar size. LY6E point mutations are indicated at their respective loop regions. b STAT1 -/fibroblasts expressing LY6E-HA or HA-tagged point mutants shown in a. The cell surface was probed for HA (green) and DAPI was added to stain nuclei (blue). Scale bar, 20 µm. c Whole cell lysates from STAT1 -/fibroblasts described in b were lysed and probed for HA or actin expression. n = 1 of 3 biological replicates. d STAT1 -/fibroblasts were transduced with 5 volumes of lentivirus (two-fold increase per dose) expressing LY6E (L36A)-HA or LY6E-HA.

Amino acid sequence identity and similarity of a subset of LY6E orthologs relative to human LY6E.

Overlap-extension PCR (OE PCR) was used to generate block and point mutations, as well as to add HA tags to LY6E and CD59. The published P. alecto Ly6e annotation was corrected by removing 99 amino acids prior to the predicted signal peptide, using OE PCR. BP arms were added to M. musculus Ly6e for Gateway cloning. All genes were transferred to Gateway-compatible pSCRPSY or pTRIP lentiviral backbones by LR reaction. sgRNA sequences for targeting LY6E were cloned into the lentiCRISPRv2 plasmid as detailed by the GeCKO protocol 3,4 . LY6E ortholog molecular phylogenetic analysis LY6E sequences from nineteen species were aligned using MUSCLE 5 as implemented in MEGA7 6 . The alignment was manually curated to ensure preservation of coding sequences. A maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree was constructed by the HKY85 substitution model. The tree with the highest log likelihood (-2703.7050) is shown. Initial trees for the heuristic search were obtained automatically by applying Neighbor-Join and BioNJ algorithms to a matrix of pairwise distances estimated using the Maximum Composite Likelihood (MCL) approach, and then selecting the topology with superior log likelihood value.
The number of amino acid substitutions per site between sequences for the four indicated LY6E orthologs are shown. Analyses were conducted using the Dayhoff matrix-based model 7 . All positions with less than 95% site coverage were eliminated. That is, fewer than 5% alignment gaps, missing data, and ambiguous bases were allowed at any position. There were a total of 131 positions in the final dataset. Evolutionary analyses were conducted in MEGA7.
