We report here the complete genome sequence of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) strain CH/GX/2015/750A (750A), which was isolated from a suckling piglet with watery diarrhea in Guangxi, China. The isolate is genetically close to other recent Chinese variant PEDVs and distinct from the classical PEDVs.
. However, 750A has a relatively low nucleotide identity (96.8% to 97.7%) with classical strains and vaccine strains (CV777 and DR13) in Asia, which might explain the incomplete protection efficiency of the vaccination.
The genome sequence reported in this study will promote a better understanding of the molecular pathogenesis and genetic diversity of PEDV.
Accession number(s). The complete genome sequence of PEDV strain CH/GX/2015/ 750A has been deposited in GenBank under the accession no. KY793536.
