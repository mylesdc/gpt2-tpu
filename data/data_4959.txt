All ESI-MS experiments were performed on a micrOTOF-Q mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) equipped with standard ESI source. The instrument was operated in the positive-ion mode and calibrated with the Tunemix™ mixture (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA). The scan range was between 200 -1700 m/z. The mass accuracy was better than 5 ppm. Samples were dissolved in 200 µL of the water/MeCN/HCOOH (50:50:0.1, v/v/v) mixture. Analyte solution was infused at a flow rate of 3 μl/min. The instrument parameters were as follows: scan range: 50-1600 m/z; drying gas: nitrogen; flow rate: 4.0 L/min, temperature: 200 ºC; potential between the spray needle and the orifice: 4.2 kV.

All NMR spectra were recorded in H2O/D2O (9:1 v:v) or DMSO at 298 K. The concentration of the sample was 2.12 ×10 -4 M.(0.7 ml). For the peptide studied the following spectra were recorded 1D proton spectrum and 2D TOCSY and ROESY at mixing times of 80 and 200 ms and additionally 1 H-13 C HSQC.
Attempts of resolving the molecule sequence (ABZ 6 -Dap(O2(Cbz)) 5 -Dap(Cbz) 4 -Dap(GO1) 3 -Arg 2 -ANB-NH2 1 ) were made using 2D H 1 NMR. The first was recognized the characteristic spin system of Arg (residue 2). Next on the basis of sequential NOE effects two substituted Dap residues linked via peptide bond were assigned (residues 3, 4 and 5 respectively). The chemical shifts of side chain HN protons of Dap (diaminopropionic acid residues) were determined by couplings with HN deriving from the backbone. The chemical shift of HN of ANB-NH2 (residue 1) was established on the basis of the coupling with HN of Arg. Protons of aromatic ring of ANB-NH2 were assigned by the coupling with HN of the same moiety. Residue 6 presence were visible as aromatic protons coupled with amide protons of Dap residue.
