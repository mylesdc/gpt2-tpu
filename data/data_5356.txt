a Non-pneumonia (Non-Pn) case defined as a case with a normal CXR, blood culture pathogen negative, and normal respiratory rate or non-hypoxic in the absence of crackles, or normal respiratory rate and non-hypoxic in the presence of crackles. b P-value obtained by McNemar's Chi-square test. * Presence in IS alone is significantly greater than NP/OP alone (<.002). ** Presence in NP/OP alone is significantly greater than IS alone (<.002).
Pathogen detection by multiplex PCR of paired nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs and induced sputum collected from children aged 1-59 months hospitalized with CXR+ pneumonia in whom a low quality induced sputum specimens was available Abbreviations: CXR+, chest x-ray positive; NP, nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal; IS, induced sputum
Restricted to CXR+ cases with paired NP/OP swabs and low quality IS specimens (≥ 10 squamous epithelial cells per low power field; N=578); some cases missing data for certain pathogens (< 20 cases per pathogen). Chest x-ray positive defined as radiographic evidence of pneumonia (consolidation and/or other infiltrates). Restricted to Chest x-ray positive cases with paired NP/OP swabs and high quality IS specimens (< 10 squamous epithelial cells per low power field; N=1114); some cases missing data for certain pathogens (≤ 20 cases per pathogen). Chest x-ray positive defined as radiographic evidence of pneumonia (consolidation and/or other infiltrates). Bold indicates significant difference in proportion of children with IS density greater than or less than 1 log more than NP/OP density (p < 0.002). a P-value obtained by two-sided sign test. The denominator was the number of children with available IS results for each pathogen. Some cases missing data for certain pathogens (<20 cases per pathogen). CXR+ defined as radiographic evidence of pneumonia (consolidation and/or other infiltrates). Non-pneumonia (Non-Pn) case defined as a case with a normal CXR, blood culture pathogen negative, and normal respiratory rate or non-hypoxic in the absence of crackles, or normal respiratory rate and non-hypoxic in the presence of crackles. OR adjusted for age, sex, site and HIV status. *p<.05 and **p<.002. The denominator was the number of children with available IS results for each pathogen. Some cases missing data for certain pathogens (<20 cases per pathogen). CXR+ defined as radiographic evidence of pneumonia (consolidation and/or other infiltrates). Non-pneumonia (Non-Pn) case defined as a case with a normal CXR, blood culture pathogen negative, and normal respiratory rate or non-hypoxic in the absence of crackles, or normal respiratory rate and non-hypoxic in the presence of crackles. OR adjusted for age, sex, site and HIV status. *p<.05 and **p<.002. Non-pneumonia (Non-Pn) case defined as a case with a normal CXR, blood culture pathogen negative, and normal respiratory rate or non-hypoxemic in the absence of crackles, or normal respiratory rate and non-hypoxemic in the presence of crackles. * Presence in Non-Pn cases is significantly greater than in controls (<.002). ** Presence in controls is significantly greater than in Non-Pn cases (<.002).
