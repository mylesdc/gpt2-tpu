Qualitative PCR was performed on biopsies for Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), Human metapneumovirus (hMPV), Influenza A+B, Parainfuenza virus 1-4, Coronavirus (HKU-1, NL63, OC43), Rhinovirus, Adenovirus, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Human Bocavirus (HBoV) using methods and primers as described previously [1] .
Briefly, Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) was detected by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) utilizing primers specific to matrix (M) gene. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was detected by RT-PCR using primers specific to the N gene as described.
Influenza A & B viruses were detected by RT-PCR using primers specific to negative sense (NS1) genes and parainfluenza (PIV) 1, 2, 3 & 4 were detected using primers specific to heamagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) (PIV1-3) and type 4B phosphoprotein genes (PIV4).
Rhinoviruses were detected by RT-PCR using primers specific to 5' UTR sequence. Human coronaviruses (HCoV -229E, OC43, NL63 & HKU1) were detected by RT-PCR using primers specific to the viral replicase gene. Primers specific to adenovirus hexon gene, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chalmydia sp. 16S rRNA genes, were used to detect these agents. Human bocavirus (HBoV) was identified by PCR using corrected versions of specific primers for the gene encoding nonstructural protein-1 (NP-1).
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was detected using the artus EBV LC PCR kit (Qiagen, Crawley, UK). Varicella zoster virus (VZV) was detected by Taqmanâ„¢ PCR using primers specific for the ORF28 gene (DNA polymerase) as follows: sense 5'-GCGCGGTAGTAACAGAGAATTTC-3';
anti-sense 5'-TGGGCACATCTTCATCTAAACATT-3'. Probe FAM-ACCATGTCATCGTTTCAA -MGB.
