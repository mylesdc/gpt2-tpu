This review presents the up to date development of fused thiopyranothiazoles that comprise one of the thiazolidine derivatives classes. Thiazolidine and thiazolidinone-related compounds belong to the widely studied heterocycles from a medicinal chemistry perspective. From the chemical point of view, they are perfect heterodienes to undergo hetero-Diels-Alder reaction with a variety of dienophiles, yielding regio-and diastereoselectively thiopyranothiazole scaffolds. The annealing of thiazole and thiopyran cycles in condensed heterosystem is a precondition for the "centers conservative" creation of the ligand-target binding complex and can promote a potential selectivity to biotargets. The review covers possible therapeutic applications of thiopyrano[2,3-d]thiazoles, such as anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, anticancer as well as aniparasitic activities. Thus, thiopyrano[2,3-d]thiazoles may be used as powerful tools in the development of biologically active agents and drug-like molecules.
The thiopyranothiazole scaffold is characterized by "fixed" 4-thiazolidinone biophor in a "rigid" condensed system that allows to save the biological activity of their synthetic precursors 5-ene-4-thiazolidinones. 4-Thiazolidinones and related heterocycles comprise a sufficiently studied class of compounds that reveal a wide spectrum of biological activities, such as anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antifungal, antiviral, anticancer, anticonvulsant, antituberculous [1] [2] [3] [4] , etc. Among thiazolidinone derivatives, there are a number of drug candidates as well as approved drugs, for example, anti-hyperglycemic glitazones (PPARγ agonists)-Roziglitazone, Pioglitazone (2,4-thiazolidinedione derivatives) [5] ; aldose reductase inhibitor-Epalrestat (rhodanine derivative) [6] ; anti-inflammatory drug-double cyclooxygenase-2/5-lipooxygenase inhibitor-Darbufelon (2-amino-4-thiazolidone derivative) [7] ; diuretic Ethozoline (2-ene-4-thiazolidinone derivative) [8] ; anticonvulsant Ralitolin [9] . However, recently, such a rich pharmacological profile of thiazolidinones is considered by some medicinal chemists not as an advantage, but as a drawback. For example, 5-ene-4-thiazolidinones, being the most active subgroup, is classified as PAINS (pan assay interference compounds) that are defined by their ability to show activity across a range of assays and towards a range of proteins [10, 11] . This is argued by a variety of inherent biological activity, low selectivity and the ability of 5-ylidene-4-thiazolidinones to be Michael acceptors. Despite this, rigorous selection based on SAR analysis and proved selectivity leave such compounds a «right to life» in medicinal chemistry [12] [13] [14] . Moreover, the objects of our review (thiopyranothiazoles) can be considered as 
The most effective approach to thiopyrano [2,3-d] thiazole system design is the use of the hetero-Diels-Alder reaction. Mentioned approach has been described for the first time by I.D. Komaritsa [18] , N.A. Kassab et al. [19, 20] who had successfully used 5-arylidene-4-thioxo-2-thiazolidinones (5arylideneisorhodanines) and 5-arylidene-2,4-thiazolidinedithiones (5-arylidenethiorhodanines) as heterodienes. Mentioned reagents contain in their structure α,β-unsaturated thiocarbonyl fragment similar to the 1-thio-1,3-butadiene which leads to their high reactivity in the [4+2]-сycloaddition reactions ( Figure 2 ). According to the molecular orbital theory, Diels-Alder reaction is based on the overlay of the diene's "HOMO" and dienophile's "LUMO". The important condition for this reaction is the presence of strong dienophile with electron acceptor properties to decrease energy difference between diene's "HOMO" and "LUMO" or "HOMO" of the dienophile. For these reasons reactions are highly regioselective and form products according to the molecular orbital theory. 
5-arylideneiso-and thiorhodanines 1 are prepared in the Knoevenagel reaction of the corresponding 4-thiazolidinethiones [21] which in turn are synthesized in the thionation reaction of 2-thioxo-4-thiazolidinone (rhodanine) and 2,4-thiazolidinedione (Scheme 1). The thionation reaction of 4-thiazolidinones is commonly carried out in anhydrous dioxane with P2S5 [22, 23] or Lawesson's reagent (LR)-(2,4-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)-1,3-dithiadiphosphetane-2,4-dithione) [24] . A green method of 5-arylidene-4-thioxothiazolidines synthesis in PEG medium at room temperature without adding any catalyst has been recently reported [25] .

The combination of thiazole and thiopyran cycles in condensed heterosystem is a precondition for the creation of "centers conservative" of the ligand-target binding complex and promotes potential selectivity to biotargets. Considering the mentioned arguments, the directed search for new chemotherapeutic agents among thiopyrano [2,3-d] thiazole derivatives is a justified and promising direction in modern medicinal chemistry. In this review, we tried to systematize the data on chemistry and pharmacology of thiopyrano [2,3-d] thiazoles from the perspective of medicinal and pharmaceutical chemistry.

It is important to note that thionation of 5-arylidene-3-phenylrhodanines with the Lawesson's reagent in the xylene medium can result in the formation of thione's dimers 3, due to the spontaneous [4+2]-cycloaddition reaction of the intermediate 5-arylidene-2,4-thiazolidinedithiones 2 (Scheme 2).

Core 5-Alkylidene-4-thiazolidinediones are useful and important reagents in the search for biological active compounds, as they allow obtaining thiopyrano [2,3-d] thiazole derivatives with relatively low molecular weight. Among them 5-ethoxymethylideneisorhodanine and corresponding thiorhodanine are the most interesting and effective heterodienes that significantly expanded structural diversity of thiopyrano[2,3-d]thiazoles (Scheme 12). In the early works [18, 39] dedicated to this issue a number of specific features of mentioned 4-thiazolidinethiones in hetero-Diels-Alder reaction were experimentally established and outlined. In particular, [4+2]-cycloaddition of 5-ethoxymethylideneiso-and thiorhodanines with appropriate dienophiles in the toluene medium at room temperature passes as a classical hetero-Diels-Alder reaction with the formation of 7-ethoxy-3,5,6,7-tetrahydro-2H-thiopyrano[2,3-d]thiazoles 36,37. When changing the reaction medium to the acetic acid and heating the reaction mixture, elimination of the ethanol molecule with the formation of an additional double bond and the corresponding 3,5-dihydro-2H-thiopyrano[2,3-d]thiazoles 38-40 is observed. Analogous pattern was observed in the [4+2]-cycloaddition with acrolein, crotonic aldehyde, 2-norbornene and 5-norbornene-2,3-dicarboxylic acid imides in the medium of acetic acid that allowed obtaining heterocyclic aldehydes 41 and polycyclic heterosystems 42,43 [40] .

[36] yielded low molecular thiopyrano[2,3-d]thiazoles 50-52 [41] .
cyclohexanone at room temperature and in the presence of triethylamine as catalyst. Interestingly, performing the reaction in ethanol medium at the solvent boiling point leads to the formation of tricyclic heterosystems 48. When thiorhodanine is used, only condensed derivatives 49 are formed regardless of the reaction conditions. [4+2]-Cycloaddition of 5-(cyclo)alkylideneisorhodanines with arylmaleinamides, 2-norbornene and (3,5-dioxo-4-azatricyclo[5.2.1.0 2,6 ]decen-8-yl-4)-acetic acid [36] yielded low molecular thiopyrano[2,3-d]thiazoles 50-52 [41] . 
The Michael reaction is one more effective approach to the synthesis of thiopyrano[2,3-d]thiazoles (Scheme 15). Thus, the interaction of arylmethylene malononitrile and 3-substituted isorhodanines in the medium of absolute ethanol at the presence of triethylamine gave 5-amino-2-oxo-7-phenyl-3,5,6,7-tetrahydro-2H-thiopyrano[2,3-d]thiazole-6-carbonitriles 53 [42] . 
The Michael reaction is one more effective approach to the synthesis of thiopyrano[2,3d]thiazoles (Scheme 15). Thus, the interaction of arylmethylene malononitrile and 3-substituted isorhodanines in the medium of absolute ethanol at the presence of triethylamine gave 5-amino-2oxo-7-phenyl-3,5,6,7-tetrahydro-2Н-thiopyrano[2,3-d]thiazole-6-carbonitriles 53 [42] . 
The Michael reaction is one more effective approach to the synthesis of thiopyrano[2,3d]thiazoles (Scheme 15).

When studying the peculiarities of Michael addition of bicyclic 5-arylideneiso(thio)rhodanines 56 with malonodinitrile bis-thiopyrano[2,3-d]thiazole derivative 58 was obtained, which early was synthesized in the reaction of 1,4-bis-(2,2′-dicyanovinyl)-benzene 57 with two equivalents of isorhodanine. In the second case, formation of the derivative 58 occured as two-stage process When studying the peculiarities of Michael addition of bicyclic 5-arylideneiso(thio)rhodanines 56 with malonodinitrile bis-thiopyrano[2,3-d]thiazole derivative 58 was obtained, which early was synthesized in the reaction of 1,4-bis-(2,2′-dicyanovinyl)-benzene 57 with two equivalents of isorhodanine. In the second case, formation of the derivative 58 occured as two-stage process including an initial Michael reaction with further cyclization of the intermediate by the attack of cyano group with mercapto group of thiazole cycle (Scheme 17) [38] . Unexpectedely, Zhang and coauthors obtained thiopyranoid scaffold 60 (Scheme 18) exploring the divergent organocatalitic Michael-Michael-aldol cascade reaction of isorhodanine with α,βunsaturated aldehydes. Whilst the same conditions in the reaction of thiazolidinedione and rhodanine with enals led to spiro compounds, in the case of isorhodanine usage Michael cyclization took place. Optimizing the reaction conditions authors had used toluene medium and organic catalyst 59 at room temperature [44] . 
The tandem and "domino" processes based on [4+2]-cycloaddition reaction is a powerful and effective tool in the synthesis of thiopyrano[2,3-d]thiazole derivatives. This type of reactions allows the synthesis of structurally complex molecules with high selectivity, while the consumption of solvents, reagents, adsorbents and energy is significantly reduced comparing with traditional multistage synthetic approaches. Moreover, most of the tandem and "domino" reactions products have drug-like structure and probably may possess interesting pharmacological effects that is important point in the modern process of drugs development.

Presence of active groups in the o-position of arylidene fragment in 5-arylidene-4thiazolidinethiones is an important feature contributing to the passing of tandem processes based on hetero-Diels-Alder and Michael reactions in the synthesis of thiopyrano[2,3-d]thiazoles. For example, I.D. Komaritsa [18] and N.A. Kassab [20] had used 5-(2-hydroxyphenylmethylidene)-isorhodanine in the reactions with acrylic acid, its ethyl ester or amide to obtaine 3,5a,6,11b-tetra-2H, 5H-chromeno[4 ,3 :4,5]thiopyrano[2,3-d]thiazole-2,6-dione with high yields 61. Mentioned reaction is a two-step process involving combination of hetero diene synthesis and acylation of phenolic group and was the first example of tandem hetero-Diels-Alder reaction for the 5-arylidene-4-thiazolidinethiones (Scheme 19).

Among the tandem hetero-Diels-Alder reactions, two types of processes can be distinguished: acylation-and hemiacetal-based reactions (Scheme 21). The first approach requires the usage of derivatives of α,β-unsaturated carboxylic acids as dienophiles, and the second-α,β-unsaturated oxo compounds (aldehydes and ketones). Among the tandem hetero-Diels-Alder reactions, two types of processes can be distinguished: acylation-and hemiacetal-based reactions (Scheme 21). The first approach requires the usage of 12 of 24 derivatives of α,β-unsaturated carboxylic acids as dienophiles, and the second-α,β-unsaturated oxo compounds (aldehydes and ketones).

The first approach requires the usage of derivatives of α,β-unsaturated carboxylic acids as dienophiles, and the second-α,β-unsaturated oxo compounds (aldehydes and ketones). Thus, when studying hetero-Diels-Alder-acylation tandem reactions of 5-(2hydroxyphenylmethylidene)isorhodanines 64 with unsaturated carboxylic acids and their derivatives more precisely, a number of stereochemical peculiarities of these processes were established (Scheme 22). For example, in the reaction of crotonic acid, its amides or anhydride a mixture of rel-5R,5aR,11bS and rel-5S,5aR,11bS diastereomers (65) were formed; the isomers' ratio depends on the nature of dienophile and the reaction temperature [26] . The reaction of heterodiene 64 with maleic and fumaric acids and their derivatives (maleic anhydride, esters) passed diastereoselectively [46, 47] . Moreover, independently of the stereoisomerism of the dienophile a racemic mixture of rel-(5R,5aR,11bS)-2,6-dioxo-3,5a,6,11b-tetrahydro-2Н,5H-chromeno[4′,3′:4,5] thiopyrano[2,3-d]thiazole-5-carboxylic acids derivatives 66 with a cis-Hydrogen in positions 5, 5α, and 11β of heterocyclic systems was formed. Itaconic acid and its anhydride [48, 49] as well as transaconitic acid [33] reacted in a similar manner forming derivative 67. In the case of trans-aconitic acid the reaction proceeded with spontaneous decarboxylation at position 5 of thiopyrano[2,3-d]thiazole core [33] . rel-(5S,5aR,11bS)-5-Aryl-3,5a,6,11b-tetrahydro-2Н,5H-chromeno [4′,3′:4,5]thiopyrano [2,3d] thiazole-2,6-diones 68 were the products of tandem hetero-Diels-Alder-acylation reaction of 5-(2hydroxyphenylmethylidene)isorhodanines and cynnamic acids [26] . Compound 67 proved to be effective reagent for the next chemical transformations. The reaction of 67 with primary amines in acetic acid passed through the amidation stage, followed by spontaneous recycling in spiroimides 68. The thiopyrano [2,3-d] thiazoles 68 were also obtained by the alternative method from itaconic acid imides [48] .

Moreover, independently of the stereoisomerism of the dienophile a racemic mixture of rel-(5R,5aR,11bS)-2,6-dioxo-3,5a,6,11b-tetrahydro-2H,5H-chromeno [4 ,3 :4,5] thiopyrano [2,3-d] thiazole-5-carboxylic acids derivatives 66 with a cis-Hydrogen in positions 5, 5α, and 11β of heterocyclic systems was formed. Itaconic acid and its anhydride [48, 49] as well as trans-aconitic acid [33] reacted in a similar manner forming derivative 67. In the case of trans-aconitic acid the reaction proceeded with spontaneous decarboxylation at position 5 of thiopyrano [2,3-d] thiazole core [33] . rel-(5S,5aR,11bS)-5-Aryl-3,5a,6,11b-tetrahydro-2H,5H-chromeno [4 ,3 :4,5] thiopyrano [2,3-d] thiazole-2,6-diones 68 were the products of tandem hetero-Diels-Alder-acylation reaction of 5-(2-hydroxyphenylmethylidene)isorhodanines and cynnamic acids [26] .

It is important to note that at interaction of 5-(2-hydroxyphenylmetylidene)isorhodanine with propiolic acid, a classic hetero-Diels-Alder reaction takes place to form thiopyrano [2,3- The reaction of 5-(2-hydroxyphenylmethylidene)isorhodanines with 2(5H)furanone proceeded as a diastereoselective tandem acylation-hetero-Diels-Alder reaction providing novel rel-(5R,5aR,11bS)-5hydroxymethyl-3,5,5a,11b-tetrahydro-2H,5H-chromeno [4 ,3 :4,5] thiopyrano [2,3-d] thiazole-2,6-diones 72 (Scheme 24) [32] . The reactions between 5-(2-hydroxybenzylidene)-4-thioxo-2-thiazolidinones and arylidene pyruvic acids yielded the mixture of rel- (5S,5aR,11bR) 73 and rel-(5R,5aS,11bR) 73* diastereisomers at 2:1 ratio [50] . At the same time acroleine, crotonic and cynnamic aldehydes in mentioned tandem hetero-Diels-Alder-hemiacetal reaction (Scheme 25) diastereoselectively yielded novel rel-(5aR,6R,11bS)-6-hydroxy-3,5a,6,11b-tetrahydro-2H,5H-chromeno[4′,3′:4,5]thiopyrano[2,3-d]thiazole- The reactions between 5-(2-hydroxybenzylidene)-4-thioxo-2-thiazolidinones and arylidene pyruvic acids yielded the mixture of rel-(5S,5aR,11bR) 73 and rel-(5R,5aS,11bR) 73* diastereisomers at 2:1 ratio [50] . At the same time acroleine, crotonic and cynnamic aldehydes in mentioned tandem hetero-Diels-Alder-hemiacetal reaction (Scheme 25) diastereoselectively yielded novel rel-(5aR,6R,11bS)-6-hydroxy-3,5a,6,11b-tetrahydro-2H,5H-chromeno [4 ,3 :4,5] thiopyrano [2,3-d] thiazole-2-ones 74 [51] . The reactions between 5-(2-hydroxybenzylidene)-4-thioxo-2-thiazolidinones and arylidene pyruvic acids yielded the mixture of rel- (5S,5aR,11bR) 73 and rel-(5R,5aS,11bR) 73* diastereisomers at 2:1 ratio [50] . At the same time acroleine, crotonic and cynnamic aldehydes in mentioned tandem hetero-Diels-Alder-hemiacetal reaction (Scheme 25) diastereoselectively yielded novel rel-(5aR,6R,11bS)-6-hydroxy-3,5a,6,11b-tetrahydro-2H,5H-chromeno[4′,3′:4,5]thiopyrano[2,3-d]thiazole-2-ones 74 [51] . 
In addition to tandem reactions, domino reactions also play an important role in the synthesis of thiopyrano[2,3-d]thiazoles of complex structure. A domino reaction involves two or more transformations, which result in the formation of bonds (usually C-C bonds) and occur under the same reaction conditions without adding new reagents and/or catalysts. In this process the subsequent reactions take place as a consequence of the functionality formed in the previous step [52] .
So, one of the examples of thiopyranothiazole scaffold synthesis is obtaining of series of chromeno[4′,3′:4,5]thiopyrano[2,3-d]thiazole-2-(thi)ones 76,77 and isothiochromeno[4a,4-d]thiazole-2-ones 75 in the domino Knoevenagel-hetero-Diels-Alder reaction (Scheme 26) of isorhodanine with 3,7-dimethyl-6-octenal ((±)citronelal) and 2-allyloxybenzaldehyde. It should be noted that the reaction of isorhodanine with 2-allyloxybenzaldehyde yielded a mixture of trans-76 and cis-76a isomers (5:1). The authors proposed a probable mechanism of this reaction through the exo-selective cyclization of the 5-arylidene intermediate in hetero-Diels-Alder reaction, while the formation of endo-intermediate is a minor process. Recrystallization from dioxane can provide individual trans isomer 76 [53] . Tetracyclic derivatives 76,77 were synthesized alternatively via the "domino" thionation-hetero-Diels-Alder reaction of 5-(2-allyloxyphenylmethylidene)-4-thiazolidinones 78 [54] .

So, one of the examples of thiopyranothiazole scaffold synthesis is obtaining of series of chromeno [4 ,3 :4,5] thiopyrano [2,3-d] thiazole-2-(thi)ones 76,77 and isothiochromeno[4a,4-d] thiazole-2-ones 75 in the domino Knoevenagel-hetero-Diels-Alder reaction (Scheme 26) of isorhodanine with 3,7-dimethyl-6-octenal ((±)citronelal) and 2-allyloxybenzaldehyde.

Tetracyclic derivatives 76,77 were synthesized alternatively via the "domino" thionation-hetero-Diels-Alder reaction of 5-(2-allyloxyphenylmethylidene)-4-thiazolidinones 78 [54] .
The NH-acidic center of the basic core of the compound 76 predetermined its further transformations (Scheme 27) through the stage of potassium salt 79 formation with the following alkylation with chloroacetamides, bromoacetophenones, ethyl chloroacetate that allowed obtaining new N-substituted derivatives 80-82 [55] . Another example of the domino Knoevenagel-hetero-Diels-Alder reaction (Scheme 29) is the interaction of isorhodanine with structural analogs of 2-allyloxybenzaldehyde-2-(2-methylallyloxy)and 2-(cyclohexene-2-yloxy)benzaldehydes, 2-allyloxynaphthalaldehyde as well as 2-formylphenyl-(E)-3-aryl-2-propenoates. These reactions allowed preparing a series of pentacyclic derivatives characterized by trans-(86-88) or cis-configuration (89) of 5a and 11b protons [53] . Interestingly, that when 2-formylphenyl-(E)-3-aryl-2-propenoates are used as reagents stereoconfiguration of final products 89 were similar to the derivatives 68 obtained in tandem acylation-hetero-Diels-Alder reaction (Scheme 22). Stereochemistry of final compounds depends on the endo-and exo-orientation of the dienophile in transition state. The presence of allyl moiety in the molecule induces exo-transition state, in contrast to cinnamoyl fragment which causes endo-orientation of the dienophile due to the orbital interactions. Another example of the domino Knoevenagel-hetero-Diels-Alder reaction (Scheme 29) is the interaction of isorhodanine with structural analogs of 2-allyloxybenzaldehyde-2-(2-methylallyloxy)and 2-(cyclohexene-2-yloxy)benzaldehydes, 2-allyloxynaphthalaldehyde as well as 2-formylphenyl-(E)-3-aryl-2-propenoates.

The reaction of isorhodanine with 2-(2-propynoxy)benzaldehyde in the medium of acetic acid in the presence of catalytic amount of sodium acetate did not stop on the formation of expected 3,11b-dihydro-2H,6H-chromeno [4 ,3 :4,5] thiopyrano [2,3-d] thiazole-2-one 92. The latter underwent spontaneous oxidation yielding 6H-chromeno [4 ,3 :4,5] thiopyrano [2,3-d] thiazole-4-ium-2-olate 93.

One of the efficient and freguently used directions of search for new active compounds is based on the principle of privileged structures annealing in the condensed systems. This approach involves combination of different heterocyclic pharmacophores in one molecule and can be successfully illustrated by thiopyrano [2,3-d] thiazoles. Taking into account that thiopyrano [2,3-d] thiazole derivatives are cyclic isosteric mimetics of 5-ene-4-thiazolidinones without typical Michael acceptors properties, the study of possible biological activity of these compounds is of great interest.

In general, antimicrobial, antifungal and antimycobacterial profiles were among the first types of biological activities described for the thiopyranothiazoles ( Figure 5 ). In particular, in the screening of structurally simple thiopyrano [2,3-d] thiazoles using the disk-diffusion method moderate/high antimicrobial and antifungal activities against Pseudomonas lachrymans, Erwinia toxica, Penicillium simplex, Ulocladium chertorium and Aspergillus oryzae were identified for the derivatives 101 and 102.

One of the most popular and promising directions of the fused 4-thiazolidinone derivatives investigation is the search for anticancer agents. However, unlike monocyclic 4-thiazolidinones, the mechanism of their antitumor activity is not well understood yet. Moreover, quite often, biophore fragments of the active 4-thiazolidinone derivatives save their pharmacological effect in the new polycyclic scaffold. The latter may be considered as an argument in favour of the given class of compounds as a source of «small drug-like molecules», in particular anticancer agents. Thus, among fused polycyclic thiazolothiopyranes a large number of compounds characterized by the high inhibition rates and/or cytostatic activity towards cell lines of leukemia, non-small cell lung cancer, renal cancer, melanoma, ovarian cancer, breast cancer, prostate and CNS cancer were identified. A series of N-substituted chromeno[4′,3′:4,5]thiopyrano[2,3-d]thiazoles revealed sufficiently high level of growth inhibition of different cancer cells with the avarage logGI50 values from −4.49 to −6.22 in the in vitro studies ( Figure 6 ).

The most active were compounds with the ester-106, N-trifluoromethylphenyland 3,4-dichlorophenyl-acetamide fragments (107,108) in the molecules that were characterized by the cytostatic effects against a panel of cancer cell lines. On the other hand, 4-methylphenylacetamide substituent in the N3 position of tetracycle increased its selective activity against leukemia cell lines, which was observed at submicromolar concentrations (logGI 50 = −6.93 for CCRF-CEM and < −8.00 for HL-60(TB)), whilst its inhibition activity against other cancer cells turned out to be relatively low [55] .

One of the promising and quite new directions of thiazolidinone derivative investigations is the search for potent anti-parasitic agents, namely compounds exhibiting antitrypanosomal activity. Trypanosomiasis belongs to the so called world's neglected diseases caused by Trypanosoma spp. [64] .

The efficient approaches to the thiopyranothiazoles scaffolds synthesis are outlined in this review. One of the most studied synthetic protocol for thiopyranothiazoles is the hetero-Diels-Alder [4+2]-cycloaddition being rather fast and efficient method that yields good outcomes and stereoselectivity of the products. The tandem processes based on hetero-Diels-Alder and Michael reactions used for the thiopirano[2,3-d]thiazoles synthesis have also been discussed. In contrast to the well discribed various synthetic routes of thiopyranothiazoles synthesis, biological activity of these derivatives have not been studied that much. Nevertheless, they are considered as 5-ene-4-thiazolidinone synthetic biomimetics that save pharmacological profile without revealing Michael acceptors properties. Among established biological activities of the thiopyrano[2,3-d]thiazole derivatives, the anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, anticancer as well as aniparasitic activities are the most prominent and need further in-depth studies. Considering all the above, the directed search for new drug-like molecules and possible chemotherapeutic agents among thiopyrano[2,3-d]thiazole derivatives is justified and promising direction in the medicinal chemistry. Moreover, the way of annealing of thiazolidine core into thiopyranothiazole analogs is used as one of the molecular optimization directions to decrease the toxicity and/or avoid the Michael acceptor properties as well.
