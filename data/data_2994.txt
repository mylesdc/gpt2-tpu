Hsp42p has physical association with Fus3p [17] .
Protein expression is induced by stresses such as heat shock, salt shock and starvation [18] , which might also contribute to the phosphorylation level change that we detected. 11 PWP1 4 -In the stringent correlation network, PWP1 has positive correlation with SPT6.

The PUF6 deletion strain has decreased resistance to multiple chemical stresses [19] [20] [21] and is more sensitive to both cold [22] and heat [23] . 13 SPT6 3
(1) Filamentous growth decreases when SPT6 is disrupted [14] . Refer to SGD. (2) SPT6 has a genetic interaction with RAS2 [24] which regulates filamentous growth [25] . (3) Spt6p has physical interaction with Kss1p [4] .

(4) Overexpression of the SSD1 homologue, ropy, in N. crassa has been shown to suppress mutations of POD6 and COT1 which play essential roles in hyphal tip extension [34] , a process required for filamentous growth.
Required for thermotolerance [35] and migrates to stress granules [36] . Figure S1 . Top clusters selected by tight clustering. The phosphopeptides commonly identified in 4 -8 KD-versus-WT conditions were used. After missing value being imputed, the tight cluster method [50] was used to pick out the top tightest and stablest clusters. R package tightClust was used, adopting the suggested parameters. R code: tight.clust(data.impute, target, k.min=15, random.seed=12345), the value of target is 5, 8 and 10, respectively, for A, B and C. The columns of a map correspond to SKS1-KD, STE20-KD, SNF1-KD, TPK2-KD, ELM1-KD, FUS3-KD, KSS1-KD and KSP1-KD. The rows correspond to phosphopeptides. A -Top 5 tight clusters were sequentially selected, and plotted on the top. The order of stability decreases from the top down. Scattered peptides were not clustered. B -Top 8 tight clusters sequentially selected. C -Top 10 tight clusters sequentially selected. Evidence view Figure S2 . STRING reported inner connections of the globally significant proteins. The network was generated using STRING v9.0 [51, 52] using the default parameters with median confidence. A -Confidence view. The thicker the edge it, the more confidence the interaction is. B -Evidence view. Different colors of the edges indicate different evidence types.
