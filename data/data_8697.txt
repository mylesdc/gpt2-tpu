In order to find infectious disease clusters using time, place, and genetic information, Ypma et al [1] have developed an algorithm to combine into one metric pairwise distances between cases on all three data dimensions. The algorithm sorts cases by relatedness on all three dimensions and subsequently defines a relative distance for all possible pairs of cases reflecting the number of cases found in between the two cases. For the time dimension (dtime), this is defined as the number of cases with a disease onset date between the disease onset dates of the two cases. For the place (dgeo) and genetic (dgen) dimensions, cases are sorted by Euclidean distance and number of point mutations respectively to define pairwise relative distances. The relative distances (dissimilarities) for each dimension are calculated, the combined (time, place, genetic) dissimilarity (dcombi) between every pair of cases is then defined as the product of the separate dimension dissimilarities: dcombi = dtime x dgeo x dgen. Next, the cases are joined to form a hierarchical tree of related cases, based on dcombi, using single-linkage clustering, i.e. a bottom-up approach that sequentially connects cases with the smallest dcombi. We use single-linkage clustering as it very well resembles the chainlike structure of transmission clusters [1] . The result of this step is a tree in which the height represents dcombi. Figure S1 .

Cases (A-E) are sequentially connected by smallest distance d combi (a) to form a hierarchical clustering tree in which height represents d combi (b)
