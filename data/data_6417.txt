1 Supplementary Information. Protocols and primers used for screening bird samples cDNA for influenza screening was synthesized using a Superscript II kit (Invitrogen) in a 20-µl reaction mixture following the manufacturer's protocol with 11.5-µl of RNA and a 10µM concentration of a Uni-12 specific primer (5'-AGCAAAAGCAGG-3'). A 5x RT Buffer, 0.1M dithiothreitol (DTT), 10mM deoxynucleoside triphosphate mix (dNTP), and 200U of SuperScript II RT. Samples were tested for influenza A using a Taqman qPCR assay designed to amplify a conserved region of the matrix gene. A 25-µl reaction was used containing 2x RT Buffer (Biorad), 10µM forward and reverse primer, 20µM probe, and 4-µl of cDNA Complementary DNA was also synthesized from RNA with random hexamers using a Superscript II kit (Invitrogen) following manufacturer's protocols. This cDNA was screened for astroviruses, coronaviruses, flaviviruses, and paramyxoviruses in an Applied Biosystems Veriti 96 well thermocycler. Astrovirus detection followed a heminested protocol where a 25-µl initial reaction was used containing 1x buffer Taq (Thermo   Scientific) . After an initial denaturation period at 94°C for 3 minutes, 30 cycles of amplification were carried out with a denaturation step at 94°C for 30 seconds, annealing at 50°C for 30 seconds, and extension at 68°C for 30 seconds. This was followed by a final extension at 68°C for 5 minutes before being held at 10°C until removal from the thermocycler. The heminested step used 1-µl of the first round PCR product as template and follows the same protocol as the first PCR (2).
Coronaviruses were tested with a PCR final volume of 25-µl containing a 1x buffer (Thermo Scientific), 0.2mM dNTP mix, 0.5 µM F and R primer (Corfor: 5'-GGTTGGGACTATCCTAAGTGTGA -3', Correv: 5' -CCATCATCAGATAGAATCATCAT-3'), 1mM MgCl 2 , and 1.25 units of Taq (Thermo Scientific). cDNA synthesized from RNA with random hexamers was used as a template. After an initial denaturation period at 95°C for 2 minutes, 40 cycles of amplification were carried out with a denaturation step at 95°C for 15 seconds, annealing at 48°C for 30 seconds, and extension at 68°C for 1 minute. This was followed by a final extension at 68°C for 5 minutes before being held at 10°C until removal from the thermocycler (3).
Paramyxoviruses were tested using a heminested PCR protocol where a 25-µl initial reaction was used containing 1x buffer (Thermo Scientific), 0.2mM dNTP mix, 0.5 µM F1, F2, and R primer (ParaF1: 5'-GAAGGITATTGTCAIAARNTNTGGAC-3', ParaF2: 5'-GTTGCTTCAATGGTTCARGGNGAYAA-3', ParaR: 5'-GCTGAAGTTACIGGITCICCDATRTTNC -3'), 1mM MgCl 2 , and 1.25 units of Taq (Thermo Scientific). cDNA synthesized from random hexamers were used as a template. After an initial denaturation period at 94°C for 2 minutes, 35 cycles of amplification were carried out with a denaturation step at 94°C for 15 seconds, annealing at 49°C for 30 seconds, and extension at 72°C for 1 minute. This was followed by a final extension at 72°C for 5 minutes before being held at 10°C until removal from the thermocycler. The heminested step used 1-µl of the first round PCR product and follows the same protocol as the first PCR (4).
Flaviviruses were screened for using a PCR with a final volume of 25-µl containing a 1x buffer (Thermo Scientific), 0.2mM dNTP mix, 0.5 µM F and R primer (VIR2217F: 5'-TGTGTCTACAACATGATGGGAAAGAGAGA-3', VIR2217F: 5'-TGCTCCCAGCCACATGTACCA-3'), 1mM MgCl 2 , and 1.25 units of Taq (Thermo Scientific). cDNA synthesized from random hexamers were used as a template. After an initial denaturation period at 95°C for 2 minutes, there were 8 cycles of 95°C for 30 seconds, 48°C for 30 seconds, and 72°C for 30 seconds, followed by 37 cycles of 95°C for 15 seconds, 56°C for 20 seconds, and 72°C for 20 seconds culminating with a 2 minute extension at 72°C and held at 10°C until processing (5) .
