Supplementary Figure 1: Schematic representation of the HCV replicons. Schematic representation of subgenomic (top) and full-length (bottom) HCV replicons. The genotype and the name of plasmids are indicated in italic. RLuc: Renilla Luciferase; FLuc: Firefly Luciferase; Neo: neomycine resistance gene; EMCV: internal ribosome entry site of the encephalomyocarditis virus; NS: non-structural; C: core; E: envelope; GT: genotype. Supplementary Figure 2: Cellular toxicity of C31 and ALV in Huh7.5 and MRC5 cells. Cellular toxicity of C31 (black circle) and ALV (open triangle) was evaluated in Huh7.5 cells (A) and MRC5 cells (B) by means of a MTT assay.
and CsA (C), as quantified by RT-qPCR. 
SMCypI compounds (C31, C32, C34, C35 and C36) synthesis was performed as described in our previous report (1) . The synthesis of compound C33 was performed as described in Scheme 1. Ester S1 (330 mg, 0.90 mmol) was dissolved in 10 ml of MeOH and 10 ml of water, LiOH (86 mg, 3.60 mmol, 4.00 equiv) was added and the reaction mixture was heated to 50Â°C for 2 h. The reaction mixture was concentrated and 100 ml of water was added; it was then extracted twice with AcOEt. The aqueous phase was acidified to pH 3 with concentrated HCl 36%, then extracted twice with AcOEt. The combined organic phase was dried over Na 2 SO 4 , filtered and concentrated to yield S2 (283 mg, 93%) as a white solid. 1
