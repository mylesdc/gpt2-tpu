Notations: R g , radius of gyration; D max , maximum size of the particle; V p , excluded volume of the hydrated particle; MM , molecular mass;   ab values for the fit from ab initio models using DAMMIN.
Supplementary Fig. 1 . Native agarose gel electrophoresis of wt and ΔG4 PrP octa-repeat mRNA.
Different salts promote oligomerization of wt and ΔG4 PrP octa-repeat mRNA. MgCl 2 addition causes fragmentation of RNA.
