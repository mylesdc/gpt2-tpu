A Supporting Information Figure 1 A. Design of 9-, 10-, 11-mer peptides derived from the 15-mer antigen. Overlapping 9-, 10-, 11-mer peptides were each tested for their capability to stabilize the corresponding HLA. A total of 18 different peptides were derived from each 15-mer peptide.
IT-TOF. The mass to charge ratios (m/z) of peptides were measured after liquid chromatography (LC) separation on a C18 column. As both isomers of the photocleavable 3-amino-3-(2nitro) phenyl-propanoic acid (Anp) used during solid phase peptide synthesis of the conditional ligand, 2 diasteroisomers could usually be identified. In some cases, however, the two isomers failed to separate during chromatography. The data displayed is for one of the two isomers, mostly for doubly charged molecules (M 2+ ), together with the amino acid sequences of conditional ligands where the letter J represents Anp.
A. Cells were first analyzed for their size and granularity based on their forward scatter area (FSC-A) and side scatter area (SSC-A) profile. Doublets were excluded using side-scatter height (SSC-H) vs side-scatter width (SSC-W) and forward-scatter height (FSC-H) vs forwardscatter width (FSC-W) parameters. Cells present in all three gates were analyzed for their time vs forward scatter area (FSC-A) to exclude cells that were read at the beginning and end of the flow cytometry run. Viable cells were gated based on their negative staining with the Live/DeadÂ® dye (Invitrogen), and these cells were finally analyzed for anti-human CD8 antibodies and HLA-tetramer stainings. All data were analyzed using FlowJo (Tree Star C. Culturing of PBMCs to develop antigen-specific T cell lines. PBMCs isolated from healthy volunteers' blood were stimulated by antigens from EBV-LMP2419-427 (TYGPVFMSL) or HCMV-IE-142-50 (KEVNSQLSL) and cultured in 25 U/mL IL-2, 5% AB serum in RPMI for 14 days. HLA tetramer staining for antigen-specific T cells was performed on day 0, 7, 10 and 14 days post stimulation.
