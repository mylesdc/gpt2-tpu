The last model has the largest likelihood. We also perform a total of 100 bootstraps to estimate the variance of the result by randomly selecting the real data. We found the variance of likelihood in the last model is much smaller compared with other models (see Figure 3 legend). Table S31 : Nucleotide composition of di↵erently masked assemblies. The following repeat-masking tools were applied: RM -RepeatMasker [3] , TRF -Tandem Repeat Finder [4] , kmer -the k-mer based approach ( Figure S15 ; Subsection of "Materials and Methods"). SL denotes filtration of sca↵olds by their length; short sca↵olds were removed.
