Farnesyltransferase has been regarded as a promising drug target against cancer as it is critical for membrane association of several signal transduction proteins. In this study, a novel farnesyltransferase inhibitor (IMB-1406) was identified through virtual screening. It exhibits stronger potency (IC 50 s: 6.92-8.99 μM) than Sunitinib against all of the tested cancer cell lines. Preliminary studies on mechanism reveal that IMB-1406 induces apoptosis in HepG2 cells by arresting the cell cycle at the S phase, altering anti-and pro-apoptotic proteins leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and activation of caspase-3. This anti-tumor effect is most probably related to the inhibition of farnesyltransferase as indicated by molecular docking. Overall, IMB-1406 is a novel lead compound with potent antitumor activity and deserves further structural modifications.
Cancers still remain the second leading cause of death worldwide after cardiovascular diseases [1] . Many classes of antitumor agents, especially tyrosine kinase (TK) inhibitors, have been introduced to the market during the last decade, and more candidates are now under development [2] . However, given the emergence of drug resistance and the low success rate in clinical development, the discovery of novel chemical compounds with a completely new mode of action is clearly needed.
The Ras genes encode more than 100 proteins, collectively known as the Ras superfamily, which are involved in the regulation of proliferation, differentiation, cell adhesion and apoptosis of cells. Some of these proteins are small G proteins that transducer signals from cellsurface receptors, such as growth factor receptors, and then transmit the signals to several different pathways, ultimately affect mitogenic functions such as DNA synthesis, cytoskeletal organization and lipid metabolism. Disruption of these signal transduction pathways through mutation of the Ras genes involved in many tumor types [3] .
Farnesylation is a type of lipid modification called protein prenylation that is critical for biological functionality, including membrane association of several signal transduction proteins. Oncogenically mutant forms of human Ras superfamily proteins are associated with 30% of all human cancers; the transforming ability of these mutants is dependent upon farnesylation. More recently, farnesyltransferase has become popular drug targets [4, 5] . Inhibitors of farnesyltransferase cause tumor regression in animals and are currently being evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of human cancers [6] [7] [8] . Farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTIs) that have been or are being investigated in clinical trials include lonafarnib (SCH66336; Sarasar TM ; Schering-Plough), tipifarnib (R115777; Zarnestra TM ; Ortho BiotechProducts), L778123 (Merck), BMS-214662 (Bristol-MyersSquibb), and salirasib (S-trans,trans-farnesylthiosalycilic acid, FTS, Concordia Pharmaceuticals) [9] . However, none
Oncotarget 24636 www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget of these have yet been approved by FDA for clinical treatments. Therefore, it is imperative to develop more new FTIs.
Computer-aided drug design is one of most effective methods in developing new drugs. Many reports have indicated that computational method is a time-saving and effort-saving approach to discover new candidates including molecular docking [10] , virtual screening [11] , and 3DQSAR [12, 13] . Virtual screening (VS) has emerged as a powerful approach to complement the array of existing high-throughput screening technologies [14, 15] . Using computer-aided VS, potential leads can be rapidly identified in silico in order to narrow the range of molecules to be tested in vitro and in vivo. In this study, virtual screening was used as a 3D query in an in-house chemical database over 900 compounds screening to retrieve potential FTIs.
Virtual screening of chemical databases can serve the purpose of finding novel potential leads suitable for further development. Molecular docking technology which has been increasingly used in the course of drug research and development is the representative of receptor-based virtual screening [16, 17] . In this paper, molecular docking experiments were carried out using Discovery Studio 2.5 software (Accelrys Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) with fully automated docking tool using "CDOCKER" protocol [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] employing CHARMm force field to investigate the possible inhibitors for farnesyltransferase. The CDOCKER energy (-(protein-ligand interaction energies)) of best poses docked into the receptor of all the 900 compounds was calculated and compared with that of Compound 4 which is a new potent farnesyltransferase inhibitor based on the ethylenediamine scaffold. As a result, IMB-1406 was found to have the highest CDOCKER energy and similar structural framework to the crystallized inhibitor (Compound 4) [23] of farnesyltransferase, as shown in Figure 1 .
According to the docking result, the most active compound IMB-1406 and the Compound 4 are found to bind in the active pocket of farnesyltransferase receptor in a similar conformation ( Figure 2 ). As described above, both the para-benzonitrile moiety of the Compound 4 and the 6-bromo-2-methoxyquinoline one of IMB-1406 are oriented toward the product exit groove and are partially stabilized by a stacking interaction with Y361β. In Figure 2B , there are three hydrogen bonding interactions between the N22 and O33 positions of IMB-1406 and R202β. This is consistent with the -CDOCKER_INTERACTION_ENERGY between the two compounds and the farnesyltransferase. The highest -CDOCKER_INTERACTION_ENERGY was 52.24 for IMB-1406 and that of Compound 4 was 57.22, suggesting that IMB-1406 could have similar affinity with the Compound 4 and the farnesyltransferase might be one of the possible targets for IMB-1406.
Detailed synthetic pathway to compound IMB-1406 is depicted in Scheme 1. Treatment of ethambutol (EMB, 1) with tert-butyldimethylsilyl chloride (TBDMSCl) gave the desired bis-TBDMS-protected compound 2. The coupling of the resulting diamine 2 with intermediate 3 (22) and then deprotection of the hydroxyl groups with tetrabutylammonium fluoride (TBAF) in tetrahydrofuran (THF) yielded the target compound IMB-1406 (Scheme 1).
For preliminary screening of antitumor activity, IMB-1406 was first investigated for cytotoxic activity against A549 (lung adenocarcinoma), MCF-7 (breast cancer), DU145 (prostate carcinoma) and HepG2 (liver carcinoma). Then the compound was further evaluated for its in vitro anti-tumor activity against the aforementioned four human cancer cell lines by the MTT assay. The inhibition rate and IC 50 values were compared with those of Sunitinib, a multitargeted receptor TK inhibitor [24] (Table 1) . IMB-1406 exhibits remarkable anti-tumor activity (inhibition rate: 99.93%-100.39%, IC 50 s: 6.92-8.99 μM) which is better than Sunitinib (inhibition rate: 86.51%-100.02%, IC 50 s: 7.60-10.36 μM) against these cancer cell lines, and thus is selected as the lead compound for preliminary mechanism study on the growth inhibition of HepG2 cells.
To understand the mechanisms underlying the action of IMB-1406, the effects of IMB-1406 on HepG2 cell cycle were examined. HepG2 cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of IMB-1406 for 72 h and stained with propidium iodide (PI), followed by flow cytometry analysis. As shown in Figure 3 , the percentages of HepG2 cells in the S phase are 28.17% (2 μM), 36.96% (4 μM) and 37.25% (8 μM), respectively, which are significantly higher than that of the vehicle treated controls (26.43%). Hence, IMB-1406 inhibits the growth of the cancer cells by inhibiting the cell cycle via S-phase arrest.
Apoptosis plays a central role in cancer treatment, since its induction in cancer cells is critical to a successful therapy [25, 26] . It is thus believed that apoptosis assay may provide important information to the preliminary investigation of the mode of action. The impact of IMBwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget 13 by Annexin V/PI staining followed by flow cytometry analysis. As shown in Figure 4 , treatment of HepG2 cells with IMB-1406 for 72 h results in an increase of the apoptosis ratios from 8.9% (untreated vehicle control) to 17.15% (2 μM), 35.40% (4 μM) or 57.51% (8 μM), indicating that IMB-1406 is able to induce apoptotic cell death in HepG2 cells in a concentration-dependent manner.
In order to determine the plausible pathway by which IMB-1406 triggers cell apoptosis, the changes of mitochondrial membrane potential were assessed. The uptake of 5,5′,6,6′-tetrachloro -1,1′,3,3′tetraethylbenzimidazol-carbocyanine iodide (JC-1), a lipophilic cationic fluorescent dye accumulated in mitochondria, is positively correlated with the mitochondrial membrane potential [27] . HepG2 cells were treated with different concentrations (0, 2, 4, 8 μM) of IMB-1406 for 72 h prior to staining with JC-1. Then the numbers of cells with collapsed mitochondrial membrane potential in different cell groups were determined by flow cytometric analysis. As shown in Figure 5 , the percentage of cells with typical apoptotic morphology increases in a dose-dependent fashion (0.53%, 6.14%, 13.8% and 34.92%, respectively). Our results reveal that incubation with IMB-1406 increases the number of cells with collapsed mitochondrial membrane potentials and induces apoptosis. 
Mitochondria play an essential role in cell death signal transduction. The mitochondria-dependent apoptotic pathway is regulated by the Bcl-2 family of pro-and antiapoptotic proteins, which induce the permeabilization of the mitochondrial outer membrane, resulting in the activation of the caspase cascade and the induction of apoptotic cell death [28, 29] . To explore the possible role of a mitochondrial-related pathway in IMB-1406induced apoptosis, the effects of IMB-1406 on the levels of Bax, Bcl-2 and caspase-3 were examined by Western blot analysis. As shown in Figure 6 , IMB-1406 treatment shows concentration-dependent effects in upregulating the expressions of Bax and downregulating Bcl-2. In addition, caspase-3 is activated in a concentration-dependent manner after treatment with IMB-1406 at 2 μM, 4 μM and 8 μM for 72 h. These results reveal that IMB-1406 induces apoptosis in HepG2 cancer cells via a mitochondriadependent pathway.
The representative crystal structure of farnesyltransferase (PDB ID 3E30) was obtained from the Protein DataBank. Initially there was a pretreatment process for both the ligands and the enzymes. For ligand preparation, all the duplicate structures were removed and options for ionization change, tautomer generation, isomer generation, Lipinski filter and 3D generator were set true. For enzyme preparation, the whole enzyme was selected, waters were removed and hydrogen atoms were added to it. The pH of theprotein was set in the range of 6.5 to 8.5. Then we defined the enzyme as a total receptor and the binding site was defined by selecting the important amino acids for catalysis to generate a 10 Å radius sphere by the operation of Define and Edit Binding Site.
