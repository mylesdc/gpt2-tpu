We applied Seasonal-Trend Decomposition method based on locally weighted regression, also known as STL as a filtering procedure to decompose monthly influenza A and influenza A/H5 occurrence time series data in to trends, seasonal and remainder components by using a weighted polynomial regression [1, 2] to understand seasonality and trends of the influenza viruses in the poultry brought to the live bird markets.
The equation above describes the components of the STL model, where Yi is the element of the original time series (e.g. influenza A and H5 monthly detection data), Ti is the element for the trend variation which can be describes as low frequency variation in data along with nonstationary, consistent changes in level. Si represents the seasonal component consisting variations in data within each seasonal frequency, here the length of each cycle is 1 year. The remainder (Ri) component consists of the data not explained by the trend and the seasonality. The gray bar at the right hand side of each category of the graph (Figure 3 , Appendix: Figure 2 ) allows relative comparison of the magnitude of each components.
