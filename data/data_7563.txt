: The phylogenetic tree of the 11 AMF sequences constructed by ClustalW method using MEGA package[a]. Figure S2: The phylogenetic tree of the 16S rDNA sequences from 40 bacterial isolates constructed by ClustalW method using MEGA package[a].
: Phylogenetic tree of 41 mitochondrial genome sequences based on multiple encoding vector method [b] . The 8 clusters are Primates (red), Cetacea (green), Artiodactyla (pink), Perissodactyla (light green), Rodentia (black), Lagomorpha (dark red), Carnivore (blue), and Erinaceomorpha (grey).
