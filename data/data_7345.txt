Yield 79%; mp 249-251°C (dec.) recrystallized from toluene. 
The two enantiomers of the racemic DD 363 were separated at 25°C by normal phase HPLC on a chiral column (Chiralpak ® IB (250 x 4,6 mm); Chiral Technologies, Illkirch France) eluting with ethanol as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 1 ml/min, coupled to a polarimeter. The detection wavelength was 254 nm.
The two enantiomers, eluting at 4.71 min (+) and 7.71 min (-), respectively, were obtained satisfactorily pure on a 100 mg scale of each enantiomer after evaporation of the solvent (3).

Yield 72 %; mp >260°C (dec.) recrystallized from chloroform. The two non-nitrated derivatives JP42 and JP46 were prepared in their racemic forms starting from the appropriate 4-hydroxycoumarine (8 mmol) and 3-(2-nitrovinyl)-1H-indole (4 mmol) by heating the mixture at 80°C in dimethylsulfoxide (25 mL) for 16 hours in the presence of potassium carbonate (2.5 mmol) . The reaction was monitored by TLC (eluent hexane/ethyl acetate 8/2). After evaporation of the solvent, the obtained material was taken up with dichloromethane. The solution was washed three times with water and the organic layer was dried (MgSO4). Filtration, followed by evaporation of the solvent under vacuum, provided a crude product which was chromatographed on silicagel (100g, eluent hexane/ethyl acetate 1/1) to afford the wanted product which was further recrystallized (Scheme 1).
