The table gives the details of the viruses that acted as marker viruses for protocol optimisation. Each of these viruses was isolated/present from/in different samples. *Nucleic acid isolated after homogenization of the spiked sample # Nucleic acid isolated at the end of the variations
The table displays the Ct value of marker viruses, which were used as a reference for identifying how different virus enrichment combinations affected each virus type. For the "Start" Ct value, we took the spiked sample after homogenization and isolated the nucleic acid as per the described method. The "End" Ct value was determined using the nucleic acids isolated at the end stage of each variation. As there was an increase in more than 3Ct values, for one of the marker virus (IBV), we discontinued variation A and B. All other variations were processed for NGS. The table displays the number of high quality (Q20 or higher) NGS reads obtained for each marker virus from the spiked sample variations C to F. This was calculated manually from IGV. We used the reference genome mentioned in Table S1 for each of the marker viruses. The table points towards the molecular phylogenetic analysis by Maximum Likelihood method of APMV6. The first half of the table provides details to identify the sample from which the virus was isolated, protein that encodes the consensus sequences that are being analysed, the length of the consensus sequences thus providing the depth of the gene being analysed, minimum mapping quality threshold used in IGV for the generation of the consensus sequences, the coverage of the consensus sequences from IGV, the year of collection of the sample and the NCBI accession number assigned to the particular consensus sequence. Corresponding short names have been used in the phylogenetic trees which contain the sample, virus, protein and the number of nucleotides. The second half of the table provides the details of the sequences that were used for the molecular phylogenetic analysis. They were found to be the most closely related sequences to the consensus sequences generated using BLASTN. Corresponding short names have been used in the phylogenetic trees which contain the NCBI accession number, virus and the country of collection.
The collection date is given as retrieved from the corresponding NCBI nucleotide reference dataset which together with the country of collection can provide an insight into the possible evolution of the virus through the years.

Corresponding short names have been used in the phylogenetic trees which contain the sample, virus, protein and the number of nucleotides. In case of the amino acid sequence analysis, the short names contain the "aa" after the protein.

Corresponding short names have been used in the phylogenetic trees which contain the NCBI accession number, virus and the country of collection. The collection date is given as retrieved from the corresponding NCBI nucleotide reference dataset which together with the country of collection can provide an insight into the possible evolution of the virus through the years.
The evolutionary history was inferred by using the Maximum Likelihood method based on the Tamura 3-parameter model 4 . The tree with the highest log likelihood (-899.41 ) is shown. The percentage of trees in which the associated taxa clustered together is shown next to the branches. Initial tree(s) for the heuristic search were obtained automatically by applying Neighbor-Join and BioNJ algorithms to a matrix of pairwise distances estimated using the Maximum Composite Likelihood (MCL) approach, and then selecting the topology with superior log likelihood value. A discrete Gamma distribution was used to model evolutionary rate differences among sites (5 categories (+G, parameter = 0.4004)). The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths measured in the number of substitutions per site. The analysis involved 7 nucleotide sequences. Codon positions included were 1st+2nd+3rd+Noncoding. All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated. There were a total of 277 positions in the final dataset. Evolutionary analyses were conducted in MEGA7 2 .
