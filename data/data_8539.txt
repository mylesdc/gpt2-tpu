CoV) is a new member of the Betacoronavirus genus. It was first detected in 2012 in samples of an infected human and was later found to be related to camels (1, 2) . MERS-CoV is a positivesense, single-stranded RNA (2) .
The first complete genome of MERS-CoV from an infected dromedary camel (Camelus dromedarius) in Egypt was named NRCE-HKU205 and deposited in GenBank under accession number KJ477102 (3). Here, we report the near full genome sequence of another MERS-CoV detected through systematic surveillance in Egypt. It was detected in the nasal swab from a healthy adult dromedary camel collected on 17 December 2014 from an abattoir in Cairo, Egypt.
Viral RNA was extracted using a QIAmp viral RNA minikit (Qiagen, Germany). Reverse transcription was performed using the Superscript III system (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) with random hexamers. The cDNA was subjected to 11 PCRs to generate overlapping amplicons covering the full-length MERS-CoV genome as previously described (4) . The PCR products were purified from agarose gels using a QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen). Purified amplicons were Sanger sequenced according to the primer/amplicon combinations (123 sequencing reactions) as shown previously (4) To further investigate the genetic relationship between Egyptian MERS-CoVs and other strains whose genomes are available in GenBank, we performed whole-genome phylogenetic analysis using MEGA 5 (5) . Egyptian strains fell into a cluster distinct from other MERS-CoVs detected elsewhere.
Sequence analysis was performed using BioEdit (6) . Egyptian MERS-CoVs had 14 characteristic amino acids (aa) in the ORF1ab protein (Y581, F664, F1024, F1583, T1911, L1970, I2000, V2333,  C2481, L2639, T2676, S3361, I3721, M5537) . No specific aa variations were identified in the S, ORF3, ORF4a, ORF4b, E, M, and N proteins. An aa deletion that was previously identified at site 1,293 of the S protein of NRCE-HKU205 (3) was not identified in NRC163. The biological impact of such differences among MERS-CoV strains needs to be fully examined.
Nucleotide sequence accession number. The complete genome sequence of the MERS-CoV/Egypt/NRC163/2014 was deposited in GenBank under the accession number KU740200.
