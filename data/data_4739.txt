was 1.1, with a standard deviation of 0.81 (± 0.81), and was 6.6 ± 1.36 for BRDC cases. 22 Moreover, almost 94% of the control calves had a health score of 2 or less, whereas 77% of the 23 cases had scores between 5 and 8. Of the control animals that eventually converted to a case, 24 the mean health score as controls was 1.3 ± 1.01, which was similar to the mean of all controls 25 (P = 0.35). The mean health scores of the male cases was 6.52 ± 1.37, which was similar to the 26 health scores for female cases (6.6 ± 1.34, P = 0.27). In contrast, the mean health score of the 27 male controls was lower (1.06 ± 0.82,) than for the female controls (1.2 ± 0.8, P = 0.0035). 28 The mean age of the CA Holstein BRDC cases at diagnosis was 46.4 ± 8.5 days, which was very 29 similar to that of the controls (47.9 ± 8.5 days). The mean age of the cases and controls at 30 sampling differed (P = 0.0001) for the CA calves. The mean age of the male cases was 45.9 ± 8.0 31 days, which differed (P = 0.03) from the mean age of the female cases (47.1 ± 9.1). Among 32 controls, the mean age of males (47.9 ± 8.4 days) did not differ (P = 0.96) from females (47.8 ± 33 8.7 days). Likewise, there was no difference (P = 0.10) in the proportion of cases among males 34 (48.37%) and females (52.18%). 35 All of the NM calves were recorded as being anatomically female and were housed in one of 36 three calf raising facilities. Samples were collected at three calf raising programs that received 37 calves from multiple dairy farms. The first calf raising facility received calves from 7,000 of their 38 own dairy cows raised at three nearby locations. These calves were housed in California-style 39 hutches facing to the south on a gradual slope to facilitate drainage. In the winter the hutch 40 tops were lowered and the bottoms boarded up to help protect the calves from the wind. 41 Calves were watered and assessed three times per day and fed twice a day with heated milk 42 The second NM calf raising facility was similar in that calves originated from 13,000 cows from 3 48 dairies. These calves received a gallon of colostrum via esophageal tube and were intranasally 49 vaccinated against IBR as well as PI3, with vitamin B12 and Penicillin administration upon 50 arrival. Calves were housed in bungalow-style hutches made of wood that faced south on a 51 slope and had a small wire panel yard attached to the hutch. Calves were watered twice a day 52 and assessed once a day. Calves were fed a mixture of hospital milk and milk replacer. At 30 53 days of age calves were vaccinated with a modified live culture of Pasteurella haemolytica and 54 Pasteurella multocida, and at 45 and 70 days of age calves received a modified live vaccine for 55 IBR, BVD types I and II, PI3 and BRSV. Calves we4re weaned at 70 days of age. 56 The third NM calf raising facility received calves from a single 3000 cow dairy. Calves were 57 housed in plastic hutches, each with a wire yard attached to it. Hutches were not set on a slope 58 and were oriented east during the summer months and south during the winter months. Calves 59 were given 1 gallon of colostrum within the first hour of birth, and 2 quarts of colostrum were 60 given the following morning and afternoon. Calves were fed and watered twice a day. Milk, 61 consisting of pasteurized fresh milk and milk replacer, was heated and fed to the calves twice a 62 day. Calf health was assessed twice a day . The vaccination protocol for this facility included an   63  intranasal modified live vaccine for IBR and PI3 the week the calves were received, a modified   64   live vaccine for IBR, BVD types I & II, BRSV, Chauvoei-Septicum-Novyi-Sordelli-Perfringens Types C &D bacterin was administered at week 67 7. Calves were weaned at 80 days of age. 68 The mean health scores of the control heifers in NM were 1.7 ± 0.9, and 8.3 ± 1.5 for the cases. 69 The mean health score for controls (that ultimately converted to cases) at the tim87)e of 70 selection was 1.6 ± 1.2, as compared to mean scores of 8.1 ± 1.5 after conversion and 71 reclassification to case status. Mean health score for the CA and NM controls differed (P = 72 0.001), as did the mean health score for the cases (P < 0.0001), which was due to higher scores 73 in NM (Supplementary Table 1 ). The proportion of control calves that converted to cases was 74 not different (P = 0.61) between CA and NM. The mean age for calves diagnosed as a BRDC case 75 was 53.5 ± 13.0 days, which did not differ (P = 0.7) from the mean age of the matched controls 76 when sampled (53.1 ± 11.6 days). The mean age at which the calves were sampled was 77 different between the California and New Mexico populations for both cases and controls (P < 78 0.0001). 79 The combined California and New Mexico population consisted of 2,763 Holstein calves; 1,505 80 females and 1,258 males, which included 1,384 controls and 1,379 cases. The mean health 81 score for controls and cases was 1.3 ± 0.9 and 7.1 ± 1.6, respectively. The mean case and mean 82 control health scores for the combined population differed from the California (P < 0.0001) and There was also no effect (P > 0.05) when month of sampling was included in the GBLUP 225 analyses. However, when season was included in the GBLUP model, a nominally significant 226 effect of season for CA was detected (P = 0.02), with no similar effect observed for NM or the 227 combined population (P > 0.05). When further evaluated, the effect of season for CA was 228 determined to be due to the difference in the mean age of animals across the seasons. In the winter. By including season in the GBLUP model, some of the age differences were removed, 231 resulting in a significant result even though the effect was due to age. Therefore, the correct 232 analytical model was to include age (and sex) in the additive model, but not an effect for season 233 of sampling (Supplementary Table 3 Note on Supplemental Q-Q and P-P Plots: The trend observed in the Q-Q and/or P-P plots whereby the 315 expected -log10 P-values are larger than the observed was determined to be an issue related to the 316 Holstein breed and/or the samples utilized. Briefly, LD pruning prior to GWAA mitigates this trend, 317 which has never been observed during any of our ongoing QTL GWAA for beef cattle (i.e., multiple 318 breeds, thousands of samples) using the same methods employed in this study. Unfortunately, very few 319 Q-Q / P-P plots exist in the literure for U.S. Holstein cattle, and because we genotyped and analyzed ≥ 320 2,596 holstein calves, we are confident that this result will be replicated. Finally, the trend whereby the 321 expected -log10 P-values are larger than the observed -log10 P-values is less noticeable when using a 322 PCA-based approach to stratification control during a GWAA because, given the number of components 323 used, these PCA methods are not as exhaustive at correcting for stratification, as is the genomic 324 relationship matrix.
