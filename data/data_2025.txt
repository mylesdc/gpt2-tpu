The Gillespie Algorithm 693 In the section "Predicting epidemic behavior", we discussed that to use Eq. (11) to 694 project the expected behavior of an epidemic outcome Z using the accrued observation 695 Y i at time t i , one needs access to a stochastic simulator to sample from the random 696 variable Z|ν i for a given set of parameter values θ. We use the Gillespie algorithm [40] 697 for this purpose. To describe the steps of the Gillespie algorithm, we consider an 698 epidemic model with K compartments (e.g. in the model described in ➜ "Design of the 699 Performance Analysis", K = 4). Let ν(t) = (ν 1 (t), ν 2 (t), . . . , ν K (t)) denote the state of 700 the epidemic at time t, where ν k (t) denotes the number of individuals in compartment 701 k ∈ {1, 2, . . . , K} at time t.
Q r=1 Λ q (ν(t), θ) . 2. Sample the time to the next event: τ ← − 1 Λ0 ln u 1 , where u 1 is a random number drawn from a uniform distribution U ((0, 1]).
3. Determine the event that just realized: Select the eventq such that
where u 2 is another random number drawn from a uniform distribution U ((0, 1]). 4 . Update epidemic state given the realized eventr. 5 . Until a desired time condition is satisfied, increment time t ← t + τ and move to Step 1. These SITR trajectories are used to calculate the number of new diagnoses in week i 721 which is equal to T i + R i − T i−1 − R i−1 . If for a simulated trajectory the conditions on 722 attack rate (30% -50% for the mild scenario, 50%-70% for the severe scenario and 723 70%-100% for the extreme scenario) and timing of peak (between 10 and 20) are 724 fulfilled, we keep the trajectory for the respective scenarios or we otherwise we reject it. 725
Equations of the SEITR model 727 The Susceptible -Exposed -Infected -Treatment -Recovered model contains one more 728 compartment than the SITR model, namely Exposed. Disease transmission can be 729 modeled using the following ODE model:
where k 1 = k 2 = 2θ 1 and θ 1 is the disease transmission rate, θ 2 is the rate of seeking 731 treatment while infectious, and θ 3 is the rate of recovering.
In our analysis, we assume that at time t = 0 one population member becomes 733 infected. The model initial condition can therefore be defined as R 0 and duration of infectiousness: For R 0 or the mean duration of infectiousness, 741 we have f Mi|θ (m|θ) = 1, as R 0 and the mean duration of infectiousness only depend on 742 the parameter vector sampled from the posterior π i .
R eff : For R eff as the performance target, M i is defined as M i = R 0 Si N . As S is the only state that the target depends on, the function f Mi|θ (m|θ) needs to yield the probability for this state. This is accomplished by integrating over the remaining states:
Infection prevalence: If the target is the infection prevalence:
i , the function f Mi|θ (m|θ) needs to yield the probability for this state and, hence, is calculated by integrating over the remaining states.
As the I.Poi benchmark does not calculate a belief state for time t i , we use the 744 simulation model to carry out simulations with parameters according to π i (θ|Y i ) and 745 consider these simulations as a sample from the belief state Π i .
All Predictions: In case of prediction for one week, three weeks (cumulative and specific) or the attack rate, it holds f Mi|θ (m|θ) = P (m|Y i ) with P as in Eq. (9).
Median integrated relative error (mIRE): Next, we will calculate a median relative error (mIRE) over the 50 trajectories as Poi. We analyzed the computational time for the severe scenario with a population size 752 of 10000. Carrying out the 1000 stochastic simulations for benchmark I.Poi for the 1000 753 parameters takes about 100 minutes. The additional time for evaluating the likelihood 754 approximation is rather short with about only 1 second, see table 1 for numbers.
The computational times are shorter before the peak and longer after the peak, 
We note that the implementation was not carried out in a way to maximize speed, so 760 there is opportunity for additional speed up with more efficient implementation.
However, these numbers demonstrate that all the algorithms can be used on a personal 762 computer in real time. Computational time in seconds for the calibration of one time course in average for the severe scenario in the population with 10000 individuals. * The 100 min are the computational time to carried out 1000 stochastic simulations for each parameter with the Gillespie algorithm.
