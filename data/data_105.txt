R is defined to be the average number of infections generated by a typically infectious individual in an otherwise susceptible population [3] . We define the "average number of secondary cases" * 0 R to be the average number of secondary cases generated by an individual chosen at random in an otherwise susceptible population. The difference between these two definitions is somewhat technical, but can make a material difference in practice. It hinges on the word "typically" which can be taken to mean [1] "chosen with probability proportional to the components of the eigenvector associated with the largest eigenvalue of the next generation operator". If transmission is only allowed along the community route (i.e. mass-action, no household or peer-group transmission) the average of our model attack rate converges with those of the classic epidemic size calculation, i.e.
