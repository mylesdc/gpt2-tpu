. Original antigenic sin in 10-valent inactivated HRV-vaccinated mice. Mice (20 per group) were vaccinated i.m. with either PBS + alum or 2-valent (HRV-16 and HRV-76) inactivated HRV + alum in order to establish pre-existing immunity to types 16 and 76 in one group. (a) Sera were collected 18 days later and tested for nAb against HRV-16 and HRV-76. All mice were vaccinated i.m at day 28 and boosted at day 56 with 10-valent inactivated HRV that included types 16 and 76 (10-valent composition listed in Supplementary Table 2) . Sera were collected at days 46 (b) and 74 (c) and pooled for each group for nAb against the 10 types in the vacccine. Error bars show 95% confidence interval. The dashed line represents LOD. Undetectable nAb were assigned LOD/2.
. Durability of nAb response to 10-valent inactivated HRV. 20 mice were vaccinated then boosted at day 28 with 10-valent HRV. The inactivated-TCID 50 input titers per dose are specified in Supplementary Table 2. Sera were collected at days 18, 46, 128, and 230, and nAb titers against the HRV types in the vaccine were determined in pooled sera. Error bars depict 95% confidence interval. The dashed line represents LOD. Undetectable nAb were assigned LOD/2 Supplementary Fig. 3 . Minimal cross-neutralizing antibodies in rhesus macaques antisera. Two rhesus macaques (RM A and RM B) were vaccinated i.m. with 25-valent HRV + alum. The RM received an identical boost vaccination at day 28, and sera were collected at day 46. Serum nAb titers were measured against 10 types not present in this vaccine (Supplementary Table 3 ). Error bars depict 95% confidence interval. The dashed line represents LOD. Undetectable nAb were assigned LOD/2. Table 2 ). Infectious titers of the indicated HRV types in stocks produced from HeLa and WI-38 cells infected at MOI = 0.1. The grey line at 10 7 TCID50/ml shows the target titer. The experiment was replicated, and similar results were observed. Supplementary Fig. 5 . Comparison of immunogenicity of inactivated semi-purified HRV and inactivated non-purified HRV. HRV-16, HRV-36, and HRV-78 virus stocks were semi-purified as described in the Methods. Mice were vaccinated i.m. with either semi-purified 3-valent inactivated HRV with alum (20 mice) or nonpurified 3-valent inactivated HRV with alum (20 mice). HRV types and inactivated-TCID50 doses are specified in Supplementary Table 4 . Sera were collected 18 days after vaccination and pooled for each group. Serum nAb titers were measured against HRV-16, HRV-36, and HRV-78. As a negative control, sera from naïve mice were used. Error bars show 95% confidence interval. The dashed line represents LOD. Figure 6 . Purity of HRV-36 after high performance liquid chromatrography. HRV-36 propagated in H1-HeLa cells (see methods) was loaded through a HiTrap Blue HP affinity chromatography column (AC) to remove serum albumin. The input was 15 ml and 6.3 × 10 8 TCID50/ml. The virus-containing AC flowthrough was collected and loaded through a HiTrap Capto Core 700 size exclusion column (SEC). The SEC flowthrough was dialyzed overnight at 4°C in 0.1M Tris-HCl pH8 buffer, and loaded the next day on a HiTrap Q XL ion exchange column (IEC). Fractions were eluted with a 0.1M Tris-HCl pH8 buffer on a NaCl gradient; fractions showing high absorbance at 280 nm were collected for analysis. Purity of chromatographic fractions was visualized by silver stain on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. In the representative gel, IEC fraction A12 showed reduced cell protein compared to input virus stock (AC input) and distinct bands corresponding to predicted sizes of HRV-36 capsid proteins 3, 4 . Fraction A12 was 2 ml and 1.1 × 10 9 TCID50/ml. *, 37 kDa. †, 25 kDa. The formula for nAb titer. exponent of dilution factor to base 2 at dilution immediately above 50% neutralization; % neutralized at dilution immediately above 50% neutralization; % neutralized at dilution immediately below 50% neutralization.
