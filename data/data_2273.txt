Mice were intra-nasally inoculated with influenza A virus (H3N2). Three mice were sacrificed at 9 days prior to inoculation as a control, and then daily from day 0 to day 10 post-inoculation. The time-course was visualized by fitting the observed points to a third-order polynomial. OASL1 is the mouse ortholog of the human OASL gene (Elkhateeb et al., 2016) and was used in this plot.

Human rhinoviruses (HRV, Baltimore Group IV, positive-sense single-stranded RNA) are the most frequent etiological agents of respiratory tract infections in both adults and children (Heinonen et al., 2016) . Children infected with HRV display a broad spectrum of clinical signs, and questions have been raised over the etiological role of HRV in respiratory disease.
Dataset GSE67059 was generated in a study (Heinonen et al., 2016) that identified a whole blood gene expression signature for differentiating pediatric subjects with or without detectable human rhinovirus (HRV). The study included respiratory symptomatic and asymptomatic subjects as either inpatients or outpatients. Asymptomatic subjects included healthy children, and also those presenting for minor surgery that did not involve the respiratory system. GSE67059
comprised one of our validation datasets, and was not used in discovery of the pan-viral signature.
We observed differences in the pan-viral signature when comparing subjects that were HRV(-) to subjects that were HRV(+), irrespective of whether the infection-positive subjects had symptoms or were inpatients or outpatients (Supplementary Figure S1 ). Respir. Crit. Care Med. 193, 772-782 (2016) .
Dataset GSE30550 (Huang et al., 2011) was used in the discovery of the pan-viral signature. The following samples from GSE30550 were used in the discovery process: infection-negative samples taken pre-inoculation (0 hours); and infection-positive samples taken at times corresponding to peak symptom presentation (21-69 hours). Supplementary Figure S2 presents a box-and-whisker plot of the the pan-viral signature score for symptomatic human subjects, sampled over a 108 hour period following intra-nasal inoculation of influenza H3N2. A significant increase in pan-viral signature score relative to its pre-inoculation value can be seen as early as 36 hours, and reaches a maximum at 69 hours.
infection with H3N2 influenza A (Baltimore Group V). Box-and-whisker plot of the pan-viral signature score for symptomatic human subjects, based on sampling over a 108-hour period following intra-nasal inoculation of influenza H3N2. The time-course was visualized by fitting the observed points to a third-order polynomial.
A parallel time-course for earliest detection and peak score in mice (Supplementary Figure S3) in response to experimental inoculation with influenza H3N2 suggests that this virus produces a similar pan-viral signature response in the two species. 
GSE57384 is a validation dataset that was not used in discovery of the pan-viral signature. In the study represented by GSE57384 (Qiu et al., 2015) , mice were intra-nasally inoculated with influenza A virus (H3N2) and followed over time. Three mice were sacrificed at 9 days prior to inoculation as a control, and then daily from day 0 to day 10 post-inoculation. As shown in Supplementary Figure S3 , the pan-viral signature first showed a consistent increase on day 2, and peaked on day 3. It then decreased to pre-inoculation levels by day 9. A similar response curve was observed in experimental human inoculation with the same virus strain (Supplementary Figure S2) . Note: OASL1 is the mouse ortholog of the human OASL gene (Elkhateeb et al., 2016) and was used here.
To date, the chimpanzee is the only animal model for Hepatitis C (HCV) and Hepatitis E (HEV) infection in humans. Dataset GSE22160, used in validation of the pan-viral signature, was generated in a study of the temporal gene expression responses in liver biopsies from chimpanzees inoculated with either HCV or HEV (Yu et al., 2014) . Supplementary Figure S4 presents the pan-viral signature in the chimpanzee liver biopsy samples, as a function of time post-exposure, which correlated with the first detection of viral antigen in regional lymph nodes, but preceded the first detectable viremia (Day 4) or elevated body temperature (Day 5) as detailed in Table 3
