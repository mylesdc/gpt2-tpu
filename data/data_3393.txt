Supplementary Figure 1. JEV NS5 forms a dimer in the asymmetric unit and is monomeric in solution. A) Surface representation of the NS5 dimer in the asymmetric unit viewing down the pseudo 2-fold axis. Coloring scheme: molecule I MTase -lime, RdRP -
green; molecule II MTase -cyan, RdRP -blue; linker -grey. B) Maximum likelihood superimposition [1] of the two NS5 molecules in the asymmetric unit (RMSD=0.5 Ã…) shown as cartoon representation. Coloring scheme is as in panel A. C) NS5 has a retention volume around 68 mL in a superdex 200 gel filtration column, consistent with a monomeric state. that motif G of JEV NS5 adopt a canonical conformation. In a very recent report [2] , binding of an inhibitor helped resolve the missing part of motif G in the original DENV RdRP model. However, the observed conformation deviates significantly from the JEV model.
