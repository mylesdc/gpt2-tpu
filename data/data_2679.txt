Different key parameters for Bowtie2 and RAPSearch2 were computationally testing via in-silicon datasets with variable mutation rate to generate the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves in Figure 2 . Totally there were 432 combinations for Bowtie2 1 and 6 for RAPSearch2 2 .
For Bowtie2, the length of the seed substrings (L) was ranging from L7, L11, L15, L19, L23, L27, the internal function for substrings seed was ranging from i"L,1,0", i"L,2,0", i"L,4,0"
and i"L,8,0", times of seed extension attempts (D) were ranging from D5, D15, D25, maximum times of "re-seed" were ranging from R0, R1, R2 and the number of mismatches in a seed alignment were ranging from N0, N1.
The expectation value or expect value (E-value) represents the probability that a given alignment to a reference in the database was due purely to chance 3 . The lower the E-value, the more significant the alignment was. For RAPSearch2, the following cutoffs of E-value were selected for the ROC curves: Supplementary
