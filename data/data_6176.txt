Frameshifting on dnaX variants with mutations A 1 G and A 1 U. (a) Schematic of wt and mutated sequences. (b-c) Time courses of amino acid incorporation upon translation of dnaX A 1 G (b) and A 1 U (c) mRNA variants. Peptides are MAKK (gray), MAKKV (red), and MAKKF (blue). Numbers represent rate constants of amino acid incorporation, as determined by global fitting (Table 2) . Global fits are shown as continuous lines. (d-e) Efficiency of amino acid incorporation in -1-and 0-frame on A 1 G (d) and A 1 U (e) mRNA monitored at the end point of translation (60-120 s) in the presence and absence of Val-tRNA Val (V) and Phe-tRNA Phe (F) decoding the -1 and 0 frames, respectively. Ala-tRNA Ala (A) and Lys-tRNA Lys (K) were present in all experiments. The efficiency values are mean ± s.d. from independent experiments (N≥3). Fig. 3 Translation of the slippery-motif mutant A 4 G. (a) Schematic of wt and mutated sequences. (b) Codon walk over the dnaX A 4 G mRNA variant. Time courses of peptide synthesis are monitored with ribosomes programmed with A 4 G mRNA in the presence of EF-Tu, aa-tRNAs for A, K, V, F and E and EF-G. Peptides are MAKK (gray), MAKKV (red), MAKKF (blue), and MAKEV (black). Numbers represent rate constants of amino-acid incorporation, as determined by global fitting (Table 2) . Global fits are shown as continuous lines. (c) Efficiency of amino-acid incorporation in -1 and 0 frame on A 4 G complexes monitored at the end of translation (60-120 s) in the presence and absence of Val-tRNA Val (V) and Phe-tRNA Phe (F), decoding the -1 and 0 frames, respectively. Ala-tRNA Ala (A) and Lys-tRNA Lys Fig. 1b, Fig. 2d,e; Fig. 3d and in Caliskan et al. 1 . Errors are s.e.m. of the fit. QF, Quench flow. The frameshifting efficiency was calculated from end points of in vitro translation experiments shown in Fig. 1b, Fig. 2b,c and Fig. 3b
