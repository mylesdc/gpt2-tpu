The day preceding the assay, cell lines were trypsinized and total cell count and viability quantification was performed using a hemocytometer and Trypan Blue (Fisher, Suwanee, GA) dye exclusion method. For analysis of cytotoxicity utilizing the CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega, Madison, WI), H9c-2 cells were resuspended at 5 x 10 3 cells per 50 μl in corresponding complete media and all other cell lines were resuspended at 10 x 10 3 cells per 50 μl. Cells were seeded in white 96-well Nunclon™ white microtiter plates (Fisher, Suwanee, GA) in a volume of 50 μl/well. The plates were incubated at 37 o C/5% CO2 overnight to allow for cell adherence.
Plate Format: Each plate contained cell control wells (cells only) and drug treatment wells (cells plus drug) in triplicate for each drug dilution. Fifty microliters of the drug dilution at 2X final concentration was added to the appropriate cell wells. The final drug concentration was 400, 160, 64, 25.6, 10.24, 4.1, 1.64 and 0.66 μM (2.5X dilutions). Media without drug was added to the cell control wells.
For the CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay, cells were incubated with NHC at 37 o C in a 5% CO2 incubator for 3 days. Following incubation, the media and drug was discarded from the plates. The substrate was diluted 1:1 with Dulbecco's Phosphate Buffered Saline (DPBS) and 30 μl of the diluted substrate was added to each well. The plates were incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes to stabilize luminescence signal. The plates were read in a Veritas Microplate Luminometer (Turner Biosystems, Mountain View, CA). For each assay, the enzyme reactions were allowed to proceed for 30 min at 37°C followed by the transfer onto glass-fiber filters and subsequent precipitation with 10% trichloroacetic acid (TCA). The filter was then washed five times with 5% TCA followed by one wash with 95% ethanol and airdrying. Once the filter had dried, incorporation of [α-32 P] GTP was measured using a liquid scintillation counter (Microbeta). Raw data was collected from the scintillation counter and imported into a Microsoft Excel 2007 spreadsheet for analysis by linear curve fit calculations.
