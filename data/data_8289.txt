In tropical Singapore, influenza occurs all year-round. This study of influenza-confirmed hospitalized pediatric patients compared clinical characteristics and complications by age-group and differences between influenza A and B.
cases were defined as upper respiratory tract manifestations and influenza-unrelated illness, for example, urinary tract infection (UTI).
High dependency (HD) is a unit that caters for more severely ill patients requiring closer monitoring or non-invasive ventilation without needing ICU admission. Obesity was defined as BMI > 25 kg/m 2 .
Immunosuppression was defined as non-malignancy related immunosuppressive therapy, for example, steroids, biological modifying agents. Pneumonia was defined as fever and cough with chest Xray (CXR) changes of lobar/broncho-pneumonia or focal infiltrates.
Positive bacterial tests were either culture-positive from any site or positive mycoplasma PCR or serology (particle agglutination IgG antibody ≥320 single titer). C-reactive protein was the result on admission. Criteria for treating influenza with oseltamivir were as follows:
age <2 years or any high-risk factor for complicated disease within 3 days of onset, or severe disease based on clinician assessment independent of duration since onset.
Statistical analysis was performed using the spss 19.0 statistical software program. Student's t test or one-way ANOVA were used to compare continuous data; chi-square test or Fisher's exact test was used to compare categorical data, using P < .05 as statistical significance. This study was approved by the internal review board for waiver of consent.
Incidence of influenza hospitalization was derived using 56.8% market share for admissions in children and calculated as per 100 000 population based on the number of children in that agegroup (information from MOH and Singapore government statistics).
There were a total of 1272 influenza-positive patients admitted with a median age of 37 months (IQR 13-76 months); males constituted 56.5%. Majority were positive for influenza by IF (96.5%) compared to PCR (3.5%). The median length of stay (LOS) was 3 days (IQR 2-4 days). C-reactive protein and chest X-ray were performed in 28.8% and 31.1% of patients, respectively. Figure 1 shows the burden of influenza hospitalizations by year, age-groups, and subtypes/lineages (excluding unknown subtypes/lineages). Incidence of hospitalized influenza was highest for <6 months, followed by 6-month to <5-year-age-group and lowest in ≥10-year-age-group. Figure 2 shows the monthly incidence of The 6-month to <5-year-age-group (54.0%) and ≥10-year-agegroup (11.6%) constituted the largest and smallest proportion, respectively. The 5-to <10-year and ≥10-year-age-groups had the highest rates of influenza B, while <6-month-age-group had the highest rates of influenza A. The <6-month-age-group had the influenza-related complication rates but the highest bacterial infection rates and antibiotic usage. The 6-month to <5-year-age-group had the highest seizure rates, cough duration, CRP, and complication rates. The 5-to <10-year-age-group had the highest influenza B Yamagata rates and prior seizure history. The ≥10-year-age-group had the highest rates of comorbidity, other complications, ICU/HD admissions, and mean LOS.
Influenza-unrelated illnesses occurred in 33 patients (2.6%), for example, UTI (n = 12), allergic reactions (n = 8), salmonella gastroenteritis (n = 2), cellulitis (n = 2) mesenteric adenitis (n = 2), eye in- Fifty-six (4.4%) cases were admitted ICU or HD. Table 3 lists the type of complications. Neurologic complications were the most frequent (46.5%) followed by pulmonary (37.5%) and other (16.0%).
The seven complicated cases with confirmed bacterial coinfection were as follows: two pneumococcal bacteremia, two S pyogenes bacteremia, one each for P aeuginosa pneumonia, Mycoplasma pneumonia, and campylobacter gastroenteritis (admitted for febrile seizure).
Overall, oseltamivir (OSV) usage was 2.0%, especially higher in complicated cases (3.6% vs 1.3%, P = .007), ICU/HD admissions (19.6% vs 1.2%, P < .001), underlying comorbidity (4.5% vs 1.3%, P = .002), cardiac disease (10.7% vs 1.6%, P < .001), and malignancy (30% vs 1.7%, P = .001). In contrast, any antibiotic usage was 28.4%.
Comparing patients with other complications against neurologic and pulmonary complications, they had the highest ICU/HD admissions (34.6% vs 12.6%, 10.7%, respectively, P < .001), highest influenza B rates (36.5% vs 10.6%, 18.9%, respectively, P < .001) and oldest age (mean 90.3 vs 50.6, 42.1 months respectively, P < .001).
Pulmonary complications compared to neurologic and other complications had highest ILI rates (91.8% vs 68.2%, 76.9% respectively, P < .001), longest cough duration (6.5 days vs 3.2, 3.7 days, respectively, P = .010). LOS was not significantly different between the type of complications.
The mortality rate in our cohort was 0.2%. The three deaths were as follows: Acute necrotizing encephalitis, invasive pneumococcal disease, decompensated liver failure in a biliary atresia patient post-Kasai procedure. One cerebral palsy patient with no prior seizures developed sequelae of epilepsy.
The main findings from our study were that the highest burden of influenza hospitalizations was in the <6-month-age-group, followed by the 6-month to <5-year-age-group. Majority (75.2%) of pediatric inpatients had no comorbidity and 25.6% had complications: neurologic 11.9%, pulmonary 9.6%, and other 4.1%. The 6-month to <5-year-age-group suffered the highest complication rate (30.6%).
Influenza A patients were younger, had higher seizure rates and complications compared to influenza B.
In our study, the highest hospitalization rate occurred in the <6-month-age-group. This is similar to Hong Kong but different from temperate countries where the highest rates occurred in the 6-to 23-month-age-group. [10] [11] [12] Patients who were ≤6 weeks or <3 months old were likely admitted for neonatal or infantile pyrexia workup, this can explain the high UTI rates and antibiotic usage in this age-group. At the average rate of 881.68 per 10 5 population for <6 months old, it is higher than temperate countries. 3, 13 This could be due to all year-round influenza with bimodal peaks, similar to Malaysia. 14 Studies have shown that maternal influenza vaccination can prevent influenza in infants; therefore, pregnant women should receive influenza vaccination to protect their infants. 15, 16 The age-group 6 month to <5 years was the largest cohort (54%) with the second-highest hospitalization rate and the highest complication rate (30.6%) especially neurologic, similar to another study. 17 In other studies, the age-group 6-35 months or the lowest agegroups had the highest incidence of complications. 11, 18, 19 However, the ≥10-year-old-age-group had the highest other complications, ICU/high-dependency admissions, and influenza B Victoria rates. This is unlike other studies which had higher ICU admissions in the youngest age-groups <12 months. 20 Abbreviation: SD, standard deviation. especially pneumonia and asthma exacerbation. 11, 16 
Infants <6 months had the highest hospitalization rates for influenza. The 6-month to <5-year-age-group had the highest complication rate especially neurologic. Influenza A patients were younger, had higher seizure rates and complications compared to influenza B.
