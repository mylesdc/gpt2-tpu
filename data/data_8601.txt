General procedure for synthesis of Schiff base-thioguanine compounds
The synthesis of 1-3 followed the general procedure for Schiff Base reactionPannerselvam et al., 2005 1 . An amount of 6-thioguanine (0.6 mmol) was mixed with an equal mol number of the corresponding aromatic aldehyde and stirred up to 15 minutes. The liquid mixture of ethanol-NaOH 10% (1.5 mL (1:1)) was added to the first mixture and then the stirring was continued until the yellowish mixture formed. Next, the second volume of ethanol-NaOH 10% was added and the stirring was continued until the product was completely formed (monitored by TLC with CHCl 3 -Methanol (2:2) as a mobile phase). The mixture was neutralized using HCl 6 M and the solid product was filtered out using filter paper. The product was collected, washed with water, followed by washing the product using ethyl acetate and then recrystallised from a hot methanol to afford the pure product.

The synthesis of 4-6 followed the general procedure for tosylationRamezanian et al., 1993 2 .
The starting material, 6-thioguanine (0.6 mmol) was dissolved into 5 mL of NaOH 10% on an ice bath containing 3-methylbenzenesulfonyl chloride (0.7 mmol) and was carefully dropped and then the mixture was stirred at room temperature while the reaction's progress was monitored using TLC (n-hexane-ethyl acetate (2:2)). After the reaction completed, HCl 6M was added until the pH of the mixture became neutral and then filtered out. The solid product was collected, washed with water, followed by cold methanol and then dried up at 50 o C. The pure product was afforded by recrystallizing the crude product from the hot ethanol.

The synthesis of 7-14, 16-18 followed the general procedure for acylation Hu et al., 2010 3 . An amount of 6-thioguanine (0.6 mmol) was mixed with anhydride acetic acid (Ac 2 O) (1.2 mL) in 1.2 mL of glaciale acetic acid (GAA). The mixture was refluxed at 135 o C for 7.5 hours and the reaction's progress was monitored by TLC using chloroform (CHCl 3 ): acetone (2:2) as a solvent. Once the product was completely formed, the reaction mixture was diluted with 70 mL of ice water and then extracted using 3 x 70 mL of ethyl acetate. The organic phase was collected, washed with 3 x 70 mL of water and then dried with anhydrous magnesium sulfate.
This organic phase was then evaporated in vacuo to afford the product as a white off powder.
