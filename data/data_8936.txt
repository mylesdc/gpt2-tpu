A novel variant strain of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) emerged on pig farms in South Korea during late 2013. Genomic DNA isolated from a K14JB01 strain identified in a diarrheal pig showed high sequence similarity to PEDV strains prevailing in the United States in 2013. This is the first study to identify the complete genome sequence of a novel variant PEDV in South Korea.
tion in the United States, and the viral genome showed a close relationship with that of variant strains identified in China (8) . Frequent outbreaks of PED have occurred in South Korea since the early 1990s; however, piglets infected with PEDV from November 2013 suffered from several enteric diseases, resulting in a high mortality. Here, the complete sequence of a novel variant PEDV strain, K14JB01 (isolated from an infected pig in South Korea), was sequenced and analyzed.
In January 2014, fecal samples were collected from pigs with diarrhea in Gyeonggi Province, South Korea, and viral RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Minikit (cat no. 74104; Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was prepared using an OneStep reverse transcription (RT)-PCR kit (cat no. 210210; Qiagen). Twenty sets of primers were designed (based on the USA/Iowa/18984/2013 strain) to cover the full-length PEDV genome. The amplified PCR products were cloned into the pGEM-T Easy Vector (Promega, USA) and then sequenced at the Cosmogentech Institute using an ABI Prism 3730xi DNA sequencer. All fragments were then assembled and edited using Clustal X 1.83 (9) to yield the complete genome sequence.
The genome of PEDV strain K14JB01 is 28,038 nucleotides (nt) in length, excluding the 3= poly (A) tail, and is arranged as follows: In summary, PEDV strain K14JB01 identified from a diarrheal pig in South Korea shows high nucleotide sequence homology with variant strains circulating in the United States and China. The complete genome sequence data of K14JB01 will be the basis of our understanding of the genomic characterization and will contribute to the elucidation of PEDV in South Korea.
Nucleotide sequence accession number. The complete genome sequence of PEDV strain K14JB01 was deposited in Gen-Bank under accession no. KJ623926.
