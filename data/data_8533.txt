A549 cells were seeded in 6-well plate with a confluence of 10 6 cells/well. After overnight culture, increasing doses of GLDC inhibitor AOAA was supplemented in the culture medium and maintained for 48 hours. Subsequently, the cells were collected, accurately counted and washed with ice-cold PBS and lyophilized. All the extraction steps were performed on ice as described previously (Buchel, Rhyn et al., 2013) . The cells were resuspended with 2.5ml of 10:1 ethyl column (2.1×100 mm, 1.8μm). The mobile phase A contains 1.0mM ammonium acetate and 0.1% formic acid in water, while solvent B consists of 100% acetonitrile. A flow rate of 0.2ml/min at 45ºC was applied. The gradient program ran as follows: 0.5min (0.5% solvent B), 4 min (99% solvent B), 9 min (99% solvent B). The column was re-equilibrated by holding 0.5% solvent B between 9 to 10 min before the next sample injection. The ion source was operating in positive mode with a capillary voltage at 2000V and a source temperature of 120ºC. The desolvation temperature was set at 350ºC. Nitrogen gas was used for instrument operation and the desolvation gas was set at 800L/Hr. The sample cone and source offset voltage were set at 80V and 120V, respectively. Thymidine quantification was achieved by measuring the peak intensity of Q1/Q3=243.2/127.2 transition. Data were processed with Masslynx software (V4.1, Waters, USA).
The possible toxicity of AOAA was assessed in A549 cells. A549 cells were incubated with indicated concentration of AOAA at 37°C for 48 hours. The cell-free culture medium was applied to MTT assay as described elsewhere (Zhou, Chu et al., 2014) . After anesthesia via intraperitoneal injection of ketamine/xylazine cocktail containing 70~100mg/kg ketamine and 10~20mg/kg xylazine, 2 groups of 3 female Balb/c mice of 6~8 weeks old were in were intranasally administered with AOAA (10 mg/kg weight) or PBS in a volume of 20µl twice per day. Mouse body weight was daily monitored for 5 days.
