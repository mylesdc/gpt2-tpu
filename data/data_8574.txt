Supplementary Figure S3. Viruses identified by small RNA sequencing belong to diverse viral families. (A) PCLV in mosquitoes from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil clusters with other viral strains from Thailand on the phylogenetic tree with 74% bootstrap confidence at p-distance of 0.038. The dinucleotide profile reinforces the relationship between Rio and Asian strains of PCLV. (B) HTV also identified in mosquitoes
. Virus-derived small RNA can be assembled into long contig sequences 7 Supplementary Figure
