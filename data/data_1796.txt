IgA Abs against NP and M1 were detected in faecal and BALF samples obtained from the mice on day 14 after the final vaccination. Specific anti-NP and anti-M1 IgA Abs were determined by ELISA as previously described 1 . In brief, ELISA plates were coated with 2 µg of purified NP and M1 antigen per well. The appropriate dilutions of samples from each individual mouse were applied to the plates, serially diluted two-fold in PBS/Tween (PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20), and then incubated for 1 h at 37°C. Subsequently, the plates were washed and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat antibodies directed against IgA. After incubation with mouse IgA conjugates for 1 h at 37°C, the plates were washed twice with PBS/Tween and once with PBS. Antibodies were detected using substrate buffer (50 mM phosphate buffer pH 5.5 containing 0.02% OPD and 0.006% perhydrol). Plates were developed in the dark for 30 min at room temperature, after which the reaction was stopped by the addition of 50 μl 2 M H 2 SO 4 per well, and absorbances were read at 492 nm (A492) using a SPECTRA I ELISA reader. The titers were defined as end-point titers, and the absorbance of the highest dilution was two-fold greater than the background value of the faecal and BALF samples.
