Sows were puerperal Yorkshire-Landrace crossbred and then were cross-bred with Duroc To avoid the bias that may be introduced by sequencing depth for each sample, reads were 116 normalized to 15,400 reads for each sample (we chose 15,400 as the highest sequence because 117 the smallest non-chimeric reads in the subsamples is 15,400) with the single_rarefaction.py 118 script within QIIME before being used for alpha and beta diversity analyses. Alpha diversity 119 analysis was performed with QIIME scripts alpha_rarefaction.py and alpha_diversity.py. The 208 Table S1 . Background information and quantification of the MC used in this study. Each of the bacteria used was identified by chemistry test and sequenced the 16S rRNA by universal primers 8F and 1492R. a) Taxonomy of each bacteria from phylum to genus was annotated. 500 ng from each mock bacteria was pooled to create MC. b) Sequences were filtered to obtain clean reads and then were assigned to Greengenes database to generate OTUs. DNA concentration of each mock bacteria was quantified by the qPCR assay by primer 357F/519R, and then the proportion of each mock bacteria was calculated based on the results from qPCR and MiSeq sequencing, respectively. And then the ratio of qPCR/MiSeq were calculated to analyze the consistence of these two methods. a. Taxonomy
