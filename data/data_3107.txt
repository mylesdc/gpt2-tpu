. Total bacteria isolated from Holothuria leucocpilota (HL) and Stichopus vastus (SV). Table S2 . Search results of the precursor molecular ions and its exact masses. Table S3 . This table lists the samples that were analyzed by 16S amplicon sequencing, the primers were used per sample, and the accession numbers under which the amplicon datasets can be found in the ENA SRA database (project number: PRJEB31855). Table S4 . Full-length sequence of 16S rRNA from SV 155. 0  50  100  150  200  250  300  350  400  450  500  550  600  650  700  750  800  850  900  950  1000  1050  1100  1150  1200  1250  1300  1350  1400  1450  1500  1550  1600  1650  1700  1750  1800  1850  1900  1950  2000 Table S1 . Total bacteria isolated from Holothuria leucocpilota (HL) and Stichopus vastus (SV). Closest type strain based on the NCBI database, accession and strain number, % similarity to the closest type strain, sequence length of the 16S rRNA-gene sequence, sample origin and antimicrobial activity are provided. The letter in parentheses in the antimicrobial column indicates the level of activity based on the last active location in the test-well (A-H) in 1:2 serial dilutions.
