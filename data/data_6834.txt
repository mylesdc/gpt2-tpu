The authors of this revision of a previously submitted manuscript have responded adequately to most of the suggestions made by both reviewers. However, the suggestion that the authors test their chimera proteins as vaccine candidates in a permissive animal model, cotton rats, for protection from replication of metapneumovirus was not pursued.
Thank you for the submission of your manuscript "Chimeric fusion proteins set the stage for human pan-Pneumoviridae vaccines". We have been unusually busy and traveling lately, which has led to unfortunate delays. I have now had the opportunity to carefully read your paper and the related literature and I have also discussed it with my colleagues and an Editorial Advisory Board member. I am afraid that we decided that the manuscript is not well suited for publication in EMBO Molecular Medicine and have therefore decided not to proceed with peer review.
While the idea to make a vaccine that covers RSV and human metapneumovirus is interesting and novel, we are not convinced at this stage that the data would be clinically significant enough for the paper to be further considered. This opinion was shared by the Editorial Advisory Board member we consulted with, who stated "Technically the manuscript seems to be well done. The problem seems to me that the results are not [meaningful] enough to be exciting: the neutralizing titers against metapneumovirus are quite low compared to the homologous protein. " As this expert knows our journal well, I am afraid that we decided to return the manuscript to you at this stage.
I am sorry that I could not bring better news.
Thank you very much for your email and comments about our manuscript. We understand that a Journal like EMBO Molecular Medicine receives many more papers than those that could publish and that therefore relatively high quality and significance standards should be reached by accepted manuscripts. Nevertheless, we feel that in agreement with your comments our manuscript offers novel and interesting insights into the field of pneumovirus vaccines, particularly in view of the negative results reported by Wen et al. (PLoS One, doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0155917). Their results seemed to rule out the possibility of eliciting cross-neutralizing antibody responses with chimeric F proteins, something clearly revoked by our results.
We agree that at present our results are still far from a clinical application. Nevertheless, as mentioned in the Discussion of our manuscript, optimization of the chimeric approach would likely provide other vaccine candidates with improved characteristics. Still, the results obtained with the chimeric metapneumovirus F protein incorporating antigenic site II from RSV F (Fig. 4) already demonstrate the feasibility of affording protection against a RSV challenge with chimeric proteins without reaching neutralizing titers as high as with the homologous protein. The metapneumovirus neutralization titers of Fig. 6 (of concern to the Editorial Board member that you contacted) are not lower than the hRSV neutralization titres found in some mouse sera of Fig. 4 and these mice were protected against the heterologous challenge. Therefore, our results already provide evidence of inducing cross-neutralizing and protecting responses with chimeric F proteins although there is still room for improvement; e.g, by grafting more than one antigenic site to the chimeras.
We therefore would like to ask if it is still possible to request the opinion of further experts before a final decision is reached about publication of our manuscript in EMBO Molecular Medicine.
2nd Editorial Decision 14 August 2017
Thank you for your patience while we proceeded with peer-review of your article. We have now heard back from two referees whom we asked to evaluate your manuscript. I apologise for the long delay due to getting appropriate referees keeping to deadline, and the summer holidays season.
You will see from the set of comments pasted below that both referees appreciated the findings and we would like to invite a major revision of your work on the basis that 1) you can perform better appropriate in vivo analysis (and ref.1 points to using cotton rats as a better model), and 2) tune down some over-interpretation of the data and overall significance for viral infection.
I look forward to receiving your revised manuscript.
***** Reviewer's comments ***** Referee #1 (Comments on Novelty/Model System):
For a more complete assessment of the efficacy of the chimera proteins, the authors should test the induction of neutralizing antibody and protection from RSV and MPV challenges in cotton rats. Cotton rats are permissive to both viruses while mice are only semi permissive for RSV and not permissive for MPV. It is only in cotton rats that the protection from MPV challenge can be assessed after immunization with the chimera proteins.
This manuscript describes a potential method to produce a pneumovirus F protein vaccine candidate that will induce protective responses to both respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and metapneumovirus (MPV). The authors have taken advantage of the availability of the crystal structures of the pre-F and post-F forms of RSV F protein and the newly reported post-F form of the MPV F protein. The approach is to make a chimera protein with amino acids specific to an F protein epitope from one virus grafted into the backbone of the other virus F protein with the goal of generating a protein containing neutralizing antibody binding sites from both viruses. The manuscript is clearly written, and the experiments are well done with appropriate controls and statistical analyses.
The study was somewhat hampered by the lack of a structure of the MPV pre-fusion F protein. Thus the authors chose to focus on grafting site II or site IV amino acids from one virus onto the backbone of the other virus. The combinations of changes made are logical. However, a major problem is that many of the chimera proteins made were very poorly expressed. Indeed, the proteins with the most logical combination of backbones and mutational changes failed to express at levels that were workable. This finding points to a major problem that may be encountered in this approach, ability of chimera proteins to fold properly and thus be expressed. However, using the four chimera proteins that were expressed, the authors presented results that suggested the feasibility of the approach with the right combination of backbones and mutational changes. However, the authors did not clearly identify a potential vaccine candidate. Chimera F-416 is the most promising in terms of inducing potentially protective responses to the two viruses. Unfortunately this chimera is very poorly expressed (10% wild type) making its development as a vaccine problematic.
Specific points 1. The authors should discuss more fully the issue of expression levels of chimera proteins in their approach and their results.
2. The manuscript would be strengthened by a more comprehensive study of immune responses to chimera proteins, particularly F-416. For example, what was the level of protection from RSV challenge in the upper respiratory tract of mice after immunization? What levels of neutralizing antibody titers and protection from RSV or MPV challenge can be induced in cotton rats? Use of cotton rats would strengthen the study since the cotton rat is permissive to replication of both viruses in the lung and respiratory tract, in contrast to mice.

4. Line 223: Shouldn't "eight" be "five" since 3 amino acids are in common?
5. Line 225: Shouldn't "RSV-like" be "MPV-like"?
Referee #2 (Remarks):
This is a straightforward, elegantly conducted and well-presented study in which, based on recently determined crystal structures of hRSV F and hMPV F, chimeric F proteins were designed in which residues of antigenic sites were swapped between the two antigens. Epitope scaffolding was shown to result in protection simultaneously against more than one virus:
• Antigenic changes in the scaffolding chimeric F proteins were studied by ELISA with monoclonal antibodies.
• Mouse immunization with chimeric proteins induced cross-neutralizing serum antibody.
• Mouse immunization with these chimeric proteins also resulted in protection against challenge with the virus from which the heterologous antigenic site was grafted. This is a proof-of-principle study that shows that it is possible to induce family-wide cross protection with chimeric proteins in which antigenic sites have been swapped between protection inducing proteins from different viruses within the Pneumoviridae family. Although polyclonal sera after infection with one pneumovirus do not neutralize the other, it is correctly pointed out that previously cross-reactive virus neutralizing monoclonal antibodies have been identified. It is claimed that these results demonstrate the feasibility of 'universal vaccines' that could protect against infections by all human Pneumoviridae. As to date -unlike the situation for influenza viruses and HIV-no more than two (important) members of this family have been identified in humans (all be it with two subtypes each) which are antigenically rather stable over time, and 'the chimeric protein approach described here undoubtedly requires further optimization', this claim may be considered somewhat audacious at this stage. Toning down the title and changing the last paragraph of the discussion section into: 'results presented here demonstrate the feasibility of using chimeric proteins to design single immunogens that could induce cross neutralizing and cross-protecting immune responses against the important human Pneumoviridae members hRSV and hMPV', would seem more appropriate.
Major point The mechanism of protective immunity which is observed in the immunized mice, is ascribed to virus neutralizing antibodies induced by the chimeric proteins. This is however not shown formally. It could theoretically be due to another immune mechanism, like T cell mediated immunity. To formally proof that the protection induced is antibody mediated, adoptive transfer experiments with post-immunization serum antibodies (and T cells) should have been carried out. Either additional adoptive transfer experiments should be carried out, or an adequate statement should be made in the discussion section to address this point.
The lack of protection and enhanced disease after FI RSV vaccination of children can no longer (solely) be attributed to low-or non-neutralizing antibody.
1st Revision -authors' response 05 October 2017
This manuscript describes a potential method to produce a pneumovirus F protein vaccine candidate that will induce protective responses to both respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and metapneumovirus (MPV). The authors have taken advantage of the availability of the crystal structures of the pre-F and post-F forms of RSV F protein and the newly reported post-F form of the MPV F protein. The approach is to make a chimera protein with amino acids specific to an F protein epitope from one virus grafted into the backbone of the other virus F protein with the goal of generating a protein containing neutralizing antibody binding sites from both viruses. The manuscript is clearly written, and the experiments are well done with appropriate controls and statistical analyses.
The study was somewhat hampered by the lack of a structure of the MPV pre-fusion F protein. Thus the authors chose to focus on grafting site II or site IV amino acids from one virus onto the backbone of the other virus. The combinations of changes made are logical.

Unfortunately this chimera is very poorly expressed (10% wild type) making its development as a vaccine problematic. Specific points 1. The authors should discuss more fully the issue of expression levels of chimera proteins in their approach and their results.
Response: Our initial objective was to report the induction of cross-neutralizing antibody responses as a proof-of-principle for the use of single immunogens to protect against both hRSV and hMPV. We agree that our approach for the design and production of chimeric F proteins requires further improvements. An extended comment about this point has been added in the new version of the manuscript (line 281-293), suggesting several alternatives.
2. The manuscript would be strengthened by a more comprehensive study of immune responses to chimera proteins, particularly F-416. For example, what was the level of protection from RSV challenge in the upper respiratory tract of mice after immunization? What levels of neutralizing antibody titers and protection from RSV or MPV challenge can be induced in cotton rats? Use of cotton rats would strengthen the study since the cotton rat is permissive to replication of both viruses in the lung and respiratory tract, in contrast to mice.
3. Figure 6 , panel B: peptides are mislabeled. Response: Thank you for pointing out this error. It has now been corrected.
4. Line 223: Shouldn't "eight" be "five" since 3 amino acids are in common? Response: Agree. It has been changed.
5. Line 225: Shouldn't "RSV-like" be "MPV-like"? Response: Agree and corrected.

Fig. 4B could not be ascribed exclusively to antibodies (as rightly pointed out by the reviewer), the results of the new Fig. EV3 substantiate the relevance of antibodies for the protection observed with chimeric proteins.
The lack of protection and enhanced disease after FI RSV vaccination of children can no longer (solely) be attributed to low-or non-neutralizing antibody.
Response: Agree. The formalin-inactivated virus vaccine experience has been omitted from the Introduction since it was only marginally related to our study.
3rd Editorial Decision 23 October 2017
Thank you for the submission of your revised manuscript to EMBO Molecular Medicine. We have now received the enclosed report from the referee who was asked to re-assess it. As you will see the reviewer is now supportive and I am pleased to inform you that we will be able to accept your manuscript pending editorial final amendments.
1) Please address the referee 1's comments. Please provide a letter INCLUDING the reviewer's report and your detailed responses to their comments (as Word file). We would appreciate it if you could have some discussion to acknowledge the limitations of not using cotton-rats in terms of vaccine protective capacities.
***** Reviewer's comments ***** Referee #1 (Comments on Novelty/Model System for Author):
The authors of this revision of a previously submitted manuscript have responded adequately to most of the suggestions made by both reviewers. However, the suggestion that the authors test their chimera proteins as vaccine candidates in a permissive animal model, cotton rats, for protection from replication of metapneumovirus was not pursued.
The response was that cotton rats do not fully reproduce the pathology of hRSV or hMPV. Perhaps, but cotton rats are permissive enough to allow replication in lungs of hMPV as well as hRSV. They are widely used as animal models for both viruses for assays of pathology and virus replication in the lungs. As it stands, the manuscript only tests one set of chimera proteins, chimeras based on MPV F, in mice (semi-permissive only for hRSV) for effects on RSV replication in the lung. Thus the study could be viewed as incomplete as the chimera proteins based on RSV F with MPV sequences were not tested for protection from MPV replication.
Also the argument was made that the lab was not set up for cotton rat studies. Indeed, there are very few labs that can do these studies but most contract the project to companies that have the capability to do these studies or they establish collaborations with labs that can do them.
Line 277: shouldn't "hMPV" be hRSV since the protein is pre-fusion RSV?
Referee #1 (Remarks for Author):
I view the study as incomplete for reasons stated in the comments to the authors. In addition, testing for protection from RSV replication in mice is not a good test of protection since mice are only semi-permissive to RSV. However, the editors may consider the manuscript acceptable as a test of feasibility. In addition, extending the study to cotton rats may be prohibitively expensive.

For immunization protocols, five mice were included in each group since it is a standard number for this type of studies carried out in many laboratories, including ours.
Previous immunization studies carried out in our laboratory demonstrated that five mice per group were enough to discriminate between dissimilar antibody responses (see articles by Palomo et al., 2016 and Mas et al. 2016 in the reference list). In challenge experiments, the number of mice for groups immunized with chimeric proteins was increased to eight to augment the discriminatory potential. See page 19 for immunization protocols. The animals were healthy specific--pathogen free BALB/c mice that were bled before starting immunizations. The basal levels of hRSV and hMPV antibodies were negligible and thus none was excluded.
Animals were randomly distributed in experimental groups.
No randomization criteria were used since all animals were inbred and they were of the same age. See page 19
One experimenter was in charge of the inoculations and a second experimenter (blinded of the inoculations) was in charge of performing the ELISA, neutralization and virus titration tests.
