What do we know about vaccines and therapeutics of COVID-19?,"Because of their critical role in viral pathogenesis and host defense against infections, several drugs have been developed against COVID-19 With this in mind, we present evidence that drugs that inhibit pro-inflammatory responses (e.g., IL-6) have the potential to inhibit COVID-19 infection and viral replication in nonhuman primates after administration up to 12 days following infection Because of their critical role in viral pathogenesis and host defense against infections, several drugs have been developed against COVID-19",BioBERT-Large v1.1 (+ PubMed 1M) - based on BERT-large-Cased (custom 30k vocabulary) + Cosine Similarity (Scikit-learn)
