There were more males than females, and the majority of adults were younger than 50 years. Diagnose of injury/poisoning was the most frequently noted diagnostic category in emergency departments (EDs) in Taiwan. There were 13,196 (24.3%) and 2,952 (5.4%) patients with 2 and 3 concomitant diagnoses, respectively. There was a significant association between advanced age and the existence of multiple diagnoses (P < 0.001). With the exception of the ill-defined symptoms/signs/conditions, the two most frequent diagnoses were diseases of the circulatory system and diseases of the respiratory system in patients aged 65 years or older. On average, treatment-associated expenditure and drug-associated expenditure in Taiwan EDs averaged NT$1,155 ($35.0) and NT$190 ($5.8), respectively, which was equal to 64.5% and 10.6% of the total ED-associated cost. General ED medical expenditure increased with patient age; the increased cost ratio due to age was estimated at 8% per year (P < 0.001).",

In the United States, the average rate of EMS utilization by the elderly (persons aged \u226565 years) was more than 4 times that of younger patients. 7 Despite these problems in the EMS, the effort to improve the effectiveness of the EMS is justified because emergency medicine offers many tools for improving public health. 8 In 1994, the average number of daily ED visits nationwide in Taiwan was 11, 888 . This increased to 13,634 in 1996, 14,911 in 1998, 16,943 in 2000, 18,085 in 2002, and 18,823 in 2004 . However, the numbers of accredited hospitals in Taiwan decreased from 828, to 773, 719, 669, 610, and 590, respectively, in the same years. 9 ED overcrowding has been a continuing problem in Taiwan, as has the uneven distribution of ED visits. In 2003, for example, there were 24 tertiary medical centers in Taiwan, and the average number of ED visits at these centers was 187.5 cases per day-6.7 times higher than the national average. 10 It is clear, therefore, that a nationwide descriptive study of EMS utilization is needed in Taiwan. We conducted an epidemiologic survey of EMS in Taiwan in order to provide sufficient information for policymakers to make decisions regarding the redistribution of national medical resources.",

Therefore, Taiwan's NHI Plan has accumulated data on 23.75 million people and their claims, the largest set of such data in the world. In order to respond to current and emerging health issues rapidly and effectively, the National Health Research Institute (NHRI), in cooperation with the National Health Insurance Bureau (NHIB), has established an NHI research database. The NHRI safeguards the privacy and confidentiality of subjects and routinely transfers health insurance data from the NHIB to health researchers for analysis, with the aim of improving the health of Taiwan's citizens.",

Data are supplied by individual organizations and aggregated by CPS. In 2004, 676 facilities, including 239 international (non-US) facilities, were included in the aggregated, quarterly report. The hospitals located outside of the United States were in Europe (United Kingdom, Belgium, Netherlands, Germany, Austria, and Portugal) and Asia (Taiwan and Singapore). According to the acute-care indicators report for the fourth quarter of 2004, aggregated descriptive statistics showed that unscheduled returns to the ED within 24 hours and 48 hours represented 0.99% and 1.51% of ED visits in the United States, 2.71% and 4.16% of visits in Europe, and 1.33% and 2.15% of visits in Asia. Interestingly, these indicators of unscheduled revisits in ED were positively associated with the amount of ED utilization. The reported denominators (ie, ED visitors per hospital) were approximately 2,400, 5,200, and 8,900 cases per month in the United States, Asia, and Europe, respectively. 12 According to data from the 2002 US National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS), children (<19 years) and seniors (65+ years) represented 27% and 15% of all 15 In an analysis of the category of injury/poisoning, young and middle-aged adults were the majority of those treated in EDs for injuries (33.1% and 26.0% in the age groups of 18-44 and 45-64 years, respectively). In Taiwanese EDs, the number of patients diagnosed with multiple co-morbidities (>2 major diagnostic categories) markedly increased with age, and treatment of the elderly Figure 2 . The cost of treatment was significantly positively associated with age (P < 0.001, simple linear regression). The cost of medication also increased with age (P < 0.001, simple linear regression), but the difference was significant only between patients aged 18-44 years and those aged 4564 years (examined by ANOVA post-hoc test) Table 4 . Medical expenditure in emergency departments in Taiwan Taiwan 18 A survey performed at 6 community hospitals in the US state of Michigan revealed that for all emergency department visits, the average direct cost was $166.3; furthermore, the average direct costs were $46.0 for non-urgent visits, $127.2 for semi-urgent visits, and $280.5 for urgent visits. 19 As compared with the results of the above studies, the average cost of ED treatment in Taiwan was found to be much lower: NT$1792 ($54.3). Taiwan's health insurance program, which began in 1995, is a single-insurer system with a cost containment policy that mandates a fixed co-payment by the insured person for ambulatory medical services. This policy probably resulted in the increase in daily ED utilization (158% from 1994 to 2004). 9 The lower medical cost for ED treatment in Taiwan reflects the fact that a lower percentage of total medical insurance expenditure was spent on emergency medical care. Data from the National Health Insurance of Taiwan on annual total medical insurance costs and ED-associated costs indicate that the percentage of the total NHI expenditure that was spent on NHI medical emergency care was 2.9% in each of the years from 2000 to 2003 and 3.1% in 2004. 11 In another retrospective study using 2002 data from the US state of Oregon's Medicaid program, monthly ED-associated expenditures averaged $12.63 (95% confidence interval, 12.50 to 12.77) per person, representing 6.8% of total medical expenditure. 20 The average National Health Expenditure (NHE) per capita was $6120 in USA and only $939 in Taiwan. If NHE is compared to Gross Domestic Product (GDP), the NHE/GDP ratio was lower in Taiwan (6.2%) than in the United States (15.2%), Germany (10.9%), France (10.4%), Portugal (10.0%), Netherlands (9.2%), United Kingdom (7.9%), and even Japan (8.0%) in 2003. 21 Taken together, these findings show that although the number of ED visits in Taiwan is high, the cost of ED treatment is lower than in other countries.",

Implementing the widespread primary care reforms necessary to meaningfully reduce ED utilization will be complex and expansive, although they are likely to benefit both patients and the health system. 26 Complicated complaints and multiple diagnoses occurred more frequently in the elderly, and this should be considered when policymakers plan changes to Taiwan's emergency system and resource allocation. Strategies to improve continuity of care may result in lower ED use and reduced health care costs. Such strategies might prove superior to current managed care policies that attempt to control costs by denying access to emergency care. 27 Recently, a group-visit model has been studied and deemed effective in improving patient and physician satisfaction, quality of care, quality of life, and in decreasing visits to emergency departments and specialists. 28 Therefore, we believe that additional public education regarding preventive medicine and increased activities geared toward community health promotion would prove suitable and effective in decreasing ED crowding in Taiwan.",
