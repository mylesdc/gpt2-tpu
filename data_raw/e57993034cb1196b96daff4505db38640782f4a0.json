A decrease in CMV-specific CD4 + and CD8 + T-cells has been associated with progressive CMV-replication [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] . More recently, additional T-cell subsets have been recognized to have important roles [9] . For example, internal regulatory mechanisms such as regulatory T-cells (T-regs; CD4 + CD25 + FoxP3 + ) may modify CMV-specific CD4 + and CD8 + T-cell functions leading to an increased risk for progressive CMV-replication [10] . T-regs primarily function through the release of inhibitory cytokines such as IL-10 and TGF-b [10] . T-regs play an important role in maintaining self-tolerance and are being studied as a potential means to promote an immunotolerant state post-transplant [11] . Following liver transplantation, high frequencies of T-regs in peripheral blood and hepatic tissue were associated with a more aggressive recurrence of hepatitis C virus [12] .",

The kinetics of virus replication however, is only weakly associated with future outcomes such as progressive replication and the development of tissue-invasive disease. Novel immunological biomarkers, such as virus-specific T-cell responses might bridge this gap in our knowledge. The full repertoire of T-cell responses including absolute T-regs and Th-17 subsets has not been studied in transplant recipients with active CMV-replication. We hypothesized that following transplantation significant alterations occur in T-regs and Th-17 dynamics in the setting of CMVreplication. The present study aimed to prospectively assess CMVspecific CD4 + and CD8 + T-cells, total T-regs, and Th-17 frequencies in transplant recipients with concurrent CMVreplication.

The management of patients was guided by the local institutional protocol in which patients with low-level viremia (,10,000 copies/ mL) are managed by surveillance without antiviral treatment.

In this assay, DNA was extracted from 200 ml of plasma and amplified using primers targeting a conserved region of the glycoprotein B gene of CMV, and detection achieved using fluorescent probes as previously described [see ref 19 for primer and probe sequences]. The assay has a lower limit of quantification of 500 copies/mL and a dynamic range of approximately 6-log 10 copies [20] and has been validated against the commercially available COBAS Amplicor CMV Monitor assay. After initial detection, all patients had weekly viral-load testing performed. For patients who commenced antiviral treatment, individual viral kinetic calculations were performed. Viral-load was plotted against time and best-fit exponential decay curves were applied to generate appropriate mathematical descriptions of virologic outcomes [21] . The slope of the decay curve was calculated based on this best-fit line. In this context, the more negative the decay slope, the more rapid the viral clearance. Positive initial decay slopes indicate increasing viral-loads coincident with the initiation of treatment.",

In patients who did not receive anti-viral therapy, T-cell responses were only measured at the onset of viremia. We quantified CMV-specific CD4 + and CD8 + T-cells according to previously published protocols with slight modifications [4] . Briefly, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from whole blood using Ficoll-Paque (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) gradient density centrifugation and stored in liquid nitrogen until use. For determination of CMV-specific CD8 + T-cells responses, 1610 6 PBMCs were stimulated for 16 hours with peptide pool libraries covering the entire IE-1 (immediate early-1), pp72 and pp65 proteins. Each peptide is 15mer-long with an 11 amino acid overlap; final concentration 2 mg/mL in DMSO (JPT Technologies, Berlin, Germany). DMSO concentration in all experiments was maintained less than 1%. For CMV-specific CD4 + T-cell responses, 1610 6 PBMCs were stimulated for 16 hours with CMV whole virus lysate derived from fibroblast cultures (Advanced Biotechnologies Inc., Columbia, MD) at a concentration of 3 mg/ mL. Selection of type of stimulant [peptide vs. viral lysate], concentration used, and duration of stimulation was based on validation studies performed using CMV seropositive and seronegative healthy volunteers to optimize the assays. We found that that viral lysate was optimum for stimulation of CD4+ T cells whereas a peptide pool optimally stimulated CD8+ T-cells. This is also supported by the literature [4, 22] . Anti-CD3 was used as a positive control. Media alone served as a negative control. Two hours following stimulation, Brefeldin A at a final concentration of 10 mg/mL was added to block interferon-gamma (IFN-c) secretion. Next the PBMCs underwent cell surface staining. Following fixation and membrane perforation using standard buffers (eBiosciences), intracellular staining was performed. The following fluorescent monoclonal antibodies were used: phycoerythrin-Cy7 (PE-Cy7) anti-human CD4 (L3T4), allophycocyanin-eFluor TM 780 anti-human CD8 (CD8a; alpha chain), PE-anti-human interferon-gamma (IFN-c) (all eBioscience Inc., San Diego, CA).

Median T-regs at treatment discontinuation and 1 month later were 2.51% (range 0.58-6.37) and 1.95% (range 0.45-4.90), respectively. Patients with relapsing CMV had significantly higher T-regs counts one month after stopping treatment compared with patients without relapse (2.51% vs 1.70%; p = 0.04; Figure 1 and Table 2 ). No significant correlation was observed between concurrently measured CMVspecific CD4 + and CD8 + T-cell, T-regs, or Th-17 frequencies (p = n.s.; Spearman's rho).",

We found that CMV-specific CD4 + T-cells and total T-regs are significantly associated with spontaneous clearance of viremia as well as with protection from relapse; and both immune markers used in combination enabled the prediction of virologic outcomes with .80% sensitivity and specificity. In addition, Th-17 cells were stably expressed and did not correlate with virologic outcomes. ROC curve analysis has been used to determine cutoffs for prediction of disease that have optimal sensitivity and specificity. We found that the best predictor of both spontaneous clearance of viremia and relapse after treatment was the frequency ratio of CMV CD4+ T cells: T-reg. The area under the curve approached 1 and was highly significant. Future validation can be done using these cutoff values.",

CMV-specific CD8 + T-cell responses are shown to be more prominent in D + R 2 patients with primary infection [3, 4, 6] .

This can occur in acute infections, but is predominantly observed in chronic viral infections. During chronic infection, T-regs may play two potential roles: a beneficial role limiting collateral tissue damage, and a detrimental role impairing antiviral immune responses [27, 28] . Virus-specific Tregs have rarely been examined, but it is likely that the whole Treg population contains at least some virus-specific cells. These populations are probably generated in parallel with virus-specific effector T-cell responses. This concept has recently been illustrated in a coronavirus infection model [29] and may represent a mechanism that serves to protect against an excessive immune response post exposure. Other acute viral infection models provide further support to this proposed role of T-regs in limiting immunemediated pathology e.g. West Nile virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and influenza A virus replication [30, 31, 32] .",

In a mouse model of herpes simplex virus associated retinitis, T-regs were associated with progressive and more severe tissue invasive disease [35] . The role of T-regs in controlling CMV-specific immune responses was recently examined. In blood samples obtained from healthy donors and transplant recipients, depletion of T-reg cells from Figure 2D , 2E, and 2F, the outcome is relapse of CMV after completion of treatment [n = 20]. The following three tests were analyzed: CMV-specific CD4 + T-cell response [ Figure 2A and 2D], T-reg response [ Figure 2B and 2E] and the ratio of the CMV-specific CD4 + T-cells to T-reg response [ Figure 2C and 2F]. To determine the sensitivity and specificity for predicting clearance of viremia we used baseline immune measurements (2A, 2B, and 2C); for prediction of relapse we used measurements one month after completing treatment (2D, 2E, and 2F). doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0043937.g002",

            "text": "PBMCs resulted in an enhanced CMV-specific CD4 + and CD8 + T-cell response in vitro [36, 37] . The accumulation of virus-specific T-regs during virus replication could be due to the expansion of pre-existing populations of thymus-derived 'natural' T-regs that are specific for viral antigens; or it could also reflect the de novo generation of 'induced' T-regs from naive virus-specific CD4+ T cells. An important factor in the generation of 'induced' T-regs appears to be TGF-b [38, 39] . There are limited in vitro data for the role of CMV-proteins in the regulation of T-reg generation. In a co-culture model of T-cells and murine-CMV infected fibroblasts, an up-regulation of TGF-b and IL-10 expression was observed which subsequently induced T-cell differentiation to T-regs [40] . Our study is unable to answer in detail the question as to whether CMV-replication influences Treg development or function. Nevertheless, the observed correlation between T-reg frequency at baseline and viral-load quantification over the ensuing two weeks (R 2 = 0.61) would suggest that T-regs may play an important role in regulating CMV-replication. The role of Th-17 responses during viral infection are poorly characterized, but virus-specific IL-17-producing CD4+ T-cells have been detected in mice following infection with murine-CMV, herpes simplex virus, and influenza virus [15, 16, 17] . The generation of polarized Th-17 cells during viral infection has been correlated with high levels of IL-6 and may also be influenced by transforming growth factor-b (TGF-b) [41] . Th-17 cells are implicated in driving harmful inflammation during autoimmunity, and IL-17 may contribute to immunopathology during host responses against viruses. In our study, we did not find Th-17 cell frequencies correlated with CMV outcomes.",

            "text": "Our study has several limitations. First the sample size is small and includes a heterogeneous population of solid organ transplant recipients. We tried to minimize this effect by studying two very distinct groups of patients (those who required anti-viral treatment compared with those who spontaneously cleared viremia). However, until these results are confirmed in a larger subset of patients, this study should be considered preliminary, since the effect of co-factors such as transplant type, immunosuppressive regimen and D/R serostatus may only be apparent with larger sample sizes. These factors were not significant predictors of outcome in this group although the immunosuppression used was relatively homogenous. In a study of 259 patients with CMV disease, neither D/R status nor transplant type had an effect on viremia clearance [42] . The intensity of immunosuppression had a modest effect on time to viral clearance but showed no association with overall clearance rates or recurrence [43] . Secondly it would be interesting to measure CMV-specific T-regulatory and CMVspecific Th-17 cells. Unfortunately, the frequency of these cells is very low in peripheral blood and in vitro cultivation could well generate an expansion bias. Thirdly, the precise effects of T-regs on CMV-specific T-cells can be assessed in various ways. We chose to evaluate the frequencies of CMV-specific CD4 + and CD8 + T-cells by using interferon gamma as the predominant cytokine produced in response to specific stimulation. Production above background was used to identify responsive virus-specific T-cells (.0.2%). However, the functional impact of T-regs could primarily affect other markers such as interleukin 2 or T-cell proliferation.",

Tregs frequencies are elevated in patients developing CMV-disease when compared with those who spontaneously clear CMVviremia. High CMV-specific CD4 + T-cells and low T-regs counts were significantly associated with clearance of viremia and protection from relapse. Larger multicenter studies are required to further explore the predictive value of CMV-specific T-cell and T-reg monitoring after transplantation. This may help individualize patient management.
