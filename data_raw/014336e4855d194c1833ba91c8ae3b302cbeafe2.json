            "text": "Rotavirus (RV), belonging to Reoviridae family, is the leading cause of acute severe viral diarrhea in children (under 5 years old) and infant animals worldwide. Although vaccines are commonly used to prevent infection, episodes of diarrhea caused by RV frequently occur. Thus, this study was conducted to determine whether resveratrol had protective effects against RV infection in piglets. Following pretreatment with resveratrol dry suspension through adding into the basal diet for 3 weeks, the piglets were orally challenged with RV. We found that resveratrol could alleviate diarrhea induced by RV infection. Resveratroltreatment inhibited the TNF-\u03b1 production, indicating that the anti-RV activity of resveratrol may be achieved by reducing the inflammatory response. The IFN-\u03b3 level was elevated in 10mg/kg/d resveratrol-treated group and 30mg/kg/d resveratrol-treated group after RV infection. The ratios of CD4+/CD8+ in resveratrol-treated groups were the same as that in mock infected group, suggesting that resveratrol could maintain the immune function in RVinfected piglets. It was found that resveratrol could alleviate diarrhea induced by RV infection. These results revealed that resveratrol dry suspension could be a new control measure for RV infection.

Gastroenteritis induced by RV is the foremost etiological agent of acute pediatric viral diarrhea worldwide which was a leading cause of death among children less than 5 years of age [1] . A recent study indicated that, in total, 127,539 and 53,559 deaths from diarrhea and RV infection respectively, were reported among children younger than 5 years old in China [2] . RV associated with the seasons [3, 4] , the sanitary conditions of regions, the conditions people live in, and individual hygiene. RV transmission is mostly by fecal-oral spread in the case of direct and indirect contact [5, 6] . It also can infect many animals, such as calves [7] , piglets [8] , foals [9] , dogs [10] , mice, guinea-pigs, sheep, goats, antelopes, monkeys, deer, rabbits and cats [11] . Regardless of two epidemics of severe diarrhea near Lanzhou and Jinzhou in late 1982 and early 1983 [12] , RV is a hazard to human [13] and other animals all the time in China. Usually, RV-induced acute diarrhea is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in piglets [14] . Previous studies showed that RV-infected pigs have reduced feed intake and weight loss compared to non-infected piglets [15, 16] . The pathology observed in virulent RV-infected in gnotobiotic pigs occurred primarily in intestinal villous epithelial cells with villous atrophy developing as a sequela to infection pathology [17] . Virus particles also can be observed in the small intestine epithelial cells in RV-infected piglets [18] .",

In this study, an important rotavirus (OSU strain) harmful for the pig industry was selected to evaluate the anti-RV efficacy of resveratrol. We found that resveratrol dry suspension could play an important role in inhibition of diarrhea and hepatic injury induced by RV in piglets.
