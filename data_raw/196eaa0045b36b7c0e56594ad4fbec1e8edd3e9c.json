VSV\u0394G/GFP-G* and MHV-EGFPM were bound to cells on ice for 90 min 2 at MOI=1. Unbound virus was removed with ice-cold PBS, and cultures were shifted to 37\u00b0C by 3 adding warm medium. NH 4 Cl was added at the indicated time points to stop endosome 4 maturation and thus virus entry. At 8h post warming, infection was scored by FACS analysis of 5 GFP expression. Half maximum infection of VSV was obtained within 20 min, after 40 min 6 approximately 80% of the maximal number of infected cells was obtained. MHV appeared to 7 enter cells much slower and less synchronized. After about 50 min of warming only half 8 maximum infection was obtained, after 100 min approximately 60% of the maximal number of 9 infected cells was observed. Error bars in a & b represent 1SEM, n=3. Fluorescein signal dependence on the incubation on ice. LR7\u0394M15 cells were 1 inoculated at an MOI of 10 with MHV-\u03b1N by binding the virus to the cells for 90 min on ice, 2 removal of unbound virus, and shifting of the cultures to 37\u00b0C for 100min. FDG was 3 administered by hypotonic shock and subsequently the samples were incubated on ice for the 4 indicated amount of time. \u03b2-galactosidase activity was measured by determining fluorescein 5 production using FACS. Intracellular \u03b1-tagged protein level in relation to \u03b2-galactosidase activity. 1 VSV\u0394G/Luc-G\u03b1* (MOI=100) was bound to cells on ice. Unbound virus was washed off, and 2 culture temperature shifted to 37\u00b0C in the presence of CHX. At the indicated time points cells 3 were washed and trypsinized on ice. Fusion was assessed by \u03b2-galactosidase activity-driven 4 fluorescein production using FACS. In parallel samples cells were lysed and G-protein content 5 was measured by western blot analysis. Fluorescence microscopy of \u03b2-galactosidase activity in \u03b1-virus infected cells. 1 VSV\u0394G/Luc-G\u03b1* virus was bound to \u0394M15 transfected HEK293T cells on ice. Unbound virus 2 was washed off and culture temperature shifted to 37\u00b0C for the indicated time periods. Fusion-3 dependent \u03b2-galactosidase activity-driven fluorescein production in cells was visualized by wide-4 field fluorescence microscopy. Size bar corresponds to 250\u00b5m. Calculating virus binding and internalization using a standard curve. (a) Correlation 1 between \u03b2-galactosidase activity and amount of \u03b2-galactosidase protein with indicated linear 2 range. Increasing amounts of purified wild-type E. coli \u03b2-galactosidase were added to cell lysates 3 of LR7\u0394M15 cells. Samples were probed with Beta-Glo\u00ae substrate and incubated for 40 min at 4 RT in the dark before measuring the \u03b2-galactosidase activity using a luminescence read-out. (b) 5 Linear range of the \u03b2-galactosidase activity of the standard curve. (c) Calculation of number of 6 active enzymes per well from the standard curve and correlation thereof with the estimated 7 number of N proteins present in the binding assay based on literature.[1-3] (d) Calculation of the 8 number of active enzymes per well from the standard curve and correlation thereof with the 9 estimated number N proteins per well in the internalization assay. 10",
