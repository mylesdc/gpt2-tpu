The proteins included the known antigens ApxIIA, protective surface antigen D15, outer membrane proteins P5, subunit NqrA. The remaining antigens are being reported as immunoreactive proteins in APP for the first time, to our knowledge. Conclusions: We identified a total of 42 immunoreactive proteins of the APP serotype 1 virulent strain S259 which represented 32 different proteins, including some novel immunoreactive factors which could be researched as vaccine candidates.",

Further development of cross-serovar vaccines would benefit from a molecular understanding of APP pathogenesis, which is a complex process involving a number of different potential virulence factors. The most commonly associated virulence factors [8] i.e., ApxI, ApxII, ApxIII, and ApxIV, have been tested as subunit vaccine candidates offering potential cross-serovar protection [9, 10] . DNA vaccines encoding multiple Apx toxins offer a novel strategy for protecting against APP infection [11] . In addition to Apx toxins, several other APP proteins have been researched as vaccine candidates, such as the 48 kDa outer membrane protein [12] and the 30 kDa membrane protein of the ABC transporter family [13] . Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-based vaccines are alternative to protein antigens [14] .",

The same membranes used for western blots were also stained with Ponceau S to visualize all proteins. Digital images of the western blots and Ponceau Sstained membranes were compared with the 2DE gels by aligning the images with the layer function of Photoshop CS (Additional file 1, Figure S1 , Additional file 2, Figure S2 , Additional file 3, Figure S3 , Additional file 4, Figure S4 ).

Four of those proteins, ApxIIA (spot APs25,26), D15 (spot APs21,22), subunit NqrA (spot APr12), outer membrane protein P5 (spot APBs1,2,3,4,5,6,8; APBr1,2 ), have been demonstrated recently as immunogenic proteins in APP JL03 [20] . ApxIIA, which belongs to the RTX family [21] , has been reported to be moderately cytotoxic and weakly hemolytic [22] . Chiang et al. designed DNA vaccines that encode ApxIA or ApxIIA. The vaccines elicited humoral immune responses and protective efficacy in mice [11] . D15 (or its precursor) is an essential component of outer membrane biogenesis and outer membrane protein assembly [23, 24] . The immunogenicity of D15 has been demonstrated in both Haemophilus ducreyi [25] and Pasteurella multocida [26] . Thus, D15 is a highly conserved antigen and may be a useful component of a universal subunit vaccine against Haemophilus infection [27] . Subunit NqrA was identified as a 48-kDa outer membrane protein with immunogenic in serotype 1 or 5A and is common to 12 APP serotypes, but is not present in related Gram-negative swine pathogen species [12] . Outer membrane protein P5 (or its precursor), which is a homolog of OmpA in Pasteurella trehalosi and Escherichia coli, may be involved in the adherence of bacteria to nasopharyngeal mucin [28] . The ribosomal subunit proteins L7/L12 (spot APr4) and pyruvate dehydrogenase subunit E1 (Spots APr10, 11) [29] were identified as immunogenic proteins in members of the Bacillus cereus group [30] , but have not previously been identified as such in APP before.",

The ApxIV-ELISA has the advantage over other serological tests that it does not show cross-reactions with other bacterial species and that it is highly sensitive and allows also the serological detection of pigs infected by the different serotypes of APP or carrying the agent without apparent clinical signs or symptoms of infection. Furthermore the test allows clear differentiation between pigs infected with APP and healthy pigs that were vaccinated against APP. In addition, we have traced the background of corresponding swine. These swine were never immunized any vaccines against APP infection and were apparently healthy.

Each IPG strip plus an SDS-PAGE molecular weight standard (Invitrogen, Shanghai, China) was loaded on a 12% polyacrylamide gel and sealed with 1% agarose. Electrophoresis was performed at 15\u00b0C at an initial voltage of 110 V for 30 min, followed by 220 V until the tracking dye reached the gel bottom. Pairs of gels were run simultaneously, one for Coomassie G-250 stain and the other for western blot analysis. Each IEF/SDS-PAGE experiment was repeated three times.",

Membrane-bound proteins were detected by staining with Ponceau S. Briefly, the PVDF membranes were submerged in Ponceau S stain solution (0.1% w/v Ponceau S, 5% v/v acetic acid) with gentle agitation for 5 min. The membranes were washed several times with distilled water (dH 2 O) until the protein spots were visible; the Ponceau S-stained membranes were digitally scanned with a Umax scanner (TE77, GE Healthcare, Shanghai, China). Ponceau S stain was removed by rinsing the membranes in dH 2 O with gentle agitation. After removing Ponceau S, the membranes were blocked with 5% w/ v skim milk in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST) for 2 h at room temperature. The blocked-membrane was then incubated with convalescent sera from swine or hyperimmune sera from rabbit at room temperature for 2 h (1:1000 dilution with blocking buffer) and then washed three times with TBST for 15 min per wash. The membranes were incubated with Staphylococcal protein A labeled with horseradish peroxidase (Boster, Wuhan, China) which has been widespread applied as one kind of broad-spectrum secondary antibodies of most mammalian species [35] [36] [37] [38] at room temperature for 1 h (1:10000 dilution with blocking buffer), washed three times with TBST, and developed by adding 3,3'-Diaminobenzidine (Tiangen, Beijing, China) until the optimum color was obtained. For each sample, the western blot was repeated three times.",

All identified protein spots were analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS. B. Western blot analysis of proteins on 2DE gel as transferred to a PVDF membrane. The primary antibodies were convalescent sera from swine naturally infected with APP serotype 1.(PMF). For conclusive identification of the protein corresponding with each spot, the probability score of the match (Protein scores > 83 were significant), the weightaverage molecular weight (MW), pI, number of peptide matches, and percentage of the total translated open reading frame (ORF) sequence covered by the peptides were analyzed. Descriptive data for the identified spots are listed inTables 1 and 2. Only the proteins ranking first in each matching search are shown. Western blot analysis with convalescent sera from swine naturally infected APP serotype 1, led us to identify 32 immunoreactive spots, representing 25 proteins, including 21 that separated in the pH 4-7 range (Figure 1) and 4 that separated in the pH 7-11 range(Figure 3).
