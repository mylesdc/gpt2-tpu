The taxonomy of viruses is based upon morphological features, including capsid and tail structures, specific type of genetic material, and mechanism of replication and assembly [1, 2] . Genetic comparison across virus species has been complicated by generally different rates of gene evolution, thus, their overall classification rests on phenotypic and morphologic characteristics [3] . Horizontal gene transfer has been substantial in virus evolution [4] [5] [6] [7] , complicating reproduction of ontogeny based on the cur-rent presence of particular loci. Analysis of phylogenies based on phenotypic systems is limited by convergent evolution, in which like characteristics are evolved by unrelated organisms to suit particular niches or evolutionary requirements [8] . Taxonomy of bacteriophages also has been based on morphologic characteristics [9, 10] . Tail morphology forms the basis for bacteriophage classification into 3 separate families: Myoviridae (contractile tails), Podoviridae (short tail stubs), and Siphoviridae (long tails) [1] . Studies examining phage tail assemblies [11] have not ascertained whether the source of tail characteristics has phylogenetic significance, indicating the likely existence of polyphylogeny within these phage groups [12] .",

Alternatively, there has been analysis of phylogenetic signal in whole-genome nucleotide usage patterns and is consistent with the predicted phylogenetic structure of prokaryotes based on 16S rRNA [19] . Whole-genome approaches are less biased by any single locus [20] , with horizontal transfer being an intrinsic part of the signal, reflecting the current. Using Zero-Order Markov algorithms, we have previously demonstrated that patterns of tetranucleotide usage patterns retain phylogenetic signal among many related prokaryotes [19] . Differences between tetranucleotide usage and 16S rRNA in ancestral reconstruction likely are due to horizontal influences, such as extensive recombination, and/or presence of restriction/modification systems.",

Bovine viruses (e.g. bovine RSV, papillomavirus, coronavirus, parvovirus, and polyomavirus) cluster independent of host, indicating that factors other than host influences determine their phylogenetic position ( Figure 7 ). That coronaviruses do not belong to the major RNA virus cluster (Figures 7 and 8) , contrary to previous studies [32] , suggests that TUD may not be robust for certain RNA viruses. Most of the negative-sense RNA viruses cluster with the exception of RSV and the segmented RNA viruses. The clustering of RSV with rhinoviruses may represent convergent evolution or allelic exchange, as they occupy a similar ecological niche. The phylogenetic position of the segmented RNA viruses including orthomyxoviruses, arenaviruses, and reoviruses supports the concept of a common progenitor (Figure 7 ). The TUD analysis shows separate grouping of the large and small double stranded DNA viruses, which may be a limitation of the technique or reflect the occurrence of double stranded DNA more than once in the ancestral history of viruses. Bacteriophages cluster with the eukaryotic double stranded DNA viruses, further suggesting a single progenitor for the large double stranded DNA viruses. Whether the polyphylogeny observed among the large and small DNA viruses, the positive-sense RNA viruses, and the single stranded DNA viruses reflect methodologic limitations or evolutionarily significant phenomena remains to be determined. Phylogeny based on gene content, in which polyphylogeny among each group of viruses is diminished, supports the former hypothesis ( Figure 8 ).",
