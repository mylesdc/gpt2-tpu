The statistical significant difference of the individual outcome measures was especially underlined by the frequency of cough fits by p = 0.0001 after 4 days.",

The main constituent of eucalyptus oil is Cineole, which has been proven as being effective in the treatment of respiratory diseases, such as rhinosinusitis, asthma and COPD [8] [9] [10] . This is essentially due to its mucolytic and primary anti-inflammatory effects. Therefore, the clinical effectiveness of Cineole has been repeatedly proven and established in the context of controlled clinical studies. As Cineole accelerates the beat frequency of the cilias in the mucous membrane, as well as acting both as a bronchodilating and an anti-inflammatory agent, it has to be postulated that it will be effective in treating symptoms of acute bronchitis. Therefore, in order to investigate the therapeutic effects of Cineole in the treatment of acute bronchitis, we conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled, multi-center study.",

The results have shown, that antibiotics should be prescribed with care when other medications fail. Mucolytic remedies are traditionally used in Europe. A controlled clinical trial, based on Cineole as the main constituent of eucalyptus oil, had not yet been carried out on patients with acute bronchitis. In this trial, for the clinically relevant parameter of the reduction of cough frequency a statistically significant effect in favour of Cineole could be proven, due to the proven anti-inflammatory and mucolytic effects of this active ingredient. Acute bronchitis is characterized by coughing that persists more than 5 days, while about 50% of patients produce purulent sputum that represents sloughed tracheobronchial epithelium and inflammatory cells. A rapid diagnostic test identifying a specific pathogen is normally not recommended. Most cases of acute bronchitis are caused by viral infections, where the major pathogens are influenza A and B viruses, parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, corona virus, adenovirus, and rhinovirus. Knowing the pathophysiology it seems to be evident that antibiotics should not be the first choice of treatment. Therefore, treatment should focus on treatment options, which are known to have both favourable influence on the pathophysiology, and that are able to reduce the symptoms of acute bronchitis, without being limited by a relatively high incidence of side effects.",

This has to be viewed in the context of the duration of the existing diagnosis of acute bronchitis.

Therefore, we recruited the patients on the basis that their symptoms did not last longer than 7 days. The mean duration since occurrence of acute bronchitis symptoms was about four days. Thus, it is not surprising that the difference between the two groups, following 10 days of treatment with the study medication, no longer showed to be statistically significant. During the treatment period of 4 days the efficacy of Cineole compared with a placebo could be proven. The difference between both groups, based upon the symptom-sum-score and the frequency of coughing fits, decreased after 10 days, due to the normal course of symptoms without treatment of the disease. Considering the mean duration before beginning the treatment of the symptoms of acute bronchitis will also subside without treatment with an effective medication. Therefore, showing a statistically significant difference after 4 days of treatment has to be seen as a further contribution to the rapid onset of the efficacy of Cineole in treating acute bronchitis.",

In our study, as in other investigations, we could clearly show that the number of coughing fits is the most relevant parameter to be chosen as demonstrating the progress of disease. The other parameters, in the acute bronchitis Sum-Score, were based on relevant symptoms of acute bronchitis, without showing equivalent improvement in comparison to the frequency of the coughing fits. The explanation for these finding, is that the baseline for these parameters requires a clear definition of the in-and exclusion criteria, when planning a study demonstrating the efficacy by these parameters. But as coughing is the main and predominant criterion for the definition of acute bronchitis, other parameters have only minor influence on the results. Definition of cough documentation is specified by scores: 0 = no cough, 1 = in the morning without complaints, 2 = in the morning with complaints, 3 = in the morning and over the day (moderate), 3 = in the morning and over the day (severe), 5 = continuously during whole day (moderate complaints) and 6 = continuously during whole day (relevant complaints) in the paragraph with the outcome measures.",
