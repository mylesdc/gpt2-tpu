            "text": "Drug repurposing offers an expedited and economical route to develop new clinical therapeutics in comparison to traditional drug development. Growthbased high-throughput screening is concomitant with drug repurposing and enables rapid identification of new therapeutic uses for investigated drugs; however, this traditional method is not compatible with microorganisms with abnormal growth patterns such as Staphylococcus aureus small-colony variants (SCV). SCV subpopulations are auxotrophic for key compounds in biosynthetic pathways, which result in low growth rate. SCV formation is also associated with reduced antibiotic susceptibility, and the SCV's ability to revert to the normal cell growth state is thought to contribute to recurrence of S. aureus infections. Thus, there is a critical need to identify antimicrobial agents that are potent against SCV in order to effectively treat chronic infections. Accordingly, here we describe adapting an adenylate kinase (AK)-based cell death reporter assay to identify members of a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)approved drug library that display bactericidal activity against S. aureus SCV. Four library members, daunorubicin, ketoconazole, rifapentine, and sitafloxacin, exhibited potent SCV bactericidal activity against a stable S. aureus SCV. Further investigation showed that sitafloxacin was potent against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant S. aureus, as well as S. aureus within an established biofilm. Taken together, these results demonstrate the ability to use the AK assay to screen small-molecule libraries for SCV bactericidal agents and highlight the therapeutic potential of sitafloxacin to be repurposed to treat chronic S. aureus infections associated with SCV and/or biofilm growth states. IMPORTANCE Conventional antibiotics fail to successfully treat chronic osteomyelitis, endocarditis, and device-related and airway infections. These recurring infections are associated with the emergence of SCV, which are recalcitrant to conventional antibiotics. Studies have investigated antibiotic therapies to treat SCV-related infections but have had little success, emphasizing the need to identify novel antimicrobial drugs. However, drug discovery is a costly and time-consuming process. An alternative strategy is drug repurposing, which could identify FDA-approved and wellcharacterized drugs that could have off-label utility in treating SCV. In this study, we adapted a high-throughput AK-based assay to identify 4 FDA-approved drugs, daunorubicin, ketoconazole, rifapentine, and sitafloxacin, which display antimicrobial activity against S. aureus SCV, suggesting an avenue for drug repurposing in order to effectively treat SCV-related infections. Additionally, this screening paradigm can Citation Trombetta RP, Dunman PM, Schwarz EM, Kates SL, Awad HA. 2018.

KEYWORDS Staphylococcus aureus, small-colony variants, high-throughput screen, drug repurposing, chronic infection D rug discovery is a crucial process to identify candidate compounds, molecules, and biologics that can potentially be developed into clinically effective therapeutics. However, this discovery process is costly and fraught with risk of frustrating failures. The associated costs of a successful drug launch can reach $800 million in research and development expenses, and the drug can take up to 15 years to develop (1, 2) . Despite these huge expenditures, nearly 86.2% of drug candidates that make it to phase 1 trials fail to achieve drug approval (3) . The time, costs, and high failure rate of drug development have prompted pharmaceutical companies to pursue alternative avenues for effective therapeutics. One promising avenue is drug repositioning or repurposing, which is the process of discovering new uses for existing drugs. Drugs that are Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved and repurposed have the ability to go directly to preclinical and clinical trials, reducing the lengthy amount of time for preclinical drug development and, thus, reducing costly risks of failure (4) . There are numerous examples of success using this repurposing approach, including screens that have identified candidate therapies for the ZIKV infection, Ebola virus disease, Alzheimer's disease, and hepatitis C virus (5) (6) (7) (8) .",

This methodology is especially critical in the context of chronic bacterial infections due to the rising bacterial resistance to antibiotics (14) . Drug-resistant bacterial strains can be easily screened using whole-cell, bacterial growth assays against drug and compound libraries. However, in addition to drug resistance, chronic infections are often attributed to alternative bacterial phenotypes such as small-colony variants (SCV). SCV are subpopulations of bacteria with slower metabolism and are thought to be a key contributor to chronic Staphylococcus aureus infections. The altered growth state of SCV is characterized by a low growth rate, reduced coagulase and hemolytic activity, small colony size on agar plates, absence of pigmentation, antibiotic recalcitrance, and varied auxotrophy for hemin, menadione, and/or thymidine, which is required for normal growth (15) (16) (17) . Because of their abnormal and low growth rate, conventional whole-cell, growth-based assays used for HTS are not practical with SCV, urging the need for other HTS methodologies.",

With this objective in mind, we set out to adapt a recently developed and validated adenylate kinase (AK) release reporter assay as an HTS platform to identify agents that display bactericidal activity toward slowly and/or nongrowing bacterial populations, including SCV (35) . This HTS has recently been used to screen an FDA-approved drug library for agents that displayed bactericidal activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms, identifying 34 compounds that displayed antibiofilm activity (36) . The basis for the assay is that AK is a ubiquitous intracellular enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of two ADP molecules into ATP and AMP, which is released extracellularly after cell death. Extracellular AK release from lysed cells can subsequently be measured using commercial ToxiLight reporter cocktail based on the ATP-dependent bioluminescent measurement of AK (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland). In this study, we demonstrate that this AK release assay can be scaled for HTS of a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug library containing 853 drug candidates and that it can identify candidates that are bactericidal against UAMS-1112 (\u0394hemB). Assay hits were then further validated and characterized for their antimicrobial efficacy against wild-type S. aureus strains, antibiofilm activity, resistance frequency, and human cell cytotoxicity.",

MIC results were compared to that of a conventional aminoglycoside, gentamicin (Table 2) , which is commonly used in local delivery for orthopedic infections via poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) bone cement spacers (37, 38) . The observed 8-fold increase in MIC of gentamicin against SCV in comparison to the NCP UAMS-1 was consistent with previously reported values and reaffirmed that SCV are refractory to the antibiotic (39, 40) . Rifapentine and sitafloxacin had MICs against SCV and the other strains tested that were lower than gentamicin, daunorubicin, and ketoconazole ( Table 2 ), suggesting they may represent potent options for treating S. aureus SCVassociated infections. Antimicrobial efficacy of validated screening hits against established S. aureus biofilm. S. aureus chronic infections are also associated with biofilm formation, which is comprised of a heterogenous population of cells, both NCP and SCV (41, 42) . To further assess the antimicrobial efficacy of the identified candidates, S. aureus biofilms were grown for 24 h and then challenged with daunorubicin, ketoconazole, sitafloxacin, rifapentine, and gentamicin to assess biofilm vulnerability to these compounds. Briefly, UAMS-1 biofilms were grown on polystyrene pegs using the minimum biofilm eradication concentration (MBEC) assay (Innovotech, Edmonton, Canada). Growth medium was supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) human plasma (43) , which enabled robust biofilm to be formed after 24 h ( Fig. 2A to C). Established biofilms were then challenged with daunorubicin, ketoconazole, sitafloxacin, rifapentine, or gentamicin for 24 h at concentrations ranging from 1 to 128 g/ml. Pegs were then sonicated in recovery plates, serially diluted, and then plated, and resulting CFU were enumerated.

To assess the detrimental effects of the drug candidates on mammalian cells and to establish a therapeutic window by comparing toxic concentrations with identified MICs, the cytotoxicity of daunorubicin, ketoconazole, rifapentine, sitafloxacin, and gentamicin was measured using an XTT proliferation assay, which involved treating human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells with the candidate drugs at concentrations ranging from 0 to 128 g/ml for 24 h. Results showed that gentamicin did not induce significant cytotoxic effects over the range of concentrations tested, with \u03fe85% cell viability (Fig. 3A ). Sitafloxacin and rifapentine displayed the least cytotoxic effects of the candidates tested, with no significant dose-dependent cytotoxicity effects observed at concentrations ranging from 1 to 64 g/ml and 1 to 16 g/ml, respectively ( Fig. 3D and E) , whereas daunorubicin and ketoconazole demonstrated significant cytotoxic effects in comparison to mock-treated cells at all concentrations ranging from 1 to 128 g/ml and 16 to 128 g/ml, respectively ( Fig. 3B and C) .",

Rifampin was used as a control because it is a known antibiotic that readily induces S. aureus resistant mutants (44) . Ketoconazole had the highest frequency of resistance on the order of 10 \u03ea5 at either 2\u03eb or 4\u03eb MIC (Table 4 ). Rifapentine and rifampin all had similar spontaneous resistance frequencies on the order of 10 \u03ea7 at 2\u03eb or 4\u03eb MIC. However, while sitafloxacin had similar equivalent resistance frequencies to rifapentine and rifampin at 4\u03eb MIC, it demonstrated an order of magnitude higher resistance frequency at 2\u03eb MIC. Daunorubicin yielded no detectable levels of resistant mutants at 2\u03eb or 4\u03eb MIC. These data suggest that rifapentine and sitafloxacin are equivalent to rifampin in their induction of resistant mutants, while ketoconazole was the most likely to produce resistant mutants.

Due to their reduced susceptibility to conventional antibiotics, novel drug discovery and development are essential for efficacious treatments against SCV-related chronic infections. However, drug discovery is a notoriously slow, expensive, and high-risk process. Poor profitability and uncertain regulatory requirements for market approval have slowed discovery initiatives from large pharmaceutical companies, which led to a critical need to find new approaches for new antimicrobial drug development (45) (46) (47) . One such approach is drug repurposing, which enables an expedited and efficient strategy for identifying new applications for approved drugs to treat disease (48) . Incidentally, 30% of newly FDA-approved drugs are repurposed agents (49) . Conventional high-throughput screens typically use whole-cell, bacterial growth assays, which makes screening very challenging due to the slow and abnormal growth characteristics of SCV. Hence, this study uses an AK release-based cell death reporter assay (35) for an HTS of an FDA-approved Selleck drug library for bactericidal activity against S. aureus SCV. We demonstrate the ability of this screening approach to identify 4 FDA-approved drugs, daunorubicin, ketoconazole, rifapentine, and sitafloxacin, as bactericidal drugs against S. aureus SCV.",

            "text": "Current efforts aim to identify antibiotics effective against SCV by investigating the susceptibility of stable clinical isolates or site-directed SCV mutants in vitro using conventional MIC testing or using animal models of infection (40) . In general, these studies have consistently shown that antibiotics, including aminoglycosides, cationic compounds, and antifolates, have less activity against SCV due to their lower membrane potential relative to NCP (15, 50, 51) . Additionally, cell-wall-active antibiotics and antibiotics that inhibit protein biosynthesis have been shown to have reduced bactericidal activity against the slow-growing SCV (52) . Yet, some antibiotics belonging to the families of rifamycins and fluoroquinolones have shown effectiveness against SCV in vitro, demonstrating a low MIC ranging from 0.0005 to 0.06 g/ml and 0.06 to 0.5 g/ml, respectively (25, 40, 53) . Furthermore, rifamycins have shown efficacy in clearing intracellular SCV, as well as reducing the bacterial burden during the acute phase in a long-term osteomyelitis murine mode (25) . The potency of rifamycins and fluoroquinolones is consistent with the results of our HTS, which identified rifapentine, a rifamycin, and sitafloxacin, a fluoroquinolone, as bactericidal against a stable SCV hemB mutant. Although rifapentine and sitafloxacin belong to two classes of antibiotics that have generally shown some promise against SCV, this is the first time these two specific drugs have been identified to directly kill SCV. Additionally, screening the Selleck library investigated not only FDA-approved antibiotics, but a broad spectrum of FDA-approved drugs developed for other therapeutic applications. This enabled us to identify two nonantibiotic drugs that were bactericidal against S. aureus SCV, dauno- rubicin and ketoconazole. Incidentally, daunorubicin, an anthracycline chemotherapy agent, and ketoconazole, an imidazole antifungal, have previously been shown to have a bactericidal mode of action against S. aureus (54, 55) . However, this is the first study to confirm their bactericidal effectiveness against S. aureus SCV. Daunorubicin, ketoconazole, rifapentine, and sitafloxacin had varied MICs against S. aureus SCV and NCP regardless of drug mode of action. Both sitafloxacin and daunorubicin inhibit DNA synthesis by acting upon type II DNA topoisomerases (56, 57) ; however, the MIC of sitafloxacin was found to be nearly two orders of magnitude lower than daunorubicin. These differences may be attributed to the uptake of drug by the SCV phenotype, as well as sitafloxacin's additional mode of action against DNA gyrase, warranting further investigation of sitafloxacin's efficacy against SCV (57) . Rifapentine had a similar SCV MIC of 0.032 g/ml in regard to sitafloxacin even though its mode of action inhibits the \u2424-subunit of the bacterial RNA polymerase (58) . Ketoconazole had the highest MIC, which is consistent with its inhibition of sterol synthesis, and is most effective in antifungal therapies. However, in regard to S. aureus, imidazole antifungals induce intracellular reactive oxygen species production (54) . Yet, despite the different modes of action, no synergy between any of the 4 identified drugs was observed by fractional inhibitory concentration (data not shown).",

            "text": "Further drug characterization was performed to assess the efficacy of each of these four drugs against various S. aureus strains and biofilm and cytotoxicity. The results of this characterization demonstrated sitafloxacin was the best-performing drug due to its low MIC against SCV and various S. aureus strains, its potency against established biofilm, and its low cytotoxicity. However, the antibiotic had a comparable spontaneous resistance frequency to that of rifampin, which is known to produce resistant mutants in clinic when treated as a monotherapy, suggesting the need to be used in combination therapy to mitigate this issue (61, 62) . Sitafloxacin was developed in Japan and approved in 2008 for treating respiratory and urinary tract infections (63) . Here, we showed sitafloxacin's efficacy against SCV and biofilm, which has not been reported (59) . This is significant since implant-associated osteomyelitis is a chronic infection associated with both SCV and biofilm. Thus, we propose that a repurposing approach using the AK release assay as the basis of HTS can be an effective approach to identify new uses of approved drugs for the treatment of infections, including SCV. For example, the repurposing of sitafloxacin for this orthopedic infection could prove valuable for its potential efficacy in the treatment of implant-associated osteomyelitis. This approach has decided advantages in saving money and time as opposed to novel drug development (60) . The full potential of this assay as an HTS tool is that it can be scalable to large drug or novel chemical libraries, which should be screened not only against lab strains but also against various clinical isolates of SCV strains associated with many chronic infections.",

The high therapeutic ratios of sitafloxacin and rifapentine could serve as the basis for refining the pharmacophore structure of these drugs to increase their bactericidal potency and to further extend the screening paradigm to interrogate novel small-molecule drug candidates to develop new classes of antimicrobials to effectively combat SCV in recurrent infections. However, this study has limitations. One caveat of using the AK assay to screen against SCV is that we found that 18 of the 22 identified hits had a \u05451-log reduction against SCV, resulting in an 82% false-positive hit rate. This rate could be decreased by refining the selection criteria for positive hits; however, this would come at the risk of missing positive hit identification. Additionally, identified hits were those associated with lytic cell death, while compounds associated with nonlytic cell death would have been missed. A further limitation to this study is that only one stable SCV mutant (\u0394hemB) was used for screening purposes. Clinically recovered SCV are a heterogenous population varying in characteristics and antibiotic susceptibility based on their auxotrophism for distinct growth factors (51, 64) . The resulting metabolic pathway deficiencies affect antibiotic susceptibility of recovered SCV. Therefore, future work will investigate the potency of each of the identified hits against other stable SCV mutants (i.e., \u0394menD) as well as clinical isolates.",

Identification of these drugs demonstrates the usefulness of this approach in identifying bactericidal agents against SCV and provides a strategy for drug repurposing to treat chronic infections associated with S. aureus SCV. Among these drugs, sitafloxacin displayed the highest potential in treating such infections due to its high therapeutic ratio and its significant effectiveness against S. aureus biofilm in comparison to gentamicin, which is the clinical standard for treating osteomyelitis. Future studies will continue to screen drug and chemical libraries using the AK screen against SCV but also investigate the efficacy and safety of sitafloxacin in combination with clinically used antibiotics in the treatment of established, implant-associated osteomyelitis in a preclinical rodent model (65) .

Briefly, 36-h cultures of the stable S. aureus SCV strain, UAMS-1112 (\u0394hemB), were grown in MH medium at 37\u00b0C at 225 rpm, used to inoculate (1:100 dilution) 500 ml of MH medium, and grown to an optical density (OD 600 ) of 0.2 corresponding to \u03f31 \u03eb 10 6 CFU/ml. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation (8,000 rpm; 10 min) and resuspended in 10 ml of MH medium (\u03f31 \u03eb 10 9 CFU/ml). Fifty microliters of this cell solution was added to 48 l of MH medium, and 2 l of each drug from the drug library was added to wells of a white-walled 96-well microtiter plate (Corning Life Sciences, Durham, NC), achieving a concentration of 100 M. A higher screening concentration was used in comparison to previous studies to ensure hit identification against the resilient nature of SCV (35, 36) . Plates were incubated for 24 h at 37\u00b0C. Afterward 100 l of ToxiLight AK reagent (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) was added to each well and incubated for 30 min. Luminescence was measured using a SpectraMax M5 plate reader. The assay was performed in duplicate. Hits were identified by thresholding luminescent values normalized to the mock-treated growth control with values greater than or equal to the overall mean plus two times the standard deviation. To compensate for increased noise on certain plates, thresholding was applied independently to select plates. Additional hits were selected by removing select plates that had increased noise relative to the overall data. Secondary cell viability assays, in which \u03f31 \u03eb 10 5 CFU/ml UAMS-1112 cells were treated with each of the identified hits at 100 M for 48 h and enumerated by plating, distinguished primary assay screening artifacts from validated hits.",
