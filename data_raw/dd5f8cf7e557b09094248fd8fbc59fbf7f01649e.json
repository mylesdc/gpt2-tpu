The evaluated parameters included ANC, % neutrophils, % lymphocytes, WBC, and maximal temperature. In accordance with the well-established clinical role of these parameters, we observed a statistically significant difference in their levels between bacterial and viral patients (Fig.  S11) . For example, bacterial patients had increased levels of ANC (t-test P <10 -24 ), and WBC (t-test P <10 -10 ), whereas viral patients had a higher % lymphocytes (t-test P <10 -31 ). The signature was significantly more accurate than any of the individual features (ttest P<10 -18 ) and their combinations (t-test P<10 -15 ), see Fig. 3A ). Figure S11.

IL-2 is required for T-cell proliferation and other activities crucial for regulation of the immune response. 49 IL-6 IL-6 is a cytokine that functions in inflammation and maturation of B cells. IL-6 is an endogenous pyrogen capable of inducing fever in people with autoimmune diseases or infections. 43 IL-8 IL-8 is a member of the CXC chemokine family and functions as one of the major mediators of the inflammatory response. 43 IL-9 IL-9 is a cytokine that acts as a regulator of a variety of hematopoietic cells. IL-9 supports IL-2 independent and IL-4 independent growth of helper T-cells. 43 IL-10 IL-10 is a cytokine produced primarily by monocytes and to a lesser extent by lymphocytes. IL-10 has pleiotropic effects in immunoregulation and inflammation. 48 IL-15 IL-15 is a cytokine that stimulates the proliferation of T-lymphocytes. 49 IL-16 IL-16 functions as a chemo-attractant, a modulator of T cell activation, and an inhibitor of HIV replication. 49 sTNFRSF1A sTNFRSF1A is a receptor for TNFSF2/TNF-\u03b1 and homo-trimeric TNFSF1/lymphotoxin-\u03b1 that contributes to the induction of non-cytocidal TNF effects including anti-viral state and activation of the acid 54 sphingomyelinase.",
