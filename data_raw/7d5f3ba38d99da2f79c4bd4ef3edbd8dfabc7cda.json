            "text": "Recognizing that crowded, high-traffic airports and airplanes have been implicated in respiratory disease transmission, we partnered with administrators of Raleigh Durham International Airport (RDU) in conducting a pilot study of aerosol surveillance for respiratory viruses at RDU. From January to March 2018 we used NIOSH 2-stage samplers to collect 150 min aerosol samples in crowded areas at RDU. Four (17%) of the 24 samples were positive for known respiratory pathogens including influenza D virus and adenovirus. These results suggest the feasibility of employing bioaerosol surveillance techniques in public transportation areas, such as airports, as a noninvasive way to detect and characterize novel respiratory viruses.",

            "text": "As the number of individuals who travel by air increases, issues regarding air quality and the potential risk of respiratory infection during travel and flight have become increasingly important. In the last 20 years alone, there have been outbreaks of several important respiratory viruses that have had a major effect on air travel. A few examples include influenza A(H1N1) pdm09 virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and emerging H7N9 avian influenza A viruses. The outbreak of SARS coronavirus for example can be tracked from the Hotel Metropole in Hong Kong to areas where infected guests traveled by air after staying at the hotel [1] . This risk of the spread of pathogens by air travel has influenced the development of airport passenger screening technologies at airports. Many airports use thermal scanning to screen incoming passengers for febrile illness. In general, these techniques are not entirely effective in preventing the spread of viral infectious disease because passengers, either with a fever or presenting symptoms with respiratory virus infections such as influenza virus, often shed viruses before they have fever. A notable example of the failure of screening methods occurred in 2009 during the spread of influenza A(H1N1) pdm09 virus, where passengers on a flight from Cancun Mexico were screened but still managed to infect other passengers during flight [2] .",

The United States in particular has developed a biomonitoring program that detects pathogens in air samples; however, this system (the US Biowatch) is known to be error prone with numerous false positives frequently detected [4] . An alternative response to this need for public health screening is to concentrate and examine air samples, using personal or standalone air samplers. This bioaerosol sampling technique has been adapted for respiratory virus screening in swine production facilities [5] , poultry markets [6] , clinical settings [7] , and airports [8] . In this pilot study, we studied bioaerosol samples collected in Raleigh Durham International Airport for molecular evidence of respiratory viruses. This international airport sees approximately 11.6 million passengers per year, or about 32,000 per day and uses a high throughput exhaust system (including high efficiency particulate air, HEPA, filters) [9] . Our overall goal was to determine if environmental air sampling is a viable method for respiratory virus detection in airport settings.",

We detected respiratory viruses in 17% of the aerosol samples collected. Through our surveillance, we observed molecular evidence of influenza D virus and adenovirus in aerosol samples through non-invasive and non-disruptive environmental sampling techniques. This sampling approach was particularly important in an airport setting, where large numbers of passengers either sat near or passed by the samplers in the terminal or baggage claim.",

            "text": "This study of aerosols conducted in an airport is likely the first of its kind in the United States. Our detection of adenoviruses in aerosol samples is comparable to similar studies conducted in an airport and other settings [5, 7] . Although respiratory adenoviruses are not typically considered to have as much of an impact as other respiratory viruses, such as influenza viruses, well-documented outbreaks of novel adenovirus strains causing severe respiratory infections have occurred [19] . Despite the fact that the adenoviruses detected in this study were detected using our panspecies molecular assay, upon sequencing, they were identified as human adenoviruses. We did not find evidence of novel or zoonotic viruses in aerosol samples, potentially due to the high throughput ventilation system in place at RDU airport. Another limitation of this study was the inability to link aerosol results with individual passengers, or individual planes. Using this detection method, we were only able to detect viruses from one source (aerosols). As the airport is a high traffic area, and the focus of this study was focused on environmental air sampling, it is not clear which people were harboring the detected viruses. Additionally, as this airport uses a high throughput (HEPA filtered) ventilation system it was not possible to determine the effect of high quality air circulation on our virus detection based on the methods described here and we may not have captured all virus present at the sampling locations. Despite these limitations, the results of this study suggest that aerosol sampling is a useful technique for respiratory virus surveillance in high traffic and crowded areas such as airports. Aerosol sampling has advantages in that it minimally interrupts walking traffic in busy places, is simple in setup and operation, and the processing procedures for isolating the viral nucleic acid is relatively simple [7] . Together with our finding that 17% of collected aerosol samples showed molecular evidence for at least one respiratory pathogen and the ease of aerosol sampler use, our findings suggest that travelers may be sharing respiratory viruses in airports and other high-traffic areas. Such areas may, therefore, benefit from aerosol sampling to strengthen surveillance to protect the public from respiratory viruses. This strengthened surveillance may also support public health responses to respiratory virus detection by allowing airports, or other high traffic areas employing these methods, to recommend interventions (such as respirators or masks) to at risk travelers.",
