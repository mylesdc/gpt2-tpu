            "text": "Our current health research enterprise is painstakingly slow and cumbersome, and its results seldom translate into practice. The slow pace of health research contributes to findings that are less relevant and potentially even obsolete. To produce more rapid, responsive, and relevant research, we propose approaches that increase relevance via greater stakeholder involvement, speed research via innovative designs, streamline review processes, and create and/or better leverage research infrastructure. Broad stakeholder input integrated throughout the research process can both increase relevance and facilitate study procedures. More flexible and rapid research designs should be considered before defaulting to the traditional two-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT), but even traditional RCTs can be designed for more rapid findings. Review processes for grant applications, IRB protocols, and manuscript submissions can be better streamlined to minimize delays. Research infrastructures such as rapid learning systems and other health information technologies can be leveraged to rapidly evaluate new and existing treatments, and alleviate the extensive recruitment delays common in traditional research. These and other approaches are feasible but require a culture shift among the research community to value not only methodological rigor, but also the pace and relevance of research.",

Randomized efficacy trials take approximately 5.5 years from the initiation of enrollment to publication [1] , and 7 years or longer after adding the time from grant application submission to enrollment initiation. Extensive follow-up periods for relevant outcomes such as morbidity/mortality as well as delays in participant recruitment and publication can extend this time period to a decade or longer. During this period, scientific and technological advances will occur that may make the eventual findings less relevant or even obsolete. For illustration, Figure 1 shows a few of the salient consumer technologies introduced during a typical seven year clinical trial. These recent advances in consumer technologies are most impactful for mobile and wireless health research, [2] but many less mainstream scientific and medical technological advances also occur while clinical trials are being conducted. For example, one explanation for the recently reported negative results of the SAMMPRIS trial was that stent technologies and surgery procedures had advanced substantially since study initiation [3, 4] .",

To begin progress toward such a system, we considered and have described approaches to make research more rapid, responsive and relevant (R3), organized into four sections for the purpose of this paper: 1) stakeholder engagement, 2) design, 3) review, and 4) infrastructure (see Table 1 ). These suggested approaches are viewed as a starting point for a dialogue among the health research community to challenge our current cumbersome research enterprise and to consider these or other approaches to maintain scientific rigor while speeding the process by which more responsive and relevant research findings are produced.",

More importantly, stakeholder engagement increases the likelihood that findings will be relevant to stakeholders and more readily adopted into practice, thereby making the overall research pipeline more efficient. These \"evaluability assessments\" [8] or participatory approaches are considered key to facilitating the adoption of research findings by practitioners [9] . The Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI), for example, is creating public advisory groups and soliciting patient input on specific comparative effectiveness questions that are relevant to practitioners and stakeholders [10] . An ongoing relationship between researchers, healthcare providers, health plans, and patients is critical to a better, faster research system. Clinical trial recruitment is a major problem with about 90% of US trials failing to meet enrollment goals [7] . The NIH Health Care System Collaboratory (HCSC) offers an important resource for rapid research. Like the HMO Research Network and the VA QUERI program, the HCSC will make available opportunities to conduct large-scale studies within well-organized healthcare delivery systems [11] . Research embedded in organized delivery systems and networks enhances not only research relevance, but also facilitates recruitment, retention, study start-up, operations, data capture, and integration into practice. An accelerated research system can also use information technologies to speed the process of seeking and obtaining stakeholder feedback. Consistent with a citizen-scientist model [12] , a virtual network of various stakeholders can participate and provide feedback throughout the research process using online surveys, virtual meetings, and social media systems [13] . Via innovative technologies, stakeholder feedback can be obtained efficiently to increase research relevance and responsiveness, even for researchers who are not fully integrated into the practice setting or community where their research findings are likely to be translated into practice.",

Instead, we recommend replacing the traditional pilot trial with a more flexible iterative intervention testing and optimization approach, analogous to the agile software development process that places a premium on failing early to succeed later [15] . For example, N-of-1 trial designs provide intervention development flexibility. With the increasing availability of intensive longitudinal data from wireless sensors and mobile devices, N-of-1 trials can be rapidly implemented and provide results congruent with a more personalized medicine approach [16] , and Bayesian analyses from a series of such trials [17] may provide sufficient evidence of generalizability to limit the need for a larger trial.",
