            "text": "Novel infectious diseases continue to emerge within human populations. Predictive studies have begun to identify pathogen traits associated with emergence. However, emerging pathogens vary widely in virulence, a key determinant of their ultimate risk to public health. Here, we use structured literature searches to review the virulence of each of the 214 known human-infective RNA virus species. We then use a machine learning framework to determine whether viral virulence can be predicted by ecological traits, including human-tohuman transmissibility, transmission routes, tissue tropisms, and host range. Using severity of clinical disease as a measurement of virulence, we identified potential risk factors using predictive classification tree and random forest ensemble models. The random forest approach predicted literature-assigned disease severity of test data with mean accuracy of 89.4% compared to a null accuracy of 74.2%. In addition to viral taxonomy, the ability to cause systemic infection was the strongest predictor of severe disease. Further notable predictors of severe disease included having neural and/or renal tropism, direct contact or respiratory transmission, and limited (0 < R 0 \ufffd 1) human-to-human transmissibility. We present a novel, to our knowledge, comparative perspective on the virulence of all currently known human RNA virus species. The risk factors identified may provide novel perspectives in understanding the evolution of virulence and elucidating molecular virulence mechanisms. These risk factors could also improve planning and preparedness in public health strategies as part of a predictive framework for novel human infections.",

            "text": "The emergence of novel infectious diseases continues to represent a threat to global public health. Emerging pathogens have been defined as those newly recognised infections of humans following zoonotic transmission or those increasing in incidence and/or geographic range [1] . High-profile examples of emerging pathogens include the discovery of the novel Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus from cases of respiratory illness in 2012 [2] and the expansion of the range of Zika virus across the South Pacific and the Americas [3] . The emergence of previously unseen viruses means that the set of known human viruses continually could not be assigned a disease severity rating and were excluded from all analyses (hepatitis delta virus, which is reliant on hepatitis B virus coinfection, and primate T-lymphotropic virus 3, which may be associated with chronic disease like other T-lymphotropic viruses but has not been known in humans long enough for cohort observations). Disease severity differed between viral taxonomic families (Fisher's exact, 1,000 simulations, p < 0.001), with Arenaviridae, Filoviridae, and Hantaviridae having the highest fractions of severe-rated virus species (Fig 1) . Although 55 of 172 viruses considered zoonotic were rated 'severe', we note that only 3 of 40 nonzoonotic viruses were rated as causing severe disease (hepacivirus C and human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] 1 and 2). Fatalities were reported in healthy adults for 64 viruses and in vulnerable individuals only for an additional 26 viruses, whilst eight viruses rated 'nonsevere' had severe strains, six of which belonged to the family Picornaviridae.",

Using this training set, we then constructed a single classification tree that aimed to optimally classify viruses in virulence based on their ecological traits. The final pruned classification tree included variables relating to transmissibility, tissue tropism, and taxonomy (Fig 2) . Severe disease was predicted by the model for four generalised groups: i) viruses with a neural or systemic primary tropism with limited human-to-human transmissibility (excluding orthomyxoviruses, phenuiviruses, and reoviruses); ii) viruses known to have a renal tropism (primary or otherwise); iii) hantaviruses; and iv) retroviruses with sustained human-to-human transmissibility.",

We therefore constructed a random forest model containing 5,000 individual trees, each built using a bootstrapped sample of the training data and a randomly restricted subset of predictors, and repeated this approach over 200 alternative training/ test set partitions. Averaging over these bootstrapped random forests, the most informative predictor variables for classifying virulence were taxonomic family and primary tissue tropism (Fig 3) . However, primary transmission route, human-to-human transmissibility level, and having a known neural or renal tropism were also relatively informative, broadly mirroring the risk factors observed in the single tree. Host range predictors were generally uninformative. To identify whether virulence risk factors might differ for non-human-adapted viruses, we repeated our machine learning analysis for only those viruses with known or suspected zoonotic transmission. For zoonotic viruses, the most informative predictors were similar (Fig 3) , though transmission route variables (primary transmission route, having known vector-borne transmission) appeared to increase in relative importance.",

In both classification tree and random forest models, viruses were more likely to be predicted to cause severe disease if they caused systemic infections, had neural or renal tropism, transmitted via direct contact or respiratory routes, or had limited capability to transmit between humans (0 < R 0 \ufffd 1).

Few studies have directly predicted how tissue tropism should influence virulence. The identified risk factor tropisms could be explainable as a simple function of pathology occurring in sensitive or multiple tissues, respectively, increasing intensity of clinical disease. However, it has been suggested that an excessive, nonadapted virulence may result if infections occur within nontarget tissues that do not contribute to transmission [30] , although the evolutionary determinants of tissue tropism are not wellunderstood [31] . Tissue tropism should be a key consideration for future comparative and evolutionary modelling efforts. We also found viruses primarily transmitted by direct contact and respiratory routes to have a higher predicted probability of severe virulence than viruses transmitted by vectorborne or faecal-oral routes. Contrastingly, previous comparative analyses pooling several microparasite types, including a limited range of viruses, have shown positive associations between virulence and vector-borne transmission [17] or environmental survivability [18] . Ewald [17] suggested virulence has fewer costs to pathogen fitness if transmission can occur independent of host health and mobility, e.g., through arthropod vectors or contaminated water, though we did not observe support for this hypothesis in our analysis.",

Firstly, random forest models suggested a lower risk of severe virulence for viruses with sustained human-to-human transmissibility (level 4) than self-limited transmissibility (level 3) (Fig 4) . This appears consistent with hypothesised virulence-transmissibility tradeoffs [21, 32, 33] and suggests that the adaptation necessary to develop efficient human-to-human transmissibility could result in attenuation of virulence in RNA viruses. Sustained transmissibility appeared to positively predict severe disease for a specific subset of four viruses in the single classification tree (Fig 2) , all retroviruses causing chronic syndromes (HIV 1 and 2 and primate T-lymphotropic virus 1 and 2), which are likely subject to different evolutionary dynamics-if disease occurs after the infectious period, virulence brings fewer costs to pathogens from host mortality, essentially 'decoupling' from transmission [23] . We note only three nonchronic level 4 viruses rated severe: severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus, yellow fever virus, and Zaire ebolavirus.",

One way to address this information gap would be use of available data from animal infections, assuming that tissue tropism and transmission route do not differ between human and nonhuman hosts.

Therefore, virulence was rated using a simple two-category measure of severity of typical disease in humans. We rated viruses as 'severe' if they firstly had \ufffd5% CFR when data were available (159/214 viruses, including those with zero CFR); otherwise, we rated viruses as 'severe' if they had frequent reports of hospitalisation, were associated with significant morbidity from certain conditions (haemorrhagic fever, seizures/coma, cirrhosis, AIDS, hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, HTLV-associated myelopathy), or were explicitly described as 'severe' or 'causing severe disease' (S1 Table) . We rated viruses as 'nonsevere' if none of these conditions were met. We note that this led to 'nonsevere' ratings for some viruses with clinically severe but rare syndromes; e.g., dengue virus can cause haemorrhagic dengue fever, though this is much rarer than typical acute dengue fever [46, 47] . To address this, data were also collected on whether the virus has caused fatalities in vulnerable individuals (defined as age 16 and below or 60 and above, immunosuppressed, having comorbidities, or otherwise cited as being 'at-risk' by sources for specific viruses) and in healthy adults and whether any 'nonsevere' virus has atypically severe strains (e.g., most infections with viruses within the species Human enterovirus C cause mild disease; however, poliovirus, which causes severe paralytic disease, is also classified under this species). These were examined both individually and within a composite six-rank system (S4 Table) .",

Firstly, primary transmission route was categorised as the dominant route the virus is transmitted by: vectorborne (excluding mechanical transmission), direct contact, faecal-oral, or respiratory transmission. Primary tissue tropism was similarly categorised as the dominant organ system the virus typically infects or targets, specified as neural, gastrointestinal, hepatic, respiratory, circulatory, vascular, or 'systemic' (typical infection within multiple organ systems with no clear, single dominant tropism). However, many human viruses are known from isolation from blood or serum, with no further evidence of specific tissue tropisms (n = 69).

In order to avoid bias from an imbalance between types of viruses assigned to training and test sets, our selection was based on random sampling, stratified by genus-severity rating combinations. We sampled at a ratio of 75:25, i.e., for the four known severe viruses in the genus Ebolavirus, three were randomly assigned to the training set and the remaining one assigned to the test set. If a genus-severity combination contained less than four viruses, all defaulted to the test set. Comparative risk factor analyses were firstly carried out by constructing a classification tree using the R package 'rpart' v4.1-11 [52] . Classification trees are a simple form of machine learning models that aim to optimally classify data points into their correct category of outcome variable based on a structure of binary predictor splits. Tree-based methods are well-suited for comparative analyses in which confounding often results from taxonomic signal or suites of otherwise co-occurring traits because their high structure can intuitively fit complex nonlinear interactions and local effects.",

To prevent overfitting, the tree was pruned back to the optimal branching size, taken as the most common consensus size over 1,000 repeats of 10-fold cross-validation. To validate the predictive power of the classification tree, predictions of virulence rating were generated when applied to the test set. Tree accuracy was then calculated, comparing the proportion of correct predictions compared to literature-assigned ratings (assuming these to be 100% accurate as the 'gold standard' or 'ground truth'). Because virulence ratings were imbalanced (i.e., only a minority of viruses cause severe disease, so correct nonsevere classifications are likely to be achieved by chance), accuracy was directly compared to the null model, i.e., a model with no predictors that predicted 'nonsevere' for all viruses. Additional diagnostics of interest (sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, and true skill statistic [54] ) were also obtained. Although classification trees have the advantage of presenting an interpretable schematic of risk factor effects and directions, individual tree structures may be sensitive to particular data points and have no intuitive measures of uncertainty. We therefore generated a further 200 partitions of our data into alternative training/test sets using the random stratified sampling procedure described. Then, for each partition, we constructed a random forest, an ensemble collection of a large number of bootstrapped classification trees [55] . Having many predictor variables compared to the relatively limited and fixed number of human-infective RNA virus species, random forests handle such 'large p, small n' data architecture much more easily than traditional regression frameworks [56] . Missing data in all predictors were imputed using the R package 'missForest' v1.4 [57] . Using the R package 'randomForest' v4.6-12 [57] , random forests were created containing 5,000 individual trees, each built using a bootstrapped sample of training data and restricted to a randomly selected subset of predictors (k = 5) at each branching split. The predictive power of the random forest approach was evaluated by averaging over the test set predictions from all partitions. Receiver operating characteristic curves were visualised and area under curves calculated to directly compare to the classification tree methodology.",

Instead, potential virulence risk factors were evaluated using two metrics: variable importance and partial dependence. Variable importance is calculated as the mean decrease in Gini impurity following tree splits on the predictor and can be considered as how informative the risk factor was towards correctly predicting virulence. Partial dependence is calculated as the mean relative change in log-odds of predicting severe virulence, which were converted to predicted probabilities of severity associated with each risk factor. Partial dependence describes marginal effects averaging across any influence of other predictors, and, as such, point estimates may not reflect any complex risk factor interactions. Therefore, to test hypotheses regarding virulence risk factors, we present both averaged random forest partial dependence and the less robust but more accessible single classification tree for its ease of interpretation in risk factor structure and directly compare the statistical validity of both methods by plotting receiver operating characteristic curves.
