            "text": "A n important genetic tool to study animal, positive-sense RNA viruses is the infectious clone, a form of viral genome cloned on a plasmid that can be propagated in Escherichia coli and manipulated for reverse-genetics analysis. While the tool has yielded important insights into viral infection and is critical for generating vaccine candidates, the instability of certain viral genome sequences in E. coli (especially in the cases of most flaviviruses [1] and coronaviruses [2] and of some picornaviruses [3] , togaviruses [4] , and pestiviruses [5] ) has limited the scale of genetic analyses for these viruses. The instability is still not well understood. Consequently, each mutant construct must be extensively sequenced to verify the absence of adventitious mutations, potentially resulting in months of efforts to establish one such clone. Though there are many cloning approaches to mitigate the instability (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) , a large-scale genetic analysis relying on cloning methods still requires significant efforts to establish the mutant or chimeric viruses. In addition, the cloning methods are not adept at capturing the diversity of a virus pool for manipulation and screening, hindering the application of available genetic approaches to study viruses.",

The DENV genome could be reconstructed from multiple PCR products (amplified from cDNA) in a single DNA assembly reaction. Unlike the conventional DNA ligation method, DNA assembly by Gibson assembly (12) , which was used in this technique, stitches DNA through overlapping, homologous sequences at the ends of DNA fragments, thus negating any need to introduce foreign sequences to accommodate ligation and providing the flexibility of being able to join DNA at any locations on the viral genome. To produce virus from DNA, viral PCR products, amplified from viral cDNA using high-fidelity polymerase with proofreading activity, were assembled onto an expression plasmid with a cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter that precisely initiated transcription on the virus genome sequence and a terminator, such as hepatitis D virus (HDV) ribozyme, that accurately generated 3= end of the transcribed viral RNA (13, 14) (Fig. 1A) .",

The recovery depended on intactness of assembled DNA, as determined by excluding a genome segment or treatment with DNase before transfection inhibited virus production (data not shown).

DNA sequencing of the recovered DENV4-v17 showed sequence heterogeneities at two positions, as observed in the original DENV4-v17 stock used to derive its template cDNA, while further culture of DENV4-v17 in C6/36 cells, a mosquito cell line usually used for DENV isolation and recovery, lost the NS4B mutations (Fig. 1C) . The heterogeneities in focus size and sequence of the recovered viruses demonstrated the ability of this technique to retain a pool of virus mutants. In addition to similar focus characteristics, the recovered viruses also possessed growth curves similar to those of either the original viruses used as PCR templates or virus derived from an infectious clone, in the case of DENV2-16681 ( Fig. 2A to C). In addition to recovery of a heterogeneous viral pool, Gibson assembly could be used for efficient construction of mutant viruses. To date, over 100 mutant DENVs (in addition to the ones presented here) have been constructed by this approach. Sequence verification by the Sanger method (10 viruses fully sequenced and the rest sequenced on the mutant genes and the assembled sites) confirmed that the desired mutations were obtained in all cases. A comparison between the foci of a set of mutant viruses generated from Gibson assembly and from a sequence-verified infectious clone also showed similar phenotypes (Fig. 2D) .",

Instead of having to verify the DNA sequence of each full-length chimeric clone, as required by the infectious-clone approach, the shuffling requires sequencing of only two sets of viral DNA templates, greatly cutting down sequence verification in a large-scale mapping effort.

With PCR products as the building blocks for viral infectious DNA, the approach can exploit various PCR techniques (error-prone PCR, DNA shuffling, and PCR with degenerate primers) to diversify virus sequences to produce mutant libraries. Screening and sorting of the libraries provide powerful methods to study the genetic basis of a phenotype. We created a virus library using a degenerate primer to randomize an amino acid at position E1690 (Fig.  4A ). The mapping in Fig. 3 showed that the amino acid at E1690 has a strong influence on the focus size. Randomizing the amino acid at this position will generate a DENV library that can be used to study how the property of this critical amino acid affects focus size.",

The sequence chromatograms of prM847 (Fig. 4B , M) and NS4B7016 (Fig. 4B, NS4B) showed heterogeneity, as observed with the original DENV4-v17 stock (Fig. 1D) . The focus assay of the DENV library indicated the presence of small-focus viruses that were not present when the amino acid at E1690 was not randomized in the same genetic background (Fig. 4C) . Thus, by assembling the scrambled PCR products with those derived from heterogeneous viral cDNAs, this technique could directly diversify an existing pool of virus mutants. This capability is essential in directed-evolution experiments, where the mutant pool selected from each round is directly diversified for the next round of selection.",

            "text": "The ease of assembling PCR products by Gibson assembly greatly simplifies genetic engineering of viral genomes. Traditional DNA ligation relies on complementary sticky ends generated by cutting DNA with restriction enzymes. The use of restriction enzymes has limited DNA assembly from multiple PCR products, as adding restriction sites must not interfere with the functions of the sequences at the joints. The restriction sites must also be unique to specifically ligate DNA. Seamless DNA assembly techniques, such as Gibson assembly (12), In-fusion (Agilent) (18, 19) , SLIC (20) , and SLiCE (21), could solve this problem by generating sticky ends on any linear DNA. Subsequent annealing of complementary single-stranded DNA overhangs and ligation of annealed fragments joins the DNA in a specific manner. Similar seamless assembly, such as CPEC (22) and SHA (23) , relies on the annealing of cDNA strands at the ends to join DNA fragments during PCR amplification. In principle, any of these seamless DNA assembly techniques may be substituted for Gibson assembly in the virus construction approach presented here. Very recently, CPEC was applied to construct West Nile viruses in a similar bacterium-free approach for virus construction (24) . The virus construction by CPEC could achieve similar recovery of the heterogeneity of a West Nile virus stock (24) . Together, these results show the applicability of a seamless technique in virus recovery.",

The capability of Gibson assembly, as demonstrated in its application to the construction of mitochondrial genomes from oligonucleotides (25), would accommodate even finer fragmentation of viral genomes than ours (Fig. 1A) and make the approach applicable to RNA viruses with larger genomes, such as coronaviruses. While the data presented here show high accuracy of reconstructing viruses by this method, the possibility of unintended mutations caused by random PCR errors cannot be ruled out when viruses are constructed from PCR products. Confirming the identified mutations with additional methods and assays, such as full-genome sequencing of the derived viruses, will prevent such errors. The virus construction approach described here addresses the throughput limitations of infectious clones. It shortens the construction time from months to days. It can recover the genetic diversity in the virus stock ( Fig. 1B and D) . It significantly reduces the amount of sequence verification required in a large-scale genetic analysis through the ease of recombining viruses (Fig. 3) . It enables direct genetic manipulation of a virus mutant pool (Fig.  4) . By eliminating these limitations, this approach supports largescale forward genetics (Fig. 3 ) and expands our current ability to mutate viruses for reverse genetics and directed-evolution experiments (Fig. 4) . Its capability is based on direct exploitation of PCR products amplified from viral cDNA as building blocks to construct infectious viral DNA in a single, highly efficient reaction of Gibson assembly. The throughput capability gained will support functional characterization of virus variants, which are being discovered at a breakneck pace by next-generation sequencing. Since it relies on a DNA-based expression format applicable to many positive-sense RNA viruses, its utility will be relevant to these viruses (13, 26, 27) . The technique should accelerate vaccine and antiviral-drug development to fight against many pathogenic positive-sense RNA viruses.",
