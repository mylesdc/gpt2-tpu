In this study, a novel farnesyltransferase inhibitor (IMB-1406) was identified through virtual screening. It exhibits stronger potency (IC 50 s: 6.92-8.99 \u03bcM) than Sunitinib against all of the tested cancer cell lines. Preliminary studies on mechanism reveal that IMB-1406 induces apoptosis in HepG2 cells by arresting the cell cycle at the S phase, altering anti-and pro-apoptotic proteins leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and activation of caspase-3. This anti-tumor effect is most probably related to the inhibition of farnesyltransferase as indicated by molecular docking. Overall, IMB-1406 is a novel lead compound with potent antitumor activity and deserves further structural modifications.",

Virtual screening (VS) has emerged as a powerful approach to complement the array of existing high-throughput screening technologies [14, 15] . Using computer-aided VS, potential leads can be rapidly identified in silico in order to narrow the range of molecules to be tested in vitro and in vivo.

The CDOCKER energy (-(protein-ligand interaction energies)) of best poses docked into the receptor of all the 900 compounds was calculated and compared with that of Compound 4 which is a new potent farnesyltransferase inhibitor based on the ethylenediamine scaffold. As a result, IMB-1406 was found to have the highest CDOCKER energy and similar structural framework to the crystallized inhibitor (Compound 4) [23] of farnesyltransferase, as shown in Figure 1 .",

As described above, both the para-benzonitrile moiety of the Compound 4 and the 6-bromo-2-methoxyquinoline one of IMB-1406 are oriented toward the product exit groove and are partially stabilized by a stacking interaction with Y361\u03b2. In Figure 2B , there are three hydrogen bonding interactions between the N22 and O33 positions of IMB-1406 and R202\u03b2. This is consistent with the -CDOCKER_INTERACTION_ENERGY between the two compounds and the farnesyltransferase. The highest -CDOCKER_INTERACTION_ENERGY was 52.24 for IMB-1406 and that of Compound 4 was 57.22, suggesting that IMB-1406 could have similar affinity with the Compound 4 and the farnesyltransferase might be one of the possible targets for IMB-1406.",

Moreover, preliminary study on mechanism revealed that IMB-1406 induces apoptosis in HepG2 cells by arresting the cell cycle at the S phase, altering anti-and proapoptotic proteins leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and activation of caspase-3. Meanwhile, molecular docking study suggested one of the possible targets for IMB-1406 was protein farnesyltransferase. Together, IMB-1406 is a novel conjugate with potent antitumor activity, and it could contribute to a better understanding of structure-based drug design to facilitate drug discovery. Based on this, further structural modifications, SAR studies and enzyme inhibitory activity of IMB-1406 are currently in progress.",
