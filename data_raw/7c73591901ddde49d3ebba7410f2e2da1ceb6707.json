            "text": "Reversible phosphorylation is one of the major mechanisms of signal transduction, and signaling networks are critical regulators of cell growth and development. However, few of these networks have been delineated completely. Towards this end, quantitative phosphoproteomics is emerging as a useful tool enabling large-scale determination of relative phosphorylation levels. However, phosphoproteomics differs from classical proteomics by a more extensive sampling limitation due to the limited number of detectable sites per protein. Here, we propose a comprehensive quantitative analysis pipeline customized for phosphoproteome data from interventional experiments for identifying key proteins in specific pathways, discovering the protein-protein interactions and inferring the signaling network. We also made an effort to partially compensate for the missing value problem, a chronic issue for proteomics studies. The dataset used for this study was generated using SILAC (Stable Isotope Labeling with Amino acids in Cell culture) technique with interventional experiments (kinase-dead mutations). The major components of the pipeline include phosphopeptide meta-analysis, correlation network analysis and causal relationship discovery. We have successfully applied our pipeline to interventional experiments identifying phosphorylation events underlying the transition to a filamentous growth form in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We identified 5 high-confidence proteins from meta-analysis, and 19 hub proteins from correlation analysis (Pbi2p and Hsp42p were identified by both analyses). All these proteins are involved in stress responses. Nine of them have direct or indirect evidence of involvement in filamentous growth. In addition, we tested four of our predicted proteins, Nth1p, Pbi2p, Pdr12p and Rcn2p, by interventional phenotypic experiments and all of them present differential invasive growth, providing prospective validation of our approach. This comprehensive pipeline presents a systematic way for discovering signaling networks using interventional phosphoproteome data and can suggest candidate proteins for further investigation. We anticipate the methodology to be applicable as well to other interventional studies via different experimental platforms.",

Dysregulation of these processes is a major factor in the emergence of many diseases, including cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Reversible phosphorylation is one of the major forms of signal transduction and can affect protein function and gene expression [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . Investigations into phosphorylation provide insight into signaling pathways by providing the target sites of phosphorylation and the quantitative changes in phosphorylation level in response to genetic or environmental perturbations.

The phosphoproteome data utilized in this analysis was obtained from interventional experiments of a subset of yeast kinases involved in filamentous growth. Filamentous growth is a developmental transition observed in S. cerevisiae where yeast cells form elongated and connected multicellular filaments; these filaments resemble hyphae but lack the parallelsided walls and structure of true hyphal tubes. This pseudohyphal growth transition is induced in response to several cell stresses, including nitrogen stress, growth in the presence of short-chain alcohols, and glucose stress [14] [15] [16] [17] . The filamentous growth form presumably represents a foraging mechanism enabling non-motile yeast to better survive cell stress [14] . During pseudohyphal growth, yeast cells elongate due to a delay in the G2/M transition, exhibit an altered budding pattern, and remain connected after cytokinesis [18, 19] . The resulting pseudohyphal filaments extend superficially from a colony over an agar substrate and invasively downward into the solid substrate below the colony. In liquid culture under inducing conditions, a filamentous strain of yeast exhibits elongated cells and multicellular filaments encompassing typically 3-4 cells. It is important to note that most laboratory strains of S. cerevisiae are non-filamentous and that studies of filamentous growth are typically performed in the g1278b strain, which we employ here.",

            "text": "The molecular basis of filamentous growth in S. cerevisiae is broad in scope. Classic studies have identified key kinase-based signaling networks that regulate the filamentous growth transition. In particular, yeast filamentous growth is regulated by mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and protein kinase A (PKA) pathways [15, 20, 21] as well as being impacted by other signaling pathways. MAPK pathways are evolutionarily conserved across phyla and consist of three-kinase cascades serving central roles in signal transduction in eukaryotic cells [22] ; the yeast filamentous growth MAPK cascade terminates in the MAPK Kss1p. In S. cerevisiae, PKA consists of the regulatory subunit Bcy1p and one of three catalytic subunits Tpk1p, Tpk2p, or Tpk3p; Tpk2p is known to be required for filamentous growth [23] [24] [25] . It should be noted that the Kss1p MAPK pathway is required for pseudohyphal growth induced by both nitrogen stress and butanol, while the genes GPR1, MEP2, and GPA2, acting upstream of PKA, are not required for butanol-induced filamentous growth [16] . In our experiments, we treated cells with 1% (vol/vol) butanol to induce filamentous growth [26] . A graphical illustration of currently recognized budding yeast filamentous growth pathways, integrating information from authoritative pathway databases and reviews, is shown in Figure 1 . While these core signaling units are well defined, the downstream scope of their signaling networks is unclear.",

Specifically, we generated kinase-dead mutations (also called kinase-inactivating mutations) for a set of eight kinases that we have identified as components of the yeast filamentous growth response: Ksp1p, Kss1p, Sks1p, Ste20p, Snf1p, Tpk2p, Elm1p and Fus3p [20, [26] [27] [28] . Each of these kinases exhibits a filamentous growth deletion phenotype, with the deletion of KSP1, KSS1, SKS1, STE20, SNF1, and TPK2 yielding a loss of filamentous growth and the deletion of ELM1 and FUS3 yielding enhanced filamentation. The kinase-dead alleles of these proteins were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis. The system-wide phosphorylation responses of the mutant strains were determined using SILAC approach, and we used the Mascot search engine [29] followed by MaxQuant software [30] to identify and quantify peptides and proteins. We obtained phosphorylation level changes from the MaxQuant analysis for mutants versus wild type control for the comprehensive quantitative analyses.",

Bioinformatics methods provide a promising avenue with which local kinase signaling relationships can be identified. While traditional cluster analyses associated with functional enrichment analysis are useful tools, their performance might be affected by the missing value issue. We need to deal with it in order to obtain reliable clusters and enriched functions. Furthermore, a more integrative and extensive analysis is necessary to find new components of the pathways, uncover relationships between the pathway components, and to elaborate the signaling network structure. Thus we propose this comprehensive quantitative analysis pipeline customized for SILAC data, and partially compensate the missing value issue. The major building blocks include phosphopeptide meta-analysis, correlation network analysis, causal relationship discovery, and validation by literature mining. We have successfully applied the pipeline to analyze our current yeast data. Candidate proteins predicted to contribute to the filamentous growth response were selected by phosphopeptide meta-analysis and correlation network analysis. Causal relationship discovery was performed on candidate proteins identified from our analysis and validated proteins from the literature. The inferred causal relationships, along with the interactions inferred from phosphorylation changes in response to individual mutants, have suggested potential proteins that can be further intervened and studied in the future.",

Here, we provide an analysis of phosphoproteome datasets from yeast, utilizing kinase mutants versus wild type strains. In order to provide an objective approach to identify candidate proteins involved in the transition to a filamentous growth form, we proposed and applied a comprehensive pipeline incorporating statistical and mathematical methods to investigate the phosphoproteome data from multiple perspectives. This included phosphorylation variation in response to a single mutant, phosphorylation variation patterns over multiple mutants, and the relationships represented by these patterns.

In other words, the overlap within a triplex run should be near 100% but the overlap between different triplex runs will be lower due to instrument sampling limitations.

Six other proteins, Are2p, Dcp2p, Hsp42p, Ssd1p, Sum1p, and Ufd1p, have reported evidence in terms of genetic and/or physical interactions with known components of filamentous growth. The remaining proteins have been implicated in various stress responses, including the unfolded protein response (e.g., sensitivity to tunicamycin), osmotic shock, and thermal shock, but not previously linked to filamentous growth. Pbi2p has not been reported previously as being involved in filamentous growth; however, our experimental results indicate that a haploid strain of S. cerevisiae deleted for PBI2 exhibits decreased invasive growth relative to wild type (see Experimental validation in Results). Gpd2p and Lys21p are two self-connected proteins. The selfconnection was built up by two distinct phosphorylation sites on the protein. Gpd2p has not been related to filamentous growth in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Its homolog Gpd2p in Candida albicans, is involved in core stress responses, and GPD2 is induced upon pseudohyphal growth in S. cerevisiae [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] .",

The network comprising all the causal relationships is presented in Figure 6 . Among those, only 6 protein pairs have the posterior probability higher than 0.7. The other protein pairs do not have high probability since the samples available for training the model is limited due to the missing data issue caused by instrument limitation. The arrows in Figure 6 only indicate the existence of causal influence, but do not specify whether the influence is activation or inhibition. The causal relationship discovered might be between proteins that are not immediately adjacent in pathways so the relationship could be quite indirect. For example, the causal relationship between Rcn2p and Ste20p might be indirect: Rcn2p and Bmh1p have physical interaction captured by affinity capture-MS [42] , while Bmh1p associates with Ste20p to influence filamentous growth [47] . Through another inspection of the phosphorylation change patterns of the peptide pairs detected with relatively strong causal influences (posterior probability higher than 0.7), we observed that: Ste20p has opposing phosphorylation changes compared to Are2p, Pdr12p and Sec21p; two phosphopeptides (the same amino acid sequence but different phosphorylation sites) on Hsp42p present opposing phosphorylation changes compared to Ste20p; and Pbp1p presents consistent phosphorylation change compared to Ste20p. With caution we predict that the opposing pattern implicates an inhibitive influence of Are2p, Pdr12p and Sec21p to Ste20p; and similarly, inhibition of Hsp42p to Ste20p; while Pbp1p shed activating influence to Ste20p. Again, we emphasize that the influence might be quite indirect and even be influenced by multiple pathways.",

To determine if these proteins do in fact impact filamentous growth in S. cerevisiae, we constructed haploid strains singly deleted for each gene and assayed for filamentation phenotypes. Precise gene deletions were carried out using a standard PCR-based strategy, and resulting haploid strains were assayed for invasive growth by standard platewashing assays under normal growth conditions [17] . Invasive growth, characterized by filament penetration into the agar substrate, was decreased upon deletion of PBI2 relative to wildtype. In addition, the deletion of NTH1, PDR12, and RCN2 yielded exaggerated invasive growth relative to an otherwise isogenic wild-type strain. Results are shown in Figure 7 . All four proteins have been previously implicated in various yeast stress responses, but not specifically with respect to filamentous growth [38, 52, [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] [63] . Nth1p, i.e. neutral trehalase, is involved in the trehalose pathway, which is a glucose storage pathway [64] . Pbi2p is a cytosolic inhibitor of vacuolar proteinase B, and is involved in the regulation of proteolysis [65] [66] [67] [68] [69] . Rcn2p, a regulator of calcineurin [70] , is induced in response to DNAdamaging agents [59] . Pdr12p is a multidrug transporter inducible by weak acid, and is required for weak organic acid resistance [71, 72] . These four proteins are not reported to be signaling molecules themselves, but we demonstrate that they appear to play roles in filamentous growth and are likely downstream targets of the filamentous growth pathways.",

The resulting strains were grown 3-4 days under normal growth conditions, and invasive growth was assayed in these strains and in a wildtype strain according to standard protocols using a plate-washing assay. Deletion of PBI2 resulted in decreased invasive growth upon plate washing, and strains deleted for PDR12, RCN2, and NTH1 yielded hyperactive invasive growth.

            "text": "In this study, we demonstrate that interventional phosphoproteome studies can provide new insight into signaling pathways involved in biological processes such as yeast filamentous growth. In order to increase sensitivity to smaller changes in phosphorylation relative to previous yeast global phosphoproteome studies [5, 6] , we used SILAC, an isotope labeling approach. Isotope labeling approaches are generally more precise relative to labelfree approaches [11] , but require greater resources to implement, resulting in trade-offs between precision and missing data due to sampling limitations inherent to current instruments. We proposed and developed a comprehensive computational and statistical analysis pipeline for the post-identification studies of phosphoproteome data. The analyses are aimed at discovering candidate components of significant pathways involved in filamentous growth as well as the potential targets of the pathways, and to provide more information on the signaling network structure by monitoring changes in phosphorylation in response to mutational interventions. We applied the pipeline to analyze our interim high mass accuracy yeast phosphoproteome datasets and a total of 882 unique phosphopeptides representing 486 proteins were identified as significantly influenced by at least one out of 8 kinase-dead mutants. Twenty-eight unique phosphopeptides having globally significant phosphorylation were identified from the whole dataset among which 5 peptides representing 5 proteins, Nth1p, Pbi2p, Rcn2p, Pdr12p and Hsp42p, were identified as high-confidence candidates. Nineteen candidate proteins with relatively high degrees of connectivity were selected as hub proteins in the stringent correlation network (Pbi2p and Hsp42p were identified as hub proteins too). Among the high-confidence candidate proteins, 3 proteins have been previously reported to be directly involved in filamentous growth and another 6 proteins were also supported, in terms of genetic and physical interactions with known components involved in filamentous growth. The remaining proteins have been implicated in various other stress responses and may play roles in filamentous growth or may be secondary stress responders. In particular, we validated four candidate proteins, Nth1p, Pbi2p, Pdr12p and Rcn2p as impacting invasive growth. Causal relationship discovery was further performed on the candidates and validated proteins. The inferred causal relationships, along with the interactions inferred from phosphorylation changes in response to individual mutants, form phosphoprotein interaction networks, which suggested potential proteins to be intervened in future studies.",

Many of these kinases are known to also affect pathways that are not involved directly in filamentous growth.

The sensitivity of such detection is constrained by the degree of overlap between pathways, the coverage of pathways by the mutants, and the extent of missing data.

This feature of tandem mass spectra of complex mixtures results in poor overlap of peptides identified across samples unless a relatively large number of replicate experiments are carried out (which is time consuming and often economically impractical for large-scale projects). For this reason, a significant number of missing values exist in these datasets which can obscure potential candidates for further validation studies. This is likely to be alleviated to some extent in the future as mass spectrometry technologies continue to improve, but we have developed methods to partially compensate for the missing data issue. In the phosphopeptide meta-analysis, an extension of Fisher's combined probability test was made to relax the restrictions of complete measurements. The causal network modeling component was also developed to allow missing values without excluding the incomplete measurements. We also performed cluster analysis of phosphopeptides. Instead of adopting traditional clustering methods, we directly identified the most stable clusters using missing value-imputed data. Our approach was able to pick out significantly enriched functions, and identify a number of reliable candidate proteins for further validation of which four were validated.",

The cultures were grown to log phase, and treated with 1% (vol/vol) butanol to induce filamentous growth [26] . The treated samples were incubated for another 16 hours to obtain enough proteins for mass spectrometry analysis. The final O.D. at 600 nm reached a high value usually between 1.0 and 1.5. Different Lys and Arg isotope forms were used to label the three samples in a triplex SILAC experiment: light (Lys0/Arg0) for WT control sample, medium (Lys4/Arg6) and heavy (Lys8/Arg10) for two different mutant samples. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and lysed in the presence of protease and phosphatase inhibitors. In SILAC experiments, samples were pooled at the harvest stage before protein extraction. Samples pooled at this early stage can reduce both systematic and random errors that may occur in later sample preparation [79, 80] , thus the results have smaller variance compared to unpooled samples. Small sample sizes (two or three replicates) is acceptable for the lowvariance SILAC experimental design. We observed in our SILAC experiments that the majority of the ratio ''variability'' in the data was less than 20. (The ''variability'' is reported by MaxQuant and is defined as the standard deviation of all log ratios used for obtaining the reported ratio value multiplied by 100 [30, 81] .) Protein levels were determined by the Bradford protein assay and the proteins from the triplex labeling were then pooled, and were digested by trypsin. The digest was separated into fractions using strong cation-exchange (SCX) fractionation, followed by selective enrichment of phosphorylated peptides using titanium dioxide [82, 83] and then analyzed by LC-MS/MS using a Thermo Fisher Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer. Peptides were identified using MaxQuant software [30] following the Mascot search engine [29] , and filtered requiring peptide identification FDR,1%. For Mascot searches, enzyme specificity was set to trypsin. Carbamidomethyl cysteine was set as a fixed modification. N-terminal carbamyl, oxidized methionine, as well as phosphorylation of serine, threonine, and tyrosine were set as variable modifications. Some missed cleavage was observed and could potentially contribute to the variance. The method for calculating peptide identification FDR based on concatenated databases was described by Cox J and Mann M [30] . A total of 3,312 phosphopeptides representing 1,063 proteins were identified. Among those, 73 unique phosphopeptides representing 66 common proteins were commonly identified in all the 8 kinasedead mutants; while, 882 phosphopeptides representing 486 proteins were common to at least half of the kinase-dead mutants.",

The genes PBI2, PDR12, RCN2, and NTH1 were deleted in a haploid strain of the filamentous g1278b genetic background by targeted replacement with the G418-encoding kanMX6 cassette. The resulting strains were grown 3-4 days under normal growth conditions, and invasive growth was assayed in these strains and in a wildtype strain according to standard protocols using a plate-washing assay. Deletion of PBI2 resulted in decreased invasive growth upon plate washing, and strains deleted for PDR12, RCN2, and NTH1 yielded hyperactive invasive growth. The increased invasive growth in these strains was most clearly evident in patched cultures as shown. doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003077.g007",
