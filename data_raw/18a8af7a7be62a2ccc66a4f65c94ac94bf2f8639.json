With the wide use of glucocorticoids for the treatment of rheumatic, autoimmune, and hematopoietic-system diseases, steroid-induced ONFH has become the most common type of clinical nontraumatic ONFH. ONFH occurs in 39% of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome within a few months of treatment with glucocorticoid therapy. [1] Once the ONFH occurs, it seriously reduces the patients' quality of life and is difficult to reverse. At present, there are several hypotheses about the causes of steroid-induced ONFH, including a hypercoagulable state, [2] intraosseous pressure changes, [3] fat embolism, [4] bone-cell apoptosis, [5, 6] and circulatory impairment, [7] but the exact pathogenesis is still unknown. Recently, associated studies revealed genetic polymorphisms of enzymes contributing to individual differences in steroid metabolism, steroid receptors, and transport proteins in patients with steroid-induced ONFH. [8, 9] All of these results suggest that genetic factors might play an important role in the development of steroid-induced ONFH.",

            "text": "Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), a family of zinc-dependent proteolytic enzymes, are expressed by stromal cells, infiltrating inflammatory cells, cancer cells, and osteoclasts. MMPs play central roles in morphogenesis, wound healing, tissue repair, and remodeling in response to injury. [10] Tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), a family of natural inhibitors of both MMPs and pro-MMPs, inhibit the activities of MMPs by creating crystal structures in TIMP-MMP complexes. [11, 12] Previous studies [13] [14] [15] reported that genetic variations of the MMP/TIMP system could cause the abnormal activation of osteoclasts, which might result in further ONFH. MMP-1 and MMP-3 are the key enzymes of collagen formation on the bone surface, which can promote the reabsorption of bone, leading to bone repair. [16] [17] [18] MMP-2, -9, and -13 might act on osteoblast and osteoclast behavior and development in bone growth. [19] MMP-1, -2, -7, and -9 are involved in the development of metastatic prostate cancer in bone. [20] TIMP-1 and -2 can stimulate the bone-resorbing activity of osteoclasts by inhibiting the responsible MMPs, such as MMP-2 and -9, or the activation of the MAPK pathway. [21] MMP-8 was expressed intensely in the process of osteoblast development into osteocytes. [22] Recently, numerous studies have reported associations between genes and steroid-induced ONFH. However, there is little insight into the association between gene polymorphisms in the MMP/TIMP system and steroid-induced ONFH. In the present study, we selected 34 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of 7 genes from the MMP/TIMP system that have been previously reported to be associated with the risk of steroid-induced ONFH or of diseases with pathogenesis similar to that of steroid-induced ONFH. Our study aims to determine the relationship between genetic polymorphisms of the TIMP/MMP system and the risk of steroid-induced ONFH as well as to explore the interaction between the TIMP/MMP system and gender factors for the risk of steroid-induced ONFH.",

Associations between the genotype polymorphisms and the risk of steroidinduced ONFH were evaluated under different genetic models (codominant, dominant, recessive, overdominant, and logadditive). Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using unconditional logistic regression analysis with an adjustment for gender and age. Then, we further analyzed the association between genotype and the risk of steroid-induced ONFH using each of the genetic models stratified by sex, and we tested the P values using Wald test.

We demonstrated that MMP8 genetic polymorphisms (rs3740938, rs2012390, rs1940475, and rs11225395) are associated with an increased risk of steroidinduced ONFH in the population of northern China. We found that gender differences might interact with MMP8 polymorphisms to affect the development of steroid-induced ONFH. We also found that the \"AGTCA\" haplotype of MMP8 was associated with a 1.40-fold increased risk of steroid-induced ONFH. MMP-8, also known as collagenase-2 or neutrophil collagenase, can be expressed by a wide variety of cells such as maturing neutrophils, peripheral neutrophils, endothelial cells, and chondrocytes. MMP-8 plays an important role in a wide range of inflammatory disorders. [27] MMP-8 initiates the first step of collagen degradation by disrupting triple helical fibrillar collagen. [28] Billinghurst et al [29] suggested that increased expression of MMP-8 would have an effect on the cleavage of type II collagen in human cartilage of osteoarthritis (OA). MMP-8 also possesses proteolytic activity on several matrix proteins, particularly some nonmatrix proteins such as angiotensin I. Fang et al [30] reported that MMP-8 can cleave angiotensin I and convert it to angiotensin II, which in turn induces the endothelial cell expression of platelet or endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 to promote angiogenesis. Hence, we suppose that polymorphisms of MMP-8 might have an effect on the inflammatory response or the circulatory impairment of the femoral head, leading further to steroid-induced ONFH.",

It is possible that rs1940475 has an effect on proMMP-8 activation by a glutamate-to-lysine substitution at amino acid residue 87 located in the propeptide of MMP-8. [31] The rs11225395 polymorphism has been shown by functional analysis to have an effect on MMP-8 promoter activity. [31] The rs1940475 and rs11225395 polymorphisms have been reported to have an association with atherosclerosis. Ye [32] conjectured that those SNPs might represent the same genetic signal, which arises from both the influence of rs11225395, located in the promoter region (position-799), on MMP-8 expression and the effect of rs1940475, located in the coding region (Glu87Lys), on MMP-8 zymogen activation, because the 2 SNPs were in strong linkage disequilibrium in Chinese and Japanese populations. In our study, rs1940475 and rs11225395 were found to have a significantly increased association with the risk of steroidinduced ONFH in both the allele model and the genetic models. We suppose that the rs1940475 and rs11225395 polymorphisms of MMP8 might have a negative effect on the circulatory impairment of the femoral head as previous studies suggested that rs1940475 and rs11225395 have a functional role in MMP8 expression. [33] [34] [35] Previously, a GWAS study conducted in Spain investigated the associations between rs3740938, rs2012390, and rs1940475 and OA, and rs1940475 showed a suggestive association with knee OA. [36] In our study, rs3740938 and rs2012390 were associated with a significantly increased risk of steroid-induced ONFH under the genetic models. In addition, further stratification analysis showed that the associations between rs3740938 and rs2012390 and the risk of steroidinduced ONFH were significantly stronger in females than in males, which provides the first evidence of interactive effects between rs3740938 and rs2012390 and gender on the risk of steroid-induced ONFH.",
