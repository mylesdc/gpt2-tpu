The nsp2 PRF signal of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus is distinctive in directing both \u22122 and \u22121 PRF and in its requirement for a trans-acting protein factor, the viral replicase subunit nsp1\u2424. Here we show that the the trans-activation of frameshifting is carried out by a protein complex composed of nsp1\u2424 and a cellular poly(C) binding protein (PCBP). From the results of in vitro translation and electrophoretic mobility shift assays, we demonstrate that a PCBP/nsp1\u2424 complex binds to a C-rich sequence downstream of the slippery sequence and here mimics the activity of a structured mRNA stimulator of PRF. This is the first description of a role for a trans-acting cellular protein in PRF. The discovery broadens the repertoire of activities associated with poly(C) binding proteins and prototypes a new class of virus-host interactions.",

How these RNA structures act is incompletely understood, but accumulating evidence supports the view that by presenting an unusual topology (1, 2, (8) (9) (10) (11) they confound an intrinsic unwinding activity of the ribosome with consequent effects on the elongation cycle and frame maintenance (12) (13) (14) . Indeed, kinetic analyses in bacterial systems indicate that stimulatory RNAs can impair movements of the ribosomal small subunit (30S) head, delaying dissociation of EF-G and the release of tRNA from the ribosome (15) (16) (17) .",

            "text": "Recently, we identified a novel, highly efficient \u22122/\u22121 PRF event that functions without a recognizable stimulatory RNA secondary structure (18, 19) . This signal operates during translation of the genome of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), a member of the family Arteriviridae in the order Nidovirales (20) . The PRRSV genome (Figure 1 ), a positive-sense RNA molecule some 15 kb in length, harbours two PRF signals. A 'canonical' \u22121 PRF element, including a stimulatory RNA pseudo- The \u223c15-kb PRRSV genome has two long 5 ORFs, 1a and 1b encoding non-structural polyproteins (nsps) and at least eight shorter 3 ORFs (2a-7) encoding structural proteins. ORF1a and ORF1b are translated from the genomic RNA, with translation of ORF1b depending on \u22121 PRF at the end of ORF1a. The TF ORF overlaps the central ORF1a region in the \u22122 reading frame and is accessed via \u22122 PRF (18) . A \u22121 frameshift at the same site generates the nsp2N product. Shown below is the sequence of the SD01-08 RNA in the region of the \u22122/\u22121 PRF signal, with the slippery sequence (purple) and C-rich motif (red) highlighted. The \u22121 reading frame stop codon is underlined and codons for each of the reading frames are indicated. (B) Crystal structure of the PRRSV nsp1\u2424 dimer (32) . The putative RNA binding domain is in orange (see text). (C) RNAs derived from FspI-cut pDluc PRRSV/wt, or a variant with the \u22121 frame stop codon (panel A) changed to UUA (PRRSV/stop), were translated in RRL in the presence of the indicated concentrations of His-tagged nsp1\u2424 (M) or with nsp1\u2424 dilution buffer (DB). The products were resolved by 12% sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and visualized by autoradiography. 14 C molecular size markers were also run on the gel (M). Products generated by ribosomes that do not frameshift (stop) or that enter the \u22121 or \u22122 frames are indicated. The asterisk indicates the \u22121 PRF product of the PRRSV/wt construct. (D) In vitro translation of pDluc PRRSV/wt mRNA in the presence of 1 M GST-nsp1\u2424 or mutant derivatives (PR, RBM; see text). Control translations were supplemented with an equivalent concentration of expressed GST or DB alone. Translation products were analysed and quantified as above (C). knot structure, is located at the junction of the overlapping replicase-encoding ORFs 1a and 1b and facilitates expression of an ORF1a-ORF1b fusion product. The second signal, which stimulates both \u22122 PRF and \u22121 PRF, is located within the region of ORF1a that encodes a large, multifunctional replicase subunit, non-structural protein 2 (nsp2). Here, about 20% of ribosomes translating nsp2 frameshift into the \u22122 reading frame to generate a transframe fusion protein (nsp2TF) comprising the N-terminal two-thirds of nsp2 and a C-terminus derived from a conserved, overlap-ping ORF (transframe; TF) in the \u22122 reading frame. A further 7% of ribosomes shift into the \u22121 reading frame where they immediately encounter a stop codon resulting in the synthesis of a truncated version of nsp2 termed nsp2N (19) . As shown in Figure 1A , the RNA downstream of the slippery sequence (GG GUU UUU) used for \u22122/\u22121 PRF in PRRSV does not harbour an obvious secondary structure compatible with canonical RNA-structure-stimulated PRF. However, mutations within a conserved CCCANCUCC motif located 11 nt downstream of the shift site reduce or Nucleic Acids Research, 2016, Vol. 44, No. 12 5493 inhibit frameshifting, consistent with the presence of a 3 stimulatory element of some form (18) . A further novelty of the PRRSV \u22122/\u22121 PRF signal is an essential role for the 25-kDa viral replicase subunit nsp1\u2424, which functions as a trans-activator of both \u22122 and \u22121 PRF ( Figure 1B) (19) . Nsp1\u2424 is one of the 14 subunits produced from the PRRSV replicase polyproteins. How it acts in PRF is unclear but replacement of basic residues within a highly conserved putative RNA-binding motif located in the papain-like autoproteinase (PLP) domain of nsp1\u2424 have a detrimental effect on frameshifting (19) .",

In mammalian cells, two PCBP subsets have been described, hnRNPs K/J (21) and the \u2423CP proteins \u2423CP1 and \u2423CP2, often referred to as PCBP1 and PCBP2 (22, 23) . The latter group also includes the more recently described paralogues PCBP3 and PCBP4 (24) . PCBPs are members of the KH domain superfamily of nucleic acid binding proteins and have a wide spectrum of biological activities, including the regulation of RNA splicing, the stabilization of cellular and viral mRNAs, transcriptional activation and inhibition, and translational silencing and enhancement (reviewed in Refs. 25, 26) . Using in vitro translation and RNA binding assays, we demonstrate that a complex of nsp1\u2424 and PCBP binds to the RNA downstream of the slippery sequence and mimics the action of the more typical RNA pseudoknot stimulators of programmed frameshifting. This unprecedented frameshift-stimulatory signal provides new insights as to how the ribosomal elongation cycle can be modified by trans-acting protein factors. Further, it broadens the repertoire of activities associated with poly(C) binding proteins and prototypes a new class of virus-host interactions.",

The second protein migrated more rapidly than that of Rluc and we surmised that this protein corresponded to the product of a \u22121 PRF, as a \u22121 frame stop codon is present immediately downstream of the slippery sequence (underlined in Figure 1A ). To confirm this, the \u22121 frame stop codon (UGA) was changed to UUA, which extends the \u22121 reading frame by 56 codons and simultaneously introduces a 0-frame stop codon UAA thus shortening the Rluc gene. As expected, this point mutation increased the size of the predicted \u22121 PRF product, and slightly reduced the size of the Rluc protein (stop). These experiments indicate that the 79-nt region cloned into pDluc likely contains all of the cis-acting elements required for PRRSV \u22122/\u22121 frameshifting and that supplementation of the RRL translations with nsp1\u2424 alone is sufficient to transactivate frameshifting to levels similar to those seen in infected cells (\u22122 PRF, 17%; \u22121 PRF, 7%; see Supplementary Table) . The stimulation of PRF by nsp1\u2424 was specific to the PRRSV signal in that the protein had no effect on frameshifting at a variety of well-established sites of viral \u22121 PRF (Supplementary Figure S1) . Furthermore, the protein was unable to promote stop codon readthrough at variants of the PRRSV signal with an in-frame stop codon placed within the slippery sequence at the position that would be decoded in the peptidyl-(P) or aminoacyl-(A) site of the ribosome (Supplementary Figure S1) .",

Within the latter domain, we previously identified a conserved motif 123 GKYLQRRLQ 131 (19) as a potential RNA binding motif (RBM) that forms one of three \u2423 helices in the region between the catalytic residues of PLP1\u2424 (C 96 and H 165 ; Ref. 19 ).

RNAs transcribed from these plasmids were translated in RRL in the presence of nsp1\u2424 ( Figure  2A ). PRF was found to be unaffected until the length of the PRRSV sequence downstream of the slippery sequence fell below 21 nt, at which point PRF was reduced (18 nt) or abolished (15 or 9 nt). In the latter constructs, the C-rich region is compromised, consistent with an important role in PRF. Similar results were previously observed in transfected cultured cells (Li et al., (19) ). To investigate the function of the C-rich region specifically, we prepared a library of individual point mutations within, and flanking, the Crich region and assessed their effect on PRF ( Figure 2B ). It was found that changing any of the C residues to G had a detrimental effect on PRF, with the exception of the final residue (C 13 , 3 of the conserved sequence), where the effect was more modest. As an explanation for these observations, we speculated that the RNA downstream of the slippery sequence may interact with PCBPs. The 'minimal' region of PRRSV RNA required for full activity in PRF (21 nt) has only two C-rich patches, whereas previously established PCBP-binding consensus sequences more commonly have three (or more) C-triplets, potentially with each triplet binding one KH domain ((33); see below). However, PCBP1 and PCBP2 are amongst several candidates reported to associate with GST-tagged nsp1\u2424 in association screens, and a direct physical interaction between the two has been shown (34, 35) . PCBPs could therefore bind to the PRRSV mRNA by virtue of an association with nsp1\u2424.",

We found that PCBP2 alone did not affect PRF (right hand lane), but when added together with nsp1\u2424, synthesis of the \u22121 PRF product was stimulated some 3-fold (see Supplementary Table) . We reasoned that if the 'active' trans-acting stimulator of PRF in PRRSV is a complex of nsp1\u2424 and PCBP, the RRL system may already contain an abundant form of PCBP, but one which would, in complex with nsp1\u2424, preferentially induce \u22122 PRF. In this experiment, supplementation with PCBP2 may have generated nsp1\u2424-PCBP2 complexes that could preferentially promote \u22121 PRF. We therefore translated the PRRSV frameshift reporter mRNA in the WG in vitro translation system on the basis that this lysate might contain fewer endogenous PCBPs, or PCBPs of sufficient evolutionary divergence to preclude any interactions with nsp1\u2424. Consistent with our hypothesis, PRF at the PRRSV signal in WG was found to be completely dependent upon the addition of both nsp1\u2424 and PCBP2, with neither protein alone having any frameshift-stimulatory activity in this system ( Figure 3B ). Further, supplementation of WG translations with PCBP2 led preferentially to a \u22121 PRF, whereas with human PCPB1, \u22122 PRF was most evident (Figure 3C) , suggesting that the abundant form in RRL is PCBP1. We also tested mouse PCBP3, human PCBP4 and mouse hn-RNP K/J in WG translations ( Figure 3C and D) . Of these three proteins, only PCBP3 was able to promote frameshifting, with both \u22122 and \u22121 PRF products observed at similar levels ( Figure 3C ). We confirmed the involvement of PCBP1 and 2 in frameshifting in cultured cells using siRNAs (Supplementary Figure S2 ). Knockdown of PCBPs individually or together substantially reduced PRF, with PCBP1 noticeably affecting \u22122 PRF, and PCBP2, \u22121 PRF, consistent with the results of the WG assays above. No effect on PRF was seen with siRNAs targeting PCBP3, PCBP4 or hnRNP K/J, although we could not verify knockdown of PCBP3 due to lack of a reactive antibody.",

A short (58 nt) 32 P-labelled transcript encompassing the minimal PRRSV frameshiftstimulatory region was incubated with nsp1\u2424, PCBP1 (or PCBP2) or both proteins, prior to electrophoresis on a 4% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel. As shown in Figure 4A , a single RNA-protein complex was observed, the formation of which required both nsp1\u2424 and PCBP1 (or PCBP2). Using a broader range of PCBP2 concentrations at saturating levels of nsp1\u2424, the estimated K d of the interaction was found to be 130 nM (Supplementary Figure S3) . In the presence of PCBP2, the PR mutant of nsp1\u2424 was able to bind the target RNA indistinguishably from the WT protein, but the RBM mutant gave a smeary pattern, indicative of weak, non-specific, RNA binding (Supplementary Figure S3) . As a control, a version of the RNA probe mutated in the C-rich region (CC2, Ref. 18) was also tested, and no nsp1\u2424/PCBP2 binding was evident (Supplementary Figure S3) . A supershift assay was carried out to confirm nsp1\u2424 and PCBP association with the RNA in the complex. The PRRSV RNA was incubated with nsp1\u2424 and PCBP2 and subsequently with specific antibodies targeting either protein prior to EMSA. As shown in Figure 4B , in lanes from reactions with an added anti-PCBP2 monoclonal antibody, an additional band of slower mobility was seen consistent with the presence of PCBP2 in the RNA/protein complex. A monoclonal antibody targeting the NTD of nsp1\u2424 did not yield a novel EMSA product, but a more slowly migrating species was observable with a polyclonal anti-nsp1\u2424 serum. These observations support the view that the RNA/protein complex seen contains both proteins.",

To test the involvement of individual KH domains in PRF, amino acid substitutions (to GDDG) were introduced within the conserved, hallmark GxxG loop in each domain, which forms part of the RNA binding domain. These mutations have been shown previously to abolish RNA bind- ing activity of the individual domain without compromising its stability (37) . As shown in Figure 5A and B, mutation of the KH2 domain of PCBP1 or PCBP2 had little, if any, effect on frameshifting, whereas the KH3 domain mutation essentially abolished trans-activation. The KH1 domain mutation had a more varied phenotype. With PCBP1, frameshift-stimulation was greatly reduced, but for PCBP2, \u22122 PRF was diminished four-fold, but full activity in \u22121 PRF was retained. Further, whilst addition of PCBP1 KH1m or PCBP1 KH3m alone was unable to stimulate PRF, when (A) EMSA analysis of binding of nsp1\u2424, PCBP1 or PCBP2 (alone or in combination) to a short (58 nt) 32 P-labelled in vitro transcript containing the PRRSV PRF signal. After incubation at 30 \u2022 C for 10 min, reactions were loaded onto a 4% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel and, following electrophoresis, the gel was fixed, dried and subjected to autoradiography. Numbers below lanes show fold molar excess of protein(s) with respect to the radiolabelled RNA (10 nM). In lanes BSB, DB and W, RNA was incubated alone with band-shift buffer, protein dilution buffer or water, respectively (see 'Materials and Methods' section). (B) The composition of RNA-protein complexes was investigated by supershift assay. Complexes were prepared with 10 nM RNA and a 50-fold molar excess of nsp1\u2424 (N) and PCBP2 (P2) and subjected to EMSA directly (N, P2, NP2), or after incubation with monoclonal (mono) or polyclonal (poly) antisera raised against PCBP2 (\u2423P2, mono) or nsp1\u2424 (\u2423N, mono or poly). As controls, the radiolabelled RNA probe was incubated with either DB, the \u2423P2 mono or the \u2423N poly. added together, a partial restoration of both \u22122 and \u22121 PRF (to about 20% of the WT value) was observed (Figure 5C ). Note that in all assays, frameshift-stimulation remained dependent upon addition of nsp1\u2424 ( Figure 5D ).",

However, the KH1 and KH3 mutations likely modify the interaction of the protein with RNA, and conceivably, with nsp1\u2424. EMSA analysis confirmed the predicted effects on RNA binding, which was reduced in the case of PCBP2 KH1m , abolished with PCBP2 KH3m and largely unaffected for PCBP2 KH2 (Figure 5E ). Similar results were seen with PCBP1 (Supplementary Figure S5 ). To assess the capacity of the various PCBPs to bind nsp1\u2424 independently of RNA, a pull-down assay was utilized (Supplementary Figure S6) . Here, immobilized GST-nsp1\u2424 was incubated with individual His- tagged PCBPs and, after a detergent wash, bound protein was eluted for analysis by immunoblotting. In comparison to WT PCBP2, the binding of PCBP2 bearing any of the three KH domain mutations to GST-tagged nsp1\u2424 was unaffected, indicating that the effects on PRF are related to changes in RNA binding rather than a reduced capacity to associate with nsp1\u2424. Indeed, PCBPs 1-4 all bound nsp1\u2424 in this assay, thus the inability of PCBP4 to trans-activate PRF at the PRRSV signal has some other explanation. Importantly, GST-tagged nsp1\u2424 RBM was able to pull-down PCBP2, indicating that the defect in this mutant is not in the capacity to associate with its protein partner.",

A hallmark of RNA structure-dependent PRF signals is the necessity to maintain a precise spacing between slippery sequence and stimulatory RNA to position the ribosome appropriately at the slip-site (38, 39) . The importance of spacing in PRRSV frameshifting was assessed in WG translations programmed with reporter mRNAs with spacer lengths of 4-13 nt ( Figure 6 ). Efficient PRF was seen over a narrow range (9-11 nt), with shorter spacers leading preferentially to \u22122 PRF and longer spacers preferentially to \u22121 PRF. This pattern of frameshifting is highly reminiscent of that observed with stimulatory RNAs and suggests that the nsp1\u2424/PCBP complex functionally mimics such RNAs. The optimal spacer length was subtly different for the two PCBPs, with maximal PRF (\u22122 and \u22121) seen at longer spacer lengths for added PCBP1 compared with PCBP2. Thus the capacity of the various PCPBs to promote frameshifting into a particular reading frame is likely set by the position and/or conformation of the protein complex on the template, affected by subtle differences in the position of KH domains within the proteins which influences 'effective' spacer length.",

We tested whether the nsp1\u2424/PCBP2 complex could also induce pausing by cloning the PRRSV signal (with a defective slippery sequence) in-frame within a reporter gene and translating in vitro derived mRNAs in the WG system. The extent of pausing was estimated by comparing the levels of a translational intermediate corresponding to pausing at a bound nsp1\u2424/PCBP2 complex with that of the full-length polypeptide produced during a time course in which translation was synchronized by the addition of edeine, a potent inhibitor of initiation, 5 min after the start of the reaction. A control mRNA was prepared from plasmid template linearized at the position of the inserted PRRSV signal to serve as a pause marker. As can be seen in Figure 7 , pausing was clearly evident in the presence of nsp1\u2424/PCBP2, but far less so with either protein alone, or on an mRNA lacking the C-rich region. The appearance of the pause product was transient (albeit visible over several minutes), consistent with its identity as a genuine intermediate rather than a dead-end product. In Figure 7C , further pausing assays were carried out to examine the activity of the PCBP2 KH domain mutants (in the presence of nsp1\u2424). We found a positive correlation between the extent of pausing observed and the activity of the three mutants in specific RNA binding, namely a little for PCBP2 KH1m , close to WT levels for PCBP2 KH2m and much less pausing for PCBP2 KH3m .",

At the PRRSV signal, the bound nsp1\u2424-PCBP complex would also be in close proximity to a ribosome actively decoding the slippery sequence, facilitating interactions between them. In this light, it may be significant that in pull down assays, nsp1\u2424 has been shown to interact with rpS14 (34), a protein immediately adjacent to a component (rpS3) of the putative ribosome-associated mRNA unwinding activity (13) and PCBP1 is known to interact with RACK1 (41), a ribosome-associated protein located close to the mRNA entry channel.

Nsp1\u2424 exists as a dimer in solution (32) , PCBPs have been shown to be capable of homo-and heteromultimerization and RNA binding by PCBPs could reflect interaction with single or multiple KH domains (42) (43) (44) . Binding assays with optimized RNA targets generated by in vitro SELEX have revealed that a tandem array of three C-patches maximizes PCBP2 binding to its RNA target (45) and several established PCBP binding sites contain three or more C-patches (33, 46) . However, the sequence motifs implicated in PCBP binding from gene expression analysis of human cells (47, 48) and Caenorhabditis elegans (49) comprise predominantly two adjacent C-rich patches, although it is not known how strongly PCBPs bind to these targets, nor whether any other cellular proteins participate in the interactions. The EMSA data presented here reveal that alone, PCBP1 and PCBP2 bind weakly to the PRRSV C-rich region (which has two C-patches), requiring nsp1\u2424 for stable binding. Similarly, nsp1\u2424 binds RNA very weakly, but is evident in complexes (with PCBPs) from supershift assays. Stable complex formation on the mRNA thus likely depends upon conformational changes in one or both molecular partners and potentially, direct contact between nsp1\u2424 and mRNA. In support of the latter, we found that amino acid substitutions in the putative RBM) of nsp1\u2424 greatly weakened the association of the complex with RNA, without apparent effect on the interaction with PCBP2. Yeast two-hybrid studies (35) have shown that the reciprocal interaction of nsp1\u2424 and PCBP2 requires the C-terminus of nsp1\u2424, including the protease domain (PLP1\u2424) and Cterminal extension, and the KH2 domain of PCBP2. In light of this, we hypothesize that the association of nsp1\u2424 with KH2 would not preclude binding of nsp1\u2424 to RNA. An alternative interpretation is that nsp1\u2424 RBM fails to induce a conformational change in PCBPs necessary for stable RNA association.",

The KH2 domain itself is not associated with the RNA, serving rather to bind nsp1\u2424, with the complex poised to subvert the elongating ribosome. In its capacity to stall ribosomes, the nsp1\u2424-PCBP complex joins a growing list proteins that have been shown to modulate the elongation step of protein synthesis. These include Stm1 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which inhibits translation after 80S formation (50) , the fragile X mental retardation protein, which reversibly stalls ribosomes on its target mRNAs (51) by binding directly to the ribosome (52), the HIF-1\u2423 mRNA-associated cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding protein 2, which binds eEF2 and slows elongation (53) and the PUF-Ago-eEF1A complex that attenuates elongation after the nascent peptide emerges from the ribosomal exit tunnel (54) . Stalling of ribosomes by the nsp1\u2424-PCBP complex, perhaps as a consequence of a direct interaction with the unwinding centre of the small subunit, could promote PRF in a manner similar to that described for structured RNA stimulators.",

            "text": "Not all PCBPs were capable of stimulating PRF. The lack of activity of PCBP4 and hnRNP K/J is potentially a consequence of differences in overall size and domain organization. PCBP1, 2 and 3 are globally similar, with KH domains located at analogous positions in the protein, whereas the linker separating KH2 and KH3 is shorter in PCBP4 and much longer in hnRNP K/J ( Figure 3D ). These differences did not affect association of PCPB4 with nsp1\u2424, but could affect the strength of binding of individual KH domains to RNA or alternatively, preclude generation of a correctly oriented or positioned complex on the mRNA. With the KH domain mutants of PCBP1 and PCBP2, we largely observed an excellent correlation between activity in RNA binding, ribosomal pausing and the capacity to induce PRF. However, we saw differential activity in PRF of the KH1 domain mutants of PCBP1 and PCBP2, with the former barely active yet the latter retaining function in promoting \u22121 PRF, but with reduced \u22122 PRF. When RNA association was examined by EMSA, PCBP1 KH1m and PCBP2 KH1m bound to the PRRSV RNA with similar affinity and in an nsp1\u2424-dependent manner, although binding was noticeably reduced in comparison to the WT proteins. This suggests that PCBP1 KH1m and PCBP2 KH1m still associate with the RNA, but the stability, conformation or position of the complex may be changed such that only in the case of PCBP2 KH1m is PRF possible, and only \u22121 PRF (which is the predominant frameshift event for WT PCBP2 at the natural spacing distance). As noted in the 'Results' section, compensatory activity in PRF was detected upon mixing the individually inactive PCBP1 KH1m and PCBP1 KH3m , suggesting that two (or more) PCBPs can cooperate to stimulate frameshifting. The differential activity of PCBP1 KH1m and PCBP2 KH1m could reflect an altered capacity to homo-oligomerize.",

Here, lowfrequency stop codon readthrough at the end of the proangiogenic VEGFA coding sequence appends an additional 22 amino acids to the C-terminus, generating the VEGF-Ax isoform which possesses anti-angiogenic activity. The readthrough event is promoted by the binding of hnRNP A2/B1 to a recognition element 10 nt downstream of the recoded VEGFA stop codon. Similar to PCBPs, hnRNP A2/B1 is known to associate with nascent cellular RNAs and influence their localization, maturation and function (56) . How it acts to stimulate readthrough is unknown, but it is striking that both hnRNP A2/B1 and the nsp1\u2424/PCBP complex promote their respective recoding events from a similar distance 3 of the ribosome, suggesting that they may contact the ribosome directly. How they subvert translation likely differs in each case as we were unable to uncover any stop codon readthrough activity of the nsp1\u2424/PCBP2 complex (Supplementary Figure S1) .",

In the best characterized system, poliovirus, the capacity of PCBPs to associate at two discrete genomic RNA locations and in concert with different protein partners is critical to almost all aspects of the virus replication cycle (reviewed in Ref. 57 ). Whether such complex regulatory circuits operate during PRRSV replication and transcription remains to be determined. PCBP2 has been shown to associate with the 5 untranslated region of the PRRSV genome and may be involved in genome replication or translation initiation (34, 35) . Furthermore, the relative abundance and location of PCBPs in the cytoplasm of infected cells could be important in determining the precise ratio of non-frameshifted (full-length nsp2) and trans-frame (nsp2TF, nsp2N) products at various stages of the replication cycle.",
