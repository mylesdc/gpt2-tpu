The aim of this study was to evaluate the immunomodulatory effect after IRE and to evaluate the prognostic value of variations of the immune parameters in LAPC patients after IRE. Methods. Peripheral blood samples of 34 patients were obtained preoperatively and on the third day (D3) and seventh day (D7) after IRE, respectively. The phenotypes of lymphocytes were analyzed by flow cytometry, and dynamic changes of serum levels of cytokines, complement, and immunoglobulin were assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and concordance index (C-index) were used to compare the survival predictive ability. Results. There was a transitory decrease followed by a steady increase for CD4 + T cell, CD8 + T cell, NK cell, IL-2, C3, C4, and IgG while a reverse trend was detected for Treg cell, IL-6, and IL10 after IRE. The alteration of CD8 + T cell between D3 and D7 was identified as a prognostic factor for both overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). The values of ROC curve (AUC) and C-indexes of the alteration of CD8 + T cell for OS and PFS were 0.816 and 0.773 and 0.816 and 0.639, respectively, which were larger than those of other immune or inflammation-based indexes. Conclusions. This study presented the first evidence of IRE-based immunomodulatory in patients with LAPC. The alteration of CD8 + T cell between D3 and D7 showed relatively good performance and could be used as an effective tool for prognostic evaluation for LAPC patients after IRE.",

            "text": "Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is a lethal disease with extremely poor prognosis, which also represented the seventh and sixth leading causes of cancer-related death in the world and in China, respectively. The 5-year survival rate is only 5% [1, 2] . Surgical resection is the only chance to obtain curative treatment while it is only suitable for less than 20% of patients with this disease [3] . Approximately 40% of new cases are diagnosed with locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC), which is characterized by the involvement of major vascular structures, such as celiac trunk, superior mesenteric artery, leading to unresectable but nonmetastatic diseases [4] . Currently, the treatment for LAPC remains a huge challenge due to the poor prognoses of this disease. Limited responses and little impact on survival or life were achieved after the standard treatments, which was mainly systemic chemotherapy [5, 6] . Moreover, the high rates of adverse events due to the toxicity of chemotherapy limited the use and promotion of treatment, such as the combination chemotherapy of 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin (FOLFIRINOX), even though it was shown to display some progression in improving the survival of patients with LAPC [7] [8] [9] . Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate new treatment to optimize common therapeutic approaches. Nowadays, local therapies were shown to improve the prognosis of LAPC patients with varying degrees of success [10] . 2 Journal of Oncology Irreversible electroporation (IRE), a nonthermal ablation technique, is established as a local ablative therapy for patients with LAPC with promising outcomes of increasing overall survival (OS) from 12 months to 25 months [11] . It is a novel local destructive method based on the transmission of high voltage currents through the tumor via needles, leading to cell membrane defects and apoptotic death [12, 13] . Additionally, during the induction process of apoptotic death by IRE, the structure and composition of the tumor microenvironment are changed, inducing an intense inflammatory cell response, which is characterized by the infiltration of immune cells [14] . It was shown that this IRE-induced immunomodulatory was not only limited to the ablated areas, but also a systemic reaction [15] . Thus, IRE could be regarded as a potential immunomodulatory treatment and might induce extensive changes of immune cells or indexes after ablation.",

For this novel and powerful treatment of LAPC, further prognostic markers are urgently needed to choose patients with relatively better prognosis. Moreover, early information of the efficacy of treatment during the first days after IRE would be highly appreciated as therapy may be intensified by other treatments, such as immune therapy, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy, while the regular evaluation of therapy by imaging is only done about 1 month after IRE treatment. For the candidates of predictive factors, circulating biochemical markers may be the promising ones, for their relationship with cancer disease, the immediate therapy effect, and the immunological response of the organism to treatment. More importantly, as failures were achieved for the immune-checkpoint therapies in pancreatic cancer due to the low rates of neoantigen expression and mutation events [16] , exploring the alterations and evaluating the prognostic effect of immune cells and indexes might open the prospect of using immune-checkpoint therapies in patients with LAPC.",

Consecutive patients who were newly diagnosed with LAPC at Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center between August 2015 and August 2017 were included in this study. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) pathologically confirmed pancreatic adenocarcinoma and radiologically confirmed LAPC. LAPC was defined per the seventh edition of the AJCC staging system for pancreatic cancer, which describes LAPC as arterial encasement of either the celiac axis or superior mesenteric artery or unreconstructable superior mesenteric or portal vein involvement, with no evidence of metastatic disease from abdominal and thoracic computed tomography [17, 18] ; (2) IRE therapy as the initial treatment. A total of 11 patients were excluded based on the following exclusion criteria: (1) other treatments, including surgical resection and RFA before IRE (seven patients); (2) existing metastatic implants before IRE (one patient); (3) heart arrhythmia and a history of second primary malignant tumors (one patient); (4) missing information of parameters or lost to follow-up (two patients). This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center. All procedures performed in present study involving human participants were in accordance with the ethical standards of institutional and/or national research committees and the 1964 Helsinki Declaration and its later amendments or similar ethical standards.

It was the first evidence for IRE-based immune modulation in LAPC patients. It was shown that there was a transitory decrease followed by a steady increase for CD4 + T cell, CD8 + T cell, NK cell, IL-2, C3, C4, and IgG while a reverse trend was observed 8 Journal of Oncology Table 1 Journal of Oncology 9 Table 3 10 Journal of Oncology Abbreviations as in Table 3 for Treg cell, IL-6, and IL10 after IRE. Other circulating cytokines, including TNF and IFN, were also evaluated. In terms of IFN, IFN-plays the most important role in its immunostimulatory and immunomodulatory effects, compared with the ability to inhibit viral replication directly, which is the main function of IFN- [23, 24] or IFN-\u00df [25] . Therefore, IFN-and TNF were analyzed while they both failed to show obvious alteration. In addition, the alteration of CD8 + T cell between D3 and D7 was identified as prognostic factor for OS and PFS and first showed both a convenient and effective prognostic value in patients with LAPC after IRE. When compared with the traditional inflammationbased scores, the alteration of CD8 + T cell exhibited a better predictive value for both OS and PFS. For LAPC patients after ablation therapy, several studies have revealed the changes of individual counts of T cell and subset ratios [26] [27] [28] . Alessandro G et al. compared the concentration of CD4 + and CD8 + T cell before and after radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and revealed an increase of above-mentioned T cells from the third day after treatment [26] . In the study conducted by Ketevan M et al., a more significant decrease in the expression of CD4 + CD39 + T cell was observed after RFA, compared with operation [27] . In animal study, IRE therapy, which induced an increase tumor infiltration of CD3 + cells, was reported to be more effective in immunocompetent tumor than in immunocompromised tumors [28] . Furthermore, Martin et al. reported that IRE induced an obvious decrease in the absolute number of Treg cell in patients with LAPC [29] . Similar to Martin's study, our study showed a transitory increase followed by a remarkable decrease for Treg cell, along with a steady increase of effective T cells and humoral immune parameters after IRE. As an inflammation-inducing treatment, IRE not only directly destroys tumor cells, but also results in a release of tumor-associated neoantigens, which may stimulate the cellular and humoral immune of the body. Then, the numbers of immunocytes and production of humoral immune parameters will increase due to the potentiation of cellular and humoral immune. Moreover, it was shown that heatshock proteins released from the destroyed tumor cells had an adjuvant effect and acted as an alarm for antitumor T cell-mediated immunity [30] . Therefore, IRE may be a mean of significant effort to overcome the immunosuppressive \"cold\" tumor microenvironment in LAPC and a potential treatment window of opportunity for immune-check-point therapy was suggested by increasing the effector T cells and decreasing immunosuppressive Treg cells. In addition, for these patients, prior biliary drainage procedure or a hepaticojejunostomy during open procedure was performed. Also, no serious complications, such as abdominal infection and pancreatic fistula, were observed in all patients after IRE therapy. Therefore, the influence of hyperbilirubinemia or infection after IRE on the alteration of immune cells was minimized. Although detained changes of immune cells had been described in patients with LAPC after IRE, the clinical performance of these changes in survival prediction was still unclear, thereby limiting their value.",

            "text": "In the next step of the present study, we evaluated the prognostic factors for OS and PFS and showed that elevation of CD8 + T cell was associated with favourable OS and PFS in LAPC patients after IRE. This can be explained by a stimulated host immune response which might limit the progression and invasion of tumor, and therefore, better survival was achieved. This can be proved by previous studies in which strong relationships were observed between immune toxicity and metastasis [31] . Metastases were more frequently observed in patients with lower density of immune effector cells [32] , which was in accordance with our results. Furthermore, the predictive power of the alteration of several immune cells and inflammation-based indexes were compared in this study. It was demonstrated that the alteration of CD8 + T cell was superior to other indexes. In addition, as a robust and economic method, the alteration of CD8 + T cell can be obtained from peripheral blood sample fast and easily and can be used widely in clinical practice. Although there was a correlation between immune cells and inflammationbased indexes [27] , the alteration of CD8+ T cell could still provide additional prognostic value in patients with the same levels of inflammation-associated situation. Maybe they can be considered as complements for predicting the prognosis of LAPC patients after IRE. However, a slightly lower value of AUC for CD8+ T cell in PFS prediction suggested that, compared with PFS, maybe OS was affected more greatly by the changes of immune system. Different from tumorinfiltrating CD8 + T cells, which were shown to play more important role in determine local progression, compared with prognosis [33, 34] . LAPC is a systemic disease other a local disease. In the present study, peripheral blood samples were collected before and after IRE treatment and were analyzed by flow cytometry for CD8 + T cells. Therefore, it was thought that the human immune system played a more important role in long-term survival than in local control. Similar to the present study, in the study conducted by Chen et al. [35] , it was shown that alteration of CD8 + T cells was the only independent prognostic factor for OS, other than PFS. This may partly explain the different impact on survival from the alteration of CD8 + T cells. However, this difference needed to be further explored by further studies.",
