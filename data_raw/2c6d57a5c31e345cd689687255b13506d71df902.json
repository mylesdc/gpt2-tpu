            "text": "The genus Sapovirus belongs to the family Caliciviridae, and its members are common causative agents of severe acute gastroenteritis in both humans and animals. Some caliciviruses are known to use either terminal sialic acids or histoblood group antigens as attachment factors and/or cell surface proteins, such as CD300lf, CD300ld, and junctional adhesion molecule 1 of tight junctions (TJs), as receptors. However, the roles of TJs and their proteins in sapovirus entry have not been examined. In this study, we found that porcine sapovirus (PSaV) significantly decreased transepithelial electrical resistance and increased paracellular permeability early in infection of LLC-PK cells, suggesting that PSaV dissociates TJs of cells. This led to the interaction between PSaV particles and occludin, which traveled in a complex into late endosomes via Rab5-and Rab7-dependent trafficking. Inhibition of occludin using small interfering RNA (siRNA), a specific antibody, or a dominantnegative mutant significantly blocked the entry of PSaV. Transient expression of occludin in nonpermissive Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells conferred susceptibility to PSaV, but only for a limited time. Although claudin-1, another TJ protein, neither directly interacted nor was internalized with PSaV particles, it facilitated PSaV entry and replication in the LLC-PK cells. We conclude that PSaV particles enter LLC-PK cells by binding to occludin as a coreceptor in PSaV-dissociated TJs. PSaV and occludin then form a complex that moves to late endosomes via Rab5-and Rab7dependent trafficking. In addition, claudin-1 in the TJs opened by PSaV infection facilitates PSaV entry and infection as an entry factor. IMPORTANCE Sapoviruses (SaVs) cause severe acute gastroenteritis in humans and animals. Although they replicate in intestinal epithelial cells, which are tightly sealed by apical-junctional complexes, such as tight junctions (TJs), the mechanisms by which SaVs hijack TJs and their proteins for successful entry and infection remain largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that porcine SaVs (PSaVs) induce early dissociation of TJs, allowing them to bind to the TJ protein occludin as a functional coreceptor. PSaVs then travel in a complex with occludin into late endosomes through Rab5-and Rab7-dependent trafficking. Claudin-1, another TJ protein, does not directly interact with PSaV but facilitates the entry of PSaV into cells as an entry factor. This work contributes to our understanding of the entry of SaV and other caliciviruses into cells and may aid in the development of efficient and affordable drugs to treat SaV infections.",

            "text": "junctional complexes comprising tight junctions (TJs), adherent junctions, and desmosomes (1) . TJs, found in epithelial and endothelial cells, are highly specialized intercellular adhesion complexes that contribute to the paracellular barrier (2) (3) (4) . Numerous studies have unearthed multiple integral membrane proteins located at TJs, including occludin, claudins, junctional adhesion molecules (JAMs), tricellulin, and coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR) proteins, as well as their membrane-associated scaffold proteins, such as zona occludens protein 1 (ZO-1), ZO-2, and ZO-3 (2) (3) (4) . Disruption of TJs results in a decrease in transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) and an increase in paracellular permeability (5) and is associated with various diseases, including cancers, inflammatory bowel disease, and vasogenic edema (2, 6, 7) . Although TJs prevent pathogens from crossing the epithelial barrier, they are often targeted by pathogenic viruses and bacteria, leading to infection and the development of disease (7) (8) (9) . Numerous viruses have developed different mechanisms to subvert host TJ barrier function for their own benefit, such as direct reorganization or degradation of specific TJ proteins, reorganization of the cell cytoskeleton, and activation of host cell signaling events (4, 7) . Moreover, some viruses have been found to hijack TJ proteins as receptors for entry and infection (4, 7, 8) . For example, rotavirus disrupts TJs and uses the TJ protein JAM-A as a coreceptor (5, 10) . The amino-terminal domain of JAM-A also serves as a receptor for prototype and field isolate strains of mammalian reovirus (11, 12) . Hepatitis C virus (HCV) interacts with the N-terminal third of extracellular loop 1 in claudin-1, using it as a coreceptor after binding and interaction with the coreceptor CD81 (13, 14) . Coxsackievirus and adenovirus use the coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor protein for their internalization (15, 16) . In addition, some viruses do not recognize TJ proteins as entry receptors but instead use them as entry factors to facilitate their entry and infection (10, 17, 18) .",

The family has five wellestablished genera: Norovirus, Sapovirus, Nebovirus, Lagovirus, and Vesivirus (19, 20) . Recently, six new genera, tentatively named Recovirus (21) , Valovirus (22) , Bavovirus (23, 24) , Nacovirus (24) (25) (26) , Salovirus (27) , and Sanovirus (28) , have been added as unclassified caliciviruses. The most notable genera in the family are Norovirus and Sapovirus, which cause severe acute gastroenteritis in humans and animals, with noroviruses alone causing \u03f3200,000 deaths per annum in children \u03fd5 years of age (29, 30) . Despite their socioeconomic impact, our understanding of the life cycles of these viruses and the development of effective interventions against them have been hampered by a lack of efficient cell culture systems, particularly for those caliciviruses that infect humans (31) (32) (33) . The Cowden strain of porcine sapovirus (PSaV) is the only strain in the genus Sapovirus that replicates in a porcine kidney cell line in the presence of porcine intestinal contents or bile acids, specifically, glycochenodeoxycholic acid (GCDCA) (33, 34) . Therefore, PSaV strain Cowden is an attractive model for the study of Sapovirus and Norovirus life cycles and for use in developing vaccine or therapeutic interventions against human and animal sapoviruses.",

However, little is known about the roles of TJ proteins in PSaV entry and infection. This prompted us to investigate the potential roles of TJs and their molecules in PSaV entry and infection. In the present study, we found that PSaV strain Cowden dissociates TJs, as indicated by decreased TER and increased paracellular permeability in the porcine kidney cell line LLC-PK. PSaV was observed to directly bind to occludin and then to become internalized as a complex into cells. In addition, these PSaV-occludin complexes were found to travel from early to late endosomes, mediated by small GTPases, Rab5 and Rab7. Our findings indicate that PSaV exploits occludin in epithelial cells to enter and initiate virus replication.",

Because PSaV induced dissociation of TJs very early in infection, we next examined whether PSaV infection affected the passage of two nonionic tracers (4-kDa and 70-kDa fluorescein isothiocyanate [FITC]-dextrans) in cells grown on transwell filters (Fig. 1B) . LLC-PK monolayers treated without any chemical (the mock-treated group) showed minimal diffusion of these tracers across the monolayers, confirming intact TJs (Fig. 1B) . As a positive control, treatment of LLC-PK cells with the calcium ion chelating agent EGTA, known to open TJs and generate epithelial depolarization (5, 49, 50) , induced a 25-fold increase in 4-kDa FITC-dextran paracellular diffusion and a 15-fold increase in 70-kDa FITC-dextran paracellular diffusion compared to mock-treated cells (Fig. 1B) . Incubation of PSaV in cell culture for 30 min without GCDCA supplementation produced a 22-fold increase in the diffusion of 4-kDa FITC-dextran and a 12-fold increase in the diffusion of 70-kDa FITC-dextran (Fig. 1B) . Inoculation of PSaV together with 200 M GCDCA increased diffusion by 24-and 14-fold for 4-kDa FITC-dextran and 70-kDa FITC-dextran, respectively (Fig. 1B ). In addition, treatment of LLC-PK cell monolayers with GCDCA alone induced 6-fold and 2-fold increases in paracellular diffusion of 4-kDa FITC-dextran and 70-kDa FITC-dextran, respectively (Fig. 1B) . Binding of PSaV VLPs showed a pattern similar to that of PSaV particles, leading to 20-fold and 10-fold increases in the diffusion of 4-kDa FITC-dextran and 70-kDa FITC-dextran, respectively (Fig. 1B) . Taken together, these results indicate that PSaV infection induced dissociation of TJs, leading to an increase in paracellular permeability.",

We also checked the distribution of the basolateral membrane marker Na \u03e9 K \u03e9 -ATPase after incubation with PSaV particles or VLPs. Mockinfected cells without any treatment showed clear basolateral distribution of Na \u03e9 K \u03e9 -ATPase (Fig. 1C) . However, inoculation of LLC-PK with purified PSaV particles or VLPs or treatment with EGTA resulted in translocation of Na \u03e9 K \u03e9 -ATPase to the apical surface (Fig. 1C) .

During basolateral entry of viruses, including rotavirus, coxsackievirus B, and PEDV, TJ proteins have been observed to relocalize from the cell surface to the cytoplasm (5, 17, 18) . Therefore, we explored the cellular distribution of TJ-associated proteins following PSaV infection. Confocal microscopy (CM) observation showed the sharp ring-like structures of the three transmembrane proteins occludin, claudin-1, and JAM-1, as well as their submembranous scaffolding protein, ZO-1, in control monolayers ( Fig. 2A) . However, among these proteins, intracytoplasmic translocation of occludin was more pronounced than that of claudin-1, JAM-1, or ZO-1 at early time points (30 and 60 min p.i. with PSaV) ( Fig. 2A and B ). This result was confirmed by localization of occludin during PSaV infection using z-stacking CM. Pronounced accumulation of occludin in the cytoplasm was evident, whereas ZO-1 remained in the paracellular junction area during early PSaV infection (Fig. 2C) . These data indicate that PSaV infection promotes the internalization of occludin, which was more conspicuous than that of the other TJ-associated proteins investigated.",

            "text": "Occludin functions as a coreceptor for PSaV. To explore further whether PSaVs enter cells with the involvement of TJ proteins, we first examined the colocalization of PSaVs with TJ proteins. We first checked whether Alexa Fluor 594 (AF594)-labeled PSaV particles were infectious using plaque and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) assays. AF594-labeled PSaV particles were shown to be infectious, though their infectivity was 10-fold less than that of the purified nonlabeled PSaV particles (Fig. 3) . Having established the infectivity of AF594-labeled PSaV particles, LLC-PK cells were infected with AF594-labeled PSaV and then examined by CM. As shown in Fig. 4A , AF594-labeled PSaV particles showed extensive colocalization with occludin. Some PSaV-free occludins were also internalized into the cytoplasm. No prominent interaction between PSaV particles and other major TJ transmembrane proteins, such as claudin-1, JAM-1, or the cytoplasmic scaffolding protein ZO-1, were visible by CM (Fig. 4A) . We next investigated whether PSaVs interact directly with TJ molecules as coreceptors. To assess this, LLC-PK cells were either mock infected or infected with the PSaV strain Cowden, and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated using antibodies specific for occludin, claudin-1, JAM-1, ZO-1, or PSaV capsid protein. The antibody specific for occludin significantly precipitated PSaV in comparison to precipitation by the antibodies specific to the other TJ molecules tested (Fig. 4B ). Consistent with this result, antibody against PSaV capsid protein significantly precipitated occludin, but not claudin-1, JAM-1, and ZO-1 (Fig. 4C) . To confirm the direct interaction between PSaV and occludin, we performed a pulldown assay using free glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged occludin and purified PSaV particles or PSaV VLPs. As shown in Fig. 4D , The lysates of PSaV-infected LLC-PK cells were immunoprecipitated with antibodies specific for OCC, JAM-1, ZO-1, or CLD-1. As a mock control, immunoglobulin G was used for immunoprecipitation (IP) of the virus-infected cell lysates. The coimmunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by Western blotting to detect OCC, JAM-1, ZO-1, or CLD-1 using the relevant antibody. To confirm the presence of each target protein in the cell lysates (input), the lysates of PSaV-infected LLC-PK cells were directly analyzed by Western blotting using the relevant antibody. (C) The lysates of PSaV-infected LLC-PK cells were immunoprecipitated with antibodies specific for PSaV capsid protein. As a mock control, mock-infected cell lysates were used for immunoprecipitation. The coimmunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by Western blotting to detect occludin, JAM-1, ZO-1, or CLD-1 using the relevant antibody. To confirm the presence of each target protein and PSaV capsid protein in the cell lysates (input), the lysates of PSaV-infected LLC-PK cells were directly analyzed by Western blotting using the relevant antibody. (D) Soluble-form GST-tagged occludin (1 g/ml) was mixed with PSaV particles (MOI \u03ed 50) or PSaV VLPs (4 g/ml). Each complex was pulled down with MagneGST beads and then evaluated by Western blotting using antibody specific for PSaV capsid protein. The input occludin was also quantified by Western blot analysis. As a mock control, solution without PSaV particles, PSaV VLPs, and soluble-form GST-tagged occludin was pulled down with MagneGST beads and then evaluated by Western blotting using antibody specific for PSaV capsid protein or occludin. All experiments were performed in triplicate, and representative images from each group are presented.",

To further examine whether inhibition of TJ molecules can impair PSaV entry, we silenced the expression of occludin, claudin-1, JAM-1, and ZO-1 in LLC-PK cells. Cells were transfected with pooled small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting four individual sites in each gene, helping to reduce off-target effects. Subsequent protein expression was examined by Western blot analysis and CM. Expression of occludin, claudin-1, JAM-1, and ZO-1 was significantly reduced at 48 h posttransfection (hpt) compared to protein expression at 24 hpt (Fig. 6A ). This was further confirmed by CM (Fig. 6B ). We next investigated the knockdown effects of these TJ proteins on PSaV entry. As expected, silencing of occludin expression significantly inhibited the entry of AF594-labeled PSaV particles into the cells, whereas transfection with scrambled siRNA (siScram) allowed the entry of AF594-labeled PSaV particles into the cytoplasm (Fig. 6C) . Unexpectedly, knockdown of claudin-1 had a moderate inhibitory effect on PSaV entry into cells (Fig. 6C ). In addition, siRNA knockdown of JAM-1 or ZO-1 had no effect on PSaV entry (Fig. 6C ). To assess whether off-target effects of siRNAs contributed to the results described above in occludin-silenced cells, we constructed a plasmid (GFP-WT-OCC) containing a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged wild-type occludin gene and two mutant plasmids (GFP-M1-OCC and GFP-M2-OCC) containing four silent-mutation sites corresponding to the four pooled siRNAs. The occludin-siRNA target sequences and mutation sites are shown in Fig. 7A . Cells harboring GFP-WT-OCC were sensitive to transfection with the pooled siRNAs targeting occludin ( Fig. 7B and C), while cells harboring GFP-M1-OCC or GFP-M2-OCC were insensitive to transfection with the pooled siRNAs ( Fig. 7B and C). These results indicate that occludin is required by PSaV at a postattachment step and suggest that claudin-1 may function as an entry factor.",

Moreover, knockdown of claudin-1 also significantly decreased PSaV genome copy numbers, PSaV VPg protein synthesis, and PSaV titers (Fig. 8) . However, silencing of JAM-1 and ZO-1 had no inhibitory effects on PSaV genome replication, PSaV VPg protein synthesis, or PSaV titers (Fig. 8) . We further examined the effects of silencing of occludin and claudin-1 together on PSaV VPg protein synthesis and PSaV titers. Transfection of combined siRNAs against occludin and claudin-1 led to the downregulation of their target proteins, as shown by Western blot analysis (Fig. 9A ). As expected, when siRNAs for occludin and claudin-1 were combined, a significant decrease in PSaV genome copy numbers, titers, and VPg protein synthesis were observed ( Fig. 9B to D). Taken together, our results indicate that PSaV utilizes occludin as a coreceptor and that claudin-1 may serve as an entry factor.",

The viral protein VPg and the genome were detected at 24 h p.i. (Fig. 10B and C) but were significantly decreased by 48 h p.i. (Fig. 10B and C). Compared with LLC-PK cells infected with PSaV, VPg expression and genome copy numbers were very low in pmRFP-OCC-transfected CHO cells ( Fig. 10B and C).

Small GTPases in the Rab family regulate membrane-trafficking events, including endocytosis. Rab5 is a key regulator controlling the internalization of vesicles and fusion with early endosomes (52), whereas Rab7 is primarily associated with late endosomal maturation and endosome-lysosome fusion (53) . These characteristics can be used to differentiate between endosomal compartments: early endosomes contain Rab5 and its effector, EEA1, whereas late endosomes contain Rab7 and its effector, LAMP2 (54) . PSaV strain Cowden is known to travel from early to late endosomes prior to PSaV uncoating and genome release into the cytoplasm (55, 56) . Therefore, we examined trafficking of PSaV from early to late endosomes prior to determining whether PSaV and occludin travel in a complex to these endosomal compartments. Consistent with previous reports (55, 56) , most AF594-labeled PSaV particles colocalized with the early endosome marker EEA1 at 30 min p.i. and with the late endosome marker LAMP2 at 60 min p.i. (Fig. 11A and 12A ), confirming the journey of PSaV from early to late endosomes (55, 56) .",

            "text": "Journal of Virology (40-42, 44, 60) . The usage of \u24232,3and \u24232,6-linked SAs on O-linked glycoproteins as attachment factors for PSaV entry and infection was previously described (36) . In the present study, we found that PSaV and occludin interact directly and enter cells as a complex, as demonstrated by treatment of cells with specific siRNAs or MAbs. These data indicate that, similar to FCV and Hom-1 vesivirus, PSaV utilizes a TJ protein, occludin, as a coreceptor (44, 60) . Given the previous results (36), we conclude that PSaV first attaches to SAs on the apical cell surface, dissociates TJs, moves into the TJs, and then binds to occludin for successful entry and infection. Cell-cell adhesion is safeguarded and sealed by the apical-junctional complex, composed of TJs, adherent junctions, and desmosomes (8, 61) . Therefore, viruses utilizing apical-junctional complex molecules as receptors have devised specific strategies to disrupt the apical-junctional complex as a part of their cellular pathogenesis, resulting in successful entry and later clinical consequences, such as diarrhea in the case of sapovirus infections (4, 5, 8, 18) . In this context, we hypothesized that PSaVs disrupt and then open TJs prior to attachment to occludin. In the present study, we showed that early infection of PSaV induced decreased TER in conjunction with increased paracellular permeability. Moreover, alterations in the TJ fence function in response to PSaV infection were observed, as shown by lateral diffusion of the lipid probe, Bodify FL-C12-sphingomyelin-BSA complex, administered apically. The rotavirus surface pro- 1 or pmRFP1-occludin (pmRFP1-OCC), and expression of occludin was checked by confocal microscopy using antibody specific for occludin. (B) CHO cells grown in 8-well chamber slides were transfected with pCDNA3.1 or pmRFP1-OCC plasmid and then incubated for 24 h. The cells were then infected with PSaV (MOI \u03ed 50) and incubated for the indicated times. The cells were washed, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.01% Triton X-100, and then stained with antibody specific for PSaV VPg. The cells were mounted with SlowFade Gold antifade reagent containing 1\u03eb DAPI solution for staining of nuclei. The slides were analyzed immediately by x-sectioning under a confocal microscope. (C) CHO cells grown in 6-well plates at 70 to 80% confluence were transfected with 1 g pmRFP1-OCC. At 24 h posttransfection, the cells were infected with PSaV strain Cowden (MOI \u03ed 50) and incubated for the indicated times. LLC-PK monolayers grown in 6-well plates were inoculated with PSaV strain Cowden (MOI \u03ed 50) and incubated for 24 h. The cell lysates harvested at the specified time points were analyzed by Western blotting using antibody specific for PSaV VPg protein. GAPDH was used as a loading control. The MFC was calculated using GelQuant.NET software by comparing the relative density of siRNA-treated samples to that of siScram-treated samples. Experiments were performed in triplicate, and representative images are presented in panels A to C. (D) CHO cells grown in 6-well plates were transfected and incubated with pCDNA3.1 or pmRPF1-OCC plasmid for 24 h and then infected with PSaV strain Cowden (MOI \u03ed 50). The CHO cells were harvested at 24, 48, and 72 h p.i. LLC-PK cells cultured in 6-well plates were mock infected or infected with PSaV strain Cowden (MOI \u03ed 50) and harvested at 24 h p.i. All the samples were processed for quantitative real-time PCR to determe viral genome copy numbers as described in Materials and Methods. Data are presented as means and standard errors of the mean for triplicate experiments. tein VP8* modulates the gate and fence functions of TJs in epithelial cells, and the VP4 surface protein of some rotavirus strains defines the requirement for JAM-A as a basolateral coreceptor (5, 10) . Similar to the mechanism of basolateral entry by rotaviruses, we have shown that PSaV can dissociate TJs, exposing occludin, which is sequestered in the apical-junctional complexes at the lateral surfaces of cells. PSaV then hijacks occludin as a coreceptor for entry and infection. In addition, a relatively large proportion of intracellular occludin did not colocalize with PSaV particles. Although the reason for this is not known, binding of PSaV particles to attachment receptors may activate signaling pathways that facilitate internalization of virus-free occludin into the cytoplasm. Further studies are required to examine whether PSaV induces activation of such a signaling pathway(s).",

            "text": "In addition to the role of apical-junctional complexes as receptors or coreceptors, they can also be used by many viruses as entry factors (4). In the present study, claudin-1, JAM-1, and ZO-1 were less extensively internalized into cells in response to PSaV infection and did not colocalize with PSaV in the cytoplasm. Moreover, direct interaction between these proteins and PSaV was not evident by immunoprecipitation assay. However, transfection of siRNA targeting claudin-1 partially blocked PSaV entry, as well as significantly reducing viral genome copy numbers, protein synthesis, and titers. Similar findings have been observed in studies of the entry processes of some viruses, including rotavirus, PED coronavirus, and coxsackie B virus. In these studies, TJ proteins, such as claudin-1, were found to serve as scaffolds that recruit and anchor signaling or regulatory molecules to the vicinity of virus entry (10, 17, 18) . Taken together, our results suggest that claudin-1 serves as a scaffold at the site of PSaV entry. The functional roles of other claudins as potential entry receptors or entry factors for PSaV warrant further research. The PSaV strain Cowden is the only cultivable member of the genus Sapovirus and can grow in a porcine kidney cell line in the presence of intestinal contents or bile acid (31) . In characterizing the role of occludin in PSaV entry, the ectopic expression of occludin in CHO cells rendered them susceptible to infection. However, the replicative cycle of PSaV was not sustained in occludin-expressing CHO cells. This may be due to insufficient host cell machinery required for viral protein and RNA synthesis, as well as virion assembly. This finding was in contrast to results described for Hom-1 calicivirus, where transfection of human JAM-1 (hJAM-1) in CHO cells enabled successful replication of virus (44) . Further studies are needed to find other cells suitable for investigation of PSaV infection and to discover the host machinery required for PSaV replication.",

Bile acids are critical for PSaV genome escape from late endosomes into the cell cytoplasm to start viral replication (55) . Interestingly, in the present study, the addition of the bile acid GCDCA decreased TER and increased paracellular permeability in LLC-PK cells, thereby aiding in the dissociation of TJs. This suggests that, in addition to aiding PSaV escape from late endosomes, bile acids can facilitate early interactions between PSaV and occludin through the dissociation of TJs. Bile acids have previously been reported to modulate intestinal permeability by autophosphorylation of the epithelial growth factor (EGF) receptor and dephosphorylation and rearrangement of occludin at TJs (63) . Moreover, the role of bile acids in opening TJs is known to be mediated by src family kinases and is ameliorated by EGF treatment (63) . A correlation between the presence of bile acid and TJ modification upon PSaV entry has not been fully investigated. Therefore, further studies are required to elucidate this particular function of bile acid during PSaV entry.",

Of the various small GTPases present on endosomes, Rab5 and Rab7 are critical for the function of early endosomes and late endosomes, respectively (64, 65) . Consistent with the results of previous studies (55, 56) , we found that PSaV particles progressed from EEA1-positive early endosomes to LAMP2-positive late endosomes very early in infection and that this trafficking was decreased by siRNAs specific for the early endosome marker Rab5 or the late endosome marker Rab7. Interestingly, inhibition of Rab5 or Rab7 by transfection of siRNAs diminished the coentry of PSaV and occludin into the cytoplasm. These results were confirmed by transfection of plasmids expressing dominant-negative mutants of Rab5 (S34N) or Rab7 (T22N), which also inhibited trafficking of PSaV particles in complex with occludin from early to late endosomes. The direct interaction between PSaV and occludin, as well as entry of PSaV and occludin as complexes into the cytoplasm, suggested that these complexes travel from early to late endosomes. This result was similar to those of previous studies, which showed that, regardless of the usage of TJ proteins as receptors, TJ proteins internalized into cells during virus entry, or during constitutive trafficking, could be transported to their endosomal compartments (18, 50, 66) .",

Scale bars, 50 m. (B) Quantification of the internalization of occludin, claudin-1, JAM-1, and ZO-1 under the conditions for panel A was determined by counting cells containing each TJ protein in the cytoplasm and expressed as a percentage of the total cell numbers. The error bars indicate standard errors of the mean. (C) Confluent LLC-PK monolayers infected or not with PSaV (MOI \u03ed 50) in the presence or absence of 200 M GCDCA bile acid were fixed and stained for occludin and ZO-1 at 30 min p.i.
