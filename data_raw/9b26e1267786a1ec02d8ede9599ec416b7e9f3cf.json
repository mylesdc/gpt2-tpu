Viral infections are an important issue for human health and cause considerable economic losses when agriculturally important crops or husbandry animals are infected. The advent of metagenomics has provided a precious tool to study viruses by sampling them in natural environments and identifying the genomic composition of a sample. However, reaching a clear recognition and taxonomic assignment of the identified viruses has been hampered by the computational difficulty of these problems. In this perspective paper we examine the trends in current research for the identification of viral sequences in a metagenomic sample, pinpoint the intrinsic computational difficulties for the identification of novel viral sequences within metagenomic samples, and suggest possible avenues to overcome them.",

The analysis of microbial communities has been until recently a complicated if not untractable task due to their high diversity and to the fact that many of these organisms cannot be cultured. Harnessing the major advances achieved in sequencing technologies, metagenomics has emerged as the only currently available approach to extensively characterize these largely unculturable communities. Besides vastly enriching our knowledge of microbial diversity in a varied range of environments, and providing information on the dynamics and on the overall functioning of microbial communities, metagenomics is also shedding light on many important biological processes and, in particular, on the role of the microbiome in biological functions essential for the development of higher order organisms harboring it (Blotti\u00e8re et al., 2013; Manor et al., 2014) , or in the development of pathological problems (C\u00e9nit et al., 2014; Vayssier-Taussat et al., 2014) . In addition, metagenomic efforts also vastly enrich the repertoire of genes available for biotechnological applications (Ni and Tokuda, 2013) .",

Consequently, the viral part of the microbiome has been shown in a number of situations to have a major impact on the dynamics and on the evolutionary processes of their host populations.

From the biodiversity point of view, the identification of unknown viruses representing novel higher order taxa (genera, families. . . ) is of clear interest as evidenced, for example, by the discovery of the Mimiviruses with genomes exceeding in size those of many bacterial genomes (Claverie et al., 2009) .

Alignment-based methods suffer from two limitations: speed and lack of sensitivity (e.g., Bazinet and Cummings, 2012; Wood and Salzberg, 2014) . Recently, novel solutions have been suggested to overcome these limitations. These methods are based on long k-mers (words of size k) and conceptually rely on the fact that when k is sufficiently large, k-mers become very specific. Consequently, the idea is to index the databases by long k-mers. This is indeed the foundation of MegaBlast (a general-purpose sequence aligner using long seeds), but also of a number of methods specific for taxonomic assignment such as LMAT (Ames et al., 2013) and Kraken (Wood and Salzberg, 2014) . The downside of these approaches is overspecificity, which makes classification of unknown sequences problematic. This limitation can be particularly acute given the known very high intraspecific variability existing in some viral species or higher order taxa. For example, current criteria of the International Committee for the taxonomy of viruses tolerate up to 28% of nucleotide sequence divergence for the polymerase or capsid protein genes for isolates of a same species in the Betaflexiviridae family and a similar level of divergence at the whole genome level in the Potyviridae family (King et al., 2012) .",

            "text": "While this approach is feasible for bacterial populations, it is not applicable for the analysis of viral communities due to the absence of such marker genes (e.g., Edwards and Rohwer, 2005) . Virome studies concentrate on the viral part of the environmental sample and isolate viral genomes encapsidated in viral particles that are purified by a combination of filtration and (utlra)centrifugation. This now popular approach drastically reduces the complexity of the community, which makes it possible to assemble longer contigs routinely (10 kb and more), and even complete genomes from low-complexity samples (Coetzee et al., 2010; Minot et al., 2012) . However, it does not really solve the problem of first-level assignment but merely sidesteps it: given the purification step, all generated sequences are generally considered \"by definition\" as viral, unless proven otherwise by homology-based approaches. In addition, this strategy is not without some caveats (see for more details Fancello et al., 2012) . For example, the purified particles may contain cellular genome fragments rather than viral genomes, because of the presence of GTA (Lang and Beatty, 2007) or as a consequence of generalized transduction (for a review see Frost et al., 2005) . Also, while 0.22 \u00b5 filtering avoids contamination by bacterial, archaeal or eukaryotic cells, other DNA-containing elements, such as bacterial vesicles (Biller et al., 2014) may co-purifiy with virions. Such filtering-based purification also excludes the largest viruses and therefore results in an incomplete picture of viral diversity. Moreover, both LA (see Duhaime et al., 2012) and MDA amplifications have their downfalls. For the former, adapter ligation is only possible for dsDNA viruses and hence ssDNA viral genomes are mostly absent in the sample. For the latter, the amplification is preferentially performed for circular ssDNA viruses rather than dsDNA. The effect of the presence of cellular genes on the bioinformatics analysis of viral metagenomic data has been described and some approaches to detect their presence have been proposed (Roux et al., 2014) .",

Since we are interested in the identification of novel species in large metagenomic samples, we adopted the representation of sequences as k-mer frequency vectors. We analyzed these three classification tasks using an instancelevel analysis of data complexity. In supervised machine learning, the performance of a classifier is dependent both on the learning algorithm (e.g., SVM or Na\u00efve Bayes) and on the training data. While global metrics recapitulate overall performances of a classifier, they fail to indicate whether moderate performances are a consequence of wrong parameter adjustments, biased resampling for training data or of the intrinsic difficulty of the classification task. However, recent literature on instance misclassifications demonstrates that for a given classification task, some instances are intrinsically hard to classify and that their presence is indicative of the global difficulty (see Smith et al. (2014) for a review). Most studies agree on the hardness of outlier instances or on instances belonging to a minority class, but Smith demonstrated that simple metrics can actually quantify the intrinsic hardness of an instance. One of these metrics is the k-Disagreeing Neighbors (kDN), which measures for a given instance the number of k nearest neighbors that do not share its class label. Smith demonstrated that the kDN measure is strongly positively correlated with the misclassification of an instance over a wide range of learning algorithms and of training data resampling.",

The corresponding class hardness is then measured as the median kDN of all the contigs in a given class. We also determined whether an observed median kDN is significantly extreme (low value indicating easy classification, high value corresponding to difficult classes), by estimating the distribution of the median kDN under the null hypothesis of no relation between class labels by random permutations. We summarize in Figure 1 the distribution of kDN by class for each of three tasks. The upper panel shows that for the firstlevel classification task, archaeal and bacterial contigs can be easily assigned to their respective domain, and that this classification is hard for eukaryotic contigs and even harder for viral ones. When the classification task is restricted to bacteria only (panels C1 and C2), fine-grained classification is not hard at both phylum and class levels. For viruses (panels B1 and B2), fine-grained classification to groups (ssDNA, dsRNA etc.) is hard, while assigning a viral sequence to a family level is easier, though less easy than for bacteria.

However, evidence contradicting this observation has also been proposed, for example for large viruses (Mra\u00eczek and Karlin, 2007) and for viruses of monocots and dicots (Adams and Antoniw, 2004) . We investigated whether the classification difficulty could be explained by overlapping k-mer distributions between different types of hosts and viruses that infect them. To this end we sampled 4689 contigs from each first level cellular groups (archaeal, bacterial, plant and fungal genomes); and of viruses known to infect them. Using principal component analysis (PCA), we projected the 3-mers frequencies vectors of these contigs on 2 dimensions. Figure 2 shows that viral and cellular contigs are spread uniformly in these 2 dimensions, with the exception of plants viruses that are more compact. Using local density analysis, we observed that contigs of bacterial viruses indeed are close to their hosts (points 12 and 6, 13, and 7), but that they are also as close to archaeal contigs (points 13 and 3). On the other hand, archaeal viruses are not close to their hosts; while plant viruses are closer to bacteria and archaea than to their hosts.",

We have shown that the reason why this problem has been eluding a satisfactory solution lies in its intrinsic computational difficulty. The reason for this difficulty lies in the fact that viral sequences k-mer distributions overlap with cellular one's almost indiscriminately. This is to be contrasted with the relative ease of the corresponding classification task for archaea and bacteria that certainly underlies the success of bacterial taxonomic assignment studies. The difficulty for viral sequence classification will be alleviated as the public sequence databases become further populated with acquired viral data but this will not provide a sufficient solution to the problem of novel species discovery.",
