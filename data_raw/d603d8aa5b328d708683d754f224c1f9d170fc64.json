            "text": "The aim of the present study was to investigate long-term outcomes of the offspring in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced maternal immune activation (MIA) model and the effect of maternal molecular hydrogen (H 2 ) administration. We have previously demonstrated in the MIA mouse model that maternal administration of H 2 attenuates oxidative damage and neuroinflammation, including induced pro-inflammatory cytokines and microglial activation, in the fetal brain. Short-term memory, sociability and social novelty, and sensorimotor gating were evaluated using the Y-maze, threechamber, and prepulse inhibition (PPI) tests, respectively, at postnatal 3 or 4 weeks. The number of neurons and oligodendrocytes was also analyzed at postnatal 5 weeks by immunohistochemical analysis. Offspring of the LPS-exposed dams showed deficits in short-term memory and social interaction, following neuronal and oligodendrocytic loss in the amygdala and cortex. Maternal H 2 administration markedly attenuated these LPS-induced abnormalities. Moreover, we evaluated the effect of H 2 on LPS-induced astrocytic activation, both in vivo and in vitro. The number of activated astrocytes with hypertrophic morphology was increased in LPS-exposed offspring, but decreased in the offspring of H 2 -administered dams. In primary cultured astrocytes, LPS-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines were attenuated by H 2 administration. Overall, these findings indicate that maternal H 2 administration exerts neuroprotective effects and ameliorates MIA-induced neurodevelopmental deficits of offspring later in life.",

            "text": "We have previously suggested that the maternal administration of molecular hydrogen (H 2 ) plays a neuroprotective role in the fetal brain against injury caused by oxidative stress and inflammation 12-14 . Ohsawa et al. discovered that H 2 acts as an antioxidant that selectively neutralizes hydroxyl radicals (\u2022OH) and protects the brain from injury 15 . H 2 reacts with strong oxidants, such as \u2022OH, but remains mild enough to neither disturb the metabolic redox reactions nor affect ROS signaling. Several subsequent studies have explored the therapeutic and preventive effects of H 2 , and have indicated that H 2 has other properties as well, including anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects 16, 17 . The safety and some promising benefits of H 2 have already been demonstrated, not only in animal models but also in patients, including those with Parkinson's disease 18 , diabetes mellitus 19 and mild cognitive impairment 20 , although no large randomized controlled trials have been conducted to date. Recently, we demonstrated that the administration of H 2 to pregnant mouse dams significantly increased H 2 concentration in the fetal brain, through the maternal-fetal interface, in a mouse model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced MIA 12 . Fetal damage in this MIA model and the effect of maternal H 2 administration on this damage can be summarized as follows 12 : (1) high mortality rate of MIA fetuses, (2) brain injury associated with elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, aberrant microglial activation, and oxidative damage in the MIA fetal brains, and (3) attenuation of these adverse outcomes by maternal H 2 administration. Thus, the protective effect of maternal H 2 administration on short-term outcomes in the MIA offspring has been demonstrated. However, long-term outcomes of the surviving offspring are yet to be investigated. Therefore, the present study investigated long-term neurological outcomes in the MIA mouse model and the efficacy of H 2 administration in pregnant dams, using both histological and behavioral examinations. Astrocytes, which are the most abundant cell population in the CNS, play a key role in normal brain development 21, 22 . However, when astrocytes are exposed to maternally-derived cytokines in MIA models, they secrete various cytokines that lead to neurodevelopmental impairments 23 . Moreover, activation of astrocytes is known to be a factor in the prolongation of brain damage, and contributes to the formation of glial scars that limit neuronal plasticity 24 . Thus, in the present study, the MIA-related astrocytic activation and its modification by H 2 administration were also investigated, both in vivo and in vitro.",

            "text": "The association between maternal immune activation (MIA) and subsequent neurodevelopmental disorders in offspring has become increasingly recognized, with both epidemiological evidence and research findings in various animal models [1] [2] [3] [4] . MIA against viral or bacterial infections influences the developing fetal central nervous system (CNS), and increases the risk of schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) later in life [5] [6] [7] . It has been suggested that MIA has a strong impact on microglial development, and microglial disturbance disrupts neurogenesis, neuronal migration, and myelination, thus leading to consequent impairments in the brain function of the offspring 2 . Based on these findings, MIA is believed to be a disease primer 1 . It has also been reported that MIA and MIA-induced fetal neuroinflammation stimulate the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and disturbances in pro-inflammatory cytokine production in the fetal brain 8, 9 . These changes are reported to Maternal H 2 administration attenuated the behavioral deficits induced by LPS exposure. Since MIA has been considered to be a cause of behavioral abnormalities in offspring, including ASD/ Schizophrenia-like behavior, we subsequently evaluated the effect of LPS and maternal administration of HW on short-term memory, sociability, social novelty, and sensorimotor gating. As shown in Fig. 2A , spontaneous alternation was markedly reduced in the LPS group than in the Control group (p < 0.001) in the Y-maze test, which is indicative of impaired short-term memory. Treatment with H 2 significantly attenuated the LPS-induced impairment of short-term memory (p < 0.05). There was no difference in the total number of arm entries among the three groups (Control, 24.0 \u00b1 1.3; LPS, 22.6 \u00b1 0.61; HW + LPS, 22.7 \u00b1 0.91).",

Moreover, the amygdala interacts with the hippocampus in relation to memory 28 . Based on those findings, we subsequently performed Nissl staining and evaluated the number of neurons in the amygdala, cerebral cortex, and hippocampus to investigate the brain regions related to the results of the behavioral deficits induced by LPS exposure. The quantitative results revealed significant reductions in the number of neurons in the amygdala and cerebral cortex in the LPS-treated offspring than in the Control group (p < 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively; Fig. 3A , panels a,b,d,e and 3B), but not in the hippocampus (Fig. S1 ).

As shown in Fig. 5 , stimulation of astrocytes with LPS for three hours led to marked increases in tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) (p < 0.001), interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 (p < 0.001), and IL-6 (p < 0.001) mRNA expression.

Altered gene expression patterns in primary cultured astrocytes from the Control group, the LPS group, and the HW + LPS group. As we previously described the gene expression profile of microglia 12 , differential gene expression patterns of astrocytes from newborn mice in the Control group, the LPS group, and the HW + LPS group were also observed (Tables S1-S4, Supplementary Information).

Previously, we reported that maternal H 2 administration suppresses microglial activation in the same model. In the present study, H 2 also suppressed the activation of astrocytes, both in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, these results suggest that H 2 exerts a protective role against MIA-induced neuroinflammation through the suppression of microglia and astrocytes. As a result, mature oligodendrocytes were restored and neurons were protected from damage, thus leading to improved long-term neurological outcomes following maternal H 2 administration. Prenatal exposure to LPS also resulted in a transient reduction in body weight of the offspring between P6 -P10, which was attenuated by maternal H 2 administration. This might be due to a change in the activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis 35 . Deficient post-neonatal growth has been reported to contribute to poor neurologic outcome 36 , thus, the transient decrease of weight observed in this model might be related to the neurological impairments in the offspring.",

In addition, models of bacterial-like immune activation by LPS are also well known to precipitate inflammatory responses and behavioral abnormalities in offspring, similar to the poly(I:C) models 38 . However, with respect to neurotoxicity, LPS exposure may have a stronger effect on the fetal brain than poly(I:C) exposure 29 . Thus, the type of pathogen is important for the pattern of neurodevelopmental abnormalities of the offspring, and the timing and dose of the pathogen's administration, in addition to the strain or species, may also have an influence.

In our MIA model, a remarkable loss of neurons was observed in the amygdala and cerebral cortex of the offspring, but not in the hippocampus. The formation of memory is encoded in a broad network of cortical/subcortical regions including the hippocampus, cingulate cortex, and amygdala 42 . Moreover, the amygdala is directly connected to and dynamically interacts with the hippocampus in relation to memory 28 . Therefore, a decreased number of neurons in the amygdala and cerebral cortex could consequently result in short-term memory impairments.

In this model, the social behavior including sociability and social novelty preference was impaired. The number of oligodendrocytes in the amygdala, cerebral cortex, and white matter in the offspring was decreased, which is consistent with previous findings 47 ; and a reduced number of neurons in the amygdala and cortex was also observed. Strong evidence suggests a crucial involvement of the amygdala in social processing and social cognition in humans [48] [49] [50] , as well as in social behavior in animals [51] [52] [53] . A recent report also suggested an association between the function of the cortex and the amygdala, and social behavior 54 . Therefore, the social behavior impairment observed in the present study is compatible with the neuronal and oligodendrocytic loss in the amygdala and cortex. A locomotor test was not performed in this study, although we observed no apparent differences in speed of movement among all groups in the three-chamber social test. Interestingly, there were no remarkable differences in the PPI test in our MIA model, and sensorimotor gating was also normal in comparison with the Control group. A possible explanation for these results is that PPI abnormalities might occur following exposure to a pathogen at mid-gestation 55 , while impairments in short-term memory and social behavior might be independent of the timing of exposure to a pathogen 2 . Thus, the negative results of the PPI test might be due to the fact that in the present model, LPS exposure occurs at late gestation, on embryonic day 17 (E17). Impairments in short-term memory and social behavior are well described in schizophrenia and ASD 38, 56 . PPI impairments manifest primarily in adults with ASD 57 , and are not observed in children with ASD 58 . A recent study further suggested that sensorimotor gating is only impaired in certain ASD subgroups 59 , although it may be a globally common feature in schizophrenia 60 . Therefore, the present model may reflect ASD-like rather than schizophrenia-like behavioral impairments.",

We and others have also previously demonstrated microglial activation, enhanced pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, including IL-6, and elevated oxidative damage in fetal brains 12, [63] [64] [65] . In the MIA model, microglia play a major role, along with astrocytes, in synaptic pruning and neural circuit formation 2 . In addition, a single injection of IL-6 is known to lead to the same behavioral abnormalities as those observed in the LPS models 66 (IL-6 is thought to be a key cytokine in the link between MIA and the behavioral deficits in the offspring 38 ). In our previous report, maternal H 2 administration reduced both the excessive microglial activation and the increased IL-6 levels in the MIA fetal brains 12 , which could ameliorate the behavioral deficits later in life. Previous studies in adult rodents reported that H 2 treatment could mitigate the behavioral dysfunctions, including short-term memory deficits, cognitive impairments, and depressive-like behaviors, by regulating inflammation and ROS production 67, 68 , which is in line with our current results. Moreover, the present study demonstrated that prenatal H 2 administration restored the MIA-induced neuronal and oligodendrocytic loss, and suppressed the excessive activation of astrocytes at postnatal 5 weeks. It was also shown that H 2 directly attenuated the LPS-induced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6, in primary cultured astrocytes. These cytokines are known to induce apoptosis in oligodendrocytes and hypomyelination in the neonatal rodent 69 . Thus, the suppressive effect of H 2 on both microglial and astrocytic activation would protect neurons and oligodendrocytes against LPS exposure.",

            "text": "The pathological mechanism by which MIA causes psychiatric diseases in offspring is completely unknown, however we speculate that the following steps may be involved 29, 70 . Intrauterine inflammation activates fetal microglia during the acute phase, and subsequently, microglia also activate astrocytes. In the chronic phase, microglial activation is attenuated, while astrocytes are continuously activated 29 . Both microglia and astrocytes are important for normal neurodevelopment, however under prenatal inflammation, they are activated, their function is altered, and they have an adverse effect on neurons and axons, with the overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines 34 . Inflammation also prevents the maturation of oligodendroglial progenitor cells, followed by a reduction of the oligodendrocyte lineage 71, 72 . This reduction leads to axonal loss. The neuronal and axonal damage caused by microglia or astrocytes in the developing brain would result in the abnormal behavioral features in later life. In our model, we have previously reported over-activation of fetal microglia 8 h after the LPS insult 12 , and the present study demonstrated that activation of astrocytes continued even ~5 weeks after the insult. Moreover, the number of neurons and oligodendrocytes were reduced in the amygdala and white matter, respectively. We have previously reported that H 2 has a suppressive effect on microglial activation 12 , and the present study demonstrated that H 2 had a similar effect on astrocytes, as described above. From these findings, we speculate that H 2 would protect neurons and oligodendrocytes indirectly via suppression of the over-activation of immune cells, including microglia and astrocytes, which would result in a reduction of the behavioral abnormalities present in MIA offspring. However, in this study, a direct effect of H 2 on neurons and oligodendrocytes was not evaluated in vitro, thus, this possibility cannot be excluded.",

In the current MIA model, additional core features of ASD, including restricted and repetitive behavioral patterns, were not investigated 73 . Thus, the effect of maternal H 2 administration on these symptoms remains unknown. The sensorimotor gating abnormality may be evaluated at an older age than was described in the present model, however, this might require changing other factors including the timing of exposure. Since the mouse brain is not considered to be fully mature until 3 weeks of age 74 , the interpretation of the results of behavioral tests in the present study requires considerable caution. In addition, we could not avoid the detrimental effects of maternal separation required for the measurement of body weight on offspring development. However, the separation was performed similarly for the offspring in all three groups, thus any effect should be minimal, and consistent across groups. In humans, it is currently thought that the occurrence of multiple risk factors, including genetic mutations and postnatal exposure to inflammation or other environmental triggers, may be required for the onset of ASD 1, 38 . Before advancing the clinical application of H 2 , it should be investigated whether H 2 could exert similar effects in so called 'multi-hit' models. Finally, in the previous and present studies, maternal H 2 administration was performed prior to the LPS exposure; thus, the therapeutic potential of H 2 remains unclear. Therefore, it might be relevant to evaluate the therapeutic effects of H 2 by administering H 2 to dams after exposure to LPS and in offspring.",

The neuroprotection is thought to be due to the suppression of neuroinflammation, including excessive activation of microglia and astrocytes and the increased level of pro-inflammatory cytokines, as reported previously 12 .
