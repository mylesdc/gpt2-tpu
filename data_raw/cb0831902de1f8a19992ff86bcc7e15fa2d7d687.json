It is possible that the common exposure history at a seafood market in Wuhan originated from the human-to-human transmission events within the market, and the early, strong emphasis that market exposure indicated animal-to-human transmission was potentially the result of observer bias. To support the hypothesis of zoonotic origin of 2019-nCoV stemming from the Huanan seafood market, the index case should have had exposure history related to the market and the virus should have been identified from animals sold at the market. As these requirements remain unmet, zoonotic spillover at the market must not be overemphasized.",

This suggestion of zoonotic spillover was quoted by international organizations, including the World Health Organization (WHO), and as a result early research focused on zoonotic rather than direct human-to-human transmission of 2019-nCoV. However, the index case had no exposure history related to the seafood market, indicating that Huanan seafood market-related zoonotic spillover may have been an overblown hypothesis. Here, we reanalyze the epidemic data of the initial cluster of cases with 2019-nCoV infections to demonstrate that the epidemic curve is consistent with substantial human-to-human transmission in December 2019.",

First, Figure 1A shows the epidemic curve of cases in Wuhan, distinguishing case generations by color. The index case developed symptoms on 1 December 2019, with cases 2-4 having onset nine days later, and cases 5-6 five days after that. Together, these intervals indicate a possible serial interval (SI)-the time between illness onset in an earlier case to that in a secondary case-with a mean of 7.4 days, consistent with the mean SI of severe acute respiratory syndrome [2] . The latter is also consistent with the mean SI estimate of 7.5 days presented in the preliminary epidemiological study [3] .",
