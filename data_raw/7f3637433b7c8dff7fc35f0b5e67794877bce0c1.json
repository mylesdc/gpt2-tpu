In an effort to develop novel C. botulinum immunotherapeutics, camelid single-domain antibodies (sdAbs, VHHs, or nanobodies) could be used due to their unique structure and characteristics. In this study, VHHs were produced using phage display technology. A total of 15 different monoclonal VHHs were selected based on their comlementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) sequences. Different toxin lethal dose (LD 50 ) challenges with each selected phage clone were conducted in vivo to check their neutralizing potency. We demonstrated that modification of neutralizing VHHs with a human immunoglobulin G (IgG)1 Fc (fragment crystallizable) fragment (fusionbody, VHH-Fc) significantly increased the circulation time in the blood (up to 14 days). At the same time, VHH-Fc showed the protective activity 1000 times higher than monomeric form when challenged with 5 LD 50 . Moreover, VHH-Fcs remained protective even 14 days after antibody administration. These results indicate that this VHH-Fc could be used as an effective long term antitoxin protection against botulinum type A.",

Inhalation botulism does not occur naturally and may occur in the context of a bioterrorist attack [2, 5] . Among the four major human pathogenic BoNTs (BoNT/A, B, E, and F), BoNT/A poses the most serious challenge for medical treatment due to its extremely high potency and extraordinary persistence in human patients [6] . According to the World Health Organization [7] , an antitoxin, usually based on equine antitoxin, should be administered as soon as the diagnosis is made. However, side effects, such as allergic reactions, fever serum sickness, and anaphylactic shock, often occur. In the past, at-risk persons and populations have been vaccinated with a chemically inactivated penta-serotype BoNT/A-E toxoid [8] ; however, its use has been discontinued due to declining potency [9] . In other affected individuals, botulism treatment is mainly supportive, with mechanical ventilation being the only effective life-saving treatment [10, 11] .",

            "text": "A good alternative to antitoxin serum with minimal or no side effects is treatment with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to BoNT, which can be prduced in vitro. Along with conventional antibodies, single-domain antibodies (sdAb), also referred to as VHHs (variable domains of heavy-chain only stibodies) or nanobodies, have been widely used since their discovery in camelids along with classical immunoglobulins (IgG) [12] [13] [14] . The absence of light chains in IgG and a lack of constant domain 1 (CH1) in the heavy chain are the key characteristics of heavy-chain antibodies (HC-Abs). Therefore, an antigen-binding site of HC-Abs is formed only by a single domain, which is linked directly via a hinge region to the Fc (fragment crystallizable) domain. HC-Abs recognize the antigen with only one special variable domain, referred to as VHH. The structure of the VHH domain resembles the VH IgG domain [15] . The complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) of these HC-Abs possesses the extraordinary capacity to form long finger-like extensions, which can extend into cavities on antigens, as the CDR3 is often much longer than that of conventional VH domains [16, 17] . Despite their small size (~15 kDa), sdAbs maintain affinities and antigen-binding specificities comparable to those of full-size mAbs [18] . Clear advantages include the ability to recognize hidden antigenic sites that are inaccessible for conventional antibodies due to their structure; stability over a wide range of temperatures and pH; high solubility, as well as economical and facile expression and production in large quantities in microorganisms [15, 17] . Several studies were conducted to test the potency of VHHs as inhibitors of viral infections [18] and different toxins, produced by such plants and microorganisms as Ricinus communis [19] , Mycoplasma hominis [20] , Clostridium tetani [21] , Clostridium difficile [22] , Crotalus durissus terrificus [23] , and Shiga toxigenic Escherichia coli (STEC) [24] . It has been demonstrated that the antigen-binding region of VHHs produced by camelids showed strong anti-BoNT activities in animal models [25, 26] . Due to their unique features and high efficacy, sdAbs are currently in clinical phase trials for the treatment of a wide range of diseases, including cancer, inflammation, hematology, and respiratory diseases [27] . For instance, Cablivi is a nanobody-based medicine, which has recently been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (aTTP) treatment [28] .",

In vitro studies and stem cell transplantation research has demonstrated that the half-life of these VHHs could be extended to several weeks with retained functionality [32] . The VHH could also be fused to the fragment crystallizable (Fc) region of an IgG. Such modifications, termed fusionbodies, increase the total protein complex size, as well as VHH-Fc interaction with neonatal Fc-receptor (FcRn), making it impossible to clear by the renal filtration system [30] .

One construction was a dimer form of each clone (B11-dimer and G3-dimer) held by a glycine-serine linker (Gly4Ser) 3 and expressed in the pET30 plasmid. The second construction was a monomer of each clone linked to a human IgG Fc fragment (B11-Fc and G3-Fc) (Figure 4a ). Fc-modifications have been used to increase the antibody circulation time in blood. Human Fc-fragments cross-react with murine Fc-receptors and are capable of binding mouse FcRn [35, 36] . Human Fc was chosen for these constructions to be used in further research and clinics. The dimers were produced and purified from the bacterial periplasmic fraction and verified by SDS-PAGE to be~30 kDa. VHHs fused with Fc fragments were produced in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-S) cells and verified by SDS-PAGE to be~40 kDa under reducing conditions (Figure 4b ). To determine the polypeptide chain of the toxin that bound specific antibodies, it was denatured by DTT into its HC and LC. SDS-PAGE was performed in denaturing conditions followed by western blot. B11-Fc and G3-Fc clones were tested, and anti-human IgG (Fc-specific)-peroxidase antibodies (1:2500) were used as detection reagents ( Figure 4c ). These antibodies were associated with the HC (100 kDa) of the toxin, which corresponds to the receptor domain. An immunoblot with BoNT/A and BoNT/A-DTT (under reducing conditions) were performed as control (Figure 4d ). We investigated the affinity of clones B11 and G3 via surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Amine coupling was used to immobilize BoNT/A and BoNT/A-DTT on the sensor chip.

Monomers had only partial protectiveness even at the highest amount, 100 \u00b5g, with protectiveness gradually decreasing and failing at 10 \u00b5g. The dimers showed a better result on average, with full protectiveness of the B11-dimer at 100 \u00b5g and partial protectiveness at lower amounts, failing at 1 \u00b5g, as well as partial protectiveness of the G3-dimer at 100-20 \u00b5g amounts, failing at 10 \u00b5g. The best results were demonstrated by VHHs fused with Fc fragments, with G3-Fc failing to fully protect the mice at 0.1 \u00b5g and B11-Fc protecting the mice at amounts as low as 0.001 \u00b5g.

In particular, it has been shown that HC-only antibodies or VHHs derived from HC-only antibodies, produced by camelids demonstrate strong anti-BoNT activities in animal models [6, 43, 44] . The main differences of VHHs from conventional antibodies include specific conserved amino acid substitutions in framework region 2 (FR2) that make contact with the LC of classical antibodies, as well as a longer length, more variable amino acid composition in the CDR3s, and a folded back loop [27, 45, 46] . Specific VHHs can be isolated from VHH libraries. One type of such libraries-immune libraries-can be produced based on peripheral blood lymphocytes isolated from camelids that have been immunized with an antigen of interest in a prime-boost strategy [47] . In our study, we used a toxoid consisting of BoNT/A toxin and small amounts of hemagglutinin (HA) as an antigen and screened for VHHs against BoNT/A and BoNT/A-DTT using phage display technology.",

However, there were fewer of them, so a greater number of clones had to be analyzed. Overall, approximately 300 clones from BoNT/A-DTT and more than 1000 clones from BoNT/A libraries were examined. The approach of splitting the toxin into its HC and LC enriches the neutralizing clones in the library. Based on their neutralizing activity when pre-mixed with different toxin LD 50 doses, two clones were selected. Interestingly, all clones with neutralizing potency did not have the highest ELISA signals. Therefore, the OD (optical density) of the ELISA signal does not always mean high neutralizing activity and in vivo protective activity of these VHHs. The next step was to produce and purify VHHs in protein form to test their neutralizing potency in vivo. However, their protection was weak. Even when pre-mixing a 100 \u00b5g dose of these VHHs with the toxin, they had a 50-75% protection efficiency. Administration of lower doses of the preparation was non-protective, with 10 \u00b5g lacking effectiveness. Therefore, two clones-B11 and G3-were modified to increase their half-life and protection efficacy. Increasing the VHH size by oligomerization-the coupling of two or more VHHs via a specific linker-increased their protectiveness; however, even bivalent constructs were rapidly cleared [46] .",

Constructs with fused Fc fragments were previously made to extend the antibody half-life to neutralize the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [48, 49] , target the C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) to prevent human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) strain entry and replication in vitro [50] , and increase the Fc effector functions to neutralize rotavirus [51] as well as the influenza virus HA [52] . A recent study of modified VHHs dimers and VHHs fused to Fcs targeting unique epitopes on the immunogen, composed of a portion of the central delivery domain and the entire combined repetitive oligopeptides (CROPs) domain of Clostridium difficile type B, showed modest and much greater toxin inhibitions, respectively [53] . It should be noted that a combined approach for efficient serum clearance of BoNT/A has been developed before. Sepulveda et al. [54] used single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) as protein binding agents pre-complexed with one or two single anti-tag mAbs with an Fc domain and tested this construction in vivo for protection and pharmacokinetics. When three or four types of such constructions were given simultaneously, mice were protected at high LD 50 s, and BoNT/A was rapidly cleared from the sera. Protection against BoNT/A light chain was observed when scFvs fused with Fc fragments (scFv-Fc) obtained from a macaque immune library were tested ex vivo [55] . Furthermore, the substantial contribution of the homologous Fc fragment to the potency of three individual anti-botulinum mAbs in antibody preparations has been demonstrated [56] .",

Toxins were prepared and purified as follows. The strain was cultivated under anaerobic conditions for five days. Bacterial cells were separated by centrifugation at 5000\u00d7 g for 30 min at 10 \u2022 C. The proteins from the culture filtrate were concentrated by acid precipitation at pH = 3.8 for 45 min. The precipitate was separated by centrifugation at 12,000\u00d7 g for 30 min at 10 \u2022 C and dissolved in 47 mM citrate-phosphate buffer with pH = 5.6. Gel filtration S300 and ion-exchange chromatography on AKTA start chromatography system (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences AB, Uppsala, Sweden) on DE cellulose (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) were then carried out. The toxin (90-95%, 150 kDa) was purified by additional DE cellulose chromatography (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) in borate buffer pH = 8 and eluted by 50 mM NaCl. Non-sorbed material containing specific antigenic and biological activity was used as BoNT complex with HA. The specific antigenic activity was a positive reaction with monospecific antibodies to BoNT/A, HA, and NTNHA (Gamaleya Laboratory of Clostridiosis and commercial preparation of Scientific Centre for Expert Evaluation of Medicinal Products Russian Federation).",

All mice received one intraperitoneal 500 \u00b5L injection of phages or proteins premixed with various LD 50 s of the toxin and were observed once a day for one week. A specific pathological pattern was observed in sick mice, which is the pathological pattern with dystonia's abdominal muscles (waistline increasing) and death at 30-50 pg that is neutralized by monospecific antibodies to BoNT/A.
