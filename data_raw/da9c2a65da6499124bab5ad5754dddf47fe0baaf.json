            "text": "The Integrated Microbial Genome/Virus (IMG/VR) system v.2.0 (https://img.jgi.doe.gov/vr/) is the largest publicly available data management and analysis platform dedicated to viral genomics. Since the last report published in the 2016, NAR Database Issue, the data has tripled in size and currently contains genomes of 8389 cultivated reference viruses, 12 498 previously published curated prophages derived from cultivated microbial isolates, and 735 112 viral genomic fragments computationally predicted from assembled shotgun metagenomes. Nearly 60% of the viral genomes and genome fragments are clustered into 110 384 viral Operational Taxonomic Units (vOTUs) with two or more members. To improve data quality and predictions of host specificity, IMG/VR v.2.0 now separates prokaryotic and eukaryotic viruses, utilizes known prophage sequences to improve taxonomic assignments, and provides viral genome quality scores based on the estimated genome completeness. New features also include enhanced BLAST search capabilities for external queries. Finally, geographic map visualization to locate user-selected viral genomes or genome fragments has been implemented and download options have been extended. All of these features make IMG/VR v.2.0 a key resource for the study of viruses.",

For each VPF, a score value (between 0 and 1) was obtained dividing the total number of hits with a uniform distribution (only present in a single host domain) by the total number of VPF hits [i.e. score = (#uniform hits/#total hits)]. In the cases where the total number of hits was below the average number of hits, we corrected the score as follows: [(#uniform hits/#total hits) \u00d7 (#total hits/average #hits)].",

The presence of these VPFs across the UViGs allowed us to separate 65% of the viral genomes into prokaryotic (bacteriophages and archaeal viruses), or eukaryotic viruses. This approach has been benchmarked using the host assignment of the viral genomes containing pVOGs (13) with homology to our 1.0-score VPFs (2,037 pVOGs) with \u226595% homology based on hhsearch (14) . Our classification was consistent with the classification in the pVOG database in all 98.6% of the cases. The remaining 1.4% resulted in viruses annotated as 'archaea-bacteria' viruses in the pVOG database that were identified as either bacteria or archaea using our approach. Thus, we can estimate that there was a 100% consistency of this method separating prokaryotic and eukaryotic viruses.",

VOG-based affiliations required \u22652 consistent VOG markers except for NCLDV where \u22655 markers were required, and for ssDNA and RNA viruses for which one marker was required. Alternatively, circular contigs were affiliated to genus-level groups including Viral RefSeq genomes using vContact2 (https://bitbucket. org/MAVERICLab/vcontact2) (15) . For circular contigs grouped with isolated reference genomes, contigs with a length <80% of the minimum reference size of the group were considered as a false positive. For circular contigs in genus-level groups without any isolate, any circular contig with a length <80% of the maximum linear contig in the group was considered as a false positive. In addition, all circular contigs <10 kb and without any marker gene affiliation to a ssDNA or RNA virus genome were considered as false positives, as they likely originate from dsDNA virus genomes. Overall, 4166 circular contigs were considered as false-positive, and were analyzed as linear contigs for the purpose of completeness estimation (see below).",

To help users separate complete and nearcomplete viral genomes from short fragments, we applied a genome completeness estimation method to classify vi-ral sequences by genome quality according to community proposed standards (Roux et al., in press, Nature Biotech). Briefly, circular contigs are considered putative complete genomes, with spurious matches removed based on their comparison to the closest isolate reference genome. Linear contigs are first clustered along with circular contigs and isolate reference genomes into genus-level groups. If the sizes of complete genomes from a genus-level group are consistent, the average size of these complete genomes is used as a 'predicted genome size' for all linear contigs in this group. In total, IMG/VR contains 11 220 finished isolate virus genomes (iVGs), with an additional 14 644 circular UViG contigs identified as likely complete genomes. A total of 15 505 linear contigs were classified as 'high-quality draft genomes' based on their estimated completeness of \u226590%, while the remaining 719 084 linear contigs were classified as 'genome fragments' due to their low completeness (n = 188 377) or lack of predicted genome size (n = 522 731) ( Figure 2 ). Although this classification is based entirely on in silico predictions and would require in vitro experiments and/or isolation of the virus to ascertain genome completeness, this information is still valuable for users who want to focus their research on complete or near-complete predicted viral genomes.",

Since the initial release, the IMG/VR content has tripled in size with over 755 000 viral genomes and genome fragments. Considering the number of newly identified UViGs and the growth of vOTUs, we project that the number of viral sequences hosted in IMG/VR will continue to grow superlinearly. We anticipate that this increase over time, however, will not affect the database infrastructure nor the system capabilities, since it only represents a small fraction of the original IMG/M total data. In this release, we have updated and added a number of features that expand the functionality of the resource. First, IMG/VR v.2.0 now adheres to community-accepted standards and best practices to characterize genome sequences from uncultivated viruses, including terminology (e.g. UViGs, vOTUs) and genome clustering methodology. Second, we have improved the virushost predictions through the addition of curated prophage sequences to the clustering step and expanded the microbial CRISPR spacer database by 35%. In addition, we have classified 65% of the sequences into prokaryotic or eukaryotic viruses. Third, we have estimated the quality of the UViGs based on their predicted genome completeness. Fourth, we provide visualization in Google Maps of the sample(s) location from which we select virus genomes or genome fragments. And fifth, we enhanced the blast capabilities to query external data (now able to query viral proteins and metagenomic spacers).",

Moreover, most NucleoCytoplasmic Large DNA Viruses (NCLDVs) are also filtered out by our current pipeline due to their high number of metabolic genes (30) and the lack of reference genomes when the VPFs were originated. Other virus groups such as virophages are also difficult to identify due to their clear underrepresentation in the databases (31) .
