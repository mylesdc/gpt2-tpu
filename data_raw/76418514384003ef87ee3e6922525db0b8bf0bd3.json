Therefore, development of effective prophylactic vaccine needs to be urgently explored given that there are no approved prophylactics or therapeutics for humans or animals to date. Different vaccine candidates have been investigated but serious safety concerns remain over protein or full-length spike (S) protein-based vaccines. Here, we investigated the immunogenicity of naked DNA vaccines expressing different fragments of MERS-CoV S protein in mice. We found that plasmids expressing full-length (pS) or S1-subunit (pS1) could induce significant levels of S1-specific antibodies (Abs) but with distinct IgG isotype patterns. Specifically, pS1 immunization elicited a balanced Th1/Th2 response and generally higher levels of all IgG isotypes compared to pS vaccination. Interestingly, only mice immunized with pS1 demonstrated significant S1specific cellular immune response. Importantly, both constructs induced cross-neutralizing Abs against multiple strains of human and camel origins. These results indicate that vaccines expressing S1-subunit of the MERS-CoV S protein could represent a potential vaccine candidate without the possible safety concerns associated with full-length protein-based vaccines.",

Saudi Arabia has reported the largest number of cases so far with cases continuing to increase. The virus causes severe respiratory infection associated with fever, cough, acute pneumonia, shortness of breath, systemic infection and occasional multi-organ failure in infected individuals leading to death in 35-40% of the cases 2-4 . Such a severe disease usually occurs in immunocompromised patients, individuals with comorbidities and the elderly 1,4-6 . Most of the reported MERS cases are linked to hospital outbreaks and family clusters due to close contact with infected patients 4,7-10 . However, accumulating epidemiological data show high prevalence of MERS-CoV in dromedary camels from several Arabian and African countries, suggesting that dromedaries might be the reservoir hosts of this virus 4,11-15 . The continued endemicity of MERS-CoV in the Arabian Peninsula and the associated high death rate clearly represent a public health concern with potential global spread as observed in the recent outbreak in South Korea 10 . This is further complicated by the lack of prophylactic or therapeutic measures, underscoring the importance of preparedness research against this potential pandemic virus.",

The ideal strategy to rapidly control existing and potential outbreaks of MERS-CoV is to generate a safe and effective vaccine at least to target high-risk groups or animal hosts. The ability of more than 60% of the infected patients to recover, clear the virus and develop immunity suggest that a vaccine based on the viral components such as the spike (S) glycoprotein could be a suitable vaccine candidate. This is further supported by the isolation of several human neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) against the MERS-CoV S protein and their ability to neutralize and block viral entry and/or cell-cell spread at very low concentrations, and sometimes to confer prophylactic and therapeutic protection in animal models [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] .",

MERS-CoV viruses were isolated, passaged and titrated by TCID 50 in Vero E6 cells as previously described 49 . All tested isolates were at passage no. 2. All experiments involving live virus were conducted in our Biosafety level 3 facility following the recommended safety precautions and measures. DNA constructs. Four DNA vaccine candidates were generated as shown in Fig. 1a . Full length MERS-CoV S gene from MERS-CoV-Jeddah-human-1 isolate (GenBank accession number: KF958702) was codon optimized for efficient mammalian expression and synthesized by Bio S & T (Montreal, Canada).

As expected, empty vector control (pcDNA) and pS\u2206 TM failed to produce any anti-S1 IgG isotype. On the other hand, plasmid DNA expressing S1 subunit (pS1) induced a balanced Th1/Th2 response (IgG2a/IgG1 ratio of ~1.0) with S1-specific Abs from all isotypes. While IgG2a and IgG2b levels induced by pS1 were significantly higher compared to pS\u2206 TM and empty vector control (pcDNA), no significant difference was observed in the levels of these two isotypes between pS and pS1-vaccinated groups. In contrast, level of S1-specific IgG1 Abs elicited by pS1 vaccine was significantly elevated compared to all groups including pS group. Collectively, compared with the full length S protein, these data suggest that S1 subunit delivered by DNA vector elicited stronger antibody responses and equal ratio of IgG2a/IgG1 whereas the full length S protein induced a Th1-skewed immune response.",

Most of these experimental vaccines were based on MERS-CoV full-length or truncated versions of the spike protein; these prototype vaccines were found to have induced high levels of nAbs and sometimes conferred protection against MERS-CoV challenge in several animal models. However, several previous SARS-CoV vaccine studies have also shown that there might be some safety concerns associated with the use of WIV 43 , truncated S subunit/protein vaccines 44 or vectored vaccines expressing full-length S protein 45 . These concerns included inflammatory and immunopathological effects such as eosinophilic infiltration of the lungs as well as Ab-mediated disease enhancement (ADE) in immunized animals upon viral challenge. It is believed that induction of Th2-polarized immune response and/or non-neutralizing Abs against epitopes within the S protein (i.e. outside the neutralizing-epitope rich RBD or S1 subunit) are the reason for the observed immunopathology and disease enhancement in vaccinated animals [46] [47] [48] , suggesting that use of S1 subunit over full-length S protein could be a safer option for vaccine development.",

Up to date, only two studies have investigated MERS-CoV DNA vaccines by utilizing full-length S protein, which is the primary target of immune response in the host. To dissect the antigenic domains of the S protein, we examined the immunogenicity of naked DNA vaccines expressing several versions of MERS-CoV S protein in mice. We found that pS-immunized group elicited significant IgG2a and IgG2b titers (Th1-skewed response) with very subtle S1-specific CD8 + IFN-\u03b3 response. On the other hand, pS1-immunization generated markedly increased levels of all IgG isotypes in a balanced Th1/Th2 response along with low but significantly elevated CD8 + IFN-\u03b3 response compared to pS group. While further animal studies are required to determine whether induction of balanced Th1/Th2 or Th1-biased immune response could aid in the development of safer MERS-CoV vaccine, S1-based vaccines could be a safer option compared to the full-length S-based vaccines.",

In addition, the observation that both pS1 and pS induced similar nAb titers (Fig. 4) suggests that full-length S protein harbors neutralizing epitopes outside the S1 region as previously reported 29 . The induction of high levels of IgG1 by pS1 vaccine and consequent balanced Th1/Th2 response could probably be explained by the secretion of S1 subunit especially that this immunogen contains the signal peptide without the cell membrane anchoring domains compared to pS vaccine. While additional studies are required to confirm this, we have previously shown that internal viral proteins such as the influenza nucleoprotein could be partially secreted and alter the immune response phenotype when fused to a secretion signal 50 . Furthermore, the weak or undetectable response in pS\u2206 TM and pS\u2206 CD immunized mice is noteworthy especially that Wang et al., showed that MERS-CoV DNA vaccine expressing S\u2206 TM induced limited response in mice even after electroporation 29 . Although this response could be due to misfolded protein and rapid degradation of the antigen, or low expression level of these truncated spike proteins given that expression of S\u2206 TM gave low production yields from transfected HEK 293 as previously described 29 , similar vaccines have been shown to be very effective in mice in the case of SARS-CoV 52 .",

Furthermore, several other studies have used pseudovirus neutralization assay to test contemporary strains which may not replicate the actual neutralization breadth against live viruses 29, 30 . It is of note that the similar levels of nAb titers in both pS and pS1 groups reported here appear to be different from the observation by others, who found significantly higher levels of nAbs induced by a DNA vaccine expressing full-length S protein compared to that expressing S1 protein 29 .
