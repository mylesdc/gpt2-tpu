MERS-CoV has not been identified previously among humans 4 , thus knowledge about the natural history of the disease is still limited. The clinical syndrome of MERS-CoV is primarily a respiratory disease including fever, cough and shortness of breath, resembling SARS. More than half of cases develop life threatening complications, such as respiratory failure 5,6 , acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) 6-8 , renal failure [4] [5] [6] 8 , and consumptive coagulopathy 8 . Studies of clusters of cases suggest that the spread may occur by both large and small aerosols and possibly via the faecal-oral route 9 . The pathogenesis of MERS-CoV is not fully understood. It appears to cause respiratory problems by attacking and infecting the cells in the nasopharynx; laboratory studies show that the virus has the ability to cause profound apoptosis of human bronchial epithelial cells 10 . All confirmed cases have had respiratory disease and most have developed pneumonia 11 . Complications during the course of illness have included severe pneumonia with respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilations, ARDS with multi-organ failure, renal failure requiring dialysis, consumptive coagulopathy and pericarditis 11 . Hitherto, 45 out of 81 cases (55%) have died as a result of infection (Table 1) . The rapid transmission and high attack rate in hospital settings have raised concerns about the risk of health care associated transmission of this virus 12 .",

A recent study has shown evidence of rapid acquisition of respiratory viruses among pilgrims during their stay during the Hajj in the KSA, most notably rhinovirus 14, 15 . The authors highlight the potential of spreading these infections in the pilgrims' home countries upon their return. Memish and colleagues also suggest a 'high degree of clinical vigilance' required for the possibility of MERS-CoV infection in patients with respiratory infections who have visited the Middle East in the preceding 10 days 6 . Despite these concerns, the WHO does not recommend changing travel plans for Hajj or Umrah because of MERS-CoV. However, at a recent meeting organized by the WHO in Cairo (June, 2013), public health officials specifically emphasized the importance of preparedness and response at Hajj and contexts of mass gatherings 'as a priority action', with Member States of WHO agreeing to develop specific plans for MERS-CoV 16 . No emphasis at this meeting or in peer-reviewed literature has been made in relation to the large volumes and frequent travel patterns of international labor migrant workers to the Middle Eastern countries, especially from Asia 17 .",

Estimates of total migrant workers by the International Labor Organization for 2010 were 105.5 million, 30 million of which were from within Asia 19 . It is estimated that there is a net annual outflow of two million migrant workers from the 'top five' South Asian labor sending countries of Sri Lanka, India, Bangladesh, Nepal and Pakistan 20 ( Table 2) . Unregistered 'irregular' migrant workers also contribute to this outflow of contractual workers from Asia, although estimates are difficult to assess due to the clandestine nature of their travel. It is important to highlight that remittance from labor migrants contribute significantly to the economic growth of most developing countries in Asia. The Sri Lankan economy is highly dependent on foreign exchange earnings from its migrant workforce, with remittance from workers in Middle Eastern countries alone contributing 58.9% of all total foreign exchange earned in 2011 21 .

Health authorities in some countries in the region have already begun making advanced arrangements for the diagnostic test kits developed by the CDC for MERS-CoV to be made available to National Reference Laboratories 16 . Ensuring guidance for health care professionals regarding case definition, diagnosis and management for MERS-CoV infection, and establishing an active surveillance system for 'influenza-like' illnesses in hospitals are essential steps for surveillance. Elaborating pandemic preparedness and response measures are not the focus of this current paper since these have already been well described and indeed established in Sri Lanka through previous efforts against SARS and H1N1 22 . Rather, this article will focus on understanding the importance of the large volumes of migration categories and their dynamics, which may yield more specific and targeted public health and screening interventions for MERS-CoV.",

B. Strategies at the 'destination' phase. Sri Lankan embassies and diplomatic missions at destination countries could disseminate public health service messages in relation to MERS-CoV in Singhalese/Tamil languages via embassy welfare programs, social networks and through ethno-specific radio programs. It is vital that local health authorities and employers provide access for migrant workers to seek primary health care and that they are supported with specialized/referral care within the health system in the Gulf States. The importance of health accessibility, irrespective of visa status, for migrant workers to primary and specialized health care facilities in these destination countries also needs to be emphasized through state-to-state and regional advocacy mechanisms. It is recommended that public health authorities and global bodies such as the WHO and the International Organization for Migration utilize the support of existing inter-regional and trans-national migrant worker networks such as the members of the 'Colombo process' and 'Abu-Dhabi process' in order to promote effective public health messages and strategies 31 .",

Currently there are no medical personnel attached to the SLFBE services for on-arrival phase. It is recommended that the Ministry of Health make arrangements to establish a coordination mechanism with the SLFBE and with airport health authorities, which currently have no linkage to migrant worker programs. A rotating roster of trained health professionals allocated at the health center at the airport could ensure each returning worker completes the rapid symptom checklist (see assessment algorithm in Figure 3 ). The algorithm was developed after augmenting the guidance frameworks for MERS-CoV created by the public health authorities in Canada 29 and the CDC 32 . It is important for port health authorities to also build effective partnerships and protocols with immigration control officers at 'on arrival counters'. This will ensure referral of travelers returning from the Middle East where cases of MERS-CoV have been reported to the health screening desk. Leaflets advising travelers of symptoms of the influenza-like illness could also be distributed at the immigration counter to arriving passengers.",

Studies have shown that when responding to a novel infectious disease outbreak, policy and planning decisions can limit the ability to control the outbreak and result in unintended consequences including lack of public confidence 33 . Communication of risk to target populations needs to be carefully planned to avert maladaptive behaviors due to fear and defensive avoidance (the motivated resistance to the message, such as denial or minimization of the threat 34 ). Individuals may defensively avoid a message by being inattentive to the communication (e.g., looking away from the message), or by suppressing any thoughts about the threat over the long term. Mitigating such threats through targeted communication strategies to migrant workers and other categories such as those described above may be useful 35 .

For example, \"the extremely high\" mortality rate they cite has been falling as more cases are identified and will likely continue along this trend as milder cases are discovered. Claims of \"rapid transmission\" and a \"high attack rate\" are made without any epidemiologic basis or support from literature. Throughout the commentary, the authors also make redundant, disorganized, and extra-contextual statements about MERS clinical features, labor sending/receiving nations, the Hajj pilgrimage, and strategies for controlling a potential MERS epidemic. The only way this manuscript can be salvaged is if it is refashioned as a brief communication of no more than a few hundred words with one figure or table. The manuscript should be narrowly focused on migrant workers between Gulf States and Southeast Asia and the threat they may pose to the spread of the virus. The additional commentary on screening and surveillance adds nothing to the existing WHO report and essentially boils down to education, awareness, and appropriate referral. The following are specific points of concern: Instead of presenting the number of cases and deaths in each country in tabular format, the authors should provide a link to WHO's running tally as the authors numbers will be (as they are now) inaccurate and out-of-date.",
