            "text": "Ebola virus (EBOV) infection can cause severe and frequently fatal disease in human patients. The EBOV glycoprotein (GP) mediates viral entry into host cells. For this, GP depends on priming by the pH-dependent endolysosomal cysteine proteases cathepsin B (CatB) and, to a lesser degree, cathepsin L (CatL), at least in most cell culture systems. However, there is limited information on whether and how EBOV-GP can acquire resistance to CatB/L inhibitors. Here, we addressed this question using replication-competent vesicular stomatitis virus bearing EBOV-GP. Five passages of this virus in the presence of the CatB/CatL inhibitor MDL28170 were sufficient to select resistant viral variants and sequencing revealed that all GP sequences contained a V37A mutation, which, in the context of native GP, is located in the base of the GP surface unit. In addition, some GP sequences harbored mutation S195R in the receptor-binding domain. Finally, mutational analysis demonstrated that V37A but not S195R conferred resistance against MDL28170 and other CatB/CatL inhibitors. Collectively, a single amino acid substitution in GP is sufficient to confer resistance against CatB/CatL inhibitors, suggesting that usage of CatB/CatL inhibitors for antiviral therapy may rapidly select for resistant viral variants. envelope with the limiting membrane of endolysosomes [12] , allowing delivery of the viral genome into the host cell cytoplasm. Binding and membrane fusion are carried out by different subunits of GP. The N-terminal surface unit, GP1, binds to host cell receptors via a receptor-binding domain (RBD), while the C-terminal transmembrane unit, GP2, harbors the functional elements required for membrane fusion, including a fusion peptide and heptad repeats [10] . Although GP1 can bind to attachment factors on the cell surface [13, 14] , only the interaction with the intracellular receptor Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) within host cell endolysosomes is essential for EBOV entry [13] [14] [15] [16] . This interaction critically depends on previous processing of EBOV-GP by the endolysosomal, pH-dependent cysteine proteases cathepsin B (CatB) and cathepsin L (CatL) [15] [16] [17] [18] . Processing removes a glycan cap and a mucin-like domain (MLD) from GP1 and results in a primed form of GP. Primed GP still contains the RBD linked to GP2 via a disulfide bond [19, 20] and can fuse the viral membrane with an endolysosomal membrane upon receipt of a trigger. However, the nature of this trigger remains to be identified [21] [22] [23] [24] .",

A previous study employed a replication-competent VSV chimera bearing EBOV-GP without MLD (VSV-EBOV) to examine resistance development against the CatB inhibitor CA074 [29] . Resistance development was observed after two passages and was due to acquisition of single amino acid substitutions at the GP1-GP2 interface which increased susceptibility of the mutant GP to processing by host cell proteases [29] . In contrast, resistance development in the context of full-length EBOV-GP and other CatB/CatL inhibitors has not been examined.",

This threat is compounded by recent findings demonstrating that EBOV can persist in convalescent patients who can relapse even months after having recovered from EVD and may transmit the virus to others [4] [5] [6] [7] . At present, neither vaccines nor therapeutics have been approved by regulatory agencies for use in humans, although clinical trials indicate that a vaccine based on replication-competent vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) bearing the EBOV glycoprotein (GP) can efficiently protect against EVD [8, 9] .

            "text": "In order to study resistance development against CatB/CatL inhibitors, we used a VSV-EBOV chimeric virus encoding firefly luciferase and eGFP ( Figure 1A ) and examined inhibition by the CatB and/or CatL inhibitors MDL28170, CA-074, and CatL inhibitor III. CA-074 is largely specific for CatB while MDL28170 and CatL inhibitor III inhibit both CatB and CatL [26, 30, 31] . Vero E6 cells were chosen for experimentation since this cell line allows for efficient replication of EBOV and has previously been used to study inhibition of EBOV-GP-driven entry by CatB/CatL inhibitors and the development of viral resistance against these inhibitors [17, 29, 32, 33] . Preincubation of Vero E6 cells with these inhibitors followed by infection with VSV-EBOV universally resulted in efficient and dose-dependent inhibition of infection, with IC50 values of 1.3 \u00b5M (CatL inhibitor III), 2.2 \u00b5M (MDL28170), 16.1 \u00b5M (CA-074) ( Figure 1B) . Moreover, MDL28170 and CatL inhibitor III reduced VSV-EBOV infection to background levels when applied at 10 \u00b5M without eliciting unwanted cytotoxicity ( Figure 1B,C) . In contrast, 20 \u00b5M of CA-074 reduced VSV-EBOV infection by only 70% and caused measurable cytotoxic effects, although it should be stated that VSV infection was not affected at this concentration ( Figure 1B,C) . The lack of unspecific VSV inhibition despite measureable cytotoxicity might result from differences between incubation periods: Infection efficiency was measured at 18 h after addition of compound while cytotoxicity was measured at 24 h after addition of compound. In sum, we defined experimental conditions under which EBOV-GP-but not VSV-G-driven entry was blocked by CatB/CatL inhibitors in a concentration-dependent manner. MDL28170 was selected for further analysis because this compound caused a dose-dependent inhibition of VSV-EBOV over a broader range of concentrations (1.25-40 \u00b5M) than CA-074 (10-80 \u00b5M) or CatL inhibitor III (1.25-10 \u00b5M), while it did not have any non-specific side-effects on cell viability and infectivity of VSV up to a concentration of 40 \u00b5M. In order to determine how EBOV-GP can acquire resistance against MDL28170 the experimental setup depicted in Figure 2 was chosen. First, VSV-EBOV was passaged 5 times in Vero E6 cells in the presence of 20 \u00b5M MDL28170, the concentration that reduced VSV-EBOV infection by~99.5% without causing unwanted cytotoxic effects. Then, MDL28170 sensitivity of passaged and control virus was analyzed and the GP sequences were determined ( Figure 2 ).",

The mutations selected in GP1 resulted in amino acid substitutions at positions 40, 42, 43, or 47 at the N-terminus of EBOV-GP [29] . In the context of the properly folded mature protein, the region containing these amino acid residues is located in the GP1 base, which interacts with GP2 [40] . Moreover, some of these amino acid substitutions increased the efficiency of proteolytic processing of precleaved GP and rendered particles bearing precleaved GP more susceptible to inactivation by proteolytic digestion [29] . Consequently, it has been proposed that some of the mutations conferred resistance to the CatB inhibitor by destabilizing the GP trimer, thereby rendering it more accessible to proteolytic digestion by CatB/CatL and increasing the efficiency of GP triggering [29] . In addition, it has been postulated that some mutations render GP-driven entry CatB-independent by allowing GP processing by so far unidentified endosomal cysteine proteases other than CatB [29] .",

In light of the almost identical location of this resistance mutation as compared to the ones described above [29] , it is likely that they confer resistance via similar mechanisms. Moreover, we demonstrate that resistance development occurs in the presence of an inhibitor, MDL28170, that, unlike the CatB-specific compound CA-074 used in the previous study, blocks both CatB and CatL activity [30, 31] . In this context, it should be mentioned that V37A conferred complete resistance against the largely CatB-specific inhibitor CA-074 (up to the highest concentration tested, 20 \u00b5M) but not the CatB/CatL-specific inhibitors MDL28170 and CatL inhibitor III, suggesting that the mutation might render entry CatB but not CatL independent. Thus, mutation V37A might induce changes in the EBOV-GP structure that render the CatB cleavage site also accessible for CatL or related cysteine proteases susceptible to inhibition by MDL28170 and CatL inhibitor III but not CA-074. Alternatively, V37A might destabilize GP in such a way that incomplete processing of GP by CatL and/or other proteases might be sufficient to render GP susceptible to the membrane fusion trigger.",

Moreover, they have been shown to block coronavirus spread and pathogenesis in rodent models [38] . Whether they will also block EBOV spread in the host and whether this will result in rapid emergence of resistant viruses as suggested by the present study remains to be determined.
