            "text": "Nerve growth factor (NGF) is overexpressed in patients with inflammatory lung diseases, including virus infections. Airway surface liquid (ASL), which is regulated by epithelial cell ion transport, is essential for normal lung function. No information is available regarding the effect of NGF on ion transport of airway epithelium. To investigate whether NGF can affect ion transport, human primary air-interface cultured epithelial cells were placed in Ussing chambers to obtain transepithelial voltage (\u00c07.1 AE 3.4 mV), short-circuit current (I sc , 5.9 AE 1.0 lA), and transepithelial resistance (750 O\u00c1cm 2 ), and to measure responses to ion transport inhibitors. Amiloride (apical, 3.5 9 10 \u00c05 mol/L) decreased I sc by 55.3%. Apically applied NGF (1 ng/mL) reduced I sc by 5.3% in 5 min; basolaterally applied NGF had no effect. The response to amiloride was reduced (41.6%) in the presence of NGF. K-252a (10 nmol/ L, apical) did not itself affect Na + transport, but it attenuated the NGFinduced reduction in Na + transport, indicating the participation of the trkA receptor in the NGF-induced reduction in Na + transport. PD-98059 (30 lmol/L, apical and basolateral) did not itself affect Na + transport, but attenuated the NGF-induced reduction in Na + transport, indicating that trkA activated the Erk 1/2 signaling cascade. NGF stimulated phosphorylation of Erk 1/2 and the b-subunit of ENaC. K-252a and PD-98059 inhibited these responses. NGF had no effect on I sc in the presence of apical nystatin (50 lmol/L). These results indicate that NGF inhibits Na + transport through a trkA-Erk 1/2-activated signaling pathway linked to ENaC phosphorylation.",

Although NGF was discovered in the context of nerve growth and function, it has been shown to be produced by both structural and nonstructural cells in the lung (Hoyle 2003; Frossard et al. 2004) . NGF is involved in the development of several airway diseases, such as asthma, and neurogenic inflammation (Braun et al. 1998; Nassenstein et al. 2006) . Elevated levels of NGF have been shown to cause airway hyperreactivity, enhance the airway inflammatory response in ovalbumin-sensitized mice, and cause airway remodeling (Braun et al. 1998; Freund and Frossard 2004) . Both NGF and its receptors, trkA and p75, are upregulated during respiratory syncytial virus infections (Hu et al. 2002; Tortorolo et al. 2005) . No studies have been conducted to investigate the effect of NGF on ion transport in airway epithelial cells.",

The PCL is necessary for mucociliary clearance of infectious organisms and inhaled particles (Toczylowska-Maminska and Dolowy 2012). The PCL is maintained by the coordinated action of many ion channels, pumps, and transporters (Knowles et al. 1984; Toczylowska-Maminska and Dolowy 2012) . Disruption of ion transport can contribute to airway diseases, such as mucus thickening in cystic fibrosis due to PCL dehydration, lung edema due to an inhibition of epithelial Na + channels (ENaC; Chen et al. 2004; Morty et al. 2007; Ji et al. 2009 ), and interfere with regulatory mechanisms in the airways, such as the release of epithelium-derived relaxing factor which induces relaxation of airway smooth muscle and submucosal blood vessels (Prazma et al. 1994; Fedan et al. 2004; Wu et al. 2004 ).",

The cells were cultured using B-ALI growth medium in both apical and basolateral compartments for approximately 3 days or until the cells became confluent. Once confluent, the cells were placed under ALI culture conditions, and only supported by B-ALI differentiation media containing the recommended supplements in the basolat-eral compartment.

It is possible, therefore, that NGF could affect Na + /K + -ATPase activity in addition to Na + transport. To investigate whether NGF affects Na + /K + -ATPase activity, the apical membrane was permeabilized with nystatin (50 lmol/L; apical), and responses to ouabain were obtained in the absence (Fig. 9A ) or presence (Fig. 9B ) of NGF (1 ng/mL). In the presence of nystatin, apically applied NGF had no effect on I sc , in contrast to responses of cells in the absence of nystatin (data not shown). There was no significant difference in the responses to ouabain between the vehicle control and NGF-treated groups (Control 98.4 AE 1.2%, NGF 99.7 AE 0.8%; data not shown).

NGF did not reduce the amiloride-sensitive Na + transport in cells incubated for either 24 or 48 h, which suggested at first that the reduction in Na + transport is a transient, nongenomic cellular response to NGF. We considered the possibility that the lack of a lasting effect of NGF on amiloride-sensitive Na + transport could be due to a reduction in NGF concentration during the incubation period or due to desensitization of the cells. Therefore, an ELISA specific for b-NGF was used to measure the NGF concentration in the apical solution. Transwell inserts with and without cells were incubated for 5 min, or 6, 24, and 48 h apically with either NGF (1 ng/ mL) or MKHS. After incubation, the apical solution was collected and analyzed for NGF. There were no detectable levels of endogenous NGF in any of the transwell inserts with or without cells incubated with MKHS. However, following 5-min incubation on inserts which contained cells, the NGF concentration was reduced by 93%. Transwell inserts which did not contain cells and were incubated with NGF did not reveal a reduction in NGF concentration, indicating that NGF was either metabolized by epithelial proteases or NGF was internalized into the cells with the trkA receptor, as reported previously (Saragovi et al. 1998 ).",

Furthermore, K-252a and PD-98059 inhibited NGF's effect. Apically permeabilized epithelial cells were unresponsive to NGF, and NGF was found to have no effect on the Na + /K + -AT-Pase activity. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) also has been shown to activate an Erk 1/2-mediated pathway and selectively inhibit ENaC without affecting Na + /K + -ATPase activity (Shen and Cotton 2003) . Thus, the ability of NGF to activate the Erk 1/2 signaling, as well as the possibility that NGF, acting through this second messenger pathway, could phosphorylate ENaC was investigated. Treatment with apical NGF (1 ng/mL, 5 min) resulted in a twofold Erk 1/2 activation (Fig. 11A ) and a threefold increase in b-ENaC phosphorylation (Fig. 11B ) as compared to controls. The increases in Erk 1/2 activity and b-ENaC phosphorylation were blocked by K-252a (10 nmol/L, apical) and PD-98059 (30 lmol/L, apical and basolateral; Fig. 11C ). Although there was a threefold increase in b-ENaC phosphorylation, there were no changes in total b-ENaC (Fig. 12) .

After 30-min incubation with NGF, at a time when NGF concentration in the chamber had diminished substantially, the effect of amiloride was blunted and was no longer significant.

            "text": "Although we observed a threefold increase in b-ENaC phosphorylation after a 5-min incubation with NGF, we did not observe a reduction in total b-ENaC (Fig. 12 ) over the measurement period. Falin and Cotton (2007) using MDCK cells demonstrated that EGF induced an Erk-mediated reduction in Na + transport as a result of ENaC phosphorylation, but a reduction in ENaC surface expression was not observed until after 60 min. It is possible that longer incubations with NGF (under conditions in which NGF levels might somehow be stabilized in MKHS) could reveal ENaC degradation late in the response. During diseases such RSV infections, NGF is significantly increased in the cell fraction of the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, but not in the serum (Tortorolo et al. 2005) . This increased NGF level has been attributed to increased production by the infiltrating inflammatory cells. The increased production and release of NGF by inflammatory cells would result in a continuous release of NGF and exposure of the epithelium, and, perhaps, initiate changes in ion transport by mechanisms uncovered during this investigation.",

This activation was inhibited by K-252a and PD-98059. (B) NGF-mediated activation of Erk 1/2 resulted in ENaC phosphorylation, and was inhibited with K-252a and PD-98059.
