            "text": "Organismal complexity is difficult to define and to measure, especially quantitatively. When DNA was discovered to be the material basis of inheritance in all organisms, it was thought that the DNA content of an organism should correlate with its phenotypic complexity, but soon thereafter the C-value paradox was found. C-value refers to the amount of DNA contained within a haploid nucleus, and usually equals to genome size. Salamanders and lungfishes have the largest genomes of 120pg, while the C-value of humans is only 3.5pg [1] . C-values vary enormously among species. In animals they range more than 3,300-fold. Variation in C-values bears no relationship to the complexity of the organism. The discovery of non-coding DNA in the early 1970 s resolved the C-value paradox. Although it is still unclear why some species have a remarkably higher amount of non-coding sequences than others of the same level of complexity, it was believed that the number of genes contained in the genome, rather than the genome size, correlated with the complexity of the organism. However, the human genome project and other model organism genome projects revealed that there are only about 25,000 genes in the human genome [2] , while simple organism nematode have 19,500 genes [3] and rice even has more genes than humans, 46,000~55,000 [4] . Obviously, the number of genes bears no direct relationship to phenotypic complexity. This is called Gvalue paradox.",

The study of proteomics proceeds extensively after the genome projects. However, proteins are different from nucleic acids. Many proteins are subjected to a wide variety of chemical modifications after translation. A lot of these post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, ubiquitination, methylation, acetylation, glycosylation, oxidation, nitrosylation and protein splicing, are critical to the protein functions. The modified proteins display different physical and chemical properties and biological functions from the unmodified. If a modified protein can be seen as a new protein, then the size of the proteome would be much larger than the number of genes. The number of proteins in a living organism may never be accurately counted as the number of genes, because every modified protein can only be individually studied. That is technically much more difficult because different proteins have different properties. A proteomic study can become quite complex even if the object of the study is very restricted. Therefore, it seems difficult to calculate the phenotypic complexity of an organism at least at the present time.",

The traditional mathematical notion of complexity is Kolmogorov complexity, which can be thought of as the length of the shortest message in which the given sequence can be encoded [5] . The complexity is minimal for a homopolymer, and is maximal for a random sequence, in which case complexity is equal to the sequence length. The later case means the sequence cannot be simplified at all, so is the most complex. However, Kolmogorov complexity does not correspond to our intuitive notion of biological complexity. The other complexity is to calculate the Shannon's information entropy of a sequence [5] [6] [7] [8] . The complexity is the length of the sequence subtracting the Shannon's entropy, and is actually the information content of the sequence. This kind of complexity has biological meaning. The more complex means the sequence is more conserved and therefore carries more information. However, this complexity is only the complexity of sequences, which has nothing to do with the phenotypic complexity of organisms.",

Here we take the amount of minimal information needed to construct an organism as a measure of organism phenotypic complexity because apparently more complex organisms should need more minimal information to construct and simple organisms are supposed to need less information to construct. The information to constitute DNA structure is relatively simple and less important, and we know very little about the mechanisms of evolution, so for the purpose of this article we will not be considering these areas of information. The information needed to construct organism, to put it simply, is the information needed to express proteins in time, in space, and in quantity. We actually still know very little about this information up to now. The conserved gene coding sequences are only part of the information. To calculate this information, we need to construct organism mathematically using permutation and combination formulas based on the numbers of proteins and cell types.",

Otherwise, organisms have to change the codon system when the distributions change. For evolution, it is impossible for a living organism to know the future protein sequences and the amino acid distributions across the sequences. In order to generate any unknown future sequences efficiently, living organisms need to use a mechanism that can encode any protein sequences efficiently. In fact, all organisms use a mechanism that can reduce the maximal entropy to 0, which means equal probability for all amino acids when encoding protein sequences. For the same reason, organisms may not know the distribution of bases across all nucleotide sequences, and may assume equal probability for all bases even though the actual probability distribution across some genomes may not be equal at all. For biological information, most cases are like this with maximum entropy needed to be reduced and equal probability need to be assumed by organisms, so formula I=log(N) can be used to calculate the information.",

Click the genome sequences, you can get the genome information of the organism, including number of genes, number of protein coding, percentage of coding, etc. What we need is the number of protein coding, which does not include RNA genes and pseudogenes. The size of protein coding area can be calculated as: I 1 =length %coding 2. The genomic information of all sequenced organisms can be obtained in this way. For the organisms with chromosome mapping, sometimes the statistic information of the chromosome sequences cannot be obtained directly. You have to click the mitochondria sequence first, and use the links in the results page to other genome sequences, to enter the statistic information pages of the chromosome sequences. The sizes of protein coding areas of some eukaryotes can be found in this manner, but some eukaryotes do not have percentage of coding data.The value of y is calculated by bacterium volume v multiplying 16% as the weight of proteins, and divided by protein molecule average weight q.",

            "text": "Reviewer #2: Dr. Chao ChenThe paper concludes that phenotypic complexity of life evolves in a single direction toward higher effective information measured by Shannon entropies. For instance, the effective information for the eukaryotes is calculated as sum of Shannon entropies corresponding to information needed (1) to encode all proteins, (2) to produce all he differentiated cells, and (3) to construct the spatial structure. For the three organisms (viruses, bacteria and eukaryotes) considered in the paper, the effective information is shown to be increasing in the order from virus to bacteria and to eukaryotes. What the authors had done is to use Sharron's information entropies to represent genotypic complexity on the three organisms but failed to demonstrate the relevance of this information to the evolution of phenotypic complexity. It should be noted that the scalability of genotypic complexity does not automatically lead to the scalability of phenotypic complexity that is not defined in the paper.Here are my specific comments: 1. A logical framework must be constructed so that the information on genotypic complexity as measured by Shannon's information entropies can be used to support the evolution of phenotypic complexity. This framework should be equally applicable to either the entire universe of organisms or only to a single organism such as eukaryotes. The authors may first focus on one organism and then apply the methodology to a broader subgroup of organisms if not the whole universe of organisms. An interesting work on phenotypic complexity is by Lehere and Haddow [27] in which mapping of genotypic complexity to phenotypic complexity was considered.2. In view of the comment #1 above, it is logical to consolidate all equations that are now scattering over three sections into a single section of method and/or theory. In other words, the metric on genotypic and phenotypic domains must be well defined first before any evolutionary claim could be made. Some formality on how these equations are derived should be presented. For instance, it would be more appropriate to define a1 along with a2, a3,..., acn, rather than skiping a1 and replace it by t (the averaged size of cellular proteome of differentiated cells) as shown in the section \"The calculation of effective information of eukaryotes\". While the calculated result will be the same, it is desirable to have some formality in presentation to avoid misunderstanding from readers. For instance, one may question the meaningfulness of the term (choosing t from x) when t is not an integer.3. Another loose end of the manuscript is the lack of a well-defined universe from which representative samples are taken and the inference made. The scope of organisms to be inferred must be clearly defined; otherwise, the conclusion of the paper could be predetermined simply by the choice of database and the methodology. A biologist may argue that there is always an increase in complexity if one follows the simple dictum that eggs come from preexisting eggs and multicellular organism evolves from single cell animals. Questions can then be Authors' contributions YJ proposed the ideas, conducted the calculations, and wrote the manuscript. CX directed the research and have given final approval of the version to be published.",
