Although coughing and sneezing have garnered much attention as potential, explosive sources of infectious aerosols, these are relatively rare events during daily life, whereas breathing is necessary for life and is performed continuously. Real-time shadowgraph imaging was used to visualise and capture high-speed images of healthy volunteers sneezing and breathing (through the nose -nasally, and through the mouth -orally). Six volunteers, who were able to respond to the pepper sneeze stimulus, were recruited for the sneezing experiments (2 women: 27.566.36 years; 4 men: 29.25610.53 years). The maximum visible distance over which the sneeze plumes (or puffs) travelled was 0.6 m, the maximum sneeze velocity derived from these measured distances was 4.5 m/s. The maximum 2-dimensional (2-D) area of dissemination of these sneezes was 0.2 m 2 . The corresponding derived parameter, the maximum 2-D area expansion rate of these sneezes was 2 m 2 /s. For nasal breathing, the maximum propagation distance and derived velocity were 0.6 m and 1.4 m/s, respectively. The maximum 2-D area of dissemination and derived expansion rate were 0.11 m 2 and 0.16 m 2 /s, respectively. Similarly, for mouth breathing, the maximum propagation distance and derived velocity were 0.8 m and 1.3 m/ s, respectively. The maximum 2-D area of dissemination and derived expansion rate were 0.18 m 2 and 0.17 m 2 /s, respectively. Surprisingly, a comparison of the maximum exit velocities of sneezing reported here with those obtained from coughing (published previously) demonstrated that they are relatively similar, and not extremely high. This is in contrast with some earlier estimates of sneeze velocities, and some reasons for this difference are discussed.",

Two recent studies examined the qualitative effects of sneezing in humans with and without wearing surgical and N95 masks [16, 17] , without any quantitative measurements of the sneeze airflows being attempted. One earlier, more physiological study on sneezing in premature newborns suggested that the peak expiratory airflow during sneezing was only 6-7 times higher than that during quiet breathing [18] . This ratio suggests that there may be a discrepancy with the much higher estimates of sneeze velocities reported by Wells [19] of up to 100 m/s, and 50 m/s as has been assumed in some modeling studies [20] , though these were described for much older adults.",

Gupta and colleagues performed a series of experiments to characterise the morphology and flow dynamics of nasal and mouth breathing [21] , and followed this by computer simulations of how such breath plumes might disseminate and be inhaled in a fully occupied aircraft cabin [22, 23] .

Briefly, the principle underlying shadowgraph imaging relies on light passing through air of different temperatures, which have differing refractive indices. A large, finely ground, 1-m diameter, spherical, concave, f/5 mirror of astronomical reflector telescope quality (Cosmo Optics Inc., Middletown, NY) was used to reflect a light beam produced by an LED light source placed at the mirror's centre of curvature (i.e. 10 m from the mirror) through the cooler air (18uC) of the laboratory and the warmer (30-33uC) exhaled air produced by healthy volunteers, to produce the real-time shadowgraph images of their sneezing and breathing airflows for this study. These volunteers were asked to stand approximately 1 m in front of, and just to one side of the mirror in order to maximise the extent of their exhaled flows that would be visible in the mirror (Figure 1) .",

Exactly why there is so little comparative data available for sneezing is unclear, though it may be due to the difficulty with inducing the sneeze, which, unlike coughing, is a true reflex [24] . Notably, the few existing estimates are considerably higher than those found in this study. For example, Xie et al. [20] cited a velocity of up to 100 m/s based on earlier estimates by Wells [19] , then go on to use estimates of 20-50 m/s for sneeze velocities in a simple physical model of how droplets evaporate and move during various respiratory activities. However, a closer look at Wells' [19] original estimate reveals that this 100 m/s figure is actually an inference based on ''Castleman's adaptation of Rayleigh's formulation for droplet formation'', which infers that the velocity required for a moving air stream ''sweeping over a liquid surface'' to generate droplets of 10 mm diameter is 100 m/s. So this oftcited figure was only an inference drawn from some basic physical principles applied to a very simplified setting, but not obtained from any direct measurements of airflows generated by actual human sneezes in a much more complex biological environment. It is clear that more data is still needed as the range of velocities cited for sneezing still varies widely, even in this modern era. It should be borne in mind that such values may vary with different measurement methods, as well as the physical attributes, lung capacities and any constrained postures imposed on the human volunteers.",

Early experiments by Jennison and colleagues using strobe lighting and high-speed photography [25, 26] reported sneeze velocities as high as 46 m/s, as measured by the speed with which droplets were expelled by the sneeze. Yet, Jennison [26] acknowledged this distinction by stating: ''Depending upon their size and momentum, droplets may move faster, slower, or at the same speed as the air stream in which they are carried.'' Therefore, it may well be this distinction that has led to such wide variability in the reported sneeze velocities. Using the speed of the expelled droplets as a measure of the sneeze velocity then begs the natural follow-up question of which droplet size should then be used as a measure of sneeze velocity? Wells' [19] inferred estimate of 100 m/s for the sneeze velocity seems to assume that this droplet size is 10 mm in diameter. Again, more experimental studies (as opposed to theoretical inferences) are clearly needed, particularly into the distribution of droplet sizes and their velocities as produced by human sneezes, to answer these questions more accurately.",

This probably represents the acceleration of the expelled air in the early expiration phase of the sneeze, after the initial inspiration stage of the sneeze reflex, which is well recognized [24] . This initial inspiration stage was also recognized much earlier by Jennison [26] , as he stated: ''A sneeze consists of two stages -a sudden inspiration, followed by a forcible expiration.'' In addition, the changing shape of the mouth and position of the tongue may well affect the exit velocity of the air during the sneeze. A similar explanation to this was suggested by Tang et al. [15] for very similar appearances of the cough distance-velocity curves in that study. The shape of these curves remains similar, as seen in Figure 6 , which shows the same cough dataset re-analyzed to give the maximum (not just the x-resolved) cough velocities. The results in Figures 3 and 6 demonstrate that the maximum exit velocities of 4-5 m/s for coughing and sneezing, at least in this cohort of healthy young volunteers, were not very different, and far less than idealized 100 m/s inferred velocity for sneezing by Wells [19] .",

The exhalation airflow profiles for both nasal and mouth breathing are quite similar, being mainly conical and differing only in their relative direction, with similar propagation distances and airflow velocities. The variations in the airflow velocities of the nasal and mouth breathing exhalation flows can be related to the variation of airflow rates during expiration, which are due to a combination of lung tissue and diaphragmatic elasticity and recoil and elasticity that have been well-documented [27] . A study on the airflow dynamics of breathing by Gupta et al. [21] in human volunteers was performed on smokers, which may not be necessarily representative of healthy volunteers. Unfortunately, they used units of airflow rate (litres per second) which are difficult to convert to comparable airflow velocities (in m/s). Finally, the ratios of the velocities of the sneeze to those of the nasal and mouth breathing in this cohort of healthy, young volunteers is 3-4, which is not so dissimilar to that described by Javorka et al. [18] in premature newborns with a ratio of 6-7, and also suggests that this sneezing:breathing ratio may well be decreased in older, larger adult bodies.",

This may result in some underestimation of the maximum dissemination distances for some of these human respiratory activities. However, a minimum 'observable' dissemination distance has been given here, which is still of use to infection control teams. The maximum exit velocities for sneezing, breathing and coughing all occur within a time-frame for which the airflows are clearly visible, so these real-time velocity estimates should be relatively accurate. Ideally, these human voluntary 'jetlike' airflows, as imaged by this shadowgraph technique, should be compared to more controlled, idealized jet airflows to better understand and characterize this experimental method for visualizing such phenomena. However, within the more practical context of everyday, clinical patient infection control situations, these measurements from these human volunteers should still be useful.",
