            "text": "Both antiseptic hand rubbing (AHR) using ethanol-based disinfectants (EBDs) and antiseptic hand washing (AHW) are important means of infection control to prevent seasonal influenza A virus (IAV) outbreaks. However, previous reports suggest a reduced efficacy of ethanol disinfection against pathogens in mucus. We aimed to elucidate the situations and mechanisms underlying the reduced efficacy of EBDs against IAV in infectious mucus. We evaluated IAV inactivation and ethanol concentration change using IAV-infected patients' mucus (sputum). Additionally, AHR and AHW effectiveness against infectious mucus adhering to the hands and fingers was evaluated in 10 volunteers. Our clinical study showed that EBD effectiveness against IAV in mucus was extremely reduced compared to IAV in saline. IAV in mucus remained active despite 120 s of AHR; however, IAV in saline was completely inactivated within 30 s. Due to the low rate of diffusion/convection because of the physical properties of mucus as a hydrogel, the time required for the ethanol concentration to reach an IAV inactivation level and thus for EBDs to completely inactivate IAV was approximately eight times longer in mucus than in saline. On the other hand, AHR inactivated IAV in mucus within 30 s when the mucus dried completely because the hydrogel characteristics were lost. Additionally, AHW rapidly inactivated IAV. Until infectious mucus has completely dried, infectious IAV can remain on the hands and fingers, even after appropriate AHR using EBD, thereby increasing the risk of IAV transmission. We clarified the ineffectiveness of EBD use against IAV in infectious mucus. IMPORTANCE Antiseptic hand rubbing (AHR) and antiseptic hand washing (AHW) are important to prevent the spread of influenza A virus (IAV). This study elucidated the situations/mechanisms underlying the reduced efficacy of AHR against infectious mucus derived from IAV-infected individuals and indicated the weaknesses of the current hand hygiene regimens. Due to the low rate of diffusion/convection because of the physical properties of mucus as a hydrogel, the efficacy of AHR using ethanolbased disinfectant against mucus is greatly reduced until infectious mucus adhering to the hands/fingers has completely dried. If there is insufficient time before treating the next patient (i.e., if the infectious mucus is not completely dry), medical staff should be aware that effectiveness of AHR is reduced. Since AHW is effective against both dry and nondry infectious mucus, AHW should be adopted to compensate for these weaknesses of AHR. FIG 1 Analysis of the physical properties of mucus from 19 influenza A virus-infected patients. (A) Rheological analysis: mean, maximum, and minimum viscosities of mucus (sputum) samples at different shear rates (left panel). Shown is a comparison of mucus and saline viscosities at different shear rates (right panel). (B) Average parameters measured for saline and mucus samples: contact angles, surface tension, and densities at different temperatures. (C) Time required for saline and mucus to completely dry (complete drying time). (D) Ethanol diffusion coefficients of saline and mucus exposed to an 80% ethanol concentration. Situations of Reduced Hand Hygiene Effectiveness September/October 2019 Volume 4 Issue 5 e00474-19 msphere.asm.org 3 FIG 6 Additional fluid simulation of changes in the ethanol concentrations in mucus. (A) Addition of 95 l of 80% ethanol to 5 l saline was modeled in OpenFOAM, demonstrating the disappearance over time of the region with \u03fd31% ethanol (shown in red). See also Movie S1. (B) Addition of 95 l of 80% ethanol to 5 l mucus was modeled. The simulation was performed under conditions of reduced viscosity (16.7% of the actual measurement value) because of the long time required for disappearance of the concentration region of \u03fd31%.

Running of the simulation with a mucus viscosity at 16.7 or 12.5% of the measured value demonstrated that the ECIR was lower at the higher viscosity (see Fig. S4A in the supplemental material), suggesting that viscosity was a determining Figure S6 shows the physical characteristic (Continued on next page) factor for ECIR in mucus and that this affects the level of mixing between EBD and mucus by convection. As a supplemental study to evaluate the validity of this fluid simulation, lowviscosity mucus (12.5 and 16.7% of the measured value) with physical properties almost similar to those applied to this simulation was prepared by dilution of a mucus sample with water, and the time course of the change in ethanol concentration following addition of the EBD was measured. The ethanol concentration at low mucus viscosities of 12.5 and 16.7% increased to 31% in 45.9 and 51.8 s, respectively (Fig. S4B) , which was generally compatible with the results of this fluid simulation ( Fig. S4A and C) .

Taken together, these findings revealed that ECIR in infectious mucus was considerably low; this was because of decreased diffusion and convection phenomena due to the unique physical properties (particularly the high viscosity) of infectious mucus, which caused prolongation of the time required for EBD to exert its disinfecting effects on IAV in infectious mucus.",

We aimed to reproduce the situation in which infectious mucus discharged from IAV-infected patients adheres to the fingers of medical staff. There was close agreement between inactivation test results obtained from in situ and in vitro settings. The effectiveness of AHR regimens using EBDs on IAV in mucus was extremely reduced compared to that in saline, and infectious mucus containing IAV that adhered to the fingers was not effectively inactivated at 30 s. Current hand hygiene methods recommended by the CDC and WHO involve the use of disinfectants such as EBDs for 15 to 30 s (7-10). However, our results suggest that this disinfection time is insufficient for the disinfection of infectious mucus of IAV-infected patients adhered to the fingers/ hands and that current contact infection prevention and AHR regimens using EBDs are not sufficient to prevent IAV outbreaks. On the other hand, AHW completely inactivated IAV in infectious mucus within 30 s, indicating that the AHW regimen is more suitable than AHR regimen for inactivation of infectious mucus, including IAV. The liquids (culture medium, buffer solution, and saline) that are typically used as media to transfer pathogens when evaluating the effectiveness of disinfection methods have physical properties similar to those of pure water (a Newtonian fluid with extremely low viscosity). These liquids do not accurately simulate the physical properties of infectious body fluids, which include non-Newtonian fluids with relatively high viscosity, such as sputum and nasal discharge. Therefore, disinfectants (and disinfection methods) produced and approved using the currently recommended process can be insufficient for disinfection of infectious mucus, and deviations can occur between the expected effects and the actual clinical effects (7) (8) (9) (10) (17) (18) (19) (20) . A disinfectant effectiveness assessment test under conditions reproducing the physical properties of infectious mucus should be added to the current assessment standards for disinfectant effective-ness. Next-generation disinfectants developed/approved under these new disinfectant effectiveness assessment standards will be sufficiently effective against infectious mucus and will contribute greatly to the advancement of contact infection prevention.",

In fact, IAV both in dried mucus and in dried saline was rapidly inactivated within 30 s after exposure to EBD in both in vitro and in situ inactivation tests. For infectious mucus that is completely dried on fingers, EBDs exert IAV-inactivating effects in a short time (within 30 s), as conventionally recognized.

In our study, the time required for mucus (sputum) samples from IAV-infected patients to completely dry was approximately 30 min in an indoor environment (temperature, 25\u00b0C; humidity, 40%).

Since nonenveloped viruses (e.g., norovirus and adenovirus) are not easily inactivated by liquid disinfectants such as EBDs, prevention of contact infection with nonenveloped viruses is difficult (37) (38) (39) (40) . Although enveloped viruses such as IAV are usually inactivated relatively easily by EBDs, those present in undried infectious mucus are not effectively inactivated. Therefore, prevention of contact infection with enveloped viruses in undried infectious mucus should be performed in the same way as with nonenveloped virus. Moreover, \"Com-bination of means for drying mucus in a short time\" and \"Increase frequency of conventional AHW that washes out mucus physically instead of AHR\" may also contribute to more effective contact infection prevention.",

            "text": "There were three limitations to this study. First, regarding the AHW regimens in this study, handwashing was practiced using running water only, without using plain or antiseptic soap. These AHW regimens were expected to have a lower pathogen inactivation effect compared to that of AHW regimens using plain or antiseptic soap. However, IAV on the fingers was completely inactivated within 30 s under all AHW conditions, showing a good IAV inactivation effect of AHW in this study. Therefore, this limitation did not affect the results and conclusions of this study. Second, the additional fluid simulation was performed with the mucus (sample no. 10) viscosity reduced to 16.7 or 12.5% of the measured value ( Fig. 6; Fig. S4A ). In the initial simulation of mucus conditions using the measured mucus viscosity, the time required for regions containing \u03fd31% ethanol to disappear exceeded 120 s. Times exceeding 120 s are not realistic, because the calculation time and costs are dramatically increased in the additional simulation reproducing the reaction conditions of the ethanol concentration measurement and the inactivation tests more faithfully. Therefore, the additional fluid simulation was performed with the mucus viscosity reduced. The result of the initial simulation under the same low-viscosity conditions (12.5 and 16.7% of the measured value) was as with the additional simulation (Fig. S4D) ; the results of actual measurement of ethanol concentrations in low-viscosity mucus (Fig. S4C ) were generally compatible with the results of the additional simulation (Fig. S4A) . The validity of the additional fluid simulation was confirmed, and it was demonstrated that the physical properties of mucus greatly affect the increase of ethanol concentration in mucus. Third, to estimate the time required for saline or mucus to completely dry up, the time required for samples to completely dry up on a glass plate was measured in an indoor environment. In the future, it will be necessary to establish a method for measuring the complete drying time of infectious mucus on human skin. Depending on the results of the future study, the complete drying time may vary slightly from a minimum of \"30 min,\" as shown in this study.",

Changes in ethanol concentration in saline or mucus were measured after addition of 80% (wt/wt) ethanol-based disinfectant (EBD) (see Fig. S5A in the supplemental material). Ethanol concentrations were measured with a digital ethanol densitometer (ATAGO, Tokyo, Japan), which was modified for this measurement. The digital ethanol densitometer is a refractometer that measures the ethanol concentration at the center of a sample placed on a prism in a hemispherical region with a diameter of \u03f31 mm; this enables measurement of changes in ethanol concentration over time in the region of the sample with the lowest ethanol concentration.

Briefly, 95 l of EBD or PBS was added to 5 l of a mixture of IAV and mucus or saline (final viral titer, 1.0 \u03eb 10 6 FFU/ml) in 24-well plates and incubated at 25\u00b0C for 15, 30, 60, 120, 180, 210, 240, or 300 s prior to neutralization by dilution with 900 l MEM; titration of IAV was then performed. The survival ratio was calculated as the ratio of the titer after incubation with disinfectant to that measured after incubation with PBS; this ratio indicated the proportion of IAV that was not inactivated by the disinfectant. A fitting curve was prepared using the survival ratio at each time point, and complete inactivation time (time required for IAV to be completely inactivated) was calculated from the fitting curve. Complete inactivation was defined as a survival ratio below 10 \u03ea5 . In addition, the mixture of IAV and saline or mucus was dried completely by letting the mixture stand for 40 min before EBD exposure, and the same inactivation test described above was carried out. For each measurement, three independent experiments were performed, and the results are expressed as the mean \u03ee standard deviation.",
