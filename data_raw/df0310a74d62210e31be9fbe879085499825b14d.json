Nevertheless, as mentioned in the Discussion of our manuscript, optimization of the chimeric approach would likely provide other vaccine candidates with improved characteristics. Still, the results obtained with the chimeric metapneumovirus F protein incorporating antigenic site II from RSV F (Fig. 4) already demonstrate the feasibility of affording protection against a RSV challenge with chimeric proteins without reaching neutralizing titers as high as with the homologous protein. The metapneumovirus neutralization titers of Fig. 6 (of concern to the Editorial Board member that you contacted) are not lower than the hRSV neutralization titres found in some mouse sera of Fig. 4 and these mice were protected against the heterologous challenge. Therefore, our results already provide evidence of inducing cross-neutralizing and protecting responses with chimeric F proteins although there is still room for improvement; e.g, by grafting more than one antigenic site to the chimeras.",

Thus the authors chose to focus on grafting site II or site IV amino acids from one virus onto the backbone of the other virus. The combinations of changes made are logical. However, a major problem is that many of the chimera proteins made were very poorly expressed. Indeed, the proteins with the most logical combination of backbones and mutational changes failed to express at levels that were workable. This finding points to a major problem that may be encountered in this approach, ability of chimera proteins to fold properly and thus be expressed. However, using the four chimera proteins that were expressed, the authors presented results that suggested the feasibility of the approach with the right combination of backbones and mutational changes. However, the authors did not clearly identify a potential vaccine candidate. Chimera F-416 is the most promising in terms of inducing potentially protective responses to the two viruses. Unfortunately this chimera is very poorly expressed (10% wild type) making its development as a vaccine problematic.",

Although polyclonal sera after infection with one pneumovirus do not neutralize the other, it is correctly pointed out that previously cross-reactive virus neutralizing monoclonal antibodies have been identified. It is claimed that these results demonstrate the feasibility of 'universal vaccines' that could protect against infections by all human Pneumoviridae. As to date -unlike the situation for influenza viruses and HIV-no more than two (important) members of this family have been identified in humans (all be it with two subtypes each) which are antigenically rather stable over time, and 'the chimeric protein approach described here undoubtedly requires further optimization', this claim may be considered somewhat audacious at this stage. Toning down the title and changing the last paragraph of the discussion section into: 'results presented here demonstrate the feasibility of using chimeric proteins to design single immunogens that could induce cross neutralizing and cross-protecting immune responses against the important human Pneumoviridae members hRSV and hMPV', would seem more appropriate.",

            "text": "This manuscript describes a potential method to produce a pneumovirus F protein vaccine candidate that will induce protective responses to both respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and metapneumovirus (MPV). The authors have taken advantage of the availability of the crystal structures of the pre-F and post-F forms of RSV F protein and the newly reported post-F form of the MPV F protein. The approach is to make a chimera protein with amino acids specific to an F protein epitope from one virus grafted into the backbone of the other virus F protein with the goal of generating a protein containing neutralizing antibody binding sites from both viruses. The manuscript is clearly written, and the experiments are well done with appropriate controls and statistical analyses.",

Thus the authors chose to focus on grafting site II or site IV amino acids from one virus onto the backbone of the other virus. The combinations of changes made are logical. However, a major problem is that many of the chimera proteins made were very poorly expressed. Indeed, the proteins with the most logical combination of backbones and mutational changes failed to express at levels that were workable. This finding points to a major problem that may be encountered in this approach, ability of chimera proteins to fold properly and thus be expressed. However, using the four chimera proteins that were expressed, the authors presented results that suggested the feasibility of the approach with the right combination of backbones and mutational changes. However, the authors did not clearly identify a potential vaccine candidate. Chimera F-416 is the most promising in terms of inducing potentially protective responses to the two viruses. Unfortunately this chimera is very poorly expressed (10% wild type) making its development as a vaccine problematic. Specific points 1. The authors should discuss more fully the issue of expression levels of chimera proteins in their approach and their results.",
