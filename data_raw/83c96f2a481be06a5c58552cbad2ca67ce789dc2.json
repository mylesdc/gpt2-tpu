Such collected data can be used to assist in the preliminary screening and early identification of possible COVID-19 infected individuals. Thousands of data points are able to be collected and processed through an artificial intelligence (AI) framework which can ultimately evaluate individuals that may be infected and stratify them into no-risk, minimal-risk, moderate-risk, and high-risk of being infected with the virus. The identification of the high-risk cases can then be quarantined earlier, thus decreasing the chance of spread. Table 1 is inserted here.",

The AI algorithm described in Appendix II is to identify possible case identifications and send alerts to the nearest health clinic as well as to the respondent for an immediate health visit, we call this as an \"alert for health check recommendation for COVID-2019. In case the respondent is unable to commute to the health center, the health department can then send an alert to a mobile health unit so they can then do doorto-door assessments and even testing for the virus. This generates alert for mobile health check recommendation for 2019-nCoV (MHCRC). If a respondent does not have an immediate risk of having symptoms or signs related to the viral infection, then the AI-based health alert will be sent to the respondent to notify them that there is no current risk of COVID-2019. Figure 1 summarizes the outcomes of data collection and identification of possible cases. The data recorded in step 5 of the algorithm using signs and symptoms will be collected prior to both the groups who have received alerts HCRC or MHCRC (for possible identification and assessment) and NCRC (for non-identified respondents).",

As we are focusing, in this note, only identification of cases, further analysis techniques are out of the scope. However, our approach is flexible to capture various other associations within the populations.Appendix III: Further computations on the data collected Suppose and are individuals in a region who have responded and not responded, respectively for a mobile-based online survey. Responses are randomly associated and not depended on the sickness due to the virus. The pair gives us the proportions who have responded and not responded in that region. Note that we can compute because the value is known to us in that region. Let out of are possible cases identified through our algorithm and out of are possible cases of the virus which were never identified by the algorithm (because number of individuals never responded to the survey). Since and are known to us, one of the following relations will hold: We will know which one of the relations listed in (A2.1) is true. When , one of the following relations will hold: But we will never know which one of the relations in (A2.1) is true because were never identified by the algorithm. For example, suppose 2000 individuals respond and 500 individuals do not respond to the survey, and 400 were identified as a possible number of cases by the algorithm. If there are 100 possible cases of virus (which we do not have a mechanism to count) out of 500 who never responded, then the relation is true.Similarly, we will see other relations of (A2.2) could arise when Using a similar argument, we can verify that when other relations of (A2.1) are true, we still be unsure which of the relations in (A2.1) is true. The contingency options are provided inFigure 2to visualize the data to be generated through the proposed method.",
