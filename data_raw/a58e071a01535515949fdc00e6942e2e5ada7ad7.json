Since the 1980's, several canine caliciviruses (CaCV) isolates have been reported and are phylogenetically related to the vesiviruses with features distinct from both Vesicular exanthema of swine virus (VESV) and Feline calicivirus (FCV) species in phylogeny, serology and cell culture specificities. Etiological studies of canine diseases in dogs used for military services and laboratory studies were conducted in 1963-1978 at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research. Multiple known and unknown viral pathogens including caliciviruses were recovered. Methods: Four unidentified isolates were recovered in Walter Reed Canine Cells (WRCC) from respiratory, fecal and penile specimens. Physicochemical tests, electron microscopy, viral cultivation in human and animal cells, antibody neutralization assays, and recently the genome sequencing were used to characterize the isolates. Sera from these dogs and their cohorts were tested with the isolates to determine origin and prevalence of the infections.",

Caliciviruses cause a wide range of significant diseases in human and animals. At present, there are five recognized genera, i.e., Norovirus, Sapovirus, Lagovirus, Vesivirus, and Nebovirus with several additional candidate genera or species proposed and under evaluation by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) [1, 2] (http://www.caliciviridae.com/unclassified/unclassified.htm). In the Vesivirus genus, Vesicular exanthema of swine virus (VESV) and Feline calicivirus (FCV) are two species currently approved by ICTV. Several canine caliciviruses (CaCV) isolates have been identified and shown to be phylogenetically related to vesiviruses with features distinct from both VESV and FCV in phylogeny, serology and cell culture specificities. CaCV is a probable species in the Vesivirus genus, as stated by ICTV [2] . It is still unclassified to date and the evidence presented herein should facilitate the classification and acceptance of CaCV as a species of vesivirus.",

In response to the use of dogs in military services and laboratory studies, etiological studies of canine diseases were conducted in 1963-1978 at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR) [3, 4] . In addition to several known canine viral pathogens [5, 6] , four unidentified viruses were recovered in Walter Reed Canine Cells (WRCC) producing similar cytopathic effects (CPE). The isolates were not recognized by available human and dog reference virus antisera. Studies of their physicochemical properties and electron microscope observations identified the isolates as likely caliciviruses. Our recent whole genome sequencing of these canine isolates clearly identified them as vesiviruses and elucidated their genetic relationships to the other members of the Caliciviridae family. We herein report the viral isolation and characterization results, which were made in 1963-1978 canine diseases etiological study but were not published, and additional genomics analysis supporting the serological diversity of CaCV strongly suggesting that these isolates and similar CaCV are a unique species within Vesivirus genus [7] [8] [9] .",

After initial WRCC inoculation, all isolates produced CPE within two to four days. Each of the isolates was re-isolated and readily propagated in these cells. One dog died shortly after collection. The other three dogs developed neutralizing antibodies to their isolates (Table 1) . Neutralizing antibody was detected in 20 to 67% of initial serum specimens from each group of dogs and a small percentage of dogs had a rise in titer (Table 1 ). In addition to these four isolates, three other viruses were recovered from three of these dogs and identified as canine coronavirus co-infected with L198 T, canine picornavirus with A128T [17] and canine parainfluenza virus with W191R, indicating mixed infections occurred in three surviving dogs.",

The genomes are close to 8.5 kb in length and contain three open-reading frames encoding putative calicivirus nonstructural polyproteins (ORF1), major capsid protein VP1 (ORF2) and small capsid protein VP2 (ORF3) (Additional file 1: Figure S1 ). There are three nucleotides between ORF 1 and ORF 2, which are GCT for strains 48, isolates A128T and L198 T, and GCA for strains 2117, isolates 3-68 and W191R; consequently ORF 1 and 2 are in the same reading frame. ORF2 and ORF3 overlap by four nucleotides ATGA which shifts the reading frame by + 2, in which ATG and TGA are start and stop codon for ORF3 and ORF2, respectively (Additional file 1: Figure S1 ). The size and organization of ORFs as well as their putative mature proteins are highly consistent with the two representative CaCV strains, strains 48 (NC_004542.1) [21] and 2117 (AY343325) [7] respectively. Nucleotide identity between genome sequences of strain 48 and 2117 is only 71.3%. Genome sequences of strain 48, A128T and L198 T (designated as type I strain) have identities of 87.6-90.7%.

The phylogenetic position of the CaCV isolates were determined based on amino acid sequences of RdRP and VP1 (Fig. 2) . Clearly the CaCV isolates A128T and L198 T are close to type I strain 48, while isolates 3-68 and W191R are close to type II strain 2117. These results showed that these CaCVs phylogenetically belong to genus vesivirus with clear separation from species FCV and VESV. The known CaCV strains and isolates possibly form two phylogenetic clades. Sequence divergences of CaCV from species FCV or VESV for both RdRP and VP1 proteins are closer to or larger than the distance between FCV and VESV ( Figure S2 ). The antigenically highly distinguishable (Table 1 ) but genetically highly similar pairs of isolates (Table 3) , A128T/ L198 T and W191R/3-68 differ by 50 and 89 amino acid residues respectively. Most differences are located in the hyper-variable regions in which the amino acids differ between and within the each pair. Protein sequences of (A) RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) and (B) major capsid protein (VP1) were respectively aligned with MUSCLE program [16] .

The initial physical and chemical studies and electron microscopic observations clearly indicate the isolates are caliciviruses.

            "text": "Determination of each isolate's genome sequence clearly identified each isolate as a member of the vesivirus genus in the Caliciviridae family and phylogenetically separate from FCV and VESV species. CaCV apparently has two serologically distinct and genetically divergent types: type I which includes strains 48, isolates A128T and L198 T; and type II which includes strain Bari/212/07/ITA, isolates 3-68 and W191R as well as 2117 and several 2117-like vesiviruses. It is remarkable that CaCV type II viruses share very high amino acid identities for RdRP (98.7% \u00b1 0.5%), but substantially lower identities (87.5 \u00b1 3.2) for VP1. It is rational to speculate that the high divergence of VP1 associates with capsid structure variation, antigenic diversity and in consequence broadened host specificity. It has been shown that vesivirus 2117 has a capsid structure more similar to sapovirus and lagovirus than to vesiviruses and potentially alterations in receptor binding [32] . Vesivirus 2117 [7] and 2117-like viruses Allston 2008/US (GenBank accession GQ475302), Allston 2009/US (GQ475301) and Geel 2008/Belgium (GQ475301) were identified as viral contaminants causative of CPE in production line Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. The origin of these viruses is unknown but possibly from dogs [33] . Vesivirus 2117 can readily grow and develop CPE in MDCK and CHO-K1 cells. CPE in BHK-21 is weak in the first passage and more obvious in the second passage [34] . In a previous study the virus propagated in CHO cells but not in other cells including MDCK and BHK [7] . In our study, isolates 3-68 and W191R were isolated from dogs and maintained in the WRCC dog cell line. Neither produced visible CPE in BHK-21 cultures in first passage. Isolates 3-68 and W191R have respective amino acid identities of 88.7% and 85.7% for VP1 with strain 2117. The divergence of capsid sequences may have contributed to the adaptation of strain 2117 to hamster cells. It is important that the strain 2117-like viruses from CHO cells at three different locations, i.e. Germany, USA and Belgium are significantly different from each other by 14.1 \u00b1 0.9% for VP1 proteins, a similar extent as the distances with other CaCV II viruses. The large heterogeneity of major capsid proteins of CaCV and the evidence of possible cross species infectivity indicates the potential zoonotic transmission of CaCV. Speculation of possible canine to human transmission is supported by the recent finding of Bari/212/07/ITA antibodies in 7.8% of human sera tested in Italy [35] .",

CaCV antibodies against each isolate were found in acute sera from other dogs in each cohort and only one other dog with rising antibody titer ( Table 1 ). The data clearly suggest the infections by CaCV occurred after the dogs arrived in their cohorts.",

The detailed analyses demonstrated the restricted cell tropism, antigenic diversity and genetic variation of the CaCV viruses. The genomes of the four isolates together with the previously reported canine 48 and Bari/212/07/ ITA strains provide significant additional evidence to support the formation in the canine vesivirus genus of canine calicivirus (CaCV) species consisting of at least two clades/types. Identification of the antigenically distinct vesiviruses capable of growth in cell culture provides a valuable model for studying the role of specific neutralizing antibody in protection against infection and disease during calicivirus infections.",
