            "text": "Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) is a porcine enteropathogenic coronavirus that causes watery diarrhea, vomiting, and frequently death in piglets, causing serious economic losses to the pig industry. The strain CHN-JS-2017 was isolated and identified by cytopathology, immunofluorescence assays, transmission electron microscopy, and sequence analysis. A nucleotide sequence alignment showed that the whole genome of CHN-JS-2017 is 97.4%-99.6% identical to other PDCoV strains. The pathogenicity of the CHN-JS-2017 strain was investigated in orally inoculated five-day-old piglets; the piglets developed acute, watery diarrhea, but all recovered and survived. CHN-JS-2017 infection-induced microscopic lesions were observed, and viral antigens were detected mainly by immunohistochemical staining in the small intestine. The neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) and polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR) are crucial immunoglobulin (Ig) receptors for the transcytosis ofimmunoglobulin G (IgG), IgA, or IgM. Importantly, CHN-JS-2017 infected five-day-old piglets could significantly down-regulate the expression of FcRn, pIgR, and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB)in the intestinal mucosa. Note that the level of FcRn mRNA in the intestinal mucosa of normal piglets is positively correlated with pIgR and NF-\u03baB. At the same time, the expressions of FcRn, pIgR, and NF-\u03baB mRNA are also positively correlated in infected piglets. These results may help explain the immunological and pathological changes associated with porcine deltacorononirus infection.",

The N gene amplified from the PDCoV CHN-JS-2017 strain was cloned into the pMD18-T cloning vector (Takara, Dalian). The pMD18-N plasmid was serially diluted 10-fold to generate a standard curve in each plate. The viral RNA in the sample was calculated based on the results for the standard curve. Virus titers were detected by Tissue culture infective dose (TCID 50 ), as previously described [8] . The specific pig pIgR, NF-\u03baB, FcRn, and GAPDH gene primers were synthesized by GenScript Corporation (Nanjing, China) as described previously (Table S2 ) [19, 24] . The expression level of the gene was calculated relative to the expression of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) using the delta-delta cycle to threshold (2 \u2212\u2206\u2206CT ) method.",

Overall, these results confirm that PDCoV causes severe diarrhea and vomiting in pigs aged 5-21 days. We used the PDCoV CHN-JS-2017 strain to infect five-day-old newborn piglets by oral feeding. Our success in inducing severe diarrhea and vomiting in piglets through oral infections strongly suggests that PDCoV poses a significant threat to newborn piglets on pig farms. In addition, we collected fecal swabs from piglets challenged with PDCoV and detected viral fecal shedding with real-time PCR. PDCoV RNA was detected from 1-14 dpi, and no RNA were detected in the control group piglets during the study period. This indicates that PDCoV infection by fecal-oral contamination may be the main route of transmission for piglets. In addition, during the necropsy on the seventh day, large lesions were clearly observed in the small intestine of the piglets [9] . In an earlier report, microscopic lesions were observed in all parts of the small intestine infected with PEDV [28] . In the current study, we observed microscopic lesions of the jejuna of CHN-JS-2017 infected piglets, indicative of PDCoV. The disease caused by PDCoV is milder than the disease caused by PEDV. In addition, the PDCoV antigen in the cytoplasm of the villous intestinal cells of the piglets challenged with PDCoV was detected by immunohistochemical analysis. Taken together, these results confirm that the PDCoV CHN-JS-2017 strain isolated in this study may cause intestinal disease in newborn piglets.",

Reovirus, LPS (a ligand for Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) TLR4), IFN-\u03b3, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) all regulate pIgR and FcRn expression, mainly by the activation of the NF-\u03baB or Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK-STAT) JAK-STAT pathway [31] [32] [33] [34] . The down-regulation of FcRn and pIgR by reovirus have been shown in the tracheal mucosa of simian-human immunodeficiency virus/simian immunodeficiency virus (SHIV/SIV)-infected rhesus monkeys [35, 36] . Human cytomegalovirus evades humoral immunity by the degradation of FcRn [30] . TGEV-induced FcRn expression by activating NF-\u03baB signaling in porcine small intestinal epithelial (IPEC-J2) cells [19] . However, PDCoV CHN-JS-2017 significantly down-regulated FcRn, pIgR, and NF-\u03baB expressions, and they were positively related to each other in infected piglets. Therefore, the reduced levels of FcRn and pIgR mRNA might be attributed to the reduced levels of NF-\u03baB. In addition, PDCoV might reduce the ability of FcRn and pIgR to transport PDCoV-specific IgG and IgA across the mucosal epithelium, resulting in impaired intestinal immunity in the mucosa, reducing the host's anti-infection ability. These data demonstrated the altered expression of FcRn and pIgR in coronavirus, and by extension, coronavirus infections, which might have contributed to providing another insight into the immune escape strategy of PDCoV.",

Furthermore, the inoculated piglets showed down-regulated FcRn and pIgR expression by NF-\u03baB mRNA. At the same time, we found that the expression of FcRn and pIgR of piglets infected with PDCoV is positively correlated with NF-\u03baB. The results help us to understand the molecular epidemiology and pathogenesis of PDCoV and also provide insights into the development of effective vaccines against this significant pathogen.",
