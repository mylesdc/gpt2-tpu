            "text": "Codon usage bias (CUB) is an important evolutionary feature in a genome which provides important information for studying organism evolution, gene function and exogenous gene expression. The CUB and its shaping factors in the nuclear genomes of four sequenced cotton species, G. arboreum (A 2 ), G. raimondii (D 5 ), G. hirsutum (AD 1 ) and G. barbadense (AD 2 ) were analyzed in the present study. The effective number of codons (ENC) analysis showed the CUB was weak in these four species and the four subgenomes of the two tetraploids. Codon composition analysis revealed these four species preferred to use pyrimidinerich codons more frequently than purine-rich codons. Correlation analysis indicated that the base content at the third position of codons affect the degree of codon preference. PR2-bias plot and ENC-plot analyses revealed that the CUB patterns in these genomes and subgenomes were influenced by combined effects of translational selection, directional mutation and other factors. The translational selection (P2) analysis results, together with the non-significant correlation between GC12 and GC3, further revealed that translational selection played the dominant role over mutation pressure in the codon usage bias. Through relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) analysis, we detected 25 high frequency codons preferred to end with T or A, and 31 low frequency codons inclined to end with C or G in these four species and four subgenomes. Finally, 19 to 26 optimal codons with 19 common ones were determined for each species and subgenomes, which preferred to end with A or T. We concluded that the codon usage bias was weak and the translation selection was the main shaping factor in nuclear genes of these four cotton genomes and four subgenomes.

This phenomenon called 'synonymous codon usage bias (SCUB)' reflects non-uniform usage of synonymous codons encoding the same amino acid during the translation of genes to proteins [2,3]. The degree of SCUB divergence varies greatly among different species and genes [4-7]. SCUB was affected by many factors, including directional mutation, neutral selection [8], GC content, synonymous substitution rate [9], tRNA abundance [10], selection for efficient translation initiation [11], codon hydropathy and DNA replication initiation site [12], gene length [13] and expression level [14]",

The genus Gossypium includes around 46 diploid (2n = 2x = 26) and 6 tetraploid (2n = 4x = 52) and 1 purported species [24][25][26], including four commercial ones, G. arboreum (A 2 ), G. herbaceum (A 1 ), G. hirsutum (AD 1 ) and G. barbadense (AD 2 ). It has been proposed that all diploid cotton species may have evolved from a common ancestor and allopolyploid cotton may have appeared through hybridization and subsequent polyploidization events between the A-and D-subgenome progenitors. The D-genome species G. raimondii (D 5 ) and the A-genome species much like modern G. arboreum (A 2 ) and G. herbaceum (A 2 ) are the donor species for the D and A chromosome groups of the tetraploid cotton species, respectively [27][28]. Recently, the nuclear genome sequences of G. arboreum, G. raimondii, G. hirsutum and G. barbadense, and chloroplast and mitochondrial genome sequences of G. hirsutum have successively been released [29][30][31][32][33][34][35][36][37][38], which has advanced the understanding of cotton genomics and genetics, and made it possible to investigate SCUB patterns in cotton nuclear and organelle genomes. But until now, SCUB analysis has been performed only in chloroplast genome of G. hirsutum [36]. The purpose of this study was to analyze the SCUB patterns of the four sequenced cotton species and explore the key factors influencing codon choice.",

When there is no deviation between mutation and selection pressure of two DNA chains, the fractional content of the four bases follows A = T and G = C (where A + T + G + C = 1) [40] . PR2-bias plots are particularly informative when PR2 biases at the third codon position are plotted. The center of the plot, where both coordinates are 0.5, is the place where A = T and G = C (PR2). The degree of deviation from PR2 allows us to estimate the chain bias affected by mutation, selection, or both [41] . If genes are evenly distributed across the plan view, that is, if the codon usage frequency of A + T is the same as that of G + C at the third position, then the codon usage preference is likely to be entirely caused by mutation [40] . The A3s/(A3s+T3s) and G3s/(G3s+C3s) of each gene were calculated and used as the ordinate and the abscissa to show the relationship between the two base contents of genes, namely purine (A and G) and pyrimidine (T and C) at the third codon position. The PR2-plots were drawn by Matlab R2016a (https://www. mathworks.com/). ENC-plot (ENC versus GC3s). The effective codon number (ENC) determines the degree of preference for the unbalanced use of codons. ENC value ranges from 20 (only one codon is used for each amino acid) to 61 (when all synonymous codons are used for each amino acid) and is negatively correlated with codon usage bias. The codon usage pattern across genes was examined by the ENC-plot drawn by Matlab R2016a, which is a plot of ENC versus GC3s. ENC-plot is one of the most widely used measures for judging whether or not organism codon usage is biased through exploring the use of codon bias, and detecting the effect of base content on CUB [36] . The expected ENC values from GC3s (denoted by 'S') were calculated according to the equation given by Wright [42] and Novembre [43] :",

Generally speaking, highly expressed genes have a large degree of codon preference and therefore a small ENC value. Low expression genes contain more rare codons and have a larger ENC value. Therefore, the relative level of gene expression is currently generally determined by comparing ENCs. The smaller the ENC value is, the higher the corresponding gene is often expressed. 5% of the sequence data were taken from the upper and lower limit regions of the ordered data set, to establish two high-and low-bias gene datasets. To define optimal codons, we used a Ttest to examine the significance of codon usage difference between the two datasets [47] . The RSCU values of the codons from the two databases were compared. If the difference (\u0394RSCU) is equal to or greater than 0.08, and codons with a frequency of usage that was significantly higher (P < 0.01) in high-bias genes than that in genes with low bias were defined as the optimal codons [22, 48] .

Briefly, the base composition at the third codon position conforms to T > A > G > C. Both the GC3s and GC content were less than 0.5, illustrating that these four cotton species tend to use pyrimidine-rich codons more frequently than purine-rich codons. In G. raimondii, the T3s was even greater than GC content. The average GC contents are higher than GC3 S . Such codon base composition preference was also previously reported in upland cotton chloroplast genes whose GC3s (27.38%) and GC (37.89%) were even lower [36] . Totally, these results were consistent with the lower nuclear GC contents in such cotton species [50] [51] [52] [53] . The effective codon number (ENC) values revealed the degree of CUB. ENC is negatively correlated with CUB. According to previous studies [19, 42, 54] , ENC values less than 35 mean high codon preference and ENC values more than 50 reveal general random codon usage. Herein, the average ENC values ranged from 53.39 in G. raimondii to 54.41 in At 2 subgenome ( Table 2 ). The distribution of ENC values of the total genes in each genome or subgenome ( Fig  2) revealed that less than 0.5%, and more than 70% of genes had low (< 35) and high (> 50) ENC values respectively in all genomes and subgenomes, indicating weak codon usage bias.",

Similar ENC-plots are found among all the four cotton species genomes and the four subgenomes of the two tetraploid species (Fig 4) . CDSs appeared to cluster around the expected ENC of 30-60. Although a small number of genes distributed in the vicinity of the expected curve, indicated that compositional constraint was the only determinant factor shaping the codon usage pattern. A majority of genes with low ENC values deviated well below the expected curve, indicating that GC3s value was a major determinant of codon usage bias and that other factors independent of nucleotide composition shaped codon usage as well [65] .

The D-genome species G. raimondii (D 5 ) and the A-genome species much like modern G. arboreum (A 2 ) and G. herbaceum (A 1 ) have been supported by molecular methods and other evidence [28,68,71-72] to be the donor species for the Dt and At subgenome of the tetraploid cotton species, respectively. The monophyly of polyploid Gossypium species was also studied through cluster analysis based on sequences of a 2.8-kb intergenic region from all diploid species belonging to the genome groups from which the polyploid originates [28] , in which all the Dt subgenomes and D 5 genome were grouped into one cluster, and all the At subgenomes and the A 1 and A 2 genomes were grouped into another cluster. The results of the present study indicated that the evolutionary relationship among these four cotton species could not be well reflected by RSCU-based cluster analysis.",

All these genomes and subgenomes exhibited similar weaker codon usage bias revealed by the results of less (< 0.5%) genes with low (< 35) ENC and more genes (> 70%) with high ENC. Codon composition analysis revealed these species and subgenomes had low GC and GC3, tended to use pyrimidine-rich codons more frequently than purine-rich codons at the third positions of codons and follow the T > A > G > C trend, although there was significant difference in codon composition and codon usage preference among them. Correlation analysis indicated that the base content at the third position of codons affected the degree of codon preference. PR2-bias plot and ENC-plot revealed that not only translation selection but also directional mutation and other factors shaped the CUB. The P2 analysis results, with the non-significant correlation between GC12 and GC3, further revealed that translation selection was the main factor influencing the CUB pattern herein. Through RSCU analysis, 25 high frequency codons preferentially ended with T or A, and 31 low frequency codons preferentially ended with C or G common in these genomes and subgenomes were determined. And 19 to 26 optimal codons were determined, including 19 common ones, for each species and subgenome. The optimal codons preferred to end with A or T. Finally, we concluded that these four cotton genomes had weak CUB, translation selection played dominant role over mutation pressure in codon usage preference in these four cotton species, and At and Dt subgenomes had similar codon usage patterns with their A-and D-genome progenitors.",
