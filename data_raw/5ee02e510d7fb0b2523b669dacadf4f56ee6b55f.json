In 2000, the BNHI in Taiwan began to conduct market price and volume survey before each price adjustment. At the price adjustment implemented on April 1, 2000 , the BNHI adjusted each individual product's reimbursement price according to the following equation [2]:",

Since PA2006, it became an off-patent product.

This hypothesized example displays that throughout the stepwise price adjustments, the difference between the reimbursement price and the market trading price (i.e., profit for physicians) narrowed. It is also important to find that when the patented Enalapril turned to an off-patent Enalapril (at the time of PA2006 implementation), the reimbursement price of this drug is adjusted according to a lower GWAP as well as a smaller r-zone compared with the WAP and the r-zone before PA2006, and therefore, the reduction in reimbursement price is larger and the profit margin for physicians is significantly squeezed.",
