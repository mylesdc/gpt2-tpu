These bats are widespread throughout sub-Saharan Africa and among the most abundant mammals on the continent [1, 2] . Mitochondrial evidence has shown the existence of several deeply divergent lineages within the H. caffer complex, which most likely constitute more than the two species [3] . Recently, they have been discovered to host viruses with zoonotic potential [4] , emphasizing the need for knowledge about their ecology in order to gain insight into zoonotic processes and risk factors for public health. Microsatellites provide a powerful tool to investigate the poorly known ecology and life history of these bats, including genetic structure, social arrangements and mating systems. Assessment of nuclear gene flow through microsatellite analysis may thus help to shed light also on the taxonomy of this species complex.",

DNA was extracted using an innu-PREP DNA mini kit (Analytik Jena, Jena, Germany). Five micrograms of pooled DNA from eight individuals was sent to AGRF (www.agrf.com.au), where high throughput sequencing was performed on a Roche GS FLX 454 sequencing machine as described elsewhere [6] [7] [8] . QDD 1.3 [9] was used to screen for di-to hexanucleotide repeat motifs with a minimum of eight repeats. From the 1689 microsatellites identified, a total of 32 primer pairs flanking tetranucleotide repeats with 11-15 repeat motifs were designed using PRIMER3 [10] . Twenty primer pairs for which the annealing temperatures were most similar for each primer were selected for initial amplification trials. Amplification products from these primer pairs were visualised by electrophoresis on an agarose gel, from which 13 pairs with strong, stutter-free amplification bands were selected for optimisation. Forward primers for these 13 loci were directly labelled with a fluorochrome at the 5\u2032 end. Twelve of these loci were successfully amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), with one discarded due to the excessive amplification of nonspecific product. PCR conditions for these 12 loci were optimized and genotyping was performed on 38 individuals (16 females, 22 males) sampled in Brong Ahafo and Volta Regions.",

PCR amplification consisted of an initial denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 3 min followed by six touchdown cycles of 94\u00b0C denaturation for 30 s, annealing for 30 s with temperatures decreased by 2\u00b0C per cycle (55-47\u00b0C, 60-50\u00b0C, or 65-55\u00b0C; Table 1 ), and polymerase extension step at 72\u00b0C for 45 s. An additional 35 cycles were conducted, of denaturation (94\u00b0C, 30 s), primer annealing (final touchdown temperature, 45 s), and polymerase extension (72\u00b0C, 45 s), followed by a final extension (72\u00b0C, 10 min). PCR products were electrophoresed using an ABI3130 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Allele sizes were determined via manual inspection using the software PEAK SCANNER 1.0 (Applied Biosystems), followed by automated binning performed using TANDEM 1.09 [11] . We reanalyzed 20% of individuals to evaluate data integrity. One locus (Hr3) was discarded due to high rounding error in the TANDEM analysis, indicating poor marker quality. MICRO-CHECKER 2.2.3 was used to assess the probability of scoring errors, allelic dropout and the presence of null alleles [12] . No scoring errors or allelic dropout were detected, although there were potentially null alleles at loci Hr7 and Hr12. Locus Hr13 may also suffer from null alleles, though low allelic variability (one common and one rare allele) did not allow this to be confirmed ( Table 1) .",
