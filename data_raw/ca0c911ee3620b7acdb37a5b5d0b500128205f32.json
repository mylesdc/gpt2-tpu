            "text": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is among the most relevant causes of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Research is complicated by a lack of accessible small animal models. The systematic investigation of viruses of small mammals could guide efforts to establish such models, while providing insight into viral evolutionary biology. We have assembled the so-far largest collection of small-mammal samples from around the world, qualified to be screened for bloodborne viruses, including sera and organs from 4,770 rodents (41 species); and sera from 2,939 bats (51 species). Three highly divergent rodent hepacivirus clades were detected in 27 (1.8%) of 1,465 European bank voles (Myodes glareolus) and 10 (1.9%) of 518 South African four-striped mice (Rhabdomys pumilio). Bats showed anti-HCV immunoblot reactivities but no virus detection, although the genetic relatedness suggested by the serologic results should have enabled RNA detection using the broadly reactive PCR assays developed for this study. 210 horses and 858 cats and dogs were tested, yielding further horseassociated hepaciviruses but none in dogs or cats. The rodent viruses were equidistant to HCV, exceeding by far the diversity of HCV and the canine/equine hepaciviruses taken together. Five full genomes were sequenced, representing all viral lineages. Salient genome features and distance criteria supported classification of all viruses as hepaciviruses. Quantitative RT-PCR, RNA in-situ hybridisation, and histopathology suggested hepatic tropism with liver inflammation resembling hepatitis C. Recombinant serology for two distinct hepacivirus lineages in 97 bank voles identified seroprevalence rates of 8.3 and 12.4%, respectively. Antibodies in bank vole sera neither cross-reacted with HCV, nor the heterologous bank vole hepacivirus. Co-occurrence of RNA and antibodies was found in 3 of 57 PCR-positive bank vole sera (5.3%). Our data enable new hypotheses regarding HCV evolution and encourage efforts to develop rodent surrogate models for HCV.",

            "text": "Hepatitis C virus is one of the leading causes of human morbidity and mortality due to hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma [1, 2, 3] . It has become the main reason for liver transplantation in developed countries and represents an economic burden exceeding 1 billion US$ of direct health costs [4, 5] . New estimates of the burden of disease suggest at least 185 million individuals worldwide to have been seropositive in 2005, with a tendency to increase [6] . Treatment has considerably improved due to the optimization of antiviral regimens and the advent of new antiviral drugs [7, 8, 9] . However, treatment in resource-limited settings is hardly accessible [10] . The most effective instrument to prevent new infections with HCV would be a prophylactic vaccine. Unfortunately, chimpanzees are the only known animal species to adequately reflect human HCV infection [11] . Vaccine development is hampered by the lack of a small animal model accessible at early stages of vaccine development [12, 13] . Mice cannot be infected with HCV [14] , but rats and mice engrafted with human hepatoma cells or transgenic for human CD81 and other co-receptor molecules have been proposed [12, 15, 16, 17] . Mouse-adapted HCV has also been generated [16, 18] . Still, these models are highly demanding from a technical point of view and reflect only parts of the pathogenesis and lifecycle of HCV, precluding their wide application [12, 19] .",

We have recently demonstrated that the systematic investigation of small mammal reservoirs can yield novel viruses that are genetically closely related to human pathogenic viruses, such as the paramyxoviruses mumps and Nipah virus [25] . Biological and ecological considerations direct research interests to animals with properties supportive of virus maintenance. The close social interaction of certain bat species forming large and dense social groups favors virus maintenance [25, 26] . Virus spreading by bats may be facilitated by their migratory lifestyle, but also by human activities such as hunting of bats as bushmeat and human invasion of remote habitats [27, 28, 29] . Several rodent species are also in focus as potential virus reservoirs, as they constitute habitat generalists and follow human civilization, providing opportunities for virus transmission [30, 31] . Even though rodents form smaller social groups than bats, some rodent species have a high population turnover, which should enable efficient maintenance of viruses through the continuous replenishment of susceptible individuals [26, 32] . Among terrestrial mammals, rodents and bats together constitute about two thirds of the 5,487 known mammalian species [33] . Screening of wild mammals with a view on laboratory models should be oriented by criteria such as small body size and the ability to adapt to laboratory conditions, which applies to rodents, but not bats [12, 34] . Here we have investigated 7,709 bats and rodents pertaining to 92 species sampled globally in ten tropical and temperate countries. The investigation was complemented by a comparison of virus diversity in 1,068 horses, cats and dogs.",

The lack of a small animal models represents an important hurdle on our way to understanding, treating, and preventing hepatitis C. The investigation of small mammals could identify virus infections similar to hepatitis C in animals that can be kept in laboratories, such as rodents, and can also yield insights into the evolution of those ancestral virus lineages out of which HCV developed. Here, we investigated a worldwide sample of 4,770 rodents, 2,939 bats, 210 horses and 858 cats and dogs for HCV-related viruses. New viruses were discovered in European bank voles (Myodes glareolus) and South African four-striped mice (Rhabdomys pumilio). The disease in bank voles was studied in more detail, suggesting that infection of the liver occurs with similar symptoms to those caused by HCV in humans. These rodents might thus enable the development of new laboratory models of hepatitis C. Moreover, the phylogenetic history of those viruses provides fascinating new ideas regarding the evolution of HCV ancestors. ",

Figure 2A exemplifies typical IFA reaction patterns observed. For confirmation, recombinant HCV western blot (WB) assays certified for diagnostic application in humans were adapted for use with bat and rodent sera. For 95 of the 180 bat sera, enough serum volume for WB testing was available. This included three of the 13 IFA-positive sera. As shown in Table 1 , between seven (Core) to 28 (NS3/Helicase) sera were clearly reactive with different WB antigens. 10 sera (10.6%) were to be interpreted as antibody-positive upon criteria for the interpretation of western blot results applicable in human diagnostics. Figure 2B provides examples of typical reaction patterns. The three IFA-positive sera were also positive in WB. For rodents, Table 1 shows that two (Helicase and NS4) to six (NS5B) sera reacted with individual antigens.

All genomes shared the typical hepacivirus polyprotein organization, encoding putative proteins in the sequence C-E1-E2-p7-NS2-NS3-NS4A/4B-NS5A-NS5B ( Figure 3B ). The putative structural C, E1, E2 and p7 proteins were predicted by signal peptidase cleavage site analysis (Supplementary Table S3 ) to be comparable in their sizes to that of known hepacivirus proteins. Placentalia (Eutheria) evolutionary lineages according to [76] . Major mammalian clades are identified at basal nodes of the Placentalia phylogeny: Afrotheria (e.g., elephants), Xenarthra, (e.g., anteaters) and Boreoeutheria, divided into the two superorders Euarchontoglires, (e.g., primates, rodents) and Laurasiatheria (e.g., dogs, bats). Sampled mammalian orders are shown in boldface type. Orders containing novel hepaciviruses identified in this study are shown in red and boldface. Orders with known hepaciviruses (perissodactyla, primates, carnivora) are given in red. Numbers of extant families and species per order adapted from [33] All rodent viruses had considerably fewer predicted glycosylation sites in their structural proteins, in particular their putative E2 proteins, as opposed to HCV. A detailed genome analysis is provided in Figure 3B . The 59-terminus of the core gene of the R. pumilio hepacivirus clade contained a putative adenosine-rich slippery sequence at codons 10-14 (AAAAAAAACAAAAA, Supplementary Figure 3B) . In HCV, a very similar sequence (AAAAAAAAAACAAA), located at nearly the same positions (codons 8-12) of the core gene induces production of a protein termed F in vitro due to ribosomal frameshift event [49] . Depending on the HCV genotype, the size of the F protein ranges from 126 to 162 amino acid residues which vary considerably in sequence composition [50] . The size of a putative F protein in SAR46 would be 65 amino acid residues and no homology to the HCV F proteins was observed.",

Figure 5 and Supplementary Figure S2A show that the 59genome terminus of RMU10-3382 contained structural elements typical of both pegi-and HCV-like internal ribosomal entry sites (IRESs). Predicted structural similarities with the HCV-like IRES included the first stem-loop element (termed Ia and highlighted in orange in Figure 5 ) and one of two sites involved in miRNA122 binding [51] , while most of the remaining stem-loop elements (termed 3, 4 and 5 and highlighted in blue in Figure 5 ) were more closely related to a pegivirus-like IRES. The 59-end of AP-70 was identical in structure to RMU10-3382 and contained only a few nucleotide exchanges. SAR-46 contained the typical HCV-like IRES structures including the characteristic stem-loop III ( Figure 5 and Supplementary Figure S2B) . The observed structural similarity between the first stem-loop of all rodent viruses described here and the prototype hepaciviruses HCV and GBV-B consisted of a hairpin with a six-nucleotide stem and fourfive nucleotide loop. The equine/canine hepaciviruses contained a similar structural element located as their second predicted IRES domain, instead of the most 59-position this domain occupied in all other hepaciviruses. The RMU10-3382 and NLR-365 translation initiation sites contained a cytosine immediately following the putative start codon at position +4, which is suboptimal in the original Kozak sequence context (ACCATGG) but should not block initiation [52] . The 39-ends of RMU10-3382 and SAR-46 contained three highly ordered stem-loop elements. In RMU10-3382, these RNA elements did not resemble any known 39noncoding sequence RNA structure. In SAR-46, the 39-terminal stem-loop structure, but not the preceding structures, resembled that of the HCV X-tail ( Figure 5 and Supplementary Figure  S3) . A similar 39-terminal structure could be predicted for GBV-B, but not for the genetically related pegiviruses ( Figure 5 and Supplementary Figure S4) . The 39-end of NLR-AP-70 could not be determined. Contrary to HCV and GBV-B, no poly-uracil stretch was observed in the rodent hepaciviruses.",

Maximal distances within the genera Pegivirus (52.9%) and Pestivirus (42.0%) are even lower, suggesting a particularly high diversity to exist in a tentative genus defined by the novel clade. Whereas this indicates that some or all of the novel rodent viruses together with GBV-B might alternatively form an independent genus, recent descriptions of novel pegi-and pestiviruses in bats and swine suggest the diversity also within these genera to be understudied [48, 57, 58] .",

While this is lower than the 85-88% between other pairs of genera, it is consistent with a separation threshold of 72.2% between all members of the genus Flavivirus and Tamana bat virus, for which a separate genus has been proposed [59] . This also corresponds to inter-generic distances within other well-studied families of plus-strand RNA viruses such as the Picornaviridae, whose twelve genera are mostly separated by 70-80% in the RdRp-encoding 3D gene [60] . The HCV 1a H77 (GenBank, NC_004102) . GenBank accession numbers of reference hepaciviruses are indicated to the right of taxon names. Tree topology was inferred using BEAST with a GTR nucleotide substitution model as described in the methods section. Rodent hepaciviruses from this study are shown in red and boldface, equine hepaciviruses from this study are shown in blue and boldface. Red squares indicate those viruses whose near full-length genomes were generated. Statistical support of grouping is shown as posterior probabilities at deep nodes. Scale bar corresponds to genetic distance. To the right, 5,000 tree replicates of the same analysis are rendered using Densitree (initial 5,000 trees discarded as burn-in). Green line color indicates low probability of all trees, line thickness corresponds to concordant topologies across tree replicates. B. Genome organization of the novel rodent hepaciviruses. Genes were annotated as described in the methods section. Black arrows on the top indicate predicted signal peptidase cleavage sites. Red arrows below indicate N-, blue arrows O-glycosylation sites. Putative gene starts and ends are numbered below polyprotein plots. HCV 1a strain H77 is depicted on top as a reference. RMU10-3382 (KC411777) also represents the highly similar virus NLR-365 ( For the Bayesian phylogeny shown to the left, the WAG amino acid substitution model was used in MrBayes as indicated in the methods section. Statistical support of grouping from Bayesian posterior probabilities is indicated at node points. Scale bar corresponds to genetic distance. The Pestivirus BVDV (NC_001461) was chosen as an outgroup and truncated for graphical reasons. Branches leading to the novel hepaciviruses from this study are in orange. GenBank accession numbers of analyzed hepaciviruses correspond to those indicated in Figure 3A .

Positive staining is visible as distinct red granules in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes. Magnification was 1006, the inserts shows details of single hepatocytes in 106 higher magnification. Scale bars are shown to the lower right. C. Histopathology of M. glareolus liver specimens. Liver sections were stained by Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) and Epson van Giesson (EvG) stains. In H&E stains, black arrows point to inflammatory lymphocytic infiltrate. In EvG stains, black arrows highlight potential signs of fibrosis. Specimen 3180 shows intermediate portal inflammatory lymphocytic activity with potential low-grade fibrosis in a case with high hepacivirus RNA concentrations (1.5610 8 copies/gram). Specimen 1602 shows low-grade portal inflammatory activity and low-grade fibrosis in a case with high hepacivirus RNA genomic organization of the novel viruses provides additional criteria for tentative classification. Like all hepaciviruses and in contrast to all members of the genus Pegivirus, the novel viruses have a discernible core gene [61] . In contrast to the genus Pestivirus [62] , their genomes contained no putative N pro and E rns genes in any reading frame. Finally, in contrast to the genus Flavivirus [63] , all rodent viruses showed IRES secondary structures in their 59genome termini. Some of the novel rodent IRES structures appeared to contain both elements related to type 3 IRES known from hepaci-and pestiviruses and type 4 IRES known from pegiviruses. Additionally, both M. glareolus rodent hepacivirus polyprotein clades were preceded by predominantly pegivirusrelated IRES structures, while the R. pumilio hepacivirus clade was preceded by a predominantly hepacivirus-related IRES. This may be compatible with ancient recombination events between Flaviviridae genera, a phenomenon known in the family Picornaviridae [64, 65] .",

The F protein appears to be unessential for HCV replication, but the evolutionary conservation of its ORF suggests that it may play a critical regulatory role in virus propagation and survival [50] . In this regard, the F protein may be considered a counter-defensive security protein that evolved to overcome mechanisms of host resistance [66] . The absence of paramount features typical of other genera and the presence of hepaciviruslike features suggest a tentative classification of the novel rodent viruses within the genus Hepacivirus, rather than a novel genus.",

Weakness of resolution in deep bifurcations of the NS3 gene phylogeny and lack of any highly significant preference for deep topological hypotheses in the NS5B gene phylogeny underline the ancestral origin of these viruses. Within the current dataset we can consider them equidistant from HCV and the canine/equine hepaciviruses, suggesting existence of independent taxonomic entities. HCV is one viral species whose genotypes are separated by more than 30% genomic nucleotide distance [67] , which corresponds to about 22-31% AA distance. Different species within the related sister genus Pegivirus, such as GBV-C and GBV-A, are separated from each other by about 45% AA distance [68] . Within the Genus Flavivirus, well-defined species such as dengue virus 1, West Nile virus, yellow fever virus and tickborne encephalitis virus are separated from each other by 48-60% AA distance. Comparing these values we could putatively assume that both Myodes-associated clades distant from each other by 70% AA sequence, as well as the Rhabdomys-associated clade separated from both of the aforementioned by 66-69% AA sequence, might form three distinct species. The canine/equine hepacivirus clade separated from HCV by 52-53% AA sequence would then also form a separate species. Furthermore, all rodent hepacivirus clades and specifically M. glareolus hepacivirus clade 2 were slightly more related to GBV-B than to HCV. GBV-B causes hepatitis in experimentally infected New World primates but not in humans and chimpanzees [61] . The true host of this virus is unknown, but our findings suggest that GBV-B might originate from rodents. Nevertheless, the genetic distance of GBV-B even to its closest relative, the Myodes hepacivirus clade 2 (63% AA sequence), suggests GBV-B to remain a solitary representative of a separate species of hepaciviruses.",

Additionally, horses but not dogs had antibodies against those viruses [24] . In the present study we augmented the number of studied dogs and horses considerably, and investigated cats in addition as these are related in the order of carnivores and have shared domestic habitats with dogs over a long history. The complete absence of viruses in cats and dogs, and the confirmation of highly similar viruses in other geographic regions, here and in another recent study [69] , suggest an actual equine association of the canine/equine clade. Whether acquisition of viruses might have occurred during the domestication of horses, or whether a more generic viral association with the equine stem lineage may exist, could be clarified by testing nondomestic equids such as wild asses or zebras. However, the overall phylogenetic position and monophyly of equine viruses suggest no role as ancestral hepacivirus hosts for horses. While the rodent hepaciviruses greatly extended the genetic diversity of the genus Hepacivirus, their role in the evolution of HCV precursors, if any, remains to be determined.",

Viruses from all Flaviviridae genera including Pegivirus, Pestivirus and Flavivirus have already been found in bats [48, 70, 71] . We could not exclude that the antibodies in bat sera reacting with HCV antigens were directed against viruses from other Flaviviridae genera, rather than bat hepaciviruses. However, there was no cross-reactivity between the NS3 proteins of the more closely related canine/equine hepaciviruses and HCV [24] . Similarly, the two bank vole hepacivirus clades from our study showed no serologic cross-reactivity. These data can therefore serve as very initial suggestions for the existence of bat hepaciviruses only. It should be noted that the degree of genomic similarity necessary for serologic cross-reactivity should have permitted RNA detection by the broadly reactive PCR assays used in this study. Whether bat hepaciviruses indeed exist will therefore require further evidence. A first step to this direction may be an analysis of an expanded bat sample by using the methods presented here.",

The detection of non-identical virus sequences in natural groups of animals, in combination with specific antiviral antibodies, proves continuous transmission of virus among animals. Induction of controlled infections in housed animals should thus be feasible. We found clear in-vivo evidence for hepatic tropism by demonstrating histopathological signs of liver inflammation, concentrations (3.4610 8 copies/gram). Specimen 3187 shows no significantly increased inflammatory activity and no signs of fibrosis in a case with no detectable hepacivirus RNA. Due to highest tissue quality, a terminal hepatic venule instead of a portal triad is shown. D. Recognition of rodent hepacivirus clade 1 antigens by M. glareolus serum. VeroFM cells expressing complete NS3 from M. glareolus hepacivirus RMU10-3382 (GenBank, KC411777) were incubated with 1:2000-diluted rabbit-anti-NS3 3382 antiserum (control) or 1:50-diluted rodent serum (picture shows exemplary results for animal NLR 3/C12), followed by goat-anti-rabbit-Cy2 (green) and goat-anti-mouse-Cy3 (red) secondary immunoglobulins. For colocalization analysis of fluorescence signals, the 6th of 12 1-mM Z-stags is shown for every channel. Cross-reactivity with HCV antigens was analyzed by incubation of HuH7 cells, transfected with HCV replicon JFH1, with a rabbit-anti-human-HCV-NS3-49 serum, diluted 1:400 (control) or rodent serum NLR 3/C12 diluted 1:50, followed by goat-anti-rabbit-Cy2 (green) and goat-anti-mouse-Cy3 (red) secondary antibodies.

Bar, 25 mm. doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1003438.g006 excessive viral RNA concentrations in the liver, as well as in-situ hybridizations demonstrating intracellular genome replication in liver cells of bank voles. A somewhat lower degree of hepatic inflammation compared to that in some HCV-infected humans might be due to the shorter life span of bank voles rarely exceeding 1-2 years in the wild, or due to a higher capacity of tissue regeneration [72, 73] . Interestingly, our serological investigations suggested bank voles might be able to clear hepacivirus infections, as antibodies did not co-occur with RNA in most, but not all animals [1] . Bank voles may therefore be more capable of clearing hepacivirus infection than humans. This would be compatible with infection patterns also observed in other Flaviviridae members, exemplified by the flavivirus West Nile virus in rhesus macaques, the pestivirus BVDV1 in cattle and the hepacivirus GBV-B in experimentally infected tamarins [61, 74, 75] . However, it would differ from equine hepaciviruses, in which RNA and antibodies cooccurred [24] . Controlled infection experiments in bank voles might yield relevant scenarios for the study of HCV persistence. Bank voles can be kept in the laboratory with comparatively little effort and have been used for virus infection studies, e.g., with herpesviruses, bornaviruses, hantaviruses, and flaviviruses [53, 54, 55, 56] . Efforts to establish bank vole infection models may benefit from the discovery of two highly divergent clades in this species. Knowledge of three full genomes in total should enable efficient rescue of virus from cDNA. Notably, the Rhabdomys-associated virus clade has a host in even closer relationship (on subfamily level) to Mus musculus commonly kept in laboratories, for which powerful technologies such as gene knock out and in-vivo imaging exist. Also for this virus clade, two different full genomes have been determined. In the present study focusing on viral ecology, however, we have not conducted infection or virus rescue trials in cell cultures or animals. Due to the strict liver tropism those viruses can be expected to be as difficult to cultivate as HCV, and we currently lack any possibilities to generate primary Myodes hepatocytes. The housing of those animals is in preparation, as are attempts to rescue fully sequenced viruses by reverse genetics. Additionally, our finding of presence of hepaciviruses in the Murinae subfamily have triggered more targeted ecological investigations to potentially identify viruses from hosts in even closer relationship to Mus musculus. The availability of rodent surrogate models of HCV infection may obviate one of the most critical obstacles to HCV vaccine development by obviating the need for primate experiments in early stages of experimentation [12, 34] . Figure S1 BEAST polyprotein phylogeny including the novel rodent hepaciviruses. The complete polyprotein sequence of all hepaciviruses was analyzed in BEAST [37] using the FLU amino acid substitution matrix and a strict clock over 10,000,000 trees sampled every 1,000 generations. After exclusion of 2,500 trees as burn-in, all trees are depicted using Densitree [39] . Blue color corresponds to most probable topologies, red to second-best, green to third-best and dark green to remaining topologies. First round RT-PCR reactions were used a touchdown protocol with reverse transcription at 48u for 30 minutes, denaturation at 95u for 3 minutes, followed by PCR 10 cycles of 15 sec at 94uC, 20 sec at 60uC with a decrease of 1uC per cycle, and extension at 72uC for 45 seconds, followed by another 40 cycles at 50uC annealing temperature. Second round reactions used the same cycling protocol without the RT step. RNA quantification was performed in 25 mL reaction volumes using the SSIII One-Step RT-PCR system (Invitrogen) as described above with 300 nmol/L of respective forward and reverse primers and 200 nmol/L of respective probes. Amplification involved 15 min at 55uC; 3 min at 95uC; 45 cycles of 15 sec at 94uC, and 25 sec at 58uC. Fluorescence was measured at the 58uC annealing/extension step. Published assays from which oligonucleotide primers were used in this study included [35, 79, 80, 81, 82] . (DOC) Table S3 Putative cleavage sites for cellular signal peptidases within the N-terminal half of hepacivirus polyproteins. NN: neural networks; HMM: hidden Markov models (the values represent probabilities for putative SP cleavage sites). Only SP cleavage sites predicted by both NN and HMM were considered. All scores were re-calculated upon putting a suggested cleavage site at amino acid position 20 of a query polypeptide. *Y-scores were zero for these sites, however they were supported by uncorrected S-scores (not shown). Hepaciviruses included were SAR46 (KC411807) and SAR3 (KC411806) from Rhabdomys pumilio, RMU10-3382 (KC411777), NLR-365",
