A bio-inspired modeling pathway is used to generate plausible computational models of the two TMDs forming the monomeric protein model. A flexible region between Leu-13 and Gly-15 is identified for TMD1 1-32 and a region around Gly-46 to Trp-48 for TMD2 36-58 . Mutations of the tyrosine residues in TMD2 36-58 into phenylalanine and serine are simulated to identify their role in shaping TMD2. Lowest energy structures of the two TMDs connected with the loop residues are used for a posing study in which small molecule drugs BIT225, amantadine, rimantadine and NN-DNJ, are identified to bind to the loop region. BIT225 is identified to interact with the backbone of the functionally important residues Arg-35 and Trp-36.",

Software has been developed which allows small sized proteins to be 'built' with high resolution (Rohl et al. 2004a; Rohl et al. 2004b; Kim et al. 2004; Kaufmann et al. 2010) . Building assemblies of small membrane proteins, approaches have been adopted which include a combination of molecular dynamics simulations and docking protocols in various ways (Bowie 1997; Kukol & Arkin 1999; Kerr et al. 1996; Forrest et al. 2000; Cordes et al. 2001; Bowie 2005; Patargias et al. 2006; Psachoulia et al. 2008; Park et al. 2012) . A major obstacle, is to assemble proteins with oligomeric TMD topology. Simplified, but nevertheless bio-inspired routes have to be defined while assembling the proteins using a computational approach .",

            "text": "The routes of assembly are guided by the knowledge of how membrane proteins are inserted or 'folded' into the lipid membrane. Membrane proteins are translated at the endoplasmic reticulum with the help of translocons (Johnson & van Waes 1999; Rapoport et al. 2004; Cheng & Gilmore 2006) . The translocons are membrane spanning proteins which enable the primary sequence of a membrane protein to be folded into the secondary structure within the hydrophobic environment of the lipid membrane. The topology of the respective membrane protein is generated according to the information encoded in its primary sequence (von Heijne 1988; Hessa et al. 2005; Fink et al. 2012 ). The protein is then finally released into the lipid bilayer. The 'monomeric unit' is the protein, which needs to be assembled further into the quaternary fold. Within the lipid membrane, the fold of a helical motif is adopted by the membrane protein prior to any consecutive steps like assembly or integration of co-factors (Popot & Engelman 1990; Engelman et al. 2003) . Therefore, once the secondary structure is formed, the protein remains in this fold. Viral channel forming proteins (Fischer & Sansom 2002; Gonzales & Carrasco 2003; Nieva et al. 2012) are candidate proteins which can be built along these considerations using computational techniques ). Viral channel forming proteins are found as bitopic and polytopic membrane proteins with up to three TMDs Wang et al. 2010) . What they all have in common, is their existence as homo-oligomers with a minimum number of four monomeric units in order to be totally functional. Their biophysical role is identified as to alter chemical or substrate gradients across the lipid bilayer. However, the function within the infectivity cycle of the individual viruses still remains mostly to be discovered.",

Detailed NMR experiments identify TMD1 consisting of two helical parts including the first 15 residues (Cook & Opella 2011; Montserret et al. 2010) , as well as TMD2 (Cook & Opella 2011) . The oligomeric state of p7 is suggested to be hexameric based on electron microscopic data (Griffin et al. 2003; Luik et al. 2009 ), with a potential to form heptameric assemblies as well (Clarke et al. 2006) . It is most likely, that there is a strong strain specific aspect to assembly and drug sensitivity (StGelais et al. 2009 ). In a NMR spectroscopic study an all atom hexameric bundle structure is reported for the first time (OuYang et al. 2013) . Computational methods have been done to generate a hexamer (Patargias et al. 2006) . Conductance studies with liposome based essays of a set of mutant p7 reveal a concerted action of all structural elements (StGelais et al. 2007) . The TMDs and the basic loop are important for the proper functioning of the channel.",

A third site at the C-terminus of TMD2, found for the structure taken from 0 ns, is not identified after 150 ns. The best poses with M NL show that the pyrazol group establishes hydrogen bonds with the side chain of Arg-35 and the backbone nitrogen of Trp-36. The backbone is shown in yellow for all structures. TMD1 1-32 is shown at 0 ns and 100 ns, as well as in different perspectives and with some residues indicated (D). Histidine (red), phenylalanines (green), tyrosines (dark blue), tryptophans (magenta), methionine (pink), valines (white), glycines (black), leusines (light blue) and serines (orange) are marked in stick modus. Water molecules are drawn in blue, using a ball-stick modus. Lipids are omitted for clarity. The bar in (D) indicates the backbone exposed side of the helix to the membrane.

Refined calculations do not replace the best poses. The sites of amantadine at different structures of M NL are identified to be with the N-terminus of TMD2 for the best pose of the structure at 0 ns, but found at the N (TMD1)/C-terminal sides (TMD2) in the structure at 150 ns, forming hydrogen bonds with the backbone (data not shown). In the presence of the loop (M L ), amantadine also poses at the site of the loop ( Figure 5B ). With M L , amantadine forms hydrogen bonds with the backbone carbonyls of residues from TMD1 (Cys-27, Tyr-31, Leu-32 (structure at 0 ns) and Leu-32, Lys-33 (structure at 150 ns). The best pose of binding of rimantadine with M NL is identified to be via its amino group, with the backbone carbonyl of either Trp-48 (0 ns structure) or the hydroxyl group of the side chain of Ser-12 (150 ns structure) (data not shown). The best pose for rimantadine in M L is with the backbone of Phe-26, which is within the TMD (structure at 0 ns) and the backbone of Trp-36, which is within the loop of the structure at 150 ns ( Figure 5C ). The second best pose with the 150 ns structure is found to be towards the Cterminal side of TMD2. In all cases, the binding affinities for amantadine and rimantadine are in the range of \u221210 kJ/mol to 0 kJ/mol (Table 2) . For amantadine docked to M NL , the order reverses position 2 and 3 for rimantadine (0 and 150 ns structure). For amantadine docked to M L , the order reverses for the structure at 0 ns. At this second site (first in respect to HYDE), the interaction is driven by hydrogen bonding of the amino group of amantadine with the backbone carbonyls of His-17 and the hydroxyl group in the side chain of Ser-12 (data not shown). For the M L structure at 150 ns with rimantadine, the third pose becomes the best one when recalculating the energies with HYDE. In this pose, hydrogen binding of the amino group of rimantadine with the carbonyl backbone of Tyr-33 together with hydrophobic interactions between adamantan and the aromatic rings of Tyr-42 and \u221245 (data not shown) is found.",

The hydrogen bonding of Tyr-42 serves as an acceptor for two off the hydroxyl groups of the ligand. The carbonyl backbone of His-17, as well as the backbone NH groups of Gly-15 and Leu-19 both serve as hydrogen acceptors and donors, respectively, in TMD1 at 150 ns. Based on the refined calculation of the binding affinities, the best poses based on FlexX of \u22122.0/-8.2 kJ/mol (0 ns structure) and \u22120.9/-8.0 kJ/mol (150 ns structure)) become the second best for both structures, when recalculating with HYDE (\u22121.1/-21.9 kJ/mol (0 ns) and \u22120. of Phe-26 and Gly-39 in the 0 ns structure ( Figure 5D ).

The kink angle is increased when mutating the hydrophobic residue Phe-44 into tyrosine. The increase of the kink occurs due to the 'snorkeling' of the tyrosines for the hydrophilic head group region and the aqueous phase. The snorkeling effect (usually used in context with lysines (Strandberg & Killian 2003) ), is accompanied by a further insertion of the rest of the part of the helix which is directed towards the other leaflet into the hydrophobic part of the membrane. Removing the hydroxy groups, as in TM2-Y42/45F, reduces the snorkeling and with it the kink and tilt. Smaller hydrophilic residues, such as serines, do not have a big impact on either the kink or the tilt angle of the helix. Serine rather forms hydrogen bonds with the backbone to compensate unfavorable interactions with the hydrophobic environment of the lipid membrane, than to interact with the lipid head groups and water molecules (after a while). It is concluded, that hydrophilic residues, accumulated on one side of a TM helix, lead to attract water molecules to compensate for hydrogen bonding and charges, and a tearing further into the hydrophobic core region of its other side. The consequence is a considerable kink or bend of the helix. In the monomer, the bending of TMD2 is preserved, when running the monomer with a linker.",

The four segments can be distinguished by their mobility. NMR data allow the statement, that segments from residue 5 -15 (TMD1) and from 41 -48 (TMD2) are more mobile than segments 17 -27 (TMD1) and 49 -57 (TMD2). The latter two segments adopt measurable tilts of 25\u00b0and 10\u00b0, respectively. In the present study, TMD1 10-32 includes residues 10 -15 of the reported experimental study. The w-shaped RMSF plots, calculated from MD simulations of the individual helices, support the experimental results of 4 segments separated by higher fluctuating residues ( Figure 1B , I). The 'separating' residues are around Val-20/Ser-21/Phe-22 for TMD1 10-32 , Ala-14 for TMD1 1-32 and the GMW-motif for TMD2. Whilst the residues in TMD1 10-32 are shifted by one helical turn towards the C-terminus compared to the NMR data, the residues in TMD1 1-32 and TMD2 36-58 almost match the residues found in the NMR experiments. The separating residues in TMD2 are conserved in the simulations of the monomer with and without loop ( Figure 3B ). Simulations of the monomer with loop reveals fluctuations around Pro-38 within the N-terminal part of TMD2. This is similar to high fluctuations found in the simulations of M NL indicating higher mobility of this segment in accordance with the NMR findings. According to the MD simulations, TMD2 seems to adopt a larger tilt than TMD1 with a stronger kink of TMD2 than TMD1.",

The structural models of the individual TMDs have been subject of protein-protein docking using GRAMM program (Tovchigrechko & Vakser 2006) to generate a monomer.

Both of the sections are separated by a hairpin like motif. The computational model of the monomer has been run for 40 ns MD simulation (NAMD, CHARMM27) in a fully hydrated lipid bilayer.

Also, strain specific tests in cell culture reveal activity of these compounds (Griffin et al. 2008) . Resistant mutations, observed upon adminstration of the two typs of drugs affect residues (i) Leu-20 (into L20F) induced by adamantanes and (ii) Phe-25 (into F25A) induced by iminosugars (Foster et al. 2011 ). These sites are within TMD1. Application of a docking approach using Autodock, on a heptameric bundle and a monomer, support a potential binding site within the TM region of p7. The poly leusine motif (Leu-50 to Leu-55) has been identified to be sensitive to amantadine (Cook & Opella 2010) . In the present docking study, the site for amantadine interaction with p7 does not match these experimental findings (Cook & Opella 2010; StGelais et al. 2009; Griffin et al. 2008) .",

In case of the iminosugars, this site in the loop region is possibly less favorable than for BIT225, even though a number of hydrogen bonds can be formed. The disfavor may be because of the aliphatic chain of NN-DNJ, which has to cope with the unfavorable position. The chain could interact with hydrophobic pockets in the protein, though this comes with some entropic costs. For amantadine and rimantadines, the same situation may hold with some minor advantages in as much as the hydrophobic part of these molecules may not get many restrictions in conformational flexibility upon binding. In contrast to e.g. NN-DNJ, amantadine and rimantadine can form fewer numbers of hydrogen bonds, what then compensates the entropic costs arising for NN-DNJ upon binding. BIT225 seems as the most favorable molecule, in respect of entropic costs. Experiments with mutants in this region would be necessary to proof the proposed mechanism of binding. What do the results mean for a potential drug? The potent drug should interact with sensitive amino acids, preferentially with its backbone, in the loop region.",

Binding of any drug via interacting with the backbone of the protein would hamper the dynamics of the loop and with it, possibly, the free energy involved in the mechanism of function. In the specific case of BIT225, the interaction is indeed identified to be with the backbone of the highly important residues Arg-35. This may explain the successful antiviral activity of this compound compared to amantadine and one of its derivatives.",

According to the present study, the side chain residues are further responsible for the 'fine tuning' of the secondary structure.
