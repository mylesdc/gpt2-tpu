            "text": "Influenza virus remains a public health concern due to associated seasonal burden of disease and pandemic potential. 1, 2 Personto-person transmission occurs by direct and indirect contact, by droplets (particles \u226510 \u03bcm) and potentially through droplet nuclei (particles \u22645 \u03bcm) which may be inhaled into the lower airways. [3] [4] [5] [6] Lower respiratory tract infection is associated with increased disease severity and mortality compared to infection of the upper respiratory tract. 7, 8 Understanding determinants of influenza A virus (IAV) bioaerosol-mediated transmission including environmental factors such as RH and temperature is relevant to mitigating spread. 9,10 RH can influence virion size, infectivity, and bioaerosol sampler performance. Early work with IAV determined that infectivity was best maintained at lower RH conditions. 11 Noti et al also conducted experiments using simulated coughs and demonstrated that IAV aerosol infectivity was maximized at low RH. 12 Furthermore, Lowen et al suggested that IAV transmission is highest at low RH, moderate at high RH (65%), and lowest at an intermediate RH (50%) using the guinea pig model. 10 In addition, the range of RH may vary significantly depending on climate (temperate vs tropical) and setting (health care vs agricultural or wet markets). The overall effect of RH on IAV infectivity and transmission is still under investigation, but the effective performance of bioaerosol sampling devices at a range of RH is important for characterizing virus-laden bioaerosols under different conditions. An area of IAV research currently lacking attention is the effect of widespread non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and other antipyretic use on IAV emission by infected hosts. Early experiments indicated that influenza virus-infected ferrets treated with antipyretic compounds experienced increased nasal shedding, potentially leading to increased risk of transmission. 13 Assessing the burden of influenza virus in the air is technically and operationally challenging in real-world settings such as healthcare institutions. [15] [16] [17] Clinical and environmental studies have TA B L E 1 Summary of characteristics, inclusion rationale, and recommendations for the polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) filter, NIOSH cyclone sampler, and Andersen impactor 21, 32 utilized a range of instruments to determine the risk of exposure to virus-laden bioaerosols in health care and agriculture. [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] Limited study sizes underscore the need for consistent approaches across studies in similar settings in order to generate robust comparative data to form clearer conclusions. Bioaerosol sampling devices are essential to the investigation and characterization of IAV bioaerosol emissions and transmission. Many sampling devices have been employed to collect a number of different pathogens but were not explicitly designed for the collection of viruses and preservation of viral infectivity. The selection of a suitable bioaerosol sampling device is challenging since collection efficiency is influenced by the pathogen in question, sampler flow rate, the environment, sampling time, and other technical and operational aspects of each device.",

Ferrets were anesthetized with isoflurane and inoculated intranasally with 1 mL Cal/09 at 10 6 PFU diluted in PBS, then placed in a Caron 6030 environmental test chamber (environmental chamber; 58 \u00d7 65.5 \u00d7 75.7 cm; Figure 1B) at 20\u00b0C and 20% RH.

Data are presented as means \u00b1 SEM, n = 3 for each relative humidity condition, n.d., not detected indicates that under certain environmental conditions, it is possible to do so with dry or filter sampling, despite loss of infectivity due to aerosolization and/or sampling processes.IAV transmission is potentially enhanced at low temperature and low RH, while the reciprocal effect is observed when temperature and humidity increase.10,49,50 Under certain conditions, temperature and humidity may have limited or variable effects on transmission between animals. 11,51-53 Utilizing an established guinea pig model of transmission, 54 Lowen et al demonstrated that low RH (20%-30%) is optimal for influenza virus transmission. 55 Prussin et al also demonstrated the same influence of low RH on infectivity using bacteriophages. 50 Testing bioaerosol samplers under a range of IAV transmission conditions is essential for determining the usefulness of these sampling devices. Our data show RH had some effect on the ability of the PTFE filter and NIOSH cyclone sampler to detect viral RNA and infectious virus. A significant decrease in H3N2 influenza virus RNA collected by the NIOSH cyclone sampler at medium RH is in keeping with the results shown by Lowen et al and further demonstrates the influence of increasing RH on the collection of IAV from bioaerosols. The PTFE filter collected virus well under low and medium RH conditions but became saturated with liquid under high RH, representing a potential limitation. The NIOSH cyclone sampler performed similarly, but saturation was not a factor at high RH; viral RNA and infectious virus were collected across all RH conditions.High RHs can inhibit bioaerosol sampling devices through saturation with liquid, potentially affecting the ability to sample in tropical climates or humid environments such as sometimes seen in swine barns or poultry markets. Furthermore, there were variable quantities of viral RNA and infectious virus from particles collected by the NIOSH cyclone sampler during high RH conditions, potentially reflecting enhanced but varying degrees of virus aggregation and highlighting the difficulty of recovering material under these conditions. RH may influence both the characteristics of aerosolized viral particles as well as sampler performance, and unfortunately, we cannot be certain what the relative contribution of each potential factor is to the net collection of virus using an in vitro experimental F I G U R E 3 No difference was determined for weight change or viral load between untreated and treated ferrets.

Extensive work is still needed to better understand the relationship between NSAIDs and influenza virus replication and transmission to determine whether their use actually contributes to the spread of influenza virus. There were several limitations in this study, including the choice of bioaerosol sampling devices; glass liquid impingers were not included since their use in a clinical environment would be prohibited. The use of liquid media instead of solid agar in the plates of the Andersen impactor may also be problematic since the volume of liquid or agar present in each plate is critical for proper size fractionation of particles and the potential loss of liquid during the collection process may lead to a misrepresentation of particle size distribution. Kormuth et al recently demonstrated the limited influence of RH on the infectivity of physiologically relevant fine aerosols and droplets, 60 and in our study, virus for aerosolization was diluted in saline lacking physiological components of the extracellular matrix. Also, the evaluation of these samplers did not include characterization of precise performance parameters of each device, including limit of collection.

However, the difficulties with maneuvering the apparatus with liquid media while inside the environmental chamber make it vulnerable to pump damage. The Andersen impactor is therefore best suited for controlled, experimental settings. Contrary to the Andersen impactor, the PTFE filter and NIOSH cyclone samplers were easy to manipulate inside the environmental chamber (compact, lightweight, few parts). These devices can be fixed to walls for static sampling or worn by personnel for personal breathing zone sampling. These attributes combined with the ability to collect viral RNA, and infectious virus makes these samplers more feasible for assessing the burden of influenza virus in the air in various settings, and more conducive for use in multicenter studies.It has been suggested that anti-inflammatory NSAIDs such as meloxicam 57 may be associated with increased viral shedding of influenza virus; mathematical and experimental work suggest that suppression of fever can lead to increased influenza virus replication in the upper respiratory tract and consequently increased transmission.13,14,58 We leveraged these bioaerosol experiments to also investigate whether treatment with an NSAID affected bioaerosol emissions.
