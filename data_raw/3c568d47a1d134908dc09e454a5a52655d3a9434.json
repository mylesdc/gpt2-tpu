We therefore conducted this study to determine the burden of acute chest syndrome (ACS) and describe its clinical and therapeutic aspects among SCD children in Cameroon, a SSA country. Methods: This was a retrospective study carried-out from September 2013 to June 2014 at the SCD unit of the Mother and Child Centre of the Chantal Biya Foundation, a pediatric reference centre in Yaound\u00e9, Cameroon. We enrolled all SCD children with confirmed diagnosis of ACS, and recorded their clinical presentation at admission along with their evolution during hospitalization. Results: Twenty one cases of ACS were identified during the study period, from 338 hospitalizations of children with SCD. Ages ranged from 11 months to 16 years with a mean (standard deviation) of 5.5 (3.4) years, and a male/ female sex ratio of 3.2/1. We noticed relatively low levels of HbF, from 6.4 to 21.9 % with a mean of 14.6 % (6.0 %). The three main symptoms at admission were fever (90.5 %), cough (81 %) and chest pains (28.6 %). Two patients (9.5 %) developed ACS 2 days after admission. The mean values of leukocytes, neutrophils, serum CRP, serum LDH and hemoglobin were respectively 32479.4 (17862.3)/mm 3 , 23476 (11543.7)/mm 3 , 228.2 (132.6) mg/l, 3452.3 (2916.3) IU/l and 6.5 (1.2) g/dl. The main localizations of radiological alveolar consolidations were the lower lobes (90.5 %). Treatment associated broad-spectrum antibiotics (100 %), hydration (100 %), analgesics (43.2 %), whole blood transfusion (66.7 %), and oxygen supplementation (33.3 %). Blood transfusion significantly improved hemoglobin level (p = 0.039). The duration of hospitalization, the mean of which was 6.8 (3.1) days, was influenced by none of the tested variables (all p values > 0.05). Conclusion: ACS is frequent among SCD children in our milieu. Its etiologies seem to be multifactorial. Patients' parents should be educated to recognize early signs and symptoms of the disease, and consult rapidly. Additionally, clinicians must be trained to diagnose ACS, and manage it promptly and efficiently to avoid its related catastrophic consequences.",

In 1979, Charache et al. [13] first suggested using the term \"acute chest syndrome\" for this complication, acknowledging the difficulties in determining its pathogenesis. Till nowadays, the pathophysiology of ACS remains not fully elucidated, yet multiple risk factors have been identified including: male sex, younger age, higher steady-state of leukocyte counts and hemoglobin level, lower hemoglobin F (HbF) concentrations, previous history of ACS, history of asthma, active smoking or environmental smoke exposure. Furthermore, ACS may be more severe in individuals with HbSS as compared with HbSC disease [6, 7, [14] [15] [16] [17] .",

Two days after the fever had dropped, patients were switched to oral cephalosporin (cefixim) or amoxicillin accordingly, for a total duration of 10 to 14 days (both intravenously and orally). Two patients (9.5 %) initially placed on ceftriaxone were still presenting fever on the fourth day of antibiotherapy; they were subsequently switched to vancomycin for seven days with a good improvement. Adjuvant therapy included hyperhydration (100 %), paracetamol (100 %) for fever or pains, tramadol (42.9 %) and ibuprofen (23.8 %). Fourteen patients (66.7 %) were transfused with whole blood, and all of them concurrently received an anti-malarial treatment to prevent transfusion-transmitted malaria. All the seven patients (33.3 %) who presented signs of respiratory distress were placed on oxygen, its duration ranging from 1 to 5 days with a mean of 3.6 (1.6) days (Tables 2, 3 and 4) . A control full blood count was performed only by seven of our patients 48 h after blood transfusion (Table 3) . We did not find any statistical difference between the first and second leukocyte counts (p = 0.711), this being the same for neutrophil counts (p = 0.811). By contrast, we did notice a significant increase in hemoglobinemia (p = 0.039). The duration of hospitalization ranged from 3 to 12 days with a mean of 6.8 (3.1) days. One patient of the female sex died on the fourth day of hospitalization, hence a mortality rate of 4.8 % (Tables 2 and 4 ). While investigating factors that could have impacted the duration of hospitalization, we found that age, sex, regular follow-up, immunization status, duration of evolution of symptoms prior to consultation, transfusion, oxygen, and the antibiotic used were not implicated in the determination of duration of hospitalization (all p values > 0.05 as depicted by Table 5 ).",

This proportion is comparable to the 1.9 ACS episodes/month among hospitalized SCD children in Bruxelles [15] , and higher than the 1.4, 0.3 and 0.2 ACS episodes/month respectively reported in Brazzaville, Antananarivo and French Guiana [20] [21] [22] . However, our prevalence of ACS is lower than the 10-20 % rate of hospital admissions reported by Miller and Gladwin in their review [6] . Our prevalence may be an underestimate of the real burden of ACS among our children suffering from SCD for some reasons. First, hemoglobin electrophoresis is not systematically performed in our milieu, and many parents neither know their status nor that of their kids. As we considered only known SCD patients, some unknown SCD patients may have presented this condition and escaped from enrolment. Second, due to parents' financial constraints, we are used to performing just one chest x-ray during hospitalization. As a result, we could have missed all those whose first chest x-ray was normal but who developed ACS later on, given that radiographic findings in case of ACS may progress over time [9, 11, 23] . If it is true that a positive chest x-ray is the key element to define the disease [12] , there have been some claims that a single negative chest x-ray cannot exclude the disease [23] [24] [25] , taking into account that clinical assessment may appear inadequate to identify ACS [11] . It has been also suggested that every SCD patient presenting with fever must undergo a chest x-ray [11, 24] .",

In our study for instance, only 2 children (9.5 %) developed ACS 2 days after admission, and pains were concomitantly associated in 52.4 % of cases.

Actually, only patients presenting respiratory distress were placed on oxygen, mainly due to limitation of resources. Likewise, we transfused only SCD patients who had a hemoglobin level \u2264 7 g/dl given that blood safety remains an issue of major concern in the milieu [29] . Although transfusion did not reduce the hospital stay, it significantly increased the hemoglobin level (p = 0.039), perhaps improving therefore the clinical state of our patients. Early transfusion of SCD patients presenting with ACS should be encouraged in SSA settings, especially transfusion of packed red blood cells instead of whole blood to reduce transfusion-related adverse reactions, despite recurrent blood shortages that occur in the region [30] . Nonetheless, more studies are needed to underpin this suggestion with robust scientific evidence and indicate which threshold should be considered to transfuse SCD children suffering from ACS.",

Introduction of other supportive care in our practice like bronchodilators and incentive spirometry as elsewhere [6, 19] , along with systematic oxygen supplementation and early blood transfusion could substantially reduce the duration of hospital stay.

In fact, there is body of evidence bolstering that low dose dexamethasone (0.3 mg/kg/12 \u00d7 4 doses) significantly diminished the duration of hospital stay, the need for blood transfusion, oxygen and analgesics use, and duration of fever, without a rebound effect [31] which was observed with high dose methylprednisolone in cases of VOC [32] .",

Additionally, clinicians must be trained to correctly diagnose ACS, and manage it promptly and efficiently to avoid its related catastrophic consequences. Additive treatment such as incentive spirometry, bronchodilators and even low dose dexamethasone could perhaps be introduced in our settings to reduce the hospital stay and hasten recovery.
