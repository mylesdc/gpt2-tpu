            "text": "We have recently described sustained clinical recovery associated with dampened neuroinflammation and remyelination following transplantation of neural precursor cells (NPCs) derived from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) in a viral model of the human demyelinating disease multiple sclerosis. The hNPCs used in that study were derived by a novel direct differentiation method (direct differentiation, DD-NPCs) that resulted in a unique gene expression pattern when compared to hNPCs derived by conventional methods. Since the therapeutic potential of human NPCs may differ greatly depending on the method of derivation and culture, we wanted to determine whether NPCs differentiated using conventional methods would be similarly effective in improving clinical outcome under neuroinflammatory demyelinating conditions. For the current study, we utilized hNPCs differentiated from a human induced pluripotent cell line via an embryoid body intermediate stage (EB-NPCs). Intraspinal transplantation of EB-NPCs into mice infected with the neurotropic JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus (JHMV) resulted in decreased accumulation of CD4+ T cells in the central nervous system that was concomitant with reduced demyelination at the site of injection. Dampened neuroinflammation and remyelination was correlated with a transient increase in CD4+FOXP3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) concentrated within the peripheral lymphatics. However, compared to our earlier study, pathological improvements were modest and did not result in significant clinical recovery. We conclude that the genetic signature of NPCs is critical to their effectiveness in this model of viral-induced neurologic disease. These comparisons will be useful for understanding what factors are critical for the sustained clinical improvement.",

Early stages of the disease are characterized by transient inflammation and compensatory remyelination resulting in a cycle of descending neurologic dysfunction and limited recovery [1, 2] . However, endogenous myelin repair is not sustainable and ultimately gives way to a stage of chronic neurodegeneration and progressive accumulation of disability. Current FDA-approved disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) target the immune component of MS and have demonstrated effectiveness in reducing relapse rates, although this is often not sustainable [3] . However, the most commonly prescribed DMTs do not directly address white matter damage in the CNS and are consequently ineffective at treating advanced stages of MS. Therefore, there remains an unmet need for a treatment strategy that addresses inflammatory cell infiltration while promoting longterm remyelination.",

Importantly, recovery was facilitated by the emergence of immunosuppressive CD4+/CD25 +/FOXP3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) and was not dependent on long-term engraftment of the human NPCs. Thus, human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) may serve as an inexhaustible source from which to generate NPCs for the treatment of MS. For clinical cell therapy, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) may be preferable to hESCs, because they retain the genetic background of the donor, which may circumvent the requirement for immunosuppressant drugs that leave patients vulnerable to infection, tumor progression and re-activation of dormant viruses.",

Here we demonstrate that NPCs generated using a differentiation methodology that includes an embryoid body stage produce cells (EB-NPCs) with a unique gene expression profile and diminished clinical effect than the DD-NPCs derived by our previously published method. EB-NPC transplanted mice did not show a significant clinical improvement, but did exhibit dampened accumulation of CD4+ T cells in the CNS. Reduced T cell infiltration was correlated with focal remyelination and a transient increase in CD4+/FOXP3+ Tregs in draining cervical lymph nodes (CLNs). EB-NPCs induced the differentiation of na\u00efve CD4+ T cells into Tregs in vitro, and in vivo ablation of Tregs abrogated EB-NPC-induced histopathological improvement. These findings show that the gene expression profiles of hNPCs derived by different methods correlate with clinical effectiveness of the cells in a model of MS. Despite these differences, hNPCs derived using these distinct methods similarly promote the generation of anti-inflammatory Tregs, and assist in focal remyelination. These comparisons provide initial information about what specific characteristics make hNPCs effective for treatment of inflammation and demyelination in MS.",

For lentiviral transduction of the luciferase expression cassette, the pLenti CMV Puro LUC plasmid (Addgene) was packaged and viral particles collected as described in [14] . Once hiPSCs reached approximately 50% confluence in one well of a 6-well dish, viral supernatant was added to hiPSCs in culture with 10 \u03bcg/ml polybrene (Sigma). Cells were spun in the dish at 400RCF for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. After 48 h, 1 \u03bcg/ml puromycin was added to select for hiPSCs stably expressing luciferase. Transduced hiPSCs were maintained in 1 \u03bcg/ml puromycin and differentiated to NPCs according to established methods [17] . Briefly, feeder-free hiPSCs were dissociated using 0.5 mM EDTA (Thermo Fisher), transferred to ulta-low adherence 6-well plates, and cultured for 5 days in human ESC medium (DMEM/F12 + GlutaMAX, 20% Knockout Serum Replacement, 1X non-essential amino acids, and 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol; all from Thermo Fisher) supplemented with 500 ng/ml recombinant Noggin (R&D Systems) and 10 \u03bcM SB431542 (Tocris).

Increasing amounts of N2 medium (DMEM/F12 + GlutaMAX, 1X N2 supplement [Thermo Fisher]) supplemented with 500 ng/ml Noggin and 10 \u03bcm SB431542 were added every other day for 14-16 days.

Following puromycin selection, iPSCs constitutively expressing luciferase produced detectable photons in response to D-luciferin in vitro (Fig 1A) . Luciferase-expressing iPSCs were differentiated to NPCs as previously described [17] . This method results in heterogeneous cultures of neural stem and precursor cells, neural crest cells, and glial cells, and hPSCs exhibit variability in their potential to differentiate to NPCs [22, 23] . Therefore, differentiated cells were enriched for NPCs via flow cytometric sorting (FACS) using the markers CD24, CD184, CD271, and CD44 ( Fig 1B) [22, 24] . Isolation of CD184 +/CD24+/CD271-/CD44-cells resulted in a population highly enriched for the hallmark neural stem/precursor cell marker NESTIN (96.2% \u00b1 1.908; n = 3), and the majority of cells were double-positive for NPC markers SOX1 and SOX2 (92.3% \u00b1 4.349%; n = 3), with some cells expressing the dorsal forebrain marker PAX6 (Fig 1C and S1A-S1C Fig) . Furthermore, when sorted EB-NPCs were subjected to directed differentiation conditions for 14 days, markers indicative of neurons (Tuj1), astrocytes (GFAP), and oligodendrocyte lineages (NG2 and Olig2) were detected, confirming multipotency (S1D-S1G Fig) . Therefore, we use the term EB-NPC to describe a Nestin+/Sox1+/Sox2+ population with the capacity to differentiate into cells expressing markers restricted to neuronal, astroglial, or oligodendroglial lineages.",

After 3 days, an increase in the frequency and number of CD4+FOXP3+ Tregs was observed in cultures when activated T cells were co-cultured with EB-NPCs, but not when T cells were cultured in the absence of EB-NPCs (Fig 6A and 6B) . Furthermore, Treg induction was proportionate to the number of EB-NPCs and was concomitant with a decrease in conventional CD4+FOXP3-T cells (Fig 6C) . We previously demonstrated that in vitro Treg induction by NPCs produced by another method was dependent on secretion of the pleiotropic cytokine transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-\u03b2) [14] . However, compared to DD-NPCs, secretion of active TGF-\u03b21 or TGF-\u03b22 could not be detected in the culture media of EB-NPCs (S4 Fig) . Treatment with the monoclonal antibody PC61.5 (anti-murine CD25 rat IgG1) depletes CD4+FoxP3+ Tregs and is widely used to characterize Treg function in vivo [20, 21] . In order to evaluate the requirement of Tregs for remyelination following EB-NPC transplantation, mice were injected with PC61.5 at days -2, 0, and 2 p.t. Treatment with anti-CD25 resulted in a decrease in the frequency of circulating Tregs by day 3 p.t. that was sustained out to day 21 p.t., the day spinal cords were collected for histology (Fig 7A and 7B) . In vivo ablation of Tregs resulted in increased demyelination compared to non-treated EB-NPC transplanted animals (Fig 7C and 7D ).",

Principal component analysis of all genes with a variance of 0.3 or greater was used to examine the relationships among various preparations of cells (Fig 8A) .

All data is presented as average \u00b1 SEM and was analyzed using one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's multiple comparison test. (Fig 8B) .

NPCs derived from hESCs ameliorate the clinical course of EAE by modulation of peripheral T cells in affected mice [10] . However, as with fetal NPCs, the neuroprotective effect of transplanted hESC-NPCs in EAE was dependent on survival and migration of the xenograft. In contrast, we recently demonstrated that sustained clinical recovery could be achieved in spite of xenograft rejection following intraspinal injection of NPCs directly differentiated from hPSCs (DD-NPCs) in a virus-induced model of neuroinflammatory demyelination [14] . Suppression of lymphocyte infiltration was facilitated by local induction of Tregs, contradicting previous findings that hESC-NPCs must migrate to the peripheral lymphatic system and inhibit dendritic cell maturation or T cell activation in the lymph nodes for histologic improvement to be observed [10] .",

As with DD-NPCs, EB-NPCs were rapidly rejected following injection into the spinal cords of immunocompetent JHMV-infected mice, and no cellular migration to peripheral immune organs was observed. In spite of rejection, CD4+ T cell infiltration was muted in the CNS of EB-NPC-transplanted mice, which correlated with a transient induction of Tregs in the draining CLNs. Tregs, a T cell lineage essential to the establishment and maintenance of self-tolerance, have been shown to be protective in animal models of inflammatory and autoimmune disease, including EAE and JHMV-induced demyelination [27, 33] . Furthermore, NPCs have , data represents two independent experiments with n = 8 (EB-NPC alone), n = 9 (EB-NPC + IgG control), n = 9 (EB-NPC + PC61.5), and n = 8 (HBSS) animals per group.

Indeed, EB-NPCs induced conventional na\u00efve T cells to differentiate toward a Treg phenotype in vitro, and in vivo ablation of Tregs by monoclonal antibody blockade abrogated histopathological improvement in transplanted mice. Induction of Tregs and dampened accumulation of CD4+ effector T cells was accompanied by remyelination in the white matter tracts of EB-NPC injected animals. Remyelination was evaluated at the point at which EB-NPCs could no longer be detected in the CNS by immunohistochemical staining or in vivo imaging, suggesting that endogenous myelin regeneration, and not cell replacement by EB-NPCs, was responsible for the observed histologic improvement. Xenograft rejection has been proposed to foster limited remyelination following transplantation of human glialrestricted precursors in the JHMV model [36] . In this study, we did not observe enhanced remyelination or a reduction in infiltrating lymphocytes in animals transplanted with human fetal fibroblasts, confirming the specificity of EB-NPC-induced remyelination. Thus, xenoantigens alone are not sufficient to promote the focal remyelination induced by EB-NPCs. In contrast to our previous study using DD-derived NPCs, JHMV-infected mice transplanted with EB-NPCs did not display significant improvements in clinical outcome. There are several hypotheses that may explain observed differences in clinical improvement in our model, and of particular interest is the production of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-\u03b2) by NPCs. TGF-\u03b2 is a ubiquitous cytokine that exists in at least three isoforms: TGF-\u03b21, TGF-\u03b22, and TGF-\u03b23. Generation of induced Tregs from CD4+ precursors requires stimulation of the TGF-\u03b2 receptor, and TGF-\u03b22 triggers FOXP3 expression in conventional CD4+ T cells [37] . Using transcriptome analysis, Chen et al. (2014) observed upregulation of TGF-\u03b21 and TGF-\u03b22 in DD-NPCs, and secreted TGF-\u03b2 was detected in DD-NPC supernatants. Immunoassay of media collected from EB-NPC cultures did not detect TGF-\u03b21 or TGF-\u03b22, which may explain the different spatial and temporal dynamics of Treg induction, and lack of functional improvement, in EB-NPC-transplanted JHMV-infected mice. An additional pleiotropic cytokine that may contribute to immune modulation and repair in models of demyelination is leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). LIF promotes Treg induction mainly by suppressing differentiation of conventional CD4+ T cells to a pro-inflammatory phenotype [38, 39] . Moreover, LIF is secreted by transplanted murine NPCs and is proposed to be involved in NPC-induced neuroprotection in EAE [40, 41] . Similar to TGF-\u03b2, human LIF could not be detected in EB-NPC supernatants (data not shown). Thus, it is likely that the methods used to generate and isolate EB-NPCs in this study may have yielded a population of cells that lack the appropriate characteristics to confer significant and sustained repair in JHMV-infected mice.",
