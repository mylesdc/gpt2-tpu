This dichotomy is exemplified by cathepsin L (CTSL), which helps Hendra virus and SARS coronavirus to invade cells, but is essential for survival in mice with mycoplasma pneumonia. The present study tested the hypothesis that CTSL protects mice from serious consequences of infection by the orthomyxovirus influenza A, which is thought to be activated by host-supplied proteases other than CTSL. Ctsl -/mice infected with influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34(H1N1) had larger lung viral loads and higher mortality than infected Ctsl +/+ mice. Lung inflammation in surviving infected mice peaked 14 days after initial infection, accompanied marked focal distal airway bronchiolization and epithelial metaplasia followed by desquamation and fibrotic interstitial remodeling, and persisted for at least 6 weeks. Most deaths occurred during the second week of infection in both groups of mice. In contrast to mycoplasma pneumonia, infiltrating cells were predominantly mononuclear rather than polymorphonuclear. The histopathology of lung inflammation and remodeling in survivors was similar in Ctsl -/and Ctsl +/+ mice, although Ctsl +/+ mice cleared immunoreactive virus sooner. Furthermore, Ctsl -/mice had profound deficits in CD4+ lymphocytes before and after infection and weaker production of pathogen-specific IgG. Thus, CTSL appears to support innate as well as adaptive responses, which confer a survival advantage on mice infected with the orthomyxovirus influenza A.",

            "text": "Cathepsins are a group of proteolytic enzymes, classically lysosomal in origin, that vary in class, pH optimum, target specificity, inhibition and function. They are nearly universally expressed by eukaryotic organisms, in which they regulate a range of physiological processes, befitting their varied attributes and target preferences [1] . A subset of these proteases-the cysteinyl cathepsins-was characterized originally as being lysosomal in location and function. Later work uncovered additional roles in intracellular and extracellular locations [2] . Some of these enzymes cleave specific substrates involved in antigen presentation, collagen turnover in bone and cartilage, processing of endogenous bioactive peptides, and leukocyte penetration of cellular monolayers and matrix [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . The widely expressed cysteine protease cathepsin L (CTSL) is implicated in several types of pathology and is a potential pharmaceutical target for inhibition to control inflammation and counterproductive immune responses. For example, by cleaving viral proteins, CTSL helps Ebola, Hendra and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) viruses infect host cells, thereby advancing these infections [6] [7] [8] . On the other hand, in epithelial cells of the thymic cortex, CTSL plays a key role in removing the placeholder class II-associated invariant chain peptide, which is important for positive selection of CD4+ T cells that bind to MHC proteins on other cells. This role in T cell maturation can influence MHCrestricted presentation of and response to extracellular antigens, such as those from bacteria [9] .",

            "text": "Influenza A viruses are among the most common and pathologically significant causes of human respiratory infections. Influenza epidemics are associated with major spikes in mortality every year worldwide, and the fortunately rare but more severe pandemics caused by new forms of virus can be catastrophic. Influenza A can be prevented by vaccines, which, however, may be partially or completely ineffective if they lack major epitopes of strains that are prevalent in a given year. Antiviral treatments available for active infections caused by some strains of influenza A can reduce influenza severity and duration but often have limited efficacy. Among potential alternative approaches, protease inhibition is a potential strategy because cleavage of influenza virus surface hemagglutinin by host cell proteases is a prerequisite for infectivity and pathogenicity [11] . Several candidate influenza A-activating proteases have been identified [12, 13] , including the host epithelial protease TMPRSS2, which is influenza A strain-selective [14] [15] [16] . Most identified influenza virus-activating proteases are extracellular serine proteases of tryptic specificity. However, recent evidence suggests that calpains, which are non-cathepsin, neutral, cytosolic cysteinyl proteinases, promote influenza in mice, and that a calpain inhibitor reduces influenza-associated mortality [17] . The extent to which calpain effects are mediated by cleavage-activation of virus is not yet clear. Like calpains, CTSL is a cysteinyl proteinase but differs in having an acidic pH optimum that optimizes activity in lysosomes. CTSL cleaves some targets at tryptic sites, but also at non-tryptic sites, particularly in proteins co-localizing in lysosomes. Outside of the cell, CTSL activity is limited at the neutral to alkaline pH typical of extracellular environments and is opposed by extracellular inhibitors, the cystatins [1, 2] . On these grounds, we hypothesized that CTSL is less likely to be a major in vivo activator of influenza A than to support host defense against infection. This hypothesis predicts that influenza will be more severe in mice lacking CTSL. The present work tested this prediction by comparing immune and histopathological responses in virus-na\u00efve wild-type and CTSL-deficient mice.",

By 14 days after initial infection, tissues manifested focal epithelial metaplasia of airways, as well as alveolar bronchiolization in lung sections derived from both genotypes of surviving mice, with persistent patches of largely mononuclear inflammation (Fig 2 and S1 Fig). The areas of bronchiolization, which appeared to represent coverage by a monolayer of non-ciliated, cuboidal Clara-like cells, tended to produce tumor-like \"blooms\" sharply demarcated from adjacent normal lung (S2 Fig) . These appear to correspond to the keratin 5-positive \"pods\" observed by Vaughan, Kumar, and colleagues in H1N1-infected mice [19, 21] . At 42 days, this process appeared to have evolved by desquamation of regenerated epithelium, leaving cystic spaces that are likely incapable of gas transfer (Fig 2 and S1 Fig) . However, some regions of lung parenchyma were largely intact and unaffected in mice surviving infection. Masson's trichrome staining revealed fibrosis in some of the affected regions at 42 days. However, no differences in collagen deposition in airway walls or alveolar interstitium were observed between infected Ctsl +/+ and Ctsl -/mice, as shown in S3 Fig. These results reveal that influenza leads to lung remodeling that is present after immunohistochemical evidence of active infection has disappeared.",

In the example of Ebola virus, although certain cathepsins activate some forms of the virus in cell culture, mice genetically deficient in cathepsins are not protected from infection in vivo [24] , revealing that viral activation data generated in cell culture do not necessarily predict in vivo consequences. In this regard, the present study does not rule out the possibility that CTSL can activate influenza orthomyxoviruses, which require processing by host proteases to become infectious [11] .

            "text": "The higher mortality in infected Ctsl -/mice is likely to be related to the observed higher virus burden early after infection as well as the persistence of virus in later stages of infection, with consequently more severe and sustained damage to lung and airways. Although histopathological responses to infection were similar in Ctsl -/and Ctsl +/+ mice at intervals after infection, as reflected in the inflammation scores shown in Fig 2, dropout of mice dying from infection, via a survivor effect, may have caused underestimation of the severity of inflammation in the Ctsl -/cohort, which experienced greater mortality. Ultimately, poorer outcomes in Ctsl -/mice can be attributed to relative defects in innate immune and pathogen-specific adaptive responses, as suggested by lower titers of IgG in infected Ctsl -/mice relative to those in infected Ctsl +/+ mice. Given that some of the cited prior work suggesting that CTSL enhances non-influenza viral infectivity is largely based on observations in cultured cells, it is possible that in vivo infections by these or related viruses in Ctsl -/mice would be poorly tolerated due to immune deficits, notwithstanding any reductions in direct viral activation attributable to CTSL's absence. CTSL is required for degradation of the invariant chain in cortical thymic epithelial cells, such that Ctsl -/mice have decreased positive selection of developing CD4+ T cells. CTSL deficiency also alters the pool of peptides generated for MHC class II presentation. Thus, both quantitative and qualitative defects in the CD4+ T cell repertoire, as reflected by the profoundly depressed proportions of CD4+ splenocytes from Ctsl -/mice at baseline and after infection, may result in impairment in early host defenses. Although we did not detect a difference in the early type 1 interferon response, other types of impairment may have been present. For example, differences in nucleic acid-sensing surface proteins like toll-like receptor 7, which contributes to innate recognition of influenza virus RNA and cytokine production by infected macrophages [25] and is activated in part by CTSL [26] , also may contribute to the observed early deficit in control of influenza in Ctsl -/mice. In some cells, CTSL contributes to antigen processing prior to presentation with MHC II [27] , which could lead to defective cellular as well as primary humoral responses, in addition to the established influence of virus-specific CD4+ T cell responses on memory responses and long-term protective immunity [28] . The profoundly depressed proportions of CD4+ splenocytes from Ctsl -/mice at baseline and after infection may reflect generalized deficiency in development of CD4+ lymphocytes, with consequent impairment in early host defense. Such defects could include early responses involving innate, heterotypic, or \"pre-existing\" virus-specific CD4+ cells, which appear to protect humans from severe influenza in the absence of detectable pathogen-specific antibodies [29] , possibly by activating the recently recognized cytotoxic potential of CD4+ cells acting on MHC II-expressing epithelial cells [30] . Deficits of CD4+ T cells would also tend to limit their ability to augment killing efficacy of macrophages.",

However, in the mycoplasma study, no major difference between Ctsl +/+ and Ctsl -/mice in humoral responses to mycoplasma antigens was observed, as manifested by titers of antibodies in serum. Thus, mycoplasma and influenza pathogens may differ in the manner in which they provoke a humoral response. This may relate to M. pulmonis being an extracellular pathogen, whereas influenza A infects, kills and lyses target cells. Another overt difference between these two pathogens in mice is the primary nature of the evoked inflammation, which is largely neutrophilic for mycoplasma [10] and largely monocytic/lymphocytic for influenza A (this study). Differences in the inflammatory response could be associated with differences in modes of antigen processing and presentation, in turn yielding differences in cellular and humoral adaptive responses.",

However, many fatal cases of influenza in 1918 were associated with secondary bacterial pneumonia associated dense infiltration of lung parenchyma with neutrophils, which was not seen in our influenza-infected mice. Although the number of neutrophils retrievable by BAL increased in our infected mice and were higher at the 14-day time point in Ctsl -/mice than in Ctsl +/+ mice, neutrophils remained a small fraction of total leukocytes at all examined intervals after infection. Whether this represents fundamental differences between humans and mice in response to influenza A infection, differences in viral strains, a survivor effect (because human samples were exclusively obtained from individuals dying after infection), relative protection from bacterial infection by mice housed in barrier facilities, or a combination of these factors remains to be determined. In any case, the histopathology of lung parenchyma 6 weeks after infection suggests that some \"bronchiolized\" areas naturally evolve during the process of epithelial replacement and repair into cystic air spaces sometimes with surrounding fibrosis. These areas do not represent a return to normal alveoli, are likely non-functional, and may represent permanent damage to gas-exchanging surface of the lung, as may also occur in humans with severe influenza pneumonia and respiratory distress.",

            "text": "Overall, these results suggest a critical role for CTSL in containing airway influenza A infection in mice, in which influenza causes enduring structural changes to alveoli and small airways. Unlike its effect on some viruses, CTSL does not seem to augment influenza virus infectivity, as reflected by comparing viral titers and tissue viral immunoreactivity in Ctsl -/and Ctsl +/+ mice. However, Ctsl -/mice have defective immune responses, which may contribute to higher mortality after influenza compared to mortality in Ctsl +/+ mice. These findings also suggest that targeting CTSL for pharmacological inhibition as part of an anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressive or anti-viral strategy, such as suggested for SARS coronavirus, carries a potential risk of impairing host defense against orthomyxoviruses like influenza A. CD4 cells were counted as the number of CD45-and CD3-positive lymphocytes in a BAL fluid sample that were CD4-positive. CD8 cells were the number of CD45-and CD3-positive lymphocytes that were CD8-positive. NK cells were CD45-positive CD3-negative lymphocytes that were NK1.1-positive. Neutrophils were F/80-negative non-lymphocytes that were Gr-1-positive. Each data point represents measurement from lavage fluid from one mouse. Infected mice had been inoculated with influenza A 3 days prior to BAL. No significant differences were detected by t-test between infected groups at this time point. (TIFF)",
