Diabetes and hypercholesterolemia are also important clinical conditions that can predispose individuals to infection. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of rs12252 C polymorphism, BMI, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia with mild flu in an Iranian population. Methods: We conducted a case-control study, including 79 mild flu and 125 flu-negative individuals attending primary care centers of three provinces of Iran (i.e, Markazi, Semnan, and Zanjan). Pharyngeal swab specimens were collected from all participants, and were subjected to RNA and DNA extractions for Real-time PCR and PCR tests. All PCR products were then sequenced to find T/C polymorphisms in the rs12252 region. Data on demographic, anthropometric, and clinical variables were collected from participants' medical records available in the primary care centers. The data was analyzed using DNASIS (v. 2.5) and Stata (v.11) software. Results: All participants were of Fars ethnic background. The allele frequency for rs12252-C was found to be 9.49% among cases and 2.40% among controls. Carriers of the rs12252 C allele (CT + CC genotypes) showed 5.92 folds increase in the risk of mild flu comparing to the T allele homozygotes (P value: 0.007). We also found a significant positive association between rs12252 C allele heterozygote and mild flu (OR: 7.62, P value: 0.008), but not in C allele homozygote group (OR: 2.71, P value: 0.406). Similarly, we did not find a significant association between mild flu and BMI (OR: 1.06, P value: 0.087), diabetes (OR: 0.61, P value: 0.392), and hypercholesterolemia (OR: 0.50, P value: 0.393) in multivariable logistic regression.",

Our results suggest a significant positive association between mild flu and rs12252 C allele heterozygous and carriage. Future replication of the strong association observed here between rs12252 C allele carriage and mild flu might candidate this polymorphism as a genetic marker for early screening of susceptibility to mild flu. Lack of significant association between C allele homozygous and mild flu, observed in this study, might be the result of small sample size in this group. Trial registration: IR.PII.REC.1395.3.",

Due to the high frequency of the rs12252-C allele in Asians, the effect of the homozygosity for this allele was proposed to translate to a population-attributable risk of 54.3% for severe flu in the Chinese population compared with 5.4% in Northern Europeans. Both studies were performed with small sample sizes of H1N1-infected patients, calling for further studies on large sample sizes. Two studies reported a strong association between IFITM3 SNP rs12252-C and worse clinical outcomes in patients infected with 2009 IAV pandemic. The studies, however, doubt the presence of such association, at least among Europeans, as several rs-12,252-C homozygous patients only developed a mild flu [9, 31] .",

Using this tool, allele frequency and genotype distribution were calculated for cases and controls, as well. Statistical analyses were performed using Stata software (version 11). Continuous and categorical data were described in the usual fashion; means \u00b1 SDs were used to describe continuous variables, and numbers (percentages) were used to describe categorical variables. Association between categorical variables, including study group (mild flu vs. flu-negatives), rs12252 genotype (CC, CT, TT, and C carriers), rs12252 allele (C and T), province (Markazi, Semnan, and Zanjan), diabetes (positive vs. negative), and hypercholesterolemia (positive vs. negative), was assessed using Pearson's chi-squared test. For each cell with zero counts in contingency tables, Yates's correction was used. Also, where more than 20% of cells had counts less than 5, the alternative Fisher's exact test was used instead of Pearson's chi-squared test. Univariable logistic regression was used to test the association of each independent variable with mild flu. Variables with a P value smaller than 0.2 in the univariable model were included into the multivariable logistic regression. Also, a backward method using likelihood ratio tests (LRT) was used to make the model as simple as possible. As we sampled cases and controls from three distinct provinces of Iran, we retained the variable \"province\" in the final model. This was to ensure that residual population admixture, due to differences in participants' area of residence, does not confound the association between rs12252 genotypes and mild flu. All statistical tests were two-tailed with a type I error of 0.05. Observed powers of the estimated crude and adjusted odds ratios (OR) were also calculated to assess the robustness of our results (Additional file 1).",

Since virus entry often proceeds through endocytosis, it is possible that IFITM proteins are involved in endocytosis, by detecting and eliminating viral invaders before establishment of infection [3, 21] . Therefore, mutation in the gene coding for these proteins can lead to susceptibility to various infections. Yount, et al. (2010) introduced IFITM3 in mouse dendritic cells. They mentioned S-palmitoylation of IFITM3 on proximal cysteines controls its clustering in membrane compartments and its antiviral activity against influenza virus. [30] . Bailey and colleagues also found that IAV lung titers were higher in Ifitm3 knockout mice versus wild-type animals [2] .",

The inconsistent results reported by studies investigated the association between IFITM3 SNP rs12252 and influenza, made Yang, et al. to conduct a systematic review. Their meta-analysis included 445 patients with influenza and 4180 controls from four studies, including different ethnic and severity subgroups.

This may be explained as due to the differences in participants' ethnic background, since we studied Iranian ethnicities while Yang, et al. focused on UK Caucasians and Han Chinese ethnicities. Although, the rs12252-C allele in the Iranian population was rare, the overall effect of this allele on the risk of influenza was found to be considerably high. As our sample size was small, the power for some of our estimates was not desirable. In case such findings being replicated by future studies, the knowledge can be used in effective management of the epidemics. For example, understanding the biological pathways leading to mild and severe flu may lead to improvement of therapeutic options, and can alter existing vaccination practices. Findings of largescale studies on genetic susceptibility to influenza would also guide population-based prevention efforts. For example, by considering the genetic susceptibility of different sub-populations to influenza virus in a country, human and medical resources would be allocated to high risk areas in case epidemics/pandemics occur.",

Population stratification is related to situations when cases and controls are of different ethnic backgrounds with different genetic compositions, and has been noted as the most important type of the bias in genetic association studies. To control for the effect of residual population admixture on our results, we adjusted genetic association between IFITM3-SNP rs12252 and susceptibility to mild flu for participants' residence area. Growing empirical and theoretical evidence suggests that statistical adjustment for confounding effect of ethnicity provides estimates of genetic associations which are robust to bias from population stratification [4] .",
