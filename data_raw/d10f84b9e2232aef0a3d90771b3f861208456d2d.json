Despite such differences in strain groups (hitherto undescribed in Croatia), clinical presentation of infected children was rather similar.

Therefore, we investigated the rhinovirus (RV) infection prevalence over a 2-year period, compared it with prevalence patterns of other common respiratory viruses, and explored clinical and molecular epidemiology of RV infections among 590 children hospitalized with acute respiratory infection in north-western and central parts of Croatia. For respiratory virus detection, nasopharyngeal and pharyngeal flocked swabs were taken from each patient and subsequently analyzed with multiplex RT-PCR.",

Nucleotide sequences of referent RV strains were retrieved by searching the database with Basic Local Alignment Tool, and used to construct alignments and phylogenetic trees using MAFFT multiple sequence alignment tool and the maximum likelihood method, respectively. In our study population RV was the most frequently detected virus, diagnosed in 197 patients (33.4%), of which 60.4% was detected as a monoinfection. Median age of RV-infected children was 2.25 years, and more than half of children infected with RV (55.8%) presented with lower respiratory tract infections. Most RV cases were detected from September to December, and all three species co-circulated during the analyzed period (2017) (2018) (2019) . Sequence analysis based on 5 UTR region yielded 69 distinct strains; the most prevalent was RV-C (47.4%) followed by RV-A (44.7%) and RV-B (7.9%). Most of RV-A sequences formed INTRODUCTION Rhinoviruses (RVs) are small, non-enveloped viruses that belong to the family Picornaviridae, genus Enterovirus. To date, there are 171 rhinovirus (RV) genotypes recognized and classified into the three species as RV-A (83 types), RV-B (32 types), and RV-C (56 types) (Royston and Tapparel, 2016; Pan et al., 2018) . RV-A and RV-B were discovered by isolation on monkey kidney cells in 1950s (Price, 1956) while RV-C genotypes, which are not cultivable using ordinary culture methods, have been identified decades after following the rise of molecular techniques (Lamson et al., 2006; Lau et al., 2007) . There are also differences between RV species in utilization of cell entry receptor: a majority of RV-A and RV-B attach to the intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 (classified as the major receptor group) and the others alternatively bind low density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R) (minor receptor group), whereas RV-C utilizes human cadherin-related family member 3 (CDHR3) (Bochkov et al., 2015; Royston and Tapparel, 2016) .",

Introduction of sensitive and technically simple molecular detection assays, especially multiplex PCR, enabled affordable RV detection in line with other common respiratory viruses in clinical samples. Together with coronaviruses, RVs are indeed responsible for majority of upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), but also for substantial rate of LRTIs in all age groups (Lauinger et al., 2013; Zhao et al., 2018 Zhao et al., ,\u010civljak et al., 2019 . Many studies showed that RV is one of the leading causes of pneumonia, bronchiolitis and other form of severe respiratory disease (Zhao et al., 2018) , standing side by side with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in children and influenza in elderly (Esposito et al., 2013; Ning et al., 2017; \u010civljak et al., 2019) . There are several studies that report increased rates of asthma exacerbations and LRTIs among children with RV-C when compared to those infected with RV-A and RV-B (Bizzintino et al., 2011; Lauinger et al., 2013) ; however, recent studies did not find any relationship between a specific RV species and the severity of clinical presentation (Jacobs et al., 2015; van der Linden et al., 2016; Zhao et al., 2018) .",

Our results are consistent with previously published studies that investigated the etiology of ARI, especially those focused on children with LRTIs (Chen et al., 2015; Ning et al., 2017) . Indeed, RV is right next to RSV when addressing the most common causes of bronchiolitis in hospitalized children, as demonstrated in very low-birth-weight infants from Argentina and in one multicentre prospective study from the United States, respectively (Mansbach et al., 2012; Miller et al., 2012) . Although RV can be found both in upper and lower respiratory tract, the potential for spread and the pathophysiology of infection in those two regions differs (as evidenced by studies conducted on RSV) (Kim et al., 2016; Gonz\u00e1lez-Parra and Dobrovolny, 2019) . Possible causes of such disparity are fundamental differences in the immune responses and virus-cell interactions between these two anatomical regions, resulting in altered disease manifestation and spread (Gonz\u00e1lez-Parra and Dobrovolny, 2019). There is also evidence that mucus velocity is decreased in small children (akin to elderly individuals) (Grubb et al., 2016) , making them more susceptible to LRTI and creating in turn a potential niche for more detrimental effect of RV infection.",

Moreover, it has been shown that 5 UTR RT-PCR demonstrated greater sensitivity than VP4-VP2 PCR, as reflected by the higher positivity rate in amplification of clinical isolates, and further, no need for a nested PCR or multiple primer pairs -reducing in turn the contamination rate, cost and turnaround time (Kiang et al., 2008) . Despite using primers which target the region widely used for typing purposes, more than half of the samples produced no amplicons suitable for sequencing. Such low rate of successful RV sequencing from clinical samples may be a consequence of mutations in primer regions or low viral load in original sample, but most probably arises due to RNA degradation during freezing/thawing cycles. Phylogenetic groups were readily distinguished and all three RV groups were detected, with group C and A predominating. The proportion of the three RV species revealed in this study (RV-A 44.7%, RV-B 7.9%, and RV-C, 47.4%) is consistent with prior studies worldwide (RV-A, 35.9-67.7%; RV-B, 1.5-13%; RV-C, 23-59.3%) (Lauinger et al., 2013; Rahamat-Langendoen et al., 2013; Jacobs et al., 2015; Tsatsral et al., 2015; Ratnamohan et al., 2016; van der Linden et al., 2016; Zhao et al., 2018) .",
