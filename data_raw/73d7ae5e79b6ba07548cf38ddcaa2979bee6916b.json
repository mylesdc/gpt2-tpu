MeV is a member of the genus Morbillivirus and is most closely related to rinderpest virus (RPV), which is a pathogen of cattle. MeV is thought to have evolved in an environment where cattle and humans lived in close proximity. Understanding the evolutionary history of MeV could answer questions related to divergence times of MeV and RPV. We investigated divergence times using relaxed clock Bayesian phylogenetics. Our estimates reveal that MeV had an evolutionary rate of 6.0 -6.5 \u00d7 10 -4 substitutions/site/year. It was concluded that the divergence time of the most recent common ancestor of current MeV was the early 20 th century. And, divergence between MeV and RPV occurred around the 11 th to 12 th centuries. The result was unexpected because emergence of MeV was previously considered to have occurred in the prehistoric age. MeV may have originated from virus of non-human species and caused emerging infectious diseases around the 11 th to 12 th centuries. In such cases, investigating measles would give important information about the course of emerging infectious diseases.",

Mathematical analyses have shown that a na\u00efve population of 250,000-500,000 is needed to maintain MeV [6] [7] [8] . This is approximately the population of the earliest urban civilizations in ancient Middle Eastern river valleys around 3000-2500 BCE [6, 9, 10] .

Pomeroy et al. showed that \"Time to the Most Recent Common Ancestor\" (TMRCA: the age of the sampled genetic diversity) of the current MeV circulating worldwide is recent, i.e., within the last century (around 1943) [17] .

However, this result was unexpected because emergence of MeV was previously considered to have occurred in the prehistoric age [6, 7, 9, 10] . Estimation errors seem unlikely since Bayesian approach yielded results which are compatible with other reports. In general, substitution rates between 10 -3 and 10 -4 substitutions/site/year have been previously estimated for RNA viruses including MeV [17, 24, 25] . Pomeroy et al. also found that the date of divergence of the current MeV was within the last century [17] .",

Linguistic evidence suggests that the disease was recognized before the Germanic [26] : HIV from non-human primates [27] ; SARS coronavirus from bats [28] ; and the pandemic strain of influenza virus in 2009 from swine [29] . MeV may have originated from non-human species and caused emerging infectious diseases around the 11 th to 12 th centuries. In such cases, investigating measles would give important information about the course of emerging infectious diseases after their introduction into the human population, from evolutionary and epidemiological perspectives.

This age is still within 95% credible intervals of our results. Alternatively, a common ancestor of MeV and RPV may have caused zoonosis in the past; the archaeovirus can infect both humans and cattle. Even if the earliest urban civilizations in ancient Middle Eastern river valleys (around 3000 to 2500 BCE) were infected by an ancestor of the current MeV, the virus probably had different characteristics from the current MeV.Emerging infectious diseases have recently caused significant morbidity and mortality.
