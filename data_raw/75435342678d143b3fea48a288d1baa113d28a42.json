Its creators describe it as \"a multidimensional framework for describing, implementing and managing strategy at all levels of an enterprise by linking objectives, initiatives and measures to an organization's strategy\" [4] . Their tool broadened the traditional notion held by private sector companies that performance is indicated by financial measures solely, by integrating financial measures with other key performance indicators linked to three additional areas: customer preferences, internal business processes and organization growth, learning and development.

Whereas businesses focus on the level of customer satisfaction as a measure of performance, local public health units may also report on their levels of community engagement, since their customers and clients are populations and partners within the health unit's jurisdictions. Both businesses and health units may focus on their internal processes to demonstrate continuous quality improvements. In public health units this is may be measured by service delivery levels and efficiencies in resource distribution. And whereas corporations focus on continuous learning and demonstration of innovation to an ever changing market, public health practice must keep abreast of evolving population health science and evidence and demonstrate rapid responsiveness to emerging diseases and shifting political priorities.",

A main question that arose was 'Should the scorecard report performance at the overall health unit or at the divisionspecific (i.e. programmatic) level?' The original intent of the project was to develop an efficient scorecard for the health unit by populating a \"dashboard\" with a few key indicators aligned either with strategic priorities or particular themes, such as health inequity. However, we soon discovered that the participatory process involving representatives from all divisions and from three levels of staff invited and supported the development of a much more comprehensive and larger number of indicators that Four quadrants of the ICES balanced scorecard for public health Figure 1 Four quadrants of the ICES balanced scorecard for public health.",

The office of the Medical Officer of Health championed the exercise. A consultant familiar with the BSC [10] was hired to initiate the process. Orientation sessions were held with the staff to educate them about the meaning of the BSC and about the health status of the residents within the catchment area for the health unit. The consultant led a series of four half-day facilitated exercises with the panel to rank and select indicators for the health determinants and status, community engagement and integration and responsiveness quadrants. To develop indicators about key activities, and the level of service activities and dedicated resources, the BSC team facilitated discussion with each program area. The panel and program areas submitted their selected indicators and provided text to describe their key activities. The result was a 75 page report containing 46 tables of indicators posted on the York Region website. [11] .",

In Ontario, a lot of these data are routinely collected through provincial and federal surveys and made available to health units. Since the number of indicators is potentially very large, the panel was asked to select key indicators that described the burden of illness and the key demographic and social features that characterize York Region as unique.

There may be effective engagement between the health unit and the school board in promoting responsible drinking. The health unit may not have developed strategic alliances with the police (community engagement quadrant) and there is emerging evidence that reducing the legal alcohol limit for driving and promoting designated drivers programs is associated with a lower motor vehicle collision rate (integration and responsiveness quadrant).
