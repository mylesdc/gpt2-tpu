We evaluated 5 different CC strains for outcomes of long-term infection (3 months) and acute vs. early chronic infection (7 vs. 28 days post-infection), using neurological and behavioral phenotyping tests and histology. We correlated phenotypic observations with haplotypes of genomic regions previously linked to TMEV susceptibility to test the hypothesis that genomic diversity within CC mice results in variable disease phenotypes in response to TMEV. None of the 5 strains analyzed had a response identical to that of any other CC strain or inbred strain for which prior data are available, indicating that strains of the CC can produce novel models of neurological disease. Thus, CC strains can be a powerful resource for studying how viral infection can cause different neurological outcomes depending on host genetic background.",

For each of these diseases, a viral infection in childhood or young adulthood is thought to initiate a chain of immunological events that, along with other risk factors, result in a cumulative increased susceptibility to disease. The risk and clinical manifestations conferred by antecedent viral infection can vary greatly among individuals even when infected by the same virus. Experimental studies using mice have uncovered mechanisms of infection, but common inbred and transgenic strains of mice typically do not reflect the genetic diversity and phenotypic heterogeneity observed in human populations. Consequently, the mechanisms responsible for variable responses to viral infection in humans remain largely unknown.",

TMEV produces complications, which vary by mouse strain, that closely approximate human neurological conditions associated with antecedent viral infections. Moderately virulent strains (BeAn and DA) of TMEV establish a persistent infection resulting in demyelinating disease similar to MS in susceptible mouse strains such as SJL 16,17 and, to a lesser extent, CBA 18 . In susceptible mouse strains, TMEV infection is biphasic. The early period of infection (first 4 weeks) is characterized as an acute inflammatory phase, eliciting a strong anti-TMEV antibody response 19 along with an anti-TMEV T-cell response to clear the viral infection 20 . The later period of TMEV disease (from approximately 7 weeks post infection) is characterized by widespread neurodegeneration and chronic neuroinflammation 21,22 . In the TMEV-resistant strain C57BL/6, TMEV infection causes epileptic seizures, but these mice clear the virus from the central nervous system (CNS) and do not develop chronic demyelination as seen in SJL mice 23, 24 . Depending on mouse strain, TMEV can infect motor neurons, resulting in lesions similar to ALS in humans 25 , or dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra of CBA mice, similar to PD 26,27 . Since infection-associated neurological conditions in mice vary depending on genetic background, Published: xx xx xxxx OPEN www.nature.com/scientificreports/ 2 ScienTific REPORTS | 7: 12194 | TMEV infection can be used to model heterogeneous infection-associated human diseases to better understand the underlying genetic components.",

CC013 mice demonstrated forelimb weakness during the inverted metal grate test: these mice consistently released the grate first with their front paws, holding on for a few more seconds with their hind paws. The varied responses to TMEV infection for mice from different CC strains and sexes are reflected by the percentage of weight lost/gained. (a) Shows weight changes in the different strains over the course of the experiment, while (b) shows percent weight changes based on the starting (day 0) weights of the mice. Group B percent weight change at 5 dpi, in relation to TMEV RQ levels, was used to evaluate differences in response to TMEV: in (c), the left y-axis displays the percent weight change at 5 dpi, relative to baseline (pre-infection); the right y-axis shows TMEV RQ levels at 7 dpi. Box plots show data quartiles and median; whiskers represent extreme data outcomes. Dots show corresponding levels of TMEV transcript (RQ values). A higher infection level (shown here as TMEV expression RQ) did not correlate with greater % weight change for CC041, which also showed gender-specific responses.",

This measurement, which reflects the ratio of swing to stance phase time, should be the same for fore and hind limbs. The differences for different limbs indicate gait asymmetry. Indeed, the DigiGait parameter gait symmetry was very significantly affected by both infection and sex across all limbs, increasing with infection in both sexes (though not enough for obvious pathological implications). Other measurements of gait consistency and symmetry, paw area and paw area variability at peak stance, further indicated gait asymmetry in this strain. Paw area at peak stance was significantly affected by sex and infection in both fore and hind limbs, and paw area variability was significantly affected by sex in the hind limbs. Paw area decreased with infection in the forelimbs but increased with infection in the hind limbs of females; paw area decreased in the forelimbs but was unaffected in the hind limbs of infected males. Paw area variability increased for the hind limbs of infected females but decreased for those of infected males.

Also, these mice demonstrated certain behaviors, such as releasing the forelimbs first when held inverted on a grate, in keeping with the histological findings of neuronal death in the brain but not spinal cord. Furthermore, the relatively subtle gait changes in infected CC013 mice apparently resulted from injuries sustained in the CNS as a result of the epileptic seizures exhibited by this strain rather than lesions in the spinal cord, as no lesions were found in the spinal cords of CC013 mice at 28 dpi. The response of CC013 mice to TMEV was also distinct from those of previously studied inbred strains: 3 CC013 mice (out of 18 total) died during one phase or the other of TMEV infection, and based on the ongoing signs of encephalitis, these mice experienced a persistent state of inflammation rather than the typical immune shifts seen in TMEV infection 58, 59 .",

These clinical signs correlate with inflammatory changes at 7 dpi and degenerative lesions in the spinal cord at 28 dpi in this strain. Furthermore, DigiGait measurements suggest that the reduced neuromuscular control experienced by TMEV-infected mice caused reduced coordination in males, while the gait process itself -e.g., propulsion and deceleration -was affected in infected females. These differences in gait suggest different mechanisms underlie ambulation changes in females and males; however, no histological differences were observed between sexes.

All CC041 mice had inflammatory lesions at 7 dpi but did not present clinical signs and survived the acute phase of infection. The distinct weight-loss difference between CC041 females and males at 5 dpi suggests sex differences in the early responses to TMEV infection in this strain. Estrogen is a modulator of TMEV infection [60] [61] [62] , and typically estrogen protects against TMEV pathogenesis: SJL females clear the virus better than SJL males and therefore develop less inflammation 36 . In this regard, CC041 mice resemble SJL mice in their initial response to TMEV infection. Next in the CC041 mice, motor neuron damage manifested as dramatic hind limb paralysis within 10 dpi, without full restoration of function. This paralysis correlates with lesions at 28 dpi characterized by degenerative changes in the ventral gray and white matter spinal cord and secondary atrophy of the skeletal myofibers in the lumbar segments. In the CC041 strain, gait parameter measurements indicated that TMEV-infected male mice experienced greater loss of strength than infected females did. Sex-specific differences in swing parameter measurements may be attributed to pain and/or reduced mobility in the male mice 63, 64 . Although SJL mice infected with TMEV also experience reduced mobility during the chronic phase, for SJLs the decline is more gradual, with gait changes becoming apparent closer to 49 dpi rather than within 10 dpi as in CC041.",

Each of the 5 CC strains used for this study possesses different H2 haplotypes, none of which have been previously defined as TMEV-susceptible or resistant since TMEV infection has not been studied in 4 of the founder strains from which the H2 regions of these strains were derived. Furthermore, these strains collectively have 2 haplotypes for the portion of chromosome 10 that harbors Il-22, Ifng, and NeST. Three of the 5 CC strains (CC013, CC019, and CC041) share the same haplotype for Il-22, Ifng, and NeST, inherited from the NZO/HILtJ founder strain, while CC016 and CC061 share a different haplotype for these loci. CC061 mice inherited this haplotype from the TMEV-resistant C57BL/6 J founder strain, which could have implications for the reduced severity of TMEV-induced disease experienced by CC061 mice. In CC016 mice, this haplotype is from the founder strain 128S1/SvImJ. These haplotypes consist of identical SNP genotypes and have 94% sequence identity; therefore it is likely CC016 mice also experienced a \"buffering\" of TMEV susceptibility, regardless of what risk their H2 haplotypes might have conferred. In fact, the NeST genotype has a powerful influence on whether a particular strain can clear the TMEV infection 72 , and the fact that CC016 and CC061 share the same NeST genotype strongly suggests that they were more resistant to TMEV than the other strains.",

Those considered \"resistant\" clear the virus quickly; \"susceptible\" strains exhibit TMEV persistence leading to progressive demyelination. The level of viral RNA measured in CC061 mice during the acute phase resembled that measured for CC013 and CC019 mice (Fig. 2) , but it is likely the CC061 mice were able to clear the virus more quickly than, for example, CC041 mice. This definition of resistance/susceptibility has been used throughout this paper to maintain consistency with over 30 years of TMEV literature; however, the diverse phenotypes presented by CC strains in this small preliminary study call for updated classifications of TMEV response. For example, some strains may be classified as \"tolerant\", meaning infected mice could have a high viral burden but no clinical phenotypes. Future studies involving more CC strains are expected to reveal additional TMEV-induced phenotypes, which will enable expanded categorization of TMEV response types.",

CC013 mice demonstrated forelimb weakness, which has also been observed in mouse models of ALS such as the \"wobbler\" mouse 75, 76 . The forelimb weakness in this model of ALS is caused by the degeneration of motor neurons in the brainstem and the spinal cord. The permanent, profound hind limb paralysis demonstrated by CC041 mice following TMEV infection may also indicate substantial motor neuron damage. A longer observation period would be necessary to determine whether the TMEV-induced disease experienced by CC013 and CC041 mice reflects the etiology of ALS, as some mouse models of ALS do not show distinct ALS-like symptoms until 10-11 months of age [77] [78] [79] .",

With regard to time spent on the rotarod and numbers of vertical plane entries (rearing), it is worth noting that TMEV-infected CC061 mice seemed to perform better -i.e., in a way more to be expected from healthy micethan uninfected CC061 mice. Rotarod and rearing activities would be expected to show evidence of the hind limb weaknesses experienced by infected CC061 mice, but instead these mice appeared to exaggerate their physical capabilities when tested, almost as if to compensate for the effects of the infection. Perhaps the increased rearing could be due to lasting damage to the hippocampus during the acute phase of infection, which would have caused the mice to experience memory loss 54 ; perhaps the mice reared up more to investigate their surroundings because they had trouble processing the unfamiliar environment or were experiencing anxiety. This behavior might parallel that which is sometimes associated with cognitive impairments that present in some human neurological conditions such as MS [100] [101] [102] . Of course, it is critical for rotarod and open field measurements to be interpreted in context with observational data and other quantitative analyses such as DigiGait.",

In this study, we found evidence that 5 CC strains are differently affected by TMEV infection, providing proof of concept to support the use of CC strains to study variation in TMEV-induced neuropathological changes. Future studies should allow more time for infected mice to develop clinical signs, as this may reveal more details about neurological sequelae. Also, cytokine and gene expression levels must be considered in the future to better understand how TMEV infection induces disease. Study of both sexes and both phases of TMEV infection is necessary to more completely characterize how genetic background affects the ultimate outcome of TMEV-induced diseases. The experiments described here underline a need for further investigation into how TMEV infection contributes to disease pathologies on different genetic backgrounds, particularly as such experiments may help us better understand similar conditions in humans.",

Seizure activity was scored using the Racine scale, as follows: stage 1 -mouth and facial movement; stage 2 -head nodding; stage 3 -forelimb clonus; stage 4 -rearing with forelimb clonus; stage 5 -rearing and falling with forelimb clonus 109 . iii. Clinical scoring Mice were assessed daily for clinical signs of neurological disease, using a scoring system known to correlate with histological scores 38 . Scoring was based on established markers for evaluating TMEV disease, including ruffled fur, hunched posture, grooming, and limb weakness. The severity of each of these markers was scored on a scale of 0 to 6, with 0 being normal and 6 being moribund 38, 43 . Ruffling, or piloerection, is a clinical sign of encephalitis along with hunched posture, lethargy, and sunken eyes 38, 43, 110, 111 . Hunching in mice gradually increases with disease progression 38, 43, 112 . Another typical sickness behavior in mice is changes in amount of grooming. Grooming was measured only for Group A mice, by recording videos of individual mice in open-field arenas for 10 minutes and measuring time spent performing grooming behaviors. We evaluated limb impairment by timing how long mice clung to an inverted metal grate and how well each limb grasped the grate as described in detail in 110, 112 . iv. Gait assessment Changes in stride have been previously correlated with neurological sequelae in rodents [113] [114] [115] , including disease progression during TMEV infection in mice 39 . Mice in Groups A and B were evaluated separately, using different methods and equipment as described below. Foot print -Group A: Footprint analysis provides an objective, quantitative evaluation of neurological impairment in rodents 39, [113] [114] [115] [116] . To identify changes in stride length, stride width, and overall gait, fore and rear paws of Group A mice were painted red and blue, respectively, with nontoxic paint as previously described 39, 116 . Mice then walked along a strip of white paper inside a defined walkway approximately 7 cm wide by 90 cm long with walls 10 cm tall on each side. The resulting foot prints were scanned electronically and distances between prints were measured using ImageJ US National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 117 . Stride lengths and widths for both forelimbs and hind limbs were measured for a minimum of 6 sequential strides, as described previously 39 . These assessments were performed weekly for 7 consecutive weeks starting at 7 weeks post-infection (p.i. delineating subtle neurological phenotypes [118] [119] [120] [121] . Measurements were taken at 27 dpi. After the mice underwent an initial training period, we recorded mice walking at a speed of 19 cm/s for a minimum of 6 consecutive strides. For all measurements we included age-and sex-matched control mice for reference. Measurements are presented as average values from both forelimbs and both hind limbs. v. Rotarod",

Group B percent weight change at 5 dpi, in relation to TMEV RQ levels, was used to evaluate differences in response to TMEV: in (c), the left y-axis displays the percent weight change at 5 dpi, relative to baseline (pre-infection); the right y-axis shows TMEV RQ levels at 7 dpi. Box plots show data quartiles and median; whiskers represent extreme data outcomes. Dots show corresponding levels of TMEV transcript (RQ values).
