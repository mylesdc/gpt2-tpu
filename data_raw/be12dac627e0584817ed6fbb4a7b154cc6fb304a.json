We reassessed the psychometric properties of four widely-used scales, namely the Belief in Conspiracy Theories Inventory (BCTI), the Conspiracy Mentality Questionnaire (CMQ), the Generic Conspiracist Beliefs Scale (GCBS), and the One-Item Conspiracy Measure (OICM). Eight-hundred-and-three U. S. adults completed all measures, along with measures of endorsement of 9/11 and antivaccination conspiracy theories. Through both exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, we found that only the BCTI had acceptable factorial validity. We failed to confirm the factor structures of the CMQ and the GBCS, suggesting these measures had poor factorial validity. Indices of convergent validity were acceptable for the BCTI, but weaker for the other measures. Based on these findings, we provide suggestions for the future refinement in the measurement of conspiracist ideation.

            "text": "In tandem with growing scholarly interest in the psychology of conspiracy theories [1] , researchers have developed a range of different scales to measure individual differences in conspiracist ideation, which we define broadly here as a tendency to endorse conspiracy theories or engage in conspiracist thinking. With few exceptions, however, most of these newly developed scales have not been subjected to thorough investigations of their psychometric properties. In particular, little attention has been paid to the factorial and convergent validity, and PLOS ONE | DOI: 10 internal consistency, of these scales, which is concerning because scholars may be inadvertently introducing a degree of bias into their studies [2] . In this article, we review current approaches to measuring individual differences in conspiracist ideation. In brief, two different approaches are evident in the literature: (a) measuring conspiracist ideation in terms of endorsement of a range of real-world conspiracy theories, and; (b) measuring conspiracist ideation in generic terms without reference to real-world conspiracy theories. We review the different scales that have been developed in alignment with these approaches and highlight their measurement-related deficiencies, particularly in terms of factorial validity. In addition, we report on a new dataset from U.S. participants, via which we re-examine the psychometric properties of four measures of conspiracist ideation. This allows for the most comprehensive assessment of such scales to date and allows us to make recommendations for their future use.",

A number of such scales have been developed (see Table 1 ), including the Belief in Specific Conspiracies Scale [3] , the Conspiracy Theory Belief Scale [4] , the Composite Conspiracy Beliefs Scales [5] , and the Belief in Conspiracy Theories Inventory [6] . These scales vary widely in terms of the information provided about scale development, item construction and content, number of items, and internal consistency. Importantly, there has been a tendency for scholars to treat these scales as factorially unidimensional (i.e, by computing total scores) in the absence of analyses of their factor structures [3] [4] [5] or to treat the items individually [7] .",

One study [8] submitted the 17 items of the Conspiracy Theory Belief Scale to exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and extracted two distinct factors relating to generic conspiracy theories and climate change conspiracy theories. However, it is not apparent that the study had a sufficiently large size (N = 138) by conservative participant-to-item standards (i.e., a participant-to-item ratio of 10:1) [9] to conduct EFA. Moreover, the authors [8] elected to compute a total score (Cronbach \u03b1 = .78), arguing that item inter-correlations were high. This is problematic because item inter-correlations and high internal consistencies may still mask underlying latent factors [10] and, in any event, the internal consistency of the total score was below what has described as acceptable for novel measures (i.e., a internal consistency coefficient of .80) [9] . Other studies using this measure have likewise computed total scores and have reported higher internal consistency coefficients [11] [12] [13] , but have neglected to examine the scale's factor structure. At least one study [12] has also used a truncated version of this scale in the absence of an examination of the scale's dimensionality.",

Subsequent studies have mostly used the 15-item version of the BCTI and, although acceptable internal consistency coefficients have been reported [16] , none of these studies have re-examined the factorial validity of the BCTI. In addition, the measure has been translated into German [15] and Malay [17] , but in both instances the scale translators have not reported on the dimensionality of the measure.

Additionally, multi-group CFA showed that the one-dimensional model had adequate fit in German-and English-speaking samples, but indices for a Turkishspeaking sample were problematic.

In a second study [22] , the authors selected 15 \"representative\" items and reported that CFA showed a fivefactor model to have acceptable fit and better fit than a one-factor model with all 15 items. Even so, they and all subsequent studies using the GCBS have shown a preference to work with total scores. Two further problems limit the validity of the GCBS. First, the authors did not have a sufficiently large sample size to conduct EFA in the parent study; further examinations of the scale's factor structure were also conducted with small samples with suspect generalisability (see Table 2 ).

While there has been a proliferation of a range of conspiracist ideation scales, measurement issues have not been paid adequate attention. This has resulted in a number of scales with uncertain psychometric properties. Where factor structures have been examined, it is not immediately clear that scholars have applied basic guidelines for conducting factor analyses, explored the possibility of alternative models, critically appraised the decision(s) to utilise total scores, or re-examined factorial validity when the scales were used in new linguistic or cultural groups. In other instances, scholars have not fully reported on scale construction, making it difficult for scholars interested in replication efforts. These are all issues that have the potential to substantially hamper efforts to measure conspiracist ideation. In addition, there remains some confusion in the theoretical foundations that have led to the construction of the afore-mentioned scales, particularly as to whether conspiracist ideation can be considered to be a one-dimensional or multi-dimensional construct. In terms of scales that measure endorsement of a range of conspiracy theories, the available evidence would seem to suggest that such measures should be one-dimensional. This is based on the finding that belief in conspiracy theories tends to be \"monological\" [6, 26] . That is, belief in one conspiracy theory tends to make assimilation of other conspiracy theories more likely; as such, when participants are asked to complete measures that tap endorsement of multiple conspiracy theories, one should expect a monological belief system in which belief in a range of conspiracy theories are inter-correlated.",

Although it is possible that conspiracist ideation is multi-dimensional, consisting of discrete beliefs about multiple conspiratorial acts [22] , in practice most scholars have assumed that conspiracist ideation should be considered an internally coherent and one-dimensional trait. This is reflected in the use of total scores for the GCBS, as well as a one-dimensional factor structure of the CMQ. Likewise, the one-item measure of conspiracist ideation assumes that the construct can be reduced to a single dimension. Such assumptions appear to be predicated on the idea that conspiracist ideation can be considered to be a latent personality trait, akin to paranormal beliefs for example. While such an assumption seems intuitively plausible, it needs to be rigorously tested before firm conclusions can be drawn.",

In addition, we included the one-item measure because it is the most recently validated. We elected to omit the Conspiracy Theory Belief Scale for a number of reasons: there appears to be a good deal of item overlap between items in this measure and the BCTI, and responses scales for this measure have varied across studies (see Table 1 ).

Forty-six participants with large amounts of missing data (i.e., missing more than 10% of the total data across all measures) [28] were excluded from the dataset prior to analyses. For all remaining participants, missing data (< 0.2% of total dataset) were completely at random (based on Little's MCAR analyses), so we used the mean replacement technique to estimate missing values. All participants received debriefing information at the end of the survey.",

The item was rated on a 9-point scale, ranging from 1 (Completely false) to 9 (Completely true), so that higher scores reflect greater generic conspiracist ideation. 9/11 conspiracy theories. As a measure of convergent validity, we included a subscale from the 9/11 Conspiracist Beliefs Scale [6] . The parent scale consisted of 17 items, but the authors [6] reported, using EFA, that the scale consists of two factors that measure general 9/11 conspiracist beliefs (10 items) and beliefs that the U.S. government conspired to cover-up what happened on September 11, 2011 (7 items). In the present study, only the former subscale was used, with items rated on a 9-point scale ranging from 1 (Completely false) to 9 (Completely true). To check that this subscale was indeed one-dimensional, we submitted the 10 items to principal-axis EFA using the total sample (N = 803). Bartlett's test of sphericity, \u03c7 2 (45) = 9453.29, p < .001, and the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) measure of sampling adequacy, KMO = .96, indicated that the 10 items had adequate common variance for factor analysis. An EFA with quartimax rotation revealed a single factor (\u03bb = 7.90, variance explained = 79.0%), with all items having excellent loadings (! .81). An overall subscale score was, therefore, computed as the mean of the relevant 10 items, so that higher scores reflect greater endorsement of general 9/11 conspiracist beliefs. Swami et al. [6] reported that this subscale had acceptable internal consistency (Cronbach \u03b1 = .95) and good patterns of construct and convergent validity.

In the parent study, the authors [13] reported that total scores on the scale had acceptable internal consistency (Cronbach \u03b1 = .85), but neglected to examine the scale's factor structure. We therefore subjected the 8 items to principal-axis EFA using the total sample.

We initially computed a principal-axis EFA with quartimax rotation, but because the results indicated a multi-dimensional factor structure, we repeated the analysis using varimax rotation. The results indicated two factors with \u03bb > 1.0 (3.37 and 2.87, respectively) and parallel analysis indicated that both factors should be extracted. Item loadings are reported in S1 Table. Four items loaded onto the primary factor, which tapped the belief that vaccinations are used as a population tracking mechanism (Cronbach \u03b1 = .92, 42.1% of the variance explained). Four items loaded onto a secondary factor, tapping the belief that the dangers of vaccinations are being covered-up; however, two of these items also cross-loaded onto the primary factor, leaving two items in the secondary factor. Because Tabachnick and Fidell [29] do not recommend the use of subscales with less than three items, we elected to discard the secondary factor. The retained subscale included 4 items that tap the conspiracist belief that vaccinations are being used as population tracking mechanism (Cronbach \u03b1 = .92).",

The sample size for all three scales met conservative 10:1 participant-to-item requirements for EFA [9] . Following standard guidelines [31] , items were submitted to EFA if they passed standard criteria for item distribution (standardised kurtosis values > 10.0 suggest a problem), average correlation with the other items (items with r < .40 should be dropped), and item-total correlation (items should be dropped with corrected-item total correlations are < .30).

Hypothesised modelling was based on the results of the earlier EFA, as well as hypothesised models from earlier studies where there were discrepancies. Standard goodness-of-fit indices were selected a priori to assess the measurement models. The normed model chi-square (\u03c7 normed ) is reported with lower values of the overall model \u03c7 indicating goodness-of-fit. A \u03c7 normed value of < 3.00 indicates good fit [38] . The Steiger-Lind root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) and its 90% confidence interval provide a correction for model complexity. RMSEA values close to .06 indicate a good fit, with values ranging to .10 representing a mediocre fit [38] . The standardised root mean square residual (SRMR) assesses the mean absolute correlation residual and is a badness-of-fit index: the smaller the SRMR, the better the model fit. A cut-off value for SRMR is recommended to be \"close to\" or < .09 [38] . The comparative fit index (CFI) measures the proportionate improvement in fit by comparing a target model with a more restricted, nested baseline model. The CFI reflects a goodness-of-fit index and is recommended to \"close to\" or > .95 for adequate fit [38] . Even so, these recommended cut-off values should be considered subjective guidelines [39] [40] . We also examined standardised parameter estimates.",

In addition, using CFA, we found that the one-dimensional model of the BCTI had acceptable fit and, in both sub-samples, overall scores had acceptable internal consistency. This is perhaps not surprising when we consider that belief in conspiracy theories is thought to be monological; that is, endorsement of one conspiracy theory makes acceptance of other conspiracy theories more likely [6, 8, 26] . In addition, of the four scales, the BCTI showed the strongest correlations with measures used to establish convergent validity. Of course, the main limitation of the BCTI is a conceptual one: it is uncertain to what extent the measure truly taps conspiracist ideation, as opposed to endorsement of a range of conspiracy theories (in the present study, correlations with generic measures of conspiracist ideation were generally strong). It is also unclear to what extent the BCTI will remain temporally stable in the long-term, as individual items may become obsolete, or to what extent individual items will be cross-culturally relevant.",

However, using CFA, we found that the one-dimensional model had poor fit, even following modifications. Moreover, in the EFA sub-sample, evidence of convergent validity was moderate at best. We believe the poor factorial and convergent validity of the CMQ may reflect underlying problems with the construct validity of this measure. Specifically, we suggest that some items of the CMQ may not tap conspiracist ideation, but may reflect rational beliefs about the current state of the world. For example, given current knowledge, item #3 (\"I think that government agencies closely monitor all citizens\") could be construed as factual and requires no conspiracist mentality. The high mean scores for this measure (well above the scale mid-point) suggest that participants in this study were indeed rating some items of the CMQ as factually correct. In short, we suggest that there may be underlying problems with the construct validity of the CMQ, which affects its latent dimensionality. ",

However, our CFA suggested that none of the models of the GCBS had adequate fit even following modifications, suggestive of inherent problems with the dimensionality of this measure. It is possible that part of the problem with this measure is confusion about its latent structure and whether it taps a single or multiple dimensions of conspiracist ideation (see below). At best, the GCBS may tap different dimensions of conspiracist ideation (e.g., general conspiracist ideation versus conspiracist beliefs about extraterrestrial life); at worst, it may tap multiple dimensions that do not cohere very well. Overall, the present findings raise concerns about the use of this measure.",

It is possible that the CMQ and GCBS are modelling a substantial amount of noise (e.g., measurement error, sampling fluctuations) and that latent factor structures depend on arbitrary properties in the data. As a result, the uncovered factor structures associated with these scales may differ between studies (as in the case between our dataset and earlier studies) or within studies (as in the differences between our EFA and CFA subsamples). The most straightforward solution here is that, where scholars use the CMQ or GCBS, they should examine the factor structures of these scales in their dataset rather than assuming these measures are one-dimensional. Beyond this general point, we do not recommend the use of the CMQ and the one-item conspiracy measure in future studies. The CMQ appears to have poor factorial validity (and likely poor construct validity), whereas the one-item conspiracy measure appears to have weak convergent validity. Scholars who wish to measure generic conspiracist ideation may find it better to use the GCBS, but they should pay careful attention to (and report) its factor structure within studies. Our findings suggest the possibility that conspiracist ideation may be multidimensional and, as a result, scholars should not assume that the GBCS-or other measures of conspiracist ideation-are necessarily one-dimensional. More broadly, we suggest that there may utility in returning to a more careful consideration of theory, especially the conceptualisation of conspiracist ideation as a latent trait.",

[22] , and submit these items to exploratory factor analysis using a suitably large sample (i.e., a sample of no less than 750 individuals [9] . Doing so may highlight alternative factor structures that could then be re-assessed using CFA. Another way forward would be to subject all the items from conceptually similar scales (e.g., the CMQ and GCBS) to a single factor analysis, to examine the extent of conceptual overlap and possible item redundancy. In addition, future studies may also wish to revisit the factorial validity of the Conspiracy Theory Belief Scale, which we omitted in the present work. More broadly, we strongly recommend that all scholars working on conspiracist ideation pay closer attention to issues of measurement. Our data suggest that insufficient attention has been given to factorial and convergent validity, and that this may have introduced a degree of measurement bias into previouslyreported findings. Indeed, it was concerning that even one of our measures of convergent validity [13] had not been submitted to factor analysis and that we found a divergent structure to what the authors of the parent study had assumed. Looking ahead, we highlight the need for improved assessments of the psychometric properties of scales used to measure conspiracist ideation.

First, our use of an online sample means that we cannot be certain about the generalisability of our findings. In particular, the present results may be geographically and culturally limited. In addition, we did not assess the temporal stability of the four measures, and this could be usefully (re)examined in future studies.
