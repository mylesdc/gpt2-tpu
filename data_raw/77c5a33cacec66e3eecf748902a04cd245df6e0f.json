            "text": "Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) causes acute central nervous system (CNS) disease in humans, in whom the clinical symptoms vary from febrile illness to meningitis and encephalitis. However, the mechanism of severe encephalitis has not been fully elucidated. In this study, using a mouse model, we investigated the pathogenetic mechanisms that correlate with fatal JEV infection. Following extraneural infection with the JaOArS982 strain of JEV, infected mice exhibited clinical signs ranging from mild to fatal outcome. Comparison of the pathogenetic response between severe and mild cases of JaOArS982-infected mice revealed increased levels of TNF-\u03b1 in the brains of severe cases. However, unexpectedly, the mortality rate of TNF-\u03b1 KO mice was significantly increased compared with that of WT mice, indicating that TNF-\u03b1 plays a protective role against fatal infection. Interestingly, there were no significant differences of viral load in the CNS between WT and TNF-\u03b1 KO mice. However, exaggerated inflammatory responses were observed in the CNS of TNF-\u03b1 KO mice. Although these observations were also obtained in IL-10 KO mice, the mortality and enhanced inflammatory responses were more pronounced in TNF-\u03b1 KO mice. Our findings therefore provide the first evidence that TNF-\u03b1 has an immunoregulatory effect on pro-inflammatory cytokines in the CNS during JEV infection and consequently protects the animals from fatal disease. Thus, we propose that the increased level of TNF-\u03b1 in severe cases was the result of severe disease, and secondly that immunopathological effects contribute to severe neuronal degeneration resulting in fatal disease. In future, further elucidation of the immunoregulatory mechanism of TNF-\u03b1 will be an important priority to enable the development of effective treatment strategies for Japanese encephalitis.",

In common with human cases, mice develop relatively similar neurological dysfunction and the pathologic changes in infected mouse brains are similar to those observed in human cases [6, 9] . Although extraneural infection frequently does not result in detectable viremia or virus burden in mice, it is believed that initial virus replication occurs in dendritic cells (DCs) such as Langerhans cells at the site of infection, and the infected DCs migrate to draining lymph nodes [6] . Virus then invades the CNS and hosts develop CNS disease, although the mechanism by which the blood-brain-barrier is crossed is not completely understood [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] .",

            "text": "Microglia are the resident macrophages in the brain and are activated in response to a number of different pathological states [31] . Following JEV infection, activated microglia play a significant role in the development of pathology by producing pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 [32, 33] . Although these pro-inflammatory cytokines have dual roles, acting both as protectors and degenerators of neurons [31] , TNF-\u03b1 is believed to be one of the key factors that mediate immunopathology in the CNS during encephalitic flavivirus infection. For example, it was suggested that TNF-\u03b1 directly mediates neuronal apoptosis by the engagement of TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1), the TNFR-associated death domain (TRADD) and neuronal death contributes to glial activation and subsequent neuroinflammation [31, 34, 35] . It was also shown that TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 mediate RANTES gene expression for the recruitment of immune cells and glutamate released by JEV-infected microglia, involves TNF-\u03b1 signaling and contributes to neuronal death [36, 37] . On the other hand, other studies have shown that TNF-\u03b1 has a protective role against WNV infections and restricts WNV pathogenesis by promoting trafficking of mononuclear leukocytes into the CNS [38, 39] . Furthermore, neuronal TNF-\u03b1 expression during WNV encephalitis may be an adaptive response to diminish CXCL10-induced death [40] . At this stage of our knowledge, therefore, the precise role of the TNF-\u03b1 response in encephalitic flaviviral pathogenesis remains to be clarified.",

Insufficient anti-inflammatory cytokine production of IL-4 and IL-10 in the brain is associated with increased tissue pathology [43] . IL-10 displays a neuroprotective function during JEV infection and regulates deleterious effects of proinflammatory cytokines [44] . Furthermore, an experiment using IL-10 KO mice showed that IL-10 signaling plays a negative role in immunity against WNV infection and blockade of IL-10 signaling helps to control viral infection [45] .

This is considered to be a reproducible model of natural human infections following the bite of an infected mosquito or tick and in the past, death was used as an index of pathogenesis [46] . However, it is known that peripheral infections with some strains of encephalitic flaviviruses do not exhibit normal dose response curves based on mortality. Although this was first reported in the 1940's [47] , the reason for these apparent discrepancies were not fully understood. We previously showed that the Oshima strain of TBEV caused dose independent mortality and the fatality rate did not increase more than 50% with increasing virus challenge doses from 10 2 to 10 6 plaque forming unit (pfu) [48] . In our study of TBEV, we suggested that the variation of fatal outcome in individual mice appeared to be due to variation in individual host responses [48] .",

Thus, we next examined the cytokine levels in the brain cortex to compare the immune responses. The levels of TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, IL-2 and IL-10, but not IL-4 and IL-5 were significantly higher in JaTH160infected mice than in JaOArS982-infected mice ( Figure 1E , Figure S1A ).

Corresponding to the viral loads, histopathological examination showed that a large number of neurons displayed JEV antigens and severe cuffing was observed in the brain cortex of JaTH160-infected mice at 9 day pi ( Figure 1F ). JaOArS982-infected mice also exhibited JEV antigen-positive neurons and cuffing, but at lower levels than those observed in JaTH160-infected mice ( Figure 1F ).

IL-10 in the serum of SG mice was significantly increased compared with UG and MHG mice ( Figure S2B ). Corticosterone levels in the serum were also significantly increased in SG mice compared with other groups ( Figure S2B ). Corticosterone, a major glucocorticoid hormone, is a strong immunosuppressant and is elevated under stress response conditions such as those preceding death [55, 56] . Furthermore, severe cases resulting from infection with JaOArS982 exhibited a significant reduction of CD4 + and CD8 + doubly-positive cells in the thymus ( Figure  S2C ). Thymic depletion and body weight loss are the main features of the systemic stress response [55, 56] . These observations therefore suggest that SG mice exhibited a severe systemic stress response accompanied by immune suppression.

Although we cannot totally exclude the possibility that failure of TNF-\u03b1 administration to improve disease outcome, may have been the result of the technical design of the experiments, different responses of TNF-\u03b1 in the CNS when compared with peripheral tissues may partly explain our observations.

In human cases, an increased level of TNF-\u03b1 in the CSF appears to correlate with JE disease severity [8] .

In TNF-\u03b1 KO mice, we showed that the increased levels of inflammatory cytokines including Fas and the granular exocytosis correlated with severe encephalitis and fatal outcome. However, in WT mice, the apparent immunopathological features were not observed in dying mice 13 days pi. Although it was difficult to identify dying and surviving mice before 13 days pi by their clinical signs, JaOArS982-infected mice showed varying levels of Fas and granular exocytosis in the brains at 11 days pi and some of them exhibited similar or higher levels compared with the TNF\u03b1 KO mice ( Figure S3D ). Thus, fatal cases may exhibit severe encephalitis caused by immunopathological responses during the early phase of infection and thereafter severe clinical signs may appear in some mice.",

We have also recently discovered that interferon alpha receptor knockout induces dose-dependent mortality following extraneural infection with JaOArS982 (Hayasaka, et al., unpublished results) . In addition, we previously reported that late death following TBEV infection appears to be a key feature of dose independent mortality within the encephalitic flaviviruses [48] . In the current study, JaOArS982-infected mice also displayed increased times to death and the variation of acquired immune responses which either showed protective or pathological effects, appeared to be correlated with severe disease.

At this stage we cannot define the critical factors involved in the immunopathogenetic process ( Figure 8 ).
