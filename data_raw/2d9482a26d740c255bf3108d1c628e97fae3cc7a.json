Its genome was analyzed by nucleotide sequencing and was determined to have 31,029 bp. The small open reading frames situated between the spike and envelope genes of most of the CRCoV strains (except the CRCoV 4180 strain) were found to encode three nonstructural proteins (4.9 kDa, 2.7 kDa, and 12.8 kDa), while those of bovine coronavirus (BCoV) encode another three nonstructural proteins (4.9 kDa, 4.8 kDa, and 12.7 kDa) and those of a recently isolated bovine respiratory coronavirus (BRCoV) were found to encode only two nonstructural proteins (4.9 kDa and 12.7 kDa). The differences in the genes encoding these small nonstructural proteins may be associated with the emergence of highly similar viruses in different hosts.",

This virus emerged in England as a novel pathogen in the respiratory tracts of dogs suffering from severe respiratory disease (1) . The genomic organization of the CRCoV 4182 prototype strain isolated from a dog in England reveals that its major structural and nonstructural proteins are genetically related to bovine coronavirus (BCoV) proteins but that the genes encoding two or three small nonstructural proteins situated between the spike (S) and envelope (E) proteins differ from those of BCoV (2, 3) . To date, there are no complete genomic sequence data available publicly for CRCoV; hence, in this study, we aimed to analyze the full genomic sequence of the K37 strain that was derived from a Korean dog with clinical respiratory symptoms (2) .",
