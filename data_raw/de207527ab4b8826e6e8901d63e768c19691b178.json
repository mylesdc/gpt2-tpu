The MERS-CoV was first reported in 2012 and has since infected more than 1600 patients in 26 countries, mostly in Saudi Arabia and the Middle East. The epidemiology of the infection is compatible with multiple introductions of the virus into humans from an animal reservoir, probably dromedary camels. The clinical presentation ranges from no symptoms to severe pneumonitis and respiratory failure. Most confirmed cases so far were part of MERS-CoV clusters in hospital settings, affecting mainly middle-aged men and patients with a chronic disease or immuno-suppressed status. There is no vaccine or anti-viral medication available. Viral epidemics can occur anywhere in today's \"global village\". MERS-CoV is a relatively new virus, and this work is intended to add to the still-sparse data on its epidemiology, modes of transmission, natural history, and clinical features as well as to describe the preparedness plan for MERS-CoV infection in several countries. Effective national and international preparedness plans are essential to predict and control outbreaks, improve patient management, and ensure global health security.",

Subsequently, cases were identified in patients living outside the Arabian Peninsula and the Middle East, who were infected either during a stay in the Middle East or by close contact with an individual from an endemic country [2] .

A previously unknown coronavirus was detected in his sputum and provisionally called human coronavirus Erasmus Medical Center (hCoV-EMC) [1] . Shortly thereafter, in September 2012, the same virus was detected in a patient with severe respiratory illness who had been transferred from the Middle East to the United Kingdom. Combining with retrospective analysis of stored samples from the aforementioned outbreak in Jordan, the novel virus, renamed MERS-CoV, was recognized as the cause of a new severe respiratory disease [12] .",

Therefore, the Israel Ministry of Health (IMOH) has drafted preparedness guidelines that generally follow the CDC guidelines, although the CDC did not include Israel among the countries at risk. These guidelines recommend laboratory evaluation for all healthcare workers with a severe acute respiratory illness of unknown etiology, and in cases of clusters of severe respiratory symptoms of known etiology. In addition, the approval of the public health services is required before any case may be designated a suspected MERS-CoV infection, thereby ensuring early involvement on a national level in every instance of the disease. Information regarding MERS-CoV was disseminated by the distribution of leaflets and placement of informative posters at Ben-Gurion International Airport and three land-border crossings between Israel and Jordan [28] .",

Laboratory diagnosis is based on the detection of the virus in upper respiratory and lower respiratory samples by using real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. This detection is performed by targeting upstream regions of the E gene (upE) or within open reading frame (ORF)1b, using upE for screening and ORF1b for confirmation. Another real-time RT-PCR assay targeting the MERS-CoV nucleocapsid protein gene has been developed and can be used for screening and confirmation. When there are discordant results between two real-time RT-PCR assays, the sequencing of an amplicon generated from an appropriate RT-PCR assay should be performed to confirm test results. Lower respiratory tract specimens have been found to be more sensitive than upper respiratory tract specimens for the detection of MERS-CoV. In addition, the development of a rapid diagnostic kit is important for the timely diagnosis of suspected MERS-CoV cases. Serological testing can be used to screen the contacts of infected patients and to retrospectively confirm MERS-CoV infections [30] . Virus isolation in cell culture is not recommended at this time since it requires laboratory working under high biosafety level [29] .",

Several countries have taken the hard line of the CDC guidelines and recommend that direct healthcare workers should place all patients with a suspected infection in an isolated negative-pressure room and take adequate precautions by wearing two pairs of gloves, a disposable gown, and a face shield, and donning an N-95 respirator [28, 33, 34] . Currently, all suspected and confirmed cases should be treated in hospitals regardless of their medical condition, however transportation of patients to hospital requires additional emphasis, taking into account the small space of the vehicle and the close contact with the patient. The few guiding principles are that patients should be transported on a dedicated mission with the minimum number of crew members and should wear a surgical mask, if tolerated. The direct healthcare providers should wear the aforementioned PPE against contact and airborne transmission and avoid cough-or aerosol-generating procedures unless necessary. In addition, all transportations of patients should be coordinated with public health services [35] .",

            "text": "The recent MERS-CoV epidemic and the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2003 emphasized that new emerging diseases can occur at any time and in any place without prior notice. MERS-CoV shares certain similarities with SARS-CoV: both are zoonotic viruses which belong to the genus Betacoronavirus and can cause an acute respiratory illness which may be fatal. Although MERS-CoV has a higher case-fatality rate than SARS-CoV (36 vs. 10 %), both viruses are highly pathogenic and can apparently be transmitted through all routes of exposure. Moreover, currently, there are no effective vaccines or antiviral treatments for these diseases [36] . Failure to contain the outbreak in its first stages can have devastating effects, emphasizing the importance of a national preparedness plan for unusual biological events (UBEs). There are some key elements to improve the readiness for UBEs such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. (1) Containment abilities Implementation of quarantine measures to isolate healthy people who have been in contact with infected people and designated hospitals for receiving sick patients. (2) Infection control Given the unknown route of transmission, PPE against contact, droplet and airborne transmissions should be allocated to first responders. (3) Epidemic management team The need for a multidisciplinary team to advise the Ministry of Health regarding modes of action has been shown to be essential in the last outbreaks. Nevertheless, this consulting team should have routine training sessions in order to be ready during outbreaks. (4) Epidemiologic investigation team An early epidemiologic investigation is vital for containment of an outbreak and it allows early intervention that could prevent morbidity and mortality. Skilled teams with advanced epidemiologic investigation tools can detect earlier the index case and take prompt countermeasures. (5) Table- top and \"real-life\" exercises Exercises should be undertaken for testing contingency plans and coordination between organizations. The Israeli Orange Flame preparedness build-up project, in which medical and nonmedical staff are trained at three levels: tactical, operational and strategic, is a good example for a comprehensive drill that is aimed at improving national readiness and preparedness for emerging diseases [37] .",

Many countries have issued preparedness and detection guidelines for healthcare workers and for travelers to endemic countries. 3. No cure for MERS-CoV is currently available. Early detection, appropriate infection-control measures, and supportive treatment are key elements in preventing the next outbreak.
