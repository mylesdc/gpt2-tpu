Growing data volumes pose significant challenges for information processing systems in research centers. Additionally, the routines of genomics laboratory are typically characterized by high parallelism in testing and constant procedure changes. Results: This paper describes a formal approach to address this challenge through the implementation of a genetic testing management system applied to human genome laboratory. We introduced the Human Genome Research Center Information System (CEGH) in Brazil, a system that is able to support constant changes in human genome testing and can provide patients updated results based on the most recent and validated genetic knowledge. Our approach uses a common repository for process planning to ensure reusability, specification, instantiation, monitoring, and execution of processes, which are defined using a relational database and rigorous control flow specifications based on process algebra (ACP). The main difference between our approach and related works is that we were able to join two important aspects: 1) process scalability achieved through relational database implementation, and 2) correctness of processes using process algebra. Furthermore, the software allows end users to define genetic testing without requiring any knowledge about business process notation or process algebra.",

In a typical biological laboratory routine, many tests are run in parallel by a single equipment; for instance, a thermal cycler or DNA amplifier can perform several different PCR reactions simultaneously. This high parallelism demands accurate procedure, reagent, and result management. New tests are being continually developed and users have to be guided to perform the right task at the appropriate time. Incompatibilities between new and old processes and new data requirements make it difficult to integrate and analyze all the available information. Besides, the process of scientific knowledge discovery involves frequent process updates for the refinement of scientific hypotheses. Since new data are automatically generated and processed, manual approaches have become very expensive or even infeasible. As a result, a long-term solution to the scientific data integration issue requires formally validated and automated information processing tools.",

Most tests involve sequencing of several exons of the gene, which usually consists of a three-step procedure: PCR, DNA purification, and sequencing reaction. Note that amplification and reagents usually vary per exon and gene to be tested. Another set of tests requires a screening step using DHPLC or a different strategy, and only exons with an altered pattern in the first step are sequenced.",

Once a negative result is obtained, a second test is performed, which is used for the second most frequent cause of the disorder. At times, three or more different tests need to be performed.",

For example, there have been so far described more than 1,500 mutations for cystic fibrosis, which is the most common autosomal recessive disorder in Caucasians. As previously mentioned, testing starts in regions most likely to have mutations; other segments of the gene are tested only if negative results are obtained. Figure 1 shows patients, tests and their atomic steps, as well as the order of test performance. In other words, the steps shown in this figure are an illustration of test representation. This genetic test is used to identify mutations associated with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) [1] , a neuromuscular disease that causes progressive muscle degeneration. As most SMA patients carry a deletion of exons 7 and 8, the SMA test will probe the gene SMN1 looking for this type of mutation in exons 7 and 8. First, DNA is extracted from a patient sample. Then PCR of exon 7 and PCR of exon 8 can be performed. And because they are two independent procedures they can be performed simultaneously. At completion of both PCRs, the procedure analysis is released to execution, and it will analyze the previous results to produce a test result. Each procedure can be repeated as needed, as shown by a return arrow.",

However, ontologies cannot include semantics of tests and effectively address dynamic changes in genome testing routines. Several successful efforts have been documented with automatic generation of scientific workflows through technical planning based on ontology descriptions [5] [6] [7] .

A representative example of this approach is the SIGla: an adaptive open source LIMS for multiple laboratories [18] that provides the integration between a generic information system and several available workflow engines using standard files. SIGla provides workflow features using the Enhydra Shark [19] open source editor that is a graphical tool to design workflows. Once the workflow is designed, SIGla creates a XPDL file [20] allowing workflow execution into a workflow engine, called Shark. In addition to the use workflow management tools, the Shark framework in SIGla has been expanded to support important features including sequential chaining (where the output of an activity can be used as input to another activity), and repetition procedures for exception handling. The SIGla authors presented an example where the integration of workflow tools was not a simple task. To make this integration possible, some cases require not only adaptation but also the development of new features.",

The CEGH interface offers two options to carry out the test. The first allows the execution of a group of similar procedures regardless of the test performed. The procedure to be carried out in this group of tests is selected in the field 'procedure'. For instance, if the user selects PCR in the field 'procedure,' the interface will present all types of PCR waiting for execution. This approach is also useful when the user have to perform many procedures in the same lab equipment. The second execution option allows following up a specific test. In this option, the user selects the desired test in the field 'disease.' Only the specific Figure 2 User interface for the definition of genetic testing.

In the action combo box, a user can select the procedure status as follows: complete procedure, repeat procedure, cancel test, finish test. Based on the execution status attributed to procedure, the NPDL will analyze the process algebra expression to decide which procedures can be released to execution. In other words, the software uses the process algebra expression to guide the user through the correct path to perform a genetic test, thereby ensuring that the test was performed according to the desired standards even when different laboratories have defined new tests or test procedures.",

This encapsulation is possible as all test procedures must be repeated, cancelled or terminated when a problem occurs or when the results are not conclusive. This HTML adaptation is a disadvantage to the adaptability of the CEGH system. It could be avoided by using a generic or specialized tool for workflow definition. However, the graphical definition of a workflow increases the complexity of workflow definition and requires a trained user with knowledge about workflow notations to model workflows. In summary, with the two strategies of the CEGH interface, end users working at the laboratory do not necessarily have to master the process or scientific workflow notations to design and manage their workflows.",
