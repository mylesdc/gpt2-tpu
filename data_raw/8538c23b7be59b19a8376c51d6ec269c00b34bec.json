Rapid detection of outbreaks, known pathogens or emerging novel pathogens is critical for the prevention and control of infectious diseases. The proportion of deaths in urban settlements due to infectious diseases, inadequate health care access, lower socioeconomic status and malnutrition is generally higher in low and middle income settings, where, among many other factors, an increasing proportion of the world's population resides [1, 2] . However, conducting infectious disease surveillance among urban settlement dwellers using conventional disease surveillance methods can be challenging and costly due to the dense settlements, poor sanitation, and inadequate health care access. Thus, novel local and global surveillance systems for detection and response in such settings are needed to improve containment and control of infectious diseases [3] .",

Of the bacteria, viruses, and parasites detected, we focused on pathogens of relevance to the global burden of infectious diseases [1, 2, [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . The read abundance data were visualized using ggplot2 [25] and heatmap plotting systems for R [26] . To account for differences in sequencing depth between samples and to remove the influence of variation in bacterial/human reads, the following transformations were implemented: Bacteria and parasite mapped reads were shown as reads per million (RPM), calculated as (the number of reads mapped to a specific taxonomic group / total number of reads in the sample) \ufffd 10 6 . For the viruses, the viral read count per million (VRPM) was calculated by normalizing the read count for each specific virus relative to the total viral read count for each sample as follows: (read count virus A/total viral read count) \ufffd 10 6 . Several different algoritms have been developed to assist in outbreak detection, however, for simplicity we identified significant increases in abundance of individual pathogens during the study period. An upper limit was calculated as the mean read abundance plus 1.96 times the standard deviation [27] . Cases, where the observed weekly number of reads for specific bacteria, viruses or AMR genes were above the upper limit, these were defined as an \"upsurge\" of a sudden occurrence; all of those cases were excluded from the recalculation of the average and the upper limit (S3-S8 Tables). The number of S. Typhi reads at both clusters 9 and 10 in week 28 were removed from the calculation due to the spiked samples.",

The concurrence of significant higher bacterial read abundances of Shigella spp. being present in both clusters could indicate a possible increased presence of the pathogen in the community of these two clusters (Fig 3, S7 and S8 Tables). We identified the tet40 gene, which is an efflux-type resistance gene encoding a predicted membrane-associated protein with 42% amino acid homology to the tetA gene. Previously, tet40 has been detected in Clostridium spp., we however, could not detect a coinciding read abundance with Clostridium spp. [29] . Shigella spp. is endemic in sub-Saharan Africa with a high incidence in Kibera affecting 1 in 200 people annually [14] . Other increases based on read mapping were observed for Campylobacter spp., V. cholerae, and Y. enterocolitica, which similarly have been shown to cause substantial disease burden in sub-Saharan Africa [1] . From a public health perspective, detection of endemic pathogens (e.g. Shigella spp., Campylobacter spp., and Y. enterocolitica) from sewage is most relevant if the levels represent an increase from baseline. For non-endemic, outbreak-prone pathogens, such as V. cholera or polioviruses, any detection of circulation is of interest to public health officials.",

These viruses have recently been shown to be major contributors to gastroenteritis in Kibera, both alone and as coinfections [34] . Astrovirus MLB3 was another viral pathogen observed that temporally increase and is suspected to cause gastroenteritis. Astrovirus MLB3 has previously been shown to be the most prevalent astrovirus type in Kenya [35] . However, as no association with gastroenteritis was found in the study of Meyer et al. (29) , it is unclear to what extent Astrovirus MLB3 contributed to the diarrheal cases detected at the clinic. Salivirus FHB, aichivirus A, cosavirus and human parechovirus were detected throughout this study and are all putative causes of gastroenteritis [36, 37] . Interestingly, greater read depth would have been beneficial to the metagenomics analysis of virus and parasite but resulted in a greater discrepancy between the number of diarrheal cases and a higher abundance of virus. Of note, although a variety of viral pathogens was observed in the virome of the urban sewage, it is difficult to establish the disease associations of these pathogens. Many viral pathogens can be found in the stool of healthy individuals and are not necessarily the cause of diarrheal illness. Nonetheless, the broad range of enteric pathogens detected highlights the need for sanitation improvements in urban settlement cities like Kibera.",

These environmental factors along with the procedure of sewage sampling makes the surveillance strategy vulnerable to stochastic events. Due to the small number of urban sewage samples, it was difficult to detect outbreaks as no prior information concerning baseline pathogen abundance values exist from these sites. As viral tests were not routinely performed on stools collected through PBIDS surveillance during this study period, the presence of viruses among diarrhea cases could not be confirmed, although the metagenomic findings were in line with previous studies [34] . The PBIDS surveillance datasets were limited in the number of reported illnesses, diarrhea, AFI, subjective fever and clinic visits at the household level, making direct comparison between population-based disease surveillance and the relative abundances observed in metagenomics sewage surveillance very difficult and challenging. This might be improved if the household visits were conducted more often than once every two weeks. It is, however, interesting that several detected bacterial and viral pathogens in the metagenomics analysis coincide with increased numbers of diarrheal cases despite the few isolated bacteria from the clinic. Although this observation is intriguing, it could merely be a spurious correlation. Future investigations, incorporating longer periods of time for observation and sample collection and with a greater number of cases and more extensive or comprehensive clinic laboratory testing, should be conducted to better elucidate the findings of our study.",
