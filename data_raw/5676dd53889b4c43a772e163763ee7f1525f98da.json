To clarify the chemical characterization of chiral glucosinolates-the antiviral active ingredients of Radix Isatidis, an optimized efficient method of HPLC-UV-CD was developed to simultaneously separate and quantify the four main chiral glucosinolates: progoitrin, epiprogoitrin, and R,S-goitrin. The first step was to determine progoitrin, epiprogoitrin, and R,S-goitrin using HPLC-UV, and then determine the R-goitrin and S-goitrin by coupling with CD detection. Subsequently, through the linear relations between anisotropy factor (g factor) and the percent optical purity of R-goitrin, the contents of R-goitrin and S-goitrin from the R,S-goitrin mixture were calculated separately. Furthermore, the chemical composition features of the four chiral glucosinolates in 37 samples from crude drugs, decoction pieces, and granules of R. Isatidis were conducted. The total content of the four glucosinolates was obviously higher in crude drugs, and the variance character of each glucosinolate contents was different. In summary, the accurate measurement method reported here allows for better control of the internal quality of R. Isatidis and its granules and provides a powerful approach for the analysis of other chiral components in traditional Chinese medicines.",

Here, one isomer possesses a desired therapeutic effect, whereas its paired enantiomer could be inactive or even have undesirable effects [2] . For example, S-ibuprofen, the first chiral drugs of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug approved in 1994, was over a 100-fold more potent as an inhibitor of cyclooxygenase 1 enzyme than R-ibuprofen [3] . Notably, 45 new drugs approved by the US food and Drug Administration in 2015 were single enantiomers, except for lesinurad [4] . For this reason, investigating the biological activities of specific enantiomers of chiral compounds in TCMs is becoming more important. Chiral analysis of the chemical constituents in TCMs is therefore urgent and desired.",

Since chirality is a fundamental characteristic of nature, a large number of well-known therapeutic ingredients from elution were compared. Comparison with different compositions of acetonitrile/methanol-water, methanol-water with different modifiers including formic acid and ammonium acetate showed the combination of methanol and 30 mM ammonium acetate (adjusted pH for 5.0 with formic acid) gave an optimal mobile phase system for glucosinolates separation. As shown in Figure S1 , in order to acquire better peak intensity, five UV wavelengths-230, 242, 245, 254, 280 nm-were detected and 230 nm gave the best results. In addition, the maximum absorption CD wavelength of Rand S-goitrin was focused on 195 and 280 nm, respectively, whereas the detection range of the present CD-2095 detector was 220-490 nm. Therefore, the CD wavelength was set at 280 nm.",

The traditional processing and extraction methods could improve the biotransformation of progoitrin and epiprogoitrin, and then increase the content of the degradation products (R-and S-goitrin).

Through the linear relations between g factor and the percent optical purities of R-goitrin, the contents of R-goitrin and S-goitrin were successfully calculated. Subsequently, glucosinolate profiles in crude drugs, decoction pieces and granules of R. Isatidis were conducted and found that the variance character of each of the glucosinolate contents was different. In summary, the new method allows better control of the internal quality of R. Isatidis and its granules and provides a powerful approach and foundation for further investigation of dynamic change features of the contents and the main influencing parameters for biotransformation of glucosinolates in R.
