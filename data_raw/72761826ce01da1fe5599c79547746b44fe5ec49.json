The analytical sensitivity of the RPA assay was determined using ten-fold serially diluted IBRV DNA. The specificity of the assay was assessed with other viral pathogens of cattle with similar clinic and other herpesviruses. The clinical performance was evaluated by testing 106 acute-phase high fever clinical specimens. Results: RPA primers and probe were designed to target the specific conserved UL52 region fragment of IBRV. The detection could be completed at a constant temperature of 38\u00b0C for 25 min, and the amplification products were easily visualized on a simple LFD. The detection limit of this assay was 5 copies per reaction of IBRV DNA and there was no cross-reactivity with other viruses causing bovine gastrointestinal and respiratory infections or other herpesviruses. The assay performance on acute-phase high fever clinical samples collected from cattle with no vaccine against IBRV, which were suspected to be infected with IBRV, was validated by detecting 24 fecal, 36 blood, 38 nasal swab and 8 tissue specimens, and compared with SYBR Green I based real-time PCR. The coincidence between IBRV LFD-RPA and real-time PCR was 100%. Conclusion: IBRV LFD-RPA was fast and much easier to serve as an alternative to the common measures used for IBRV diagnosis, as there is reduction in the use of instruments for identification of the infected animals. In addition, this assay may be the potential candidate to be used as point-of-care diagnostics in the field.",

IBR is highly contagious, and can cause a diverse range of clinical manifestations from upper respiratory disease, rhinitis, vulvovaginitis, traeheitis, enteritis, conjunctivitis, abortion and encephalitis, to fatal systemic infection in neonatal calves [1] . IBRV can also induce immune suppression that contributes to the severity of disease manifestation. In addition, IBRV is one of the bovine respiratory disease complex pathogens, which is the leading cause of cattle death around the world [2] [3] [4] . Taken together, it is a major disease of cattle leading to significant economic losses to the dairy industry worldwide [5, 6] . Several developed countries such as Germany, have adopted immunization and eradication of pathogen-positive animals for IBR control [7] . Therefore, early identification of IBRV positive animals is critical for disease control and elimination programs to diminish its burden on the dairy industry.",

Although isothermal amplification techniques such as the loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) have been offered as a simple, rapid and alternative molecular pathogen diagnostic tool for point-of-care testing in the field [11, 12] , the LAMP assay needs four to six primers, leading to longer amplicons and possibly more difficult to design in the case of highly variable viruses.",

Then nine LF probe combinations with primers were employed for further validation in this study.

Recent studies have shown that isothermal amplification techniques such as RPA and LAMP could be developed to amplify nucleic acids, which require neither high precision instrument for amplification nor elaborate methods for detection of the amplified products [21] . Among those isothermal amplification assays, RPA is a powerful, innovative nucleic acid test, which could be useful for low resource settings [22, 23] . RPA outperforms over LAMP currently developed for IBRV diagnosis. One advantage is that RPA reaction only utilizes two primers and one probe and three binding sites, in contrast, the LAMP assay needs at least four primers and six binding sites.

In this study, different conserved genomic regions were selected for olignucleotide design (Table 1) . Several primer and probe combinations were initially evaluated for target sequences and two products generated by RPA primer pair and probe were distinct in size on an agarose gel to exclude non-specific amplification (Fig. 1a) . It is worth mentioning that, unlike PCR-based DNA amplification assays, it should be noted that the primer and probe set of RPA is much more stringent as it requires longer primers (30-35 bases) and probes (46-52 bases) leading to the potential of formation of secondary structures. Moreover, after several optimization screening, one optimal set of the primers and probe limited to the UL52 regions functioning DNA replication can be successfully used to amplify an exact sequence-matched template (Fig. 1b) since replacement, increase, decrease or mismatch of single base will have a significant impact on the result of amplification [26] . Furthermore, we also found that IBRV molecular detection with RPA assay poses unique challenges because the genome of IBRV was rich in GC content. In retrospect, given recently published data describing glycoprotein-based IBRV detection assay, loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) or PCRbased assays have been reported to detect IBRV in biological samples [27, 28] . In the present study, none of the primers targeting glycoprotein gB within the same region of the genome of LAMP and PCR could be used to amplify effectively in the initial screen (Table 1) , this may be due to the long probe formed folded secondary structures and had an impact upon hybridization to target, or perhaps there are different regions for primer design between RPA and LAMP/PCR.",

The study of specificity showed that no cross-detection between IBRV and other bovine infectious virus or bovine herpesvirus 5 ( Fig. 3a and b) . It should be noted that the high sensitivity and specificity of this assay gave the credit to good use of gold-labeled anti-FAM and anti-Biotin antibodies to capture RPA product simultaneously. The clinical performance of PCR, LFD-RPA and SYBR Green I based PCR assays were detected using 106 suspected clinical specimens, the clinical sensitivity of both LFD-RPA and SYBR Green I real-time assays was 100%, while PCR showing the lower detection might be due to some clinical samples containing low viral titers. Although LFD-RPA is not appropriate for the quantitative analysis of nucleic acid, an important feature of the method is the LFD-RPA assay under normal circumstances outperforms other isothermal amplification assays in terms of simplicity and sensitivity, because it only requires a simple heat block to run and the results can also be visualized by LFD with naked eyes inspection.",

Moreover, some samples only require simple preparation and processing before RPA. It has also been shown that RPA tolerates multiple known PCR inhibitors, including hemoglobin (50 gL \u22121 ), heparin (0.5 U), undiluted serum, and ethanol (4%v/v) [17] . However, some components of nucleic acids extracted from clinical sample have an influence on RPA reaction such as the concentrations of background DNA in whole blood [30] . To fulfill the full potential of developed IBRV LFD-RPA at the point of care in field conditions, we evaluated several simple methods for clinical sample extraction including direct sample lysis with heat lysis, alkaline lysis (0.2 M KOH or 0.5% SDS) and Dynabeads\u00ae magnetic separation. We found that Dynabeads\u00ae magnetic separation worked well. Similar Heat and alkaline lysis did not result insufficient recovery of positive DNA (data not shown). Although Dynabeads\u00ae magnetic separation technology is easily adapted to automated liquid handling platforms, other methodology platform to perform sample preparation will be further required to optimize.",
