This is surprising given the key role that hospitals play in the delivery of healthcare services and the large proportion of health systems resources that they absorb. To explore the factors that impact upon priority setting at the hospital level, we conducted a thematic review of empirical studies. A systematic search of PubMed, EBSCOHOST, Econlit databases and Google scholar was supplemented by a search of key websites and a manual search of relevant papers' reference lists. A total of 24 papers were identified from developed and developing countries. We applied a policy analysis framework to examine and synthesize the findings of the selected papers. Findings suggest that priority setting practice in hospitals was influenced by (1) contextual factors such as decision space, resource availability, financing arrangements, availability and use of information, organizational culture and leadership, (2) priority setting processes that depend on the type of priority setting activity, (3) content factors such as priority setting criteria and (4) actors, their interests and power relations. We observe that there is need for studies to examine these issues and the interplay between them in greater depth and propose a conceptual framework that might be useful in examining priority setting practices in hospitals.",

Given that healthcare demand outstrips available resources, the judicial use of resources through appropriate priority setting has been considered a key determinant of health system performance (Martin 2007) . For example, it has been shown that a reallocation of 50% of the health budget from interventions that are less cost effective to those that are more cost effective could result in a 64% increase in years of life saved in the East African region (Bobadilla et al. 1994 ). In addition, the 'Tanzania Essential Health Intervention Project' suggested that targeted investments guided by proper prioritization resulted in a 40% reduction in child mortality in test districts (De Savigny et al. 2004) .",

This is perhaps surprising given the critical role that hospitals play in the delivery of healthcare services and the observation that they absorb a significant portion of healthcare resources. For example, it has been observed that public hospitals absorb 30-50% of government budgetary allocations to the health sector in both developed and developing countries (Mills 1990; Martin et al. 2003a) . Understanding how these hospitals set their priorities and the factors that influence their allocation of resources is therefore imperative. We conducted a thematic review of empirical literature on priority setting at the hospital (meso) level with the aim of describing what is known about priority setting practices and exploring the factors that influence this practice.",

In a first step, we performed a search using the following keywords: 'hospital' and 'priority setting' or 'rationing' or 'healthcare rationing' or 'planning' or 'decision making' or 'strategic planning' or 'resource allocation' or 'health technology assessment' or 'budgeting'. Reference lists of selected papers were also manually searched for relevant papers. We limited the search to studies published in the English language that were available from January 1990 to December 2012. Next, we only included studies in the review if they reported empirical data on priority setting practice in hospitals. In this step, we initially screened study abstracts using these criteria and subsequently obtained full-text formats for studies deemed relevant. The final inclusion of studies in the review was based upon a detailed assessment of the full-text formats (studies for which no full-text format was available were excluded). All abstracts and full-text formats were reviewed independently by two authors. We then classified studies according to five general characteristics: (1) country (ies) where the studies were conducted, (2) study design, (3) priority setting activity and (4) study objectives.",

The rule of rescue also featured prominently whereby emergencies received high priority (Kapiriri et al. 2007) . For health technology assessments and medicines selection, medical criteria included effectiveness, safety, ease of use and capacity of staff to employ the technology, patient benefits in terms of health outcomes and the nature of the technology/medicines.

For example, in a hospital in Argentina, it was reported that allocations depended on whether the hospital managers and departmental heads enjoyed good relations and the potential for mutual benefit between them (Gordon et al. 2009 ). In addition, given that decision making was centralized, priorities were aligned to meet the political goals of local politicians rather than the health needs of the population (Gordon et al. 2009 ). In Uganda, even though the formal criteria of need determined that the paediatric department, which received almost 40% of the hospital emergencies, is given higher priority, the surgical department was given greater priority because of its perceived prestige, and because it had managers who were better at 'lobbying, making noise and quickly use up their resources' (Kapiriri and Martin 2006) .",

The decision space for hospital level priority setting was influenced by the structure of the health system and the nature of the priority setting activity. For example, in countries such as Canada and Norway where the health system was significantly decentralized, hospitals had greater decisionmaking latitude (Kapiriri et al. 2007) , while in Chile, a country with a less decentralized health system, priority setting at the hospital level was predominantly guided by national decisions with little discretion at the hospital level (Valdebenito et al. 2009 ). Hospitals generally had most discretion over decisions about medicines formularies and adopting new technologies compared to decisions about choice of programmes and allocations across programmes and departments.",

In Uganda, for example, an increasing budget deficit led to the capping of budgets and introduction of line budgeting which reduced the flexibility of priority setting (Kapiriri and Martin 2006) .

This influence appeared to be in two forms (1) through the conditions associated with the financing sources and (2) through the incentives engendered by financing arrangements. For example, given that Chile has a mixed publicly and privately financed healthcare system, hospitals were required to employ guidelines that aligned their priorities to those prescribed by both systems (Valdebenito et al. 2009 ). Funding arrangements also generated incentives that influenced priority setting practice. Hospitals which were funded by a global budget were less willing to fund incremental use of new technology compared to hospitals funded under different models, such as fee for service (Sharma et al. 2006; Danjoux et al. 2007) . Operating under line budgets reduced the flexibility of hospitals in choosing priorities and allocating resources across them (Kapiriri and Martin 2006) . The introduction of budget caps also discouraged the adoption of new technologies as it required cutting allocations to hospital services (Sharma et al. 2006) .",

A study on the role of leadership in priority setting reported that leaders are expected to foster goals and a vision for the hospital; create alignment between goals, vision, resources and skills, actors and processes; develop and maintain relationships among actors; embody and promote desired values and establish an effective process for priority setting (Reeleder et al. 2006) . The commitment of hospital leaders to implementing a fair and legitimate process was considered crucial to meeting the conditions of the ethical priority setting framework, AFR (Bell et al. 2004; Madden et al. 2005; Reeleder et al. 2005; Kapiriri and Martin 2006; Kapiriri et al. 2007; Gordon et al. 2009 , Valdebenito et al. 2009 ). Within this framework the role of leadership seems to hinge on two points. First, the enforcement condition of A4R suggests that good leadership involves attention to the ethical aspects of priority setting. Second, leadership approaches describe a variety of values and behaviours which align with, and can be viewed as enablers for, A4R.",

In practice, the departmental heads compiled departmental wish lists and submitted them to the hospital management without consulting frontline staff (Kapiriri and Martin 2006; Valdebenito et al. 2009 ).

Suggestions for new technologies and medicines were thereafter processed through three possible channels (Figure 1 ). For medicines, often these suggestions were presented to an assessment committee which employed selection criteria to make decisions about their selection and inclusion in the hospital formulary (Bochner et al. 1994; Martin et al. 2003b; Gallego et al. 2007 ). This committee goes under different names such as the medicines and therapeutics committee, or pharmacy and therapeutics committee. For other technology such as surgical technology, decision making depended on the level of capital investment required (Sharma et al. 2006; Danjoux et al. 2007) . For technology that required a low capital investment, decision making for adoption was made by departmental heads. When a proposed technology was associated with significant capital investment, final adoption decisions were made by the hospital manager/Chief Executive Officer (Greenberg et al. 2005) . In some hospitals, technology assessment committees had the responsibility of evaluating and making decisions about the adoption of new technologies (Greenberg et al. 2005) .",

The absence of quality data provided loopholes for the use of informal/ subjective considerations in the priority setting process (Gordon et al. 2009 ). Lack of information also resulted in assessments being conducted after technologies had been adopted and widely used (Greenberg et al. 2009 ).

Power differences exist when some actors in the priority setting process have the capacity to influence priority setting outcomes more than others. This occurs given that hospital decisionmaking environments tend to be hierarchical and politically complex (Gibson et al. 2005) . Power was derived from several sources. For example, actors with control over the budget had more power and hence influence over priority setting decisions (Gordon et al. 2009 ). The senior hospital managers exercised more power over decisions compared with other hospital managers and frontline practitioners by virtue of their position as senior managers (Gibson et al. 2005) . For example, the hospital executive in a hospital in Argentina indicated that they did not need to consult the hospital management committee when requesting additional staff allocations (Gordon et al. 2009) . A study of a hospital in Uganda reported power struggles between management and frontline workers, with managers reluctant to share decision-making responsibility. Actor power derived from possession of specialized skills and certain personal characteristics were also exercised (Gibson et al. 2005) . For example, a study of decision making for a new surgical technology in Canada reported conflict between surgeons and radiologists over leadership of the process. There was also conflict between professional groups in hospitals (Astley and Wake-Dyster 2001; Haselkorn et al. 2007) leading to competitive and defensive rather than collaborative behaviour. A study in Canada reported that actors with greater persuasive skills had greater power to influence the planning process (Gibson et al. 2005) .",

Given that frontline staff and the public were often excluded, not all the relevant actors participated in the process. It was generally observed that the publicity condition was not met because while decisions were communicated, this communication was often only for the people that took part in decision making, thereby excluding other stakeholders such as frontline workers and/or the public. In addition, reasons/rationales for the decisions were not communicated. Of the 12 studies, only 4 reported the presence of a formal appeals mechanism, while the other 8 reported the presence of informal mechanisms where dissatisfied staff would seek redress directly with the hospital chief executive.

To our knowledge this is the first review of empirical studies on hospital level priority setting. Our review confirms that there is limited research attention given to priority setting at this level. Given that hospitals consume a significant proportion of health system resources, and act as avenues for delivery of key healthcare interventions, understanding how and where they put their resources is an important research and practice question. Another key observation is that most studies of priority setting in hospitals focused on developed country settings with few being conducted in developing countries. Most of the studies were conducted in tertiary, often teaching hospitals. Such hospitals are relatively large and act as referral hospitals. These hospitals are often semi-autonomous institutions whose management structures, operations, resources and target users are very different from lower level hospitals. There is, therefore, a gap in understanding how smaller, non-referral hospitals set their priorities and allocate their resources.",

The use of this approach allowed for an indepth exploration of not just the what, but how and why of priority setting practices in these hospitals. Where case study methodology was not employed, quantitative surveys were used. These surveys were often limited to reporting frequencies against selected characteristics of priority setting and were unable to explore how and why the different aspects of priority setting interact and affect each other. There is perhaps a need to develop and employ mixed method approaches in the study of priority setting. For example, while qualitative methods were particularly good at eliciting the criteria used in setting priorities, they were unable to determine the relative importance of these criteria. Application of priority setting criteria implies trade-offs between competing criteria. Determining the relative importance of priority setting criteria is, therefore, an important ingredient in systematic priority setting processes. There are a number of quantitative methodologies that can be employed to elicit preferences for priority setting criteria, ranging from simple rating and ranking scales, self-explication methodology and choice experiments, to more complex discrete choice experiments (Ryan et al. 2001; Pavlova et al. 2003; Baltussen and Niessen 2006) .",

            "text": "All but one of the studies that sought to evaluate priority setting employed the AFR framework. This is an ethical framework developed by Daniels and Sabin that aims to be 'a practical, yet theoretically defensible, account of how societies should set limits to and priorities for health care' (Eddy 1991) . The framework argues for a focus on the 'process', rather than the 'outcome' of priority setting, given the lack of consensus about universal criteria. AFR proposes that the goal of priority setting should be fairness and legitimacy. The studies captured in this review, therefore, endeavoured to evaluate priority setting processes against the four conditions of AFR such as relevance, publicity, appeals and revision and enforcement. The 'publicity' criterion holds that resource allocation decisions must be public, including the grounds for making them. The criteria for 'relevance' require that the basis on which allocative decisions are made must be ones that 'fair-minded people can agree are relevant to meeting the healthcare needs fairly under reasonable constraint' (Daniels and Sabin 1997) . Arguments should rest on scientific evidence, though not necessarily a specific kind of evidence (Daniels and Sabin 1998) . The 'revisions and appeals' process criterion requires that there is an institutional mechanism that provides for channels for appeals to decisions and subsequent revisions of decisions in light of further arguments. The 'enforcement' criterion requires that some form of regulation exists to make sure that the first three conditions are met (Daniels 2008) . While a focus on the fairness and legitimacy of priority setting processes is indisputably important, understanding what substantive principles are employed in priority setting and how they are operationalized SETTING HEALTHCARE PRIORITIES IN HOSPITALS in local context is equally important. For example, do hospitals allocate their resources across services according to severity of disease or efficiency? And how do they define and specify these principles? While this distinction between substantive and procedural approaches to priority setting suggests that the two are incompatible, there is increasing consensus on the need to combine these approaches (Ham and Coulter 2000; Ruger 2004; Kamm 2005) . There is, therefore, a need to develop approaches that combine the use of substantive principles that are widely accepted with fair processes.",

            "text": "Most of the studies were inspired by a framework proposed by Martin and Singer (2003) which recommends a strategy for improving priority setting that involves (1) describing priority setting in the context where it occurs, (2) evaluating the description using an ethical framework and (3) improving priority setting based on the evaluation. In elaborating this approach, they argue that any sustainable strategy to improve priority setting must be built on a continuous learning platform that, at the very least, captures how priority setting decisions are actually made (Martin and Singer 2003) . This, they argue would necessitate a description of the priority setting contexts, processes and actors involved. Our review highlights a range of factors influencing priority setting in these institutions regarding context (e.g. financing arrangements, leadership, organizational culture, level of resourcing and demand for health care), process (e.g. procedures and tools used) and content (e.g. guidelines and criteria of priority setting) as well as the importance of the interests and influence of the key actors involved in the process. Some critical aspects of priority setting appear to have been neglected by the studies reviewed, however. For example, while contextual issues such as financing arrangements and decision-making capacity of managers are arguably important in priority setting processes, these were at best minimally explored. Also given that priority setting is a social process with a range of actors, the power relationships between these actors and how these influence the process warrant a more in-depth examination.",

This made it easier to determine what to look for in the papers, organize the extracted data and structure the synthesis of findings. On the basis of the review and drawing on policy analysis frameworks (Walt and Gilson 1994; Buse 2007; Gilson and Raphaely 2008) , we propose that studies that aim to analyse priority setting practices use a health policy lens.

There is, however, a dearth of literature on priority setting in hospitals in developing countries and in particular little attention has been paid to lower level hospitals as opposed to larger, referral hospitals. Most priority setting studies employed a qualitative case study methodology, a suitable approach for examining complex social phenomena that are often highly embedded in context. However, broader approaches that include mixed methods should also be considered. Our review identified a range of factors that affect priority setting practice in hospitals. These factors provide potential policy levers that could be used to influence priority setting processes. We have also proposed a framework that, in our view, could be useful in examining priority setting processes and potentially informing the design of system interventions to influence priority setting at the meso level in hospitals. In increasingly devolved systems greater attention to the practice and consequences of priority setting are required to promote accountability, efficiency, effectiveness and equity.",
