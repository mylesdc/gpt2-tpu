Pneumococcal acquisition and colonization density is probably affected by viral co-infections, the local microbiome composition and mucosal immunity. Here, we report the interactions between live-attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV), successive pneumococcal challenge, and the healthy adult nasal microbiota and mucosal immunity using an experimental human challenge model. Nasal microbiota profiles at baseline are associated with consecutive pneumococcal carriage outcome (non-carrier, low-dense and high-dense pneumococcal carriage), independent of LAIV co-administration. Corynebacterium/Dolosigranulumdominated profiles are associated with low-density colonization. Lowest rates of natural viral co-infection at baseline and post-LAIV influenza replication are detected in the low-density carriers. Also, we detected the fewest microbiota perturbations and mucosal cytokine responses in the low-density carriers compared to non-carriers or high-density carriers. These results indicate that the complete respiratory ecosystem affects pneumococcal behaviour following challenge, with low-density carriage representing the most stable ecological state.",

After sequencing and quality control, we observed a total of 343 operational taxonomic units (OTUs), representing 13 bacterial phyla. The presence of natural viral co-infection at baseline was detected in 9.6% of samples. We first assessed the associations between baseline nasal microbiota composition, natural viral co-infection (i.e. before pneumococcal inoculation and vaccination) and pneumococcal carriage outcome. We detected a significant association between baseline nasal microbiota composition and consecutive pneumococcal carriage outcome. This effect was stronger for carriage 3 outcome, that is, when volunteers were stratified in high-dense, low-dense and non-carriers based on both conventional culture and qPCR data (permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PER-MANOVA), R 2 = 3.1%, p = 0.048; Fig. 2 , Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 2 ), compared to carriage 2 outcome, where volunteers were dichotomized in carriers or non-carriers based on culturing only (Supplementary Fig. 3A and Supplementary Table 3A ). The importance of semi-quantitative information on pneumococcal density in these analyses was further supported by a borderline significant association between baseline microbiota composition and density of pneumococcal colonization at day 2 (R 2 = 1.7%, p = 0.076; Supplementary Table 3B ). Interestingly, volunteers who became low-dense carriers demonstrated the lowest presence of natural respiratory viruses at baseline (before intervention) and showed the lowest rate of (replicating) influenza virus following LAIV vaccination compared to both high-dense and non-carriers (Supplementary Table 4 ). These associations were independent (Supplementary Table 4E ). We thus studied the potential interaction between viral co-infection, microbiota composition and pneumococcal carriage 3 outcome; we observed that the association between baseline microbiota and pneumococcal carriage acquisition was dependent on viral co-infection at baseline, but not on LAIV vaccination (p = 0.011 and p = 0.640, respectively; Table 1 ). Stratified analysis suggests, however, that the association between microbiota and carriage 3 outcome was slightly weaker for the LAIV cohort compared to the control cohort (R 2 = 2.9 vs. R 2 = 4.2%, respectively; Supplementary Fig. 3B and 3C), suggesting interactions between both natural viral co-infection and iatrogenic LAIV infection, and (1) baseline nasal microbiota and (2) pneumococcal carriage receptiveness.",

We identified the OTUs that discriminated most between clusters using a random forest algorithm (referred to as biomarker species; Supplementary Fig. 5A ). The largest cluster (STA; n = 132 [31.6%]) was characterized by Staphylococcus spp., followed by a cluster typified by several Corynebacterium (of which the most abundant was Corynebacterium [3] ) and Table 5 ). In line with previous findings, the cluster distribution at baseline was significantly different between low-dense and non-carriers (Fisher's exact test with Monte Carlo simulation; p = 0.039). Baseline differences were related to a higher proportion of CDG profiles in low-dense carriers vs. non-carriers (37.0 vs. 10.8%, respectively, p = 0.042). Contrariwise, although non-significant, low-dense carriers specifically lacked STA-dominated profiles compared to both noncarriers (18.5 vs. 43.2%, respectively, p = 0.058) and high-dense carriers (39.5%, p = 0.111). These results were confirmed by a stratified analysis where clustering was based on baseline samples only, ruling out potential confounding of these associations by profiles that emerge post-challenge.",

Using analysis of composition of microbiome (ANCOM), we identified OTUs present at baseline that were associated with pneumococcal carriage 3 outcome, showing baseline Corynebacterium (3) and Dolosigranulum (4) were positively associated with low-dense carriers compared to non-carriers (Supplementary Fig. 6 ). metagenomeSeq analysis confirmed this association for Corynebacterium (3; Supplementary Fig. 7 and Supplementary  Table 6 ). Moreover, using metagenomeSeq, we detected an additional consortium of lower abundant OTUs also related to carriage 3 outcome. These OTUs were positively associated with both highdense carriers compared to low-dense and non-carriers and belonged to the families Prevotellaceae, Campylobacteraceae and Neisseriaceae, which are (facultative) anaerobes, primarily residing in the oral cavity (Supplementary Fig. 7 and Supplementary Table 6 ). Lower abundance of these (facultative) anaerobes in lowdense carriers was also associated with a reduced microbial diversity compared to high-dense and non-carriers (Wilcoxon's rank-sum test; p = 0.01 and p = 0.03, respectively; Supplementary Fig. 8A and Corynebacterium (1) Staphylococcus epidermidis (2) Corynebacterium propinquum (3) Dolosigranulum (4) Moraxella (6) Streptococcus (7) Peptoniphilus (5) Finegoldia (8) Haemophilus (9) Fusobacterium (10) Stress = 0.25 R 2 = 3.07% P value = 0.048 Fig. 2 Baseline nasal microbiota composition in association with pneumococcal carriage 3 outcome.

The standard deviation of data points within carriage outcome groups is shown. In addition, the 10 highest ranked operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were simultaneously visualized (triangles). The stress value indicates how well the high-dimensional data are represented in the two-dimensional space; a value of~0.2 indicates a reasonable representation. P values and effect sizes (R 2 ) describing the strength and the significance of the association between baseline nasal microbiota and pneumococcal carriage outcome were generated using PERMANOVA tests, and are adjusted for the month, presence of any virus at baseline, the interactions between carriage outcome and the vaccination group/presence of any virus at baseline.

We first assessed the links between baseline nasal microbiota and cytokine levels at day 0 (i.e. following LAIV vaccination), regardless of carriage 3 outcome, using both canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) and distance-based redundancy analysis (dbRDA; Fig. 4 ). Intriguingly, the OTUs that were most strongly related to the first two axes of both CCA and Table 5 . The number of cluster changes was lower in low-dense carriers compared to both high-dense and non-carriers (see Tables 2 and 3) . A higher proportion of CDG profiles was observed in low-dense vs. non-carriers. Contrariwise, lowdense carriers specifically lacked STA-dominated profiles compared to both high-dense and non-carriers The association between baseline nasal microbiota composition and carriage3 outcome was adjusted for the month of sampling (i.e. seasonal effects), the presence of any virus at baseline (day \u22124) and the interactions between carriage3 outcome and vaccine/presence of any virus at baseline (n = 116). These interactions (indicated by a colon) were included to properly assess the associations between baseline microbiota and carriage3 outcome, the latter of which could have been impacted by viral co-infection. Analyses were performed using PERMANOVA. See Supplementary Table 3 for the detailed assessment of associations between microbiota composition and carriage2 outcome/pneumococcal density PERMANOVA permutational multivariate analysis of variance, df degrees of freedom, F F test statistic, R 2 measure of variance dbRDA were mostly oral-type species, including Streptococcus, Veillonella, Prevotella and Porphyromonas spp., and other previously identified acquisition-associated microbiota members, including Dolosigranulum (4) and Corynebacterium (3) (dbRDA). Only granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were consistently and significantly associated with baseline nasal microbiota (anova.ccafunction; p < 0.05). Cytokine levels at day 0 were significantly lower in volunteers who became low-dense carriers compared to noncarriers, although this was only significant in the LAIV but not in the control group upon stratification (GM-CSF, interferon-\u03b1 (IFN\u03b1), interleukin-12 (IL-12), IL-17, IL-1\u03b2, IL-2 and IL-4, within LAIV; linear model, p < 0.05, Supplementary Table 8A ). In general, volunteers who became high-dense carriers had intermediate cytokine levels at baseline. Following we combined baseline microbiota plus cytokine data to study whether the combined data improved the classification strength of carriage 3 outcome. Indeed, combining these data showed larger data separation than microbiota data alone (Fig. 4) , suggesting that both baseline microbiota composition and baseline host responses are driving pneumococcal receptiveness.",

            "text": "We therefore hypothesize that controlled low-dense colonization of S. pneumoniae might be the most beneficial phenotype for both host and microbe, based on less ecological perturbations and a reduced cytokine levels observed in low-dense carriers. In contrast, especially in individuals who failed to become colonized, we observed strong mucosal responses combined with increased microbiota profile changes following challenge were observed. This finding was in line with previous observations by our group, demonstrating that pneumococcal exposure not followed by colonization was still associated with augmented anti-protein immunoglobulin responses, suggesting induction of host immune Pre (69) Pre (26) All (105) Pep (50) All (33) Cor (52) Por (32) Vei (58) GM-CSF VEGF Pep (5) Dol (4) Fus (10) Hae (9) Mor (6) Act (22) Cor (3) Ana (11) Str (7) Non-carriers 25 . Apart from a difference in Dolosigranulum and Corynebacterium spp. in non-carriers compared to high-dense carriers, these phenotypes were very alike, which suggests that in both cases the physiological balance between microbiota and immune surveillance is perturbed, presumably contributing to a self-enforcing dysbiosis-inflammation cycle 26 . This feedback loop acknowledges the bidirectionality of the links between immune response and microbiota, which likely explains our observations in both highdense carriers and non-carriers. The unimodal, rather than linear relationship between microbiota composition and carriage receptiveness has not been identified before, since we previously had no access to samples obtained before pneumococcal inoculation. In line with previous work from our group focussing on the relationship between LAIV and pneumococcal carriage 15, 16 , our current findings underline the importance of molecular pneumococcal detection methods in discerning the low-dense carrier group.",

Using canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) (a) and distance-based redundancy analysis (dbRDA) (b), we assessed the links between cytokine levels day 0 and baseline nasal microbiota. It is assumed that the dependent variables (log 10 + 1-transformed relative abundance operational taxonomic units [OTUs] ) respond in a unimodal or linear fashion to the predictor variables (log 2 -transformed cytokine levels) for CCA and dbRDA, respectively. We simultaneously plotted the samples (data points, n = 71), significant (p < 0.05) predictor variables (cytokines; arrows) and the OTUs that were most strongly associated with the first two axes (n = 10 for each axis, excluding overlapping OTUs). Samples were coloured according to carriage 3 outcome (red, high-dense carriers, n = 36; blue, non-carriers, n = 18 and orange, lowdense carriers, n = 17), ellipses denote the standard deviation of the samples in each group. Note that carriage 3 outcome was not accounted for when simultaneously modelling cytokine/microbiota data, yet still are clearly discriminated, suggesting that baseline microbiota and cytokine levels at day 0 (following live-attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) and prior to pneumococcal challenge) are related to pneumococcal receptiveness. Data separation by carriage 3 outcome was higher when ordination was based on both microbiota and cytokine data (dbRDA and CCA; standardized absolute \u03b2-coefficient 0.43 and 0.32, respectively) compared to microbiota alone (non-metric multidimensional scaling [NMDS]; 0.22; Fig. 2 ).

We provided a detailed schematic on the research questions/associations explored and a data analysis flow chart depicting an overview of the methods used ( Supplementary Fig. 10 ). Detailed information on our statistical analysis can be found in the Supplementary Methods. In short, using PERMANOVA tests, we studied the associations between carriage outcome and the overall microbiota composition at baseline and each subsequent time point. In conjunction, we assessed the association between microbiota composition and month (i.e. seasonal effects), the presence of virus(es) at baseline and the interaction between LAIV or presence of viruses at baseline and carriage outcome. The relationships between microbiota composition and carriage outcome were visualized using NMDS plots. Differentially abundant OTUs at baseline associated with pneumococcal carriage 3 outcome were detected using several statistical techniques, including (1) ANCOM 45 and (2) metagenomeSeq 46 . Differences in \u03b1-diversity according to carriage 3 outcome were tested using (1) Wilcoxon's rank-sum tests and (2) linear mixed-effects models with carriage outcome, time point and the interaction between carriage outcome and time points as fixed effects and subject as random effect. We used the multcomp package to determine significant differences within specific contrasts. To assess the microbiota dynamics related to carriage 3 outcome over time, we performed an unsupervised average linkage hierarchical clustering based on the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrix. The optimal number of clusters and biomarkers for each cluster were determined as previously described 7 . Comparisons of cytokine levels according to carriage 3 outcome was performed using a linear model, including vaccine, carriage outcome and the interaction between vaccine and carriage outcome. We simultaneously assessed the associations between baseline nasal microbiota and day 0 cytokine levels using CCA and dbRDA.",
