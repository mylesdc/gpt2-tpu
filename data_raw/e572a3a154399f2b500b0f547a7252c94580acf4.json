These mosquitoes are capable of breeding in uncovered containers holding rain water, such as tires, buckets, flower pots, etc., that are commonly found in urban areas in the tropics [1] . Dengue incidence has increased 30-fold over the last 50 years, is endemic in more than 100 countries, and causes an estimated 50 million infections annually [2] . Dengue has been cited as the most important arthropod-borne viral disease of humans, with an estimated 2.5 billion people globally at risk [3] . Bhatt et al. [4] recently used a cartographic approach to estimate that there may be as many as 390 million dengue infections annually, which is more than three times the global dengue burden estimated by the World Health Organization (WHO).",

The classic presentation (called dengue fever or DF) begins with an abrupt onset of high fever, often accompanied by erythema, severe muscle and joint pain, headache, nausea, and vomiting [5] . Recovery is prolonged and marked by fatigue and depression [6] . There are four known serotypes of the virus, although the initial clinical presentations are almost identical [3] . A severe presentation, known as dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) occurs primarily in patients who are reinfected with a different serotype [7] . DHF includes increased capillary permeability with potentially significant vascular leakage that compromises organ function and may lead to shock [2] [3] [5] [6] [7] . Mortality in DHF has been reported as high as 10-20% and over 40% if shock occurs [8] . Prevention methods currently rely on vector control until such time as a specific anti-viral therapy or a licensed vaccine becomes available [9] . Therefore, public health agencies see potential benefit if a means could be found to predict dengue outbreaks with enough advance time to allow for the planning and implementation of mitigation strategies. An effective prediction model would be particularly helpful in areas where resources for such efforts are limited and in locations where medical treatment facilities may become overwhelmed by an outbreak.",

Most of these studies have examined the environmental factors that influence mosquito vector populations [e.g., 1, 10, 11] . While some studies used only simulated data to develop methods for capturing seasonal forcing [e.g., 12], others used real data. In 2008, Runge-Ranzinger et al. [13] performed a systematic literature review in order to identify dengue outbreak prediction models or detection methods. One outcome of this literature review was the observation that most studies were retrospective and primarily focused on dengue outbreak detection and surveillance, rather than prediction. Furthermore, it was determined that most studies lacked an appropriate determination of sensitivity and specificity. A more recent literature review of decision support systems for the prediction, prevention, and control of vector-borne diseases was carried out in 2011 by Eisen and Eisen [14] . While the focus of this literature review was on geographic information systems and remote sensing data, it was determined that the studies reviewed provided useful risk maps, but did not provide actual predictions or forewarnings of future outbreaks. Finally, in addition to the studies evaluated in these two literature reviews, there are a variety of published methods for the surveillance and detection of an outbreak that has just begun but is not yet obvious [e.g., 15] .",

Among the latter is a study by Yu et al. [16] that analyzed climate data (including temperature, rainfall, and Southern Oscillation Index), mosquito larvae abundance, and human health data to develop a Bayesian Maximum Entropy model to predict dengue outbreaks one week in advance. Unlike most studies, Yu et al. developed their model on one set of data but tested it on a different set of data, thereby avoiding the exaggerated performance metrics that may occur when the same dataset is used for both development and testing. They found that the probabilities that a dengue outbreak actually occurred given a positive prediction and given a negative prediction were 0.5541 and 0.031, respectively. A study by Hii et al. [17] described a time series Poisson multivariate regression model to predict weekly dengue cases in Singapore using temperature, rainfall, and previous dengue incidence. After developing this model using 2000-2010 dengue data, it was used to predict dengue incidence during the first six weeks of 2011. They then used observed weather data and the previously predicted dengue incidences for prediction of dengue incidence during weeks 7-16 of 2011. A recent study by Lowe et al. [18] described using a Bayesian generalized linear mixed model approach to produce probabilistic predictions of monthly dengue incidence in Brazil. It is noteworthy that, like the present study, these authors used different data for development and testing, thereby allowing for more realistic accuracy assessments.",

Among the climate variables are those known to indicate future weather patterns that may or may not be seasonal. The final prediction models adhere to these principles: 1) the data used must be available at the time the prediction is made (avoiding pitfalls made by studies that use recent data that, in actual practice, would not be available until after the date the prediction was made); and 2) the models are tested on data not used in their development (thereby avoiding overly optimistic measures of accuracy of the prediction). Local public health preferences for low numbers of false positives and negatives are taken into account. These models appear to be robust even when applied to nearby geographic regions that were not used in model development.

In order to estimate incidence rates for each of the years from 2003 to 2011, the denominators were derived from a linear fit to values for province populations from the official RP census for 1995, 2000, and 2007. Finally, daily dengue incidence data were pre-processed into weekly data in order to mitigate issues, such as missing data and day-of-week effects, and to increase compatibility with weekly environmental data.",

For each RP province, weekly dengue incidence rates were determined and plotted as a time series in order to assess whether the data were stable enough to be used for modeling. Analysis of weekly incidence rates of province-level data revealed inconsistencies and frequent changes in reporting. For example, the weekly dengue incidence for the provinces of Laguna and Cebu are plotted on Figure 1 . While the incidence rate is relatively stable throughout the analysis period for the Cebu province, there is a significant trend for Laguna province resulting from increased reporting in the later years. For all the RP provinces, we identified those that had significant reporting trend (often due to the fact that additional hospitals started reporting), reporting variability, data drop-offs, and inconsistencies from the time series plots. Unfortunately, there were no province-level data for confirmed dengue incidence to make reliable distinction between reporting trend and elevation of disease incidence. As a result of this analysis, it was determined that 40 out of 81 provinces had relatively robust reporting. Table 3 shows the resulting provinces that were selected for further analysis.",

The threshold between Low and High incidence needs to be determined before the rules are extracted from the data and the classifiers performing predictions are built. While the threshold could be set based upon an outbreak definition, several different outbreak definitions exist, depending upon the context and the disease [27, 28] , and are often determined by such factors as expert advice or assuming the incidence is Gaussian. Generally, a threshold should be set high enough to reduce the chances of statistical and non-outbreak fluctuations in incidence data causing outbreak alarms. If the threshold is set too low, situations of ''alarm fatigue'' may occur [29] . In resource-limited settings, having a low false alarm rate helps to conserve those resources for situations in which the accurate prediction of an outbreak is more likely. Therefore, the threshold needs to be meaningful to the user and linked to the action to be taken when the predicted value exceeds the threshold.",

Figure 2 shows the historical incidence for the 40 selected provinces for the period January 2003 through December 2011. The historical mean and standard deviation of the incidence data were computed for the period January 2003 through December 2011. Based upon user feedback, the threshold between Low and High was set at the mean plus 1.5 standard deviations, which corresponds to a weekly incidence of 4.554 per 100,000 population. Use of dengue data from adjacent provinces. In addition to the past dengue incidence data described above, four derived predictor variables describing dengue incidence in adjacent provinces were calculated. Each province was defined by its shape in the Philippines GIS database and adjacent provinces were identified by running a Structured Query Language (SQL) statement on this GIS database. Then, for each province, the dengue incidence rates in its neighbors were aggregated to form four predictor variables: mean, maximum, median, and overall adjacent incidence. The mean, maximum, and median adjacent incidence rates were defined, respectively, as the mean, highest, and median values of dengue incidence of all the neighboring provinces combined. The overall adjacent dengue incidence was computed as the sum of dengue case counts in the neighboring provinces divided by the sum of populations of those provinces.",

Rainfall rate data derived from measurements made by the NASA Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellites were obtained from the NASA Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Center [32] . Typhoons, which frequently pass nearby or make landfall in the Philippines, bring heavy rainfall and high winds that may result in infrastructure damage. After storm passage, infrastructure damage and remaining stagnant pools of water may lead to increased exposure of the human population to the mosquito vector. Therefore, typhoon intensity and associated wind data were obtained from the US Naval Oceanographic Command Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JWTC) Best Track data [33] . These data consist of the entire typhoon path coordinates and times, and the maximum sustained wind speed at each storm location. The time resolution of the storm position was six hours. Using a radius of 80 km around each storm path coordinate, it was determined whether the interior of this circle intersected a Philippines province. If the intersection of this circle with land for a province was a non-empty set, the typhoon status variable was assigned a value according to the US Naval Oceanographic Command Joint Typhoon Warning Center typhoon categorization (dissipated, tropical depression, tropical storm, typhoon-1, typhoon-2, typhoon-3, typhoon-4, and typhoon-5) and the maximum sustained wind data were included in the predictor variable data.

These conditions influence both regional and global weather patterns. The sign of the SOI determines whether conditions are neutral, El Ni\u00f1 o, or La Ni\u00f1 a, while the magnitude of the SOI indicates the strength of the El Ni\u00f1 o and La Ni\u00f1a. El Ni\u00f1 o and La Ni\u00f1 a conditions typically result in rainfall anomalies (e.g., heavy rain, drought) and temperature anomalies a few months later in regions both nearby and some considerable distance from the tropical Pacific [37] . Sea Surface Temperature Anomaly (SSTA) data are also used as more local indicators of near-term future rainfall anomalies [38] . Higher sea surface temperatures (e.g., warm SSTA) result in more convection and the creation of rain-forming clouds. These clouds will be blown by the winds either away from or toward land, resulting in changes in rainfall patterns that may not be seasonal. Therefore, the SOI and SSTA data are used in order to provide leading indicators of future weather patterns that may not always be seasonal.

Originally, these weights were selected manually, which relied on human intuition and resulted in a tedious, reiterative process of selecting weights, building a model, and testing it on the finetuning data set in order to find the best classifier on the fine-tuning data set. The enhancement automates the process of accepting user-specified ranges for the weights on each class. Using this enhancement, all possible models were built and tested on the finetuning data set.

All rules in the classifier that match the data point are found, and each of these rules casts a vote for its consequent that is weighted by the product of the rule's confidence and the rule's fuzzy support on that data point.

For example, a high incidence prediction could lead to a public health department using its limited resources to deploy costly measures (e.g., mosquito spraying). One consideration is whether it is more important to use a model with a high PPV or a high Sensitivity. A high PPV indicates that, when the model predicts high incidence rate, high incidence is very likely to actually occur. When disease prevention and mitigation resources are limited, it is very important to have high PPV. Based on feedback from the local public health departments in Peru, there was a desire for a dengue prediction model with high PPV [20] . To reduce morbidity and mortality, public health departments also want to be able to mitigate any real outbreaks without being caught unprepared. A high Sensitivity indicates that the model predicts a high percentage of the outbreaks that actually occur. If PPV is high and Sensitivity is low, it means that when an outbreak is predicted, the probability is high that it will occur, but only a small percentage of actual outbreaks are predicted. In an attempt to illustrate these differences, the F-score [45] was introduced.",

This variation is also shown as a drop in F 3 values from 0.639 to 0.484. Overall, the models are relatively robust: their performance decreases gracefully when testing on data two years after the model training data, and when testing on data from provinces that were never used in training. Figure 5 . Incidence rate and predicted incidence rate for the province of Abra. Green bars correspond to prediction of LOW and red bars correspond to prediction of HIGH. When the incidence rate exceeds the threshold and a red bar is present, this corresponds to a TP; when the incidence rate is below the threshold and a green bar is present, this corresponds to a TN; when the incidence rate is above the threshold and a green bar is present, this corresponds to a FN. doi:10.1371/journal.pntd.0002771.g005 Figure 5 shows the actual and predicted weekly incidence (4 week ahead prediction) for the province of Abra using the prediction model from Table 4 . There are two missed weekly HIGH incidences near 27 May 2011 and 27 September 2011, but most of the predictions are correct. Figure 6 shows the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve for the dengue prediction models developed by the method presented. Figure 7 shows a map with the model prediction for the week 8/7-8/13/2011 made using data that would actually have been available on 7/10/2011. For 12 provinces, the predictions are HIGH incidence (shown in red) and for the remaining provinces the predictions are LOW incidence (shown in green).",

The method automatically selects those associations that meet certain pre-defined criteria, and uses these selections as rules for a prediction model. This procedure thus limits the number of rules and variables to those that are most important for the prediction. The resulting model is objective and reproducible. Past disease incidence data, along with environmental and socio-economic variables that have been shown in the literature to influence potential exposure to the virus, should provide enough information to allow a prediction of whether there is likely to be high incidence of dengue at a specific time and place in the future. This prediction model should not be confused with a detection model, as it is not designed to be used for early detection of a possible outbreak that has already begun and is not yet obvious because it is in a prodromal stage, etc. Although it may complement such detection, this method is instead designed to predict whether or not a high incidence of disease (such as that due to an outbreak) will be occurring several weeks in the future.",

The accuracy of the model depends also on the quality of the data (i.e., the higher the quality, the more accurate the model). This is especially important for the epidemiological data that may have inconsistent reporting over many years. For example, the number of cases may seem to be increasing, but this could be because cases were under-reported previously, or because disease reporting was recently improved by the addition of funding or other resources. Therefore, special care should be taken to see if such discrepancies are present in the data used to develop and fine tune the model. The data mining techniques used in this method are general in the sense that they can use any data. Provided that data of reasonable quality are available, using this method to predict high/low disease incidence for other mosquito-borne diseases is expected to provide similar performance; for example, our preliminary unpublished results for malaria appear promising. The models developed are robust and able to predict with reasonable accuracy even for those Philippine provinces that were never used in model development.",

This was done to make the metrics representative of actual use and to avoid what would effectively be a retrospective prediction. It is also important to note that prediction accuracy was measured using data never before seen by the model. As emphasized in Lowe et al. [18] , doing so provides a more rigorous and objective test of model performance. The novel method described herein showed good performance in predicting multi-week dengue incidence four to seven weeks in advance in Peru [20] , and current results demonstrate that the model predicts weekly dengue incidence in Philippines provinces four weeks in advance with high accuracy. Such advance notification could provide valuable time for public health professionals and others to prepare for and employ disease mitigation strategies, thereby reducing morbidity and mortality. Because the effectiveness of such mitigation could be expected to increase as advances in disease prevention become available for local public health departments, this ability of predictive modeling to gain time for mitigation and consequence management planning should become more valuable.
