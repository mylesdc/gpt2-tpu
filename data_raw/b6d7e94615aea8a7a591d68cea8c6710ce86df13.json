            "text": "from Greco-Arab medicine [5] . Uigur medicine also holds that the human body is comprised of four kinds of body fluids. Abnormal savda is considered the final product of all of body fluids in the presence of abnormal changes. In addition, in Uigur medicine, tumor development is related to the formation of abnormal savda. Since abnormal savda is thick in texture, it can easily result in biliary stasis if deposited in vessel walls, leading to cancer and other intractable diseases. Abnormal Savda Munziq (ASMq) is a natural compound prepared using ten types of herbs, including Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch., Adiantum capillusveneris L., Euphorbia humifusa Willd., Alhagi pseudalhagi Desv. (as show in Table 1 ) [6] . In the previous studies, it was showed that total flavonoids of ASMq can inhibit the proliferation and enhance the antioxidant ability of human cervix cancer HeLa cell [7] . In addition, the Abnormal Savda Munziq had obvious inhibition effect on liver cancer and breast cancer, and the effect of Abnormal Savda Munziq was strong scavenging hydroxyl free radical, protecting DNA oxidative damage and inducing apoptosis [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] .",

In contrast, compared to the CTX group, the tumor masses of all of the ASMq groups increased (p < 0.05), as shown in Table 4 .",

            "text": "In recent years, numerous studies concerning the antitumor effects of ASMq have been conducted. In vitro studies are indicated that ASMq could inhibit the cell proliferation of breast cancer, liver cancer, lymphoma, and cervical cancer cells as well as promotes apoptosis [18] [19] [20] [21] . However, very few reports concerning the in vivo mechanisms of ASMq exist. Our research team has been investigating the in vivo anti-tumor mechanisms of ASMq for a long time. By studying the in vivo mechanisms of ASMq, we found that ASMq shows a certain levels of therapeutic effects on EAC and S180 tumor cell [22] [23] [24] . In order to investigate the in vivo antitumor effects of ASMq on the U27 tumor mouse model, this study focused on the tumor inhibition rate, tumor histopathology, and TGF-\u03b21 and TNF-a protein expression levels of tumor tissues obtained from the U27 tumor model group, CTX group, and low-, medium-, and high-dose of ASMq groups. According to the results, after the administration of ASMq via gavage, the thymic and splenic weights of all the experimental groups are increased. In addition, the hepatic weights of the medium-and high-dose groups are also increased. The increases in the spleen and thymus indexes reflected enhanced T lymphocyte proliferation and improved immune function. Usually, the anti-tumor effects of Chinese herbal medicine are associated with immune function regulation [25, 26] . According to Chinese cancer research standards, herbal medicine is only considered to be effective as an anticancer treatment when the tumor inhibition rate is higher than 30% [27, 28] . The maximum tumor inhibition rate of ASMq within the tested dosage range was not as high as that of the CTX group; however, both of these substances yielded tumor inhibition rates greater than 30%, indicating that CTX and ASMq could both inhibits varying degrees of U27 tumor growth. Furthermore, the HE staining of the tumor tissue revealed necrosis and various cell sizes in the U27 model group and improved lesions in the CTX and ASMq groups. However, the CTX and ASMq groups still exhibited some areas of necrosis and edema. These results further confirmed the inhibitory effects of ASMq on U27 tumors.",

            "text": "TGF-\u03b2 is a multifunctional cytokine that exists in a wide variety of normal and transformed cells. In fact, almost all cells are capable of producing TGF-\u03b2 and expressing its receptors [29, 30] . TGF-\u03b21 is a key factor in the regulation of the tumor epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). TGF-\u03b21, which is involved in cell proliferation and differentiation as well as the formation of the extracellular matrix, can promote tumor growth [31, 32] . According to previous studies, TGF-\u03b21 could reduce the activity of NK cells and promote tumor cell proliferation and differentiation. Based on previous researches, high expression levels of TGF-\u03b21 has been observed in a variety of tumors [33, 34] . According to the results of this study, the tumor tissues obtained from the U27 model group demonstrated significantly higher levels of TGF-\u03b21 expression than the CTX group and the low-, medium-, and high-dose ASMq groups. These findings are consistent with the high expression rates of TGF-\u03b21 in various malignant tumors. The decreased expression of TGF-\u03b21 in the CTX and ASMq groups possibly relating to its downregulation by CTX and ASMq effects. Such as, after treating liver cancer in mice with tnshinone (Tan) IIA nanoparticles, significant tumor necrosis occurred and TGF-\u03b21 expression was decreased, indicating that the anti-tumor effects of Tan IIA could function by inhibiting TGF-\u03b21 expression [35] . Interestingly, some relating researches shows that TGF-\u03b2 could directly or indirectly inhibits the production of TNF-\u03b1 [36, 37] , indicating that low concentrations of TGF-\u03b2 were associated with high concentrations of TNF-\u03b1. TNF-\u03b1 induces the tumor immune response and cell differentiation, promotes the production of a variety of cytokines by mononuclear cells and T cells, and induce tumor cell apoptosis and directly kill tumor cells [38] [39] [40] . In our study, the TNF-\u03b1 protein expression levels of the low-, medium-, and high-dose ASMq groups are significantly higher than those of the U27 model group and CTX group. Recent studies shows that the anti-tumor effects of TNF-\u03b1 were primarily enhanced by the body's cellular and humoral immune functions, inhibiting tumor angiogenesis and directly inducing tumor cell apoptosis [41, 42] . Serum TNF-\u03b1 and IL-12 levels has been reported to be increased in tumor-bearing mice treated with astragalus polysaccharides (APS)-induced mature dendritic cell (DC) vaccine therapy, suggesting that the anti-tumor effects of this therapy could stimulates the immune cells of tumor-bearing mice to produce antitumor cytokines TNF-\u03b1 and IL-12 [43] . Our research results also suggests that ASMq shows anti-tumor effects through stimulating immune cells to produce anti-tumor cytokines.",
