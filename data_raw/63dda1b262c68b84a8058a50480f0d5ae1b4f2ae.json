The re-emergence of CHIKV has resulted in numerous outbreaks in the eastern hemisphere, and threatens to expand in the foreseeable future. Unfortunately, no effective treatment is currently available. The present study reports the use of resazurin in a cell-based high-throughput assay, and an image-based high-content assay to identify and characterize inhibitors of CHIKV-infection in vitro. CHIKV is a highly cytopathic virus that rapidly kills infected cells. Thus, cell viability of HuH-7 cells infected with CHIKV in the presence of compounds was determined by measuring metabolic reduction of resazurin to identify inhibitors of CHIKV-associated cell death. A kinase inhibitor library of 4,000 compounds was screened against CHIKV infection of HuH-7 cells using the resazurin reduction assay, and the cell toxicity was also measured in non-infected cells. Seventy-two compounds showing $50% inhibition property against CHIKV at 10 mM were selected as primary hits. Four compounds having a benzofuran core scaffold (CND0335, CND0364, CND0366 and CND0415), one pyrrolopyridine (CND0545) and one thiazol-carboxamide (CND3514) inhibited CHIKV-associated cell death in a dose-dependent manner, with EC 50 values between 2.2 mM and 7.1 mM. Based on image analysis, these 6 hit compounds did not inhibit CHIKV replication in the host cell. However, CHIKV-infected cells manifested less prominent apoptotic blebs typical of CHIKV cytopathic effect compared with the control infection. Moreover, treatment with these compounds reduced viral titers in the medium of CHIKV-infected cells by up to 100-fold. In conclusion, this cell-based high-throughput screening assay using resazurin, combined with the image-based high content assay approach identified compounds against CHIKV having a novel antiviral activity -inhibition of virus-induced CPE -likely by targeting kinases involved in apoptosis.",

            "text": "Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-borne pathogen belonging to the Semliki Forest antigenic complex of the genus Alphavirus, family Togaviridae [1] . CHIKV has a single, positive strand linear RNA genome of approximately 11.7 kb and is comprised of two open reading frames (ORF): a 59 non-structural ORF encoding the non-structural polyprotein, and a 39 structural ORF that encodes the structural polyprotein of the virus [2] . A unique feature shared by CHIKV with other members of the family Togaviridae is the translation of the structural polyprotein from the 26S mRNA, which is internally transcribed from the negative strand template through the initiation of the 26S subgenomic promoter, located at the junction region between the non-structural and structural ORFs. Based on the genomic organization of other related alphaviruses, the CHIKV genome is considered to be: 59-nsP1-nsP2-nsP3-nsP4-junction region-C-E3-E2-6k-E1-poly(A)-39 [3] . CHIKV virions have a spherical capsid with icosahedral symmetry surrounded by a lipid bilayer envelope (about 70 nm in diameter) derived from the host cell membrane during virus budding. Two viral glycoproteins embedded in the envelope, E2 and E1, direct the attachment to the host cell membrane and subsequent fusion with the endosomal membrane, respectively [4, 5] . CHIKV is transmitted between human hosts by blood-feeding female mosquitoes of the Aedes species, particularly Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus, often resulting in a clinical condition known as chikungunya fever (CHIKF) [6, 7] . Clinical symptoms of CHIKV infection are similar to that of other arthrogenic alphaviruses like Sindbis virus (SINV), Mayaro virus (MAYV) O'nyong-nyong virus (ONNV) and Ross River virus (RRV), with arthralgia being the hallmark feature [8] .",

Several imported cases of CHIKF have also been reported in Europe [10] . The occurrence of chikungunya epidemics has been unpredictable, with several outbreaks occurring at irregular intervals in Africa and Asia between 1960 and 1980 [11] . Following nearly 2 decades of relative quiescence, CHIKV has re-emerged in the last decade, causing major outbreaks in West Africa and among the islands in the Indian Ocean like Madagascar, Comoro, Mayonette and La R\u00e9union. At the same time, CHIKV became entrenched in India and Southeast Asia [12] [13] [14] . Imported CHIKV cases have reached as far as Japan, China, Taiwan, parts of Europe and the United States of America [15] . As of 2012, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have listed 46 countries affected by CHIKV (see http://www.cdc.gov/chikungunya/map/index. html).

In some cases, it is followed by chronic pain characterized by persistent arthralgia that can last from weeks to years [18, 19] . The acute symptoms have some similarities with classical dengue, often resulting in misdiagnosis of chikungunya cases in dengue endemic areas in the absence of laboratory confirmation. However, the two can be differentiated since CHIKV infection is more commonly associated with prolonged arthralgia affecting multiple joints, while classical and severe dengue manifest hemorrhagic symptoms [20] . CHIKV infection is generally none life-threatening. Nevertheless, the epidemic in La R\u00e9union that resulted in 265,000 CHIKF cases (roughly one-third of the population) with at least 237 CHIKV-related deaths, and recent reports of more severe clinical manifestation [21, 22] suggest the need to better understand the biology and clinical implications of CHIKV infection. In addition, the global expansion and increased health risks associated with CHIKV infections has prompted the demand for more aggressive efforts to find preventive and therapeutic interventions against this particular disease.",

The assay uses resazurin, an oxidized, nonfluorescent blue dye that is converted to the reduced, and highly fluorescent pink-colored resorufin through oxidation-reduction reaction, to measure cellular metabolic activity and cell viability [32, 33] . Using this resazurin reduction assay, a small subset of the BioFocus kinase inhibitor library was screened for compounds that could inhibit CHIKV-associated cell death in vitro then confirmed their activities by dose-response curves, virus yield reduction and microneutralization assays. The antiviral activity of the hit compounds was further analyzed using an innovative image-based high content assay to understand the underlying mechanism of action. In addition, the inhibitory properties of the CHIKV primary hits against dengue serotype 2 (DENV2) in a high-content assay screening of the same compound library previously reported [34] was investigated to determine if there are common novel inhibitors between these two unrelated arboviruses.",

At present, only two antiviral compounds (chloroquine and ribavirin) that inhibit viral infection in vitro have been used in clinical cases of chikungunya infections. However, neither of these compounds have shown strong efficacy in vivo. Recent attempts to identify new antiviral candidates for CHIKV using cell-based phenotypic approach have been reported. In this study, we developed a simple cell-based highthroughput assay using resazurin to identify potential anti-CHIKV compounds. This high-throughput assay is based on the metabolic reduction of resazurin to the highly fluorescent resorufin by viable cells as an indicator of activity against CHIKV-induced CPE. We screened 4,000 small molecules belonging to the BioFocus kinase inhibitor chemical library and found a cluster of related molecules with antiviral activity against CHIKV. Finally, we characterized the putative mode of action of these active compounds using an image-based high content assay and conventional virological methods (i.e., virus yield reduction assay, microneutralization assay).",

The latter provides a tool to manipulate and analyze high-content screening data. Within this framework the plugin developed can be used to analyze single or multiple images from well-plate readouts. CHIKV high-content assay analysis is based on image acquired by measuring two different channels: DAPIstained nuclei and GFP-expressing cells signals emitted at 450 nm and 540 nm, respectively. The cell number was quantified in the DAPI image using a watershed segmentation method [38] . If image is a landscape of peaks and basins, altitude being pixel intensity, then watershed is the flooding of basins with liquid which altitude is progressively increased on the whole image starting from image minima. Each time a local minima is reached a liquid with a new color appears. When 2 liquids meet they do not mix and form a boundary. This flooding process is terminated using a threshold that prevents inclusion of the background in the colored region. Before applying the watershed, unwanted minima due to image noise are filtered out by image blurring. Since nuclei in the DAPI Images are peaks rather than basins, the process is applied to the inverted image. Finally the output is an image where each nuclei region is identified by a unique color. The cell is the number of such defined regions. CHIKV-infected cells were identified by analyzing the degree of overlap between positive GFP signal, selected with a manually defined threshold, and individual nuclei. A cell is considered infected if at least half of its nucleus overlaps with the positive GFP signal. This criterion minimizes false detection due to noise in the GFP signal selection. The percentage of CHIKV-infected cells is defined as the ratio between the detected nuclei overlapping with the positive GFP signal and the total number of detected nuclei.",

Using an initial seeding density for HuH-7 at 5610 3 Figure 1C ). Treatment of HuH-7 cells with 50 mM CPZ resulted in a measured fluorescence readout (240,842614,730 RFU) that was nearly identical with EMPTY wells (227,44762,446 RFU), suggesting complete abolition of metabolic activity. In comparison, CHIKV-infected HuH-7 showed higher fluorescence readout (398,579613,294 RFU), but was still significantly lower than that of MOCK-infected HuH-7 (801,587622,230 RFU). It has been reported previously that short-term resazurin reduction occurs in dying cells caused by the production of free and unpaired electrons [45] While a good fluorescent signal can be achieved from MOCK-infected cells, distinguishable from that of CPZ-treated cells and EMPTY wells, within 6 hours after treatment with resazurin, the 12-hour treatment was necessary to have a clear separation of fluorescent signals between MOCK-infected and CHIKV-infected cells (data not shown).",

Figure 2A shows the scatter-plot distribution of the percent inhibition for the 0.5% DMSO vehicle, 5 mM MPA and MOCK-infected groups. The average Z'-factor between the CHIKV-infected 0.5% DMSO vehicle and 5 mM MPA-treated groups in the 15 384-well test plates was 0.57860.075 (Z'-factors ranged from 0.460 to 0.703) while the average Z'-factor between the CHIKV-infected 0.5% DMSO vehicle and MOCK-infected groups was 0.64560.059 (Z' factors ranged from 0.544 to 0.724). The RFU of the 0.5% DMSO vehicle negative control group showed a higher degree of variability (CV = 13.963.3%) compared with those of the positive control groups 25 mM MPA-treated (CV = 8.161.6%) and MOCK-infected (CV = 5.161.3%). While the 0.5% DMSO vehicle control group showed a CV slightly higher than 10%, the Z'-factors between the MOCK-infected and 0.5% DMSO vehicle control groups were .0.5 in all 15 test plates, indicating a reasonable separation between positive and negative controls. These findings demonstrate the reliability of the resazurin reduction assay for use in the CHIKV high-throughput screening. Figure 2B shows the activity and toxicity of 3 reference compounds (bafilomycin A1, chloroquine and mycophenolic acid) against CHIKV infection in HuH-7. BAF showed an EC 50 value of 56 nM. Since BAF did not exhibit .50% toxicity at the highest concentration tested (200 nM), a projected CC 50 value 237 nM was extrapolated based on the trend of the percent viability curve. For CQ, the EC 50 and CC 50 values were determined at 29 mM and 90 mM, respectively. A bell-shaped curve was observed for the percent inhibition as the concentration of CQ approached 100 mM and coincided with the steep decline in percent viability, indicating high toxicity at 100 mM. MPA showed an EC 50 value of 1.6 mM, with no observable cytotoxicity at the highest concentration tested (100 mM). The antiviral activity of MPA determined by the resazurin reduction assay was within the range of the 50% inhibitory concentration of MPA previously reported (1.5 mM-4.1 mM) [29] , while the measured antiviral activity and toxicity of BAF and CQ were within 3-fold of the observed inhibitory property from previously published reports [46, 47] . Interestingly, MPA treatment of CHIKV-infected HuH-7 cells at concentrations $3.25 mM resulted in higher fluorescence readout compared with non-infected HuH-7 treated with the same amount of the compound. The underlying mechanism for this observed phenomenon has not been elucidated.",

The measured RFU from each compound treatment was normalized as percent viability using the average RFU of MOCK-infected and CPZ 50 mM -treated HuH-7. Figures 3A shows the overview of the results of the CHIKV high-throughput assay screening of the BioFocus kinase inhibitor library, with the percent viability of each treatment represented by colored dots. A histogram of the percent viability showing the frequency distribution for each treatment (BioFocus compounds, CPZ, DMSO and MOCK) is shown in Figure 3B . The average percent viability of CHIKV-infected HuH-7 cells treated with 0.5% DMSO vehicle from plate to plate ranges between 33.99%67.51% and 38.36%67.39%. Using the upper limit of this range, the computed statistical cut-off (m+4s) was 67.92% viability. Based on this computed value, statistical cut-off was rounded off to 70% viability. A total of 72 compounds from the BioFocus kinase inhibitor library showed $70% viability in the CHIKV high-throughput screening and were selected as primary hits, giving a hit rate of 1.8%. The computed percent inhibition of these 72 hit compounds against CHIKV-associated cell death was .50% (Figure S2 ).

However, follow-up on this compound was discontinued after hit confirmation by dose-response curve did not reveal any clear antiviral activities against CHIKV (data not shown).

None of the confirmed hits exhibited significant toxicity in HuH-7 cells at the highest concentration tested. Conversely, some showed an increase in viability at higher concentrations based on the resazurin reduction readout. A counter-screen to determine if the compounds can contribute to the increased readout was carried out by mixing the compounds with resazurin in the medium. As shown in the Table S1 , there was no increase in the RFU readout by the compounds alone, thus ruling out the direct reaction of resazurin with these particular compounds.

            "text": "The effect of the 6 hit compounds on CHIKV-118-GFP infection of HuH-7 cells was evaluated by quantifying GFPexpressing GFP and comparing cell morphology during infection. The inhibitory properties of two reference compounds and the 6 confirmed hit compounds against CHIKV-118-GFP were evaluated by image analysis using the customized plug-in on the Image Mining platform (see Figure 6A ). Chloroquine, a lysosomotropic agent that blocks viral entry by preventing pH dependent fusion [49] , inhibited CHIKV-118-GFP infection by 75.6% at 50 mM. Mycophenolic acid, an inhibitor of GMP synthesis that results in decreased synthesis of RNA and DNA [50] , inhibited more than 92% of infection at 50 mM. In contrast to CQ and MPA, none of the 6 hit compounds exhibited significant inhibition of CHIKV-118-GFP infection in HuH-7. The benzofuran and thiazol-4carboxamide compounds showed ,10% inhibition at 20 mM, with the exception of CND0364 (19.7% inhibition at 20 mM). Also, the pyrrolopyridine compound CND0545 only inhibited 28.3% of infection at 20 mM. However, it was observed that in the presence of the 6 hit compounds, the morphology of CHIKVinfected cells showed less apoptotic blebs compared with those treated with the DMSO vehicle control. Furthermore, the culture supernatant of CHIKV-infected HuH-7 cells showed a 10-to 100folds decrease (1.16-2.01 log titer reduction) in viral titer when treated with the hit compounds compared to the DMSO vehicle control ( Figure 6B) . Interestingly, the reduction in viral titers resulting from the treatment of 6 hit compounds was comparable with that of chloroquine treatment (1.88 log titer reduction). Compounds CND0364 and CND0545, which exhibited the highest reduction in viral titers (1.69 log and 2.01 log titer reduction, respectively), inhibited the clearing of the cell monolayer caused by CHIKV-induced CPE at 12.5 mM and 25 mM, respectively in the microneutralization assay ( Figure 7 ).",

            "text": "In recent years, the number and distribution of CHIKV cases have dramatically increased, culminating in the most devastating outbreak recorded between 2005-2006 in La R\u00e9union [14, 22] . The rising incidence of chikungunya outbreaks has spurned renewed efforts to find an effective vaccine to address this potential emerging epidemic [51] . Ironically, very few studies focusing on CHIKV antiviral drugs have been reported until recently. The use of chloroquine, a quinolone-containing drug used as an antimalarial drug [52] , for therapeutic intervention of CHIKV-associated arthralgia was previously suggested [53] . While chloroquine showed inhibitory properties against CHIKV infection in vitro, it has a narrow selectivity index in cell cultures [46] . Furthermore, double-blind placebo-controlled randomized trial for treatment of acute chikungunya infections in La R\u00e9union with chloriquine did not show any significant benefits in the use of this drug [54] . Ribavirin, a nucleoside analogue prodrug that has been widely used as an antiviral for several DNA and RNA viruses [55] , was also proposed as a therapeutic drug to treat chikungunyaassociated arthritis [28] . However, no further follow-up studies were pursued. Another antiviral drug originally used for treatment of influenza and other respiratory viruses -arbidol -was also reported to have potent antiviral properties against CHIKV in vitro, and was found to bind to the E2 domain of the viral envelope protein and interfere with viral attachment on host cell receptor [27] . Recently, a bioactivity screening method to identify inhibitors of alphavirus entry and replication was reported [29] . The assays performed in this particular screening involved the use of a non-cytotoxic CHIKV replicon expressing EGFP and Rluc and a SFV surrogate model. The study reported several active 5,7dihydroxyflavones (e.g. apigenin, chrysin, naringenin and silybin) from a collection of natural products that suppresses CHIKV and SFV replication, suggesting these molecules may be good antiviral candidates against alphavirus infections. Another cell-based phenotypic assay that identify inhibitors of CHIKV nsP2mediated transcriptional shutoff was also recently reported [30] .",

            "text": "Here we reported the development of a simple cell-based highthroughput assay using resazurin for the screening of bioactive molecules against CHIKV. Resazurin has been used mainly for detecting microbial contamination in milk and other food products for the past 70 years [56, 57] . However in the last 20 years, several resazurin-based assays have been developed for screening or evaluation of active molecules against microbial pathogens like Mycobacterium sp. [58, 59] , Trichomonas vaginalis [60] , Trypanosoma brucei [61] , Leishmania sp. [36] , Aspergillus fumigatus [62] , as well as cancer [63, 64] and Clostridium perfringens e-toxin [65] . The resazurin reduction assay assesses cell viability by measuring the metabolic capacity of these cells to reduce resazurin (also known as Alamar blue) to the highly fluorescent resorufin. It has been shown that there is a positive linear correlation between metabolic reduction of resazurin and the number of viable cells [33, 66] . In viable eukaryotic cells, the conversion of resazurin to resorufin is facilitated by mitochondrial reductases and diaphorases such as dihydrolipoamine dehydrogenase (EC 1.8.1.4,), NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase (EC 1.6.99.2) and flavin reductase (EC 1.6.99.1) found in the mitochondria or cytoplasm [33, 67] . CHIKV causes highly cytopathic infection in a wide variety of cells of vertebrate origin, resulting in rapid death of infected cells by apoptosis [46] . Thus, the resazurin reduction assay was used to identify potential CHIKV inhibitors by measuring cell viability, which serves as an indicator of inhibitory property against CHIKV-associated cell death. Unlike the non-cytotoxic CHIKV replicon used for the bioactive screening, our CHIKV high-throughput assay uses an infectious recombinant CHIKV (CHIKV-118-GFP) that is highly cytopathic in HuH-7 cells. Screening the 4,000 compound subset of the BioFocus kinase inhibitor library using the resazurin reduction assay identified 6 active compounds that inhibit CHIKVassociated cell death -4 having a benzofuran core scaffold, 1 with a pyrrolopyridine scaffold, and 1 with a thiazol-carboxamide scaffoldwith EC 50 in the single-digit micromolar range. However, it was observed that the inhibitory properties of the active compounds at the highest concentration tested (50 mM) were not enough for the metabolic activity of the host cell infected with CHIKV to reach the same level as that of non-infected cells. Moreover, the percentage of CHIKV-infected cells in the image-based high-content assay of CHIKV-118-GFP infection did not diminish significantly even in the presence of 20 mM concentration of the active compounds, an indication that the their activity have little or no effect in the viral entry process or viral replication machinery. Interestingly, despite the high percentage of CHIKV-infected cells, treatment with 20 mM of the active compounds reduced viral titers up to 100-fold, suggesting that their activity likely targets the later stages of viral infection (i.e., virus assembly and release).",

            "text": "Several factors have been implicated in the persistence of arthralgia after CHIKV infection. After CHIKV replicates in the liver, it targets muscle satellite cells, as well as other cells and tissues like muscle, joint and fibroblasts [68, 69] . Persistence of CHIKV infection in microglial cells and perivascular synovial macrophages have been shown to trigger host-derived inflammatory cytokine responses that contribute directly to synovial tissue damage [70] [71] [72] [73] . Viral persistence has been attributed to the ability of the virus to evade the host immune response by different mechanisms. Recently, a novel mechanism of immune evasion by CHIKV involving the host cell's apoptotic machinery has been described. CHIKV particles have been shown to hide in apoptotic blebs of infected cells and invade neighboring cells or cells that are otherwise refractory to CHIKV alone, such as macrophages, through phagocytosis of these apoptotic bodies [6, 74] . The two active compounds that yielded the highest reduction in CHIKV viral titers (CND0364 and CND0545) were shown to inhibit CHIKV-induced CPE in the microneutralization assay. The phenotypic characteristic of CHIKV-118-GFP infected HuH-7 cells treated with the benzofuran compound CND0364 and pyrrolopyridine compound CND0545 showed a dramatic reduction in the formation of apoptotic blebs compared with the DMSO vehicle control treatment, as well as chloroquine treatment (Figure 8 ). These findings suggest that the benzofuran and pyrrolyridine compounds impede the efficient dissemination of CHIKV into the neighboring cells by interfering with the virusinduced apoptotic machinery.",

It has been reported that CHIKV dsRNA activates dsRNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR). PKR phosphorylates translation initiation factor 2-alpha (eIF2a) and plays a role, albeit not essential, in CHIKV-associated cellular translational shutoff [75] . Ironically, it has been shown Figure 8 . Inhibition of CHIKV-associated apoptotic bodies. HuH-7 cells infected with CHIKV-118-GFP expressing GFP at 24 hpi. The number of observed apoptotic blebs associated with CHIKV infection (marked by white arrows) were significantly lower when treated with the reference compound MPA and hit compounds CND0364 and CND0545. In contrast, apoptotic blebs were still prominent in CHIKV-infected HuH-7 cells in the presence of CQ. (false-color imaging were applied). doi:10.1371/journal.pntd.0002471.g008 recently that CHIKV nsP4 suppresses eIF2a phosphorylation that regulates the PKR-like ER resident kinase (PERK) pathway [76] , an ER stress pathway implicated in mediating cell apoptosis [77] . CHIKV has also been reported to trigger an autophagic process that promotes viral replication [78] . However, CHIKV-induced autophagy delays caspase-dependent cell death and regulates viral spread [79] . Kinases like vacuolar protein sorting 34 (Vps34) complex and cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) are involved in upor down-regulating autophagy [80] .",

In addition, since CHIKV displays a wide tropism in cell culture. It will be of interest to determine the antiviral activity of these compounds in other relevant cell lines and primary cells that are natural targets of the virus [46, 81] . In summary, the work present here describes the application of a cell-based highthroughput assay system using resazurin and an image-based high content assay approach to screen a kinase-focused chemical library for potential inhibitors of CHIKV. With these two assays, compounds that interfere with CHIKV-induced CPE, which have been shown to play a role in the efficient dissemination of the virus, were identified. The six active compounds identified here could be used to further investigate the mechanisms involved in CHIKV-induced CPE, as well as serve as a starting point for the development of new antiviral drug candidates for CHIKV. Moreover, the cell-based high throughput assay using resazurin and image-based high-content assay systems described here could be applied in the screening other compound libraries for potential CHIKV inhibitors.

Wells of the 384-well plate are spotted with 10 mM test compounds or 0.5% DMSO vehicle, then incubated with HuH-7 and CHIKV-118-GFP. Cell viability is assessed by measuring converted resorufin at excitation/emission wavelength of 531/572 nm.
