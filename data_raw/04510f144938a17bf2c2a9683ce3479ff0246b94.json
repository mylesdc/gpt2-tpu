Mechanistically, when compared with control miRNA, miRNA-21 showed no effect on capsid protein VP1 expression and viral load within host cells, while significantly reversing CVB3-induced caspase-3 activation and cell apoptosis rate, further promoting proliferation of infected cells, which indicates the inhibitory effect of miRNA-21 on CVB3 progeny release.

Virus elimination from vital organs is considered as a key therapeutic strategy to treat CVB3-associated diseases. However, currently available drugs for the treatment of CVB3 infection are broad-spectrum antiviral drugs with limited efficacy [3] [4] [5] .

The p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 suppresses CVB3-induced Hela cell apoptosis and viral progeny release, suggesting that the p38 MAPK signaling is essential for cytopathic effects and life cycle of CVB3 in infected cells [12] . Pharmacological inhibition of p38 MAPK phosphorylation has been shown to effectively suppress CVB3 replication and release both in vitro and in vivo [5, 13] . In addition, MAP2K3 is one of the direct upstream activators of p38 MAPK [14] . At 48 and 72 h post human cytomegalovirus infection, increased activity of MAP2K3 is critical to maintain p38 activation, which is necessary for viral DNA replication [15] .

Previous reports have demonstrated that many viruses encode miRNAs or exploit host miRNAs to modulate host and/or viral gene expression. For example, Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus can encode 12 miRNA precursors, which generate 25 mature miRNAs. Some of them share seed sequences with host miRNAs, targeting host mRNAs involved in immune responses [17, 18] . In addition, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) induces miRNA-29a that specifically targets HIV-1 3\u2032UTR in infected cells to modulate its own life cycle [19] . Based on miRNA-mediated host-virus interactions, using miRNAs to target mechanisms that promote viral infection and replication is an emerging and promising antiviral strategy. Its feasibility has been demonstrated in several studies, such as miR-130a-mediated suppression of pyruvate kinase in liver and red blood cells inhibits pyruvate production, which is critical for hepatitis B and C virus replication [20] , and the mimics of miR-124, miR-24, and miR-744 that target the p38 MAPK signaling exhibit antiviral effects in both influenza and respiratory syncytial virus infection [21] .",

CVB3 infection in HeLa cells leads to activation of P38 MAPK, which is downstream of MAP2K3 [12, 13] . To determine whether CVB3 induced miRNA-21 upregulation could affect MAP2K3 levels, we examined continuous changes of MAP2K3 expression upon CVB3 infection. MAP2K3 was upregulated significantly 1 h post CVB infection and sustained at high levels 7 h post infection, however, the expression level dropped at 12 h (Fig. 1b) , which seems to be the result of high level of miRNA-21 and in line with our previous in vivo result [22] . To further assess the effects of CVB3 on associated P38MAPK pathways, we examined phosphorylation of P38 MAPK (P-P38) and phosphorylation of heat shock protein 27 (P-HSP27), which is a downstream substrate of p38 MAPK pathway and found the expression of P-P38 and P-HSP27 were almost in accordance with MAP2K3, both of them had high levels at 2-7 h while decreased at 12 h (Fig. 1b) . Bioinformatics analysis suggests that the 3\u2032UTR of MAP2K3 is a candidate target for miRNA-21 (Fig. 1c) . To assess this possibility, we performed luciferase reporter assays in HEK293 cells. miRNA-21 mimic specifically reduced the activity of a reporter containing the 3\u2032UTR of MAP2K3, while no effect was apparent with the control miRNA or mutated target (Fig. 1d) . On the basis of these findings, we conclude that MAP2K3 participate in CVB3 infection process and miRNA-21 has the potential to inhibit MAP2K3 expression. (Fig. 2a) . We further detected CVB3 in the supernatant and found that inhibition of P38 activation induced significant reduction of viral progeny release (Fig. 2b) .",

HeLa cells were transduced with Lenti-miRNA-21 at MOI = 10, followed by CVB3 infection at MOI = 1 at 3 days after transduction. Cells transduced with Lenti-miR-CON and sham-infected cells were used as controls. a Western blot assay was conducted to detect CVB3 capsid protein VP1 at 12 h post infection. Representative results from 3 independent experiments are shown. b Intracellular viral titers were detected at 12 h post CVB3 infection. c Cell lysates were harvested and caspase-3 activity was detected using a fluorogenic substrate at indicated time points. d Immunoblot analysis of whole-cell protein lysates from CVB3 infected cells probed with cleave-caspase 3 and Bax antibody. e CVB3 induces apoptosis was measured by Annexin-V binding to externalized phosphatidylserine, representative FACS data of annexin-V + apoptotic cells were shown. Cell viability assay was performed at multiple time points, with different amounts of miRNA-21 without (f) or with CVB3 infection (g). The viability of HeLa cell was determined by MTS assay at indicated time points, (*p < 0.05) CVB3 infection caused a dramatic increase in the caspase-3 activity in miR-CON-transfected cells compared with sham infection in a time-dependent manner, suggesting that CVB3 might induce apoptosis in infected cells. Importantly, miRNA-21 could significantly reverse the inductive effect of CVB3 on caspase-3 activation compared with miR-CON. Apoptosis related Cleavedcaspase 3 and Bax expression 12 h post infection were also detected and were found decreased in the miRNA-21 treated group, we further assayed apoptosis rate by Annexin V-FITC/PI staining assay and found miRNA-21 could inhibit apoptosis rate compared with controlgroup, Fig. 4d , e. These results suggested a potential protective role of miRNA-21 against CVB3-induced apoptosis in infected cells. Indeed, miRNA-21 showed no effect on the proliferation of uninfected Hela cells while significantly promoting the proliferation in CVB3infected cells in a dose-and time-dependent manner (Fig. 4f, g) , indicating that miRNA-21 may protect infected cells against CVB3-induced apoptosis, which further improves cell survival. Taken together, these results suggest that the inhibition of CVB3 release from miRNA-21-overexpressing cells is likely attributed to miRNA-21-exerted protection against CVB3-induced apoptosis at least in the early phases of infection.",

Our previous study showed that miRNA-21 that potentially targets MAP2K3 is upregulated in the heart of mice with CVB3-induced myocarditis [22] . In addition, miRNA-21 has been shown to have beneficial effects on myocardial infarct size in murine models [26] . However, the association of miRNA-21 with the MAP2K3/P38 MAPK signaling in the context of CVB3 infection remains unclear. In the present study, we found that miRNA-21 may inhibit CVB3 viral progeny release through targeting the MAP2K3/P38 MAPK signaling pathway in vitro. In addition, miRNA-21 pretreatment could reduce viral titer within the heart and improve pathological alterations and clinical outcomes in a mouse model of CVB3 infection. These findings suggest that miRNA-21 may serve as a potential therapeutic agent in the treatment of CVB3associated diseases.",

When compared with those observed at earlier time points, the miRNA-21 expression in Hela cells was dramatically upregulated at 12 h following CVB3 infection, whereas the protein levels of MAP2K3 and phosphorylated downstream targets, including P-P38 and P-HSP27, were remarkably decreased accordingly, suggesting an association between miRNA-21 and the MAP2K3/P38 MAPK signaling in the context of CVB3 infection. The results of a luciferase reporter assay further confirmed that MAP2K3 is a potential target of miRNA-21, which is consistent with a previous report [27] . These findings indicate that CVB3 infection can induce miRNA-21 upregulation in host cells, leading to a suppression of the MAP2K3/P38 MAPK signaling.",

Significant reduction in the amount of released virus in response to siMAP2K3 or P38 inhibitor was observed at 12 and 24 h postinfection, suggesting that activation of the MAP2K3/P38 MAPK signaling is indispensable for CVB3 life cycle. Similar results were also observed in infected cells overexpressing miRNA-21 compared with control miRNA first at 7 h post infection and persisted for at least 48 h, accompanied by downregulation of MAP2K3 and dephosphorylation of downstream targets. These findings suggest that miRNA-21 may inhibit CVB3 progeny release via suppression of the MAP2K3/P38 MAPK signaling, which is supported by previous studies [13, 35] . The inhibition ability of miRNA-21 was comparable to siRNA-MAP2K3 and P38 MAPK specific inhibitor SB203580, and could reach to an extent for more than .

No significant change in VP1 expression and viral load was observed between infected cells overexpressing miRNA-21 and control miRNA, suggesting that miRNA-21 might not affect CVB3 replication in infected cells at least within 24 h post infection. Because decreased viral progeny release may result from inhibited host cell apoptosis [33] , we speculated that miRNA-21 might protect infected cells from apoptosis. Therefore, we next evaluated the caspase-3 activity and cell proliferation in miRNA-21-overexpressing infected cells. We found that miRNA-21 significantly inhibited the inducive effect of CVB3 on caspase-3 activation and promoted infected cell proliferation in a dose-and time-dependent manner. We also detected apoptosis related cleaved-caspase 3 and Bax expression in miRNA-21-treated infected cells, and apoptosis were also evaluated by Annexin-V/ PI staining by flow cytometric, results showed that apoptosis related protein were decreased in the miRNA-21treated group and apoptosis rate were also declined, suggesting that miRNA-21 might protect host cells from CVB3-induced apoptosis, leading to an improvement in cell survival. A previous study showed that overexpression of antiapoptotic proteins or treatment with a general caspase inhibitor prevents CVB3 virus progeny release at 10 h following infection, indicating that host cell apoptosis facilitates progeny release from infected cells [33] . Thus, the inhibitory effect of miRNA-21 on host cell apoptosis might contribute to decreased viral release at least during the initial stage of viral infection.",

However, whether miRNA-21 is favorable or unfavorable to cardiovascular system remains controversial [24, 26, 38] , which may partially due to different mouse strains used in these studies. In the present study, we established a CVB3 infection model using male BALB/c mice and observed significantly reduced CVB3 titer and suppressed MAP2K3/P38 MAPK signaling in the heart tissue of miRNA-21-pretreated mice, which is in agreement with our in vitro data. In addition, the mice pretreated with miRNA-21 exhibited improved pathological alterations, decreased percentage of apoptosis and apoptosis related cleaved-caspase 3 expression in the heart, what is important, miRNA-21 treatment also prolonged survival time. These data suggest that miRNA-21 may be beneficial for the host during CVB3 infection. However, due to insufficient funding support, we did not include a miRNA-21 knockout mouse model in this study to provide more convincing evidence, which needs to be addressed in the future.",
