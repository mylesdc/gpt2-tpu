For RSV quantitative viral load, the PCR threshold cycles of the nasal swab samples were compared to those of a standard curve generated by amplification of known numbers of RNA transcripts of the PCR amplicons. 11, 12 We included patients with hematologic malignancy, solid organ transplant (SOT), or hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) who were outpatient at the time of diagnosis. Sociodemographic, clinical, laboratory, and radiologic data were abstracted from the electronic medical chart using a standardized form in Project REDCap. 13 An illness episode was defined as the presence of at least one respiratory symptom (cough, wheezing, increased work of breathing, rhinorrhea, and/or apnea) in a patient with RSV detected by laboratory testing. The end of the illness episode was defined as a minimum of 14 days following symptom resolution. Only the first RSV illness episode for each patient was included in this analysis. RSV-associated hospitalization was classified based on provider documentation of reason for hospitalization in the medical record.",

In contrast to reports of RSV infection in hospitalized immunocompromised children, these patients were less likely to be severely immunocompromised given their outpatient status. Few patients in our study received ribavirin and/or IVIG or supportive care with supplemental oxygen, although evaluation of these patients included chest imaging in 37% and antibiotic use in 20%. The overall impact of RSV alone on receipt of chemotherapy or immunosuppressive therapy was difficult to assess, but in this group of immunocompromised middleaged children who were likely to have previously experienced RSV infection, the immediate consequences of RSV infection were generally not severe.",

            "text": "No child died in our study due to RSV-related causes in our study. Previous studies reported mortality rates ranging from 3 to 5% in patients with chronic lung disease or congenital heart disease to 12-55% in HCT recipients. 14, 15 In a single-center study of pediatric immunocompromised inpatients, 5% mortality was reported, with an ICU admission rate of 28%. 16 We believe that the low mortality in our population is due to the outpatient population, as well as advances in supportive care and more sensitive laboratory diagnostic techniques that enable more timely and sensitive detection of RSV infection. 12 Fever was associated with risk of hospitalization in our study, while patients with hematologic malignancy were less likely to be hospitalized. El-Saleeby and colleagues found that lymphopenia and younger age were risk factors for RSVassociated LRTI, neither of which was associated with hospitalization in our study. 17 Compared to the El-Saleeby study, we also had a higher proportion of SOT recipients, who may be less immunocompromised depending on time since transplant and degree of immunosuppression. In this study, only a minority of the solid organ transplant recipients in this study were hospitalized and none died. Single institution inpatient studies have reported that RSV is the most commonly detected respiratory virus, particularly in pediatric lung transplant recipients. Pediatric abdominal transplant recipients with RSV infections have been reported to have mortality rates of 40% [18] [19] [20] ; however, these studies have primarily described hospitalized patients. Larger studies in solid organ transplant recipients are needed to address this issue more completely.",

We did observe that viral load decreased after initiation of ribavirin treatment in one patient and increased after several rounds of chemotherapy in one patient. RSV in immunocompromised patients is associated with prolonged shedding, likely as a consequence of inability of the host immune response to clear the infection. 21 To our knowledge, there are no large-scale retrospective or prospective studies of antiviral therapy for RSV in immunocompromised pediatric populations. With several new RSV antivirals in development including two that have been evaluated in challenge studies in healthy young adults, the assessment of sequential viral loads with receipt of treatment should be assessed to correlate with clinical outcomes in this relatively high-risk patient population. We found high rates of RSV infection that could have potentially been acquired in the outpatient clinic setting. RSV is often implicated in inpatient and outpatient nosocomial outbreaks in transplant wards, as documented by genotypic analysis. 22, 23 Although these cases in our study could have been linked to clinic visits, these children were also living at home and therefore likely to have had more frequent contact with individuals interfacing with the community, such as siblings. In addition, many patients were seen very frequently, at least weekly, per their treatment protocols, which could also explain the high rate of potentially clinic-acquired RSV infection.",

However, at our institution, DFA has a sensitivity of 93% compared to RT-PCR in young children. 11 Additional limitations include an inability to discern true nosocomial clinic-acquired infections; sequencing of the samples would need to be performed to identify identical viral strains, and no residual samples were available for this analysis.",
