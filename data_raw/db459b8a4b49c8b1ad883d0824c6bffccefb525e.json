            "text": "Daily, individuals are subject to a demographic update and viral transmissions, as well as some data collation, up until the requested simulation time (not runtime). For the demographic update, an cumulative probability function of the mortality risk at the individuals age is compared with their life expectancy probability. If the cumulative probability exceeds the life expectancy probability, the individual is terminated. A new human always replaces a deceased human im-mediately, whereas a dead mosquito is replaced conditional on the expected mosquito population size on a given simulation day (rainfall seasonality). In the demographic update, individuals are also checked as to if they should become infectious or if humans should recover from the disease. The demographic update code fragment also contains counters in order to keep track of the total number of infected individuals per community.For viral transmissions, for host and vector, the expected number of transmission events from each sub-population are computed (\u03bbN ) and divided between into long-distance and local transmissions. Each long-distance transmission event is assigned community which is uniformly sampled from the lattice. Every local transmission is assigned a community which is sampled from the local disease dispersal kernel. After all transmission events from each sub-population have been passed through the inter-community interaction function, each community now has a new total number of transmissions pass to its individuals (\u039bN ). For every transmission event in a community, an individual is selected at random. If the individual is not already infected, and does not have immunity, the individual is infected. A newly infected mosquito is assigned an extrinsic incubation period, at the end of which the mosquito becomes infectious for the duration of its life. Similarly, a human is assigned an intrinsic incubation period and a recovery time, and is now set to be immune.Finally, at every time step, the counters keeping track of the total number of infected individuals per community are summed. This data is output at the very end of the program.GPU accelerationThe majority of the code is parallelized on the GPU. The parts that are not parallelized include requesting user input, checking whether the simulation needs to continue, and outputting data to file. The demographic update part of the code is fully parallelized. This means that every scheduled thread on the GPU is associated with an individual. Computing the expected number of viral transmissions per community per strain (before and after local and long-distance dispersal) is parallelized across communities. However, infection of individuals happens also at the community level. The summation of counters across all sub-populations is parallelized over all communities.OptimizationSince all individuals require updating at every time-step of the simulation, the demographic update is the main target for optimization. Defining an individual as an object and arranging many individuals into a vector results in strided memory access when accessing one piece of information about each individual, such as age or location. A noted optimization is to break down the vector of individuals into vectors of component parts. Memory access is now coalesced.",

As the individual based model discretizes time into days, the remaining survival period can be calculated by taking the sum over all possible (infectious) ages of the remaining survival function. Again, by taking the weighted average of all possible ages of an infectious vector, \u03c4 + 1/ V , with the mean life expectancy of a vector that became infectious at age \u03c4 + 1/ V days, we obtain an the mean life expectancy of an infectious vector.",
