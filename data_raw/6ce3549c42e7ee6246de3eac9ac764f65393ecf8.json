It was estimated that approximately 23 000 persons had been infected in Mexico by late April, giving an estimated case fatality rate of 0.4%. 1 More than one million people became ill with novel H1N1 influenza between April and June 2009 in the United States. 2 4 Severe H1N1 pneumonitis would result in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi-organ failure, and associated with prolonged use of mechanical ventilation or even extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). 5 The mortality associated with severe H1N1 infections was reported as high as 20%-40%. 6 In a study of 320 pandemic influenza pneumonia in Japan, 43 (13.4%) had received invasive mechanical ventilation and 7.8% died of severe pneumonia. 7 Pulmonary function impairment and reduced exercise capacity had been found in about half of the survivors of ARDS. One year after hospital discharge for ARDS, up to 80% of the patients demonstrated reduced diffusing capacity, one-fifth of them had airflow obstruction, and one-fifth had chest restriction. 8 Besides the impairment of pulmonary function, the survivors of ARDS also had reduced health-related quality of life.",

Patients with H1N1-ARDS were transferred to the ward when they were hemodynamically stable and were liberated from mechanical ventilation.

None of our patients had abnormal FEV 1 at 6 months, and 22.2% had mildly reduced FVC, 44.4% had slightly lower TLC, and 44.4% had mildly impaired diffusing capacity. The inconsistent results in the recovery of pulmonary functions after discharge between H1N1 and non-H1N1 ARDS probably resulted from the heterogeneous patient characteristics and different severities in lung inflammation and damage. 89%, respectively. 20 Unlike the results of previous reports with certain percentages of H1N1-ARDS patients having impaired exercise capacity at 6 months or 1 year after discharge, all of our patients had their 6MWD returned to normal (>80% of predicted value) at 6 months post-discharge. The recovery of exercise in our patient might partly benefit from the pulmonary rehabilitation program. Reduced pulmonary function was significantly correlated with impaired quality of life and exercise capacity. The pulmonary function abnormalities correlated with decreased health-related quality of life for domains reflecting physical function in survivors of ARDS. 8 Schelling and colleagues demonstrated that patients with more abnormality on pulmonary function tests had the lowest health-related quality of life. 25 In patients with H1N1-ARDS, Quispe-Laimea et al found there was no correlation between lung diffusion and quality of life at 6 months. 22 In our patients, the quality of life measured by SGRQ improved but not reached to statistical significance in the first 3 months despite significant improvement in pulmonary function tests and 6MWD. The total score of SGRQ decreased significantly from 3 to 6 months, although the measurements of pulmonary functions and 6MWD had no significant increase during this period. Our findings indicated that there would be a further improvement of quality of life even after the improvement of pulmonary functions or exercise capacity reached to plateau levels. All of our patients received 2 months' pulmonary rehabilitation program with exercise training, simplified strength training, and breathing exercise. Prior study showed ARDS patients have both initial and persistent debilitating limitations in physical function. The declines in physical function may even persist at 8 years. 26 Several studies had reported pulmonary rehabilitation can help to improve exercise capacity, sleep quality, depression, and health-related quality of life. With the limited number of patients included in this study,we did not compare the outcomes between H1N1-ARDS patients with and without pulmonary rehabilitation. All of the patients in our study received similar pulmonary rehabilitation program because we thought that pulmonary rehabilitation could be beneficial to the recovery of physical status in these severely ill patients. Therefore, this could partly explain why our patients had more significant improvement after survived form H1N1-ARDS. However, further studies are needed to identify the optimal therapeutic interventions in a timely and targeted manner.There are several limitations in this study. First, the case number was small because of not all of the patients survived from ARDS due to influenza A H1N1 pneumonitis had regular follow-up of their pulmonary function tests and exercise tests. Second, a noninfluenza control group was lacking and the difference in the recovery from ARDS resulted from severe H1N1 infection or other causes is not clarified. Third, we did not compare the outcomes between F I G U R E 2 Median values of FEV 1 , FVC, TLC, DL CO , 6MWD, and total score of SGRQ at 1, 3, and 6 mo after discharge from the hospital still remained unclear. Besides, we did not assess other variables, such as heart and neuromotor function, which might affect their pulmonary functions or health-related quality of life.",
