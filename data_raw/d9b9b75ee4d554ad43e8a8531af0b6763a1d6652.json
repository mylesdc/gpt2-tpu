Identifying mechanisms responsible for such T cell dysfunction is therefore of great importance to understand how to prevent persistent viral infection. Here we show using lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection that carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1) is fundamental for recruiting lymphocyte-specific protein kinase (Lck) into the T cell receptor complex to form an efficient immunological synapse. CEACAM1 is essential for activation of CD8 + T cells, and the absence of CEACAM1 on virus-specific CD8 + T cells limits the antiviral CD8 + T cell response. Treatment with anti-CEACAM1 antibody stabilizes Lck in the immunological synapse, prevents CD8 + T cell exhaustion, and improves control of virus infection in vivo. Treatment of human virus-specific CD8 + T cells with anti-CEACAM1 antibody similarly enhances their proliferation. We conclude that CEACAM1 is an important regulator of virus-specific CD8 + T cell functions in mice and humans and represents a promising therapeutic target for modulating CD8 + T cells.",

Globally, approximately 240 million people are chronically infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) 1 , more than 170 million are infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) 2, 3 , and 75 million are infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 4 . These viruses can lead to persistent infection and dysfunction of adaptive immunity 2, 5 . Although HCV infection can be cured with antiviral therapy, treatment for HIV and HBV does not result in complete clearance of the virus. Therefore, patients must take antiviral drugs every day to prevent severe clinical problems such as AIDS or end-stage liver failure 5,6 . Thus, identifying new strategies that result in complete control of virus is one main goal of basic research.",

            "text": "One important reason for immune dysfunction is the abrogation of the function of virus-specific CD8 + T cells. Typically, in T cell dysfunction CD8 + T cells lose their ability to proliferate and to produce cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF) and interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3). Effector and memory functions are also substantially lost. Next, CD8 + T cells undergo apoptosis and are eliminated by phagocytic cells in a hierarchical manner, called T cell exhaustion 7, 8 . Stimulation through the T cell receptor (TCR) triggers phosphorylation signals that not only activate multiple effector pathways but also ensure that T cells respond to an appropriate signal. CD28 family members are mostly costimulatory and provide an activation signal via TCR 9 . Besides positive activation, negative regulators such as programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) and T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain containing 3 (TIM3) signal via TCR and by various cell surface receptors 9,10 . PD-1 is an important inhibitory receptor that induces the exhaustion of CD8 + T cells. Engagement of PD-1 by its ligands PD-L1 or PD-L2 produces signals that inhibit T cell proliferation and function 11, 12 . Blockade of PD-1 restores the function of exhausted CD8 + T cells and can therefore be used to treat diseases that profit from restored CD8 + T cell function [13] [14] [15] . Because of the clinical success of PD-1 blockade in humans, current research focuses on the discovery of other checkpoint regulators of CD8 + T cells.",

Besides its direct involvement in phosphorylation and calcium signaling, CEACAM1 interacts with filamin A and therefore modulates the topology of the signaling complex 33 . In CD8 + T cells, filamin A interacts with CD28 and lymphocyte-specific protein kinase (Lck) and is therefore an important molecule that modulates membrane rearrangement and CD8 + T cell signaling 34 .

A similar trend was observed upon infection with 2 \u00d7 10 4 PFU of LCMV-Docile. A higher antigen load led to a gradual decrease in the total number of CD8 + T cells and in the percentage of virus-specific Tet-GP33 + CD8 + T cells in WT mice infected with 2 \u00d7 10 4 PFU of LCMV-Docile compared to the mice infected with 200 PFU of LCMV-Docile ( Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 1b) .",

We adoptively transferred carboxy-fluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE)-labeled P14 \u00d7 WT or P14 \u00d7 Ceacam1 -/splenocytes into WT host animals (CD45.1) and then infected them with LCMV-Docile. Activation of transferred virus-specific P14 CD8 + T cells induced proliferation that was comparable between P14 \u00d7 WT or P14 \u00d7 Ceacam1 -/-CD8 + T cells (Fig. 3a) . Therefore, we conclude that the induction of proliferation is independent of CEACAM1 expression. However, lack of CEA-CAM1 limited the survival of CD8 + T cells after activation, as demonstrated by the finding that the number of transferred P14 \u00d7 Ceacam1 -/-CD8 + T cells were significantly lower than those of the P14 \u00d7 WT CD8 + T cells (Fig. 3b) . To further determine whether CEACAM1 acts directly on the expansion of CD8 + T cells after activation, we transferred equal (1 \u00d7 10 4 ) number of P14 \u00d7 WT or P14 \u00d7 Ceacam1 -/splenocytes into WT host animals (CD45.1) and then infected them with 2 \u00d7 10 4 PFU of LCMV-Docile (Fig. 3c) . We found that P14 \u00d7 Ceacam1 -/-CD8 + T cells exhibited less expansion than did control P14 \u00d7 WT CD8 + T cells (Fig. 3d ). This finding may be due to the poor survival of CEACAM1-deficient CD8 + T cells after activation. Similarly, CEACAM1-deficient P14 CD8 + T cells exhibited limited IFN-\u03b3 production after in vitro restimulation with GP33 peptide (Fig. 3e) , and this reduction in CD8 + T cell expansion and IFN-\u03b3 production was associated with enhanced viral titers in spleen, lung, liver, and serum at day 8 after infection (Fig. 3f) .",

Isotype control antibody staining of T cells from WT mice is shown as a gray area (n = 4-6 per group). b Absolute number of Tet-GP33 + and NP396 + CD8 + T cells in blood from WT or Ceacam1 -/mice after intravenous infection with 200 PFU of LCMV-Docile at indicated time points (n = 4-6 per group). c Absolute number of CD8 + T cells and percentages of Tet-GP33 + CD8 + T cells in spleen, lymph node, liver, lung, kidney, and blood (n = 6-8 per group) from WT or Ceacam1 -/mice on day 8 after infection with 200 or 2 \u00d7 10 4 PFU of LCMV-Docile. d, e Intracellular cytokine interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) secretion in Tet-GP33 + CD8 + T cells (d) and median fluorescence intensity (MFI) levels in IFN-\u03b3 + Tet-GP33 + CD8 + T cells (e) from splenocytes of WT and Ceacam1 -/mice on day 8 after infection with 200 or 2 \u00d7 10 4 PFU of LCMV-Docile. Horizontal dotted lines designate the detection limit without restimulation (n = 6-8 per group). f Ratio of the percentage of IFN-\u03b3 + cells to the percentage of Tet-GP33 + CD8 + T cells from WT and Ceacam1 -/mice on day 8 after infection with 200 (n = 12) or 2 \u00d7 10 4 (n = 7) PFU of LCMV-Docile. g Viral titers from WT and Ceacam1 -/mice in indicated organs and serum 8 days after intravenous infection with 200 or 2 \u00d7 10 4 PFU of LVMC-Docile (n = 6-8 per group). *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001; and ****P < 0.0001 (Student's t test). ns = not significant. Data are representative of two (a, c, d, e, f, g) or three (b) experiments (mean \u00b1 SEM; b, c, d, e, f, g) na\u00efve mice (Fig. 3g) . Additionally, 8 days after infection with 200 ( Fig. 3h ) or 2 \u00d7 10 4 PFU ( Fig. 3i ) of LCMV-Docile, the virusspecific Tet-GP33 + CD8 + T cells in blood, spleen, and lymph nodes of the second group of mice were derived mainly from CD45.1 WT mice. We conclude that signals intrinsic to CEACAM1 T cells are essential for the activation, survival, or both of virus-specific CD8 + T cells. Taken together, these findings indicate that cell-intrinsic expression of CEACAM1 is essential for the survival and efficient expansion of CD8 + T cells after viral infection.",

It has been reported that CD28 interacts with filamin A and the Src family kinase Lck at the immunological synapse 34, 39 . Recruitment of CD28 to the immunological synapse during TCR activation promotes membrane rearrangements that lead to cytoskeletal changes for organized signaling [39] [40] [41] . Thus, either the absence of CD28 activation or a deficiency in Lck results in limited phosphorylation of Zap-70 and PLC\u03b3-1 [42] [43] [44] .

Only GP33-specific P14 \u00d7 WT CD8 + T cells formed an immunological synapse with DCs ( Fig. 4a) , whereas P14 \u00d7 Ceacam1 -/-CD8 + T cells interacted with DCs but failed to recruit Lck and filamin A into the TCR signaling complex (Fig. 4a ). To determine whether reduced Lck recruitment was associated with reduced TCR signaling, we purified splenic T cells from WT and Ceacam1 -/mice and activated them with anti-CD3 in combination with anti-CD28 antibodies. Ceacam1 -/-T cells exhibited limited phosphorylation of Zap-70, PLC\u03b3-1, and Erk44/42 (Fig. 4b) , a finding suggesting that CEACAM1 indeed acts directly on Lck upstream of Zap-70 in the TCR activation pathway. This reduced phosphorylation of Zap-70, PLC\u03b3-1, and Erk44/42 in the absence of CEACAM1 still allows initial proliferation of CD8 + T cells but results in reduced survival of proliferated CD8 + T cells after antigen activation (Fig. 3a, b, d) .",

To test this idea, we cultured purified P14 \u00d7 WT CD8 + T cells in the presence of activating and exhausting doses of GP33 peptide.

We found that treatment with anti-CEACAM1 mAb enhances virus-specific CD8 + T cell responses not only numerically ( Fig. 5g) but also functionally by their ability to produce IFN-\u03b3 (Fig. 5h ). Viral titers were significantly reduced in several organs by treatment with anti-CEACAM1 mAb 8 days after infection (Fig. 5i) . Together, these findings suggest that treatment with anti-CEACAM1 antibody enhances the function of CD8 + T cells not only quantitatively but also qualitatively and thereby restores the function of exhausted CD8 + T cells in chronic viral infection.",

Next, we determined whether anti-CEACAM1 mAb could be used to enhance the function of virus-specific CD8 + T cells in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). We tested the binding of human CEACAM1 mAb (clone 18/20, made inhouse) on CD8 + T cells from healthy donors. Anti-human CEACAM1 (anti-hCEACAM1) antibody exhibited binding to CD8 + T cells (Fig. 6a) . To determine whether this antibody could enhance CD8 + T cell function, we cultured PBMCs from healthy donors with anti-CD28 antibody in the presence of influenza (Flu) peptide (GILGFVFTL) with or without anti-hCEACAM1 mAb. We found that anti-hCEACAM1 mAb enhanced the production of IFN-\u03b3 by CD8 + T cells after restimulation with the Flu peptide (Fig. 6b) . Similarly, PBMCs from healthy donors exhibited higher IFN-\u03b3 production when cultured with cytomegalovirus (CMV) peptide (NLVPMVATV) in the presence of anti-hCEACAM1 mAb (Fig. 6c) . To determine whether anti-hCEACAM1 mAb can also improve the function of CD8 + T cells in vivo, we used a mouse model expressing human CEACAM1 as a transgene. Newly generated na\u00efve hCeacam1 +/+ \u00d7 msCeacam1 -/mice exhibited a splenic structure resembling that of na\u00efve WT mice (Fig. 2) and expressed substantial levels of CEACAM1 on peripheral blood T cells (Fig. 6d) . We treated hCeacam1 +/+ \u00d7 msCeacam1 -/mice with anti-hCEACAM1 antibody and then infected them with LCMV-Docile (Fig. 6e) . Treatment with anti-hCEACAM1 mAb enhanced virus-specific CD8 + T cell numbers (Fig. 6f) . The number of GP33 tetramer-specific CD8 + T cells was significantly higher in anti-hCEACAM1 mAb-treated mice than isotype control mAb-treated mice. Moreover, the number of NP396 tetramer-specific CD8 + cells was slightly higher in mice treated with anti-hCEACAM1 mAb than in mice treated with isotype control mAb (Fig. 6f) . Therefore, we conclude that treatment with anti-hCEACAM1 mAb improves virus-specific CD8 + T cell numbers and function both in vitro and in vivo.",

Certainly, reduced number of B cells and CD169 + marginal zone macrophages contribute to deficient control of LCMV. We then focused on the cell-intrinsic role of CEACAM1 in CD8 + T cells. The absence of CEACAM1 in CD8 + T cells resulted in insufficient CD8 + T cell functions. By conducting adaptive cell transfer experiments, we found that CD8 + T cell-intrinsic CEACAM1 deficiency resulted in reduced viral control in the spleen, lymph node, lung, liver, and serum. Therefore, the absence of CEACAM1 within CD8 + T cells contribute to lack of viral control in Ceacam1 -/mice. Mechanistically, we found that CEACAM1 deficiency within CD8 + T cells was associated with limited TCR activation. CEACAM1 was involved in the recruitment of Lck into the immunological synapse and thereby promoted the phosphorylation of Zap-70, PLC\u03b3-1, and Erk44/42. Additionally, the absence of CEACAM did not influence the proliferation of CD8 + T cells, but did affect the survival of proliferating CD8 + T cells after activation. In line with this finding, the generation of mature CD4 + and CD8 + T thymocytes was slightly reduced in the absence of CEACAM1. However, the difference is less pronounced than in the generation of virus-specific CD8 + T cells in the absence of CEACAM1. CEACAM1 has very diverse functions in the immune system. CEACAM1 has been described primarily as a regulator of T cells in the gut 26, 27, 29, [49] [50] [51] . The expression of CEACAM1-L inhibits T cell proliferation and thereby prevents inflammatory bowel disease, whereas the expression of CEACAM1-S is essential for the development of Tfh-driven IgA production by gut B cells 27 . Recently, we found that the expression of CEACAM1-L on B cells enhances Syk phosphorylation after B cell receptor activation and therefore is essential for B cell development, survival, and proliferation 17, 18 . In line with these data, expression of CEACAM1 maintains the splenic architecture including the development of B cell follicles, and CD169 + metallophilic macrophages 18 . Both B cells and marginal zone macrophages play an important role during LCMV infection 37, 52 . CD169 + macrophages, specifically, play an integral function in preventing early viral propagation immediately after infection 37, 53 . Therefore, it is likely that in addition to reduced CD8 + T cell function, the reduced number of marginal zone macrophages contribute to defective LCMV control in Ceacam1 -/mice.",

Also, virus-specific human CD8 + T cells can be strongly activated by treatment with a species-specific CEACAM1 antibody. Obviously, it remains unknown whether treatment with anti-CEACAM1 antibody for various types of viral infections, autoimmune diseases, and cancer could similarly benefit T cell function.

One day later, mice were infected with 2 \u00d7 10 4 PFU of LCMV-Docile. The percentage or an actual number of proliferated P14 CD8 + T cells was assessed in various compartments by flow cytometry 8 days after infection. The purity of sorted cells was maintained at higher than 95% for the transfer. For cell proliferation assays, cells were labeled with 5 \u00b5M CFSE, and 1 \u00d7 10 7 splenocytes per mouse were transferred into recipient mice. The proliferation was assessed by flow cytometry, and data were analyzed with FlowJo software.Bone marrow chimeras. For the generation of bone marrow chimeras, C57BL/6 (WT) mice were irradiated with a total of 1050 rad. After 24 h, the immune system of the mice was reconstituted intravenously with 5 \u00d7 10 6 bone marrow cells from each donor for mixed bone marrow chimeras. Mice were analyzed 45 days after reconstitution.Immunoblotting. Spleens were dissociated, and T cells were purified with Pan T Cell Isolation Kit (magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS), Miltenyi Biotech) according to standard techniques and with MACS columns. Next, 2 \u00d7 10 6 cells were challenged with or without anti-CD3e (500A2, 4 \u00b5g ml \u22121 ) in combination with anti-CD28 (37.51, 2 \u00b5g ml \u22121 ) antibodies (both from BD Biosciences) for various time periods. Cells were lysed in boiling sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) buffer (1.1% SDS, 11% glycerol, 0.1 M Tris; pH 6.8) with 10% 2-mercaptoethanol (all from Sigma). Total cell extracts were examined with 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels and transferred onto Whatman nitrocellulose membranes (GE Healthcare) according to standard techniques. Membranes were blocked for 1 h in 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA; PAA Laboratories) in PBS supplemented with 1% Tween-20 and were incubated with the following antibodies: anti-phospho-Zap-70 (Syk) (Y352/Y319); anti-phospho-PLC\u03b3-1; anti-phospho-p44/42 (p-Erk1/2); anti-Syk; anti-PLC\u03b3-1; and anti-p44/42 (Erk1/2) (all from Cell Signalling Technology). The secondary antibody anti-GAPDH (Meridian Life Science) was detected by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody (Bio-Rad Laboratories), anti-rabbit IgG antibody (GE Healthcare), or both. Signals were detected with the Bio-Rad ChemiDoc imaging system (Bio-Rad Laboratories) and analyzed with the manufacturer's software. Images have been cropped for purposes of presentation.Antibody injections.
