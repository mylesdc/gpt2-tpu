            "text": "Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) causes severe human infections and dromedary camels are considered an intermediary host. The dynamics of natural infection in camels are not well understood. Through systematic surveillance in Egypt, nasal, rectal, milk, urine and serum samples were collected from camels between June 2014 and February 2016. Locations included quarantines, markets, abattoirs, free-roaming herds and farmed breeding herds. The overall seroprevalence was 71% and RNA detection rate was 15%. Imported camels had higher seroprevalence (90% vs 61%) and higher RT-PCR detection rates (21% vs 12%) than locally raised camels. Juveniles had lower seroprevalence than adults (37% vs 82%) but similar RT-PCR detection rates (16% vs 15%). An outbreak in a breeding herd, showed that antibodies rapidly wane, that camels become re-infected, and that outbreaks in a herd are sustained for an extended time. Maternal antibodies titers were very low in calves regardless of the antibody titers of the mothers. Our results support the hypothesis that camels are a reservoir for MERS-CoV and that camel trade is an important route of introducing the virus into importing countries. Findings related to waning antibodies and re-infection have implications for camel vaccine development, disease management and zoonotic threat.",

            "text": "The Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is caused by a betacoronavirus (\u03b2CoV) and was first reported infecting a human being in 2012. 1 As of 22 July 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) was notified of 1782 cases of whom 634 died. 2 The majority of these cases originate in the Arabian Peninsula especially Saudi Arabia. Travel-related cases have occurred in more than 20 countries and recently a major outbreak was recorded in South Korea. 3 Current evidence suggests that MERS-CoV is a zoonotic virus. MERS-CoV is genetically related to bat \u03b2CoV. 1,4-6 Bats were also found susceptible to infection by MERS-CoV. 7 More compelling evidence of zoonotic transmission suggests that dromedary camels are a reservoir for MERS-CoV. Several studies detected MERS-CoV in camels in several countries. [8] [9] [10] [11] Camel to human transmission of MERS-CoV was also documented. 12, 13 Camel and human MERS-CoV had similar replication, tropism and ability to evade interferon responses, in ex vivo cultures of the human respiratory tract. Yet, it is important to note that the vast majority of the human cases occur after human-to-human transmission especially in health care settings. 3 The role of camels as a MERS-CoV reservoir was initially supported by the prevalence of MERS antibodies in camels from Oman, Egypt and Saudi Arabia. [14] [15] [16] It was later shown that dromedary camels from African countries (Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria, Sudan and Tunisia) and Arabian Peninsula (Jordan, Oman, Qatar and United Arab Emirates (UAE)) had high seropositive rates of MERS-CoV antibodies. 17 Archived camel sera (1983) (1984) (1985) (1986) (1987) (1988) (1989) (1990) (1991) (1992) (1993) (1994) (1995) (1996) (1997) showed the presence of neutralizing antibodies suggesting long-term MERS-CoV circulation among camels. 18 However, most of the evidence relating camels to MERS-CoV comes from cross-sectional studies that do not provide information on the dynamics of MERS-CoV infection in camels. Furthermore, the majority of traded camels originate from African countries and those have not been well studied. Hence, we designed a systematic active surveillance system to study MERS-CoV in camels, both imported from Sudan and local, in Egypt. The aim here was to determine whether the prevalence of MERS-CoV differed by settings at which camels are raised. Between June 2014 and February 2016, 2825 nasal swabs, 114 rectal  swabs, 187 milk samples, 26 urine samples and 2541 sera were collected from dromedary camels. Sampling locations are shown in Figure 1 and included a government-operated quarantine at the border with Sudan, two camel markets and camel abattoirs where imported camels mainly from Sudan, Somalia and Ethiopia are found. Local free-roaming herds, and local farmed breeding herds including a herd of about 90 camels that were raised and bred in confinement on the Mediterranean coast were also sampled repeatedly every month. Camels were classified as juvenile when under two years of age around when they are weaned off mother's milk.",

Here we conducted systematic active surveillance in Egyptian camels aimed at determining the incidence and seroprevalence of MERS-CoV. Our overall seroprevalence data are in line with previous findings from Egypt and elsewhere. 17 MERS-CoV detection rates by RT-PCR is also comparable to studies in Saudi Arabia and the UAE. 10, 11 Egypt imports around 1.2 million heads of camels annually, of which 68% are from Sudan and the rest from East African countries, primarily Ethiopia. 25 When comparing local with imported camels, our data showed that imported camels had higher seroprevalence and higher RT-PCR detection rates. Seroprevalence in imported camels was comparable to a previous study of imported camels in Egypt as well as camels tested in other countries. 26 Conducting surveillance at quarantines and adjacent markets in Southern Egypt meant that we were sampling the animals as soon as they arrived from Sudan in Egypt, hence antibody titers and infections occurred prior to the camels arriving in Egypt. This suggests that MERS-CoV is being introduced through camel trade. Our surveillance included four sampling trips to those locations and the majority of the sampled camels were seropositive. RT-PCR detection rate ranged between 0% and 2.7% for three trips, however, 86% of the camels sampled on the fourth trip were positive.",

This conclusion was demonstrated by a previous study from the UAE. 27 Recent data demonstrated that MERS-CoV neutralizing antibody was detected in camel milk. 15 Our data also showed that antibody titers in milk are uncommon and are at low titers when detected.

Females had consistently higher seroprevalence even when data were further analyzed by age strata. This translated into lower detection of MERS-CoV in females as compared with males. Our data does not allow us to provide a biological explanation for this observation, however, it could be potentially explained by the close link of cows and calves. As calves are more susceptible to infection, the cows become exposed to virus repeatedly, increasing their antibody titer.",

This is distinct from clade B viruses that are Monitoring the outbreak of MERS-CoV in the local farm herd enabled us to learn two novel findings: (i) that outbreaks in camel herds last a long time, and (ii) that antibody titers rapidly drop within a period often as short as two weeks. Furthermore, we were able to demonstrate that re-infection of camels does happen based on increases in antibody titers. This suggests that the virus may be continuously circulating in the large herds in exporting countries. These data have implications on vaccinating camels against MERS-CoV. Any vaccination program should account for the facts that antibodies tend to wane and that camels with high antibody titers can be infected. 9, 10 This is in addition to the fact that the infection appears to be more common in exporting countries from which data on camel populations are sparse. Another study demonstrated that MERS neutralizing antibodies in dairy camels in a high biosecurity level farm remained consistent for up to one year. 27 This is in contrast to our serological data that showed variation of antibodies over time. This may be explained but differences in biosecurity and/or differences in the immunity of the camels given different feeding and rearing practices.",
