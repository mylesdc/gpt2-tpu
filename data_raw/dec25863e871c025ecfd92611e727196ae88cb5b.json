Yet no criteria exist to determine when the pathogen increases to a risky level, from which it has a large chance of dying out, to when a major outbreak is almost certain. We introduce such an outbreak threshold (T 0 ), and find that for large and homogeneous host populations, in which the pathogen has a reproductive ratio R 0 , on the order of 1/ Log(R 0 ) infected individuals are needed to prevent stochastic fade-out during the early stages of an epidemic. We also show how this threshold scales with higher heterogeneity and R 0 in the host population. These results have implications for controlling emerging and re-emerging pathogens.",

Despite this importance, it has seldom been addressed how many infected individuals are needed to declare that an outbreak is occurring: that is, when the pathogen can go extinct due to stochastic effects, to when it infects a high enough number of hosts such that the outbreak size increases in a deterministic manner ( Figure 1A) . Generally, the presence of a single infected individual is not sufficient to be classified as an outbreak, so how many infected individuals need to be present to cause this deterministic increase? Understanding at what point this change arises is key in preventing and controlling nascent outbreaks as they are detected, as well as determining the best course of action for prevention or treatment.",

Existing studies usually consider random drift affecting outbreaks in the context of estimating how large a host population needs to be to sustain an epidemic (the ''Critical Community Size'' [4, 7, 8] ), calculating the outbreak probability in general [9] [10] [11] [12] , or ascertaining whether a sustained increase in cases over an area has occurred [13] . Here we discuss the fundamental question of how many infected individuals are needed to almost guarantee that a pathogen will cause an outbreak, as opposed to the population size needed to maintain an epidemic once it has appeared (Critical Community Size; see also Box 1).

By solving this equation in the limit of extinction probability going to zero, we find that on the order of 1/Log(R 0 ) infected hosts are needed for an outbreak to be likely (black thick curve in Figure 1B ), a result that reflects similar theory from population genetics [14] [15] [16] .

For example, for the pathogen extinction probability to be less than 1%, there needs to be at least 5/ Log(R 0 ) infected individuals. More generally, the pathogen extinction probability is lower than a given threshold c if there are at least 2Log(c)/Log(R 0 ) infected individuals. Furthermore, if only a proportion p,1 of all infected individuals are detected, then the outbreak threshold order is p/ Log(R 0 ). Also, if there exists a time-lag t between an infection occurring and its report, then the order of T 0 is e 2t(b-d) / Log(R 0 ), where b is the infection transmission rate and 1/d the mean duration of the infectious period (Material S.1 in Text S1).

In reality, there will be a large variance among individual transmission rates, especially if ''super-spreaders'' are present [17] . This population heterogeneity can either be deterministic, due to differences in immune history among hosts or differences in host behavior, or stochastic, due to sudden environmental or social changes. Spatial structure can also act as a form of heterogeneity, if each region or infected individual is subject to different transmission rates, or degree of contact with other individuals [18] . In such heterogeneous host populations, the number of secondary cases an infected individual engenders is jointly captured by R 0 and a dispersion parameter k (see Box 2). This dispersion parameter controls the degree of variation in individual transmission rates, while fixing the average R 0 . The consequence of this model is that the majority of infected hosts tend to cause few secondary infections, while the minority behave as super-spreaders, causing many secondary infections. Host population heterogeneity (obtained with lower values of k) increases the probability that an outbreak will go extinct, as the pathogen can only really spread via one of the dwindling super-spreading individuals. In this heterogeneous case, we can find accurate values of T 0 numerically. As shown in Figure 1B , if R 0 is close to 1, host heterogeneity (k) does not really matter (T 0 tends to be high). However, if the pathogen has a high R 0 and thus spreads well, then host heterogeneity strongly affects T 0 . Additionally, we find that the heterogeneous threshold simply scales as a function of k and R 0 2 (see Box 2). As an example, if k = 0.16, as estimated for SARS infections [11] , the number of infected individuals needed to guarantee an outbreak increases 4-fold compared to a homogeneous population (Material S.3 in Text S1).",

Yet the key message generally holds that while the number of infections lies below the threshold, there is a strong chance that the pathogen will vanish without causing a major outbreak. From a biological viewpoint, unless R 0 is close to one, these thresholds tend to be small (on the order of 5 to 20 individuals). This contrasts with estimates of the Critical Community Size, which tend to lie in the hundreds of thousands of susceptible individuals [3, 7, 8] . Therefore, while only a small infected population is needed to trigger a full-scale epidemic, a much larger pool of individuals are required to maintain an epidemic, once it appears, and prevent it from fading out. This makes sense, since there tends to be more susceptible hosts early on in the outbreak than late on.",

In theory, it should have been ''easier'' to contain the SARS outbreak, as its threshold is three times greater than that for smallpox due to higher host heterogeneity (k).

This reflects that in heterogeneous outbreaks, although the emergence probability is lower, the disease spread is faster (compared to homogeneous infections) once it does appear [11] . Quick containment of the outbreak was difficult to achieve since SARS was not immediately recognised, as well as the fact that the incubation period is around 5 days, by which point it had easily caused more secondary cases. However, in subsequent outbreaks super-spreaders might not be infected early on, allowing more time to contain the spread.",

It is classically used to measure the rate of pathogen spread. In infinite-population models, a pathogen can emerge if R 0 .1. In a finite population, the pathogen can emerge from a single infection with probability 1-1/R 0 if R 0 .1, otherwise extinction is certain.",
