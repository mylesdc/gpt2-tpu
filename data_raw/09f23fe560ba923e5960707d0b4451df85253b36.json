Thus intranasal (IN) delivery of a potent vaccine-adjuvant formulation is promising. In this study, PRRS-MLV (VR2332) was coadministered \u00b1 an adjuvant Mycobacterium vaccae whole cell lysate or CpG ODN through intramuscular (IM) or IN route as a mist, and challenged with a heterologous PRRSV 1-4-4 IN at 42 days post-vaccination (dpv). At 14 and 26 dpv, vaccine viral RNA copies were one log greater in the plasma of PRRS-MLV IM compared to IN vaccinated pigs, and the infectious replicating vaccine virus was detected only in the IM group. In PRRS-MLV \u00b1 adjuvant IM vaccinated pigs, reduced viral RNA load and absence of the replicating challenged virus was observed at 7, 10 and 14 days post-challenge (dpc). At 14 dpc, in BAL fluid \u22655 log viral RNA copies were detected in all the pig groups, but the replicating challenged virus was undetectable only in IM groups. Immunologically, virus neutralizing antibody titers in the plasma of IM (but not IN) vaccine groups was \u22658 against the vaccine and challenged viruses. At 26 dpv, PRRS-MLV IM (without adjuvant) received pigs had significantly increased population of CD4 and CD8 T cells in PBMC. At 14 dpc, relatively increased population of IFN-\u03b3 + total lymphocytes, NK, CD4, CD8 and \u03b3\u03b4 T cells were observed in the MLV-IM group. In conclusion, PRRS-MLV IM vaccination induced the virus specific T cell response in pigs, but still it is required to improve its cross-protective efficacy. \u00a9 2016 Ouyang et al.

PRRS is an endemic disease in the swine industry worldwide [1] , and causes approximately $664 million losses annually in the USA [2] . PRRS virus (PRRSV) is the causative agent, isolated simultaneously in Europe and North America in the 1990s [3, 4] . PRRSV belongs to the Arteriviridae family [5] and displays a high genetic diversity [6] . To control PRRS, a modified live-attenuated PRRS vaccine (PRRS-MLV) has been widely used since the 1990s. PRRS-MLV protects pigs from clinical disease with reduced lung lesions [7] and viral shedding [8] , and elicits a protective response against homologous virus. But apart from concerns about safety of PRRS-MLV in vaccinated pigs [9, 10] , the breadth of cross-protection induced by MLV is highly questionable [11, 12] .",

Vaccine inoculated to a mucosal site along with a potent adjuvant upregulates the expression of costimulatory molecules on immune cells, which secrete chemokines and cytokines [13] . Mucosal vaccine coadministered through potent adjuvant/s induces superior cross-protective immunity by enhancing the array of antigen specific T and B cell responses; mediated by dramatic increase in spreading of antigenic epitopes and recognition of multiple conserved epitopes, which otherwise are not recognized [14] [15] [16] [17] .

Animals were maintained with food and water ad libitum in our large animal BSL2 facility under the supervision of a veterinarian. The adjuvant (M. vaccae WCL 5 mg/pig or CPG-ODN 250 \u03bcg/pig) and PRRS-MLV (the same vaccine dose as per the manufacturer's recommendation was inoculated either by IM or IN route) were not mixed for inoculation in pigs; and they were inoculated separately on either side of the neck through IM or IN to both nostrils as mist. The pig group vaccinated intranasally with PRRS-MLV without adjuvant was not included in this study, but such a group was included in our previous study [16] . Each pig received 2 mL vaccine formulation once, with 1 mL of vaccine/adjuvant to each side of the neck or each nostril. Pigs were challenged using a heterologous PRRSV strain 1-4-4 (5 \u00d7 10 5 TCID 50 per pig) on 42 days post-vaccination (dpv) IN as mist and euthanized on 14 days postchallenge (dpc) ( Figure 1B ). Rectal temperature and body weight of pigs were recorded during the experiment on the days of blood collection. Collection of samples, maintenance and euthanization of pigs were performed as per the approved animal use and care committee protocol of The Ohio state University.",

The RFLP code of the challenged field virus used in this study was 1-4-4, and it was widely prevalent in North America and has approximately 15% difference in amino acid sequence compared to VR2332 GP5 sequence [40] . Thus, we analyzed the efficacy of PRRS-MLV \u00b1 M. vaccae WCL or CPG ODN administered IM or IN against the genetically heterologous viral strain 1-4-4 in pigs. We previously demonstrated that pigs immunized with PRRS-MLV with M. tb WCL IN elicit cross-protective response against a heterologous PRRSV strain MN184, which also has 15% nucleotide difference in GP5 sequence compared to VR2332 [16] . In this study, our results indicated that PRRS-MLV IM with and without adjuvant received pigs had 1-2 log reduced challenged viral RNA compared to IN route vaccinated animals. Further, in all the IM vaccinated pigs the replicating challenged virus was absent at 7, 10 and 14 dpc in plasma and also in BAL fluid at 14 dpc. Immunologically, these results were supported with NA titers of >1:8 against the strain 1-4-4 in IM vaccinated pigs. This data was consistent with an earlier study wherein PRRSV NA titer of 1:8 or higher protects piglets against development of viremia [41, 42] . In this study, IM vaccinated pigs with a single dose of PRRS-MLV had partial protection to a heterologous challenge virus. Similar degree of partial protection was observed in a heterologous challenge study using a highly pathogenic PRRSV strain JX143 derived PRRS-MLV vaccinated pigs [43] .",

            "text": "The protective response against PRRSV in PRRS-MLV vaccinated pigs was found to be dependent more on the levels of cell-mediated than humoral immunity [44] . In pigs vaccinated intranasally using PRRS-MLV and a potent adjuvant, M. tb WCL substantially increased IFN-\u03b3 response associated with a greater than two-fold increase in the population of CD4 CD8 double positive T cells (T-helper/memory) in virus-challenged pigs [16] . In pigs vaccinated with an inactivated PRRSV delivered through a biodegradable nanoparticle, the frequency of IFN-\u03b3 + CD4, CD8 and \u03b3\u03b4 T cell subsets were significantly enhanced and they were correlated well with the clearance of a heterologous challenged virus from the blood and lungs [33, 38] . This suggested a strong association of PRRSV clearance to IFN-\u03b3 + T cell response, and therefore in this study we determined the population of various IFN-\u03b3 positive T cell subsets. In pigs, the CD4 CD8 double positive T cell was shown to possess memory and T helper phenotype, and upregulation of this activated T cell subset correlated strongly with the protective immune response against classical swine fever, Aujeszky's disease and PRRSV [38, [45] [46] [47] . In PRRS-MLV (without adjuvant) IM received pigs, a significantly increased population of activated (IFN-\u03b3 + ) CD4 CD8 double positive T cell was observed. In addition, in pigs CD3\u03b5 + CD4\u03b1 \u2212 CD8\u03b1 + bearing T cell is either a CTL or a \u03b3\u03b4 T cell, while the cell having the CD3\u03b5 + CD4\u03b1 \u2212 CD8\u03b1\u03b2 + phenotype is exclusively the CTL [48] . In PRRS-MLV IM (no adjuvant) vaccinated pigs, enhanced population of a T cell bearing CD3\u03b5 + CD4\u03b1 \u2212 CD8\u03b1 + phenotypic marker was detected at 26 dpv; and activated IFN-\u03b3 + CD3\u03b5 + CD4\u03b1 \u2212 CD8\u03b1 + and \u03b3\u03b4 T cells were detected in virus challenged pigs at 14 dpc. In addition, an upregulated IFN-\u03b3 + NK cell population was observed. The recall activated lymphocyte response was detected using the challenged PRRSV, but not with pooled conserved five peptides of Type 2 PRRSV of both structural and non-structural proteins [29] [30] [31] , suggesting that in our study tested peptides may not be highly immunogenic in pigs. Overall, increased population of activated (IFN-\u03b3 + ) T cell subsets in PRRS-MLV IM received pig groups compared to IN delivery was observed. However, due to low NA titers in the IM vaccinated pigs, the T cell response data alone may not suggest the heightened heterologous protective response. Both route of vaccination and administration of immunomodulators must be considered in improving vaccine immunity [49] . Aase et al. [50] report that IM immunization with meningococcal outer membrane vesicles in humans has induced significant IgG response, opsonophagocytic activity and serum bactericidal activity compared to IN group; but IN immunization with 10\u00d7 more vaccine antigen induced persistent mucosal and systemic antibody responses with antibacterial activity. In conclusion, until we identify a cost-effective potent adjuvant which has potent adjuvant effects akin to M. tb WCL, it is beneficial to use PRRS-MLV by IM route; which is currently practiced in most of the swine producing countries to control PRRS inspite of its ability to induce limited cross-protection.",
