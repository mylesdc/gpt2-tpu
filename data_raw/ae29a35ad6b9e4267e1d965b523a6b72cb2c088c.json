            "text": "The use of Chinese-origin rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) for infectious disease immunity research is increasing despite the relative lack of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I immunogenetics information available for this population. We determined transcript-based MHC class I haplotypes for 385 Chinese rhesus macaques from five different experimental cohorts, providing a concise representation of the full complement of MHC class I major alleles expressed by each animal. In total, 123 Mamu-A and Mamu-B haplotypes were defined in the full Chinese rhesus macaque cohort. We then performed an analysis of haplotype frequencies across the experimental cohorts of Chinese rhesus macaques, as well as a comparison against a group of 96 Indian rhesus macaques. Notably, 35 of the 51 Mamu-A and Mamu-B haplotypes observed in Indian rhesus macaques were also detected in the Chinese population, with 85% of the 385 Chinese-origin rhesus macaques expressing at least one of these class I haplotypes. This unexpected conservation of Indian rhesus macaque MHC class I haplotypes in the Chinese rhesus macaque population suggests that immunologic insights originally gleaned from studies using Indian rhesus macaques may be more applicable to Chinese rhesus macaques than previously appreciated and may provide an opportunity for studies of CD8 + T-cell responses between populations. It may also be possible to extend these studies across multiple species of macaques, as we found evidence of shared ancestral haplotypes between Chinese rhesus and Mauritian cynomolgus macaques.",

            "text": "Macaque monkeys are used extensively to model and understand human diseases. Historically, rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta; Mamu) of Indian origin have been preferred for such research. However, exportation of rhesus macaques from India was halted in 1978 (Southwick and Siddiqi 1994) . As it became more difficult to obtain Indian rhesus macaques, researchers turned to other sources, including Chineseorigin rhesus macaques. Chinese rhesus macaques have been used to study infectious diseases including simian immunodeficiency virus/ human immunodeficiency virus, avian influenza, malaria, plague, and severe acute respiratory syndrome, as well as studies of xenotransplantation, stem cell therapies, reproduction, and neurobiology (Shen et al. 2007; Chen et al. 2009 Chen et al. , 2011 Chen et al. , 2012 Choi et al. 2011; Liu et al. 2011; Tian et al. 2011; Wei et al. 2011; Hutnick et al. 2012; Li et al. 2012b; Ling et al. 2013; Mumbauer et al. 2013 ). Yet comparatively little is known about the immunogenetics of these animals. The genome of a single Chinese rhesus macaque was sequenced in 2011, but whole-genome sequencing technology struggles to accurately characterize highly polymorphic, duplicated regions such as the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) loci and killer immunoglobulin receptor loci (Fang et al. 2011) .",

Macaques may encode as many as 30 distinct MHC class I transcripts expressed at widely differing steady state levels in peripheral blood. However, combinations of distinct alleles are inherited together on a chromosome as haplotypes, making it possible to assign a simplified name (i.e., haplotype A007) to each specific combination of alleles. Here, unique haplotypes were defined on the basis of transcriptionally abundant \"major\" Mamu-A and Mamu-B alleles; an example of this simplification for the A007 haplotype is illustrated in Figure 1 . Our operational criterion for defining a \"major\" allele is that it must exceed a 4% transcript abundance relative to all class I transcripts identified per animal. We previously showed that CD8 + T-cell responses are principally restricted by highly transcribed major MHC class I alleles expressed in macaques, so we believe functionally defining haplotypes based on configurations of major alleles is appropriate for assessing conservation of MHC alleles involved in antigen presentation to CD8 + T cells (Budde et al. 2011) .",

Names were assigned to each haplotype based on the presence of what we call a \"diagnostic major\" allele. Mamu-A region haplotypes typically contained a single major allele, usually from the Mamu-A1 locus, so that allele was considered the \"diagnostic major.\" A few of the Mamu-A haplotypes and most of the Mamu-B haplotypes expressed two or more major alleles; for these haplotypes, the most transcriptionally abundant allele expressed on the haplotype was typically considered the \"diagnostic major\" allele. Occasionally the \"diagnostic major\" allele was selected based on known biological significance. For instance, even though the Mamu-B \u00c3 017 allele was not typically the most abundant transcript, it was considered the \"diagnostic major\" due to its known association with spontaneous control of SIV (Yant et al. 2006) . Different versions of a base haplotype, denoted with a lowercase letter following the haplotype name (for instance, B001a and B001b), were designated to indicate differences in the complement of major transcripts accompanying a shared diagnostic allele. By this method of haplotype definition, four simple haplotype names represent the full complement of MHC class I major alleles expressed by each macaque (Table S2 ).",

After identifying the 20 most common Chinese rhesus macaque Mamu-A and Mamu-B haplotypes across the data set as a whole, we examined the differences in the frequencies for those haplotypes between the five cohorts ( Figure 2 ). Frequencies were calculated based on the total number of chromosomes examined (770 Chinese rhesus macaque chromosomes), to account for each animal expressing pairs of Mamu-A and Mamu-B haplotypes. Some haplotype frequencies, such as A019, A018a, and B056a, were relatively consistent across the cohorts; however, some frequencies varied greatly from cohort to cohort. One example is the A004 haplotype, which was observed in~18% of the total chromosomes examined for cohort ChRh #5, but only~5% for cohort ChRh #2. Overall, frequency differences between cohorts were more pronounced for the Mamu-B haplotypes, and some cohorts did not contain one or more of the 20 most common Mamu-A and Mamu-B haplotypes. This finding is not unexpected for cohort ChRh #5, because it only contained 11 macaques. The remaining cohorts each contained at least 46 macaques, minimizing the effect of sample size on observed frequencies in these cohorts. These results emphasize the point that not all research Figure 1 Simplification of MHC class I allele calls from full allele down to haplotype designation.

Although several of these shared haplotypes were not among the most abundant in this study, there were four haplotypes (A004, A019, B001a, and B015b) observed at a chromosomal frequency of at least 3% in each population. Remarkably, 85% of the Chinese rhesus macaques in this study express at least one of the 35 shared Mamu-A or Mamu-B haplotypes (64% carry at least one of the 17 shared Mamu-A haplotypes, and 62% carry one or more of the 18 shared Mamu-B haplotypes). Likewise, 99% of the Indian rhesus macaques in this cohort express at least one haplotype shared with Chinese-origin animals ( Figure 5 ). Therefore, there is a high likelihood that these shared haplotypes were present in prior studies using Indian-origin rhesus macaques that researchers might reproduce or expand upon today using Chinese-origin rhesus macaques. MHC class I genotyping would need to be performed to confirm presence of shared haplotypes between populations for any specific studies.",

Mauritian cynomolgus macaques exhibit extremely limited MHC class I diversity, as the population arose from a small group of founder cynomolgus macaques deposited on the island in the 1500s (Lawler et al. 1995) . The MHC class I diversity of Mauritian cynomolgus macaques is effectively described by five Mafa-A and seven Mafa-B haplotypes (one Mafa-A haplotype is commonly associated with three distinct Mafa-B haplotypes) (Wiseman et al. 2007; Budde et al. 2010) . Three of our Mamu-A haplotypes (A033, A060, and A063) and two of our Mamu-B haplotypes (B045a and B150) were homologous to Mauritian cynomolgus macaque haplotypes (Table S1 ). Four of these haplotypes were observed exclusively in Chinese rhesus macaques; the fifth haplotype (B045a) was detected in both Chinese-origin and Indian-origin rhesus macaques. ",

However, our model of defining MHC class I haplotypes of coinherited highly expressed major alleles provides a novel approach for assessing putatively functional similarities between macaque populations. Most notably, more than two thirds of the haplotypes observed in Indian rhesus macaques were shared with Chinese rhesus macaques. This indicates that ancestral haplotypes were retained in both populations after the split from their most recent common ancestor~162,000 years ago, despite subsequent shrinking and expansion of the Indian and Chinese rhesus macaque populations, respectively (Hernandez et al. 2007) . Although Chinese rhesus macaques overall display a greater repertoire of MHC class I haplotypes private to the population than Indian rhesus macaques, 85% of the Chinese rhesus macaques in this study express at least one of the shared ancestral Mamu-A or Mamu-B haplotypes described here ( Figure 5 ). These homologous haplotypes may provide a valuable resource for cross-population studies of functional CD8 + T-cell immune response to pathogens.",

Though this remains to be tested at the haplotype level, a previous study demonstrated that it was possible to create Mamu-B \u00c3 017:03 (a Chinese rhesus macaquespecific allelic variant of the Mamu-B \u00c3 017 lineage) monomers and tetramers with the SIV Nef 165-173 peptide IW9 (Ouyang et al. 2009 ). This amino acid sequence was characterized as a CTL epitope restricted by Mamu-B \u00c3 017:01 in Indian rhesus macaques, an allele that has been associated with control of SIVmac239 viral replication (Mothe et al. 2002; Yant et al. 2006) . Mamu-B \u00c3 017:03 differs from Mamu-B \u00c3 017:01 by four amino acids, three of which occur in the peptide binding domain encoded by exons 2-3. These amino acid substitutions did not appear to alter the ability of Mamu-B \u00c3 017:03 to bind SIV Nef 165-173 peptide IW9 (Ouyang et al. 2009 ). If the highly similar allelic variants expressed on homologous haplotypes are also able to bind the same peptides, it is very likely those haplotypes would mount similar CD8 + T-cell responses in both Chinese-and Indianorigin rhesus macaques. To extend these observations, class I alleles of specific interest sharing a lineage designation would need to be analyzed for predicted binding preferences as well as the functional ability to present specific peptides.",

Comparison of the rhesus macaque haplotypes identified in this study to an established panel of Mauritian cynomolgus macaque haplotypes revealed a total of five putative orthologous haplotypes, including three of the five Mafa-A haplotypes. Interestingly, the cynomolgus macaque haplotypes with putative rhesus macaque orthologs account for more than 62% and 20% of the Mafa-A and Mafa-B diversity, respectively, in Mauritian cynomolgus macaques (Budde et al. 2010) . It may therefore be possible to also explore whether rhesus and cynomolgus macaques with conserved ancestral MHC class I haplotypes mount similar CD8 + Tcell immune responses. Additional haplotype similarities are also likely to exist between rhesus macaques and cynomolgus macaques of other geographic populations, or between rhesus macaques and other macaque species, but a current lack of defined haplotypes for these other populations make comparisons difficult.",
