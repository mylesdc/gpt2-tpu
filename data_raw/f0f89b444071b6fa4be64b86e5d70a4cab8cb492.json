In this study, next-generation sequencing (NGS) of immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) mRNA transcripts was combined with single-cell PCR cloning of E-binding monoclonal antibodies for analysing antibody response in a patient from the early stages of infection to more than one year after the clearance of the virus. The patient's IgH repertoire 14 and 64 days after symptom onset showed dramatic dominant clonal expansion but low clonal diversity. IgH repertoire 6 months after disease-free status had few dominant clones but increased diversity. E-binding antibodies appeared abundantly in the repertoire during the early stages of infection but quickly declined after clearance of the virus. Certain VH genes such as VH5-10-1 and VH4-39 appeared to be preferentially enlisted for a rapid antibody response to ZIKV infection. Most of these antibodies require relatively few somatic hypermutations to acquire the ability to bind to the E protein, pointing to a possible mechanism for rapid defence against ZIKV infection. This study provides a unique and holistic view of the dynamic changes and characteristics of the antibody response to ZIKV infection.",

            "text": "The human adaptive immune system consists of B and T cells, both of which play important roles in the defense against infections. A successful antibody response relies on the generation of a diverse repertoire of B cell receptors (BCRs). BCRs are membrane-bound antigen-binding immunoglobulins (Ig) that, like any antibody, are composed of two immunoglobulin heavy chains and two light chains. BCR diversity is achieved by rearrangement of the variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) gene segments in the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus (IgH) and the V and J gene segments in the light chain locus (Ig\u03bb or IgK) [13] . B cells are activated upon encountering an antigen that binds to their BCRs. Once a B cell encounters an antigen, it is recruited to a local lymph follicle and undergoes a process called somatic hypermutation (SHM), which increases the antigen-specific affinity in the germinal centres [14] . SHM occurs in a specific region, the complementary determining region (CDR), which is critical to antigen binding. The CDR is divided into three sub-regions: CDR1, CDR2, and CDR3. CDR3 typically plays a key role in determining antibody specificity and affinity [15] . Therefore, the CDR3 sequence is often used for lineage structure analysis of the antibody repertoire [16, 17] . Activated B cells proliferate and differentiate to generate a population of antibody-secreting plasma B cells and memory B cells. Antigen-specific memory B cells in humans peak 14-21 days after infection or vaccination and can account for approximately 1% of all B cells in the peripheral blood [18] . Memory B cells can differentiate into both long-lived memory B cells, which mediate a rapid recall response, and long-lived plasma cells, which maintain antibody production [13] .",

ZIKV E protein (Cat. No. 40543-V08B4; Sino Biological, Inc., Beijing, China) was used as a probe to isolate ZIKV E-specific memory B cells. CD3-CD20 + CD27 + IgG + HIS+ memory B cells were sorted using a multi-laser BD FACSAria\u2122 II cell sorter (BD Biosciences). Individual B cells were sorted into 96-well PCR plates containing 20 \u00b5L of lysis buffer per cell. The lysis buffer contained 0.25 \u00b5L RNasin\u00ae inhibitor (Promega, Madison, WI, USA), 5 \u00b5L 5 \u00d7 first-strand buffer, 1.25 \u00b5L 0.1 M DTT, and 0.0625 \u00b5L IGEPAL (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). PCR plates containing the sorted cells were frozen on dry ice then stored at -80\u00b0C or used for reverse transcription (RT). RT-PCR was performed and the Ig genes were cloned into expression vectors as described previously [19] . Briefly, RT was carried out by adding 1 \u00b5L of random hexamers (150 ng/\u00b5L; Promega), 2 \u00b5L dNTPs (each at 10 mM), and 0.5 \u00b5L SuperScript III (Invitrogen) to each well, followed by incubation at 42\u00b0C for 1 h. IgG heavy and light chain variable regions were independently amplified with nested PCR. The first round of PCR was performed with 2 \u00b5L of cDNA directly following RT with HotStarTaq Plus DNA polymerase (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and the primer mixtures. PCR was performed as follows: 1 cycle at 94\u00b0C for 5 min, 50 cycles at 94\u00b0C for 30 s, 55\u00b0C (round 1) or 60\u00b0C (round 2) for 30 s, and 72\u00b0C for 1 min, followed by 72\u00b0C for 10 min before cooling to 4\u00b0C. The PCR products were evaluated on 2% agarose gels. Regions displaying bands of the expected size (nearly 500 and 450 bp for the heavy chain and kappa/lambda chains, respectively) were excised from the gels and sent for Sanger sequencing after purification. Human antibody sequences were analysed using IMGT/V-QUEST (http://www.imgt. org/). Full-length IgG1 was expressed by co-transfecting HEK-293T cells with equal quantities of paired heavy and light chain plasmids based on the backbone of the pCI-neo vector [25] . Culture media were harvested four days after transfection and purified using protein A agarose (GE Healthcare).",

            "text": "To understand the dynamics of the antibody response to ZIKV infection in an individual, we used iRepertoire ARMS-PCR primers for unbiased amplification of the IgH mRNA transcripts in PBMCs. Between 2.4 and 3.9 million IgH sequence reads were obtained from the samples at each timepoint by NGS using an Illumina HiSeq 2500 sequencer ( Figure 1A ). During sample collection, the patient was serologically confirmed to have no DENV infection [34] . The day-14 repertoire contained the highest percentage of IgG transcripts, accounting for 58% of the total, which then decreased to 35%, 29%, and 19% of the total on days 64, 181, and 412, respectively. In contrast, the IgM transcripts were lowest in the 14-and 64-day repertoires, accounting for 27.6% and 26.6% of the total, respectively; however, the IgM transcripts increased on days 181 and 412-59.5% and 60.3%, respectively. As expected, the IgE abundance was very low at all time points. Interestingly, the IgD and IgA transcripts underwent a transient increase on day 64 ( Figure 1B, 1C) . To obtain a holistic view of the antibody repertoire dynamics over time, we constructed four tree-maps, each representing the 10,000 most frequent unique CDR3 sequences on days 14, 64, 181, or 412 ( Figure 1D ). Each rectangle in a tree-map represents a unique CDR3 and its size is proportional to the relative abundance of an individual CDR3 sequence at that timepoint. On day 14, the IgH repertoire appeared to contain many dominant clones, as demonstrated by the presence of many large rectangles in the corresponding tree-map. The IgH repertoire continued to show clonal expansion until at least day 64. The tree-map of the day-64 repertoire was similar to that of the day-14 repertoire and appeared very different from the tree-maps of the day-181 and day-412 repertoires. The dominant clone content of the antibody repertoire recessed from day 64 to day 181, as demonstrated by far fewer large rectangles in the day-181 repertoire. Notably, ZIKV RNA was detected in the patient's urine 13 days after disease onset, but it was undetectable at day 14 ( Figure S1 ). The tree-map of the day-181 repertoire was similar to that of the day-412 repertoire, indicating that the antibody response to ZIKV ceased before day 181 ( Figure 1D ). To assess the IgH repertoire diversity, we calculated the CDR3 diversity index (D50), which reflects the degree of clonal diversity [26] . The D50 values on day 14 and day 64 were the lowest (1.94 and 1.86, respectively). The D50 value increased to 6.37 on day 181 and 11.9 on day 412 ( Figure 1D ). Further evidence of lower antibody diversity during the early stages of infection was obtained by calculating the relative abundance of unique CDR3 sequences among the total CDR3 reads. The relative abundance of unique CDR3 sequences was lower in the day-14 (3.07%) and day-64 (2.64%) repertoires than in those of the day-181 (12.22%) and day-412 (10.23%) repertoires ( Figure 1A) . Taken together, these results illustrated that the antibody repertoire was largely committed to responding to the virus after ZIKV infection and lasted at least until day 64. However, when the ZIKV threat was over, the antibody repertoire recessed to a quiescent steady state with fewer dominant clones, but greater clonal diversity.",

Most interestingly, although VH5-10-1 had an extremely low frequency of global usage (0.32%) in the day-64, -181, and -412 repertoires, its usage transiently increased five-fold to 1.6% in the day-14 repertoire ( Figure 2 ), indicating its transient activation in response to ZIKV infection.

In contrast, some VH genes such as VH1-69 which is frequently used for antibodies in response to influenza virus infection, did not contribute to any of the E-binding mAbs that we cloned, despite the fact that VH1-69 had a relatively high frequency of global usage in the day-14 repertoire (4.7%) and day-412 repertoire (6.7%).",

We also analysed the SHM rates of 31 E-binding mAbs and compared these rates with those of their corresponding VH gene-derived IgH sequences in the repertoires ( Table 1 ). The average SHM rate of the 31 E-binding mAbs was 6.91% (1.72 \u2212 14.78%), with changes in 10.9 amino acids on average. Interestingly, the average SHM rate of 7 EDIII-targeted mAbs (7B3, 1C11, 7F4, 8D10, 6B6, 6D6, and 6F1) was 4.19% (3.44 \u2212 6.45%), with changes in 7.5 amino acids on average. We next compared the SHM rates of each mAb to all IgH sequences derived from the same VH gene in the repertoires ( Figure 3B ). The SHM rates of 23 out of 31 E-binding mAbs, including all 7 EDIII-targeted mAbs, were not higher than the average SHM rates of all IgH sequences derived from the same VH gene ( Figure 3B) .

These were all lower than the average SHM rate of all IgH sequences derived from VH5-10-1 (5.43%) and VH4-31 (8.05%) ( Figure 3B , Table 1 ). This result indicated that most E-binding antibodies, including EDIII-targeted antibodies, could be generated without high SHM rates, suggesting a potential mechanism for the rapid response to ZIKV infection.",

It was estimated that an adult person has approximately 5000 mL of blood [35] . Since the B cells that we sequenced were isolated from 6-8 mL of peripheral blood, the B cells harbouring the same V-J-CDR3 sequences may have been missed in the limited blood sample volumes that we obtained. To our surprise, 17 out of 31 E-binding mAbs with the same V-J -CDR3 sequences were found in the day-14 repertoire, whereas only 4, 3, and 3 mAbs with the same V-J-CDR3 sequences were found in the day-64, -181, and -412 repertoires, respectively ( Figure 4A ). This result indicated that the B cells producing E-binding antibodies were abundantly present in peripheral blood soon after infection, while these B cells quickly disappeared after the clearance of ZIKV infection. It is important to note that the 31 E-binding mAbs were cloned from the memory B cells in PBMCs collected on day 64. We next performed a two-dimensional identitydivergence analysis by searching the IgH lineage sequences of three representative mAbs (6A6, 6B6, and 8D10) in the repertoires corresponding to each time point. These three mAbs were neutralizing antibodies and their V-J-CDR3 sequences were found on day 14 but not thereafter, indicating that these mAbs were abundant on day 14 ( Figure 4B ). IgH lineage sequences that are highly homologous with mAb 6A6 were found in the day-14 and day-64 repertoires, but not in the day-181 and day-412 repertoires.

The titre of E-binding antibodies was at the highest level on days 14 and 64 but decreased on days 114 and 412. This result is in line with the dynamic changes in the IgH repertoires revealed by the tree-maps, which showed dominant clonal expansion on days 14 and 64 ( Figure 1C) . Therefore, many of these clones appeared to have emerged in response to the ZIKV infection. Notably, the ZIKV neutralizing activities and EDIIItargeted antibodies were at the highest level on day 14, then declined on day 64 onward ( Figure 4C ).

During \"wartime\" and the aftermath (the first two months after ZIKV infection), there was a dramatic expansion of dominant B cell clones in response to ZIKV infection; therefore, clonal diversity was lower. During \"peacetime\" (six months and one year after disease), the antibody repertoire recessed to a state involving few dominant B cell clones and greater B cell clonal diversity. Given that heavy chain antibodies play a key role in antibody binding, the contribution of the light chain was not assessed in the present study. However, this may constitute a worthwhile investigation in the future. It is important to note that the patient was verified to be DENV-negative during sample collection and showed no crossreactivity to DENV E protein for serum samples collected between two months and two years post-ZIKV infection [34] , indicating that this individual had no DENV infection prior to or after the primary ZIKV infection. We inferred that if this individual manifested a DENV infection after recovery from ZIKV infection, the IgH repertoires would likely reveal changes such as the dramatic expansion of dominant B cell clones in response to a new infection. However, the IgH repertoires on day 181 and day 412 showed fewer dominant B cell clones with higher clonal diversity than the IgH repertoires on day 14 and day 64. The heavy chain was plotted as a function of sequence similarity to the template and sequence divergence from the putative germline gene. The x-axis represents the percentage of diversity from VH genes 6A6H for VH5-10-1, 6B6H for VH4-4, and 8D10H for VH4-31 germline. The sequences are shown as a heatmap with the indicated colours.

Each unique sequence represents a B cell clone. B cells containing the exact or same lineage of IgH sequences may have been missed in the blood samples collected. Although impossible for a living subject, a complete antibody repertoire should ideally come from sequencing all B cells in an individual. Our study demonstrated that even 6-8 mL of peripheral blood can provide insightful information about antibody response. Among the 31 Ebinding mAbs that we cloned from this single individual, 17 mAbs with the same V-J-CDR3 sequences could be found in the day-14 repertoire, whereas only 4 and 3 mAbs with the same V-J-CDR3 sequences could be found in the day-64 and day-181 repertoires, respectively. This finding demonstrated that B cells expressing these E-binding mAbs or their closely related lineage clones were present soon after ZIKV infection. A recent analysis of serum antibody epitope repertoires of ZIKV-infected patients also revealed that E-binding and EDIII-targeted antibodies were present early, even on the day of symptom onset, and matured with increasing affinity as early as day 7 after symptom onset [36] . This result supported our NGS analysis that B cells expressing E-binding and EDIII-targeted antibodies were abundantly present soon after ZIKV infection.",

These mAbs exhibited weak-to-moderate neutralizing potency. One mAb had no SHM capacity, but could nevertheless bind to an immunodominant epitope and neutralize ZIKV [38] .

            "text": "It would have been ideal if we could have obtained PBMCs from this patient before his infection, however, it would be impossible to predict who will be infected prior to infection. Nevertheless, we gathered that the PBMCs from day 412 could be considered the \"no infection state.\" Based on our NGS analysis of the IgH repertoire, we obtained the frequency of global VH gene usage in the same subject from early infection until over one year after recovery. Diverse VH genes were used to generate E-binding mAbs; i.e. 17 VH genes contributed to 31 mAbs that we cloned from memory B cells. However, several VH genes, such as VH4-39 and VH3-23, had a high frequency of global VH gene usage at all timepoints and a high frequency of representation among the E-binding mAbs. The contribution of the VH5-10-1 gene was particularly interesting. As in the general population [11] , VH5-10-1 had a very low frequency of global VH gene usage in this patient. In this study, although VH5-10-1 had a very low frequency of global usage (average 0.32%) in the day-64, -181, and -412 repertoires, its usage on day 14 after ZIKV infection transiently elevated five-fold to 1.6%. Since VH5-10-1 had a high percentage of representation among the E-binding mAbs and low SHM rates (Table 1) , we propose that VH5-10-1 was likely preferentially enlisted for rapid response to ZIKV infection in this patient. Such rapid response required only low level SHM activity; therefore, these antibodies do not require a long maturation process to achieve affinity. In this study, all three VH5-10-1-derived mAbs (6A6, 6A9, and 6G3) had low SHM rates ranging between 4.17% and 4.51% ( Figure 3B , Table 1 ). ZIKV specific mAbs derived from VH5-10-1 has also been reported in other patients in response to ZIKV infection. For instance, another group reported that VH5-10-1 was frequently used by ZIKV-specific antibodies in DENV-ZIKV crossinfected patients and in primary ZIKV-infected patients [11] . In comparison, VH1-69 had a high frequency of global usage, but it did not contribute to any E-binding mAbs that we cloned. Among ZIKV E-binding mAbs reported by other researchers, VH1-69 was also rarely used. Since VH1-69 is frequently used in antibodies against the influenza virus [39, 40] , it is likely that VH1-69 is preferentially enlisted for responding to pathogens like the influenza virus but not ZIKV. In our study, by combining single B cell antibody cloning and longitudinal analysis of IgH repertoires in the same patient, we found that several VH genes such as VH5-10-1, VH4-39, and VH3-23 appeared to be preferentially enlisted for the rapid generation of E-binding antibodies after ZIKV infection. mAbs with low SHM rates have also been isolated from patients infected with Ebola virus, RSV, and MERS-CoV [41] [42] [43] . Antibodies with a large number of SHMs require frequent antigen encounters and helper T cells in the germinal centre. We proposed that as a mechanism for rapid defence against ZIKV infection, which generally manifests a short disease course, certain VH genes are preferentially selected to generate ZIKV-specific antibodies without the need to undergo a long maturation process. When a person is exposed to ZIKV infection, the primary B cell response from na\u00efve B cells can rapidly generate ZIKV-specific antibodies, including neutralizing antibodies that do not require the accumulation of a large number of SHMs. The preferential usage of these VH genes may be attributed to evolution through many years of interaction between Homo sapiens and ZIKV, along with other flaviviruses. Our longitudinal analysis of IgH repertoires corroborated well with the results from single B cell antibody cloning and with the neutralizing, E-binding, and EDIII-binding activities in the serum samples collected from days 14-412. Our study showed that EDIII-targeted antibodies in the IgH reservoirs correlated well with serum-neutralizing activities against ZIKV. This result was also in line with a report that the presence of EDIII-targeted antibodies correlated with serum-neutralizing activity against ZIKV [8] . Our study also indicated that E-binding antibodies persisted longer than EDIII-binding antibodies and neutralizing antibodies in this patient, implying that EDI-and EDII-binding antibodies may last longer in the patient. Since most EDI-and EDIIbinding antibodies have no or low-neutralizing activities, they may play a role in the antibody-mediated enhancement of infection of other flaviviruses that share similar epitopes. It would be worthwhile to study a large cohort of samples in the future. This study provides insight on the antibody response after ZIKV infection and has implications for the design and development of vaccines against ZIKV.",
