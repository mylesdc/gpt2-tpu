Because of the special locus of this gene, it can be deduced that this gene may associate with many diseases, and this hypothesis was confirmed by many research results [2, 3] . TNF-\u03b1 is a key mediator of the inflammatory response and is critical for host defense against a wide variety of pathogenic microbes. However, the over-expression of this cytokine may lead to badness in disease recovery. The dual role of TNF, acting as an agent of both innate immunity and inflammatory pathology, poses a considerable challenge for gene regulation [2] , and this regulation mainly located on promoter region of this gene. The capacity for cytokine production in an individual has a major genetic component, and striking differences existed among individuals in terms of their ability to produce cytokines. Several biallelic polymorphisms had been described within the TNF\u03b1 gene, including seven in the promoter region at positions -1031T\u2192C, -863C\u2192A, -857C\u2192T, -376G\u2192A, -308G\u2192A, -238G\u2192A and -163G\u2192A base pairs from the transcription start site [4, 5] . Moreover, a number of studies had shown that the TNF-\u03b1 promoter polymorphism had a significant effect on its transcriptional activity [6, 7] .",

SARS-CoV infection is important because of its high infectivity and unpredictable clinical course, which is characterized by a high mortality rate [8] . Till now, many researchers had reported that susceptibilities to infection SARS-CoV may associated with HLA, MXA, OAS-1 and CLEC4M gene polymorphisms [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] , yet these results were variable in different populations. For example, Ng reported that SARS-CoV infection was associated with HLA-B*0703 and HLA-DRB1*0301 in HongKong population [9] , however, Lin's results showed that HLA-B*4601 and HLA-B*5401 were closely related to SARS-CoV infection [10] . Chan reported that CLEC4M was attributed to SARS-CoV infection [13] , but Zhi's results failed to support this conclusion. 7 These differences may be attributed to the study population used in each report, also the complex mechanism infection to SARS-CoV should be considered as another factor of these differences. In order to explore more host factors influencing the occurrence of SARS-CoV infection, we studied the polymorphisms of TNF-\u03b1 gene at the promoter region, which had been ascribed to polymorphisms within the regulatory regions or signal sequences of cytokine genes [14] .",

The cause of this disease was still unknown and there were arguments about it. For example, some author considered SARS-CoV as the cause of femoral head necrosis, yet other authors disagreed with this view [20, 21] . Previous studies showed that femoral head necrosis may caused by hormone usage [20] , yet our data failed to agree with this point.

Till now, many researchers have reported that susceptibility to infection SARS-CoV may associate with HLA, MXA, OAS-1 and CLEC4M gene polymorphisms, yet the results are variable in different populations [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . These differences may be attributed to the study population used in each report, also the complex mechanism infection to SARS-CoV should be considered as another factor of these differences. In order to explore more host factor influence the occurrence of SARS-CoV infection, we studied the polymorphisms of TNF-\u03b1 gene at the promoter region, which have been ascribed to polymorphisms within the regulatory regions or signal sequences of cytokine genes [14] . Allele distributions at -1031, -863, -857, -572, -238 and -163 were almost the same among the SARS, the health care workers and individual controls, but a higher A allele frequency in SARS population when compared with the control at the -308 locus(X 2 = 8.96, P = 0.003). Though previous study showed that TNF-\u03b1 -308 AG genotype was associated with the clearance of Hepatitis B virus and the infection of Helicobacter pylori cagA subtype infection [24, 25] , our results failed to show the role of this locus in SARS-CoV infection and this conclusion agreed with that of Chong WP et al [26] . We found that there was a weak protective effect of CT genotype at -204 locus of TNF-\u03b1 gene against SARS-CoV infection. The -204 locus was a new discovered SNP site of TNF-\u03b1 promoter region and its role in infectious diseases might need further study. At the same time, no obvious association between the polymorphisms of TNF\u03b1 promoter region with the severity of SARS was observed.",

            "text": "TNF-\u03b1, a key mediator of the inflammatory response, is critical for host defense against a wide variety of pathogenic microbes, but a higher concentration of this cytokine may cause severe pathology. The capacity for cytokine production in an individual has a major genetic component, and striking differences existed among individuals in terms of their ability to produce cytokines. A number of studies had shown that the TNF-\u03b1 promoter polymorphism has a significant effect on transcriptional activity [6, 7] . During the process of SARS-CoV infection, there was a cytokine storm in patients including IL-1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1 and TGF-\u03b2 1 [28] . The elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines which may cause immuno-mediated damage to lung and other organs, resulting in acute lung injury and, subsequently, multi-organ dysfunction [29] . So, TNF-\u03b1 genetic variation may potentially alter inflammation and fibrosis in the lung. After discharging from hospital, interstitial lung fibrosis was observed in cured SARS patients and the prevalence rate was 21%(42/200). TNF-\u03b1 was one of the earliest cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of lung fibrosis disease and, together with IL-1, has been found to over-express in regenerating type II pneumocytes in human lung, thus enhancing fibroblast proliferation [16] .TNF-\u03b1 genetic polymorphisms have been found significantly associated with increased risk of developing pulmonary fibrosis [17, 18] . During the progress of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, activated epithelial cells are thought to release potent fibrogenic molecules and cytokines, such as TNF-\u03b1 and TGF-\u03b2 1 , which in turn foster the transformation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts and promote their production of extracellular matrix molecules and a vicious cycle of injury and abnormal epithelial healing sets the stage for progressive fibrosis and architectural distortion of the lung parenchyma [7] . However, our data failed to show that alleles at -1031(T\u2192C), -863(C\u2192A), -857(C\u2192T), -572(A\u2192C), -308(G\u2192A) and -238(G\u2192A) were related to interstitial lung fibrosis when compared with non-interstitial lung fibrosis in SARS patients. At the same time, -204 and -163 were homozygote genotype of TT and GG respectively in SARS patients and no relationship of genotype with interstitial lung fibrosis could be calculated. This result implicated that there maybe a different mechanism of interstitial lung fibrosis of SARS compared with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.",

            "text": "Femoral head necrosis, another sequela of discharged SARS patients, prevailed with a rate of 22.07%(49/221) in Tianjin [15] . However, the cause of this sequela was still unknown and there were arguments about it. For example, some author considered SARS-CoV as the cause of femoral head necrosis, yet other authors disagree with this view [20, 21] . Previous studies showed that femoral head necrosis may caused by hormone usage, our data was far to agree with this conclusion. There was no obvious association between hormone using including hormone dosage, method and lasting period with femoral head necrosis in binary logistic analysis in SARS patients. We found that the -1031 CT and CC genotypes were more frequent in SARS patients with femoral head necrosis(53.7% and 6.7%, respectively) than in non-femoral head necrosis(20.0% and 0.0%, respectively). And CT and CC were related with a risk effect on femoral head necrosis with ORs (95%CI) of 5.33(1.39-20.45) and 5.67(2.74-11.71), respectively when compared to TT genotype. The hormone using adjusted OR of CT was 5.25(95%CI 1. 18-23.46 ) and the combined (CT and CC) genotype OR was 6.0 (95%CI 1.60-22.55). Also, the -863 AC genotype accounted for 43.7% of femoral head necrosis group but 10.8% of non-femoral head necrosis. Compared to CC genotype, the AC genotype was manifested as another risk effect associated with femoral head necrosis with OR(95%CI) of 6.42 (1.53-26.88 ) and the adjusted OR was 8.40(95%CI 1.76-40.02) in cured SARS patients. TNF-\u03b1 can activate activity of osteoclasts and accelerate absorption of the bone and cartilage and induce occurrence of oxygen free radicals an d lipid peroxidation, which can induce ischemic necrosis of the femoral head [30] . So, the ploymophism TNF-\u03b1 gene may be directly or indirectly attributed to the occurrence of femoral head necrosis in SARS patients.",
