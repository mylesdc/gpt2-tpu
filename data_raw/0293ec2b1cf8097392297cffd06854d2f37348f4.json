UP refers to pneumonia, which could be life-threatening, characterized by rapid progression, a normal white blood cell count range, and poor response to antibiotics. 1 Although the common pathogens causing UP are viruses or atypical pathogens, their overlapping clinical manifestations can impede the ability of clinicians to directly diagnose the causative pathogens, which may lead to unnecessary antimicrobial usage. Thus, rapid and precise diagnosis of the causative agents is critical for the prompt management of UP.",

In May 2011, the FilmArray respiratory panel (FA-RP) was FDA cleared for the detection of 17 respiratory viral pathogens, including Influenza A (H1-2009, H3, H1, and \"not subtyped\")/B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus, adenovirus, coronavirus (HKU1, OC43, NL63, and 229E), human rhinovirus/enterovirus, parainfluenza (including subtype 1, 2, 3, and 4), and three bacteria (Bordetella pertussis, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae). The turnaround time using this panel is approximately 1 hour; thus, this technique can ease the rapid and accurate identification of the pathogens causing UP. 4 With the increasing implementation of the FA-RP in clinical microbiology laboratories, further studies are required to determine the clinical diagnostic ability of the method and its influence on patient outcomes and antimicrobial usage. Accordingly, in this study, we aimed to evaluate the clinical impact of FA-RP on UP patient treatment compared with conventional methods. To this end, we prospectively enrolled patients diagnosed with UP and analyzed the pathogen detection ability of the FA-RP. Moreover, we evaluated the clinical impact of FA-RP on patients based on a comparison of the clinical outcomes and medical records of the patient cohort enrolled during the period from October 2016 to March 2018 with the data of a cohort retrospectively collected for the period between October 2014 and March 2016. We aimed to evaluate the effect of using the FilmArray in terms of the quantification of antimicrobial use, use of antiviral drugs, and de-escalation or adjustment of antibiotic treatment.",

Among those patients who received a positive test result for the Influenza virus, 100% (43/43) were treated with oseltamivir that is notably higher than the 74%-81% reported in other studies carried out in the United States. 15,16 Moreover, adjustment of antibiotic therapy was reported for 69.6% (78/112) of the patients in the FA-RP group, compared with only 5.1% (4/79) in the control group. These findings strongly indicate that the results of the FA-RP test may assist in clinical decision making, particularly with respect to reducing unnecessary antibiotic usage in the treatment of UP. The rapid identification of pathogens causing respiratory tract infection has both essential clinical and public health values. In the present study, 15 of the enrolled patients were promptly isolated as soon as the diagnosis of Influenza virus infection had been established. In contrast, for the control group patients who did not receive precise diagnosis of causing agents, no comparable isolation measures were undertaken. Such a lack of an accurate diagnosis may lead to a delay in patient isolation and, consequently, the wider spread of viruses. Moreover, for these patients, we consciously sought to regularly analyze the viral nucleic acids in the patient's respiratory specimens using real-time PCR, and patients were discharged only after the nucleic acid test proved negative, thereby reducing the risk of the disease spreading. To further evaluate the clinical impact of the FA-RP, we compared the antibiotic use of adult UP patients in the FA-RP cohort and the historical control cohort, the latter of which were diagnosed only by using conventional methods. We found that compared with the control cohort, the intervention group had significantly lower antimicrobial DDDs, particularly with respect to the use of antibiotics and antifungal drugs. These results thus serve to highlight that given the benefit of an accurate diagnosis of the etiology, a more reasonable antibiotic usage could be achieved. These results are partially consistent with the findings of some previously published studies. For example, Rogers et al 17 evaluated the outcomes in pediatric patients (3 months to 21 years old) admitted to hospital with an acute respiratory illness, and, similar to the findings of the present study, found that the use of FA-RP facilitated a reduction in the duration of antibiotic use and the length of hospitalization.

Therefore, intervention group patients positive for Influenza A took follow-up PCR tests. The patients could not be discharged from the hospital until they met the criteria.
