Here, we show that Xoo-induced rice leaf blight is effectively controlled by niclosamide, an oral antihelminthic drug and molluscicide, which also functions as an anti-tumor agent. Niclosamide directly inhibited the growth of the three Xoo strains PXO99, 10208 and K3a. Niclosamide moved long distances from the site of local application to distant rice tissues. Niclosamide also increased the levels of salicylate and induced the expression of defense-related genes such as OsPR1 and OsWRKY45, which suppressed Xoo-induced leaf wilting. Niclosamide had no detrimental effects on vegetative/reproductive growth and yield. These combined results indicate that niclosamide can be used to block bacterial leaf blight in rice with no negative side effects.",

            "text": "Enhancing plant genetic resistance is an effective method for controlling bacterial leaf blight disease. A number of studies have identified plant genes that confer resistance against Xanthomonas bacteria. At least 38 bacterial leaf blight resistance gene (R genes), designated in series from Xa1 to Xa38, have been identified 16, 17 . Six of these genes have been cloned (Xa1, xa5, xa13, Xa21, Xa3/Xa26, and Xa27), and six additional genes have been physically mapped (Xa2, Xa4, Xa7, Xa30, Xa33, and Xa38) [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . Two major classes of R genes, receptor kinase (RLK) and nucleotide-binding site leucine rice repeat (NBS)-LRR, are involved in disease resistance in rice. Xa21 is the first R gene of the RLK class to be cloned with a broad spectrum of resistance, and Xa1 is an R gene of the NBS-LRR class 23 , which is the largest R gene class conferring resistance against bacteria, fungi, and viruses 24 . Other R genes, including xa5 and xa13, encode proteins such as a small subunit of the transcription factor IIA (TFIIA\u03b3 ) and a plasma membrane protein, respectively 25, 26 . These data have been used to develop a breeding program for bacterial leaf blight-resistant rice. The introduction of resistance genes xa5, xa13, and Xa21 into new cultivars conferred a high level of resistance against Xoo 27 , indicating that germplasm screening against bacterial leaf blight and breeding-mediated transfer of resistant genes to target cultivars can generate new rice cultivars with increased resistance to bacterial leaf blight disease. Large-scale experiments, including microarrays, were used to isolate genes related to bacterial leaf blight; a large number of candidate genes was selected, although their functions were not clearly identified 28, 29 . A transgenic approach was employed to protect rice from bacterial leaf blight and fungal blast. For example, transgenic rice overexpressing cecropin B (an antibacterial peptide from Bombyx mori) showed increased resistance to bacterial leaf blight 30 . The introduction of multiple bacterial blight resistance genes (Xa4, xa5, xa13, and Xa21) into rice conferred resistance to six Xoo bacteria 31 . Rice transformants overexpressing WRKY30 are resistant to Xoo 32 and the fungal pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae 33 , and those overexpressing WRKY45 displayed markedly enhanced resistance to bacterial leaf blight and fungal blast disease [34] [35] [36] . These results suggest that transgenic approaches can be effectively utilized to develop disease-resistant rice.",

Therefore, we focused our current efforts on screening known chemicals for their effects on rice leaf blight. We are interested in the discovery of a master regulator that effectively functions to protect animals and plants from infectious diseases mediated by bacteria, fungi, and/or parasites. Therefore, we first considered infectious diseases of humans. We selected two drugs that cure infectious diseases in humans, auranofin [3,4,5-triacetyloxy-6-(acetyloxymethyl)oxane-2-thiolate] and niclosamide [5-chloro-N-(2-chloro-4nitrophenyl)-2-hydroxybenzamide], for further analysis. However, because auranofin is much more expensive than niclosamide, we focused our initial screen on niclosamide. Niclosamide has been widely used since 1960 to treat gastrointestinal tapeworm infections in both humans and animals. Recent studies show that niclosamide has antiviral activity against the severe acute respiratory syndrome virus 37 , anti-anthrax toxin properties 38 , and anti-neoplastic activity 39 . Niclosamide strongly induces LC3-positive autophagosomes 40 , inhibits the Wnt/ Frizzled pathway 41 , suppresses the autonomous notch-signaling pathway 42 , and inhibits mTOR signaling 43 . Niclosamide uncouples mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation 44 and thereby slows cell growth. These combined results indicate that niclosamide has various curative effects on humans and animals. We reasoned that niclosamide might affect plant disease responses by modulating disease signaling pathways as a broad spectrum regulator. Therefore, we investigated the effect of niclosamide on bacterial leaf blight in rice.",

Several recent studies report that niclosamide is active against cancer cells 39, 50, 51 , which indicates that niclosamide has broad-spectrum disease control activity. Therefore, we examined whether niclosamide had inhibitory activity against rice leaf blight, and found that the leaf blight symptoms were suppressed by niclosamide through inhibition of Xoo growth and lesion development (Figs 2 and 3) . Niclosamide moved systemically from the local application site to Xoo-inoculated distal leaves, and inhibited lesion development and leaf wilting by inhibiting Xoo growth in distal leaves (Fig. 4) . We examined the effect of niclosamide on the growth of three Xoo strains, and found that it inhibited their growth (Fig. 1a,e) . Next, we evaluated whether niclosamide induced the expression of the defense-related genes OsPR1, OsPR10, OsWRKY45, OsWRKY62, OsWRKY71, and OsHI-LOX, and detected higher transcript levels for these genes (Fig. 6) . These results clearly indicate that niclosamide blocks the development of rice leaf blight by directly inhibiting Xoo bacterial growth (Figs 2c and 3c) and/or by inducing defense-related gene expression (Fig. 6) . Niclosamide also inhibited Xag growth, which causes bacterial leaf pustule disease in soybean 45 , although its inhibitory effect against Xag was weaker than that against Xoo strains (Fig. 1a) . This suggests that niclosamide may inhibit the growth of select bacterial pathogens of other crops and thereby protect them from disease. Jasmonate (JA) and SA function in plant defense pathways by inducing the expression of numerous genes 52 . Treatment of rice leaves with benzothiadiazole or probenazole induced SA accumulation and increased resistance to bacterial blight and fungal blast caused by Xoo and M. grisea, respectively 13, 14, 34 . Our qRT-PCR analysis showed that niclosamide induced the expression of SA-dependent genes in rice leaves (Fig. 6) . We investigated whether niclosamide induced defense mechanisms directly by functioning like a phytohormone, or indirectly via SA-mediated signaling pathways. We measured the levels of free SA and its conjugate glucosyl-SA, and found that their levels were higher in niclosamide-treated leaves than in control leaves (Fig. 7) . This indicates that increase in SA level can contribute to the blockage of Xoo lesion development by niclosamide.",

OsWRKY30 triggers the expression of JA-responsive genes and JA accumulation, and provides rice with resistance to fungal pathogens Rhizoctonia solani and M. grisea 33 . OsWRKY45 expression regulates JA accumulation and resistance to the rice blast fungus M. grisea 53 . Our results showed that the expression of OsHI-LOX, a JA-responsive gene, was induced in niclosamide-treated leaves (Fig. 6 ). This indicates that JA-dependent defense signaling pathways can also contribute to the blockage of Xoo lesion development by niclosamide. Pathogens are sensitive to the activities of certain classes of drugs. The antibiotic streptomycin, which is commonly used in animals and humans, protects crops from some bacterial and fungal pathogens 15 . Niclosamide serves as an oral antihelminthic drug, molluscicide, and anti-tumor agent in human disease; therefore, we reasoned that niclosamide might have beneficial effects on bacterial and fungal diseases of rice. Niclosamide inhibited growth of the fungal pathogen M. oryzae, although this effect was much weaker than that against pathogenic Xoo bacteria (Fig. 1b) . This suggests that niclosamide may inhibit the growth of other fungal pathogens and thereby protect plants from fungal diseases. Benzothiadiazole and probenazole induce SA pathway-mediated defense responses in plants by acting as chemical inducers 13,14,34,54-57 , leading to strong resistance against bacterial and fungal pathogens. Niclosamide induces the expression of both SA-and JA-responsive genes in rice (Fig. 6 ). This indicates that niclosamide may also be effective against fungi due to JA. Further study of the effects of niclosamide against other fungal pathogens will indicate whether the compound can protect plants from diseases caused by fungal pathogens.",

Niclosamide inhibits glucose uptake, mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, and anaerobic metabolism in parasitic helminths 44 . It also inhibits transcription and DNA binding of the NF\u03ba \u0392 pathway, and increases ROS levels to induce apoptosis in acute myelogenous leukemia cells 50 . Recent work reports that niclosamide inhibits Pseudomonas aeruginosa quorum sensing 58 . These results suggest that niclosamide controls signaling networks of prokaryotes and eukaryotes by modulating metabolic and signaling pathways. Currently, we do not know the mechanism underlying niclosamide-mediated inhibition of Xoo growth and induction of SA-and JA-dependent plant defense responses. Future work will examine the effects of niclosamide on glucose metabolism, the transcriptome and proteome, and quorum sensing to identify the mechanism by which niclosamide inhibits bacterial leaf blight in rice. Further investigations of the effects of niclosamide on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, changes in transcriptome and ROS levels, and changes in hormone signals (including SA and JA) also are required to fully characterize its functions as a broad-spectrum signaling regulator in plants.",

The use of antibiotics and chemicals in open fields over large expanses of land may increase the frequency of antibiotic resistance in gene pools, or possible chemical accumulation in plant tissues and the food chain. Niclosamide is a teniacide, which is effective against cestodes such as tapeworms that infect humans and many other animals (although it is not effective against as pinworms and roundworms). Niclosamide also is used as a piscicide. Recent work reported that it appeared to be safe and well tolerated in humans, even when used in mass treatment campaigns in several countries, although it has known adverse effects including nausea, retching, abdominal pain, light headedness, pruritus, vomiting, and dizziness 59 . There are no previous reports of niclosamide effects on plant growth, other organisms, or the food chain. We cannot state that niclosamide treatment of agricultural crops is safe for other organisms or for the food chain because research in this area is still lacking. Therefore, further studies on the function and stability of niclosamide under natural environmental conditions and when applied to crop plants are required to determine whether niclosamide has adverse effects on other organisms and human health when applied to plants.",

Further functional studies on niclosamide-mediated growth inhibition of bacterial and fungal pathogens, and elucidation of its role in plant signaling pathways, will provide information about the mechanism underlying niclosamide activity in plants. Field tests evaluating the effects of niclosamide application on rice plants will provide information on whether it has adverse effects on other organisms or the food chain. Examining the effect of niclosamide on Xoo bacterial growth. The effect of niclosamide on the growth of Xoo strains PXO99, 10208, and K3a, and a Xag strain, and the MIC of niclosamide against the PXO99 and 10208 strains were investigated. Xoo and Xag strains were obtained from the Rural Development Administration, Korea. Bacterial strains were cultivated in peptone-sucrose broth containing 15 \u03bc g/ml of the antibiotic cephalexin (Sigma-Aldrich), and grown to an optical density of 1.0 at 600 nm. Then, 2 \u03bc l of each culture was grown on agar medium containing different concentrations of niclosamide (0\u2212 50 \u03bc g/ml) to examine the effects of niclosamide on bacterial growth. Inoculated plates were incubated at 28 \u00b0C for 48 h and then photographed. The same method was used to determine whether parthenolide had bactericidal activity against the PXO99 and 10208 strains. The bactericidal activity of niclosamide on three different E. coli strains, Top10, Rosseta2, and DH10b, also was examined. The E. coli strains were cultivated in LB medium to an optical density of 1.0 at 600 nm. Then, 2 \u03bc l of each culture was grown on agar medium containing different concentrations of niclosamide.

RNA samples were extracted from leaves treated with mock (\u2022), 4 \u03bc g/ml niclosamide (\u25cb ), 8 \u03bc g/ml niclosamide (\u25bc ), 20 \u03bc g/ ml niclosamide (\u0394 ), and 40 \u03bc g/ml niclosamide (\u25a0 ) at four time points (0, 0.5, 12, and 24 h). OsPR1, OsPR10, OsWRKY45, OsWRKY62, OsWRKY71, OsHI-LOX, and OsACS2 transcripts were amplified by qRT-PCR using gene-specific primers.Scientific RepoRts | 6:21209 | DOI: 10.1038/srep21209 Methods Plant materials and chemicals. The rice (Oryza sativa) japonica cultivar, Nipponbare, was used in this study. Before treatment with the pathogen or niclosamide, plants were grown in a greenhouse maintained at 31 \u00b0C in the light and 25 \u00b0C in the dark under a 16 h photoperiod until the booting stage. The chamber was equipped with incandescent lights. Stock solutions of niclosamide (Sigma-Aldrich) and parthenolide (Sigma-Aldrich) were made by dissolving the chemicals in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at a concentration of 5 mg/ml. The stock solutions were diluted in distilled water before use.",
