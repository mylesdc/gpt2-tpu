A total of 1,083 patients with pneumonia or lower respiratory tract infections were admitted during this period. Among them, we selected patients with MP using two IgM serologic tests: the indirect microparticle agglutinin assay (MAA: Serodia-Myco II, Fujirebio, Japan; positive cutoff value \u22651:40) and the cold agglutinins titer (positive cutoff value \u22651:32). Following parental consent, both assays and some laboratory indices were routinely performed twice: once at the time of admission and once at discharge (mean: 6.0 \u00b1 2.1 days apart). Subjects were selected for inclusion in the study if seroconversion was shown on both assays during admission, or if increased MAA-positive titers (\u22654-fold) with corresponding cold agglutinin titers (including seroconversion) were displayed on the second test. Patients who tested positive in both assays at admission, but did not have increased or decreased titers at discharge, were regarded as having recent past infection and were excluded from the study (38 cases). Blood culture for bacterial pathogens was performed for all pneumonia patients. Nasopharyngeal aspirates or sputum for viral agents (influenza viruses type A and B, parainfluenza viruses, respiratory syncytial virus, and adenoviruses) and PCR for M. pneumoniae were examined in the majority of patients (129 patients).",

We found that MP affects children of all age groups, whereas the clinical phenotype of MP differs with age. Compared with the younger children, the older children had a more severe clinical course, manifested by longer total duration of fever, higher CRP, and a more severe pneumonia pattern. Recent clinical studies have also reported that some clinical features differ between younger children (\u22645 years of age) and older children (>6 years of age) [4, 5] .
