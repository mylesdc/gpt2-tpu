            "text": "Environmental surfaces contaminated with pathogens are thought to play an important role in the contact transmission route because pathogens can be transferred to the facial mucous membranes or other sites on a susceptible person via contact by hands or other fomites [1] . Respiratory viruses such as influenza viruses and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) are transmitted, at least in part, through the contact route [2] . These viruses significantly impact the health of healthcare workers (HCWs). During the 2003 SARS-CoV outbreak, healthcare workers accounted for 20% of the cases worldwide [3] . With respect to seasonal influenza, Jones and Xia estimated that tens of thousands of HCWs in acute care settings in the United States are infected through occupational exposure annually [4] . Environmental surfaces in the hospital have been found to be contaminated with influenza viruses and SARS-CoV, including the hospital bed, bedside table, and television remote control [5] [6] [7] . Previous work found that patient bodies, bed surfaces, and bedside tables were among the most frequently touched surfaces by HCWs and patients [8, 9] . Thus, contact with these surfaces may put HCWs at risk of infection or of transmitting the pathogens to other susceptible patients and workers.",

All patients were hospitalized with viral respiratory infection in an acute care hospital in an academic medical center. To our knowledge, fomite contact and self-contact patterns of HCWs associated with care activities for patients with viral respiratory infections, all of whom were under transmission-based infection control precautions, have not been studied. This work can inform our understanding of infectious disease transmission pathways, support implementation of quantitative microbial risk assessment, and direct enhanced cleaning activities toward frequently touched surfaces. Furthermore, recognition of environmental contacts and self-contact by HCWs may motivate improved use of personal protective equipment (PPE) and hand hygiene, which we have found to be inadequate among HCWs at this hospital [10] .",

The median number of fomite contacts in the CDU, non-ICU, and ICU units were 10, 8, and 6, respectively; and were not statistically significantly different in pairwise tests with adjusted P values ( Figure 1 ). The median of total fomite contacts made by providers was 3, and was significantly lower than those made by nurses and nurse technicians, with median of 9 and 10 contacts, respectively (W pairwise, P < .05; Figure  2 ). In the far-patient zone, providers made significantly fewer fomite contacts than HCWs in all other job roles (W pairwise, P < .05). No differences were observed in the grand total number of fomite contacts by patient isolation category (Table 3) . Fit testing was not statistically significant for Poisson, negative binomial, or log-normal distribution, so no distribution is reported.",

We found that the patient was the most commonly touched surface, contacted in 91% of the visits, which is consistent with the work of others [8, 9, 12, 13] . Bed surfaces, bed rail, IV pole, computer station, and tray table were among the most highly touched fomites by both HCWs and patients in this study, which is consistent with the work of others [8, 9] . The median contact rate on all fomites by HCWs was 37.8 contacts per hour, which is lower than the 93.1 contacts per hour reported by Cheng et al [9] . As many of these surfaces have been found to be contaminated with respiratory viruses and multidrug-resistant bacteria [5] [6] [7] 14] , transmission via environmental surfaces is very plausible. The number of contacts by HCWs with patients and fomites and the performance of respiratory care activities have been associated with bacterial contamination on the gloves and hands of HCWs after patient care [15, 16] . This should motivate HCWs to reduced fomite contacts, improved cleaning and disinfection, and hand hygiene to reduce the potential for disease transmission.",

These results were consistent with the findings of Smith et al [13] , in which blood pressure stands and computer stations were handled in patient rooms during 13% and 26% of the HCW visits, respectively. Computer stations in the hospital we studied are permanently present in the patient room of the ICU and CDU wards, but could be portable (on wheels) in the other wards. A simulation study in a long-term care facility using a DNA marker showed that pathogens could disseminate from a television remote control to the hands of patients, to the room surfaces, and to the vital signs machine and medication cart [18] . Therefore, portable medical devices could transmit pathogens within and between patient rooms if they are not properly cleaned. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended that \"noncritical\" surfaces should be disinfected after use on each patient at the minimum [19] . At the hospital in which this study was conducted, the policy is that reusable medical equipment is disinfected between patients, but cleaning behaviors and efficacy was not observed in this study. Jinadatha et al [8] Non Self-contact could transfer infectious pathogens from HCWs' gloved or bare hands to their PPE, clothing, and skin. To our knowledge, self-contact patterns of HCWs during patient encounters have not been previously explored. In our study, providers and respiratory therapists, who often performed a physical examination and respiratory treatment, had a significantly higher number of self-contacts than HCWs with other roles. The mask and torso were the body parts most commonly touched by HCWs. Bacterial pathogens, including multidrugresistant organisms, have been found on the gloves, gown, scrubs, and hands of HCWs working in ICUs [20, 21] . Brady et al [22] found that, upon contact during doffing, filtering face piece respirators contaminated with bacteriophage and fluorescein via droplets and droplet nuclei transferred materials to hands; a similar effect can be expected for masks. Doffing of PPE ensembles used for contact-transmissible diseases has been found to result in contamination of HCWs' hands and, less commonly, faces with surrogate materials placed on the PPE to simulate contamination by pathogen-containing body fluids [23] [24] [25] . Our observations of self-contact by HCWs highlight the potential for pathogen transfer between clothing, PPE, and hands.",

            "text": "This study has several limitations. First, patient contact patterns were not fully characterized because we did not record patient contacts when a HCW was not present or when patients were in the bathroom. While we did observe that 10% of patients were walking during the HCW encounter, patients observed in bed may or may not have been mobile at other times, and we did not consider patient mobility in this analysis. Second, our findings did not take into account the activities of visitors, who have been found to touch many of the same environmental surfaces touched by HCWs and patients [9] . Third, there are some items in the far patient zone that may contact the patient or move into the near-patient zone when not observed (ie, stethoscope, pulse oximetry). Finally, this is an observational study, so it may be subject to the Hawthorne effect, in which participants change their behaviors because they know they are being observed. The impact of the Hawthorne effect, however, is likely to be small as HCWs continued to provide care as needed by patients, and during this study we observed poor compliance with the use and doffing of PPE [10] . Overall, the data obtained in this study suggest that HCWs are at risk of acquiring or transmitting contact-transmissible pathogens because they touch infected patients and multiple fomites that may be contaminated with respiratory viruses during patient care activities.",
