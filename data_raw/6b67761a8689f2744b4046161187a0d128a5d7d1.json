            "text": "Nidoviruses with large genomes (26.3-31.7 kb; 'large nidoviruses'), including Coronaviridae and Roniviridae, are the most complex positive-sense single-stranded RNA (ssRNA+) viruses. Based on genome size, they are far separated from all other ssRNA+ viruses (below 19.6 kb), including the distantly related Arteriviridae (12.7-15.7 kb; 'small nidoviruses'). Exceptionally for ssRNA+ viruses, large nidoviruses encode a 39-59exoribonuclease (ExoN) that was implicated in controlling RNA replication fidelity. Its acquisition may have given rise to the ancestor of large nidoviruses, a hypothesis for which we here provide evolutionary support using comparative genomics involving the newly discovered first insect-borne nidovirus. This Nam Dinh virus (NDiV), named after a Vietnamese province, was isolated from mosquitoes and is yet to be linked to any pathology. The genome of this enveloped 60-80 nm virus is 20,192 nt and has a nidovirus-like polycistronic organization including two large, partially overlapping open reading frames (ORF) 1a and 1b followed by several smaller 39-proximal ORFs. Peptide sequencing assigned three virion proteins to ORFs 2a, 2b, and 3, which are expressed from two 39-coterminal subgenomic RNAs. The NDiV ORF1a/ORF1b frameshifting signal and various replicative proteins were tentatively mapped to canonical positions in the nidovirus genome. They include six nidovirus-wide conserved replicase domains, as well as the ExoN and 29-O-methyltransferase that are specific to large nidoviruses. NDiV ORF1b also encodes a putative N7methyltransferase, identified in a subset of large nidoviruses, but not the uridylate-specific endonuclease that -in deviation from the current paradigm -is present exclusively in the currently known vertebrate nidoviruses. Rooted phylogenetic inference by Bayesian and Maximum Likelihood methods indicates that NDiV clusters with roniviruses and that its branch diverged from large nidoviruses early after they split from small nidoviruses. Together these characteristics identify NDiV as the prototype of a new nidovirus family and a missing link in the transition from small to large nidoviruses.",

This size range is the largest among those of the different classes of RNA viruses, although it is small compared to those of DNA viruses and cellular organisms.

            "text": "Recently, the molecular basis of the relation between RNA virus genome sizes and mutation rates has been revisited in studies of nidoviruses with large genomes (''large nidoviruses''). These viruses, with genomes of 26.3 to 31.6 kb, include the Coronaviridae and Roniviridae families and are at the upper end of the RNA virus genome size range [4] . They are uniquely separated from other ssRNA+ viruses (3.0-19.6 kb genomes), including the distantly related Arteriviridae family (12.7-15.7 kb genomes; ''small nidoviruses'') with which they form the order Nidovirales [4] [5] [6] . The order includes five major lineages of viruses that infect vertebrate and invertebrate hosts. Their complex genetic architecture includes multiple open reading frames (ORFs) that are expressed by region-specific mechanisms. The first two regions are formed by the two 59-most and partially overlapping ORFs, ORF1a and ORF1b, which are translated from the genomic RNA to produce polyproteins 1a (pp1a) and pp1ab. The expression level of ORF1b is downregulated relative to that of ORF1a by the use of the ORF1a/1b ribosomal frameshifting signal [7, 8] . Both pp1a and pp1ab are autoproteolytically processed by ORF1a-encoded proteases to yield numerous products that control genome expression and replication [9] . The third, 39-located region of the nidovirus genome includes multiple smaller ORFs (39ORFs), although the number of these ORFs varies considerably among nidoviruses. These genes are expressed from 39-coterminal subgenomic mRNAs to produce the structural proteins incorporated into the enveloped nidovirus particles and, optionally, other proteins modulating virus-host interactions [10] [11] [12] [13] . With the exception of a few nidoviruses, the subgenomic and genomic mRNAs are also 59-coterminal. A mechanism of discontinuous negative-stranded RNA synthesis, yielding the templates for subgenomic mRNA production, is thought to control this mosaic structure of nidovirus mRNAs. The synthesis of subgenome-length negative stranded RNAs is guided by short transcriptionregulating sequences (TRSs) -located in the common ''leader sequence'' (near the genomic 59 end) and in each ''mRNA body'' (upstream of the expressed ORFs) -that share a conserved core sequence and flank the genome region that is not present in the respective subgenomic mRNAs.",

It is a mosquito-borne virus with a 20.2 kilobase genome, the largest among non-segmented single-stranded RNA viruses of insects. Employing bioinformatics tools, we show that NDiV prototypes a new family and is a missing evolutionary link connecting the distantly related nidoviruses with small and large genomes, including important and diverse pathogens such as porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus (,15-kilobase genome) and SARS coronavirus (,30 kilobases), respectively. NDiV and large nidoviruses form a phylogenetic cluster and share a set of core replicative enzymes. They exclusively encode an exoribonuclease that presumably controls replication fidelity. Its acquisition may have promoted the emergence of viruses with single-stranded RNA genomes larger than ,20 kilobases. This study highlights the benefits of broad virus discovery efforts for fundamental and applied research. The Coronaviridae is split into the corona-and toro-/bafinivirus groups. Prefix Nido-and Picorna-are for Nidovirales and Picornavirales, respectively. Group specific box-whisker plots are aligned along the X-axis by their medians (bold line) normalized to zero. The box spans from the first to third quartile; the whiskers (dashed lines) are ,1.5 times the inter-quartile range; outliers are circles. Families/groups are ranked by median genome size along Y-axis. Genome size ranges are colored by semi-circles: nidoviruses (dark orange), other classified (dark grey) and unclassified viruses (light grey). Three non-overlapping zones regarding the presence of the exoribonuclease (ExoN) are highlighted in the genome size distribution (from top to bottom): ExoN-encoding large nidoviruses and NDiV (light green); in-between not-sampled size zone (white); ExoN-lacking ssRNA+ viruses (light blue). doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1002215.g001 detailed in biochemical studies [16, 17] . Likewise, and in line with the expectations, ExoN-inactivating mutations were shown to decrease RNA replication fidelity by ,15-20 fold in two coronaviruses, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), while only modestly affecting virus viability [18, 19] . These results strongly support a critical role of ExoN in the control of replication fidelity of large nidoviruses, although more mechanistic insight is clearly required before the current paradigm connecting RNA virus mutation rates and genome size control could be definitively revised to include proof-reading during the replication of large RNA genomes [20] .",

However, whether these viruses actually exist has thus far remained an open question. Three considerations suggest that if nidoviruses with intermediate-sized genomes ever evolved they may already have gone extinct. First, it is recognized that the evolution of RNA viruses is characterized by a high birthdeath rate and the extinction of numerous virus lineages, resulting in the fast turnover of species [21] . Secondly, the genome size gap between large nidoviruses and all other known ssRNA+ viruses has existed without exception since genome sequencing began in the 1980s. As of the late 1980s, this gap has been bordered by closteroviruses (from the bottom) and nidoviruses (from the top) ( Fig. 1 ). Likewise and thirdly, all nidovirus genomes sequenced to date have sizes that are similar to either IBV (27,600 nt) [22] or EAV (12,700 nt) [23] , which were the first fully sequenced coronavirus and arterivirus genomes, respectively. The evident under-representation of RNA viruses with relatively large genomes is even more striking in the light of the continuous flow of newly identified ssRNA+ viruses with smaller genome sizes [24] (Fig. 1) .",

This elusive and precious evolutionary link is an insect-borne virus with the largest ssRNA+ genome for any insect virus known to date. Comparative genome analyses involving this newly identified virus provide evolutionary evidence for the acquisition of the ExoN domain by a nidovirus (ancestor) with a genome size in the range of ,16-20 kb. This range appears to define the size limit for the expansion of ssRNA+ virus genomes, which may be achieved in evolution without the recruitment of a specialized enzyme that controls replication fidelity. Furthermore, we found that two other replicative enzymes, N7-methyltransferase (NMT) and NendoU, are not encoded by toroviruses and invertebrate nidoviruses, respectively, indicating that they may contribute ''optional activities'' for the nidovirus replication machinery. Together our results highlight the broad benefits of virus discovery efforts applied to mosquitoes.",

Most of these were attributed to JEV (24 different strains; data not shown), but for 10 specimens a routine laboratory screening for JEV and other circulating flaviviruses (such as Dengue and West Nile viruses) by RT-PCR and/or serology yielded negative results. Subsequently, infected culture fluid (ICF) from cells infected with unknown agents were analyzed by electron microscopy, which revealed an enveloped virus with a diameter of 60-80 nm (Fig. 3A) . This virus was named Nam Dinh virus (NDiV), after the geographic locality of its first apparent isolation, although this origin could not be confirmed later on. However, for historical reasons, this name was retained for all subsequent isolates, and the analysis of one of those (02VN178) is described here.

N-terminal protein sequences are indicated by (*), other peptide sequences indicate inner sequences. The actual molecular size of the ORF2a product (approximately 77 KDa in SDS-PAGE in B) is considerably shorter than the calculated size (102 KDa), suggesting that p2a may be post-translationally proteolytically processed or that its translation starts at another AUG codn in the ORF. Two pairs of conserved potential TRSs -for sg mRNAs 2 and 3, respectively -were identified in the NDiV genome and aligned (bottom-left), with each pair consisting of a putative leader TRS in the 59-UTR and a body TRS in the 39-proximal region of the genome.

The 59-UTR includes two AUG codons indicating that translation initiation for ORF1a/ORF1b is likely mediated by another mechanism than ribosomal scanning. Three pairs of ORFs (1a-1b, 2a-2b, and 3-4) overlap to variable degrees; particularly, ORF1b overlaps ORF1a in the 21 frame ( Fig. 3D ; see also below).

Although no common repeats larger than six nucleotides were identified in these four areas, we noticed the presence of two pairs of near-perfect repeats: the first pair located in the 59-UTR (nt 26-40 of the genome) and the region upstream of ORF3 (14 out of 15 residues are identical), and the second pair encompassing nt 125-137 of the 59-UTR and a sequence immediately upstream of ORF2a/2b (12 out of 13 residues are identical) (Fig. 3D ). The two pairs share from ,43 to 52% pair-wise sequence identity in an alignment containing a single gap (Fig. 3D) , and no other repeats of comparable or larger size were found in the analyzed areas. The locations and sizes of these repeats suggest they are TRS signals, although no candidate TRS was identified immediately upstream of ORF4; to our knowledge, the use of two alternative leader TRSs has not been observed in other nidoviruses thus far. These observations suggested that NDiV uses at least two subgenomic mRNAs for the expression of the 39-located ORFs and that these mRNAs have 59-terminal sequences of different size in common with the viral genome.",

We followed this approach to map potential RFS signals in the NDiV genome (Fig. 4) . The 40-nt NDiV ORF1a/ORF1b overlap region was found to have the best match (GGAUUUU) with the slippery sequence (AAAUUUU) of invertebrate roniviruses [28] , which deviates considerably from the pattern (XXXYYYZ) conserved in vertebrate nidoviruses (Fig. 4A) .

TM2 and TM3 are transmembrane domains, Zm is a Zn-cluster binding domain fused with HEL1, and 3CLpro is a 3C-like protease [4] (however see below). Since NDiV was found to be very distantly related to the other nidoviruses known to date, sequence-based functional characterization presented a considerable technical challenge. In comparative sequence analysis, profile-based methods that employ multiple sequence alignments are known to achieve the best signal-to-noise ratios [27, 33, 34] . They have been the methods of choice for establishing remote relations in biology, also in our prior studies of nidoviruses [15, [35] [36] [37] . In this study we used profile vs. sequence and profile vs. profile searches as implemented in HMMer and HHsearch, respectively, for general comparisons. To prepare profiles, we selected representatives of small and large nidoviruses, and also three subsets of large nidoviruses (coronaviruses, toro/bafiniviruses, and roniviruses). Using profile-based searches we identified counterparts (orthologs) of nidovirus-wide conserved enzymatic domains in the NDiV pp1ab. For the identification of TM2 and TM3, predictions of transmembrane helices by TMpred were used.",

Its substratebinding site is predicted to include a conserved His residue which was implicated in controlling the P1 specificity for Glu/Gln residues in other viruses, a hallmark of 3C/3CLpros [41] . Surprisingly, despite this finding, no candidate cleavage sites with the characteristic 3CLpro-specific signatures could be identified in the NDiV pp1a/1ab. Consequently, the sizes of all NDiV replicative domains described in this paper (Table 2 ) are based on the hit sizes in profile searches and are subject to future refinement. Collectively, these results strongly indicate that NDiV encodes all nidovirus-wide conserved replicase domains except for NendoU ( Figure 3D ; see also below), thus supporting the classification of NDiV as a nidovirus.",

The presence of these domains therefore discriminates large from small nidoviruses. Using profile searches in the ORF1b-encoded part of pp1ab, homologs of these two enzymes were identified in the NDiV genome (Table 2 ). Using an ExoN multiple sequence alignment of NDiV and large nidoviruses, the conserved motifs I, II, and III, including the catalytic residues (two Asp and one Glu), as well as the ExoN-specific Zn- finger module were identified in the NDiV ortholog (Fig. 5A) . Furthermore, the NDiV ExoN shows an insertion whose size and position correspond to those of the second Zn-finger-like module that is exclusively found in roniviruses. However, unlike the ronivirus domain, NDiV appears to lack His/Cys residues potentially involved in Zn-binding. According to a multiple sequence alignment of nidovirus OMTs (Fig. 5B) , the putative NDiV OMT contains motifs X, IV, VI and VIII, encompassing residues of the catalytic KDKE tetrad, as well as motif I involved in binding of the methyl donor [42] . These data imply that NDiV ORF1b encodes functional ExoN and OMT domains (Fig. 3D) , which are both typical of large nidoviruses.",

Surprisingly, however, profile searches of nidovirus NendoUs revealed no significant hits in the corresponding region of the NDiV sequence (E-values.9.5). This observation prompted us to re-examine the NendoU assignment in other nidoviruses, including the invertebrate roniviruses [15] . Using profile-sequence and profile-profile comparisons mediated by HMMer and HHsearch, respectively, NendoU counterparts were readily identified in all corona-, toro/ bafini-, and arteriviruses (E-values,10 24 ), but not in roniviruses (E-values.4.5).

Their alignment was converted into a profile with which we screened all domains of our in-house nidovirus profile database (see Materials and Methods). Remarkably, the only significant hit (E-value,10 24 ) was recorded against the coronavirus NMT profile (Table 2) . For comparison, its similarities with NendoU profiles of corona-, toro/bafini-or arteriviruses were not significant (E-value.1.5).

Based on these observations, we generated an alignment of the NMT domains of corona-and roniviruses and NDiV (Fig. 5C ) in order to search for remote cellular homologs. The N-terminal part of the nidovirus NMT includes a conserved methyl donor binding site (motif I), according to the prior assignment for coronavirus NMTs. In line with this observation, a weak hit between nidovirus NMTs and a cellular guanine N7methyltransferase involving the motif I region was detected in this study.

The phylogeny was inferred using Bayesian posterior probability trees for a concatenated alignment of three enzymes, 3CLpro, RdRp, and HEL1, that are conserved in all nidoviruses (see Materials and Methods). In line with the current nidovirus taxonomy and genomic data [28, 48, 50, 51] , this analysis consistently identified the four known major lineages (arteri-, roni-, corona-, and toro/bafiniviruses), as well as a new one represented by NDiV, as the most deeply rooted branches. Our initial attempts to resolve the relationship among the five lineages produced uncertain results. To address this challenge, we adopted a step-wise approach starting from the analysis of close intra-group relationships in the most abundantly sampled subfamily, Coronavirinae, and the family Arteriviridae, and finishing with an analysis of the most distant inter-(sub)family relationships between the five major lineages. Prior to the nidovirus-wide phylogenetic analysis, the affinity of arteri-, roni-, and toro/ bafiniviruses to the subfamily Coronavirinae was evaluated through a profile-based analysis involving conserved domains (see Supplementary Text S1 and Table S1 ). The obtained results confirmed that the strongest sequence affinity exists between corona-and toro/bafiniviruses, which was evident for the 6 out 8 domains that are conserved between coronaviruses and one or more of the other lineages. The HEL1 was the only domain for which an alternative strongest affinity -between corona-and roniviruses -was documented.",

In phylogenetic and protein domain analyses NDiV consistently, albeit relatively distantly, clustered with viruses of the family Roniviridae, which seems to make sense biologically given that both infect invertebrate hosts. Although the NDiV classification as the first insect nidovirus is beyond doubt, its characterization was only just initiated in this study. NDiV is likely to possess unique properties concerning, for example, the leaderbody junctions of its sg mRNAs and the cleavage sites recognized by its 3CLpro, which both require further characterization.",

Prior to this study, the existence of currently circulating nidoviruses with genome sizes within this gap was even highly uncertain (see Introduction). Together small and large nidoviruses cover the upper ,19 kb (,66%) of the entire ssRNA+ genome size range and are separated by ,10 kb (32%). The very existence of NDiV validates the previously established evolutionary relationship between the remotely related arteriviruses and coronaviruses that have very different genome sizes [23] . Characterization of arteri-and coronaviruses by comparative genomics has been instrumental in defining the common and unique features of members of the order Nidovirales [14] , and has guided the delineation of potential targets for antiviral drug design [54] .",

It allowed us to revise and expand the assignment for two replicative enzymes of nidoviruses -NendoU and NMT. Prior to this study, the former was considered to be a genetic marker of nidoviruses [15] . Still, its (universal) function in the replication cycle of (vertebrate) nidoviruses has remained enigmatic, despite steady progress in the biochemical, structural, and genetic characterization of this enzyme in arteri-and coronaviruses [44] [45] [46] [47] [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] [60] . Our analysis showed that invertebrate roniviruses and NDiV do not encode a NendoU domain implying that, contrary to the current paradigm, the utilization of this enzyme in replication may be restricted by the host organism. Surprisingly, and in contrast to the case of NendoU, invertebrate nidoviruses were found to encode a putative NMT, whose ortholog was previously identified in SARS-CoV and shown to be conserved in the subfamily Coronavirinae [43, 49] . Our observation indicates that certain aspect(s) of the nidovirus replicative cycle that are controlled by the NMT domain could be similar in coronaviruses and invertebrate nidoviruses, but not toro/bafiniviruses which are otherwise closer to coronaviruses. Collectively, our insights into the phyletic distribution of NendoU and NMT reveal a modularity of some of the major subunits of the replication apparatus in large nidoviruses, which must be rationalized in future mechanistic studies and taken into account in drug development efforts.",

In RNA viruses, the low fidelity of replication severely restricts the size of their genomes, which can encode only relatively simple replication complexes that, hence, suffice to support low-fidelity replication [21, 69] . This low-state trap is known as the ''Eigen paradox''. Accordingly, a transition from the ''low'' to the ''high'' state may not be accomplished by changing only one element of the triangle, e.g. improving replication fidelity, since such a change would not be compatible with the ''low'' state of the other two elements [68] [70]. The exclusive presence of ExoN in ssRNA+ viruses above 20 kb supports the logic of the Eigen paradox [68] . It also shows how the paradox could be solved with a single evolutionary advancement, the acquisition of ExoN, which may have relieved the constraints on all three elements of the triangular relationship (Fig. 7) , providing a lasting benefit to the virus lineage that acquired ExoN. This advancement may have been accompanied by an immediate fitness gain. Accordingly, the ExoN acquisition could have provided the ancestral virus with improved control over the fidelity of its replication and the mutation spectrum (quasispecies structure) of its progeny [71, 72] , which may have facilitated virus adaptation to the environment [20, 73] . Alternatively, ExoN could have been acquired in an evolutionarily neutral event. Through subsequent mutation this enzyme might have gained beneficial properties for the ancestral virus and its progeny. The functional and structural characterization of known nidoviruses and yet-to-be identified viruses in the genome size range around that of NDiV will be required to clarify this key aspect in the transition from small to large nidoviruses.",

Multiple sequence alignments represent a general tool to infer both common ancestry (orthology) of residues for several related sequences (these residues form a fully occupied alignment column) and identify insertion/deletion events (corresponding to alignment columns containing gaps in selected sequences). Multiple alignments can be converted into profiles, which are statistical models that capture the degree of conservation and the likelihood to observe a certain residue or gap in each alignment column. One type of profiles are profile Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) [93] that are particularly suitable for searching for remotely related sequences (like NDiV which presumably represents a new virus family) in a probabilistic framework. They are implemented, for example, in the programs HMMer and HHsearch which were utilized in this study. A profile HMM can be compared to other HMMs or used to search for motifs in a single sequence. Due to the high degree of divergence of nidovirus sequences, we used alignments of amino acid sequences and profiles derived from these alignments to probe relation between proteins in this study.",

Bayesian posterior probability trees were compiled utilizing BEAST [95] under the WAG amino acid substitution matrix [96] using Tracer [97] to verify convergence. For the nidovirus-wide analysis, whose sampling is detailed Table S3 , we used a concatenated alignment of 3CLpro, RdRp, and HEL1 including 910 aa positions and its derivative of 604 aa positions, from which least conserved columns were removed. In this analysis, the uncorrelated relaxed molecular clock approach (lognormal distribution) [98] was used as it was favored [99] over the strict molecular clock (log 10 Bayes factor of 13.6) and equal to the relaxed molecular clock approach with exponential distribution (log 10 Bayes Factor of 0.0). Selected internal nodes were fixed using results of separate analyses of subsets of nidoviruses. For phylogenetic analysis of the subfamily Coronavirinae and the family Arteriviridae, we used respective datasets incorporating between one and three sequences per species and including concatenated alignments of ORF1ab domains that are conserved in each of these groups. The datasets included 35 and 10 sequences for corona-and arteriviruses and consisted of 2302and 2882-aa alignment positions, respectively. The topologies of these trees closely follow those published [51] . They were used to fix internal nodes in corona-and arterivirus clusters in the subsequent nidovirus-wide phylogenetic analysis. The exception was the basal nodes corresponding to the grouping of the Alpha-, Beta-, and Gammacoronavirus genera and the root of arteriviruses (EAV or SHFV), which were left unfixed. Maximum Likelihood trees were compiled utilizing the PhyML software [100] . The WAG amino acid substitution matrix and rate heterogeneity among sites (8 categories) were applied and support values for internal nodes were obtained using the non-parametric bootstrap method with 1000 replicates. Trees were rooted using domain-specific outgroups: for RdRp, three picornavirus representatives (accession numbers: NC_001489, NC_001897, NC_002058); for HEL1, four rubi-/ tetra-/ hepevirus representatives (NC_001545, NC_001990, NC_ 005898, NC_001434).",

These groups consist of thousands of viruses that are believed to have emerged from a common ancestor, implying that they are not independent. Their dependence varies in virus pairs but, generally, for each virus pair is inversely proportional to the pair-wise evolutionary distance. To account for the dependence of these sequences in our test is technically challenging. To circumvent this problem, we have created a derivative of the virus dataset in which each virus family/group is represented by a single virus, in total 43 viruses. We considered the sequences of these representatives to be essentially independent due to the (extremely) large divergence that is observed, even in the most conserved genes (e.g. see Fig. 6 ), the lack of recognizable similarity in other genes, and the accompanied gene loss and gain.",

The final probability of the test is the product of the binomial probabilities for the two groups. We used a binomial success probability of 4/43 since four out of the 43 ssRNA+ virus lineages (NDiV, toro-/bafiniviruses, coronaviruses, and roniviruses) employ ExoN. The test was applied to each possible threshold separating two unique ssRNA+ genome sizes, in total -42 thresholds. The threshold of ,20 kb, between the genome sizes of NDiV and closteroviruses, gave the lowest probability to observe the ExoN association by chance. We consider the obtained value (10 26 ) as an underestimate of the true probability that should be calculated by taking into account the sequence dependence and all viruses in the 43 groups, which without exception conform to the ExoN distribution observed in the selected virus representatives used now. Figure S1 Cloning and sequencing details. (A) To obtain RT-PCR products containing unknown NDiV sequences upstream of the previously sequenced region of the genome the following was done: cDNAs of the NDiV RNA were converted into ds cDNAs, which were digested by restriction enzymes and subsequently ligated to an anchor DNA using those existing restriction sites. For a detailed explanation of each procedure please read the ''Genome cloning and sequencing'' section of Materials and Methods. (B) Semi-nested PCR was conducted for the anchored ds cDNA of NDiV using one pUC19 specific sense primer (primer pUC119-scaI208 was used for the ScaI-digested sample and primer pUC19-EcoRI227 was used for the samples digested with all the other restriction enzymes) and two reverse gene-specific primers (GSPs) of NDiV for each experiment. The PCR products contained the unknown sequence between GSP and anchor. This process was repeated eight times, and this protocol allowed us to read a total of 7164 bp. The name of each restriction enzyme is followed by its position written in brackets as explained below. NDiV-RACE117-99R1.NDiV-RACE74-54R2 means ''primer for first PCR.primer for nested PCR''. 878 bp.836 bp means ''size of the first PCR.size for the nested PCR''. If 1, 2, or 3 asterisks are in brackets, non-specific cuts took place with the following details: (*) non-specific cut and ligation occurred at 4433 bp; (**) non-specific anchoring at 513 bp; (***) In the eighth step, anchor DNA of BamHI and HindIII attached to same location, and it was suggested that reverse transcription stopped there. The GeneRacer (TM) Kit (Invitrogen) was used to read the remaining 205 bp toward the 59-end of genomic RNA. (PDF) Figure S2 Hydrophobicity plots and secondary structure predictions for (presumed) NDiV structural proteins. Hydrophobicity was calculated using TMpred for the pp1a replicase precursor (ORF1a; A) that served as a control for four (putative) virion proteins p2a (ORF2a; B), p2b (ORF2b; C), p3 (ORF3; D) and p4 (ORF4; E). Horizontal dashed lines depict the threshold (value of 500) for significant association with transmembrane helices. On top of the plots for the structural proteins, Jpredmediated secondary structure predictions are shown. Predicted alpha helices and beta strands are highlighted in red and green, respectively. (PDF) Figure S3 Association of ExoN with large nidovirus genomes and progress in nidovirus genomics. At the X axis, a timeline of nidovirus genome sequencing is plotted. It starts in 1991 when the first pair of genome sequences for both small and large nidoviruses, arterivirus (EAV) and coronavirus (IBV), respectively, became available. The genome size difference (gap) between these viruses was ,14.9 kb. All subsequent time points were selected because new nidoviruses with either larger (for small nidoviruses) or smaller (for large nidoviruses) genomes were released in these years. (For the purpose of this analysis, NDiV was treated as a large nidovirus). As a result, the genome size gap shrunk, in total six times since 1991 (three times in 1993). Currently, the gap that remains is ,4.5 kb (the arterivirus SHFV vs. NDiV). Large nidoviruses are assumed to have acquired a unique genomic region during the expansion of their genome. It includes ExoN and OMT, and some other genes, like the NMT that is found in some large nidoviruses. This region may also include additional domains, due to the thus far incomplete characterization of the nidovirus proteome; they might include one or more with the phyletic distribution characteristic of ExoN and OMT. Understandably, as the genome size gap between large and small nidoviruses has been shrinking due to the discovery of new nidoviruses, the probability that such genes exist is decreasing. Likewise, the share of the size of the ExoN and OMT domains in the total genome size gap could be considered a measure of confidence for the role of these genes in nidovirus genome expansion. At the Y axis, the growth of this share is plotted; it gradually increased from ,12% in 1991 (EAV vs. IBV) to ,35% in 2011 (SHFV vs. NDiV). By far the biggest increase (,17%), and hence the largest gain in support for the role of ExoN in nidovirus genome expansion, was achieved by the sequence analysis of the NDiV genome. The above numbers outline a trend and this analysis should not be confused with a probabilistic framework. (PDF) Text S1 Sequence similarity-based clustering of coronaand toroviruses.",
