The objective of our study was to identify suitable reference genes for mRNA expression analysis in chicken embryonic fibroblasts (CEF) after infection with avian leukosis virus subgroup J (ALV-J). Findings: The expression levels of 11 potential reference genes in CEF infected with ALV-J were determined by real-time PCR. The expression stability of these genes were analyzed and ranked using the geNorm tool. Analysis indicated that the genes RPL30 (ribosomal protein L30) and SDHA (succinate dehydrogenase complex, subunit A) were the most stably expressed genes in the ALV-J infected CEF. Conclusions: The RPL30 and SDHA were deemed suitable for use as reference genes for real-time PCR analysis of mRNA gene expression during ALV-J infection, whereas commonly used ACTB and GAPDH are unsuitable to be reference genes.",

            "text": "Avian leukosis virus subgroup J (ALV-J) is an avian oncogenic retrovirus that induces myeloid leukosis in poultry, a disease that causes significant economic losses in the broiler breeder industry worldwide. Disease severity of ALV-J is linked to an increase incidence of tumor formation, immunosuppression, with ensuing high mortality rates [1] . To elucidate the molecular pathogenesis of ALV-J infection and tumor development, many studies have focused on analyzing host gene expression profiles following ALV-J infection [2] [3] [4] . Assessment of mRNA expression levels via real-time PCR has been a standard approach with high accuracy, sensitivity and reproducibility, and thus it has been widely used to infer host gene expression in response to virus infection [5] . To ensure a reliable result in gene expression analysis, the selection of stably expressed reference gene (or genes) is an important technical prerequisite for each individual experimental setting [6] . This is especially important because even the expression stability of candidate reference housekeeping genes varies across host tissue cells, and virus strains [7, 8] . Therefore, the selection of reference genes should ideally be determined for each specific cell type and virus. Chicken embryonic fibroblasts (CEF) are frequently used for propagation of ALV-J. Those fibroblasts have also been used as model cells for the study of host-virus interaction. To identify suitable reference genes for mRNA analysis in poultry, here we present the expression stability of 11 housekeeping genes in CEF after ALV-J infection, and propose stably expressed genes for use as reference genes in ALV-J/CEF settings.",

The use of \"reference genes\" as markers of stability has served to normalize variations arisen from differences in nucleic acid integrity, the efficiency of the reverse transcription, and the amount of sample loaded onto a PCR master mix. An ideal reference gene should be one which is stably expressed in cells and unaffected by the experimental treatments.",

Therefore, it is reasonable to think that the expression of socalled \"housekeeping\" genes is probably unstable in virus-infected cells, and that it depends on the virus and host cell types. This highlights the necessity of reference gene selection during real-time PCR analysis for virus-infected cells. Radoni\u0107 et al. [7] compared the expression of 10 candidate reference genes in cell lines infected with 6 human viruses: cytomegalovirus, human herpesvirus-6, camelpox virus, SARS coronavirus or yellow fever virus, and found that a commonly used gene ACTB, is unsuitable as reference gene, whereas TATA-Box binding protein (TBP) and peptidyl-prolyl-isomerase A (PPI) were stable genes for use as reference genes in expression studies in virus infected cells. However, Yin et al. [9] found that ACTB is a stable reference gene in CEF infected with Newcastle disease virus (NDV). Li et al. [10] , after comparing 6 housekeeping genes, also showed that ACTB is the most stably expressed gene in infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) infected CEF. Our previous study [11] with CEF infected with H5N1 avian influenza virus demonstrated that ACTB and RPL4 were the most suitable genes for use as endogenous reference genes in avian influenza virus H5N1/CEF settings. In the study carried out by Waston et al. [8] , PPIA (peptidylprolyl isomerase A), GAPDH and SDHA were recommended as the best reference genes for host gene expression analysis in cells infection with immunodeficiency virus and herpes viruses.",
