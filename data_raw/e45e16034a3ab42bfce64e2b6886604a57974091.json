In total 233 phosphoproteins were identified and 72 phosphoproteins showed a 1.5-fold or greater change upon bortezomib treatment. The phosphoproteins with expression alterations encompass all major protein classes, including a large number of nucleic acid binding proteins. Site-specific phosphopeptide quantitation revealed that Ser38 phosphorylation on stathmin increased upon bortezomib treatment, suggesting new mechanisms associated to bortezomib-induced apoptosis in MM cells. Further studies demonstrated that stathmin phosphorylation profile was modified in response to bortezomib treatment and the regulation of stathmin by phosphorylation at specific Ser/Thr residues participated in the cellular response induced by bortezomib.",

            "text": "Elucidation of cellular signaling networks requires methodologies for large-scale quantitative phosphoproteomic analysis that can reveal dynamic system-wide changes in protein phosphorylation. Recent technological advances in mass spectrometry-based proteomics have enabled us to make a large-scale identification of signaling molecules through the enrichment of phosphorylated proteins or peptides [12, 13] . One of the most widely used and well known strategies currently used in phosphoproteomic studies is stable-isotope labelling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC). Although introduced relatively recently, SILAC has been used extensively in the proteomics community [14] . With SILAC, the entire proteome of a given cell population is metabolically labeled by heavy, non-radioactive isotopic variants of amino acids, thus making it distinguishable by MS analysis [15, 16] . Thereafter, two or more distinctly SILAC-labeled cell populations can be mixed and analyzed in one MS experiment, allowing accurate quantization of proteins from the different cellular states. By coupling with a phosphoprotein or phosphopeptide enrichment method, such as titanium dioxide (TiO 2 ) [17] , strong cation exchange (SCX) [18] , or the two in combination [19] , SILAC has been widely applied to profile dynamic phosphorylation changes in signal transduction [20, 21] .",

The workflow is outlined in Figure 1 . Cells in normal medium (light culture) were treated with bortezomib, and cells grown in medium containing stable isotopes (heavy culture) were treated with vehicle. These two populations of cells were lysed, mixed at a 1:1 ratio, and subjected to TiO 2 purifications followed by LC-MS/MS analysis. After LC-MS/MS analysis on the enriched phosphopeptides, all MS/MS spectra were searched, respectively, against the forward and reversed human protein sequence databases to estimate rates of false-positive matches. Search results were filtered based on peptide score of MASCOT and PTM score. In total 1024 phosphopeptides (redundant) from the target database passed our criteria, allowing 14 decoy matches. The phosphopeptide false-positive rate was therefore estimated to be 1.4%. Multiple filtering criteria were established to validate search results. For each of the phosphorylated peptides identified in this work, peptide sequences were manually confirmed. After validation we identified 418 unique phosphorylation sites from 244 unique phosphopeptides corresponding to 233 protein groups. This entire dataset is provided as Table S1 in which hyperlinks are built up to view all the MS/MS spectra. Using the PTM score, we could localize the phosphor groups with high confidence (Class I phosphorylation sites) in 197 cases (Table S1), indicating that the phosphorylation sites detected by current strategy are of high confidence. Figure 2A shows a representative MS/MS spectrum for a phosphosite-containing peptide in the detection, and all other MS/MS spectra are available via the hyperlinks in the Table S1 .",

These proteins are implicated in a broad range of cellular activities (Fig. 3A ). Next to the unclassified proteins (17%), proteins involved in nucleic acid binding account for the second largest portion (14%). There are also a significant number of proteins involved in receptor (10%), regulatory molecule (6%), and kinase (5%). Previous studies indicated that bortezomib exerts its anticancer function by inhibiting protein degradation in cancer cells [22] . In this connection, many bortezomib-regulated phosphoproteins found in current study were nucleic acid binding (14%) and transcription factors (4%), as shown in Figure 3A . These data suggest that the cancer-inhibitory effect of bortezomib may also rely on its regulatory role in mRNA transcription. Table S2 only shows a list of all borterzomib regulated phosphoproteins in MM cells. It lacks the biochemical context. To create significance out of otherwise static proteomic data, we constructed an interaction networking of the DEPPs (Fig. 3B) . The DEPPs were linked by various evidences based on neighborhood analysis, experimental results or text-mining. These relationships are color coded, and the legends are provided next to the map. This does not mean that all the interactions took place within a single spatial and temporal situation, but it enables the identification of central nodes in these DEPPs. Notably, stathmin was a hub in this network, suggesting that stathmin may play an important role in mediating bortezomib-induced apoptosis in MM cells. Some proteins remained orphans because there is insufficient information in the database to link them to other proteins in the network.",

A total of 72 phosphoproteins were found to have a 1.5-fold or greater change upon bortezomib treatment (Table S2 ). According to their change pattern, these DEPPs can be categorized into up-(,0.75) or down-(.1.5) regulated groups (Table S2) . Notably, in comparison with the number of downregulated DEPPs, many more proteins are up-regulated in this process (70 versus 5). This unbalanced pattern has also been revealed by previous in vitro biochemical studies [22] . Many studies have demonstrated that bortezomib can trigger pleiotropic signaling pathways and suppress the proteasomal degradation of multiple phosphorylated singnaling molecules [8, 10, 31] . Therefore, we speculate that the up-regulation of phosporylation of these DEPPs may constitute one of the mechanisms of bortezomibinduced apoptosis in MM cells. The PANTHER classification system also revealed that the DEPPs implicated in a variety of molecular functions, such as nucleic acid binding, receptor, regulatory molecule and so on (Fig. 3A) , clearly showing that in addition to targeting proteins involved in apoptotic pathways, bortezomib also altered multiple signaling pathways to induce its anti-cancer effects.",

For example, phosphorylations at all four Ser residues fluctuate during the cell cycle and CDK2 has been identified as the kinase system involved in cell cycle-regulated phosphorylation of Ser38. Besides, three distinct protein kinases have been identified to phosphorylate stathmin in response to external signals. These kinases are members of the MAPK family that phosphorylates Ser25, cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) that phosphorylates Ser63 and CamKII that phosphorylates Ser16 [26] . Because the kinases acting at these residues are distinct and may be functioning through different pathways, it is reasonable to speculate that regulation of stathmin phosphorylation can be achieved by multiple pathways, thus providing the cell with a finely tunable mechanism for controlling microtubule assembly and dynamics in relation to its needs.",

Overexpression of WT stathmin significantly increased bortezomib-induced cell death. On the contrary, overexpression of the phosphorylation site-deficient stathmin mutants S16A, S25A and S38A significantly decreased, but did not block, bortezomibinduced cell death. Importantly, increased levels of tubulin polymerization were observed upon bortezomib treatment in cells overexpressing WT or mutant stathmin, but to a lesser extent than parental U266 cells (Fig. 5C, Table 1 ). There are several possible explanations as to why bortezomib-induced cell death is not completely blocked by the stathmin mutants. First, endogenous WT stathmin is still present, and thus the mutant protein has to compete with the WT protein. Second, bortezomib can also modulate the activity of other MT regulatory proteins that may also contribute to the cell death [29] . Furthermore, the MT system is not the only event involved in bortezomib-induced cell death in myeloma cells [22, 31] . This suggests that bortezomibinduced cell death is the result of a concerted series of events.",

In the current study, BAG3 was found to have increased phosphorylation at Ser377 upon bortezomib treatment. BAG3 belongs to the evolutionarily conserved BAG family of proteins that were originally isolated based on their ability to interact with the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 [35, 36] . It is involved in a wide variety of cellular processes, including cell survival, cellular stress response, apoptosis and virus replication [16, 37, 38] . Recent evidence implicates an additional function of BAG3 in the regulation of the autophagy pathway. These findings indicate that autophagosome formation and turnover may depend on BAG3 and that BAG3 can stimulate autophagy processes [39, 40] . Autophagy is a major intracellular degradation system. Unlike the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), autophagy is mainly responsible for the degradation of long-lived proteins and subcellular organelles [41, 42] . Autophagy plays important roles in development, cellular homeostasis and cell survival and is frequently activated in tumor cells exposed to chemotherapy or radiation and confers therapeutic resistance [43, 44] . The UPS and autophagy have been viewed as distinct degradation systems, but recent studies suggested that they are functionally coupled and that suppression of the proteasome promotes autophagy [45, 46] . However, the functional connection and the inter-regulation between the two systems are not well understood.",

Then, each fraction peptide was respectively loaded onto a C18 column (100 mm i.d., 10 cm long, 5 mm resin from Michrom Bioresources, Auburn, CA) using an autosampler.

The general mass spectrometric conditions were: spray voltage, 1.80 kV; no sheath and auxiliary gas flow; ion transfer tube temperature, 200uC. Ion selection thresholds were: 1000 counts for MS 2 and 500 counts for MS 3 . An activation q = 0.25 and activation time of 30 ms were applied in MS 2 acquisitions. The mass spectrometers were operated in positive ion mode, employing a data-dependent automatic switch between MS and MS 2 acquisition modes. For each cycle, one full MS scan in the Orbitrap at 1610 6 AGC target was followed by five MS 2 in the LTQ at 5000 AGC target on the five most intense ions. Selected ions were excluded from further selection for 90 s. Maximum ion accumulation time was 500 ms for full MS scans and 100 ms for MS 2 scans. All MS/MS spectra were collected using normalized collision energy (a setting of 35%), an isolation window of 3 m/z, and 1 micro-scan. The resolution used in the MS step in the Orbitrap is 60000. An extra DDNL (data-dependent neutral loss) MS 3 method was applied for phosphopeptide detection [17] . MS 3 was triggered if a neutral loss peak at 298.0, 249.0, 232.7 or 224.5 Da was observed in the MS 2 and that peak was one of the three most intense ions of the MS 2 spectra.

The following search criteria were employed: full tryptic specificity was required; two missed cleavages were allowed; Carbamido-methylation was set as fixed modification, whereas Oxidation (M), Phospho (ST), and Phospho (Y) were considered as variable modifications. Precursor ion mass tolerances were 10 ppm for all MS acquired in the Orbitrap mass analyzer, fragment ion mass tolerance was 0.5 Da for all MS 2 spectra acquired in the LTQ. Mass spectra of identified phosphopeptides with peptide score .10 were further processed and validated with the MSQuant 1.5 software for post-translational modification (PTM) score analysis [48] . Two filters criteria for phosphopeptide identification were applied: 1) Peptide score threshold was 17; 2) The total threshold of PTM score and peptide score was 36.

For phosphopeptides with multiple potential phosphorylation sites, the probabilities for phosphorylation at each site were calculated from the PTM scores as described [48] . Phosphorylation sites that were occupied with probability .0.75 were reported as class I phosphorylation sites. For class II sites, localization probability was between 0.75 and 0.25.

To separate polymerized (P) from soluble (S) tubulin, the cells were all incubated at 37uC for 5 min in the dark in hypotonic lysis buffer containing 5 mM paclitaxel, 10 mM Trichostatin-A (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA), 1 mM MgCl2, 2 mM EGTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 200 units/ml aprotinin, 100 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 5.0 mM e-amino caproic acid, 1 mM benzamidine, and 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, vortexed vigorously and centrifuged at ,15,000 g at 22uC for 10 minutes. The supernatants containing soluble 'S' tubulin were transferred to another Eppendorf tube separating them from the pellets containing polymerized 'P' tubulin. Upon separation, tubes were placed on ice and pellets of polymerized 'P' tubulin were resuspended by sonication for 10-20 seconds in a volume of lysis buffer equal to the soluble 'S' fraction. Each had gel sample buffer added, equal aliquots were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, and western blots using anti-a-tubulin antibody were obtained. The immunoblots were scanned, and densitometric analysis was performed using the public domain NIH Image program ImageJ (available on the Internet at http://rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image/). The percentage of polymerized 'P' tubulin was determined by dividing the densitometry value of polymerized 'P' tubulin by the total tubulin content (the sum of the densitometry values of soluble 'S' and polymerized 'P' tubulin). An advantage of this assay is that the amount of total protein loaded for each sample is irrelevant since the 'P' and 'S' fractions are equalized for each pair, and it is the proportion of the polymerized to the soluble tubulin fraction that is measured.",
