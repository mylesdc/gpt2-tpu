            "text": "Rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) is the causative agent of rabbit hemorrhagic disease (RHD). RHD, characterized by hemorrhaging, liver necrosis, and high morbidity and mortality in rabbits and hares, causes severe economic losses in the rabbit industry worldwide. Due to the lack of an efficient in-vitro propagation system for RHDV, the current vaccine is produced via chemical inactivation of crude RHDV preparation derived from the livers of infected rabbits. Inactivated vaccines are effective for controlling RHD, but the potential problems of biosafety and animal welfare have negative effects on the application of inactivated vaccines. In this study, an oral Lactobacillus casei (L. casei) vaccine was used as an antigen delivery system to express RHDV capsid protein VP60(VP1)-eGFP fusion protein. The expression of the recombinant protein was confirmed via western blotting and immunofluorescence (IFA). Our results indicate that oral administration of this probiotic vaccine can stimulate secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA)-based mucosal and IgG-based humoral immune responses in rabbits. The immunized rabbits were completely protected against challenge with RHDV. Our findings indicate that the L. casei expression system is a new strategy for the development of a safe and efficient vaccine against RHDV.",

            "text": "Rabbit hemorrhagic disease (RHD), characterized by severe necrotizing hepatitis and disseminated intravascular coagulation in the liver, spleen, kidney and other solid organs, is a highly contagious and lethal infection in rabbits [1, 2] . RHD is peracute and often lethal hepatitis caused by the rabbit caliciviruses Lagovirus europaeus GI.1 (previously called rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus-RHDV) and Lagovirus europaeus GI.2 (previously called RHDV2 or RHDVb) [1, 3, 4] . This disease was first reported in China in 1984, and has, since, spread rapidly around the world in less than 10 years, causing considerable economic losses in the rabbit industry and impacting the ecology of wild rabbit populations [1, 2, 5, 6] . In 1989, OIE designated this illness as a viral hemorrhagic disease and added it to List B of the International Animal Health Code [7] . Subsequently, a novel lagovirus, GI.2, emerged in France in 2010 [4] . GI.2 is now endemic in Europe and Australia, and appears to be replacing GI.1 strains in these regions [8] [9] [10] . RHDV (rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus) is the etiologic factor of RHD. RHDV is a calicivirus in the genus Lagovirus, family Caliciviridae [1] . RHDV is a non-enveloped icosahedral virus possessing a single-stranded positive sense RNA genome that is approximately 7.4 kb in length [2, 11] . The genome comprises a 5 untranslated region (UTR), a 3 UTR, and two overlapping open reading frames (ORFs): ORF1 and ORF2. ORF1 encodes a polyprotein that is cleaved by the viral protease into seven nonstructural proteins (NSP1-7) and a major structural capsid protein VP60 (presently VP1) at its C-terminus. VP10 (presently VP2) is a minor structural protein that is encoded by ORF2 [11] [12] [13] .",

Inactivated vaccines against RHDV were introduced in the early 1990s, improving the survival of rabbits on rabbit farms [7, 14] . However, RHDV inactivated vaccines are manufactured using the livers of rabbits infected with RHDV. This is because RHDV cannot grow in any continuous cell lines. Therefore, biological risks, animal-welfare concerns, and high costs are the major bottleneck problems in the production and usage of tissue-inactivated vaccines [2] .",

            "text": "RHDV spreads mainly through the upper respiratory and digestive tracts. The initial steps leading to RHDV infection take place on mucosal surfaces [15, 16] . It is generally believed that mucosal immunization is an effective approach for preventing systemic infection by pathogens present on mucosal surfaces [17] . The gastrointestinal (GI) tract is the largest mucosal surface accessible via oral administration [18] . Oral vaccination can trigger a response involving neutralizing mucosal antibodies (IgA) and cell-mediated immunity, and does not interfere with IgG-based responses [19] [20] [21] [22] . Additionally, oral vaccines show better safety and compliance profiles, and are simpler to manufacture and administer, than traditional injectable preparations [23, 24] . However, the delivery of antigens for oral vaccination of the GI tract is hindered by multiple physicochemical and biological barriers; antigens can be subjected to early disintegration and advanced degradation by low pH and proteases present in the GI tract [25, 26] . L. casei is a probiotic that is well known for its health-promoting properties, such as maintaining homeostasis and suppressing pathogens in humans and animals [27] . L. casei has shown a good safety profile, can colonize the intestine, and exerts a nonspecific immunoadjuvant effect. For those reasons, oral vaccines using L. casei as a delivery system for pathogenic antigens have garnered much interest in vaccine development [27] [28] [29] . Currently, there is increasing interest in the development of L. casei oral vaccines, and this approach is significant for the effective induction of a mucosal immune response [30] . The results to date have been confirmed that the safety and the effectiveness of L. casei were used as the oral vaccine vehicle, which were extensively used in protecting individuals against a variety of pathogens [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] .",

Starting at day 7 after primary vaccination, a significantly increased level of anti-VP60(VP1)-specific IgG was detected in rabbits orally administered with pPG-eGFP-VP60/LC393, and in those injected with the inactivated vaccine, compared with the responses of the PBS-treated control group (p < 0.01).

Rabbits inoculated with a sufficient amount of recombinant VP60(VP1) are fully protected from wild-type RHDV, and VP60 is commonly used to develop recombinant engineered vaccines against RHDV [41, 42] . Therefore, VP60(VP1) was selected as an immunogen for the development of a recombinant engineered vaccine in this study. Recombinant engineered vaccines containing VP60(VP1) have been developed using bacteria, yeasts, plants, poxvirus-based vectors, and insect cells as delivery vectors [41, [43] [44] [45] . However, intramuscular injection, which is the main route of administering these recombinant engineered vaccines, requires trained personnel, generates a vast amount of biohazardous waste, and can elicit a stress response in the animals [18, 46] . These issues can be readily solved by live vector-based oral vaccines [18] .",

            "text": "The main disadvantage of traditional plasmid expression systems is using antibiotic resistance genes as selective markers for genetically engineered bacteria [53, 54] . Although antibiotics are helpful for vector screening, using antibiotic resistance genes in practice can impact biosafety, contribute to antibiotic resistance, and present potential hazards to health and the environment [55] . To avoid potential issues caused by antibiotic resistance markers, it is important to establish expression vectors without the use of antibiotic resistance genes. eGFP has many advantages as a genetic marker and reporter gene. eGFP expression is mostly non-toxic to cells, and eGFP fluorescence can last for an extended time [55] . In the present study, we constructed a recombinant L. casei pPG-T7g10-eGFP-VP60/LC393 using eGFP as a selection marker and removed chloramphenicol resistance from the vector. Analysis of inherited stability of pPG-T7g10-eGFP-VP60/LC393 demonstrated that recombinant L. casei was stably inherited for more than 40 generations with no gene deletion. We designed the pPG-T7g10-PPT expression vector, a constitutive cell-surface expressed plasmid, to construct recombinant L. casei for the delivery of vaccine antigen. The pPG-T7g10-PPT vector contained a T7g10 enhancer, derived from gene 10 of bacteriophage T7; the T7g10 enhancer can augment protein translation and expression [56] . Expression of the eGFP-VP60(VP1) fusion protein was confirmed via western blotting and IFA. Our results indicate that a genetically engineered oral vaccine against RDHV, using L. casei without antibiotic resistance gene, was developed successfully.",

            "text": "An effective oral vaccine should induce both systemic and mucosal immune responses. Thus, we evaluated the immunogenicity of orally administered pPG-eGFP-VP60/LC393 in rabbits. The multiple immunization procedure of recombinant Lactobacillus was employed in this study was due to the amounts of recombinant Lactobacillus adhered to the intestinal mucosa were decreased with the time [57] . The immune effect of the multiple immunization procedure of recombinant Lactobacillus has been confirmed in the previous studies [31, 35] . The rabbits were immunized with inactivated vaccine according to the instruction. Serum-derived IgG can appreciably contribute to immune defense by reducing the ability of pathogens to cross intestinal mucosa, thereby limiting the systemic spread of invasive organisms [58] . We detected substantially increased levels of anti-RHDV IgG in rabbits orally immunized with pPG-eGFP-VP60/LC393; these levels increased rapidly following booster immunization. sIgA, a major immunoglobulin in mucosal immune responses, protects against pathogen invasion at mucosal sites [59] . Therefore, sIgA levels can be used to evaluate the protective efficacy of vaccines [60] . In the present study, we detected high levels of antigen-specific mucosal sIgA in the nasal washes, vaginal lotions, tears, and feces of rabbits orally immunized with pPG-eGFP-VP60/LC393. Recombinant L. casei pPG-eGFP-VP60/LC393 induced a higher level of sIgA compared with that induced by the inactivated virus vaccine, indicating that L. casei pPG-eGFP-VP60/LC393 was more efficient at eliciting mucosal immune responses, and there were almost no significant differences of sIgA and IgG antibody levels in the experimental animals administered with pPG/L. casei 393 and PBS, which have been confirmed in our previous studies [31, 35, 51] . Previous studies also have shown that oral vaccines elicit stronger mucosal immune responses than do injected vaccines [46] . In our present study, we have shown that oral vaccination with recombinant L. casei pPG-eGFP-VP60/LC393 can strongly induce anti-RHDV systemic and mucosal immune responses.",

Our results show that survival rates of rabbits vaccinated with recombinant L. casei and inactivated virus vaccine were at 100% after the viral challenge; however, none of the rabbits in the PBS-treated group survived challenge with RHDV. This finding indicates that pPG-eGFP-VP60/LC393, administered via oral immunization, effectively induced a sufficient immune response to protect rabbits against infection with RHDV. Rabbits infected with RDHV often develop acute necrotizing hepatitis and disseminated intravascular coagulation in the liver, spleen, kidney, and other solid organs [1] . Histopathological analysis showed topical histopathological changes in RDH of the liver and spleen of the PBS-treated group after challenge with RHDV. However, these changes were not observed in the organs of rabbits immunized with recombinant L. casei pPG-eGFP-VP60/LC393 or inactivated virus vaccine. The villi of the small intestine were necrotic and severely desquamated in the PBS-treated group and the group treated with inactivated virus vaccine. The group administered L. casei pPG-eGFP-VP60/LC393 showed the intact structure of the villi in the small intestine. This finding indicates that L. casei protected the intestinal environment against the effects of RHDV.",
