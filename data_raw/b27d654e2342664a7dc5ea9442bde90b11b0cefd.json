One extract (Aspalathus linearis (Burm.f.) R.Dahlgren) was also tested for its effect on the loss of transepithelial resistance (TER) of Caco-2 cells caused by simian rotavirus (SA-11) infection. Results: Aqueous extracts of Nelumbo nucifera Gaertn. fruit, Urtica dioica L. root, Aspalathus linearis (Burm.f.) R. Dahlgren leaves, Glycyrrhiza glabra L. root and Olea europaea L. leaves were found to have strong significant antiviral activity with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) < 300 \u03bcg/ml. The pure compound 18\u00df-glycyrrhetinic acid from Glycyrrhiza glabra was found to have the strongest antiviral activity (IC50 46 \u03bcM), followed by luteolin and vitexin from Aspalathus linearis (IC50 respectively 116 \u03bcM and 129 \u03bcM) and apigenin-7-O-glucoside from Melissa officinalis (IC50 150 \u03bcM).

            "text": "Rotavirus is still one of the leading causes of severe dehydrating diarrhea in children under the age of five and causes the deaths of 453,000 children younger than 5 years annually [1] . Rotaviruses, belonging to a genus of double-stranded RNA viruses in the family Reoviridae, infect the mature villous epithelial cells of the small intestine, often leading to fever, vomiting, and diarrhea in children. For the treatment of rotavirus gastroenteritis, intravenous fluid administration has been used successfully in treating only the direct consequences of the dehydration from diarrhea. Gastrogard-R W is a prophylactic treatment of 'at risk' children aged one month to three years to prevent diarrhea due to rotavirus infection and the efficacy of treatment was established in a clinical trial in children aged 3 to 15 months [2] . Gastrogard-R W is prepared from the colostrum of hyperimmunised cows and contains immunoglobulins against serotypes G1 and G3 of the human rotavirus. We have demonstrated in an in vivo rotavirus infection mouse model that Gastrogard-R W is able to completely inhibit rotavirus-induced diarrhea in suckling mice [3] . A first generation of licensed rotavirus vaccine was withdrawn from the market a year after introduction due to a possible correlation between vaccine application and the occurrence of intussusceptions [4] . Two live-attenuated vaccines have been licensed recently and have so far proven safe and highly efficacious in developed countries. In developing countries, clinical trials are being undertaken and early results found that the vaccine significantly reduces severe diarrhea episodes due to rotavirus (48.3% for Asia and 30.2% for Africa) [5] . However, rotavirus vaccines are expensive and may not be affordable for the developing world at present, compromising full vaccine coverage. This has reinforced the need to develop alternative approaches to control rotavirus disease. Natural compounds have been identified as ideal candidates for antiviral drugs because they are cheaper and effective [6] . To date, many natural compounds have known antirotavirus effects in clinical studies [7] [8] [9] , in animal experiments [10] and in vitro [11] [12] [13] [14] . In the current study we investigated 150 edible plant extracts and some of their natural compounds for in vitro anti-rotavirus infection effects.",

Trypsin usually is added during infection of MA104 cells with rotavirus to increase the infectivity [16] [17] [18] . Intestinal epithelial permeability studies are often performed with human Caco-2 cells [19] . These cells develop polarization of distinct apical and basolateral surfaces separated by tight junctions at areas of cell-to-cell contact closely resembling the physiological situation in the intestine. The transepithelial resistance (TER) is a measure for the tightness of the tight junctions formed by Caco-2 cells. Rotaviruses are known to infect epithelial cells of the small intestine and in vitro rotavirus infection of Caco-2 cells caused disruption of tight junctions and loss of TER in the absence of cell death [20] . To investigate whether the loss of TER could be prevented, Caco-2 cells were infected with SA-11 rotavirus in the presence of hyperimmune colostrum (Gastrogard-R W ), plant extracts or pure compounds. From both models, the results of 150 aqueous plant extracts on their antiviral action against rotavirus are presented in a search for novel agents for the treatment of human diarrhea caused by rotavirus infection.",

The electrical resistance is then measured across the cell monolayer after the passage of a defined current pulse. Experiments were carried out at two weeks post confluency with fully differentiated cells. One day before infection, the Caco-2 cells were cultured in medium without FCS. Prior to infection, the SA-11 rotavirus inoculum was activated for 20 min by treatment with 0.5 mg trypsin/ml (Invitrogen).

The integrity of the confluent polarized monolayer was checked by measuring TER with a volt-ohmmeter. TER (in units of ohm times centimeters squared) was calculated as the measured electrical resistance times the surface area of a filter. The background reading of a control filter was measured in every experiment. Infections were carried out in triplicates and all measurements were done at various time points post infection.

This does not imply that there is no role for nutrition in preventing or curing disease [22] . The 150 plant extracts used in the screening here were selected because of their known nutritional uses. The nutritional applications and antiviral activities of the five strongest rotavirus inhibitors are discussed. Nelumbo nucifera (sacred water lotus) is not a well known food ingredient in Europe, but in Asia the roots are often eaten as a vegetable in soups, deep-fried, stir-fried and braised dishes. Nelumbo nucifera is known to have antiviral action against HIV [23] and Herpes simplex virus (HSV) [24] . Aspalathus linearis leaves are used to make redbush tea which has been popular in Southern Africa for generations and is now consumed in many countries. No antiviral activity has been reported yet for Aspalathus linearis. Urtica dioica (stinging nettle) can be used in a variety of recipes and nettle soup is a common use of the plant, particularly in Northern and Eastern Europe. In Nepal and Northern India it is a very popular vegetable and cooked with Indian spices. Known antiviral actions of Urtica dioica are inhibition of both HIV and FIV, the feline variant of HIV [25, 26] .",

Glycyrrhizic acid is one of the bioactive compounds of licorice roots and is composed of one molecule of 18\u00df-glycyrrhetinic acid, which has a steroid-like structure, and two molecules of glucuronic acid. Lin et al. reported 18\u00df-glycyrrhetinic acid to have a stronger action against Epstein-Barr virus than its parental compound glycyrrhizic acid [32] . Two constituents of Aspalathus linearis, luteolin and vitexin, also showed antiviral activity against rotavirus in the antiviral titration assay. Luteolin is a flavonoid most often found in leaves and vitexin is an apigenin flavone glucoside. Both compounds are found in many different plant species other than Aspalathus. The weakest inhibitor was apigenin 7-O-glucoside, also a flavonoid and can be found in for example lemon balm (Melissa officinalis), chamomile (Chamomilla recutita) and celery (Apium graveolens). So far as we know this is the first study showing that luteolin, vitexin and apigenin 7-Oglucoside have antiviral activity in vitro. Although the mechanism of action has yet to be defined, this is a first step in a potential wider, more pharmacological use of these nutritional ingredients. The possibility that there are other active compounds present in the positive plant extracts has to be further investigated. The positive control hyperimmune colostrum (HIC) showed inhibitory action against rotavirus infection in both the antiviral titration assay with RRV in MA104 cells as well as in maintaining the TER in Caco-2 cells infected with SA-11. In synergism studies, where the extracts have been combined in the IC25 concentration, synergism in antiviral activity was found in the combinations Glycyrrhiza glabra L. + Nelumbo nucifera Gaertn. and Urtica dioica L. + Nelumbo nucifera Gaertn. The separate extracts with IC50 concentration showed an inhibition of infection of about 50%. Both combinations in the IC25 concentration of the extracts showed an inhibition of more than 50%, respectively 89% and 86%. This indicates that the extracts in the combination have different antiviral actions. This illustrates the importance for further research into the mechanism of action of the individual ingredients, as well as in vivo validation of the antiviral capacity.",
