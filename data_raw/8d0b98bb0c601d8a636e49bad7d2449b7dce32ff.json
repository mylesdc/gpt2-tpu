Interleukins (IL) -35 and IL-37 are newly discovered cytokines that play an important role in suppressing the immune system. However, the expression of these interleukins in patients with Madurella mycetomatis (M. mycetomatis) induced eumycetoma has not yet been explored. The aim of this study is to determine the levels of IL-1 family (IL-1\u03b2, IL-37) and IL-12 family (IL-12, IL-35) in a group of these patients and the association between these cytokines levels and the patients' demographic characteristics. The present, case-control study was conducted at the Mycetoma Research Centre, Soba University Hospital, University of Khartoum, Sudan and it included 140 individuals. They were divided into two groups; group I: healthy controls [n = 70; median age 25 years (range 12 to 70 years)]. Group II: mycetoma patients [n = 70 patients; median age 25 (range 13 to 70 years)]. Cytokines levels were measured in sera using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). There was a significant negative correlation between IL-1\u03b2 and IL-12 levels and lesion size and disease duration, while IL-37 and IL-35 levels were significantly positively correlated with both lesion size and disease duration. The analysis of the risk factors of higher circulatory levels of IL-37 in patients of mycetoma showed a negative significant association with IL-1\u03b2 cytokine, where a unit increment in IL-1\u03b2 will decrease the levels of IL-37 by 35.28 pg/ ml. The levels of IL-37 among the patients with a duration of mycetoma infection \ufffd 1 year were significantly low by an average of 18.45 pg/ml compared to patients with a mycetoma infection's duration of \ufffd 5years (reference group). Furthermore, the risk factors of higher levels of IL-35 in mycetoma patients revealed a negative significant association with IL-12, PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0007098 April 4, 2019 1 / 18 OPEN ACCESS Citation: Abushouk A, Nasr A, Masuadi E, Allam G, Siddig EE, Fahal AH (2019) The Role of Interleukin-1 cytokine family (IL-1\u03b2, IL-37) and interleukin-12 cytokine family (IL-12, IL-35) in eumycetoma infection pathogenesis. PLoS Negl Trop Dis 13(4): e0007098. https://doi.org/10.as a unit increment in IL-12 decreases the levels of IL-35 by 8.99 pg/ml (p < 0.001). Levels of IL-35 among the patients with duration of mycetoma infection \ufffd one year were significantly low on average by 41.82 pg/ml (p value = 0.002) compared to patients with a duration of mycetoma infection \ufffd 5 years (reference group). In conclusion, this study indicates that both IL-35 and IL-37 are negatively associated with the levels of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-12 in eumycetoma mycetoma infection; and high levels of IL-37 and IL-35 may have a negative impact on disease progression.",

Mycetoma is a neglected disease which is endemic in many tropical and subtropical areas. If the disease is not treated properly, eventually it ends up with amputation and adverse medical, health and socioeconomic effects on patients and the community. Previous data suggested a crucial role of adaptive immunity in host resistance to causative agents and in the disease progress. The recently identified IL-35 and IL-37 cytokines revealed an important role in immune suppression. Nevertheless, the expression of these interleukins in patients with mycetoma has not yet been investigated. Therefore, the present case-control study aimed to determine the levels of IL-1 family (IL-1\u03b2, IL-37) and IL-12 family (IL-12, IL-35) in these patients and the association between these cytokines levels and the patients' demographic characteristics. The results of this study showed that, the levels of IL-37 and IL-35 were consistently positively correlated with different diameters of mycetoma lesions as well as its duration. However, the levels of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-12 were consistently negatively correlated with different diameters of lesions and the duration of mycetoma infection. The analysis of the risk factors of higher circulatory levels of IL-37 in patients of mycetoma showed a negative significant association with IL-1\u03b2 cytokine Furthermore, the risk factors of higher levels of IL-35 in patients of mycetoma revealed a negative significant association with IL-12. These findings uncover a possible the role of IL-35 and IL-37 in the pathogenesis of mycetoma, and may declare their potential value in treatment of mycetoma.",

This infection progresses to affect the deep structures and bones leading to massive destruction, deformities and disabilities [1] . It constitutes a major health problem in many tropical and subtropical countries and it is highly endemic in Sudan, Mexico, and India. In Sudan, more than 8500 patients were managed at the Mycetoma Research Centre in Khartoum, of whom 70% were infected with the fungus M. mycetomatis. The disease affects all age groups, but it occurs most commonly in young men at the age group 20 to 40 years [2] . The disease is usually painless and the clinical diagnosis is commonly based on the presence of subcutaneous mass, multiple sinuses and seropurulent discharge with grains. Treatment opportunities comprise of various chemotherapeutics agents and wide surgical excision of the infected tissues and may possibly end up with limb amputation [3] .",

            "text": "Although most individuals in endemic areas have antibodies against the causative agent of mycetoma; only few develop the disease [4] . Both innate and adaptive immunity play a role in host resistance to causative agents and in the development of disease. Therefore, T-cell responses seem to be important in the progress of mycetoma [5, 6] . A T-helper (Th) 2-like response was reported in primary lesions and in draining lymph nodes in patients with Streptomyces somaliensis infection and after stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells by M. mycetomatis antigens [5, 7] , whilst Th1 response was reported in the acute phase of infection and in healthy endemic controls [8, 9] . Macrophages stimulated with live conidia of Pseudallescheria boydii also induced a Th2 response, whereas hyphae induced a Th1 response [10] . Experimental infection of nude athymic rats and mice with Nocardia (N.) asteroids let to fatal disease dissemination [11, 12] . In addition, T lymphocytes from previously immunised animals directly killed N. asteroides [12, 13] . Moreover, Trevino-Villarreal and associates [14] reported that N. brasiliensis cell wall-associated lipids are implicated in the development of experimental actinomycetoma and act principally by inhibiting several microbicidal effects of macrophages, including the inhibition of TNF-\u03b1 production, phagocytosis, production of nitric oxide (NO), and bacterial killing. In addition, they demonstrated that the N. brasiliensis wall-associated lipids suppressed the expression of major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC II), CD80, and CD40 by dendritic cells (DCs) and strongly induced the production of TGF-\u03b2 by these cells. It has been suggested that pre-existing Th2 environment caused by schistosomiasis promotes the development of mycetoma as patients with mycetoma were significantly more positive for schistosoma antibodies than healthy endemic controls [9] . These findings suggested that Th2 like response and anti-inflammatory/immunosuppressive cytokines could have a negative impact on mycetoma development and disease progression.",

It is involved in the acutephase response and is accountable for several alterations that are related to the onset of various medical disorders [15, 16] . It is demonstrated recently that higher levels of IL-1\u03b2 cytokine are strongly associated with surgically treated mycetoma patients, in comparison to those treated without surgery [17] . It is known that IL-1\u03b2 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that is involved in cell death coordination [18] . IL-1\u03b2 cytokine is cleaved into the mature, active form primarily by inflammasome dependent caspase activity [18] . It is possibly that mature IL-1\u03b2 secretion by macrophages activates IL-1 receptor type 1 (IL-1R1) on macrophages, fibroblasts and epithelial cells, inducing production of the CXC chemokine CXCL1/KC, which binds to CXCR2 on neutrophils and mediates recruitment of neutrophils from peripheral blood to stimulate inflammation at the site of mycetoma invasion. Therefore, these higher levels of IL-1\u03b2 cytokine advocate a crucial role in M. mycetomatis pathogenesis.",

            "text": "IL-37, which is a member of the IL-1 family, has emerged as a potent anti-inflammatory cytokine that suppresses both innate and adaptive immune responses [19] . Its role in human diseases is not completely understood yet [20] . However, the anti-inflammatory properties of IL-37 have been associated with inflammatory diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) [21] , and inflammatory bowel disease [22] . It has been reported that IL-37 is negatively associated with pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-17, TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients with degenerative intervertebral discs [23] and Graves' disease (GD) [24] . IL-37 protein level in PBMCs and DCs is up-regulated when stimulated by Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands or pro-inflammatory cytokines [25] . In vitro, over expression of IL-37 in macrophages or epithelial cells greatly inhibits the production of major pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IFN-\u03b3 and macrophage inflammatory protein 2 [25, 26] . In vivo, IL-37 transgene protects mice from lipopolysaccharides-induced shock and chemical-induced colitis [19, 27] . IL-37 interferes with the innate protective anti-Candida host response by reducing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and suppressing neutrophil recruitment in response to Candida infection, resulting in an increased susceptibility to disseminated candidiasis [28] . Moreover, IL-37 markedly reduced inflammasome activation and disease severity in murine aspergillosis [29] . In addition to its role in innate immunity; IL-37 plays a pivotal role in regulating adaptive immunity by inducing T regulatory (T reg ) cells and impairing activation of effector T-cell responses [30] . To our knowledge, there has been no study to report the relationship between IL-37 and mycetoma pathogenesis so far.",

It binds to the heterodimeric IL-12 receptor, which is principally present in T cells and on natural killer (NK) cells [31] .

IL-35 is a potent immunosuppressive cytokine produced by B regulatory cells (B reg ) [35] , DCs [36] , and to a lesser extent, by endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and monocytes [37] . The biological effect of IL-35 is poorly understood, however IL-35 is recognised as a typical anti-inflammatory cytokine, and the predominant mechanism of suppression is associated with its ability to suppress T cell proliferation and effector functions [33, 38] . Given the direct immunosuppressive effect of IL-35, many studies have been conducted to evaluate its role in the development of several diseases. IL-35 can suppress several types of chronic inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease [26] , and decreased the severity of collagen induced arthritis in animals via enhancement of IL-10 production [39] and suppression of Th17 cells [40] . In an asthma model, intra-tracheal instillation of IL-35 decreased disease severity by diminishing the Th2 cell counts [41] and by reducing the production of IL-17 [42] . In bacterial infections, Shen and associates [35] found that mice without IL-35 expression demonstrated an obviously improved resistance to infection with the intracellular bacterial pathogen Salmonella typhimurium. In addition, IL-35 has been increased in the serum of adults and children with sepsis, and administration of anti-IL-35 p35 antibodies diminished dissemination of the bacteria in septic animals [43] . Similarly, tuberculous patients exhibited an increase in serum IL-35 and in mRNA expression of both subunits of IL-35 (p35 and EBI3) in white blood cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells [44] . However, the role of IL-35 in mycetoma pathogenesis has not been highlighted yet.",

            "text": "Although mycetoma represents a major health problem in many tropical and subtropical areas, there is no prevention or control measures for this neglected disease [22, 23] . In mycetoma endemic areas, most individuals have antibodies against the causative agents, however only few develop disease [4] . Few researchers believed that patients who develop mycetoma seem to be deficient in their cell-mediated immunity [6] . Hence, we aimed to investigate the profiles of the pro-inflammatory (IL-1\u03b2 and IL-12) and the anti-inflammatory immunosuppressive (IL-37 and IL-35) cytokines among mycetoma patients and their association with disease characteristics. As far as we know, this is the first study addressing the relation between immunosuppressive cytokines (IL-37 and IL-35) and mycetoma infection. Our data showed that eumycetoma patients presented higher circulating levels of IL-1\u03b2, IL-12, IL-37 and IL-35 compared to controls. In addition, serum levels of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-12 were significantly decreased with increasing lesions' diameter and disease duration, whereas levels of IL-37 and IL-35 were significantly higher with increasing lesions' diameter and disease duration. These findings indicate that immunosuppressive cytokines like IL-37 and IL-35, which could suppress cellmediated immune responses, may exacerbate the disease progression. Data of the current study clearly showed the serum levels of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-12 in eumycetoma patients with different lesion size and disease duration were positively correlated with each other, and negatively correlated with IL-35 and IL-37. It has been demonstrated that the first line of innate immune response against mycetoma infection is by phagocytes, from which macrophages represent the major phagocytic cells [50] . In general, protective immunity to fungal infections [51] involves activation of TLRs generating inflammatory cytokines through pattern-recognition receptors and pathogen associated molecular patterns [52, 53] . IL-1\u03b2 and other pro-inflammatory cytokines are produced early in response to fungal infections and promote phagocytosis and other means of innate immune response [54, 55] . Following inflammatory stimuli, several cell types including immune and non-immune cells produce IL-37, as a protective mechanism to prevent runaway inflammation and excessive tissue damage [56] . IL-37 directly inhibits generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and down-regulates macrophage cytokine release, and therefore innate immunity [57, 58] . Moreover, IL-37 induces macrophages towards an M2-like phenotype [59] . M1 macrophages are the most critical effector cells in the innate immune defense system and are characterised by high expression levels of iNOS, subsequent NO production and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1\u03b2 and IL-12 [60] . However, M2 macrophages secrete antiinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-10 [61] and express arginase 1, which inhibits NO production, thus rendering these cells ineffective in killing infectious agents including fungal agents [61, 62] . Furthermore, DCs expressing IL-37 secreted higher levels of IL-10 and reduced levels of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-12. Therefore, the presence of IL-37 in DCs impairs their function in prime T cells and promotes their ability to induce Treg cells that produce IL-10, which is also a potent anti-inflammatory cytokine [30] . Our results have consistently shown higher circulatory levels of IL-37 in patients of mycetoma which is negatively associated with IL-1\u03b2, as a unit increment in IL-1\u03b2 decreases the levels of IL-37 by 35.28 pg/ml. Based on the aforementioned data, we can speculate that IL-37 could play a role in damping inflammatory response in mycetoma infection which leads to disease progression and this is not in the patient's favor.",

This may probably be an attempt to dampen ongoing inflammation. Both IL-1\u03b2 and IL-12 have a pivotal role in inflammatory and cell-mediated immune responses. Macrophages, Th1 and cytotoxic T-cells (CTLs), which constitute the main component of cell-mediated immunity, play an important role in the protective immunity against mycetoma infection [2] . As fatal dissemination of N. asteroids infection occurs in nude athymic rats and mice [11, 12] , T cells from previously immunized animals are able to kill N. asteroids in new infections [12, 13] . IL-35 could suppress Th1 and macrophage responses [63] , whereas deficiency in IL-35 increases macrophage's activation and induces Th1 responses [35, 63] . The increased immunity found in mice lacking IL-35 is associated with a higher activation of macrophages and inflammatory T cells, as well as enhancing function of antigen-presenting cells [35] . In another infection model, Cao and his co-workers reported higher serum levels of IL-35 in septic patients compared to controls, and IL-35 gradually increased with increased sepsis severity. Moreover, administration of anti-IL-35 antibodies diminished dissemination of the bacteria in septic animals and enhanced local neutrophil recruitment with increasing in inflammatory cytokines and chemokines production [43] . Furthermore, IL-35 suppressed the proliferation of antigen-specific CTLs and IFN-\u03b3 production [64] . Our data revealed that higher levels of IL-35 in patients with mycetoma is negatively associated with IL-12, where a unit increment in IL-12 decreases the levels of IL-35 by 8.99 pg/ml. This finding indicates that IL-35 may be a risk factor for mycetoma infection and have a negative role in the clinical presentation of the disease.",

This finding is consistent with previous studies which reported that mycetoma mostly affects ages between 20 and 40 years-old, In addition, our data demonstrated that mycetoma infection was predominant in males, as the male to female ratio in patient's group was 4:1. This finding is running parallel with the results of a previous study which demonstrated that in a tertiary facility in Khartoum, Sudan, the male to female ratio is 4:1, whereas at the primary care level in White Nile State, Sudan, the reported male to female ratio was 1.6:1. Another studies reported that male to female ratios in mycetoma infections were in the range of 1.6-6.6:1 [2] . The predominance of mycetoma in males may be attributed to increased exposure in men who engage in different manual labors including agricultural work. Moreover, influence of sex hormones might have a role in susceptibility to mycetoma infections and disease progression [4, 65] .",

This finding could be attributed to the nature of mycetoma which is usually painless and slowly progressive. In addition, the lack of health facilities in endemic areas, the low socio-economic status of the affected patients and their poor health education [1, 4, 66] are amongst the reasons why the current treatment of mycetoma is suboptimal, characterised by low cure rates and frequent recurrence often leading to amputation [67, 68] . However, clinical experience shows that early and small mycetoma lesions are associated with good outcome and prevent severe complications of the disease.",

A previous study by Friccius and colleagues suggested that the dose of 10 \u03bcg/ml itraconazole leads to strong inhibition of the cytokines IL-2, IL-4, IL-9 and IFN-\u03b3 and slight inhibition of TNF-\u03b1 cytokine production in PBMC after 6 and 24 hours of incubation. These results demonstrate that IL-35 and IL-37 can be one of the underline factors associated with inhibition of the cytokines related to Itraconazole [69] .",

However, the levels of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-12 were consistently negatively correlated with different diameters of lesions and the duration of mycetoma infection. The analysis of the risk factors of higher circulatory levels of IL-37 in patients of mycetoma showed a negative significant association with IL-1\u03b2 cytokine, where a unit increment in IL-1\u03b2 will decrease the levels of IL-37 by 35.28 pg/ ml. Levels of IL-37 among the patients with a mycetoma infection duration \ufffd 1 year had significantly decreased on average by 18.45 pg/ml compared to patients with a mycetoma infection duration \ufffd 5years (reference group). Furthermore, the risk factors of higher levels of IL-35 in patients of mycetoma revealed a negative significant association with IL-12, as a unit increment in IL-12 decreases the levels of IL-35 decrease by 8.99 pg/ml, p < 0.001. Levels of IL-35 among the patients with a mycetoma infection duration \ufffd 1 year had significantly decreased (p value = 0.002) on average by 41.82 pg/ml compared to patients with a mycetoma infection duration \ufffd 5years (reference group). More investigations are needed to explore the mechanism by which IL-35 and IL-37 contribute in the mycetoma infection outcomes. This will help in understanding the role of these cytokines IL-35 and IL-37 in the pathogenesis of mycetoma, and may exploit it as a potential therapeutic target to prevent mycetoma diseases recurrence.",
