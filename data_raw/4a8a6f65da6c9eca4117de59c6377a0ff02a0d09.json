While all immune globulin products meet the specifications set by the US FDA for antibodies to pathogens like measles and polio, they have variable levels of antibodies to other important viruses and infectious pathogens, particularly respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Methods An IVIG was developed that satisfies the requirements for treating patients with primary immune deficiency disease (PIDD) and also has standardized elevated levels of RSV neutralizing antibodies (RI-002). Plasma donors who have naturally occurring high circulating levels of neutralizing anti-RSVantibody were selected as the source for manufacturing IVIG to treat patients with PIDD to prevent serious bacterial infections. While the introduction of the monoclonal antibody Palivizumab has had a dramatic impact in diminishing the burden of RSV disease in the pediatric population, it does not meet the standards for replacing the deficient immune compartments of patients with PIDD. Results Fifty-nine patients with PIDD at 9 different sites across the US were enrolled in this study and received regular infusions of RI-002 over the course of 1 year. Conclusions There were zero serious bacterial infections, thus meeting the primary endpoint for this trial. The secondary endpoints including days missed from work due to infection, unscheduled visits to the physician, and days of hospitalization due to infection compared favorably to published reports of other IVIG products.",

Regularly scheduled infusions of IG replace or supplement antibodies that decrease the risk of the serious bacterial and viral infections experienced by PIDD patients [6] [7] [8] . Although all available preparations of immune globulin provide sufficient antibodies to significantly decrease the frequency of infections in immunodeficient patients, infections continue to occur [2, 6] . Previous studies have suggested that some infections in antibody-deficient PIDD patients occur when the titer of protective antibody is inadequate [9] [10] [11] [12] . While many of these reports have focused on bacterial pathogens, additional evidence supports the proposition that high titer anti-viral antibody preparations may provide advantages over conventional IG [13, 14] .",

When this product was available, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) stated that for children with severe immunodeficiencies receiving IG therapy during the winter months, physicians could consider the addition and/or substitution of the high titer RSV-IVIG for standard IG supplementation [17] . These data suggested that a polyclonal anti-RSV hyperimmune globulin would confer enhanced protection from infection. Despite the successful use of this RSV-IVIG in premature infants, it was voluntarily withdrawn after the introduction of a monoclonal anti-RSV (Synagis\u00ae) antibody that could be administered intramuscularly rather than intravenously as was required for the polyclonal antibody [14] . Consequently, a new IG formulation that meets all the standard criteria for treatment of PIDD (RI-002) was developed using plasma collected from individuals tested to have high titer anti-RSV antibodies [18] .",

Administration of RI-002 with either regimen resulted in increases in IgG and in CMV, tetanus, Hib, measles, RSV, and S. pneumoniae serotype antibodies with the greatest increase in C max observed in antibodies to RSV. There was a 5.47-fold increase in the titer of anti-RSV neutralizing antibody immediately after infusion of the IVIG and a 6.79-fold increase in those subjects who received greater than 500 mg/kg (Table 3 ). In this calculation, baseline was that value of anti-RSV measured immediately prior to entry into the trial. Figure 1 shows the pharmacokinetics of anti-RSV antibodies, and in this situation, baseline was the value of anti-RSV that was measured in the subjects enrolled in the PK portion of the study immediately prior to infusion of the seventh or ninth dose of IVIG. RI-002 is manufactured to contain standardized, elevated levels of neutralizing antibodies to RSV, and all lots are tested for release potency for RSV antibody levels. There was no apparent difference between groups in the mean plasma concentrations of IgG and the mean values for C max despite a slightly larger AUC over the dosing interval due to the 7-day longer period. Although the mean values for t\u00bd should be considered as qualitative because of the period of time over which \u03bbz was measured, they are consistent with literature values for the t\u00bd of IgG. Although there was a range of RI-002 doses within each group, there was no apparent relationship between AUC over the dosing interval and either total dose or weight adjusted dose for either cohort (Table 4 ). Taken as a whole, the increases in the RSV, CMV, tetanus, Hib, measles, and S. pneumoniae antibodies were not affected by the treatment intervals used in this study. The mean values for all antibodies measured at baseline were comparable to the pre-infusion titers for both cohorts, and the maximum titers were higher than the baseline and pre-infusion titers. There did not appear to be a difference in exposure to IgG as a function of sex or age group. Analysis of baseline corrected plasma IgG concentrations resulted in comparisons between the 3 and 4-week cycle cohorts that were comparable to those using plasma concentrations without baseline correction.",

            "text": "Among the viral infections that cause substantial morbidity, respiratory syncytial virus is a particular problem, especially in patients with coexistent pulmonary disease [19, 20] . In 1996, an anti-RSV hyper-immune globulin product, RSV-IVIG (RespiGam\u00ae), was approved for the prevention of severe respiratory syncytial virus infection in premature infants whose gestational age was less than 32 weeks. Studies suggested that RSV-IVIG reduced disease severity in infants who became infected with RSV, shortening hospital stays compared to age-matched controls [15, 16, 21] . Despite these beneficial effects, RSV-IVIG was voluntarily removed from the market by the manufacturer in favor of an intramuscularly administrated monoclonal anti-RSV antibody palivizumab (Synagis\u00ae). There are no direct head to head clinical studies comparing the efficacy of RSV-IVIG to palivizumab [17] . While both appear comparable in their ability to prevent RSV infections in low birth weight infants, there appear to be certain clinical advantages of the polyclonal antibody [17] . In the PREVENT study, not only was RSV-IVIG able to prevent RSV infections but it also reduced the incidence of other, non-RSV-related upper respiratory diseases [15] . Another study demonstrated that high-risk infants receiving RSV-IVIG had a statistically significant reduction in the overall frequency of otitis media compared with placebo-treated subjects, also suggesting that polyclonal antibody activity to other pathogens may have contributed to this reduction observed in the incidence of otitis media [21] . Interestingly, in the current study, there was only one single reported case of otitis media, an exceedingly low incidence for this population of subjects in the study. Recently published studies in the cotton rat demonstrated that RI-002 can not only reduce the viral load in normal and immune suppressed cotton rats that have been infected with RSV, but that it can dramatically reverse the intense inflammatory changes that are observed in their pulmonary tissue [22] . Because of the historical data suggesting the potential value of a polyclonal anti-RSV, IG product for the immunecompromised patient population, a new Ig formulation was developed. The new product, RI-002, is an IVIG that is manufactured and standardized to contain elevated levels of anti-RSV neutralizing antibody and, in this regard, is comparable to RespiGam\u00ae [22] [23] [24] . However, this new product has the added advantage that it is manufactured to comply with the FDA guidance for IG products for the treatment of patients with PIDD [18] . Similar to other IGs, this IVIG (RI-002) was made from plasma collected from more than 1000 plasma donors and was manufactured using an FDAapproved fractionation and purification process [25, 26] . Unlike other IGs, the plasma that was used to produce RI-002 was collected from donors who were identified and selected to have high neutralizing antibody titers to RSV. The selection was based on testing results obtained utilizing a validated RSV live-virus microneutralization assay. There was as great as a 6.79-fold increase in the levels of anti-RSV neutralizing antibody that was measured in subjects who were on the dosing regimen of greater than 500 mg/kg. Interestingly, the lots of IVIG produced from RSV hyperimmune donors were also found to have significantly elevated antibody titers to other respiratory viruses (parainfluenza type 1 and 3, influenza, coronavirus, and metapneumovirus) as compared to ten other commercial lots of IG [27] . This preparation of RI-002, therefore, can be regarded as having a unique antibody profile for multiple respiratory viruses that differentiates it from other commercially available IGs. Viewed in the context of data from other IG trials, there are many of the secondary efficacy endpoints, for example number of days missed from [25, [28] [29] [30] . This study demonstrated excellent outcomes that might reflect the unique antibody profile of RI-002. The efficacy of RI-002 is likely the result of the maintenance of stable IgG trough levels as well as specific antibody levels throughout the study conferring the expected protective effects of IG therapy. The pharmacokinetic properties of RI-002 were comparable to previous reports of IVIG preparations. All subjects maintained average trough levels of serum Ig of approximately 1000 mg/kg. There were significant postinfusion increases in all of the specific antibody titers measured with a greater than 6-fold increase seen in the concentration of RSV-neutralizing antibody immediately postinfusion in patients receiving greater than 500 mg/kg of IG.",

Since it has been reported that pulmonary viral infections are often the antecedent to bacterial pulmonary infections, it is tempting to speculate that an IVIG that has high titer antibodies to viruses may also have an impact on reducing the incidence of bacterial infections.",
