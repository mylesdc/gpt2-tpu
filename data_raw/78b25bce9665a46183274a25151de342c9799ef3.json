Exposure to 10 ng/L EE 2 for 21 days down-regulated the expression of ef1a, g6pd, bactin and gapdh in the liver, and bactin and gapdh in the gonad. Some of these effects were gender-specific, with bactin in the liver and gapdh in the gonad down-regulated by EE 2 in males only. Furthermore, when ef1a, g6pd, bactin or gapdh were used for normalization, the hepatic expression of two genes of interest, vitellogenin (vtg) and cytochrome P450 1A (cyp1a) following exposure to EE 2 was overestimated.",

            "text": "Over the past 25 years, there has been increasing concern about the impacts of the plethora of natural and anthropogenic chemicals discharged into the aquatic environ-ment that disrupt the endocrine system of wildlife [1] . Typically, these endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) exert their actions via interactions with the nuclear steroid hormone receptors. The most well characterised, and of greatest current concern, are EDCs which bind to and activate the estrogen receptor: so-called environmental estrogens (for a review, see [2] ). The international research effort on chemically-induced endocrine disruption has been driven by unequivocal evidence that environmental estrogens alter sexual development and function in fish (for a review, see [3] ), and effects on other physiological processes, including growth, development, osmoregulation, and stress and immune responses, have also been reported (reviewed in [4] ). An improved understanding of the mechanisms by which these effects occur is critical if we are to fully assess the potential health implications of exposure to environmental estrogens, both for fish and for other vertebrates.",

Real-time reverse transcription PCR is presently the most sensitive method for the detection of mRNAs [6] , and is also often employed for the validation of gene expression data from high-throughput array experiments [7] . Quantitative analysis of gene expression using real-time PCR typically requires the use of a constitutively expressed 'housekeeping' gene as an internal control to normalize for differences in starting cDNA template between samples (reviewed in [8, 9] ). The fundamental requirement for validation of the expression stability of an internal control gene prior to its use in the system being studied is also well-defined. Nevertheless, in contrast to the situation for many mammalian experimental systems (e.g. [10] [11] [12] ), studies investigating the effects of environmental estrogens on gene expression in nonmammalian vertebrates have used 'housekeeping' genes more or less randomly as internal controls, and without any validation of their expression stability in the system being studied, which may have serious implications for the interpretation of the effects data.",

These 'housekeeping' genes have been validated previously for use as internal controls in many experimental systems, particularly in mammals (18S rRNA: e.g. [10] [11] [12] ; ribosomal proteins: e.g. [13] [14] [15] ; ef1a: e.g. [13, 14, 16] ; g6pd: e.g. [17, 18] ; bactin: e.g. [10, 19] the required real-time PCR assays for some of the target 'housekeeping' genes, whose sequences were not publicly available in the study species (18S rRNA, rp18, ef1a), first required the cloning of the full-or partial-length sequences for these genes.",

This concurs with the observations that E 2 and several other estrogenic compounds disrupt cytoskel-etal compounds in vitro [34] [35] [36] . In contrast, bactin expression has been shown to be increased in liver of plaice (Pleuronectes platessa) and zebrafish (Danio rerio) exposed to EE 2 [29, 37] , and in pituitary of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) exposed to E 2 and NP [38] . Expression of gapdh in livers of plaice and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) has also been shown to be repressed by various environmental estrogens, including EE 2 [28, 29, 39] . Further evidence of estrogen-regulation of bactin and gapdh coming from mammalian studies [40] [41] [42] [43] strengthens the case that their use as internal controls for studies for quantification of gene expression with estrogen treatment is probably inappropriate. The down-regulation of hepatic ef1a and g6pd by EE 2 observed in the present study also concurs with data from zebrafish embryos [39] , where two ef1a isoforms were down-regulated by estrogen, and from the European flounder (Platichthys flesus), where E 2 inhibited activity of the G6pd enzyme in hepatocytes by 30% in males and 80% in females [44] . In fact, estrogenregulation of g6pd provides a likely explanation for differences we observed in hepatic g6pd expression between the sexes in this study (lower expression in females; data not shown), since female fish have higher circulating levels of endogenous estrogens than males. The effect of estrogen on gapdh and g6pd expression observed here likely results from their involvement in metabolism, since estrogens, like other sex steroids, are well known to have roles in the regulation of the metabolic processes associated with altered energy demands during gonad development and reproduction in fish [45] [46] [47] . Moreover, several other metabolic enzymes are also known to be controlled by sex steroids including estrogens in fish [27, 46, 48] .",

For example, ef1a and g6pd expression were only altered by EE 2 in liver and not in gonad. Moreover, the expression levels of gapdh in gonad and bactin in liver were only down-regulated by EE 2 in males and not in females. Complex effects of estrogens (including tissue-, gender-, and/or developmental-stage-specific effects) have been demonstrated for many estrogen-regulated genes, including 'housekeeping' genes, in fish and higher vertebrates (e.g. [4, 41] ) and this suggests that these genes may have different roles in different tissues, and different roles in males compared with in females in these tissues.

The high stability of rpl8 expression following estrogen treatment conforms with data from largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), where the expression of a suite of 11 ribosomal proteins, including rpl8, did not fluctuate appreciably (<1.3-fold) in response to estrogenic compounds, and ribosomal proteins were thus recommended for use as internal control genes in microarray experiments involving estrogen treatments [33] . However, the results of another study on rainbow trout demonstrated EE 2 -induction of the ribosomal protein ribosomal protein s3 (rps3) [28], emphasising that not all ribosomal proteins may be estrogen-independent. Although there is no other data currently available concerning possible estrogen regulation of hprt1 and tbp in fish, hprt has been described as an estrogen-independent 'housekeeping' gene in mammals [21], supporting our findings here.",

In that study however, and based on array analyses, 18S rRNA was up-regulated in a concentration-dependent manner in zebrafish liver after a shorter term (24 hour) exposure to EE 2 , suggesting that any 18S rRNA regulation by estrogen may occur in a temporal manner. Although rRNAs have been advocated for use as internal controls in many other experimental systems and their levels are thought to be less likely to vary under conditions that affect the expression of mRNAs (e.g. [10] [11] [12] 49] ), there is some evidence that another rRNA, 28S rRNA, is also regulated by estrogen in fish [29] . Moreover, some clear disadvantages in the use of rRNAs as internal controls have been highlighted by other researchers (e.g. see [17, 50, 51] . Most notably, rRNAs can only be used as internal controls for total RNA preparations (since mRNA purification methods randomly remove them) and cannot be used when an oligo(dT) reverse transcription has been carried out. The use of rRNAs, which constitute 80-90% of total RNA, has also been criticised due to their very high general expression level which far exceeds that for mRNAs (e.g. [51, 52] ). A very high general level of expression of 18S rRNA was also observed in the current study (18S rRNA had a mean C t of approximately 11, compared to mean C t s of approximately 23-32 for the other candidate 'housekeeping' genes). It is imperative, therefore, that these issues are considered if selecting 18S rRNA as an internal control for studies on environmental estrogens in fish.",

As expected, the use of appropriate 'housekeeping' genes (18S rRNA, rpl8, tbp, or hprt1; which were not affected by the EE 2 treatment) for the normalizations, gave very similar results to the data generated when the input cDNA amount was normalized, demonstrating that the use of these genes is valid and effectively normalizes for differences in input cDNA. In contrast, when 'housekeeping' genes down-regulated by the EE 2 treatment (ef1a, g6pd, bactin, or gapdh) were used, the expression levels of the genes of interest were overestimated, which lead to inappropriate conclusions about the manner in which these genes were regulated, or not regulated, by estrogen, and/or the degree to which they were estrogen-regulated. Likewise, if a 'housekeeping' gene which was up-regulated by EE 2 had been used for normalization, the expression levels of the genes of interest would have been underestimated. These findings have major implications for studies on the effects and potential impacts of environmental estrogens in fish that use internal control genes that have not been validated for the specifics of the experimental system, and in particular for studies which require to detect small changes in the expression of the gene of interest. An interesting aside from this work has been to show that an environmental concentration of EE 2 is capable of disrupting expression of a suite of genes that play key roles in general cell function and maintenance, adding further to the concern about the potential impacts of this estrogen in the aquatic environment.",

The fathead minnow vtg [Genbank: AF130354] assay was as described previously [4] . The primers for the fathead minnow cyp1a [Genbank: AF232749] assay were 5'-AGGGAGAACTGAGAGAG-3'/ 5'-GTGAGGGATGGTGAAC-3' and the annealing temperature was 57\u00b0C. Relative expression levels (gene of interest: 'housekeeping' gene) were determined using a development of the arithmetic comparative 2 -\u0394\u0394Ct method [59] which includes efficiency correction [60, 61] .",

Assays were optimized and validated for real-time quantitative PCR using SYBR Green chemistry as described previously[56]. All assays had detection ranges of at least five orders of magnitude. Specificity of primer sets throughout this range of detection was confirmed by the observation of single amplification products of the expected size, melting temperature and sequence. All assays were quantitative, with standard curve (mean C t vs. log cDNA dilution) slopes of between -2.794 and -3.533, translating to high real-time PCR efficiency (E) values of 1.92-2.28. Over the detection range, the linear correlation (R 2 ) between the mean C t and the logarithm of the cDNA dilution was >0.99 in each case.
