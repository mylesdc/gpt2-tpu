Here we show that the B38-CAP, a carboxypeptidase derived from Paenibacillus sp. B38, is an ACE2-like enzyme to decrease angiotensin II levels in mice. In protein 3D structure analysis, B38-CAP homolog shares structural similarity to mammalian ACE2 with low sequence identity. In vitro, recombinant B38-CAP protein catalyzed the conversion of angiotensin II to angiotensin 1-7, as well as other known ACE2 target peptides. Treatment with B38-CAP suppressed angiotensin II-induced hypertension, cardiac hypertrophy, and fibrosis in mice. Moreover, B38-CAP inhibited pressure overload-induced pathological hypertrophy, myocardial fibrosis, and cardiac dysfunction in mice. Our data identify the bacterial B38-CAP as an ACE2-like carboxypeptidase, indicating that evolution has shaped a bacterial carboxypeptidase to a human ACE2-like enzyme. Bacterial engineering could be utilized to design improved protein drugs for hypertension and heart failure.",

When the RAS is activated, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) cleaves the C-terminus of deca-peptide angiotensin I (Ang I or Ang 1-10) to generate a vasopressor octa-peptide angiotensin II (Ang II or Ang 1-8). ACE2 was discovered as a human homolog of ACE in 2000 4, 5 . ACE2 is a negative regulator of the RAS, which catalyzes the conversion of Ang II to angiotensin 1-7 (Ang 1-7) and downregulates Ang II levels, thereby counterbalancing ACE activity [4] [5] [6] .",

To address whether there are any ACE2-like proteins in bacteria, we first searched published crystal structures of M32 carboxypeptidase in the database of MEROPS (http://merops.sanger.ac.uk/) and found that three microbial M32 carboxypeptidases are reported for their three-dimensional (3D) structures, including BS-CAP (or BsuCP) (B. subtilis), Taq (Thermus aquaticus), and Pfu (P. furiosus). Although BS-CAP, Taq, or Pfu showed low sequence identity to ACE2, we examined whether BS-CAP, Taq, or Pfu has structural similarity to human ACE2 by using the program of Molecular Operating Environment (Chemical Computing Group, Canada). The program detected only BS-CAP as a protein structurally related to ACE2 and the 3D structures of both proteins are mostly merged (Fig. 1a) . Importantly, the position of key amino acids constituting the catalytic site (His-Glu-X-X-His motif) and substrate-binding region (Arg273/348, His345/234, His505/408, and Tyr515/420 in ACE2/BS-CAP) were almost identical between both proteins, implicating that BS-CAP may have similar substrate preference to ACE2 (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Fig. 1 , and Supplementary Table 1) . Indeed, a previous study on BS-CAP structure had predicted that there may be structural similarity between ACE2 and BS-CAP 24 . We further searched for bacterial proteins that exhibit high sequence identity to BS-CAP in the BLAST and found that BA-CAP, a carboxypeptidase derived from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, is homologous to BS-CAP ( Table 1) . Furthermore, we found that our recently identified bacterial strain, Paenibacillus sp. B38, also has a similar M32 carboxypeptidase to BS-CAP with high sequence identity (Fig. 1b, Supplementary Fig. 1 , and Supplementary Table 1 ). We termed this Paenibacillus sp. B38derived M32 carboxypeptidase as B38-CAP hereafter. Despite evolutionally distant relationship to ACE2 (Fig. 1b) , these bacterial enzymes are likely homologs of ACE2 with divergent evolution.",

Indeed, the production of recombinant B38-CAP in E. coli (16.8 mg protein yield per culture volume (L)) was more efficient in terms of the recovered protein amount compared with the production of His-tagged rhACE2 in baculovirus-Sf9 insect cells (5.42 mg protein yield per culture volume (L)). Moreover, the time for culture and purification of B38-CAP (2 days) was shorter than that of rhACE2 (6 days, not including baculovirus preparation) (Supplementary Fig. 2a-d) . We first tested whether these enzymes have ACE2-like proteolytic activity to hydrolyze the fluorogenic peptide Nma-His-Pro-Lys(Dnp), which we had previously developed as a specific ACE2 substrate 19 . As a result, all the enzymes were revealed to catalyze the hydrolysis of the ACE2 substrate Nma-His-Pro-Lys (Dnp) (Fig. 1d and Table 1 ). When we incubated Ang II peptide with BS-CAP, BA-CAP, or B38-CAP in vitro, all of the enzymes converted Ang II to Ang 1-7 ( Fig. 1e and Supplementary Fig. 3a ). On the other hand, the dependency of ACE2-like enzymatic activity on anion (Cl \u2212 ) concentration is much higher in B38-CAP than in BS-CAP and BA-CAP (Fig. 1d) , suggesting that B38-CAP is the most potent in ACE2-like activity under physiological conditions of mammals. Analysis for kinetic constants with the fluorogenic ACE2 substrate revealed that B38-CAP has the same potency as rhACE2 protein (Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 3b) . Consistently, the IC 50 values of ACE2 inhibitor (MLN-4760) for B38-CAP and human ACE2 were almost equivalent (Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 3c ). In addition, the dependence of B38-CAP proteolytic activity on pH and temperature was also similar to that of ACE2 6, 19 (Supplementary Fig. 3d, e) . Moreover, when various and Supplementary Fig. 4a ). For non-ACE2-substrate peptides Ang 1-7 and angiotensin 1-9 (Ang 1-9), however, B38-CAP did cleave Ang 1-9, whereas it did not affect Ang 1-7 (Fig. 1f , g and Table 2 ). Consistently, B38-CAP converted Ang I to Ang 1-7 (Fig. 1h) , which is distinct from ACE2 conversion of Ang I to Ang 1-9 4 . To address how B38-CAP converts Ang I to Ang 1-7, we conducted kinetic analysis (Fig. 1i, j and Supplementary Fig. 4b ). Ang 1-9, Ang II, and Ang 1-7 peptides were detectable at 10 min after mixing Ang I with B38-CAP (Fig. 1j) . Ang 1-7 production increased and finally reached the same levels of the initial Ang I amount, whereas Ang I was undetectable at 90 min (Fig. 1i, j) . On the other hand, Ang 1-9 and Ang II exhibited a minor peak at 20 min and 60 min, respectively, and both peptides became undetectable at the end of the reaction period (Fig. 1j) . Consistent with peptide kinetics, the amino acids leucine (Leu), histidine (His), and phenylalanine (Phe) were generated in the same order as mono-carboxyl proteolysis of Ang I, Ang 1-9, and Ang II, respectively (Fig. 1j) , indicating that the conversion of Ang I to Ang 1-7 by B38-CAP is mediated through three steps of monocarboxyl proteolysis. Therefore, B38-CAP has an ACE2-like activity, which converts both Ang II and Ang I peptides to Ang 1-7 in vitro.",

Ang II (e), Ang 1-9 (f), Ang 1-7 (g), or Ang I (h) (5 nmol each) was incubated with vehicle, recombinant B38-CAP protein, or recombinant ACE2 protein (5 \u03bcg each) for 90 min, then subjected to HPLC analysis. i, j Kinetic analysis for hydrolysis of Ang I with B38-CAP. HPLC analysis of angiotensin peptides generated after incubating Ang I with B38-CAP (i, j, upper panel). Amino acids in the same samples were quantified with LC-MS system (j, lower panel). Experiments were repeated more than three times and representative chromatography charts are shown. j Values are means \u00b1 SEM. n = 3 independent experiments. developed B38-CAP-specific substrate Nma-Leu-Pro-Lys(Dnp). In 1 h after intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of B38-CAP (2 mg kg \u22121 i.p.), the concentration of B38-CAP in plasma was markedly increased and peaked (Fig. 2a) . The plasma B38-CAP levels gradually decreased to almost baseline at 8 h but it was still detectable in the plasma through 12 h (Fig. 2a) . Estimated initial half-life in systemic circulation was 3.5 h, which is almost similar to 1.8-8.5 h of rhACE2 25, 26 . We next examined whether B38-CAP treatment affects Ang II-induced elevation of BP. We first measured the BP in the carotid artery in anesthetized mice using a transducer catheter (Fig. 2b) . Intraperitoneal injection of Ang II (0.2 mg kg \u22121 i.p.) induced acute elevation of arterial BP in wildtype mice, whereas pretreatment of B38-CAP (2 mg kg \u22121 i.p.) significantly suppressed the Ang II-induced elevation of arterial pressure ( Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 5a -c). We next addressed the effects of B38-CAP on hypertension induced by chronic Ang II treatment. Although continuous infusion of Ang II with an osmotic mini-pump elevated BP as measured in conscious mice, daily i.p. injection of B38-CAP downregulated elevation of BP at days 8, 14, and 28 ( Supplementary Fig. 6a -e and Supplementary Fig. 7a -e). Furthermore, we tested whether continuous infusion of B38-CAP suppresses Ang II-induced hypertension (Fig. 2d ). When B38-CAP was infused subcutaneously using an osmotic mini-pump, B38-CAP was detectable in the plasma of mice for 14 days ( Supplementary Fig. 8a, b) . Although it had been reported that an immune response is associated with the chronic infusion of rhACE2 resulting in the degradation of rhACE2 26 , this was not observed for B38-CAP; there were no antibodies against B38-CAP detectable in the serum of mice infused with B38-CAP for 2 weeks ( Supplementary  Fig. 8c ). Implantation of B38-CAP-filled osmotic mini-pumps significantly suppressed Ang II-induced hypertension in conscious mice ( Fig. 2e -g) without affecting the heart rate (Fig. 2h) . These results indicate that B38-CAP antagonizes the vasopressor effect of Ang II.",

In the acute experiment with i.p. injection of Ang II (Fig. 2b) , pretreatment of B38-CAP markedly downregulated a massive increase of plasma Ang II levels at 5 min after Ang II injection (Fig. 2i) . Consistently, in the chronic experiment with continuous infusion of Ang II (Fig. 2d) , continuous infusion of B38-CAP with additional osmotic pump significantly decreased Ang II levels in the plasma at day 14 ( Fig. 2j) . As Ang 1-7 is known to exert beneficial effects in the cardiovascular systems through Mas/Ang 1-7 receptor 27 , we also measured Ang 1-7 levels in the plasma of these mice. Ang 1-7 levels in the plasma were significantly upregulated in both acute and chronic experimental settings (Fig. 2k, l) . On the other hand, when we cotreated the Ang II-injected mice with B38-CAP and A779, an antagonist for Mas/Ang 1-7 receptor, the suppressive effects of B38-CAP on Ang II-induced elevation of BP were not affected ( Fig. 2m and Supplementary Fig. 9a-d) . Furthermore, cotreatment of Ang 1-7 and Ang II did not downregulate Ang IIinduced elevation of BP ( Supplementary Fig. 9e-h) . Thus, the hypotensive effects of B38-CAP are primarily mediated through downregulation of Ang II levels.",

In addition, mild decrease of cardiac contractility in Ang II-infused mice were prevented by B38-CAP treatment as determined by % fractional shortening (%FS) ( Fig. 3f and Supplementary Table 2 ). Moreover, B38-CAP significantly prevented Ang II-induced cardiac fibrosis (Fig. 3g , h) and upregulation of fibrotic genes expression (Collagen 8a (Col8a1), Periostin (Postn), and TGF-\u03b22 (Tgfb2)) ( Fig. 3i-k) .

B38-CAP treatment significantly downregulated Ang II-induced increase of BP to the levels in vehicletreated control mice (Fig. 7b-e) . Thus, B38-CAP ameliorated established hypertension. Next, we investigated the effects of B38-CAP on established cardiac dysfunction. At 5 weeks after TAC surgery, the mice (C57BL/6J background) exhibits cardiac dysfunction with significant decrease of %FS (Fig. 7f, g) . The osmotic mini-pumps containing B38-CAP or vehicle were implanted at this time point and B38-CAP (2 mg kg \u22121 per day) was infused for 2 weeks. Treatment with B38-CAP significantly increased %FS as compared with that in vehicle-treated mice or in the mice before treatment ( Fig. 7g and Table 3 ), indicating that B38-CAP improved cardiac dysfunction. In addition, cardiac hypertrophy was significantly suppressed by B38-CAP treatment ( Fig. 7h-j) and pulmonary congestion was also improved by B38-CAP (Fig. 4k, l) .

B38-CAP also showed pH optimum of 7.5 equivalent to rhACE2 6, 19 . In addition, IC 50 of MLN-4760 was also equivalent between rhACE2 and B38-CAP. Although B38-CAP exhibited quite similar proteolytic activity to rhACE2, there seems a difference in substrate specificity between two enzymes. B38-CAP is likely to have more broad specificity for proteolytic effects on peptides, because B38-CAP converted Ang I and Ang 1-9 into Ang 1-7, whereas ACE2 does not cleave Ang 1-9. The superimposition of ACE2 and BS-CAP structures indicated that the positions of substrate-binding amino acid residues and metal-binding residues are matched. Although the ACE2 substrate Nma-His-Pro-Lys (Dnp) was cleaved by B38-CAP with the same potency as ACE2, we found that the Nma-Leu-Pro-Lys(Dnp) was catalyzed specifically by B38-CAP but not by ACE2 (not shown), suggesting that the S2-subsite of B38-CAP is more hydrophobic than ACE2. The difference in substrate specificity of B38-CAP and ACE2 should be further elucidated by our ongoing analysis for crystal structure of B38-CAP.",

On the other hand, in a previous study, rhACE2 showed similar antihypertrophic effects in both TAC and Ang II-infusion models 16 . The difference may be explained by the slight difference of substrate specificity of B38-CAP and ACE2. Although ACE2 converts Ang I to Ang 1-9 inefficiently and requires ACE for further conversion of Ang 1-9 to Ang 1-7 6 , B38-CAP targets all the Ang I, Ang 1-9, and Ang II peptides as a mono-carboxypeptidase. Thus, the conversion of Ang I and Ang II to Ang 1-7 by B38-CAP may contribute to more efficient down-modulation of RAS in the TAC heart failure. In addition, Ang 1-7 is a vasoprotective peptide which acts through its cognate Mas receptor, and also has anti-fibrotic and cardioprotective functions in heart failure 10 . Thus, B38-CAP-mediated degradation of Ang I into Ang 1-7 would be beneficial in enhancing Ang 1-7 generation for treating failing hearts. Furthermore, as ACE2 and B38-CAP target other biological peptides than angiotensin peptides, subtle differences in substrate specificity may license B38-CAP to degrade such peptides in a different manner or even to have a new peptide substrate different from ACE2 targets.",

On the other hand, although mass production of rhACE2 as a protein drug costs due to requirement of mammalian cell expression systems, B38-CAP is easily prepared with E. coli expression system and is cost effective. Therapeutic efficacy and less toxicity of B38-CAP in mouse heart failure models would warrant further investigation of B38-CAP or other microbial carboxypeptidases in disease models.

The reaction mixture was incubated at 37\u00b0C for 30 min and then the reaction was terminated by adding 0.2 ml of 0.1 M sodium borate buffer pH 10.5. The fluorescein intensity was measured spectrophotometrically at an emission wavelength 440 nm upon excitation wavelength 340 nm (Hitachi F-2500). The sample concentration required to inhibit 50% of B38-CAP activity under the assay condition was taken as the IC 50 value. For plasma B38-CAP activity measurements, we developed a new B38-CAPspecific substrate Nma-Leu-Pro-Lys(Dnp) by screening the amino acids of P2 position in Nma-X-Pro-Lys(Dnp) substrates (not shown), and the K m , k cat , and k cat /K m values using this substrate were determined to be 9.52 \u03bcM, 224 s \u22121 , and 23.5 s \u22121 \u03bcM \u22121 , respectively.
