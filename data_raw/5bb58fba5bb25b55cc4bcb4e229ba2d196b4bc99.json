            "text": "Infection of mammalian cells with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) results in the inhibition of cellular translation while viral translation proceeds efficiently. VSV RNA synthesis occurs entirely within the cytoplasm, where during transcription the viral polymerase produces 5 mRNAs that are structurally indistinct to cellular mRNAs with respect to their 5 0 cap-structure and 3 0 -polyadenylate tail. Using the global approach of massively parallel sequencing of total cytoplasmic, monosome-and polysome-associated mRNA, we interrogate the impact of VSV infection of HeLa cells on translation. Analysis of sequence reads in the different fractions shows >60% of total cytoplasmic and polysome-associated reads map to the 5 viral genes by 6 hours post-infection, a time point at which robust host cell translational shutoff is observed. Consistent with an overwhelming abundance of viral mRNA in the polysome fraction, the reads mapping to cellular genes were reduced. The cellular mRNAs that remain most polysome-associated following infection had longer half-lives, were typically larger, and were more AU rich, features that are shared with the viral mRNAs. Several of those mRNAs encode proteins known to positively affect viral replication, and using chemical inhibition and siRNA depletion we confirm that the host chaperone heat shock protein 90 (hsp90) and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3A (eIF3A)-encoded by 2 such mRNAs -support viral replication. Correspondingly, regulated in development and DNA damage 1 (Redd1) encoded by a host mRNA with reduced polysome association inhibits viral infection. These data underscore the importance of viral mRNA abundance in the shut-off of host translation in VSV infected cells and link the differential translatability of some cellular mRNAs with pro-or antiviral function.",

Those similarities necessitate a different mechanism for controlling viral versus host protein synthesis. We infected cells with vesicular stomatitis PLOS Pathogens | https://doi.virus and sequenced polysome-associated mRNAs at 2 and 6 hours post-infection providing 2 snapshots of how infection alters translation. We present evidence that the 5 viral mRNAs outcompete cellular mRNAs for ribosomes and demonstrate that individual host mRNAs vary in the extent to which their polysome association is altered by infection. Host mRNAs that are more abundant, have longer half-lives, greater than average length, and a similar AU content to the viral mRNAs were more likely to be enriched among polysome-associated cellular mRNAs. Several of the enriched mRNAs encode proteins that promote viral replication, whereas mRNAs that exhibit the largest decrease in polysome association include those that encode antiviral functions.",

            "text": "Introduction Infection of mammalian cells by vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) results in a profound shut-off of host cell gene expression. This host cell shut-off occurs at the level of mRNA transcription through inhibition of RNA polymerase II by the viral-encoded matrix protein (M) [1] [2] [3] . The M protein also forms a complex with ribonucleic acid export 1 (Rae1) and nucleoporin 98 (Nup98) [4] thus suppressing host cell mRNP export from the nucleus, including that of mature cellular mRNAs [5] [6] [7] [8] . VSV infection also inhibits protein synthesis by manipulation of the host-cell translation machinery, particularly at the level of translation initiation [9, 10] . Eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E)-the rate limiting factor for translation initiation-recognizes the 7 m GpppN mRNA cap structure as part of the eIF4F complex, and in concert with other translation initiation factors facilitates the recruitment of the small 40S ribosomal subunit to the mRNA prior to scanning to the initiating methionine where the 60S subunit joins [11, 12] . VSV infection results in the rapid dephosphorylation of eIF4E itself, for which the functional consequences are unclear, and of its binding protein (eIF4E-BP1) leading to eIF4E sequestration and the suppression of translation initiation [9, 10] .",

As VSV RNA synthesis occurs entirely within the cytoplasm, viral RNA synthesis is not subject to the inhibitory effects of M on RNA polymerase II and mRNA export from the nucleus. The VSV RNA synthesis machinery comprises a ribonucleoprotein complex of the negative-sense genomic RNA completely encased by a nucleocapsid protein (N) sheath and associated with the viral polymerase complex [13] . The viral transcriptase copies the N-RNA template into 5 monocistronic mRNAs that are structurally indistinct to those of the host-cell with respect to their 5 0 cap and 3 0 polyadenylate tail [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . The enzymes necessary for mRNA synthesis, namely an RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and a set of capping enzymes, reside within the viral large protein (L) [17, 19, [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] . VSV L protein cannot engage the N-RNA template directly, but instead depends on the viral phoshoprotein (P) to facilitate the interaction [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] . Messenger RNA polyadenylation is also catalyzed by L through reiterative transcription by the RdRp of a U7 tract that resides at the end of each gene [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] . This program of viral transcription results in the cytoplasmic synthesis of 5 mRNAs that depend upon the host machinery for their translation, and must therefore avoid the shut-down mechanisms that effectively suppress host mRNA translation.",

Inhibition of host protein synthesis is, however, largely unaffected following coinfection of cells with increasing quantities of defective interfering (DI) particles that suppress viral mRNA levels up to 14-fold [41] . A similar result was obtained for a VSV mutant that is restricted for genome replication at 39\u02daC, and yields only 30% of the wild type levels of viral mRNA [41] .

The 5 0 untranslated regions of VSV mRNAs are short, being 10-15 nucleotides for the viral N, P and L mRNAs that encode the proteins required for RNA replication [42, 43] . How such short 5 0 UTRs serve as effective initiators of translation is unclear. Evidence for differential translation of viral mRNA comes from small interfering RNA suppression of eIF4E, which inhibits host gene expression but has no impact on viral gene expression [44] . Viral translation is also hypersensitive to the loss of ribosomal protein L40, suggesting different mRNA features facilitate translation of viral versus host mRNA [45] . Flanking cellular or reporter genes by the conserved viral 10-nt gene-start and 13-nt gene-end sequences, and inserting them into the viral genome is sufficient to mediate their efficient translation [46] . By contrast, expression of the same genes following transfection of plasmid DNA into cells and subsequent VSV infection does not offer this translational advantage [46] . Thus, transcription of the mRNAs from the viral genome appears to contribute to their efficient translation.",

By combining this RNAseq analysis with examining the distribution of specific viral and cellular mRNAs within polysomes, we also demonstrate that mRNAs shift to smaller polysomes. Analysis of cellular mRNAs less-sensitive to this global shut-down of translation identifies several host proteins that promote viral replication.

For this analysis we divided the polysome TPM by the total cytoplasmic TPM as an indicator of the efficiency with which any given mRNA is translated. We also performed a similar analysis for the monosome pool. We are cognizant of the fact that such ratios ignore the movement of any given mRNA from larger to smaller polysomes, and will likely represent an underestimate of the extent of any translational regulation. To identify the subset of the population of cellular mRNAs with the highest probability for translational regulation in infected cells, we plotted the fold change in TPM at 2 and 6 hpi (Fig 3A-3D ). At 2 hpi the monosome or polysome-associated reads changed within a narrow range for the majority of cellular genes ( Fig 3A) . The marked shut-off of host protein synthesis observed by metabolic labeling suggests that at 6 hpi the association of cellular mRNA with polyribosomes would alter significantly at the population level. Although we observe a global reduction in polysome-associated reads for the bulk of the population of cellular mRNAs the reduction is less than 2-3 fold. Accompanying this global reduction in polysome-associated reads, we also observe an increase in monosome-associated reads with more than half the mRNAs within the population exhibiting a >2-fold increase (Fig 3B and 3D ). From the above ratios we selected the subset of cellular mRNAs that exhibit the largest changes in relative polysome-associated reads at 6 hpi to determine whether those mRNAs shared any common features. For this purpose, we selected those mRNAs that change >2 standard deviations of the mean and thus exceed the 95% confidence interval. This analysis identified 364 cellular mRNAs as candidates for translational upregulation and 138 cellular mRNAs as candidates for translational downregulation following VSV infection (Fig 3B and 3D ). Consistent with monosome and polysomeassociated reads at 2 hpi changing within a narrow range, only 4 genes with increased and 20 with decreased polysome association, overlap between 2 and 6 hpi (Fig 3C and 3D ). Within the monosome fraction 8 genes with increased and 6 with decreased monosome association overlap from 2 to 6 hpi.",

To determine whether there are shared features between the 364 mRNAs with evidence of enhanced polysome association or the 138 with reduced polysome association, we extracted mRNA sequences and annotations from the UCSC Genome Browser. Assisted by published datasets we examined whether the half-life, size, GC content or poly(A) tail length correlate with increased or decreased polysome association (Fig 4C-4F and S2 Fig) [54, 55] . Cellular mRNAs with increased polysome-associated reads tended to have a longer half-life, were typically larger, and were more AU-rich ( Fig 4C-4E and S2 Fig) . Correspondingly, those with decreased polysome-associated reads tended to have shorter half-lives, higher GC content, and were typically smaller. The correlation between higher AU content and increased polysome-associated reads was most evident for the coding region and 3 0 UTR (S2 Fig). The effect of length was predominantly a determinant of the ORF and not the 5 0 or 3 0 UTR (S2 Fig). There was no correlation between poly(A) tail length and polysome-associated reads at 6 hpi ( Fig 4F) . This analysis highlights that the cellular mRNAs that exceed the 95% confidence interval for increased polysome-associated reads in response to VSV infection are most similar to the viral mRNAs in that they are typically longer and more AU rich.",

Infection of HeLa cells with VSV that expresses eGFP as a marker of infection demonstrates that 17-DMAG has no effect on the fraction of cells infected, but slows the rate of eGFP expression ( Fig 5A and S3  Fig) . This was not simply due to defects in eGFP folding, as metabolic labeling of viral RNA substantiates the defect in gene expression (S3 Fig) .",

To test whether this reflects a specific proviral function of eIF3a, we used siRNA depletion to reduce eIF3a and measured viral gene expression using reporter viruses expressing eGFP or luciferase. Both reporter viruses displayed a sensitivity to the loss of eIF3a (Figs 5B and S3). As expected, depletion of eIF3a also reduced cellular translation in uninfected cells, but that reduction was modest as evidenced by expression of a CMV promoter driven renilla luciferase reporter ( Fig 5B) . Translation of the CMV driven reporter, however, reflects the accumulated steady-state levels of luciferase mRNA. We therefore measured the effect of eIF3a depletion on viral vs host translation by metabolic incorporation of [ 35 S]-methionine in infected and uninfected cells (Fig 5B) . Following eIF3a depletion we observed a 55% reduction in viral M protein synthesis over a 30 minute time period, which is similar to the 56% reduction in host protein synthesis measured in mock infected cells.

Existing studies demonstrate that DDIT4/Redd1 restricts the replication of negative-strand RNA viruses, including VSV. Depletion of DDIT4/Redd1 by siRNA increased viral gene expression as evidenced from infection of cells with VSV-eGFP, and by metabolic labeling of viral protein synthesis (Fig 5C, S3 Fig) . Consistent with the enhancement of viral gene expression following DDIT4 depletion, we obtained an approximately 10-fold increase in viral titers ( Fig 5C) . Depletion of DDIT4/Redd1 also increases cellular protein synthesis likely reflecting its role as a negative regulator of mTOR ( Fig 5C and S3 Fig) .",

To independently examine whether changes in polysome association of host mRNAs affect synthesis of the corresponding protein we selected the heat shock protein (HSP70) and Y-box binding protein 1 (YBX1) as representative mRNAs with increased and decreased polysome association, respectively. We selected those mRNAs based on their highlevels of expression, stability, and availability of antibodies suitable for the selective immunoprecipitation of the corresponding protein. We compared the effect of VSV infection on protein synthesis by selective immunoprecipitation of proteins following metabolic incorporation of [ 35 S]-methionine from 3-6 hours post infection (Fig 5D) . Synthesis of HSP70 3-6 hpi is indistinguishable to that synthesized during a 3h period from mock infected cells (Fig 5D) . By contrast, YBX1 synthesis decreases more than two-fold ( Fig 5D) . This result confirms for 2 cellular mRNAs that the extent of polysome association observed by our RNAseq analysis is reflected in synthesis of the corresponding host proteins.

As a result, we do not assess the impact of the redistribution of mRNAs toward smaller polysomes. We therefore selected a subset of cellular mRNAs (Fig 6A) , and interrogated their distributions across polysomes using reverse transcription and quantitative PCR. As controls, we analyzed the distribution of N and G mRNAs as representative viral transcripts translated by soluble and endoplasmic reticulum-associated ribosomes, respectively [64] . Consistent with the robust production of viral proteins at 6 hpi, the VSV N and G mRNAs were localized in fractions corresponding to 3 or more ribosomes (Fig 6B) . For two cellular mRNAs with increased polysome TPM-collagen type IV alpha 2 (COL4A2) and alpha-actinin-4 mRNA (ACTN4)-the mRNAs remained associated with larger polysomes in infected cells (Fig 6C) . Two cellular transcripts that were largely unaltered in their polysome associated TPM-\u03b2-actin (ACTB) and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)-remained polysome-associated, although there was a shift toward smaller polysomes and some GAPDH transcripts exited polysomes (Fig 6D) . For two representative cellular mRNAs with decreased polysome TPM-transforming growth factor B induced factors (TGIF1) and ubiquitin conjugating enzyme E2 B (UBE2B)-the mRNAs largely exited the polysome fractions, and those that remained were predominantly present on smaller polysomes ( Fig 6E) . In all cases examined, dissociation of polysomes with EDTA shifted the mRNA distribution toward the fractions corresponding to free ribosomal subunits (S4 Fig). These qPCR data highlight the shift towards smaller polysome fractions for some cellular mRNAs, which also likely contributes to suppression of host protein synthesis. This shift might also explain our finding that HSP70 protein synthesis is relatively unaffected by viral infection (Fig 5D) , although the mRNA exhibits increased polysome association.",

Recognition of the mRNA cap-structure by eIF4E requires that the guanine-N-7 position of the 7mGpppNmN cap is methylated [65] . We previously reported a panel of recombinant VSVs containing amino acid substitutions within the L-encoded mRNA cap methylase domain that are defective in viral mRNA cap methylation [25] . Mutants VSV-L G4A and VSV-L G1670A contain substitutions in the binding site for the methyl donor s-adenosyl methionine (SAM) and ablate all viral mRNA cap methylation (VSV-L G4A ) or guanine-N7 but not ribose-2 0 -O methylation (VSV-L G1670A ) [25] . As VSV mRNA is relatively insensitive to the loss of eIF4E [44] , we would anticipate that the methylation status of the mRNA cap-structure would have little impact on polysome association.

Depletion of eIF4E decreased the rate of viral protein synthesis in VSV-L 1670A infected cells, but not L WT infected cells ( Fig  7E and 7F) . This was not due to sequestration of eIF4E by differential activation of eIF4E-BP1 between VSV-L WT and VSV-L G1607A infected cells, as the kinetics of eIF4E-BP1 dephosphorylation are the same during both infections (S6 Fig).

We also obtained further insight into the seemingly paradoxical observations that viral infection results in a reduction of the available pool of eIF4E -the rate limiting factor for translation initiation-yet viral mRNAs contain a cap structure that is indistinct to that of host mRNAs. Through the use of a viral mutant defective in mRNA cap methylation, and suppression of eIF4E levels we provide evidence consistent with a transition from an eIF4E dependent phase of viral translation to one less-dependent on eIF4E.",

            "text": "The sequence data reported here provides some support for the model that the VSV mRNAs overwhelm the pool of cellular mRNA leading to a redistribution of ribosomes onto viral messages [39] . Evidence in support of this model is based on massively parallel sequencing of mRNAs associated with polysomes, compared with those present in the cytoplasm. As a fraction of the total cytoplasmic mRNA, the VSV mRNAs represent~1% by 2 hpi, but more than 60% by 6 hpi, illustrating the power of exponential amplification of the viral genome. As a result, the viral N, P, M and G mRNAs far exceed the abundance of any given cellular mRNA, and even the least abundant viral mRNA-that encoding the L polymerase-is present at similar levels to the most abundant cellular mRNA. Thus, one contributor to host cell shut-off in VSV infected cells appears to relate to the synthetic capabilities of the viral polymerase in transcription of viral mRNA. Similar conclusions have recently been reached for other viruses. Infection of cells with mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) a positive-strand RNA coronavirus that replicates within the cytoplasm results in 80-90% of the cytoplasmic mRNA being viral by 5 hpi [47] . For influenza A virus, a segmented negative-strand RNA virus that replicates in the nucleus, >50% of the total mRNA in the cytoplasm is viral [48] . In this case however, the viral endonuclease PA-X degrades cellular mRNA which further contributes to the dominance of viral mRNA [66, 67] . For vaccinia virus, a DNA virus that replicates entirely within the cytoplasm, degradation of host mRNA through the viral encoded decapping enzymes D9 and D10 also helps the viral mRNAs overwhelm those of the host cell [49, 68, 69] . Collectively these studies indicate that one shared mechanism for host cell shut-off in virus-infected cells is competition for host cell ribosomes through tipping the balance between viral and host mRNA.",

            "text": "We also obtained evidence in support of additional mechanisms that contribute to host cell shut-off in VSV infected cells. We confirmed earlier work that demonstrated a suppression of the pool of the rate limiting factor for initiation, eIF4E, by altering the phosphorylation status of its negative regulator, eIF4E-BP1, which results in eIF4E sequestration [9] . Differences in sensitivity to reductions in eIF4E may contribute to the overrepresentation of cellular mRNA we observe in monosome fractions during infection. We also provide new evidence in support of a phase of VSV gene expression that is dependent on eIF4E through the use of a viral mutant partially defective in guanine-N7 methylation [25] and by the suppression of cellular pools of eIF4E. When eIF4E levels are suppressed 10-fold, we unmask a defect in viral protein synthesis in cells infected with VSV-VSV-L G1670A a mutant with a 4-fold defect in methylation at the guanine-N7-position of the cap-structure. We suspect that this significantly underestimates the eIF4E dependent phase of viral replication since transformed cell lines, like the HeLa cells used here, have higher constitutive levels of eIF4E [70] . Our findings are consistent with a model where viral mRNAs initially compete with cellular mRNAs and translate in an eIF4E dependent manner. As infection progresses and the shut-down of host transcription, mRNA export and eIF4E sequestration continue, the process of initiation is increasingly less dependent on eIF4E. The mechanism by which the viral mRNAs become less dependent on eIF4E remains uncertain, but earlier studies demonstrate that neither the 5 0 or 3 0 UTR of viral mRNAs facilitate this efficient translation. Ongoing transcription of viral mRNA from the viral genome has also been linked to efficient protein synthesis [46, 71] . Whether this reflects the fact that the virus is an efficient producer of mRNA that supports the competition model, or whether there is a temporal requirement for continued viral mRNA synthesis is uncertain.",

Several host mRNAs increased in polysome association include genes with known \"proviral\" functions for entry and replication including heparan sulfate, clathrin, and HSP90 [56, [72] [73] [74] . Similarly, host mRNAs with decreased polysome association included genes with published roles in restricting VSV replication such as interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1), DDIT4, and TXNIP [62, 63, 75] . It is difficult to definitively determine whether this reflects evolution of the virus to contend with the environment in which it finds itself or a bona-fide pro and antiviral effect of a given host protein. Our efforts to address this are confounded by the essential house-keeping nature of many of the proteins encoded by host mRNAs that remain polysome associated. An example of this is provided by enhanced polysome association of eIF3a on VSV infection-a protein that is required for assembly of the multisubunit eIF3 complex. That complex also includes eIF3d which has demonstrated cap-binding ability, and directs eIF4E-independent translation of select mRNAs [76] [77] [78] [79] . Depletion of eIF3A, however, resulted in an equivalent reduction in the rates of viral and host translation-inconsistent with a specialized need for eIF3 components in VSV protein synthesis.",

Although synthesis of HSP70 did not increase per se, this is likely explained by the shifting of many cellular mRNAs towards smaller polysomes. This finding highlights the fact that the designation of RNAs as having \"increased\" or \"decreased\" polysome association is imprecise, and reflects the complexities of how any given host gene is regulated. Nevertheless, the general finding that mRNAs with \"increased\" polysome association on VSV infection are typically larger, have longer half-lives and higher AU content-features that are shared with the viral mRNA-highlights commonalities among mRNAs that remain polysome-associated and thus are more efficient in competing for ribosomes during host shut-off. The cellular mRNAs that exhibit reduced translation efficiency were shorter, have shorter half-lives and higher GC content. Although we validated changes in translatability and differential impacts on viral gene expression for a few cellular genes, it would be of significant interest to perform stable isotope labelling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) to non-radioactively label newly synthesized cellular proteins, quantify them on a genome-wide scale and correlate those data with the RNAseq results presented here.",

Precisely where the tipping point between viral and host mRNA levels with respect to this shut-off occurs is uncertain. For VSV, a viral mutant that makes less mRNA than the wild type yet still exhibits host cell shut-off suggests that shut-off can be achieved with less than the 60% of total cytoplasmic mRNA observed here [41] . Additional work will be required to define whether a specific tipping point exists and how this is influenced by other viral strategies such as eIF4E suppression or blocking host gene transcription.",
