Non-influenza viral illnesses may be less common, but also likely to disrupt usual activities and cause increased school absenteeism. Quantifying school absenteeism due to specific viruses can help target prevention or treatment strategies to reduce burden in school-aged children.",

Consenting patients completed an enrollment interview and provided a nose and throat swab for influenza testing. From the enrollment interviews, we obtained information on age, race/ethnicity, self-reported health status prior to the onset of illness, illness onset date, and symptoms. Vaccination status was obtained from the validated vaccine registry that serves the population. 11 Approximately 1 week following enrollment, all influenza-positive patients and approximately 50 influenza-negative patients per week were contacted for a follow-up interview. For children, interviews were conducted with a parent or guardian and included questions about when the child returned to normal activities, how many days the child missed school due to the illness (numerically open-ended), and medications prescribed and taken. The answer to the question, \"how many days of school did your child miss, due to this illness\" was used to assess school absenteeism. Responses larger than the maximum number of weekdays between illness onset and follow-up interviews were truncated to the maximum weekdays within the interval (nine observations were truncated).",

First, patients testing positive for influenza were notified of test results within 2 days of study enrollment, prior to their follow-up interview. Parent's knowledge of their child's influenza status may have affected their behavior and school attendance. Knowledge of a known illness may have kept the child out of school longer than an illness without confirmation of etiology. Second, our study likely underestimated the burden of school absenteeism due to respiratory illness because our study population was restricted to children with medically attended illness and did not assess children who did not seek care. In a household cohort, 38% of ARIs occurred in school-aged children and approximately 20% of all ARI cases were medically attended.1 The proportion medically attended varied by viral etiology. Additionally, enrollment for our study was restricted to the influenza season and did not capture viral respiratory illnesses that occurred outside this period, likely underestimating the burden of medically attended illnesses due to viruses other than influenza. However, including only medically attended illnesses would lead to overestimation of the average duration of absenteeism. Finally, we did not test for coinfections among those identified with influenza from the influenza VE study in all seasons or bacterial pathogens.During the influenza season, excess illness and school absenteeism is expected.36,37 Our study confirmed the substantial burden of influenza F I G U R E 2 Adjusted a mean days absent and prolonged absence by viral infection. a Adjusted for age and health status in negative binomial regression models and age in logistic regression models. Panel A excludes participants with adenovirus and coinfections. Panel B excludes children who were vaccinated within 14 d of illness onset or were not considered adequately vaccinated according to the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices Adjusted mean days absent and 95% CI on school-aged children, but likely underestimates school absenteeism due to other and less-severe viral respiratory illnesses. We noted increased school absenteeism among children with medically attended influenza compared to children with other viral infections, including RSV, but no differences in school absenteeism among children with medically attended influenza by vaccination status. Additional studies are needed among children who develop influenza despite vaccination to determine whether influenza vaccine can reduce disease severity and duration, and subsequently school absenteeism. RSV vaccines are currently undergoing pre-licensure clinical trials in both children and adults.",
