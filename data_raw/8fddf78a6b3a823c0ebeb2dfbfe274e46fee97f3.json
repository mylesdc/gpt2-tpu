Meta-transcriptomics provides insights into disease etiology by cataloguing and comparing sequences from suspected pathogens. This method is a powerful approach to simultaneously evaluate both the viral and bacterial communities, but few studies have applied this technique in marine systems. In 2009 seven harbor seals, Phoca vitulina, stranded along the California coast from a similar brain disease of unknown cause of death (UCD). We evaluated the differences between the virome and microbiome of UCDs and harbor seals with known causes of death. Here we determined that UCD stranded animals had no viruses in their brain tissue. However, in the bacterial community, we identified Burkholderia and Coxiella burnetii as important pathogens associated with this stranding event. Burkholderia were 100% prevalent and~2.8 log2 fold more abundant in the UCD animals. Further, while C. burnetii was found in only 35.7% of all samples, it was highly abundant (~94% of the total microbial community) in a single individual. In this harbor seal, C. burnetii showed high transcription rates of invading and translation genes, implicating it in the pathogenesis of this animal. Based on these data we propose that Burkholderia taxa and C. burnetii are potentially important opportunistic neurotropic pathogens in UCD stranded harbor seals.",

Unfortunately, harbor seals have not been the only marine mammals affected by this virus; strandings of pinnipeds and cetaceans has led to the discovery of four new morbillivirus types (PDV, CMV, CDV, and MSMV). The importance of these discoveries is evident in the number of morbillivirus cases that are now easily diagnosed, and that better treatments to prevent outbreaks are currently underway [17, 18] .

According to necropsy reports, due to the coincident timing of animals affected and the lesions in the brain the most parsimonious explanation of this mortality event was a viral agent. Immunochemistry tests were negative for West Nile virus, canine distemper virus, feline coronavirus, and canine parvoviruses, but two UCD samples were PCR positive for phocine herpesvirus-1 (PhV-1). Regardless the veterinarians did not attribute PhV-1 as the cause of death in these animals, as there was no evidence of a herpes viral infection in tissues typically infected by PhV-1. The cause of death varied for the other seven harbor seals that we will refer to here as the \"comparative\" sample group. Three of the samples from the comparative group were also diagnosed with PhV-1 by PCR.

Here we applied this technique to archived marine mammal brain tissues in an attempt to identify the causative agent of a spring 2009 harbor seal stranding event along the Californian coast. The brain tissues of these animals had signs suggestive of an infectious viral or abiotic disease. Yet, although it was originally hypothesized that a viral infection was the culprit of UCD sample deaths, we conclude that this harbor seal stranding event was likely not caused by any known viral agent because UCD animals had no viral read similarities. Alternatively, the viral type that caused the death of these animals could be divergent enough that the viral database used for annotation could not recognize this virus. Moreover, it may be possible that sequencing was either not deep enough to detect certain viral genomes or transcripts within the background of the host and bacterial reads or that rRNA removal methods eliminated important viral sequences as reported in [36] . However, other studies report an increase in viral reads with the use of rRNA removal for viral enrichment [37] . Regardless, other viral enrichment methods could potentially eliminate these combined issues [38] . Lastly, it is a possibility that due to late stage of the disease, the viral pathogen was either no longer present in the tissue samples or at a stage in its lifecycle where transcription was concluded and therefore undetectable using these methods.",

Our deep sequencing methods, detected PhV-1 in PhV-1 infected comparative samples, but not in PhV-1 infected UCD samples. Unlike comparative samples, veterinarians did not attribute PhV-1 to cause disease in UCD animals because tissues had no signs of a herpes viral infection and PhV-1 was not found in other tissues. Thus this may imply that PCR results in UCD samples may have been PCR positive due to the presence of a latent viral infection where transcripts are present but at very low abundances [39, 40] and thus were not captured with our methods. Therefore, sequencing of cDNA may be more effective at identifying active viral (versus latent) infections, but further studies need to be conducted.",

Our findings are in line with previous brain metagenomes that reported Proteobacteria to be the most abundant phylum in human and nonhuman primate brains regardless of health state [41] . In our study, we found that the only adult in our analysis had the most disparate microbial community. This might have been due to the age of the animal or a difference in disease microbial community progression. It would be interesting to evaluate metagenomes of additional adults to determine if adult harbor seals have different brain microbiomes from their pup/weaning counterparts. Furthermore, out of the 50 significantly differentiated bacterial taxa, we found that only Burkholderia cDNAs were significantly higher in UCD samples. The importance of Burkholderia in UCD samples was also apparent by the high prevalence of this genus, and the relatively higher Burkholderia specific virulence factors in UCD animals. Therefore, this may be indicative of an opportunistic neurotropic pathogen common in the 2009 harbor seal pup-stranding event.",

Interestingly, C. burnetii antibodies have been found in 34% of healthy harbor seals in the Pacific Northwest of the USA [44] . In our sample size of 14 harbor seals, we were able to identify a similar prevalence of Coxiella (35.7%).

The second most abundant region had a 1,276X coverage and had no assignment in the BLAST database. Due to its high abundance and lack of annotation, we hypothesize that this may be a regulatory RNA produced during active infections, and we plan to investigate this in the future study. Alternatively, this can potentially be C. burnetii DNA contamination that was not eliminated during the DNase procedure, although, this hypothesis seems unlikely due to the extensive 9 hr.

It is key to note that while our methods were able to detect various bacterial signatures, bacterial pathogens likely did not cause the death of these animals. This is because necropsy reports did not note any signs or brain lesions from bacteria as the cause death. Therefore, significant bacteria pathogens detected in this study such as Burkholderia and C. burnetii are more likely opportunistic pathogens in these animals. Future work will focus on the transcriptome of these individuals to try to identify if an abiotic source contributed to the deaths of these animals.
