Although these properties are well established, the mechanisms of action are not completely understood. In this study, GA and GRA were tested for the ability to inhibit rotavirus replication in cell culture, toward a long term goal of discovering natural compounds that may complement existing vaccines. Methods: Epithelial cells were treated with GA or GRA various times pre-or post-infection and virus yields were measured by immunofluorescent focus assay. Levels of viral proteins VP2, VP6, and NSP2 in GRA treated cells were measured by immunoblot to determine if there was an effect of GRA treatment on the accumulation of viral protein.",

Time of addition experiments indicated that GRA-mediated replication inhibition likely occurs at a step or steps subsequent to virus entry. The amounts of VP2, VP6 and NSP2 were substantially reduced when GRA was added to cultures up to two hours postentry. Conclusions: GRA, but not GA, has significant antiviral activity against rotavirus replication in vitro, and studies to determine whether GRA attenuates rotavirus replication in vivo are underway.",

Recent estimates indicate 2.7 million cases occur each year in the U.S. and 600,000 deaths occur annually worldwide (reviewed in [1] ). Available data on two attenuated vaccines show they both are efficacious in reducing the incidence and severity of rotavirus gastroenteritis in the U.S. and other developed countries [2] [3] [4] [5] . Reported vaccine efficacy is lower in developing nations where the majority of deaths from rotavirus infections occur, likely due to multiple factors including suboptimal immune responses associated with poor nutritional status or concurrent enteric infections [4, 6, 7] . Methods to enhance natural disease resistance find value in these regions if protective immunity could be improved by complementing existing vaccines with products that have antiviral or immune adjuvant activity.",

Both GA and GRA have been studied in several systems to evaluate their immunomodulatory properties. GA has been used in Japan for >20 years to treat chronic viral hepatitis, and patients administered a continuous regimen of an intravenous formulation of GA (Stronger Neo-Minophagen C W , SNMC) demonstrate clinical improvement and reduced incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma [13] [14] [15] [16] . GA also has been studied in an animal model of viral infection. Mice administered GA intraperitoneally survived a lethal dose of influenza virus [17] . Antibody to IFN\u03b3 abolished this protective effect, but the mechanisms of protection in this model system remain unclear. While mechanisms of action in vivo are not well understood, they likely are multi-factorial and could be due to direct effects on virus replication, or functions associated with modulation of inflammatory and cell protective responses.",

Subsequently, GA was shown to have antiviral activity against viruses in several families including flaviviruses, herpesviruses, influenza virus, SARS coronavirus, hepatitis C virus and others (reviewed in [19] ). Suggested mechanisms of activity in these systems include direct effects on the adsorption, penetration and particle maturation steps of the replication cycle and in some cases, direct inactivation of virus particles. For example, anti-influenza virus activity of GA in cell culture was attributed to interference with viral endocytosis, likely due to its ability to modulate membrane fluidity [20, 21] , although alternative mechanisms recently have been proposed [22] .",

For example, in vitro, GRA induces NF\u0138B-mediated nitric oxide synthase expression in macrophages [24] , and IL-8 expression in epithelial cells [25] . Others studies also suggest potential anti-inflammatory activity associated with reduced cytokine expression and attenuation of NF\u0138B activation [26, 27] . In vivo, protective efficacy of GRA against protozoan and bacterial infections has been demonstrated. In a mouse model of visceral leishmaniasis [24, 28] , analysis of pro-inflammatory cytokine transcripts in isolated spleen cells from infected animals revealed that GRA induces IFN\u03b3, TNF\u03b1, and IL-12, indicative of a T H 1 and curative response.

We performed an extended titration in this study and included GA, for which cytotoxicity in these cells had not previously been tested. MA104 cells were treated with serial dilutions of GA or GRA, and cytotoxicity was measured following six hours of incubation. The data shown in Figure 1 indicate that concentrations of 10 \u03bcg/ mL and 25 \u03bcg/mL GRA showed only approximately 7% and 15% reductions in cell viability, respectively, at this time point. Extension of incubations past 24 hours resulted in significant cytotoxicity (data not shown). In contrast to GRA, GA was cytotoxic only at the highest concentration tested of 10 mg/mL. Each compound was used in the remainder of the experiments at a final concentration of 25 \u03bcg/mL. GRA reduces rotavirus infectivity while GA has no effect A previous time course of the effects of GRA on rotavirus replication showed an approximately 40% reduction in infectivity of bovine rotavirus strain NCDV when cells were treated as few as six hours prior to infection [25] . The prior experiments measured replication at a low multiplicity of infection (0.01 pfu/cell) over a long course of infection, and measured cell-associated virus. The current experiments were designed to measure one round of replication at a higher multiplicity of infection (three pfu/cell) so that we could begin to decipher mechanisms of inhibition that did not include cell-to-cell spread. To test inhibitory effects of GA and GRA on rotavirus infectivity, each compound was added to cells either six hours prior to RRV infection, or following the adsorption step. Cultures then were harvested six hours post-infection, and infectious virus was titered by IFA. In contrast to previous studies using a low multiplicity of infection, pre-treatment only did not significantly reduce virus titers under the conditions of these experiments ( Figure 2 ). In contrast, GRA treatment resulted in a 99% reduction in infectivity when the compound was continuously present (pre/post) or when added post-infection only (post). This level of reduction in virus yields cannot be explained by simple cytotoxic effects on the cells at the degree defined by the toxicity assays. GA had no effect on virus yield whether the compound was added pre-or post-infection, as titers did not differ significantly from mock treated, infected controls. Therefore, GA was not investigated further.",

Figure 4A shows there was a substantial reduction in the amount of VP2 and VP6 in GRA treated cells. Evidence that virus replication was occurring and measurable at this time point was provided by detection of NSP2, the levels of which also were significantly reduced in treated cells compared to untreated cells. To further assess the reduction in the amount of VP2, VP6, and NSP2 in treated cells, the * * same experiment was performed, except that GRA was added two hours following the 37\u00b0C incubation. The results indicated that the degree of reduction in VP2 was similar to the previous experiment ( Figure 4B ). The amounts of VP6 and NSP2 still were diminished. However, they were higher than those observed when GRA was added one hour following the 37\u00b0C incubation. While one interpretation of these results suggests addition of GRA at later times post-adsorption may diminish its effects on levels of viral protein and consequently virus titers, the observation that the level of VP2 remained low suggests other mechanisms are at play.",

A) RRV stocks were incubated with 25 \u03bcg/mL GRA or DMSO for one hour at 37\u00b0C.

Data were analyzed for significance with the two-tailed Student's t test. Error bars indicate SEM. p < 0.004. under investigation. There are ample data to suggest antiviral activity of GA in vivo may result from induction of cytoprotective and immunomodulatory responses rather than effects on virus-specific functions per se, and such mechanisms of action could in part explain its broadspectrum activity (reviewed in [32] . In contrast to GA, fewer reports of in vivo activity of GRA are available. However, when administered intravenously, GA is metabolized in the liver by lysosomal \u03b2-D-glucoronidase into 3-mono-glucoronide-glycyrrhetinic acid, and then finally by glucoronidases of intestinal bacteria into GRA, which then can be reabsorbed [11, 12, 34] . Therefore, it is possible that some of the in vivo effects of GA are due to one or more of its metabolites, including GRA. We have shown that GRA reduces rotavirus yields during a single round of replication in MA104 cells whereas GA does not. Given numerous reports of antiviral activity of GA in vitro, it was somewhat surprising that GA did not effect rotavirus replication. However, inhibitory activity of GA may have a preference for enveloped viruses, consistent with potential mechanisms of action attributed to its effects on membrane fluidity.",

These data are consistent with previous studies illustrating a similar effect of GA on in vitro replication of NDV, VSV, HSV-1, and VV when the compound was added several hours post-infection [18] . Interestingly, the amount of VP2 present when GRA was added two-hours post-entry was similar to the levels observed when GRA was added one hour postentry , but the amounts of VP6 and NSP2 were considerably higher.

For example, we have shown that GRA induces NF\u0138B activation in MA104 cells [25] , and more recently reported that some rotavirus strains down-regulate NF\u0138B activity through the functions of nonstructural protein NSP1 [35] . NF\u0138B activity is required for induction of a robust antiviral response, and sustained activation of NF\u0138B by GRA could override virus-encoded mechanisms that down-regulate its activity, resulting in reduced virus replication. Other studies also report GRA-mediated activation of NF\u0138B [24, 28] . Of note, however, are reports showing GRA inhibits NF\u0138B activation, and this has been interpreted as GRA-mediated regulation of the inflammatory response [22, 26, 36] . In these and other studies, the effects of GRA on NF\u0138B were measured following induction of the pathway by virus infection or by pro-inflammatory mediators, suggesting that the effects of GRA on NF\u0138B are context-dependent. Deciphering the interactions between GRA and the NF\u0138B signaling pathway at the molecular level will contribute to understanding how its activity is modulated depending on the stimulus. One possible alternative mechanism of replication inhibition that is not mutually exclusive is provided by several reports indicating GRA modulates PI3/Akt activity [27, 37, 38] . Pharmacological inhibition of the PI3/Akt pathway substantially reduces rotavirus yields in culture [39] . The effects of GRA on these signaling pathways in the context of rotavirus infection and how GRA may modulate them currently are under investigation.",

Rotavirus infects mature enterocytes at the villus tips in the proximal small intestine and thus in vivo, the tropism is polarized epithelial cells. Continuing studies will address whether there is a difference either in GRA toxicity or in the levels of reduction in virus replication in this cell type. We have administered GRA up to concentrations of 50 mg/kg to mice and have not observed clinical signs that would indicate toxicity (unpublished data), suggesting that inhibitory levels can be achieved in vivo. We currently are determining whether GRA-mediated replication inhibition in vitro translates to attenuation of virus replication in the mouse model of rotavirus infection.",
