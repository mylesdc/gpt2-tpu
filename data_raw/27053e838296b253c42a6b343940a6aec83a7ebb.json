To develop an effective bivalent oral vaccine against TGEV and PEDV infection, the D antigenic site of the TGEV spike (S) protein and the major antigen site (core neutralizing epitope-COE) of the PEDV S protein were used as immunogens, and the enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) gene was used as a reporter to construct genetically engineered Lactobacillus casei rLpPG F -T7g10-eGFP-6D-COE. The expression of proteins of interest by the recombinant L. casei was confirmed by confocal laser scanning microscopy and a Western blot assay, and the immunogenicity of rLpPG F -T7g10-eGFP-6D-COE in orally immunized mice was evaluated. The results showed that levels of anti-PEDV and anti-TGEV serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) and mucosal secreted immunoglobulin A (sIgA) antibodies obtained from the mice immunized with rLpPG F -T7g10-eGFP-6D-COE, as well as the proliferation levels of lymphocytes, were significantly higher than those in mice orally administered phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or rLpPG-T7g10. Moreover, the serum IgG antibodies showed neutralizing effects against PEDV and TGEV. Our data suggest that the antibiotic resistance-free genetically engineered L. casei bivalent oral vaccine provides a safe and promising strategy for vaccine development against PEDV and TGEV.",

Accumulating evidence indicates that this large-scale recurrence of PED was caused by highly virulent PEDV variants [8] [9] [10] [11] . In addition, co-infection of TGEV and PEDV often causes higher morbidity and mortality in newborn piglets. Therefore, the development of a safe and highly efficient vaccine against TGE and PED would be of great importance.",

However, the existing live attenuated/inactivated vaccines administered parenterally cannot effectively induce mucosal immunity against PEDV and TGEV infection [14] [15] [16] [17] . Although some vaccines for TGE and PED developed in China can effectively stimulate intestinal mucosal immunity through Houhai acupoint injection, this immunization procedure is more time-consuming and labor-intensive. Therefore, vaccines that can induce a mucosal immune response against PEDV and TGEV would be of great significance, in particular those demonstrated to be safe, inexpensive, easy to use, and effective. The spike (S) glycoproteins of TGEV and PEDV possess antigen epitopes, and previous reports have demonstrated that the D antigen site (amino acids 378-392) in the S protein of TGEV and the core neutralizing epitope (COE; amino acids 499-638) in the S protein of PEDV can elicit neutralizing antibodies against TGEV and PEDV infection, respectively. This suggests that these are promising candidate antigens for the development of a genetically engineered vaccine [12, 18, 19] .",

Moreover, we have previously constructed a recombinant L. casei live vaccine expressing the D antigen site of the TGEV S glycoprotein combined with muramyl dipeptide and tuftsin as adjuvants, suggesting the possibility of a promising oral vaccine against TGEV challenge [12] . However, plasmid-mediated antibiotic resistance is commonly used as a selective marker for genetically engineered bacteria [24] [25] [26] . This could result in potential biosafety issues due to the transfer of antibiotic resistance from genetically engineered bacteria to environmental pathogens. Enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) is a luminescent jellyfish protein with the amino acid substitutions necessary to generate a strong fluorescence signal when excited by ultraviolet or blue light. It is widely used in biological research, including in studies of cell differentiation, gene tracking, and protein localization and operation in vivo [27, 28] , providing a potential candidate for a screening marker to replace antibiotic resistance.",

The plates were supplemented with 10 \u00b5L of 3-(4,5-dimethylthylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazoliumbromide (MTT) per well and incubated for an additional 4 h, and then proliferation was measured using OD 490 values. The experiment was carried out in triplicate, and the lymphocyte proliferation index in the spleen (SI) was calculated as the mean reading of triplicate antigen stimulation wells divided by the mean reading of triplicate negative control wells.",

Our results suggested that the genetically engineered L. casei strain rLpPG F -T7g10-eGFP-6D-COE can be used as a bivalent oral vaccine for PEDV and TGEV, eliciting mucosal and humoral immune responses against both TGEV and PEDV via oral immunization. This was evidenced by significantly higher levels of virus-neutralizing antibodies, anti-PEDV/TGEV serum IgG, and mucosal sIgA in mice orally immunized with rLpPG F -T7g10-eGFP-6D-COE, compared to the levels for the rLpPG-T7g10 or PBS groups.

At the same time, the level of sIgA can reflect the status of viral infection and the protective efficacy of vaccines [34] . In the present study, anti-TGEV/PEDV sIgA antibodies could be effectively induced at high levels in the feces and vaginas of mice orally treated with rLpPG F -T7g10-eGFP-6D-COE. IgA is reported to peak at 6 weeks and decline at 8 weeks in piglets [26] ; thus, if durable immunity was present at 35 days post-immunization, newborn pigs could obtain immune protection. Therefore, we assessed the levels of the sIgA antibody for 35 days post-immunization. Our data showed that the levels of sIgA in the feces of mice orally immunized with rLpPG F -T7g10-eGFP-6D-COE gradually increased and peaked at 7, 21 and 35 days post-immunization, indicating that a mucosal immune response can be effectively elicited by rLpPG F -T7g10-eGFP-6D-COE after oral immunization.

Notably, the use of eGFP as a selective marker in rLpPG F -T7g10-eGFP-6D-COE would avoid the main disadvantage of traditional plasmid expression systems by eliminating the use of antibiotic resistance genes as selective markers for genetically engineered bacteria [18, 24, 25] . Moreover, rLpPG F -T7g10-eGFP-6D-COE was constructed with a constitutive expression plasmid developed by our lab, exhibiting a significant advantage to inducible gene expression systems that require the use of an inductive agent. Additionally, a pgsA-derived anchoring matrix from Bacillus subtilis [37, 38] was used to express the fusion proteins, which were displayed on the bacterial surface, eliciting good immunogenicity. The improved plasmid expression system used in this study therefore provides a powerful tool for the development of recombinant Lactobacillus oral vaccines.",
