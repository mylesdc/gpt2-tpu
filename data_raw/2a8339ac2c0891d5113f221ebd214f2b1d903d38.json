Hexa-histidine is one of the most commonly used fusion tags for protein expression due to its small size and convenient purification via immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC). This purification process has been adapted to the protein microarray format, but the quality of in situ His-tagged protein purification on slides has not been systematically evaluated. We established methods to determine the level of purification of such proteins on metal chelate-modified slide surfaces. Optimized in situ purification of His-tagged recombinant proteins has the potential to become the new gold standard for cost-effective generation of high-quality and high-density protein microarrays.",

Using PEG-coated chelated Cu 2+ slides, consistently higher purities of recombinant proteins were measured. An optimized wash buffer (PBST) composed of 10 mM phosphate buffer, 2.7 mM KCl, 140 mM NaCl and 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.4, further improved protein purity levels. Using Escherichia coli cell lysates expressing 90 recombinant Streptococcus pneumoniae proteins, 73 proteins were successfully immobilized, and 66 proteins were in situ purified with greater than 90% purity. We identified several antigens among the in situ-purified proteins via assays with anti-S. pneumoniae rabbit antibodies and a human patient antiserum, as a demonstration project of large scale microarray-based immunoproteomics profiling. The methodology is compatible with higher throughput formats of in vivo protein expression, eliminates the need for resin-based purification and circumvents protein solubility and denaturation problems caused by buffer exchange steps and freeze-thaw cycles, which are associated with resin-based purification, intermittent protein storage and deposition on microarrays.",

Technical approaches for protein microarrays have benefitted from its predecessor, DNA microarray technology. Protein microarrays are designed for high throughput analysis of proteins using very small quantities of purified proteins [5] . Various protein microarray platforms have been developed, not only for screening antibodies and antigens but also for discovery of novel enzymes and enzymatic activities, protein-ligand, protein-nucleic acid and protein-protein interactions [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . Immunoproteomic analyses, that assess antibodyantigen interactions, are among the most established microarray applications [12] [13] [14] [15] . Theses assays have the potential to impact the field of infectious disease diagnostics and greatly facilitate the design of subunit vaccines [12, 14] .

Many high throughput protein production platforms have been reported [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . Proteins are typically overexpressed in a heterologous host system (E. coli) and purified via affinity chromatography to fusion tags associated with the recombinant proteins. A recently introduced approach is based on highly parallel in vitro transcription and translation using cellular extracts [26] [27] [28] . While powerful, the difficulty with column based recombinant protein purification is relate to reduced throughput potential and low protein stability and solubility of proteins during pre-immobilization processing steps. The in vitro transcription and translation approach is relatively expensive and requires slide surfaces suitable for the immobilization of DNA and proteins. Recently, the technology has improved in efficiency and made significant studies with regard to long term instability issues of proteins prior to immobilization [9, [29] [30] [31] ]. An in situ expression and purification method for GST-tagged proteins was reported by Ramanchandran et al. [9, 32] .",

The same source set of expressed proteins allows routine reproduction of identical protein microarray chips. Both the microarray replicates and aliquots of cells expressing the recombinant proteins can be stored long-term without major concerns about the quality of the assays performed subsequently. This setup circumvents the problems caused by the long-term storage of purified proteins, which include protein degradation, precipitation and aggregation. Buffer exchange of purified and stored proteins at -80\u00b0C is not required. A flow diagram for in situ protein purification from E. coli cell cultures is shown in Figure 1 . Recombinant proteins were expressed in E. coli in 96-well block. Cell cultures were divided into aliquots in 96-well plates and stored as cell pellets at -80\u00b0C. The cell aliquots were subjected to lysis followed by in situ purification and immobilization of proteins via specific interactions of His-tagged proteins with a slide surface chelated with either Ni 2+ or Cu 2+ (Figure 1B) .

There are two different types of protein impurities, one related to non-specific binding and the other caused by competitive binding. Non-specific interactions of endogenous E. coli proteins with a metal chelate surface depend primarily on the chemistry of the support surface. These impurities can be reduced or eliminated using effective wash steps. In the context of His-tagged proteins, competitive binding is often linked to histidine-rich E. coli proteins such as the FKBP-type Schematic of in situ purification of His-tagged proteins on protein microarray slides Figure 1 Schematic of in situ purification of His-tagged proteins on protein microarray slides. A) Flow diagram from recombinant protein expression to in situ purification and protein microarray. Cells were cultured in 1 mL 2xYT media in a 96-well block and the target proteins were overexpressed by adding IPTG at O.D. 600 nm = 0.7-0.9. After induction, the cells were divided into several 96-well plates, and the cell pellets were stored at -20\u00b0C. The cell pellets were resuspended, and lysed. Soluble fractions of lysates were subjected to in situ purification. Metal ions, either Ni 2+ or Cu 2+ , were attached to the surface of a chip with a chelate structure. The chip surface was blocked with PBS buffer containing 5 mM imidazole and 3% dry milk, and the E. coli endogenous proteins were washed off with PBST, pH 7.4. The chips can be either stored or applied for protein microarray application directly. B) Scheme of selective immobilization of recombinant proteins. Approximately 50 nL of each soluble fraction of cell lysates was spotted on the metal ion (Ni 2+ or Cu 2+ ) chelated chip. His-tagged recombinant proteins were immobilized by binding tightly to the metal chelate. The endogenous E. coli proteins were washed with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20.",

We used a quantitative approach to discern specific binding of His-tagged proteins to the reactive surface from non-specific binding of endogenous E. coli proteins.

Interestingly, relative purities of proteins using the in situ purification method were correlated to the quantities of the corresponding solubly expressed proteins in the E. coli cell lysate. His-tagged FolE expressed solubly at approximately 4.5-fold greater abundance than His-tagged LacI. The difference in relative purity levels of the two recombinant proteins was much greater on the Ni 2+ /NTA slide (45%) than on the Cu 2+ /IDA/PEG slide (10%). Apparently, non-specific protein adsorption on the slide surface reduced the purity level. Lower non-specific protein adsorption resulted in less variation in immobilized protein purity. This finding indicates that the consistency of in situ purification of proteins is dependent not only on the surface chemistry of the slide but also on the quantity of the solubly expressed recombinant proteins.

However, the fluorescence intensity for the immobilized LacI on the Cu 2+ /IDA/PEG was about 1.9-fold greater than that on the Ni 2+ slide. When E. coli lysate containing overexpressed recombinant proteins, either FolE or LacI, was applied on the slides, non-specific immobilization of E. coli endogenous proteins on Ni 2+ /NTA was at least 3-fold more than on Cu 2+ /IDA/PEG. Lower capacity of the Ni 2+ / NTA slides could be an effect of reduced affinity, density of reactive groups on slide surface or less accessibility of His-tag by the antibody. The much higher nonspecific interactions of Ni 2+ /NTA resulted from a difference in the support chemistry and lack of PEG coating. Since the lower fluorescence signal for purified LacI on the Ni 2+ / NTA compared to the Cu 2+ /IDA/PEG was observed, the much lower E. coli endogenous signal on Cu 2+ /IDA/PEG is more likely due to the PEG coating which has been reported and used to prevent nonspecific interactions [38] [39] [40] .",

Anti-S. pneumoniae antibodies raised in rabbits using a mixture of nine S. pneumoniae serotypes as immunogens and an antiserum of a patient infected with S. pneumoniae serotype IV were used. The antibodies and antisera were pre-treated with E. coli cell extracts permitting removal of E. coli protein-reactive antibodies which are known to circulate in most animal and human sera. Binding affinities of anti-S. pneumoniae antibodies to recombinant proteins were determined using the following equation.",

            "text": "R F in Eq. 2 represents fluorescence intensity ratio of a labeled secondary antibody that measures the interaction of anti-S. pneumoniae antibodies with immobilized proteins, to the Alexa Fluor 555 conjugated anti-His-tag antibody. The anti-His-tag antibody served as a normalizing factor to compare antigen recognition activities. This is useful because different proteins are immobilized in different quantities. Three types of R F values for a rabbit anti-S. pneumoniae antibody (R Ab ), a human patient antiserum (R S1 ) and a healthy human serum (R S0 ), are provided in the Additional file 1. R F values greater than 1 suggested an interaction between a protein and anti-S. pneumoniae antibodies. A strongly reactive protein in the assay with rabbit antibodies was the manganese ABC transporter adhesion lipoprotein (PsaA) (Figure 3e ). This lipoprotein is involved in pathogenicity via its role as a host cell adhesion protein. It is a highly conserved immunogenic protein among many of the 90 S. pneumoniae serotypes [44, 45] . Data for the human patient antiserum (S 1 ) were compared to those for a non-infected human serum (S 0 ). Immunogenicity was defined by R F (>1) mentioned above and R (>2), a ratio of S 1 to S 0 . In addition to PsaA, the iron-compound ABC transporter PiuA (SP1872) was also identified as a strong antigen. PiuA is suggested to bind extracellular iron and deliver it to the permease of the ABC transporter. The permease facilitates import of the cation into the cytoplasm. In S. pneumoniae (TIGR4), 10 proteins are annotated as iron ABC transporters. Although mechanisms of iron uptake by S. pneumoniae are not well characterized, iron transporters are known to be strong antigens and required for full virulence [46] [47] [48] . PsaA and PiuA are potential vaccine candidates and potential antigenic markers for the diagnosis of S. pneumoniae infections. Both proteins are anchored to the cytoplasmic membrane and exposed at the surface of S. pneumoniae. This study sets the stage for expression and immunogenic analyses of a larger number of ABC transporters and other cell surface-localized proteins, testing a large number of human patient sera. Another interesting application is the design of a microarray chip displaying a range of antigens recognized at various time points during an infection with S. pneumoniae and convalescence of the patient.",

The strategy we employed has potential to become a new gold standard for high quality protein microarrays. We demonstrate that Cu 2+ /IDA/PEG successfully reduced non-specific adsorption of proteins on the substrate. Finally, we demonstrate that this protein microarray is useful for the discovery of immunogenic proteins of a bacterium that causes serious infections in humans.",
