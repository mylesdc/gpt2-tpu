            "text": "From 1992 onwards, outbreaks of a previously unknown illness have been reported in Asian seabass (Lates calcarifer) kept in maricultures in Southeast Asia. The most striking symptom of this emerging disease is the loss of scales. It was referred to as scale drop syndrome, but the etiology remained enigmatic. By using a next-generation virus discovery technique, VIDISCA-454, sequences of an unknown virus were detected in serum of diseased fish. The near complete genome sequence of the virus was determined, which shows a unique genome organization, and low levels of identity to known members of the Iridoviridae. Based on homology of a series of putatively encoded proteins, the virus is a novel member of the Megalocytivirus genus of the Iridoviridae family. The virus was isolated and propagated in cell culture, where it caused a cytopathogenic effect in infected Asian seabass kidney and brain cells. Electron microscopy revealed icosahedral virions of about 140 nm, characteristic for the Iridoviridae. In vitro cultured virus induced scale drop syndrome in Asian seabass in vivo and the virus could be reisolated from these infected fish. These findings show that the virus is the causative agent for the scale drop syndrome, as each of Koch's postulates is fulfilled. We have named the virus Scale Drop Disease Virus. Vaccines prepared from BEI-and formalin inactivated virus, as well as from E. coli produced major capsid protein provide efficacious protection against scale drop disease.",

            "text": "Scale drop syndrome in Lates calcarifer, Asian seabass, was first reported in 1992 in Penang, Malaysia, and since then outbreaks have been seen in Indonesia and in the Strait of Malacca. The phenotypic symptoms and pathology of the syndrome were described in detail by Gibson-Kueh et al. [1] . Typically, affected fish are characterized by darkened bodies, scale loss, tail and fin erosion, pallor of gills, and sometimes exophthalmia. Furthermore, fish often show lethargic behavior and severely affected fish stop schooling, sometimes show spiral swimming and a large proportion of the fish eventually die. The pathological symptoms comprise vasculitis in all major organs, including the skin and the brain, tissue degeneration, hemorrhages and necrosis. The cumulative mortality is estimated around 40-50%. The syndrome is so far described to affect Asian seabass only, both juvenile and adult fish, and seems to follow a seasonal pattern: the south-west monsoon/inter-monsoon season starting around September may be a trigger. It is an illness with unknown etiology of which the incidence is on the rise in commercial fish farms. As Asian seabass is a large, valuable fish kept in maricultures, scale drop syndrome currently results in significant economic losses for affected farms. With the increasing aquaculture of L. calcarifer, from 11,000 tonnes in 1990 to 75,000 tonnes in 2012 [2] , the syndrome is expected to occur with increased frequency. The identification of the cause of the disease, and if possible, the development of a vaccine, are therefore highly desired.",

The location of each gene was determined and compared to the locations in other known members of the Iridoviridae family for which the full genome has been determined. S2 Table shows that the position of the conserved genes is unique and distinctively different from the other viruses. Phylogenetic analysis based on the deduced amino acid sequences of the 26 conserved proteins revealed that the virus clusters with the megalocytiviruses, yet it does not cluster as tightly as the other members (Fig 1) . Full genome sequences are however not available for all known megalocytiviruses, therefore an additional phylogenetic analysis was performed using the deduced amino acid sequences of the major capsid protein (MCP), which allowed inclusion of all (sequenced) members of the Iridoviridae family.

A negative control was composed of the pooled sera from three PCR-negative fish without clinical signs of scale drop syndrome. Enlarged cells were already observed two days after inoculation of the SK21 cell cultures, and after six days, a high level of cytopathogenic effect (CPE) was observed. Cultures were harvested by applying three freeze-thaw cycles, and replication of the virus was confirmed by qPCR on the harvest. Subsequently, the harvest was used for a second passage on SK21 cells using 10 DNA copies per cell as inoculum, which corresponds to a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 TCID 50 /cell (determined by back calculation). CPE was clearly visible in the second passage on day four and it was complete (100%) on day five. A third passage was started using the day four harvest of the second passage, again using 10 DNA copies per cell (MOI 0.01 TCID 50 /cell) as inoculum. The CPE was evident in the infected cultures, defined initially by distinct morphological changes in the cells, and at later times this was coupled with an increase in detachment from the culture vessel (shown in Fig 2B and 2D ). Viral replication was monitored by determining the number of viral genome copies on day 1 to 4 and the infectious titer on day 2, 3 and 4. The genome copy number increased from 2 x 10 6 to 3 x 10 10 genome copies/mL. The virus titer (TCID 50 ), increased from 3.2 10 log TCID 50 /mL to 8.1 10 log TCID 50 / mL on day 4 ( Fig 2E) . Similar results were obtained when the virus was inoculated on Asian seabass brain cells (SBB, established at MSD AH, S. Koumans, D. Remmers, S3 Fig). Negative control inoculation did not induce CPE and remained qPCR-negative during three subsequent passages on SK21 and SBB cells.",

The fifth group contained control fish. Records of fish mortalities in the observation tanks between day 0 and day 28 are shown in Fig 4A ( 15 fish/group). Clinical symptoms characteristic of scale drop syndrome, including tail and fin erosion, broken fins, scale loss and exophthalmia, were clearly visible on day 7-14 after infection in the IP-challenged group (Fig 4C; day 10 ) and the IP-+ IM-challenged group. In the IPchallenged fish, mortality was observed from 5 days post-infection. Cumulative mortality reached 60% for the IP group and 47% for the IP + IM group. Fish that received an IP 1:10-dose only or an IM dose showed less severe clinical symptoms and a later onset of mortality and lower cumulative mortality: 20% (IP 1:10) and 13% (IM). No mortality was observed in control fish. Pooled serum samples collected from animals at 1, 3, 7, 10 and 14 days after infection were analyzed by qPCR for the presence of viral DNA. Viral DNA was detected in all groups on day 3, 7, 10 and 14, and not in the control group ( Fig 4D) . The amount of viral DNA copies peaked around 10 days post-infection.

An oil-adjuvanted vaccine made with dilution buffer only was used as control. Vaccines were administered as 0.1 mL IP dose at day 0 of the experiment when the fish averaged a weight of 60 g. Fish were challenged with an IP challenge of 2.0 x 10 7 TCID 50 /fish on day 28 post vaccination, when the average weight had reached 83 g. Survival after challenge was monitored for 28 days (Fig 5) . Mortality in the control group was high with only 8% survival after 28 days (2/ 25), whereas all three prototype vaccines provided protection with relative protection percentages of 74% (formalin-inactivated), 70% (BEI-inactivated) and 91% (recMCP). The virus concentrations of the formalin-inactivated vaccine and the BEI-inactivated vaccine differed 10-fold (Table 1 and Fig 5) . To examine whether the formalin-inactivated vaccine could provide better protection at a higher dose, a formalin-inactivated vaccine was also made from the same virus stock (10 8 TCID 50 /mL) that was used to make the BEI-inactivated vaccine. The relative protection percentage of this vaccine was however equal (70%).",

            "text": "This study describes the characterization of a virus which infects Lates calcarifer and causes scale drop syndrome. This previously unknown virus belongs to the Iridoviridae family and has only limited similarity with the known members. The pathogen was detected exclusively in sera and organs from fish with scale drop syndrome. To establish its role in scale drop syndrome, the virus was cultured and the culture harvests were used to infect Lates calcarifer, which resulted in the development of scale drop syndrome. The virus could subsequently be reisolated from the affected fish; hence all of Koch's postulates were fulfilled. We propose to name the virus Scale Drop Disease virus (SDDV), as we provide conclusive evidence that the SDDV is a member of the Iridoviridae, a family of viruses that consists of five genera. The three genera that infect vertebrates (fish, amphibians and reptiles) are Ranavirus, Lymphocystivirus and Megalocytivirus. The two genera that infect invertebrates (insects, crustaceans and possibly mollusks) are Chloriridovirus and Iridovirus. Analyses of putatively encoded proteins of conserved genes of SDDV revealed most phylogenetic relatedness with the megalocytiviruses. SDDV clusters with the megalocytiviruses but forms a separate branch within this genus. The megalocytiviruses are well known pathogens in tropical fish in South East Asia and Japan. One of the most extensively investigated megalocytiviruses is RSIV. RSIV is the causative agent of a disease with high mortalities that was first found in red sea bream (Pagrus major), which is a species of major importance for the tropical fish industry [13] . Later, two other megalocytiviruses that cause systemic diseases in fish, infectious spleen and kidney necrosis virus (ISKNV) and turbot reddish body iridovirus (TRBIV) were discovered [14] . Based on sequence analysis and serological studies, it has been concluded by the ICTV that the group of ISKNV/TRBIV/RSIV are strains of the same viral species. Because the full genome of ISKNV was the first to be determined, ISKNV is the type species of this group [15] . Only threespine stickleback virus and SDDV cluster apart from ISKNV (see S2 Fig) .",

Their genome is a single molecule of linear, double stranded DNA between 105 and 212 kbp, which is terminally redundant and circularly permuted [9, 16] . Also based on its morphology, the classification of SDDV as a member of the Iridoviridae is justified (Fig 3) . Irodovirids display icosahedral symmetry and are characterized by a central DNA-protein complex, an outer proteinaceous capsid and an intermediate lipid membrane associated with polypeptides that covers and protects the genetic material. The diameter of SDDV, 140 nm, is in the range of 120-200 nm that has been reported for other the Iridoviridae family [14] . The virions can be both enveloped and non-enveloped, depending on the mode of exit from the cells, i.e. through lysis or budding. The EM pictures revealed that only some virus particles contained an envelope (Fig 3) , but one should keep in mind that loss of an envelope can also be caused by the experimental procedures used for EM. Nevertheless, the remaining infectivity after chloroform treatment shows that an envelope is not essential for SDDV infectivity. The EM pictures did not reveal whether SDDV has an internal lipid membrane. Advanced cryo-electron microscopy will be necessary to elucidate if such membrane is present or absent.",

Previous studies on RSIV have shown that inactivated whole virus vaccines offer good protection against disease [17, 18] . An efficacious commercial formalin-inactivated vaccine against RSIV is available from MSD (Aquavac IridoV, an oil-adjuvanted vaccine). We tested if the Aquavac IridoV vaccine provides cross-protection against SDDV, but such cross-protection could not be shown. Most likely, SDDV and RSIV do not have sufficient antigenic epitopes in common, which is not unexpected based on the fact that the genetic differences and biological mechanisms of replication differ considerably between the viruses. The RSIV vaccine from Biken [19] , which is a formalin-inactivated RSIV culture supernatant of GF cells, was not tested.",

Caipaing et al. [20] showed that only fish vaccinated with inactivated intact RSIV virus and not fish vaccinated with protein components such as MCP survived RSIV challenge. Fu et al.

Our vaccination challenge study with 27 \u03bcg/mL (2.7 \u03bcg/fish) SDDV recMCP from prokaryotic origin in ISA 763A VG oil provided a RPS of 91%, and thus the SDDV-MCP protein vaccine is a very promising candidate for vaccine development against SDDV.

In short, serum was centrifuged for 10 minutes at 10,000 x g and the supernatant was treated with TURBO DNase (2U/\u03bcl, Ambion). Subsequently, nucleic acids were extracted by the Boom extraction method [23] . A reverse transcription reaction with Superscript II (Invitrogen) was performed using non-ribosomal random hexamers [24] . Subsequently, second strand DNA synthesis was performed with 5 U of Klenow fragment (New England Biolabs). Double-stranded DNA was purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation and digested with Mse I restriction enzyme (New England Biolabs). Adaptors with different Multiplex Identifier sequences (MIDs) were ligated to the digested fragments of the different samples. Before PCR amplification, the fragments were purified with AMPure XP beads (Agencourt AMPure XP PCR, Beckman Coulter). Next, a 28 cycles PCR with adaptor-annealing primers was performed. The program of the PCR-reaction was: 5 min 95\u00b0C, and cycles of 1 min 95\u00b0C, 1 min 55\u00b0C, and 2 min 72\u00b0C, followed by 10 min 72\u00b0C and 10 min 4\u00b0C.

See S6 Table for detailed primer and probe information. Cycling conditions were 95\u00b0C for 4 min, followed by 35 cycles at 95\u00b0C for 30 sec, 50\u00b0C for 30 sec and 72\u00b0C for 30 sec. The rampspeed was set to 1.5\u00b0C/sec from 95\u00b0C to 50\u00b0C, and from 50\u00b0C to 72\u00b0C. Data were analyzed using Bio-Rad CFX Manager 2.0 software. A duplicate measurement of a dilution series of a cloned PCR product in pCR4-TOPO (Invitrogen) functioned as a standard curve. Positive or negative classification of the samples was based on the threshold cycle, as compared to the standard curve. The specificity of the qPCR was checked by gel electrophoresis of the amplified PCR product. Calibration curves with slope and y intercept were calculated by the CFX software, and PCR efficiency calculated from the slope was between 95% and 105%. The r 2 of the calibration curve was >0.99. The lower detection limit of the qPCR is 50 copies/\u03bcL.",

The 'percentage protected control' was calculated as the number of survivors in the control group, divided by the total number of control fish, multiplied by 100% (% protected control = [# survivors control] / [total # control fish] \u00c3 100% = x %). The 'percentage protected in the vaccine group' was calculated as the number of survivors in the vaccine group, divided by the total number of vaccinated fish, multiplied by 100% (% protected vaccine group = [# survivors vaccine] / [total # vaccinated fish] \u00c3 100% = y %). The RPS is formulated as RPS = 1-(% protection test / % protected control) or in a mathematical formulation RPS = 1-(x/y) \u00c3 100%. 10 Log TCID 50 /mL) was incubated with 10% or 50% chloroform. A 100-fold decrease in infectivity was observed due to incubation with chloroform. The remaining infectivity of 5,5 10 Log TCID 50 /mL indicates that a lipid envelope is not essential for replication of the SDDV. (PDF) ",
