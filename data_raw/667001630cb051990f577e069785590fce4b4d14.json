The 13 C NMR and DEPT135 spectra contained 21 carbon resonances, including six resulting from methyl groups, three from sp 2 methines, and one from an sp 3 methine, whereas a further three signals resulted from methylene groups, and eight resonances were assigned to quaternary carbons ( Table 1, Table 2 and Supporting Information File 1). The 1 H NMR spectrum of 1 displayed a singlet resonance for the aromatic methine (6-CH) at \u03b4 6.95 indicating, together with UV and 13 C NMR data, the presence of a penta-substituted benzene ring. The methyl group 10-CH 3 (\u03b4 C 8.8) was linked to C-4 of the aromatic ring due to heteronuclear long range correlations of the methyl protons with C-3, C-4 and C-5. The methoxy group 9-OCH 3 (\u03b4 H 3.98) had a heteronuclear long range correlation to C-3 of the aromatic ring, thus, clearly delineating its position. Besides the aromatic proton 6-H, the 1 H NMR spectrum showed two further resonance signals in the downfield shifted region (\u03b4 H 5.52 and 5.09) indicating, together with 13 C NMR and 1 H/ 13 C HMBC data, the presence of a geranyl substituent. The C-1' to C-10' part of the molecule was deduced from two proton coupling spin systems observed in the 1 H/ 1 H COSY spectrum, namely 1'-H 2 to 2'-H (J = 6.6 Hz) and 4'-H 2 to 6'-H through 5'-H 2 . 1 H/ 13 C HMBC data showed correlations from 9'-H 3 to C-2', C-3' and C-4', and from methyl protons 8'-H 3 and 10'-H 3 to C-6'and C-7', disclosing a geranyl fragment. Based on literature comparisons we established the configuration of \u0394 2'/3' as E [11] . The aromatic quaternary carbon C-5 (\u03b4 C 164.2) had a carbon resonance that indicated a connection to an oxygen atom. The monoterpenyl substituent was established to be connected to C-5 through an oxygen atom, based on the heteronuclear long range correlations of 1'-H 2 (\u03b4 H 4.69, 4.74) to C-5.",

Furthermore, the 13 C NMR resonance of C-8 at \u03b4 77.0 was found to be characteristic for a carbon bound to an oxygen atom. The 1 H/ 1 H COSY spectrum showed a coupling of 8-H with 11-H 3 (J = 6.6 Hz), and the 1 H/ 13 C HMBC spectrum contained correlations from 8-H to C-6, C-7 and C-2 of the penta-substituted aromatic ring, as well as to the carbonyl carbon C-1. Ring double bond equivalents required a second ring within compound 1, and together with heteronuclear correlations of 8-H to C-1 and the carbon resonance of C-1 at \u03b4 C 168.2 indicating the presence of a carbonyl group, this gave evidence for a C-8-methylated phthalide skeleton, i.e., the C-1 to C-11 part of the structure. Since the resonance signal for 6-H did not show heteronuclear long range correlations to that of the carbonyl C-1, but instead correlated with the sp 3 methine C-8, the carbonyl group was assigned at C-1. In this way, a phthalide-nucleus identical to that of the known natural product nidulol was formed [6] . To further prove that the carbonyl group is positioned at C-1 and not at C-8 of 1, 1 H NMR spectra of 1 were compared with those of nidulol and silvaticol (4) (and derivatives, see Supporting Information File 1). The latter are known regioisomeric phthalides with the carbonyl group at C-1 and C-8, respectively. Differences in 1 H NMR resonances can be discerned especially for 6-H, resonating at \u03b4 H 6.59 (CDCl 3 ) for nidulol and \u03b4 H 7.04 (CDCl 3 ) for silvaticol [6] . The 1 H NMR spectrum of 1 (\u03b4 H 6.54 in CDCl 3 ) was shown to be similar to that of nidulol and the nidulol derivative 5-(3',3'-dimethylallyloxy)-7-methoxy-6-methylphthalide with 6-H resonating at \u03b4 H 6.62 (see Supporting Information File 1) [5] .

The measurement of the specific optical rotation for these compounds yielded values close to zero, and furthermore, the CD measurements showed hardly any CD effect for the referred compounds. This was expected at around 260 nm due to the proximity of the chiral center to the chromophoric penta-substituted benzene ring. We thus assumed the presence of racemic mixtures for these chiral compounds. Extensive trials to sepa-rate the enantiomers, employing three different HPLC chiral stationary phases, were unsuccessful. However, the presence of racemic mixtures was proven for the analogous, nitrogencontaining compounds, i.e., phthalimidine derivatives isolated from the same fungus (Almeida et al., unpublished data). Compounds 1-4 were further evaluated for antiviral activity, for inhibition of protein kinases and proteases, for growth inhibition of antibiotic-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis as well as further microbial pathogens, for activity in an antidiabetic activity assay panel, in a 3T3-L1 murine adipocyte assay, and in a NF-\u03baB protein complex assay, but they exhibited no activity (see detailed description in Supporting Information File 1).",

Secondary metabolites 1 and 2 discovered in the marine-derived Stachylidium sp. were found to be derivatives of the natural product nidulol, whilst compound 3 was a derivative of silvaticol (4) (see Supporting Information File 1), formerly described from the fungus Aspergillus silvaticus [6] . Nidulol and silvaticol (4) are regioisomeric compounds and differ in terms of the position of the carbonyl group, which is either placed peri to the aromatic hydrogen, as in 3 and 4, or it is positioned peri to the aromatic methoxy moiety, e.g., in 1 and 2. The Stachylidium species investigated here is thus able to produce both types of phthalides, which are suspected to differ significantly in terms of their biosynthesis (Supporting Information File 1; Figure  S15 ).",

Marilone A and C (1, 3) showed weak antiproliferative activity with an average GI 50 of 36.7 and 26.6 \u00b5M, respectively (see Supporting Information File 1).Marilone B (2) was assayed in a panel of 44 psychoactive receptors, including 11 serotonin receptors, and marilone B showed a specific antagonistic effect on the serotonin receptor 5-HT 2B with a K i value of 7.7 \u00b5M.",

HRMS-ESI were recorded on a Bruker Daltonik micrOTOF-Q time-of-flight mass spectrometer with ESI source. HPLC was carried out on a system composed of a Waters 515 pump together with a Knauer K-2300 differential refractometer. HPLC columns were from Knauer (250 \u00d7 8 mm, Eurospher-100 Si and 250 \u00d7 8 mm, Eurospher-100, C18, 5 \u03bcm; flow 2 mL/min) and Macherey-Nagel (Nucleodur C18 EC Isis 250 \u00d7 4.6 mm, 5 \u03bcm, flow: 1 mL/min). Merck silica gel 60 (0.040-0.063 mm, 70-230 mesh) was used for vacuum liquid chromatography (VLC). Columns were wet-packed under vacuum with petroleum ether (PE). Before applying the sample solution, the columns were equilibrated with the first designated eluent. Standard columns for crude extract fractionation had dimensions of 13 \u00d7 4 cm.Fungal material. The marine-derived fungus Stachylidium sp. was isolated from the sponge Callyspongia sp. cf. C. flammea (collected at Bear Island, Sydney, Australia) and identified by P. Massart and C. Decock, BCCM/MUCL, Catholic University of Louvain, Belgium. A specimen is deposited at the Institute for Pharmaceutical Biology, University of Bonn, isolation number \"293K04\", culture collection number \"220\".Cultivation, extraction and isolation. Compounds 1-4 were isolated from a 60 days culture (12 L) of Stachylidium sp. on an agar-biomalt medium supplemented with sea salt (BMS). An extraction with 5 L EtOAc yielded 5.9 g of extract, which was subjected to a VLC fractionation in an open column with silica as solid phase and a gradient solvent system with petroleum ether/acetone of 10:1, 5:1, 2:1, 1:1, 100% acetone and 100% MeOH, resulting in six VLC fractions. Compounds 1 and 3 were isolated from VLC fraction 1. VLC fraction 1 was again fractionated using petroleum ether/acetone 90:1 and 10:1 in order to eliminate fatty acid content of the sample. The VLC fraction 10:1 was subjected to NP-HPLC fractionation using petroleum ether/acetone 30:1 to yield a mixture of both compounds (subfraction 4 of 7). Further fractionation using MeOH/ H 2 O 8:2 (RP-HPLC, Isis column) yielded compound 1 (subfraction 1 of 2; 19 mg, t R 13 min) and compound 3 (subfraction 2 of 2; 14.2 mg, t R 15 min).Compounds 2 and 4 were isolated from VLC fraction 2, followed by NP-HPLC fractionation using PE/acetone 11:1 to yield a mixture of both compounds (fraction 6 of 7). Further fractionation using MeOH/H 2 O 4:6 (RP-HPLC, Isis column) yielded compound 2 (fraction 1 of 2; 5.2 mg, t R 35 min) and the known compound 4, silvaticol (fraction 2 of 2; 5.6 mg, t R 38 min).Marilone A (1): transparent oil (1.6 mg/L, 0.32%); UV (MeOH) \u03bb max , nm (log \u03b5): 219 (4.38), 261 (2.95); IR (ATR) \u03bd max : 2964, 1745, 1603 cm \u22121 ; 1 H NMR and 13 C NMR",
