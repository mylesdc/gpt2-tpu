The aim of this study was to investigate the distribution of avian infectious bronchitis virus isolate IRFIBV32 (793/B serotype) in experimentally infected chicken. Ninetyone-day-old commercial broilers were divided randomly into two groups (seventy in the experimental and twenty in the control group). Chicks in the experimental group were inoculated intranasally with 10 5 ELD50/0.1 mL of the virus at three weeks of age. The samples from various tissues were collected at1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 15, and 20 days postinoculation. Chickens exhibited mild respiratory signs and depression. Viral RNA was detected in the kidney, lung and tracheas on days 1 to 13 PI, in the oviduct between, days 3 and 13, in testes between days 1 and 11 PI, and in the caecal tonsil consistently up to day 20 PI. The most remarkable clinical signs and virus detection appeared on day 1 PI. Data indicated that the number of infected chickens and viral RNA detection from tissues was reduced with increasing antibody titer on day 20 PI. The results demonstrated that the IRFIBV32 virus has wide tissue distribution for respiratory, urogenital, and digestive systems.",

            "text": "Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is, by definition, the coronavirus of the domestic fowl. Although it does indeed cause respiratory disease, it also replicates at many nonrespiratory epithelial surfaces, where it may cause pathology, for example, kidney and gonads [1, 2] . Strains of the virus vary in the extent to which they cause pathology in nonrespiratory organs. Replication at enteric surfaces is considered to not normally result in clinical disease, although it does result in faecal excretion of the virus [3] . Infectious bronchitis (IB) is one of the most important diseases of chickens and continues to cause substantial economic losses to the industry. Infectious bronchitis is caused by IB virus (IBV), which is one of the primary agents of respiratory disease in chickens worldwide. All chickens are susceptible to IBV infection, and the respiratory signs include gasping, coughing, rales, and nasal discharge. Sick chicks usually huddle together and appear depressed. The severity of the symptoms in chickens is related to their age and immune status. Other signs of IB, such as wet droppings, are due to increased water consumption. The type of virus strain infecting a flock determines the pathogenesis of the disease, in other words, the degree and duration of lesions in different organs. The upper respiratory tract is the primary site of infection, but the virus can also replicate in the reproductive, renal, and digestive systems [4] . The conventional diagnosis of the IBV is based on virus isolation in embryonated eggs, followed by immunological identification of isolates. Since two or three blind passages are often required for successful primary isolation of IBV, this procedure could be tedious and time consuming [5] . Alternatively, IBV may be isolated by inoculation in chicken tracheal organ cultures. Furthermore, IBV may be detected directly in tissues of infected birds by means of immunohistochemistry [6, 7] or in situ hybridization [8] . The reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has proved useful in the detection of several RNA viruses [9, 10] . Outbreaks of the disease can 2 The Scientific World Journal occur even in vaccinated flocks because there is little or no cross-protection between serotypes [2, 11] . The necessity of IB prevention in chicken regarding the nature of the virus with a high mutation rate in the S1 gene dictates the necessity to develop effective vaccines. The first step is to study the virus strains distributed in the geographical region and determine their antigenicity and pathogenicity in order to choose a suitable virus strain for vaccination. This virus was isolated from a flock suspected of IB suffering from severe respiratory distress and experiencing high mortality [12] .",

In the present study, clinical signs and gross lesions were in agreement with the findings that have been described previously [15] . Twenty four hours after exposure, Purcell and McFerran [16] noted cloudy and edematous abdominal and posterior thoracic air sacs, which 3 days later thickened and filled with clear bubbly exudates. We did not observe any gross changes in the air sacs, which were thin, clear, and transparent. The lungs also appeared normal in all birds, similar to the observations of Grgi\u0107 et al. [17] .

Trachea, lung, kidney, and cecal tonsils from birds were analyzed. Representative RT-PCR results are shown, and, as expected, IB virus was detected more frequently in the tracheal tissues than in the lungs, kidney, or cecal tonsils. In the current experiment, the virus was detected from all organs of the infected birds except the oviduct at 24 hours PI. The virus was detected consistently in the trachea, lung, kidney, and caecal tonsil consistently for 13 days and persisted longer in the kidney and caecal tonsil than in the respiratory tissues. The virus disappeared from the kidney after 15 days, although it was found in the caecal tonsil and intestine consistently for 20 days PI. The virus was also detected in the testes consistently for 11 days. Previous studies confirmed IBV can also replicate in the testes [23] . The virus disappeared from the ovary and oviduct after 13 days, from testes after 11 days. These findings indicate IRFIBV32 isolate has a broad tissue distribution that includes respiratory, digestive, congenital, and urinary tract tissues; predominantly in urinary and digestive tracts. This result is in agreement with the previous studies about IBV distribution [6, 22, 24, 25] . Chen and Itakura [24] reported that the tracheal lesions recovered faster in IBV inoculated groups. The nephropathogenic property of their IBV was longer lasting than the respiratory involvement. In our investigation, virus was detected from kidneys more often than the tracheas.",

They reported that the 793/B serotype of IBV has a greater affinity and pathogenicity for the kidney than to other tissues, but, in our study, the distribution of viral RNA in caecal tonsils and guts was more than the other tissues. Virus detection in the caecal tonsil and intestine The Scientific World Journal 5 could indicate this isolate of IBV tropism for the digestive tract. However, in our experiment, no relevant gross lesions were detected in the digestive tract following IBV challenge. Cavanagh [3] also reported that infection of enteric tissues usually does not manifest itself clinically. Lucio and Fabricant [26] showed M41 strain can infect a variety of tissues and some isolates may be recovered frequently from the digestive tract. In another study, IBV was not detected from intestine and cecal tonsils using immunofluorescence technique [27] . Abdel-Moneim et al. [9] detected IBV antigen in the proventriculus, skin, sclera of the eye, spinal cord, and the central nervous system in infected embryos by immunohistochemistry. Lee et al.

Viral RNA was detected at 2 days after infection in epithelial cells of the trachea, lung, intestine, and bursa. In chickens, the virus has been routinely isolated from the trachea, lung, and caecal tonsils but the persistence of the virus in the bursa was of interest.
