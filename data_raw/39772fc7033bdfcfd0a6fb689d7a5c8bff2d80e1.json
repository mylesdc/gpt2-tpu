            "text": "Flaviviruses bud into the endoplasmic reticulum and are transported through the secretory pathway, where the mildly acidic environment triggers particle rearrangement and allows furin processing of the prM protein to pr and M. The peripheral pr peptide remains bound to virus at low pH and inhibits virus-membrane interaction. Upon exocytosis, the release of pr at neutral pH completes virus maturation to an infectious particle. Together this evidence suggests that pr may shield the flavivirus fusion protein E from the low pH environment of the exocytic pathway. Here we developed an in vitro system to reconstitute the interaction of dengue virus (DENV) pr with soluble truncated E proteins. At low pH recombinant pr bound to both monomeric and dimeric forms of E and blocked their membrane insertion. Exogenous pr interacted with mature infectious DENV and specifically inhibited virus fusion and infection. Alanine substitution of E H244, a highly conserved histidine residue in the pr-E interface, blocked pr-E interaction and reduced release of DENV virus-like particles. Folding, membrane insertion and trimerization of the H244A mutant E protein were preserved, and particle release could be partially rescued by neutralization of the low pH of the secretory pathway. Thus, pr acts to silence flavivirus fusion activity during virus secretion, and this function can be separated from the chaperone activity of prM. The sequence conservation of key residues involved in the flavivirus pr-E interaction suggests that this protein-protein interface may be a useful target for broad-spectrum inhibitors.",

            "text": "The emergence and resurgence of human viral pathogens can be traced to a complex variety of causes including increased urbanization, human contact with animal reservoirs, a decrease in effective public health systems, and the spread of insect vectors that disseminate some viral infections [1, 2, 3] . Flaviviruses are a genus in the Flaviviridae family and include important emerging and resurgent human pathogens such as dengue virus (DENV), West Nile virus (WNV), tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) and yellow fever virus [2, 4] . Flaviviruses are transmitted by insects such as mosquitoes and ticks, and can cause severe human diseases characterized by encephalitis, meningitis, and hemorrhages [2, 3] . More than one third of the world's population lives in dengue fever endemic areas, and there are an estimated 50-100 million cases of dengue infection and 500,000 cases of the more lethal complication, dengue hemorrhagic fever, per year [5, 6, 7, 8] . There are currently no antiviral therapies for flaviviruses. DENV vaccine development is underway but is problematic due to the presence of four DENV serotypes and the potential for antibody-dependent enhancement of infection [2, 6, 9, 10] . Antiviral therapies could thus be an important alternative for DENV and for viruses such as WNV in which the cost and potential side effects of vaccination must be weighed against the relatively low number of human cases [2] .",

            "text": "Flaviviruses are small, highly organized enveloped viruses with a spherical shape [4, 11] . They contain a positive-sense RNA genome packaged by the viral capsid protein. The nucleocapsid is surrounded by a lipid bilayer containing the viral membrane protein E. Flaviviruses infect cells by receptor engagement at the plasma membrane, endocytic uptake, and a membrane fusion reaction triggered by the low pH of the endosome compartment [12, 13] . The viral E protein binds the receptor and drives the fusion of the viral and endosome membranes to initiate virus infection. The pre-fusion structure of the E protein ectodomain (here referred to as E9) shows that E contains three domains composed primarily of b-sheets: a central domain I (DI) connecting on one side to the elongated domain II (DII) with the hydrophobic fusion loop at its tip, and connecting via a flexible linker on the other side to the immunoglobulin-like domain III (DIII) [14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19] (Figs. 1A, S1). Although these regions are not present in the truncated E9 ectodomain, DIII connects to a stem domain and C-terminal membrane anchor (TM). The E protein in mature infectious flavivirus is organized in homodimers that lie tangential to the virus membrane [20] . Within each dimer the E proteins interact in a head to tail fashion, with the fusion loop of each E protein hidden in a hydrophobic pocket formed by DI and DIII of the dimeric E partner.",

The prefusion and postfusion conformations of the flavivirus E fusion protein are structurally and functionally similar to those of the E1 fusion protein from the alphavirus Semliki Forest virus (SFV) [23, 24, 25] , and these fusion proteins are often referred to as ''class II'' [26, 27, 28] . In addition to the ectodomains whose trimer structures are described above, truncated fusion proteins composed of domains I and II (DI/II) can reconstitute SFV and DENV core trimer formation on target membranes [29, 30] . Such core trimers act as specific targets for DIII binding, thus recapitulating the protein-protein interactions during class II trimerization and hairpin formation.",

Given the low pH that is present in the Golgi complex and trans-Golgi network (TGN) [31] , how do flaviviruses avoid inactivation during their transport? The particles are assembled in the ER as immature non-infectious viruses containing heterodimers of the precursor membrane protein (prM) and E protein [4, 26, 32] . Subsequent exposure to low pH in the secretory pathway triggers a dramatic rearrangement to E homodimers and makes the prM protein accessible to furin cleavage [33, 34] . Processing of prM by cellular furin results in mature infectious virus in which E homodimers are poised to mediate fusion [33] . Important recent studies describe the structure of pr peptide in complex with E, and indicate that processed pr remains associated with the virus at low pH and can inhibit virus-membrane interaction [34, 35, 36] . Thus, pr on the virus could protect E protein from low pH in the secretory pathway.",

Dengue virus (DENV) is an important human pathogen whose membrane fusion is triggered by low pH during virus entry into the cell. However, newly synthesized DENV must also transit through a low pH environment during virus exit. DENV is believed to escape premature fusion in the exit pathway via the small viral protein pr, which is processed and associates with virus after biosynthesis, and is released from the virus particle in the neutral pH extracellular environment. Here we have reconstituted the interaction of pr with the DENV fusion protein E using soluble protein components. The interaction has a low pH optimum and inhibits membrane insertion of the fusion protein. The recombinant pr peptide can ''add back'' to fully infectious mature DENV and block virus fusion and infection. We found that mutation of a critical conserved histidine on the fusion protein inhibits the interaction of E and pr, and makes the virus susceptible to low pH-induced inactivation during exit. This work characterizes the mechanism of pr protection, and suggests that the conserved multifunctional pr-E interaction may be an important target for antiviral strategies.",

Previous studies indicated that full-length TBEV prM could fold correctly when expressed in the absence of E protein [37] , suggesting that production of pr peptide alone might be possible. We generated a construct based on residues 1-86 of DENV2 prM, truncating pr just before the start of the furin cleavage recognition site at residue 87 (Fig. 1A) . This sequence was linked to a mammalian signal peptide at the N-terminus and to an affinity tag at the C-terminus, and expressed in 293T cells. The protein was isolated in a highly purified form by affinity chromatography and gel filtration (Fig. 1B) , and was recognized by mAb prM-6.1 against prM [40] (data not shown). The pr peptide migrated at a position of ,17 kDa in reducing SDS-PAGE, in keeping with its predicted size of 13 kDa plus the presence of carbohydrate due to the glycosylation site at position 69. This carbohydrate was removed by Peptide N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) to give a peptide of the predicted size. The protein was largely resistant to Endoglyosidase H (Endo H) digestion, indicating maturation of the carbohydrate chain as the protein transited through the Golgi complex. A mobility shift was observed upon reduction of pr, in keeping with the presence of 3 disulfide bonds in the structure of pr [34] .",

A rapid decrease in signal was observed when the samples were shifted to protein-free buffer, indicating rapid dissociation of the pr-E interaction. Similar results were obtained using monomeric DI/ II, with the lowest binding at pH 8.0, highest binding at pH 6.25, and a slight decrease at pH 6.0 (Fig. 2C) . Thus, the dimeric E9 and monomeric E DI/II proteins bound pr peptide with similar pHdependence. Binding to pr was specific, as little interaction was observed using the structurally similar E1 DI/II protein of SFV (Fig. 2D ). In addition, binding of DENV E DI/II protein to pr was inhibited by preincubation with mAb 4G2 against the fusion loop (molar ratio 1:1) (data not shown). Determination of the affinity of pr-E binding was not performed as the data did not fit to a simple Langmuir model of 1:1 binding, presumably because of E protein aggregation at low pH.",

Structural considerations suggested that this inhibition occurs primarily by blocking low pH-triggered dissociation of the E dimer, a required first step in the fusion reaction. To test this mechanism, we evaluated the effect of pr on the membrane interactions of dimeric and monomeric forms of E protein. The E9 dimer was preincubated with pr peptide or an unrelated protein with the same affinity tag for 5 min at pH 8.0, and then treated at pH 5.75 in the presence of target liposomes. Membrane-associated proteins were separated by liposome floatation on sucrose gradients. There was no liposome cofloatation when E9 protein was incubated with liposomes at neutral pH (Fig. 3A) . About 70% of the total E9 floated with liposomes in the top part of the sucrose gradient after treatment at pH 5.75 in the presence (Fig. 3A , top panel) or absence (data not shown) of a control protein. In contrast, when E9 was preincubated with pr peptide (pr:E9 molar ratio 12:1) and treated with low pH, only ,2% of E9-ST floated with the liposomes (Fig. 3A , middle panel). Inhibition by pr was not observed when it was added after E9 was treated at low pH in the presence of liposomes for 30 min (Fig. 3A , bottom panel), and thus pr needed to be present during the membrane insertion step. Inhibition was concentrationdependent, with 22% E9 co-floatation at a pr:E9 molar ratio of 3:1, 8% at 6:1, and 0.4% for 24:1 (data not shown; see also We then tested the effect of pr on the DENV E DI/II protein. This protein is monomeric and its stable membrane interaction requires DIII to ''clamp'' the core trimer [30] . As shown in Fig. 3B , ,25% of DI/II co-floated with liposomes at low pH in the present of DIII, while no co-floatation was detected when BSA was Figure 3 . Pr peptide inhibits E protein-membrane interaction. A) E9-liposome co-floatation assay. E9 protein was mixed with pr peptide or an ST-tagged control protein (Seap) at a final concentration of 50 mg E9 protein and 200 mg pr/Seap protein/ml (molar ratio 12 pr/1E). Liposomes were added at a final concentration of 1 mM, and the samples were incubated at the indicated pH for a total of 60 min at 28uC. Where indicated, E9 protein plus liposomes were incubated for 30 min, pr peptide added to a final concentration of 200 mg/ml, and the incubation continued for an additional 30 min. The liposome-bound proteins were then separated by floatation on sucrose gradients at the indicated pH. Aliquots of the top, middle and bottom of the gradients were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and western blotting for E protein. B) DI/II-liposome co-floatation assay. 40 mg/ml DI/II plus DIII or BSA (200 mg protein/ ml) were incubated with liposomes plus 200 mg pr peptide/ml as indicated and assayed for liposome co-floatation as in panel 3A. C) SFV DI/II-liposome co-floatation assay. SFV DI/II protein (40 mg/ml) was mixed with BSA or pr peptide (160 mg/ml). Liposomes were added at a final concentration of 1 mM, and the samples were incubated at the indicated pH for a total of 30 min at 28uC. Liposome co-flotation was assayed as in panel 3A.

E9 protein was mixed with liposomes in the presence or absence of pr peptide (molar ratio ,12 pr/1E), treated at the indicated pH as in The structurally related alphavirus protein SFV E1 DI/II is monomeric and efficiently interacts with membranes at low pH (80% cofloatation, Fig. 3C , middle panel). No inhibition occurred when pr peptide was added prior to liposome addition (Fig. 3C , bottom panel), in keeping with the lack of pr-SFV DI/II binding in the SPR experiments discussed above. Thus, pr peptide specifically inhibits target membrane interaction of both monomeric and dimeric forms of the DENV E protein.",

In order to test the ability of exogenous pr peptide to interact with and inhibit intact DENV, we took advantage of a previously described assay that monitors low pH-triggered fusion of DENV with cells [41] . In this fusion-infection assay, virus is prebound to target cells on ice, and then treated at 37uC for 1 min at low pH to trigger virus fusion with the plasma membrane. This fusion reaction is then quantitated by detecting the infected cells by immunofluorescence. We tested the effect of pr peptide during this 1 min low pH treatment using DENV1 WP and DENV2 NGC. The sequence of E DI/II is 68% identical between these two serotypes. Both serotypes showed efficient fusion and infection after treatment at pH 6.0, with about a 10-fold increase compared to samples treated at pH 7.9 (Fig. 4 ). The addition of pr peptide during the 1 min low pH treatment strongly inhibited DENV fusion and infection. Inhibition was dose-dependent, with 45-49% inhibition at 6 mM pr and 81-85-% inhibition at 30 mM pr. In contrast, pr did not inhibit low pH-triggered fusion by the alphavirus SIN (Fig. 4) . Thus, exogenous DENV2 pr peptide can specifically interact with mature DENV1 and DENV2 to block virus fusion and infection. We did not observe inhibition when DENV was preincubated with 30 mM pr at pH 7.0 and then added to target cells in a standard infection assay, suggesting that under these conditions an inhibitory concentration of pr was not present during low pH-triggered fusion reaction in the endosome. This result also indicates that the presence of pr did not affect virus-cell binding.",

In contrast, almost no H244A DI/II protein was pulled-down by pr-sepharose at either low pH or neural pH (Fig. 5B ). SPR analysis of WT DI/II protein showed most efficient binding at pH 6.0, and binding was blocked by preincubating the DI/II protein with mAb 4G2 (molar ratio 1:1) before dilution into SPR buffer (Fig. 5C, upper panel) . Equivalent concentrations of H244A DI/II protein showed greatly reduced binding to pr compared to that of WT protein (Fig. 5C , lower panel). Although H244A binding was decreased, the residual binding was still blocked by mAb 4G2 and had an acidic pH optimum.

In agreement with the results in Fig. 3C , floatation of the WT protein was blocked by inclusion of pr during the membrane insertion step (Fig. 6) . In contrast, the efficiency of floatation of the H244A mutant protein was 43% in the absence of pr and 47% in the presence of pr. Thus, the H244A mutation did not inhibit E-membrane interaction but made that interaction insensitive to the presence of pr.",

Efficient DENV particle production is dependent on E protein folding, particle budding into the ER, and subsequent particle egress through the secretory pathway. To investigate these issues, we took advantage of the ability of the flavivirus prM and E proteins to assemble into virus-like particles (VLP) in the absence of other viral components or virus infection [44, 45, 46 ]. The VLP system avoids complications arising from selection of revertants of deleterious virus mutations such as H244A. Flavivirus VLP bud into the ER in the immature prM form, undergo furin maturation during transport through the secretory pathway, and display similar low pH- [34] , potential key residues in pr-E interaction are indicated by their numbers in the DENV2 NGC proteins.

After 36 h induction with tetracycline, both WT and H244A cells show abundant intracellular expression of the DENV1 E protein as detected by immunofluorescence, while the parent cell line is negative for E expression (Fig. 8A) . To evaluate whether WT and H244A E proteins were correctly folded, cells were induced for 36 h, lysed, and immunoprecipitated with a rabbit polyclonal antibody to E DIII, and with two conformation-specific mAbs. mAb 4E11 recognizes a discontinuous epitope on DENV E DIII and requires proper DIII disulfide bond formation for recognition [49, 50] . mAb 4G2 recognizes the fusion loop at the tip of flavivirus E DII and its epitope is sensitive to reduction [51] . Expression studies have shown that the 4G2 epitope is not formed if the E protein is expressed in the absence of prM [52] , indicating that this epitope is particularly useful for diagnostic tests of prM's chaperone interaction with E (see also reference [37] ). As shown in Fig. 8B , lysates from cells induced to express prM plus WT or H244A E proteins showed strong reactivity with all three antibodies. Quantitation of multiple experiments confirmed that WT and H244A E proteins were comparably recognized by the 4E11 and 4G2 mAbs. Thus, by these criteria H244A E protein interacts with prM protein and is correctly folded. This result also agrees with our finding that truncated H244A E protein expressed with prM in the S2 cell system was fully active in low pH-dependent membrane binding and trimerization, suggesting correct folding (Fig. 6) . . DENV E H244A mutation inhibits release of virus-like particles via a low pH-dependent mechanism. A) WT and H244A mutant E proteins are comparably expressed. Stable cells inducibly expressing the WT or H244A mutant forms of prM-E were treated with tetracycline for 36 h at 37uC. E protein expression was detected by immunofluorescence and the nuclei were stained with DAPI. Fluorescence images are shown at the same magnification and exposure time. Bar represents 30 mm. B) WT and H244A mutant E proteins are comparably immunoprecipitated by conformation-specific mAbs. Stable cells inducibly expressing the WT or H244A mutant forms of prM-E were treated with tetracycline for 36 h at 37uC. E proteins in the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated by Sango, a rabbit polyclonal antibody to DIII, and by the mouse mAbs 4G2 and 4E11, as indicated at the top of the panel. Samples were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and western blot using mouse anti-DENV2 Ab for the Sango samples and Sango for the mAbs samples. Asterisks indicate the positions of the IgG and IgG heavy chain, which cross-react in the western blot. Equivalent sample input was evaluated by western blot for b-actin (lower panel). C) Effect of low pH on WT and H244A VLP production. WT and H244A mutant cells were incubated with tetracycline for 2 h and then in this medium plus 20mM NH 4 Cl where indicated for a total of 36h. VLP released in the culture media were pelleted by ultracentrifugation, and E proteins in the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated using mAb 4G2. VLP and lysate samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and western blot using Sango. 5-fold more culture media from the H244A cells than the WT cells were loaded.

Analysis by western blotting showed strong E protein expression in both WT and H244A cells, and no expression in the parent cells (Fig. 8C) . The WT cells released E protein in VLP, but VLP release from cells expressing the H244A mutant E protein was greatly reduced (Fig. 8C, -media samples) . This result is in keeping with the hypothesis that the H244A cells assemble VLP in the neutral pH environment of the ER but that VLP release is inhibited by the lack of pr protection from the low pH of the secretory pathway. To test this idea, we induced WT and H244A prM-E expression and cultured the cells in the presence of 20 mM NH 4 Cl to neutralize the acidic pH in the Golgi and TGN compartments (Fig. 8C , +NH 4 Cl lanes). The cellular expression level of either E protein was not significantly affected by NH 4 Cl treatment, and WT VLP production was similar in NH 4 Cl-treated cells and untreated cells. However, production of VLP containing the H244A mutant E protein was increased 4-7 fold in NH 4 Cl-treated cells.

In addition to this important role of prM during E protein synthesis, a variety of data suggest that the interaction of pr peptide with the viral E protein protects flaviviruses from low pH during their transport through the exocytic pathway [34, 35, 36] . Here we showed that a recombinant pr peptide was efficiently folded, glycosylated, and secreted from 293T cells in the absence of its normal prM context and furin processing. Recombinant pr bound to soluble E proteins at low pH, inhibited E-membrane insertion, and interacted with mature dengue virus to block fusion and infection. Alanine substitution of the conserved E H244 within the pr-E interface disrupted pr-E binding in vitro and blocked secondary virus infection. VLP production was inhibited by the H244A mutation and partially rescued by pH neutralization with NH 4 Cl.

In situ measurements indicate that the pH of the TGN is ,6 [53] , while the pH optimum of DENV2 NGC fusion is ,6.2 [41] . The low pH of the TGN is critical for the rearrangement of immature DENV to allow furin cleavage, but once the virus is processed it becomes fusion-active in this same pH range. Thus the pH dependence of the pr-E interaction appears optimized to protect DENV during its continued transit through the secretory pathway. Pr's inhibition of E membrane insertion was less efficient at a pH value (pH 5.0) similar to that in the late endocytic pathway (Fig. 3D-E) . This loss of pr inhibition at more acidic pH could help to explain the recent finding that infection by immature DENV is enhanced by antibodies to prM [42] . The antibodybound immature virus is likely to be endocytosed and processed by cellular furin in the endocytic pathway [54] . The lower pH conditions of the late endocytic pathway could then cause the loss of pr inhibition and allow virus fusion.",

This suggested that pr might primarily block virus-membrane interaction by preventing dissociation of E dimers, a required first step in the fusion pathway [55] . Our results show efficient binding of pr to the dimeric form of the DENV E protein, but also to the monomeric DI/II form. We do not know if the E9 protein dimer is stabilized by pr interaction or if the dimer dissociates prior to interaction with pr, and experiments to address these points were inconclusive (data not shown). The similar pH dependence of pr binding to monomeric and dimeric E proteins suggests that pr may bind the same site in both cases. mAb 4G2 against the fusion loop inhibited pr interaction with E DI/II, confirming that pr was binding to the DII tip rather than to other sites on expressed E proteins. In keeping with its binding site in the vicinity of the fusion loop, pr peptide blocked the membrane insertion and liposome co-floatation of E9 and DI/II proteins. Prior studies showed that a monomeric DI/II protein with a single Strep affinity tag stably inserts into liposomes at either neutral or low pH [30] , and pr blocked this insertion even at pH 8.0 where its interaction with DI/II was suboptimal (data not shown). Thus, while the pr-E interaction is strongly low pH-dependent, its functional inhibition of membrane insertion can still be observed at neutral pH in the presence of excess pr.",

Experiments in TBEV evaluated particle production and membrane fusion activity using a VLP system [56] . Mutation of H248 (TBE numbering) to A or I blocks VLP secretion, in agreement with our results. However, an H248N mutant efficiently produces VLP, and these particles show WT levels of fusion activity. WNV E H246A or Q mutations inhibit release of infectious reporter virus particles from cells, as do a number of other substitutions at this position [57] . Replacement of H246 with aromatic residues such as phenylalanine allows both particle release and infectivity. An H244A mutation in DENV2 NGC inhibits infectious virus production [43] . E H244 and its interacting partners D63 and D65 on pr are conserved within the flaviviruses, and thus these data from several flaviviruses plus our DENV results support an important role for the E 244 position. However, a histidine residue at this position does not seem to be strictly required for particle production, suggesting that substitutions such as 244F and 244N can support the interaction of E with pr.",

Mutant protein secretion was somewhat reduced, with the final yield of DI/II H244A about half that of the WT protein in two separate preparations (data not shown), suggesting some effects of nonoptimal pr interaction. However, unlike the E protein in virus or VLP, the truncated DI/II protein lacks the TM region and does not mediate membrane fusion, and thus may be relatively independent of the pH-protection function of pr. The purified WT and mutant DI/II proteins were able to bind liposomes and form core trimers that were stabilized by DIII (Fig. 6) . Thus, the mutant protein is correctly folded and active in membrane insertion. Studies with conformation-specific mAbs also provided evidence for the correct folding of H244A E protein (Fig. 8B) . Together, these results suggest that the H244A E protein is still able to access the chaperone functions of prM, while its decreased pr binding indicates that it can no longer utilize the pH protection functions of pr.",

The membrane insertion and trimerization activity of H244A suggest that the full-length mutant protein would be fusion-active on such VLP once they are transported from the neutral pH of the ER to the low pH of the Golgi and TGN [31] . Thus, the decreased release of H244A VLP and its partial rescue by neutralization of the exocytic pathway support a critical role for pr in protecting DENV from exocytic low pH, and suggest that virus/VLP fuses in the TGN in the absence of pr-E interaction. Rescue of H244A VLP production by NH 4 Cl was clearly incomplete. This may be due to complex aspects of both virus and cell, such as direct effects of the H244A mutation on particle assembly in the ER, or difficulties in blocking fusion of a virus with the relatively high pH threshold of DENV.",

An inhibitor of pr interaction could make E protein susceptible to premature fusion in the TGN and could thus block virus production similar to the H244A mutation. It is also possible that small molecule inhibitors of pr-E binding could interact directly with the DII tip on mature virus particles, perhaps stabilizing the dimer and/or blocking membrane insertion of the fusion loop, thereby blocking virus fusion.
