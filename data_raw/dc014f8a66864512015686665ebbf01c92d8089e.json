This is consistent with Kiviniemi's study on the willingness to be vaccinated where only 16% of the population would want to be vaccinated, in contrast to the 98% willing to adopt preventative measures such as hand washing [19] . The Protection Motivation Theory postulates that perceived vulnerability increases compliance with vaccination and precautionary measures [20] . In our study, perception of being at low risk proved a greater deterrent than potential side-effects. This is in accordance with the above theory and Van Der Weerd's study in the Netherlands, where willingness to be vaccinated increased six-fold between the time that the WHO announced a pandemic alert level of phase five to the infection causing its first deaths in the country [20] . Vaccination could be increased by campaigns emphasising how low risk groups can still transmit the infection to more vulnerable family members, even if only mildly unwell themselves, and that severe influenza can still affect groups perceived to be at low risk of severe disease.",

Moreover, participants thought that both the government and the media had exaggerated the threat posed by the pandemic. This is in contrast to Fogarty's risk communication study which concluded that television reporting of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 pandemic was not generally alarmist [22] . This might have led to decreased risk perception, which as demonstrated in Lau's study in Hong Kong during the SARS epidemic, has been shown to undermine the credibility of authorities [23] .",
