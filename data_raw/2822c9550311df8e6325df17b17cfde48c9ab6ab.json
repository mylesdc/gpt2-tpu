            "text": "We created an immunosensing platform for the detection of proteins in a buffer solution. Our sensing platform relies on graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets conjugated with antibodies to provide quantitative binding sites for analyte proteins. When analyte proteins and standard fluorescein-labelled proteins are competing for the binding sites, the assay exhibits quantitative fluorescence quenching by GO for the fluorescein-labelled proteins as determined by the analyte protein concentration. Because of this mechanism, measured fluorescence intensity from unquenched fluorescein-labelled protein was shown to increase with an increasing analyte protein concentration. As an alternative to the conventional enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), our method does not require an enzyme-linked second antibody for protein recognition and the enzyme for optical signal measurement. Thus, it is beneficial with its low cost and fewer systematic errors caused by the series of antigen-antibody recognition steps in ELISA. Immune globulin G (IgG) was introduced as a model protein to test our method and our results showed that the limit of detection for IgG was 4.67 pmol mL \u22121 in the buffer solution. This sensing mechanism could be developed into a promising biosensor for the detection of proteins, which would broaden the spectrum of GO applications in both analytical biochemistry and clinical diagnosis.",

However, the accuracy of ELISA is affected by a few shortcomings intrinsic to the technique. For example, the uncertainty of the recognition between antibody and antigens could cause false signals 1-3 the ELISA plates made of polystyrene lack definitive chemical surface properties to provide chemical binding of the protein 4 ; and intricate procedures such as \"plate cleaning\" increase opportunities for systemic and human errors. In recent years, many research groups have tried to improve the accuracy of ELISA by synthesizing new ELISA polymer substitutes 4 , introducing nanomaterials 5, 6 , employing more sensitive biomarkers 7 , and applying monoclonal antibodies 8 . All of these studies were restricted by the framework of traditional ELISA, which still relies on ELISA plates, and the problems mentioned above remain unsolved. Obviously, new immunosorbent assay techniques call for quantitative surface sites for antibody binding and fewer steps or reagents in the whole process to avoid the above-mentioned drawbacks.",

            "text": "Herein we present a sensing platform based on graphene oxide (GO) with definitive surface binding sites as an alternative sensing platform to that of ELISA plates. The mechanism is illustrated in Fig. 1 . Human IgG was chosen as a model protein to test our design. The antibody-conjugated GO surface was able to specifically bind with both a regular IgG protein (analyte) and a fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labelled IgG protein (standard, mentioned as IgG-FITC below), thus exhibiting competitive binding of the 2 types of IgG proteins. The amount of analyte IgG protein controls the adsorption of IgG-FITC as well as the degree of its fluorescence quenching by GO. As shown in Fig. 1 , when analyte IgG proteins are present to compete for the available binding sites, few IgG-FITCs adsorb on the remaining binding sites, resulting in fluorescence signals from unquenched free IgG-FITCs. Thus, the fluorescence intensity increases with an increasing amount of analyte IgG protein, given the sensing principle of our method. In the following, we briefly outline the experimental methods and then present the results in detail, followed by a discussion. First, GO was chemically modified with rabbit anti-human IgG antibody by forming of a peptide bond between the carboxyl of GO and the amino group of the antibody. This surface provides antibody mediate binding sites that are superior to ELISA plate surfaces made of polystyrene, which rely on physical adsorption. Then, analyte IgG proteins in increasing concentrations were added to a set of buffer solutions containing antibody-conjugated GO. After adsorption of analyte IgG proteins on part of the binding sites, FITC-labelled IgG proteins with a certain concentration were also added to the above set of solutions. In this case, the GO surface not only played a role as a binding platform but also as an energy acceptor [9] [10] [11] [12] to quench the fluorescence of IgG-FITC 9,10 . Since quenching occurs in close proximity 13 , only the IgG-FITCs that were adsorbed on antibody-conjugated GO would be quenched [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . As the number density of the binding sites was limited on the modified GO, more adsorbed analyte IgG proteins resulted in a stronger fluorescence signal from free IgG-FITCs in the solutions. In essence, the analyte IgG proteins control the fluorescence quenching and determine the fluorescence intensity of the whole system. Within a certain concentration range, one can generate a linear plot correlating the IgG-FITC fluorescence intensity with the analyte IgG concentration. According to our results, we achieved a limit of detection (LOD) of 4.67 pmol mL \u22121 .",

After activation by EDC-NHS, GO exhibits an increased thickness of about 4 nm, similar to what was reported before 4, 19 . The line scan (arrow) gives a corresponding cross-sectional height profile in Fig. 2(d) , showing a uniform surface of the GO. Because the antibody is very large (with a molecular weight of over 150 kDa), one can correctly expect that the antibody-conjugated GO should be much thicker. As shown in Fig. 2 (c), we observed that the height of antibody-conjugated GO increased dramatically, with a typical thickness of about 10 nm, as suggested in the height profile in Fig. 2 (d). Some bright peaks were observed on this sample, which was also similar to what Hosseini et al. had observed 4 . The bright peaks are likely due to the accumulation of antibodies on the GO surface. All of the surface morphology results implied that the antibody was successfully retained on the GO surface.",

As we expected, the fluorescence of the free IgG-FITCs decreased when the IgG-FITCs bound to the graphene surfaces. In Fig. 3(a) , a rapid decrease of fluorescence intensity was observed with the increasing amount of bare GO, exhibiting a quenching efficiency of about 90% with 10 \u03bc g mL \u22121 of GO. The signal change versus GO concentration is plotted in Fig. 3(d) . The quenching efficiency of antibody-conjugated GO may be lower than bare GO, because the modification of GO with antibodies changed the electronic property of GO, changing GO to a semiconductor 19 and making the transfer of energy from the excited state of FITC to bare GO easier than that to antibody-conjugated GO. In Fig. 3(b) , the fluorescence intensity also decreased with the increasing amount of antibody-conjugated GO, and the quenching efficiency indeed dropped to about 60% at 200 \u03bc g mL \u22121 , showing antibody-modified GO could still be a quencher. With 100 \u03bc g mL \u22121 of antibody-conjugated GO, about 30% of IgG-FITC initial fluorescence had been quenched, as can be seen in Fig. 3(d) .

If the fluorescence of IgG-FITCs will be quenched no matter if it is free or attached to the GO surface, the design is meaningless. By blocking the GO surface with 2% BSA in the buffer solution, we found that the fluorescence intensity change remained almost unchanged with increasing amount of BSA-blocked GO. Only the IgG-FITCs adsorbed on the surface of the GO could be quenched. According to our results, the appropriate concentration of antibody-conjugated GO was 100 \u03bc g mL \u22121 (~30% quenching). Although more GO might quench the fluorescence even further, a higher antibody-conjugated GO concentration could be less sensitive for sensing the analyte IgG with a very small concentration. Therefore, there is a delicate balance between the concentration of GO and the change of fluorescence signal. In the following experiment, antibody-conjugated GO always had a concentration of 100 \u03bc g mL \u22121 .",

In order to know whether other biological molecules might interfere with the sensing process and give false positive signals, we performed a series of experiments to determine more about the specificity of our assay. Some interference molecules, such as human serum albumin (HSA), BSA, and IgG, were introduced to test the selectivity. In this set of parallel testing, the signals from the solutions containing the above interference substances, analyte IgG, and blank sample without analyte IgG were compared. The results in Fig. 5 clearly show that the 3 possible interfering biomolecules gave no detectable signal change, as compared with the blank sample. Only the analyte IgG protein showed a significant positive signal as the fluorescence intensity of the other proteins was close to the blank sample.

With the competitive binding of analyte IgG and standard IgG-FITC the surface of GO's limited binding sites, the process conveniently paves a way to control free IgG-FITC in the solution by analyte IgG adsorption on the binding sites. The increase of fluorescence signal from IgG-FITC correlates directly with an increasing analyte IgG concentration. The assay based on antibody-conjugated GO does not require any phase separation steps or wash steps as with commercial ELISA procedures, which are used to remove unadsorbed antibodies. Thus, our assay is beneficial since it uses fewer reagents, has a lower cost, and there are fewer opportunities for systematic and human errors. The LOD was 4.67 pmol mL \u22121 , which still leaves room for further improvement. The sensing mechanism in this study could become a viable immunosensor platform for the detection of proteins, which will broaden the spectrum of graphene oxide applications in both analytical biochemistry and clinical diagnosis.",
