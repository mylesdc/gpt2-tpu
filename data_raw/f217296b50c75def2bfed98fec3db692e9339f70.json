Encouraged by the discoveries this facilitated, life science leaders convened summits that extended the call for openness to other types of datasets [8] . Major public health research funders agreed to increase the availability of research data and to promote the use of those data to accelerate advances in public health [9] .

Sometimes, scientific products meet criteria for open access, open data, or open source after some time has elapsed since their production (e.g., \"delayed open access\" journals make content available only to subscribers initially and then make it open access later, typically after 1-2 years). An expansive version of open science is open notebook science, in which the entire primary record of research, including the researcher's personal or laboratory notebook, is freely available online as it is recorded [6] .
