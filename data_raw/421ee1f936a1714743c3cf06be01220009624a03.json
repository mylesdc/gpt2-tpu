SARS caused a pandemic that spread throughout mainland China for 7 months, infecting 5318 persons in 194 administrative regions. Using detailed mainland China epidemiological data, we study spatiotemporal aspects of this person-to-person contagious disease and simulate its spatiotemporal transmission dynamics via the Bayesian Maximum Entropy (BME) method. The BME reveals that SARS outbreaks show autocorrelation within certain spatial and temporal distances. We use BME to fit a theoretical covariance model that has a sine hole spatial component and exponential temporal component and obtain the weights of geographical and temporal autocorrelation factors. Using the covariance model, SARS dynamics were estimated and simulated under the most probable conditions. Our study suggests that SARS transmission varies in its epidemiological characteristics and SARS outbreak distributions exhibit palpable clusters on both spatial and temporal scales. In addition, the BME modelling demonstrates that SARS transmission features are affected by spatial heterogeneity, so we analyze potential causes. This may benefit epidemiological control of pandemic infectious diseases.",

SARS is caused by a new pathogen that was finally identified as a coronavirus (SARS-Cov) [1, 2] . SARS-Cov is regarded as a person-to-person infectious disease that infects suspected individuals through droplet transmission [3] . After infection, patients go through a 2-to-10-day incubation period before typical symptoms (fever, cough, and body aches) appear. During the incubation period, the patients are contagious to surrounding people [4] . To date, there is no vaccine for SARS, no reliable diagnostic test, and no specific treatment. This leads to the need for refinement of public health controls to be effective [5, 6] .",

            "text": "The evidence shows patterns of vast geographic transmission that distinguish SARS from other epidemic infectious diseases. Traditionally, epidemiologists focus on the temporal epidemic evolution and describe it through various types of mechanical models [4, 10, 11] . Riley models have been unable to effectively explain its dynamics. As a result, the pandemic cannot be explained as a combination of endemics. Complex spatial transmission networks [12] , compound period epidemics, and overwhelming government controls inspired epidemiologists to research this type of person-to-person infectious disease more profoundly with respect to its geographic features. Dye and Gay [13] suggested that doing so could lead to variations in average contact rate. Lloyd-Smith et al. simulated SARS dynamics in a complex network based on an epidemiological mechanism with full consideration of population, contact rate, control strategies, and spatial diffusion [14, 15] . However, their approach requires the assumption of numerous parameters, which in turn require the support of detailed data. The approach makes it difficult to explain overall spatial transmission without geographic epidemic analysis. Wang et al. [7] unveiled the broad existence of spatial clusters during the Beijing epidemic periods, influencing government intervention [16] . This work inspired us to investigate spatial principles in SARS transmission, which could include significant indications for pandemics within a more general perspective. A study that combines both a temporal epidemic study and spatial transmission is required to understand SARS dynamics. Recent advances in geostatistical analysis, which have been effectively used in infectious disease mapping, health risk assessment, and epidemiological studies, could be applied in SARS research for spatiotemporal analysis [17, 18] . The Bayesian Maximum Entropy (BME) approach of modern geostatistics incorporates higher-order statistical estimation for space-time epidemic phenomena and has shown more accurate mapping results than those derived from linear kriging geostatistics [19] . We benefited from such advantages in investigating statistical features of the SARS epidemic and in simulating geographic transmission aspects on a day-byday basis. We focused on exploring and understanding spatial heterogeneity impacts of SARS transmission and simulating and mapping the disease temporally. Under the increasing threat of pandemics in 21st century, the present study illustrates actual epidemic spread and provides useful information toward establishing government intervention to preventing pandemics.",

Even though some cases were recorded at locations using various scales, the records were eventually sorted at county level to facilitate processing. Considering that population movement is one of the effects on SARS diffusion, the following order was observed in the geocoding process: (1) registered permanent residence; (2) temporary residence (work address); (3) onset location; and (4) reporting unit location. To maintain rigorous containment, sanitary departments collected minute information for spatial indexing. Thus, the registered permanent residence was selected as the first index for the benefit of data integrity and for monitoring the impact of mass population movement. On February 1, 2003, during the period of SARS outbreaks, the Spring Festival took place. People commonly travel to join family for this traditional Chinese festival, returning to their permanent residence after 1-4 weeks. This population movement increased the probability of cross infection among family members and travellers. Consequently, with some exceptions, the temporary residence, onset, and reporting unit locations could be additional spatial information in geocoding the infections. Some cases lacked records of both permanent residence and workplace, and the only available addresses for these were syndrome onset locations. If all the above addresses were void, the hospital address was used as the only thread to locate the patient, although this was rare in our research. We focused on outbreak regions for convenience and clarity in the process. There are 194 counties in the focus area, which is described in greater detail in subsequent sections. Among them, Beijing, Guangzhou, and Taiyuan experienced the most severe SARS outbreaks. We used a 2002 county-level digital map to illustrate the epidemic ( Figure 3 ).",

Because it is impossible to know the infection date accurately for a patient, incubation period data are unavailable. Therefore, onset date was the first temporal index in our research. If this date was unavailable, then the hospitalization date was used as a secondary index.",

In infectious disease research, and especially the study of person-to-person contagious diseases, epidemic conditions are closely related to both spatial and temporal dimensions. Thus, proper relationships must be constructed to combine and account for the space-time continuum. BME provides an effective stochastic method, based on a cogent theoretical and technological strategy, to analyze relationships of SARS outbreaks in the composite space-time domain.

This conversion typically introduces additional uncertainty into the result, because we effectively approximate the spatial reference for each observation.

SARS is a typical personto-person, rapidly spreading infectious disease, and it takes about 60 days to spread from an affected area to adjacent ones.",

            "text": "The process of outbreak spread to the adjacent areas is a stochastic one, owing to the synergistic effect of three factors. First, the SARS outbreaks were related to population density. Urban areas have higher population density than rural and residential areas, so for an outbreak in a city, it is more likely that it will spread within the urban limits than outside those limits. For example, among the total 5318 cases, 1934 were recorded in Beijing. This number is much higher than the number of outbreak cases observed in nearby cities and entire counties. Second, cities typically have convenient transportation to nearby cities and counties. Thus, commuting and population exchange between cities and nearby locations is likely to be much greater than corresponding activity between those cities and more distant areas. Consequently, suspected individuals from the nearby countryside are more likely to have travelled to a city and contacted infected people, and vice versa. This would increase the probability that the disease spreads in urban areas and their environs. The third and final factor is that control measures limit population transport, so the disease is likelier to have greater spread over nearby areas.",

            "text": "Following the SARS outbreaks, the Chinese government established strict control measures for quarantine of the suspect population. People travelling from affected areas were mandated to undergo several diagnostic tests during their trip. As a result, the entire transportation system worked as a rigorous diagnostic tool for potential SARS cases, and all train, airplane, and long-distance bus passengers were surveilled for the epidemic. Among the measures, individual travellers had their temperature taken. If this was above 37.5 \u2218 C, the individual would be forced into a state of quarantine in isolation wards until the temperature recovered to normal levels. Such strict measures were effective in restricting outbreak spread to limited areas for each city [26, 27] . BME estimation led to informative results, shown in the plot of Figure 6 and the maps of Figure 7 . This output reveals higher temporal correlation and relatively low spatial correlation for the SARS outbreaks and could be summarized in the following three priority rules of spreading: first, spreading occurs within the city; second, stochastic spreading occurs between the city and the towns closest to it; finally, stochastic spreading takes place across different cities through quick transportation.",

            "text": "The population density is an explanatory factor for the fact that SARS spread is mostly in urban areas. Approximately 19% of people working in health services were infected by their patients. These professionals were able to obtain rapid treatment, which means that it was unlikely that they would contribute to SARS spread outside their areas of residence. Housewives and retired people are groups that were extremely susceptible to infection by their families. However, these population groups typically have no desire to move to distant places. The most probable suspects for disease spread were labourers and businessmen, but these groups constituted only \u223c7% of total infection cases. The randomness of SARS spread among various cities is a characteristic that has been explained via the theory of super spreaders. The starting point of this theory is that the SARS virus always evolves and mutates. Most virus strings evolve slowly with similar infectivity, but a small fraction evolve into extremely infective virus types. People affected by such virus strings are so-called super spreaders. These individuals were comparatively very contagious, and they transmitted the virus to dozens of other people. For instance, five super spreaders in Singapore were found to have infected 103 people [28, 29] . The randomness of virus mutation to high infectivity indicates considerable randomness in the way people became infected. This randomness also extended to the relatively random directions in which the epidemic spread among cities.",

In the present study, spatial and temporal aspects of this person-to-person contagious disease were explored, and its spatial and temporal transmission dynamics were simulated through the BME method. Based on these analyses, it is concluded that SARS transmission varies in its epidemiological characteristics. Moreover, there was a high temporal correlation and relatively low spatial correlation of SARS outbreaks. In addition, the BME modelling demonstrated that SARS transmission features are affected by spatial heterogeneity. Therefore, we analyzed potential causes, including infected populations and transportation modes. Our findings can benefit epidemiological control of pandemic infectious diseases and public health protection in the future.",
