RNA viruses during replication produce double-stranded RNA intermediates (PAMPs), which are detected by cellular receptors (PRRs). Poly(I:C) is a known double-stranded RNA analogue (activator) which is detected by sensors such as TLR3 (black), RIGI and MDA5 (blue, CARD domains in yellow) in a cell. These sensors, when stimulated by the activator, lead to the expression of interferons (IFN\u03b2) and inflammatory genes (TNF\u03b1, IL1\u03b2, IL8) through adaptor proteins (MAVS and MyD88) and signal mediators such as NF\u03baB (orange and yellow subunits) and IRF3. NF\u03baB is retained in an inactive state in the cytoplasm by inhibitory molecules such as I\u03baB (blue). Upon receiving an activation signal via a sensor, kinases (TBK1) phosphorylate IRF3, which then translocates to the nucleus to activate transcription. Kinases, such as IKK \u03b1, \u03b2 or \u03b3 phosphorylate I\u03baB inhibitors and mark them for degradation, thereby activating NF\u03baB. Active NF\u03baB then causes expression of downstream genes by translocating to the nucleus.",

To further explore the low TNF\u03b1 response in bat cells, we analyzed the E. fuscus TNF\u03b1 promoter for transcription factor binding motifs and identified a potential binding site for c-Rel proto-oncoprotein, a known suppressor of gene expression 36 . Ectopically expressed c-Rel bound to DNA containing this motif and the protein localized to the nucleus of bat cells in response to poly(I:C). Deletion of this motif in the promoter enhanced activation by poly(I:C) and partial knockdown of bat c-Rel RNA by specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) increased basal levels of TNF\u03b1 transcripts in bat cells. We could detect c-Rel transcripts in every major big brown bat tissue, such as spleen, gut, ileum, kidney, lung, liver and the bat kidney cell line, unlike in humans, where it is found predominantly in hematopoetic cells 37 . Finally, we could also demonstrate that bat c-Rel bound to the potential motif as promoters containing the motif were co-immunoprecipitated to higher levels than promoters that lacked this motif. Our results suggest that bats might have evolved a unique mechanism to suppress an exaggerated inflammatory response to viruses.",

We observed a heightened innate response with poly(I:C) in bat cells but not as much with ssRNA and CpG ODN (see Supplementary Table S2 ). We therefore decided to further analyse the cytokine response in bat and human cells to poly(I:C). While both MRC5 and Efk3 cells responded to poly(I:C) with a robust increase in IFN\u03b2 transcripts ( Fig. 2a) , only MRC5 cells responded with increased levels of TNF\u03b1 RNA (Fig. 2b ). Poly(I:C)-treated Efk3 cells contained, on an average, 2.4 fold more TNF\u03b1 transcripts than mock-treated cells, as compared to a 315-fold increase in human cells (Fig. 2b) . We therefore examined further the response of these two genes. To determine when IFN\u03b2 and TNF\u03b1 transcripts are expressed following poly(I:C) treatment, we quantified IFN\u03b2 and TNF\u03b1 transcripts in MRC5 and Efk3 cells at different times after poly(I:C) treatment. Both MRC5 and Efk3 cells showed highest IFN\u03b2 transcript levels at 9 h post-transfection (Fig. 2c) . TNF\u03b1 transcript levels were highest at 12 h post-transfection in MRC5 cells and there was relatively little expression in Efk3 cells (Fig. 2d ). To rule out the possibility of Efk3 cells not being able to mount a TNF\u03b1 response, we transfected bone marrow derived myeloid cells from big brown bat long bones with poly(I:C). The mixed population of cells (see Supplemental Fig. S1 ) demonstrated an average of 1700-fold increase in IFN\u03b2 transcripts but only 11-fold increase in TNF\u03b1 transcripts (Fig. 2e ) post stimulation.",

Knocking down TLR3 transcripts significantly reduced IFN\u03b2 transcripts after poly(I:C) transfection (Fig. 3b) . Although knocking down RIGI also led to a decrease in IFN\u03b2 transcripts post poly(I:C) transfection, it was not significant (Fig. 3b) .

            "text": "Big brown bat TNF\u03b1 promoter has a unique c-Rel binding site. Since the big brown bat TNF\u03b1 promoter showed decreased activity post poly(I:C) stimulation, we examined the human TNF\u03b1 promoter and bat nucleotide sequence 1,200 bases upstream from the TNF\u03b1 coding sequence for potential transcription factor binding motifs using the bioinformatics tool PROMO 39 . Both promoters contained motifs for binding NF\u03baB although the big brown bat TNF\u03b1 promoter had one less site. In addition, the bat promoter had a putative c-Rel binding motif (Fig. 5 ) not present in the human counterpart. c-Rel inhibits big brown bat wildtype TNF\u03b1 promoter activity. By analyzing the nucleotide sequence of the big brown bat TNF\u03b1 promoter, we identified a potential c-Rel binding site. To identify the role of this binding motif in the big brown bat TNF\u03b1 promoter, we deleted it (Fig. 6a) and observed the promoter's activity in response to poly(I:C) in bat cells. Deleting the c-Rel binding site in the big brown bat TNF\u03b1 promoter increased the promoter activity in response to poly(I:C) (Fig. 6b) . To further identify the role of c-Rel in repressing the bat TNF\u03b1 promoter, we partially knocked down c-Rel transcripts using siRNA in bat cells (Fig. 6c) and quantified basal TNF\u03b1 transcripts. There was a significant increase in basal TNF\u03b1 transcripts in these cells (Fig. 6d) . We further confirmed that siRNA directed against c-Rel used in this study could successfully shutdown the expression of c-Rel at a protein level (see Supplemental Fig. S3 ).",

NF\u03baB plays a central role in the regulation of TNF\u03b1 gene expression. Different combinations of the subunits that make up NF\u03baB have vastly different effects on gene expression 18 . For instance, hetero-dimers of p50 or p52 and p65 or RelB activate transcription. In contrast, c-Rel as a homo-dimer or in association with p50 and p65, repress transcriptional activation by NF\u03baB 19 and c-Rel has been previously shown to be a repressor of certain gene promoters in human cells, such as Ephrin type-B receptor 2 (EPHB2) in colorectal cancer cells 36 . We detected a putative c-Rel binding motif in the big brown bat TNF\u03b1 promoter. Deleting this motif reversed the bat promoter activity after poly(I:C) treatment and partial knockdown of c-Rel RNA significantly increased basal TNF\u03b1 transcript levels in bat cells demonstrating the ability of c-Rel to repress the TNF\u03b1 promoter in bat cells.",

We do not know if having one less NF\u03baB binding site can be an additional reason for the low TNF\u03b1 promoter activity. However, adding an additional NF\u03baB binding site to the big brown bat promoter lacking the c-Rel binding site did not cause any further increase in promoter activity after poly(I:C) treatment (data not shown). c-Rel might not be the only regulator of inflammatory gene expression and big brown bats may have evolved more than one mechanism to regulate inflammatory responses. We evaluated a second inflammatory gene, IL1\u03b2 and found that it, like TNF\u03b1, did not respond to poly(I:C) in bat cells (see Supplementary Table S2 ). However, while the IL1\u03b2 promoter had identifiable NF\u03baB binding sites, it did not have a specific c-Rel binding site (data not shown). There is evidence that NF\u03baB molecules comprising p50 homodimers can act as transcriptional repressors (reviewed by Rothwarf and Karin 53 ). Further work is required to identify the role of p50 homodimers in bat cells.",

They suggest that the selection may have been driven by the involvement of c-Rel in DNA repair pathways and the need for efficient repair of damage caused by reactive oxygen species generated during flight. In addition, Ench\u00e9ry and Horvat have also speculated that the positive selection of c-Rel may contribute to bats' immunovirological peculiarities 55 . Our results suggest that the positive selection of c-Rel may also have been driven by the need to dampen the destructive effects of inflammation in response to viral infections. Zhang et al. also identified mutations in the REL homology domain (RHD) of c-Rel that could potentially affect the binding of I\u03baB and speculated that this may allow nuclear transport in the absence of TLR3 stimulation 54 . These mutations are also present in big brown bat c-Rel (see Supplementary Fig. S4 ). However, we did find that while ectopically expressed bat c-Rel was present in both cytoplasm and nucleus, poly(I:C) stimulation increased translocation to the nucleus (Fig. 7a) . The mutations, therefore, do not completely obviate TLR3 control.",

For the human mutant promoter, primers were designed containing the putative bat c-Rel binding motif: Hu-M1-F-GAATGGGTTACAGGAGGGGCTTCGGATCCTCTGGGGAGATG and Hu-M1-R-CATCTCCCCAGAGGATCCGAAGCCCCTCCTGTAACCCATTC. The primers were used to amplify wild-type human TNF\u03b1 promoter. Deletion and addition of the c-Rel binding site were confirmed by sequencing (Macrogen).",
