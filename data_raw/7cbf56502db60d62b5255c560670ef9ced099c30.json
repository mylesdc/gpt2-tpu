Although HFMD caused by EV71 infection mostly leads to mild symptoms, the disease may be complicated by serious symptoms, such as poliomyelitis-like paralysis, encephalomyelitis, myocarditis and neonatal sepsis, resulting in severe and even fatal consequences in infections of children under 5 years of age 2-5 . In the absence of efficacious therapy for severe infections and preventive vaccines, outbreaks and recurrent EV71 epidemics are major threats to public health and cause widespread panic during epidemics 1-6 . The EV71 genome is a single-stranded positive RNA that is approximately 7.4 kb in size and contains three encoding regions: P1, P2, and P3. The P1 region encodes the four structural proteins (external VP1, VP2, and VP3 and internalized VP4), whereas the P2 and P3 regions encode the other seven non-structural proteins (2A, 2B, and 2C encoded by the P2 region, and 3A, 3B, 3C, and 3D encoded by the P3 region) 1 . Phylogenetic analysis of EV71 based on the VP1 gene divided this virus into three independent lineages designated A, B and C, of which genotypes B and C still circulate worldwide 7 . Here, we focused on EV71 genotype C, which continues to circulate throughout China.",

To date, little progress has been made in virus infection therapies, such as Tamiflu, which is an influenza A virus self-protein neuraminidase-targeted drug. This limited progress has been attributed to the rapid mutation of viral genomes, which leads to virus-targeted drugs to lose effectiveness against new variants. Concomitant with the rapid progress in systematic attempts to collect host-virus physical interaction data, protein annotation with RNA interference (RNAi) data and other functional data, recently we have witnessed changes in the perspective of antiviral drug research 9 . Drugs targeting essential host factors for viruses may be broad-spectrum and mutant-insensitive. The common method to identify essential host factors for viruses is to knock down host genes and determine whether virus infection is controlled. However, this approach is not practical for every virus due to its low repeat rate and high cost. The virus-host protein-protein interactome also provides potential host targets for antiviral research. The yeast two-hybrid(Y2H) system was introduced twenty-five years ago and has been widely used to investigate protein-protein networks of model organisms and pathogens and hosts, such as bacteria, yeast, fruit flies, tumor viruses and hosts, and herpes viruses and hosts 10-12 . The huge interactome datasets obtained from genome-wide yeast two-hybrid screening have greatly facilitated the identification of crucial proteins that are considered druggable. But the wide distribution of host proteins that interact with viruses makes the selection of drugs targeting multiple host targets difficult. For enterovirus 71, neither genome-wide RNAi screening nor virus-host protein-protein interaction identification has been explored.",

We identified interactions between EV71 proteins and host cellular proteins using a yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screen to provide a network view of EV71 infection. A viral ORFeome was generated that included ORFs encoding all full-length mature proteins and several protein domains of EV71 BrCr. These bait sequences were cloned into fusion vectors with a GAL4 DNA binding domain. The bait constructs were screened against a human brain cDNA library using a highly stringent Y2H assay. Twenty-nine EV71-human protein interactions were identified. Analysis of the integrated EV71-human protein interaction network revealed the topological features of the EV71-interacting human proteins (EIPs) and the functional pathways related to EV71 infection. Through overlap analysis of EIPs and proteins with interactions or functional associations with other viruses, we found that ATP6V0C might be a broad-spectrum essential host factor and further validated its essentiality for EV71 infection in vitro. We then mapped EIPs to known drug targets; the related drug indications mainly covered EV71 infection-related symptoms, indicating the potential of EIPs to serve as host-directed antiviral targets. We used connectivity map resources to find drugs that inhibited EIPs and to help validate the value of EIPs as antiviral targets. The drug tanespimycin showed the most significant inhibition of EIP expression and significantly inhibited EV71 infection in vitro.",

The colony identities were determined by DNA sequencing. Fifty-eight of the colonies were tested with the yeast re-transformation assay. Finally, 42 positive colonies were obtained, which represented 37 unique protein-protein interactions between EV71 and 29 human proteins. We provide a network view of the protein-protein interactions in Fig. 2a . No virus-host protein interactions were identified for the internalized capsid protein VP4 and two other non-structural EV71 proteins (2A and 3B). The non-structural protein 2B and 3A interacted with more host proteins ( Fig. 2b and c) and shared as many as five human protein interactions. RTN1 was the only protein with interactions with three viral proteins. We used the DAVID online tools 13, 14 to annotate and cluster the EIPs and to identify common protein characteristics (Supplementary Table S1 ). Most of the genes encoded membrane proteins, some of which functioned in nerve signal transduction pathways. The four most enriched annotation terms were membrane proteins, endoplasmic reticulum, host-virus interaction and glycoprotein. Only two proteins (STX1A and STX4) were involved in the same KEGG pathway (vesicular transport). Moreover, eighteen of these EIPs were membrane proteins, six were host-virus interaction proteins, and eight were endoplasmic reticulum proteins, including seven proteins located at the endoplasmic reticulum membrane (Fig. 2d, Supplementary Table S1 ).",

The degree equals the number of proteins with direct interactions with a given protein, which represents local centrality. The shortest path between two proteins is the shortest route that contains the least number of proteins and the interactions between them in the network. The betweenness centrality counts the ratio of the shortest paths between two proteins in the network that passes through given proteins, representing a global centrality. The average degree, average shortest path, and average betweenness centrality of all proteins in the human PPI network were 18.39, 2.63 and 2.49 \u00d7 10 4 , respectively, whereas these values for the EIPs were 19.89, 2.70 and 1.28 \u00d7 10 4 , respectively (Fig. 3b,c and d) . The significance of the differences between the average degrees and average betweenness centralities of the EIPs and all proteins were tested using the two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test at the 1% significance level (p = 3.53 \u00d7 10 \u22123 and 5.83 \u00d7 10 \u22123 , respectively), although the average shortest path lengths were not significantly different. The higher degree indicated that the EIPs were the proteins with the most interactions, whereas the lower betweenness centrality indicated that the EIPs were not central in the global Functional analysis of the EV71-human protein network. To explore the EIP functions, we analyzed the EIP enrichment significance in different pathways. The Reactome pathway database is an open-source and peer-reviewed pathway database that provides pathway knowledge 16, 17 . We analyzed pathway enrichment for EIPs (Supplementary Table S2 ). Unexpectedly, the pathways in which the EIPs were enriched were decentralized, with no more than two proteins found in the same pathway. Using p < 0.01 as the cutoff, nine Reactome pathways were identified as significantly enriched, including neuronal system pathways, such as botulinum neurotoxicity and SNARE complex-related pathways, metabolic pathways, such as serine biosynthesis and glycerophospholipid biosynthesis, and extracellular matrix organization pathways, such as elastic fiber formation (Supplementary Table S2 ).",

The most common experimental methods for the systematic identification of virus-interacting host factors have primarily identified viral proteins that physically interact with host proteins (virus-targeted proteins, VTPs) using Y2H screens 18 or essential host factors (EHFs) using genome-wide RNAi screening 19, 20 .

The broad relationships between ATP6V0C and different viruses indicated its universally important functions during different virus infections, making it a potential broad-spectrum host target for antiviral therapies. Therefore, we validated the interaction between ATP6V0C and the EV71 3A protein and studied the function of ATP6V0C in EV71 infection. Results of the subcellular co-localization ATP6V0C and 3A in co-transfected RD cells showed that ATP6V0C and 3A co-localized primarily in the cytoplasm (Fig. 4c) . Additionally, results of co-immunoprecipitation experiments indicated that ATP6V0C interacted with the 3A protein in co-transfected RD cells (Fig. 4d) . To study the role of ATP6V0C in EV71 infection, the ATP6V0C siRNA were used to downregulate the ATP6V0C gene expression and the pCMV-myc-ATP6V0C which could express ATP6V0C protein in cells were used to overexpress ATP6V0C. Results showed that siRNA targeting ATP6V0C inhibited the EV71 propagation (Fig. 4g) ,and that overexpressing ATP6V0C in cells enhanced the EV71 propagation (Fig. 4h) .",

The high overlap rate of EIPs with other virus-interacting proteins proved the reliability of EIPs and the possibility of their use as broad-spectrum host-dependent antiviral targets. However, whether the drugs targeting them could be effective was unknown. To explore the potential use of these proteins as host targets, we queried DrugBank to identify drugs targeting them. Contrary to the many overlaps between the EIPs and VTPs or EHFs, few EIPs were known drug targets. Only 2 out of the 29 EIPs were targeted by only 2 drugs: NADH targeting PHGDH and HMOX2 and Stannsoporfin targeting HMOX2. NADH is an endogenous small molecule that participates in the citric acid cycle and cellular respiration. Too many proteins were recorded as targets of NADH, making PHGDH and HMOX2 non-specific. The endogenous character and non-specific targets made NADH an unsuitable drug candidate. Moreover, Stannsoporfin failed to inhibit EV71 infection in vitro. To obtain more drug candidates, we listed all drugs targeting EAPs in Supplementary Table S11. The drug candidates increased to 567 when the EIP neighbors were considered. These drugs had 743 interactions with 107 different targets; the interaction type and drug properties, such as the drug type, category, and Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) code, are also listed in Supplementary Table S11. An enrichment analysis of drug properties could help determine the drug characteristic tendencies and EAP functional features.

The enriched drug types were diverse and included approved, psychotropic and neurological drugs, beta-blocking agents, glucocorticoids and anti-inflammatory agents. These drugs were primarily related to inflammation control and neurological indications, which were related to EV71 infection symptoms. The drug-target interaction types were also counted and analyzed.

The connectivity map 21, 22 and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) 23 provided an applicable strategy for the evaluation of drug influences on a group of targets (i.e., signatures through expression profiles). The 6,100 pairs of expression profiles representing the cellular responses to 1,309 different drugs were arranged in 6,100 gene rank lists in connectivity map 2.0 22 . These genes were ranked by expression changes due to drug interference (i.e., the genes up-regulated by drug interference were placed on top of the rank list and the down-regulated genes were placed on the bottom). GSEA based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) statistic was used to estimate whether a group of targets (i.e., a signature) tended to appear at the top (or bottom) of the gene rank lists to determine whether the signature was universally up-(or down-) regulated by drug interference. The enrichment scores acquired by GSEA were in the range of \u2212 1 to 1, with negative scores indicating inhibition of the signatures and positive scores indicating activation of the signatures. Here, we used EIPs as the signature and attempted to find drugs that inhibited them. All 6,100 drug interference experiments were sorted by their corresponding enrichment scores to EIPs in ascending order (i.e., the top-ranked drug interference experiments tended to inhibit EIPs). Experiments using the same drug were checked to determine whether they were consistently top-ranked. The permutation p values estimated with 1,000,000 random rankings of the 6,100 experiments as a baseline were used to describe the significance of a drug's inhibition of EIPs. Using a permutation p < 0.01 as the cut off, 27 of the 1,309 drugs were identified to significantly inhibit EIP expression (Supplementary Table S14 ).",

            "text": "Some viral proteins interacted with human proteins with high local and global centralities 25, 26 . The high local or global centralities of human proteins indicated that these proteins tended to interact with more proteins or have larger influences on signal transfer throughout the human protein interaction network, respectively. The literature analysis indicated that the tendency for viral proteins to interact with central proteins might be a general hallmark of viral proteins 26 . The low global centralities indicated relatively weak influences of EIPs on the whole human protein interaction network, which might result from the limitations of the tissue-specific protein library used in this study. The functional analysis of EIPs and their neighboring proteins revealed that their major functions were most likely perturbed by viral proteins during infection. These functions included the cell cycle, apoptosis, multiple signaling transfer pathways, immune system and neuronal system pathways. Some of these pathways, such as the cell cycle and apoptosis-related pathways, were closely related to virus proliferation and transmission, and some of these pathways, such as botulinum neurotoxicity, inflammasomes and other immune system pathways, might play important roles in acute infection symptoms. These results provide insights for further investigations into host-virus interactions and suggest that the proteins that directly interacted with viruses could be essential for virus replication or disease progression and thus serve as potential antiviral targets. Before investigating the potential of EIPs for drug repositioning, we explored the associations between EIPs and other viruses. The results suggested that more than half of the EIPs had known interactions with other viruses, indicating their potential to serve as broad-spectrum targets. The most outstanding EIP (i.e., ATP6V0C) was also an EHF for five different viruses. The in vitro validation of the influence of EV71 infection in this report demonstrated its essentiality. ATP6V0C is subunit c of the vATPase. Reports have shown that ATP6V0C or vAT-Pase is essential for the entry of many viruses, including influenza virus 27 , human cytomegalovirus 28 , West Nile virus 29 , polio virus 30 , and Sindbis virus 31 . According to the role of vATPases in other virus infection and our results, we speculated that the possible mechanism by which ATP6V0C facilitated EV71 infection might be via its effect on the entry of EV71 into cells. The association of EIPs with drugs could help elucidate the host-oriented antiviral potential of known drugs. The approved drugs were significantly outnumbered in the enrichment analysis of target-driven drug candidates, suggesting safe and convenient drug repositioning, although the significance may result from knowledge bias. The psychotropic and neurological drugs were enriched due to the outnumbered drug targetable neural proteins in the EAPs. Other drug properties, such as beta-blocking agents, glucocorticoids and anti-inflammatory agents, indicated possible adjuvant drugs for EV71 infection. Despite massed indirect target-driven drug candidates, few safe drugs directly target EIPs. Because drugs affect few to a large number of targets, specificities of target-driven drug candidates were different. Drugs with many targets are more likely to be elected as candidates. The EIPs PHGDH and HMOX2 are targets of NADH. While considering the fact that NADH affects hundreds of targets and dozens of pathways, it is probably a false positive prediction. We attempted to use a connectivity map, which is another powerful strategy for drug repositioning 21, 22 , to predict drug candidates with the principle that drug candidate should tend to inhibit EIP gene expression. The in vitro validation of tanespimycin's inhibition of the CPE of EV71 supported this strategy. While the other five high-ranking drugs failed to reduce EV71-induced CPE. As the fuctional importance of each EIP is different, the mere assessment of the overall expression levels of EIPs is practical but loose. A better approach is to identify the functional roles of each EIP, and to find drugs that exactly modulate key EIPs, making it more likely to find effective drugs.",

Moreover, due to the mutation rate of human genes is far lower than the viral gene, the host-targeting strategy can also better solve the problem of drug resistance 32 . In addition, the same host protein may be pivotal for a variety of viruses, therefore, host-targeted drugs may have broad-spectrum antiviral activity 33 . Despite the benefits of host-targeted antiviral strategies, current therapeutic drugs against viral diseases mainly targets the viral components, especially viral enzymes 34 . As viral proteins interact with host factors to promote viral replication and disease process, systematically experimental identification of virus-interacting host factors and bioinformatics methods were used for building virus-host interactomes and predicting therapeutic targets 29, [35] [36] [37] . Although these approaches are still in infancy, more and more antiviral molecules with reduced safety risk and low resistance induction are predicted and validated 34, 38, 39 . In this study, public databases were used to functionally annotate EIPs and find EIPs with therapeutic values, and two drug repositioning strategies were used to predict antiviral drugs. Though imperfect, this study provides a pipeline from virus-host interaction network to therapeutic applications. With the accumulation and sharing of virus-host interactome data and progress of systems biology, more host-targeted antiviral drugs will arise.",

The EIPs were submitted to the DAVID tool and human proteins were used as the baseline for the functional EIP clustering. The default settings were used for all parameters and annotation categories. The annotation clustering results were manually checked to determine the most outstanding characteristics of the EIPs. The EIPs were graphically presented as a Venn diagram according to their main characteristics.",

The gene rank lists represent gene expression changes in drug stimulation experiments (i.e., the genes at the top (bottom) of the ranked list are the most up-(or down-) regulated genes during the corresponding drug stimulation. The enrichment score for the EIPs in each gene rank list was computed with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic 42 . Supposing the total length of the gene list is n and the EIPs corresponded genes are ranked R(i) where i = 1, 2, 3, \u2026 , k. Then, compute the following values: scores of the EIPs were set to a if a > b or to \u2212 b if b > a. Positive scores indicated EIP activation, whereas negative scores indicated EIP inhibition. The average enrichment score for the same drug was generated from the enrichment scores of each experiment. To evaluate the significance of a drug's inhibition of EIPs, the experiments were ranked in ascending order. Supposing there are n experiments and k out of these experiments are experiments for the same drug. These experiments are ranked R(i), where i = 1, 2, 3, \u2026 , k. Then, compute the following values: KS = a when a > b or KS = b when a < b.
