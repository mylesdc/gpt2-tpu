We systematically analyzed all nine CHIKV proteins for RNAi suppressor activity using Sf21 RNAi sensor cell line based assay. Two non-structural proteins, namely, nsP2 and nsP3 were found to exhibit RNAi suppressor activity. We further validated the findings in natural hosts, namely in Aedes and in mammalian cell lines and further through EMSA and Agrobacterium infiltration in GFP silenced transgenic tobacco plants. Domains responsible for maximum RNAi suppressor activity were also identified within these proteins. RNA binding motifs in these domains were identified and their participation in RNAi suppression evaluated using site directed mutagenesis. Sequence alignment of these motifs across all species of known alphaviruses revealed conservation of these motifs emphasizing on a similar role of action in other species of alphaviruses as well. Further validation of RNAi suppressor activity of these proteins awaits establishment of specific virus infection models.",

The phenomenon, triggered by the production of double stranded RNA (dsRNA) by the pathogen upon infection, leads to the activation of the RNA interference silencing complex (RISC) by loading of dsRNA/siRNA into the complex ultimately leading to cleavage of the viral RNA 5,6,7 . Several components of RISC participate in the cleavage, most important being ribonuclease III Dicer (DCR) and Argonaute protein (AGO). Dicer acts on dsRNA to generate small RNA (sRNA) that are loaded into the AGO, resulting in cleavage 8,9 ; however, some RNAi pathways are independent of Dicer and other components like RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) produce short RNA transcripts that directly bind to AGO 10 . Similarly, much is now known about the Piwi pathway that is specifically active in the germline 11 .",

While invertebrate hosts like mosquitoes and ticks behave as maintenance hosts where the viruses persists in low levels 19, 20 , vertebrate hosts get infected to high titers with efficient virus replication 21 and this alteration between hosts has been shown to play an important role in evolution of arboviruses 22 . Until recently, it had been speculated that these arbovirus do not possess RNAi suppressor activity 23 unlike other insect-specific viruses like FHV and CrPV 24, 25 . However, recent studies have established that flaviviruses encode for VSRs 26, 27 . Alphaviruses are member of arboviruses containing 27 recognised members 28 with a very wide geographic distribution and several geographical variants on the basis of which they have been classified as Old World and New World viruses 29 . Grouped into seven complexes based on serological cross-reactivity, they infect a variety of host including birds, fishes, mammals including humans and are maintained in natural cycles by transmission between susceptible vectors and vertebrate hosts 30 . Alphaviruses have a single plus-stranded RNA genome encapsulated by capsid proteins. The approx. 12 kb genome consists of two open reading frames that encodes four non-structural proteins (nsP1 to nsP4), three structural proteins (capsid, envelope glycoproteins E1 and E2) and two small cleavage products (E3 and 6K). While the structural proteins are involved in mediating entry and fusion of the virus into the hosts, the non-structural proteins (nsPs) form the replication complex 31 . The non-structural proteins that are initially translated as one or two polyprotein from the full-length genomic viral RNA are processed exclusively by the virus-encoded protease, nsP2. Upon cleavage, each of the mature proteins as well as the intermediates actively participates in virus replication. As of date, some properties of these nsPs are known 32 : nsP1 is membrane-associated and possess both guanine-7-methytransferase and guanyltransferase activity, nsP2 exhibit several enzymatic activities including helicase, protease activity, nsP3 possess phosphatase and RNA-binding activity 33, 34 and nsP4 is a RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) 35 . Even though much information is available from the above and other studies, it is expected that these proteins have more novel roles in viral replication.",

In case of alphaviruses, reports have suggested that RNAi suppressors in this class of viruses may either be weak or undetected due to inappropriate assay conditions 4, 37 . We undertook the present study to systematically evaluate CHIKV proteins (Fig. 1a) for possible RNAi suppressor activity using a Sf21 RNAi sensor cell line developed in our lab 16 . Using this RNAi sensor cell line, in which GFPshRNA is expressed constitutively to silence GFP in a GFP Sf21 cell line; we checked for reversion of GFP due to RNAi suppressor activity of the cloned CHIKV genes in pIB vector using flow cytometry ( Fig. 1b and c) . Post 72 h transfection, it was observed that nsP2, nsP3 and nsP4 showed a reversion in GFP expression of 60%, 55% and 40% respectively (p values < 0.0001).

Having checked suppressor activity of all CHIKV genes using an established cell line based assay, we next checked for their suppressor activity in its natural hosts, namely a mosquito and mammalian system. For this purpose, we utilised an Aedes cell line, Aag2 and the mammalian cell line, HEK293T. Using transient transfection protocols in which GFPshRNA in pIZT/V5-His and pGFP VRS plasmid were co-transfected with nsP2/nsP3 pIB/ pCDNA3.1+ plasmids in Aag2 and HEK293T respectively (Fig. 2a) , we evaluated suppressor activity of all nine genes. Overall, it was seen that transfection worked better in HEK as compared to Aag2 owing to better transfection efficiency in the mammalian system. With respect to GFP reversions, it was observed that nsP2 and nsP3 showed significant reversion (p value < 0.001) in both Aedes and HEK cell lines ( Fig. 2b and c) . In case of nsP4, however, RNAi suppressor activity was not evident in both the natural hosts and only around 25% GFP reversions were seen in the cells upon transfections with nsP4. Based on these results, we identified CHIKV_nsP2 and CHIKV_nsP3 to possess RNAi suppressor activity and further proceeded to validate these findings. nsP2 and nsP3 are suppressors of RNAi. Having established that nsP2 and nsP3 show RNAi suppressor activity, we proceeded to detect the level of GFP protein due to effect of the putative VSRs. Western analysis also revealed increase in GFP expression in nsP2 and nsP3 transfected cells as compared to Sf21 RNAi sensor cells (Fig. 3a) . In addition to the above mentioned in vitro assays, we utilised transgenic Nicotiana leaf based assay to validate RNAi suppressor activity of nsP2 and nsP3 under in vivo conditions 38 . The putative VSRs were cloned into the plant binary vector pBI 121 and reversal of silencing by agro-infiltration-mediated transient ectopic expression of CHIKV nsP2 and CHIKV nsP3 was assessed in transgenic tobacco leaf tissues in which GFP is silenced. The infiltrated leaves showed reversal of GFP activity at 3 days post-infiltration in nsP2 and 5 days post-infiltration in nsP3 as seen under UV light ( Fig. 3b and c) . In the infiltration experiments, FHVB2 plasmid was used as positive control and a mutated FHVB2 expressing plasmid as negative control. GFP reversal was further confirmed by analysing GFP transcript levels and the depletion of small RNA population of GFP in the leaves using Northern hybridisation. 18 s RNA and 28 s rRNA were used as loading controls for mRNA and small RNA Northerns respectively. (Fig. 3d) . While there was an increase in the GFP mRNA levels in leaves infiltrated with nsP2 and nsP3, GFP small RNAs showed 50% and 80% decrease in their population in the leaves infiltrated by nsP2 and nsP3 respectively thereby providing evidence that CHIKV nsP2 and nsP3 are influencing small RNA production post-transcription.",

The most well known mechanism is the ability of VSRs to bind to dsRNA/siRNA population thereby preventing RISC from acting upon them. This phenomenon has been evaluated by studying the binding of suppressor protein to double stranded RNA population resulting in a shift in their mobility efficiency 7, 16 . For this purpose, we expressed both nsP2 and nsP3 in the heterologous E.coli system. While we were able to produce nsP3 in its natural folded form, nsP2 aggregated into inclusion bodies and could not be purified, most probably owing to its large size. To overcome this problem, we expressed both CHIKV_nsP2 and CHIKV_nsP3 in Sf21 cell line by transient transfection (Supplementary Fig. S2 ). Using cell lysate of the transfected cell expressing nsP2 and nsP3, we evaluated their ability to bind double stranded RNA by using [\u03b3 32P] labeled shRNA of GFP and running the bound complex in a 6% polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 3e) . Binding of shRNA to nsP2 and nsP3 proteins were evident by complex formation and shift that increased proportionally to protein concentration (Fig. 3e -lane no. 2, 3, 4, 5) . Addition of cold shRNA probe served as competitive inhibitor of binding reaction and the decrease in the intensity of the shift proved the binding specificity of the complex. Untransfected Sf21 lysate in the presence of non-specific inhibitor (salmon sperm DNA) of varying concentrations and GFPshRNA served as negative The y-axis shows % GFP reversion (Mean \u00b1 SD). Statistical significance was analysed using student's t-test and Fisher's Least Significant Difference (LSD) test using empty vector as control. The *symbol indicates a statistically significant difference in terms of the P value (P < 0.001). nsP2, nsP3 and nsP4 were found statistically highly significant from LSD test (P value < 0.0001 each) when compared with the vector (negative control) (Alpha level of the test = 0.05). 8, 9, 10) . These results clearly proved nsP2 and nsP3 bound to dsRNA. Taken all these findings together, we conclude that CHIKV nsP2 and CHIKV nsP3 are suppressors of RNAi.",

Alternately, VSRs may also impede loading of siRNAs into the RISC and consequently block functionalization of siRNA loaded RISC 37 .A direct way to assess effect of VSRs on siRNA formation is to estimate dicing enzyme activity in vitro in the presence of the VSRs. Unfortunately, our attempts to purify CHIKV nsP2 in its active form were unsuccessful, hence we resorted to cell based FACS assays to gain preliminary insight into possible suppression mechanism. Using SF21 GFP cell line, we transfected dsRNA or siRNA-GFP and subsequently co-transfected with the VSRs to estimate the level of GFP reversal. We reasoned that GFP reversal was an indication of where the VSRs may act -if they acted during dicing, then the reversal would be evident upon co-transfection with dsRNA+ VSRs and if they acted at the time of siRNA loading into RISC, it would be evident while using siRNA+ VSRs. Our results showed there was > 50% GFP reversion with both dsRNA and siRNA for both nsP2 and nsP3 ( Fig. 4a and b) , thus highlighting that their mode of action may be downstream of RISC loading in the RNAi pathway.",

The non-structural proteins, nsP2 and nsP3 of CHIKV participate in several functions; nsP2 has been shown to have multiple functions including helicase, protease and NTPase activities [39] [40] [41] [42] . This protein is 90 kDa and consists of four domains, the 180 aa long N-terminal domain, 240 aa long domain that exhibits helicase activity, 200 aa long protease domain and a 160 aa long C terminal domain 43 (Fig. 5a) . Similarly, nsP3 exhibits phosphatase activity and also consists of a macrodomain that has been well characterised 32 . This is 57 kDa and consists of three domains (Fig. 5c) . The macrodomain, present on the N-terminus, is a globular domain 162 aa long and is evolutionary highly conserved. Most of the activities exhibited by the protein are associated with this domain. The sequence of central part of nsP3 (162 aa) is conserved only among alphaviruses and hence is termed alphavirus unique domain (AUD). The C-terminal domain (204 aa) is termed hypervariable region, since it has no sequence similarity even among alphaviruses.

To understand the sequence structure of the domains that showed maximum suppressor activity in nsP2 and nsP3, we identified the RNA binding motifs within the domains showing maximum reversions in both the VSRs (Fig. 6a and c) .

To date, complete sequence information is available for 15 alphavirus species. As expected, all RNA binding motifs were conserved in both nsP2 and nsP3 proteins across all species (Fig. 6b and d) . Additionally, we observed the presence of one GW motif in domain 2 of nsP2 in all species. Taking all these aspects, we hypothesize the RNAi suppressor activity of CHIKV nsP2 and nsP3 may be conserved across all alphaviruses.",

Having identified the conserved RNA binding motifs in nsP2 and nsP3, we proceeded to evaluate the impact these motifs have in RNAi suppressor activity in the VSRs. Substituting all or most of the amino acids in motifs with alanine through site directed mutagenesis, we generated mutants. Three mutants were generated in nsP2 with different permutations and combinations of substitutions, while two mutants were generated in nsP3. Schematic representation of mutant generation is depicted in Fig. 7a and b. GFP reversal in these mutants were evaluated using Sf21 RNAi sensor line and the results are shown in Fig. 7c . Further, we performed mobility shift assays to evaluate the binding capacities of the domains and the mutants generated using [\u03b3 32 P] labeled shRNA of GFP and running the bound complex in a 6% polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 7d) . Complex formation due to dose dependent binding of shRNA to the mutants of nsP3 and nsP2 are evident (lane 3, 4, 14 and 15 respectively). In the same manner, binding efficiencies of the domains to shRNA are demonstrated in lane 6, 7, 11 and 12 respectively. The results clearly show the involvement of the RNA binding motifs in the binding to dsRNA and we conclude that these motifs play a direct role in RNAi suppressor activity. nsP1-Sf21 lysate in the presence of non-specific inhibitor (salmon sperm DNA) and GFPshRNA served as negative controls (lane 1, 9, 10).

Mosquito innate immune system poses a serious challenge to virus infection and activates different defence pathways including TOLL pathway, IMD (Immune deficiency) pathway, JAK STAT pathway and RNAi pathway 45 . RNAi pathway is a major antiviral defence mechanism employed by insects that results in degradation of viral RNA thereby curbing infection [1] [2] [3] [4] .

In our study, nsP2 has shown stronger VSR activity in comparison to nsP3. Earlier reports have shown this protein exhibits anti-IFN activity 52 , emphasising on the overlapping nature of interferon and RNAi pathway. Domain mapping of this protein revealed the domain that possessed helicase activity showed maximum activity for RNAi suppression. Interestingly, helicases such as HeIf of Dictyostelium, B2 of Wuhan nodavirus and NS3 of dengue virus has been proven to exhibit VSR activity 15, 48, 53 . Of interest is the presence of a GW motif, conserved across all alphavirus species studied, that is known to be important for binding to dsRNA/siRNA and Argonaute loading 44 . The crystal structure of CHIKV nsP3 macrodomain reveals that this domain possesses RNA-binding activity 33 . This protein is also known to modulate pathogenicity in mice 54 . Our study has provided evidence of an additional role of the macrodomain and clearly elucidates it role in pathogenicity as a viral suppressor of RNAi.

FACS analysis was done after 72 h for GFP expression in transfected cells. Sf21 cell line with and without GFP were used as FACS gating control. GFP specific dsRNA and siRNA mediated reversion assay was carried out similarly in Sf21 GFP stable cell line in 24 well plate. Briefly, 2 \u03bc g VSR plasmid was co-transfected with 1.5 \u03bc g GFP dsRNA plasmid and 2.5 pmole siRNA in separate wells. Scrambled siRNA was used as GFP silencing negative control. FACS analysis was done similarly after 72 h. RNAi Suppression Assay in natural host cell lines. Aag2 (Aedes aegypti) cells were transfected using Attractene reagent (Qiagen). Briefly, 0.2 million Aag2 cells were co-transfected with GFPshRNA plasmid and CHIKV-pIB/V5-His TOPO plasmid. GFP levels were analyzed with FACS after 72 h. GFP reversion assay in human host was done using HEK293T cells. Each CHIKV-pCDNA3.1+ plasmid was co-transfected with GFPshRNA plasmid using Jet PRIME reagent (Polyplus Transfection) in jet PRIME buffer, followed by FACS analysis after 72 h.",
