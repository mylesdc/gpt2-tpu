Dengue vaccine development is challenging because of the need to induce simultaneous protection against four antigenically distinct DENV serotypes and evidence that, under some conditions, vaccination can enhance disease due to specific immunity to the virus. While several live-attenuated tetravalent dengue virus vaccines display partial efficacy, it has been challenging to induce balanced protective immunity to all 4 serotypes. Instead of using whole-virus formulations, we are exploring the potentials for a particulate subunit vaccine, based on DENV E-protein displayed on nanoparticles that have been precisely molded using Particle Replication in Non-wetting Template (PRINT) technology.",

We show that PRINT nanoparticle adsorbed sRecE without any adjuvant induces higher IgG titers and a more potent DENV2-specific neutralizing antibody response compared to the soluble sRecE protein alone. Antigen trafficking indicate that PRINT nanoparticle display of sRecE prolongs the bio-availability of the antigen in the draining lymph nodes by creating an antigen depot.

DENV has 4 distinct serotypes and secondary DENV infections are associated with hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. This enhancement of infection complicates vaccine development and makes it necessary to induce protective immunity against all 4 serotypes. Since whole virus vaccine candidates struggle to induce protective immunity, we are developing a nanoparticle display vaccine approach. We have expressed, purified and characterized a soluble recombinant E-protein (sRecE). Regardless of nanoparticle shape or size, particulation of sRecE enhances DENV specific IgG titers and induces a robust, long lasting neutralizing antibody response and by adsorbing sRecE to the nanoparticles, we prolong the exposure of sRecE to the immune system.

Approximately half of the world's population is at risk of being infected, resulting in up to 390 million reported cases of infection yearly. Roughly 1 million infections develop into severe disease of which nearly 2-5% is fatal [1, 2] . More than 125 countries are endemic to DENV, but geographical expansion is expected to increase due to climate change, globalization of travel and trade and viral evolution [3] [4] [5] [6] . Additionally, dengue is a complex disease resulting in a wide variety of clinical symptoms. The majority of infections are very mild or clinically in apparent. Infections are often misdiagnosed due to similarities between other prevalent tropical diseases. When symptoms are present, most patients undergo a sudden onset of fever that remains for 2-7 days, accompanied by arthralgia, myalgia and skin rash [7] .",

            "text": "The dengue virus complex consists of 4 distinct serotypes designated DENV1-4. Primary infections induce long-term protective immunity to the serotype of infection only. Individuals are susceptible to secondary infections with a new serotype. Secondary heterotypic infections are associated with the more severe and potentially fatal dengue hemorrhagic fever or dengue shock syndrome [8] . As protective immunity to just one serotype may increase risk of disease upon exposure to other serotypes, leading dengue vaccines are based on tetravalent formulations to induce simultaneous immunity to all 4 serotypes. Several vaccine platforms are currently in preclinical or clinical development. These include live attenuated virus vaccines, live chimeric vaccines, inactivated virus formulations, recombinant virus vaccines, DNA and subunit vaccines [9] . Live virus formulations have progressed into clinical trials. The leading candidate, which has been tested in two large efficacy studies, demonstrated partial efficacy that varies between serotypes and based on the prior dengue exposure history of individuals [10] . Moreover, in some populations, the vaccine appeared to transiently increase risk of disease when people were exposed to a natural infection [10] . Recent advances in molecular biology have shown the safety and potential of rationally designed vaccine candidates, moving away from the whole virus paradigm and directing vaccinology towards subunit vaccine formulations. Subunit approaches for dengue generally involve the exploitation of E-protein as the major immunogen [11] [12] [13] [14] . Even though several protein-based subunit vaccine approaches appear immunogenic and effective in small animals models, they have generally not been as immunogenic in primates [15] .",

In general, subunit antigens as vaccine candidates are poorly effective as vaccine candidates due to size, degradation, non-specific targeting, the lack of cross-presentation and poor uptake by APCs. Coating soluble antigens to carriers is an effective strategy to increase the immunogenicity of weak immunogens. In the past decades, controlled release of prophylactic antigens has been achieved using nanoparticle vehicles or carriers composed of biodegradable polymers. One of the most promising aspects of coating subunit peptides to nanoparticle carriers is the potential to mimic structural and immunogenic features of the target pathogen. In addition to the generation of an antigen depot, the enhanced adjuvanticity of nanoparticles also contributes to enhanced vaccine efficacy by particulate antigen presentation and efficient targeting of APCs [16] [17] [18] [19] .",

            "text": "The pharmacokinetic characteristics of nanoparticles depend on the intrinsic properties of the particle itself. Particle size could have implications on APC uptake, biodistribution and bioavailability. Smaller particles are phagocytosed slower than larger particles, which contributes to better distribution by rapid dissolution [20] . Therefore, the optimization of nanoparticle composition, size and shape depends on disease target and application characteristics. One of the most commonly used polymeric nanoparticles are poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) particles, a biodegradable polymer that can be tailored to vary degradability and release. A wide range of PLGA-based drug delivery systems have been used for the treatment and diagnosis of many diseases and disorders [21] [22] [23] . Many different fabrication processes have been utilized to produce PLGA based nanocarriers, out of which the PRINT (Particle Replication In Non-wetting Templates) process stands out in its capacity to control particle parameters [21, [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] . The PRINT process creates monodispersed particles of uniform shape and size, is a scalable process and can be used to encapsulate or to be decorated with both hydrophilic and hydrophobic biological cargo [29] [30] [31] [32] .",

Next, the PETsheet was incubated in water supplemented with 0.1 wt% polyvinyl alcohol (PVOH) to harvest particles. The particle suspension was sterilized using a 0.2 \u03bcm polyether sulfone membrane (Millipore) and purified by tangential flow filtration with a 0.05 \u03bcm polysulfone hollow fiber membrane (Spectrum Laboratories). The size and z-potential measurements were conducted on PLGA particle dispersions in 1 mM KCl solution using Zetasizer Nano ZS particle analyzer (Malvern Instruments) (S1 Table) .

Secreted RecE (sRecE) was produced in EXPI293 cells and purified from the supernatant using His-affinity chromatography. Analysis of the final product by Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB) staining and Western blot (WB) detection with mouse Mab 4G2 showed high yields of purified recombinant protein (Fig 1B) . sRecE had a slightly lower molecular weight (expected size of~45kDa) then the full length wildtype E-protein control containing the membrane proximal and integral regions of the protein. To analyze sRecE structure and epitope accessibility, the His tagged protein was loaded on Ni 2+ -coated ELISA plates and detected using a panel of well-characterized DENV Mabs (Mouse derived: 4G2, 3H5, DV2-46, human derived: DVC3.7, 1M7, DVC-10.16, 2D22 and 8A1). All tested DENV2 reactive Mabs (Table 1) were able to bind sRecE ( Fig 1C) . The DENV-complex reactive envelope domain II (EDII) fusion loop binding Mabs (4G2 and DV2-46) and the envelope domain III (EDIII) binding Mabs 3H5, DVC3.7 and DVC10.16 all bound to sRecE. The highly neutralizing, DV2 specific human Mab 2D22, which binds to E protein dimer dependent quaternary epitope showed weak binding indicating that a small fraction of the protein may be present as E-protein homo-dimers. The DENV3 type-specific Mab 8A1 was used as a negative control. These results demonstrate that DENV2 sRecE is pure and displays conformational epitopes present on the monomer.",

The TEM images showed a monodispersed particle distribution for each particle size. To adsorb sRecE to the PLGA nanoparticles, variable sRecE/PLGA (w/w%) ratios were mixed together for 15 minutes at RT, keeping the amount of sRecE constant and decreasing particle amount to obtain higher sRecE/PLGA ratios. The adsorption efficiency was determined by the amount of non-adsorbed sRecE after the spinning down the particles (Fig 2B) . Up to a 4% w/w ratio resulted in nearly 100% adsorption efficiency for each particle size. The decrease in adsorption efficiency with increasing %w/w ratios (8% and 12%) was most likely caused by the excess of sRecE over the available particle surface.",

We did observe a trend of the 55 x 70 nm particles inducing higher levels of binding antibodies and the 80 x 320 nm particles inducing higher levels of neutralizing antibody although further studies are need to more precisely determine effects of particle properties on DENV immunogenicity. In people exposed to primary DENV infections or monovalent vaccines, serotype-specific neutralizing antibodies have been implicated in durable protective immunity [8] . Therefore, we characterized specificity of the neutralizing antibody response to our monovalent (DENV2) vaccine antigen. Regardless of particle shape and size, PLGA-RecE induced neutralizing antibodies that were mainly DENV2 specific, indicating that the neutralizing response was targeted to unique epitopes on DENV2. Next we will directly test the efficacy of the PGA vaccine in mouse models of DENV infection and disease In these follow-up challenge studies, we will look more closely into the properties of the neutralizing antibodies, such as epitope specificity, antibody affinity and IgG isotype. We will also analyze the breadth of the response by testing if different genotypes of DENV2 are neutralized by the vaccine.

In vitro, both sRecE and PLGA adsorbed RecE were readily taken up by BMDCs (S2 Fig), indicating that uptake into these antigen presenting cells was unlikely to be responsible for the enhanced immunogenicity of the PLGA vaccine. PLGA adsorbed sRecE was detected at the site of vaccination and in the draining lymph nodes for much longer than sRecE alone indicating that extended bio-availability was most likely responsible for the enhanced antibody responses in PLGA vaccinated animals. We propose that PLGA vaccination leads to the formation of an antigen depot at the inoculation site and gradual release of antigen, whereas the soluble antigen alone is efficiently cleared after vaccination.",

Using this strategy we were able to induce long lasting serotype specific neutralizing antibody responses by increasing the bio-availability of the antigen. We clearly show the added effect of particulation on raised immune responses and antigen trafficking. Though only focusing on DENV2, these findings form the basis of further studies towards the other serotypes and might form the basis of a safe and efficacious dengue virus candidate. In addition, this platform can be used to develop safe vaccine candidates for other flaviviruses such as Zika virus, where pregnant women are the target group for vaccination.
