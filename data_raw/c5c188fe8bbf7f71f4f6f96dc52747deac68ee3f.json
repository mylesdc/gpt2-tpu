There is urgent need to discover biomarkers predicting the progression of disease and fatal outcome of potentially lethal flu infections, based on sound statistical analysis. We discovered that 34 of the 48 cytokines and chemokines examined in this study were significantly elevated in the plasma samples from patients infected with H7N9. We report for the first time that the levels of MIF, SCF, MCP-1, HGF, and SCGF-\u03b2 are highly positively linked to disease severity and the profile of mediators MIF, SCF, MCP-1, HGF, SCGF-\u03b2 , IP-10, IL-18, and IFN-\u03b3 is an independent outcome predictor.",

Hundreds of people infected with influenza A(H7N9) virus have been reported this year. The clinical characteristics of these patients often included fever and cough, pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) 2, 6, 7 . Hypercytokinemia has been reported in the peripheral bloods of both H7N9-infected patients and H5N1-infected patients [7] [8] [9] [10] . Our previous studies have reported that Angiotensin II level was markedly elevated in the plasma from patients infected with H5N1 and H7N9 viruses 11, 12 . Moreover, the elevated level of Angiotensin II can be a biomarker for the outcome of H7N9 infected patients 11 . Furthermore, we would like to investigate whether elevated cytokines and chemokines in the plasmas of avian influenza infected patients can be better or alternative biomarkers for H7N9 infected patients. Although IFITM3 dysfunctions and elevated IL-6, IL-8, and MIP-1\u03b2 levels have been reported in avian influenza infected patients, these molecules have been reported in limited number of cases available from the same hospital and have not been studied with comprehensive statistical analyses 9, 13, 14 .",

Notably, the elevation of chemokine IP-10, a critical player in the induction of lung injury [15] [16] [17] , was the most robust among all of the cytokines and chemokines measured (Fig. 1) .

MIF, MCP-1, and IP-10 are chemokines that can induce directed chemotaxis and regulate functions of monocyte/macrophage, T cells, natural killer cells, and dendritic cells 23 ; IL-18 is also called IFN-\u03b3 inducing factor, and the important function of IFN-\u03b3 is known to inhibit viral replication directly 22 ; SCF and SCGF-\u03b2 play important roles in the survival and self-renewal of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) 24 , and HGF can stimulate the regeneration of epithelial cells and endothelial cells in addition to acting on hematopoietic progenitor cells 21 . These . The plasma samples were collected during the first week of disease onset from patients who left the hospital within 28 days (n = 16) and from patients who died (n = 8) and whose plasma samples were harvested in the second week of disease onset. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01. mechanisms may provide a hypothesis for the molecular bases that are responsible for fatal outcomes of lethal virus induced ARDS. The biomarkers require an independent cohort for confirmation. SCF is already used in major hospitals in China as a diagnostic biomarker to monitor disease progress of non-small-cell lung cancer 26 . Because of the current dramatic increase in new cases of H7N9-infected patients in China, it may be pragmatic to examine the SCF levels in the plasma of patients infected with H7N9 to monitor the severity of disease and to predict the fatal outcomes. The high elevation of IP-10 has been reported in the plasma of patients with SARS-CoV, avian influenza H5N1, and swine-origin influenza virus infections [15] [16] [17] . We compared some other cytokines and chemokines mediators in the plasma of patients with avian influenza H7N9, H5N1, and swine-origin influenza virus infections as well as SARS-CoV infections reported previously. The elevation levels of these mediators in H7N9 patients are generally near to that of H5N1 patients and more significant than that of SARS-CoV and swine flu patients. Nevertheless, the comparison may be disturbed by the sensitivity of different assay kits(Supplemental Table 4 ) 10, 15, 16, 27, 28 . Furthermore, the lack report of MIF, SCF, HGF, MCP-1, and SCGF-\u03b2 elevations in lethal virus infections may be due to the lack of laboratory examinations. Further studies are necessary to demonstrate whether the findings in this study could extend to more lethal virus infections.",
