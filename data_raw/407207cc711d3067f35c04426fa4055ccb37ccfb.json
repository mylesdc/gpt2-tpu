            "text": "Dengue is a major public health concern and an economic burden in the Philippines. Despite the country's improved dengue surveillance, it still suffers from various setbacks and needs to be complemented with alternative approaches. Previous studies have demonstrated the potential of Internet-based surveillance such as Google Dengue Trends (GDT) in supplementing current epidemiological methods for predicting future dengue outbreaks and patterns. With this, our study has two objectives: (1) assess the temporal relationship of weekly GDT and dengue incidence in Metropolitan Manila from 2009-2014; and (2) examine the health-seeking behavior based on dengue-related search queries of the population. The study collated the population statistics and reported dengue cases in Metropolitan Manila from respective government agencies to calculate the dengue incidence (DI) on a weekly basis for the entire region and annually per city. Data processing of GDT and dengue incidence was performed by conducting an 'adjustment' and scaling procedures, respectively, and further analyzed for correlation and cross-correlation analyses using Pearson's correlation. The relative search volume of the term 'dengue' and top dengue-related search queries in Metropolitan Manila were obtained and organized from the Google Trends platform. Afterwards, a thematic analysis was employed, and word clouds were generated to examine the health behavior of the population. Results showed that weekly temporal GDT pattern are closely similar to the weekly DI pattern in Metropolitan Manila. Further analysis showed that GDT has a moderate and positive association with DI when adjusted or scaled, respectively. Cross-correlation analysis revealed a delayed effect where GDT leads DI by 1-2 weeks. Thematic analysis of dengue-related search queries indicated 5 categories namely; (a) dengue, (b) sign and symptoms of dengue, (c) treatment and prevention, (d) mosquito, and (e) other diseases. The majority of the search queries were classified in 'signs and symptoms' which indicate the health-seeking behavior of the population towards the disease. Therefore, GDT can be utilized to complement traditional disease surveillance methods combined with other factors that could potentially identify dengue hotspots and help in public health decisions.",

For the past decade, this traditional, health facility-based, and government-implemented surveillance system has undergone improvements, yet it still suffers from untimely reporting, aggregation, and publication of data. Due to these surveillance problems, the identification and efficiency of intervention that may prevent dengue epidemics could be limited. Many suggestions involving alternative approaches outside the virological and clinical domains (e.g., telephone triage calls, sales of over-the-counter drugs, and school/work absenteeism) have been proposed in parallel with traditional surveillance [12] [13] [14] . Among these non-traditional suggestions, online activity or Internet search tracking has shown the potential to complement current epidemiological methods because of its efficiency and the availability of real-time population trends [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] .",

While such an endeavor may be deemed common due to the numerous studies with the same objective, we considered our approach in fulfilling this objective to be both methodological as well as investigative. Here we underscore the importance of data processing towards a 'weekly' temporal pattern, such as adjusting GDT (AdjGDT) or scaling dengue incidence (ScDI). Furthermore, we compare the temporal pattern and its association from varying processed or transformed data of GDT and dengue incidence. On the other hand, the second objective of the study explores the health-seeking behavior of users based on their dengue-related search queries. Currently, such studies do not incorporate such findings as there have been few studies that evaluated related-search queries of dengue. Therefore, investigating this matter may provide a better understanding of the population's health-seeking behaviors regarding the disease [32] .",

Search query data from Google Trends can be mined from their website (https://trends.google. com/trends) using the term 'dengue'. For the purposes of this study, we abbreviate the Google Dengue Trends in the Philippines as \"GDT\". This platform shows the relative search volume (RSV) which is the query share of a term (e.g., dengue) for a given time period and location. The value ranges from 0-100 are normalized from the highest query share of the term over the time series. This value also represents the 'search interest' index, where a term value of 100 is denoted as the peak popularity while a value of 50 represents exactly half of the popularity. On the other hand, a term with a value of zero means insufficient data. Additional data displayed are the cities during the queried time period in Metropolitan Manila that search for the term 'dengue'. GDT also displays words and phrases referred to as 'related queries' of dengue. These queries are divided into (a) top and (b) rising categories. The top category refers to the most popular search queries and contains score values (0-100). While, the rising category refers to queries with the biggest increase in search frequency since the last time period. A select number of search queries can be labelled as 'breakout' referring to a tremendous increase at that given time.",

The use of Pearson's correlation follows the choice of previous studies [16, 27, 28] that correlated GDT and dengue and, in addition, no controls for correlated errors were used. The first GDT data type refers to the generated weekly value for a yearly period. It should be emphasized that GDT values are relative and can change depending on the specified time range used during the search query. For instance, the GDT value for a specific week using a one-year query would not be necessarily the same when a two-year query is used. This is because a displayed GDT value is highly dependent on the highest query volume for a given time period. Moreover, GDT has a limit or restriction in displaying weekly values. It can only generate weekly values up to a maximum time period of 4 years and further than that will result in generating monthly values. If one does not realize how these values are calculated and displayed by Google Trends, researchers opt to 'stitch' together yearly GDT values, which is inappropriate.",

To employ the GDT adjustment, we obtained the monthly-level GDT query value of dengue for the entire period of 2009-2014 and then collected GDT weekly-level query value per year of 2009-2014. Afterwards, we multiplied each weekly-level value by the monthly-level query result and divided it by the monthly-level average from the weekly data. This adjustment procedure accounts for differences in the relative prevalence of searches over time in the stacked weekly-level data. Thus, the second GDT data type is the weekly adjusted value (AdjGDT). On the other hand, the first dengue data type is the calculated weekly dengue incidence rate (DI) while its log transformed (LogDI) is the second dengue data type. Log transformation was performed in order to reduce the skewing of the data and destabilize the variance.",

To quantify the categorized themes per year, the percentage value was used by obtaining the sum of GDT values for each year and category and then dividing it to the maximum GDT summation value of a particular year. Word clouds of the top search queries in each period were created using WordArt (www.wordart.com). Previous studies have used this web application to create customized word clouds wherein the size of the words or phrases can be adjusted based on their frequency [39, 40] . However, instead of frequency, the size of each search query was based on the 'interest over time' value provided by Google Trends. Simply put, bigger words in the word cloud mean high search query value, and in turn, mean high interest over time. In this study, the word cloud was patterned using the map of Metropolitan Manila. Figure 2 shows the temporal pattern of all dengue and GDT data types. It can be observed that the GDT trend (Figure 2a,b) follows the seasonal dengue pattern of Metropolitan Manila. However, 2009, 2013, and 2014 GDT trend pattern do not closely match the expected dengue incidence (DI) pattern except when it is transformed into its logarithmic function (LogDI). Further analysis demonstrated that the association of observed weekly values of DI were moderately associated (r = 0.405) to the weekly GDT values and the association between GDT and LogDI was slightly lower (r = 0.394) ( Table 1 ). As per Risteski and Davcev's [35, 36] recommendations, the weekly GDT values (AdjGDT) were adjusted accordingly. It can be observed that the AdjGDT values still follow the seasonal dengue pattern except for the periods of 2012 and 2013 and the trend pattern of the AdjGDT does not conform to the temporal pattern of LogDI (Figure 2c,d) . The association of the AdjGDT values showed higher correlation coefficients for DI (r = 0.662) and log transformed DI (r = 0.597) as compared to unadjusted GDT (Table 1) . Interestingly, when the DI was scaled accordingly (ScDI and LogScDI) and plotted with the unadjusted GDT values, the temporal trends were nearly similar to each other (Figure 2e,f) . Moreover, the association of GDT to ScDI (r = 0.747) and LogScDI (r = 0.660) were higher as compared to the association of DI from unadjusted and adjusted GDT (Table 1) . Lastly, when AdjGDT and ScDI were plotted, the temporal patterns did not closely match each other (data not shown). These observed patterns are the same between DI and GDT (Figure 2a,b) . However, correlations of AdjGDT with ScDI (r = 0.529) and LogScDI (r = 0.470) were higher as compared to unadjusted and unscaled variables.",

Previous dengue studies that assessed the association with GDT used a monthly time scale, therefore, an adjustment procedure is unnecessary. In most dengue-endemic countries such as the Philippines, health agencies implement and follow a weekly reporting of the said disease [47] .

When we compare the correlation coefficients of DI and LogDI with adjusted or unadjusted GDT, DI showed a slightly better correlation estimate than LogDI. It should be emphasized that while previous studies utilized either DI [17, 27] or total number of dengue cases [28, 48] our study stresses that choosing a certain dengue data type could affect the association with GDT. Therefore, future researchers investigating this endeavor should consider not only what GDT data type to use appropriately but also the dengue data type.",

            "text": "In Table 1 , the temporal correlation between GDT and dengue was revealed to be moderately associated (r = 0.394 to 0.747). This is in contrast with previous studies [27, 28] that yielded high correlation coefficients (e.g., 0.8-0.9). However, these studies examined the association with GDT in a nation-or country-wide scale as compared to the present study that focused only to one region in the Philippines. There is only one study that investigated the association of GDT and dengue in a regional scale where the correlation among different regions varies substantially with a high correlation coefficient resulting from regions with higher dengue incidence [27] . We infer that other factors such as the climate play a role in the temporal pattern of dengue incidence in Metropolitan Manila as suggested by a recent study [49] . Therefore, it is further recommended and worthwhile to investigate the incorporation of GDT with climate-based models in predicting future dengue risk from novel statistical approaches [27, 49] . Further analysis using cross-correlation results revealed that GDT has a delayed effect (1-2 weeks) to the reported dengue incidence. We hypothesized that this delayed effect may stem from the users' self-diagnosis of their medical condition before going to the hospital for possible admission and management of the disease. Given that we are in the information age, it is more likely that users are seeking health information through the Internet, thus having an idea about their illness before consulting a doctor. This corroborates with our thematic analysis where majority of search queries of dengue refer to its 'signs and symptoms'. It was claimed that an increase of health-seeking behavior from Internet users would pertain the surrounding environment being affected by the disease [28] . Therefore, GDT could complement as a real-time disease monitoring tool [48] . However, this approach has its limitations and drawbacks as exemplified when Google Trends was assessed during the influenza pandemic of 2009, the 2012/2013 flu epidemic season in the US and, the Ebola pandemic in Africa [47, 50] . These studies outlined that the Google Trends platform is limited to the proportion of the population who use the Internet to obtain health-related information [47] , intense media coverage [50] [51] [52] and algorithm dynamics [51] [52] [53] . Moreover, the application of GDT may only be suited to areas with high dengue incidence [29] . Since the study was only limited in investigating one region in the Philippines, our interpretation cannot be the same in other regions with a large proportion of users situated in rural areas where Internet access is limited.",

Although previous studies [17, 21] and the results of our analysis showed the temporal relatedness of GDT and dengue incidence, relying only on search query data for making future public health decisions on dengue may trigger unnecessary panic from the public [48] . On the contrary, results from GDT can help to identify hotspots where further dengue investigations can be conducted. This is in line with the concept of 'now-casting' where potential locations for dengue cases can be predicted at present (through real-time monitoring of GDT data) rather than in the future to prevent outbreaks [16] . While countries with underdeveloped disease surveillance systems can greatly benefit from real-time monitoring of GDT data to supplement traditional epidemiologic investigations when identifying hotspots [17] , caution should still be made considering that not all actual hotspots can be identified due to variations in Internet access [16] . Overall, GDT's capability as an early warning signal for outbreaks can only be attained if it can be combined with meteorological, environmental, social, and entomological factors to produce a robust dengue prediction model [48, 54] . Therefore, more work is needed to establish the reliability and real-world applicability of GDT results for dengue surveillance and control [21] .",

These cities also consistently showed high GDT values across all time periods. These three cities share common characteristics that resulted to such an outcome. One of the characteristics could be the cities' high population density that contributes to the presence of a high proportion of Internet users. Previous works in the US suggest that high population density correlates with more Internet users [52, 55] . Another characteristic would be the presence of major business districts, hospitals, educational institutions and recreational activities (e.g., shopping malls) in these cities which indicates rapid urbanization. A study from 28 Asian countries, including the Philippines, showed that urbanization is related to higher Internet penetration [56] . As of January 2018, the Internet penetration rate in the Philippines is 63% which translates to 67 million users [57] , the majority of whom are residents of urban areas such as Metropolitan Manila. In general, people living in urban areas with high population density tend to have more Internet access and this facilitates greater health seeking on the Internet. In line with this, the aforementioned characteristics of these cities with GDT values could partially explain why the study did not find a significant spatial relationship with DI at the city level. It should be emphasized that each identified dengue case would use the patient's residential location to report in the national health agency. Therefore, we hypothesize that search activity in dengue may likely occur in a person's work or school location (e.g., Makati, Quezon, or Manila) rather than in their residence (e.g., San Juan). Search queries performed by users would not particularly coincide with their place of residence since this highly urbanized region would promote frequent mobilization or traveling from one city to the other. Moreover, Internet access in these highly-developed cities may be considerably better than their residence due to the occurrence business districts and recreational activities (e.g., shopping malls).",

Scholars have advised that searching for disease-specific search queries may not correspond to true illness [15] . Considering that some of dengue's signs and symptoms might overlap with other diseases, such as chikungunya and measles, the values reflected in Google Trends might not fully indicate disease-specific occurrence and might just reflect greater health anxiety among people.",

The theory indicates that the media (news outlets) influence the placing of importance upon topics of the public agenda. This could explain some of the breakout search queries since it might be a result of high media coverage of an incident that reflect the search query. For instance, media reports of increasing dengue cases in Metropolitan Manila and other regions in 2011 [64] might have led people to perform more search queries related to dengue signs and symptoms than in 2010. Moreover, the proliferation of news in 2013 related to the dengue diagnosis of Michael V, a Filipino celebrity [46] , might have spiked interest to search for 'Michael V dengue' on Google during that year.",

Moreover, while it is unclear how these limitations can be addressed, it can be used as a core component for future studies regarding the utilization of Google Trends for disease surveillance. While GDT data can be used to supplement traditional surveillance methods in a developing country like the Philippines, it should be combined with other factors (e.g., meteorological, environmental, social, and entomological) to improve its applicability for public health decisions.",

Further analysis showed that majority of the search activity pertains to the 'signs and symptoms' of dengue. These findings indicate how the Internet acts as an empowering technology in gaining knowledge about dengue. However, users might also utilize this technology in conducting self-diagnoses without proper medical consultation.
