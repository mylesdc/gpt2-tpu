Finally, 221 IBV strains were confirmed by dwarf embryo test and RT-PCR assay. By virus recovery trials, 187 of the isolates caused the birds died or distressed from nephritis, which was accordant with the clinical record. Results: Based on epidemiology analysis of recent field isolates of nephropathogenic IB in vaccinated farms in China, YL6 strain were used for vaccination and evaluated by antibody titer and challenge tests. The immunoprotection test indicated that the practical application of vaccine based on the recent field strains could finely facilitate controlling the nephropathogenic IB. Conclusions: Our study was aim at setting a guide for safeguard against nephropathogenic IBV-caused disease in China.",

Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) was first reported in the USA for replicating in the respiratory tract and some other epithelial cells of gut, kidney, and oviduct. Subsequently, some strains of IBV caused pathology in non-respiratory organs (such as kidney and gonads) were documented [1] . The clinical disease and production problems frequently cause catastrophic economic losses to the poultry industry, accompanied by decreased production performance in breeder flocks, diminished egg production and poor egg quality in laying flocks [1] [2] [3] . In China, IB has a more profound social impact for chicken industrial contributes to the rural economy. More importantly, there is accumulating evidence that nephropathogenic type IB has been more and more prevalent in China recently, but the strains isolated in earlier years mainly caused respiratory signs, which suggested that selecting and immunization with the appropriate vaccine strain is of great importance to control IB infection [4] [5] [6] [7] .",

However, this symphysial vaccine manner was restricted by the diversity of the IBV strains. Since IBV strains were first isolated and identified in China in 1982, various live-attenuated and inactivated vaccines derived from respiratorytyped strains have been widely and extensively used in chicken farms to reduce the adverse effect of the IBV [6, 7] . However, the disease continues to emerge and cause serious production problems, even occurred in routinely vaccinated layer and breeder flocks in China, and the situation gets worse as time progressed [9] . The most possible explanation for this phenomenon may be that the vaccine effectiveness is diminished by poor cross-protection against the circulating strains.",

The commercial vaccine was consisted of H120 strain and W93 strain, the latter one was nephropathogenic strain, but attenuated and started for vaccination in 1990s. The error-prone nature of RNA polymerase made the S1 gene could easily generate mutations to bring about new variation strain. Persistent evolutionary variations caused the distant genetic relationship between the vaccine strains and the circulating strains. Our previous report had determined that nephropathogenic IBVs were mainly A2-like strains in China in recent years, showed evolutionarily distant from vaccine strains [4] .",

To control the prevalence and well prepare for the potential outbreaks of IB, the candidate virus strain for vaccination might be selected timely. Therefore, continuing surveillance of new IBV strains and selecting the representative virus strain for vaccination would be the most effective manner to reduce the economic losses caused by IB. We hope the study could contribute to guiding the development of effective vaccines and establishment of control policy for nephropathogenic IB.",

Viruses in the homogenized tissue pool of kidney and trachea of the field isolates were propagated by inoculating via the allantoic cavity of 10 day old SPF embryonated eggs for more than three passages. The embryos dying within 24 hours of inoculation were screened to be nonspecific deaths. The isolates caused stunting, dwarfing, curling of the embryo or the presence of urates in the mesonephros after 5 days incubation were indicative of IB virus replication. The viruses were further confirmed by RT-PCR assays. The allantoic fluids containing IBV isolates after 72 h post inoculation were harvested and preserved in liquid nitrogen.",
