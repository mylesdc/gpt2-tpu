We determined the minimal mechanism of helicase function by nsp13. We showed a clear unwinding lag with increasing length of the double-stranded region of the nucleic acid, suggesting the presence of intermediates in the unwinding process. To elucidate the nature of the intermediates we carried out transient kinetic analysis of the nsp13 helicase activity. We demonstrated that the enzyme unwinds nucleic acid in discrete steps of 9.3 base-pairs (bp) each, with a catalytic rate of 30 steps per second. Therefore the net unwinding rate is ,280 base-pairs per second. We also showed that nsp12, the SARS-CoV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), enhances (2-fold) the catalytic efficiency of nsp13 by increasing the step size of nucleic acid (RNA/RNA or DNA/DNA) unwinding. This effect is specific for SARS-CoV nsp12, as no change in nsp13 activity was observed when foot-and-mouth-disease virus RdRp was used in place of nsp12. Our data provide experimental evidence that nsp13 and nsp12 can function in a concerted manner to improve the efficiency of viral replication and enhance our understanding of nsp13 function during SARS-CoV RNA synthesis.",

            "text": "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is the causative agent of SARS, a life-threatening illness characterized by flu-like syndrome such as high fever, pneumonia, dyspnoea, infiltrates on chest radiography and sometimes respiratory failure [1] . The global spread of SARS caused hundreds of deaths and had enormous negative impact to the global economy in [2003] [2004] . SARS-CoV is a positive single-stranded (ss) RNA virus with one of the largest known RNA genomes (,29.7 kb) [2, 3] . SARS-CoV gene expression involves poorly understood transcriptional and translational regulatory mechanisms. Following infection, there is translation of two large replicative polyproteins, the pp1a (the ORF1a polyprotein) and the pp1ab (the polyprotein made from the ORF1a and ORF1b through a 21 ribosomal frameshift during translation). These polyproteins are processed by the virus-encoded papain-like proteinase (PL pro ; residing in nsp3) and nsp5, a 3C-like proteinase [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] . This auto-proteolysis leads to formation of 16 non-structural proteins, including an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and an NTPase/helicase that are known as non-structural proteins 12 and 13, respectively (nsp12 and nsp13). These are likely to form the core of membrane-bound replication-transcription complexes in double-membrane vesicles at perinuclear regions [11] . Helicases are motor proteins that unwind double-stranded nucleic acids into two single-stranded nucleic acids by utilizing the energy derived from nucleotide hydrolysis [12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19] . Although, helicases were initially thought as molecular engines that unwind nucleic acids during replication, recombination, and DNA repair [16] , recent reports have shown that they are also involved in other biological processes, including displacement of proteins from nucleic acid, movement of Holliday junctions, chromatin remodeling, catalysis of nucleic acid conformational changes [20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25] , several aspects of RNA metabolism, including transcription, mRNA splicing, mRNA export, translation, RNA stability and mitochondrial gene expression [11] . Defects in helicase function have been associated with some human diseases, including Bloom's syndrome, Werner's syndrome, and Xeroderma Pigmentosum [26, 27, 28, 29] . The specific function of nsp13 in SARS-CoV replication has yet to be established. It is thought to interact with other SARS-CoV non-structural proteins, such as nsp7, nsp8 and nsp12 [30, 31, 32] and probably contribute to the formation of a replication complex, but the effect of these interactions on nsp13 unwinding activity is unknown.",

These studies were conducted using constructs of nsp13 that were fused with maltose binding protein (MBP-nsp13) and hexahistidine (H 6 -nsp13) . Additional studies demonstrated that the amplitude of DNA unwinding by H 6 -nsp13 increases with longer 59-overhang containing DNA substrates [36] . These data advanced our understanding of nsp13 function [37, 38] , but they do not address key mechanistic details such as the kinetic step size, rate of nucleic acid unwinding, and the ATP-coupling stoichiometry.

Hence, we prepared GST-nsp13 using a baculovirus expression system and this construct was primarily used to characterize in detail the kinetics of nucleic acid unwinding by SARS-CoV helicase, but we also carried out similar analyses with MBP-nsp13 and H 6 -nsp13 and compared them with GST-nsp13 to ensure that we were not measuring a GST-related artifact. We found that GST-nsp13 was significantly more active than the other variants and had activity comparable to other helicases [39] . In our enzyme characterization, we used both RNA and DNA substrates, as the biological role of SARS-CoV nsp13 is expected to be unwinding of RNA substrate. Moreover, we determined the effect of nsp12 on the mechanism of nsp13. Our data demonstrate that regardless of the type of fusion tag or substrate use, the helicase activity of nsp13 is enhanced in the presence of nsp12, suggesting that these proteins also interact in a functional replication complex and that their interaction contributes to the efficiency of viral replication. Our results allow mechanistic comparisons with other viral or eukaryotic helicases and set the stage for studying the intriguing evolutionary relations between helicases from nidoviruses and other groups of positive sense RNA viruses.",

The results presented in Figure 1 show that GST-nsp13 unwound half of the substrate in ,0.1 seconds. However, MBP-nsp13 and H 6 -nsp13 reached the same unwinding level at approximately 60 and 100 seconds, respectively. GST-nsp13 unwound the full amount of the nucleic acid in approximately 5 seconds, whereas it took more than 600 seconds for MBP-nsp13 and H 6 -nsp13 to achieve the same task. These results demonstrated that H 6 -nsp13 was the slowest of the three enzymes and that GST-nsp13 is faster than the other variants by up to three orders of magnitude. We also compared the ATPase activities of these three variants of nsp13. We determined ATP hydrolysis by measuring released Pi using thin-layer chromatography and obtained the initial rate constants by fitting the data to single exponential curves. The initial rate constants were then plotted against [ATP] and the data were fit to a hyperbolic function, yielding k hydro(ATP) of 104.164.0 s 21 for GST-nsp13 and 0.2260.006 s 21 for H 6 -nsp13 (Figure 2A and 2B) . The MBP-nsp13 variant also showed similar rate of ATP hydrolysis as the H 6 -nsp13 (data not shown). Hence, most subsequent experiments for biochemical characterization were performed with GST-nsp13, and were generally repeated with H 6 -nsp13 and MBP-nsp13.",

None of the nsp13 variants could unwind substrates with 39-end single-strand overhang or blunt-end DNA and RNA duplexes [6, 34, 35] . However, we show here that nsp13 can unwind nucleic acid secondary structure elements (a stem-loop structure). This was shown using the 48/18-mer and 55/18-mer substrates ( Figure S1 ), which mimic one of the stem loop structures present at the 59 UTR of SARS-CoV genome. These two substrates (48/18-mer and 55/18-mer) differed in the length of 59 single strand overhang before the loop ( Figure 3B and Figure S1 ). The 55/18-mer substrate was readily unwound in contrast to the unwinding of 48/ 18-mer, which was only partially unwound suggesting that nsp13 can unwind stem loops provided the substrate has a 59-end overhang loading region ( Figure 3B ).",

Using these substrates we monitored the unwinding activity of GST-nsp13. GST-nsp13 could not unwind the 23/18-mer that has only 5 bases ssDNA at the 59-end, but it did unwind the 28/18-mer (10 bases ssDNA at 59-end), 31/18-mer (13 bases ssDNA at 59-end), and 38/ 18-mer (20 bases at 59-end), suggesting that it requires more than 5-base-long 59-loading strand ( Figure 3C ).",

The experimental data for all the substrates were fit globally to equation (1) derived from Scheme 1 ( Figure 4A ). The resulting fits are shown in Figure 4B and the kinetic parameters are listed in Table 1 . Notably, the amplitude of product decreases as the length L T of the dsDNA substrate increases, consistent with a dissociation step as shown in Scheme 1 ( Figure 1 ). The individual uncorrected kinetic step size for different lengths of dsDNA varied from 14.3 to 16.4 as the length of dsDNA region decreased from 60 to 18 bp. Previous studies have shown that the last 8-10 bp of dsDNA can melt spontaneously in the presence of an active helicase [38] . Thus, it is essential to take into consideration the length of dsDNA that spontaneously melts when calculating the kinetic step size rather than using the full length of dsDNA. Hence, the value L 0 used in Table 2 and equation 7 was set to 10 bp.",

            "text": "Previous reports have shown that several DNA and RNA helicases interact with their corresponding polymerases. These interactions generally enhance the unwinding activity of helicases [49, 50, 51] . Evidence from yeast-two-hybrid experiments suggested that SARS-CoV polymerase (nsp12) interacts with nsp13 [31] . To investigate if nsp12 affects the helicase activity of nsp13 we monitored the unwinding of the 80/60-mer DNA substrates (5 nM) by GST-nsp13 (100 nM) in the presence of nsp12 (0 nM, 250 nM, and 500 nM) under conditions described in 'Materials and Methods'. The results showed that 500 nM nsp12 clearly enhanced the unwinding rate (mk U , base-pairs per second) of nsp13 by ,2-fold ( Figure 5 and Table 3 ). This enhancement is accompanied by a change in the step size from 7.9 to 14.3 for this specific substrate (Table 3) demonstrating that the presence of nsp12 can change the rate and the mechanism of helicase activity. 500 nM of nsp12 was used because optimal unwinding of nucleic acid by nsp13 in the presence of nsp12 was observed at this concentration ( Figure S3 ). Also, the effect of nsp12 on the ATPase activity of nsp13 was examined, and no enhancement of the ATPase activity was observed (data not shown).Our data suggest that this enhancement is independent of the type of substrate (dsDNA vs. dsRNA) or protein tag (GST vs. H 6 ). A similar effect was observed when H 6 -nsp13 helicase activity was monitored in the presence of nsp12. The rate of unwinding the shorter 31/18mer RNA substrate increased from 0.360.02 to 1.560.15 (mk U , base-pairs per second) and the rate of unwinding 31/18-mer DNA increased from 0.760.05 to 1.860.07 (mk U , base-pairs per second) ( Figures 6C,6D and Table 4 ) with minimal change in the amplitude. However, the effect on the amplitude is more significant with the substrate with longer duplex region, 80/60mer DNA substrate ( Figure 5 ). Using the same 31/18-mer substrates, GST-nsp13 exhibited similar helicase activity enhancement as H 6 -nsp13 ( Figures 6A, 6B , and Table 4 ). Notably, this enhancement is specific, as it was not observed when the nsp12 SARS RdRp was substituted with the foot-and-mouth disease virus RdRp (FMDV 3Dpol) ( Figures 6A, 6B , and Table 4 ).",

C) Four different substrates with 59 overhang lengths varying from 5 to 20 nucleotides were designed to determine the minimum length of loading strand required by nsp13 to efficiently unwind its substrate. The helicase activity of nsp13 (10 nM) was assessed on these substrates (5 nM each) at 30uC for 10 mins and the products were separated on a non-denaturing 6% polyacrylamide gel and visualized using the PhosphorImager. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0036521.g003 and baculovirus expression systems. GST-nsp13 protein expressed in bacterial systems was insoluble, whereas when expressed in a baculovirus expression system it was highly soluble ( Figure S2 ). GST-nsp13 expressed in baculovirus displayed much higher unwinding and ATPase activities than the H 6 -or MBP-tagged proteins (Figure 1 and Figure 2 ). This enzyme showed same polarity as reported before for two other variants of nsp13 [34, 35] . GST-nsp13 requires at least a five nucleotide 59-end single strand overhang for efficient unwinding similar to human coronavirus 229E helicase [52] . GST-nsp13 can unwind secondary structures of nucleic acid (such as those present in viral genome) as long as a sufficient 59 single strand overhang is available. Unlike MBP-nsp13 and H 6 -nsp13, GST-nsp13 has a helicase activity comparable to other viral, bacterial and eukaryotic helicases. We and others have been unable to hydrolytically remove the affinity tags from nsp13 [34, 35] presumably because the engineered cleavage site is not easily accessible to the protease. Notably, exogenously added GST did not have any effect on the rate of nucleic acid unwinding by both H 6 -nsp13 ( Figures 6C and 6D ) and MBP-nsp13 (data not shown), suggesting that the higher activity of GST-nsp13 is not a result of a GST artifact. It is not clear why GST-nsp13 is more active than H 6 -nsp13. The two proteins appear to have comparable affinities for dsDNA as seen in gel shift experiments (results not shown). Comparison of the ATP hydrolysis rate by GST-nsp13 and H 6 -nsp13 showed that H 6 -nsp13 hydrolyzes ATP slower than GST-nsp13. Hence, based on these experiments we decided to biochemically characterize the GST-nsp13 enzyme, although most of the experiments were also carried out with H 6 -nsp13. Our detailed biochemical analysis showed that GST-nsp13 unwinds DNA at a rate (k u ) of 30 steps per second, with each step being approximately 9.3 bps. The kinetic characterization of several helicases have shown that the step size for DNA unwinding varies between (1-20 bps) [53, 54, 55, 56] . We used Scientist 3.0 (Micromath) software for obtaining the kinetic parameters, and these parameters were also confirmed with the Dynafit 4.0 (BioKin Ltd, MA) and Kintec Explorer (Kintek Corporation, PA) software packages. Helicase processivity provides a measure of the fraction of unwound nucleic acid before dissociation.",

On the other hand, unlike pestivirus or flavivirus helicases, SARS-CoV nsp13 binds a 59 overhang and moves 59R39 to unwind double stranded RNA [34, 35] . Despite the fact that the enzymatic functions of nsp13 and nsp12 have opposite polarities (59-39 vs 39-59 of the template strand)nsp12 and nsp13 may work together to carry out the following RC functions: 1) Synthesis of subgenomic transcripts containing the leader sequence derived from the 59end of the genome [34, 35] . To accomplish this, nsp12 would have to copy RNA in a 39R59 template direction, followed by pausing at transcription regulatory element sites. Such pauses may trigger motion in the opposite direction allowing nsp13 (aided by nsp12 and possibly other viral and host proteins) to unwind the 39 end of the nascent RNA primer and facilitate transfer to the complementary region of the 59-leader genomic sequence [34, 35] . 2) Data in Figure 3B suggest that nsp13 is capable of disrupting secondary structures of nucleic acid, only when they can be accessed by an upstream 59-single stranded region. Hence, stem-loop ''roadblocks'' are likely to be cleared by RCs that approach the stem loop from the 59 ssRNA direction. Ongoing biochemical experiments focus on characterizing RC functions that involve nsp13.",

The protein was further purified by size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 200 10/ 300GL column (GE Healthcare). The purified protein (,95% pure) was stored at 280uC in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and 5% glycerol. Despite repeated attempts under several conditions, the GST N-terminal tag could not be cleaved using thrombin.",

Kanamycin-resistant colonies were grown at 37uC and protein expression was induced at A 600 of 0.9-1.0 by the addition of 1 mM isopropyl b-D-1thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and the cells were allowed to grow for 3 more hrs after induction. The cells were harvested by centrifugation (4,500 g, 20 min) and stored at 220uC. Frozen cell pellets were resuspended in buffer A (25 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl and 5% glycerol). The protein was purified by nickel-affinity chromatography with a gradient of 25 mM to 500 mM imidazole in buffer A. Fractions containing pure protein (,95%) were pooled and dialyzed against the storage buffer containing 12.5 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl and 50% glycerol. b Correction for bp separated without direct helicase action as described in Table 1 and reference 48.
