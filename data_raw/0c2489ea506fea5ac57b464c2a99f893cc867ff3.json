            "text": "Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the major infectious cause of lower respiratory tract illness in infants and young children around the world. 1,2 It has also been recognized as an important etiologic agent of pneumonia and other respiratory tract infections in adults and elderly patients. 3, 4 The clinical presentation of this infection varies widely, from mild upper respiratory tract disease to bronchiolitis and pneumonia. 5 This virus is responsible for the majority of bronchiolitis cases and causes approximately 50% of pneumonia cases during the first years of life. 6 In children, host factors such as young age, prematurity, and chronic cardiopulmonary diseases have been associated with severe disease. In addition, other factors such as lower socioeconomic status, exposure to cigarette smoke, air pollution, crowded households, and the lack of breastfeeding have also been associated with severe disease. 7 Viral factors associated with virulence leading to severe disease are not sufficiently understood. 8 Human RSV is a member of the Paramyxoviridae family. Outbreaks of RSV infections occur between fall and spring in temperate climates and tend to last up to 5 months. 9,10 RSV isolates can be divided into two groups: group A and group B based on antigenic and genetic characteristics. 8 These two groups cocirculate in the human population, with group A being more prevalent. Several studies have compared the severity of disease between infants infected with RSV group A and group B with mixed results. Most studies have not found significant clinical differences between both subtypes. 8 Despite the recognized importance of RSV as a cause of respiratory illness, the information regarding the epidemiology of this virus in Latin America, particularly among adults, is limited. 11 In the present study, 570 cases of RSV infection identified during four epidemic years in Mexico were evaluated to clarify the epidemiology of this infection and to assess the possible variations in demographic and clinical characteristics according to viral groups. Results from patients enrolled during the first year of the study have previously been described. 6 In this report, we analyzed the characteristics of 570 patients (399 children and 171 adults) with confirmed RSV infection included in the study during a 4-year period.",

To improve our understanding of the epidemiological features of respiratory tract infections caused by influenza and other viruses in Mexico, a cohort study to determine the etiology and clinical characteristics of patients presenting with ILI was performed between 2010 and 2014. The study was conducted by the Mexican Emerging Infectious Diseases Clinical Research Network (La Red), a collaboration established by the Mexican Ministry of Health and the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.

Our study illustrates the importance of RSV as a cause of serious respiratory illness affecting not only pediatric patients. We observed that, similar to influenza, young infants and the elderly show higher proportions of RSV-associated hospitalizations than middle-aged adults. However, the precise role of different underlying conditions as risk factors for severe infection in this population could not be established. Additional prospective studies are needed to identify populations that may benefit from current or future preventive interventions against RSV, such as vaccines. AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS Ana E.

Because of the differences in risk factors described in pediatric and adult patients, a separate analysis was carried out for these two groups(Tables 4 and 5). Variables with a significant association on univariate analysis (P<.05) were included in a multivariate logistic regression model. In children, factors with a significant independent association with RSV hospitalization included patient's age (younger children with higher risk) and the presence of another respiratory pathogen (reduced risk in those with coinfection) (Table 6).

Infections caused by this virus were detected year-round, but had a notable seasonal distribution with high circulation during the fall and winter. Overall, the highest numbers of detections were recorded between October and December. The predominant subtype was RSV A over the four seasons, although during the last season included in the study the number of RSV B detections was similar to that of RSV A.In recent years, there has been a growing interest on the impact of RSV infection in adults. RSV has been reported to be one of the leading causes of community-acquired pneumonia in adults, just behind Streptococcus pneumonia and influenza virus.3 In this study, RSV was detected in 4.6% of adults with respiratory tract infections and ILI.Previous studies have also found a significant role of RSV in adults; for instance, Johnstone et al.13 detected the presence of RSV in 2.6% of cases of community-acquired pneumonia in adults. In a recent study including adults with respiratory tract infections assessed in the emergency room or in the hospital, RSV was also detected in 2.6% of patients. 14 In another study, RSV was detected in 7.4% of respiratory illnesses in subjects \u2265 65 years from 14 countries with moderate-tosevere ILI and was more prevalent in hospitalized patients.15 Thus, our results are consistent with previous reports suggesting that RSV is an important cause of moderate-to-severe ILI and may be associated with hospitalization in the elderly.16 In this study, multiple viruses were detected in some samples from children and adults because of the use of a multiplex RT-PCR assay, which can detect 19-22 different respiratory pathogens. The combination of RSV A and rhinovirus was the coinfection most frequently found. The role of other viruses during RSV infection has been subject of previous studies.17 Rhinovirus is one of the most frequently reported viruses in combination with RSV.18 An increase in disease severity during viral coinfection has been suggested in several of these reports. However, not all studies concur in their results.19 In our study,",
