This study addressed this by a retrospective analysis of the respiratory specimens collected from children aged <5 years with acute febrile respiratory symptoms who were admitted to two hospitals that together catered for 72\u00c15% of all pediatric admissions on Hong Kong Island. Respiratory viruses were tested for by immunofluorescence (RSV, influenza A/B, parainfluenza types I-III, adenovirus) with turnaround time of several hours and results known to attending pediatricians at the time, and culture and PCR (results not known to pediatricians) in nasal secretions. The study was approved by the Institution Review Board of Queen Mary Hospital/Hong Kong West Cluster.",

Sixty children, of whom 53 had a respiratory sample sent for testing, were given the discharge diagnosis of pneumonia by the attending pediatricians based on physical examination, CXR and laboratory investigation, and treated as bacterial pneumonia with a full course of beta-lactam antibiotic. The seven children who did not have an NPA were admitted around the time of the SARS outbreak. One child tested positive for SARS-CoV. Thirtytwo (60\u00c14%) children who were diagnosed of bacterial pneumonia by pediatricians and tested for respiratory virus had at least one virus detected. Seven children with pediatrician diagnosed bacterial pneumonia had two viruses detected: adenovirus and rhinovirus (RV) in 2, bocavirus and RV in 2, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and adenovirus in 1, RSV and bocavirus in 1, and RSV and RV in 1. There was no statistically significant difference in detection frequency in those <2 years and 2 to <5 years of age for any virus. (data not shown). Nineteen (31\u00c16%) children were diagnosed and treated for superimposed bacterial pneumonia after the availability of rapid virology test results, while a viral association was not suspected in another 22% of children treated for bacterial pneumonia. There was no statistically significant difference in clinical severity between children with bacterial pneumonia with or without associated viral detected although there was a trend that those who had a virus detected were more likely to require supplementary oxygen (data not shown).",

In summary, this study showed that respiratory viruses play a significant role in young children hospitalized and treated for presumed bacterial pneumonia, whether as co-infection or misdiagnosed as bacterial pneumonia, and documented the agespecific hospitalization incidences in children <5 years.",
