Evaluation of the thermal stability of the LTR G-quadruplexes in different-length oligonucleotides showed that the protein is fit to be most active in the LTR full-length environment. When hnRNP A2/B1 was silenced in cells, LTR activity decreased, indicating that the protein acts as a HIV-1 transcription activator. Our data highlight a tightly regulated control of transcription based on G-quadruplex folding/unfolding, which depends on interacting cellular proteins. These findings provide a deeper understanding of the viral transcription mechanism and may pave the way to the development of drugs effective against the integrated HIV-1, present both in actively and latently infected cells.",

Chi 2 and U-values were < 10 and < 15, respectively, indicating optimal data fitting 28, 29 . In contrast, binding to a random oligonucleotide of the same length as LTR-II + III + IV was so low that in these conditions it was not possible to obtain a meaningful K D value (Fig. 2 ). hnRNP A2 unfolds the LTR G4s. We next set out to investigate the effect of hnRNP A2 binding to the LTR G4s. A Taq polymerase stop assay was performed on the LTR-II + III + IV template. In the presence of 100 mM K + , stop sites corresponding to formation of LTR-III and LTR-II were visible (compare lanes 1 and 2, Fig. 3a ). No stop corresponding to LTR-IV was detected, as expected, since LTR-IV has been previously reported to form upon induction by G4 ligands 18 . Upon addition of hnRNP A2, both LTR-III and LTR-II stop sites showed an insignificant decrease (compare lanes 3 and 2, Fig. 3a and b) . Similarly, no effect was induced by addition of K + and hnRNP A2 in the control LTR-II + III + IV M4 + 5 template lacking the possibility to form G4 (lanes 5-7, Fig. 3a) .",

            "text": "As suggested by Xodo 30 , the apparent lack of effect in the presence of an unfolding protein could be due to the protein binding to the template sequence which would stimulate polymerase stop and mask G4 release at the same binding site. We thus switched to a dual-labelled system where oligonucleotide folding could be monitored by changes in fluorescence. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) is a spectroscopic technique that provides information about structure and dynamics of nucleic acids folding. It involves a donor fluorophore in an excited state, the excitation energy of which can be transferred to a proximal acceptor chromophore. Given that the major determinant of FRET efficiency is the distance between the acceptor and the donor, fluorescence intensities depict nucleic acids folding states. Consequently, when annealed to its complementary sequence to form a double-stranded structure, the tested oligonucleotide would yield the maximum fluorescence intensity, while the G4 folded conformation would be the least fluorescent. In these conditions the measured fluorescence intensity allows to calculate the energy transfer (E) and the end-to-end distance (R) between the two fluorophores, and therefore the unfolding degree. The G4 folded LTR-II + III + IV sequence was characterized by R of ~38\u01fa, with E ~0.84. When the G4 structure was converted into the duplex conformation by addition of the complementary C-rich strand, the fluorophores were separated by ~150 \u01fa, and FRET was approximately 0. Treatment of LTR-II + III + IV G4 with hnRNP A2 increased fluorescence by 3-folds with respect to the free G4, and E decreased to 0.51 ( Fig. 4a and b, Supplementary Table S2 ). Considering that the complete unfolding of the G4 structure required \u0394 E = 0.72, the \u0394 E = 0.30 induced by hnRNP A2 reflected a 42% unfolding (Fig. 4c) . The negative control protein BSA showed negligible unfolding activity in these conditions ( Fig. 4c and Supplementary Table S2 ). To test the statistical significance of the effect observed in the presence of the protein, we applied a model comparison approach, which allows to test the statistical role of an independent variable (in our case the hnRNP A2 protein) through the comparison of two models differing only in that variable. The test yielded F (2, 189) = 36.27 and P < 0.05 31 , indicating that the difference observed in the presence and absence of the protein was statistically significant. Analysis of the activity of hnRNP A2 was extended to shorter LTR sequences, i.e. LTR-III + IV, LTR-III and LTR-IV G4s, folded in 100 mM K + . The unfolding of LTR-III + IV and LTR-IV was similar but lower than that on the full-length sequence (31%); unfolding of LTR-III was very low (8.5%) (Fig. 4c 51 is the probability that the observed match is not a random event.",

LTR-III was used as a control sequence where only one G4 could form. We observed that in the full-length LTR-II + III + IV sequence, both LTR-II and LTR-III G4s formed upon addition of K + (lanes 2-3, Fig. 5a ); of these, LTR-III G4 induced a slightly more intense stop than LTR-II, suggesting a preferred formation of LTR-III in the full-length sequence (Fig. 5b) . LTR-III was also the only G4 forming in the LTR-III + IV template (lanes 5-7, Fig. 5a ). Interestingly, the LTR-III that formed in the full-length sequence was less intense than LTR-III forming in the shortest oligonucleotides (compare lanes 2-3, with 6-7 and 9-10, Fig. 5a and b). These data indicate that i) LTR-III is the most prominent G4 among the mutually exclusive LTR G4s and ii) when LTR-III forms in the full-length LTR promoter, its stability maintains a level that is fully susceptible to hnRNP A2 processing.",

In these conditions, LTR-driven transcription decreased by 45% at the highest siRNA concentration in the wt LTR sequence (Fig. 6b) . In contrast, the LTR sequence with two point mutations that disrupt G4 folding was only marginally affected by hnRNP A2/B1 depletion (Fig. 6b) , indicating that the effect was G4-specific. In these conditions, hnRNP A2/ B1-silenced 293T cells showed no reduction in cell viability at 48 h with respect to the controls, thus confirming the consistency of the inhibitory effects on LTR promoter activity. Silencing of hnRNP A2/B1 was also performed in the TZM-bl reporter cell line, which contains stably integrated copies of the luciferase gene under control of the LTR wt promoter and thus closely resembles the integrated provirus.

In this context, the lower virus production observed upon siRNA-mediated depletion of hnRNP A2/B1 in infected cells was ascribed to accumulation of viral genomic RNA in cytoplasmic compartments or in the nucleus 41 . Our results showing decreased transcriptional activity upon depletion of hnRNP A2/B1 indicate a possible additional mechanism of inhibition of virus production mediated by increased G4 folding in the HIV-1 LTR promoter in the absence of hnRNP A2/B1. Surprisingly, overexpression of this protein and other hnRNP members induced similar effects, i.e. inhibition of transcription and reduction of virus production 42 . We suggest that upon stimuli that boost viral transcription (i.e. integral release of LTR G4s upon hnRNP A2/B1 massive overexpression) the virus (or the cell) activates counteracting mechanisms to avoid excessive exploitation of the cell by the virus that would lead to fast cell death, in the end impairing virus production. Therefore, the reported transcription inhibition might be mediated by other factors triggered by hnRNP A2/B1 overexpression.",

In contrast, the same G4 structures folding in a longer context (LTR-II + III + IV) were less stable and were effectively processed by hnRNP A2/B1. Obviously, the longer oligonucleotide better mimes the actual G4 condition in the full-length LTR, as also proved by transcription inhibition obtained by hnRNP A2/B1 depletion in cells that contained the entire HIV-1 LTR. The LTR G4 system displays regulating features similar to those described for the c-myc 43, 44 , HRAS 26 and KRAS oncogene-promoters 30, [45] [46] [47] . As in these eukaryotic G4-modulated promoters, the HIV-1 LTR promoter is processed by G4 stabilizing (nucleolin) 22 and destabilizing proteins (hnRNP A2/B1). Because the LTR promoter has been suggested to be the region where viral latency is regulated 48, 49 , the G4 switch may play a role not only in activation of effective viral transcription, but also in its shift to latency. Currently, only the actively transcribed virus is targeted by antiviral drugs, while eradication of the HIV-1 infection has been made impossible by the existence of reservoirs of the latent virus 50 . Therefore, our findings not only advance our understanding on the mechanism of viral transcription but may also constitute a progress from a therapeutic point of view. , where R 0 (F\u00f6rster distance) is the distance at which energy transfer is 50% of the maximum value. Between FAM and TAMRA fluorophores, R 0 is assumed to be 50\u01fa 26 . F-test (F) and the probability (P) values were calculated using R statistical environment (v. 3.3.2) 31 . A conventional alpha = 0.05 was considered to evaluate the test significance.",

Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T (ATCC # CRL-3216) and TZM-bl cells were grown in DMEM (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Cells were grown in a humidified incubator maintained at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO 2 .Protein nuclear extraction and pull-down assay. Protein nuclear extracts of HEK 293T cells were obtained by using NXTRACT kit (Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy). HEK 293T protein nuclear extracts (150 \u03bc g) were incubated with biotinylated LTR-II + III + IV G4, mutated M4 + 5 and random R oligonucleotides folded (600 nM) in 250 \u03bc l of reaction containing Tris-HCl 20 mM, pH 8, KCl 30 mM, MgCl 2 1.5 mM, protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy) 1%, NaF 5 mM, Na 3 VO 4 (Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy) 1 mM, poly [dI-dC] (Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy) 1.25 ng/\u03bc l for 2 h at 37 \u00b0C. The binding reaction was followed by incubation (2 h at 37 \u00b0C) with 30 \u03bc l of streptavidin-agarose beads (Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy). After PBS and NaCl washes (0.2 and 1 M), beads were collected by brief centrifugation, resuspended in 50 \u03bc l of Laemmli buffer, and finally incubated at 95 \u00b0C for 5 min. Supernatants were separated in 12% SDS-PAGE and, after coomassie staining, the gel lanes of LTR G4 and LTR M4 + 5 were directly in-gel digested and analysed for protein identification by mass spectrometry (MS) (see MS protein identification in ref.22). Briefly, gel lanes cut in ~0.5 cm pieces were first washed with 50% CH 3 OH and 2.5% acetic acid, dehydrated with CH 3 CN, then reduced with 30 \u03bc l of DTT (10 mM in 100 mM NH 4 HCO 3 ) for 30 min at room temperature; the excess of DTT was next neutralized by alkylation with 30 \u03bc l of iodoacetamide (50 mM in 100 mM NH 4 HCO 3 ) for 30 min at room temperature. Bands were washed with 100 mM NH 4 HCO 3 , dehydrated with CH 3 CN twice, and then digested overnight with 1 \u03bc g of MS-grade trypsin (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) in 50 \u03bc l of 50 mM NH 4 HCO 3 . Peptides were extracted twice with 5% formic acid and twice with 50% CH 3 CN/5% formic acid. The peptide mixture was further desalted in a silica nanocolumn (Polymicro Technologies, Phoenix, AZ, USA) packed in house with pinnacle C18 pack material (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The desalted mixture was finally analyzed by direct infusion electrospray ionization (ESI) on a Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA, USA) LTQ-Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer utilizing quartz emitters produced in house. A stainless steel wire was inserted through the back-end of the emitter to supply an ionizing voltage that ranged between 0.8 and 1.2 kV. Putative peptides present in wt LTR-II + III + IV (but not in M4 + 5) samples were submitted to tandem mass spectrometric (MS/MS) analysis. The masses of the 50 most intense fragment ions were employed to perform a Mascot Database Search 51 to identify their parent protein. Significant Mascot hits were accepted as positive matches and their ion score reported",

(b) Analysis of the luciferase activity of the wt and M4 + 5 LTR promoters in 293T cells treated with hnRNP A2/B1 siRNAs, normalized to protein content.Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis. SPR was performed on the Biacore T100 platform (GE Healthcare, Life Science, Milan, Italy). About 1000 RU of human recombinant hnRNP A2 (Origene Technologies, Rockville, USA) were immobilized on Serie S sensor chip CM5 by amine coupling chemistry. Immobilization was performed in HEPES-NaCl running buffer (HEPES pH 7.4 10 mM, NaCl 150 mM, EDTA 3 mM). Flow cell 1 was blank immobilized to permit reference subtraction. Binding analysis of LTR-II + III + IV, LTR-II + III + IV M4 + 5 and LTR-II + III + IV Random sequences was performed at a flow rate of 25 \u03bc l/min, with contact time and dissociation time of 120 s in HEPES-KCl buffer (HEPES pH 7.4 10 mM, KCl 150 mM, EDTA 3 mM). Oligonucleotides folding into G4 structures was performed in HEPES-KCl buffer after heat denaturation at 95 \u00b0C for 5 min and gradual cooling at room temperature. Sensograms were obtained in the concentration range of 31.25 nM-2 \u03bc M. After each oligonucleotide injection the chip surface was regenerated with NaCl 2.5 M solution. All sensograms were corrected by double reference subtraction of blank flow cell response and buffer injection response. Data were fitted to a global 1:1 binding model using BIAevaluation software (GE Healthcare).FRET-melting assay. Oligonucleotides were diluted to 0.1 \u03bc M in lithium cacodylate buffer(10 mM, pH 7.4)    and KCl (indicated in figure legends) heat denatured for 5 min at 95 \u00b0C, and folded in G-quadruplex structure at room temperature for 16 h. Samples were incubated alone, with hnRNP A2 or bovine serum albumin (BSA, negative control) and subsequently fluorescence intensity was monitored from 30 \u00b0C to 95 \u00b0C (1 \u00b0C/min) in a LightCycler II (Roche, Milan, Italy) by observing 6-carboxyfluorescein (6FAM) emission. FRET efficiency (E) was calculated as the total fluorescence intensity of the donor in the absence (I D ) and presence of the acceptor (I DA ), by using E = 1 \u2212 (I DA /I D ). I D and I DA values were obtained on a LS 55 Fluorescence spectrometer (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA) setting the excitation wavelength at 480 nm and recording the emission from 500 to 650 nm. The dual-labelled oligonucleotide was converted into the corresponding duplex, in which the fluorophores are at a distance (R) for which FRET is ~0. R was calculated from FRET efficiency values as",
