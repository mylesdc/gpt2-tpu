            "text": "Each year hundreds of millions of people are afflicted with respiratory tract infections caused by a wide range of viruses. Most cases of respiratory viral infections are asymptomatic or relatively mild, causing minor illness before the patient fully recovers. Serious illness can develop, especially among certain high-risk groups, leading to hospitalization, worsening of chronic conditions, and even death. In between are cases of moderate to severe respiratory tract infections in which patients seek outpatient medical attention, referred to as medically attended acute respiratory infection (ARI). These infections frequently result in lost productivity in the form of work or school absenteeism or reduced productivity due to attendance at work or school while sick (presenteeism).",

These viral pathogens vary in their pathogenesis, epidemiology, and temporal appearance throughout the year, but typically share a common set of symptoms including cough, fever, and rhinorrhea. Among the many viral ARIs seen in primary care each year, only a portion has been routinely tested to determine the offending organism because (i) rapid testing to differentiate among viruses is not readily available, and (ii) available treatments for most respiratory viruses are chiefly palliative, with the exception being antivirals for treatment of influenza.",

During the 2011-2012 influenza season, the multicenter U.S. Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness (Flu VE) Network conducted a study designed to determine the effectiveness of the season's influenza vaccine. That study used singleplex RT-PCR (SRT-PCR) to detect influenza virus. The University of Pittsburgh site of the Flu VE Network also used MRT-PCR. The purposes of this study were to (i) compare the agreement between SRT-PCR and MRT-PCR for influenza virus detection; (ii) examine the distribution of viruses associated with ARI visits during January through April 2012 in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, using MRT-PCR; and (iii) compare personal characteristics and symptoms among those infected with various viruses. This study is among the first to examine a wide range of respiratory viral infections, including four CoVs and four PIVs, resulting in outpatient primary care visits among individuals across a broad age spectrum.",

Eligibility criteria included age \u22656 months as of 9/1/2011 and presentation at one of the participating primary care centers for treatment of an upper respiratory illness of \u22647 days duration, with cough or fever, and not taking an influenza antiviral (oseltamivir or zanamivir) before the medical visit. Emergency department visits were not included. Eligible individuals provided written informed consent, completed an enrollment survey, and were swabbed for nasal and oropharyngeal samples. Influenza vaccination status was combined from electronic medical record (EMR) data and self-report. Influenza activity did not increase appreciably over baseline levels as determined by local surveillance systems until mid-January 2012 in the Pittsburgh region; hence, study enrollment began in January and ended in April 2012. This prospective study was approved by the University of Pittsburgh Institutional Review Board.",

Only single viruses or virus groups that were detected in more than 20 samples were used in the analyses, with the final six groups being: no virus detected, HRV, CoV, RSV, hMPV, and influenza virus type A. The measurement of agreement between the singleplex and multiplex influenza assays was determined using Cohen's kappa statistic. Descriptive statistics are presented as means and standard deviations for continuous variables and percentages for discrete variables. Participants were divided into three age groupschildren (6 months-17 years), young adults (18-49 years) , and older adults (\u226550 years). Bivariate multinomial regression models were used to assess the association of patient characteristics with the results of the MRT-PCRs because the probability distribution of the outcome variable consisted of more than two groups. The dependent variable is the virus group, and the independent variables are the participants' personal characteristics. To determine the independent effect, multinomial regression models were fit for each variable controlling for age and selfreported health status, with no virus detected as the reference group. For discrete characteristics with more than two levels that were statistically significant in the adjusted analysis, pairwise multinomial regression models were fit to assess the association of each level; Bonferroni corrections were used to adjust for multiple comparisons. Because the overall effect of age group was significant (P = 0\u00c101) in some analyses, pairwise comparisons between the different age groups were conducted to determine which pair of age groups had an effect on the dependent variable.

The distribution of single virus infections and co-detections are shown in Table 1 , with the numbers for co-detections representing viruses detected, not numbers of patients.

            "text": "Co-detected viruses may represent either two clinically significant infections or one infection significant enough to lead to a medical visit and a second clinically insignificant/ asymptomatic infection. Co-infections with certain viruses may increase the severity of some respiratory infections with the possibility that specific pairings of viruses may determine symptoms and duration of illness. 9 Recent research suggests that certain co-occurrences depend upon the co-infecting viruses. For example, Greer et al. reported a negative association between HRV and co-infections with ADNO, CoV, hMPV, RSV, and influenza, among others, 10 while Martin et al. reported a similar negative relationship between HRV and RSV. 8 Conversely, Tanner et al. reported a significant positive relationship between HRV and RSV, but reported negative associations between influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 and hMPV and RSV. 11 In our study, HRV was the most frequently occurring single virus and was also the most frequent co-detected virus. The associations between viral infections and demographic and symptom variables were not unexpected. For instance, hMPV, RSV, and influenza are more common among young children and older adults 12 than among younger adults. Fever is a common symptom for both hMPV and influenza. 13 We found higher BMI to be associated with influenza infection leading to ARI. Previous research has found changes in certain immune functions, and less robust immune response to vaccines is related to increased body weight, 14 and obese patients frequently experience worse outcomes related to infectious diseases than their thinner counterparts. 15 Talbot et al. reported a positive association between obesity and seroconversion against the H3N2 component of influenza vaccine, but not against the H1N1 or B strains, 16 but found no relationship between obesity and seroprotection against any influenza strain tested. The specific mechanism for higher influenza disease rates among those with higher BMIs is unclear.",

However, the sample size was sufficient to allow confidence in the relationships between characteristics of ARI cases and the viruses associated with them during this time period.
