Within the European Union (EU), public health priorities in this area include antimicrobial resistance (AMR), vaccine preventable diseases, tuberculosis, influenza, and sexually transmitted infections (3, 4) . Addressing this challenge, the key role of clinical microbiologists (CMs) in improving appropriate use of antimicrobials in human medicine has been reaffirmed, notably by ensuring timely production and communication of critical diagnostic results and standardized drug susceptibility testing reports in accordance with local treatment guidelines (5) . The provision of facility-specific cumulative susceptibility reports for bacterial pathogens against antibiotics on the formulary also forms an essential part of CM work. Additionally, CMs provide daily counseling to clinicians on etiological infection diagnoses and management, including correct sampling for and interpretation of test results, and targeted therapy of difficult-to-treat resistant pathogens and complicated infections. As members of the hospital antimicrobial stewardship team, CMs take on responsibilities that include coordination, planning of infection control activities, post-prescription review, and feedback (6, 7) . Hence, CM and clinical microbiology laboratories (CMLs) demonstrate their ability to (i) inform and improve individual patient care, (ii) contribute to outbreak management and hospital infection control, and (iii) provide accurate surveillance data on infectious diseases and AMR. This information can be subsequently used in the review of local treatment guidelines and the design and evaluation of national health policies (8) .",

The challenge is to simultaneously address the demand for detection and characterization of unusual or exotic pathogens, drug resistance, or virulence traits as appropriate, and meeting the requirement for health-care cost containment and financial efficiency. In this perspective, a number of high profile microbiology services consolidations have already taken place in the private sector over the last decade: An effective approach includes the creation of task-specific teams representing multiple skills built around infectious diseases specialists and CMs. The need for an increase in professional diversity sometimes contradicts the established specialty training and certification pathways and creates complexities with regard to the required staffing structure and laboratory organization. In general, the utilization of cross-disciplinary teams forced the move in the direction of a flatter hierarchical structure within healthcare organizations (16) (17) (18) .",

However, the effectiveness of such interactions is highly dependent on the ability for a correct understanding and interpretation of the message. Regular telephone calls (anchored by less frequent face-to-face meetings) are still considered effective as they allow for immediacy and a two-way dialog and opinion exchange (22, 23) . Clinicians often emphasize the input resulting from the physical presence of CMs on ward rounds as ensuring a strong professional interaction with staff and the understanding of new technological diagnostic options, emerging pathogens or drug resistance mechanisms and local epidemiological trends (24, 25) . In terms of education, maintaining the physical presence of CM on satellite clinical sites contributes to the continuing education of staff at those sites. The validation of results from the satellite laboratory owing to a telemicrobiology system is a promising solution making it possible to maintain the physical presence of a microbiologist at distant sites and ensure the satellite lab functions efficiently (26) . Nevertheless, telemicrobiology requires efficient communication between teams located in satellite and central labs and a reliable IT department to manage potential connectivity dysfunctions.",

This wide variation supports the argument that further consolidation in CMLs within Europe remains possible. Consolidation frequently results in the adoption of 24/7 working patterns and increased automation, while microbiological services increasingly integrate within wider laboratory services where infectious serology and now molecular testing are often processed by biochemists in a general core-laboratory (28) . Consequently, clinical microbiology analysis progressively moves toward an organization relying on different analytical platforms operated independently from the discipline or type of pathogen considered. External linkage to allow collaboration and systematic referral of specimens for further characterization and data to national reference laboratories (NRLs) with a public health mandate is essential. Furthermore, communication and collaboration with food safety, water quality, and environmental laboratories are also playing an important role in a public health microbiology network at national level within the One Health context (29) . The relationships between different laboratory structures constituent within a regional clinical microbiology network are summarized in Figure 1 .",

A potential paradigm shift for core laboratories in the implementation of innovative technologies at high-throughput testing volumes is the widespread deployment of molecular diagnostics in both distal and centralized laboratories. Near-patient testing would include so-called 1-to 2-h \"plug-and-play\" nucleic acid amplification tests for which a rapid result can directly impact patient care. More-complex/high-volume tests would be dispatched to a core facility. An indicative list of tests that can be performed at peripheral CMLs is shown in Table S1 in Supplementary Material. However, each hospital presenting its own specificity, the stakeholder input in the processing priorities, definition of ideal turnaround times and adequate format of test result reports is central to the success of the consolidation process.",

In some studies, it was shown that the delay in administering the modified treatment was high (>4 h in ap. 50% of cases), suggesting that communication between health professionals can improve further (39) .

The use of high-throughput whole genome sequencing (WGS) platforms available in large CMLs forms an additional advantage. Outsourced WGS analysis of human pathogens has been recently shown to be portable across countries for supporting multi-state outbreak investigations (49) . The availability of sequence-based microbial typing and detection brings about a fundamental change in the sharing of laboratory data, handled and used for medical and public health purposes. Comparative genomic approaches are high-throughput and data-rich and, therefore, create systematic stresses in the collection, analyses, storage, and responsible handling of the generated data.

            "text": "The inadvertent increase in volume in clinical microbiological testing has created a substantial and continuous market-driven need for the implementation of high-throughput analytical systems. A number of high profile translational research initiatives (100,000 Genomes Project, UK; the Precision Medicine Initiative, USA; and others globally) are meant to support the eventual technological transfer of high-throughput analytical approaches from research into the CML (52, 53) . A characteristic example is the introduction of WGS capabilities into routine health care, which can now support a clinically relevant sample processing turnaround (54) and the high diagnostic granularity needed in complex clinical cases (55) . The speed, size, and cost of the equipment has decreased, making the required upfront capital investment by health-care institutions feasible. At the same time, the decrease in the per base cost of sequencing has reduced by 92% from 0.52 to 0.04 USD per DNA Mb (National Human Genome Research Institute, January 2010-January 2015) (56) , supporting that operational cost savings can be used to offset the initial capital investment. However, a current bottleneck in the wider adoption of these initiatives is the data analysis and diagnostic interpretation processes which have to be certified, validated, and broadly accepted to be performed routinely and across centers. Consolidated laboratories may help to assess the clinical impact of such new advances by providing the accredited benchmark against which the new methods will be compared (57, 58) . A similar approach can be taken for the \"lab-on-a-chip\" methods (59) .",

It would be particularly interesting to explore the impact of this new model on the wider quality and efficiency of health services, correlating with patient outcome metrics, such as length of hospital stay, mortality, and readmission rates. This broader health system view should include the impact on the clinical management in clinical fields that require significant laboratory input. This suggests the need for more complex studies, not just assessing assay performance for example, but rather entire process performances including the time, expertise and costs both of reporting results and of downstream clinical actions. Beyond the clinical care impact, CMLs also provide key information outputs for the protection of population health, which need to be assessed. In this perspective, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and microbiology experts designed and implemented the EULabCap monitoring system of national public health microbiology performance indicators toward ensuring sufficient capabilities at clinical and reference laboratory levels for wellinformed infectious disease prevention and control actions (60) .",

The inherent systemic flexibility that is necessary to receive different types of data at different speeds and from different locations-and link all that to routinely collected clinical data and report back-is not an insignificant task by itself. A number of questions are raised regarding the new pathways that might be necessary, the different regulatory approaches within Europe to handling this data under the EU personal data protection directives, and data quality issues (46) . The ethical implications of big data analysis (BDA) have not been fully explored. In a recent review, Garattini et al. discussed the ethical implication of BDA in terms of loss of individual autonomy and erosion of freedom of choice in response to population-level benefits. If not correctly addressed by the inclusion of ethical design in the creation of big data, such ethical issues might become limiting factors preventing BDA from reaching its full potential (46) . The significant role of the CML networks should not be underestimated in the sharing of routine clinical metadata or data collected. Their potential integration into a common data set (biorepositories-as proposed by the Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium) (61) would maximize the opportunities for patient contributions to be translated into therapeutic and diagnostic solutions. The consolidation process for example provides a tangible opportunity to extend the scope of pooled analyses of individual patient biomarker data from heterogeneous laboratory platforms and cohorts into population-level studies using merging algorithms (62) . At a population level, CML networks can actively support ongoing surveillance, e.g., on AMR, and can add value by connecting some or all of these data (under appropriate management and regulatory structures) to national public health surveillance systems or international networks, such as EARS-Net or the Global Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System (GLASS), recently launched by the World Health Organization (63, 64) .",

It was expected that this trend of CML consolidation would expand to larger academic health-care providers, such as the Karolinska University Hospital merger in Stockholm (2005-2008); the Charit\u00e9 Hospitals mergers in Berlin (2003); or the multi-faceted mergers led by the Royal Free London and University College London Hospitals forming UCL Partners (UCLP, 2005 onward). Due to the projected cost efficiencies and anticipated health-care improvements, regional or local authorities support such consolidation initiatives often in partnership with the academic sector. The laboratory network of the Assistance Publique-H\u00f4pitaux de Paris (AP-HP) or the recent (2015) launch of the University Laboratory of Brussels (LHUB-ULB) are representative examples.",
