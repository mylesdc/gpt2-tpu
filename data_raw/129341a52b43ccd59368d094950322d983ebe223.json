The role of S100A12 in parasite and viral infections is also difficult to study in traditional animal models due to the lack of S100A12 expression in rodents. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate fecal S100A12 concentrations in a cohort of puppies with intestinal parasites (Cystoisospora spp., Toxocara canis, Giardia sp.) and viral agents that are frequently encountered and known to cause gastrointestinal signs in dogs (coronavirus, parvovirus) as a comparative model. Methods: Spot fecal samples were collected from 307 puppies [median age (range): 7 (4\u221213) weeks; 29 different breeds] in French breeding kennels, and fecal scores (semiquantitative system; scores 1\u221213) were assigned. Fecal samples were tested for Cystoisospora spp. (C. canis and C. ohioensis), Toxocara canis, Giardia sp., as well as canine coronavirus (CCV) and parvovirus (CPV). S100A12 concentrations were measured in all fecal samples using an inhouse radioimmunoassay. Statistical analyses were performed using non-parametric 2-group or multiple-group comparisons, non-parametric correlation analysis, association testing between nominal variables, and construction of a multivariate mixed model. Results: Fecal S100A12 concentrations ranged from < 24\u221214,363 ng/g. Univariate analysis only showed increased fecal S100A12 concentrations in dogs shedding Cystoisospora spp. (P = 0.0384) and in dogs infected with parvovirus (P = 0.0277), whereas dogs infected with coronavirus had decreased fecal S100A12 concentrations (P = 0.0345). However, shedding of any single enteropathogen did not affect fecal S100A12 concentrations in multivariate analysis (all P > 0.05) in this study. Only fecal score and breed size had an effect on fecal S100A12 concentrations in multivariate analysis (P < 0.0001).",

Extracellular S100A12 has cytokine-like effects and functions as a phagocyte-specific danger-associated molecule (alarmin), with a central role in immune responses [9] . S100A12 plays a role in host defense against microorganisms and parasites [10] by sequestering essential trace elements such as Cu 2+ [3] , and the protein also has chemotactic properties especially for monocytes and mast cells [6, 11, 12] . S100A12 has also been suggested to counteract tissue damage by competing with matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) for Zn 2+ -binding [13] . The S100A12 protein is a ligand for the pattern recognition receptor RAGE (receptor for advanced glycation end products) and activates the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) pathway [6, 14] , a mechanism linked to the pathogenesis of autoimmune disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in humans [6, 15, 16] .",

Recent studies suggest that fecal S100A12 concentrations may also be clinically useful as a biomarker of inflammation in dogs [18, 19] . In dogs with chronic idiopathic gastrointestinal inflammation (IBD), fecal canine S100A12 concentrations were increased and correlated with the severity of clinical disease, endoscopic changes observed in the intestine and the severity of histologic lesions in the colon [18] . Higher fecal S100A12 concentrations were also shown to be associated with a negative outcome in dogs with IBD [19] .

Based on the literature available [10, 17, 20] , we hypothesized that infections with enteric parasites -but not enteropathogenic viruses -are associated with increased fecal canine S100A12 concentrations, and that these etiologies need to be ruled out when using fecal S100A12 as a biomarker in dogs with IBD. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the presence and numbers of selected endoparasites and viral agents that are frequently encountered and known to cause gastrointestinal signs in dogs on fecal canine S100A12 concentrations in a large cohort of puppies. Because biomarkers can be affected by patient physiological factors such as age, sex, or size [23] , the effect of these parameters was also evaluated.",

P-values in bold font indicate a significant effect (P < 0. fecal S100A12 is affected by the fecal score which reflects the overall health of the digestive tract. This is important for further studies evaluating fecal S100A12 concentrations in patients with suspected chronic gastrointestinal inflammation [27] . These findings are consistent with the results of a previous investigation in asymptomatic children showing fecal S100A12 concentrations to only have a tendency to be increased with concurrent Giardia duodenalis and helminth infections [20] . Also, the concentrations of fecal S100A12 measured in the study by Garz\u00f3n et al. [20] were comparable to those concentrations detected in our study. Our results further agree with a previous study in adult people revealing no differences in fecal S100A12 concentrations in patients with viral gastroenteritis caused by Norwalklike virus or rotavirus [17] . No difference in fecal S100A12 concentrations were detected between puppies testing positive for enteropathogens (except for Cystoisospora spp., CCV and CPV2 in univariate analysis) and those dogs testing negative in this study. This was still an unexpected finding given that S100A12 has been shown to have filariostatic or filaricidal properties (anti-parasite mechanism) through its binding to parasite paramyosin [10, 28] and the fact that S100A12 can be expressed in eosinophils in humans [29] . However, though endoparasites are more likely to be associated with eosinophilic or mixed inflammation [30] , whether S100A12 expression in eosinophils is also induced or up-regulated in the context of inflammation in dogs has not been investigated. Also, experimental infection in cattle with Echinococcus granulosus was associated with a strong S100A12 response [31] . However, infection with E. granulosus results in a more granulomatous type of inflammation although other cells were also shown to express S100A12 at the site of infection-associated inflammation. These findings further suggest that limiting the availability of transition metal ions (i.e. Ca 2+ , Zn 2+ and Mn 2+ ) is not the Table 2 Evaluation of patient characteristics, opportunistic pathogen shedding, and fecal S100A12 concentrations in dogs included in this study (n = 307).

Though not demonstrated for S100A12, antimicrobial activity against E. coli has been shown for canine calprotectin [33] . Correlation of fecal S100A12 concentrations with only the fecal score and breed size suggests that fecal S100A12 concentrations are not primarily influenced by any single endoparasite or viral pathogen that were evaluated in this study. However, diarrhea in puppies is often multifactorial [24] and other factors that can influence the fecal score (e.g. stress, diet change, or other environmental factors) may also affect fecal S100A12 concentrations in dogs. The effect of dietary factors (e.g. diet type, feeding practices, dietary supplements, amount of milk ingested by suckling) on fecal S100A12 concentrations could not be evaluated in this study due to the large variety of these factors and the fact that the quantity of milk ingested cannot be determined. However, the association between fecal score and fecal S100A12 concentrations could also reflect an infection with another enteropathogen or enteropathogens for which puppies in this study were not evaluated. Small breed size was another significant factor for having an increased fecal S100A12 concentration in this study. Contrary to this, large breed size has been previously shown to be a determinant of lower fecal consistency [25] , and this variable had been taken into account when interpreting fecal scores (normal/abnormal) in this study. Thus, one possible explanation for small breed dogs having a higher frequency of abnormal stools in this study could be an undetected infectious cause or environmental factors. However, lack of an ability of the 13-point scoring system [25] to sufficiently differentiate fecal qualities may also explain this finding, though this scoring system has been validated for use in puppies and appears to be superior to the 5point system [34] that is often used to differentiate fecal qualities. The relationship between fecal S100A12 concentrations, fecal score, and breed size as well as its clinical implication, and whether the current results also translate to those in adult dogs, warrants further research.",

Hence, age was also evaluated as a potential influencing factor as an age-related effect has been demonstrated for fecal calprotectin concentrations (another S100/calgranulin protein complex) in dogs [24] . In contrast to fecal calprotectin, age did not have an effect on fecal S100A12 concentrations in dogs, similar to previous findings in older puppies and adult dogs [26] . The reason for this difference between fecal calprotectin and fecal S100A12 is unknown. Possible explanations could be that S100A12 leakage into the still maturing gastrointestinal tract is negligible and that S100A12 production may be more specific to cells of the inflammatory response compared to calprotectin.

            "text": "We acknowledge that this study has some limitations. First, the small sample size in the analyses of subgroups of dogs carries the potential for type II error. Secondly, spot fecal samples were used for the detection of enteropathogens and also for measuring fecal S100A12 concentrations, but the biological variation and distribution of these enteropathogens and the S100A12 protein in fecal specimens in healthy dogs and dogs with gastrointestinal disease has not yet been reported. Lastly, histopathologic evaluation of gastrointestinal mucosal biopsies to determine whether enteropathogen shedding, a decreased fecal score, or both are associated with any clinically relevant mucosal lesions (i.e. quality and severity of inflammation) was not performed in the dogs in this study.",

Thus, the presence of any one of these endoparasites or viral agents appears to be an unlikely cause of altered fecal S100A12 concentrations, but the fecal score as an indicator of the overall digestive health is reflected by the fecal S100A12 concentration. These preliminary data are an important starting point for further studies evaluating fecal S100A12 concentrations in dogs or when using fecal S100A12 concentrations as a biomarker in patients with chronic idiopathic gastrointestinal inflammation. In addition, the dog could be considered as an alternative model for studying S100A12 biology in humans.",
