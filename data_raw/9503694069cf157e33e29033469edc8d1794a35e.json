            "text": "Experimental evidence shows that synonymous mutations can have important consequences on genetic fitness. Many organisms display codon usage bias (CUB), where synonymous codons that are translated into the same amino acid appear with distinct frequency. Within genomes, CUB is thought to arise from selection for translational efficiency and accuracy, termed the translational efficiency hypothesis (TEH). Indeed, CUB indices correlate with protein expression levels, which is widely interpreted as evidence for translational selection. However, these tests neglect -1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting (-1 PRF), an important translational disruption effect found across all organisms of the tree of life. Genes that contain -1 PRF signals should cost more to express than genes without. Thus, CUB indices that do not consider -1 PRF may overestimate genes' true adaptation to translational efficiency and accuracy constraints. Here, we first investigate whether -1 PRF signals do indeed carry such translational cost. We then propose two corrections for CUB indices for genes containing -1 PRF signals. We retest the TEH in Saccharomyces cerevisiae under these corrections. We find that the correlation between corrected CUB index and protein expression remains intact for most levels of uniform -1 PRF efficiencies, and tends to increase when these efficiencies decline with protein expression. We conclude that the TEH is strengthened and that -1 PRF events constitute a promising and useful tool to examine the relationships between CUB and selection for translation efficiency and accuracy.",

Programmed ribosomal frameshifting is a process by which ribosomal translation of an mRNA sequence is induced to stall at specific sites, termed slippery sites, which leads to a rearrangement of the ribosome on the mRNA sequence (Plant and Dinman 2006; Caliskan et al. 2015) . Translation then proceeds in a new frame that is shifted relative to the original open reading frame (ORF) (Belew and Dinman 2015) .

By opening a new reading frame, the -1 PRF mechanism allows for dual coding. This function is exemplified in the gag-pol gene overlap appearing in many retroviruses (Jacks and Varmus 1985) , in particular human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (Brierley and Dos Ramos 2006) . In these viruses, the appropriate proportion of gag vs. pol protein expression is regulated by a -1 PRF signal (Maia et al. 1996; Dulude et al. 2006; Brierley and Dos Ramos 2006) . In eukaryotes, -1 PRF is predominantly \u00f0 . 99%\u00de used for gene expression regulation (Plant et al. 2004; Advani and Dinman 2016) . About 10% of genes in yeast are hypothesized to contain functional slippery sites (Belew et al. 2008) . Ribosomes redirected to -1 shifted frames majorly encounter premature termination codons (PTC), that is, stop codons that appear well before the poly-A tails of mRNA sequences (Advani and Dinman 2016) . This typically triggers the activation of the nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) pathway (Chang et al. 2007 ). The NMD pathway induces the degradation of both the mRNA, as well as of the partly assembled protein, while leaving the ribosome intact (Advani and Dinman 2016) . Thus, -1 PRF acts as an NMD-mediated destabilizing element of mRNA (Belew et al. 2011 (Belew et al. , 2014 Advani et al. 2013 ). -1 PRF efficiency appears to be controlled by sequence specific elements, such as miRNA (Belew et al. 2014 ), but can be uniformly affected across all PRF-harboring genes by mutations as well as drugs (Advani et al. 2013) .",

We draw from PRFdb, a database of predicted -1 PRF signals in the Saccharomyce cerevisiae genome (Belew et al. 2008) . First, we devise a series of hypotheses for how -1 PRF signals are influenced by evolutionary pressures. In accordance with our hypotheses, we find evidence for the existence of a cost of -1 PRF mechanism maintenance. Second, we devise general corrections for any codon usage bias index of mRNA containing -1 PRF signals. We use sequences from PRFdb to compute the new, corrected codon bias indices, and compare them to uncorrected values. We find that the TEH is robust against these corrections and strengthened under biologically plausible assumptions of a -1 PRF dependency on protein expression. We conclude that the -1 PRF signals offer untapped potential to analyze translation efficiency in mRNA.",

For a slippery site to be found, a confluence of signals in mRNA is required. First, a site must match the pattern (X XXY YYZ), where X is some base, Y is either A or U, and Z is A, C or U. Second, a spacer sequence of a minimum of 8 nucleotides in length needs to exist between the slippery site and the following pseudoknot. Third, a pseudoknot predicted by minimum free energy values of the mRNA secondary structure is expected downstream the slippery site. The dataset also included a full list of gene annotations, accession numbers, the relative position of the slippery sites within the gene in which they were found, as well as the gene mRNA. For each slippery site, we computed were premature stop codons first appear downstream. With this, we computed the frameshifted sequences.",

This ratio has been used as a measure for translation efficiency in past studies (Tuller et al. 2010) . To formulate the first hypothesis, we conduct a thought experiment. Let us assume that an organism's environmental conditions favor lower expression of a protein from a -1 PRF-gene. Then, increasing the average p in that gene will adapt the organism to the new conditions. Conversely, if such environmental changes demanded higher protein expression, genes containing -1 PRF signals may adapt by reducing p. If protein demands exceed the production capacity of a gene with very small p, the -1 PRF mechanism may offer only costs, but no benefits from protein regulation. Then, mutations that remove the heptameric slippery site signature will be selected for. Taken together, these effects imply an asymmetry in the probability of slippery site loss depending on the direction of protein demand changes. Losses of slippery sites are likelier when protein demands increase than when they decrease. -1 PRF signals should thus become rarer with increasing protein expression levels.",

This is because for fixed p, increasing expression levels should mirror an increase in -1 PRF induced translation costs. Thus, the benefits of slippery sites closer to translation-initiation positions should increase with expression levels. As in the second hypothesis, selection for such an effect is likely to be very weak compared to effects in the first hypothesis. Figure 2 shows the results of testing all three hypotheses. Figure 2A shows that -1 PRF signals in genes become rarer with gene expression, consistent with our first hypothesis. Figure 2B shows that slippery sites positions are more prevalent in the first half of a gene than in the second, consistent with our second hypothesis. The frequency of slippery sites diminishes toward both extremes of mRNA sequences, and more markedly so toward the stop codon of the mRNA. This skew persists when including all genes from the PRFdb (see Figure S2 ). Figure 2C shows that the average slippery site position is displaced toward the 59 end of the mRNA as protein expression levels increase from 10 2 molecules per cell to 10 5 molecules per cell. Above 10 5 molecules per cell, the uncertainty around the averages becomes large due to low sample sizes, and unambiguous deductions become impossible. The decreasing trend in the average l=L with protein expression is confirmed by a linear regression. Lastly, we retested all of the hypotheses with an alternative integrated data set from PaxDB, and obtained the same results (see Figure S3 ). Thus, with increasing demand for protein production, the data suggest that production gains will primarily be attained by disposing of the -1 PRF mechanism present in a gene, rather than minimizing the cost of faulty translation. We speculate that, most likely, this occurs by altering the slippery site sequence. The test of the other two hypotheses involving slippery site displacement (or loss of large-l slippery sites) provide further evidence for an intrinsic -1 PRF cost to translation. The selective pressure on this latter adaptive process appears to be weak.",

However, given a functional slippery site in that same mRNA sequence, the interpretation changes (see Figure 3B ). Let us assume an average -1 PRF efficiency p. Then, a fraction p of the times in which a ribosome is in the process of translating a specific mRNA, it will be redirected to another frame by -1 PRF. This redirection leads to degradation of the mRNA. Thus, the production of the same number of proteins will require more energy and time in the presence of a -1 PRF signal than it would in its absence. However, traditional CUB indices will give no indication of that process. If accounted for, -1 PRF must therefore lead to a downward correction of the mRNA's translational efficiency and with it, of the associated CUB index.",

We define the efficiency of the protein synthetisation process as the energy content of the proteins (the nominator) divided by the energy expended by the mRNA transcription and translation processes (the denominator) (Tuller et al. 2010) . The value of a codon usage bias index should reflect the efficiency of the protein synthesis process under the TEH. B) The same mRNA considering a slippery site (green point). The slippery site redirects ribosomes to a -1 shifted frame, where they encounter premature termination codons (PTC). The same number of proteins are produced as in A). An additional cost, unaccounted for in A), is incurred for protein production due to NMD-mediated protein decay.

We have found no evidence that the value of p is dependent on any characteristic of mRNA, such as its length, or codon composition (Chang et al. 2007; Dinman, 2012b) . NMD is an evolutionarily conserved surveillance pathway (Chang et al. 2007 ). Its activation may thus differ in energy expenditure between organisms (indeed, in yeast, NMD does not require an exon-junction complex, unlike most other eukaryotes). However, we have found no indication that the energy required to fully complete the NMD process will substantially vary from mRNA to mRNA within an organism. Thus, we assume that p is uniform across genes, although we do not know how large it is relative to other energy inputs.

Instead, they allow us to reexamine the association between protein expression and a corrected codon usage bias index that in part underpins the TEH.

We devised three hypotheses for likely signals of such cost in -1 PRF carrying genes. We could not find contradictory evidence for any of those hypotheses in the data. In a second step, we explored whether these costs, if not accounted for, bias important measures of CUB. We devised two new general approaches to correct CUB indices for the presence of -1 PRF signals. We then tested whether the concealment of such costs may unduly influence, falsify or strengthen, one classical test of the translational efficiency hypothesis: the association of CUB indices with protein expression levels. Under the assumption of uniform -1 PRF efficiencies, the energetic costs related with NMD activation would need to be implausibly high to warrant this conclusion. We find that on the contrary, assuming that -1 PRF efficiency decreases with protein expression levels -as suggested by the existence of a cost to -1 PRF-, the TEH is strengthened. Thus, taken together, our results suggests that high organismal demands for specific proteins are reflected in CUB-mediated translation efficiency gains.",

A first caveat of this study lies in that the slippery sites are inferred (utilizing the Nupack algorithm (Dirks and Pierce 2004) for mRNA pseudoknot detection), but not always experimentally confirmed (Advani et al. 2013) . Previous studies suggest that inferred slippery sites are likely to be functional. In (Advani et al. 2013) it is reported that in previous work, nine out of nine high confidence -1 PRF sites detected by methods used in the PRFdb in S. cerevisae were confirmed to be functional in vivo. Crucially, whether a -1 PRF site is regarded to be functional depends on whether it exceeds a predetermined p-threshold. For example, in (Advani et al. 2013 ), a search of -1 PRF slippery sites identified 10 candidate genes in EST2, three in EST1, 2 in STN, and 1 in CDC in mRNA involved in telomerase. Out of these, and employing a cutoff of 1% for -1 PRF efficiency, seven carry functional slippery sites (EST2: 3, EST1: 2, STN: 1, CDC: 1) (see (Advani et al. 2013) , Table 1 ). Had a cutoff of 0% -1 PRF efficiency been employed, all slippery sites except one would be functional.

Note that these effects should arise from mechanisms that are independent of the ones studied here. Again, we are unaware of any such mechanisms acting in yeast, except for the requirement of a spacer sequence. A spacer sequence of a minimum length of say, 8 nt, will prohibit slippery sites to be located within 8 nt of the mRNA end.

However, it is also possible that there exist cases in which -1 PRF has important functions in highly expressed genes. Hence, although there are fewer slippery sites for highly expressed genes and they are costly in terms of translation efficiencies, these sites could have large -1 PRF efficiencies.

Thus, the claim that corrected CUB indices will leave the basis for the TEH unaffected is resistant to such a bias. Another key assumption is that CUB indices of an mRNA sequence should increase monotonically with translation efficiency. In practice, this association is surely not perfect, due to multiple additional influences on CUB from unrelated biological processes. For these processes to systematically bias our results they should i) dominate over translational efficiency effects or ii) result in directional effects when combined. Despite these possible shortcomings, the assumption reflects key properties with which many CUB indices are designed, namely to mirror translational efficiency.

            "text": "These results have to be interpreted in the context of current codon usage bias research. The mechanism of translational selection (TEH) remains the main explanation put forward for selection based origins of codon bias. This explanation presupposes that silent mutations affect fitness via translation processes. These fitness increases originate from translation efficiency and accuracy gains, that in turn are hypothesized to stem from translation initiation and elongation processes. In fact, mRNA elongation rates do indeed appear to correlate positively with preferred codon frequencies (Gustafsson et al. 2004) , although better evidence would be desirable. However, for initiation processes -which are assumed to contribute the bulk of these fitness increases-, the effects of CUB on initiation rate increase remain subject of debate (Quax et al. 2015) . In fact, Tuller and Zur have analyzed the effect of the structure of the 59 end of an mRNA on translation initiation and elongation rates and found various regulatory signals that affect these rates in different ways (Tuller and Zur 2015) .",

However, current research efforts aiming to identify the exact mechanisms that give rise to these associations must account for conflating selective forces. Indeed, the mechanisms laid out in the TEH may not be the only way in which selection shapes codon usage frequencies. For example, besides the abundance of tRNAs, other factors have been discovered to crucially affect elongation rates and hence, to be possible targets selection Resch et al. 2007 Resch et al. , 2009 Hunt et al. 2009 ). More precisely, specific synonymous changes can influence mRNA splicing, mRNA secondary structure, protein stability as well as protein folding (Komar 2009; Chamary et al. 2006; Carlini and Genut 2006; Parmley et al. 2006; Tsai et al. 2008; Komar 2007) . Synonymous changes may also alter the secondary structure of mRNA and thus affect the rate of translation -as established in vitro (Ivanov et al. 1997; Parmley and Hurst 2007; Tuller and Zur 2015) and subsequently in vivo (Kimchi-Sarfaty et al. 2007) . A comprehensive review on how protein expression is fine tuned by codon usage bias is given by Quax (Quax et al. 2015) . Further, in a very recent study, a synonymous difference between mammalian cytoskeletal band g-actin proteins was found to affect co-translational processing, ubiquitination, and co-translational degradation, leading to differential stability properties of the corresponding protein products (Zhang et al. 2010) .",

Some codons are more abundant in genes depending on their function, displaying distinct codon bias patterns. Supek has reviewed how gene function modifies codon preferences (Supek 2016) . Selective pressure to maintain (or alter) gene function is superimposed to what is expected from translational efficiency and accuracy optimization. Genes where altered CUB patterns have been found are involved in diverse functions: amino acid starvation responses, cyclical protein expression, tissue specific expression, cellular differentiation, stress responses, and carcinogenesis. While genes can differ in function, there are also differences in function within a gene's sequence that also affect local CUB. For example, Tuller and Zur have surveyed the multiple roles of the 59 end of coding sequences in gene expression regulation (Tuller and Zur 2015) . They hypothesize that due to multitude of regulatory signals found in that region, selection pressures regarding codon utilization are likely different than in other regions. Unlike cross-gene function, such effects are local, which should not affect our analysis. How effects from gene function may affect our results, crucially depends on their frequency and direction. The literature reviewed here does not appear to warrant the assumption that all the function-dependent selective pressures will align to influence CUB in the same way, leading to systematic bias. The phenomenon of -1 PRF is thus only one of many ways in which CUB may be influenced.",

Because slippery sites are precisely localized and -1 PRF efficiencies measurable, -1 PRF signals constitute natural experiments to translation efficiency and accuracy theories. This is because the separation of the mRNA by a slippery site should create differential translational costs across that mRNA. This translational cost gradient should be reflected in codon usage bias differences. -1 PRF based approaches to analyzing codon usage bias behavior, like the one presented in this study, may thus offer novel tools to better understand the means by which translation efficiency gains are realized in nature.",
