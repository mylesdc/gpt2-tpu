            "text": "Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) presents an emerging threat to public health worldwide by causing severe respiratory disease in humans with high virulence and case fatality rate (about 35%) since 2012. Little is known about the pathogenesis and innate antiviral response in primary human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) and dendritic cells (MDDCs) upon MERS-CoV infection. In this study, we assessed MERS-CoV replication as well as induction of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in MDMs and immature and mature MDDCs. Immature MDDCs and MDMs were permissive for MERS-CoV infection, while mature MDDCs were not, with stimulation of proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine upregulation in MDMs, but not in MDDCs. To further evaluate the antiviral activity of well-defined drugs in primary antigen presenting cells (APCs), three compounds (chloroquine, chlorpromazine and toremifine), each with broad-spectrum antiviral activity in immortalized cell lines, were evaluated in MDMs and MDDCs to determine their antiviral effect on MERS-CoV infection. While chloroquine was not active in these primary cells, chlorpromazine showed strong anti-MERS-CoV activity, but it was associated with high cytotoxicity narrowing the potential window for drug utilization. Unlike in established cells, toremifene had marginal activity when tested in antigen presenting cells, with high apparent cytotoxicity, also limiting its potential as a therapeutic option. These results demonstrate the value of testing drugs in primary cells, in addition to established cell lines, before initiating preclinical or clinical studies for MERS treatment and the importance of carefully assessing cytotoxicity in drug screen assays. Furthermore, these studies also highlight the role of APCs in stimulating a robust protective immune response to MERS-CoV infection.",

Since that time, the virus has caused sporadic outbreaks of mild-to-severe respiratory disease. Approximately 80% of human cases have been reported in Saudi Arabia with 211 cases occurring in the first 9 months of 2017 [3] . Beginning in May 2015, a large hospital-associated outbreak of MERS occurred in the Republic of Korea. The outbreak in Korea resulted in a total of 186 MERS-CoV cases, including 36 deaths, and was the largest outbreak of MERS occurring outside of the Arabian Peninsula [4] . This outbreak highlighted the risk of international dissemination of MERS-CoV and the continued risk of nosocomial infection. As of September 6, 2017, the number of confirmed global cases of MERS-CoV infection reported to World Health Organization was 2079 cases in 27 countries with 722 fatalities, resulting in a case fatality rate around 35% [3] .",

The second objective was to determine if these cells were suitable or appropriate for secondary screens for drugs that have been identified as effective in continuous culture cell lines. Macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) are professional APCs linking innate and adaptive immunity. These and other APCs act as a first defense against viral infection by stimulating immune surveillance, priming, and tolerance [10, 11] . Appropriately functioning APCs are critical for the ability to mitigate infection and limit the development of disease. APCs are abundant in the respiratory tract where they provide immune surveillance and respond to local tissue inflammation in the airways and the distal lung. An important role of APCs is mitigating infection by producing cytokines that stimulate an inflammatory response and recruiting memory and effector cells to the site of infection [12] . Professional APCs are also an important source of type I interferons (IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2). Type I IFNs have a significant bystander effect on uninfected neighboring cells by inducing an antiviral state, activating innate immune cells, and priming adaptive immunity.",

In MDMs, MERS-CoV infection resulted in increased concentrations of almost all antiviral or proinflammatory cytokines and most chemokines (except MCP-1), many of these cytokines or chemokines were released as soon as 1 h pi ( Fig 3A) and may have been the result of direct cell stimulation rather than active infection. The high induction of IFN-\u03b3, and IP-10 over the course of the infection in MDMs was dramatic, indicating a very strong antiviral response was induced upon MERS-CoV infection. MERS-CoV infection repressed IL-6 expression from MDM and this repression decreased over the course of several days ( Fig 3A) with a similar response profile seen with chemokines MIP-1\u03b1 and MCP-1. Increased MIP-1\u03b1 and IP-10 expression was observed in immature MDDCs (Fig 3B) . However, other than a bolus of IFN-\u03b3 released immediately after the infection of MDDC, the release of most of the cytokines or chemokines from immature and mature MDDCs were negligible over the course of the MERS-CoV infection relative to mock-infected cells (Fig 3B and 3C) .

Therefore, the efficacy of the candidate compounds on MERS-CoV-infected APCs was evaluated by a median TCID 50 assay. Mature MDDCs did not produce detectable infectious virus after infection and were therefore excluded (Fig 2C) in these drug activity studies. Cell culture supernatants saved from the cell-based assay were titrated by TCID 50 to detect MERS--CoV to evaluate the efficacy of the compounds. There was no virus yield reduction in CQtreated MDMs or immature MDDCs, though the cytotoxicity was relativity low (Fig 5A and  5B ). In CPZ treated cells, around a 2 log 10 virus reduction was observed in both cell types. However, high cytotoxicity narrows the therapeutic window in both MDMs and MDDCs ( Fig  5A and 5B) . A 1-1.5 log 10 virus reduction was measured in TOMF-treated cells, but only when the dose is higher than 20 \u03bcM, with a corresponding increase in cytotoxicity (Fig 5A and 5B) . These observations were similar when compared to the cell-based assay mentioned above. Virus yield reduction data for TOMF, CQ and CPZ in Vero E6 cells showed that CPZ was active against MERS-CoV infection with a 3.1 log 10 drop at the drug dosage of 15 \u03bcM, but TOMF and CQ were not active (Fig 5C) .

Immature DCs are highly specialized at antigen uptake and processing, but are poor stimulators of primary immune responses [23] [24] [25] . Productive infection of immature DCs may delay the activation of T cells, therefore allowing more time for MERS-CoV replication or dissemination. An additional reason that immature MDDCs may be more susceptible to MERS-CoV infection than mature MDDCs to MERS-CoV could be their ability to internalize and process viral antigens. After uptake of antigens or pathogens, immature MDDCs may undergo maturation, migrate to lymphatic tissues, and trigger adaptive immune responses. In theory, the ability of sampling and presenting antigen should be enhanced through MDDCs maturation. For example, immature MDDCs may promote viral dissemination of SARS-CoV within the host by recruiting the virus to enter and damage the lymphatic tissues [26].",

The production of proinflammatory cytokines is essential for host resistance against MERS-CoV infection. Infection of MDMs with MERS-CoV appreciably induced the secretion of antiviral cytokines (IFN-\u03b12, IFN-\u03b3, and IL-12p40), moderately or appreciably up-regulated proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-6), and variably upregulated inflammatory chemokines (MIP-1\u03b1, IP-10, RANTES, IL-8). Clinical studies have shown that expression of proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines, such as IL-6, IL-8, IFN-\u03b3, or IP-10, is highly correlated with disease severity and mortality of SARS patients [30] . Nicholls et al reported that macrophages in lung tissues of SARS patients were identified as the location where the \"cytokine storm\" and virus pathogenesis originated [31] . MDMs secrete proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines to activate antiviral mechanisms, which may cause the dysregulated production of these inflammatory mediators leading to damage to neighboring tissues [32] . Expression of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 are a potential indicators of severe respiratory viral infection, such as SARS and human infection by avian influenza viruses [33] . Our data indicate the possibility of an IFN\u03b3 Th1-mediated inflammatory response that may cause severe MERS disease before an adaptive host immune response is mounted. However, restriction of virus growth in mature MDDCs results in no antiviral activation by IFN-\u03b12. Nevertheless, only moderate expression of IP-10 and minimal induction of MIP-1\u03b1, MCP-1, and RANTES were observed in immature MDDCs. Significant upregulation of most cytokines and chemokines was not observed in either mature or immature MDDCs. Overall, the limited antiviral cytokine response in MDDCs suggests a possible mechanism of immune escape during MERS-CoV infection as seen in SARS-CoV infection [26] . A review of the literature suggests that there is a significant gap in knowledge regarding the role on intracellular regulatory mechanisms such as pathogen recognition receptors (PRR) in the control of coronavirus infection. In this study there was essentially no change in the concentration of cytokines/chemokines measured in mature (and non-permissive) MDDCs. In immature MDDCs, while the measured concentration was less than the control cells in many cases, the concentrations of a number of cytokines/chemokines (IL-6, IP-10, MIP-1\u03b1, MCP-1) increased over the course of the infection, specifically on days 6 and 8 when titers were highest. These data suggest that PRR may have been activated, as would be anticipated in a productive viral infection, but the scale and scope was not evaluated. In addition, data obtained for cytokine release very early after infection cannot be properly evaluated due to the potential presence of cellular components in the virus preparations.",

Compounds that target host effectors could be beneficial during the course of infection [37] . MERS-CoV drug screens have been performed mostly in established cell lines such as Vero and Huh 7 cells. Very little drug evaluation has been performed in primary cell lines. Here we picked three FDA-approved broad-spectrum inhibitors (CPZ, CQ, TOMF) that were shown to be effective against MERS-CoV infection in immortalized cell lines [13, 14] and evaluated their antiviral activities in MDMs and MDDCs. We excluded mature MDDCs for drug screening due to the lack of productive MERS-CoV infection. Surprisingly, our findings for TOMF activity in MERS-CoV-infected MDMs and immature MDDCs differed from results of previous studies in Vero E6 cells. TOMF showed minimal activity against MERS-CoV infection in MDMs. TOMF also had little antiviral activity in immature MDDCs until reaching a high concentration (>20 \u03bcM) that was associated with high cytotoxicity. TOMF is an estrogen receptor modulator that has been shown to inhibit filoviruses [38] and block both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV with EC 50 s12.9 and 11.97\u03bcM, respectively, in Vero E6 cells [13] . This drug inhibits late phrase of virus entry by interfering the fusion of filoviruses [38] . However, in primary cells, the EC 50 increased to 38 \u03bcM though lower cytotoxicity was seen (CC 5 0 = 22.54 \u03bcM). Thus, the therapeutic window for effective treatment with TOMF in primary APCs is narrow.",

CPZ inhibits clathrin-mediated endocytosis through preventing the formulation of clathrin-coated pits at the plasma membrane [46] . Previous work has reported that CPZ inhibits MERS-CoV infection of Huh 7 cells with an EC 50 of 4.9, vs CC 50 of 21.3 \u03bcM [14] . In our primary cells, some activity against MERS-CoV was observed in CPZ-pretreated MDMs and immature MDDCs (EC 50 = 13.58 \u03bcM). However, the high cytotoxicity (25.64 \u03bcM) observed with CPZ on both types of primary cells precludes further development. These studies demonstrate the tested compounds, each of which were shown to be efficacious in continuous cell lines, were not effective at inhibiting MERS-CoV infection in primary APCs.",

            "text": "In conclusion, MERS-CoV infection in primary MDMs induces overexpression of inflammatory cytokines/chemokines potentially leading to tissue damage and systemic virus dissemination. On the other hand, the mechanism of immune escape through MDDC results in inefficient viral clearance, which may explain the high pathogenicity and clinical manifestations seen in MERS. This study also provides the first demonstration of medical countermeasure evaluation for MERS-CoV in primary APCs and illustrates the importance of using nonimmortalized primary cells for the evaluation of drug efficacy. These data also suggest that, given the established mechanisms of action of TOMF, CQ and CPZ, the mechanisms of virus internalization and exocytosis may be different from those used in established cell lines. Before performing in vivo studies, potential compounds should be evaluated in primary cells as major differences may occur between immortalized cell lines and primary cells. ",

The virus was amplified by infection of Vero E6 cells at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01. The infected cells were monitored under a microscope daily. Once cytopathic effects were visible on day 4 post-inoculation, virus-containing supernatants were harvested, clarified by centrifugation, and aliquoted for storage at -80\u02daC. The MERS-CoV stock titer was determined by plaque assay on Vero E6 cells (see below).",
