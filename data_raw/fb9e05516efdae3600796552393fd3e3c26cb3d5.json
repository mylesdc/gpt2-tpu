The aim of this study was to study the influence of serum UA levels on mortality in patients undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. Methods: Data on 492 patients from a single peritoneal dialysis unit were retrospectively analyzed. The mean age of the patients was 53.5 \u00b1 15.3 years, with 52% being female (n = 255). The concomitant comorbidities at the start of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) encompassed diabetes mellitus (n = 179, 34.6%), hypertension (n = 419, 85.2%), and cardiovascular disease (n = 186, 37.9%). The study cohort was divided into sex-specific tertiles according to baseline UA level. A Cox proportional hazard model was used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) of all-cause, cardiovascular, and infection-associated mortality with adjustments for demographic and laboratory data, medications, and comorbidities. Results: Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that, using UA tertile 1 as the reference, the adjusted HR of all-cause, cardiovascular, and infection-associated mortality for tertile 3 was 0.4 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.24-0.68, p = 0.001), 0.4 (95% CI 0.2-0.81, p = 0.01), and 0.47 (95% CI 0.19-1.08, p = 0.1). In the fully adjusted model, the adjusted HRs of all-cause, cardiovascular, and infection-associated mortality for each 1-mg/dL increase in UA level were 0.84 (95% CI, 0.69-0.9, p = 0.07), 0.79 (95% CI, 0.61-1.01, p = 0.06), and 0.79 (95% CI, 0.48-1.21, p = 0.32) for men and 0.57 (95% CI, 0.44-0.73, p < 0.001), 0.6 (95% CI, 0.41-0.87, p = 0.006), and 0.41 (95% CI, 0.26-0.6, p < 0.001) for women, respectively. Conclusions: Higher UA levels are associated with lower risks of all-cause, cardiovascular and infection-associated mortality in women treated with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis.",

Rather than being ingested, uric acid is mainly produced by the liver from the metabolism of endogenous and exogenous purine products. Approximately two-thirds of the daily produced UA is excreted by the functioning of the kidneys, and the rest is largely excreted through the gastrointestinal tract. Elevated UA was significantly associated with rapid kidney function decline and incident chronic kidney disease (CKD) in the Jackson Heart Study of 3702 African Americans [2] . Therefore, hyperuricemia is frequently encountered in patients with renal failure, particularly those with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD).",

From the current literature, it has been equivocal regarding the role of UA in predicting the risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality. Some epidemiologic studies have identified an association between uric acid and CVD, as well as mortality in the general population and CKD patients [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . Other studies have reported that this association is not independent and may be attributed to some concomitant cardiovascular risk factors, such as hyperglycemia, hypertension, and insulin resistance [10, 11] .

The enrollment criteria included incident patients of at least 18 years of age who had survived on CAPD for at least 3 months. Eligible patients were followed up from the date of commencing CAPD and the end of the study was on 31 December 2015 when the clinical outcomes were censored. CVD and infection were the two leading causes of death in our patients. Therefore, the primary outcome of interest was all-cause mortality, and the second outcomes of interest were CV and infection-associated mortality. CV mortality was defined if a death was attributed to any of the following cardiovascular events: coronary events, cardiomyopathy, cardiac dysrhythmia, sudden cardiac death, congestive heart failure, ischemic brain injury, cerebrovascular accident and peripheral vascular disease. Infection was the cause of death if a patient directly died from sepsis. The cause of death was determined by reviewing the discharge diagnosis and hospitalization summary in electronic medical records. The study protocol was approved by the institutional review board of our hospital, and the study was conducted in compliance with the declaration of Helsinki.",

After excluding 126 patients who received allopurinol treatment, the significant association remained in the women but not in the men (Table 3) . Based on the pre-defined sex-specific UA levels to classify the patients as being hyperuricemic or non-hyperuricemic, hyperuricemia was clearly correlated with a lower risk of overall mortality, CV mortality, and infection-associated mortality in the women, but not in the men. Table 5 listed the significant association between UA and clinical parameters at baseline by multivariate linear regression analysis. Serum UA level was positively correlated with male gender, albumin, BUN, iPTH, phosphorus, triglyceride, CV disease, and residual renal function, and negatively correlated with age and 24-h urine output. Table 6 showed the results of the stratified analyses by BMI, cholesterol, albumin, nPNA, phosphorus, and creatinine.

The major finding of this study is that a higher UA level (UA tertile 3) was associated with a lower risk of all-cause, CV, and infection-associated mortality only in the female ESRD patients treated with CAPD, independent of several confounding factors. This observation was further verified by similar results noted when UA was treated as a dichotomous or continuous variable. Furthermore, the association remained significant after excluding the patients taking hypouricemic agents. These findings are in contrast to previously published studies on PD patients, and imply that hyperuricemia per se may protect against the risk of mortality in PD patients.",

One study, conducted in Sweden, comprised 294 subjects starting renal replacement therapy, 161 of whom were started on peritoneal dialysis and the rest were started on hemodialysis [12] . All the patients were evaluated as a whole. During a mean follow-up of 27 months, most of the patients changed their initial dialysis modality with the majority being on hemodialysis at the end of study. They concluded that UA showed a J-shaped relationship with all-cause mortality, with the greatest risk in the 5th quintile. Another retrospective study involved 156 PD subjects conducted in China, which excluded a PD duration of less than 3 months, a history of kidney transplantation and cirrhosis [13] . UA levels were checked both before starting peritoneal dialysis and 3 months following PD for the analysis with mortality. They also demonstrated a J-shaped UA-mortality association that a higher serum UA level is an independent risk factor for all-cause mortality in PD patients. Later, Xia et al. conducted a large investigation of 985 PD patients in South China and found that an elevated level of UA was an independent risk factor for all-cause and CV mortality in men, but not in women, treated with PD [14] . Therefore, the association between UA and mortality may largely be influenced by gender. However, a multicenter study of 2264 patients on chronic PD in China reported contrasting results, in that the prognostic value of UA for all-cause and CV mortality weakened or disappeared after adjusting for uremia-related and traditional CV risk factors [15] . More recently, UA was reported to be a predictor for cardiovascular mortality in male PD patients with diabetes [16] .",

A study reported a significant relationship between UA and CV mortality both in women and men after a longer follow-up period, while the previous study of the same cohort only reported the association merely in women [17] . Sex hormones may also result in different results between men and women. Estradiol, progesterone, and testosterone have been reported to affect UA transporters in mice kidneys, and serum UA levels have been reported to be higher in post-menopausal than pre-menopausal women [18, 19] . Furthermore, the differences in sex may also indicate that women are more susceptible to UA-associated damage than men, as evidenced by studies on arterial stiffness, silent brain infarction and internal carotid artery resistive index [11, [20] [21] [22] .

Increasing evidence shows that UA may cause kidney disease, hypertension, high oxidative stress, and metabolic syndrome [23] [24] [25] . Second, UA can lead to endothelial dysfunction and induce hypertension through activation of the renin-angiotensin system [26, 27] . UA can cause rheological disturbances, such as increased platelet aggregation and adhesiveness [28] . Third, hyperuricemia has been reported to accelerate residual renal function decline which is a strong predictor of patient mortality in PD patients [29] .",

            "text": "On the other hand, four possible explanations may explain why lower UA levels are associated with higher mortality rates. First, serum UA level may reflect the nutritional status because the major source of UA is derived from dietary intake of purines and nucleotides. Therefore, a low serum UA may indicate malnourished status, which in turn accounts for susceptibility to sepsis and impaired immune function [30] . In this study, we were able to show that low UA was associated with potential biomarkers of protein-energy wasting, such as low levels of serum albumin and phosphate. The presence of malnutrition and protein wasting is often accompanied by increased inflammation and oxidative stress, which has been linked with a high risk of mortality in ESRD patients [31, 32] . Second, in both in vivo and in vitro experiments, UA has been shown to be a powerful free radical scavenger which could benefit the CV systems [33, 34] . Third, the so-called \"reverse epidemiology\", also known as \"risk factor reversal\", cannot be completely excluded. Factors that are traditionally considered to be harmful indicators in the general population may be associated with beneficial effects on the clinical outcomes of various chronic diseases, such as obesity paradox in ESRD. When many possible confounding risk factors have been adjusted in the analysis, the paradoxical association of low UA level with high mortality remains significant in our study. Fourth, we lacked the data on C-reactive protein due to the retrospective nature of this study. It is unknown whether the results remain consistent if C-reactive protein is incorporated into the analysis. Fifth, inflammatory cytokines appear to cause low UA as a result of impaired net renal tubular reabsorption of urate [35] . A Taiwanese study of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome showed that marked renal hypouricemia due to a defect in renal UA handling was associated with a higher serum IL-8 level [36] . However, this hypothesis may not affect ESRD patients to a great extent due to their small residual renal function, and we did not measure renal fractional excretion of UA in this study.",

Since detailed information was collected regarding patient demographic features, comorbidities, medications, and laboratory data, we were able to conduct a comprehensive analysis to minimize the potential bias in observational studies. Some potential limitations of the present study should nonetheless be mentioned. First, all the patients were recruited from a single PD center and thus it does not allow the generalization of the results to the entire population of CAPD patients due to the diverse differences in cultural and demographic factors. Second, residual confounding factors cannot be completely excluded. For example, insulin resistance, which has been shown to be a predictor of cardiovascular mortality in ESRD patients, was not evaluated in our study. Third, due to the retrospective nature of this study, we were unable to determine whether the low UA level contributes to the reduced antioxidant capacity. Whether UA per se is a causative factor or merely a marker of nutrition, inflammation or oxidative stress cannot be answered from this study. Fourth, a single measurement of UA at baseline, which did not cover acute change in UA during the study period, might underestimate or over-estimate the true relationship with study outcomes. Despite these limitations, we believe this study contributes to the rather limited knowledge of the predictive value of UA in CAPD patients.",

Based on our findings, the beneficial impact associated with UA appears to outweigh its harmful effects, and may thus have a protective role in CAPD patients. This significant association should alert clinicians to pay more attention to women on CAPD with low UA levels. This UA paradox may be explained by the association between a low level of UA and poor nutrition and possibly increased oxidative stress. However, whether a low level of UA is the cause or consequence of these conditions remains to be elucidated. Further prospective studies of larger sample size are needed to confirm this relationship and to clarify the underlying mechanisms such as the role of UA in antioxidant capacity. ",
