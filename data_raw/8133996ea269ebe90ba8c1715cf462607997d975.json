Unlike schools in the US, human contacts within Chinese colleges are extremely clustered, partly due to the highly organized lifestyle of Chinese college students. Simulations of influenza spreading across real contact networks are in good accordance with real influenza records; however, epidemic simulations across idealized scale-free or small-world networks show considerable overestimation of disease prevalence, thus challenging the widely-applied idealized human contact models in epidemiology. Furthermore, the special contact pattern within Chinese colleges results in disease spreading patterns distinct from those of the US schools. Remarkably, class cancelation, though simple, shows a mitigating power equal to quarantine/vaccination applied on ~25% of college students, which quantitatively explains its success in Chinese colleges during the SARS period. Our findings greatly facilitate reliable prediction of epidemic prevalence, and thus should help establishing effective strategies for respiratory infectious diseases control.",

This CPI data acquisition approach is reasonable due to two aspects of the similarity between Bluetooth signal detection and respiratory disease spreading. First, airborne droplets, the major respiratory disease carrier, can travel for more than 6 meters (while coughing or sneezing) 9 , which is close to the detection range of Bluetooth signals. Second, both airborne droplets and Bluetooth signals are prone to be blocked by intermediate obstacles such as walls. Recently, several studies have been performed to probe real CPI patterns in US and French schools [10] [11] [12] and residential communities 13 using Bluetooth or similar wireless techniques.",

To mitigate potential bias rooted at geographical locations, this data-gathering program was also carried out at a college in northern China (University of Science and Technology of Beijing, or USTB) to collect real CPI data from 87 undergraduates for 28 days (between October 24 and November 20, 2011). On the mobile phone of each volunteer, a PEARL client was installed to scan nearby PEARL clients via Bluetooth technique every 5 minutes. The detected Bluetooth addresses and scan time were recorded. Thus, in every 5 minutes, the CPI data was obtained among the individuals, from which a basic network was reconstructed with every node representing an individual, and every edge representing a 5-minute CPI among two individuals. The summation of all 288 (24 \u00d7 60/5 = 288) basic networks in a certain day formed a daily aggregation of CPI networks, where edge weights denote the aggregate CPI duration in the entire day.

To simulate disease spread on dynamic CPI networks, the unit time of simulation was set according to time resolution. For example, the SCAU networks were constructed through Bluetooth scan every 5 minutes; thus, the unit time was set as 5 minutes accordingly for epidemic simulation.

For fair comparison, un-weighted version of real CPI networks should be employed. A straightforward strategy to achieve this objective is to simply ignore the duration of real CPIs, no matter how strong or weak they are. However, this strategy might lead to deviation in calculation of network statistics, as CPIs greatly vary in durations (Figs 1 and S2 ). In fact, the CPI durations can be perfectly fitted by the mixture of a Poisson distribution and a truncated Gaussian distribution (Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Fig. S3 ). These two distributions were used to describe transient CPIs formed by purely random interactions, and regular CPIs representing meaningful interactions among students, respectively. Based on the intersection point of these two distributions, a threshold to separate transient and regular CPIs can be reasonably determined as 30 minutes, i.e., CPIs with duration no more than 30 minutes were treated as transient. Here, only regular CPIs were considered in calculations of network statistics, and idealized networks were generated with same size to the real CPI networks with transient CPIs removed.",

As shown in Fig. 2 , the SCAU1031 network has a degree distribution that is significantly different from both the Poisson distribution and power-law distribution. Thus, the CPI networks acquired on weekdays are neither uniformly random nor scale-free. However, SCAU1105, a CPI network acquired on a weekend, exhibits a typical power-law degree distribution.

The SCAU CPI networks displayed a lower efficiency than that studied in the US schools, but higher than that observed in the French school. Interestingly, the USTB networks exhibited a similar pattern to that of SCAU networks except for the larger deviations of CC as well as efficiency. \u2022 Modularity: As shown in Supplementary Fig. S5 , the network SCAU1031 consists of a set of tightly interacting modules. This observation was confirmed by quantitative analysis of modularity, which measures the degree that a network can be separated into disconnected communities. There, the SCAU networks possess an average modularity of ~0.82, which is considerably higher than that of the counterpart small-world (0.62), scale-free (0.23), and uniformly-random networks (0.25). Supplementary Fig. S5 also reveals the complicated dynamics of communities, including community merging and diversification. Therefore, it is not sufficient to understand CPI patterns merely based on the CPI network acquired on a single day. If there is a CPI between two students, an edge is drawn between the two corresponding nodes with line width proportional to the aggregate CPI duration in the entire day. The two CPI networks are shown as examples since the CPI networks on weekdays exhibit nearly identical characteristics, and so do those on weekends ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ).",

First, the CPI networks in the two representative Chinese colleges are different from the CPI networks acquired from the US as well as French schools. One explanation is that Chinese college students commonly have highly organized lifestyle, such as living in neighboring dormitories on the same campus, having meals in large-capacity canteens altogether, and being organized into classes for taking identical courses. This highly organized lifestyle is reflected in the formation of a set of small but tightly-interacting communities. Second, the SCAU CPI networks acquired on weekdays are neither scale-free, small-world, nor uniformly random. This challenges the basic assumption of idealized CPI networks adopted in traditional approaches to epidemic research [5] [6] [7] [8] . Such assumption might result in a large deviation in disease dynamics, which has been confirmed by the difference in epidemic dynamics across real CPI networks with that across idealized CPI networks (shown below).",

Specifically, in the simulation of influenza spreading using idealized small-world networks, almost all individuals were found to be infected, and the basic reproductive number R 0 was estimated to be as high as 9.5. In contrast, the percentage of individuals infected is only 55%, and R 0 is only 3.8 when real SCAU CPI networks were used for simulation (Fig. 5A,B) .

In contrast, we gathered 28-day real CPI data in two representative Chinese colleges, allowing an examination of the previously-used network construction strategies. Our experimental results reveal that the previously-used strategy of network construction results in a substantial deviation from the 28-day CPI real networks in epidemic simulation (Supplementary Fig. S9 ). One underlying reason for this observation is related to the fact that by simply repeating a single day's CPI network, the community dynamics, such as merging, vanishing or expansion of network communities during the evolving process of long-term CPI networks, cannot be captured (Supplementary Fig. S5 ). Therefore, a CPI network acquired on any single day may not be representative of the entire CPI network sequence. Our study also reveals that the CPI network data obtained in seven consecutive days yielded simulation results close to that of the entire 28-day CPI networks, indicating the CPI data obtained for seven days can be used for epidemic research of disease spreading in schools ( Supplementary Fig. S9) .",

As quarantine/vaccination coverage increases, the total number of individuals infected drops in a linear pattern (the slopes are \u2212 1.0, \u2212 1.3, \u2212 0.9, and \u2212 1.2 for uniformly random, scale-free, small-world, and SCAU CPI networks, respectively). In addition, the targeted vaccination strategies were found to be extremely effective in SCAU and FRPS than in the US schools. Remarkably, class cancelation, though simple, is ranked as the most effective strategy for disease control as it shows a mitigating power equal to quarantine/vaccination applied on ~25% of college students. Here the SEIR parameters \u03b2 0 = 2.5 \u00d7 10 \u22124 sec \u22121 , \u03b4 = Figure 7D -G suggest that the effectiveness of targeted quarantine/vaccination strategies is CPI-dependent. Specifically, the targeted quarantine/vaccination strategies are extremely effective in SCAU and FRPS relative to that in the US schools. For example, by applying the betweenness centrality selection strategy on the SCAU CPI networks, the ratio of population infected drops from 0.52 to 0.39 under the quarantine/vaccination coverage of 10%, and further drops to 0.27 under the quarantine/vaccination coverage of 20%. On FRPS networks, the ratio of population infected is observed to be as small as 0.05 under a quarantine/vaccination coverage of 20%. In contrast, the ratio of population infected remains higher than 0.50, even at a quarantine/vaccination coverage as high as 30% in both USD and USHS.",

First, the CPI data was gathered from 174 volunteers, which covered only ~15% of the entire undergraduate community in the Information School of SCAU. On one hand, we demonstrated, theoretically and experimentally, that the network characteristics CC and degree density are insensitive to the coverage of CPI data gathering (Supplementary Methods, and Fig. S11 ). In addition, epidemic simulations across the acquired CPI networks are in good agreement with real influenza outbreak records (Fig. 4) . On the other hand, such small coverage might affect the calculation of some network statistics 22 , and a large-scale data collection program would help clarifying the extent to which the coverage of CPI data gathering affects estimation of network statistics.",
