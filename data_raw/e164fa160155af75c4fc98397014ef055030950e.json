We present candidate approaches for anticipating disease emergence prior to large-scale outbreaks. Through use of ideas from the theories of dynamical systems and stochastic processes we develop approaches which are not specific to a particular disease system or model, but instead have general applicability. The indicators of disease emergence detailed in this paper can be classified into two parallel approaches: a set of early-warning signals based around the theory of critical slowing down and a likelihood-based approach. To test the reliability of these two approaches we contrast theoretical predictions with simulated data. We find good support for our methods across a range of different model structures and parameter values.",

This phenomenon, known as critical slowing down, is expected to be observable in systems which are continually subject to shocks-whose origin can be either extrinsic (for instance, environmental fluctuations) or intrinsic (such as demographic noise). The effects of critical slowing down are manifest in the time series, leading to systematic changes in the summary statistics. For example, due to the persistence of perturbations the time series becomes increasingly correlated, which can be measured by the autocorrelation and correlation time. Because EWS are informed by generic properties derived from dynamical systems theory they have a key advantage over model fitting approaches: detailed calibration is not required. EWS have been applied to anticipate transitions in a range of complex systems, including ecosystem collapse in lakes and microbial communities [5, 6] , desertification in arid ecosystems [7] and changes in climate [8] .",

Instead, continued circulation can only be sustained through repeated reintroduction from an external reservoir. In this regime, the transmission dynamics are characterized by what are known as 'stuttering chains' [21] . On the other hand, if R 0 . 1 the disease will typically invade successfully and grow in a fully susceptible population, leading to a largescale outbreak and possible endemicity [22] .

The conventional theory of EWS, as detailed, for example, by Scheffer et al.

The stochastic dynamics are highly non-Gaussian and the conventional theory of critical slowing down is invalid.

For the coefficient of variation, decreasing the population size smooths the abrupt change in value at R 0 \u00bc 1. The Kolmogorov complexity falls as the transition is approached, in line with the increased correlation: if there is a fluctuation above (or below) zero within the detrended data it is more likely to be sustained in further data points. Regular sequences allow for increased use of the copy operation (see appendix B), reducing the complexity of the time series. Perhaps counterintuitively, the complexity of the time series is lower near the transition for larger populations. The entropy has a very similar behaviour to the variance, peaking in the vicinity of the transition. Overall, the results from the BDI process appear to provide an upper bound on the values of the EWS in the SIS model. Figure 2b ,c shows results from the SIRS where the mean duration of immunity, 1/r, is 5 and 25 years. For the smallest population size, N \u00bc 10 2 , the mean number of infected individuals is less than one, irrespective of R 0 . As might be expected, EWS vary little with R 0 and do not display the trends observed for the BDI process. For larger population sizes, the behaviour of some EWS above the transition is markedly different from the SIS model, for example, the autocorrelation remains close to one and the complexity decreases with R 0 . Below the transition, the opposite is the case for N . 10 2 , with the EWS having similar behaviour to the BDI process. For a given population size, the responsiveness of the EWS decreases with immune duration, cf. the similarity in the index of dispersion and Kolmogorov complexity for N \u00bc 10 4 in the SIS model and N \u00bc 10 6 in the SIRS model. Apart from the coefficient of variation, the BDI process results again provide upper bounds on the EWS, as with the SIS model.",

Overall, we see that the transition speed has three notable effects which adversely impact all EWS. The first effect is dynamical: the incidence level is continually responding to the changing equilibrium resulting from increasing R 0 , leading to a lag between the values of the EWS calculated at equilibrium and those observed in the time series. Combined with demographic stochasticity, this leads to an apparent 'bifurcation delay' as the transition is traversed [36, 37] . The second effect arises in computing the EWS. The theoretical results for the EWS are calculated by finding the moments and autocorrelation of a stochastic process. Owing to the absence of multiple replications, these are calculated over a moving window [4] . However, when the disease emerges over a finite time scale, the process is non-stationary, and therefore also non-ergodic, due to changing R 0 (t). In practice, this means that averages are calculated using data points which were generated at different values of R 0 ; for example, if T \u00bc 10 years and W \u00bc 100 weeks, the difference in R 0 between the start and end of the window is 0.38. This reduces the responsiveness of the EWS, also contributing to the lag behind the BDI process results. Furthermore, there can be other artifacts arising from non-ergodicity, for instance, increased variance of the data. Increasing both the window size and transition speed exacerbates these effects due to the larger range in values of R 0 .",

The time scales imposed by real-world disease emergence likely mean that available data are more limited. We therefore apply both approaches to weekly time series data of diseases emerging over a range of different intervals. We find that-apart from the coefficient of variation-all EWS undergo similar behaviour regardless of the time scale of emergence. More advanced time averaging methods may be needed for very fast emergence to detect a strong signal. Although larger window sizes do reduce uncertainty they are typically not necessary, with W \u00bc 100 weeks being sufficient. Cox's d performs best with the largest window size possible so that there is the largest possible difference in R 0 between the start and end of the window. Overall we conclude that the two methods are complementary, performing best under differing conditions. Cox's d reliably detects emergence over fast time scales, where the null hypothesis is strongly disfavoured. EWS perform best at detecting long term trends in the time series, where there is a more gradual approach to the epidemic transition. Additionally, our results favour the use of some EWS over others. The behaviour of the coefficient of variation and Kolmogorov complexity prior to the transition means they both perform poorly as indicators of emergence. The remaining EWS (the mean, variance, index of dispersion, autocorrelation, correlation time and entropy) have a behaviour which is resiliant to parameter changes and reliable in the face of stochasticity, making them strong candidate EWS.",

For diseases emerging in populations structured as many loosely connected smaller community units, such as Ebola in sub-Saharan Africa, this may significantly impact on predictability. R 0 is a measure based on the average context; however heterogeneities in the contact structure of individuals can lead to instances of superspreading [22] , particularly relevant for sexually transmitted diseases and something not captured in the BDI process. The large variations in transmission rates reduce the worth of R 0 as a measure, and a universal increase in R 0 is unlikely to be the driver of emergence. Superspreading events have been identified for SARS and more recently for MERS [21, 40] . In addition, there is the challenge of incomplete and unreliable data, modelled through explicit inclusion of a reporting process [41] .
