Rather than revealing a novel protective role of Ang II via its other receptor AT2R, we believe this confirms the well-established vasopressor effects of Ang II, mediated via AT1R. To rationalise whether classical RAS signaling is beneficial or harmful in acutely ill patients, more trials with Ang II and ACE2 are required to fully understand their longer-term safety profile, their impact on RAS and other biological systems, and their impact on organ failure and outcomes. In the meantime, we speculate that there may be a place for both therapies in different patient populations, with short-term repletion of Ang II in certain vasoplegic shock patients with low Ang II levels, and repletion of ACE2 in ARDS patients with a high Ang II/angiotensin-(1-7) ratio.",
