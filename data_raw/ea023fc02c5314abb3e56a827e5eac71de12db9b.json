            "text": "Acute respiratory infection (ARI) is the most frequent cause for hospitalization in infants and young children. Using multiplexed nCounter technology to digitally quantify 600 human mRNAs in parallel with 14 virus-and 5 bacterium-specific RNAs, we characterized viral and bacterial presence in nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) of 58 children with ARI and determined the corresponding in situ immune profiles. NPA contained different groups of organisms and these were classified into bacterial (n = 27), viral (n = 5), codetection [containing both viral and bacterial transcripts (n = 21), or indeterminate intermediate where microbial load is below threshold (n = 5)]. We then identified differentially expressed immune transcripts (DEITs) comparing NPAs from symptomatic children vs. healthy controls, and comparing children presenting NPAs with detectable microbial load vs. indeterminate. We observed a strong innate immune response in NPAs, due to the presence of evolutionarily conserved type I Interferon (IFN)-stimulated genes (ISG), which was correlated with total bacterial and/or viral load. In comparison with indeterminate NPAs, adaptive immunity transcripts discriminated among viral, bacterial, and codetected microbial profiles. In viral NPAs, B cell transcripts were significantly enriched among DEITs, while only type III IFN was correlated with viral load. In bacterial NPAs, myeloid cells and coinhibitory transcripts were enriched and significantly correlated with bacterial load. In conclusion, digital nCounter transcriptomics provide a microbial and immunological in situ \"snapshot\" of the nasopharyngeal interface in children with ARI. This enabled discrimination among viral, bacterial, codetection, and indeterminate transcripts in the samples using non-invasive sampling.",

The ARI is mainly associated with viral infections and it is generally confined to the upper respiratory tract, causing cough and hoarseness (Tregoning and Schwarze, 2010) . However, it may extend to the lower respiratory tract, which in turn causes wheezing and respiratory distress. Concomitant viral and bacterial infection, caused mainly by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis, can lead to the development of acute otitis media (Ruohola et al., 2013) or pneumonia (Nolan et al., 2017) . This adds another layer of complexity to the microbial interactions at the respiratory tract.",

Recent investigations have used blood transcriptomic analysis to identify immune signatures in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) (Parnell et al., 2012) , respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection (Mejias et al., 2013) , and rhinovirus (RV) infection (Heinonen et al., 2015) . Additionally, such analyses are robust enough to distinguish bacterial from viral respiratory infection, suggesting that transcriptional profiling can improve diagnosis (Suarez et al., 2015; Sweeney et al., 2016) . In parallel, studies performed at the nasopharynx interface have shed light on the relationships between different microorganisms that may colonize this site such as S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and those that can cause infection (RSV and RV) (Wiertsema et al., 2011; Skevaki et al., 2015; Uitti et al., 2015) .",

Briefly, the distance between the entrance of the nostril and the ear lobe was used as an estimate of the distance from the entrance of the nostril to the nasopharynx. An aseptic catheter was inserted into the nostril and upon reaching the nasopharynx, negative pressure was applied to collect approximately 2 mL of nasal secretion. Samples were placed in a sterile tube containing 1 mL of NucliSENS Lysis Buffer (bioMerieux) and frozen at \u221270 \u2022 C until use. For healthy controls (n = 7), the collection of NPAs was performed by instilling 2 mL of isotonic saline into each nostril, followed by immediate aspiration (\u223c1 mL) via the insertion of a flexible catheter. These samples were transferred into sterile tubes containing 1 mL of NucliSENS Lysis Buffer (bioMerieux) and frozen at \u221270 \u2022 C until use. Total ribonucleic acid (RNA) was obtained using an RNEasy Kit (Qiagen) in accordance with manufacturer's instructions.

Modularity analysis (Blondel et al., 2008) was performed to identify nodes that are more densely interconnected (Supplementary Dataset 3) . The DEITs significantly correlated with microbial load, and those present in >50% in bootstrap resampling were considered as a community, whereas DEITs below this threshold were marked as bystanders. For the sparse partial least squares (sPLS) approach implemented in the R package (Liquet et al., 2016) , DEITs were used as 'predictors' and the microbial load as 'response variables.' This method disintegrates the predictors and the response variation, while identifying their correlation and the contributors for each variation component. The sPLS score was then used in a Spearman correlation analysis against the bacterial or the viral load to confirm the role of correlated DEITs. In addition, DEITs were also determined by comparing NPAs of ARI patients with classified microbial load (\"bacterial, \" \"viral, \" or \"codetected\") to ARI patients classified \"indeterminate.\" Cell-specific gene lists validated by CTEn (cell type enrichment) (Shoemaker et al., 2012) were used to identify enriched cell types in the immune signature observed in these comparisons. Correlation and modularity analyses were also performed with respect to these DEITs (Supplementary Datasets 4, 5) . To derive an evolutionarily conserved antiviral score, we used a genomewide cross-species comparison of type I IFN-induced antiviral response and tallied the number of species (0-10) with significant (FDR < 0.05) antiviral activity for each individual gene (Shaw et al., 2017) .",

Of the 58 NPAs evaluated, 53 (91.4%) samples showed microbial transcript counts above the calculated cutoffs and were considered positive. These NPAs were further classified as \"bacterial\" (n = 27, 46.6%), \"viral\" (n = 5, 8.6%), or \"codetection\" (presenting both bacterial and viral transcripts) (n = 21, 36.2%) ( Figure 1A and Supplementary Dataset 1). Five NPAs (8.6%) were classified as \"indeterminate, \" because their microbial transcript counts were below the calculated cutoff, and thus displayed a microbial profile similar to healthy controls ( Figure 1A and Supplementary Dataset 1). Among the 27 bacterial NPAs, 22 (81.5%) presented with H. influenzae transcripts ( Figure 1B) . Transcripts for S. pneumoniae (8/58 NPAs, 13.8%) and M. catarrhalis (2/58 NPAs, 3.4%) and for M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae (1/58 NPA each, 1.72%) were also detected ( Figure 1A and Supplementary Dataset 1). In viral NPAs, we detected transcripts for RSVA (1/58, 1.7%), RSVA + IVA (1/58, 1.7%), hMPV (1/58, 1.7%), and RSVB (2/58, 3.4%) ( Figure 1A and Supplementary Dataset 1). Transcripts for CoV, IVB, and PIV2 were not detected in any of the 53 NPAs evaluated. In codetection NPAs, H. influenzae transcripts were also overtly represented (19/21 NPAs, 90.5%) (Figures 1A,B and Supplementary Dataset 1) and occurred in combination with transcripts for RSVA, RSVB, PIV1, PIV3, AV2, AV5, hMPV, and CoV229. Upon examination of correlations among the different microbial targets in NPAs (Figure 1C) , H. influenzae is at the center of the network, indicating that it is associated with all other targets detected, particularly S. pneumoniae and M. catarrhalis. Viral targets associate mostly with a bacterial target and rarely with another viral target (for e.g., RV and BoV or PIV3).",

Notably, we did not observe significant differences in either verbal complaints or any findings following physical examination of children harboring NPAs classified as bacterial, viral, or codetection (Table 1) . Therefore, in this cohort, ARI symptoms could not be associated with specific respiratory pathogens, nor with pathogen classes (viral vs. bacterial). These data are not shown. Of note, strict viral presence was observed in only 5/58 (8.6%) NPAs, while S. aureus transcripts were detected in similar numbers across all NPAs examined and, hence, were not included in our analysis of pathogen-related immune signatures (Supplementary Figure 1) .",

Codetection NPAs showed the highest number of upregulated immune genes (n = 449) ( Figure 2C ). As mentioned previously, five NPAs were classified as \"indeterminate, \" as the microbial transcript counts were below the established cutoff and indistinguishable from healthy controls, but these samples also displayed upregulated genes (n = 370) ( Figure 2D ). Using GSEA, bacterial NPAs showed the broadest enrichment of pathways whereas viral NPAs were expectedly related to antiviral immunity, interferon and IRF7 activation (Supplementary Figure 3) .

Among the 365 DEITs upregulated in bacterial NPAs (shown in Figure 2A) , 156 DEITs formed a module/community that was directly correlated with bacterial load (Figure 3A ), whereas the remaining 32 genes formed a separate module/community (Supplementary Dataset 3) . On the contrary, among the 208 DEITs detected in viral NPAs (shown in Figure 2B ), the module/community correlated with viral load consisted of 29 genes ( Figure 3A) . Codetection NPAs presented the highest number of upregulated genes, but the community/module that correlated with microbial presence contained only five genes (C1S, CX3CL1, DEFB1, HAMP1, and IL15). Notably, C4BPA, a gene that encodes a protein involved in complement activation, was differentially expressed and correlated with bacterial load in bacterial and in codetection NPAs, whereas CXCL11, a chemokine that recruits activated T cells, neutrophils, or monocytes, was correlated with microbial load in viral and in codetection NPAs ( Figure 3A) . Therefore, in situ transcriptomics revealed three communities/modules: the first module consisted of 157 (156 depicted in the module plus C4BPA) immune genes, whose expression is directly correlated with bacterial counts (Figure 3B) , which herein is mostly H. influenzae (shown in Figure 1) . A second modular community consisted of 29 (28 genes depicted in the module plus CXCL11) genes (Figure 3B) , whose expression was directly correlated with viral counts (RSV, PIV, AV, etc.). The last community consisted of five genes, whose expression was correlated with both bacterial and viral transcripts (codetection NPAs). We then applied sPLS regression to confirm that the modules/communities of immune genes identified previously were correlated with the microbial load. In this step, bacterial and codetection NPAs were analyzed together, since both presented transcripts for bacteria, as were viral and codetection NPAs, since both presented viral transcripts. Indeed, we observed a strong positive correlation (r = 0.457 and p = 0.001) (Figure 4A ) between the bacterial module of immune genes (shown in Figure 3B ) and bacterial load. This result was also obtained (r = 0.556 and p = 0.003) (Figure 4B ) when we compared the viral module of immune genes (shown in Figure 3B ). We thus identified an in situ gene signature that is specifically attributed to the quantity of bacterial and/or viral transcripts in NPAs of children with ARI.",

We hypothesized that the gene expression profile detected by nCounter could distinguish microbial presence, independent of clinical symptoms. We thus applied the same analysis pipeline (Supplementary Figure 2) to identify whether the immune signatures in bacterial, viral, and codetection NPAs were distinct from those that are present in indeterminate NPAs. Notably, the number of DEITs in bacterial (n = 33, Figure 5A ), viral (n = 17, Figure 5B ), or codetection NPAs (n = 21, Figure 5C ) was lower in comparisons with indeterminate NPAs and in the comparisons with healthy controls (shown in Figure 3) .

Using CTEn curated lists of cell type-specific genes, we found that B cell transcripts were significantly enriched among viral DEITs (enrichment p < 0.0001, OR 20.7 [10.4-39.4]).

Colonization of H. influenzae begins in infancy and approximately 20% of cases are colonized within the first year of life (Howard et al., 1988) . When a new bacterial or viral acquisition occurs, a potential disturbance in the microenvironment can lead to invasion, dissemination, and complications. For example, RV infection stimulated S. pneumoniae adhesion to airway epithelial cells (Ishizuka et al., 2003) , whereas RSV and PIV2 infection increased the expression of receptors for pathogenic bacteria (Avadhanula et al., 2006) . These are two possible mechanistic explanations for complicated disease in simultaneous bacterial/viral infection. We have also shown that pleural effusion, a complication of pneumonia, was shown to occur in children with mixed viral and bacterial presence (Nascimento-Carvalho et al., 2013) . Although our analyses confirmed the presence of microbial transcripts in the NPAs, including a number of samples with mixed (codetection) transcripts, clinical symptoms presented by such children did not differ significantly from those harboring a single infection, at least at the time of admission. Regarding viral ARI, increased disease severity in the case of multiple codetection has not been clinically observed (reviewed in Nascimento-Carvalho and Ruuskanen, 2015) . However, most of the reports reviewed therein employed DNA detection, which may reflect a range of conditions. This differed from our strategy that employed mRNA detection, thus mirroring active viral and bacterial replication.",

Overall, we detected a strong upregulation in gene expression, it being the strongest in NPAs classified as \"codetection, \" followed by \"bacterial\" and \"viral.\" NPA classified as \"indeterminate\" also displayed clinical symptoms and a significant upregulation in gene expression, which might be explained by two hypotheses that are not mutually exclusive. The first hypothesis is that indeterminate NPAs might contain unknown respiratory or nonrespiratory pathogens that were not present in our customized set of probes, which contained all respiratory viruses and bacteria currently considered to be clinically relevant. The second hypothesis is that the \"indeterminate\" immune signature might be triggered by environmental allergens, in agreement with our recent observation that environmental factors (the presence of dogs and birds in the house) are associated with wheezing in children with ARI (Oliveira et al., submitted). Furthermore, nCounter has proven highly sensitive for the detection of (retro)viral transcripts in HTLV-1-infected T cell lines (Moens et al., 2012) , and equally sensitive as real-time PCR for the detection of RSVA and RSVB in NPAs (Bouzas et al., submitted) , arguing against a failure of nCounter technology to detect microbial transcripts in indeterminate NPAs.",

Type II interferon (gamma) is produced by lymphocytes and NK cells and is associated with inflammatory responses. Mejias et al. (2013) also found the interferon-signaling pathway to be the most upregulated pathway in blood transcriptomic analysis with a cohort of children with RSV infection. In this study, the authors followed 21 patients with RSV infection and found greater activation of interferon-related genes during follow-up, suggesting that RSV downregulated interferon-related responses (Mejias et al., 2013) .

We thus correlated the expression of immune genes with microbial loads and performed modularity analysis, which enabled us to identify a modular community of genes that were expressed in response to bacterial presence, viral presence, or both (codetection). The bacterial modular community contained 156 genes, associated with a variety of functions, including chemokines, transcription factors, cytokines, and genes related to TNF. A C4b-binding protein (C4BPA), that inhibits the classical pathway of complement activation and subsequent opsonization followed by lysis, was correlated with bacterial load, as well as bacterial plus viral (codetection) load. The C4BPA binds to several bacterial pathogens, including H. influenzae (Hallstrom et al., 2007) and M. catarrhalis (Nordstrom et al., 2004) , enhancing bacterial adhesion, for example. Among the 29 genes positively correlated with viral load, two (CXCL11 and CXCL10) are interferon-regulated chemokines. Together with CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 bind to the same CXCR3 receptor and preferentially attract activated T-and NK-cells. Recent evidence points toward non-redundant roles for three IFN-induced CXCR3 ligands in vivo, for example, CXCL10 during viral infections and CXCL11 during allergic reactions (reviewed in Metzemaekers et al., 2018) . This finding is in line with our results in children with ARI. Moreover, in comparison to the 5 genes observed in the codetected modular community, the 28 genes present in the viral modular community displayed significantly higher evolutionary antiviral scores (Supplementary Figure 4) . These results were based upon genome-wide cross-species comparison of type I IFN-induced antiviral response (Shaw et al., 2017) , underscoring the biological link between the viral gene module and viral load in ARI.",

The comparison between viral or codetection NPAs against indeterminate NPAs showed that IFNL3 was uniquely shared between the two clinical groups, and significantly correlated with viral load. Type III IFN induces a variety of ISGs, interfering with viral replication (Sadler and Williams, 2008) , and it seems to be the major source of IFN in airway epithelial cells (Khaitov et al., 2009 ). The IFNL3 is expressed in response to RSV (Spann et al., 2004) and IV (Durbin et al., 2013) , both present in NPA samples. We also performed additional analysis of ten post-ARI samples from the larger cohort of 576 children, collected at 2-4 weeks after recruitment and diagnosis. These samples were subjected to nCounter analysis and compared with all the 53 samples that had detectable pathogens (bacterial, viral, and codetection groups). Total viral load decreased from 990 to 24 normalized counts (almost forty-fold) in cured patients after 2-4 weeks of follow-up (data not shown). This result was not statistically significant (p = 0.30), due to low numbers and a high coefficient of variation (>130%). On the other hand, bacterial loads remained equally high (>10,000 normalized counts) in both cured (post-ARI) samples and samples from ARI during the acute phase. We also found a roughly fivefold decrease in IFNL3 transcripts, from a median of 32.2 (IQR 5.3-114.8) to 6.7 (IQR 2.7-57.9) normalized counts (p = 0.22). With regard to IFNL3 transcripts, although decreased, they still correlated positively with both viral (r = 0.62, p = 0.06) and bacterial load (r = 0.62, p = 0.067) in post-ARI samples. No such trend was observed for type I IFN transcripts, either IFNA2 or IFNB1 (p > 0.2 for both bacterial and viral load). Therefore, these results emphasize the hypothesis that type III IFN might play a protective role in the ongoing antiviral and, possibly, antiviral immune response (and possibly the antibacterial immune response) in the nasal mucosa, even outside the symptomatic phase of ARI in pediatric patients. Because of the small size and short follow-up (2-4 weeks after ARI diagnosis), these findings remain to be confirmed in larger cohorts with prolonged clinical and microbiological followup.",

Type III IFN induces a variety of ISGs that interfere with viral replication (Sadler and Williams, 2008) . It seems to be the major source of IFN in airway epithelial cells (Khaitov et al., 2009 ) and IFNL3 is expressed in response to RSV (Spann et al., 2004) and IV (Durbin et al., 2013) , both of which are present in NPA samples.",

The protein c-MAF, encoded by the MAF gene, is a DNAbinding, leucine zipper-containing transcription factor that, depending on the binding site and binding partner, can be a transcriptional activator or repressor. It plays a role in the regulation of several cellular processes. The protein c-MAF is one of the transcription factors signaling for the development of T follicular helper T cells (Tfh) from na\u00efve CD4+ T cells (Andris et al., 2017) . This development requires sequential steps involving cytokine, surface receptor, and transcription factor signaling. The Tfh cells are critical for the humoral response, that is, activation of B cells, class switching, and germinal center formation (Jogdand et al., 2016) . This result suggests that MAF may be a key regulator in the immune response of ARI, regardless of the type of microbial presence.",

We propose that the latter group may act as markers of the immune response at the nasopharyngeal interface in children with ARI. Importantly, MARCO is a scavenger receptor expressed in tissue-resident macrophages that recognizes various bacterial pathogens, and MARCO, for example, can enhance adenovirus infection (Maler et al., 2017) . On the other hand, CSFR1 and CSF2RB are the receptors for the major monocyte/macrophage growth factors M-CSF and GM-CSF, respectively. Thus, monocytes/macrophages may provide a bridge between innate and adaptive immunity in the nasal mucosa during ARI, clustering with lymphocyte activation markers IKAROS (encoded by IKZF1) and JAK3 (a central kinase in lymphokine signaling).",
