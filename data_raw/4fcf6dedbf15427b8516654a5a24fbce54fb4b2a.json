Specific anti-NP and anti-M1 IgA Abs were determined by ELISA as previously described 1 . In brief, ELISA plates were coated with 2 \u00b5g of purified NP and M1 antigen per well. The appropriate dilutions of samples from each individual mouse were applied to the plates, serially diluted two-fold in PBS/Tween (PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20), and then incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. Subsequently, the plates were washed and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat antibodies directed against IgA. After incubation with mouse IgA conjugates for 1 h at 37\u00b0C, the plates were washed twice with PBS/Tween and once with PBS. Antibodies were detected using substrate buffer (50 mM phosphate buffer pH 5.5 containing 0.02% OPD and 0.006% perhydrol). Plates were developed in the dark for 30 min at room temperature, after which the reaction was stopped by the addition of 50 \u03bcl 2 M H 2 SO 4 per well, and absorbances were read at 492 nm (A492) using a SPECTRA I ELISA reader. The titers were defined as end-point titers, and the absorbance of the highest dilution was two-fold greater than the background value of the faecal and BALF samples. ",

(a) DCs gating strategy. (b) and (c) DCs were also isolated from PP and MLN of mice immunized with recombinant L. plantarum or H9N2 inactivated vaccine for 24 h, and the expressions of CD80, CD86, CD40 and MHC-II were determined. Results are presented as the means \u00b1 S.E.M of triplicate tests (n=8-10 mice each group), and are analyzed using one way Anova, assuming Gaussian distribution followed by the Dunnett Post-test, and are expressed relative to the PBS, NC8-pSIP409 and NC8-pSIP409-NP-M1-Ctrlpep (*P<0.05). Data shown represent one of three experiments with equivalent results. pSIP409-NP-M1-DC pep H9N2 inactivated vaccine center (GC) of MLNs.

The in vivo cell-mediated cytotoxicity was characterized at 18 h. The green arrow represents the CFSE low cells that were not incubated with peptide, and the red arrow shows NP and M1-pulsed, pSIP409NP-DCpep-primed CD4 + T cells or CD4 + plus CD8 + T cells in NOD/SCID mice. CD4 + and CD8 + T cells were isolated from spleen and MLN of mice immunized with strains as indicated 14 days after booster vaccination, and then adoptively transferred to NOD-SCID mice by i.v. (tail vein) injection.
