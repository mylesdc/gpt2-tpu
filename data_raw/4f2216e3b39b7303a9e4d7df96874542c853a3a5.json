            "text": "Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) is recognized as the causative agent of porcine circovirus-associated diseases. PCV2 replication could be promoted by low doses of ochratoxin A (OTA) as in our previous study and selenium has been shown to attenuate PCV2 replication. However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of selenomethionine (SeMet), the major component of organic selenium, on OTA-induced PCV2 replication promotion and its potential mechanism. The present study demonstrates that OTA could promote PCV2 replication as measured by cap protein expression, viral titer, viral DNA copies and the number of infected cells. In addition, OTA could activate autophagy as indicated by up-regulated light chain 3 (LC3)-II and autophagy-related protein 5 expressions and autophagosome formation. Further, OTA could down-regulate p-AKT and p-mTOR expressions and OTA-induced autophagy was inhibited when insulin was applied. SeMet at 2, 4 and 6 \u03bcM had significant inhibiting effects against OTA-induced PCV2 replication promotion. Furthermore, SeMet could attenuate OTA-induced autophagy and up-regulate OTA-induced p-AKT and p-mTOR expression inhibition. Rapamycin, an inhibitor of AKT/ mTOR, could reverse the effects of SeMet on OTA-induced autophagy and the PCV2 replication promotion. In conclusion, SeMet could block OTA-induced PCV2 replication promotion by inhibiting autophagy by activating the AKT/ mTOR pathway. Therefore, SeMet supplementation could be an effective prophylactic strategy against PCV2 infections and autophagy may be a potential marker to develop novel anti-PCV2 drugs.",

However, not all pigs infected with PCV2 will develop PCVAD, other factors, such as animal management, coinfection and immunostimulation, have been reported to be associated with the disease [7] . Our recent findings suggested that both oxidative stress and ochratoxin A (OTA) enhance PCV2 replication [8, 9] , which may partly explain the difference in morbidity and severity of PCVAD among PCV2-infected pig farms.",

During this process, sections of cytoplasm are sequestered within double-membrane vesicles (named autophagosomes) that eventually fuse with lysosomal compartments for bulk degradation [13, 14] . The kinase mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is known to be a major modulator of autophagy [15] . AKT is an upstream molecular of kinase mTOR, and the activation of AKT could inhibit autophagy [16] . In recent years, interaction between autophagy and viral infection have been revealed in numerous studies. Normally, autophagy acts as a host antimicrobial defense mechanism against a variety of pathogens, including bacteria and viruses by delivering them to the lysosomal compartment [17, 18] . However, some viruses such as hepatitis C virus and dengue virus have developed strategies to utilize autophagy for their own benefit of replication [19, 20] . Previous studies suggested that PCV2 virus induces autophagy by suppressing the mTOR signaling pathway, and the inhibition of autophagy reduces the replication of PCV2 [21, 22] .",

As shown in Figure 5A , 0.1 \u03bcM OTA treatment led to significant increases in LC3-II and ATG5 levels when compared to the control group and these increases were smaller when 2 or 4 \u03bcM SeMet was added. Furthermore, this increase in LC3-II and ATG5 levels induced by OTA treatment were blocked when SeMet concentration was increased to 6 \u03bcM.

However, these increases of GFP-LC3 puncta were smaller when 2 or 4 \u03bcM SeMet was added.

Despite much progress in the PCV2vaccine, vaccine efficacy remains uncertain due to variations in concentration of antigen, adjuvant type and the administration doses [35] . Nutrition supplementation in trace elements is suggested to be an effective prophylactic protection against viral infections [36] . Selenium is an essential micronutrient for both humans and animals [37] . Selenium deficiency has been reported to be related to enhanced virulence and severity of some viruses including HIV and Coxsackie virus [38, 39] , whereas selenium supplementation could improve the immune response to protect against viral infections. In HIV infection, selenium supplementation increased CD4 + T cells and suppressed the progression of viral loads [28] . And selenium supplementation could protect mice infected with H1N1 as well [40] . In this study, we determined the anti-viral activity of selenium against OTA-induced PCV2 replication promotion in PK-15 cells, and our results show that OTA promoted PCV2 replication by inducing autophagy through the AKT/ mTOR pathway and selenium supplementation inhibited OTA-induced PCV2 replication promotion in a dosedependent manner. Furthermore, we show that selenium supplementation exerts its protective effects by inhibiting autophagy through the activation of the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.",

We observed that the levels of p-AKT and p-mTOR were down-regulated following the treatment of OTA and in a time-dependent manner ( Figures 4A and B) . To further determine the role of the AKT/mTOR pathway in OTA induced autophagy, we applied insulin, an activator of AKT/mTOR, and the results show that the OTA-induced down-regulation in AKT phosphorylation and mTOR expressions were restored after insulin treatment ( Figure 4B ), indicating OTA induced autophagy by inactivating the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.",

            "text": "Normally, selenium exerts its biological effects when it is incorporated into selenoproteins, and most selenoproteins function as antioxidant enzymes. Our previous studies demonstrated that selenium could inhibit PCV2 replication mainly through the function of selenoproteins including GPx1 and selenoprotein S [9, 31] . Previous studies also showed that inhibition of autophagy could suppress viral replication, including PCV2 [22] . So, we wondered whether autophagy was involved in the mechanism underlying the anti-PCV2 effect of selenium. In the present study, we first demonstrate that SeMet supplementation prevented the activation of autophagy induced by OTA, as reflected by decreased levels of LC3-II, ATG5 and the number of GFP-LC3 spots ( Figure 5 ). Our results show that OTA induced autophagy by inactivating the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway in PCV2-infected PK-15 cells (Figure 4 ). In addition, several studies have indicated that selenium could activate the PI3 K-AKT pathway [49] , and studies showed that mTOR is directly linked to AKT, and the PI3 K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway plays an important role in autophagy [48] . Thus, we speculate that the inhibiting effect of selenium on autophagy is due to its activation of the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. In addition, our results further show that the levels of p-AKT and p-mTOR were restored after the treatment of SeMet in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway was activated after the treatment of SeMet.",
