            "text": "Avian Tembusu virus (ATMUV) is a highly pathogenic flavivirus that causes significant economic losses to the Chinese poultry industry. Our previous experiments demonstrated that ATMUV infection effectively triggered host innate immune response through MDA5 and TLR3-dependent signaling pathways. However, little information is available on the role of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in defending against ATMUV infection. In this study, we found that ATMUV infection induced robust expression of type I and type III interferon (IFNs) in duck tissues. Furthermore, we observed that expression of interferon-inducible transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) was significantly upregulated in DEF and DF-1 cells after infection with ATMUV. Similar results were obtained from in vivo studies using ATMUV-infected ducklings. Importantly, we showed that knockdown of endogenous IFITM1 or IFITM3 by specific shRNA markedly enhanced ATMUV replication in DF-1 cells. However, disruption of IFITM2 expression had no obvious effect on the ATMUV replication. In addition, overexpression of chicken or duck IFITM1 and IFITM3 in DF-1 cells impaired the replication of ATMUV. Taken together, these results reveal that induced expression of avian IFITM1 and IFITM3 in response to ATMUV infection can effectively restrict the virus replication, and suggest that increasing IFITM proteins in host may be a useful strategy for control of ATMUV infection.",

TMUV strains were firstly isolated from mosquitoes in Malaysia and Thailand, but their pathogenicity is not fully understood Pandey et al., 1999) . Sitiawan virus, a broiler-origin TMUV strain, was the first pathogenic virus causing encephalitis and retarded growth in broiler chicks (Kono et al., 2000) . Since 2009, Chinese domestic poultry including ducks, chickens, and geese have been manifesting a new epidemic disease caused by a TMUV-related flavivirus, named as avian Tembusu virus (ATMUV). This outbreak was quickly spread to many provinces of China and several south-eastern Asian countries (Homonnay et al., 2014; Thontiravong et al., 2015) . ATMUV genome consists of a single strand positive-sense RNA and encodes three structural proteins [capsid (C), premembrane (PrM/M), and envelope (E)] and seven non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5) Homonnay et al., 2014) . ATMUV-infected adult animals showed symptoms of hemorrhagic ovaritis and acute egg drop syndrome, high fever, anorexia, diarrhea, ataxia, weight loss and paralysis, with a high morbidity (90-100%), and mortality ranged from 0 to 30% depending on different management and weather conditions, leading to enormous economic losses to poultry industry in China (Cao et al., 2011; Su et al., 2011; Yan et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2012 Liu et al., , 2013 Chen et al., 2013) . The young flocks are more vulnerable to ATMUV infection, characterized by similar clinical symptoms including anorexia, diarrhea, high fever and severe neurologic dysfunction, with a higher mortality than adult birds (Vaidya et al., 2012; Ti et al., 2015) . ATMUV was easily detected in ovaries and theca folliculi of infected animals, suggesting that the reproductive tissues were the major targets for the viral infection and replication . Viral RNA was also detected in spleen, trachea, kidney, brain, and blood of infected host (Yan et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2012) . In addition, it was observed that ATMUV could infect various cell lines including DEF, CEF, DF-1, BHK-21, Vero, A549, 293T, and HeLa, resulting in a noticeable cytopathic effect (CPE) characterized by cell shrinkage, rounding and detachment (Chen et al., 2016a; .",

Innate immune system recognizes viruses invasion via specific pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) to sense pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) expressed by viruses. Activated PRRs then interact with adaptor proteins such as interferon\u03b2 promoter stimulator-1 (IPS-1), MyD88, and TRIF (Takeuchi and Akira, 2009 ). The ligations of PRRs with adaptor proteins result in the activation of the transcription factors, including NF-\u03baB and interferon regulatory factors (IRF3 and IRF7) (Takeuchi and Akira, 2010) . IRFs and NF-\u03baB translocate to the nucleus where they stimulate the expression of type I and type III interferons (IFNs). Then interaction between the IFNs and their receptors causes activation of JAK-STAT signaling pathway. Phosphorylated STAT proteins translocate to the nucleus and combine with interferon regulatory proteins to promote an abundant expression of a wide array of genes, including IFNstimulated genes (ISGs) (Takeuchi and Akira, 2010; Tan et al., 2012; Bailey et al., 2014) . These ISGs encode distinct antiviral proteins with diverse biological effects that block multiple stages of the viral lifecycle including viral entry, translation, replication, assembly, and spread (Diamond and Farzan, 2013) .",

Interestingly, we observed that ATMUV infection could trigger duck innate immune response including robust expression of particular type I and type III IFNs and IFITM family proteins. Using DF-1 cell system, we found that knockdown of endogenous IFITM1 and IFITM3 by short hairpin RNA (shRNA) markedly enhanced ATMUV infection in host. However, silencing IFITM2 had no significant effect on ATMUV replication. Furthermore, overexpression of chicken or duck IFITM1 and IFITM3 could strongly inhibit the replication of ATMUV.

Duck embryo fibroblasts (DEFs) were prepared from 13-dayold mule-duck embryo as previously described (Shahsavandi et al., 2013) . DF-1 (immortalized chicken embryo fibroblast cell line) and 293T cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). DEF, DF-1, and 293T cells were cultured at 37 \u2022 C with 5% CO 2 in DMEM (Sigma, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, HyClone, Utah, USA), 100 units of penicillin G and 100 \u00b5g of streptomycin. DF-1 and DEF were infected with ATMUV CJD05 as previously described (Chen et al., 2016a) at the multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1.0 and harvested at the indicated times after infection. Twenty five 7-day-old mule healthy ducklings were challenged with 0.4 mL of CJD05 (the 5th passage allantoic fluid virus, ELD 50 = 10 \u22126.0 /mL) per duckling by intramuscular injection. Each group of three randomly selected ducklings was sacrificed at 0, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h post-infection (hpi), and their spleen, kidney, bursa of fabricius, pancreas, and brain were harvested for detection of viral infection by indirect immunofluorescence assay. These tissues were also used for total RNA extraction to examine the mRNA expression of IFNs/IFITMs by quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). The sera and spleen homogenates (30%w/v) of the ducklings were prepared for detecting of viral titers by 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID 50 ) assay during the infection. Other infected ducklings and 10 control ducklings (inoculated with 0.4 mL sterile PBS per duckling) were used to monitor clinical signs and rectal temperature daily for 10 days.",

These results were further confirmed by RT-PCR analysis (Supplementary Figure 4) . Taken together, these data reveal that innate immune response is triggered in DEFs infected with ATMUV, as indicated by significant upregulation of IFNs and IFITMs. Because DEF cells are hard to survive after several passages, we employed chicken DF-1 cell line as a model system to further investigate the interaction between host innate immune system and ATMUV, and the role of IFITMs in defense against viral infection. As expected, mRNA levels of IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2, and IFN\u03bb were greatly elevated by ATMUV infection and reached the maximal levels at 24 hpi and then declined gradually as compared to mock treatment (Figures 4A-C) . Similarly, expression of chicken IFITM1 (chIFITM1) was highly upregulated by 28fold at 24 hpi. Expression of chicken IFITM2 (chIFITM2) and IFITM3 (chIFITM3) was also significantly increased in response to ATMUV infection (Figures 4D-F) .

Furthermore, we tested that whether these IFITMs functioned in defense against the virus infection. For this, we generated stable DF-1 cell lines expressing specific shRNAs targeting IFITM1, IFITM2, IFITM3, or luciferase control, respectively. These cells were then infected with ATMUV and harvested at indicated times (24, 36, and 48 hpi) . Interference efficiency of the shRNAs was examined by qRT-PCR and viral load in cell culture supernatants was titrated via TCID 50 assay. Compared with the control shRNA targeting luciferase, the specific shRNAs caused decreased expression of IFITM1, IFITM2, or IFITM3 after ATMUV infection, respectively (Figures 5A-C) . Interestingly, silencing endogenous IFITM1 or IFITM3 resulted in significant increase in viral load, as evidenced by higher viral titers in culture supernatants from the IFITM1 or IFITM3 knockdown cells than those in supernatants of luciferase control cells ( Figure 5D) . However, knockdown of IFITM2 only slightly enhanced ATMUV replication ( Figure 5D ). To confirm these findings, DF-1 cell lines expressing specific shRNA targeting each of these IFITMs were infected with ATMUV and harvested at 36 hpi, followed by qRT-PCR assay to detect mRNA expression of viral genes. Consistent with the results from TCID 50 assay, data of qRT-PCR showed that mRNA expression of viral envelope and NS5 genes was clearly increased in IFITM1 or IFITM3 knockdown cells as compared to the control cells. However, no significant difference was observed in viral load between IFITM2 knockdown and luciferase control cells after infection with ATMUV ( Figure 5E ). This data suggests that disrupting the endogenous expression of chicken IFITM1 and IFITM3 but not IFITM2 can strongly enhance the ATMUV replication in DF-1 cells.",

On the basis of typical clinical symptoms, ATMUV was initially described as duck egg drop syndrome virus (DEDSV). However, this virus exhibits a wide range of pathogenicity to avian species including ducks, chicken, geese, house sparrows, and racing pigeon, and its genome is closely related to Tembusu virus strains. Flavivirus isolates with a more than 84% nucleotide sequence homology in the NS5 region are considered to be the same species (Kuno et al., 1998) . So we propose to name this novel flavivirus as \"Avian Temubsu virus, ATMUV.\" Till now, there is no effective method for its prevention except vaccine. The previous studies have shown that ATMUV infection induced an effective antiviral immunity through MDA5 and TLR3-dependent signaling pathways Chen et al., 2016a; Fu et al., 2016) . However, our understanding of the molecular and cellular basis of interaction between the virus and host antiviral immune system is very limited. In this study, we examined the expression profile of key IFNs and IFITMs following ATMUV infection in vivo and in vitro. We found type I, type III IFNs, and immune-related IFITMs, including The viral titers in cell culture supernatants were determined by TCID 50 assay in DEF cells. (C) The mRNA expression of viral genes was examined by qRT-PCR at 36 hpi. The mRNA levels were normalized to the endogenous \u03b2-actin level and the expression in ATMUV infected DF-1 cells expressing empty vector was set to 1.0. The mRNA expression of viral genes in DF-1 cells expressing exogenous IFITMs was compared to that in control cells containing empty vector. Plotted are the average results from three independent experiments (means \u00b1 SD). Statistical significance was determined by one tail Student's t-test analysis. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01. IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3 were significantly upregulated in response to ATMUV infection. Strikingly, the spleen tissue had a high viral load and showed strong innate immune response as compared to other organs. IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 expression levels in spleen were increased significantly at 24 hpi and decreased after this time point, and the mRNA levels of IFITM1 and IFITM2 were also upregulated. Similar results were shown in kidney and bursa of fabricius tissues in infected animals. Although IFN expression in DEFs was triggered and reached the maximum value at 48 hpi, DEFs displayed an apparent CPE by ATMUV infection at this time point. These data suggest that host innate immune response is triggered by ATMUV, but the virus has developed multiple strategies to evade host antiviral immunity. In a recent study, Wang and his co-workers found that ATMUV NS1 could markedly suppress virus-induced IFN-\u03b2 expression by inhibiting RLR receptor signaling . Most flaviviruses are potent in blocking the JAK-STAT pathway to evade the antiviral effects of the host innate immune system (Heim et al., 1999; Basu et al., 2001; Lin et al., 2004; Green et al., 2014) . Thus, further studies are needed to address the precise mechanisms by which ATMUV circumvents the host innate immune response.",

            "text": "Type I and Type III IFNs bind to their receptors, which stimulates the JAK-STAT pathway that triggers various ISG expression. Expression of IFITMs is strongly induced by IFNs (Smith et al., 2013) . Consistent with previous studies (Smith et al., 2013) , our data showed that stimulation of DF-1 cells with chicken IFNs significantly enhanced the expression of IFITMs. Interestingly, we observed that IFITM1 in ATMUV infected DEFs had a faster kinetic response than ATMUV-induced IFNs. Thus, we assessed whether IFITMs expression is totally IFN-dependent. For this, siRNA specifically targeting chicken interferon alpha/beta receptor 1 (chIFNAR1-siRNA) and negative control siRNA (NC-siRNA) were employed in this study. 100 nM chIFNAR1-siRNA or NC-siRNA was transfected into DF-1 cell. Twenty-four hours post-transfection, the cells were infected with ATMUV and harvested at 24 hpi. Interestingly, disruption of endogenous IFNAR1 by siRNA greatly reduced IFITM2 mRNA expression, but only caused modest downregulation of IFITM1 and IFITM3 (Supplementary Figure 6) . The data suggest that chIFITM2 may not share the same IFN-dependent pathways with chIFITM1 and chIFITM3. Previous study has found that murine IFITM3 expression was not only induced by increased expression of type I or II IFNs, but also upregulated by other cytokines such as IL-6 (Bailey et al., 2012) . Other groups also found that expression of IFI-56K, IFI-54K, and ISG56 was induced directly by virus and then triggered secondarily through virus-induced IFNs (Wathelet et al., 1988; Holzinger et al., 2007) . These findings indicate that multiple signaling pathways might be involved in regulation of IFITM expression during the viral infection.",

In order to survive, some viruses such as arenavirus and foot-and-mouth disease virus have evolved multiple strategies to evade the antiviral effects of IFITMs (Bailey et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2016) . Furthermore, human cytomegalovirus could exploit IFITMs to facilitate morphogenesis of virion assembly compartment (Xie et al., 2014) . To investigate the role of IFITM proteins in restricting ATMUV replication, we generated DF-1 cell lines stably disrupting chicken IFITM1, IFITM2, or IFITM3 expression. Indeed, disruption of endogenous IFITM1 and IFITM3 by shRNA greatly enhanced ATMUV infection. Furthermore, ectopic expression of chicken and duck IFITM1 or IFITM3 markedly inhibited ATMUV replication. Interestingly, chIFITM2 was significantly upregulated after ATMUV infection in vitro, but we found that altering IFITM2 expression had mild effect on ATMUV infection. A previous report showed that duck IFITM1 was greatly upregulated after highly pathogenic IAV infection but its antiviral activity was low in vitro (Blyth et al., 2015) . The differences in viral entry mechanisms of IAV and ATMUV in the different types of host cells may account for the differential antiviral activity of IFITM proteins.",

In this study, we observed that IFITM1 increase fold was much higher than those of IFITM2 and IFITM3 by in vivo and in vitro assays. This may be due to high basal expression of IFITM2 and IFITM3 in the cells tested. In addition, we cloned and characterized chicken and duck species of IFITM1 and IFITM3 genes. Despite sharing low amino acid identity between chicken IFITM1 and duck IFITM1 (45.11%) and high amino acid identity between chicken IFITM3 and duck IFITM3 (75.18%), both chicken and duck origin IFITM1 and IFITM3 could effectively restrict ATMUV replication. Certain key amino acids in IMD and CIL domain are conserved in chicken and duck IFITMs, suggesting their importance for functioning of the IFITMs (Smith et al., 2013) .",

(A-C) qRT-PCR was performed to measure interference efficiency of the shRNAs. (D) Viral load in cell culture supernatants was titrated via TCID 50 assay in DEF cells. (E) DF-1 cell lines expressing specific IFITM-shRNA were infected with ATMUV and harvested at 36 hpi, followed by qRT-PCR assay to detect mRNA expression of viral genes. The mRNA levels were normalized to the endogenous \u03b2-actin level and the expression in ATMUV infected DF-1 cell line expressing luc-shRNA control was set to 1.0. mRNA expression in DF-1 cells expressing specific IFITM-shRNA was compared to that in control cells expressing luc-shRNA.",
