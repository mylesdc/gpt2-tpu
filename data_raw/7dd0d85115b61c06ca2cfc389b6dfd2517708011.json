            "text": "Recent molecular diagnostic methods have significantly improved the diagnosis of viral pneumonia in intensive care units (ICUs). It has been observed that 222G/N changes in the HA gene of H1N1pdm09 are associated with increased lower respiratory tract (LRT) replication and worse clinical outcome. In the present study, the frequency of respiratory viruses was assessed in respiratory samples from 88 patients admitted to 16 ICUs during the 2014-2015 winter-spring season in Lombardy. Sixty-nine out of 88 (78.4%) patients were positive for a respiratory viral infection at admission. Of these, 57/69 (82.6%) were positive for influenza A (41 A/H1N1pdm09 and 15 A/H3N2), 8/69 (11.6%) for HRV, 2/69 (2.9%) for RSV and 2/69 (2.9%) for influenza B. Phylogenetic analysis of influenza A/H1N1pdm09 strains from 28/41 ICU-patients and 21 patients with mild respiratory syndrome not requiring hospitalization, showed the clear predominance of subgroup 6B strains. The median influenza A load in LRT samples of ICU patients was higher than that observed in the upper respiratory tract (URT) (p<0.05). Overall, a greater number of H1N1pdm09 virus variants were observed using next generation sequencing on partial HA sequences (codons 180-286) in clinical samples from the LRT as compared to URT. In addition, 222G/N/A mutations were observed in 30% of LRT samples from ICU patients. Finally, intra-host evolution analysis showed the presence of different dynamics of viral population in LRT of patients hospitalized in ICU with a severe influenza infection.",

            "text": "Introduction While, severe bacterial community-acquired pneumonia is a well-known problem, severe viral infections might be underestimated due to low awareness. On the other hand, the introduction of molecular diagnostic methods has significantly improved the epidemiological investigation of viral pneumonia in the ICU in recent years with increased potential for detection of a wide array of viruses. In fact, in recent studies, viruses accounted for 20-50% of total infections in patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with severe respiratory distress [1] [2] [3] [4] . In addition, the emergence of new respiratory viruses such as human coronavirus (hCoV) SARS, hCoV-MERS and influenza A/H1N1pdm09, has further underscored the role of viruses in severe respiratory infections. Still, the role of viral agents other than influenza such as rhinovirus (HRV), parainfluenza viruses 1-4 (hPIV1-4), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and hCoV which are frequently detected in respiratory samples of ICU patients, is not fully appreciated [1, 2] .",

In general, the emergence of inherently more virulent viruses during the course of a given season should not be overlooked [6] ; while, different host factors responsible for the severe outcome of influenza infection have been suggested (i.e. pregnancy and obesity) [7] . More specifically as observed during the 2009 influenza virus (A/H1N1pdm09) pandemic, only a few genetic changes may increase transmissibility, replicative efficiency and tissue tropism range [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . For instance, single amino acid changes (222G/N) in the HA gene are associated with increased virus replication in the lower respiratory tract (LRT) and worse clinical outcome [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . However, it is still unclear how these mutations emerge, evolve, consolidate and/or disappear in the context of dynamic viral population changes during the infection.",

In samples from patients #1 and #2, viral load and the number of variants decreased simultaneously and only the wild-type amino acid (222D) was detected 13 and 8 days after admission. In samples from patient #3, an initial decrease in viral load and number of variants was associated with the presence of wild-type amino acid 222D. However, a sudden increase in viral load and number of variants was associated with the re-emergence of 222A at a low frequency. From patient #4, only LRT samples at days 6 and 10 after onset of symptoms were available and the decrease in both viral load and number of variants was not associated with significant changes in the viral population at position 222.",

The second most identified virus was HRV with a frequency close to 10%, in keeping with a large prospective study describing the aetiology of community-acquired pneumonia in the US [18] . The clinical relevance of non-influenza viral infections in ICU patients remains controversial [19] [20] [21] . However, the impact of non-influenza viruses appears more important than previously thought; thus, these viruses should be included in the diagnostic panel [3, 22] . In this study, A/H1N1pdm09 strains outnumbered A/H3N2 at a ratio approaching 3:1 in patients admitted to ICUs in Northern Italy. This finding is in contrast with the epidemiological scenario observed by sentinel sources of the World Health Organization and National Influenza Center. In fact, a predominance of influenza A/H3N2 strains in Europe [5] and Italy (http://www.iss.it/binary/fluv/cont/Rapporto_2014_2015.pdf) was observed during the same period.",

The difference between viral loads was more evident in paired samples where in all cases except one, viral load was higher in the LRT than URT. Interestingly, in almost 20% of these patients the viral load in the URT was undetectable in the presence of high viral load in the LRT. It is reasonable to hypothesize that in severe infections, the initial replication of influenza in the URT is followed by the spread of influenza in the LRT [23] . At ICU admission, usually several days after the onset of clinical symptoms, the clinical samples are collected for the laboratory diagnosis. At this moment, the influenza virus might have been already cleared from the URT by the immune system, while in the LRT the viral shedding persists [23] . Therefore, our findings underline the importance of appropriate sample collection, especially in patients with severe infection [23, 24] .",

Overall, a greater number of H1N1pdm09 virus variants were observed in the LRT, suggesting different viral kinetic patterns in the URT, as compared to LRT of patients with severe influenza infections. The 222G/N mutations known to be associated with increased clinical severity were observed in 30% of LTR samples of ICU patients. In URT samples (ICU and control patients) only the wild type 222D polymorphism was observed. The frequency of 222G/N changes was in keeping with our previous observations and other reports [8, 10, 17, 29, 30] . Although our data confirm the association between 222G/N mutations and disease severity, over 70% of ICU patients showed no specific HA mutations among viral populations in the lung. Therefore, it is reasonable to hypothesize that more than one virulence determinant is involved in severe influenza infections. Nevertheless, in these patients, comorbidities or per-existing host genetic factors may have contributed to disease severity [31] .",
