This study examined the co-detections, the distribution of viruses, symptoms, and illness burden associated with ARI between December 2012 and March 2013. Methods: Outpatients with ARI were assayed for presence of 18 viruses using multiplex reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (MRT-PCR) to simultaneously detect multiple viruses. Results: Among 935 patients, 60% tested positive for a single virus, 9% tested positive for \u22651 virus and 287 (31%) tested negative. Among children (<18 years), the respective distributions were 63%, 14%, and 23%; whereas for younger adults (18-49 years), the distributions were 58%, 8%, and 34% and for older adults (\u226550 years) the distributions were 61%, 5%, and 32% (P < 0.001). Co-detections were more common in children than older adults (P = 0.01), and less frequent in households without children (P = 0.003). Most frequently co-detected viruses were coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus, and influenza A virus. Compared with single viral infections, those with co-detections less frequently reported sore throat (P = 0.01), missed fewer days of school (1.1 vs. 2 days; P = 0.04), or work (2 vs. 3 days; P = 0.03); other measures of illness severity did not vary.",

Moderate to severe respiratory tract infections may lead patients to seek outpatient medical attention. Yet, only a portion of these medically attended acute respiratory infections (ARI) has been routinely tested to determine their etiology because rapid testing can be expensive and treatment options for viral infections are limited. New assays using multiplex reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reactions (MRT-PCR) are available allowing for relatively rapid detection of multiple virus types and simultaneous comparison of patient characteristics, symptoms, severity of illness and productivity across multiple viruses.",

A previous, similar study [1] used the same methodology to examine ARI in 2011-2012.

Bivariate multinomial regression models assessed the association of patient characteristics with the MRT-PCRs. The dependent variable was the virus group and the independent variables were the participants' personal characteristics. Logistic regression models assessed the association of baseline demographic and clinical characteristics with virus type (single virus infection vs. co-detection). For discrete outcome measures with more than two levels, multinomial logistic regression models were used. One way analysis of variance was used for continuous outcomes. For time-to-event outcomes, Kaplan-Meier curves estimated the cumulative proportion of normal activity. Log rank tests were used to test for differences in the cumulative proportions among the virus groups.

Overall, HRV peaked in December with a second peak in March; influenza A peaked in January; CoV and RSV in February; and influenza B was not evident until late in the season and peaked in April. The overall cumulative distribution of return to usual activities was 1.5% by 1 day, 4.6% by 3 days, 10.9% by 5 days, 17% by 6 days, 29.3% by 7 days, 45.1% by 8 days and 100% by 9 days (data not shown). Table 1 shows the demographic and illness characteristics of patients with five single virus groups and no virus detected. Hispanic ethnicity, vaccination status, and attendance at school outside the home varied significantly by virus category. For example, influenza vaccination was more often reported among those presenting with CoV, HRV and RSV than among those with either influenza A or B; 42% of those <18 years old with influenza A or B attended school outside the home compared with 26.3% of those with no virus detected. Fever and fatigue were more prominent with influenza detection and wheezing was less common with CoV. Use of influenza antiviral medicines varied significantly by virus category; 59% of those with influenza A or B were prescribed an antiviral medication compared with 14.8% of those with other viral infections or 26.2% of those with no viral infection. Temperature at enrollment was higher among those with influenza than those with ARI of other etiology, and baseline severity of illness was greater (lower score) among those with influenza. Days from onset to enrollment (seeking outpatient medical treatment) were greater among those with ARI with no virus detected than those with a viral infection. Table 2 shows the outcomes for patients in the five single virus groups and those with no virus detected. Hours of work missed due to ARI varied significantly by virus group, appearing worse for influenza A and B. Selfreported time to return to normal activity varied by virus group (P = 0.02) and is depicted in Figure 2 . Table 3 shows the distribution of single virus infections and co-detections, with the numbers for co-detections representing viruses detected, not numbers of patients. Single virus infections were detected among 563 (60.2%) patients, co-detections were found among 85 (9.1%) patients and 287 (30.7%) were negative for all tested viruses. The viruses most frequently co-detected were CoV (49 times), RSV (39 times), and influenza A (39 times). The distributions varied by age. For children, the percentages of single virus, multiple viruses, and no virus detected were 63%, 14%, and 23%, respectively; whereas for young adults, the percentages were 58%, 8%, and 34% and for older adults the percentages were 61%, 5%, and 32%, respectively (P < 0.001 for overall distributions; data not shown).",

            "text": "The clinical impact of co-detections is debatable. In the literature, dual infections have been linked to more severe clinical outcomes compared with single virus infections. These studies have included primarily children <5 years, and adults with co-morbidities [10] , and children presenting to emergency departments [11] , or resulted from multiple influenza virus infections [12] . However, in our population of adults and children, we found that co-detections were significantly less common if sore throat was present and did not vary by other symptoms. Moreover, compared with individuals with single viral infections, those with co-detections missed significantly fewer days of school (1.1 vs. 2 days) or work (2 vs. 3 days). A recent study of children attending day care in which no demographic or household variables were related to co-infections, found that fever was less likely with co-infections [13] . Hence, some data emerging from our study and others using newly available, highly sensitive and specific assays for multiple virus infections have not found a relationship with more severe illness whereas others have. Indeed, our data suggest that multiple respiratory virus infections are associated with less severe clinical symptoms particularly fever, and are less detrimental to the patients' quality of life. The co-detections may represent a commensal situation in which the second virus has no effect on the predominant infection but is found with these sensitive tests. The contrast in results between studies on co-detections finding a less versus more severe clinical course may be related to population, test characteristics, time of year, and duration of testing period. Further studies are needed to define underlying viral and host immune mechanisms and outcomes of multiple respiratory virus infections.",

Study limitations include the inability to test an inclusive sample of all of the ARI specimens with the MRT-PCR and the fact that health-seeking behavior during illness is associated with a history of influenza vaccination. The sample size of detected viruses other than influenza, HRV, RSV and coronaviruses were too small for sub-analyses. However, the sample size overall was sufficient to allow confidence in the relationships between characteristics of ARI cases and the viruses associated with them during this time period. Additionally, the viral panel does not contain bacteria, mycoplasma, and all possible respiratory viruses. Sampling took place during the influenza season and may have missed peak seasons for other virus circulation. The study is strengthened by the similarity of methods used in a previous influenza season and allows for comparison of viral activity in two seasons with different influenza epidemiology.",
