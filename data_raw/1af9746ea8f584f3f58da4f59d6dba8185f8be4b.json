Airborne diseases may spread rapidly as people visit different indoor environments and are in frequent contact with others. We constructed a simple indoor contact model for an ideal city with 7 million people and 3 million indoor spaces, and estimated the probability and duration of contact between any two individuals during one day. To do this, we used data from actual censuses, social behavior surveys, building surveys, and ventilation measurements in Hong Kong to define eight population groups and seven indoor location groups. Our indoor contact model was integrated with an existing epidemiological Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, and Recovered (SEIR) model to estimate disease spread and with the Wells-Riley equation to calculate local infection risks, resulting in an integrated indoor transmission network model. This model was used to estimate the probability of an infected individual infecting others in the city and to study the disease transmission dynamics. We predicted the infection probability of each sub-population under different ventilation systems in each location type in the case of a hypothetical airborne disease outbreak, which is assumed to have the same natural history and infectiousness as smallpox. We compared the effectiveness of controlling ventilation in each location type with other intervention strategies. We conclude that increasing building ventilation rates using methods such as natural ventilation in classrooms, offices, and homes is a relatively effective strategy for airborne diseases in a large city.",

Building ventilation is known to be effective for reducing the spread of airborne diseases such as tuberculosis, SARS, smallpox, chicken pox, and influenza in single indoor environments [8-12], but has not been studied at the community level. Ventilation intervention decreases transmission probability by directing the flow of airborne infectious agents away from susceptible persons and/or by removing infectious agents from room air. Because it relies less on individual compliance, ventilation has an advantage over other non-pharmaceutical interventions (e.g., hand washing or mask use). But questions remain. Is ventilation as effective at the community level as other interventions?",

An individual infected in one building may infect others in the building(s) that he/she subsequently visits. People move from one indoor environment to another, and are in frequent contact with others, creating an indoor contact network in which an airborne disease can spread. To study ventilation as a community-level intervention, the disease spread dynamics must be ideally modeled at the individual person and location level for an entire urban social network [14] . Many widely used social contact network models, such as a random network [15] or a small world network [16, 17] , may be too simplistic to describe the complicated dynamic between individuals and indoor environments. Environment parameters such as ventilation cannot be considered in these models, as in these models location is not refined to the individual indoor-space level. More recently, Eubank and colleagues [18, 19] developed a location-based social network model. However, the resources for building a realistic urban network in a large city are generally not available.",

In a large city such as Hong Kong, there are around 7 million people (N P ) and an estimated 3 million indoor locations (N L , as a building can have many indoor locations). Ideally, we need to know the probability and duration of any two people meeting in any one indoor space in Hong Kong at any time. That is, we need to know \"Who meets whom, where, when, and for how long. \" Clearly, to model a large city there is need for a fast algorithm and huge computer storage capacity. The computer storage requirement can be formidably large; it is proportional to the cubic of the population (N 3 P ), assuming that the indoor space population is at the same order of population as in Hong Kong. It is thus unrealistic to trace every individual on an hourly scale in a large city, i.e., when and where each person enters and leaves a room.",

Our indoor contact network model starts with the so-called individual/location approach, which has three stages. Stage 1. Generating both people and indoor space populations. A synthetic population was first generated that includes every individual in Hong Kong. At the same time, a synthetic indoor space (location) was generated that includes every indoor space in Hong Kong. 6,857,100 people were divided into eight population groups (home stayers, office workers, classroom attendees, food service workers, shop workers, drivers, public space workers, and others), and 2,923,035 locations into seven location groups (home, office, classroom, restaurant, shop, transport vehicles, and other public locations). Each individual was assigned a unique person ID and an occupation (population group), and each location a unique location ID, a function (location group), a size, an occupant density, and a ventilation rate. The inclusion of ventilation rate as a characteristic of locations allows us to study for the first time the effect of ventilation on the spread of disease.",

We used the available statistical data on population, buildings, and the probability of people visiting different indoor environments. For example, the probability that students will have lunch in a restaurant, or that a teacher will take a bus to go to work, were estimated according to the available data drawn from social behavior studies and household expenditure surveys.

For our approach, a probability network is preferred, given the uncertainty of individual daily routes. In this people-location probability network, all of the individuals are connected through their favorite locations, see Fig 2. Both individuals and locations are represented by nodes. An edge between an individual node and a location node denotes a connection between the individual and location (i.e., a location visiting). The weight of the edge represents the probability that the individual visits the location in a day. In implementation, location nodes were selected to connect each individual with their favorite locations, and the edges were weighted according to the probability that the individual will visit the location group. A recursion algorithm was used to ensure that the occupants of all of the locations satisfy their limits.",

Also, the effect of mass-vaccination depends on the ability to distribute vaccinations. Vaccinating 100,000 susceptible individuals per day can diminish the infection in all three cases, whereas giving 10,000 vaccinations per day can only diminish the outbreak under the low transmission scenario; it leads to a reduction of less than 20% in the attack rates in the medium and high transmission scenarios. Table 2 shows that higher ventilation rates can significantly reduce the disease transmission; in particular, it can delay and reduce the peak infection. Increasing the household ventilation rate (Policy VEN1) can mostly eliminate an outbreak under the low transmission rate, and is more effective than isolation (Policy ISO) or vaccination (Policy VAC1) under the medium and high transmission rate conditions. Applying isolation and increasing the household ventilation rates together (Policy COM1) largely restricts the outbreak in all three cases, and the number of isolated individuals is also 50 times smaller (less than 0.4% of population) than when isolation is applied alone in the medium transmission scenario.",

In all classrooms, if an infector is introduced to the classroom, the rest of the students will develop infection rapidly (due to the long exposure time and low ventilation rate) and the transmission conditions in different classrooms are similar (similar ventilation rates per person). Natural ventilation was suggested by Lee and Chang [42] to be efficient in increasing the ventilation rates of classrooms. As offices are extremely large hubs in the network, reducing infection risks in offices will delay the peak infection. Hence, increasing ventilation rates in homes is essential to protect the public from infection from airborne diseases, whereas applying targeted control methods such as increasing ventilation rates to large location hubs may delay the rise of the epicurve and provide time for the public to prepare for the outbreak.",

The indoor contact network in Hong Kong has a larger number of vertices with a higher degree of contacts than the people-people contact network in the city of Portland [18] . The highly connected graph developed in this study is potentially related to the common habits of eating out and using public transportation among inhabitants of Hong Kong.",

This study also did not consider the geographical contact distribution, which may have a significant influence on the dynamics of infectious disease transmission [43, 44] ; the local outbreaks cannot be predicted in the current model. Future studies are necessary to evaluate the geographical aspects of the social contact network and the role of possible transmission hubs that are not included in this study such as hospitals.",

Age is not integrated into the indoor contact network model due to the lack of data on age distribution within each population subgroup. In addition, the individual vaccine histories and the presence of super infectors have important effects on predicting the outbreak.

In reality, respiratory infections may have multiple possible transmission routes [45, 46] . The transmission dynamics and the control effects of different methods might shift with the dominant transmission route or routes. However, the aim of the study is to demonstrate the effectiveness of ventilation in combination with other intervention methods in controlling a possible airborne disease outbreak on a social contact network, as well as our ability to simulate different scenarios on the theoretical basis. In another study by the authors [47] , the role of ventilation in controlling the partially airborne influenza was investigated; it was found that increasing the ventilation rate significantly impacts on the transmission dynamics, even when the airborne route only contributes 20% to the total infection risk. Besides, as the methodology of constructing an indoor contact network provided by this study contains information about both individual-based social contact behavior and local environment transmission risks, a similar methodology could be adopted to model the multiple-routes-transmitted respiratory infections in large cities.",

Most studies have applied a quanta generation rate calculated from historical outbreaks [10, 25, 28, 48, 49] . This method might lead to an over-estimation of the infectivity of the diseases due to the super-spreader effect [33] . Furthermore, the number of outbreak cases with sufficient information to estimate the quanta generation rate is very small, and a significant bias will be introduced by this small number of statistical data. However, other infectious diseases outbreak parameters, such as the basic reproductive number, are well documented for the past infectious disease outbreaks. In this study, we provide a method for investigating the correlations between basic reproductive number and quanta generation rate. The quanta generation in the previous outbreak can be estimated from the basic reproductive number by rebuilding the social contact network during the outbreak period.",
