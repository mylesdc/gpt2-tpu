            "text": "Embryonic growth and development of skeletal muscle is a major determinant of muscle mass, and has a significant effect on meat production in chicken. To assess the protein expression profiles during embryonic skeletal muscle development, we performed a proteomics analysis using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) in leg muscle tissues of female Xinghua chicken at embryonic age (E) 11, E16, and 1-day post hatch (D1). We identified 3,240 proteins in chicken embryonic muscle and 491 of them were differentially expressed (fold change \u2265 1.5 or \u2264 0.666 and p < 0.05). There were 19 up-and 32 down-regulated proteins in E11 vs. E16 group, 238 up-and 227 down-regulated proteins in E11 vs. D1 group, and 13 up-and 5 down-regulated proteins in E16 vs. D1 group. Protein interaction network analyses indicated that these differentially expressed proteins were mainly involved in the pathway of protein synthesis, muscle contraction, and oxidative phosphorylation. Integrative analysis of proteome and our previous transcriptome data found 189 differentially expressed proteins that correlated with their mRNA level. The interactions between these proteins were also involved in muscle contraction and oxidative phosphorylation pathways. The lncRNA-protein interaction network found four proteins DMD, MYL3, TNNI2, and TNNT3 that are all involved in muscle contraction and may be lncRNA regulated. These results provide several candidate genes for further investigation into the molecular mechanisms of chicken embryonic muscle development, and enable us to better understanding their regulation networks and biochemical pathways.",

In chicken, skeletal muscle form in the limb from progenitor cells during embryogenesis. These progenitor FIGURE 1 | Functional classification of all annotated proteins in chicken embryonic muscle. (A) Proteins as classified into three main categories by GO analysis: biological process, cellular component, and molecular function. The left y-axis indicates the percentage of a specific category of genes in that category. The right y-axis indicates the number of genes in a category. (B) Proteins as classified into five main categories by KEGG analysis: metabolism, genetic information processing, environmental information processing, cellular processes and organismal systems. The x-axis indicates the percentage genes within that specific category. cells are originated from somites and migrate into the limb bud. Subsequently, they proliferate and differentiate into skeletal muscle in limb (Buckingham et al., 2003) . Numerous regulatory genes involved in myogenesis have been identified, such as Myf5 (myogenic factor 5), MyoD (myogenic differentiation 1), Mrf4 (myogenic regulatory factor 4) MyoG (myogenin), MEF2 (myocyte enhancer binding factor 2), Myostatin, IGF2 (insulinlike growth factors 2), PAX3 (paired box 3), and PAX7 (paired box 7) (Bismuth and Relaix, 2010; Braun and Gautel, 2011) . However, the regulations of skeletal muscle development in the chicken are far from clear, more genes or proteins, and noncoding RNAs and their interactions need to further elucidate. Our previous study identified differentially expressed chicken mRNAs and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) during embryonic skeletal muscle development, and provides a functional interaction network between lncRNAs and protein-coding genes (Li et al., 2017) . However, proteins and mRNA levels do not often directly correlate and proteins also provides post-translational modified information and more direct evidence (Greenbaum et al., 2003; Zhan et al., 2016) . Thus, we aimed to assess the protein expression profiles during embryonic skeletal muscle development for this study.",

Skeletal muscle is an essential component of the animal body and its mass directly correlates with meat production (G\u00fceller and Russell, 2010) . Numerous studies have been identified proteome changes of skeletal muscle at different growth stages in chickens (Doherty et al., 2004; Teltathum and Mekchay, 2009; Liu et al., 2016b) , pigs (Long et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2016) , cattle (Zhang et al., 2010) , and rats (Sp\u00e1cilov\u00e1 et al., 2016) . Embryonic myogenesis involves in a series of complex biological process, which is a major determinant of muscle mass (Buckingham, 2001) . Chicken skeletal muscle also offers an excellent system for developmental proteomics. However, for chicken skeletal muscle, previous proteomic analyses concentrated on days post hatching. For example, Doherty et al. characterized the proteome of layer chicken breast muscle at specified time-points from 1 to 27 days after hatching (Doherty et al., 2004) . Protein expression profiles were also performed in the breast muscle of Thai indigenous chickens at 0, 3, 6, and 18 weeks of age and Beijing-You chickens at ages 1, 56, 98, and 140 days (Teltathum and Mekchay, 2009; Liu et al., 2016b) . In this study, we performed an iTRAQbased proteomic analysis of chicken skeletal muscle at E11, E16, and D1, so we could focus on myogenesis during embryonic development. In the chick, fetal myoblasts are most abundant from E8 to E12, and undergo massive differentiation at E16 to E18 (Hartley et al., 1992; Stockdale, 1992) .",

Myosin light chains (MYL1, MYL2, and MYL3) are components of the myosin complex, and could act as a molecular motor to provide the energy for muscle contraction (Dominguez et al., 1998) . The TNNC1, TNNC2, TNNI1, and TNNI2 are important components of troponin-tropomyosin complex, which has been found play a crucial role in the regulation of muscle contraction (Farah and Reinach, 1995) . The DMD gene encodes dystrophin, that is essential for the development and organization of myofibers in skeletal and cardiac muscles (Muntoni et al., 2003; Ghahramani Seno et al., 2010) . All these proteins were upregulated at D1. Interestingly, the proteins interaction network in Figure 6 were also involved in the pathway of muscle contraction, including TNNC1, TNNC2, TNNI2, TNNT3, MYL1, MYL2, MYL3, and DMD etc. The proteins DMD, MYL3, TNNI2, and TNNT3 were also identified in our lncRNA-proteins interaction network (Figure 7) . The TNNI2 and TNNT3 is the putative cis-target of lnc00068445; DMD is the putative cis-target of lnc00005738; MYL3 is the putative cis-target of lnc00037615 and lnc00037619. These four proteins may regulated by their corresponding lncRNA and together take part in the regulation of muscle development.",

The differentially expressed proteins were mainly involved in the pathway of ribosome, muscle contraction, and oxidative phosphorylation. Several proteins that involved in the pathway of muscle contraction were found may regulated by lncRNA. Overall, the results can provide a more comprehensive insight into the regulation networks and biochemical pathways during embryonic skeletal muscle development in chicken.",
