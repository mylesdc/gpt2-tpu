Approximately 90% of human infections are caused by Cryptosporidium parvum and Cryptosporidium hominis, although over 20 species can infect humans [2] . In immunocompetent patients, cryptosporidiosis is a self-limiting infection of the small intestine that causes watery diarrhoea and can last up to ten days, whereas the infection can become a chronic and life-threatening disease in immunocompromised individuals such as AIDS subjects [3] .",

DNA was also extracted in the same way from referenced dilutions of purified oocysts in triplicate to obtain samples with 10 5 , 10 4 , 10 3 , 100, 10, 1 and a theoretical 0.1 oocysts, and used for a standard curve based on the median crossing threshold (CT) in qPCR experiments. DNA samples from infected mice and referenced dilutions were analysed using real-time PCR assay (qPCR) based on the COWP gene [33] . This assay was tested for sensitivity using reference samples, obtaining positive curves with a single oocyst (CT = 36 in three out of three replicas) and up to a theoretical 0.1 oocysts (CT = 39 in one out of three replicas), and samples producing less than 40 CT were considered positive. COWP primers were synthesised by Primm (Milan, Italy), and TaqMan probe and COWP probe labelled with 5\u2032-hexachlorofluorescein (HEX; \u03bb em = 553 nm) were from TIB Molbiol (Berlin, Germany). Each PCR reaction was completed in a final volume of 25 \u03bcl, comprising 12.5 \u03bcl of LightCycler 480 Probes Master mix containing Fast-Start Taq DNA polymerase, a proprietary buffer including deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs), MgCl 2 at a final concentration of 3.2 mM, 300 nM of each primer, 500 nM of TaqMan probe, and 5 \u00b5l (1/20 of whole intestinal content) as DNA sample.",

            "text": "Control of neonatal cryptosporidiosis is a challenging task because of the lack of appropriate drugs and the difficulties in providing effective immunisation in the early phase of life. Here, we explored the protective effect of anti-C. parvum maternal antibodies transferred to newborns through the placenta during gestation and through the colostrum in the first days of life. To this end, two recombinant peptides (SA35 and SA40) were first immunologically characterised by IP injection in adult mice to evaluate their potential as immunogens. Both peptides, separately and in a mixed formulation, induced specific IgG and IgA responses. SA35 and SA40 peptides have been previously described as immunodominant antigens involved in the maintenance of T-cell response in healthy C. parvum-sensitised individuals [20] . It is important to note that the amino acid sequences of SA35 and SA40 peptides do not show similarities with mammalian proteins, but, by contrast, are also highly conserved in other Cryptosporidium species and particularly in other human pathogens (data not shown). Therefore, it is most likely that antibodies for SA35 and SA40 also react with the strictly related proteins of C. hominis and C. ubiquitum. In this study, it has been demonstrated that IP immunisation with these recombinant peptides is able to support an effective cell-mediated immunity in response to specific stimuli: CCE-, SA35-and SA40-induced specific proliferation in splenocytes from all immunised adult mice. However, maximum proliferative responses to CCE were obtained in splenocytes from mice following IP immunisation with SA35 or the SA35/40 mix (Fig. 3) . The induced cell populations showed a higher percentage of cells expressing CD3+ and CD4+. Moreover, splenocytes from mice immunised with SA35 showed a significant reduction in the percentage of regulatory cells (CD4+/CD25+) compared to the control group, whereas the others did not (Fig. 4) . Overall, the three antigen formulations (SA35, SA40 or SA35/40 mix) induced IFN\u03b3, IL-12 and, to a lesser extent, IL-4 in immunised mice (Table 1) . What is noteworthy is that stimulation with the homologous antigen resulted in the highest level of production of these cytokines even when the splenocytes also responded to stimulation with CCE (Table 1) .",

Indeed, IFN-\u03b3 production is one of the essential functions of CD4+ cells in response to Cryptosporidium antigens [38, 39] . With regard to humoral response, all three antigenic formulations (SA35, SA40 or SA35/40 mix) induced specific IgG, IgG1 and secretory IgA (Fig. 2) . The production of these transferable antibodies is a fundamental requirement in conferring protective immunity for neonates. Therefore, the antigenic SA35/40 mix was used for mucosal immunisation of female mice in order to evaluate the protective effect on their offspring. The",

Analysis of splenocytes from adult mice was carried out on the last day of the experiments. The number of mice is shown in Fig. 1 . Newborn mice born from intranasally immunised mothers were infected with 10 5 oocysts and sacrificed five days later The comparison between C. parvum-infected littermates born from immunised mothers and their respective controls, i.e. C. parvum-infected littermates born from mothers immunised only using a mucosal adjuvant, showed that maternal protection is highly effective with the lower infective dose (5 \u00d7 10 3 ), since there was a 96% reduction in parasitic burden (Fig. 7) . In adult females, mucosal immunisation with the SA35/40 mix leads to a long-lasting (33 weeks) humoral response at systemic and intestinal level (Fig. 5) . Moreover, splenocytes from BALB/c mothers specifically proliferated in response to CCE and the resulting population showed an increase in the percentages of CD3+/CD4+ and CD30+ cells ( Table 2) .",

Conversely, a drastic reduction (96%) in oocyst emission was observed when neonates were infected with a lower dose (5 \u00d7 10 3 oocysts), which still represents a huge amount given the small weight (about 1 g) of newborn mice (Fig. 7) ; in fact, this dose is comparable to a dose of 30 \u00d7 10 7 oocysts in a 60 kg human. These oocyst numbers were tested in the first instance to allow a quantitative analysis of excreted oocysts and of all parasitic forms using flow cytometry, although the 5 \u00d7 10 3 dose yielded parasite amounts below the sensitivity threshold for the instrument. To overcome this technical limitation, IFA/microscopic counting and qPCR were used to evaluate the minimal quantity of parasites in infected mice. Moreover, DNA samples for qPCR were prepared using an ad-hoc automated method in order to reduce handling errors.",

Similarly, T-cell responses were identified after maternal vaccination in newborn mice of a Plasmodium yoelii model, although there was no parallel increase in antibody response [40] . Recent studies indicate that during pregnancy, maternal molecules such as inflammatory cytokines, as well as microbial products, are transferred in utero to the foetus and this influences the foetal immune system [41] .

More recently, heterologous protection was also successfully tested through administration of hyperimmune ovine colostrum in neonate mice [45] .
