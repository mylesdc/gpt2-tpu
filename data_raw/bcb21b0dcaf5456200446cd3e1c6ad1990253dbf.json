Travel restrictions are often suggested as an efficient way to reduce the spread of a contagious disease that threatens public health, but few papers have studied in depth the effects of travel restrictions. In this study, we investigated what effect different levels of travel restrictions might have on the speed and geographical spread of an outbreak of a disease similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).",

Using a stochastic transmission model on both a city level and globally, with each city interconnected by the international aviation network, they produced results in surprising agreement with World Health Organization (WHO) reports of the actual epidemic. With some exceptions, most prominently Japan, all infected countries in the simulation were also present in the WHO reports. The orders of magnitude were also closely matched.",

An intermunicipal journey was defined as a trip between two points where the individual lives, works, or conducts an errand. In other words, we treated a journey between home and work as several trips if the traveler made stops on the way for errands, provided that a municipal border was crossed between each stop.

The matrix elements stood in direct correspondence with the underlying data, weighted for time and population.

Sixty days was chosen as the simulation period, as this gives sufficient time for a possible extinction to occur and for all stochasticity to play out its part in all but the smallest and most distant municipalities. Each scenario started with a single infectious individual in Stockholm, and treated the country as isolated from influx of disease. The traveling restrictions were divided into three levels. In the first level, we used the complete intensity matrix. In the following two, we removed data corresponding to journeys >50 km and journeys >20 km, respectively.

Individuals become infected at a rate proportional to \u03b1 and the number of infected (force of infection). They subsequently become infectious at rate \u03b2, contributing to the force of infection, and recover at rate \u03bd. Thus far, this is a description of a regular random-mixing epidemic model.

As \u03b3 is an infectiousness parameter playing a similar role in the governing equations above as \u03b1, we argue that \u03b1 = 0.55 is an upper bound for \u03b3.

Bear in mind that there was no attempt to correlate the randomness between the simulation sets.

As mentioned, no attempt was made on our part to find the \"true\" value of \u03b3 in the new settings, as no such outbreak data are available for Sweden. This would be considered a flaw for a quantitative study on a SARS outbreak in Sweden. By simulating for different values of the parameter, however, we can be confident in the qualitative conclusion, namely, that the same general behavior can be expected in the unrestricted scenario and in response to the control measures, regardless of \u03b3. The extinction runs hence did not affect the means but their numbers are of course interesting in their own right. The 95% simulation intervals (SI) were calculated by bootstrapping 10 000 samples. By incidence, we mean the number of infectious people. Intermunicipal infections is the percentage of the total number of infected that caught the disease via intermunicipal infection. There are 289 municipalities in Sweden and the population is approximately 8.9 million. In light of the fact that intermunicipal travel heavily influences incidence even at a local level, we may justifiably be concerned about boundary conditions. We treated Sweden as an isolated country, but quite obviously, the incidence will be underestimated for areas with frequent traffic across the borders. This includes in particular the \u00d6resund region around Malm\u00f6, and to a lesser extent, international airports and the small towns bordering Norway and Finland.",

It is worth noting on the travel intensity matrix, where the elements directly reflect the underlying survey data, that there are several proposed alternatives, using smoothing techniques or data-generating simulation. Completing the matrix in such a way would correctly introduce many connections that are missing from our data, but a substantial number would be falsely represented, and could endanger the validity of the model due to unforeseen stochastic mechanisms.
