Mass spectrometry-based techniques are also routinely used to assess glycosylation and other post-translational modifications, disulfide bond linkage, and scrambling as well as for the detection of host cell protein contaminants in the field of biopharmaceuticals. The role of mass spectrometry in vaccine development has been very limited but is now expanding as the landscape of global vaccine development is shifting towards the development of recombinant vaccines. In this review, the role of mass spectrometry in vaccine development is presented, some of the ongoing efforts to develop vaccines for diseases with global unmet medical need are discussed and the regulatory challenges of implementing mass spectrometry techniques in a quality control laboratory setting are highlighted.

Appropriately, the vaccine landscape is changing from traditional vaccine approaches to cost-effective, highly scalable, and safe recombinant vaccines. 9, 10 Using recombinant DNA technology, antigens are expressed in yeast, Escherichia coli, baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS), or mammalian cell lines. [11] [12] [13] Recombinant antigens are engineered to mimic the first step of virus attachment to the cell surface which is mediated by specific glycoproteins. The expressed recombinant antigens undergo multiple purification cycles to produce highly purified vaccines. 14, 15 In order for recombinant vaccines to be acceptable to regulatory authorities, in-depth analytical characterization needs to be performed In this review, we focus on the expanding role of mass spectrometry in vaccine development, irrespective of the route of production. We also highlight the regulatory challenges and limitations of mass spectrometry-based techniques which constrain its further implementation as a quality control batch release assay in cGMP manufacturing.",

Glycosylation play a fundamental role in antigen conformation, folding, stability, solubility, and importantly, immune response. 16, 17 Plants, yeasts, and non-human cell lines generate glycans that are not compatible and bioactive within human hosts. 18 Thus, about 70% of all recombinant glycoproteins are produced in mammalian-based expression systems such as Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells. 19 Analytical characterization of a glycoprotein is challenging as there is inherent unpredictability associated with the glycans; they are either macroheterogeneous (potential glycan site in the protein not glycosylated) or microheterogeneous (different glycan structures found on the same site in the expressed protein). Glycosylation analysis is performed to understand the nature of structural heterogeneity of glycans, quantify them, and more importantly to determine where glycosylation occurs (site specific analysis). Mass spectrometry based techniques are valuable tool for detecting and investigating glycosylation ( Figure 2 ). Although MS-based glycosylation analysis is not without limitations, the advances in MS instrumentation and glycan analysis software have led to increased resolution, automated identification, quantitative determination, and accurate structural characterization. 16, 20, 21 Another critical quality attribute (CQA) of glycoprotein is intramolecular disulfide bonds (S-S linkages); they ensure correct folding, functional activity and stability. Incorrect formation of disulfide bonds can cause protein misfolding which tends to promote aggregation which could result in an unwarranted immune response.",

The method workflow included protease treatment, sequential glycosidase digestion (first treated with Endo H and then digested with PNGase F in O 18 -water) followed by LC-MS/MS analysis (Figure 4). The authors determined that almost all of the glycan sites were occupied for the soluble Env trimers. The reported method has the potential to serve as a robust tool to facilitate the rational design and development of vaccine immunogens. 62 Two HIV-1 subtype C gp120 Envs (1086.C and TV1.C) are being currently evaluated in a pivotal Phase IIb/III efficacy trial in South Africa (HVTN702) to assess if HIV infection among adults can be prevented. This trial was designed to confirm and extend the partial protection seen against HIV-1 infection in the RV144 Thai trial (https://www.niaid.nih.gov/news-events/first-new-hiv-vaccineefficacy-study-seven-years-has-begun). Wang et al carried out extensive LC-MS/MS characterization for these vaccine antigens (reference standard, representative material equivalent to cGMP material) to confirm their sequence integrity, their biophysical immunogenicity, glycosylation patterns (both N-linked and O-linked), and disulfide linkages. Data from this report demonstrated the immunogenicity of the gp120 antigens, provided comprehensive characterization of the molecules, set the benchmark for assessment of current and future CTM lots, and established the physicochemical groundwork for interpretation of future clinical trial data. 63 As an example of the applicability of MS-based methods, trimeric Env glycoproteins commercially manufactured under current good manufacturing practice (cGMP) were analyzed using a hybrid linear trap/Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FTICR) mass spectrometer coupled with a Waters nanoAcquity UPLC system. The BG505.SOSIP.664 HIV-1 vaccine candidate cGMP was produced from a 200L bioreactor and extensive characterized for molecular structure, disulfide bond patterns, and N-linked glycosylation profile. This is the first report of a trimeric HIV vaccine clinical trial material produced under cGMP conditions being comprehensively characterized using mass spectrometry. The methods reported in this study should pave the way for the cGMP production of other native-like Env glycoprotein trimers of various designs. 15 MS has been instrumental for deciphering the structure of these complex glycoproteins being developed and tested as HIV vaccines as exemplified above.

The SRID method to quantify the HA content of influenza vaccines relies on strain-specific reference reagents the availability of which may cause delays in the formulation of the influenza vaccine especially during a pandemic outbreak. In a WHO workshop organized in 2010 in Ottawa, Canada, it was decided to explore alternative approaches for quantification of HA content to speed up the vaccine delivery process in future responses to pandemic influenza and in seasonal vaccine release. 68 Various promising methods as alternatives to SRID assay are currently being developed including HPLC and MS. The primary objective is to have a method that can be used to perform quantitation without reference standards, and thus, to formulate virus strains without delay owing to reference reagent availability. 69 MS-based proteomics methods for measuring a HA strain content are being developed at the Centers for Vaccine Evaluation (CVE) in Canada and the National Center For Environmental Health (NCEH) in the Centers for Disease Control And Prevention (CDC) strains and to measure each of the strains in the influenza vaccine. The researchers at NCEH-CDC have been specifically working on the evaluation of isotope dilution mass spectrometry (IDMS) methods for accurate quantitation of HA in primary influenza standards since 2008. LC-MS/MS methods involving isotope dilution mass spectrometry (IDMS) in conjunction with multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) have been applied to detect targeted peptides using isotopically labeled peptide standards for the absolute quantification of HA subtypes in the influenza vaccine (Figure 5). The LC-IDMS-MRM assay is applicable to trivalent matrices, and can be used without sample cleanup and in the presence of detergents and other proteins. More importantly, the IDMS method was performed without using any strain-specific virus reference standards for the quantification of HA in the avian influenza H5N1 vaccine. However, direct comparison of results obtained by LC-IDMS-MRM and those obtained by SRID was not performed. 70-72 In the spring of 2013, the Chinese Health and Family Planning Commission notified the WHO of the first confirmed human infection with avian influenza (H7N9) virus and LC-IDMS-MRM which had been developed to quantify HA and NA in H7N2, H7N7, and H7N9 influenza [A/Netherlands/219/2003 (H7N7) and A/Shanghai/2/2013(H7N9] was used to analyze these samples to confirm the H7N9 strain.73 In a separate study, the HA antigen yields of the vaccine strain [A/Puerto/Rico/8/34 (PR8)] was also determined using LC-IDMS-MRM.74 The researchers at NCEH-CDC also demonstrated a unique quantification of immunoreactive viral influenza proteins by immunoaffinity capture followed by IDMS-MRM (IC-IDMS-MRM).

Nevertheless, after a decade of steady partnership with vaccine developers, MS has expanded from a niche application to an enabling platform for vaccine development.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS V.K.S is supported by the grants funded to IAVI and made possible by the support of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (grants OPP1153692 and OPP1147661) and other donors.

There are continuing efforts to develop a vaccine for Chikungunya, and currently a clinical trial of experimental vaccines to prevent infection with Chikungunya virus is ongoing.93 MS-based methods have been used to characterize the experimental Chikungunya (CHIKV) virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine. In one of the studies, a RP-HPLC method was developed to separate capsid, E1, and E2 proteins in CHIKV VLP vaccine with good resolution with theseparated protein components verified by MALDI-TOF MS. In the same study, the post-translational modifications on the viral glycoproteins E1 and E2 were further identified by intact protein mass measurements with LC-MS. The RP-LC-MS method was used, in addition to characterizing the PTMs, for monitoring both the product purity during process development and assessing product stability during formulation development. 94 In another study a HILIC LC method with fluorescence MS detection was performed to characterize the N-glycosylation patterns of CHIKV VLPs. The developed method was used to monitor glycosylation during CHIKV VLPs vaccine process development to ensure batch consistency. 95 2.6 | Meningococcal Neisseria meningitides (meningococcus) is a gram-negative bacterium and causes meningitis and other forms of meningococcal disease such as meningococcemia; a life-threatening sepsis. There are two types of FDA-approved vaccines for protection against meningococcal disease; meningococcal conjugate vaccines (Menveo\u00ae and Menactra\u00ae are quadrivalent vaccines for serogroups A, C, W135, and Y) and serogroup B meningococcal vaccines (Bexsero\u00ae and Trumenba\u00ae).",

The Hi3 approach uses the intensity of the MS signal response for the three most intense tryptic peptides toperform absolute quantitation.80 The three recombinant proteins in the Bexsero\u00ae vaccine are the active components and Hi3 label-free LC-MS E methodology was used to qualitatively and quantitatively characterize each of these three proteins. The Hi3 MS method was performed as an additional characterization in addition to the standard quality control testing for vaccine batch release.100 Trumenba\u00ae is also a well-characterized vaccine, composed of two factor H binding protein (fHbp) variants that were recombinantlyexpressed in E. coli as native lipoproteins: rLP2086-A05 and rLP2086-B01. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS) were used to analyze the composition of fatty acids released from rLP2086-A05 and rLP2086-B01 and for complete characterization of the primary structure of both recombinant lipoproteins. The LC-MS analysis was carried out using an Acquity UHPLC/UV system interfaced to an ultrahigh-resolution electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics maXis). 101 2.7 | Role of mass spectrometry in the other vaccine candidates Following are some of the other literature reports that also illustrated the role of MS-based techniques during vaccine development and manufacturing. Hecolin\u00ae, Innovax was the first VLP-based vaccine against hepatitis E virus (HEV) obtained from E. coli and was licensed by the FDA of China in 2011. This VLP vaccine consists of a truncated, recombinant HEV capsid protein (p239) expressed in E. coli that spontaneously forms a VLP particle of \u223c20-30 nm in diameter. 102 Several analytical methods including LC-MS peptide mapping were employed to examine the quality, size and stability of the p239 protein comprising this VLP vaccine. To ensure consistency in terms of size and quality, multiple batches of commercial scale p239 containing VLPs were characterized by Size Exclusion Chromatography and LC-MS methods. 103 Cervarix\u00ae, is a Human papillomavirus (HPV) types 16 and 18 vaccine licensed in 2009. HPV infection can cause the development of cervical cancer, which is the second most common cause of death in women worldwide from cancer. 104 Although multiple types of HPVs can lead to cervical cancer in humans, types 16 and 18 are responsible for \u223c70% of cases. 105 LC-MS peptide mapping was performed to confirm the primary sequences of the recombinant L1 protein which is the major antigenic protein of the capsid of HPV types 16 and 18. A peptide sequence coverage of \u223c97% was observed for both HPV 16 and 18 VLPs. Additionally, one post-translational modification, N-terminal acetylation, was also identified in the LI viral proteins within the VLPs. The LC-MS peptide mapping was used to verify the batch to batch consistency and identify post-translational modifications that can occur during protein expression and purification. 104,106 2.7.3 | Nipah virus (NiV) No therapeutics or vaccines are currently approved for use in humans against Nipah virus (NiV), an emerging, highly pathogenic, zoonotic virus from the Paramyxoviridiae family. Soluble glycoprotein and virus vector platforms are being developed for protection against NiV but the sporadic nature of NiV outbreaks makes large scale Phase III clinical trials difficult to plan. 107 In a very interesting recent application of MS",

            "text": "There is always some reluctance to implement new methods in the quality control/cGMP environment and, in the case of MS, there are multiple misconceptions regarding the technique. Although MS is not without limitations, some of the misconceptions relating to reproducibility and validation are overstated. To implement a method in the QC environment, the method has to be validated to demonstrate the method's accuracy, precision, intermediate precision, specificity, linearity, limit of detection, and limit of quantitation. Furthermore, appropriate system suitability controls or calibrators are part of the method to ensure repeatability. All of these parameters and controls ensure that during the performance of the assay, no variability between different instruments and operators arises. Unfortunately, some aspect of these validation activities are inherently challenging for a MS-based method. Thus, the burden of proof lies with the vaccine developer to convince a regulator that the MS-based method is a phase appropriate release test without regulatory guidelines applicable to this class of drugs. It is clear from the author's perspective that classical validation regulations as stated in the ICH guidelines are unsuitable for MS-based methods. In the last decade, some of the conventional gel-based or plate-based release assays have been replaced by HPLC or capillary electrophoresis (CE) methods in the QC environment. These HPLC-or CE-based assays are used to monitor aggregation, fragmentation, clipping, and for content determination. As the application of MS in the vaccine QC environment is an evolving story, the challenge of convincing regulators should be directed toward highlighting MS capabilities as has been shown in the multiple examples in this manuscript. For those working in this field, it will be important to present MS data testing multiple quality attributes of the sample in the same analytical run in combination with HPLC/CE methods or by performing MS analysis to validate simpler HP/UPLC assays used to assess batch to batch consistency. In this way, comparative data sets could demonstrate what the authors believe is the ultimate utility of MS-based methods for QC release of vaccines. The main rational for the MS-based methods in the QC/cGMP environment should not be to replace the existing methods. Rather, it",
