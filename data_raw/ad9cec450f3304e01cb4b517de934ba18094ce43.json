CAV infects bone marrow-derived cells, resulting in severe anaemia and immunosuppression in young chickens and a compromised immune response in older birds. We investigated the molecular epidemiology of CAV in sick chickens in China from 2014 to 2015 and showed that the CAV-positive rate was 13.30%, in which mixed infection (55.56%) was the main type of infection. We isolated and identified 15 new CAV strains using different methods including indirect immunofluorescence assay and Western Blotting. We used overlapping polymerase chain reaction to map the whole genome of the strains. Phylogenetic analyses of the obtained sequences and related sequences available in GenBank generated four distinct groups (A-D). We built phylogenetic trees using predicted viral protein (VP) sequences. Unlike CAV VP2s and VP3s that were well conserved, the diversity of VP1s indicated that the new strains were virulent. Our epidemiological study provided new insights into the prevalence of CAV in clinical settings in recent years in China.",

They also trigger several serious diseases in animals as causative agents. In particular, chicken anaemia virus (CAV), a member of family Anelloviridae genus Gyrovirus, is the etiological agent of chicken infectious anaemia [2] . CAV infects several bone marrow-derived cells which results in severe anaemia and immunosuppression in young chickens. In terms of older birds, CAV can jeopardize the immune responses [3, 4] . Since its first reported in 1979 [2] , CAV infection has become epidemic among chicken populations on a global scale [5] [6] [7] . CAV also has dramatic financial impact in a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 areas of intensive chicken farming. Vaccination is generally used to contain the spread of the virus [8] . In a recent study, a novel human gyrovirus was isolated from a skin swab and designated as human Gyrovirus (HGyV) [9] . Since Circovirus shares partial homology to CAV, the identification of HGyV signals possible threats for human pathogenesis, further investigation is yet required.",

VP1 is the major structural protein while the VP2 is a replicase with dual-specificity phosphatase activity [12] .

We found that coinfection was the main infection type of CAV. In addition, we analysed the characteristics of the new CAV sequenced strains together with those available in GenBank.

All the sequences had high levels of nucleotide similarity to the reference strain Cux-1 (Germany, M55918), with NX1501 having the lowest level of nucleotide similarity (97.4%) and the strains HLJ14101 and HJ15125 having the highest level of nucleotide similarity (98.0%). The obtained sequences had a high level of nucleotide similarity with each other, the divergence is only 1.0% (JS15165 and JS15166) to 2.5% (HLJ1508 and JL15120). Phylogenetic analysis at the nucleotide level of the 15 new CAV genome sequences together with 40 reference sequences including Cux-1, CIA-1 (USA, L14767), TR20 (Japan, AB027470), SMSC-1 (Malaysia, AF285882), and 3-1 (Malaysia, AF390038 was conducted. All sequences were clustered into four distinct sequence groups (A, B, C, and D), with bootstrap values of 84, 95, and 100, respectively (Fig 2) . In addition, Group A comprised of six distinct subgroups based on the shape of tree branches. The Asian sequences isolated from mainland China, Taiwan, Japan, and South Korea belonged to Subgroup A1. Four Chinese sequences and the American sequence 98D02152 (AF311892) were the members of Subgroup A2. Subgroup A3 contained only one sequence (01-4202 (DQ991394)). Subgroup A4 comprised two Malaysian and one Chinese strain. Cux-1, two European sequences, and two Chinese sequences constituted Subgroup A5. CIA-1, other two European sequences, and three Chinese sequences belonged to Subgroup A6. Group B comprised only one sequence (82-2 (D31965)), and Group C comprised two Chinese strains (SD22 (DQ141673) and SD24 (AY999018)). Group D consisted of various region sourced sequences including strains from North America, South America, Australia, and Asia. Overall, all the sequences in this study belonged mainly to Subgroup A1 (14/15, 93.33%), indicating that the main CAV prevalent isolates possessed the typical Asian virus characteristics in whole genome sequence, except strain HLJ15108 (1/15, 6.67%) which belonged to Subgroup A6 with a unique mutation (Fig 2) .

However, nine amino acids sites (22, 141, 151, 229, 254, 287, 294, 370, and 447) in VP1 had at least three substitutions each, while there was only one amino acid site (28) in VP2 and two amino acid sites (25 and 81) in VP3.",

Moreover, we analysed the sequences compared with the reported information that covered a more extensive strain distribution than ever before. Based on our investigation, a high positive rate (13.30%) of CAV was detected in sick chickens. Especially, the morbidity and mortality were considerably enhanced when chicks are dually infected with CAV and MDV, REV, or infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV), probably because of the virus-induced immunosuppression [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] . Table 1 showed the infection type of samples collected in 2015, out of all the 72 CAVpositive samples, there were 35 (48.6%) samples were detected as MDV positive (18 dual infection; 15 triple infection; 2 quadruple infection), but other viral pathogens showed a similar ratio that was not particularly high, therefore, meaning MDV and CAV were the most common co-infection type in this investigation, as believed that outbreaks of MD in birds most are linked with CAV co-infection [34] , which should arouse more attention. It is known that with CAV infected commercial chickens, lymphocytic depletion of the bursa often leads to lymphocytic depletion of the thymus [35, 36] . Therefore, in case of commercial flocks, immunosuppression by alternative viral agents, such as IBDV or MDV, is crucial in the outcome of CAV infection. Certain strains of reovirus can be immunosuppressive in chickens [37] , which demonstrates the reovirus has strong link to the pathogenicity of CAV [37] .",

With most of the variation in the VP1 coding region, generally less than 5% of limited genetic variation is known among isolates [3, [45] [46] [47] . In the case of predicted amino acid sequences, minor differences have been noted particularly in the VP1 amino acid sites 139-151. The observed differences in the hypervariable region had impact on the predicted protein structure of VP1 [48] [49] [50] . In this study, the phylogenetic analysis of VP1 embodied the diversity of CAV, while the VP2 and VP3 embodied the conservatism. The non-structural VP2 protein probably acts as a scaffold protein during virion assembly, ensuring that VP1 folds correctly [51, 52] , which can also induce apoptosis [53] . VP3, also known as apoptin [54] . Based on its ability to mediate cell death selectively in cells that have encounter an oncogenic transformation, VP3 has drawn a lot of attention [55, 56] . The localization of VP3 in infected cells are affected by presented threonine (T), which may be phosphorylated, at amino acid sites 20, 56, 61 and 114 [57] . In our study, we detected T residues in all the sequences, indicating conservatism that may contribute to the function of these two non-structural proteins and to the lifecycle of CAV.",

            "text": "The amino acid site 394 in VP1 was reported to be a major genetic determinant of virulence [16] . CAV strains are highly pathogenic if glutamine (Q) is present or less pathogenic if histidine (H) is present [6, 58, 59] . All the new isolates in this study had glutamine (Q) at amino acid site 394, indicating that all strains were highly pathogenic. At amino acid site 89, the attribution to the VP1 amino acid is due to the pathogenicity and monoclonal antibody reactivity differences between two molecularly cloned and highly passaged CAV strains [53] . The study of other mutations (I75, L125, E141, and E144) regarding attenuation has been reported. Renshwa et al. [40] proposed that Q139 and/or Q144 has influence on the rate of replication or dissemination of infection in MDCC-MSB1 cells. von B\u00fclow and Fuchs [55] stated the attenuation of Cux-1 was found after passages (P49) in cell culture. Whereas according to Todd et al. [56] , Cux-1 became considerably less pathogenic at P173 in MDCC-MSB1 cells. As reported by Chowdhury et al. [52] , two Malaysian CAV strains were partly attenuated at p6 and one was further attenuated at P123 in MDCC-MSB1 cells. Both 3-1P60 (AY040632) and SMSC- 1P60 (AF390102) had substitutions M157 and S287. The characteristics of the critical amino acid residues in the VP1 from the new isolates in this study indicated that although almost all the strains were virulent, some had the features of low virulent or attenuated viruses. Therefore, in this study the CAV with low or attenuated virulent features were probably mixed as a contaminant in various vaccines [8] , and recover their virulence in the host. Consequently, monitoring and improving the quality of vaccines may be a useful way to control the prevalence of CAV. Using high quality chicks and embryos (CAV-free) in the vaccines production process will be a good option. Furthermore, it is necessary to eliminate and replace the CAV positive chickens. Sequences in this study (green closed square) are named as mentioned in the main text. Sequences from GenBank are named by the country name followed by the accession number. The four major groups were identified as A, B, C, and D as well as subgroups A1, A2, B1, and B2 in blue, green, yellow, and red, respectively. The percentages of replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered together in the bootstrap test (1,000 replicates) are shown next to the branches.",
