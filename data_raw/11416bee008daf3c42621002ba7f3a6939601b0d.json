            "text": "Tetherin is an interferon-inducible antiviral protein that inhibits the release of a broad spectrum of enveloped viruses by retaining virions at the surface of infected cells. While the role of specific tetherin domains in antiviral activity is clearly established, the role of glycosylation in tetherin function is not clear. In this study, we carried out a detailed investigation of this question by using tetherin variants in which one or both sites of N-linked glycosylation were mutated (N65A, N92A, and N65,92A), and chemical inhibitors that prevent glycosylation at specific stages of oligosaccharide were added or modified. The single N-linked glycosylation mutants, N65A and N92A, efficiently inhibited the release of Vpu-defective human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). In contrast, the non-glycosylated double mutant, N65,92A, lost its ability to block HIV-1 release. The inability of the N65,92A mutant to inhibit HIV-1 release is associated with a lack of cell-surface expression. A role for glycosylation in cell-surface tetherin expression is supported by tunicamycin treatment, which inhibits the first step of N-linked glycosylation and impairs both cell-surface expression and antiviral activity. Inhibition of complex-type glycosylation with kifunensine, an inhibitor of the oligosaccharide processing enzyme mannosidase 1, had no effect on either the cell-surface expression or antiviral activity of tetherin. These results demonstrate that high-mannose modification of a single asparagine residue is necessary and sufficient, while complex-type glycosylation is dispensable, for cell-surface tetherin expression and antiviral activity. ectodomain, and a C-terminal glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor [10, 14, 15] . The CT of tetherin contains an \"STS\" sequence that is implicated in ubiquitylation, and a highly-conserved tyrosine-based motif, \"YxxY\", that is essential for clathrin-dependent endocytosis of tetherin, and activation of nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) [16] [17] [18] [19] . The TM and GPI anchor provide two membrane anchors that enable tetherin to tether virions with one domain in the viral envelope and the other in the plasma membrane (PM) of the host cell. The specific sequence of the TM domain is implicated in the interaction between tetherin and its antagonists such as Vpu. The ectodomain of human tetherin contains three Cys residues that are required for the formation of homodimers [15, 20] . Du Pont et al. recently demonstrated that disulfide bonds are not required for maintaining the coiled-coil or dimeric structure of tetherin, however, dimerization is necessary for tetherin's antiviral activity [21] . The ectodomain also contains two Asn residues at positions 65 and 92 that are post-translationally modified with N-linked oligosaccharides [14, 15, 20, 22] . Deletion of the CT, TM, CC, or GPI domains, or mutating the Cys residues that are required for protein dimerization, abrogates the ability of tetherin to inhibit virus release [1, 15, 20] .",

Many of these viruses have evolved diverse strategies to antagonize tetherin. HIV-1 Vpu counteracts human tetherin by reducing its cell-surface expression via lysosomal and proteasomal degradation [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] or by trapping tetherin intracellularly and/or preventing its recycling back to the PM [1,2,32,35-38]. The specificity of HIV-1 Vpu towards tetherin antagonism also varies from species to species. HIV-1 Vpu counteracts tetherins from human, chimpanzee, and gorilla; however, it is relatively inactive against tetherin from other non-human primates and non-primates [28, [39] [40] [41] [42] . Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) and HIV-2, which do not encode a vpu gene, antagonize tetherin through their Nef and envelope (Env) proteins, respectively, in part through an intracellular sequestration mechanism [29, 39, [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] .",

The requirement for tetherin glycosylation in the inhibition of virus release remains controversial. Early studies reported that N-linked glycosylation of Asn 65 (N65) and 92 (N92) is important for the inhibition of HIV-1 release [15, [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] . However, other studies found that mutating N65 and N92 had a negligible effect on tetherin restriction of HIV-1 release [20, 55, 56] . Some studies reported a correlation between tetherin restriction of virus release and tetherin cell-surface expression [15, 50] , while others did not observe this correlation [20, 53, 54, 57] . While some studies were carried out with human tetherin, others used tetherins from other species. Studies also differed in their use of viral system to examine tetherin restriction; some studies were carried out with 20, 50, 53, 54] whereas others used feline immunodeficiency virus [49,54], prototypical foamy virus [56], xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus [51], bovine leukemia virus [52], severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-Coronavirus [57], Lassa fever virus, and Marburg viruses [55].",

N-linked glycosylation is initiated in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) with the cotranslational transfer of a high-mannose oligosaccharide moiety to Asn residues in Asn-X-Ser/Thr motifs (where X is any amino acid except Pro) in the target protein. Trimming of the high-mannose side chains occurs in the ER and Golgi apparatus, and additional sugars (e.g., galactose, fucose, and sialic acid) are attached to generate complex side chains. The glycoprotein is then exported to the PM through the secretory pathway [58] . When transiently overexpressed in 293T cells, several forms of tetherin are detected: the non-glycosylated 23-kDa species, and forms bearing high-mannose modification on either (\u224824.5 kDa) or both (\u224826 kDa) Asn 65 and 92, and complex-type carbohydrates at either or both positions (\u224832 to 40 kDa) [1, 15, 34, 59] .",

Mammalian cells encode a large number of incompletely characterized factors that impede virus replication at various stages of the virus replication cycle. These inhibitory, or \"restriction\", factors are either expressed constitutively or are induced by type-I interferon (IFN). One such restriction factor that interferes with a late stage of the viral replication cycle is tetherin (also known as bone marrow stromal antigen 2 (BST2), cluster of differentiation 317 (CD317) or HM1.24), which inhibits the release of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and is counteracted by the HIV-1 accessory protein Vpu [1, 2] . Tetherin is expressed constitutively in terminally differentiated B cells and T cells, and was identified as a marker for bone marrow stromal cells and some cancer cells [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . An~180 amino acid, type II integral membrane glycoprotein, tetherin is localized in lipid rafts at the cell surface and on intracellular membranes [10, 14] . Tetherin is a homodimeric glycoprotein that contains a short, N-terminal cytoplasmic tail (CT), a transmembrane (TM) domain, a rod-like coiled-coil (CC) In this study, we carried out a detailed investigation of whether tetherin glycosylation is essential for its ability to inhibit HIV-1 release. We employed glycosylation-site tetherin mutants (N65A, N92A, and N65,92A) and chemical inhibitors of the glycosylation pathway. We observed that oligosaccharide modification of one of the two sites of tetherin N-linked glycosylation is necessary and sufficient for tetherin-mediated restriction of HIV-1 release, while complex-type glycosylation is dispensable for tetherin antiviral function.",

To define the role of N-linked glycosylation of human tetherin in HIV-1 release we used two molecular clones that lack a functional Vpu: a Vpu-deletion mutant pNL4-3Udel [61] , and pNL4-3delVpu [62] , which has a stop codon at amino acid residue 35 of Vpu. We transfected 293T cells, which do not express endogenous tetherin, with WT and Vpu-defective HIV-1 and analyzed virus release in the presence of WT and glycosylation-defective single (N65A or N92A) or double (N65,92A) mutants of human tetherin. As shown in Figure 1 , WT human tetherin inhibited the release of both delVpu and Udel HIV-1 by five-fold, whereas the release of WT (Vpu+) HIV-1 was not significantly reduced under the same conditions. Vpu expression reduced tetherin levels (compare Figure 1 lanes 2, 4, and 9) as reported previously [26, [28] [29] [30] [31] 34] . The double mutant, N65,92A, was unable to inhibit HIV-1 release (quantified in Figure 1B ). This lack of inhibitory activity was not due to reduced expression levels of the N65,92A mutant, as this mutant was expressed at higher levels than WT or the single Asn mutants ( Figure 1A ). The glycosylation of tetherin does not appear to be critical for its stability, as both single and double mutants are expressed at least as well as the WT. As reported previously [15, 20] , the single mutants, N65A and N92A, inhibited the release of both delVpu and Udel particles to a similar extent as WT tetherin ( Figure 1B) . These studies indicate that glycosylation of at least one Asn of human tetherin is necessary and sufficient for the inhibition of HIV-1 release under these conditions.",

As shown in Figure 1C , treating cells with tunicamycin resulted in a complete loss of glycosylation of WT tetherin, as demonstrated by the observation that the mobility of this tetherin species matched that of the non-glycosylated double mutant (N65,92A). Consistent with the above data with the glycosylation-site mutants, the complete loss of glycosylation imposed by tunicamycin treatment had little effect on tetherin expression, confirming that unlike some other glycoproteins, such as HIV-1 Env [65] , tetherin stability does not require glycosylation. Interestingly, tunicamycin treatment significantly disrupted the ability of WT tetherin to inhibit the release of Vpu-defective HIV-1 ( Figure 1C ,D). The 3-fold increase in virus release upon tunicamycin treatment was similar to that observed upon mutating both N65 and N92 ( Figure 1C ,D). Tunicamycin treatment had no effect on virus release in the presence of the non-glycosylated tetherin mutant N65,92A. These results support the conclusion that glycosylation of tetherin is necessary for its ability to inhibit HIV-1 release.",

As shown in Figure 1C , treating cells with tunicamycin resulted in a complete loss of glycosylation of WT tetherin, as demonstrated by the observation that the mobility of this tetherin species matched that of the non-glycosylated double mutant (N65,92A). Consistent with the above data with the glycosylation-site mutants, the complete loss of glycosylation imposed by tunicamycin treatment had little effect on tetherin expression, confirming that unlike some other glycoproteins, such as HIV-1 Env [65] , tetherin stability does not require glycosylation. Interestingly, tunicamycin treatment significantly disrupted the ability of WT tetherin to inhibit the release of Vpu-defective HIV-1 ( Figure 1C ,D). The 3-fold increase in virus release upon tunicamycin treatment was similar to that observed upon mutating both N65 and N92 ( Figure 1C ,D). Tunicamycin treatment had no effect on virus release in the presence of the nonglycosylated tetherin mutant N65,92A.

Some authors reported that the cell-surface expression of the N65,92A mutant was significantly reduced [15, 20] , slightly reduced [54, 57] , or not reduced [53] relative to that of WT tetherin. To measure the cell-surface expression of the glycosylation-defective mutant, we expressed WT and N65,92A tetherin in which the HA tag was inserted at residue 154 in the extracellular CC domain and stained with anti-HA antibody as detailed in the Materials and Methods Section. The N65,92A double mutant tetherin was expressed at lower levels on the cell surface relative to the WT ( Figure 2A ). To increase the cell-surface expression of mutant tetherin, we transfected 293T cells with increasing amounts of WT and N65,92A tetherin expression vector. Although there was a proportional increase in the total cellular expression of tetherin with increasing amounts of transfected DNA for both WT and N65,92A tetherin ( Figure 2B ), the median fluorescence intensity of mutant tetherin was not increased proportionally with the increasing amounts of the double mutant. This observation supports the conclusion that the N65,92A tetherin is defective for cell-surface expression ( Figure 2A ).

Next, we asked whether complex-type glycosylation of tetherin is necessary for its inhibitory activity. To answer this question, we utilized kifunensine, an alkaloid compound that inhibits the activity of ER-associated mannosidase I, an enzyme that is required for trimming and conversion of high-mannose to complex-type side chains [66] . When cells were treated with kifunensine, there was a loss of complex-type glycosylated tetherin, demonstrating that the compound is active ( Figure 3A ). Despite the loss of complex-type oligosaccharide modifications, kifunensine treatment had little or no effect on the ability of tetherin to inhibit the release of Vpu-defective HIV-1 ( Figure 3A,B) . The above experiment was carried out by overexpressing tetherin in 293T cells. We also tested the effect of kifunensine on endogenous tetherin in HeLa cells and again observed that kifunensine treatment had no effect on the inhibitory activity of tetherin ( Figure 3C,D) .

            "text": "As shown in Figure 1 , glycosylation of at least one Asn is required for tetherin-mediated inhibition of HIV-1 release. To determine whether complex-type oligosaccharide modification of tetherin that is glycosylated on a single residue is also dispensable for the inhibition of virus release, 293T cells were transfected with pNL4-3delVpu, and WT and tetherin mutants (N65A, N92A, and N65,92A), treated with kifunensine for 24 h, and virus release was monitored. As observed for WT tetherin, the inhibition of HIV-1 release by single Asn mutants was not diminished in the presence of kifunensine ( Figure 5A,B) . As expected, kifunensine treatment resulted in the expression of 23-kDa and 24.5-kDa tetherin species, but not the complex-type tetherins (\u224826 to 32 kDa) for both N65A and N92A single-Asn mutants ( Figure 5A ). These results indicate that complex-type glycosylation of even the single-Asn mutants is dispensable for inhibition of virus release. We also tested whether preventing the complex-type glycosylation of single Asn has any effect on the surface expression of tetherin mutants. 293T cells were transfected with WT, N65A, N92A, and N65,92A mutant tetherin expression vectors that carry an HA-tag in the extracellular CC domain. Transfected cells were stained with anti-HA antibody. Although the median fluorescence intensity of cell-surface tetherin for WT and the single glycosylation mutants was slightly reduced by kifunensine treatment, there still remained a considerable amount of cell-surface tetherin following kifunensine treatment ( Figure 5C ). However, when WT tetherin-expressing 293T cells were treated with tunicamycin there was a marked reduction in the cell-surface expression of tetherin, suggesting that high-mannose glycosylation of tetherin, but not complex-type glycosylation, is required for cell-surface expression ( Figure 5D ). These results confirm our finding that complex-type glycosylation of tetherin is dispensable for cell-surface expression and inhibition of HIV-1 release, and demonstrate that a single high-mannose modification of tetherin is sufficient for cell-surface tetherin expression and antiviral activity.",

            "text": "As shown in Figure 1 , glycosylation of at least one Asn is required for tetherin-mediated inhibition of HIV-1 release. To determine whether complex-type oligosaccharide modification of tetherin that is glycosylated on a single residue is also dispensable for the inhibition of virus release, 293T cells were transfected with pNL4-3delVpu, and WT and tetherin mutants (N65A, N92A, and N65,92A), treated with kifunensine for 24 h, and virus release was monitored. As observed for WT tetherin, the inhibition of HIV-1 release by single Asn mutants was not diminished in the presence of kifunensine ( Figure 5A,B) . As expected, kifunensine treatment resulted in the expression of 23-kDa and 24.5-kDa tetherin species, but not the complex-type tetherins (\u224826 to 32 kDa) for both N65A and N92A single-Asn mutants ( Figure 5A ). These results indicate that complex-type glycosylation of even the single-Asn mutants is dispensable for inhibition of virus release. We also tested whether preventing the complex-type glycosylation of single Asn has any effect on the surface expression of tetherin mutants. 293T cells were transfected with WT, N65A, N92A, and N65,92A mutant tetherin expression vectors that carry an HA-tag in the extracellular CC domain. Transfected cells were stained with anti-HA antibody. Although the median fluorescence intensity of cell-surface tetherin for WT and the single glycosylation mutants was slightly reduced by kifunensine treatment, there still remained a considerable amount of cell-surface tetherin following kifunensine treatment ( Figure 5C ). However, when WT tetherin-expressing 293T cells were treated with tunicamycin there was a marked reduction in the cell-surface expression of tetherin, suggesting that high-mannose glycosylation of tetherin, but not complex-type glycosylation, is required for cell-surface expression ( Figure 5D ). These results confirm our finding that complex-type glycosylation of tetherin is dispensable for cell-surface expression and inhibition of HIV-1 release, and demonstrate that a single high-mannose modification of tetherin is sufficient for cell-surface tetherin expression and antiviral activity.

These single mutants are efficiently expressed on the cell surface, suggesting that N-linked glycosylation at a single Asn is sufficient for trafficking to the PM. In contrast, the double mutant, N65,92A, is defective in both cell-surface expression and inhibition of HIV-1 release. This loss of cell-surface expression and antiviral activity could not be rescued by increasing the total expression of the N65,92A mutant. Consistent with our data, Perez-Caballero et al. showed that N-linked glycosylation of tetherin is essential for its cell-surface expression [15] . Other labs have also reported that N-linked glycosylation is essential for inhibition of HIV-1 release [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] . Tokarev et al. observed that mutating Asn residues 65 and 92 markedly impaired the ability of tetherin to restrict virus release and induce NF-\u03baB activity [53] . The loss of antiviral activity of the N65,92A mutant towards other viruses such as xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus (XMRV) was also reported [51] . Taylor et al. demonstrated that human tetherin restricts SARS-CoV egress and SARS-CoV protein ORF7a directly interacts with tetherin to inhibit its glycosylation and antiviral function [57] . It was observed that the N65,92A tetherin mutant is mis-trafficked and accumulates in CD63-positive intracellular compartments [50] . Interestingly, the non-glycosylated N65,92A tetherin mutant was still able to inhibit the release of an HIV-1 matrix mutant, 29KE/31KE, that assembles in multi-vesicular bodies (MVBs) [50, 67] and also inhibited the MVB-associated hepatitis B virus (HBV) [50] . A requirement for N-linked glycosylation in the antiviral activity of feline tetherin was also reported [49, 54] . A slight impairment in the antiviral activity of bovine tetherin was observed upon mutation of its single glycosylation site [68] . Tetherin from an owl monkey kidney cell line was shown to not restrict HIV-1 due to the presence of a Thr at residue 181 that prevented efficient glycosylation; mutation of Thr 181 to Ile rescued its glycosylation and antiviral function [69] . These studies are consistent with the importance of N-linked glycosylation in tetherin activity. In contrast, several other groups reported that glycosylation of human tetherin is not essential for restricting the release of HIV-1 [20] , foamy virus [56] , Lassa, and Marburg viruses [55] . The differences in the observations among different groups are likely due to differences in the levels of tetherin expression or the use of different approaches to measure virus release.",

In contrast to previous studies, we also adopted the complementary approach of using chemical inhibitors of the glycosylation pathway. Treating cells with tunicamycin, which inhibits the first step of N-linked glycosylation, blocked the glycosylation, cell-surface expression, and antiviral activity of tetherin in a manner similar to the N65,92A double mutant. We also evaluated whether complex glycosylation of tetherin is essential for its antiviral activity. Treating cells with the mannosidase I inhibitor kifunensine resulted in the loss of complex glycosylation of WT tetherin but no loss in its cell-surface expression or antiviral function. Similarly, the cell-surface expression and antiviral activity of the single Asn mutants, N65A and N92A, were not diminished by kifunensine treatment. These results indicate that the mannose trimming activity of mannosidase I, which is required for conversion of high-mannose to complex oligosaccharide side chains, is not required for the cell-surface expression or antiviral activity of tetherin.",
