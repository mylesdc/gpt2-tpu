While rapid antibody-based testing for the transgenic protein has fulfilled this need in the past, the introduction of new variants of a given transgene demands new diagnostic regimen that allows distinguishing different traits at the nucleic acid level. Although such molecular tests can be performed by PCR in the laboratory, their requirement for expensive equipment and sophisticated operation have prevented its uptake in pointof-use applications. A recently developed isothermal DNA amplification technique, recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), combines simple sample preparation and amplification work-flow procedures with the use of minimal detection equipment in real time. Here, we report the development of a highly sensitive and specific RPA-based detection system for Genuity Roundup Ready 2 Yield (RR2Y) material in soybean (Glycine max) seed samples and present the results of studies applying the method in both laboratory and field-type settings.",

            "text": "Since its inception in the late 1980s, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been the mainstay technique for the amplification of nucleic acids. Although PCR-based testing in laboratories is well established and extremely successful, the reliance of PCR on precise thermal control (at relatively high and rapidly changing-or \"cycling\"temperatures; Figure 1 (a)) has limited its use outside of centralized facilities. The thermocycling equipment used in PCR is expensive, particularly as suitable detection technologies have to be integrated with the amplification itself. Recent efforts to miniaturize and simplify PCR instrumentation have been reported [10] [11] [12] ; however, these approaches have their limitations and have not been adopted in practice [13] . The limitations inherent in PCR make this method generally unsuitable for providing cost-effective access of molecular diagnostics to most end-users and have generally limited the adoption of NAAT-based diagnostic devices in point-of-use (POU)/point-of-care (POC) settings when dealing with noncentralized sample testing. Novel NAATs such as the isothermal recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) [14] , developed by TwistDx (Cambridge, UK), overcome the disadvantages of PCR-based technologies. RPA provides an inexpensive, fast, real-time, and reliable alternative POU/POC method that employs use of crude DNA preparation and simple field-deployable detection devices.",

In addition to RPA, technologies utilizing amplification of nucleic acid targets at constant temperature such as nicking enzyme amplification reaction (NEAR) [17] , loop mediated amplification (LAMP) [18] , nucleic acid sequence based amplification (NASBA) [19] , helicase dependent amplification (HDA) [20] , and cross priming amplification (CPA) [21] have been reported in the literature. RPA is unique within this class of molecular methods in its combination of high performance (sensitivity and specificity of detection), low temperature operation, and overall robustness to temperature fluctuations [16, 22] . The expansion of molecular diagnostics from centralized laboratories into POU-type scenarios such as the one proposed in this publication requires the integration of NAAT platforms into low-cost and low-complexity devices with simple operating procedures. The isothermal NAAT RPA is ideally positioned to enable such solutions. RPA combines constant low reaction temperature with high sensitivity, specificity, and reaction speed. Briefly, in RPA, the sequence of biochemical events that facilitate the amplification of specific DNA fragments include binding of oligonucleotide primers to the target, extension of the bound primers by a DNA polymerase, and dissociation of the amplified product under isothermal condition (Figure 1 (a)) [14] .",

Binding of GP32 to the oligos is followed by UvsY and finally UvsX, the recombinase. The UvsX/oligo complex searches the template DNA for homologous sequences and subsequently extends the primers. Target amplification is detected with a dual labeled oligonucleotide probe, containing a fluorophore (either TAMRA or FAM) and quencher separated by an abasic site (Table 1) , of complimentary sequence. When the probe binds to the amplified target DNA, exonuclease III cleaves the abasic site, and the fluorophore and quencher are separated resulting in a fluorescence signal proportional to the amount of amplified target DNA.",

However, ongoing improvements to GMO crops have resulted in the introduction of given transgenes, such as the gene for expressing the glyphosate-tolerant CP4 variant of 5enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (CP4 EPSPS), into multiple GMO crops, in which case protein-based detection methods cannot distinguish between these various products. In addition, many new GMO crops involve the combination by conventional breeding of two or more transgenic events (i.e., single-locus insertions) to offer combinations of insect and herbicide tolerance genes to combat a wider range of pests and weeds than covered by the single events [30, 33] . Additionally, other new GMO crops do not express a protein to achieve the intended trait (for e.g., Vistive5 Gold Soybean).

Additionally, at the discrimination level of 0.5%, a large imbalance of starting amount of template exists between the two component reactions, with the lec target being up to 200 times more numerous than the RR2Y analyte. These two factors need to be accounted for in the relative performance of the two assays. A duplex assay challenged with a low number of RR2Y target copies in the background of conventional soybean DNA would reflect the performance of the assay in a POU setting, compared with that described above (Figure 3(a) ) where low copy numbers of purified RR2Y DNA have been used as template. A set of experiments were performed to determine the limit of RR2Y detection when challenging the assay with more complex DNA template. A 0.5% mixture of RR2Y in conventional soybean seeds (Figure 3(b) ) was analyzed. Strong signals were still observed at RR2Y template amounts of 25 and 13 copies. Likewise, strong signals were also obtained for the lec control in all cases. The results demonstrate that the combined assay can detect the RR2Y target with sufficient sensitivity even if presented in the background of large amounts of nontarget DNA and despite the active amplification of the internal control, lec. to analyze the robustness of the RPA assay using RR2Y soybean DNA template to determine its usability at the POU settings. Any assay that is to be deployed at such settings must be robust enough to provide consistent performance across varying conditions.

Many of the reagents that are critical for the RPA assay performance (such as proteins, oligonucleotides, and nucleotides) are potentially unstable, some of them even under refrigerated conditions, and are, therefore, provided in a lyophilized format as preformulated reaction pellets in microcentrifuge PCR strip tubes. Each strip of lyophilized RPA pellets was vacuumsealed in a foil pouch. Sealed strips of lyophilized RPA reaction pellets were stored at different temperatures: in a freezer (< \u221215 \u2218 C), in a refrigerator (2-8 \u2218 C), at room temperature (RT; 22-28 \u2218 C), and in an incubator (35-40 \u2218 C). Eight reaction tubes from the respective storage temperature were tested for assay performance at regular intervals over a period of one year. RPA assays for the lec target were stable for one year in a freezer or refrigerator or at RT (Figure 4(b) ). However, the performance of lec amplification/detection shown by pellets stored at elevated temperature in an incubator decreased after 20 weeks (Figure 4(b) ). The RR2Y specific assay components were stable for the entire year when the pellets were stored in a refrigerator or a freezer. There was a pronounced drop in activity of the pellets with regard to the RR2Y assay, when the pellets were stored at RT. RR2Y assay performance, similar to the lec assay, dropped below useful levels, when the reaction pellets were stored at elevated temperatures in an incubator for 20 weeks or longer. In summary, RR2Y RPA reactions in the formulation tested are stable when stored in a freezer or refrigerator for up to one year and at RT for up to six months (Figure 4(a) ). Increased stability characteristics may be achieved by introducing changes to the manufacturing process to increase dryness of the reaction pellets, or by changes to the reaction formulation, for example, by the inclusion of suitable additives. This is currently subject of further investigation and optimization.",

In the POU setting, time and resources do not permit a laboratory-standard purification of genomic DNA from the seed samples. To utilize the RR2Y RPA assay as a field detection method, the reaction should be performed with simply derived seed extracts as the template material. Procedures were standardized to perform the RPA reactions starting with ground soybean seed as the source material ( Figure 5(b) ).",

No amplification was observed with RR2Y primers and probe using conventional and RR1 soybean seed samples ( Figure 5(c), left panel) , demonstrating specificity and utility of the method for use in a field-setting. Additionally, the ease of use of the RR2Y RPA field detection method was tested. One trained ( Figure 5(d) , left panels) and two untrained analysts ( Figure 5(d) , middle and right panels) performed the reaction based on simple protocol provided to the analysts. All three analysts successfully performed the assay. The amplification of the internal control marker lec was observed with all soybean samples, except for the NTC ( Figure 5(d) , bottom panel). RR2Y specific amplification was observed with 0.5% (w/w) RR2Y samples ( Figure 5 (d), right panel) and, as expected, no amplification was observed with conventional, RR1 soybean seed extracts, or NTC ( Figure 5(d) , top panels).",

In particular, the current report presents an RPA-based field detection method that can specifically detect RR2Y soybean. The assay was developed in a duplex format allowing simultaneous detection of the endogenous lec gene as a control with soybean samples, irrespective of the specific trait(s) of interest for a given RPA assay.Detection of a number of novel traits could benefit from employing RPA, including RNA interference-based traits where the inserted DNA in the transgenic event does not encode a protein (Vistive5 Gold Soybean). RPA technology provides benefit to products with multiple stacked traits by delivering insertion-specific detection of the individual traits. The technology offers a significant breakthrough for the development of detection methods at the elevators and ports and in the field to ensure regulatory and product stewardship compliance and validate product claims.",
