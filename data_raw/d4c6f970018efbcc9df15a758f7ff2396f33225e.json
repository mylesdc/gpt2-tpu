            "text": "Legionnaires' disease is a relatively rare cause of community-acquired pneumonia caused by Legionella species; however, 20%-25% of patients who are hospitalized with Legionnaires' disease require invasive mechanical ventilation and average mortality rates for sporadic disease range from 10% to 15% [1] . Legionnaires' disease is caused by inhalation of Legionella species, which are intracellular, Gram-negative bacilli ubiquitously found in the environment [1] [2] . Host risk factors for Legionnaires' disease include male gender, age older than 50 years, cigarette smoking, diabetes, end-stage renal failure, organ transplantation and immunosuppression, such as glucocorticoids or anti-rejection drugs following organ transplantation [1] . Travel is an important and underappreciated risk factor associated with legionellosis in a community setting [1] . Treatment options for Legionnaires' disease include macrolides, fluoroquinolones, or tetracycline; however, preferred therapies for immunocompromised patients with Legionnaires' disease include levofloxacin and azithromycin [1] [2] [3] . We describe an immunocompromised and severely ill patient with Legionnaires' disease and who also has allergies to both fluoroquinolones and macrolides; he was successfully treated using tigecycline, a third generation glycylcycline, indicating that tigecycline may serve as a safe and effective alternative therapeutic option for treatment of Legionnaires' disease in select cases. 1 2 1 3",
