            "text": "Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) is thought to contribute to the establishment of many biomolecular condensates, eukaryotic cell structures that concentrate diverse macromolecules but lack a bounding membrane. RNA granules control RNA metabolism and comprise a large class of condensates that are enriched in RNA-binding proteins and RNA molecules. Many RNA granule proteins are composed of both modular domains and intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) having low amino acid sequence complexity. Phase separation of these molecules likely plays an important role in the generation and stability of RNA granules. To understand how folded domains and IDRs can cooperate to modulate LLPS, we generated a series of engineered proteins. These were based on fusions of an IDR derived from the RNA granule protein FUS (fused in sarcoma) to a multivalent poly-Src homology 3 (SH3) domain protein that phase-separates when mixed with a poly-proline-rich-motif (polyPRM) ligand. We found that the wild-type IDR promotes LLPS of the polySH3-polyPRM system, decreasing the phase separation threshold concentration by 8-fold. Systematic mutation of tyrosine residues in Gly/Ser-Tyr-Gly/Ser motifs of the IDR reduced this effect, depending on the number but not on the position of these substitutions. Mutating all tyrosines to nonaromatic residues or phosphorylating the IDR raised the phase separation threshold above that of the unmodified polySH3-polyPRM pair. These results show that low-complexity IDRs can modulate LLPS both positively and negatively, depending on the degree of aromaticity and phosphorylation status. Our findings provide plausible mechanisms by which these sequences could alter RNA granule properties on evolutionary and cellular timescales.",

These structures have diverse roles in the metabolism of RNA, including splicing, modification, assembly, storage, degradation, and localization (25-28). Many RNA granule proteins contain multiple RNA-binding domains as well as large intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) (13, 29 -31). The IDRs, as well as the folded domains, are important for assembly of RNA granules (32-36), and their phosphorylation can trigger granule disassembly (37-40). In vitro, tandem arrays of folded domains, including RNA-binding domains, can oligomerize and phase-separate when mixed with their multivalent cognate ligands, including repetitive RNAs (13, 14, 24, 41) . IDRs can also self-associate and do so through a variety of side-chain interaction modes, including electrostatic, polar, and hydrophobic (42), as well as backbone modes that generate amyloid fibers and potentially other glassy structures (43, 44). These interactions can promote LLPS and/or formation of solid, amyloid-containing hydrogels (12, 16 -18, 20 -22, 29, 45).",

These structures have diverse roles in the metabolism of RNA, including splicing, modification, assembly, storage, degradation, and localization (25) (26) (27) (28) . Many RNA granule proteins contain multiple RNA-binding domains as well as large intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) (13, 29 -31) . The IDRs, as well as the folded domains, are important for assembly of RNA granules (32) (33) (34) (35) (36) , and their phosphorylation can trigger granule disassembly (37) (38) (39) (40) . In vitro, tandem arrays of folded domains, including RNA-binding domains, can oligomerize and phase-separate when mixed with their multivalent cognate ligands, including repetitive RNAs (13, 14, 24, 41) . IDRs can also self-associate and do so through a variety of side-chain interaction modes, including electrostatic, polar, and hydrophobic (42) , as well as backbone modes that generate amyloid fibers and potentially other glassy structures (43, 44) . These interactions can promote LLPS and/or formation of solid, amyloid-containing hydrogels (12, 16 -18, 20 -22, 29, 45) .",

Mutation or deletion of tyrosine residues in the BugZ and Nephrin intracellular domain proteins decreases their propensity to phase-separate (23, 46) . Similarly, mutation of tyrosines blocks the formation of hydrogels by the IDR of the RNA-binding protein FUS (29) . Tyrosine mutations also block recruitment of IDRs into hydrogels and/or phase-separated liquids formed by the RNA-binding protein hnRNPA2 (47) and FUS (29) , as well as into RNA granules in cells (29) .

The FUS IDR can undergo LLPS on its own at high concentrations (45) , and, when fused to the RNA-binding protein PTB, can promote RNA-induced LLPS (17) . We found that, when tethered to a polySH3 domain protein that phase-separates when mixed with a cognate poly-proline-rich motif (polyPRM) ligand, wildtype FUS decreases the threshold concentration for LLPS by 8-fold. The magnitude of this effect depends on the number of tyrosine residues in FUS but not on their positions within the sequence. Aromatic residues seem to be particularly important to the effect, as IDR mutants with all tyrosines mutated to leucine or serine do not phase-separate. Conversely, these IDR mutants actively oppose phase separation, increasing the LLPS threshold concentration above that for polySH3 \u03e9 polyPRM alone. The IDR mutants do not strongly interfere with interactions between polySH3 and polyPRM but, rather, may act by destabilizing the highly concentrated droplet state through entropic effects. Phosphorylated FUS (pFUS) acts similarly to interfere with LLPS of the polySH3-polyPRM system. Our data suggest that the specific amino acid composition of certain IDRs endows them with dual properties of either promoting or opposing LLPS by altering weak self-association of modular domain proteins. These effects could be used in both evolutionary and cellular processes to modulate the existence and properties of RNA granules.",

Random mutation of increasing numbers of these tyrosines to serines was shown to progressively decrease recruitment into FUS hydrogels and RNA granules (29) . To learn which tyrosine residues in the FUS IDR are responsible for promoting LLPS of the polySH3-polyPRM system, we systematically mutated groups of five consecutive tyrosine residues across the sequence to serine (FUS(5S-1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6)) ( Fig. 2A) . We fused these mutants individually to the C terminus of SH3 3 , and used A 600 to determine the phase separation threshold in the presence of PRM 4 . All of the mutants phase-separated at 5-to 6.5-fold higher concentrations than wild-type FUS (Fig. 2B) . For all but one, LLPS occurred in a narrow window between 120 M and 130 M (Fig. 2B) , indicating that the contribution of tyrosine residues to LLPS is distributed relatively uniformly across FUS. The LLPS threshold for SH3 3 -FUS(5S-1) was 100 M, slightly lower than that of the others, indicating that the first five tyrosine residues may be somewhat less important than the others (Fig. 2B) . It is also possible that the adjacent SH3 domains influence the N terminus of FUS and prevent some of the first five tyrosine residues from making interactions that promote LLPS. Nevertheless, these data demonstrate that the aromatic sequence determinants for LLPS are relatively uniformly distributed across the FUS IDR. The number but not the position of aromatic residues determines the LLPS threshold. This behavior mirrors that of LLPS by multimodular domain proteins alone, where the phase separation threshold is dependent on domain valency (13, 15) , suggesting conceptual similarity between the two molecular types.",

We fused the mutants to the C terminus of SH3 3 and determined the LLPS threshold in the presence of PRM 4 ( Fig. 1C and supplemental Fig. S1 ). FUS(27F) promoted LLPS analogously to wild-type FUS, but much less strongly, decreasing the threshold only to 120 M (versus 160 M for SH3 3 \u03e9 PRM 4 alone). The other two mutants behaved quite differently in two respects. First, neither promoted LLPS, including FUS(27L), which would be classified as more hydrophobic than wild-type FUS in many hydrophobicity scales (53) (54) (55) . FUS(27F) would also be classified as more hydrophobic than the wild type, but it too is less effective in promoting LLPS. Even in alternative hydrophobicity scales that classify tyrosine as extremely hydrophobic, leucine is placed to be more hydrophobic than phenylalanine (56, 57) .

            "text": "In addition to oligomerization, LLPS of multivalent molecules is also modulated by the intrinsic solubilities of the interacting species; that is, their propensities to interact weakly with themselves over solvent (58, 59 ). Such weak self-self interactions are often assessed through the scattering second virial coefficient (A 2 ), which is closely related to the osmotic second virial coefficient (B 22 ) under dilute buffer conditions (60) . These parameters reflect the deviation from ideal solution behavior because of pairwise interactions between solute molecules in a solution (61) . For a variety of proteins, A 2 correlates reasonably well with solubility, defined as the concentration of protein in a bulk solution phase that is in equilibrium with protein crystals or a condensed protein liquid phase (62) (63) (64) (65) (66) . In the latter case, this corresponds to the threshold concentration for LLPS. Further, the \"diffusion interaction parameter,\" k D , the linear change in protein diffusion coefficient with concentration, is a major component of B 22 (67, 68) . Negative values of k D (negatively correlated diffusion coefficient and concentration) correspond to favorable relative self-self interactions, and more negative values have been shown to correlate with increased propensity for LLPS (69 -74) .",

            "text": "The requirement of FUS(27S) being in cis to oppose LLPS suggests that FUS(27S) might act through altering the self-association properties of SH3 3 -FUS. To test this hypothesis, we used dynamic light scattering (DLS) and static light scattering (SLS) to measure the diffusion coefficients and scattering properties of SH3 3 -FUS proteins as a function of concentration. The relationship between diffusion coefficient (D) and protein concentration (c) can be approximately described by D \u03ed D 0 (1\u03e9k D c), where D 0 is the diffusion coefficient at infinite dilution. We obtained k D values by fitting the concentration-dependent diffusion coefficients (supplemental Fig. S3 ) to this equation. The k D values of SH3 3 -FUS(WT) and SH3 3 -FUS(27F) were more negative than that of SH3 3 , indicating stronger selfinteraction (Fig. 4A ). In contrast, the k D of SH3 3 -FUS(27S) and SH3 3 -FUS(27L) were both less negative, indicating weaker self-interaction (Fig. 4A) . A 2 values were similarly calculated from the concentration dependence of scattering intensities, and the A 2 values of the four proteins showed an analogous pattern (supplemental Fig. S5A ). The difference of k D and A 2 between the different fusion proteins correlates with their phase separation behaviors: FUS proteins that have stronger self-association undergo LLPS with PRM 4 at a lower threshold concentration, whereas those that have weaker self-association produce a higher threshold concentration. DLS experiments also showed that, as concentration increased, although mixtures of SH3 3 -FUS(27S) and PRM 4 did not undergo LLPS, they could still form larger complexes (inferred from smaller D values) than those required for phase separation of SH3 3 -FUS(5S-2) \u03e9 PRM 4 (Fig. 4B ). With the caveat that D can reflect properties other than mass, these data are consistent with the idea that weaker self-association (and, by inference, higher solubility) opposes phase separation, even though oligomerization through SH3-PRM interactions is largely unaffected.",

In contrast, attachment of FUS(27S) opposed LLPS of PTB \u03e9 RNA (Fig.  4C ). DLS and SLS experiments revealed that both k D and A 2 values of PTB-FUS(27S) were less negative than those of PTB alone, suggesting that PTB-FUS(27S) exhibited weaker self-association ( Fig. 4D and supplemental Figs.

The four serine residues in the FUS IDR reported to be phosphorylated by DNA-PK (Ser-26, Ser-42, Ser-61, and Ser-84) are in close proximity to tyrosine residues (Tyr-25, Tyr-41, Tyr-58, and Tyr-81, respectively) (77) , and phosphorylation impedes the formation of FUS hydrogels and targeting of FUS to preformed hydrogels (77) . To test whether phosphorylation of FUS can affect LLPS of SH3 3 \u03e9 PRM 4 , we incubated liquid droplets formed by SH3 3 -FUS(WT) plus PRM 4 with recombinant DNA-PK, Mg 2\u03e9 , and ATP for 3 h. The liquid droplets disassembled almost completely by the end of the incubation period, whereas liquid droplets formed by SH3 3 (without FUS attachment) plus PRM 4 were not affected by DNA-PK (Fig. 5) . We further demonstrated that only SH3 3 -FUS(WT) but not SH3 3 can be highly phosphorylated by DNA-PK, confirming that the effects of the kinase are applied through the FUS IDR and specific to the FUS-containing system (supplemental Fig. S6 ). DLS experiments further showed that the k D of SH3 3 -FUS(WT) became less negative upon phosphorylation (creating SH3 3 -pFUS) (Fig. 4A) . This result suggests that phosphorylation of FUS can disassemble liquid droplets by weakening the self-association of SH3 3 -FUS(WT).

Rather, as in the ability of FUS to form hydrogels and be retained by hydrogels (29) , and as observed for LLPS by other IDRs (16, 23, 46) , the numerous tyrosine residues in FUS are important for LLPS. Our systematic investigation of these tyrosine residues reveals that they are broadly involved in and contribute nearly equally to LLPS (at least at the resolution of five tyrosines). These observations are consistent with a previous NMR study on FUS indicating that the backbones of all residues display slower motions upon LLPS, suggesting distributed interactions across the length of the polypeptide chain (45) . In contrast to this behavior of FUS, the IDR of hnRNPA2 binds to hydrogels and partitions into liquid droplets through Tyr/Phe interactions that are less distributed, with some positions contributing substantially more than others (47) . It remains to be seen whether FUS-like (distributed) or hnRNPA2-like (focused) aromatic interactions are more prevalent in promoting LLPS and related behaviors of other IDRs.",

For FUS, however, hydrophobicity does not appear to be sufficient to enhance LLPS of polySH3-polyPRM. Although there is no single best method for assessing amino acid hydrophobicity, all scales classify Tyr, Phe, and Leu as appreciably hydrophobic (53, 54, 80 ). Yet clearly Tyr and Phe act differently than Leu in modulating LLPS. The difference between Tyr/Phe and Leu suggests the likely importance of interactions such as -, CH-, OH-, and NH-, provided by aromatic side chains, in promoting LLPS (81) . Although the difference in interaction energy between a Phe pair and a Tyr pair can be minor in certain context (82) , other studies have shown that the OH group in the phenol ring of Tyr enhancesand CH-interactions (83, 84) . This could potentially explain why Tyr is better than Phe at promoting LLPS. Additionally, the ability of the residues to organize bound water molecules is likely to play an important role, as loss of such waters is a major driving force for LLPS of elastin (85) . Further biophysical studies are required to understand the importance of aromatic interactions in FUS.",

A variety of studies have examined the ability of fusion partners, including MBP (75) and highly soluble IDRs (86, 87) , to increase the soluble expression and decrease the aggregation of proteins (which, for ease of description we will call \"hosts\" here). In related work, numerous experimental and computational studies have examined LLPS of elastin-like peptides (ELPs), which are sequence variants of natural elastin that phase-separate in response to changes in temperature and solvent conditions (85, 88) . Many studies have examined the effects of joining folded domains or IDRs as fusion partners to ELP hosts (89 -91) . The analogy to our system is not exact because LLPS of ELPs is favored by increasing temperatures, in contrast to our system, where LLPS is favored by lower temperatures (supplemental Fig. S7 ). Nevertheless, as in our system, it has been observed that some fusion partners inhibit phase separation relative to the unfused ELP hosts.",

First, electrostatic repulsion by highly charged fusion partners may keep the host chains apart, preventing aggregation (91, 92) . Second, fusion partners have been proposed to bind aggregation-prone sites, often partially unfolded regions that exist during folding, of hosts to prevent self-association (75) . Third, in ELPs, the release of organized water from hydrophobic surfaces is known to be a principal driver of LLPS, and incorporation of charged residues in the ELP chain destabilizes those immobilized waters, decreasing the magnitude of this entropic effect (85, 93) . It has been proposed that charged fusion partners could act similarly to decrease the driving force for LLPS of ELP hosts (91) . Fourth, in a so-called entropic bristle effect, fusion partners occupy a large space that is restricted when other proteins bind the host, thus decreasing host self-association (86, 94) . Although this effect is most often cited for IDR fusion partners, it could also occur with folded partners. Finally, ELP chains collapse upon LLPS, which produces an unfavorable decrease in configurational entropy. It has been proposed based on molecular dynamics simulations that non-interacting chains fused to the terminus of an ELP host would also lose configurational entropy themselves upon LLPS, increasing the size of this energetic penalty (95) .",

            "text": "In general, any element that changes the apparent self-association of oligomers has the potential to modulate phase separation and might be exploited by biological systems. First, our mutagenesis experiments reveal the importance of aromatic residues in promoting LLPS. The hydrophilic residues might be critical in opposing LLPS. Evolution could modulate the propensity of a molecule to undergo LLPS by changing the number of these residues as well as other residues in various contexts. A recent study has demonstrated that the usage of aliphatic residues in the low complexity region of Pab1, an RNA-binding protein in stress granules, and thus the hydrophobicity of this region, are shaped by natural selection (96) . We notice that, in this study, similar to our observation, substitution of these aliphatic residues can either promote or repress LLPS of Pab1. Second, we have shown that phosphorylation of FUS can have a similar effect as direct substitution of aromatic residues (Fig. 5) . Other posttranslational modifications of IDRs could conceivably do the same, and in other systems, phosphorylation could increase self-association, enhancing LLPS, as observed in SH2 domain-based signaling pathways (15, 41, 97) . Further, in con-trast to the covalently tethered MBP in our synthetic construct, a naturally occurring protein could non-covalently bind to phase-separated proteins in cells and promote or oppose LLPS. In fact, the latter has been observed in two systems that we are aware of. In the engineered fusion of an ELP host with the protein tendamistat, binding of the large polar protein porcine pancreatic \u2423-amylase inhibits LLPS (91) . In a more physiologically relevant example, the cytomegalovirus protein IE1 disrupts the phase-separated biomolecular condensate PML nuclear bodies (98) . IE1 utilizes an N-terminal coiled-coil domain to bind directly to the PML protein, which is the essential scaffold of the PML nuclear bodies. However, the coiledcoil domain is unable to disrupt PML bodies. Rather, disruption requires the 20-kDa C-terminal domain of IE1, which is highly negatively charged and predicted to be highly disordered. Although the mechanism of the disruptive activity of IE1 has not been explored, the framework developed here suggests that the protein could act through using its coiled-coil domain to recruit its destabilizing C-terminal IDP to PML. As more factors are discovered that modulate the dynamics of biomolecular condensates, this physical mechanism may be more widely observed.",

The advantage of IDRs as modulator of LLPS lies in their versatile physical properties, which rely on their special amino acid compositions with three elements: the aromatic residues mediate short-range, aromatic interactions and promote LLPS; the abundant hydrophilic residues dominate the solubility of IDRs and oppose LLPS when aromatic interactions are lost; and the abundant serine and tyrosine residues can be readily phosphorylated, enabling rapid transitions between promoting and opposing LLPS. These properties should enable IDRs to modulate LLPS through evolutionary changes (by addition to or loss from a multidomain partner or by addition or loss of aromatic residues in the sequence) as well as during cellular processes involving alterations in the balance of kinase and phosphatase activities. These mechanisms could play important roles in controlling the physical properties, assembly/disassembly, and functions of cellular structures such as RNA granules.",
