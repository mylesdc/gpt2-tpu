Production of recombinant proteins in P. pastoris is usually performed by controlling gene expression with the strong AOX1 promoter, which is induced by addition of methanol. Optimization of processes using the AOX1 promoter in P. pastoris is generally done in bioreactors by fed-batch fermentation with a controlled continuous addition of methanol for avoiding methanol toxification and carbon/energy starvation. The development of feeding protocols and the study of AOX1-controlled recombinant protein production have been largely made in shake flasks, although shake flasks have very limited possibilities for measurement and control.",

It has been demonstrated that P. pastoris is an efficient production system also for very large and complex proteins, such as collagens, which besides the recombinant gene(s) needed for the collagen polypeptide chain(s) needs the parallel expression of two different genes coding for collagen prolyl 4-hydroxylase (C-P4H), an enzyme required for the thermal stability of collagens [7] [8] [9] .",

Starvation is obvious by a pO 2 peak after exhaustion of methanol, related to declining respiratory activity ( Figure 1A ). We concluded from this data that the methanol feeding in this shake flask process is not optimal. In the first step of optimization, the rapidly increasing pO 2 level after consumption of methanol was used as a signal to manually add a new methanol pulse. Each single methanol dose was the same as in the standard protocol and consequently much more methanol was added during the course of the cultivation. Although the procedure was laborious and difficult to reproduce manually, a 30% higher cell density was obtained and the product related mRNAs showed higher expression, such as the mRNAs encoding alcohol oxidase 1 (AOX), formaldehyde dehydrogenase, yeast PDI, type II procollagen chain and the C-P4H \u03b1(I) and PDI/\u03b2 subunits ( Figure 1B) .

Furthermore, the moderate cell densities in our experiments are also due to the use of diluted methanol feed solutions. To avoid long time intervals without any feed and to ensure a feed which is metabolically seen as continuous methanol was fed as a 5% solution, which correspondingly dilutes the medium and results in a lower final cell yield.

After centrifugation (2 min, 13000 rpm, 4\u00b0C) the supernatant was removed and the pellet was dispensed in 100 \u03bcl of RNA Later (Ambion) and stored at -70\u00b0C until analysis. Total RNA extraction was performed with the RNeasy Mini Kit and mechanical cell disruption according to the manufacturers instructions (Qiagen).",
