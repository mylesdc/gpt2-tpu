Herd characteristics and regional distribution of farms indicated that this survey gives a good overview on calf management practices on registered dairy farms in Austria. The median number of cows per farm was 20 (interquartile range 13-30). Significant differences regarding farm characteristics and calf management between small and large farms (\u226420 vs >20 cows) were present. Only 2.8 % of farmers tested first colostrum quality by use of a hydrometer. Storing frozen colostrum was more prevalent on large farms (80.8 vs 64.2 %). On 85.1 % of the farms, whole milk, including waste milk, was fed to the calves. Milk replacer and waste milk were more often used on large farms. In accordance with similar studies from other countries, calf diarrhoea was indicated as the most prevalent disease. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that herd size was associated with calf diarrhoea and calf respiratory tract disease, with higher risk of disease on large farms. Furthermore, feeding waste milk to the calves was associated with increasing calf diarrhoea incidence on farm. In the final model with calf respiratory tract disease as outcome, respondents from organic farms reported less often a respiratory tract disease incidence of over 10 % compared with conventional farms [odds ratio (OR) 0.40, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.21-0.75] and farmers that housed calves individually or in groups after birth significantly reported more often to have an incidence of respiratory tract disease >10 % compared with farms where all calves were housed individually (OR 2.28, 95 % CI 1.16-4.48).",

In Austria, dairy farms are traditionally family-owned and small sized with an average number of 18 dairy cows, predominantly Fleckvieh breed [14] . Therefore, it can be assumed that the calf management on these small farms, similarly to countries with comparable agricultural structures, differs from that of other countries. Also, calves of different breeds might be managed differently as reported by Stanek et al. [13] for Holstein-Friesian and Fleckvieh calves in Czech Republic.",

Due to the nature of this kind of survey and its dissemination, a potential bias may exist, as it cannot be excluded that farms e.g. with severe problems tended not to participate. Furthermore, this survey does not provide any information about calf management practices on not registered farms and farms with no access to the internet. Thus, it can be speculated whether this survey compromises the more professional and modern dairy farms in Austria.",

Distribution of main breeds on registered dairy farms in Austria is 74.5 % Fleckvieh, 13.4 % Brown Swiss, and 10.9 % Holstein Frisian [14] and was similar (P > 0.05) in our study. Significant differences between small and large dairy farms were found for all general farm characteristics evaluated (Table 1 ). In summary, small farms were more often organic producing farms, on small farms cows had access to pasture, and cows were kept tied-up more often than on large farms. Furthermore, farm animals others than cattle were more often kept on small than on large farms. The question regarding \"other farm animals than cattle\" was included because in a previous study the presence of additional farm animals was associated with diarrhoea in calves [9] . On 54.6 % of the farms the average milk yield was between 6000 and 8000 kg per cow per year. On all registered farms, the average milk yield in 2013 was 7200 kg [14] . Milk yield (given as a categorical variable, see Table 1 ) differed significantly (P < 0.01) between small and large farms. Small farms generally had lower milk yields. Results suggest a lower degree of specialisation of small farms.",

            "text": "Details regarding calving management and care of the newborn are presented in Table 2 . Calving management and care of the newborn are important for the calves' health and were therefore evaluated in detail in [11, 20] . In a German survey on large farms with more than 100 dairy cows, a calving pen was obviously more common with up to 100 % of the farms having such an area [17] . Significant differences were, however, also present in availability of a calving pen between small and large farms of the present study. The use of a calving pen is recommended to minimize stress for the cow and newborn and ensure best hygiene [3, 4] . Nevertheless, in practice, calving pens are often not cleaned and disinfected regularly, or are used also for diseased animals, and might represent a risk factor for spreading infections [9] . This seems to be the case also on the farms of the present study as on farms with a calving pen univariable logistic regression revealed that the odds that farmers reported a diarrhoea incidence of >10 % was greater on farms with a calving pen than on farms without [odds ratio (OR) 1.57, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.24-1.98]. This hypothesis, however, was not confirmed in the multivariable logistic regression model, where the reported incidence of diarrhoea was not affected by the presence of a calving pen. As the calving pen might pose a risk factor for the newborn, it is recommended to separate calves from their dam as soon as possible after birth and to house calves individually in a clean area [3] . The vast majority of the farmers (88.5 %) indicated to separate the calf from its dam within 1 h after parturition. This is similar to the findings of Kehoe et al. [20] in Pennsylvania, whereas in studies from Canada, England and Wales, calves were generally separated later from their dam [11, 23] . Early cow-calf separation is also proposed to ensure an early and targeted colostrum supply [24] . Data concerning colostrum management are summarised in Table 2 . Results suggest that farmers are aware of the importance of a timely colostrum supply, as 83.7 % stated to feed first colostrum within 4 h after birth. Although colostrum quality plays an important role in regard to a sufficient immunoglobulin supply to calves, most farmers (97.2 %) did not check first colostrum quality by use of a hydrometer. Regarding time and quantity of first colostrum feeding no difference could be detected between small and large farms. In contrast, frozen colostrum stocks and oesophageal tube feeding of first colostrum were significantly less common on small than on large farms (P < 0.01). Although the definition of small and large herds differ between the present study and the study by Kehoe et al. [20] , these authors also found that the use of a hydrometer for colostrum quality estimation and the storage of frozen colostrum stocks was more often performed on large farms. Results concerning colostrum management are in accordance with results of a previous case control study performed in Austria [9] . Results of both studies (the present study and [9] ) suggest that first colostrum feeding was performed early post natum by most farmers. Answers regarding this question, however, have to be interpreted with care, as farmers may have stated what they know is correct, but may not necessarily represent the true daily management practice. For adequate passive transfer of immunoglobulins (Ig) not only time, but also Ig quantity fed to the calf plays an important role. Although easy, fast, and cheap methods like hydrometers and Brix-refractometers to estimate colostrum quality on farm are available [25] , colostrum quality was solely checked on few farms. A reason for this can only be hypothesized. Maybe, in contrast to the knowledge of importance of timely first colostrum feeding, the knowledge on importance of colostrum quality is not widespread.",

In epidemiological studies, however, rather group size than grouping itself was associated with an increased risk for calf diseases [4, 28] . Furthermore, it was suggested that social contact provided by group housing of calves increases performance (feed intake, weight gain) and animal welfare [29] [30] [31] . Nevertheless, in individually housed calves it is easier to feed calves individually according to their special needs and to control the animals' health status. The great proportion of farms (84.5 %) housed calves indoors what is similar to studies from Canada and Sweden [11, 19] . Reasons might be exposure to extreme climate conditions in Canada, Sweden, as well as in Austria during winter that prevents farmers from housing calves under outdoor conditions. Furthermore, in Alpine regions large gradients make it often difficult to position outdoor igloos.",

Milk replacer and waste milk were significantly more often fed on large farms (P < 0.01). Reasons for whole milk feeding were not asked, but could be due to the fact that it is easy to handle, consists of good balanced nutrients and that milk produced over the quota, can be fed [11] . Feeding waste milk was a common practice on the majority of the farms similar as reported by other authors [11, 13, 23, 32] . Although in a recent study Al Mawly et al.

Recent studies state a benefit on growth, health, and performance later in life of feeding larger amounts of milk than the traditional feeding of 10-12 % of the calves' body weight [37] . This, however, is still not common on dairy farms, neither on farms of the present study nor in other countries that have been surveyed [11, 19] . Weaning took place late (73.7 % of the farmers, answering this question, stated not to wean calves before the 10th week of life) compared with other studies of different countries where calves were usually weaned between week 7 and 10 [11, 13, 19] . Reasons for relatively late weaning on farms were not asked and can only be hypothesised. Advantages of later weaning are higher daily weight gains and a reduced drop in energy intake after weaning [38, 39] . Reported disadvantages, such as higher feeding costs for late weaned calves [38] may be less pronounced in Austria because feeding milk produced over the quota is very common. It will be interesting if late weaning changes with the ending of the milk quota system this year.",

            "text": "Morbidity and mortality data obtained in the present study have to be interpreted with care. As usually no data on calf diseases exist on farms in Austria [9] , we asked the farmers to estimate the proportion of calves suffering from different diseases. Consequently, the results might rather represent sensation of the farmer regarding disease incidence than true incidence. Furthermore, the predetermined classification of incidence was quite rough but considers that on average farms in Austria each case represents approximately 5 %-points. The prevalence of diseases in calves estimated by the farmers is presented in Table 5 . Calf diarrhoea was the most prevalent disease. Approximately half of the farmers, however, estimated that the calf diarrhoea incidence on farm was not more than 10 %. This might be comparable to other studies where the reported median herd level incidence for calf diarrhoea was between 7.8 and 10.5 % [4, 7, 40] . Interestingly, in contrast to the question concerning diarrhoea, questions on other diseases were not answered by more than two-thirds of the respondents (Table 5 ). An explanation for this could be that farmers are more sensitive to calf diarrhoea than to other diseases, particularly as this disease can affect a large number of animals. It can only be speculated whether not answering questions was because farmers were not able to (not knowing) or not wanting to. Not answering questions concerning diseases was not correlated with answers given to any other question (any other dependent variable), but not answering questions to respiratory tract, umbilical, and joint disease, as well as mortality, were correlated with each other (correlation coefficient >0.60). It is probable that certain farmers generally did not want to answer questions on disease prevalence on their farms. Due to the fact that the questionnaires could be answered anonymously and due to the aforementioned knowledge that usually no data on calf disease exist, it is more likely that farmers did not know the incidence of (especially less prevalent) diseases.",

Herd size differed significantly between farms with \u226410 % and >10 % diseased calves, with large farms reporting greater disease incidence than small ones. Associations between herd size and disease were also found in other studies and have been explained by increased stocking density and less time for individual care of calves [8, 9] . Another explanation could be that on farms of different sizes the recognition of diseases differs. Furthermore, other management factors that differ between small and large farms may influence this outcome. Therefore, we tested for confounding of evaluated management factors on the association between herd size and diarrhoea, but could not find such an effect in this study. In the final model with calf diarrhoea as outcome variable, feeding of waste milk was also associated with the reported incidence of calf diarrhoea. Feeding this kind of milk to all or at least to male calves was associated with higher calf diarrhoea incidence. In contrast, when farmers reported to feed waste milk only in exceptional cases, the reported calf diarrhoea incidence was not higher. As reported in other studies and already mentioned above, feeding waste milk increases the risk of pathogen transmission and the emerging of antimicrobial resistance in bacteria [34] [35] [36] , that might lead to an increased calf diarrhoea incidence on farm.",

In a study by Bidokhti et al. [41] seroprevalence to bovine coronavirus and bovine respiratory syncytial virus was lower on organic than on conventional farms.

As the time order of the different diseases is unknown, it is not possible to say whether diseases are a risk factor for or a result of diarrhoea and respiratory tract disease, respectively.

Some of these factors have already been described as risk factors in previous studies [4, 7, 9, 22, 24, 40, 42] . One reason for these missing significant associations may be that the study was not planned as a risk factor analysis and consequently the study design did not fit.
