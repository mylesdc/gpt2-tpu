NFV has also been shown to have in vitro inhibitory activity against human herpesviruses (HHVs). Given the apparent absence of an aspartyl protease encoded by HHVs, we investigated the mechanism of action of NFV herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) in cultured cells. Selection of HSV-1 resistance to NFV was not achieved despite multiple passages under drug pressure. NFV did not significantly affect the level of expression of late HSV-1 gene products. Normal numbers of viral particles appeared to be produced in NFV-treated cells by electron microscopy but remain within the cytoplasm more often than controls. NFV did not inhibit the activity of the HSV-1 serine protease nor could its antiviral activity be attributed to inhibition of Akt phosphorylation. NFV was found to decrease glycosylation of viral glycoproteins B and C and resulted in aberrant subcellular localization, consistent with induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress and the unfolded protein response by NFV. These results demonstrate that NFV causes alterations in HSV-1 glycoprotein maturation and egress and likely acts on one or more host cell functions that are important for HHV replication.",

Furthermore, we speculated that NFV acting on a nonprotease viral target would be improbable and that its antiviral activity is more likely due to one or more of its effects on host cells, which could impair efficient viral replication.

The effect of NFV on HSV-1 maturational protease activity was assayed by transfecting HEK293-T cells with vectors expressing the protease (VP24; N-terminal 247 amino acids of the UL26 ORF gene product), as well as two substrates: the HSV-1 capsid scaffold protein (amino acids 307-635 of the UL26 ORF gene product; full-length product of UL26.5; ICP35) and a catalytically inactive mutant (S129A) of the full-length protease-scaffold protein transcript (amino acids 1-635 of the UL26 ORF gene product) [18] . The protease coding sequence contained an N-terminal HA tag and each substrate contained an Nterminal FLAG tag; all vectors were synthesized by Blue Heron Biotech, LLC. Each substrate was expressed alone or in combination with the protease, in the presence of NFV or a vehicle control. Expression was under the control of the CMV6 promoter. The plasmid pEGFP-N2, which expresses a GFP variant from the CMV immediate-early promoter, was used to monitor transfection efficiencies. Transfection was performed using Mirus TransIT-293 reagent (MIR 2700) according to the manufacturer's instructions. NFV (10 M final concentration) or DMSO (0.1% final concentration) was added to the cells concurrently with the DNA and transfection reagent. Cultures were incubated 24 hours with no change of medium, at which time the cells were harvested on ice by scraping into RIPA buffer containing protease inhibitors (Roche Complete Mini EDTA-Free Protease Inhibitor Cocktail tablets). Protein concentrations were determined by BCA assay (Pierce). Extracted proteins (10 g/lane) were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes by tank transfer overnight. The blots were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk and probed with anti-FLAG M2 mouse monoclonal antibody (Sigma), recognizing the tag on the scaffold protein, anti-HA monoclonal antibody, clone HA-7 (Sigma), and recognizing the tag on VP24.",

Similar numbers of capsids were observed in the nucleus of untreated and NFV-treated cells (approximately 39 and 44, resp., Figures 4(a) and 4(b) ). However, compared with untreated cells, capsids in NFV-treated cells appeared to be disproportionately retained within the cytoplasm (\u223c14 versus Protease: Figure 2 : NFV does not inhibit activity of the HSV-1 protease. The coding sequence of the full-length protein product of UL26 ORF (pUL26) and the expression proteins employed are diagramed in panel (a). Transfection vectors were constructed to express the VP24 protease with an N-terminal HA tag (\"protease\"), the pUL26.5 with an N-terminal FLAG tag (Substrate 1), or the S129A pUL26 mutant inactive protease-scaffold protein with an N-terminal FLAG tag (Substrate 2). Tags are depicted in grey at the left end of each construct. The release (R) and maturation (M) cleavage sites are shown. After transfection into HEK293-T cells, construct expression and substrate cleavage were evaluated by Western blot using anti-HA and FLAG antibodies. Each protein expressed alone was of the expected size (28.8, 37.9, and 70.6 kD, resp., including tag). Similarly, coexpression of protease with each of the 2 substrates resulted in the N-terminal cleavage products of the expected sizes.

In addition, in contrast to those in the cytoplasm of untreated cells, cytoplasmic capsids in NFV-treated cells were rarely observed to be enveloped (\u223c9 versus 0 in the fields shown; Figures 4(c) and 4(d)). Interestingly, although endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, the unfolded protein response (UPR), and autophagy are well known effects of NFV [16, [26] [27] [28] [29] , neither ER dilation nor the abundance of double-membrane bound vesicles consistent with autophagosomes appeared consistently different between NVF-treated and untreated HSV-1-infected cells.

The apparent change in molecular weight of these viral proteins was estimated to be consistent with the reduction in glycosylation [30] [31] [32] . To assess the effect of NFV on protein glycosylation in HSV-1infected cells, Eastern blotting was performed using lectins PNA, RCA-I, WGA, and ConA ( Figure 5(a) ).

In contrast, ConA staining was not appreciably reduced, suggesting relatively normal levels of oligomannose-type N-glycans. NFV resulted in a clear alteration in the subcellular localization of HSV-1 gB ( Figure 5(b) ) by immunofluorescent antibody staining. Compared with control treatments in which viral envelope glycoprotein staining uniformly delineated the plasma membrane of HSV-1-infected HF cells, with NFV treatment staining appeared predominantly perinuclear, suggesting improper trafficking to the cell surface.

In this study, we specifically explored the mechanism(s) by which NFV might inhibit production of infectious HSV-1 in vitro. We found that NFV acts on HSV-1 late in virus production, without a detectable effect on late viral gene expression. Furthermore, abundant virus particles were observed within infected cells, though envelopment and release of virus appeared to be substantially diminished. This is consistent with a recently published study by Kalu et al., which also reported that NFV blocked HSV-1 maturation and egress [25] .",

            "text": "NFV showed no activity on the VP24 protease, which was expected given that it is a serine protease that lacks structural or functional similarity with the HIV (aspartyl) protease. This was shown using a transfection system to examine enzymatic activity in trans and supports the finding that scaffold protein cleavage appears unaffected in HSV-1-infected cells treated with NFV [25] . No resistance to NFV could be selected under conditions that readily resulted in acyclovir-resistant HSV-1, which is again consistent with findings by Kalu et al. [25] . Though NFV-resistant HSV-1 may well be isolated using other conditions, this finding suggests a relatively high barrier to resistance in vitro and suggests a mechanism of action on a host cell function required for virus production, rather than a direct effect on a viral target [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] . Indeed, many of the cellular functions affected by NFV have similarly been described to play a role in HSV-1 replication. NFV inhibits cellular proteases and the proteasome, which leads to accumulation and inefficient removal of misfolded proteins in the ER and Golgi [16, 42, 43] . The finding that NFV resulted in impaired viral protein glycosylation and trafficking is consistent with these processes and again validates the recent findings by Kalu et al. [25] . Of note, based on ConA staining, N-linkage of immature (high mannose) carbohydrates appeared relatively normal [33] . These mannose structures are largely assembled in the cytoplasm, whereas trimming and modification of more complex sugar residues occur in the ER and Golgi. We found that the impairment of viral glycoprotein processing is at least one mechanism by which NFV reduces infectious HSV-1 production. Agents that induce ER stress, such as thapsigargin, similarly interfere with HSV-1 glycoprotein posttranslational processing and production of infectious virus [31] . Numerous studies have reported that tunicamycin, which blocks the synthesis of the N-acetylglucosamine-lipid intermediates, and other inhibitors of protein glycosylation decrease the infectious yield of HSV-1 in vitro [44] [45] [46] . Furthermore, tunicamycin does not affect the level of late viral gene product expression, and normal appearing capsids were noted within the cytoplasm, similar to the effects we observed with NFV. It is unclear, however, whether impaired HSV-1 envelope protein glycosylation would block virus egress based on studies using cell lines deficient in N-acetylglucosaminyl transferase activity, in which virus yield was only mildly reduced [47] .",

HSV-1 encodes genes to block autophagy in infected cells, including infected cell protein (ICP) 34.5, which is required for neurovirulence [48] . Increased levels of autophagy can reduce production of infectious HSV-1 similarly to NFV, with relatively normal viral gene expression and formation of viral particles that are retained within cells [49, 50] . We were not able to formally show that NFV increased autophagy in HSV-1 infected cells under the conditions used. NFV treatment appeared to result in retention of cytoplasmic virus particles within single membranebound vesicles that could be late autophagosomes as in other reports [49, 50] . However, pathognomonic doublemembrane structures were not convincingly observed in greater numbers in NFV-treated versus untreated HSV-1infected cells nor were we able to show that NFV increased LC3-II staining during HSV-1 infection. Autophagy can be difficult to demonstrate [51] and cannot currently be excluded as a potential contributor to the effect of NFV on HSV-1 or other HHVs [48] .",
