            "text": "Bacterial and viral infections are often clinically indistinguishable, leading to inappropriate patient management and antibiotic misuse. Bacterial-induced host proteins such as procalcitonin, C-reactive protein (CRP), and Interleukin-6, are routinely used to support diagnosis of infection. However, their performance is negatively affected by inter-patient variability, including time from symptom onset, clinical syndrome, and pathogens. Our aim was to identify novel viral-induced host proteins that can complement bacterial-induced proteins to increase diagnostic accuracy. Initially, we conducted a bioinformatic screen to identify putative circulating host immune response proteins. The resulting 600 candidates were then quantitatively screened for diagnostic potential using blood samples from 1002 prospectively recruited patients with suspected acute infectious disease and controls with no apparent infection. For each patient, three independent physicians assigned a diagnosis based on comprehensive clinical and laboratory investigation including PCR for 21 pathogens yielding 319 bacterial, 334 viral, 112 control and 98 indeterminate diagnoses; 139 patients were excluded based on predetermined criteria. The best performing host-protein was TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) (area under the curve [AUC] of 0.89; 95% confidence interval [CI] , 0.86 to 0.91), which was consistently up-regulated in viral infected patients. We further developed a multi-protein signature using logistic-regression on half of the patients and validated it on the remaining half. The signature with the highest precision included both viral-and bacterial-induced proteins: TRAIL, Interferon gamma-induced protein-10, and CRP (AUC of 0.94; 95% CI, 0.92 to 0.96). The signature was superior to any of the Introduction Antibiotic overuse, typically stemming from use of these drugs to treat non-bacterial infections, has severe global health and economic consequences, including the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria [1, 2] . Antibiotic underuse due to delayed or missed diagnosis is also common (24%-40% of all bacterial infections) [3] [4] [5] [6] , and may result in prolonged disease state and medical complications [7] [8] [9] [10] . A major cause of antibiotic overuse and underuse is the difficulty of distinguishing between bacterial and non-bacterial (mostly viral) etiologies [3, 11] . While routinely used microbiological diagnostic tests such as culture, serology, and more recently nucleic acid based tests (e.g., RT-PCR) can assist the clinician in the etiological determination of the underlying infectious process, several challenges remain. These include: (i) pathogen detection in cases where the infection site is not readily accessible (e.g., pneumonia), or is unknown (e.g., fever without source); (ii) time to microbiological laboratory results may be lengthy (hours or days); (iii) interpreting whether a detected bacteria is the disease causing agent or a mere colonizer [12] [13] [14] , and (iv) identification of a virus does not preclude the possibility that an undetected bacteria may be the cause of the underlying illness (i.e. a case of mixed infection with both virus and bacteria) [15, 16] .",

            "text": "An approach that has the potential to address these challenges relies on monitoring the host's immune-response to infection, rather than direct pathogen detection [17] . Recent studies examining host-RNA signatures in response to different infections show promising results [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . However, quantitative and rapid measurements (within minutes) of multiple host-RNAs in the clinical setting remain a technical challenge, especially at the point-of-care where most antibiotics prescriptions are made. Circulating host-proteins are an attractive alternative as they can be rapidly measured at the point of need. Proteins that are routinely used to support diagnosis of infection include procalcitonin, C-reactive protein (CRP), and Interleukin-6 (IL-6) [22] . However, these markers are sensitive to inter-patient variability, including time from symptom onset, clinical syndrome, and pathogen species [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] . For example, multiple studies found that procalcitonin is valuable for guiding antimicrobial therapy duration and for predicting disease severity [28] [29] [30] , however its diagnostic accuracy for detecting bacterial etiology in cases such as sepsis and pneumonia has been challenged [23, [31] [32] [33] [34] . Elevated CRP levels are suggestive of a bacterial infection [35] , but similar levels may be observed in patients with some viral strains (e.g., adenovirus and influenza) [36] , and inflammatory diseases. While IL-6 rises quickly in response to a bacterial trigger, its utility is dampened by a limited window of opportunity for measurement due to its rapid decay within approximately 36 hours [37] .",

This may be explained by the predominant focus on bacterial-induced proteins (e.g., procalcitonin, IL-6, IL-8, SAA, CRP and sTREM), which share biological pathways, and are thus inherently sensitive to the same factors. Therefore, we reasoned that the combination 'author contributions' section. Galit Denkberg is employed by Applied Immune Technologies.

First, we performed a thorough clinical and microbiological investigation for each patient as described above.

For adult patients the panel included the attending physician and two infectious disease specialists, while for children it included the attending pediatrician, an infectious disease expert and a senior attending pediatrician. Each panel member assigned one of the following diagnostic labels to each patient: (i) bacterial; (ii) viral; (iii) no apparent infectious disease or healthy (controls); and (iv) indeterminate. Patients diagnosed by the panel as having mixed infections (bacteria and virus) were labeled as bacterial because they are managed similarly. The panel members were blinded to the labeling of their peers to prevent group pressure or influential personality bias as recommended by NHS-HTA [46] .

Next, we analyzed the degree to which alternative strategies for determining the reference standard affect performance [44, 46] . Two strategies were applied. First, the Unanimous sub-cohort, whereby patient diagnosis was unanimously assigned by all three panel experts (n Total = 639, n Bacterial = 256, n Viral = 271, n Control = 112), yielded an AUC of 0.96\u00b10.02 using leave-10%-out cross-validation.

Such bacteria pose a considerable diagnostic challenge, because merely detecting them does not necessarily imply a causative role in the disease; therefore, appropriate treatment may remain unclear. Accordingly, we asked whether the performance of the signature is affected by the presence of colonizers. Streptococcus pneumoniae (SP) and Haemophilus influenzae (HI), detected by PCR on nasal swabs, were the two most common bacteria found in the study group (Table 1) . High rates of SP and HI were observed amongst both bacterial and viral patients (SP: 36% and 47%; HI: 20% and 32%), substantiating the understanding that their mere presence does not necessarily cause disease [12] . We stratified the patients based on whether or not they had SP (SP+: n Bacterial = 116, n Viral = 157; SP-: n Bacterial = 203, n Viral = 177) and compared the AUC performance of the two groups. We did not observe a significant difference (0.93\u00b10.03 vs 0.94\u00b10.02, P = 0.31). The presence or absence of HI did not affect signature performance either (0.94\u00b10.04 vs 0.93\u00b10.02; HI+: n Bacterial = 63, n Viral = 106; HI-: n Bacterial = 256, n Viral = 228, P = 0.34).

(iii) Identification of a virus does not exclude the possibility of mixed infection involving an undetected bacteria [15, 16] . The signature classifies mixed infections with pure bacterial infections, thus prompting physicians to manage both groups similarly with regard to antibiotic treatment.

Six hundred host-proteins were screened (Fig. 1B) , which to the best of our knowledge, is the largest quantitative proteome screening of patients with acute infection to date. Bioinformatics analysis was then used to identify a combination of three proteins with complementary dynamics: (i) We found that TRAIL was induced in response to a wide range of viral infections and surprisingly, also exhibited significantly reduced levels in bacterial infected patients ( Fig. 2  and 4 ). Such opposing dynamics make TRAIL particularly suitable for distinguishing between bacterial and viral infections. The increase in viral patients may be related to TRAIL's role in programed cell death, which is a mechanism of infected cells to inhibit the virus from spreading [47] . The underlying reason for its reduction in bacterial infections warrants further studies. (ii) IP-10 levels were highly elevated in viral patients and less elevated in bacterial patients ( Fig. 2 and 4) . (iii) CRP levels were highly elevated in bacterial patients and less elevated in viral patients ( Fig. 2 and 4) . While the utility of increased CRP levels to suggest bacterial infections is well established [49] , viral-induced proteins such as TRAIL are not used in clinical practice. The combination of novel viral-induced proteins that complement routinely used bacterial-induced proteins, substantially contributed to the signature's robustness across a wide range of subgroups.",

Several strategies can be applied, each with strengths and limitations [46] . Clinical suspicion confirmed by positive microbiological lab results is often used as a reference standard. However, limitations include false-positives due to technical issues (e.g., culture contamination [50, 51] and uncertainty due to viral and bacterial carriage [12] [13] [14] ). Moreover, these patients may represent the more severely ill, and potentially easier to diagnose cases, leading to overly optimistic performance. The expert panel diagnosis is another widely used approach [44, 46] . It has the advantage of capturing a wider spectrum of illness severities including difficult-to-diagnose cases, and is therefore likely to generalize well to clinical practice [44, 46] . However, the absence of a microbiological confirmation may lead to higher rates of mislabeling. Since these methods complement each other we applied both. A microbiologically confirmed reference standard was used for proof-of-principle on a sub-cohort of the patients yielding particularly high performance (AUC = 0.96\u00b10.02), and the expert panel reference standard was used to generalize the results to the entire patient cohort (AUC = 0.94\u00b10.02).

However, this diversity makes it more challenging to control for confounding factors. Although we did not identify significant confounders, follow-up studies on homogenous subgroups are warranted.",
