Pneumonic AECOPD was defined as a new infiltrate on chest radiograph with features of lower respiratory tract infection in COPD patients [1, 11, 12] . We used the pneumonia severity index (PSI) to estimate severity [13] . A systematic search for bacteria with standard methods and for viruses with sensitive methods (i.e., PCR and RT-PCR methods), as reported elsewhere [6, 12, [14] [15] [16] were performed. Briefly, sputum or tracheal aspirates were bacteriologically processed if less than 1% of the observed field contained squamous epithelial cells and more than 25 neutrophils were observed [17] . Pneumonia was considered bacteriologically confirmed when at least one of the following criteria were present: pathogen concentration greater than 10 5 cfu/mL in tracheobronchial aspirations or sputum samples; blood culture positive for a bacterial pathogen in the absence of an extrapulmonary focus [17] [18] [19] . In addition, a serological diagnostic for antibodies to Legionella pneumophila was performed by indirect immunofluorescence, associated with a detection of Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 antigen in urine samples in all patients.",

Based on these results we hypothesize that a PCT level cut off > 0.1 \uf06dg/L may be more appropriate than 0.25 (previously proposed for non severe lower respiratory tract infection [9] [10] [11] to predict the probability of a bacterial infection in severe COPD Distribution of the highest procalcitonin level measurements (PCTmax) and microorganism findings in chronic obstructive pul-monary disease (COPD) patients with pneumonia Figure 1 Distribution of the highest procalcitonin level measurements (PCTmax) and microorganism findings in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients with pneumonia.

PCT levels were not different in patients who had received antibiotics within the month or 24 hours prior to ICU admission, compared to antibiotic-naive patients (PCT-H0 0.695 \uf06dg/L [0.202-1.139] vs 0.470 \uf06dg/L [0.088-1.471], p = 0.73 and PCT-H0 0.942 \uf06dg/L [0.202-22.110] vs 0.438 \uf06dg/L [0.088-0.902], p = 0.22, respectively). In addition, steroids prior to ICU admission did not influence PCT levels (p = 0.76). PCT-H0 was significantly higher when abnormal breath sounds or rales were present (PCT-H0 1.661 \uf06dg/L [0.745-26.83] vs 0.207 \uf06dg/L [0.086-0.470], p = 0.0005) and when fever > 38\u00b0C was present; PCT-H0 1.495 \uf06dg/L [0.828-56.48] vs 0.272 \uf06dg/L [0.087-0.902], p = 0.0.05). No association was found between PCT-H0 levels and the presence or absence of sputum and cough. The PCTmax was < 0.1 \uf06dg/L in 3/32 patients (9%), between 0.1 and 0.25 \uf06dg/L in 7/32 patients (22%), and > 0.25 \uf06dg/L in 22/32 patients (69%), including 20 patients with PCTmax > 0.5 \uf06dg/L.
