            "text": "Influenza A virus (IAV) is a major cause of respiratory illness. Given the disease severity, associated economic costs, and recent appearance of novel IAV strains, there is a renewed interest in developing novel and efficacious \"universal\" IAV vaccination strategies. Recent studies have highlighted that immunizations capable of generating local (i.e., nasal mucosa and lung) tissue-resident memory T and B cells in addition to systemic immunity offer the greatest protection against future IAV encounters. Current IAV vaccines are designed to largely stimulate IAV-specific antibodies, but do not generate the lung-resident memory T and B cells induced during IAV infections. Herein, we report on an intranasally administered biocompatible polyanhydride nanoparticle-based IAV vaccine (IAV-nanovax) capable of providing protection against subsequent homologous and heterologous IAV infections in both inbred and outbred populations. Our findings also demonstrate that vaccination with IAV-nanovax promotes the induction of germinal center B cells within the lungs, both systemic and lung local IAV-specific antibodies, and IAV-specific lung-resident memory CD4 and CD8 T cells. Altogether our findings show that an intranasally administered nanovaccine can induce immunity within the lungs, similar to what occurs during IAV infections, and thus could prove useful as a strategy for providing \"universal\" protection against IAV.",

            "text": "Influenza A virus (IAV) is a common respiratory pathogen that undergoes seasonal antigenic drift continually giving rise to variant strains that can escape existing immune protection. This viral drift detrimentally impacts public health as well as the economy within the United States, which is exemplified by the \u223c310,000 hospitalizations, 12,000 deaths, and an $87 million-dollar financial burden observed during the 2015-2016 season (1, 2) . Traditionally, the spread of IAV has been prevented by two vaccination strategies: inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) and live-attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV). Both IIV and LAIV primarily provide systemic immunity by inducing IAV-specific antibody responses (3, 4) . However, it is less clear if these vaccination strategies generate robust de novo IAV-specific CD4 or CD8 T cell responses within the lower lung mucosa (4) (5) (6) (7) . Due to its intramuscular delivery, IIV is not thought to drive airway-resident effector T cell responses (6) . Although LAIV has been shown to induce T cell responses within the lungs of mice following whole lung inoculation (6) , when LAIV vaccination has been limited to the upper respiratory tract in animal models, similar to its replication location in humans, it does not induce T cell responses within the lower lung mucosa (7) .",

However, infection-induced immunity also confers protection through underlying T cell responses that can provide cross-strain protection. T cell-mediated heterosubtypic protection has been well described in animal models (10) (11) (12) (13) and was shown to confer increased protection in humans during the most recent 2009 H1N1 pandemic (12) . Furthermore, studies in animal models of IAV infection have demonstrated that the pulmonary immune system imprints effector T cells with lung homing capabilities as well as induces the formation of local tissue-resident memory T and B cells that are thought to provide optimal protection (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) . This tissue-resident phenotype is thought to depend on antigen longevity, antigen presenting cells (APC), and tertiary structures within the tissues (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) . Therefore, vaccines that utilize tissue-specific factors and pathways critical for the induction of pulmonary T and B cell responses to generate local as well as systemic immunity by mimicking IAV infection would be predicted to confer more robust protection.",

(24) (25) (26) . This platform offers several distinct advantages: the particles degrade into biocompatible products, activate APC, maintain the stability of encapsulated antigen, enable dose sparing of the antigen, and may be stored at room temperature or higher for up to 4 months thus breaking the cold chain (27, 28) . Another important feature of our nanoparticle technology is that it provides a sustained release of encapsulated antigen via surface erosion and acts as a long-term antigen depot. Therefore, it could mimic the antigen depot that occurs after IAV infections and potentiate tissue-resident memory formation (21, 22, 29) . However, the capability of intranasal (i.n.) administration of polyanhydride nanoparticles to induce local (i.e., lung) and systemic adaptive immunity, drive tissue-resident memory formation, and offer cross-strain protection against IAV has not yet been explored.",

Our results illustrate that i.n. vaccination with IAV-nanovax induced robust lung-resident germinal center (GC) B cells along with systemic and lung localized IAV-specific antibody responses. Notably, similar to IAV infections, i.n. administered IAV-nanovax induced lungresident memory CD4 and CD8 T cell responses.

To identify B cell subsets, cells were stained with rat anti-mouse CD19 (1D3; BD Biosciences), rat anti-mouse B220 (RA3-6B2; BioLegend), rat anti-mouse IgM (B7-6), and FITC-conjugated peanut agglutinin (PNA; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Cells were then fixed with BD FACS TM Lysing Solution per manufacturer's instructions and resuspended in PBS. Data were acquired on a LSRII (BD Biosciences) and analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star, Ashland, OR).",

            "text": "Since the generation of IAV-specific antibody responses are frequently used to determine IAV vaccine efficacy, we began by analyzing B cell responses in the lungs following i.n. IAV-nanovax vaccination and compared the response to mice i.n. infected with IAV (PR8; H1N1), mice i.m. vaccinated with IIV, or mice that were left untreated (na\u00efve). In order to distinguish between lymphocytes embedded in the lung interstitium from those in the vasculature, we utilized an in vivo fluorophore-conjugated antibody labeling technique (34) (Supplemental Data Sheet 1) . To this end, mice were intravascularly (i.v.) infused prior to lung harvest with a fluorescent antibody to label B cells within the circulation (CD45i.v.Ab pos ) vs. those in the lung parenchyma (CD45i.v.Ab neg ) (Supplemental Data Sheet 1). Using this technique, we observed that total lung-resident B cells (CD19 pos B220 pos CD45i.v.Ab neg ) were significantly higher for IAV-infected and IAV-nanovax vaccinated mice compared to na\u00efve and IIV controls at 32 and 45 days following infection/vaccination (Figures 1A,D) . Consistent with the increase in total numbers in IAVinfected and IAV-nanovax treated mice, lung-resident GC B cells (CD19 pos B220 pos CD45i.v.Ab neg PNA pos ) were also significantly elevated at both time points (Figures 1B,E and Supplemental Data Sheet 1). Similar trends were also observed in the lung draining lymph nodes (data not shown). As GC B cell reactions result in class-switched B cells that produce higher affinity antibodies, we next compared the frequencies of IgM neg lung-resident GC B cells between IAV-infected and IAV-nanovax treated mice. As previously shown, IAV infection induces a substantial proportion of the GC response in the lungs to switch to IgG (IgM neg IgG pos ) (36) . Similar to IAV-infected mice, approximately 70% of lung resident GC B cells were IgM neg in IAV-nanovax mice, a finding consistent with a robust, mature GC response (Figures 1C,F) . These results suggest that i.n. administration of IAV-nanovax induces lung-resident GC B cell responses capable of producing class-switched B cells to levels commensurate to those found in IAV-infected mice at 45 days following infection/vaccination.",

            "text": "To determine if the observed B cell responses generated IAVspecific antibodies, we quantified total IAV-specific IgG and IgA antibody following infection or vaccination. As expected, IAVspecific IgG responses were detected locally [i.e., bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)] and systemically (i.e., serum) in IAV-infected and IAV-nanovax vaccinated mice at 32 and 45 days following infection/vaccination (Figures 2A,B,D,E) . Interestingly, serum levels of IAV-specific IgG antibodies were \u223c2-3x higher in animals after IAV-nanovax and IAV infection than in mice receiving IIV (Figures 2A,D) . Mice receiving IIV also lacked robust IAV-specific IgG within the BAL as observed in IAVnanovax and IAV infected mice (Figures 2B,E) . This difference in measurable IAV-specific IgG within the BAL between IIV and IAV-nanovax is likely related to the lack of a local lung GC response in the IIV vaccinated mice (Figure 1) . Previous studies have demonstrated that IgA is present in the BAL after IAV infection (36) . Consistent with this idea we found that both IAVinfection and IAV-nanovax, but not IIV, induced IAV-specific IgA levels in the BAL (Figures 2C,F) . To determine the potential of these IAV-specific antibodies to contribute to protection from lethal dose IAV infections, we measured the capability of serum and BAL antibodies to inhibit IAV-hemagglutination. At 32 and 45 days post infection/vaccination, both IIV and IAV-nanovax vaccinated mice had serum hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) titers that were similar to IAV infected mice and well above the >1:40 mark that is associated with protection against subsequent IAV infection (Figures 2G) (43) . However, only IAV infected and IAV-nanovax vaccinated mice possessed protective levels of HAI antibodies within the BAL (Figure 2H) . Altogether, these results suggest that i.n. administration of IAV-nanovax induces both local and systemic IAV-specific antibody responses capable of providing protection against IAV infection.",

            "text": "Generation of GC B cell responses and class-switched antibodies are often associated with antigen-specific CD4 T cell responses. It has also been shown that IAV-specific CD8 T cells are important for control of IAV. Therefore, we determined the capacity of IAV-nanovax to elicit IAV-specific CD4 and CD8 T cell responses within the lungs. The CD4 T cell response to IAV has been shown to encompass a large number of epitopes, each only being expressed at low frequency (44) . Thus, in order to not bias the response by examining a single epitope specificity we utilized a surrogate marker staining strategy. This strategy identifies total antigen-experienced T cells (Figures 3A,B) , including those where epitopes have not been identified or are limited (38, 39) . Compared to na\u00efve mice, IAV infection and IAV-nanovax vaccination generated an increased frequency of antigen-experienced CD4 T cells (AgExp CD4; CD4 pos CD11a hi CD49d pos ) and antigen-experienced CD8 T cells (AgExp CD8; CD8 lo CD11a hi ) within the lungs at days 7, 32, and 45 (Figures 3A,B) . We further observed that a vast majority of these AgExp CD4 and AgExp CD8 T cells were resident within the lung tissue (CD45i.v.Ab neg ) based on in vivo antibody labeling in IAV-nanovax vaccinated mice, similar to that observed following IAV-infection (Figures 3A,B) . Importantly, these lung-resident AgExp CD4 and CD8 T cells in IAV-nanovax vaccinated mice were found in higher numbers compared to na\u00efve and IIV vaccinated mice at 7, 32, and 45 days post vaccination (Figures 3C-H) . Although numbers of lung-resident AgExp CD4 and CD8 T cells were higher early (day 7) in IAV-infected mice compared to IAVnanovax mice (Figures 3C,F) , IAV-nanovax was capable of inducing T cell responses of a similar magnitude to those observed in the IAV infected lung at later time points (Figures 3D,E,G,H) FIGURE 2 | IAV-nanovax vaccination induces both lung and systemic IAV-specific antibody responses. C57BL/6 mice were vaccinated/infected as described in Figure 1 . At 32 and 45 days post challenge/vaccination, serum and BAL were collected.

Further, since IAV-nanovax induced pulmonary CD4 and CD8 T cell responses within the lungs by day 7 post vaccination (i.e., prior to the boost, Figure 3 ) we additionally compared protection after a prime only vs. a prime+boost vaccination schedule. Forty-five days after the initial vaccination, mice were challenged with a lethal dose of homologous IAV (A/Puerto Rico/8/34). As expected, na\u00efve mice displayed substantial disease associated weight-loss (>20%), mortality (60%), and respiratory distress, as measured by increases in airway resistance (\u223c6 Penh); however, mice that received either prime only or prime+boost IAVnanovax administration exhibited reduced signs of morbidity and were completely protected against mortality (Figures 5A-C) . This alleviation of disease is commensurate to IIV vaccinated mice as similar trends of reduced morbidity and mortality were also observed for IIV prime+boost vaccinated mice compared to na\u00efve (Supplemental Data Sheet 2A-C) . Strikingly, IAVnanovax prime+boost mice exhibited little to no weight loss or increases in Penh demonstrating that this strategy provides more robust protection compared to prime only mice (Figures 5A,C) . Consistent with this disease amelioration, the IAV-nanovax prime+boost mice had significantly reduced lung viral titers 3 days following challenge indicating early control of viral replication (Supplemental Data Sheet 3) .",

To this end, prime only and prime+boost IAV-nanovax vaccinated mice were challenged with a lethal dose of a mouse-adapted heterologous strain of IAV (A/Hong Kong/68, H3N2). Early (days 1-5) following challenge, IAV-nanovax vaccinated mice showed similar levels of weight-loss but reduced respiratory distress (Penh) compared to na\u00efve mice (Figures 5D,F) . Furthermore, while 100% of na\u00efve mice succumbed to the highly stringent IAV challenge, both prime only (40%) and prime+boost (80%) IAV-nanovax mice were protected from mortality ( Figure 5E) . Additionally, the protection mediated by IAV-nanovax appears durable as protection was still observed in mice challenged with homologous and heterologous virus at 100 days post vaccination (Figure 6) . The ability to IAV-nanovax to confer protection against heterologous virus challenge is likely due to the local lung adaptive immune response induced by IAVnanovax as IIV vaccinated mice, which lack lung Trm (Figure 4) , had limited to no protection from a heterologous challenge (Supplemental Data Sheet 2D-F) . Furthermore, this protection FIGURE 5 | IAV-nanovax confers protection against subsequent homologous and heterologous IAV infection. C57BL/6 mice received one-dose i.n. of IAV-nanovax (prime only), two-doses i.n. of IAV-nanovax (prime+boost), or were left unvaccinated (naive). Forty-five days following the initial vaccination, mice were challenged with a (A-C) 1108 TCIU dose of A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1) or (D-F) 390 TCIU dose of A/Hong Kong/1/1968 (H3N2).

IAVnanovax vaccination significantly reduced/ablated morbidity (weight loss, Figures 7A,D; Penh, Figures 7C,F) and protected from mortality (Figures 7B,E) upon subsequent challenges. Thus, these results demonstrate that IAV-nanovax is able to protect against subsequent homologous and heterologous IAV infections in a translational outbred model.",

Likewise, the prime only vaccination reduced initial airway distress (Figure 5F) and provided a significant level of protection from mortality during a lethal-dose heterologous IAV challenge ( Figure 5E ). This protection against homologous and heterologous virus appears to be long lasting as IAV-nanovax vaccination also conferred protection in mice challenged at 100 days post vaccination (Figure 6 ). While the IAV-nanovax formulation tested herein contained only IAV HA and NP proteins, studies have demonstrated that immunity directed against additional IAV proteins such as NA and M1 can enhance protection (47, 48) . One of the benefits of our nanovaccine platform is the ability to easily \"plug and play\" new antigens within the formulation. Therefore, by incorporating IAV NA and M1 protein within future IAV-nanovax formulations we may be able to drive even more robust immunity and further improve protection against homologous and heterologous IAV infections.",

However, at some time points we did observe reduced IAV-specific IgG in IAV-nanovax vaccinated mice compared to IAV infection (day 45 serum, day 32 BAL, Figures 2B,D) . This reduction could be related to additional antigens available for targeting following IAV infection since IAV-nanovax only contains IAV HA and NP proteins. Consistent with this idea, HAI titers in the serum and BAL following IAV-nanovax were similar to those observed for an IAV infection and well above the 1:40 HAI titer associated with protection (43) suggesting that HA-specific antibodies are equal.",

Importantly, analysis of the lungs after IAV-nanovax vaccination found the presence of IAVspecific CD4 and CD8 T cells. These IAV-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells were within the lung parenchyma based on CD45 i.v.Ab exclusion staining (Figure 3) and expressed markers consistent with the canonical tissue-resident memory phenotypes. Lungresident memory CD4 T cells are primarily identified by CD69 expression following infection or vaccination (45) . While we observed CD69 pos CD103 neg CD4 Trm subset within the lungs of IAV-nanovax vaccinated mice, we unexpectedly observed a small proportion of CD69 pos CD103 pos CD4 T cells as well (Figures 4A,C) . Although this CD4 pos CD69 pos CD103 pos resident memory phenotype has not been well characterized, a study has reported this subset within the skin (49) . What role these CD69 pos CD103 pos CD4 T cells may play in protection against subsequent IAV infections remains to be determined.",

Preliminary studies also suggest that CD4 and CD8 Trm responses are present in the lungs out to at least day 100 (data not shown). Our prior studies have shown nanoparticles persist within the lungs for \u226514 days and the continual release of antigen from nanoparticles placed into other tissues \u226530 days following vaccination. Overall this suggests that IAV-nanovax may act as an antigen depot, similar to what is observed during IAV infections (21, 22) , and that this may contribute to the upkeep of lung-resident memory T cells.",

Further, this report demonstrates for the first time that i.n. vaccination with polyanhydride nanoparticles can induce tissueresident memory CD4 and CD8 T cells, confer protection against a heterologous virus challenge, and protect against infection in outbred populations.
