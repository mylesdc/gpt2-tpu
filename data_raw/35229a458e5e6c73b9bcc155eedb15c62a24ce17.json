Then, the questionnaire was completed by 290 staff members of Masih Daneshvari Hospital and its internal consistency and reproducibility were investigated using Cronbach's alpha coefficient and testretest method, respectively. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to assess its consistency and internal consistency (construct validity). Results: With the confirmation of the face and content validities, internal consistency (0.89) calculated by the Cronbach's alpha coefficient and reproducibility of the questionnaire (0.997; p<0.001) assessed by using the ICC Index, were approved. Following examining internal consistency and stability, the questionnaire convergent construct validity was also confirmed using confirmatory factor analysis. Conclusion: The questionnaire contained 42 items and it is beneficial to use it in the health care system to evaluate the ergonomic problems of the respirators and to have optimal choice in this respect. Also, it can be used in the promotion of the staffs' behavior in wearing these respirators when necessary.",

The use of personal protective equipment by health care workers is one of the most crucial measures to protect them against diseases. In this regard, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) proposed the N95 respirator masks in order to prevent the spread of infection through the air (1, 2) . The N95 respirator masks are compressed facial masks, so that they should be fixed on the face to provide respiratory protection (3) . A significant concern in the use of these masks is their reliability to impede the contaminant transport to an individual's breathing tract. This depends upon the degree of adaptation and appropriateness of the respirator mask for the mask wearer (4) . Although ergonomic aspects of using masks and the relationship between respiratory masks, human beings, and environment (5) . However, taking the principles of ergonomics into account to design a device is of paramount importance and can be considered as a critical factor affecting its success (6) . Knowledge of ergonomics can be used for designing, constructing, and selecting a device through measuring its compliance with the user.",

The third issue raised in the field of ergonomics for the respirator masks is their impacts on the performance of individuals wearing them. Previous studies have shown that the respirator masks can prevent the mask wearers' performance. Some studies have also proposed that the mask wearers' performance is decreased as the performance of the respirator masks increases. Some studies have investigated the effects of the respirator masks on tasks such as walking, running, acting, and so on. Their effect on vision, hearing and physical, cognitive and psychomotor activities is also researched.

Since the AVE values are greater than the MSV and ASV values for all components, divergent validity is also established for all components.DISCUSSION After confirming the face and content validities, a 45item questionnaire was developed.
