Antibody responses in survivors 11 years after infection have been documented. However, this report is the first characterization of anti-Ebola virus antibody persistence and neutralization capacity 40 years after infection. Using ELISAs we measured survivor's immunological response to Ebola virus Zaire (EBOV) glycoprotein and nucleoprotein, and assessed VP40 reactivity. Neutralization of EBOV was measured using a pseudovirus approach and plaque reduction neutralization test with live EBOV. Some survivors from the original EBOV outbreak still harbor antibodies against all 3 measures. Interestingly, a subset of these survivors' serum antibodies could still neutralize live virus 40 years postinitial infection. These data provide the longest documentation of both anti-Ebola serological response and neutralization capacity within any survivor cohort, extending the known duration of response from 11 years postinfection to at least 40 years after symptomatic infection.",

Outbreaks have occurred with increasing frequency throughout Central and Western Africa, with mortality rates ranging from 25% to 90% [2] [3] [4] [5] . EBOV is spread via direct or indirect transmission through contact with bodily fluids such as vomit, blood, and diarrhea. Transmission can be halted with early diagnosis, effective surveillance with contact tracing, patient isolation, and safe burial practices [5] . However, the failure of quarantine methods in the recent West African outbreak have highlighted the fragility of health infrastructures and the urgency to better understand the ecology of EBOV and develop targeted and effective viral therapies [6] .",

The index case was a 44-year-old man who was treated at Yambuku hospital for epistaxis, dysentery, and fever. Between August 26 and November 5, 318 cases were recorded, resulting in 280 deaths, and 38 serologically confirmed survivors, with a case-fatality rate of 88%. The factors associated with transmission included receipt of injection with a reusable syringe, and close contact with an acute EVD case [2] . Six additional outbreaks have since occurred in DRC between 1977 and 2014 [8] , and in May of 2017 there was yet another Ebola outbreak that occurred within the Likati Health Zone, a region just 150 km away from where the 1976 outbreak occurred (Figure 1 ).",

The duration of antibody response and neutralization potentials in survivors who were infected more than 11 years prior is unknown. While documentation of long-term antibody maintenance in Ebola survivors remains limited, others have demonstrated that antibody presence against other viruses such as Lassa can be retained for significant durations of time [11] . Furthermore, no retrospective characterization of the immunological responses in survivors of the 1976 Yambuku outbreak has been previously reported. To investigate this, we obtained blood samples from 14 remaining survivors infected during the 1976 Yambuku outbreak, to assess the serological immune profile and retention of EBOV neutralizing antibodies 40 years postinfection, providing the longest documentation of such measures in EVD cases.",

Currently, there is a growing body of evidence that offers hope for finding ways to pharmacologically mimic or boost the natural resistance that some individuals appear to have towards EBOV infection. Viral proteins play a key role in host-virus interactions in EBOV infection [25] and the GP is the major determinant of entry and cellular tropism, an important protein involved in pathogenesis [14] , and the primary target for protective immunity. However, in addition to GP, NP or other viral proteins could individually or synergistically constitute effective targets for future vaccine therapy [26] .

Additionally, these data represent the longest documented serological response to individual recombinant Ebola viral proteins (GP, NP, and VP40) and live EBOV. Until now, the longest duration of antibody responses to EBOV infection measured had been 11 years [9] , thus our study provides evidence that antibody responses against EBOV can be long-lived and extend significantly further beyond known filovirus infections than previously documented.

These findings are comparable to an earlier study of serological responses to the related Sudan Ebola virus (EBOV-S), suggesting that VP40 appears to be less commonly immunogenic than GP or NP [27] . As a gold standard, live EBOV neutralization was measured using a PRNT to determine if these EVD survivor samples could neutralize actual virus in vitro 40 years after infection. Four (29%) survivors had anti-Ebola neutralizing titers, 2 of which also demonstrated strong neutralization using the pseudovirus assay. As noted, the PRNT curve for ES-12 is atypical, raising the possibility that the mode of neutralization for this particular survivor may not be EBOV specific, but rather nonspecific inhibition. Of the 4 survivors with neutralizing antibodies, all reacted to viral protein GP, with survivors 4 and 8 being considered strongly reactive, and survivors 12 and Unlike other studies that have shown that human sera containing Mannose-binding lectin can enhance instances of neutralization of EBOV and MARV pseudovirus [28] , here it appears that compliment did not have any significant effect on enhancing antibody-mediated EBOV neutralization capacity. More work will be necessary to accurately assess the best measures for predicting neutralization, as there is variability in neutralizer response to GP, NP, and VP40. However, as an initial screen, those who are NP and GP reactive appear more likely to neutralize the virus in downstream applications. Given that within this study cohort, the majority of survivors react at least mildly to GP, yet are unable to neutralize may indicate that GP response is not necessarily the best indicator of downstream neutralization. Additionally, 1 of the strongest PRNT neutralizers had extremely low response to GP, yet high responses to NP and VP40. However, it is also important to note that protective antibodies are not necessarily always neutralizing using in vitro assays [29] , and leads to the possibility that in vivo, our survivor cohort may all be protected from reinfection, because there have not been documented cases of reinfection with EBOV.",

However, these results agree with previous studies, which have found known survivors harboring detectable antibodies against viral proteins or full virus antigen [9, 10, 27] . Interestingly, survivor ES-8, whose sera demonstrated the greatest ability to neutralize live virus, was the only health-care worker enrolled in our study, indicating that these types of individuals should be investigated in greater depth during future research. Questionnaire data from this individual indicated multiple exposures to Ebola during the outbreak, with percutaneous exposure as well as contact with patient bodily fluids. The high levels of immunoreactivity seen in other individuals may also be the result of re-exposure through asymptomatic, endogenous, or sylvatic sources in an endemic region [25, 30, 31] , although as mentioned, human reinfection with EBOV has not been documented. Another possibility is that related viruses may also stimulate EBOV humoral immunity, enabling this continued protective response observed in some survivors [27] . Alternatively, these individuals may have inherent genetic or regulatory differences that enable them to retain EBOV response and neutralization capabilities long after initial infection, whereas others lose this ability at a more rapid rate. Irrespective of mechanism, these survivors with specific, potent, and enduring immunological responses may guide beneficial research in preventing or treating EVD in inevitable future reoccurrences. Participants in this study represent the long-term survivors of EVD from the 1976 Yambuku outbreak, those that survived long enough to be included in this study, which may not be a representative sample of survivors from this first documented outbreak. However, these individuals are the only known living survivors of the first recorded EBOV outbreak in history and represent a unique and highly important cohort, enabling the opportunity to glean insight into the long-term immune response against this potent pathogen. Life expectancy of this population is among the lowest in the world (58 for males, 62 for females) [32] , and to find survivors 40 years after one of the deadliest Ebola outbreaks recorded presented numerous challenges, yet better than expected outcomes. This is an aging cohort and the aperture for studies of this nature is rapidly closing. Additional studies of the Yambuku survivors may provide an understanding of the health challenges that will face the survivors from the large West African Ebola outbreak.",
