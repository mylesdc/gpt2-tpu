Information on results and potential benefits of NHP research therefore remains unavailable. To fill this gap in knowledge, this study identified all published NHP research studies funded by the MRC, Wellcome Trust and Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) from January 1997 to July 2012 and assessed full texts for medical relevance. In total, 284 papers were identified, of which 51 (18%) involved invasive NHP research, compared to 176 (61%) which used NHP tissue and cell lines, indicating a shift in research emphasis from invasive whole animal to cell-based research. Of these studies, 98 (35%) were medically relevant, of which 22 had potential therapeutic or public health applications. The relatively low proportion of medical studies together with the small number of applied studies raises questions over the level of investment in medical research and the effectiveness of knowledge transfer from basic to applied research. Implementation of the Bateson Review's Recommendation 4 would address these questions.",

The Review Panel, led by Professor Sir Patrick Bateson, recommended, inter alia, that 'Science policy-makers together with the public sector, private sector and charitable funders of research should commission a working group to develop proposals for a mechanism (outputscanning) to identify research results with potential to deliver improvements to healthcare or other significant benefits to society, and to assess the extent to which the potential benefits are achieved' (Recommendation 4). 2 The MRC has indicated that this recommendation 'is not currently being taken forward, as we have prioritised work on other recommendations in the Bateson Review'. Consequently, factual information on NHP research results and their medical relevance remains unavailable to the public and wider medical profession. This study provides this information.",

The writer could find no comparable data from previous years, but it is submitted that this represents a change in research emphasis from invasive whole animal studies to cell-based molecular and genetic research. In particular, the change means that basic medical and biological research now share common ground in respect of cellular research methods and materials, offering the opportunity for coordination of biological studies of normal cell function with medical studies of cell function in disease. The reduction in invasive NHP studies should reduce harm to animals and will hopefully lead to a reduction in the level of opposition to NHP research and aggression towards researchers, as well as encouraging charitable support. The shift in research emphasis is also relevant to the ethical debate: overall, 193 (68%) of the studies were non-invasive in NHPs or other animals and therefore in accord with the Beauchamp and Childress principle of non-maleficence 25 and the medical axiom of 'First do no harm'.",

This, however, is broadly in line with the findings of the Cooksey Review of 2006, which cited the UK Clinical Research Collaboration analysis showing that around two-thirds of public and charitable funding of health research was invested in basic science projects. The Review considered that current funding levels for basic science should be maintained, but recommended: 'that future increases in funding should be weighted towards translational and applied research until a more balanced portfolio is achieved'. 26 Both Government and research funders will be aware of the recommendation and investment in medically relevant NHP research will hopefully rise to a level equivalent to that of basic biological research.",

The small number (22 including three reviews) of applied medical studies was therefore a cause for concern. If this is a fair representation of translation of basic research from earlier years, it suggests that research results may not always have been taken forward into applied studies, echoing the Bateson Review Panel's finding that 'some evidence was provided of the translation of fundamental science into applied science and practical application, but in many cases too little consideration was given to effective knowledge transfer'. 2 On the other hand, the low level of translation may have been due, at least in part, to legitimate negative research findings. There is insufficient information on which to draw conclusions. Whatever the reasons, in order to determine the true level of translation, it is important that all studies of potential value for human health are identified and followed up. Implementation of the Bateson Review's Recommendation 4 would meet this need.",
