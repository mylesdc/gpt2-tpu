Because HBoV is able to persist in the infected tissues, induces pro-fibrotic and pro-cancerogenic cytokines in vivo and in vitro, and is detected in colorectal and lung tumors, the virus may be involved in cancerogenesis at least as a cofactor. Recently it was shown that the adenotonsillar tissue is an important site of HBoV1 persistence and replication. Considering the background that approximately 60% of oropharyngeal cancers were thought to be attributable to a HPV infection, a co-participation of HBoV in terms of a chronic virus infection might play a role in the cancerogenesis of tonsil tumors.",

By use of an in vitro cell culture model with primary tonsil fibroblasts, keratinocytes, and lymphocytes infected by HBoV we tried to find the target cells of virus replication. MSI testing was based on a previously published protocol using a de-multiplexed PCR followed by fluorescent detection of PCR products in a capillary sequencing device.",

The FISH analysis revealed both double infection of HPV and HBoV in the same cells as well as single infections of both viruses within the tumor tissue. Twenty-two of 62 HBoV positive tumors tested HPV negative, 40 of 62 tissue sections were HBoV and HPV positive. We analyzed 21 out of the 62 HBoV positive tumors for MSI. Of those four tonsils displayed MSI in at least 1 of 10 microsatellite markers.",

            "text": "Since the identification of human bocavirus 1 in nasopharyngeal aspirates in 2005, evidence is increasing that the HBoV1, belonging to the Bocaparvovirus genus of the Parvoviridae family, is associated with respiratory tract infections and gastrointestinal infections (Allander et al., 2005; Huang et al., 2012) . It is presumed that besides causing acute infections HBoV is persisting in a replicative but subclinical state, and is a pathogen rather than an innocent bystander (Proenca-Modena et al., 2014) . Previous studies suggest that HBoV is associated with some lung and colorectal tumors and prove that the bocavirus persistence is increased in cancer patients (Schildgen et al., 2013) . In 20% of colorectal and lung cancers formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues human bocavirus DNA could be detected. Li et al. (2007) revealed, that HBoV DNA commonly occurs in the serum of cancer patients and that the prevalence is significantly higher in this group than in that of the healthy control group (Addie et al., 2012) . It is also known that HBoV persists in adenotonsillar tissue, which is considered as the major replication site in vivo by some researchers (Clement et al., 2009) . Proenca-Modena et al. (2014) detected human bocavirus in 31.1% of 172 hypertrophic adenoids or tonsils from children. Szalmas et al. (2013) reported that the presence of HBoV displays a statistically significant correlation to Otitis media with effusion cases associated with adenoid hypertrophy. It could be shown that HBoV1 can persist in the infected host in form of cccDNA structures, similar to the human hepatitis B virus (HBV), leading to a chronic inflammation and culminating in organ-fibrosis (Lusebrink et al., 2011; Schildgen et al., 2014) . This observations are supported by a preceding study, which demonstrated that profibrotic and pro-cancerogenic chemokines are upregulated in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that HBoV is directly or indirectly involved in tumorigenesis (Khalfaoui et al., 2016) . In addition, given the fact that the incidence of human papillomavirus associated oropharyngeal cancer is increasing especially in developed countries, the search for infectious agents playing a role in human carcinogenesis in the range of the oropharyngeal tract and their identification are important issues (Marur and Forastiere, 2008) . In the case of HPV infection of the oropharynx it is presumed that the process toward malignant conversion is covering a long latency period between primary infection and cancer emergence (zur Hausen, 1999) . Due to the latent, chronic inflammation provoked by oncogenic viruses this mechanism could be similar in the presence of a chronic HBoV infection (Wang et al., 2008; Zeisel et al., 2015) . As animal models are still lacking for the exploration of HBoV infections, cell culture experiments and the analysis of clinical cohorts are necessary to elucidate the pathophysiology of replication, interaction with cells and other viruses and possible oncogenic effects. Taken together the previous findings lead us to the hypothesis that HBoV also persists in adult tonsillar tissue and Abbreviations: FFPE tissue, formaldehyde-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue; FISH, fluorescence in situ hybridization; Geq, genome equivalents; HBoV 1, human bocavirus 1; HBV, hepatitis B virus; HEK cells, human embryonic kidney cells; HPV, human papilloma virus; MMP-9, matrix-metalloproteinase 9; MOI, multiplicity of infection; MSI, microsatellite instability. may be even associated with oropharyngeal, especially tonsillar cancers.",

            "text": "In our study including 103 tonsil squamous cell carcinomas and 20 chronic infected tonsils, we detected human bocavirus DNA in 60.2% (n = 62) of all tonsillar tumors and in 37% (n = 7) of all chronic tonsillitis tissues. The data presented suggest that there is an association between the presence of HBoV and oropharyngeal squamous cell cancer, especially tonsillar carcinomas. The prevalence of HBoV is statistically significant higher in tonsillar tumor sections than in chronically inflamed tonsils (p = 0.037 by Chi-square test), which not only confirms the hypothesis that HBoV may be a causative pathogen in coinfection, but as well might imply that HBoV may be involved in cancerogenesis. Up to now it is not clearly verified whether HBoV persists in tumors as episomes in form of cccDNA, or whether it is integrated into the human genome but there are several studies concluding that the cccDNA structures, found in patients infected with HBoV may be viral genomes persisting in the cells (Kapoor et al., 2011; Lusebrink et al., 2011) . This mechanism would be similar to the human hepatitis B virus (HBV), a virus with high oncogenic potential because of its capacity to induce chronic inflammation, leading to liver fibrosis and consequently supporting cancerogenesis (Schildgen et al., 2014) . We could register multiple copies of HBoV DNA in the tumor cells due to replication or, as a matter of speculation, due to persisting episomes. This observation fits with our earlier observations when analyzing non-small lung cancers and colorectal tumors (Schildgen et al., 2013) . Additionally, the role of human parvovirus as a potential contributor to carcinogenesis has been discussed for parvovirus B19 with the reasonable suspicion that the virus is a causative agent of lung and colon adenocarcinomas due to chronic inflammation (Tabata et al., 2005; Li et al., 2007) . We could carefully speculate that HBoV as a single stranded DNA virus, persisting probably in form of cccDNA structures, can act in a similar way or utilizes related mechanisms like HBV. As no further respiratory pathogens were detected in the tonsillar tumors, the likelihood of a causal involvement of HBoV in the development of tonsillar tumors is increased. It is known that the incidence of human papillomavirusassociated oropharyngeal cancer is increasing especially in developed countries up to 60 to 80% (Kim, 2016; Marur and Forastiere, 2016) . This is why we analyzed and compared the presence of HPV in conjunction with HBoV DNA in tonsillar tumor tissue. PCR analyses of our study revealed a coinfection rate of 37.8% in tonsillar carcinomas and our data show that in 60% of these HPV and HBoV positive tumors the viral genomes occur within the same cells. Taking into account that it is not known which infection take place initially, this may mean that synergistic effects arise, which change the mode of cancerogenesis.",

            "text": "The observation that HBoV can persist in infected tonsil squamous cell carcinomas and chronic infected tonsils, similar to other oncogenic viruses, has to be discussed from different perspectives. One could indeed speculate that HBoV is only a harmless bystander, which just benefits of accelerated cell proliferation. The hypothesis that HBoV solely uses the cancer cells as their place of replication is supported by previous observations made with other parvoviruses. The majority of known parvoviruses is dependent on the cell cycle and are capable of replicating, probably exclusively, in actively replicating cells (in S phase). For this reason, they thrive in cancerous cells, often giving the false impression of being oncogenic (Canuti et al., 2014) . In addition, there is indeed a well-established relationship between cancer and parvoviruses but this is most likely the result of viral replication reactivation in the replicating cancer calls, causing an increased viral load and therefore a higher prevalence in cancer patients, compared to healthy subjects (Cotmore et al., 2014; Kishore and Kishor, 2014; Phan et al., 2016; Qiu et al., 2017) . In addition, some parvoviruses are known to be oncolytic, a fact that strongly argues against our hypothesis that HBoV is involved in tumorigenesis (Marchini et al., 2015) . In contrast, as an argument for our hypothesis, it has to noted that the group of Jianming Qiu from Kansas has shown that HBoV appears to be the first known autonomous parvovirus whose replication appears to be independent of the cell cycle, which is different from the parvoviruses mentioned above (Deng et al., , 2017 .",

Due to this fact the previous assumption becomes more unlikely. On the other hand it is also possible that HBoV could have an active or passive role in development of these tumors due to chronic inflammation, but because of lacking antibodies up to now it is not known which kind of viral proteins in the respective tumors are expressed and how they interact with cellular proteins. For this reason this hypothesis remains a matter of speculation but is supported by the increased prevalence of HBoV detection in higher tumor stages, the profibrotic and pro-cancerogenic cytokine patterns of HBoV infected in CuFi-8 air-liquid interphase cell cultures, HBoV positive BALs (Khalfaoui et al., 2016) , and the recent results of a whole transcriptome sequencing approach of HBoV-infected HAE-cultures, which revealed beside others evidence for bocaviral involvement in tumorigenesis of headand-neck cancers (Schildgen et al., submitted) .",

Independently, it turned out that HBoV and HPV occur in the same cells and their possible synergistic interaction with other environmental or inherited factors that eventually lead to malignant progression, will make it difficult if not impossible to classify solely a single agent as the causative factor (zur Hausen and de Villiers, 2014). Therefore, the present study is a good indicator for the direction of further studies, highly desirable to elucidate the role of HBoV in pathogenesis of oropharyngeal cancer. Finally, the fact that no increased MSI is observed in tonsillar tumors makes it unlikely that the virus interacts directly with the host genome but more likely persists in episomal form.",
