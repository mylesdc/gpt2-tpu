For standardizing the quantification, a plasmid (NPSC3.1) containing the HBoV NP-1 gene was used in serial dilutions covering a range of 6 logs. The criteria for a positive reaction were defined as the cycle threshold ,40 cycles and fluorescence count .0.5. The minimum genome viral load that would allow reproducible quantification was 10 copies per reaction, which corresponds to 500 copies/mL of respiratory tract aspirates.

These findings suggested that HBoV was one of the common pathogens for children with serious LRTIs. Although, increasing number of studies suggested the pathogenic potential of HBoV in young children with respiratory tract infections, however HBoVs were frequently detected in asymptomatic children's respiratory tract secretions, which may raise some justifiable concerns for etiology [1, [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] . The variation of HBoV detection in these studies was likely attributable to multiple factors, such as patient's age, season, geographic location, primer sensitivity, laboratory technique, true variation in incidence of HBoV, and methods used in sample collection. Some studies suggested that persistent virus shedding was therefore being a reasonable explanation for the high occurrence of HBoV in healthy subjects [20] . Moreover failure for follow-up on HBoV-positive asymptomatic children also led to high occurrence of HBoV detection in asymptomatic children. Recently, an in vitro study of HBoV infection in pseudostratified epithelial cells was established to confirm the virus uptake, transcription, and replication [30] . This study supports the concept that HBoV is a respiratory pathogen.",

Clearly, our results indicated potential co-infections will not influence clinical outcome of HBoV infection in respiratory tract.

Therefore the more severe lower respiratory tract symptom presented in high HBoV viral load patients may solely depend on HBoV viral load. In our study, HBoV viral load did not show significant influence on the presentations of upper respiratory tract infection symptoms, such as cough, rhinorrhea, however high HBoV viral load led to more severe lower respiratory tract symptoms and longer hospitalization. It was also indicated in vitro studies that viral infection resulted in the high IL-8 level and other pro-inflammatory molecules; these cytokines were likely to bring in additional neutrophils and also to cause hyper-responsiveness in bronchus, which could contribute to the severity of both upper and lower respiratory symptoms during the viral infection. In our study, the IL-8 level was significantly higher in patients with high HBoV viral loads that those who with low viral load. Overall, our findings indicated that the high HBoV viral loads played an important role in the severity of LRTIs, the symptoms and the duration of hospital stay.",

In our study, main clinical symptoms in HBoVpositive patients included cough (100%), wheezing (90.32%), and fever (41.94%). Although the existence of HBoV was not directly associated with the illness, some studies showed wheezing was the main manifestation of HBoV infection [2, 4, [37] [38] [39] . Our data was consistent with the findings in these studies and support the fact that wheezing was one of the most common symptoms presented in HBoV-positive patients. We also investigated the relationship between HBoV viral load and duration of wheezing, we found that the days of wheezing correlated with viral load. Emily et al documented that persistent HBoV shedding, may increase the duration of respiratory symptoms [6] . This report may explain the link between HBoV load and persistent wheezing. Because our study is a comprehensive clinical observation on HBoV-positive patients with severe LRTIs, failure of follow-up was one of the limitations to our study, which may led to the loss of some important data, such as the impact of persistent viral shedding on the infection prognosis during the acute viral infection. It is also important to assess the asthma development in these cases if possible. Table 8 .
