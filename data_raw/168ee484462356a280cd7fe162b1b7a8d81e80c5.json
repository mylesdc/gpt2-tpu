Although the pharmacological properties of these compounds include anticancer and anti-inflammatory activities, the antiviral effects of these compounds against human coronavirus (HCoV) remain unclear. Hence, the aims of the current study were to assess the antiviral activities of TET, FAN, and CEP and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms in HCoV-OC43-infected MRC-5 human lung cells. These compounds significantly inhibited virus-induced cell death at the early stage of virus infection. TET, FAN, and CEP treatment dramatically suppressed the replication of HCoV-OC43 as well as inhibited viral S and N protein expression. The virus-induced host response was reduced by compound treatment as compared with the vehicle control. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that TET, FAN, and CEP are potential natural antiviral agents for the prevention and treatment of HCoV-OC43 infection. Biomolecules 2019, 9, 696 2 of 16",

            "text": "anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and anti-oxidative activities [6] . TET exhibits broad pharmacological actions that include anti-inflammatory effects as well as immunosuppressant and anticancer activities [5] . Several studies have reported the effects of TET against the infection of different types of viruses such as herpes simplex virus, dengue virus, and Ebola virus [7] [8] [9] ; others have shown that FAN inhibits the replication of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) [10] and that CEP possesses antiviral activities against HIV-1 [11] and herpes simplex virus type 1 [12] . Coronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses that infect a broad range of animal species and cause multiple respiratory outcomes of varying severity, including the common cold, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia [13] . CoVs are subdivided into four genera (Alpha-, Beta-, Gamma-, and Delta-) [14] . Among the six CoVs isolated from humans [15], the World Health Organization declared that accelerated research and the development of antivirals for the treatment of emerging zoonotic viruses, including \u03b2-CoVs, Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV), are urgently needed [16]. Since the mid-1960s, human coronavirus strains OC43 (HCoV-OC43; \u03b2-CoV) and 229E (\u03b1-CoV) have been considered as mostly responsible for the common cold [17, 18] . Notably, HCoV-OC43, which is the most prevalent subtype of HCoV [19] , is responsible for up to 30% of respiratory infections and can cause repeated reinfections throughout life [20, 21] . Moreover, HCoV-OC43 is most closely related to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and shares several functional properties with both [22, 23] . Due to the similarities with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, HCoV-OC43 has been used as an alternative model for research of these emerging viral strains to avoid the limitation of the requirement for a biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) facility.",

Briefly, MRC-5 cells were cultured with two-fold serial dilutions of each compound (from 10 \u00b5M) and then infected with HCoV-OC43. The cytopathic effect of HCoV-OC43 in MRC-5 cells was determined at four dpi ( Figure 2A ). Live photo imaging showed HCoV-OC43-induced cell death in the vehicle-treated group ( Figure 2B ). In contrast, the MRC-5 cells in the TET, FAN, and CEP treatment groups remained morphologically unchanged. As shown in Figure 2C , compound treatment dose-dependently increased cell viability against HCoV-OC43 infection. In addition, no cytotoxicity was caused by the compounds within the effective ranges, even at a concentration as high as 10 \u00b5M (CC 50 > 10 \u00b5M). The IC 50 values of TET, FAN, and CEP were 295.6, 919.2, and 729.7 nM, respectively, which resulted in selectivity indices (CC 50 /IC 50 ) of > 40, 11, and 13, respectively ( Figure 2D ), suggesting that the antiviral activity of TET was more effective than that of FAN and CEP. Together, these data show that treatment with an effective dose of TET, FAN, and CEP has potential anti-HCoV-OC43 activities. ",

Briefly, MRC-5 cells were treated with 0.2, 1, and 5 \u00b5M of the compounds at 24 h before infection with HCoV-OC43 (pre-treatment). After washing to remove the compounds, MRC-5 cells were infected with HCoV-OC43 and cultured for four days. Additionally, compounds were added to the MRC-5 cell cultures during infection (co-treatment) or 24 h after infection (post-treatment) ( Figure 3A) . Interestingly, compound administration at 24 h after treatment significantly increased MRC-5 cell survival in a dose-dependent manner at a rate comparable to that of the co-treatment group ( Figure 3B-D) . However, when administered at 24 h post-treatment, the cell viability did not increase as much as in the pre-and co-treatment groups. Overall, these results demonstrate that TEN, FAN, and CEP have dose-and time-dependent anti-HCoV-OC43 activities. The cell survival against virus infection was more efficiently increased by the pre-and co-exposure of compounds than by exposure after infection. To more precisely verify the antiviral effects of TEN, FAN, and CEP over time, MRC-5 cells were treated with 5 \u00b5M concentrations of the compounds at 24, 12, 6, and 3 h before HCoV-OC43 infection, during infection, and at 12, 24, and 48 h post-infection ( Figure 4A ). As shown in Figure 4B , the viability of MRC-5 cells treated with the compounds before virus infection was increased as compared with that of the control vehicle group. Notably, TET, FAN, and CEP had highly effective antiviral activities for only 3 h of treatment before HCoV-OC43 infection, although CEP (61.1%) was not as effective as TET and FAN. In contrast, the viability of cells treated with the three compounds at 48 h after infection was similar to that of the untreated group, suggesting no antiviral effect at 48 h after infection. Together, these data suggest that TET, FAN, and CEP have antiviral activities for only 3 h of treatment before HCoV-OC43 infection and for 48 h of treatment after infection. These results indicate that TET, FAN, and CEP are most effective at the early stage of the HCoV-OC43 life cycle, and the timing of treatment is more important to protect against virus-induced cell death rather than the duration of cell exposure to the compounds.

The supernatants and cell lysates were harvested at 1, 2, 3, and 4 dpi. The abundance of viruses in the supernatants and cell lysates was quantified by measuring the HCoV-OC43 N protein RNA levels by qRT-PCR. As shown in Figure 5A ,B, virus infection promoted cell death and increased the release of HCoV-OC43 into the supernatants in a time-dependent manner. However, treatment with TET, FAN, and CEP significantly inhibited virus-induced cell death and the release of the virus into the supernatant. Moreover, the copy number of viral RNA peaked at two dpi and then slowly decreased in MRC-5 cell lysates in the vehicle group. However, compound treatment significantly decreased the copy number of viral RNA in cell lysates ( Figure 5C ). These results show that TET, FAN, and CEP can inhibit the replication of HCoV-OC43 in MRC-5 cells. Next, HCoV-OC43 N protein in the MRC-5 cells was visualized using fluorescence microscopy. As shown in Figure 5D , most of the vehicle-treated cells expressed the N protein at two dpi, whereas treatment with TET, FAN, and CEP highly decreased the expression of the N protein in MRC-5 cells. Additionally, the expression level of the S protein was determined in the lysate of virus-infected MRC-5 cells by western blot analysis ( Figure 5E ). The expression levels of HCoV-OC43 S protein remarkably increased at two dpi, although the levels were undetectable in the lysate of MRC-5 cells at one dpi (data not shown). However, the S protein was undetectable following compound treatment. In addition, the mRNA levels of sialic acid acetylesterase (SIAE) [24] were dramatically induced by HCoV-OC43 infection in MRC-5 cells at four dpi. The mRNA levels of SIAE following treatment with TET, FAN, and CEP were lower than with the vehicle control ( Figure 5F ). Collectively, these data suggest that TET, FAN, and CEP inhibited the replication of HCoV-OC43, the expression levels of the N and S proteins, as well as the virus-induced host response, as indicated by SIAE induction in MRC-5 cells.

            "text": "To investigate the antiviral effects of the compounds on HCoV-OC43-infected cells, the expression levels of IFN-related antiviral genes (IFN-\u03b11, IFN-\u03b21, and IFN-\u03bb1) and MxA were evaluated. HCoV-OC43 infection induced the expression of IFN-related antiviral genes in MRC-5 cell lysates at 1, 2, 3, and 4 dpi ( Figure 6A-C) . Compound treatment following virus infection reduced the mRNA expression levels of IFN-\u03b11, IFN-\u03b21, and IFN-\u03bb1. In addition, MxA mRNA expression was increased by compound treatment at one dpi as compared with virus-infected MRC-5 cells without compound treatment. However, at a later stage of infection, MxA mRNA levels following compound treatment were lower than those of the vehicle control ( Figure 6D ). To determine whether TET, FAN, and CEP modulate cytokine expression in HCoV-OC43-infected cells, the kinetics of various inflammatory cytokines (i.e., TNF, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and IL-12p70) in the cell culture supernatant were evaluated at four dpi. Notably, TNF, IL-10, and IL-12p70 were not detected in the MRC-5 cell culture supernatant following compound treatment (data not shown). Additionally, treatment with the compounds did not induce MRC-5 to produce the inflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and IL-8 ( Figure 7A ). As shown in Figure 7B , the expression levels of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and IL-8 were significantly upregulated by virus infection, but were reduced in the compound-treated group. These data indicate that HCoV-OC43 induced an antiviral response, and inflammatory cytokine production was reduced by treatment with TET, FAN, and CEP. Several studies have reported that TET enhances the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK [25, 26] . Therefore, to further elucidate the mode of action of TET in response to HCoV-OC43 infection, we investigated whether the p38 MAPK signaling pathway is activated by TET in virus-infected MRC-5 cells. The results showed that in HCoV-OC43-infected MRC-5 cells, p38 phosphorylation peaked at 30 min post-infection and then slowly decreased at 60 and 90 min. TET treatment induced an increase in the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK as compared with the vehicle-treated group ( Figure 8A ). To determine whether the activation of p38 MAPK has a role in the antiviral responses of host cells, virus-infected MRC-5 cells were treated with the MAPK signal activator ANM with and without 0.3 \u00b5M TET. As shown in Figure 8B , virus-induced cell death was decreased by ANM treatment in a dose-dependent manner with no indication of cytotoxicity, although the addition of ANM did not fully recover cell viability even at a concentration of 100 nM. However, the viability of HCoV-OC43-infected MRC-5 cells was similar to 100 nM ANM + 0.3 \u00b5M TET versus 100 nM ANM, suggesting that there was no synergistic effect of TET and ANM against HCoV-OC43. Collectively, these data indicate that TET induced the activation of p38 MAPK in HCoV-OC43-infected MRC-5 cells, and although the MAPK signal activator ANM had a partial antiviral effect, there was no synergistic effect of TET and ANM.

Considering the recent outbreak of new highly pathogenic HCoVs, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, further understanding the HCoV life cycle and the development of effective treatments are urgently needed. However, the manipulation of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV for diagnostic, culture, and research purposes should be carried out under BSL-3 conditions [28, 29] indicating a limitation to research accessibility. Several recent studies have shown that the genome of HCoV-OC43 encodes some well-conserved motifs shared with SARS-CoV, suggesting that HCoV-OC43 could be an alternative model for the study of emerging HCoVs, which should be conducted in a BSL-3 facility [22] .",

Likewise, the results of the present study showed that TET treatment promotes the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK in HCoV-OC43-infected MRC-5 cells (Figure 8 ). To investigate the influence of the activation of the MAPK signaling pathway by TET treatment on the antiviral effects of TET, ANM was added to the culture of virus-infected cells in the presence and absence of TET. The results showed that virus-induced cell death was reduced by up to 52% following the addition of ANM, suggesting a dose-dependent effect of ANM. However, the addition of 100 nM ANM plus 0.3 \u00b5M TET did not increase the survival of MRC-5 cells as compared with that of 100 nM ANM treatment only. Collectively, these data suggest that activation of the MAPK signaling pathway decreased virus-induced cell death, but there was no synergistic antiviral effect with the combination of TET and ANM.",

TET, FAN, and CEP significantly inhibited virus-induced cell death with no apparent cytotoxicity at the effective doses. Pretreatment with these compounds efficiently increased the viability of MRC-5 cells to the same extent as co-treatment. These results indicate that TET, FAN, and CEP can be applied for the prevention and treatment of HCoV infection. Treatment with TET, FAN, and CEP dramatically suppressed the replication of HCoV-OC43 in the supernatants and lysates of MRC-5 cells, the expression of viral S and N proteins, and the virus-induced host response. Moreover, TET induced the activation of the p38 MAPK pathway in HCoV-OC43-infected MRC-5 cells, and although the p38 activator ANM conveyed a partial antiviral effect, there was no synergistic effect with the addition of ANM. Taken together, these results demonstrate the potential of TET, FAM, and CEP for the prevention and treatment of HCoV-OC43 infection. ",
