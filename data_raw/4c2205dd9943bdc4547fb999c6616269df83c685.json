Although the cause(s) might very well be the culmination of simultaneous or sequential exposure to an array of chemical stressors (perhaps in conjunction with nonchemical stressors) at the needed concentrations for sufficient time and during critical windows of vulnerability (as dictated by health and nutritional status, age, sex, genetic susceptibility, etc.), it is worth considering possible new, plausible singular causes until each is ruled out.",

Churchill County happens to be the center of honey production in Nevada (Churchill Co. 2005; Michigan State University Extension 2002) ; honey is also produced in Cochise County. Honey has been a particular focus for PA contamination; levels can vary from hive to hive by two or more orders of magnitude within the same foraging location and by time of year.

Levels of metabolites insufficient for overt toxicity in adults could be passed from mothers to fetuses and nursing infants. Maternal transfer would also exempt the liver as the major target for the well-documented toxicity for these chemicals. Furthermore, ALL can originate in utero (Jensen et al. 2004) . Although best known for their hepatotoxicity (where the bioactive metabolites, such as the dehydropyrrolic products, lead to veno-occlusive diseases and cirrhosis), activated PAs can elicit significant genotoxicity and can be carcinogenic as well as anticarcinogenic (which has led to their experimental use in chemotherapy). Some PA adducts persist in tissues from which metabolites can be released, even long after initial exposure, and migrate to other tissues or can be transported to fetuses or nursing infants (Molyneux and James 1990). It is noteworthy that honey, milk, and grains are also common foods for infants.",

Significantly, a recent study (Jensen et al. 2004 ) points for the first time to a link between maternal diet and ALL, where consumption of carotenoids and glutathione (via vegetables) is proposed as being protective. Although linkages of cancer with diet often ascribe the cause to deficiencies or insufficiencies of essential or protective nutrients, just as likely would be the presence of particular chemical stressors-anthropogenic and natural toxicants alike. This finding of Jensen et al. (2004) fits nicely with the fact that glutathione conjugation in particular is known to be a major detoxification route for PAs. A coordinated investigation by epidemiologists, toxicologists, and environmental chemists of a PA-leukemia linkage could prove to be a prudent investment.",

In her letter I found at least three significant deviations from sound scientific methodology.

However, in employing these numbers in her letter, Silbergeld stated the units erro-neously and reported the results of Laskey et al. as 1.38-5.24 \u00b5g/kg/day inorganic arsenic. This single error inflated the alleged \"exposure\" rate by 7,000%, a significant miscalculation.

However, I do not agree that this mistake invalidates the conclusions of my letter. If the concentrations of arsenic in edible chicken meat are not onetenth of those in liver (as claimed by Alpharma, the manufacturer of roxarsone), then the exposure of Americans who consume chicken (such as my son, who appeared to exist largely on chicken wings during high school) is in fact 3-10 times higher than Lasky et al. estimated, resulting in an intake of 4-50 \u00b5g/day. This is still in excess of the current National Research Council (NRC) recommendation (NRC 2001) .",
