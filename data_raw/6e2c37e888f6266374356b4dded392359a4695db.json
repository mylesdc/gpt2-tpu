Great efforts have been made in developing more effective and less side-effects anti-herpes simplex virus agents, including traditional Chinese herbal medicines. In the present study, we evaluated the antiviral efficacy of Rheum tanguticum nanoparticles against HSV-1 in vitro and in vivo. R. tanguticum nanoparticles could inactivate the HSV-1 virions and block the viral attachment and entry into cells. Time-ofaddition assay indicated that R. tanguticum nanoparticles could interfere with the entire phase of viral replication. Besides, R. tanguticum nanoparticles showed the ability to inhibit the mRNA expression of HSV-1 immediate early gene ICP4 and early gene ICP8 as well as the expression of viral protein ICP4 and ICP8. Moreover, R. tanguticum nanoparticles have been proved to protect mice against HSV-1 induced lethality by decreasing the viral load and alleviated pathological changes in brain tissues. In conclusion, we demonstrated that R. tanguticum nanoparticles could inhibit HSV-1 infection through multiple mechanisms. These results suggest that R. tanguticum nanoparticles may have novel roles in the treatment of HSV-1 infection.",

            "text": "Rheum officinale, etc. The rhubarb contains several main chemical compositions such as anthraquinones, anthrones, stilbenes, tannins, polysaccharides, etc. (Cao et al., 2017) . These compositions show a wide range of pharmacological activities, including antioxidant, anti-tumor, anti-microbial and anti-inflammatory activities (Lai et al., 2015; Cao et al., 2017) . Moreover, anthraquinones derivatives like aloe-emodin, rhein, emodin, and chrysophanol, reportedly demonstrated antiviral effects (Semple et al., 2001; Lin et al., 2008; Schwarz et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2018) . However, as with most Chinese herbal medicines, the application of rhubarb is limited due to its poor bioavailability and hydrophobicity. Therefore, it is necessary to find new ways for the usage of rhubarb in order to make better use of it. The field of nanotechnology is an advanced approach in modern materials science. Nanoparticles might resolve the biopharmaceutical problems related to improving the uptake of poorly soluble drugs, reducing toxicity and increasing the drug bioavailability (Onoue et al., 2014; Marella and Tollamadugu, 2018) . Moreover, it is well documented that the unique properties of nanoparticles, such as small particle size, large surface area to volume ratios, and tunable surface charge, make nanoparticles attractive tools for viral treatment (Singh et al., 2017) . In recent years, several nanoparticles have been reported for the treatment of viral infections, among them silver nanoparticles have proven to be active against several types of viruses (Galdiero et al., 2011; Singh et al., 2017) .",

HEp-2 cells were treated with serial dilutions of R. tanguticum nanoparticles at 37\u00b0C for 72 h. As shown in Figure 3A , the 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC 50 ) of R. tanguticum nanoparticles on HEp-2 cells was 415.3 \u00b5g/ ml. Thus, a safe and low-toxicity concentration 350 \u00b5g/ml was selected to determine the anti-HSV-1 efficacy of R. tanguticum nanoparticles using a plaque reduction assay (PRA). The anti-HSV-1 efficacy of R. tanguticum nanoparticles was further conducted using a plaque reduction assay (PRA). The results showed that R. tanguticum nanoparticles could suppress HSV-1 viral plaque formation in a dose-dependent manner ( Figure 3B ) and with the increase of drug concentrations, a noted increased antiviral activity was observed. The EC 50 of R. tanguticum nanoparticles determined by PRA was 194.1 \u00b5g/ ml. To investigate the activity of R. tanguticum nanoparticles on viral replication cycle, time-of-addition assay was performed ( Figure 3C) . R. tanguticum nanoparticles (350 \u00b5g/ ml) were added to HEp-2 cell monolayers at indicated times post-infection (h.p.i.) and the cells were harvested at 72 h.p.i. The inhibitory effect was significant when R. tanguticum nanoparticles were added at 0-15 h.p.i. Moreover, the results of the inactivation, attachment and penetration assays suggested that R. tanguticum nanoparticles also show effect on directly inactivate HSV-1 particles, prevent viral adsorption and block HSV-1 entry into cells. As shown in Figure 4 , compared with those in the virus control, the 200-350 \u00b5g/ml concentrations of R. tanguticum nanoparticles inhibited both the inactivation, attachment and penetration processes of HSV-1 and the viral activities were dramatically reduced. These findings suggested that the antiviral activity of R. tanguticum nanoparticles was due to the interference with the whole phase of viral replication.",

As shown in Figure 5B , the HSV-1 infected HEp-2 cells were incubated with or without R. tanguticum nanoparticles (350 \u00b5g/ml) at different time point (6, 12, 18, and 24 h) and the results showed that the mRNA levels of the IE gene ICP4, E gene ICP8 and L gene gD were significantly reduced in a time-dependent manner when treated with R. tanguticum nanoparticles. ICP4 is a transcription activator that is an essential factor for early and late promoter, while ICP8, the viral major DNA-binding protein and an E protein, is necessary for viral DNA replication. Therefore, the effect of R. tanguticum nanoparticles on their production was further determined by Western blot analysis and IFA. As shown in Figure 5A , the western blot results showed that ICP4 and ICP8 fails to express in virus-infected R. tanguticum nanoparticles treated cells which were significantly lower than in the virus-infected group. Besides, the results of IFA indicated that although the expression levels of ICP4 treated with R. tanguticum nanoparticles at 350 \u00b5g/ml were similar to the virus control at 6 and 12 h.p.i., ICP4 production was strongly suppressed by R. tanguticum nanoparticles at 18 and 24 h.p.i. (Figure  6A ). At the same time, the production of ICP8 in the virus control group was significantly more abundant than that in the R. tanguticum nanoparticles-treated cells at 18 and 24 h ( Figure 6B) . These results are consistent with those found and indicated that R. tanguticum nanoparticles could strongly affect HSV-1 replication through interfering with viral IE, E, and L gene expressions.",

Clinical signs of changes in behavior of murine HSV-1 infection, such as lack of appetite hyperactivity and weight loss, a hunched posture, and inactivity were observed. The survival time, lethality and viral titers in the brains were recorded to determine the antiviral efficiency of R. tanguticum nanoparticles. As shown in Figure 7A , the survival rates of the R. tanguticum nanoparticles-treated groups at dosages of 312.5 mg/kg/day and 625 mg/kg/day were 30.0% and 60.0%, which are higher than the viral control group (20.0%) on the 14th day post-infection (d.p.i.). However, there was no significant difference of weight loss between all drug-treated groups and the virus control group (p > 0.05) (Supplementary Figure S1) . Compared with the virus control group, R. tanguticum nanoparticles treated mice died later and the progress time course of clinical signs was slowed. Additionally, the protective rate of acyclovir at 100 mg/kg/day was shown to be 70%. The changes of the virus titers at the 5th d.p.i. were also detected to confirm the protective efficacy of R. tanguticum nanoparticles against HSV-1infection in vivo. Oral gavage by R. tanguticum nanoparticles in 625 mg/kg/day significantly reduced the virus titers compared to the virus control group (p < 0.01) ( Figure 7B) . Moreover, the treatment with R. tanguticum nanoparticles (625 mg/kg/day) showed no significant difference with the acyclovir group. Taken together, the results suggest that R. tanguticum nanoparticles could protect mice from HSV-1infection and prolong the lifespan.",

Our previous study showed that the ethanol extracts of Rheum tanguticum, emodin inhibit the herpes simplex virus in vitro and in vivo, which the most effective dose orally administered to mice was 6.7 g/kg/day (Xiong et al., 2011) . Others have been reported that the rhubarb ethanol extract exhibited anti-viral effects on herpes simplex virus infection in vivo and they treated mice by injected hypodermically with the dose at 4.9 g/kg/day (Wang et al., 2003) . In our present study, the effective dose of R. tanguticum nanoparticles that satisfies the efficacy may be reduced comparing to the previous studies. Moreover, compared with traditional ethanol or water extracts, R. tanguticum nanoparticles is a whole ingredient medicine maximized preserving the biologically active compositions without heating or damaging them. This indicates that nanoparticles could improve the pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of therapeutic agents.",

            "text": "In this study, the cell-free virion lost its infectivity to some extent when incubated with R. tanguticum nanoparticles preinfection, indicating that R. tanguticum nanoparticles could interact with virion. However, whether the interaction could destroy the virion structure or just block the receptor binding site on the viral envelope is not clear. Further experiments need to be carried out to confirm which way the R. tanguticum nanoparticles work by using transmission electron microscopy (Cagno et al., 2018) . Heparin sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) on the cell surface is involved in the infection of many viruses, including herpes viruses, for it can serve as primary receptors or co-receptors for pathogens (Liu and Thorp, 2002) . HSV glycoproteins gB and gC bind to cell-surface HSPGs and mediate the initial attachment to target host cells (Laquerre et al., 1998) . Lara et al (Lara et al., 2010) reported that silver nanoparticles were capable of interfering with gp120-CD4 interaction and result in the blockage of viral entry into cells. This result inspires us that R. tanguticum nanoparticles might interfere with the gB/gC-HSPGs interaction. A competitive gB/gC-capture ELISA using HSPGs-coated plate should be performed to verify this hypothesis. Dey et al (Dey et al., 2018) stated that they visualized the uptake of nanogels by the cells through clathrin-mediated endocytosis using confocal microscopy. It indicated that nanoparticles might get access into the cell and inhibit viral replication. Thus, the inhibitory effect of R. tanguticum nanoparticles on viral gene transcription and translation of viral proteins might be due to interactions of R. tanguticum nanoparticles with viral genome, certain factors or pathways essential for viral replication. However, the precise mechanism needs to be further investigated.",

In addition, study by Orlowski et al (Orlowski et al., 2014) demonstrated that the smaller-sized nanoparticles could induce production of cytokines and chemokines that important for anti-viral response. Nonetheless, one should keep in mind that various in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated the nanosilver-related toxic effects in rat hepatocytes and neuronal cells (El Mahdy et al., 2015) , human lung epithelial cells (Pinzaru et al., 2018 ) and rat's living tissues (Sardari et al., 2012) .

The particles were spherical and hexagonal shapes with an average size of 121.5 nm, and showed an excellent bactericidal effect against S. aureus and P. aeruginosa.
