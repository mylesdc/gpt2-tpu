Here we present a systematic assessment of published research on zoonotic diseases in the region and thesis research in Kenya to understand the regional research focus and trends in publications, and estimate proportion of theses research transitioning to peer-reviewed journal publications. Methods: We searched PubMed, Google Scholar and African Journals Online databases for publications on 36 zoonotic diseases identified to have occurred in the East Africa countries of Burundi, Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda and Uganda, for the period between 1920 and 2017. We searched libraries and queried online repositories for masters and PhD theses on these diseases produced between 1970 and 2016 in five universities and two research institutions in Kenya. Results: We identified 771 journal articles on 22, and 168 theses on 21 of the 36 zoonotic diseases investigated. Research on zoonotic diseases increased exponentially with the last 10 years of our study period contributing more than half of all publications 460 (60%) and theses 102 (61%) retrieved. Endemic diseases were the most studied accounting for 656 (85%) and 150 (89%) of the publication and theses studies respectively, with publications on epidemic diseases associated with outbreaks reported in the region or elsewhere. Epidemiological studies were the most common study types but limited to cross-sectional studies while socio-economics were the least studied. Only 11% of the theses research transitioned to peer-review publications, taking an average of 2.5 years from theses production to manuscript publication.",

For example, Kenya established a One Health office referred to as the Zoonotic disease unit and one of its mandates is to stimulate and conduct research and training at the human-animal-ecosystem interfaces [15] . Most of the countries involved in this review including Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda and Ethiopia have established similar One Health offices or have organizations and networks created to conduct One Health training, research and outreach [16] . Publication output of countries has been associated with the level of national research spending and English proficiency [17] . These factors could be at play in East Africa region as well, with notable increase in the number of Universities established in the last 20 years [18] . The relatively fewer publications coming from Rwanda and Burundi may be associated with the two countries being French speaking, or political instability during the study period covered in our review.",

It is not clear why such a situation exists but it may be related to researchers' only being keen to obtain an academic qualification or lack of proper academic support towards peer review publication. Recent change in policy on post-graduate education in Kenya making it mandatory for post-graduate students to show evidence of publication before being allowed to graduate may change the trend in dissemination of research findings, including those on zoonotic diseases.",
