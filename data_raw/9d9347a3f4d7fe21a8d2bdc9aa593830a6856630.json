Here, we report the complete coding sequence of Colobanthus quitensis associated barnavirus 1, mined from a transcriptome of the Antarctic pearlwort Colobanthus quitensis. The 4.2-kb plus-strand sequence of this virus encompasses four main open reading frames (ORFs), as expected for barnaviruses, including ORFs for a protease-containing polyprotein, an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase whose translation appears to rely on \u2212 1 ribosomal frameshifting, and a capsid protein that is likely to be translated from a subgenomic RNA. The possible derivation of this virus from a fungus associated with C. quitensis is discussed.",

ORF3 partially overlaps ORF2 in the \u22121 frame and appears to be expressed as a P2+3 fusion polyprotein dependent on programmed ribosomal frameshifting [19] . ORF4 does not overlap ORF3 and is expressed instead from a subgenomic RNA containing only ORF4 [17, 19] . The ~ 3.9-kb genome of RsBV1 exhibits a coding organization closely related to that of MBV [12] (Fig. 1 ; the presence of ORF1 in RsBV1 is newly noted here). Based on similar genome sizes, coding organizations, and P2-and P3-region sequence similarities, both MBV and RsBV1 appear to be most closely related to plant viruses in the unassigned genus Sobemovirus [12, 16] .",

            "text": "Based on the length (3296 nt) and coding organization of GCIB01019590.1, relative to those of MBV, we concluded that this apparent new barnavirus sequence is complete or nearly complete at its positive-sense 3\u00b4 end, but truncated within ORF2 at its 5\u00b4 end. Importantly, the sequence reads from this transcriptome study are available as experiment SRX814890 [8] in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA). We therefore used the terminal sequences of GCIB01019590.1 as queries for MegaBLAST searches of SRX814890 in an effort to obtain a more complete sequence for the apparent new barnavirus. In this manner, and in subsequent searches that progressively extended the sequence termini, we identified two reads that added 31 nt to the positive-sense 3\u2032 sequence of GCIB01019590.1 and, more significantly, 180 reads that combined to add 879 nt to the 5\u2032 . The reading frame that includes ORF2 is defined as frame 0 in each genome. ORF3 is defined by bracketing stop codons; the other ORFs are defined as spanning from the first in-frame AUG codon to the first downstream stop codon. In MBV, three small ORFs with potential to encode proteins of 51-65 aa each [19] are shown as rectangles with dashed outlines; a few similarly sized small ORFs, with potential to encode proteins 52-100 aa each, are also found in CqABV1 and RsBV1 but are not located in the same genomic positions and are considered unlikely to be expressed. TM regions in encoded proteins, as predicted by SOSUI, are shown as diamonds. Regions of similarity in encoded proteins to viral proteases (pro), RdRps, or CPs, as determined by HHpred, are shown as thick lines within the respective ORFs. Known cleavage products of the ORF2-encoded polyprotein of representative sobemovirus SBMV are labeled. The ORF spanning nt 421-684 in SBMV encodes the essential sobemovirus protein Px [11] , which may be analogous to barnavirus P1 based on the coding organizations of these viruses. The other 5\u2032-proximal ORF in SBMV, spanning nt 93-533, has been reported to encode a movement protein (P1 [3] ), which is not expected to be present in the fungal barnaviruses sequence. As a result, the consensus sequence for the apparent new barnavirus reported here (GenBank MG686618) is 4206 nt long, appears to be coding complete for ORFs 1-4 ( Fig. 1) , and was newly assembled from a total of 821 individual reads (reads per position: mean, 19; range, 2-35). We henceforth refer to this virus as \"Colobanthus quitensis associated barnavirus 1\" (CqABV1).",

Using SOSUI for online transmembrane (TM) prediction (http://harri er.nagah ama-i-bio.ac.jp/sosui /sosui _submi t.html [9] ), we found that SBMV P2 indeed has two TM regions predicted near its N-terminus. Applying this analysis to CqABV1 P2 and MBV P2, we obtained similar results: five and three TM regions, respectively, were predicted N-terminal to the protease homology region in each (Fig. 1) . Similar results were also obtained for RsBV1, but in its case, a downstream cluster of two TM regions was predicted in P2, whereas an upstream cluster of two TM regions was predicted instead in P1. No TM regions were predicted in CqABV1 P1 or MBV P1. Based on these findings, we predicted that the reported RsBV1 sequence contains an assembly error within its region of ORF1/ ORF2 overlap, which has caused the 5\u2032-terminal portions of these ORFs to be artificially swapped. Indeed, by accessing available SRA data for RsBV1 (experiment SRX1747281) and then reassembling the RsBV1 contig, we discovered that a single nt residue had been clearly omitted between nt positions 359 and 360 of the RsBV1 sequence reported in GenBank KP900904.2 (Fig. S1 ), causing the 5\u00b4-terminal portions of ORF1 and ORF2 to be swapped as we had predicted. By incorporating this missing residue back into the RsBV1 sequence, not only was ORF1 now shifted into the \u22121 frame relative to ORF2, as found in CqABV1 and MBV, but also five TM regions were now predicted via SOSUI in the N-terminal region of RsBV1 P2, vs. none in P1 (Fig. 1) . To our knowledge, membrane association by N-terminal portions of the barnavirus P2 polyprotein has not been suggested previously. These membrane-associating portions of P2 seem likely to be involved in forming the RNA replication compartments of barnaviruses, as known for many other positive-sense RNA viruses [7] .",

However, the canonical motif for a \u22121 frameshift site is X_XXY_YYZ [4] , where Z is any nucleotide except G, YYY is AAA or UUU, and XXX is normally any three identical nucleotides, though a number of exceptions-including GGU-also occur [2] . Thus, the proposed slippery sequence in MBV would have been better identified as G_GUU_UUU, i.e., nudged upstream by one nt residue. Notably, this G_GUU_UUU sequence in MBV is also found at a similar position in RsBV1, and the related sequence G_AUU_UUU is found not only at a similar position in CqABV1 but also in some arteriviruses as a variant of the (normally G_GUU_UUU) nsp2N/nsp2TF \u22121/\u22122 frameshift site [2] . Given this degree of conservation (Fig. 2) , we have adopted this putative slippery sequence for deducing the P2+3 fusion polyprotein sequence of CqABV1.

Individual reads from a second transcriptome study of Antarctic pearlwort, BioProject PRJNA388703, are also available in the SRA, under experiments SRX2913822 and SRX2913823 (TSA data from this study were not yet available at the time of this report). When we used the CqABV1 genome sequence as query for MegaBLAST searches of SRX2913822 and SRX2913823, no significant hits were found (all E-values > 10). Thus, in this second study, CqABV1 appears to have been absent from all samples. One explanation for this variability in the presence of CqABV1 is that some of the sampled plants were infected with CqABV1, whereas others were not. Alternatively, the CqABV1-positive samples might have included a symbiont or contaminant infected with CqABV1, whereas the CqABV1-negative samples did not. The possibility that CqABV1 was not derived directly from Antarctic pearlwort but instead from an associated fungus, is especially intriguing, since both of the other barnaviruses reported to date, MBV and RsBV1, have fungal origins.",

            "text": "As a test of whether the BioProject PRJNA268301 transcriptome might include a noteworthy fraction of fungal sequences, we performed a locally run DIAMOND search [5] to try to identify the top hit (parameter -top 0) for each of the 165,386 contigs in this transcriptome. The results of this search were that 111,182 of the contigs registered a top hit with E-value \u2264 1e\u221205, for 79,553 (72%) of which the top hit was from a plant (kingdom Viridiplantae), consistent with this being a plant transcriptome. For 25,766 (23%), however, the top hit was instead from a fungus (kingdom Fungi), with 19,569 (18%) and 6018 (5.4%) from dikaryan phyla Ascomycota and Basidiomycota, respectively. In turn, the ascomycete hits were mostly from the classes Leotiomycetes (13,693; 12%), Dothideomycetes (2723; 2.5%), Eurotiomycetes (1011; 0.9%), and Sordariomycetes (908; 0.8%), and the basidiomycete hits were mostly from the classes Agaricomycetes (4989; 4.5%) and Tremellomycetes (867; 0.8%). A locally run BLASTN search yielded similar results, with 117,919 of the contigs These results provide evidence that the PRJNA268301 transcriptome indeed contains a noteworthy fraction of various fungal sequences, apparently representing a mixture of different dikaryan species. We thus speculate that CqABV1 was derived from one of these associated fungi, and not directly from Antarctic pearlwort. This explains our inclusion of the word \"associated\" in the name for this new barnavirus. Even more broadly, these findings indicate that the PRJNA268301 transcriptome, like many others reported to NCBI and elsewhere, is probably better identified as a metatranscriptome because it was derived from samples comprising more than its single, primary target organism. Unrooted radial phylogram. Deduced protein sequences for the P3 (RdRp) region of P2+3 of barnaviruses (black) and sobemoviruses (gray) were aligned using MAFFT 7.3 (G-INS-i) and then subjected to maximum-likelihood phylogenetic analyses using Mod-elFinder, IQ-TREE, and UFBoot [10, 13, 14] as implemented with the \"Find best and apply\" option at https ://www.hiv.lanl.gov/conte nt/ seque nce/IQTRE E/iqtre e.html. The following were found to apply: best-fit model according to BIC, LG+F+I+G4; model of rate het-erogeneity, Invar+Gamma with 4 categories; proportion of invariable sites, 0.0743; and gamma shape alpha, 0.8970. Branch support values (from 1000 bootstrap replicates) are shown in %; branches with < 50% support have been collapsed to the preceding node. The scale bar indicates the average number of substitutions per alignment position. See Table S4 for a summary of abbreviations and GenBank numbers",
