Since July 2007, an automated commercial GuSCN-based method was used, according the instructions of the manufacturer (Easy MAG 2.0, bioM\u00e9rieux, Marcy l'\u00c9 toile, France).

An internal RNA-virus control (equine arteritis virus (EAV)) was added to each sample prior to extraction at a standard concentration yielding a Ct value of 30 to 35 cycles in real-time RT-PCR. RNA was reversely transcribed using Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA) and random hexamers (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). Each 20 ml reaction mixture contained 5 ml extracted RNA, 4 ml l of 5X RT-buffer, 0.5 mM of each dNTP (Roche), 2 ng random hexamer, 10 mM DTT (Invitrogen), 1 UI of RNAse inhibitor and 2 UI RT Superscript III.

These differences likely reflect differences in study design and testing protocols: Yoshida et al. included a large number of ambulatory outpatients whereas our study focused exclusively on hospitalized cases; their diagnostic testing was based on nasal swab alone; their PCR for rhinovirus was able to detect rhinovirus types A, B and C whereas ours detected only rhinovirus A and B; and their panel of viruses did not include either enteroviruses or hCoV NL63.",

            "text": "We found significant associations between disease severity and a history of exposure to household cooking smoke. Indoor pollution due to biomass fuels (wood, crop residues and animal dung) or coal burning is a known risk factor for ARI mortality and morbidity in developing countries [29, 30] . Disease severity was also associated with longer delays between onset of illness and presentation to hospital. Delays in presentation are typical of health seeking behavior in lower income households of developing countries [31] . Our patient survey questionnaire did not include explicit questions regarding household income, however our findings clearly indicate the need for further research on the socio-economic risk factors associated with ARI. Numerous previous studies have investigated optimal sampling methods for diagnosis of respiratory viruses by culture, immunofluorescence, or molecular techniques [32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37] . Regardless of the diagnostic approach, NPA specimens typically exhibit increased sensitivity (15-31%) relative to nasal swabs or throat swabs. However, the differential increase appears less marked for molecular based methods [32] . Indeed, results of the present study indicate that, although NPAs yielded the highest overall yield of virus detection (78%, 173/222), the differential improvement over nasal or throat swabs was marginal and not statistically significant across all viruses ( Table 6 ). Nevertheless, NPAs were significantly superior to nasal or throat swabs for detection of influenza viruses (p#0.05), whereas throat swabs were superior for enteroviruses (p#0.05). Combining the results of nasal and throat swabs rendered comparable sensitivities to NPAs for detection of all respiratory viruses of our panel and increased sensitivity for enteroviruses. As nasal and throat swabs are easier to obtain and less distressing for patients, these samples are preferred in our setting.",

            "text": "There were several limitations to our study. Firstly, we focused only on viral aetiologies since these are common causes of ARI and understudied in this region. However, this prevented the possibility of addressing key questions about bacterial pathogens and the possible role of viral and bacterial co-infections. As nearly all children in our study received antibiotic treatment, and issues involving judicious use of antibiotics and resistance development is becoming increasingly important in Vietnam, inclusion of bacterial pathogens in future studies will be essential. Second, our testing algorithm did not include measles virus. We suspect there may have been undiagnosed measles cases within our cohort, since 6/18 cases who presented with rash on admission were negative for all viruses tested; furthermore, national surveillance data indicates that Vietnam experienced a rise in measles cases in 2005-2006 [38] . Lastly, our sample size was limited and insufficient to allow more refined observations regarding differences in age distributions, clinical characteristics, or determinants of severity between specific viral species. The principle reasons for limited enrollment were a) resource constraints and feasibility (overburdening of doctors and nurses in wards where admission of 2 to 3 patients per bed is common practice), and b) limited familiarity with clinical research among patients and parents in this setting and thus additional challenges to obtaining consent. In total, during the 3-year study period, only 4.1% of all admitted ARI patients at the respiratory ward (40 beds) were enrolled in the study, and 14.2% of ARI patients admitted to the PICU (15 beds). While the sample size of enrolled patients relative to the total number of admitted patients was small, the proportion remained stable throughout the study period and the number of enrolled patients followed a similar pattern as the number of admitted patients over time (Figure 2 ). For these reason, we believe that our study population nevertheless provided a reasonable representation of the overall ARI patient population in Ho Chi Minh City at the time.",

Our findings indicate that combined nasal-throat swabs are the specimens of choice for sensitive molecular detection of a broad panel of viral agents. Pneumonia remains a leading cause of death among children less than 5 years old in developing countries, and continues to be a salient public health problem in Vietnam. Enhancing existing surveillance systems to better understand disease burden of respiratory pathogens is one step forward to development of therapeutic and prevention strategies.",
