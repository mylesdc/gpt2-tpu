The present study aims to use breath VOC analysis to develop a model that can discriminate between patients who have positive cultures and who have negative cultures with a high sensitivity.",

The diagnosis of VAP remains challenging as clinical, laboratory and radiological parameters are sensitive but non-specific for VAP and suffer from high inter-rater variability [6, 7] . A lower respiratory tract sample [bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), endotracheal aspirate or protected specimen brush sample] is recommended for microbiological confirmation of clinically suspected VAP [8] , but these results take days to become available and the procedures cannot be repeated frequently due to their invasiveness. As a result of this delay, patients are overtreated with antibiotics, as empiric antibiotic treatment is initiated immediately after obtaining a lower respiratory tract sample. Subsequent microbiological results help to tailor and deescalate antibiotic treatment [9] , so the lower respiratory tract sample continues to be of crucial importance for diagnosing VAP.",

Two pairs will be collected per patient and will be sent to two different laboratory locations for analysis (one pair to Philips Research, Eindhoven, the Netherlands and the other to Manchester Institute of Biotechnology, University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom).

The samples to be analysed at the Manchester Institute of Biotechnology are collected using sorbent tubes packed with 200 mg Tenax GR (Markes International, Llantrisant, UK).

Subsequently the data will be visually inspected to exclude contaminated samples. Contamination of the sampling tubes (e.g. due to loose fittings during transport) can severely distort the stored breath content. These tubes will be excluded from further analysis.",

For large shifts this method becomes inaccurate resulting in the loss of peaks in the final table and erroneous alignment of the samples. In our experiment the samples will be measured over a time span of at least 18 months. Therefore rather large retention time shifts can be expected. To account for the retention time shifts the following approach will be applied, which consists of two steps [27] . First the major part of the time shifts will be corrected by using anchor points (marker molecules), i.e. molecules with clearly identifiable mass spectra distributed over the full retention time window. Examples are isoprene, toluene and compounds from the internal standards. These molecules will be identified by comparing the measured mass spectra to the spectra published in the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) chemistry web book database [36] using the dot-product function as similarity measure. According to Stein and Scott [37] , this algorithm gives the best similarity estimate between mass spectra. The first raw retention time correction will be performed using a linear or quadratic fit to the retention times of the marker molecules. The second step in the approach will consist of fine alignment using the regular retention time correction of the XCMS package, as described by Smith et al. [31] .",

As recruitment depends on the clinical suspicion of VAP, this could slow the inclusion rate. The clinical definition for inclusion into the study could also be seen as a weakness of the study as clinical practice may vary from hospital to hospital. However, we have tried to include hospitals from a wide variety of settings and countries throughout Europe to cover the heterogeneity in clinical practice. This geographical variation may also introduce noise into the data collected by breath analysis as the environment contributes to exhaled VOCs [41, 42] . Another challenge concerns the secondary aim of this study to identify patterns of VOCs that are predictive of the presence of specific causative pathogens. A number of VOCs are already associated with certain pathogens. There is a large number of pathogens that can cause VAP [43] and the groups of patients are not likely to be infected with the same pathogen. This is a risk that is inherent to a prospective clinical study. We expect to find sufficiently large groups of patients for at least the most important pathogens in VAP: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterobacteriaceae [43] .",

Several members of the consortium previously performed studies over similarly long periods of time and have developed statistical tools to correct for this shift in retention time [27] . The sensitivity of the mass spectrometer may also drift. This was a problem in previous studies and therefore an internal standard was included in the present protocol. As in any study that focuses on breath analysis there is always the challenge of statistical overfitting [44] . We expect to find several hundreds of VOCs in the breath of patients. These will be used as predictors for the presence of VAP. Such a high dimensional predictor matrix easily results in false discovery and therefore sufficient internal validation measures must be taken [45] . There, we suggest two approaches in this protocol. First, we aim to validate previously found markers. This limits the number of statistical comparisons and increases the changes on valid discoveries. Second, novel biomarkers are discovered using crossvalidation and permutation tests.",

Six ICUs of university hospitals in the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Spain and Portugal are involved: the Academic Medical Centre (AMC) in Amsterdam; University Hospital South Manchester (UHSM), Salford Royal and Central Manchester University Hospitals in Manchester; Parc Tauli Hospital in Sabadell; and Sao Francisco Hospital/ Nova Medical School in Lisbon. Patients are expected to be recruited from all six sites over an 18 to 24-month time period. The project is funded by the European Union (BreathDx -611951). Patients at one of the six involved ICUs that are clinically suspected of having VAP are eligible for the study. VAP is defined by (1) systemic changes [temperature >38 or <36.5\u00b0C; white blood cell count <4,000 or >12,000/mm 3 ]; and (2) chest abnormalities [new infiltrates on chest X-ray, purulent tracheal secretions]; and (3) positive microbiology results [25]. Inclusion criteria are (1) 18 years and older and (2) intubation and mechanical ventilation for > 48 h and (3) clinical suspicion of VAP (aforementioned systemic changes combined with chest abnormalities). Exclusion criteria include patients who: (1) are deemed clinically inappropriate to collect samples from (e.g. if they are receiving end-of-life care); or (2) are in strict isolation (e.g. Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, Ebola or resistant tuberculosis).",

As this study concerns patients lacking capacity, at time of inclusion formal assent will be sought with a designated consultee who is independent of the BRAVo study: this is likely to be the consultant directly responsible for the care of this particular patient. The independency of this physician enables the decision for recruitment to be solely in the patient's best interest. Where the patient regains capacity, deferred consent will be obtained. In case the patient does not regain capacity, samples will not be discarded and can be used for research purposes.\u2022 We accept pre-submission inquiries \u2022 Our selector tool helps you to find the most relevant journal Submit your next manuscript to BioMed Central and we will help you at every step:",
