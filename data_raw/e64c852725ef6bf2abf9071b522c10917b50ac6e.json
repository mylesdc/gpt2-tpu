However, the impact of platelets on HIV-1 infection of T cells is unclear. Results: We found that platelets suppress HIV-1 spread in co-cultured T cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Platelets containing granules inhibited HIV-1 spread in T cells more efficiently than degranulated platelets, indicating that the granule content might exert antiviral activity. Indeed, supernatants from activated and thus degranulated platelets suppressed HIV-1 infection. Infection was inhibited at the stage of host cell entry and inhibition was independent of the viral strain or coreceptor tropism. In contrast, blockade of HIV-2 and SIV entry was less efficient. The chemokine CXCL4, a major component of platelet granules, blocked HIV-1 entry and neutralization of CXCL4 in platelet supernatants largely abrogated their anti-HIV-1 activity.",

The HIV envelope protein (Env) mediates viral entry into target cells, mainly T cells and macrophages. For this, Env interacts with host cell factors, CD4 and a chemokine coreceptor, CXCR4 or CCR5 [2] . However, HIV can attach to cells independent of CD4 and coreceptor and attachment can modulate viral infectivity and susceptibility to neutralizing antibodies [3] . For instance, binding of HIV to the lectin DC-SIGN on immature monocyte-derived dendritic cells can increase viral infectivity for adjacent target cells [4] and might clear Env from bound neutralizing antibodies [5] . Similarly, erythrocytes, which are CD4 negative, have been reported to selectively bind infectious HIV [6] . Thus, interactions of HIV with receptor-negative, non-susceptible cells can alter viral infectivity and recognition by the immune system and might thus modulate viral spread in and between patients.",

For instance, platelets can selectively kill erythrocytes harbouring the malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum and can protect against spread of the parasite [8] . Several disjointed observations suggest that platelets might also play a role in HIV spread. Thus, thrombocytopenia (low platelet counts) is a frequent complication in HIV-1 infection, afflicting 10-50% of the infected individuals [9] . In addition, platelets counts were found to be associated with viral load and disease progression [10] , indicating that platelets might modulate viral spread in patients. Finally, platelets were shown to bind to HIV in cell culture and in infected patients [11] [12] [13] and viral capture activity was traced to the calcium-dependent (C-type) lectin DC-SIGN, which was detected on the surface of platelets [14, 15] . However, it is at present unclear how HIV capture by platelets impacts viral infectivity.",

The goal of our present study was to determine if platelets modulate HIV-1 spread in co-cultured T cells. In addition, we sought to reveal if the potential impact of platelets on HIV-1 infection depends on the platelet activation status. In order to obtain differentially activated platelets, we either prevented platelet activation by treatment with prostaglandin E1 (PGE 1 ), activated platelets by exposure to thrombin receptor agonist peptide (TRAP) or left platelets untreated. Analysis of the expression of CD62P, a platelet activation marker, confirmed that treatment with PGE 1 and TRAP was effective. Thus, platelets exposed to TRAP expressed high levels of CD62P (activated platelets, A-PLT) while expression on platelets treated with PGE 1 was close to background (resting platelets, R-PLT) ( Figure 1A) . Untreated platelets had an intermediate phenotype (untreated platelets, PLT) ( Figure 1A ). In addition, we investigated if untreated platelets expressed C-type lectins known to bind to the HIV Env protein. Our results demonstrated expression of low levels of DC-SIGN, in agreement with previous studies [14, 15] , and of mannose receptor (MR) ( Figure 1B ), a Ctype lectin previously shown to promote HIV-1 capture and trans-infection by macrophages [23, 24] . In contrast, LSECtin, a C-type lectin which captures recombinant HIV-1 Env but not infectious HIV-1 [25, 26] , was not detected on platelets ( Figure 1B) although we cannot rule out that low levels of lectin expression remained undetected due to limited assay sensitivity. Analysis of C-type lectin expression on activated platelets yielded similar results (data not shown), indicating that activation does not modulate C-type lectin expression.",

While this protocol is suitable to detect HIV-1 capture, it might poorly reflect inter-individual HIV-1 transmission, where generally low amounts of virus are transmitted and cell free virions are present. In order to better mirror the introduction of HIV-1 into the blood stream upon sexual or parenteral transmission, we applied a relatively low amount of virus (pg range of p24 antigen) to co-cultures of platelets and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), omitted a wash step (therefore, the designation closed culture system) and quantified viral spread at six days post infection. Under these conditions, we observed a marked inhibition of HIV-1 spread in the presence of untreated platelets (Figure 2A ). To further examine this inhibitory effect, we employed C8166-SEAP T cells which allow convenient quantification of HIV-1 infection [27] . Addition of untreated platelets inhibited HIV-1 spread in C8166 T cells in a concentration-dependent manner, with viral spread being up to 80% reduced in co-cultures harbouring 1 \u00d7 10 8 PLT per mL (a concentration close to that found in human blood) ( Figure 2B ). HIV-1 inhibition was not due to reduced T cell survival, as determined by annexin V staining (data not shown). Of note, untreated platelets, which largely maintained their granule contents (black bars) were more adept in suppressing HIV-1 than activated and thus degranulated platelets (white bar), which were washed before addition to T cells ( Figure 2B ). Thus, in a closed culture system platelets can inhibit HIV-1 spread in a concentration-and activation status-dependent manner.",

For this, we determined if the supernatants inhibit infection by an envelopedefective lentiviral vector pseudotyped with the Env proteins from HIV-1 NL4-3 or the amphotropic murine leukemia virus (MLV) as well as the G-protein of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-G). In addition, we examined inhibition of authentic HIV-2 Rod and SIVmac239. None of the viruses tested were inhibited by TRAP ( Figure 3A ). The supernatants from activated platelets blocked infection by pseudotypes bearing HIV-1 NL4-3 Env but not VSV-G, although in some experiments a minor decrease of VSV-G -mediated entry was observed, indicating that inhibition of HIV-1 infection occurs at the stage of virus entry. In contrast, infection by HIV-2 Rod and SIVmac239 was not efficiently inhibited and similar results were obtained for SIVmac251 and a macrophage tropic SIVmac239 variant, SIVmac239/316 Env ( Figure 3A and Additional file 2: Figure S2 ). Thus, among primate lentiviruses, the inhibitory activity seems to be largely specific for HIV-1 Env. Finally, entry driven by the MLV Env protein was also inhibited ( Figure 3A and Additional file 2: Figure S2 ), suggesting that HIV-1 and MLV Env might share a binding surface for a platelet-derived inhibitory factor. Alternatively, these proteins might be targeted by at least two separate antiviral activities released from platelets. We next tested the possibility that the antiviral activity released by platelets might only target HIV-1 with a certain coreceptor tropism or might be specific for certain HIV-1 strains. However, the analysis of a panel of HIV-1 NL4-3 V3 loop mutants, which either use CCR5 or CXCR4 as coreceptor for infectious entry ( Figure 3B ), and of several HIV-1 molecular clones ( Figure 3C ) demonstrated that HIV-1 inhibition by platelet supernatants was neither coreceptor nor strain specific.",

Indeed, incubation of platelet supernatants at 95\u00b0C largely abrogated their antiviral activity while supernatants maintained at room temperature were active ( Figure 4A ). These results are compatible with a proteinaceous factor being responsible for HIV-1 inhibition. While we further characterized this factor, Auerbach and colleagues reported that the chemokine CXCL4, which is abundant in \u03b1 granules of platelets, inhibits HIV-1 but not HIV-2 and SIV entry [17] . However, these results were exclusively obtained with purified CXCL4 and platelets were not analysed. We therefore investigated if CXLC4 might be responsible for the efficient inhibition of HIV-1 and MLV Env pseudotypes by supernatants from activated platelets. Recombinant CXCL4 markedly inhibited infection driven by HIV-1 or MLV Env but had only a minor (although statistically significant) effect on VSV-G-dependent entry ( Figure 4B ). Thus, CXCL4 exhibits an inhibitory profile similar to that of platelet supernatants ( Figure 3A) . A neutralizing antibody against CXCL4 abrogated HIV-1 inhibition by recombinant CXCL4 (Additional file 3: Figure S3 ) and was used to investigate the contribution of this chemokine to the antiviral activity of platelet supernatants. Incubation of platelet supernatants with the CXCL4-specific antibody largely abrogated inhibition of HIV-1 and MLV Env-bearing pseudotypes ( Figure 4C ), indicating that CXCL4 in platelet supernatants mainly accounts for their antiviral activity.",

It is becoming appreciated, however, that platelets have functions beyond ensuring the integrity of the vasculature, which include a role in defence against invading pathogens [7, 28] . We found that activation of platelets induces release of one or more antiviral factors, which suppress HIV-1 infection at the stage of viral entry. Inhibition of several HIV-1 strains was observed and the antiviral activity was independent of coreceptor tropism or target cell type. Recombinant CXCL4 inhibited HIV-1 infection and the HIV-1 inhibition by platelet supernatants was largely rescued by a neutralizing CXCL4-specific antibody, indicating a major contribution of CXCL4 to HIV-1 inhibition by platelets. These results suggest that platelets could constitute a so far unappreciated innate defence against HIV-1 infection. It is well documented that platelets associate with HIV-1 in cell culture and in infected patients [11] [12] [13] 29, 30] . Our previous results [15] and a study by Boukour and colleagues [14] demonstrated that platelets bind HIV-1 mainly via the C-type lectin DC-SIGN and that bound virions are infectious for adjacent target cells [15] . The C-type lectinlike protein CLEC-2 also contributed to HIV-1 capture by platelets but capture efficiency was reduced compared to DC-SIGN [15, 31] . Our present study adds MR to the list of C-type lectin (\u2212like) proteins which could contribute to HIV-1 capture by platelets and potentially megakaryocytes. Although a contribution of MR to HIV-1 interactions with platelets remains to be demonstrated, these findings highlight that platelets express several lectins involved in pathogen recognition and might thus modulate pathogen spread and pathogen specific immune responses.",

At first sight, this finding is counterintuitive, considering our previous finding that platelets capture and transfer infectious HIV-1 to T cells via lectins [15] . However, different experimental conditions were chosen to generate these results, and the platelet/ T cell co-cultures infected with low amounts of HIV-1 in the absence of a wash step (Figure 2A , B of present manuscript) reflect the physiological situation better than the conditions previously chosen to analyse viral capture (high amount of input virus, removal of unbound virus from platelets [15] ). The inhibition of HIV-1 observed in these co-culture experiments was maximal when platelet -T cell ratios were used that were similar to those found in human blood, suggesting that platelet-dependent blockade of HIV-1 might occur in patients.",

            "text": "Platelet granules contain hundreds of bioactive molecules which are released into the extracellular space upon platelet activation [16] . Two findings indicate that platelet granules contain an anti-HIV-1 activity, which is released upon activation, and which is largely responsible for the inhibition of HIV-1 spread in platelet/T cells co-cultures: Activated and subsequently washed (and thus granule-deprived) platelets inhibited HIV-1 spread less efficiently than untreated platelets and supernatants of activated but not resting platelets efficiently suppressed HIV-1 infection. Such a scenario raises two immediate questions. How are platelets activated in HIV-1 infected co-cultures with T cells and what is the nature of the antiviral factor? Concerning the trigger for activation, direct contact between HIV-1 and platelets could be sufficient for activation, as previously demonstrated for certain adenoviruses [20] . However, exposure of platelets to virus-like particles bearing HIV-1 Env did not induce appreciable platelet activation (Additional file 4: Figure S4 ; Additional file 5: Additional methods), arguing against this hypothesis. Alternatively, activation of platelets might be relatively unspecific and could be induced by contact of platelets with T cells or tissue culture plastic during culturea scenario that we currently favour ( Figure 1A and Additional file 6: Figure S5 ). Our initial attempts to identify the antiviral factor(s) released by platelets focussed on ligands for the HIV-1 coreceptors CCR5 and CXCR4, the CC-chemokines CCL3 (MIP-1\u03b1), CCL4 (MIP-1\u03b2), CCL5 (RANTES) and the CXC-chemokine CXCL12 (SDF1), respectively. These chemokines can block HIV-1 entry and release of CXCL12 was detected upon platelet activation (data not shown), in agreement with a previous study [32] . However, the concentration of CXCL12 was below that previously shown to block cellular entry of X4-tropic HIV-1. In addition, neutralizing antibodies directed against CXCL12 did not rescue HIV-1 inhibition and no evidence for downregulation of CXCR4 by platelet supernatants was obtained (data not shown), indicating that platelet-derived CXCL12 was not involved in blockade of X4-tropic HIV-1. A report published during the preparation of this manuscript showed that the chemokine CXCL4 binds to HIV-1 Env and inhibits HIV-1 entry [17] . In contrast, cellular entry of HIV-2 and SIV was not blocked by CXCL4 [17] . CXCL4 is present at high levels in \u03b1-granules of platelets [21, 22] and we therefore focussed our further analysis on this chemokine. Platelet supernatants and recombinant CXCL4 exerted antiviral activity against HIV-1 without interfering with CD4 and coreceptor expression (Additional file 7: Figure S6 ) and neutralization of CXCL4 largely prevented HIV-1 inhibition by platelet supernatants, demonstrating that inhibition of HIV-1 infection by activated platelets is mainly due to release of CXCL4. Recombinant CXCL4 and endogenous CXCL4 in platelet supernatants also inhibited MLV Env-driven host cell entry. Whether the blockade of MLV Env by CXCL4 also involves interactions between these proteins or is due to CXCL4 binding to host cell factors required for MLV Env-dependent entry remains to be determined. Release of CXCL4 by platelets could impact HIV-1 dissemination between individuals. Thus, transmission of HIV-1 via the sexual and particularly the parenteral route frequently involves (micro-) vascular injury, and the resulting platelet activation and release of CXCL4 might reduce transmission efficiency. Platelet-derived CXCL4 might also modulate viral spread during the chronic phase of the infection: Platelets isolated from the blood of HIV-1 patients were reported by several [18, 19] but not all [33] studies to express activation markers. Moreover, a recent analysis demonstrated that platelets from HIV-1 infected individuals have a reduced threshold to activation, and that plasma from HIV-1 patients activates platelets obtained from healthy donors [34] . Thus, the activation status of platelets is increased in the context of HIV-1 infection, potentially due to pro-inflammatory cytokines or invading bacteria [34] , which are present at elevated levels in HIV-1 patients [35] and are known to activate platelets [36, 37] . As a consequence, platelets might constantly release CXCL4, which would explain why viral load and platelet counts were found to be inversely correlated in infected humans [10] and why a direct correlation between CD62P levels and viral load was observed in a recent study [19] . However, it also needs to be noted that CXCL4 can increase HIV-1 replication in macrophages after successful viral entry into these cells [38] , suggesting that CXCL4 might impact viral spread via more than one mechanism.",

Samples were then washed in 20-fold excess of PBS and analyzed immediately by flow cytometry employing a Cytomics FC500 (Beckmann-Coulter) machine. Light scatter and fluorescence signals were acquired using logarithmic amplification and platelets were identified by their characteristic size. Gating was confirmed by platelet specific monoclonal fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies. Generally, 10,000 events were collected per gate and data were analyzed with FCS Express software (De Novo Software).",

The p24-antigen levels at day one post infection were below detection range. The results of a single representative experiment performed in duplicates are shown, error bars indicate SD. The results were confirmed in an independent experiment. (B) Platelets inhibit HIV-1 spread in adjacent T cells in a concentration-and activation status-dependent manner. The indicated amounts of non-resting platelets (PLT, platelets left untreated) or activated platelets (A-PLT, platelets treated with TRAP) were added to C8166-SEAP T cells, the cultures infected with 10 pg of HIV-1 NL4-3 and SEAP-activity measured at day five post infection. The average \u00b1 SEM of three experiments performed in triplicates is shown, SEAP-activity measured in the absence of platelets was set as 100%. (C) Activation of platelets induces the release of one or more HIV-1 inhibitory factors.
