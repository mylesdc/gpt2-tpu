In this study, we disclose a rare-earth free and yellowemission phosphor, Phellodendron, which could be both excited by near ultraviolet light and blue light. The new yellow phosphor is obtained by extraction of Phellodendron chinense Schneid. The emission wavelength, full width at half maximum and CIE coordinates of extracted Phellodendron are 540 nm, 120 nm and (0.41, 0.55), respectively. The corresponding luminescent properties of Phellodendron are characterized by PL, PLE, reflection spectra, FITR and decay lifetime. Surprising thing is luminous intensity of Phellodendron phosphors excited at 380 nm was stronger than YAG:Ce phosphor by more than 139%. In addition, we firstly introduce the yellow phosphor in white LED fabrication by combining blue chip and Y 3 Al 5 O 12 :Ce 3+ phosphor, to create warm white. For comparison, red-emission CaAlSiN 3 :Eu 2+ phosphors are also introduced for LED package tests. The results demonstrate that Phellodendron is a potential candidate for white LED applications.",

Commercially-available W-LEDs are fabricated by combining either a blue-emitting InGaN-based LED chip covered by a yellow-emitting phosphor Y 3 Al 5 O 12 :Ce 3+ (YAG) [2] [3] [4] [5] or n-UV LED chip with coupling red, green and blue tricolor phosphors [6] [7] [8] [9] . A large number of luminescent materials used for LED applications are based on rare-earth ions doping technology 1, 10-12 . Given a history of ecological concerns about pollution from rare earth mines, particularly in China, there are growing social and environmental concerns about the growth of the mining and mineral processing in this sector [13] [14] [15] . Apart from rare-earth ions doping, nature of narrow absorption for YAG limit its application for n-UV LED application. Advent of technological advancement and economic growth have put our environment at great risk which has led researchers and scientists to develop technology that generates less negative environmental impact. We need to find some substitute for reducing the usage of rare-earth ions, preferably.",

Phellodendron bark mainly composed of berberine and palmatine [18] [19] [20] , which have been vastly used in Chinese traditional medicine [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] for various symptomatic treatment and pharmacological activities, such as inflammation 26, 27 , anti-diarrhoea 19, 25 , antitumor [28] [29] [30] [31] , antiviral 18, 32, 33 , and pneumonia 34 . Aside from its importance in traditional and modern pharmaceuticals, Phellodendron bark has been one of the major sources of yellow dye in Asia for fibers and paper materials not only for its color but also for its insect repellency [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] . Berberine and palmatine have received much attention in the field of medicine, dyes and dyeing since it is one of the few cationic colorants of the natural plant dyes, and it has high alkaloids 40, 41 . Furthermore, Zhang et al. found the yellow varnish on the metallic foil of a 19-20th century Tibetan altar, the presence of berberine and possible palmatine as well, by using HPLC-MS analysis 42 . Its major chromophoric substance is known to be berberine and palmatine which dyes fibers into yellow color from Phellodendron bark. To the best of our knowledge, there is no study on both the luminescence properties and LED applications of yellow material from Phellodendron bark. In this study, we firstly demonstrate that Phellodendron phosphor by extracting natural Phellodendron bark with ether and composition and luminescence of Phellodendron phosphor were investigated. In addition, in order to reduce usage of rare-earth ions, we combine commercial phosphor and natural Phellodendron phosphor by extracting.",

This yellow-emission phosphor is believed to replace rare earth ion-doped phosphors and reduce their usage in LED applications. Phellodendron phosphor could be pumped by near-UV light or blue light because of its nature of wide absorption band. We construct a series of LED package data by using YAG, CaAlSiN 3 :Eu 2+ and Phellodendron phosphor for comparison. The proposed approaches may be alternative combination for LED applications in the future.",

The daylight color shown in Fig. 1c was amber yellow. In UV box, Phellodendron phosphor displayed mustard yellow and canary yellow under 254 nm and 365 nm excitation, respectively. Since the alkaloids in Phellodendron chinense Schneid were high polar, methanol-d 4 was used as a solvent to ensure that all the extract can be dissolved and avoid the inference of phenolic hydroxyl signals for NMR measurement 18 . The 1 H NMR spectrum of Phellodendron phosphor is well documented in methanol-d 4 in Fig. S2 and Table S1 . The analysis of the NMR spectrum of Phellodendron phosphor revealed the extracts is Berberine 18 . FT-IR spectroscopy was used to analyze to the functional groups in Phellodendron phosphor, as shown in Fig The optical property of Phellodendron phosphor was analyzed using UV visible spectroscopy and the corresponding spectrum is shown in Fig. 2b . The broad absorption peak was from 200 nm to 500 nm. The absorption coefficient \u03b1 in many amorphous semiconductors shows an exponential dependence on photon energy usually obeying the empirical relation.

From results of Fig. 2 (c) and (d), Phellodendron phosphor showed both direct band gap and indirect band gap were determined to be 2.49 eV and 2.62 eV, respectively. Normalized photoluminescence excitation and photoluminescence emission spectra of Phellodendron phosphor and YAG:Ce are displayed in Fig. 2e . Phellodendron phosphor exhibits a nature of broad absorption band from 360 nm to 500 nm, indicating that it can be effectively applied in general lighting for UV, nUV and blue-pumping LED devices. The emission spectra of Phellodendron phosphor and YAG:Ce excited at 460 nm display the broad yellow-emitting peak at 543 nm and 560 nm, respectively. YAG:Ce, however, could only be excited at 460 nm according to the sharp absorption band at ~460 nm. Even though, the luminous intensity of Phellodendron phosphor is 3% of that of YAG:Ce phosphor at 460 nm excitation. Nevertheless, when Phellodendron phosphors were excited at 380 nm, the luminous intensity of Phellodendron phosphor is more than 139% than that of YAG:Ce phosphor. Phellodendron phosphor can be applied both nUV and blue chip for LED devices following to the above result. Fig. S3a shows PL/PLE spectra of commercial red-emission phosphor-CaAlSiN 3 :Eu 2+ .

The orange line in Fig. 2f displays the PL decay profile of the Phellodendron phosphor under excitation of the 260 nm laser. The PL profile can be well fitted by a sum of exponential expressions (equation 2) and the average lifetimes (\u03c4) for bi-exponential decay of fluorescence were calculated from the decay times and pre-exponential factors, using the following equation (equation 3) as previous work 47 : CaAlSiN 3 :Eu 2+ phosphor into phosphor paste, the color temperature of W-LEDs changed from cold color temperature to warm color temperature.

The results indicated that phosphor gives an intense yellow emission peak at 540 nm under optimal excitation wavelength of 460 nm. The absorption band of phosphor was in the range of 350-525 nm, which could be excited by either n-UV chips or blue chips. The amount of phosphor contain can thus be adjusted to optimize the color intensity efficiency, CIE coordinate, correlated color temperature (CCT) and color-rendering index (CRI) of the light emitting diode (LED).

The behavior of bi-exponential decay of Phellodendron phosphor indicate that there were a fast component \u03c4 f (0.85 ns) and a slow component \u03c4 s (4.08 ns). The phenomenon is similar with previous studies, such as carbon quantum dots and luminesce dyes47 . According to the above equations, the decay curve inFig. 2fgives a average time constant of \u03c4 = 2.47 ns. The Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage (CIE) color diagram of above Phellodendron phosphor (D), YAG phosphor (Y) and CaAlSiN 3 :Eu 2+ phosphor (R) are shown in Fig. 3a. The CIE coordinates of three samples are marked in CIE 1931 chromaticity diagram beyond D (0.41, 0.55), Y (0.44, 0.53), and R (0.64, 0.36), respectively. The images of samples are excited under 365 nm in UV box. Furthermore, in order to demonstrate the promising application of Phellodendron phosphor in solid-state lighting. We package LED by combing Phellodendron phosphor and commercial YAG:Ce phosphor. Due to the high CCT (over>5000 K) of commercial W-LED (blue LED + YAG:Ce), it produces a cold bluish white. Owing to the continuous advances in phosphor technologies, tunable CCT from 2700-6500 K can be achieved 48 . W-LEDs are constructed by combing Phellodendron phosphor and the commercial YAG:Ce phosphor with an InGaN-based blue LED chip in Fig. 3d. The commercial W-LED (Blue LED + YAG:Ce, namely LED(1)) was compared with the commercial W-LED (Blue LED, YAG:Ce, and Phellodendron phosphor, LED(2)) and the commercial W-LED (Blue LED, YAG:Ce, and CaAlSiN 3 :Eu 2+ , LED(3)). As a result, CIE coordinates of W-LEDs are changed from high CCT to low CCT after adding Phellodendron phosphor or CaAlSiN 3 :Eu 2+ phosphor in W-LEDs.
