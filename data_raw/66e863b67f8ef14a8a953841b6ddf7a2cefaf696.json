Many countries use sentinel surveillance systems to ascertain rates of medical consultations associated with influenza-like illness [1, 2] , and these data typically track the influenza epidemic curve although they cannot provide information about absolute infection rates without additional data on sensitivity and specificity over time. Serological surveillance can permit robust estimates of incidence rates in a population, although it can be costly and has rarely been employed in the US. To date the literature only contains one serological study of influenza infection in the US during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic [3] . Under a number of assumptions, sentinel surveillance data can be combined with virologic surveillance to estimate infection rates using a multiplier-type approach [4] .",

            "text": "Here we propose an alternative approach to estimating agespecific infection incidence rates in a population based on syndromic surveillance data. The idea is that different infections generate different distributions of symptom profiles for symptomatic individuals, and data on reported symptom profiles can be ''deconvolved'' to estimate the underlying incidence of various infections. For example, among children with acute respiratory illness (ARI), fever is predictive of influenza virus infection (hereafter referred to as influenza) as the etiology [5] . The proportion of febrile cases among individuals with ARI during a time period when influenza incidence is high is expected to be greater compared to the time period when influenza incidence is low. Data on symptomatic and febrile cases in age-stratified random population samples combined with an estimate of the proportion of influenza cases who develop fever can therefore potentially be used to infer influenza incidence during various time periods. More generally, using data on symptom profile distributions combined with symptom data collected through surveillance, one can estimate the symptomatic incidence attributable to each infection; the latter estimate is obtained using the Expectation-Maximization algorithm [6, 7] . Similar considerations, though involving different estimation methodology for symptoms and causes of death appeared in [8] .",

For influenza, various estimates of the asymptomatic fraction exist in the literature [9, 10, 11] .

We used the distribution of reported symptoms of individuals with influenza confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in a community-based study [12] . Household contacts were recruited after index cases living in their household presented for medical care with influenza-like symptoms. A contact was deemed infected if at least one RT-PCR test was positive out of the 3 tests conducted during a 7-day follow-up period. A contact was deemed having fever if the maximal recorded tympanic temperature was 37.8uC or above. 118 influenza positive contacts in [12] had a presence of at least one of the following four signs or symptoms: fever, cough, runny nose, sore throat. We have examined the following two choices of symptom profiles for the inference process and estimated their distributions using data for those 118 individuals: The distribution of symptom profiles reported by cases with ARI not associated with influenza may be quite specific to the location and the circulating respiratory viruses. One may be able to use symptom surveillance data itself during a period when one knows that the percent of flu among symptomatic individuals is very low to suggest that almost all symptoms are attributable to non-flu causes. Thus overall counts of symptom profiles reported by all symptomatic individuals during that period give an estimate of the non-flu symptom profile distribution.

The eight weeks in the symptom surveillance data represent a period after an apparent peak of a seasonal influenza outbreak on the wider campus, as can be seem from data on influenza positive tests and ILI consultations on the campus medical facilities. The latter data suggest that flu circulation during the last two of the eight weeks was particularly low (figure S6 in section S5); surveillance data for those last two weeks in the survey was used to assess the non-flu symptom profile distribution. This symptom profile data from the last two weeks, available for 642 symptomatic individuals was combined with symptom data for the 118 RT-PCR positive household contacts of flu cases, as specified in section 2 of the methods to assess the influenza outbreak during weeks 1-6 in the survey period.",

Currently available surveillance methods render a limited assessment of the epidemic's growth patterns while serological surveillance is not commonly employed.

Such surveillance (e.g. [22] ), combined with estimates of the distribution of symptom profiles for symptomatic influenza cases may, in principle, render an accurate estimate of the influenza incidence curve via the deconvolution process. We have proposed a collection of symptom profiles to be used in the deconvolution process, suggested how the corresponding symptom profile distributions can be estimated from data and tested the robustness of our method by numerical simulations. We wish to point out that while we restricted our methodology to influenzalike symptoms, it could in principle be adapted to estimation of incidence of other types of diseases (e.g. enteric infections), particularly if the infection of interest has a profile of symptoms which largely sets it apart from other related infections (similarly to the presence of fever, which is much more common for flu than for other respiratory infections).",

Estimate of the flu incidence is particularly sensitive to an estimate of the non-flu symptom profile distribution because there are many more symptomatic non-flu cases compared to the number of symptomatic flu cases in a survey, so a misattribution of a certain percentage of non-flu cases to flu is magnified relative to the flu data. Since the distribution of symptom profiles for non-flu cases may be specific to the given population, we propose to consider a time period in the surveillance data when very little influenza circulation is known to have taken place and use the symptom surveillance data for that period for an estimate of the symptom profile distribution for non-influenza cases. In this way, large sample size for the surveillance data would also ensure a more accurate estimate of the non-flu symptom profile distribution. Additionally, larger samples increase the size of the symptomatic counts attributable to influenza both in absolute terms and also relative to the noise in such counts attributable to non-flu cases, further improving the accuracy of the deconvolution process.",

            "text": "An additional potential issue with the symptom profile distribution for non-flu symptomatic cases is that it might change in time. The latter might occur due to an outbreak of a particular respiratory agent, such as human rhinovirus, coronavirus, or respiratory syncytial virus. The symptom profile distribution of these infections might be different from the overall distribution for symptomatic non-flu cases. One way to deal with this is to include this agent into the list of infections whose incidence is estimated through the deconvolution process. Alternatively, one may stick with flu and symptomatic non-flu cases as the two infectious profiles and use the excess fever approach (symptom profiles given by equation (2b)). The latter might still be robust because fever is much more common for flu than for non-flu cases and excess fever attributable to flu when flu circulation is sufficiently high should be larger than excess fever attributable to the potential difference in the probability of fever given non-flu symptoms during different time periods. This issue is examined through simulations in section S3, where a large non-flu outbreak with ''atypical'' symptoms is added as an unobserved component ( Figure S3 ).",

Here for illustration purposes we have used data from [12] on RT-PCR positive household contacts recruited when a household index influenza case sought medical care. It is known that the accuracy of the PCR test is correlated with symptom presentation [23] . While three RT-PCR tests were administered on each household contact in [12] , it is possible that some infected household contacts have tested negative, and this group is correlated with a weaker presentation of symptoms. Due to a relatively small sample size in [12] we did not attempt to derive age-stratified estimates of the symptom profile distribution. Some difference in symptom profile distribution for seasonal influenza A and B cases is possible (see section S2), though no statistically significant difference could be detected for the small sample of cases where sub-typing was performed. We believe that larger studies involving serology may render more accurate, age-stratified assessment of the syndrome distribution for seasonal influenza.",

The survey was not initially designed for our estimation method, with its size being too small for accurate estimates of influenza incidence. Data on symptom profiles for influenza used in the deconvolution process for the University of Michigan campus is obtained from a different population in [12] . Our assumption, based on the campus medical facilities data, that the influenza outbreak has waned towards the end of the study period may not be representative of the whole University of Michigan campus. Therefore our estimates for the University of Michigan outbreak are mostly given for illustrative purposes. A careful study design should be used to avoid some of those issues. Such design should perhaps involve the recruitment of a large number of individuals (larger than what is needed for a weekly survey) with a commitment from them to complete a certain number of surveys when prompted during the study period. The latter should decrease the correlation between the weekly symptom reports and increase the percent of weekly recruits who fill out a report, taking away from the recruitment bias when participation might be correlated with symptom presentation. Finally, serologic data if available could validate the syndrome-based estimation of infection attack rates.",
