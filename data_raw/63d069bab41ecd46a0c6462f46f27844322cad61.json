In this framework, does the R 0 value represent the number of new infections within the environment or within the population of living hosts? It will turn out that the R 0 value in the WAIT framework represents a kind of average of both of these interpretations, or more precisely, a geometric mean of the two.

            "text": "There are two modes of transmission of new infection in the HCV model. One is the infection of clean needles due to injection by infected hosts, and the other is the infection of susceptible hosts due to injection by infected needles. These two modes of transmission each have a reproductive ratio associated with them: the first would be the number of new infected needles caused by a single infected host in a fully susceptible population of needles, in the average amount of time that a host is infected. The second would be the number of new infections of susceptible hosts caused by a single infected needle in fully susceptible population of hosts, in the time that the needle is infected. The first of these two, which we will denote by X, can be derived by considering the rate of transmission of infection to clean needles, per infected host. In the dynamical equations, the total rate of the infection of needles is given by \u03b1(I E + I L ) Nu Ni+Nu , hence the rate per infected host is simply \u03b1 Nu Ni+Nu . At the disease-free equilibrium, the fraction Nu Ni+Nu is unity since there are no infected needles in the population. This leaves \u03b1 as the per capita rate of new infection of needles. There are two infected compartments that can contribute to new infection of needles, I E and I L , and a host enters the early-stage compartment first before potentially progressing (with rate \u03c9) to the late-stage. The number of new infections will be therefore be the sum of the infections of needles caused by a host moving through both infected stages, and we will have to weight the number of infections from the I L compartment by the fraction of the time a host progresses to this stage. The average time that a host spends in the I E compartment is 1/(\u00b5 + \u03c4 + \u03c6 + \u03c9)-i.e. the reciprocal of the exit rate of that compartment. The average amount of S2 time a host spends in the I L compartment is 1/(\u00b5 + \u03c4 ). Thus, since \u03b1 represents the per capita rate of new infection of needles by infected hosts, then \u03b1 \u00d7 1/(\u00b5 + \u03c4 + \u03c6 + \u03c9) is the average number of new infections of needles by hosts in the I E compartment. Whereas, \u03b1 \u00d7 1/(\u00b5 + \u03c4 ) is the number of new infections of needles caused by hosts in the I L compartment. The fraction of the time a host progresses from I E to I L is given by \u03c9/(\u00b5 + \u03c4 + \u03c6 + \u03c9), since this represents the fraction of the rate of exiting the I E compartment by exactly one of the four possible ways; namely, by progressing to I L , as opposed to death/cessation (\u00b5), treatment (\u03c4 ), or spontaneous recovery (\u03c6). Thus, the average number of needle infections caused by an infected host is given by \u03b1 \u00b5+\u03c4 +\u03c6+\u03c9 + \u03b1\u03c9 (\u00b5+\u03c4 )(\u00b5+\u03c4 +\u03c6+\u03c9) . The first term represents the rate of new infections of needles caused by hosts in the I E compartment, multiplied by the time spent in that compartment, and the second is the same but for the I L compartment, and is scaled by the fraction of time hosts progress to the I L stage. Simplifying somewhat, X is given by X = \u03b1(\u00b5+\u03c4 +\u03c9) (\u00b5+\u03c4 )(\u00b5+\u03c4 +\u03c6+\u03c9) .",

That is, if the average time an agent spends within a compartment, such as I E , is 5 days, for example, then one would expect 1/5 of the compartment to leave daily. This is because one expects that on any day, 1/5 of the compartment's population is comprised of agents who entered the set 5 days ago, 1/5 is comprised of those who entered 4 days ago, and so on-here the assumption is that the time spent in a compartment, as well as the entrance rate into the compartment, each exhibit little variance over time. So, the average time within a compartment is the reciprocal of the exit rate-where the exit rate is taken as a proportion of the total population, as opposed to an absolute rate of change in the population size.",

The DFE value for N u -the uninfected needles-is given by \u03c0 N /k u , which is easily verified by inspection of the N u dynamical equation. Thus, inserting this into the above rate, and considering the rate per infected needle N i , one is left with \u03b2 \u03c0 N \u00b5 ku \u03c0 N as the rate of new host infections caused by infected needles per infected needle. As in the prior argument, the average lifetime a needle spends infected is given simply by the reciprocal of the exit rate for agents in the set. In this case, the exit rate of infected needles is given by -the virus decay rate-and by k i -the infected needle discard rate. Hence, the average lifetime for an infected needle is given by 1/( + k i ). Thus, Y is given by \u03b2 \u03c0 N \u00b5 ku \u03c0 N \u00d7 1/( + k i ) = \u03b2\u03c0 N ku \u00b5( +ki)\u03c0 N .

Namely, increasing the discard rate of all needles will, in particular, reduce the number of uninfected needles in the population and-due to asymmetries in how infected and uninfected needles are treated in the model-can actually lead to an increase in the proportion of infected needles in the population, increasing the probability that a user will become infected. Asymmetries between infected and uninfected needles include (1) uninfected needles are fueled by a constant source, \u03c0 N , whereas infected needles are fueled only by contact with a varying infected source, and (2) infected needles can flow back to the uninfected compartment in proportion to the number of needles infected at that instant, effectively augmenting the discard rate of infected needles, k i , with the additional term . In this way, there is a kind of biasing towards the flow of needles into the uninfected compartment. That is, the uninfected compartment receives a constant flux from the \u03c0 N term along with an additional flux from viral decay of infected needles, . The infected compartment, however, will take losses from the viral decay and can only gain from infected needle use. This is only a heuristic description, but it motivates how changes in the needle discard rate, though equal for both compartments, may have differing impacts on their dynamics, and in particular on their steady-state values. We examine the mathematical details of this behavior below.",

In Figure 4b in the main text, we demonstrate how changing k u and k i can modify the value of R 0 . We find that increasing k u while moving along a constant value of k i has the effect of increasing the R 0 value. Whereas, increasing k i while moving along a constant value of k u reduces R 0 . That is, removing more uninfected needles while keeping the same infected needle discard rate can harm a population of PWID, and doing the opposite helps the population. One can also see that increasing k u and k i simultaneously along the diagonal line-where k u = k i -will increase R 0 . This suggests that if a distinction between infected and uninfected needles cannot be determined (as is often the case), then adding clean needles to a population has a larger impact on disease burden than flatly removing all needles. (c) shows the fraction of infected needles in the population across the fractional discard rate k, i.e. it shows the value of N i /(N u + N i ) at equilibrium as a function of k. Note, that these are endemic equilibria, whereas the disease-free equilibrium will occur when the infection fully clears from the population of PWID, and the population of infected needles goes to zero accordingly. By setting the model equations to zero, one can determine the equilibrium or steady state values of the agents as a function of the parameters in the model. In doing so, we can demonstrate more quantitatively how the proportion of infected and uninfected needles is affected by modifying the discard rate of needles.

This is consistent with a prior point about the effects of flatly discarding needles, without regard to their infected or uninfected status: it can increase the proportion of infected needles in a population and thus fuel the epidemic. Fig. S1(C) shows the fraction of infected needles in the population, and although one finds that the absolute number of infected needles in equilibrium will subside beyond a certain value of k (in our case this is around k = 0.10), we find that the fraction of infected needles is a monotonically increasing function of k.

This result is counter-intuitive but it can be understood by considering the fact that increasing k means that more needles of all types are removed from the system in a given amount of time. In particular, if this leads to a sufficient reduction of the uninfected needles in circulation then, since infection rates depend on the fraction of both types of needles in the model, it is possible to reduce the fraction of uninfected needles in the population, thereby increasing the fraction of infected needles and increasing the infection rates among hosts.

This is an indication that when the phenomena of interest are modelled in this manner, one can expect that the dynamics of the infection are also shared fairly evenly among the parameters. Fig. S2 demonstrates how the value of R 0 shares its dependence evenly among most of the parameters. We calculated the Partial Rank Correlation Coefficient (PRCC) with respect to the value of R 0 , for each of the parameters in the R 0 formula ( Figure 6 in the main text). The calculation followed the lines given in Blower and Dowlatabadi (1994) [2] , and we will briefly recapitulate the calculation here.",

Each sample of 11 parameters was used to calculate a value of R 0 . Then, the resulting R 0 values and parameters were ranked according to their value among the 100 samples. That is, the R 0 value and the 11 parameters in each sample were assigned numbers 1-100 depending on how they ranked compared to other samples. This results in 11 vectors, and one additional vector for R 0 , of length 100, whose entries are just some ordering of the whole numbers between 1 and 100-we will call them rank vectors. Then, between any two of the 11 rank vectors and one additional rank vector for R 0 we can calculate the generic correlation coefficient for the 100 samples. If we arrange the parameters, indexing them 1 through 11, and the R 0 value, giving it the index 12, into a list of variables, then we can construct the correlation coefficients C ij , between the ith and jth variable, into a symmetric matrix C.",

Thus, for i and j between 1 and 11, C ij is the correlation coefficient between the ith and jth parameter, and for i between 1 and 11, C i,12 (= C 12,i ) are the rank-correlations between the ith parameter and the value of R 0 .
