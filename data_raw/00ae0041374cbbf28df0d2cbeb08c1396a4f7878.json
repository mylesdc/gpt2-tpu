The 2-5As bind and activate the RNase L, an endoRNase degrading viral and cellular RNA leading to inhibition of viral replication. The 2-5A system is tightly controlled by synthesis and degradation of 2-5As. Whereas synthesis is mediated by the 2\u2032-5\u2032 oligoadenylate synthetase family of enzymes, degradation seems to be orchestrated by multiple enzyme nucleases including phosphodiesterase 12, the ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 1 and the A-kinase anchoring protein 7.",

A procedure is described for the production of 2\u2032-5\u2032 oligoadenylates, which are then used as substrates for development and demonstration of enzyme assays measuring synthetase and nuclease activities, respectively. The synthetase assays produce only a single reaction product allowing for very precise kinetic assessment of the enzymes. We present an assay using dATP and the A(pA) 3 tetramer core as substrates, which requires prior isolation of A(pA) 3 . A synthetase assay using either of the dNTPs individually together with NAD + as substrates is also presented. The nuclease reactions make use of the isolated 2\u2032-5\u2032 oligoadenylates in producing a mixture of shorter reaction products, which are resolved by ion-exchange chromatography to determine the enzyme activities. A purified human 2\u2032-5\u2032 oligoadenylate synthetase and a purified human phosphodiesterase 12 along with crude extracts expressing those proteins, are used to demonstrate the assays. Conclusions: This paper comprises an assay toolbox for identification and characterization of the synthetases and nucleases regulating cellular 2-5A levels. Assays are presented for both enzyme families. The assays can also be used to address a broader cellular role of the OAS enzymes, based on the multiple substrate specificity intrinsic to these proteins.",

IFNs are extracellular cytokines specific to (jawed) vertebrates and central to host innate immunity. Upon binding of cognate receptors, they induce numerous intracellular signaling cascades, leading to transcriptional activation of several hundred genes, which altogether determine the biological outcome involving antiviral, antitumoral, and immunomodulatory effects [1] [2] [3] [4] . One gene family induced by IFNs is the double-stranded RNA-dependent 2\u2032-5\u2032 oligoadenylate synthetases (dsRNA-dependent OASs) in humans comprising four members, OAS1, OAS2, OAS3 and OAS-like (OASL). At least six OAS isoforms are expressed from these four human genes: two splice variants from the OAS1 and OAS2 genes and a single variant from each of the OASL and OAS3 genes [5, 6] . In comparison, the mice genome encodes multiple OAS genes: eight OAS1 genes, one each of the OAS2 and OAS3 genes and two OASL genes, believed to have arisen from duplication and divergence events from a common ancestral gene [7, 8] . Upon binding of viral dsRNA, the OAS enzymes synthesize 2-5As from ATP leading to accumulation of 2-5As. These 2-5As in turn activate RNase L, an endoRNase degrading viral and cellular RNA. RNase L cleaves RNA 3\u2032 to UN sequences, but mainly at UA and UU sites, N being any of the nucleotide bases in RNA, and this results in inhibition of viral replication [9] [10] [11] [12] . Note that despite of binding dsRNA and ATP, the human OASL is catalytically inactive due to key mutations in the active site compared with the other OAS isoforms [13] .",

The OASs actually combines a broad range of substrates (not only ATP) to form 2\u2032-5\u2032 heterooligonucleotides in vitro, thus they are better described as general 2\u2032-5\u2032-nucleotidyl transferases [14, 15] . The requirements on the acceptor-site is a 2\u2032-end positioned AMP linked in an RpA configuration, where R specifies either ATP, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD + ), or oligomeric or polymeric primers (e.g. tRNA, Ap 4 A, Ap 3 A). In the donor-site, all nucleoside-triphosphates (NTPs) as well as deoxy-nucleoside-triphosphates (dNTPs) can be used, N specifying the nucleotide bases in DNA and RNA. The following general reaction scheme apply to the varied enzyme capabilities of the OASs: RpA + (d)NTP \u2192 PPi + RpA-(d)NMP in which the incorporation of AMP prompts for oligoadenylate synthesis by means of multiple 2\u2032 elongation events (the other NMPs and dNMPs make up single incorporation events only).",

            "text": "Due to low sequence specificity, RNase L degrades cellular RNA and prolonged activation results in an antiproliferative response leading to apoptosis [9] [10] [11] 16] . Immediate de-activation of RNase L is therefore required following viral infection, which can be achieved by either of two ways, (i) through the reversible binding of an RNase L inhibitor allowing for temporary inactivation, or (ii) by degradation of the activator 2-5As leading to persistent inactivation [17, 18] . The identification and exploration of cellular nucleases degrading 2-5As and 2-5A core molecules (the 5\u2032-dephosphorylated forms of 2-5As), is currently ongoing. At present, three enzyme candidates exist: the phosphodiesterase 12 (PDE12) [18] , the ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 1 (ENPP1) [19] and the A-kinase anchoring protein 7 (AKAP7) [20] . Even though these enzymes all degrade the 2\u2032-5\u2032 oligoadenylates in vitro, the evidence that they truly antagonize the 2-5A system in cells has yet to be reported. Also two viral proteins, ns2 [21] and VP3 [22] belonging to the group 2a betacoronaviruses and group A rotaviruses, respectively, have been found to degrade the 2\u2032-5\u2032 oligoadenylates in vitro. In addition, the ns2 and VP3 proteins have been shown to antagonize the 2-5A pathway during viral infection by preventing RNase L activation, thereby evading the host innate immune response [21, 22] . PDE12 is localized in the mitochondrial matrix [23] , ENPP1 in the plasma membrane with its active site pointing towards the extracellular matrix [24] and AKAP7 in the nucleus of cells [25] . 2-5As are mainly produced in the cytosol (and to some extend in the nucleus), which is also the site of viral replication [26] [27] [28] [29] . For PDE12 and ENPP1, the 2\u2032-5\u2032 oligoadenylates therefore need to traverse a membrane, i.e. either the inner mitochondrial membrane or the plasma membrane in order for degradation to take place. How exactly this would occur remains unknown, though processes like receptor-mediated transport or diffusion may be involved. By contrast, AKAP7 may have access to the 2\u2032-5\u2032 oligoadenylates based on its cellular localization and the fact that nuclear pores allow for diffusion of molecules between compartments. The ability of AKAP7 to restore infectivity of a mutant murine coronavirus carrying an inactivated variant of the ns2 gene has recently been investigated [20] . It was found that a mislocalized version of AKAP7 present in the cytoplasm could restore the infectivity of the mutant virus, which was not the case for the fulllength protein localized in the nucleus. This suggests that the 2\u2032-5\u2032 nucleases must be localized in very close proximity to the sites of viral replication, in order to maintain tight regulation over the 2-5A system. Also 5\u2032-phosphatases trimming 2-5As to 2-5A core molecules might take play in degradation of 2\u2032-5\u2032 oligoadenylates in cells. This is based on experiments showing accumulation of 2-5A core molecules over 2-5As in cells upon viral infection [30, 31] . We hypothesize that regulation of 2-5As in cells is tightly controlled and orchestrated by multiple nucleases and phosphatases, some of which remains to be identified.",

The 2\u2032-5\u2032 oligoadenylates are used as substrates in enzyme assays for measurement of synthetase and nuclease activities. Amongst others, we present an enzyme assay using the A(pA) 3 tetramer core and dATP as substrates in producing a A(pA) 3 pdA pentameric product. The assay requires prior isolation of the A(pA) 3 tetramer core. We also present a synthetase assay using NAD + and either dATP, dCTP, dGTP or dTTP as substrates for the OAS enzyme. This assay is well-suited to assess the broader cellular role expected of the OASs, based on the very diverse substrate specificity in vitro.",

The analysis of 2-5A synthesis was carried using a Mono Q HR 5/5 column (GE Healthcare) on the \u00c4KTAexplorer.

The 200 mL reaction was then divided in two equal parts (100 mL each), one part for isolation of 2-5As and the other for isolation of 2-5A core molecules. The 2-5A core molecules were produced by incubation of the 2-5As with alkaline phosphatase (100 U/mL) for 16 h at 37\u00b0C. Preparative fractionation of 2-5As and 2-5A core molecules were with the Mono Q HR 16/10 column using a linear gradient of 0-10 % and 10-30 % of Buffer D over 3.6 CV and 24 CV, respectively. The sample injection volume were~10 mL for each of the fractionations, therefore the method was repeated several times in order to obtain separation of the entire reaction volume of 200 mL. For concentration of the oligoadenylates, the fractions of successive runs representing identical peaks were pooled and diluted 10 fold in Buffer C, in most cases resulting in total volumes of 1-2 l. This was applied over night to the Mono Q HR 16/10 column using the inlet A of the \u00c4KTAexplorer chromatography system running at a constant flow rate of 1 mL/min. The day after, elution was performed by a step gradient to 50 % of Buffer D, allowing for highly concentrated fractions of the individual oligoadenylates. Purity and concentration of the oligoadenylates were determined by application of small aliquots (~20 \u03bcl) to the Mono Q HR 16/10 column as described above. For concentration determination, ATP was used as an internal control. All the chromatographic procedures were carried using 254 nm as the absorbance wavelength.

The efficiency of the reaction was assessed by Q anion-exchange chromatography, and the resulting chromatogram can be seen in Fig. 1a . In this figure two chromatograms have been superimposed, the 2-5A reaction mix (blue curve) and the control molecules (red curve): adenosine, 5\u2032-AMP, 5\u2032-ADP and 5\u2032-ATP, in order to visually distinguish the reaction products (2-5As) from the ATP substrate. The batch of synthesised 2-5As was subsequently split in two parts, one part for isolation of 2-5As and the other for isolation of 2-5A core molecules. The conversion from 2-5As into 2-5A core molecules was performed by treatment with alkaline phosphatase. The 2-5As and 2-5A core molecules were then resolved by Mono Q chromatography, which resulted in high quality and quantity of many individual 2-5A molecules. Fig. 1b and c show how individual 2-5As and 2-5A core molecules up to and above the decamer length were successfully resolved. A homogenous preparation of the pppApA, the 2-5A dimer could not be obtained due to co-elution with ATP (see Fig. 1b) . Also, adenosine and the ApA core dimer were found to only weakly bind the resin under the experimental conditions used (running buffer: 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5). These molecules were thus detected 3 ). Blue curves: The 2\u2032-5\u2032 oligoadenylates numbered according to length, hence 2 specify the pppApA (or ApA) dimer, 3 the pppA(pA) 2 (or A(pA) 2 ) trimer, 4 the pppA(pA) 3 (or A(pA) 3 ) tetramer and so forth. Red curve in (a): Chromatogram obtained using control molecules: Adenosine, 5\u2032-AMP, 5\u2032-ADP and 5\u2032-ATP as indicated. Brown curves: Experimental salt gradients. mAU (milli-absorbance unit) is the unit used for molecular detection at 254 nm, and mS/cm (milliSiemens/centimeter) the unit used to measure conductivities before application of the experimental salt gradient used for separation, but after the void volume of the column. The individual 2-5As and 2-5A core molecules were subsequently concentrated in three steps, by a 10 fold dilution of the samples in running buffer to reduce the overall sodium chloride content, re-application of the molecules to the Mono Q column and elution by a step-gradient of 0.5 M sodium chloride. In Fig. 1d the elution profile obtained from concentration of the A(pA) 3 tetramer core is shown. Here a starting volume of~200 mL (i.e. before dilution) was converted to less than 3 mL (~70 fold concentration of the molecule). In Fig. 1e , an aliquot of the final concentrated sample was resolved by Mono Q chromatography to confirm molecular purity. The detection of a single peak at the expected retention volume, suggests that this a very homogenous preparation of the A(pA) 3 tetramer core. Using this procedure, we have obtained very high yields of many individual 2\u2032-5\u2032 oligoadenylates. Of the three substrates utilized here: A(pA) 3 tetramer core, A(pA) 4 pentamer core and A(pA) 5 hexamer core, a total of 17.2, 15.5 and 11.3 mg were obtained corresponding to 10.1, 9.1 and 6.6 mg of oligoadenylate per mg human His-OAS1 used in the reaction, respectively.",

The reaction can be summarized as follows: dATP + A(pA) 3 \u2192 A(pA) 3 pdA + PPi. The fact that all reactants and products are negatively charged at physiological pH allow for fractionation by anionexchange chromatography.",

The assays demonstrated here utilize the tetramer core A(pA) 3 , pentamer core A(pA) 4 and hexamer core A(pA) 5 substrates in reactions with the purified PDE12\u0394mTP-His enzyme or HeLa cell protein extracts. The substrate and products were resolved by Mono Q chromatography. The chromatograms for purified protein (PDE12\u0394mTP-His) are shown in Fig. 4 and for HeLa cell protein extracts in Fig. 5 . Different controls were included. For the purified protein, a reaction omitting the enzyme was used to measure the extent to which the substrate might undergo autohydrolysis. For the crude protein extracts, the contribution of normal cellular proteins to total enzyme activities, i.e. endogenous activities versus total enzyme activities, need to be distinguished to precisely map the activity specific to the expressed recombinant protein. This was done by including a reaction of protein extracts from emptyvector (EV) transfected cells, and using this as the measure of cellular endogenous activity (purple curves in Fig. 5) . We also carried out a reaction with protein extracts from HeLa cells overexpressing an irrelevant Fig. 2 Single-product OAS assay using dATP and A(pA) 3 as substrates.

This correlates with the fact that PDE12 has been described as a 2\u2032-5\u2032 exonuclease producing 5\u2032-AMP during each reaction cycle, which is temporally separated by dissociation and re-binding of substrates (i.e. a distributive enzyme) [19] . The distributive cleavage of 2\u2032-5\u2032 oligoadenylates by PDE12 can be described with a single cleavage event conforming to the reaction scheme: (p) x A(pA) n \u2192 (p) x A(pA) n-1 + AMP, where x = [0, 1, 2 or 3], n \u2265 1, implying that substrates can be processed until n = 1. Processive enzymes on the other hand might catalyze the reactions to completion generating two reaction products exclusively: adenosine plus AMP for 2-5A core molecules and ATP plus AMP for 2-5As. The following reaction scheme describes this mode of catalysis: (p) x A(pA) n \u2192 (p) x A + nAMP, where x = [0, 1, 2 or 3] and n \u2265 1. Note that regardless of the degradation mechanism (distributive versus processive), one molecule of AMP is produced per cleavage event assuming that degradation is mediated by an exonuclease activity. Therefore the activities obtained from different nucleases on a single substrate as well as for one nuclease on several substrates, are directly comparable provided that the conclusions will be based on the quantity of AMP generated. Table 1 provides an overview of the specific enzyme activities calculated for PDE12, based on the reactions presented. Note that for crude protein extracts, the specific activity attributable to PDE12 only, can be inferred by subtraction of the cellular endogenous activities (either DsRed or EV analyses) from total enzyme activities (PDE12 reactions).",

In the dATP/A(pA) 3 assay, human OAS1 p42 was found to produce the A(pA) 3 pdA pentamer product with a specific activity of 1.1 mmole/(sec*g). An estimate of 0.2 mmole/(sec*g) on formation of 2-5As using ATP as substrate has previously been determined for human OAS1 p42 [48] . This difference (5-6 fold) might result from the lower estimate being based on formation of multiple products, i.e. 2-5As compared with the single product A(pA) 3 pdA formed in our assay. Variations may also result from the approach used to quantify reactants and products. We carried out quantification based on the integral of the corresponding peaks following anion-exchange chromatography, whereas in [48] quantification was based on 4 pentamer core or (c) A(pA) 5 hexamer core for one hour at 37\u00b0C, and the products resolved by Mono Q chromatography.

Similar assays using rabbit OAS1 in reactions with NAD + and NTPs (ATP, GTP, UTP and CTP, respectively) have previously been conducted yielding specific activities of 0.0009 mmole/(sec*g) for NAD-pA, 0.0005 mmole/(sec*g) for NAD-pG, 0.0009 mmole/(sec*g) for NAD-pU and 0.0008 mmole/(sec*g) for NAD-pC [15] . Indeed our estimates are higher, which may reflect the different sources of OAS used, i.e. human versus rabbit, the strategy undertaken for analyzing product formation, i.e. anion-exchange chromatography versus thin-layer chromatography, or simply that we have used dNTPs over NTPs in the reactions. Note that NAD + was initially demonstrated to be a preferred primer over ATP for the OASs, producing mainly NAD + derivatives such as NAD-pA in reactions of both substrates [49] . This result was however contradicted by Ferbus et al. [15] , showing that NAD + and ATP are used with equal efficiencies when part of the same reaction. In the dNTP/NAD + assay demonstrated here, we chose to substitute the ATP with dNTPs to accommodate the need for a singleproduct assay. Importantly, the above synthetase assays are applicable also to crude extracts, e.g. bacterial or mammalian cell protein extracts (data not shown). This is possible through use of a creatine kinase system applied in the reaction buffer, which continuously regenerates dATP from the dADP and dAMP inhibitors formed during the reaction.",

Whereas the (A5\u2032)p 4 (5\u2032A)-pA(pA) 2 strongly inhibited protein synthesis at concentrations similar to the pppA(pA) 2 trimer, no effect was observed for the NAD + and ADP-ribose derivatives. The (A5\u2032)p 4 (5\u2032A)-pA(pA) 2 could also activate RNase L in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate, which was not the case for the other derivatives. Conversion of the (A5\u2032)p 4 (5\u2032A)-pA(pA) 2 conjugate to the pppA(pA) 2 trimer was proposed as a possible way for activation of RNase L in the lysate, thereby also explaining the observation of inhibition of protein synthesis. Whether this is true, or the (A5\u2032)p 4 (5\u2032A)-pA(pA) 2 conjugate inhibited protein synthesis by another mechanism, was not determined. Importantly, neither of the conjugates were detected naturally in mouse L cells even after IFNstimulation and virus infection. This suggests that these conjugates may have functions not related to the 2-5A system and might be triggered by other stimuli.",

We used oligoadenylates of tetramer length and above in our assays, thereby increasing the significance with regard to the 2-5A system. Furthermore, the assay was optimized to resolve all the reactants and products by anion-exchange chromatography, which allows the direct usage of the peak integrals for calculation of enzyme activities. The activities measured for purified human PDE12\u0394mTP-His and PDE12\u0394mTP-His in HeLa cell protein extracts are listed in Table 1 . The specific enzyme activity of PDE12 has previously been determined [41, 50] . The mouse enzyme was found to exhibit a specific activity of~20*10 \u22123 mmole/(sec*g) of 5\u2032-AMP using the ApA dimer as substrate, and the bovine enzyme an activity of~0.02*10 \u22123 mmole/(sec*g) of 5\u2032-AMP using the A(pA) 2 trimer as substrate. Our values are very close to that of the mouse enzyme however differ with one to three orders of magnitude from the bovine enzyme. The fact that PDE12 is conserved throughout the mammalian lineage (e.g. human and bovine proteins share 92 % similarity at the amino acid level), immediately suggests that assay-dependent factors and not variation in protein sequence may have caused the observed difference [18] . For instance, the purified bovine sample appeared very crude as analyzed by SDS-PAGE silver staining, whereas ours was nearly free of contaminants. Accordingly, such presence of contaminants would inevitable lower the overall enzyme activities by a factor proportional to the amount of impurities versus PDE12 protein in the sample.",

Nevertheless, the total yields obtained by us are at least an order of magnitude higher, which can be ascribed to the large difference in reaction volume, i.e. 1 mL in Morin et al. [34] versus 100 mL in our case. The larger reaction volume are practical only because of the ion-exchange procedure used, where in practice, no limits exist for the sample injection volume.",

The OASs are induced and activated by IFNs leading to nanomolar levels of 2-5As, which activate RNase L. Unknown 5\u2032-phosphatases convert cytotoxic 2-5As to less cytotoxic 2-5A core molecules simultaneously with viral RNA degradation by 2-5A-activated RNase L. The 2-5A core molecules finally accumulate to micromolar levels for transportation (or diffusion) by a yet to be defined mechanism to the mitochondrial matrix for degradation by PDE12. With the recent discovery of novel cellular nucleases (ENPP1 and AKAP7) as well as virally encoded nucleases (ns2 and VP3), this process however might prove to be more complex than hitherto expected (readers are referred to a recent review by Silverman et al. [51] ). Despite PDE12, ENPP1 and AKAP7 degrades 2\u2032-5\u2032 oligoadenylates in vitro their importance during viral infection, has yet to be reported. Consequently, wide uncertainty exists as to i) which enzymes take part in 2-5A degradation in cells, ii) what are the contribution offered by each of the enzymes to the process, iii) do the enzymes have a preferred cellular substrate and iv) what are the interplay between cellular and viral nucleases during infection. The 2-5A nuclease assay demonstrated here is suitable for identification and characterization of enzyme candidates involved in the cellular degradation of 2\u2032-5\u2032 oligoadenylates. The preferred substrates of the enzymes, i.e. 2-5As versus 2-5A core molecules can also be deduced to hypothesize the exact cellular role of the proteins in question. The assay should also work for exploration of putative 5\u2032-phosphatases converting 2-5As to 2-5A core molecules using a 2-5A molecule as substrate. 2-5As and 2-5A core molecules are easily resolved by ion-exchange chromatography, making this assay straightforward.",
