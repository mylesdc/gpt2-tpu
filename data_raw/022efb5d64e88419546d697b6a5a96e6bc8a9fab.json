            "text": "Pathogen resistance and development costs are major challenges in current approaches to antiviral therapy. The high error rate of RNA synthesis and reverse-transcription confers genome plasticity, enabling the remarkable adaptability of RNA viruses to antiviral intervention. However, this property is coupled to fundamental constraints including limits on the size of information available to manipulate complex hosts into supporting viral replication. Accordingly, RNA viruses employ various means to extract maximum utility from their informationally limited genomes that, correspondingly, may be leveraged for effective host-oriented therapies. Host-oriented approaches are becoming increasingly feasible because of increased availability of bioactive compounds and recent advances in immunotherapy and precision medicine, particularly genome editing, targeted delivery methods and RNAi. In turn, one driving force behind these innovations is the increasingly detailed understanding of evolutionarily diverse hostvirus interactions, which is the key concern of an emerging field, neo-virology. This review examines biotechnological solutions to disease and other sustainability issues of our time that leverage the properties of RNA and DNA viruses as developed through coevolution with their hosts.",

            "text": "While virus-oriented approaches are efficacious, the genetic diversity of viruses often restricts such treatments to particular species or serotypes (Table 1) . Furthermore, these antivirals are often costly and are ultimately susceptible to escape mutant selection. Simple point substitutions are often responsible for treatment failure, 4,5 while fitness costs associated with harbouring these substitutions may be trivially absorbed by the escaped strain upon accumulating compensatory adaptations. 6 Tenofovir is an example of a highly effective single-regimen treatment for chronic hepatitis B infection, a retro-transcribing virus characterised by considerable genetic heterogeneity, by simultaneously imposing potent viral suppression, a high barrier for escape and reduced replicative fitness of escape strains. Despite these synergising effects, complex escape mutants harbouring multiple point substitutions in the viral reverse transcriptase have recently emerged. 7 One way of enhancing treatment efficacy while minimising viral escape is to deploy existing antivirals as combination therapies, a strategy used extensively in current HIV (e.g. tenofovir/emtricitabine) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment regimens. 4, 5 While increasing the number of combinations increases the height of the escape barrier, proportional increases in treatment costs, adverse effects and counterindications make this strategy one of ever compounding challenges that ultimately remains exposed to the core problem of viral resistance. Treatment failure and the continuous need for the development of additional therapies are the realised costs of playing into such 'strengths' of virus evolution. As obligate intracellular parasites, all viruses must subvert key resources of permissive hosts in order to replicate. 8 Subverting multifunctional host proteins can confer significant fitness advantages by enabling RNA viruses to efficiently execute multiple steps in their replication strategy. Over time, these features are likely to be conserved within lineages and serve as foci of evolutionary convergence for viruses with a similar host range, while purifying selection eliminates steps rendered less efficient. Nevertheless, ideal targets of pathogenic viruses include those that are also vital to the host, thereby limiting its options for antiviral adaptation and driving more costly evolutionary innovation on its part. Similarly, the potential for adverse effects limits options for targeting such host proteins therapeutically.",

Nevertheless, this same process that enables remarkable genome plasticity also appears to limit the incorporation of new information with which to achieve more favorable host manipulation. There exists an inverse relationship between viral genome size and mutation rate, with large coronaviruses the only known RNA virus family to possess 3 0 -exonuclease proofreading activity. 16 Thus, the probability of acquiring a lethal mutation increases as a function of both polymerase infidelity and genome size. This suggests lengthening the genome to accommodate a larger repertoire of gene products with which to better manipulate the host comes with considerable fitness trade-offs for RNA viruses. Indeed, excepting extremely small circular ssDNA viruses, RNA virus genomes are typically far shorter than DNA virus genomes in both average size (10.3 vs. 77.8 kb, respectively) and maximal size (51.3 vs. 2474 kb) and encode fewer proteins (1-28 vs. 1-1839; Figure 1 ). As a result, while various RNA viruses tolerate certain gene substitutions (e.g. recombinant reporter strains and segmented genome viruses), 17 most are poorly tolerant of additions of new genetic information. Correspondingly, mutagenic nucleoside analogues exhibit broad-spectrum antiviral activity by increasing the error rate in genome synthesis for nascent viral particles. 18 This effectively reduces the optimal genome length of the virus for productive infection to below the threshold of viability, thereby driving the population to extinction. Therefore, while the core 'strengths' in RNA virus evolution arise because of the nature of their genetic material and its error-prone mode of replication, these appear intractably coupled to limits on the size of information available to subvert their more complex hosts.",

Imbricated dependency on multifunctional host proteins for various key replication steps creates vulnerabilities that may be exploited for highly efficacious antiviral therapies. For example, denying such host proteins to the virus may disrupt multiple key elements in its replication strategy. Where these proteins represent foci of evolutionary convergence, such therapies may yield robust, broad-spectrum antiviral activity. The degree of innovation required to circumvent such a therapy and, especially in the case of RNA viruses, the informational barrier to realising this innovation may be high. Escape mutants that emerge may be forced to overcome multiple deficiencies simultaneously and suffer compounding fitness penalties in the process. Furthermore, host-oriented approaches present a much larger list of potential therapeutic targets than the dozen or so gene products produced by most human-infective RNA viruses, many of which are challenging targets in the first instance because of genetic diversity and intrinsic protein disorder. 19 Given the higher fidelity of DNA versus RNA replication, host therapeutic targets may prove resilient to certain mechanisms of viral resistance. Altogether, these advantages may reduce antiviral development costs over the long term, allowing for greater treatment accessibility and faster development of future therapies.

These proteins appear to serve as key drivers of convergence between diverse human-infective viruses, suggesting these are potential targets of broad-spectrum antivirals.

The non-structural V protein targets the single largest number of highly multitasking human proteins: HSP90a, PABP1, vimentin, hnRNPK and p53 ( Figure 2 ). In addition to V's established roles in suppressing multiple components of host interferon (IFN) signalling, 23 these interactions may allow MV to interface with the cytoskeleton (vimentin) and subvert numerous host cell processes including cell cycle (p53, hnRNPK), protein translation (PABP1), RNA metabolism (PABP1, hnRNPK), and transcription and protein expression (HSP90a). V is produced by editing of the P gene transcript, which also overlaps with the C gene. The largest number of amino acid substitutions between wild-type MV and attenuated vaccine strains occurs within the P/V/C gene region, 24 suggesting changes in this region serve an important basis for natural attenuation. Since attenuated MV strains possess very limited capacity for reversion, 24 MV strains engineered to harbour defects in V binding to these host proteins may be suitable designer vaccine candidates. As discussed in the following sections, re-purposing existing host-targeting bioactive compounds as antivirals may also yield therapeutic results.",

This suggests subversion of the cellular protein quality control pathways or HSP-mediated gene expression is vital in the HIV-1 replication cycle. Accordingly, HSP90 inhibitors 17-AAG/ tanespimycin and AUY922 (Table 2) were recently shown to inhibit HIV-1 transcription and suppress viral rebound in a humanised mouse model. 26 Although these and other HSP90 inhibitors have encountered efficacy and toxicity issues during clinical trials as anticancer therapies, aminoxyrone is novel, first-in-class HSP90 inhibitor that appears to alleviate both issues. 27 Its efficacy as an antiviral or antiretroviral therapeutic has yet to be studied. Inhibitors of HSPB1 and HSP7C (Table 2) represent additional avenues for effective hostoriented antiretroviral therapies that have also yet to be explored. HIV-1 tat (transactivating regulatory protein), which is required for efficient viral gene transcription, 28 targets PABP1, p53 and HAT p300 ( Figure 2 ). The latter protein is further manipulated by two additional HIV-1 proteins, viral protein R (Vpr) and Pol (DNA polymerase), as well as the transactivating regulatory protein (Tax) of human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV; Figure 2 ), plausibly representing a conserved mechanism of host subversion. HATs and histone deacetylases (HDACs) are crucial effectors in epigenetic modulation of gene expression, connecting a large number of cell signalling inputs with transcriptional outputs through histone post-translational modifications. 29 HAT and HDAC inhibitors have been shown to suppress viral transcription ('kill') and re-activate latent virus ('shock-and-kill'), respectively, 30, 31 suggesting epigenetic remodulation of host gene activity is exceptionally important in the replication strategy of HIV-1 and other retroviruses. Alternatively, retroviral proteins may block or usurp the enzymatic activity of HAT p300 to direct acetylation of viral or other host proteins, which has been suggested for Tat. 32 The interactions between HAT p300 and HIV-1 proteins Tat, Vpr and Pol (Figure 2) , together with the large number of HAT p300 inhibitors currently available (Table 2) , expand the possibilities for targeting HAT p300 in host-oriented antiretroviral therapies.",

While viruses often reprogram cellular metabolic pathways, DenV drastically increases the rate of glycolysis to support its own replication. Metabolic acidosis is often associated with severe disease and may correlate with the subcellular redistribution of viral proteins to further compromise host stress responses. 42 Thus, DenV-infected patients who are simultaneously hyperglycaemic (e.g. diabetics) are at greater risk of severe disease. 43 Accordingly, inhibiting glycolysis impairs replication of DenV and other flaviviruses in vitro. 44, 45 In this context, it would be of interest to examine whether alphaenolase inhibitors such as AP-III-a4/ENOblock (Table 2) , which blocks the non-glycolytic functions of alpha-enolase as mentioned previously, may block subversion of this key enzyme by flaviviruses in vivo.",

Despite the cells stably expressing the dlhRNA, together with the combinatorial targeting approach and using virus produced from a single molecular clone, nucleotide escape mutants emerged, integrated and proliferated in as few as 8 days post-infection. 96 Notably, however, viral transcript knockdown was variable and incomplete, thereby creating an environment suitable for escape mutant propagation.

            "text": "Besides safety, a clear limitation is that not all medically relevant viruses use host miRNAs as key elements in their replication strategy. One solution is to engineer such viruses to harbour endogenous miRNA-targeting sequences. This yields recombinant viruses resembling wild-type but with greatly reduced pathogenicity, restricted tissue tropism and impaired replicative fitness, with potential use as vaccines. Using poliovirus (PV), which replicates primarily in the pharynx and gastrointestinal tract but causes severe neurological disease, Barnes et al. first demonstrated that recombinant PV harbouring a complementary sequence of murine brain-specific miR-124a was severely compromised in its ability to replicate within this tissue. When this sequence was substituted for a sequence complementary to the ubiquitously expressed miRNA let-7a, PV replication was further reduced, indicating miRNAs may be used to control tissue tropism. Notably, similar effects were obtained in mice rendered genetically unresponsive to IFN, which nevertheless generated protective antibodies against reinfection by between 10 and 10 000 times the LD 50 of wild-type PV. 98 This approach was recently used by Yee et al. 99 towards developing a live attenuated vaccine for enterovirus 71. Similar results were also obtained by Kelly et al. 100 using Coxsackievirus, where a majority of mice inoculated with recombinant virus harbouring tissue-specific miRNA-targeting sequences showing greatly reduced morbidity and mortality up to 70 days post-infection. Benitez et al. showed that mice inoculated with as much as 2500 times the LD 50 of IAV, also modified to harbour murine miRNAtargeting sequences, remained asymptomatic up to 10 days post-infection. These mice were also IFNunresponsive, confirming that mammals can, in principle, elicit a highly effective RNAi-mediated antiviral response and immunological memory against evolutionary diverse viruses in the absence of IFN-I. 101 Nevertheless, other viruses harbouring similar modifications have shown mixed results. In contrast to their earlier work on Coxsackievirus, Kelly et al. found vesicular stomatitis virus engineered to contain various host miRNA-targeting sequences largely resisted miRNA-mediated restriction. Nevertheless, a decrease in neurotoxicity was observed with miR-125 that also preserved the virus' oncolytic activity, 102 properties that are crucial in cancer immunotherapy applications. DenV was successfully restricted from hematopoietic cells by introducing four miR-142 targeting sites, although the virus quickly reverted and continued proliferating at low levels after excising all four sites. 103 Since there appears to be no clear pattern that might explain these disparate effects between virus species, additional work remains in order to use recombinant miR-targeting viruses for routine therapeutic use.",

However, the basis for attenuation is usually ill-defined. Some species or clinical isolates are not readily amenable to current in vitro culturing methods (e.g. norovirus), 104 which often fail to recapitulate essential elements of the viral replication cycle and pathogenesis.

Additionally, the resulting strain will likely preserve some replicative competence upon inoculation, thereby eliciting stronger immunity in the absence of adjuvants. The challenge remains, however, to identify which parts of the cell or culture methods should be modified to generate broad permissiveness, high titres and greatly reduced virulence simultaneously. Obvious candidates include genes that restrict viral replication but are dispensable for cell survival, such as IFN genes and their signalling components, and potentially certain multifunctional proteins. Taken to its logical conclusion, it should be possible to genetically engineer an immune-null human cell substrate within which to passage virus free of virulence factor targets and immune selective pressure. In this way, the strain that emerges will likely exhibit strong antigenicity but severe degradation in mechanisms of host immune antagonism. Such an approach may also prove useful in the context of viruses that cause severe disease primarily through cytokine hyperactivation.",

Inversely, this same strategy may be used to help guide infection of certain tissues such as oncolytic viruses in the case of cancer immunotherapy. 100 Another safety feature could involve a drug-selective 'kill switch', whereby key viral proteins are fused to the FK506-binding protein 12 destabilisation domain. Viral fusion proteins are 'rescued' from proteasomal degradation in the presence of the drug Shield-1 but efficiently degraded upon its removal, 107 thereby yielding a conditionally replicationincompetent strain.

Despite being intractably limited in informational size, RNA viruses are thorough problem solvers, often subverting multitasking host proteins to achieve favorable host subversion at minimal informational cost. Such solutions to the viral information economy paradox are often conserved, creating opportunities to leverage imbricated multidependency on key host proteins for host-oriented antiviral therapies that are more effective, broad-acting and ultimately more costeffective. Although such proteins can present challenging therapeutic targets, host-oriented therapies will synergise with increased therapeutic drug availability and developments in RNAi, precision medicine and immunotherapy. Additionally, methods of increasing viral antigenicity yet controlling replication and tissue tropism will increase the number of viruses for which safe and highly effective vaccines can be produced. Viruses such as NCLDVs appear to readily acquire new information with which to subvert their hosts. The fruits of problem-solving by such viruses include large numbers of proteins with unique and unknown biological functions. The influence and genetic hallmarks of viruses at both extremes are found in humans and throughout the living biosphere. By expanding the examination of evolutionarily diverse host-virus interactions, disease, cost, environmental and other sustainability issues of our time may be remedied by leveraging, rather than yielding to, the properties of RNA and DNA viruses as developed through co-evolution with their hosts.",
