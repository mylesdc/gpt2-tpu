Viral inclusion formation is essential for viral infection, but how these organelles form is not well understood. We investigated the biogenesis of reovirus inclusions. Correlative light and electron microscopy showed that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes are in contact with nascent inclusions, which form by collections of membranous tubules and vesicles as revealed by electron tomography. ER markers and newly synthesized viral RNA are detected in inclusion internal membranes. Live-cell imaging showed that early in infection, the ER is transformed into thin cisternae that fragment into small tubules and vesicles. We discovered that ER tubulation and vesiculation are mediated by the reovirus NS and NS proteins, respectively. Our results enhance an understanding of how viruses remodel cellular compartments to build functional replication organelles. IMPORTANCE Viruses modify cellular structures to build replication organelles. These organelles serve as sites of viral genome replication and particle morphogenesis and are essential for viral infection. However, how these organelles are constructed is not well understood. We found that the replication organelles of mammalian reoviruses are formed by collections of membranous tubules and vesicles derived from extensive remodeling of the peripheral endoplasmic reticulum (ER). We also observed that ER tubulation and vesiculation are triggered by the reovirus NS and NS proteins, respectively. Our results enhance an understanding of how viruses remodel cellular compartments to build functional replication organelles and provide functions for two enigmatic reovirus replication proteins. Most importantly, this research uncovers a new mechanism by which viruses form factories for particle assembly.",

            "text": "The ER is the largest organelle in eukaryotic cells. The peripheral ER is composed of a single continuous membrane that branches from the nuclear envelope and consists of two main structural domains, flat membrane cisternae (also called sheets) and tubules, which are dynamic structures (6) . ER sheets are covered with ribosomes and support synthesis, translocation, and folding of proteins. Tubules, whose function is less well understood, associate with significantly fewer ribosomes and may be sites for lipid synthesis and communication with other organelles (7) . It is not known how the ER maintains this dynamic network of sheets and tubules, although the process requires contributions from motor proteins, the cytoskeleton, proteins that mediate ER-ER fusion, and membrane-bending proteins (8) . Collectively, ER shape is influenced by a surprisingly small set of proteins (9) . Viruses often interfere with the dynamic organization of the ER. Viruses use ER membranes and ribosomes to protect the viral genome and synthesize viral proteins (10, 11) . Viruses also remodel ER membranes to form a variety of structures, including single-membrane spherule vesicles in the ER lumen (12, 13) , double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) (14, 15) , convoluted membranes (CMs) (16) , and single-membrane sheets (17) . Spherules and DMVs appear to function in viral genome replication, CMs are likely sites of polyprotein synthesis or storage of proteins and lipids, and single-membrane sheets may participate in viral morphogenesis. How viral proteins remodel the ER during viral infection is largely unknown.",

These membranous components remain attached to the remodeled ER to build large replication factories. Remarkably, expression of reovirus proteins NS and NS is sufficient to mediate this dramatic reorganization of the ER. Moreover, we demonstrate that NS causes ER tubulation and NS causes ER fragmentation. Our results enhance an understanding of how the ER is reshaped and transformed by viruses and point to a new process used by viruses to form factories for particle assembly.",

Colocalization of dsRNA with PDI also was observed (Fig. 2E ). To localize viral RNA synthesis relative to VIs, we assessed bromouridine (BrU) incorporation via immunogold labeling of Tokuyasu cryosections (Fig. 2F ). BrU labeling was observed in inclusions associated with viral particles, marking viral RNA that had accumulated during the 5-h labeling window (Fig. 2F ). These particles are viral cores in which genome replication takes place (28, 29) but also likely mature virions, which may retain signal due to the prolonged labeling window. BrU labeling also was associated with membranes inside VIs (Fig. 2F) . Although BrU was maintained in the cell culture medium for 5 h, BrU signal was found only in VIs. A total of 258 labeled structures in VIs from 5 cells were photographed. BrU labeling was Thawed cryosections were processed for immunogold labeling using a rabbit polyclonal anti-PDI antiserum and a secondary antibody bound to 10-nm colloidal gold particles (A and B) or a rabbit polyclonal anti-calreticulin (CLT) antiserum and a secondary antibody bound to 10-nm colloidal gold particles (C and D).

Double labeling with antibodies specific for BrU and the 3 viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which resides in the virion core, showed that inside VIs, both antibodies label viral particles ( Fig. 2G and H) and membrane fragments (Fig. 2G , inset). These results suggest that the ER-derived, tubulovesicular membranes inside VIs support viral replication and assembly. Considering that genome replication of Reoviridae viruses occurs inside viral cores (28, 29) , the significance of membrane fragments labeled with anti-dsRNA or anti-BrU antibodies inside VIs is uncertain. Nonetheless, our findings raise the possibility that reovirus genome segments associate with membranes prior to assortment into viral particles inside VIs.",

Similar findings were obtained using live-cell imaging and confocal microscopy of U-2 OS cells engineered to stably express mCherry-KDEL, transfected with an N-terminal-tagged green fluorescent protein (GFP) construct expressing residues 1 to 230 of the NS protein, and infected with reovirus (Movie S5).

Ultrathin sections were stained and imaged using TEM ( Fig. 5D and S4 ). Gold-silver particles bound to MT revealed the precise location of MT-tagged NS molecules. We observed that prior to VI assembly, mCherry-NS-MT distributes with vesicles near the nucleus where the mCherry fluorescent signal concentrates (Fig. 5D) ; mCherry-NS-MT gold-silver molecules also distributed to thin, strangled ER cisternae where they distribute with near-uniform spacing (Fig. 5E) . Together with the confocal images shown in Fig. 5C , this finding suggests a role for NS in ER fragmentation. Results from gene silencing experiments using either NSor NS-specific small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) in reovirus-infected cells showed only minor ER remodeling. This finding is consistent with the observation that NS expression is diminished following NS silencing and vice versa (Fig. S5) . The ER morphological changes caused by reovirus infection or ectopic expression of NS and NS were quantified microscopically (Fig. 6) . In this analysis, NS causes a thinning of the tubular ER, whereas NS disrupts the branches of the thin tubules and cleaves those structures into small pieces.

By expressing these proteins together or individually in the absence of viral infection, we found that NS transforms the ER into thin tubules, while NS eliminates branches and fragments the tubules into small pieces. Both proteins likely modify the ER simultaneously during infection, with NS inducing tubulation and NS disturbing the three-way junctions to produce unbranched, thin tubules, followed by scission of the tubules into smaller fragments (Fig. 7) . Thinning of the ER by NS may generate tension in the tubules just before fragmentation. Since NS also can mediate formation of thin tubules, the synergistic effect of both proteins in thinning the ER likely facilitates tubule fragmentation by NS. NS and NS could transform the ER by interacting with lipids in ER membranes or interfering with ER-shaping proteins, such as reticulons, Rab GTPases, or lunapark (8) . NS also could target proteins at the three-way junctions such as atlastins (45) . Although confocal and superresolution STED microscopy showed that during infection NS and NS distribute to the ER in abundance, the protein concentration required for the observed ER remodeling need not be large. For example, occupation of as little as 10% of the tubular ER surface by bending proteins can induce pronounced ER curvature in yeast (46) .",

            "text": "Contrary to the currently accepted concept of reovirus inclusions as isolated neoorganelles assembled in the cytoplasm of infected cells, we found that reovirus replication factories are comprised of remodeled peripheral ER with attached VIs as active domains formed by clusters of ER-derived vesicles and tubules. Our work uncovers a new mechanism by which viruses form neo-organelles for particle assembly and a new type of virus-induced ER remodeling. The large membrane surface generated by ER fragmentation would provide an adequate shelter for reovirus replication complexes, which are protected inside viral cores (18, 47) , as well as the reovirus translation machinery (21) . We hypothesize that (i) viral cores actively replicating the genome are bound to membranous tubules, (ii) newly synthesized viral RNAs exit the cores and attach to these membranes via specific interactions with viral proteins, and (iii) assembly of the inner core and outer capsid to build progeny viral particles occurs around vRNPs anchored to these sites (Fig. 7) . High-resolution studies showing the precise localization and movement of molecules inside VIs will be required to understand how viral genome replication and particle assembly are coupled inside the VIs.",

Cells with interesting features were selected using a Leica TCS SP5 confocal microscope and fixed with a mixture of 4% PFA and 0.1% glutaraldehyde in PBS. After fixation and dehydration with ethanol, cells were embedded in EML-812. Resin-embedded cell monolayers were separated from grid plates by immersion in liquid nitrogen and warm water. Preselected cells were localized in the first ultrathin sections that were collected on Formvar-coated 50-GP copper slot grids and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Three independent CLEM experiments were conducted. A total of 17 areas were selected by confocal microscopy, and three were processed for embedding in epoxy resin and ultramicrotomy. Nine cells were processed by oriented serial sectioning and studied by TEM.",
