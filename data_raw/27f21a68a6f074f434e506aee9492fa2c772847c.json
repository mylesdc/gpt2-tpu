            "text": "Background: Infectious bronchitis (IB) caused by the IB virus (IBV) can cause acute damage to chickens around the world. Therefore, rapid diagnosis and immune status determination are critical for controlling IBV outbreaks. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) have been widely used in the detection of IBV antibodies in the early infection and continuous infection of IB because they are more sensitive and quicker than other diagnostic methods. Results: We have developed two indirect microarray methods to detect antibodies against IBV: a chemiluminescent immunoassay test (CIT) and a rapid diagnostic test (RDT). IBV nonstructural protein 5 (nsp5) was expressed, purified from Escherichia coli, and used to spot the initiator integrated poly(dimethylsiloxane), which can provide a near \"zero\" background for serological assays. Compared with the IDEXX IBV Ab Test kit, CIT and RDT have a sensitivity and specificity of at least 98.88% and 91.67%, respectively. No cross-reaction was detected with antibodies against avian influenza virus subtypes (H5, H7, and H9), Newcastle disease virus, Marek's disease virus, infectious bursal disease virus, and chicken anemia virus. The coefficients of variation of the reproducibility of the intra-and inter-assays for CIT ranged from 0.8 to 18.63%. The reproducibility of RDT was consistent with the original results. The application of the IBV nsp5 protein microarray showed that the positive rate of the CIT was 96.77%, that of the nsp5 ELISA was 91.40%, and that of the RDT was 90.32%. Furthermore, the RDT, which was visible to the naked eye, could be completed within 15 min. Our results indicated that compared with nsp5 ELISA, the CIT was more sensitive, and the RDT had similar positive rates but was faster. Furthermore, the two proposed methods were specific and stable.",

The IBV genome is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA that is 27.6 kb in size [2] . It encodes four major structural proteins, namely, glycosylated spike protein (S), membrane protein (M), phosphorylated nucleoprotein (N), and envelope protein (E) [3] , and 15 nonstructural proteins (nsp2-nsp16). Generally, nonstructural proteins are present in infected cells but not in the virus, and they only play a role in the process of virus infection and replication [4] . Chickens immunized with an inactivated vaccine will produce no antibodies or low levels of antibodies against viral nonstructural proteins. Thus, nonstructural proteins have the potential application in differentiating natural infection from inactivated vaccine immunity [5] .",

The immunogenicity of the coating antigen is one of the crucial factors when performing an ELISA test for antibody detection. An inactivated whole virus is the most commonly used coating antigen in commercial diagnosis kits for IBV diagnosis. Recombinant antigenic protein expressed using prokaryotic, yeast, or baculovirus systems has been widely used in preparing specific coating antigens for ELISA kits [10] [11] [12] [13] . ELISAs based on purified recombinant protein may have higher specificity and sensitivity as the target antigen is immune-dominant and devoid of any nonspecific immune responses [14] . ELISAs based on whole virus particles as well as recombinant S1 (spike protein 1 subunit) and N proteins (nucleoproteins) can provide a rapid and large-scale detection method for IBV infection. However, few IBV detection methods have been developed based on nonstructural proteins (nsps). Our laboratory has established an nsp5 ELISA to detect IBV infection [4] . The nsp5 antibodies detected are likely to be non-neutralizing and exist in lower numbers than the ones generated by other proteins. Based on previous studies, we developed a rapid, highly sensitive protein microarray and a visible detection method to detect IBV nsp5 antibodies for epidemiological investigation and antibody level monitoring.",

However, the preparation of purified virions for use as an antigen is time-consuming and expensive. In the present study, recombinant nonstructural proteins expressed in Escherichia coli antigen-based protein microarray was evaluated for the first time in the serological diagnosis of IB [4] . Protein microarrays have high sensitivity and good reproducibility in quantitative and qualitative assays, and they are a valuable asset when analyzing complex biological samples [16] . In clinical sample testing, many factors, including time, cost, accuracy, sensitivity, and throughput, determine the performance and usefulness of an immunoassay. In this study, a new solidly supported material, iPDMS membrane, which has a near \"zero\" background for identification, was used. It achieved high sensitivity in detecting antibodies in serum [17] . These unique features of iPDMS not only simplify data analysis but also reduce nonspecific interactions [18] . ELISA detection has been widely used in the detection of IBV antibodies in early infection and continuous infection of IB and vaccine-immune, and no diagnosis method is more sensitive and quicker than ELISA. In this study, two microarray methods (CIT and RDT) were established. Except for the method of the observation, the reaction processes of the two methods are akin to the detection process of ELISA. However, unlike ELISA, the established methods only require 2 ng of antigen coating on each spot, and the amount of HRP-IgG required for each reaction well is only 5 ng. The antigen and HRP-IgG used in both methods were less than those used in ELISA, thereby reducing the cost of detection. In addition, the CIT can detect antibodies against IBV nsp5 quantitatively and is more sensitive than the IBV nsp5 ELISA kit. The RDT was developed to detect antibodies against IBV visually, and the results can be obtained within 15 min with great sensitivity and specificity. Compared with ELISA, RDT has a shorter detection time and better detection efficiency. In this study, we only used one antigen of IBV for testing and verification. In the future, we will apply antigens of different diseases to iPDMS to achieve high-throughput test results.",

Antibodies against several diseases can be detected from only a single serum, and this factor is especially important for clinical research, which uses precious samples from rare and wild animals. Substrate selection and surface modification, as well as new substrate research and development, have become major research foci in the field of protein chips. Our present work indicates that iPDMS can provide a matrix for the detection of antibodies in chicken serum. In addition, the high sensitivity and specificity of protein microarrays render them powerful tools in disease detection",
