A 2015 meta-analysis of the global burden of childhood pneumonia found the greatest proportion (39%) of severe pneumonia cases occurred in Southeast Asia [6] . However, because Streptoccocus pneumoniae is the most common cause of vaccine-preventable severe pneumonia, much of the literature has focused on bacterial causes of pneumonia or antibiotic resistance, whereas fewer studies have prospectively investigated the viral etiology of pneumonia in Southeast Asia [7] [8] [9] . One study of respiratory samples collected from children living in Kuala Lumpur under 5 years of age between 1982 and 2008 found that 26.4% of the samples were positive by immunofluorescence assays and viral cultures for viral pathogens, with a prevalence of 18.6% for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), 3.5% for parainfluenza viruses (PIVs), 2.9% for influenza viruses, and 1.37% for adenovirus [10] .",

Our Previous studies have investigated the relationship between relative humidity or absolute humidity and influenza virus transmission, suggesting that increased levels of humidity are linked with decreased transmission efficiency; however, the prevalence of IAV in Sibu and Kapit Hospitals suggest the high humidity associated with the equatorial climate in this region may not constrain IAV transmission [15, 16] . Our findings regarding the prevalence of RSV support the existing literature that the 2 antigenic subgroups A and B can cocirculate but typically differ by season [17] .

After the first 2 months of study, patients were supposedly recruited on 2 randomly selected days of the week; however, we cannot eliminate the possibility that MOs selected the sicker patients in the ward for this study. In addition, this study was limited to hospitalized patients and therefore excluded milder cases of pneumonia not requiring hospitalization. Although we used rigorously validated real-time PCR assays as the gold standard for virus detection, the study was limited to a panel of 13 viruses and we therefore likely missed other important pathogens present in specimens, including human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus, and bacteria. Specifically, this study would benefit from an understanding of the prevalence of bacterial mono-or coinfections within the patient population. This study provides data on 1 year of pneumonia admissions at 2 district government hospitals in Sarawak, Malaysia; however, prevalence of the viruses investigated can vary between years.",
