Our results demonstrate a sharp improvement of call rate and accuracy when using RASs as compared to extant sequences.

Extension of this novel microarray design strategy to viruses, antimicrobial resistance elements or toxins is straightforward.",

The 2003 SARS epidemic, with a novel coronavirus variant diffusing widely while its biological identity was still unknown, is a paradigm that illustrates two essential requirements of biothreat preparedness: the ability to identify yet unknown agents, and to do it rapidly. The threat of deliberate release of infectious agents in areas where they are not generally encountered, or the natural evolution of novel combinations of genetic material, exemplified by the H1N1 2009 pandemic variant [1] , further stress the need for rapid identification of unexpected agents. Efficient identification platforms must also cope with the large diversity of pathogens and the need to differentiate them from closely related non-pathogenic species [2] .",

One strategy relies on the amplification and sequencing of conserved target genes, such as bacterial 16S rRNA genes or viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase genes. Even though broad range primers are used with success in many diagnostic and discovery applications, these approaches are limited in their phylogenetic span, fail to identify species with incompatible sequence variation in priming sites, and do not detect genetic reassortants. High throughput sequencing platforms offer a novel and powerful approach for identifying known or yet unknown pathogenic organisms [3] , but the current time to results may still represent a limitation in the event of a public health emergency.",

One interesting feature of resequencing microarrays is the possibility to detect nucleic acids in a sample, even if their sequence diverges by up to 10-15% from those that are represented on the array [10, 11] . Therefore, even if a novel emerging agent would differ markedly from all known sequences, as was the case for the novel 2003 coronavirus [14, 15] , it could be possible to detect it with precision. However, in face of the huge diversity of the microbial world [16, 17] , there is a clear need to improve phylogenetic coverage by microarrays. In addition, both accuracy and sensitivity are expected to decrease with increasing levels of sequence mismatch between the microbial agent present in the sample and those represented on the microarray. Given that chip size and density are finite, the number of sequences that one array is able to detect must be increased by optimization of the covered sequence space. One solution is to tile sequences separated by an optimal phylogenetic distance (e.g. 5%). Yet another improvement could consist of reducing the expected divergence between tiled sequences and the sequence of pathogens to be detected.",

This property was recognized long ago, e.g., [18] , and can be exploited in several applications including as seeds in BLAST homology searches [19] , protein family discovery and functional predictions [20, 21, 22] . Simulation studies have shown that given a phylogenetic tree and an unbiased phylogenetically representative set of extant homologous sequences, ancestral sequences can be inferred with high accuracy provided that evolutionary rate heterogeneity among sites and lineages is incorporated in the evolutionary models [18, 19, 22, 23, 24] .",

To quantify this beneficial effect of RASs, we reconstructed ancestral sequences at all nodes of the phylogeny obtained for 169 rpoB sequences. We then calculated the number of required RASs to achieve full coverage of extant sequences at divergence levels of 5, 10 and 15%; that is, when each extant sequence diverges by less than the chosen threshold from at least one ancestral sequence (Fig. 4) . To cover all Enterobacteriaceae species with a maximum of 5% divergence, only 53 ancestral sequences are required, while it would be necessary to tile 69 extant sequences. Thus, an economy of 23% oligonucleotide probes required on the array would be achieved. At this divergence level, while 14 sequences of extant species would cover 100 Enterobacteriaceae species, 14 RASs would cover 120 Enterobacteriaceae species. Likewise, at the 10% divergence threshold, the single extant sequence with the highest coverage would cover 73 species, whereas the single RAS with the best coverage would cover 108 species (a 48% increase).

This property has allowed detection of emerging strains of pathogens that were not tiled on the array [2, 29, 30 ]. In addition, as a unique tiled sequence can serve for resequencing several closely related pathogens, this property mitigates an important limitation of microarrays, namely the finite number of probes it can contain. However, we observed a linear decay of call rate and accuracy as a function of sequence Reconstructed ancestral sequences and extant strains that were tiled (blue circles) and strains that were hybridized onto the array (red squares) are indicated. Although genera Pantoea and Erwinia were grouped into a single clade when using the 169 rpoB sequences used for inferring ancestral sequences, the Pantoea/Erwinia clade is not recovered when using this restricted dataset, and the ancestral node was represented with dotted lines connecting the Pantoea and Erwinia branches. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0015243.g002 divergence, as recently reported for Rhabdoviruses [11] , showing that the quality of the signal is dependent on the nature of the sequences incorporated in the microarray design. Even though sequences obtained with tiled sequences that diverge by up to 10-15% still contain useful nucleotide information, it is important for the accuracy of the results that the tiled sequences diverge minimally from the sequences potentially present in the sample. Our results provide a clear demonstration that the use of RASs improves very significantly both the call rate and the accuracy, as expected given the dependency of these parameters on sequence divergence. Further, pathogens that are too divergent (beyond 15-25%), including potential novel emerging pathogens, might be missed by tiled extant sequences but detected when using ancestral sequences. We also reasoned that it should be possible to increase the coverage of extant pathogens by using RASs, while reducing the number of required probes for a desired coverage level. Our results show that the use of RASs would allow minimizing by approximately 25% the number of sequences that need to be tiled on the microarray to cover at 5% divergence, the entire diversity of the taxonomic family Enterobacteriaceae. Although the gain provided by ancestral sequences will vary depending on the phylogenetic structure of the group considered, this value show that the use of RASs can broaden significantly the sequence space around the sequences tiled on a microarray.",

Reconstruction of ancestral sequences can in principle be achieved for any set of homologous sequences, including for example viral polymerase sequences. In addition, insertion/deletions among extant sequences can also be incorporated in ancestral sequence reconstructions [24] . However, the accuracy of ancestral sequences is strongly affected by evolutionary phenomena such as homologous recombination and highly heterogeneous evolutionary rate among sites or lineages [19] . This may in particular restrict applicability to 16S rRNA, given the extreme among-sites rate heterogeneity of this gene, as shown in Enterobacteriaceae [31] . Accuracy of ancestral sequence reconstruction is also dependent on a good estimation of the tree topology and branch lengths [18] . In the case of our rpoB dataset, these parameters were not strongly affected by the tree inference method (not shown). Besides maximum likelihood, other methods, including maximum parsimony, distance and Bayesian methods, are available for ancestral sequence reconstruction [18, 19, 22, 23, 32] . Although it was not the purpose of this work, it could be important to evaluate their relative accuracies, which may vary depending on the specific properties of the set of extant sequences considered [19, 22] .",

The use of RAS improved the two major parameters of microarrray resequencing, call rate and sequence accuracy, which have a major influence on the subsequent processes of identification of novel sequences, such as BLAST searches in sequence databases or confirmatory experiments based on targeted nucleic acid amplification. Therefore, the use of ancestral sequences should be regarded as an important strategy to improve the design of microarrays aimed at identification of pathogens of public health importance.",

This process was reiterated for all ancestral sequences by decreasing order of covered extant sequences. The same process was performed using 10% and 15% thresholds.
