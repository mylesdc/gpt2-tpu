Methods: By searching multiple databases and sources, including PubMed, Cochrane, and Embase database, by the index words updated in December 2017, qualified studies were identified and relevant literature sources were also searched. The qualified studies included prospective cohort studies and cross-sectional studies. Heterogeneity of the included studies were reviewed to select proper effect model for pooled weighted sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR). Summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) analyses were performed for meniscal tears. Results: Forty-three studies related to diagnostic accuracy of MRI to detect early osteonecrosis of the femoral head were involved in the meta-analysis. The global sensitivity and specificity of MRI in early osteonecrosis of the femoral head were 93.0% (95% CI 92.0-94.0%) and 91.0% (95% CI 89.0%-93.0%), respectively. The global positive likelihood ratio and global negative likelihood ratio of MRI in early osteonecrosis of the femoral head were 2.74 (95% CI 1.98-3.79) and 0.18 (95% CI 0.14-0.23), respectively. The global DOR was 27.27 (95% CI 17.02-43.67), and the area under the SROC was 93.38% (95% CI 90.87%-95.89%). Conclusions: This review provides a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of MRI in early osteonecrosis of the femoral head. Moderate to strong evidence indicated that MRI appears to be significantly associated with higher diagnostic accuracy for early osteonecrosis of the femoral head.",

            "text": "Avascular Necrosis of Femur Head (ANFH), or osteonecrosis of the femoral head, is a pathologic process, which was first seen in the weight-bearing area of the femur. The stress can lead to bone trabecular structure injury (microfracture) and influence the repair process of the femur, and if not managed timely, it leads to the collapse and deformation of the femur. With many etiological factors, ANFH results from interruption of blood supply to the bone and then leads to ischemic necrosis. ANFH can be divided in traumatic ANFH and non-traumatic ANFH with the non-traumatic ANFH further dividing into steroid-induced and alcoholic non-traumatic ANFH and so on. The timely treatment of early ANFH could promote the recovery the disease. However, in the late stage, it results in femur collapse, loss of hip function, and a very poor outcome that affects the quality of life. Therefore, the early diagnosis of ANFH is of great significance [1] [2] [3] .",

A 2 \u00d7 2 contingency table was constructed for each selected study; the results corresponding to the gold standard and MRI were selected as positive or negative. The data included true positive (TP), false positive (FP), false negative (FN), and true negative (TN). In studies in which one single cell in the 2 \u00d7 2 contingency table had a value of 0, 0.5 were added to all of the cells for calculation. Sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratio were calculated respectively, and the diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) was used as the measure of diagnostic accuracy. A DOR value of 1 indicates a test without discriminatory power, and the higher the DOR value is, the greater the degree of relevance of the assessed diagnostic test.

Chi-squared and I 2 tests were used to assess the heterogeneity of clinical trial results and determine the analysis model (fixed-effects model or random-effects model). When the chi-squared test P value was \u2264 0.05 and I 2 test value was > 50%, it was defined as high heterogeneity and assessed by random-effects model. When the chi-squared test P value was > 0.05 and I 2 tests value was \u2264 50%, it was defined as acceptable heterogeneity data and assessed by fixed-effects model. For further assessment of heterogeneity, diagnostic threshold analysis was performed based on the correlation (Spearman's) between the logit of sensitivity and the logit of [1-specificity] . When a threshold effect occurs, the sensitivity and specificity of the investigated study exhibits negative correlation (or a positive correlation between sensitivity and [1-specificity]). Therefore, a strong positive correlation between sensitivity and [1-specificity] suggests the presence of a threshold effect. When heterogeneity caused by threshold effect was observed, a summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curve was plotted. This method was appropriate given that the global sensitivity and specificity values were overestimated. In such cases, analysis of the ROC panel points, as well as analysis of the SROC curve, was recommended. Deeks' Funnel Asymmetry Plot was used to identify the publication bias.",

[52] , who included 21 articles, reported that MRI was more effective than CT in diagnosing ANFH. Significant statistical difference was identified between them (OR, 0.13; 95% CI 0.03-0.51). Su et al. [53] , who included 8 studies of 515 patients, found the ANFH positive rate between CT and MRI was statistically significant (OR, 0.12; 95% CI 0.04-0.33), so as the early stage positive rate (OR, 0.45; 95% CI 0.26-0.78). Therefore, MRI appears to be a promising diagnostic tool for avascular necrosis of the femoral head.",
