            "text": "Background: Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) are one of the main causes of morbidity and mortality in children. Viruses are the main etiological agents, and their behavior tends to be seasonal and vary by geographical location. Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) has recently been described as a cause of severe acute respiratory infection and its prevalence and clinical behavior in children at moderate altitudes is unknown. Methods: A cross-sectional study was carried out on patients seen at a university hospital in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia between October 2015 and December 2017 in a city at a moderate altitude above sea level. Children with acute respiratory infections who had had a multiplex RT-PCR assay were selected. The prevalence of HMPV infection, its clinical outcomes and its relationship to rainfall were evaluated. Results: Out of a total of 14,760 discharged patients, multiplex RT-PCR was performed on 502 and a virus was detected in 420 children with acute respiratory infection (ARI). The study group had a median age of 21 months (IQR 7-60), with similar proportion of males and females (56.4 and 43.6% respectively) and 5.2% (CI 95 3.3-7.8%) prevalence of HMPV infection. The group with HMPV infection showed a greater frequency of viral coinfection (22.7% vs 14% P = 0.03) compared with ARI caused by other viruses. The rate of bacterial coinfection (P = 0.31), presence of comorbidities (p = 0.75), length of hospital stay (P = 0.42), need for mechanical ventilation (P = 0.75) and mortality (P = 0.22) were similar for HMPV and other viral infections. A moderate correlation was established between HMPV infection and rainfall peaks (Spearman's Rho 0.44 p = 0.02). Conclusions: Human metapneumovirus was the fifth most frequently isolated virus in children with ARI, had similar clinical behavior and severity to other viruses but a higher rate of viral coinfection. Its peaks seem to correlate to rainy seasons.",

It is estimated that children under 5 years of age have an average of three to six episodes of ARI per year, with ARI being the second cause of death in this age group according to the World Health Organization (WHO) [1] . Viruses are the most commonly isolated microorganisms in acute respiratory infection, both in adults and in children. Every year in the United States, between 20,000 to 58,000 children under 5 years of age are hospitalized due to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza virus infections [2] . Discovered in 2001 by Dr. Van Den Hoogen, human metapneumovirus (HMPV), belonging to the Paramyxoviridae family, has circulated for more than five decades [3] , but its importance as an etiologic agent of upper and lower ARI, with the potential for developing severe disease is emergent.",

It has been found that the percentage of annual HMPV infection may vary year to year, and may oscillate between 2.3 and 19.9% in the same region [12, 23] . The annual prevalence difference in our study was 4.4% in 2016 and 5.6% in 2017. A greater frequency was noted in April-May 2016, April-June and September-October 2017, with a low positive correlation between HMPV infection and the highest rainfall peaks (r = 0.44, P < 0.02).",

Four different HMPV lineages are known, designated as A1, A2, B1 and B2. These may coexist in the same period or one may be predominant [25] . The respiratory RT-PCR used in this study does not allow for serotype differentiation, and therefore no conclusion can be drawn regarding their differential behavior. Our study has several limitations. The findings are from a single tertiary care center, and although multiplex RT-PCR was used, it was not performed on all hospitalized patients with acute respiratory infections due limitations of health system. Likewise, this test does not identify serotypes (A1, A2, B1, B2) which could partially explain some different seasonal behaviors of the virus. Similarly, the study design allowed us to observe the behavior of the virus over a specific time period; this behavior may change according to serotypes and environmental variations, among others. Additionally, our data only represents association because we cannot infer that HMPV was the only causal factor of the observed disease, especially in cases with viral coinfection.",
