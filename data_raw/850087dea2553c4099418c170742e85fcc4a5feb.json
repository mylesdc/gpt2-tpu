            "text": "When pathogens become airborne, they travel associated with particles of different size and composition. Particle size determines the distance across which pathogens can be transported, as well as the site of deposition and the survivability of the pathogen. Despite the importance of this information, the size distribution of particles bearing viruses emitted by infectious animals remains unknown. In this study we characterized the concentration and size distribution of inhalable particles that transport influenza A virus (IAV), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) generated by acutely infected pigs and assessed virus viability for each particle size range. Aerosols from experimentally infected pigs were sampled for 24 days using an Andersen cascade impactor able to separate particles by size (ranging from 0.4 to 10 micrometer (\u03bcm) in diameter). Air samples collected for the first 9, 20 and the last 3 days of the study were analyzed for IAV, PRRSV and PEDV, respectively, using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and quantified as geometric mean copies/m 3 within each size range. IAV was detected in all particle size ranges in quantities ranging from 5.5x10 2 (in particles ranging from 1.1 to 2.1\u03bcm) to 4.3x10 5 RNA copies/ m 3 in the largest particles (9.0-10.0\u03bcm). PRRSV was detected in all size ranges except particles between 0.7 and 2.1\u03bcm in quantities ranging from 6x10 2 (0.4-0.7\u03bcm) to 5.1x10 4 RNA copies/m 3 (9.0-10.0\u03bcm). PEDV, an enteric virus, was detected in all particle sizes and in higher quantities than IAV and PRRSV (p < 0.0001) ranging from 1.3x10 6 (0.4-0.7\u03bcm) to 3.5x10 8 RNA copies/m 3 (9.0-10.0\u03bcm). Infectious status was demonstrated for the 3 viruses, and in the case of IAV and PRRSV, viruses were isolated from particles larger than 2.1\u03bcm. In summary, our results indicated that airborne PEDV, IAV and PRRSV can be found in a wide range of particle sizes. However, virus viability is particle size dependent. Fig 3.",

In the case of pigs affected by Aujeszky's disease virus (ADV), particle size distribution varied based on days of infection [13] . Specifically for IAV, no information was found for animals raised in agricultural environments, and the information is limited to animal models using ferrets or guinea pigs that assess the risk of IAV airborne transmission to people [14] [15] [16] .

Porcine reproductive respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is a systemic virus that can be shed in many body secretions [21] , is exhaled in air, and has been detected in air as far as 9.1 km from swine herds [22] . Lastly, PEDV, an emerging virus in North America [23] , is an enteric virus that primarily replicates in large quantities in the small intestine, is largely concentrated in feces of diarrheic pigs and can replicate in alveolar macrophages [24] .

The room has a total air space of 35.1 m 3 and the air entering the isolation room was filtered. Relative humidity and temperature were monitored continually using a data logger (ThermaData Logger-Model HTD, ThermoWorks, Lindon, UT, US). A group of twelve, 5-week-old pigs were purchased from a herd that tested negative for IAV, PRRSV, PEDV and Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae on routine serologic and antigenic testing. The negative status of the experimental pigs was confirmed prior to inoculation. Serum samples were tested for IAV and PRRSV via enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) (IDEXX AI Ab Test and Herd-Chek X3 ELISA, IDEXX, ME, US) [25, 26] . Nasal swabs and rectal swabs were tested for IAV and PEDV respectively using real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) [17, 27] . Microchips were subcutaneously implanted to record body temperature following manufacturer specifications (LifeChip, Destron Fearing, MN, US). Pigs were housed in solid floors without bedding and fed once a day on the floor. Water was provided ad libitum.",

Furthermore, because virus isolation is typically unsuccessful for North American variants of PEDV, a bioassay was performed by inoculating three susceptible piglets with air samples that tested PEDV RT-PCR positive. Briefly, four 10-day-old pigs from a PEDV-negative farm were purchased and each pig allocated to a separate isolation room. Each pig was intra-gastrically inoculated as described earlier in methods with PBS only (negative control) or 2 ml of pooled air samples containing the collection media of the cyclonic air collector diluted 1:10 with PBS to obtain a total of 20 ml of inoculation material per pig.

However, virus viability was particle size dependent with IAV and PRRSV isolated only from particles larger than 2.1 \u03bcm. PEDV, primarily an enteric virus, was found in larger concentrations than PRRSV and IAV while suspended in the air. Our results support the relevance of the aerosol route in the transmission of IAV, PRRS and PED viruses. Viruses transmit differently based on the routes of excretion and ports of entry in susceptible hosts. The viruses investigated in this study have been shown to be infectious while found airborne [17, 29, 38] . Our study indicated that virus-associated particles disperse simultaneously across a wide range of particle sizes. This is important because it shows that viruses in airborne particles emitted or generated by animals can be transmitted simultaneously across both short and long distances. Although various conditions, including environmental temperature and relative humidity can affect the size distribution of aerosols, the findings from this study are relevant given that the viruses were emitted by pigs housed under environmental conditions similar to those found in environments where pigs and people interact.",

Viability of PEDV based on particle size could not be assessed because of the lack of protocols to grow PEDV in cell culture at the time of the study, although viability in air samples was confirmed by bioassay. The association of increasing virus infectivity and concentration, with increasing particle size, has been reported before, and it has been shown to follow a power law relationship greater than 3 [4] . The bigger the particle, the higher the probability that it will carry virus and be infectious. In this study, viability was only shown for PRRSV and IAV in particles bigger than 2.1 \u03bcm in diameter, indicating that measures should be considered to mitigate transmission across both short and long distances.",

Infectious particles sized less than 10 \u03bcm tend to have more serious health implications as they are able to penetrate into the lower respiratory tract to establish infection, and in the case of enteric viruses they may deposit in the upper respiratory tract (i.e. tonsils) or the enteric tract by inhalation.",

In this case, we speculate that both, the quantity of PEDV shed per gram of feces in acutely infected pigs, as well as the volume of liquid found in the diarrheic material may explain the higher quantities of RNA copies of PEDV compared to IAV or PRRSV. Furthermore, comprehensive personal protective equipment including respiratory protection should be considered for potential exposures to both respiratory and enteric viruses, in particular in settings where animals and people interact.
