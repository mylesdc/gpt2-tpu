            "text": "Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is an emerging virus that causes severe disease with fatal outcomes; however, there are currently no approved vaccines or specific treatments against MERS-CoV. Here, we developed a novel bivalent vaccine against MERS-CoV and rabies virus (RV) using the replication-incompetent P-genedeficient RV (RV\u0394P), which has been previously established as a promising and safe viral vector. MERS-CoV spike glycoprotein comprises S1 and S2 subunits, with the S1 subunit being a primary target of neutralizing antibodies. Recombinant RV\u0394P, which expresses S1 fused with transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains together with 14 amino acids from the ectodomains of the RV-glycoprotein (RV-G), was developed using a reverse genetics method and named RV\u0394P-MERS/S1. Following generation of RV\u0394P-MERS/S1 and RV\u0394P, our analysis revealed that they shared similar growth properties, with the expression of S1 in RV\u0394P-MERS/S1-infected cells confirmed by immunofluorescence and western blot, and the immunogenicity and pathogenicity evaluated using mouse infection experiments. We observed no rabies-associated signs or symptoms in mice inoculated with RV\u0394P-MERS/ S1. Moreover, virus-specific neutralizing antibodies against both MERS-CoV and RV were induced in mice inoculated intraperitoneally with RV\u0394P-MERS/S1. These findings indicate that RV\u0394P-MERS/S1 is a promising and safe bivalent-vaccine candidate against both MERS-CoV and RV.",

In this study, we developed a bivalent-vaccine candidate against MERS-CoV and RV using RV\u0394P as a vector and evaluated the induction of a humoral immune response to MERS-CoV and RV, as well as its safety profile. Generation of RV\u0394P expressing the MERS-CoV S1 spike glycoprotein MERS-CoV spike glycoprotein comprises S1 and S2 subunit regions, with the S1 subunit a primary target of VNAs. The S protein was cleaved into the S1 and S2 subunits by various host proteases [2] . To express the S1 protein efficiently on the membrane of the virion, RV-G transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains were fused with the S1 protein. cDNA encoding the RV-G transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains together with 14 amino acids of the ectodomain of RV-G (RV/TMCD) was amplified with primers harboring BsiWI and PstI restriction enzyme sites at the 5 0 ends, followed by cloning of the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). The RV/TMCD fragment was digested and inserted into the BsiWI and PstI site of plasmid p3.1-defP [26], resulting in p5.1-defP-RV/TMCD. The cDNA region corresponding to amino acids 1 through 751 of the codon-optimized S glycoprotein (Sino Biological, Beijing, China) of MERS-CoV EMC/2012 (accession number: AFS88936.1) was amplified and inserted into plasmid p5.1-defP-RV/TMCD using the In-Fusion HD cloning kit (Takara Bio, Shiga, Japan) to produce p5.1-defP-MERS/S1-RV/TMCD (Fig 1) .",

These results suggest that a MERS-CoV S1-protein-expressing RV\u0394P-based vector system is a potential immunogen for MERS-CoV, as well as RV. Additionally, this RV\u0394P-MERS/S1 vaccine candidate did not kill suckling mice, even when inoculated intracerebrally, thereby exhibiting a complete safety profile according to in vivo assays. Several vaccine platforms against MERS-CoV display immunogenicity, efficacy, and safety in animal experiments [6, 47, 48] . Of these vaccine platforms, the recombinant viral vector is considered among the most promising. To date, viral vectors utilizing modified vaccinia virus Ankara, measles virus, or adenovirus have been used to express MERS-CoV glycoprotein and shown to be immunogenic according to in vivo assays [49] [50] [51] [52] . In addition to these recombinant viral vectors, RV vectors are also promising. Recombinant RVs expressing various foreign antigens elicit protective immunity against corresponding pathogens, such as MERS-CoV [15] human immunodeficiency virus type 1 [30], Ebola virus [53] , severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV [31], and hepatitis C virus [54] .",

In the present study, RV\u0394P-MERS/S1 induced neutralizing activity against MERS-CoV in mice inoculated with RV\u0394P-MERS/S1. The induction of protective immunity in mice against MERS-CoV infection following immunization with RV\u0394P-MERS/S1 suggests its potential efficacy in other mammals, including humans. To evaluate the efficacy of vaccines developed against MERS-CoV, various experimental animals ranging from small animals to nonhuman primates have been used for challenge tests [56] . The present study investigated the antibodyinducing capacity of RV\u0394P-MERS/S1 in mice; however, further animal-challenge tests are required to evaluate whether RV\u0394P-MERS/S1 can induce protective immunity against MERS-CoV. The WHO-mandated VNA level against RV of 0.5 IU/mL is widely used as an indication of adequate vaccination [57] . In the present study, RV\u0394P-MERS/S1 induced significantly hightiter VNAs against RV.

In this respect, our replication-deficient recombinant RV-based vector (RV\u0394P) is highly advantageous, given that RV\u0394P-vector vaccines are completely non-pathogenic in animals due to the inability of RV\u0394P to replicate in infected hosts [26, 29] . Moreover, RV\u0394P-MERS/S1 vaccination did not cause disease in suckling mice, suggesting the safety of this vaccine candidate. Deletion of the gene encoding the P protein from the genome of RV\u0394P-MERS/S1 precluded the possibility of reversion to a virulent virus [22] , with this characteristic of the replication-deficient vaccine candidate promoting its efficacy for use as a live vaccine. A previous study reported the avirulence of a replication-deficient RV virus expressing Ebola virus glycoprotein according to the survival of all adult and suckling mice intracerebrally inoculated with the virus along with maintenance of intact brain architecture [58] . By contrast, a replication-competent Ebola virus glycoprotein-expressing RV vaccine recovered from the SAD B19 RV wildlife vaccine strain and harboring an attenuating point mutation retained its neurovirulence in suckling mice when administered intracerebrally [58, 59] .",

            "text": "In this study, MERS-CoV S1 subunit expressed by RV\u0394P-MERS/S1 was constructed to be translated together with the RV-G transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains and 14 amino acids of the ectodomain of RV-G. There were several reasons to use this construct. First, because of the weak capacity for transcription and replication of the P-deficient RV vector in cells, it was expected that the full-length S gene (~4 kb) was too long to express using the RV\u0394P vector. In fact, we found that a recombinant virus containing the S gene of MERS-CoV with the deletion of C-terminal 16 amino acids was rescued but did not express the S1 protein with the variable deletion of S1 gene in the genome (S1 Fig), presumably suggesting that this fragment was too large to be inserted into the RV\u0394P vector. Second, the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of RV-G were fused with the S1 protein, because these regions play an important role in the expression of foreign proteins on the surface of virions [60] . Interestingly, there appears to be a loss of S1 protein after purification with sucrose gradient compared with that of PEG-precipitated viruses (Fig 3b) ; nevertheless, S1 was fused with transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of RV for surface expression. Presumably, the specific S1 protein might be produced in the cell line, but it might be incorporated onto the surface partially because the original RV-G protein would be easier to incorporate into the virions and be more dominant than the foreign proteins. Finally, insertion of the S1 subunit is reportedly more effective than insertion of the full-length S gene for the development of DNA vaccines for MERS-CoV [61] . In the case of the adenovirus 5 (Ad5) vector-based vaccine, MERS-CoV S1-subunit-expressing Ad5 induced stronger VNA responses than Ad5 expressing the fulllength S protein [62, 63] . This might be because immunization with the S1 subunit can induce humoral immune responses more efficiently than that with the full-length S protein [62] . Additionally, there might remain concerns regarding the safety of using vaccines that express the full-length S protein, as such vaccines can potentially induce harmful side effects caused by non-neutralizing epitopes [62] . A previous SARS-CoV vaccine study reported inflammatory and immunopathological effects, such as eosinophilic infiltration, in immunized animals [64] . Therefore, insertion of the S1 subunit might be more favorable as an antigen relative to using the full-length S protein for vaccine development.",
