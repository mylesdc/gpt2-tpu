            "text": "Background. Zika virus (ZIKV) transmission has been reported in 67 countries/territories in the Oceania region and the Americas since 2015, prompting the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare ZIKV as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern in February 2016, due to its strong association with medical complications such as microcephaly and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (GBS). However, a substantial gap in knowledge still exists regarding differing temporal pattern and potential of transmission of ZIKV in different regions of the world. Methods. We use a phenomenological model to ascertain the temporal patterns and transmission potential of ZIKV in various countries/territories, by fitting the model to Zika case data from Yap Island and French Polynesia in the Oceania region and 11 countries/territories with confirmed case data, namely, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Guatemala, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Puerto Rico, Saint Martin, and Suriname, to pinpoint the waves of infections in each country/territory and to estimate the respective basic reproduction number R 0 . Results. Six of these time series datasets resulted in statistically significant model fit of at least one wave of reported cases, namely that of French Polynesia, Colombia, Puerto Rico, Guatemala, Suriname and Saint Martin. However, only Colombia and Guatemala exhibited two waves of cases while the others had only one wave. Temporal patterns of the second wave in Colombia and the single wave in Suriname are very similar, with the respective turning points separated by merely a week. Moreover, the mean estimates of R 0 for Colombia, Guatemala and Suriname, all land-based populations, range between 1.05 and 1.75, while the corresponding mean estimates for R 0 of island populations in French Polynesia, Puerto Rico and Saint Martin are significantly lower with a range of 5.70-6.89. We also fit the Richards model to Zika case data from six main archipelagos in French Polynesia, suggesting the outbreak in all six island populations occurred during the same time, albeit with different peak time, with mean R 0 range of 3.09-5.05. Discussion. Using the same modeling methodology, in this study we found a significant difference between transmissibility (as quantified by R 0 ) in island populations as opposed to land-based countries/territories, possibly suggesting an important role of geographic heterogeneity in the spread of vector-borne diseases and its future course, which requires further monitoring. Our result has potential implications for planning respective intervention and control policies targeted for island and land-based populations.",

The Richards model is a phenomenological model which describes the growth of the cumulative case number. K , r, and the turning point t i are three model parameters of epidemiological importance. These parameters can be estimated by fitting the Richards model to the epicurve of the outbreak, using standard software with nonlinear leastsquares (NLS) approximation subroutines, e.g., SAS MATLAB, or R. (SAS code provided in Table S2 .). The criterion for a good model fit is that the NLS estimation converges with p-value < 0.05 and that the 95% confidence intervals (CI) for all estimated parameters are positive, in order to ensure that all estimated model parameter values are significant. If a wave is achieved, we repeat the fitting procedure starting from the endpoint of this wave to attempt to obtain a subsequent wave, to see if it indeed exists.

The turning points for the waves vary substantially from week 48 of 2013 in Tahiti (6.5 weeks after week 41) to week 3 of 2014, a range of almost 2 months (see Fig. 3 ). Since the turning point often coincides with the peak time of incidence, this discrepancy indicates that, although the outbreak had occurred during the same time in all six archipelagos, it had peaked and hence declined at different times, perhaps suggesting a disparity in response/intervention. However, from Fig. 3 it appears that Tahiti might be missing data from early stage of the wave before week 41, and hence is likely the earliest wave when compared with the other archipelagos.

Moreover, the transmissibility is also similar, with very comparable ranges of R 0 for the two countries, which is surprising since these two countries have no common border, with Venezuela, French Guiana and Brazil in between. The two waves of cases we detected for Colombia have similar range of R 0 .

We have refrained from using the suspected case data for our model fitting, based on the distinctly different nature of confirmed and suspected case data. While the confirmed case data are typically confirmed either clinically or in laboratory and could underreport the true symptomatic cases, the suspected case data often contain cases that cannot be confirmed and hence tend to overstate the true magnitude of outbreaks and perhaps significantly distort the temporal growth in the cumulative data that is used for fitting of the Richards model. Chowell and others (2016) used suspected Zika data in Colombia during January-April 2016 and a generalized Richards model to obtain mean estimates of reproduction number of 2.2 and 10.3, which is higher than our result for the second wave that overlaps the time period of their dataset. The substantial difference might be a consequence of the difference in outcome that might result from using confirmed or suspected cases.

Furthermore, in the study of 2007 ZIKV outbreak in Yap Island (another island population), Duffy et al. (2009) also estimated that 73% of the residents of age three or older have had recent ZIKV infection. With our high estimates of R 0 for 2015-2016 outbreaks in Puerto Rico and Saint Martin, it would be interesting to monitor whether reported Zika infections in this island populations in our study would indeed be substantial reduced, or even disappear in the near future as has been predicted (Cohen, 2016) .",

We also note that the data were reported by each country/territory, with significant differences in surveillance systems and reporting requirements, which must be taken into consideration when making comparisons (Pan American Health Organization, 2016a). These differences could conceivably contribute to differences in our estimation results, in particular that of estimates for R 0 .",

(2015) demonstrates that using the cumulative data superficially suggests a higher degree of precision in the estimation of the basic reproduction number R 0 , resulting in a potentially overly optimistic estimate of its precision as quantified by the range of its confidence interval. On the other hand, epidemic data by onset or reporting dates are typically subject to ongoing cleaning and correction of onset dates, as well as reporting delays and problems related to missing data and other artificial variations. Using cumulative data has the advantages of smoothing out some of these stochastic variations which might or might not be random in nature. In comparison with using data from French Polynesia and Colombia as examples, using cumulative data in this study does result in slightly better fit then using incidence data (Fig. S1 ), as shown in Table S2 with adjusted R 2 as goodness of fit measure for comparing model fits using either cumulative or incidence data. However, in this study our interpretation of transmissibility deals mainly with comparison analysis on geographical heterogeneity of R 0 in different countries/territories using the same modeling framework, and hence should remain valid.",
