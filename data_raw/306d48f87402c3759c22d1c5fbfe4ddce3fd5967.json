The successful implementation of ASP in the community health system (CHS) has been challenging. We evaluated perceptions of current ASP, potential setbacks of ASP implementation, and future demands on ASP services among physicians and pharmacists in the CHS. The qualitative research was conducted through in-depth individual interviews and focus group discussions with 11 physicians and 11 pharmacists. In addition, a quantitative gap analysis was conducted to assess the different awareness and demands on services of ASP and preferred antimicrobial-related problems (ARP). In overall, perceptions of ASP varied by profession. The identified setbacks were unorganized institutional leadership, the undefined roles of healthcare professionals, a lack of reimbursement, the hierarchical structure of the health system, and the labor-intensive working environment of pharmacy services. Although demands for ASP improvement were similar among professionals, they had different preferences in prioritizing each service item of ASP/ARP development and the profession responsible for each service. Continuous administrative and financial investments, understanding ASP contents, ASP-specific information technology, and interdisciplinary collaboration with good communication among healthcare professions are needed to continue the progression of ASP.",

According to the Korea ASP survey in 2015, the number of infectious disease (ID) specialists increased from previous surveys in 2006 and 2012, but the proportion of hospitals operating ASP did not increase; ASP were limited to top-tier general hospitals [8] . The survey concluded that ASP were not proliferating because of the lack of clinical pharmacists and adequate reimbursement from the national health insurance (NHI) system to support ASP [8] . Pharmacists play crucial roles in IPC/ASP; in fact, they can be facilitators or intermediaries at the opinion-gathering stages [9] . However, few studies have investigated the opinions of ASP stakeholders, such as ID physicians, non-ID physicians, and clinical pharmacists, especially at the level of community health systems (CHS).",

Unfortunately, this meant that ID consults were often pointless (phy6- [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] .

In hospitals where ASP are not well implemented, the role of an ID physician seems to be limited. Some primary team physicians felt that ID consults (e.g., approval of the use of restricted antimicrobials) undermined their prescribing privileges (phy4-6-165).

There was concern over non-ID primary physicians adjusting doses for patients with decreased renal or hepatic function by ID physicians and pharmacists while overlooking acute changes or comorbidities (phy2-5-125, phy7-3-66, pharm2-3-63). Nevertheless, pharmacists were recognized as the most suitable profession to monitor drug-drug and drug-food interactions (phy2-5-126). Physicians believed that pharmacists are trained to reconcile medication problems with good accessibility to drug information (phy6-4-100). A lack of conversion from parenteral to oral routes was also mentioned, as pharmacists found that parenteral medication often continued until discharge regardless the clinical stability (pharm1-1-27, pharm1-1-32, pharm2-9-211).",

An ASP can be defined as a process that enhances the effectiveness of treatment by sharing the decision-making stage in the treatment of ID among a multidisciplinary team of experts. In this study, conflicts related to scopes of responsibility and interpretation of the treatment guidelines were found not only inter-professionally, between primary care physicians and pharmacists, but also intra-professionally, between ID specialists and primary team physicians. Since antimicrobials articulate important inter-professional asymmetries, pharmacists should be positioned as delimited negotiators within the context of medical prescribing power. A nuanced understanding of the characters of inter-professional negotiations is crucial for improving the use of antimicrobials within and beyond the hospital. Pharmacist participation is the starting point of ASP team building and can facilitate consensus among multidisciplinary healthcare professionals regarding prescription rights. In our study, non-ID specialists, ID specialists, and pharmacists understood the necessity of ASP and demanded the support of a central system and interrelated team action. However, they had drawn their own boundaries within the scopes of practice and the allowed collaborative share. Our in-depth interviews (IDIs) and focus group discussions (FGDs) suggest that the primary responsibility of patient care by the primary team physician should be respected, but at the same time, the antimicrobial treatment decision by the ASP should not be contestable. Pharmacists should also understand the physicians' decision processes to apply evidence-based pharmacotherapy.",

The percentage of pharmacists working at medical institutions is 22.1% and 24.1% in Japan and the US, respectively, but about 11.7% in Korea [14] . In addition, because pharmacy technicians do not operate within the legal framework, job separation and job descriptions of pharmacists are not standardized. It is necessary to reduce the labor-intense preparation work by legalizing the pharmacy assistant personnel system and by upgrading pharmacy automation. Furthermore, there is no financial reimbursement for the professionals who perform and maintain ASP in the healthcare setting in Korea [15] . It might be hard to see a direct correlation between the reimbursements of ASP activities and the proper use of antibiotics. Although the MOHW has reimbursed medical institutions for infection prevention and management measures according to their grades since 2017, this reimbursement policy is limited regarding such measures such as strengthening facilities and human resources standards to prevent infection, improving infectious disease management, expanding the medical surveillance system, and supporting infectious disease management for small and medium medical institutions [4] . Based on this reimbursement policy, Grade 1 sites are allowed one person in charge of IPC per 150 beds, and about $1.7/patient/day is reimbursed. This budget is, in fact, mainly used for hiring nurses dedicated to IPC. Physicians did not seem to clearly distinguish responses to IPC from ASP, and they did not focus solely on responses about ASP for the purposes of this study. It can be seen that the awareness of the medical staff about infection management is reflected in the priority given to infection management and prevention but not to antimicrobial medication management. When answering the questions on current experience with ASP, doctors were more interested in the environment, facilities, and treatment materials to prevent infection than antibiotics.",

However, the differentiation of this study between other research results lies in its making up for the weaknesses of study methods with FGD and IDI focusing on infectious disease management. Human behaviors are not easily verbalized, especially if they are considered a generally accepted part of the culture. However, human behaviors are easily observed. When responding to our supplementary questions, interviewees reinforced these points. Our findings reveal a weak correlation between the current service establishment and future service requirements (Figures 1 and 2) . Gaps between pharmacists and physicians seem to be profound. Even though physicians felt that most of the current ARP-related services were not well established, their demands for the future were less extensive than those of the pharmacists. Particularly in connection with services related to formulary restrictions and preauthorization requirements, physicians appeared to recognize that the current service is excessive. They want pharmacists' services in the areas of ADRs, drug interactions, and adherence, which occur after they have prescribed antimicrobials. The current lack of services that physicians strongly desire can be prioritized in the further development of ASP. Pharmacists are well aware of the need for all ASP services and the further efforts needed to systematize and promote better services within the system currently in place.",

Three hospitals with potential infrastructure to develop ASP were selected in the Seoul capital area, which is home to more than 48.2% of the national population of South Korea. The results may still not completely reflect the opinions of all physicians and pharmacists at CHS of Korea so further study is warranted. Nonetheless, our results suggest several considerations for the future development of ASP with ARP. Lastly, there might be a bias in performing interviewing, coding and selecting the content. To reduce individual biases, a trained interviewer and researchers with pharmacy backgrounds and knowledge of ASP concepts were involved to assist with coding and theme development, and we additionally analyzed the results using a gap-analysis. The gap analysis was applied to visualize our qualitative analysis; thus, the extrapolation of the result should be carefully interpreted.",

As Korean law allows only pharmacists to process medication preparation and dispensing, which leads to the limited clinical involvement of pharmacists in pharmaceutical care service, effective ASP-specific IT support is necessary to overcome those challenges. Several features should be included such as (a) sorting the list of patients who are on antimicrobials from the electronic medical records (EMR), (b) reviewing antimicrobial orders of patients, (c) checking relevant laboratory results of white blood cell counts and renal/hepatic functions, and (d) reporting microbiology identification with cultures and sensitivity. Lastly, it is critical to have the function of (e) ways of communication among primary providers, ID physicians, and pharmacists. (2) Because CHS is community-based, ASP should be tailored to local characteristics, patient composition, and the demands of hospital professionals. The first step is to prioritize the services. In our interview, although there were some differences among professionals on what they prefer, pharmacists are able to find what service would be more accepted by physicians. Based on our findings, although physicians had different preferences in prioritizing each service item of ASP/ARP, services regarding dosage review, ADR, drug-drug and drug-food interactions were often mentioned first.",

FGD was applied to pharmacists working full-time, having at least 3 years of hospital experience. Their major responsibility was mostly the preparation and dispensing of medications (Table 1) . Participants were purposely selected via a snowball sampling strategy. IDI and FGD arrangements were made in advance by email or phone conversation. Written informed consent was obtained from each participant on the day of their respective interviews, and confidentiality was maintained of all personal information. The interviewer was a graduate student with experience conducting semi-structured interviews. To ensure interview quality, a second person supervised each interview. Interviews ranged between 40 and 60 min in length. The audio-recorded interviews were transcribed verbatim by a paid undergraduate student experienced in transcription. Once completed, all of the transcripts were checked against the audio recordings to ensure transcription accuracy. Recruitment was finalized when data saturation was reached [20] . ",

A literature search was conducted using the following keywords: \"antimicrobial stewardship program,\" \"pharmacist,\" \"intervention,\" \"antimicrobials,\" \"infectious disease,\" \"satisfaction,\" and \"demands.\" The ASP guidelines published by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP) were reviewed to incorporate the most up-to-date recommendations for performing hospital infection control and pharmacy collaborative activity into the topic guide [21, 22] . The relevant literature was summarized into the following categories: issues to be resolved, current challenges, the items of ASP-based services, member composition, and the types of pharmacy intervention. Once the interview topics were drafted, they were modified further by consultations with experts and subsequent discussions involving the research team and the pharmacy students. The sections included in the final topic guide were \"perceptions and potential setbacks of current ASP\" and \"suggestions and future demands for ID-related services\". Supplementary questions were prepared in two parts. The first part had 10 questions asking about previous and current experiences of ASP and future ASP-related needs. The second part had 11 questions about previous experience and future needs related to ARPs. The interviewees were prompted to respond \"yes\" or \"no\" to each question (Table 2) [20, 21] .",

The transcript is publically available at https://github.com/SandyRhie/FGI. Gap plots were generated to quantify the gaps between physicians and pharmacists in terms of their awareness of the availability and demands of the services that they think should be implemented in future ID management. The level of service provision was considered well established if more than half of the respondents (cutoff: \u22656/11 physicians or \u22656/11 pharmacists) responded \"yes\"; the same criterion applied to deem future services \"necessary.\"",

Based on the results of the gap analysis, there are some points that need to be changed. Such a communication-promoting interdisciplinary activity is being piloted by our research team in a community-based hospital. We designed the ASP EMR to document any relevant notes in the one section no matter which healthcare professional is involved. We further set up the co-signature function by ID physician after the pharmacy consultation note has been left. It is believed to increase the acceptance of the ASP intervention notes by the primary team. Pharmacists should be available to fulfill the important role of mediating and regulating opinions among physicians and other team members.",
