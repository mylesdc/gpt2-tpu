In chickens, the clinical manifestation of NDV strains varies significantly due to the degree of strain virulence and host susceptibility (Alexander, 2000) . NDV strains are categorized as highly virulent (velogenic), moderately virulent (mesogenic), or avirulent (lentogenic), all according to pathogenicity for chickens gauged by the intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI) and mean death time (MDT; OIE, 2012) .",

            "text": "Historically, NDV strains have been divided into two major divisions-class I and class II-which contribute to the extensive genetic diversity among poultry worldwide, with class I being further divided into nine genotypes distributed worldwide in waterfowls and class II comprising 18 (I-XVIII) genotypes when the sequences are isolated over time (Ballagi-Pord\u00e1ny et al., 1996; Liu et al., 2003; Kim et al., 2007; Miller et al., 2010; Diel et al., 2012; OIE, 2012; Snoeck et al., 2013) . With the exception of 9a5b, class I strains are avirulent in chickens and have historically been recovered from aquatic birds (Shengqing et al., 2002; Kim et al., 2007; Diel et al., 2012) . Genotypes I, II, V, VI, VII, and IX of NDV have often been isolated in South China (e.g., Guangdong Province), although genotypes V, VI, and VII of class II strains are the predominant genotypes there and contain only virulent viruses (Jinding et al., 2005; Cai et al., 2011; Kang et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2015) . In 1948, genotype IX emerged as a unique group including the first virulent NDV strains (F48E9) in South China, and members of the genotype are occasionally isolated from a wild variety of bird species (Liu et al., 2003) . To date, many newly emergent strains isolated from a wide range of birds contribute to increasing the global burden of NDV and cause enormous losses in the poultry industry (Liu et al., 2003; Jinding et al., 2005; Kim et al., 2007; Kang et al., 2014) . In 1981, genotype VI of NDV strains was first isolated from pigeons and was repeatedly isolated in China until 1985, when genotype VII became more epidemic and posed a constant threat to domestic poultry (Mase et al., 2002; Liu et al., 2003; Cai et al., 2011) . Genotype VII of NDV strains have continued to circulate in poultry throughout South China and are now considered to be enzootic as they spread around the globe.",

As a result, upon the natural transmission from pigeons to chickens, PPMV-1 strains may evolve into virulent viruses and induce major outbreaks (Dortmans et al., 2011) . In China, the implementation of extensive vaccination procedures among commercial poultry farms and the culling of infected poultry have reduced the number of epizootic outbreaks of ND since the 1980s (Liu et al., 2003; Kang et al., 2014) . However, genotypes V, VI, VII, and IX of NDV continue to circulate and frequently cause outbreaks in China (Cai et al., 2011; Qiu et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2011; Kang et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2015) .

The oropharyngeal and cloacal swab samples were inoculated in 10-days-old specific-pathogenfree (SPF) embryonated chicken eggs, as previously described (Kang et al., 2015) . A hemagglutination (HA)-inhibition (HI) test was conducted using four HA units of the isolates and virus purification performed, as described by Office International Des Epizooties (OIE; OIE, 2012). A total of 23 NDV strains were isolated ( Table 1) . The MDT in 9-days-old SPF embryonated chicken eggs and ICPI tests in 1-day-old SPF chickens were performed according to OIE's (2012) standard procedure. Isolates were titrated in 10-days-old SPF-embryonated chicken eggs and stored at \u221280 \u2022 C for further characterization. The evaluation of 50% egg infective doses (EID 50 ) was calculated by using the Reed-Muench method (Reed and Muench, 1938) .",

            "text": "d For statistical analysis, a value of 1.5 was assigned if the virus was not detected from the undiluted sample in three SPF embryonated chicken eggs (Kang et al., 2015) .Virus titers are expressed as means For statistical purposes, a value of 1.5 was assigned if virus was not detected from the undiluted sample in three embryonated hen's eggs (Kang et al., 2015) . No. D/S/total shows the number of dead (D) and sick (S) as well as the total number of pigeons from the observation period. The pigeons that showed clinical signs, such as depression, torticollis, incoordination, and tremors, but recovered at the end of the observation were counted as sick animals. (Seal et al., 2005; Zhu et al., 2014) . Additionally, as results of phylogenetic analyses show, 12 velogenic strains isolated from different birds related to predominant strains of class II genotypes VI, VII, and IX, thus suggesting the coexistence of different genotypes of NDV circulating simultaneously in South China, as well as a high probability of the emergence of new strains via recombination. Accordingly, epidemiological surveillance and further investigation at LBMs in South China is necessary in order to clarify the genetic evolution of NDV and thus issue early warnings. PPMV-1 is generally virulent, though upon infecting chickens can result in clinical diseases expected of NDV with low virulence (OIE, 2012); however, these viruses remain a hidden threat to the poultry industry (de Oliveira Torres Carrasco et al., 2008) . Previous studies have demonstrated that PPMV-1 strains are capable of being transmitted from infected pigeons to chickens and turkeys housed in physical contact, as well as that systemic replication can occur in those chickens and turkeys, as shown by the shedding the virus via oropharyngeal and cloacal routes and a humoral immune response to the virus; however quails and geese did not exhibit any clinical signs or shed the virus (Alexander and Parsons, 1984; Smietanka et al., 2014) . Very few studies have examined the infectivity, pathogenesis, and transmission of NDV and PPMV-1 infections in different birds. In response, the aim of our study was to investigate the susceptibility and transmission of chickens, ducks, and pigeons following infection with three NDV strains-namely, Chicken/Guangdong/GM/2014 (GM), Duck/Guangdong/YF18/2014 (YF18), and Pigeon/Guangdong/GZ289/2014 (GZ289)-and to provide useful information for improving control strategies against ND. Our results demonstrate that GM is highly pathogenic to chickens and can transmit among them as well as ducks while circulating in chickens. YF18 was highly pathogenic in chickens, might have moderate or low pathogenicity in ducks and pigeons, and does not transmit to pigeons. In addition, GZ289 isolated from pigeons showed low pathogenicity to chickens and domestic ducks and could transmit only in pigeons (Figure 2) . These results showed that NDVs isolated from different birds exhibit different host ranges and tissue tropisms. Nevertheless, our study posed several limitations-for instance, we do not know the infective dose for each virus for each species, owing to the adaptability of a virus within a single species.",

However, until now, well-controlled findings have not demonstrated the role of vaccination in any attempt to control NDV outbreaks by preventing virus transmission in poultry flocks. Moreover, current vaccines can prevent NDV outbreaks, yet not stop viral shedding in vaccinated poultry flocks (Kapczynski and King, 2005) . Additional studies are therefore needed to identify the best vaccine candidate, not only for preventing clinical disease and mortality, but also to decrease the magnitude of viral shedding from vaccinated birds.",

During the course of our study, the statistical analysis of serological results showed significant differences among chicken, duck, and pigeon groups exposed to different viruses, as well as the na\u00efve contacts. In chickens in the contact group, the virus was detectable from oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs inoculated with GM and YF18, whereas in ducks in the contact group, we could detect the virus only from oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs inoculated with YF18, with HI titers for the GM, YF18, and GZ289 of 5, 6,and 4 log 2, respectively. In contact group pigeons, the virus could be detected only from oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs inoculated with GZ289. Moreover, HI titers for GZ289 at 14 DPI were all 6 log 2 , though none of the three pigeons in the GM and YF18 groups seroconverted (HI titers = 4). In all, the efficient replication, high seroconversion, and shedding of relatively high titers in na\u00efve contact groups suggest that NDV isolated from different birds was transmitted to the na\u00efve contact group.",
