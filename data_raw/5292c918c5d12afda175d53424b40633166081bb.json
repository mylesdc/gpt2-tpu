Using an m 6 A-modified hairpin present in the Kaposi's sarcoma associated herpesvirus (KSHV) ORF50 RNA, we identified seven members from the 'Royal family' as putative m 6 A readers, including SND1. RIP-seq and eCLIP analysis characterised the SND1 binding profile transcriptome-wide, revealing SND1 as an m 6 A reader. We further demonstrate that the m 6 A modification of the ORF50 RNA is critical for SND1 binding, which in turn stabilises the ORF50 transcript. Importantly, SND1 depletion leads to inhibition of KSHV early gene expression showing that SND1 is essential for KSHV lytic replication. This work demonstrates that members of the 'Royal family' have m 6 A-reading ability, greatly increasing their epigenetic functions beyond protein methylation.",

            "text": "Introduction N 6 -methyladenosine (m 6 A) is the most prevalent internal modification of eukaryotic messenger RNAs (mRNAs). Despite the identification of this modification over four decades ago, only recently have major breakthroughs in our understanding of this modification been made due to the development of m 6 A-seq, which allows immunoprecipitation of fragmented m 6 A-modified RNAs followed by next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis. m 6 A-seq and subsequent enhanced versions of the technique led to transcriptome-wide maps of cellular m 6 A modification (Dominissini et al., 2012; Meyer et al., 2012; Patil et al., 2016) . m 6 A writers have also been identified, a catalytically active methyl-transferase, METTL3 , together with adapter components, catalyses m 6 A addition onto specific RNA sequences containing the DRm 6 ACH motif, where D = A, G or U; R = A or G; H = A, C or U. The RNA demethylases FTO (Jia et al., 2011) and ALKBH5 (Zheng et al., 2013) can erase m 6 A marks offering a dynamic regulation of m 6 A status in RNA. Importantly, a family of effector m 6 A readers have also been identified comprising five YT521-B homology (YTH) domaincontaining proteins. YTH readers directly bind m 6 A in target RNAs through an aromatic cage (Liao et al., 2018) , directing their targets towards different biological fates. YTHDF2 recruits the CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex and promotes degradation of m 6 A-containing RNAs (Du et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2014) while YTHDF1, YTHDF3 and YTHDC2 stimulate mRNA translation of their targets (Wang et al., 2015; Shi et al., 2017; Hsu et al., 2017) and YTHDC1 regulates mRNA splicing (Xiao et al., 2016) . Whether other proteins can directly recognise m 6 A has remained a question to date. Other RNA-binding proteins can read m 6 A indirectly, in a so-called 'm 6 A switch' mechanism, in which m 6 A destabilises the local RNA structure in hairpins allowing recruitment of either hnRNPC to U-tracts or hnRNPG to a purine-rich motif , both readers then regulate alternative splicing. Recently, IGF2BP proteins were reported to enhance mRNA stability and translation of m 6 A-containing RNAs and proposed to be a novel class of m 6 A readers .",

KSHV has a biphasic life cycle, with a latent phase and a productive lytic phase. During latency, the KSHV episome is dormant in the nucleus of endothelial progenitor cells and B-lymphocytes (Giffin and Damania, 2014) , with few viral latent genes expressed. Under various stimuli, the KSHV episome can be reactivated into lytic replication, leading to the ordered expression of more than 80 viral proteins. The replication and transcription activator (RTA) viral protein, which is encoded from open reading frame 50 (ORF50), is the first lytic protein produced and is essential for the latent-lytic switch (Guito and Lukac, 2012) .",

This methyl group has also been found in the mRNA of certain viruses, including the Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) which causes cancer. Recent work has shown that a family of proteins, known as the YTH family, can recognise and bind to this specific methyl group and regulate the rate at which mRNA degrades. To investigate whether other proteins can recognise m 6 A, Baquero-Perez et al. mapped the m 6 A residues of mRNAs encoded by KSHV genes and looked at which proteins the methyl mark interacts with.",

Further experiments showed that SND1 binds to and stabilises a viral mRNA which provides the template for a protein that the virus needs to replicate. When SND1 was removed from human immune cells infected with KSHV, this caused the virus to replicate less efficiently.",

            "text": "The discovery that the Royal family of proteins can recognise methylated mRNA as well as methylated proteins suggests that there may be a common feature that allows proteins to read methylation. Understanding the shape of this feature could lead to new treatments that block viruses from making the proteins they need to replicate. sequences found in ORF50 and ORF37. Through the use of RNA affinity, in addition to YTH readers, eight members from the Tudor domain 'Royal family', including SND1 (Staphylococcal nuclease domain-containing protein 1), were specifically enriched in m 6 A-modified KSHV sequences. The 'Royal family' is a well-characterised family that reads methylated residues in histones through the use of an aromatic cage (Chen et al., 2011) which is structurally similar to the one found in YTH readers (Luo and Tong, 2014) . Electromobility shift assays (EMSAs) demonstrate the ability of specific Royal domains to selectively bind m 6 A-modified RNA. As these domains do not bind all m 6 Amodified RNA sequences it suggests this binding may occur in a RNA secondary structure/ sequence-dependent manner. We further developed a modified RIP-seq technique, which significantly improves the resolution of standard RIP, accompanied by a unique bioinformatic analysis to characterise for the first time the transcriptome-wide binding profile of SND1 to cellular and KSHV mRNAs, revealing SND1 as a bona fide RNA-binding protein that targets m 6 A-modified RNAs in KSHV-infected cells, including the extensively m 6 A-modified ORF50 RNA. SND1 eCLIP (enhanced crosslinking immunoprecipitation) analysis using publically available datasets deposited in the ENCyclopedia Of DNA Elements (ENCODE) further confirmed that SND1 has a binding profile similar to other m 6 A reader proteins. Importantly, depletion of SND1 in KSHV-infected cells significantly reduced the stability of unspliced ORF50 RNA and led to markedly reduced levels of RTA protein together with a global impairment of KSHV lytic replication. Furthermore, we show that m 6 A-modification in ORF50 RNA regulates SND1 binding to this RNA, particularly to the unspliced form. These data identify SND1 as an essential m 6 A reader for KSHV lytic replication and implicate the 'Royal family' as a family which comprises m 6 A readers. This, considerably expands the landscape of m 6 A readers and the epigenetic functions of Royal members beyond protein methylation.",

Utilising this software we mapped m 6 A modifications in the KSHV transcriptome by performing m 6 A-seq in TREx BCBL1-Rta cells, a BCBL1-based, primary effusion lymphoma B-cell line containing latent KSHV episomes capable of doxycycline-inducible reactivation of lytic replication. We carried out m 6 A-seq in latent cells and cells undergoing lytic replication for 8 hr and 20 hr post-induction in two biological replicates. In latent cells, we consistently observed m 6 A peaks in six viral RNAs, including ORF72 and ORF73. At 8 hr post-reactivation, 33 m 6 A peaks were identified in 21 KSHV ORFs in both biological replicates . At 20 hr post-reactivation, 75 m 6 A peaks were mapped in 42 KSHV ORFs ( Figure 1a ). The positions of these m 6 A peaks were highly reproducible across the different time points and replicates ( Figure 1-figure supplement 1b) . 12 viral m 6 A peaks were further validated by two-step quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) (Figure 1-figure supplement 2). m 6 A peaks in cellular RNAs were also consistently called, with 18,946 m 6 A peaks common to both replicates in latent cells and 18,935 and 13,926 m 6 A peaks in cells reactivated for 8 hr and 20 hr, respectively (Figure 1b, Supplementary file 4) . Cellular m 6 A peaks remained mostly unchanged between latent and 8 hr of lytic replication. Lower detection of m 6 A peaks at 20 hr post-reactivation was observed in part due to KSHV-mediated host cell shut-off (Conrad, 2009) (Figure 1c) . However, the majority of uniquely identified m 6 A peaks at this time point were found in RNAs whose expression was increased during lytic replication ( Figure 1c) . Cellular m 6 A peaks were enriched in the coding region (CDS) and 3' untranslated region (UTR) throughout KSHV infection (Figure 1d) . In viral mRNAs, the majority of m 6 A peaks were located in the CDS (Figure 1e ). We also confirmed the DRm 6 ACH motif both in cellular and viral mRNAs (Figure 1f and g, respectively) . Approximately 60% of viral m 6 A peaks contained the GGm 6 AC[G/U] motif, a significant over-representation of the motif when compared to the expected DRm 6 ACH frequency.",

The KSHV transcriptome is extensively m 6 A-modified. (a) KSHV epitranscriptome map in TREx BCBL1-Rta cells at 20 hr post-lytic reactivation. m 6 A-IP reads and input reads are shown. m 6 A peaks identified by m6AViewer software with associated p-values are indicated. (b) Number of cellular m 6 A peaks consistently called by m6AViewer software in two biological replicates throughout KSHV infection. (a,b) To define significantly enriched m 6 A peaks in both viral and cellular RNAs, a minimum fold change of m 6 A-IP reads over input reads of ! 1.5 and a FDR < 5% was required in both Figure 1 continued on next page 2018; Tan et al., 2018) . All raw sequencing data were subjected to quality control and processing as described in methods and m 6 A peaks were identified with m6aViewer. Peaks were filtered to keep only those with a minimum of 20 mean reads, 1% FDR (benjamini-hochberg) and an enrichment of 4-fold m 6 A-IP/input. After applying these cut-offs, our TREx BCBL1-Rta cells datasets contained twice as many m 6 A peaks as compared to the Tan dataset in the same cell line.~17,000 and~10,000 cellular m 6 A peaks were identified in our dataset during latency and lytic replication, respectively, while the Tan dataset yielded~9,000 m 6 A peaks during latency and~4,500 m 6 A peaks during lytic replication ( Figure 2a) . The most cellular m 6 A peaks were identified in the Hesser datasets in iSLK cells with~25,000 m 6 A peaks. A direct one-to-one reciprocal overlap comparison between each of our m 6 A peaks and those found in the other datasets was not possible, mostly due to vastly different peak widths (with the other datasets having narrower peaks and containing short read length coupled to single end data). In such situations, many peaks cannot be mapped one-to-one, with multiple peaks often overlapping a single one when comparing datasets, which leads to overlap quantifications that are not easily interpretable. Therefore, we compared the overlap of m 6 A-modified transcripts identified between all three studies. In TREx BCBL1-Rta cells, 72% of our 5,830 m 6 A-modified transcripts in latent cells were also present in the same cell line during latency in the Tan dataset, while 52% of our 4,059 m 6 A-modified transcripts in lytic cells were common to the lytic Tan dataset (Figure 2b ).~80% of m 6 A-modified transcripts in our TREx BCBL1-Rta dataset were also identified in the Hesser dataset which mapped m 6 A in iSLK cells ( Figure 2b ). This analysis shows a high reproducibility identifying m 6 A-modified transcripts in KSHV-infected cell lines by three different groups.",

We then compared the m 6 A-IP coverage maps of the KSHV transcriptome in lytic TREx BCBL1-Rta cell lines, overall, viral m 6 A peaks were strikingly similar in both studies ( Figure 2c ). Of note, m 6 A peaks in ORF50 RNA were consistently mapped in similar regions in both iSLK and TREx BCBL1-Rta cell lines ( Figure 2-figure supplement 1) , with the highest similarity found between TREx BCBL1-Rta cell lines. Although, in particular instances, m 6 A peaks differed between studies, for example ORF56 and ORF64 had a distinct m 6 A peak in this study but not in Tan et al.

Intriguingly, when we compared the m 6 A-IP coverage maps between our lytic TREx BCBL1-Rta cells and lytic iSLK cells from Tan et al., although clear common peaks were present, these maps differed more than the TREx BCBL1-Rta cells (Figure 2c and d, blue lines) suggesting that the KSHV transcriptome may be differentially modified depending on the cell type, suggesting potential epitranscriptomic remodelling of silencing and activating m 6 A motifs may take place differently between cell types (Hesser et al., 2018; Tan et al., 2018) . biological replicates.

            "text": "We were intrigued to determine whether any m 6 A readers uniquely interact with methylated viral mRNAs. Of particular interest were the m 6 A peaks found in the second exon of ORF50 RNA, as this RNA encodes the latent to lytic switch RTA protein. To this end, RNA affinity coupled to mass spectrometry analysis was performed. Viral RNA baits were centred on the closest GGACU motif to the m 6 A peak positions of the largest peak of ORF37 and the first and fourth m 6 A peaks of the second exon of ORF50 ( Figure 1h ) (hereafter referred to as ORF37, ORF50-1 and ORF50-4 baits respectively). See Figure 3 -figure supplement 1 for m 6 A peak positions from all m 6 A-seq time points. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed that all three m 6 A baits enriched for YTH readers (Figure 3a ). An intriguing observation was that of the three viral baits, exclusively the methylated ORF50-1 (m 6 A-ORF50-1) distinctly enriched SND1, a Tudor domain-containing protein. SND1 was in the top thirteen enriched protein hits, together with YTHDF1, YTHDF2 and YTHDF3. Further binding validation of YTHDF1 and SND1 in RNA affinity experiments demonstrated that YTHDF1 was greatly enriched in all three methylated baits while SND1 showed a modest but clear enrichment exclusively in m 6 A-ORF50-1 bait (Figure 3-figure supplement 2). SND1 binds symmetrically dimethylated arginines (sDMA) via its Tudor domain (Liu et al., 2010) , thus it harbours the ability to selectively recognise methyl groups. In addition to SND1, m 6 A-ORF50-1 bait also prominently pulled down three spliceosomal proteins known to interact with the Tudor domain of SND1, snRNP200, snRNP116 and PRPF8 (Yang et al., 2007) . These proteins were within the top fifteen enriched protein hits. Multiple proteins related to RNA processing were also enriched in this bait (Supplementary file 1). SND1 belongs to the Tudor domain 'Royal family', comprising five subfamilies: Tudor, plant agenet, chromo, PWWP and MBT (Maurer-Stroh et al., 2003) . Members from each subfamily share a structurally related b-barrel that harbours an aromatic cage implicated in binding methylated arginines and lysines (Chen et al., 2011) . Intriguingly, the aromatic cage used for m 6 A recognition by YTH readers is structurally similar to the one present in the 'Royal family' (Luo and Tong, 2014; Li et al., 2014; Xu et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2014) . Thus, further scrutiny for Royal members was carried out in the mass spectrometry data. Strikingly, several Royal members were also enriched in methylated viral baits. All three plant agenet members, which were recently identified as RNA sequence-dependent m 6 A readers (Edupuganti et al., 2017; Arguello et al., 2017) , were exclusively bound to m 6 A-ORF50-1 bait ( Figure 3a) . Three PWWP domain-containing proteins were also enriched in m 6 A-ORF50-1 bait while m 6 A-ORF37 bait retrieved the chromo protein CBX3 (Figure 3a) . These results suggest that Royal domains may be capable of reading methyl-decorations not only in proteins but also in RNA. None of the indirect m 6 A readers, hnRNPA2B1, hnRNPC or hnRNPG, or IGF2BP proteins were enriched in any of the baits (Supplementary file 2). Eight proteins with methyl-transferase activity were also recruited to methylated baits (Supplementary file 2), of these, METTL16 is the second m 6 A methyltransferase identified to date (Pendleton et al., 2017) , which methylates structured RNAs where the adenosine is present in a bulge in the nonamer sequence UACAGAGAA, where A is modified (Mendel et al., 2018) . The remaining identified proteins may play a previously uncharacterised role in the m 6 A RNA metabolism. Taken together, these results identify several members from the 'Royal family' as putative m 6 A readers. (Hesser et al., 2018; Tan et al., 2018) is shown, with 1 being 100%. (c) Comparison of the lytic epitranscriptomic map from our study and the one performed by Tan et al., both carried out in TREx BCBL1-Rta. Circos plot of m 6 A-IP read coverage across the viral episome is shown for both studies. Coverage tracks were scaled to account for differences in library sizes. KSHV gene positions are indicated by the central track. Some differences in the identified m 6 A peaks between the two datasets are highlighted. Royal domains display selectivity for specific m 6 A-modified RNA hairpins We next determined whether the Royal domains from the Royal members enriched in methylated viral RNAs display affinity for m 6 A-modified RNA in the absence of any other protein interaction. The complete Royal Tudor domain of SND1 (residues 650-910) is required for sDMA-binding (Liu et al., 2010) , consequently, a GST-recombinant protein containing these residues (548-910), referred here as SND1-C-terminus, was used in native electromobility shift assays (EMSAs). Notably, SND1-C-terminus shifted m 6 A-ORF50-1 bait in contrast to the control bait ( Figure 3b ). Neither ORF50-4 nor ORF37 methylated baits were selectively bound by SND1-C-terminus (Figure 3c and d, respectively). Note that the membranes had to be overexposed to obtain a good shift signal due to the small amount of shifted RNA in comparison with the free bait, consistent with the modest enrichment of SND1 in m 6 A-ORF50-1 bait (Figure 3-figure supplement 2). Similarly, a weak shift has also been previously observed in EMSAs for FMRP protein (Edens et al., 2019) and IGF2BP proteins . RNA secondary structure prediction of all baits indicates that they form strongly base-paired hairpins with an apical loop in which m 6 A is exposed and an additional large unpaired bulge; however, ORF50-4 and ORF37 feature this unpaired bulge in the middle of their stem ( Figure 3-figure supplement 3) . This may imply that SND1 cannot bind when the unpaired bulge is present at this position irrespective of m 6 A. In contrast, the beginning of the stem of ORF50-1 shows weak base-pairing with four unpaired bases (Figure 3-figure supplement 3, black box) that may allow opening of the hairpin and selective SND1-binding when m 6 A is present. Curiously, when running m 6 A-ORF50-1 bait on its own (without any protein), two distinct bands were visualised, one lower band which migrated at the same speed of A-ORF50-1 bait and another higher band migrating slower ( Figure 3-figure supplement 4) . Electrospray ionisation (ESI) of the ORF50-1 baits showed that there were no truncated forms and that the correct molecular weight of a methyl group had been added (15 daltons), demonstrating the purity of the baits (Figure 3 -figure supplement 4). As m 6 A can destabilise local RNA structure in hairpins , it seems plausible that m 6 A addition to ORF50-1 destabilises the hairpin which then migrates slower compared with the non-methylated bait. To test this hypothesis, a cropped version of ORF50-1 bait (cORF50-1) with strong base-pairing throughout the stem (Figure 3-figure supplement 3) was tested in EMSAs. Remarkably, SND1-C-terminus did not shift this bait (Figure 3e ), highlighting that structural features of the RNA ligand are critical for SND1-binding and that the beginning of the m 6 A-ORF50-1 hairpin Figure 3 continued assigned to the protein was at least double in the methylated bait compared with the control bait. In this table, the number of unique peptides assigned to each protein is shown for each bait for clarity. (b-f) EMSAs were carried out using recombinant SND1-C-terminus protein (residues 548-910) and biotinylated viral RNA baits. A cropped version of ORF50-1 bait (cORF50-1) and a stable version of ORF50-1 bait (named sORF50-1) in which the beginning of the stem is made to have strong base pairing was also tested.

            "text": "The following figure supplements are available for figure 3: (Figure 3-figure supplement 3, boxed region) may be required for an interaction with SND1. We further mutated seven nucleotides to make this region very structured and stable, as demonstrated by the increase in free energy of this stable hairpin (sORF50-1). No specific selectivity for m 6 A-sORF50-1 by SND1-C-terminus was seen (Figure 3f) , indicating that destabilisation of this region is required for SND1 binding. Shorter exposure of the free m 6 A-sORF50-1 bait did not reveal two distinct bands as the ones present in m 6 A-ORF50-1 hairpin ( Figure 3-figure supplement 4) . To further support the hypothesis that Royal domains harbour selectivity for m 6 A-modified RNA, GSTrecombinant proteins containing the Royal domains of FXR1, PSIP1 and CBX3 were tested in EMSAs. Coomassie staining for all recombinant proteins can be seen in Figure 3 -figure supplement 5. The Royal domains of FXR1 and PSIP1 selectively shifted m 6 A-ORF50-1 bait, in contrast, none of the other baits were bound (Figure 3-figure supplement 6a and b, respectively) . The CBX3 chromodomain displayed a very faint shift for m 6 A-ORF50-1 bait, however this shift was not consistent between protein preparations (Figure 3-figure supplement 7a) indicating that this domain either may not be able to read m 6 A, or other protein partners could be required for its interaction with m 6 A in vivo. Control glutathione S-transferase (GST), a protein with no RNA-binding properties, was also tested in EMSA showing no selectivity for m 6 A-ORF50-1 bait (Figure 3-figure supplement 7b). EMSAs were also performed in the presence of excess herring sperm DNA as a source of nonspecific DNA. In the presence of sperm DNA no shift was detected and the free bait remained uncomplexed (Figure 3-figure supplement 7c), suggesting that non-specific DNA prevents the interaction between SND1 and m 6 A-ORF50-1 bait. This is not surprising as excess of DNA may sequester SND1 which is a known DNA-binding transcription factor. Together, these results confirm that Royal domains in the absence of any other protein interaction display selectivity for m 6 A-modified RNA, our data also suggests that this selectivity may occur in a RNA secondary structure-dependent manner.",

Latent and lytic TREx BCBL1-Rta cells that had been reactivated for either 8 or 20 hr were used. We aimed to obtain the best protein binding site resolution by sonicating the majority of the total RNA to <200 bp ( . Thus, this technique has a binding site resolution of~1 kB. A transcript-wide analysis enabled us to identify SND1 RNA targets, using a false discovery rate (FDR) < 1% and a fold change of RIP reads over input reads >2, this analysis uncovered SND1 as a bona fide RNA-binding protein, yielding 5061 target transcripts (Supplementary file 5). Of these, 3319 transcripts were mRNAs and 748 were long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). These target RNAs were consistently bound by SND1 during latency and lytic KSHV replication (both at 8 and 20 hr). Gene ontology (GO) analysis revealed that these transcripts code for proteins that are involved in regulating GTPase activity, nervous system development and cell morphogenesis ( Figure 4a ). Next, all highly expressed transcripts identified by RIP-seq (FDR < 1%) were divided into high-confidence targets (those which had at least twice the normalised coverage in RIPs than input) and high-confidence non-targets (those which had at least twice as much coverage in inputs than RIPs) and the proportion of m 6 A-bearing RNAs in each group was determined. Strikingly, we observed that~50% of high-confidence targets and~24% of high-confidence non-targets were m 6 A-modified RNAs (Figure 4b) , representing a marked enrichment of m 6 A-bearing RNAs in the target group. It is worth noting that this transcript-wide analysis will not identify all SND1 targets, as when looking at the SND1-binding profile at the transcript level, it was evident that some RNAs are bound by SND1 at a specific region only ( Figure 4c) .",

We then mined previously processed PAR-CLIP and m 6 A-seq data sets Wang et al., 2015; Shi et al., 2017) from HeLa cells and calculated the percentage of total RNA targets of YTH readers that contain m 6 Amodified transcripts.~65% of all RNA targets contained m 6 A-modified transcripts (Figure 4-figure supplement 2). In addition, we compared the overlap of target genes containing or lacking m 6 A modification between SND1 and each heterologously expressed YTH reader. To our surprise, despite comparing TREx BCBL1-Rta and HeLa cells, we found that~50%,~32% and~37% of SND1 m 6 A-modified targets are common to YTHDF1, YTHDF2 and YTHDF3, respectively ( Figure 4e ). When we compared the SND1 targets that lack m 6 A, only~4%,~1% and~3% were shared with YTHDF1, YTHDF2 and YTHDF3, respectively ( Figure 4f ).

In brief, both spliced transcripts and introns were segmented into a total of~750,000 transcriptomic regions based on changes in their fold change RIP/input (Figure 4g ). Applying a fold change >2 and >50 mean reads per region (FDR < 1%), 32,314 transcriptomic regions were significantly bound by SND1. These regions encompassed 12,915 Ensembl transcripts and after applying a cut-off of >2 fold m 6 A-IP/input enrichment and a minimum RIP read depth of 50,~40% of these transcripts were m 6 A-modified. 4872 of these total targets showed SND1-binding throughout 5'UTR, CDS and 3'UTR ( Figure 4h ). We then focused on analysing SND1-enriched intronic regions, as introns tend to be longer than spliced RNAs and RIP-seq has a low resolution, we hypothesised that if SND1 is an m 6 A reader we might observe m 6 A peaks overlapping with SND1-enriched regions in introns. Out of the total 32,314 SND1-enriched regions, 2563 regions were found in introns. Of the latter, 516 intronic regions (20%), directly overlapped with m 6 A peaks (Figure 5a and e). As a control for random overlap, 8,328 SND1-unbound intronic regions were used, these were defined using a fold change RIP/input < 0.5 and >50 mean reads per region (FDR < 1%). Of these, only~1.3% (109) directly overlapped with m 6 A peaks ( Figure 4e ). SND1enriched regions overlapping m 6 A peaks in UTRs ( Figure 5b ) and lncRNAs (Figure 4-figure supplement 3a) were also observed. In 5'UTRs and 3'UTRs we found~40% overlap with m 6 A peaks in SND1-enriched regions compared to only~20% overlap of SND1-unbound regions ( Figure 5e ).",

During latency, one of the introns in TPO transcript was not m 6 A-modified and failed to bind SND1. In contrast, at 8 hr and 20 hr post-reactivation, several adenosines in this intron are m 6 A-modified and SND1 binding ensues ( Figure 5c ). The reverse scenario was also observed for example in the overlapping DUSP5P1-RHOU transcripts, in which specific m 6 A peaks and SND1-enriched regions present at 0 hr and 8 hr postreactivation disappeared at 20 hr of lytic reactivation (Figure 5d) . A list of these differential SND1binding events to target RNAs can be accessed in Supplementary file 6.

Since the eCLIP datasets were derived from HepG2 cells, we firstly assessed the overlap between the m 6 A profile in latent TREx BCBL1-Rta cells and HepG2 cells using an existing m 6 A-seq dataset from HepG2 cells (Figure 6a ). This revealed an extensive overlap of transcripts which contain m 6 A sites in these two cells lines, with 77% of TREx BCBL1-Rta m 6 A-modified transcripts being present in HepG2 cells. We then investigated the overlap between transcripts which are m 6 Amodified and bound by SND1 from RIP-seq and eCLIP datasets (Figure 6b ). This showed an overlap of 1166 transcripts bound by SND1 of which 88% contained m 6 A sites. We next compared the extent of overlap between m 6 A and eCLIP peaks on transcripts (Figure 6c ). We found comparable binding site overlap for SND1 and established readers with m 6 A peaks, whereas a control protein (TIAL1) showed reduced overlap between m 6 A peaks and its binding sites. We investigated the repertoire of transcripts bound by SND1 and other reader proteins and found extensive binding to protein coding transcripts (Figure 6d ). SND1 showed a similar distribution to m 6 A across transcripts with a bias towards coding region binding in common with most other reader proteins, whereas the control TIAL1 protein displayed a strong 3' UTR bias ( Figure 6e ). We used HOMER to identify motifs bound by SND1 and other established reader proteins using the ENCODE eCLIP datasets. This analysis, using peaks called from all transcripts, revealed a common sequence GGAC, the core of the consensus motif surrounding m 6 A sites. For SND1, this motif is further enriched from the eight highest scoring motif, when performed on all eCLIP peaks (30,121 peaks), to the second highest scoring motif, upon restricting the analysis to SND1 binding sites on exons which contain the m 6 A modification (7965 peaks), of which 58% (4,637) directly overlap an m 6 A site ( Figure 6f ). Together, this analysis reveals that SND1 recognises the consensus m 6 A motif in vivo and has a similar binding profile to other established reader proteins.",

As a comparison, a highly expressed viral lytic RNA, ORF57, did not reach the cut-off to be considered a high-confidence target (Figure 4-figure supplement 3e) . We additionally identified 33, 23 and 14 KSHV transcripts as high-confidence SND1 targets at 0 hr, 8 hr and 20 hr post-reactivation, respectively ( Figure 7a ). Deep-sequencing coverage for high-confidence SND1 targets can be seen in Figure 7 -figure supplements 1 and 2. Validation of SND1-binding to the different regions containing m 6 A peaks in the second exon and the intron of ORF50 RNA was performed by RIP followed by RT-qPCR. A~40 fold SND1 enrichment was detected in the second exon of ORF50 and a~10 fold enrichment in the intron compared with the SND1 enrichment detected on the nontarget 18S rRNA (Figure 7b ). We further tested by RIP the binding of endogenous FXR1, FXR2, PSIP1, YTHDF1 and YTHDF3 to ORF50 RNA, while non-specific rabbit immunoglobulin (IgG) was tracks depicting sequencing read coverage from input (green) and RIP (blue) samples. m 6 A-IP reads (pink) are also shown. Note that in contrast to ABCD1, RHOU/DUSP5P1 remain highly expressed even at 20 hr post-reactivation, suggesting the coupled loss of methylation/SND1-binding is independent of the ability to detect these events due to loss of expression. (e) SND1 regions consistently enriched across the three time points studied (0 hr, 8 hr and 20 hr) were defined by applying a fold change RIP/input >2 and>50 mean reads per region (FDR < 1%). Consistently SND1-unbound regions throughout KSHV infection were defined using a fold change RIP/input <0.5 and>50 mean reads per region (FDR < 1%). For all m 6 A overlap analysis, the cut-off for an m 6 A peak was defined as having 50 read paired at the tallest point in the m 6 A peak and a 2-fold enrichment of m 6 A-IP reads over input reads using a FDR < 1%. DOI: https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.47261.020 was used as a binding control RNA for YTH readers. Both YTH readers and FXR2 bound ORF50 RNA, showing a~8 fold enrichment (Figure 7b ) and~15 fold enrichment was observed for FXR1. PSIP1 showed a limited but consistent enrichment (~3 fold) above the negative control IgG. These results highlight that all these Royal members can target ORF50 RNA, SND1 displaying the highest affinity.",

Here, two TREx BCBL1-Rta cell lines with stable shRNA knockdown of SND1 (SND1 KD1 and SND1 KD2) and a shRNA scramble cell line were generated. Surprisingly, following 24 hr of lytic replication there were no significant differences between the scramble and the knockdown cell lines in the amount of KSHV lytic transcripts produced ( Figure 7c ). In accordance with mRNA levels, RTA and ORF57 proteins were not reduced ( Figure 7d) . Similarly, the early lytic protein ORF54 was not decreased (Figure 7d ). These data were also confirmed by RNA-seq performed in scramble and SND1 KD2 cells from two biological replicates. Following 24 hr of lytic reactivation, expression of the KSHV transcriptome in SND1-depleted cells was not significantly altered from scramble cells, with the exception of upregulation of ORF71 and ORF72 mRNAs (Figure 7e ). qRT-PCR analysis confirmed a~4 fold-induction of these transcripts in SND1-depleted cells during the lytic cycle (data not shown). These results possibly suggest that SND1 plays a role in maintaining low expression of these latent RNAs during lytic replication. Importantly, in the presence of overexpressed RTA protein, KSHV lytic replication is essentially unchanged in SND1-depleted TREx BCBL1-Rta cells, thus these cells still fulfil all viral functions necessary for triggering the lytic cascade.",

In contrast, the parental BCBL1 cell line lacks Myc-tagged RTA and reactivation is achieved by addition of the histone deacetylase inhibitor sodium butyrate (NaB), which leads to the expression of unspliced ORF50 RNA. This native RNA matures to the spliced form giving rise to RTA protein, which then transactivates the ORF50 promoter in a positive transcriptional feedback mechanism (Guito and Lukac, 2012) . However, as SND1 does not take part in the splicing of ORF50 RNA (Figure 7c) , it therefore suggests a potential role in the stabilisation of ORF50 RNA, which could be masked by constitutive overexpression of Myc-tagged RTA in TREx BCBL1-Rta cells. Thus, the same lentiviral shRNAs targeting SND1 were used to knockdown SND1 in BCBL1 cells. Remarkably, both SND1 knockdown cell lines showed a dramatic decrease in viral RNAs, including ORF50 RNA (Figure 7f) , and RTA, ORF57 and ORF54 protein levels ( Figure 7g) . These data were also confirmed by RNA-seq performed in scramble and SND1 KD2 BCBL1 cells from two biological replicates. After 24 hr of lytic reactivation, 48 KSHV RNAs were significantly downregulated in SND1depleted cells compared with scramble cells (FDR < 5%), including ORF50 RNA (Figure 7h) . These results indicate that in the absence of SND1 there is a global impairment of lytic KSHV replication downstream of RTA and uncover SND1 as an essential protein for lytic KSHV replication.",

Thus we hypothesised that SND1 may play a role in splicing through binding methylated intronic regions. Splicing analysis revealed multiple significant differential splicing events between scramble latent cells and scramble lytic TREx BCBL1-Rta cells, however, there were no significant splicing differences between scramble and SND1-depleted cells, when analysing cellular or viral transcripts from either latent or lytic cells (Figure 8a) . The same results were also observed in BCBL1 cells (data not shown). Note that lytic genes are also detected in latent cells (0 hr) due to spontaneous KSHV reactivation and the high sensitivity of deep-sequencing. As expected, significantly lower coverage for these lytic genes was Figure 7 continued on next page As SND1 has previously been described as a transcriptional activator (Jariwala et al., 2015) we determined whether it could associate with the ORF50 promoter by carrying out chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) with the ChIP-grade antibody we previously used for RIP-seq experiments. RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) antibody (clone CTD4H8) and non-specific immunoglobulin (IgG) were used respectively as positive and negative control antibodies. Whilst RNAPII was enriched at the GAPDH promoter and multiple viral promoters including ORF50, there was no significant enrichment for either SND1 or the non-specific IgG (Figure 7-figure supplement 3) . Moreover, RNA-seq analysis of TREX BCBL1-Rta-SND1 depleted cells showed no significantly downregulated viral gene expression (Figure 7e) . Consequently, we conclude that SND1 does not participate in the activation of the ORF50 promoter.",

To test this hypothesis without the possible interference of NaB on ORF50 RNA decay, the decay of native (unspliced) ORF50 RNA was monitored in scramble and SND1-depleted TREx BCBL1-Rta cells that had been reactivated into the lytic cycle for 24 hr before addition of actinomycin D. Strikingly, native ORF50 RNA was significantly more unstable in SND1-depleted cells (Figure 8b ) with~80% of ORF50 RNA remaining at 6 hr post-transcription inhibition in scramble cells and~50% in depleted cells. To further determine whether SND1 may also play a role in regulating the stability of ORF71 and ORF72 RNAs during the KSHV lytic cycle, the turnover of these transcripts together with other high confidence SND1 KSHV RNA targets was also investigated. In contrast to ORF50 RNA, these transcripts decayed in a similar manner in scramble and depleted cells (Figure 8b ). detected during latency compared with lytic replication.

Western blots are representative of two independent viral reactivations. Removal of m 6 A in ORF50 RNA impairs SND1 binding to ORF50 RNA Due to the broad and overlapping m 6 A-seq peaks across the ORF50 RNA and the high frequency of DRm 6 ACH motifs throughout ORF50 RNA, we attempted to deplete global m 6 A levels in ORF50 RNA by stably depleting METTL3 in BCBL1 cells and assess its effect on lytic replication, however limited depletion was achieved and no significant effect on KSHV lytic replication was observed (data not shown). The same METTL3 knockdowns were repeated in BCBL1 cells but transiently. After five days post-lentiviral transduction, cells were reactivated for 24 hr and viral and protein levels analysed. Here, one METTL3 knockdown cell line (METTL3 KD2) achieved a higher level of depletion of METTL3 protein and viral transcript and protein levels were both significantly reduced compared with the scramble cell line (Figure 7-figure supplement 4a and b) . In contrast, a second cell line (METTL3 KD1) showed no depletion of METTL3 protein and no significant differences in viral replication between these cells and the scramble were observed (Figure 7-figure supplement 4a and b) .",

Following reactivation, FTO-depleted cells displayed increased viral mRNA and protein levels (Figure 7-figure supplement 4c and d) , including increased levels of ORF50 RNA and RTA protein. Depletion of YTHDF1 or YTHDF3 readers resulted in decreased ORF50 RNA together with other lytic RNAs (Figure 7-figure supplement 5a-b and e-f), particularly, in YTHDF1-depleted cells, which also showed a marked reduction of viral protein levels. Depletion of YTHDF2 did not affect viral RNA levels, with the exception of PAN RNA, however a clear decrease in RTA protein and a slight reduction in ORF57 protein levels were evident (Figure 7-figure supplement 5c and d) .

Firstly, single-point mutations were performed in the GGACU motifs present in ORF50 baits to elucidate whether the chosen motifs were m 6 A-modified in the context of the full length ORF50 RNA. Wild type (WT) FLAG-ORF50 -containing both ORF50 exons and the intron-and mutant plasmids were transfected into HEK-293 cells and m 6 A enrichment quantified by m 6 A-IP-qPCR (Figure 8c) . In transfected cells, ORF50 RNA was particularly m 6 A-modified in ORF50-1 and ORF50-4 regions, suggesting cell type differences between TREx BCBL1-Rta and HEK-293 cells. Point mutation in the motif contained in ORF50-1 bait, but not in ORF50-4 bait, significantly reduced m 6 A enrichment, confirming that this site is m 6 A-modified. Next, the binding of SND1 to WT FLAG-ORF50 and to a interest were measured by qRT-PCR at 0 hr, 3 hr and 6 hr post-transcription inhibition (TI). Each viral gene was normalised against 18S rRNA. Values are averages, error bars present s.d. n = 4 independent viral reactivations. (c) m 6 A-enrichment was determined by m 6 A-IP-qPCR. HEK 293 cells were transfected for 24 hr with either wild type (WT) FLAG-ORF50 or a double mutant plasmid in which the GGACT motifs present in the ORF50-1 and ORF50-4 baits were mutated to GGATT. When using DAA, 4 hr after transfection DAA was added at a concentration of 200 mM, and 24 hr posttreatment cells were harvested. % of input was calculated similarly as to ChIP-qPCR analysis. Values are averages, error bars present s.d. *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001 using an unpaired t-test. ns = not significant. For WT ORF50 n = 9 independent m 6 A-IPs [3 including 0.25% (v/v) DMSOtreatment), for double mutant ORF50 n = 3, for DAA-treated cells n = 3. (d) HEK 293 cells were transfected for 24 hr with either wild type (WT) FLAG-ORF50 or a single mutant plasmid in which the GGACT motif present in the ORF50-1 bait was mutated to GGATT. For DAA-treated cells, 4 hr after transfection DAA was added at a concentration of 200 mM, and 24 hr post-treatment cells were harvested. SND1 enrichment was determined by SND1-RIP-qPCR and is relative to the enrichment found in the non-target 18S rRNA. GAPDH RNA served as an additional non-target RNA. Values are averages, error bars present s.d. For WT and mutant ORF50 n = 4 independent RIPs. For DAA-treated cells n = 3 independent RIPs. *p<0.05, **p<0.01 using an unpaired t-test. FLAG-ORF50 plasmid with a point mutation in the motif contained in ORF50-1 bait was evaluated by RIP. No significant decrease in SND1 binding was observed (Figure 8d) , indicating that other SND1 binding sites are necessary for ORF50 RNA-SND1 interaction.",

For this purpose, we made use of the drug 3-deazaadenosine (DAA), which inhibits m 6 A deposition by reducing levels of the methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM). HEK-293 cells were transfected with WT FLAG-ORF50 plasmid and 4 hr after transfection, control 0.25% (v/v) DMSO or 200 mM DAA was incubated for an additional 24 hr. Note that DAA did not result in cytotoxicity at this concentration after 26 hr post-treatment (Figure 8-figure supplement 1) . DAA effectively reduced m 6 A enrichment in all m 6 A-modified regions of ORF50 RNA (Figure 8c ) and led to a significant decrease of SND1 binding across ORF50 RNA (Figure 8d) . Interestingly, DAA completely abolished SND1 binding to the native ORF50 transcript, indicating that m 6 A inhibition on ORF50 RNA regulates SND1 binding to it, however the exact points of interaction between SND1 and ORF50 RNA remain to be elucidated at single nucleotide resolution.",

Additionally, SND1 has multiple roles modulating gene expression at a post-transcriptional level. SND1 is a component of the RISC complex (Jariwala et al., 2015) and acts in the processing of specific miRNAs (Heinrich et al., 2013) . m 6 A promotes processing of primary miRNAs (pri-miRNAs) (Alarc\u00f3 n et al., 2015), thus SND1 may also process m 6 A-modified pri-miRNAs, which could explain the SND1-binding in methylated introns we observed. In agreement with our finding that SND1 stabilises ORF50 RNA, SND1 binds to the 3 0 UTR of angiotensin II type one receptor (AT1R) and stabilises this mRNA leading to elevated protein AT1R levels (Jariwala et al., 2015) . Intriguingly, AT1R mRNA contains a single m 6 A site which is located in the 3'UTR region . Finally, SND1 also participates in RNA editing (Jariwala et al., 2015) . Under stress conditions, in mammalian cells SND1 co-localises with G3BP protein in stress granules (Gao et al., 2010) and stabilises AT1R and IGFBP2 mRNAs (Gao et al., 2015) . Similarly, in plants SND1 is essential for the stabilisation of a subset of stress-responsive mRNAs (Frei dit Frey et al., 2010) . It will be of interest to address to what extent SND1 regulates the stability of its target RNAs. Curiously, the readers YTHDF1-3, FXR1, FXR2 and FMR1 have also been identified in mammalian stress granule cores (Jain et al., 2016) .",

Interestingly, in SND1 (Chen et al., 2009a) , plant agenet members (Adams-Cioaba et al., 2010), PSIP1, HDGFRP2 and MSH6 (Qin and Min, 2014) , the aromatic pocket is hydrophobic and surrounded by both positive and negative residues thus, it seems plausible that binding only ensues when matching electrostatic interactions are achieved between the RNA sequence and the Royal domain, consequently, methylated proteins would adopt a different orientation to interact with negatively charged residues while m 6 A-decorated RNAs would interact with positively charged residues. This model would explain the RNA structure dependency observed for these proteins in binding m 6 A-modified RNA. In contrast, the aromatic cage of YTH readers resides in a hydrophobic pocket surrounded by a positively charged surface, rendering the YTH domain favourable to bind any methylated RNA sequence. Of note, plant agenet members contain two plant agenet domains (Agenet1 and Agenet2) in tandem, each harbouring an aromatic cage. Whilst the aromatic cage of Agenet2 is proposed to be the site that binds methylated lysines (Adams-Cioaba et al., 2010), Agenet1 exhibits a basic surface patch with potential for RNA binding (Myrick et al., 2015) . The plant Agenet domain of FMRP (1-134) has already been shown to harbour RNA-binding ability to RNA homopolymers, with progressively increased affinity when testing longer FMRP constructs (1-180 and 1-214), suggesting a cooperative effect between the positively charged residues distributed along the N-terminus region (Milosevich and Hof, 2016) . In a similar manner, the other domains present in SND1 cannot be disregarded in considering how SND1 may bind its target RNAs. Our RIP-seq data and eCLIP analysis reveals for the first time that SND1 is indeed a bona fide RNA-binding protein acting at the transcriptome level. Structural and biochemical analysis had already proposed that the N-terminal region of SND1, specifically SN3 and SN4, possess RNA binding (Li et al., 2008) , thus, in addition to the Tudor domain interacting with methylated RNA, the N-terminal region of SND1 most likely also contributes to RNA binding and may play a significant role in determining which RNAs are targeted by SND1, including those that are methylated.",

Of the Tudor subfamily, the Tudor domain-containing (TDRD) proteins, AKAP1, SMN and SPF30 display methyl-arginine-binding and are involved in RNA metabolism (Chen et al., 2011) , therefore these are ideal candidates to reveal more m 6 A readers. In contrast to the ubiquitously expressed SND1, most of the mammalian TDRD proteins display male germline-enriched expression and are essential for spermatogenesis (Chen et al., 2011) . It will be of interest to examine whether m 6 A-decorated RNAs are regulated post-transcriptionally via TDRD proteins during germ cell differentiation. Notably, spermatid perinuclear RNA-binding protein (STRBP) was within the top ten enriched proteins in m 6 A-ORF50-1 bait. The remainder members of the Tudor protein subfamily bind methyl-lysine residues and contain other domains related to chromatin biology, consequently, these proteins are unlikely to participate in RNA metabolism. The discovery of PSIP1, HDGFRP2 and MSH6 as putative m 6 A readers is surprising as the PWWP domain is a well-established nucleosome-binding domain and these proteins participate in DNA repair (Qin and Min, 2014) . However, FMRP takes part in the DNA damage response (Alpatov et al., 2014) but FMRP is also a RNA-binding protein that regulates the translation of its m 6 A-containing target RNAs (Edupuganti et al., 2017) . An m 6 A RNA-mediated response to UV-induced DNA damage was recently reported (Xiang et al., 2017) , as such, these PWWP proteins could represent a link between methylation of RNA and DNA damage. In support of the putative m 6 A reading ability of these proteins is the fact that mass spectrometry identification of PSIP1 short (p52) isoform, which includes the PWWP domain, revealed that~95% of interactors function in pre-mRNA processing. Moreover this isoform co-localised with SRSF2 in nuclear speckles and modulated alternative splicing (Pradeepa et al., 2012) , thus the implication of these proteins in m 6 A RNA metabolism requires further investigation.",

For each m 6 A-immunoprecipitation (m 6 A-IP), 25 ml of slurry of Magna ChIP Protein A+G magnetic beads (Merck Millipore) were washed twice with IP/wash buffer [20 mM Tris HCl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.1% NP-40 (v/v)]. Beads were re-suspended in 100 ml of IP/wash buffer and coated with 5 mg of rabbit anti-m 6 A antibody (ABE572) (Merck Millipore) for 45 min at room temperature with rotation.

For each RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP), 7 \u00c2 10 6 cells were used. Cells were fixed with 1% (v/v) formaldehyde (Calbiochem) for 10 min at room temperature. Crosslinking was stopped by addition of glycine at a final concentration of 125 mM for 5 min. Cells were washed with PBS (Lonza) and re-suspended in 200 ml of ice-cold shearing buffer [50 mM Tris HCl pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl and 0.1% (v/v) NP-40] supplemented with Complete, EDTA-free protease inhibitors (Roche) and 1 ml of murine RNase inhibitor (NEB). Samples were then sonicated with an EpiShear multi-sample sonicator (Active Motif) with pulses of 30 s of sonication followed by a 30 s rest for a total of 12 min at 30% amplitude. Polystyrene sonication tubes (Active Motif) were used to achieve efficient sonication.

For each RIP, 25 ml of slurry of Magna ChIP Protein A+G magnetic beads (Merck Millipore) were coated with the antibody of interest as previously described for m 6 A-seq. RIPs were prepared by mixing the antibody-coated beads with 800 ml of IP/wash buffer [20 mM Tris HCl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.1% NP-40 (v/v)], 35 ml of 0.5 M EDTA pH 8.0, 4 ml of murine RNase inhibitor (NEB) and 200 ml of lysate containing fragmented RNA. RIPs were incubated for 3 hr at 4\u02daC with rotation. Beads were then washed six times as previously described (Gilbert and Sj, 2006) .

Total RNA from input samples was isolated with the use of TRIzol (Thermo Scientific) according to the supplier's protocol and treated with DNase I using the DNA-free DNA Removal Kit (Ambion). Input RNA was saved without applying sonication because we observed lower quality sequencing libraries when using sonicated input RNA than when using input RNA that was heat-fragmented. Saved input RNA was therefore heat-fragmented for 8 min at 94\u02daC before proceeding with library construction. Due to the large size of RNA fragments observed after SND1 immunoprecipitation, isolated RNA from RIP samples was further fragmented for 7 min at 94\u02daC before first strand synthesis. 100 to 200 ng of each input and RIP sample was used for NGS libraries which were made using the TruSeq Stranded Total RNA library production kit (Illumina) according to the manufacturer's protocol.

Libraries were sequenced on 151 bp paired-end lanes on a HiSeq 3000 instrument (Illumina). m 6 A-IP-qPCR and RIP-qPCR m 6 A-IPs and RIPs were carried out as described above respectively, with the following modification. 1% input samples (10 ml from the 1 mL IP reaction) were removed before immunoprecipitation and stored at \u00c080\u02daC. Input samples were processed together with immunoprecipitated samples from the proteinase K treatment onwards. Purified input and immunoprecipitated RNA was resuspended in 10 ml of RNase-free water and reverse transcribed as described in the RT-qPCR analysis section. qPCR normalisation was performed similarly to chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) coupled to detection by qPCR analysis using DDCt method (relative quantification). An example for m 6 A-IPs follows. Each m 6 A-IP sample Ct value for each primer used was normalised to the corresponding input Ct value: DCt normalised m 6 A-IP = Ct m 6 A-IP -[Ct Input -log 2 (Input dilution factor)]. Input dilution factor = (fraction of the input reaction saved) \u00c01 . As 1% input was saved, the dilution factor is 100 or 6.644 cycles (i.e. log 2 of 100). Percentage of recovery from the initial reaction (% input) was then calculated for each primer as 100 x Amplification efficiency (AE) (-DCt normalised m6A-IP) . m 6 A enrichment was finally calculated as the fold change between the % input for a region containing m 6 A peaks over the % input for a negative control region. SND1 enrichment was calculated as the fold change between the % input for a region of interest over the % input for a region of a non-target control RNA such as 18S rRNA.

Peaks positions were considered overlapping between replicates if the calls were within 100 nucleotides between corresponding positions. To determine the number of SND1 RNA targets identified by transcript-wide analysis that are m 6 A-modified, a more stringent m 6 A peak calling cut-off was used to compliment a more stringent SND1 RIP cut-off, with a minimum of 100 read paired at the tallest point in the m 6 A peak and a 2-fold enrichment of m 6 A-IP reads over input reads using a FDR < 1%. For target overlap between heterologously expressed YTH readers and SND1, high-confidence SND1-bound genes (summarised at HGNC gene symbol annotation level, where multiple Ensembl genes mapped to a symbol, the longest was used) were defined at a cut-off of FDR < 1% and a minimum of 2-fold RIP enrichment over input, while m 6 A peaks were used as before (FDR < 5%, 1.5 fold minimum enrichment in both replicates).",

R package Rsubread (Liao et al., 2014) was used to obtain raw read counts as follows. Each uniquely mapping read pair was counted towards the total transcript count for each sample, while multi-mapping reads were counted as partial reads, based on the number of mapped positions. Since the library preparation protocol preserved the strand of the original RNA molecule, only 'correctly' stranded read pairs were counted for each transcript. DESeq2 R package (Love et al., 2014) was used to normalise the data and identify transcripts that showed a significant increase in the coverage of the normalised RIP samples when compared to the input controls. In order to increase the resolution of the SND1-bound regions, custom Java code was used that identified transcriptome regions that were enriched in the RIP data when compared to the control data. Initially, the application segmented regions into intronic or exonic sequences: a region was classified as exonic if the sequence was present in at least one mature transcript. The per-base raw read coverage was determined for both intronic and exonic sequences and normalised using the size factors determined from the earlier normalisation step (DESeq2) to account for library compositions and sizes. Using a sliding window approach, first each mature transcript or intron was divided into contiguous segments that loosely showed putative enrichment in the RIP data (>1 fold enrichment) compared to the input data and those that putatively were depleted in (or equal to) RIP ( 1 fold enrichment). Low coverage segments (<20 reads in RIP) were filtered out as quality control. All data from the different samples in the analysis were then merged to generate a single dataset that contained read depth data for all consensus segments identified this way, both intronic and exonic. Each segmented region was subsequently treated as an individual 'gene' for re-analysis using DESeq2, specifically testing for RIP signal enrichment over input (alternative hypothesis: normalised segment read coverage in RIP greater than in input) in order to identify regions with a significant increase in RIP over input signal.",

Tandem mass spectra were acquired using an LTQ-Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer controlled by Xcalibur 2.1 software (Thermo Scientific) and operated in data-dependent acquisition mode. The Orbitrap was set to analyse the survey scans at 60,000 resolution (at m/z 400) in the mass range m/z 300 to 2000 and the top twenty multiply charged ions in each duty cycle selected for MS/ MS in the LTQ linear ion trap. Charge state filtering, where unassigned precursor ions were not selected for fragmentation, and dynamic exclusion (repeat count, 1; repeat duration, 30 s; exclusion list size, 500) were used. Fragmentation conditions in the LTQ were as follows: normalised collision energy, 40%; activation q, 0.25; activation time 10 ms; and minimum ion selection intensity, 500 counts. The raw data files were processed and quantified using Proteome Discoverer software v1.4 (Thermo Scientific) and searched against the UniProt Human database (downloaded October 2015; 131351 sequences) plus KSHV protein sequences using the SEQUEST algorithm.

In brief, total RNA from cells was extracted using TRIzol (Thermo Scientific) according to the supplier's protocol. DNA-free DNA Removal Kit (Ambion) was used to remove any contaminating DNA from RNA samples. Reverse transcription was performed with ProtoScript II (NEB), murine RNase inhibitor (NEB), random hexamers (Bioline) and 1 mg of total RNA. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) reactions (20 ml) included 1 X SensiMix SYBR green master mix (Bioline), 0.5 mM of each primer and 5 ml template cDNA. Cycling was performed in a RotorGene Q 2plex machine (Qiagen). The cycling programme was a 10 min initial preincubation at 95\u02daC, followed by 40 cycles of 95\u02daC for 15 s, 60\u02daC for 30 s and 72\u02daC for 20 s. After qPCR, a melting curve analysis was performed between 65\u02daC and 95\u02daC (with 0.2C increments) to confirm amplification of a single product. To assess primer amplification efficiency (AE), for each gene of interest a standard curve was constructed using a pool of cDNA derived from unreactivated and reactivated cells. At least four different dilutions of pool cDNA were quantified to generate a standard curve. The slope of the standard curve was used to calculate the AE of the primers using the formula: AE = (10 \u00c01/slope ). For gene expression analysis all genes of interest were normalised against the housekeeping gene GAPDH (DC T ). A summary of all the primers used in this study is provided in Supplementary file 3. Primers specific to METTL3 have previously been described .",

(a) RNA-seq analysis reveals significant alterations in splicing events between scramble latent and scramble lytic TREx BCBL1-Rta cells (left panel), whilst no significant changes in splicing are observed between scramble and SND1-depleted cells during latency (middle panel) or 24 hr lytic replication (right panel). (b) TREx BCBL1-Rta cells were reactivated for 24 hr into the lytic cycle and transcription was inhibited with the addition of actinomycin D (2.5 mg/ml).
