New complications have however emerged as key issues within this population. HIV/ Hepatitis C virus (HCV) co-infection, for instance, affects more than 30% of HIVinfected patients in developed countries. Although the impact of HCV on HIV disease progression is minimal, it is known that HIV accelerates HCV-related liver disease [2, 3] . The effects of HIV on HCV infection include higher rate of viral persistence and increased HCV viral loads (VL). Studies have shown that HCV-associated liver diseases such as fibrosis, cirrhosis and end stage liver disease (ESLD) are accelerated in HIV-infected individuals [4] [5] [6] [7] .

The baseline was subtracted using a setting of 15 times the expected peak width. Noise was subtracted at 2,000 Da for low-energy and at 10,000 Da for high-energy acquisition. All data were normalized by total ion current for either low intensity (2 to 100 kDa) or high intensity (10 to 200 kDa) using an external coefficient of 0.2. Spectra with normalization factors of more than double the mean were deleted. Analyses were performed in two steps. First, automated peak detection was applied, using cluster features of Biomarker Wizard software (Bio-Rad). Cluster with p values <0.05 (Mann-Whitney U test) were visually inspected, followed by manual peak relabeling. After relabeling, exact p values for differences in average peak intensity between two groups were calculated (Wilcoxon exact test): 1) negative population with F1 (no/mild fibrosis), 2) positive population with F3-F4 (significant fibrosis). Peaks with p values < 0.05 and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) values > 0.75 or < 0.25 were considered as potential biomarkers. Biomarker Pattern software (Bio-Rad) analysis was applied to the cleaned cluster data. This program uses a supervised pattern classification method (classification and regression tree (CART)) to identify peaks with the greatest contribution to discrimination between groups. The CART procedure seeks to minimize a cost function that balances prediction errors in either sense and the total number of biomarkers used. The relative importance of each peak in any given algorithm is measured by the order in which it is selected in the decision tree and the number of correct predictions credited to it. Similar analysis was performed to find discriminator peaks between the four stages of fibrosis (F0-1, F2, F3 and F4).",

Our primary comparison was non-fibrotic patients (F1) to more advanced fibrotic patients (F3-F4) . Due to the relatively small number of samples in F4 group we pooled F3 and F4 groups together for analysis. Using Biomarker Wizard software, sixteen potential biomarkers with significant intensity difference and good area under curve (AUC) from ROC curve analysis were identified ( Table 2 ). Six of these individual biomarkers were down-regulated in the group with advanced fibrosis, while eight were up-regulated with moderate changes between the two groups (1.33 to 2.55-fold). When we tested the ability of these 14 biomarkers to differentiate patients with regards to their stage of liver fibrosis (F1, F2, F3 and F4), 8 out of 14 had significant intensity differences with a p value < 0.01. The three biomarkers demonstrating the most significant difference in expression (6.4, 9.3 and 66.6 k(m/z)) are shown in Fig 1. The cumulative data illustrate how changes in multiple protein biomarkers can be used as \"fingerprints\" reflective of a particular disease state. Similar analysis was performed with HCV mono-infected samples. Fourteen classifiers with significant intensity differences between F1 and F3-4 were identified (S1 Table) . Representative SELDI-MS spectra of the identified biomarkers can be found under S1 Fig. SELDI -TOF MS peak values are available in S1 File.",

We need to take into consideration that our reference point was the biopsy test done within the year of the sample collection and that biopsies are subject to sampling error and inter-observer variability. The aspirate aminotransferase (AST) to platelet ratio index (APRI) has been validated as a surrogate marker of significant hepatic fibrosis in HIV/HCV co-infection [34] .

Several studies have reported that co-infected individuals progress more rapidly to ESLD than mono infected individuals [4] [5] [6] [7] . Therefore, it is possible that biomarkers we observed in co-infection are, in fact, markers for accelerated fibrosis.

It is important to emphasize that, even though we have detected biomarkers that can be used to stage liver fibrosis in mono-and co-infected individuals, we cannot affirm that these biomarkers are specific for HCV-induced fibrosis. In order to establish specificity, we will need to validate our algorithms with non-HCV liver anomalies such as alcoholic liver disease, hepatitis B-induced fibrosis or HCC. It is very likely that several of our candidate biomarkers are 'general' markers for liver damage since most are liverderived and some have already been found in liver infection [21] . In addition, we observed 5 biomarkers that were present in both mono and co-infection and had a good correlation between them.

High-abundance proteins can mask the presence of lower-abundance proteins of either host or virus origin in MS studies. Some of the identified biomarkers proved to be fragments of full length of abundant proteins. These fragments may be products of the natural course of protein degradation or associated with the extent and/or type of infection. Future work will focus on identifying less abundant biomarkers, which could be host related or virally derived. The identification of a viral derived plasma biomarker could greatly enhance the specificity of our assay.",

As some have similar mass as the biomarkers we discovered by SELDI-TOF MS, it would be of interest to confirm these using immunocapture assay. In addition, Yang et al [41] found complement C4-a and inter-alpha-trypsin inhibition to heavy chain H4, as biomarker candidates for predicting hepatic fibrosis using Isobaric Tags for Relative and Absolute Quantitation (iTRAQ) and differential gel electrophoresis (DIGE). The authors also found ApoA1, Ig kappa chain C region, haptoglobin and others as potential biomarker candidates. However, this study only included pooled serum samples of 24 people with chronic HCV and 6 non-infected individuals. Using SELDI-TOF MS serum profiling, Schwelgle et al [23] found 4 biomarkers (5.8, 8.9, 9.5 and 11.7 k(m/z)) that helped differentiate between healthy controls and HCC patients. In this study, they did not fractionate samples but they concentrated on low-mass proteins that have a metal-binding affinity. Our study differs significantly in that we only tested HCV infected individuals, we looked at high-and low-mass proteins after fractionation of the samples and we used 3 different types of ProteinChips (metal binding, weak cation exchange, and hydrophobic/reverse-phase).",

As expected we did not observe either absence or presence of specific biomarkers/peaks but rather a gradual difference in plasma levels of certain peptides/proteins at the different stages of liver fibrosis. It would be interesting to see if by scaling each biomarker and adding to obtain a score, we could accomplish a better correlation with the stage of liver fibrosis in these patients. The CCC study has enrolled co-infected individuals since 2003. We are in the process of studying longitudinal changes of these biomarkers in co-infected individuals during the progression of fibrosis. In addition, we wonder if these biomarkers may vary after treatment of HCV infection as it has been shown with other markers [42, 43] .",
