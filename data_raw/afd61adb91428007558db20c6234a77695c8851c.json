Nasopharyngeal samples were screened for 13 respiratory viruses using Multiplex-PCRs. Influenza B-confirmed cases were genotyped by Haemagglutinin gene sequencing. We analyzed the clinicalepidemiological characteristics of influenza B Lineages (Victoria/Yamagata) and WHO Groups. Results: In the pre-A/H1N1pdm09 period, influenza B-associated ARI hospitalization incidence among children under five was low, ranging between 14.7 and 80.7 per 100 000 population. The incidence increased to between 51.4 and 330 in the post-A/H1N1pdm09. Influenza B ARI cases were slightly older with milder symptoms. Both Victoria and Yamagata lineages were detected before the A/H1N1pdm09 outbreak; however, Victoria lineage became predominant in 2010-2013 (84% Victoria vs 16% Yamagata). Victoria and Yamagata lineages did not differ in demographic and clinical characteristics. In Victoria lineage, Group1 ARI cases were clinically more severe compared to Group5, presenting a greater proportion of wheeze, tachypnea, and lower respiratory tract infection. Conclusions: The current results highlight the increased incidence of influenza Brelated ARI hospitalization among children in central Vietnam in the post-A/ H1N1pdm09 era. Furthermore, the difference in clinical severity between Victoria lineage Group1 and 5 implies the importance of influenza B genetic variation on clinical presentation. | 249 YOSHIHARA et Al.",

            "text": "Influenza viruses belong to the family Orthomyxoviridae, which possess a segmented negative-stranded RNA genome. 1,2 Among three influenza types, namely, type-A, B and C, influenza A and B often cause seasonal acute respiratory infections (ARI) epidemics and impose a high socioeconomic burden, particularly among children and the elderly population. 3, 4 In temperate climate regions, peaks of influenza-associated ARIs may appear in early autumn through winter, 5 whereas year-round circulation with no apparent seasonal trend may be seen in tropical climate regions. [6] [7] [8] [9] Influenza B differs from type-A in terms of genetic composition and its ability to infect only humans and seals. 10, 11 Two surface glycoproteins, Haemagglutinin (HA) and Neuraminidase (NA), play pivotal roles during pathogenesis. 12 Unlike influenza A, influenza B does not possess multiple subtypes. Instead, influenza B obtains its genetic variation mainly through genetic drift, including nucleotide substitutions, insertions, and deletions, which explains the slower molecular evolutionary rate and smaller capacity to cause seasonal ARI outbreaks compared to influenza A. 13, 14 Genetic reassortment of influenza B genetic components was previously documented 15 ; however, its frequency is not as high as that of influenza A due to its limited animal reservoir.",

A study from Taiwan suggested switching of dominantly circulating lineage may occur every 2-3 years. 18 In the future study, we will continue monitoring the lineage-specific circulation trend of influenza B strains in order to investigate the lineagespecific viral transmissibility based on the viral genetic variation.",

Furthermore, clinical aspect of influenza B lineages is poorly understood. In the current study, the clinical data did not present a significant difference between lineages (Table 3) , which was in line with previous reports from China, France, Serbia, and Slovenia. 41, [45] [46] [47] [48] Although the body temperature was slightly higher in Yamagata lineage ARIs, it was probably due to the difference in age distribution.

During the study period, both influenza A and B ARI hospitalizations were frequently detected in children younger than 2 years. The first A/H1N1pdm09-associated ARI hospitalization case was reported in July 2009. 32 Noticeably, the incidence of influenza B ARI hospitalization in the post-A/H1N1pdm09 period increased dramatically, particularly in 2010 and 2012. Furthermore, Victoria lineage was dominant in post-A/H1N1pdm09, and the dominantly circulating WHO Group shifted each year. Importantly, Victoria lineage WHO Group 1-associated ARIs were clinically more severe in comparison with Group 5, presenting greater proportions in wheeze, tachypnea, and LRTI. Therefore, our current results highlight both the increased clinical importance of influenza B among paediatric ARI hospitalizations in central Vietnam in the post-A/H1N1pdm09 period and the difference in respiratory-related clinical severity among WHO Groups of Victoria lineage, which could help in the future nationwide influenza vaccination program and for proper clinical management in hospital settings.

One possible explanation is the distinct amino acid composition within HA gene of Victoria lineage Groups may possess Group-specific binding preference to sialic acid (SA)-galactose linkage, \u03b12,3 or \u03b12,6. It was previously described that few amino acid substitutions in HA glycoprotein could affect receptor binding specificity.51 For example, Asp-225-Gly substitution of A/H1N1pdm09 strain resulted in increased binding affinity to \u03b12,3-SA linkage, which enhanced disease severity.[52][53][54] It is important to investigate the clinical role of two amino acid substitutions within major antigenic regions betweenF I G U R E 2 Seasonal circulation pattern of WHO Groups in Victoria lineage (top) and Yamagata lineage (bottom) from February 2007 to June 2013. A cumulative number of influenza B lineage-specific paediatric ARI hospitalizations in each month was shown as the BLACK solid line. WHO Groups classification for each influenza B lineage is based on Worldwide Influenza Centre (WIC). WHO Group-specific ARI hospitalizations were presented as the boxes with different colors: Victoria lineage (GREY for Group 1, GREY-stripe for Group 4 and BLACK for Group 5) and Yamagata lineage (BLACK for Group 2 and GREY for Group 3).

Therefore, the pathological and clinical importance of Victoria lineage Group-specific amino acid composition within HA glycoprotein antigenic regions needs to be further investigated. As one of the limitations in the clinical manifestation comparison of WHO groups, we were not capable of performing multivariate analysis adjusting for confounding variables due to the small sample size in each Group. Since the presence of an underlying medical condition was described to be one of the major risk factors for developing severe influenza B-related ARI infection, 46 our primary clinical finding of the association of Victoria lineage Group 1 with clinical severity, should be carefully interpreted as its severity could have been effected by the higher prevalence of an underlying medical condition in Group 1. Co-infection with other respiratory viruses should be taken into account in future analysis as the frequency of co-infection with other respiratory pathogens were relatively high in both WHO Group 1 and 5, rate of which was comparable to previous studies. 55,56 Some previous studies have described the importance of viral co-infection on clinical outcome. 57,58 Bacterial co-infection among influenza ARIs is also known to be the risk factor for developing severe clinical manifestation. 59 However, we did not conduct bacteria detection in the current study. Nevertheless, WBC count did not differ among Groups. In future studies, it would be important to elucidate the biological role of bacterial coinfection on influenza B infections. Lastly, we did not obtain clinical data from those who did not require hospitalization, which made it difficult to estimate the clinical importance of influenza B as well as viral transmissibility. In the future study, we would collect data from mild ARIs and healthy children in the target community to gain a better understanding of the clinical role of influenza B.",
