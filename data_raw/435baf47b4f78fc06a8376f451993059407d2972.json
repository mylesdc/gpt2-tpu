            "text": "Background. Effective influenza surveillance requires new methods capable of rapid and inexpensive genomic analysis of evolving viral species for pandemic preparedness, to understand the evolution of circulating viral species, and for vaccine strain selection. We have developed one such approach based on previously described broad-range reverse transcription PCR/ electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (RT-PCR/ESI-MS) technology. Methods and Principal Findings. Analysis of base compositions of RT-PCR amplicons from influenza core gene segments (PB1, PB2, PA, M, NS, NP) are used to provide subspecies identification and infer influenza virus H and N subtypes. Using this approach, we detected and correctly identified 92 mammalian and avian influenza isolates, representing 30 different H and N types, including 29 avian H5N1 isolates. Further, direct analysis of 656 human clinical respiratory specimens collected over a seven-year period (1999)(2000)(2001)(2002)(2003)(2004)(2005)(2006) showed correct identification of the viral species and subtypes with .97% sensitivity and specificity. Base composition derived clusters inferred from this analysis showed 100% concordance to previously established clades. Ongoing surveillance of samples from the recent influenza virus seasons (2005)(2006) showed evidence for emergence and establishment of new genotypes of circulating H3N2 strains worldwide. Mixed viral quasispecies were found in approximately 1% of these recent samples providing a view into viral evolution. Conclusion/Significance. Thus, rapid RT-PCR/ESI-MS analysis can be used to simultaneously identify all species of influenza viruses with clade-level resolution, identify mixed viral populations and monitor global spread and emergence of novel viral genotypes. This high-throughput method promises to become an integral component of influenza surveillance.",

Annual influenza epidemics resulted in more than 30,000 deaths a year in the United States during 1990-1999 [1, 2] . Periodic pandemics result in significantly higher death tolls. Emergence of new influenza A virus strains can be caused by ''antigenic shift,'' resulting from reassortment of gene segments, including H and/or N types [3, 4] , ''antigenic drift'' resulting from the continuing accumulation of mutations in the H and N genes [5] , or a pathogenic virus jumping species and acquiring the ability to infect and be transmitted among humans, as in the 1918 pandemic [6] . The recent outbreak of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus (HPAI), which originated in Southeast Asia and has since spread globally, has resulted in 166 deaths (272 confirmed human cases) as of February 6, 2007 (http://www.who. int/en/). The global emergence of this virus has brought renewed urgency to the effort to track the spread and the evolution of influenza viruses.",

            "text": "Currently, rapid methods for influenza virus diagnosis rely on antigen-specific antibody probes [7] , or real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) analysis of the matrix (M) gene for identification of the viral species [8, 9] followed by H and N subtype specific RT-PCR assays for determination of the viral subtypes [10, 11] . Since there are many H and N subtypes with significant intra-and inter-subtype sequence variations, these methods do not identify all H and N subtypes, nor are they likely to identify reassortants or newly emerging genetic variants. Further, none of the current surveillance methods provide information relevant to tracking antigenically novel strains that emerge each year or distinguish amongst multiple lineages of influenza viruses that can co-circulate and persist in a popula-tion [12] . Secondary genome sequence comparisons and phylogenetic analyses are necessary to fully understand the multiple lineages of viruses, recognize newly emergent influenza variants, and monitor global spread of these viruses [12, 13] . For instance, analysis of human influenza virus H3N2 sequences from 1999-2004 revealed that at least three major clades of influenza viruses were in circulation after the 2002-2003 influenza season [12] . The differences were due to multiple reassortment events though all shared a common H-gene lineage. Several similar wholegenome studies with avian influenza viruses have revealed the presence of multiple, region-specific sub-lineages of the HPAI H5N1 virus in Southeast Asia that are spreading to Europe and Africa [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] .",

At one end of the spectrum, a conventional RT-PCR test with specific primers and probes provides a highlyspecific, sensitive, rapid, convenient, quantitative, relatively inexpensive, and high-throughput format that can provide valuable surveillance information. However, these tests are not optimal for surveillance when the exact nature of the pandemic virus is not known. Moreover, without supplemental nucleic acid sequencing, conventional RT-PCR-based tests are not capable of signaling the appearance of new genetic variants, except by potentially demonstrating a loss of sensitivity. Further, a single RT-PCR test can achieve only a single presence/absence analysis limited to the specific target for which it was designed. Discrimination of all known variants of influenza at the level of resolution described here would require hundreds of independent RT-PCR reactions. At the other end of the spectrum, virus isolation using culture methods followed by complete genome sequencing does not require prior knowledge of the virus' sequence and provides cladelevel resolution and highly detailed information regarding virus evolution. Unfortunately, this method is slow, labor intensive, expensive, and low throughput, rendering it ineffective in public health arenas requiring rapid response.",

Ten rare sequence types (,1.5%) were not uniquely discernable by the base composition analysis of the eight amplicons used in this analysis, as more than one subtype produced the same BC-type. These BC-types are indicated by asterisks. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0000489.g003 populations of viruses, either as viral quasispecies as previously illustrated (i.e., development of ''drift'' strains) or co-infections with circulating strains (i.e., potential for development of ''shift'' strains). Recent advances in ESI-MS using bench-top mass spectrometers have enabled analysis of PCR amplicons with sufficient mass accuracy that the nucleotide base composition (the A, G, C, and T count) of the PCR amplicon can be unambiguously determined [23] . The approach outlined here provides two important advantages for surveillance. First, broad-range primers targeted to highly-conserved sites within the influenza virus family that flank highly variable, information-rich regions can be used to amplify sequences from highly diverse viruses in the same assay. The measured base compositions allow identification of the viral species with a high degree of resolution. For this approach, we selected primer pairs targeting the core gene segments (PB1, PB2, PA, M, NS, and NP) that have conserved regions spanning all known influenza viruses and used the resultant base compositions to infer the influenza virus H/N types. In silico analysis of influenza virus sequences from the GenBank database showed that this approach would detect all known influenza viruses and distinguish .90% of all species and types. This overcomes the limitations of directly targeting the H and N segments, which requires specific primer pairs for each known H/N type. Further, since the H/N segments evolve rapidly, newly emerging strains might not be readily detected by the traditional approach.",

The use of RT-PCR/ESI-MS for human as well as avian/ animal surveillance offers the potential for new insights into viral evolution on a scale and at a cost previously not possible. Benchtop mass spectrometers are capable of analyzing complex PCR products at a rate of approximately one reaction product/minute, making the RT-PCR/ESI-MS technology practical for large-scale analysis of clinical specimens or for animal surveillance. Further, as we have demonstrated with influenza viruses, this method provides sensitive detection directly from patient specimens with specificity approximating sequence-level resolution. The ability to quantitate virus shedding, detect low-abundance, mixed infections, and identify new genetic variants without prior knowledge of viral sequence also make this technology ideally suited for monitoring the emergence of drug-resistance mutations during therapy or for identifying newly emerging antigenic variants. Sample processing Viral stock samples consisting of cultured virus or stocks obtained from ATCC were prepared for analysis using the Qiagen QiaAmp Virus kit (Valencia, CA).

Briefly, the steps were as follows: 15 mL aliquots of each PCR reaction were desalted and purified using a weak anion exchange protocol as described elsewhere [25] . Accurate mass (61 ppm), high-resolution (M/dM.100,000 FWHM) mass spectra were acquired for each sample using high-throughput ESI-MS protocols described previously [20] . For each sample, approximately 1.5 mL of analyte solution was consumed during the 74-second spectral acquisition. Raw mass spectra were post-calibrated with an internal mass standard and deconvolved to monoisotopic molecular masses. Unambiguous base compositions were derived from the exact mass measurements of the complementary single-stranded oligonucleotides [26] . Quantitative results are obtained by comparing the peak heights with an internal PCR calibration standard present in every PCR well at 100 molecules [20] .",

            "text": "To demonstrate the capabilities of RT-PCR/ESI-MS to track the evolution of circulating influenza viruses, we used a bioinformatic approach to develop a framework on which to display the RT-PCR/ ESI-MS results obtained with H3N2 viruses. Complete genome sequences of all H3N2 human influenza viruses available in GenBank were analyzed. A total of 731 genomes were included, from which we inferred the phylogeny of H3N2 influenza virus since 1996. Using the 565-nucleotide concatenated sequence of the six loci that we analyzed by RT-PCR/ESI-MS, we constructed a nonredundant alignment of 105 sequence types. Base compositions were determined for each genome segment (i.e., locus) analyzed and each unique base composition at each of these loci was assigned a letter according to decreasing number of occurrences (therefore, the letter A represents the most common allele identified at each locus). The concatenation of the six base-composition letters from the PB1, NP, M1, PA, NS1, and NS2 loci from the sequences of 731 H3N2 viruses (1996) (1997) (1998) (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) available in GenBank yielded 95 six-letter codes referred to as base composition types (BC types). The predominant type is labeled AAAAAA. The topology of the tree was then deduced from the alignment of non-redundant sequences using the programs dnadist and neighbor from the Phylip package (http://evolution. genetics.washington.edu/phylip.html). Since the sequence types differ mostly by discrete single mutations, the original computergenerated tree was then extensively edited using graphics tools to place the labels of intermediate types within the tree itself in lieu of zero-length branches. Readability was further improved by sorting parallel branches chronologically. Table S1 Influenza virus primer pairs used in this study. Genbank reference sequence for each segment is indicated; however, the primer sequences are not identical to the reference sequence as described in the Methods. The limits of detection for each RT-PCR primer pair were determined using known quantities of a synthetic calibrant RNA template.

Unique base compositions at each genome segment locus analyzed were assigned letter codes and concatenation of letter codes across the six loci analyzed yielded BC-types. H1N1 samples were not assigned a BC-type. Experimentally determined BC-types (marked RT-PCR/ESI-MS Analysis results) were compared to BC-type signature information of sequences currently available in GenBank and the closest matching strain is shown (right pane).

The tree was further expanded by the addition of 174 influenza A H3N2 base compositions, resulting in 29 distinct base composition types (BC types), from samples collected in North America during the 2005-2006 season (Figure 3, red). The most abundant BC type observed in 2005-2006 (AADFAA, 97 instances) was also one of the more abundant BC types from the previous winter flu season in the southern hemisphere (e.g., A/ Canterbury/125/2005; Figure 3, 2005 South), suggesting that this BC type from the southern hemisphere might have been the founder of the 2005-2006 BC types in the northern hemisphere. Most of the other BC types observed in the 2005-2006 season were within one or two mutations of this major BC type, suggesting that these might have been derived from AADFAA through mutations during the 2005-2006 season. A second BCtype (AABFAA), which differs from AADFAA by a single mutation in the M1 locus, was also observed in the 2005 South and 2005-2006 North seasons and was potentially the founder of several additional BC types observed in 2005-2006.
