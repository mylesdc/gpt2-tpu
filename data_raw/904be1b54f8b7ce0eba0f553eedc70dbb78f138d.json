            "text": "Given the importance of microbiology results on patient care, high quality standards are expected. Internal quality assurance (IQA) could mitigate the limitations of internal quality control, competency assessment and external quality assurance, adding a longitudinal insight, including pre-and post-analytical steps. Here, we implemented an IQA program in our clinical microbiology facilities with blind resubmission of routine samples during 22 months. One-hundred-and-twenty-one out of 123 (98.4%) serological analyses and 112 out of 122 (91.8%) molecular analyses were concordant. Among the discordances in molecular biology analyses, 6 results were low positive samples that turned out negative, likely due to stochastic repartition of nucleic acids. Moreover, one identified retranscription error led us to implement automated results transmission from the Applied Biosystems instruments to the laboratory information system (LIS). Regarding Gram stain microscopy, 560 out of 745 (75.2%) of compared parameters were concordant. As many as 67 out of 84 (79.8%) pairs of culture results were similar, including 16 sterile pairs, 27 having identical identification or description and semi-quantification and 24 only showing variations in semi-quantification with identical description or identification of colonies. Seventeen pairs had diverging identification or description of colonies. Culture was twice only done for one member of the pairs. Regarding antibiotic susceptibility testing, a major discrepancy was observed in 5 out of 48 results (10.4%). In conclusion, serological tests were highly reproducible. Molecular diagnosis also revealed to be robust except when the amounts of nucleic acids present in the sample were close to the limits of detection. Conventional microbiology was less robust with major discrepancies reaching 39.5% of the samples for microscopy. Similarly, culture and antibiotic susceptibility testing were prone to discrepancies. This work was ground for reconsidering multiples aspects of our practices and demonstrates the importance of IQA to complete the other quality management procedures.",

This approach was retained to increase the number of samples for which the adequacy of bacterial identification and antibiotics susceptibility could be investigated. The analysis request forms were replicated with anonymous identification data, which are commonly used in our institution for clinical research purposes (and thus not assimilated by our technician to a quality control). Part of the original sample material was taken into a new container and handed back in secret at the reception of the laboratories. The correspondence between the patient identification code and the replicate identification code was reported by the head technicians into a database for later comparison of the results.

We examined the discrepancies for each parameter by linearly weighted Kappa score using GraphPad QuickCalcs website [35] . Kappa score quantifies the level of correspondence between the ratings of two observers, considering the natural probability to obtain the same level of concordance only by chance [36] . The weighted version of Kappa score is used to consider the partial agreements within ordered scales [37] .

The 123 tests were often completed within panels of multiple tests detecting antibody reactivity for the same pathogen (in total 76 different pathogen-specific panels), sometimes reducing the negative impact of discordant results. Thus, this first discordant result was accompanied by electrochemiluminescence (ECLIA) results, which were both times positive for anti-CMV IgG antibodies (4.84 and 4.78 U/ ml with a cutoff of 1 for positivity). The second discordant pair of results was in the titers of a syphilis test (TPPA) obtained manually, being twice positive but with titers of 1/2'560 initially and 1/10'240 when redone. The clinical impact was considered significant in this 2 nd case since a high titer of 1/10'240 generally reflects an acute infection and since this difference of two dilutions might be considered as clinically relevant [40, 41] .

These 5 discordant results corresponding to EBV in blood (n = 3) and BKV in blood and urine (n = 2) DNA amplifications could be explained by stochastic repartition of nucleic acids in the samples. The remaining qualitatively discordant result corresponded to the detection of a coronavirus in a nasopharyngeal secretion, initially positive at 2280 copies/ml with a Ct of 36.6, and negative when redone (Fig 1c) . Even though all these six qualitative discrepancies were expected since being below the level of sensitivity of our PCRs, we considered that such results may have a significantly different clinical impact ( Table 1 ). The analysis conducted on the effect of time on the discrepancy level was inconclusive because of the small number of discordant results. The average time between original testing and replication was longer for concordant results than for discrepant. Concerning the four quantitative discordances out of the 23 samples pairs that included quantitative results, a Bordetella pertussis detection in a nasopharyngeal secretion was discordant both considering the bacterial load (2700 copies/ml versus 260 copies/ml) and the Ct values (34.6 versus 39.5) (Fig 1d) . However, this difference was not considered clinically significant (Table 1) . A Parainfluenza 2 also tested in a nasopharyngeal secretion was initially reported at 505'000 copies/ml and then reported at only 50'000 copies/ml when redone, a difference not considered to be associated with a significant clinical impact; this one log 10 difference in viral load quantification was likely due to a technical error when redone since the CT difference was of 2.4 (31.0 versus 33.4) (Fig 1e and Table 1 ). The third quantitatively discordant result corresponded to the detection of HSV-1 in a vaginal swab with a viral load of 9.6\u00d710 10 copies/ml versus 1.6\u00d710 8 copies/ml, a difference identified to be due to a human Represented are low positive versus negative results (n = 5, diamonds); moderate positive versus negative results (n = 1, square), quantitative discrepancies with over one log 10 difference in copies/ml (straight triangles, n = 3), quantitative discrepancy with difference over 3.3Ct but less than one log10 (reversed triangle, n = 1); agreeing positive results (rounds, n = 20). 92 negative agreeing results are not represented on this figure.

            "text": "Regarding microscopy of the Gram stains, 32 out of 81 (39.5%) pairs exhibited at least one major discrepancy (Tables 1 and 2) , mainly due to discordances in the reported quantities of red blood cells (19.8%), leukocytes (8.6%) and Gram-positive cocci (8.6%) ( Table 2) . Major discordances were observed in 5.3%, 4.9% and 3.7% for Gram-negative coccobacilli, Gramnegative bacilli and Gram-positive bacilli, respectively ( Table 2 ). Overall agreement of the microscopy was of 75.2% (560/745) of all evaluated parameters, whereas the occurrence of a major error occurred in 6.4% of cases (48/745) (Tables 1 and 2 ). However, this relatively high overall agreement rate should be weighted by the common negativity of some parameters such as Gram-positive diplococci (100% of negativity), yeasts (96.3%) and Gram-negative coccobacilli (93.0%). Thus, after excluding those parameters, the obtained overall agreement would drop significantly from 75.2% to 67.6%. True rate of concordance is better assessed by weighted Kappa scores, shown in Table 2 for each parameter. As many as 13 out of 71 (18.3%) samples exhibiting at least one discrepancy were considered as having a clinically relevant discordance, corresponding to a rate of 16.0% (13/81) for all Gram stain results investigated ( Table 1) . The discrepancies were considered by our experts to be possibly related to reading or reporting errors in 8 out of 13 significant and in 11 out of 58 negligible discrepant pairs of samples, while the rest seemed compatible with natural biological variations (e.g. sample and coloration heterogeneity). It should also be noted that for two samples, the Gram stain reading was done only for one of the replicates because of pre-analytical disagreement on the aspect of urine (urines are examined under microscopy only if considered cloudy). Regarding the effect of the time delay between the management of the original samples and their replicates, no significant differences were observed, when comparing the identical and negligible discrepant results versus the minor and major discrepant results. This absence of difference was recovered both when comparing all parameters together and bacteria and yeasts only. Culture results were perfectly identical for 43 pairs of samples, 16 of which were twice sterile (Tables 1 and 3 ). For 24 other pairs of samples, the results showed only negligible or minor discrepancies within semi-quantitative scoring of similarly identified or described colonies, whereas 17 pairs showed discrepancies within the identification or description of colonies, as detailed in Table 3 . To be noted, two pairs of samples for which cultures were accomplished only for one member of the pair: once due to diverging microscopy results with a potentially significant impact and once to an error in procedure with negligible impact (Table 3) . Also noteworthy, three cases in which the differences in microscopy results motivated the additional inoculation of Gram-positive selective agar, explaining why supplementary clinicallysignificant strains (Enterococcus faecalis or Staphylococcus aureus) were recovered from cultures (Table 3) . Interestingly, when comparing the time delay from original samples processing to management of the replicates, the delay was significantly longer for samples that included minor or major discrepancies in culture growth versus the ones that were identical or negligibly discrepant (14.68 hours \u00b1 2.45 versus 9.19 hours \u00b1 1.13, p = 0.039).",

The clinical significance of the 8 AST panels not performed in presence of identical culture results is negligible, especially since 5 of them were accompanied in transmitted results by a comment suggesting to the clinician to ask for AST via telephone if needed. Nevertheless, this difference in attitude could possibly influence the clinical interpretation by unexperimented practitioners. On the contrary, 14 out of 15 of the identified bacteria that led to diverging presence of AST were considered as significant (species marked by \u00c3 in Tables 3 and 5) When AST were compared individually, each tested antibiotic one by one, the overall agreement was as high as 96.7% (734/759). There were 15 minor (sensitive versus intermediate or intermediate versus resistant) and 10 major (sensitive versus resistant) discrepancies. Piperacillin-tazobactam was the antibiotic the most often discrepant, with 3 major and 2 minor discrepancies. Detailed analysis of AST results, ordered by antibiotics, is shown in Fig 2, which represents concordances and discordances for antibiotics tested at least 10 times.

            "text": "Strain presence discrepancy considered as significant in culture ( In molecular biology, the usage of IQA samples shows the common occurrence of discrepancies (10/122 analyses, Fig 1) . Most discrepant results were due to the stochastic variability of qPCR occurring around the limit of detection, where by definition qPCRs lose part of their sensitivity [42] . Accordingly, these discrepancies should not be considered as technical errors or insufficiencies. Yet, this variability for weakly positive samples may be overlooked by clinicians who often give too much importance to negative results, even when the negative predictive value is known to be low (i.e. for M. tuberculosis detection and for Listeria PCR in cerebrospinal fluid). While such discrepancies are of limited implication in terms of quality assurance, the single quantitative discrepancy of a 610-folds factor between copies/ml, with almost identical Ct number, was worrisome. Investigations revealed that this difference was the consequence of an error in the manual transcription of the result. In this specific situation, this error did not have clinical impact, since both results would be interpreted as highly positive by clinicians. However, this error highlighted a weak point in our procedures and led us to integrate our automated PCR system with a middleware capable of two directions data transfers from the Applied Biosystems PCR machine to the LIS, in order to definitively abolish any risk of human errors during results retranscription. Made worthy, no false positive seem to have resulted from PCR contaminations. This is particularly remarkable considering the high sensitivity of PCR and likely results from the advanced automatization of our qPCR platform [19] . Moreover, our IQA process proved itself useful to detect potential errors in this laboratory.",

Thus, our experts (GGR and CDU) could only subjectively assess the most likely origin of the discrepancies. Errors were typically suspected when discrepancies were not compatible with biological variations because they were of very large amplitude or when confusion was suspected (e.g. ++++ Gram-positive cocci versus ++++ erythrocytes). Nevertheless, the factors leading to result heterogeneity and errors are numerous for Gram stains. Indeed, the important heterogeneity of samples such as sputa or fragments and the heterogeneity induced by the staining process can already bring a lot of variability before the reading phase itself, which is a task known as subjective and complex. Moreover, despite the high proportion of discrepant cases, our experts concluded that most of them would have no clinical impact, mainly because they involved host cell quantifications and not detection of bacteria (Table 1) . Furthermore, the clinical impact of Gram stains itself is subject to discussion, as for the diagnosis of pneumonia [48, 49] . Nevertheless, if the importance of Gram results can be relativized, our work also showed that discrepancies in microscopy results can influence subsequent analytical steps, with significant impact on final culture and AST results transmitted to the clinicians (Tables 3 and 5) .",

The technicians of this facility are routinely checking anterior results from the tested patients to integrate the new results within their serological status. Because we were using a limited pool of anonymous patient profiles, our technicians eventually faced multiple anterior results corresponding to IQA samples processed earlier. Both the visual difference of samples and the anterior results from anonymous patient's profile led to strong suspicions of the staff working in the serology laboratory about our ongoing experimental IQA process, which finally obliged us to discontinue the IQA in this laboratory. This specific issue did not concern the two other facilities where our process could be completed in secret and on samples that were not pretreated. Despite this limitation, we consider that our process could still have an interest for IQA in serology laboratories, but that it would need to be partly redesigned. A proposition would be to duplicate samples before their arrival in the laboratory. It would solve the problem of visual impact and improve the coverage of pre-analytical steps.
