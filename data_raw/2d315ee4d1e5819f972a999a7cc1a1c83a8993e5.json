            "text": "Background: Large RNA molecules are often composed of multiple functional domains whose spatial arrangement strongly influences their function. Pre-mRNA splicing, for instance, relies on the spatial proximity of the splice junctions that can be separated by very long introns. Similar effects appear in the processing of RNA virus genomes. Albeit a crude measure, the distribution of spatial distances in thermodynamic equilibrium harbors useful information on the shape of the molecule that in turn can give insights into the interplay of its functional domains. Result: Spatial distance can be approximated by the graph-distance in RNA secondary structure. We show here that the equilibrium distribution of graph-distances between a fixed pair of nucleotides can be computed in polynomial time by means of dynamic programming. While a na\u00efve implementation would yield recursions with a very high time complexity of O(n 6 D 5 ) for sequence length n and D distinct distance values, it is possible to reduce this to O(n 4 ) for practical applications in which predominantly small distances are of of interest. Further reductions, however, seem to be difficult. Therefore, we introduced sampling approaches that are much easier to implement. They are also theoretically favorable for several real-life applications, in particular since these primarily concern long-range interactions in very large RNA molecules. Conclusions: The graph-distance distribution can be computed using a dynamic programming approach. Although a crude approximation of reality, our initial results indicate that the graph-distance can be related to the smFRET data.

            "text": "In contrast to the end-to-end distance, the graphdistance between two arbitrarily prescribed nucleotides in a larger RNA structure does not seem to have been studied in any detail. However, this is of particular interest in the analysis of single-molecule fluorescence resonance http://www.almob.org/content/9/1/19 energy transfer (smFRET) experiments [10] . This technique allows to monitor the distance between two dyelabeled nucleotides and can reveal details of the kinetics of RNA folding in real time. It measures the non-radiative energy transfer between the dye-labeled donor and acceptor positions. The efficiency of this energy transfer, E fret , strongly depends on the spatial distance R according to E fret = R 6 0 /(R 6 0 + R 6 ). The F\u00f6rster radius R 0 sets the length scale, e.g. R 0 \u2248 54 \u00c5 for the Cy3-Cy5 dye pair. A major obstacle is that, at present, there is no general and efficient way to link smFRET measurements to interpretations in terms of explicit molecular structures. To solve this problem, a natural first step is to compute the distribution of spatial distances for an equilibrium ensemble of 3D structures. Since this is not feasible in practice despite major progress in the field of RNA 3D structure prediction [11] , we can only resort to considering the graph-distances on the ensemble of RNA secondary structures instead. From a computer science point of view, furthermore, we show here that the distance distribution can be computed exactly using a dynamic programming approach. Although a crude approximation of reality, our initial results indicate that the graphdistance can be related to the smFRET data such as those reported by [12] and help to explain effects of RNA structures in pre-mRNA splicing and viral subgenomic RNA species.",

Condition (W) and property (ii) of the secondary structure graphs implies http://www.almob.org/content/9/1/19 b < 3a because the closing base pair must be shorter than a hairpin loop. Furthermore, considering a stacked pair we need b < b + 2a, i.e. a > 0. We allow the degenerate case b = 0 that neglects the traversals of base pairs. Before we continue with the calculations of the partition function, let us first consider the problem formulation in more detail. For the FRET application, it is well-known that FRET efficiency is correlated with spatial distance. Furthermore, only a limited range of distance changes (e.g. 20 \u00c5-100 \u00c5 for Cy3-Cy5) can be reported by the FRET experiments. Thus a more useful formulation of our problem is not to use the full expected quantity for all positions. Instead, we are interested in the average for all distance-values within some threshold \u03b8 d . As the space and time complexity will depend on the number of distances we consider, we will parametrise our complexity by the number of nucleotides n and the number of distances considered D = \u03b8 d + 1, as well. In the worst case, there is D = O(n). However, given that in practice only a limited range of distance changes are considered, we rather view D = O(1) as a small constant in our contribution. [15] , Q and related quantities can be computed in quartic time. A reduction to a cubic algorithm may be obtained if the free energy of long interior loops may be regarded as prohibitive. This restriction has been widely used for long sequences [16] . Cubic runtime can also be achieved for some but not all parametrizations of interior loop energies [17] .",

Consider Figure 1 , the shortest path between the green and blue regions includes some vertices outside the interval between these two regions. The basic idea is to generalize Equation (1) to computing the partition function Z v,w [d] . The main question now becomes how to recurse over decompositions of both the inside and the outside paths. Figure 1 shows that the outside paths are important for the green region, i.e., the region that is covered by an arc.

As an example, we consider the graph distance distribution of a Diels-Alderase (DAse) ribozyme (Figure 2A ). Histograms of smFRET efficiency (E fret ) for this 49 nt long catalytic RNA are reported in [12] for a large number of surface-immobilized ribozyme molecules as a function of the Mg 2+ concentration in the buffer solution. A sketch of their histograms is displayed in Figure 2B . The dyes are attached to sequence positions 6 (Cy3) and 42 (Cy5) and hence do not simply reflect the end-toend distance, Figure 2A (c). In this example, we observe the expected correspondence small graph-distances with a strong smFRET signal. This is a particular interesting example, since the minimal free energy (mfe) structure (Figure 2A(a) ) predicted with RNAfold is not identified with the real secondary structure (Figure 2A(c) ). In fact, the ground state secondary structure is ranked as the 3rd best sub-optimal structure derived via RNAsubopt -e. The free energy difference between these two structures is only 0.1 kcal/mol. However, their graph-distances show a relatively larger difference. The 2nd best sub-optimal structure (Figure 2A(b) ) looks rather similar with the 3rd structure, in particular, they share the same graphdistance value.",

In the absence of Mg 2+ , the I state dominates, and only small fractions are found in states U and F. Unfortunately, the salt dependence of RNA folding is complex [21, 22] and currently is not properly modeled in the available folding programs. We can, however, make use of the qualitative correspondence of low salt concentrations with high temperature. In Figure 2C we therefore re-compute the graph-distance distribution in the ensemble at an elevated temperature of 50\u00b0C. Here, the real structure becomes the second best structure with free energy \u221210.82 kcal/mol and we observe a much larger fraction of (nearly) unfolded structures with longer distances between the two beacon positions. Qualitatively, this matches the smFRET data showed in Figure 2B .",

Our key observation here is that the dependency between d and d r can be used to reduce the time complexity. Instead of using the variables d and d r in Z B,v i,j [d , d r ], we use the pair d , d add in Z B,v i,j [d , d + d add ]. Similarly, we use d , d add instead of d , d r for the inner base pair, which then determines completely the splitting the distances. This results in an recursion for Z B,v i,j [d , d + d add ] with complexity O(n 4 D 2 c 2 b ) time and O(n 2 Dc b ) space. To be precise, there are three sub-cases as follows. http://www.almob.org/content/9/1/19 The values that are chosen to split d and d add are indicated in green and blue. When the arc {i, j} is colored violet, then there is a shortest path that does not use the distance marked in red but uses the other direction together with the arc {i, j}. If \u2212b < d add < +b, then we know that neither a shortest path v p i nor v p j uses the arc {i, j}. The left distance is thus given by d \u2212 d . Using the shortcuts d r = d + d add and d r = d + d add , then the distance between l and j must be d r \u2212 d r = (d + d add ) \u2212 d + d add . If, on the other hand, d add = +b, then we know that there is at least one shortest path that can be composed by using a shortest path v i, followed by the arc {i, j}. This of course implies that the shortest path v p j is has exactly the length d + b, or is larger. For a sub-path l + 1 p j this implies that the length is greater or equal d = d r \u2212 d r = (d + b) \u2212 d + d add . Thus, we just have to add all partition [d ]. In which, where Q i,j is Q i+1,j\u22121 if j > i + 1, 1 if j = i + 1 and 0 otherwise. Note, furthermore, that all Z I i,j [d ] for d < d \u2264 \u03b8 d are calculated when we restrict the distance to \u03b8 d . Finally, if d add = \u2212b, then the shortest path l p j has distance (d \u2212 b) \u2212 d + d add . For the shortest path k p i, we know that it has length d \u2212 d or greater, which can be resolved by again using Z I \u2265 i,k\u22121 [d \u2212 d ]. Thus, we get the following optimized recursion for Z B,v i,j [d , d + d add ] with d = 0 and d + d add = 0:",

These are the 1st, 6th and 8th most favoured graph-distances in the Boltzmann ensemble.information about the overall structure of the molecule. These distance can be approximated by the graphdistance in RNA secondary structure. We introduced a polynomial time algorithm to compute the equilibrium distribution of graph-distances between a fixed pair of nucleotides. For practical applications, small distances are of main interest. Here, the time complexity of the proposed algorithm is O(n 4 ), compared to a na\u00efve implementation with time complexity of O(n 11 ) for sequence length n and distances that can cover the whole sequence length. Since further reductions, however, seem to be difficult, we also introduced sampling approaches that are much easier to implement. They are also theoretically favorable for several real-life applications, in particular since these primarily concern long-range interactions in very large RNA molecules.",
