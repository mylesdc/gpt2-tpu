The objective of this study was to develop various composite structures of titanium and vanadium oxide (Ti-V-O) coatings on pure titanium through high-temperature annealing and laser texturing oxidation, separately; additionally, surface morphologies, tribological and hydrophilic properties, and antibacterial and biocompatibility abilities of these Ti-V-O coatings were evaluated. TiV alloy thin films were deposited on pure titanium and then annealed to form Ti-V-O coatings through thermal oxidation and laser texturing oxidation. Ball-on-disc wear tests and contact angle tests were conducted to evaluate the tribological properties and wettability of the coatings, respectively. The antibacterial activity of the coatings was estimated by SYTO9 nucleic acid staining with Staphylococcus aureus (Gram-positive bacteria). The cell cytotoxicity of the coatings was analyzed following the ISO 10995-5:2009 standard with human skin fibroblast cells. The Ti-V-O coatings, subjected to annealing at 700 \u2022 C, demonstrated higher hardness (Hv 1171) and a lower friction coefficient (0.6). The highest hardness (Hv 2711) and the lowest friction coefficient (0.52) were obtained for the Ti-V-O after laser surface texturing oxidation at 100 kHz. The oxide coating obtained from 100 kHz laser texturing oxidation exhibited the lotus effect because of its systematic textured microstructures, and displayed superhydrophobic surface properties. Compared with the unannealed TiV coating, both the samples with high-temperature annealing and laser surface texturing oxidation had excellent antibacterial properties to Staphylococcus aureus. However, the Ti-V-O thin films exhibited notable cell cytotoxicity. Although the cell viability on Ti-V-O coatings were not ideal, this study confirmed improvement in surface hardness, tribology, and antibacterial performance in Ti-V-O coatings, which may have potential for use in biomedical tools, devices, and equipment.",

After 1 h of HTA at a constant temperature, the samples were cooled to room temperature.

Differences were considered significant at the p < 0.01 level. Results revealed that the surface morphology and texture of the samples exhibited obvious changes when oxidized after HTA and LSTO. Low laser frequency possessed high laser energy density, creating greater distinction between laser-processed areas and untreated areas. When the laser frequency was 100 kHz, the coating exhibited noticeable surface morphological changes (Figure 1a) , particularly, changes in texture depth and protrusions. A higher laser frequency is attributed to more flashes from the light source, which, in turn, shortens the time used to focus laser energy on the surface. Of the laser settings used to perform LSTO on the TiV coatings, the highest laser frequency was 500 kHz; hence, the coating produced using this frequency was exposed to the least amount of energy density and, therefore, exhibited the least notable morphological changes. For the samples treated by HTA, as shown in Figure 1d , the Ti-V-O coating did not exhibit noticeable morphological differences after undergoing annealing at 500 \u2022 C. However, after annealing at 600 \u2022 C, the coating surface exhibited changes in roughness; in addition to grain enlargement, the coating surface developed an oxide layer. When the annealing temperature was increased to 700 \u2022 C, the increasing amount of oxides created an obvious difference in the surface morphology of the coating. (Table 1) showed that when the content of oxygen in the Ti-V-O coating increased to 57.21%, the vanadium content did not exhibit a considerable change, but the titanium content lowered to 10.41%. This indicated that after oxidation at 600 \u2022 C, the Ti-V-O coating mainly consisted of vanadium oxide (V 2 O 5 ). After the oxidation temperature was increased to 700 \u2022 C, the Ti-V-O coating exhibited grain-shaped oxides (Figure 2d ). This result was similar to that of Guo et al. [10] who reported that, at approximately 656 \u2022 C, TiO 2 thin films produced grain-shaped oxides. Furthermore, the results of the present study revealed that the oxygen increased to 64.43%, the titanium content increased from 10.41% to 31.29%, whereas the vanadium content decreased to 4.28%. That indicated that when the Ti-V-O coating sample was heated to 700 \u2022 C, it mainly consisted of TiO 2 .",

            "text": "Results of the Vickers hardness test on Ti-V-O coatings after HTA are shown in Figure 4 . As the annealing temperature was increased from 500 \u2022 C to 700 \u2022 C, the coating hardness increased from Hv 362 \u00b1 50 to Hv 1171 \u00b1 144. This result was similar to that of Zhang et al. [11] who demonstrated that in early annealing stages, the deposited coating released residual stress, and the hardness did not increase obviously. However, when the annealing temperature was further increased, the titanium alloy thin-film surface exhibited the effect of oxidation, substantially increasing thin film hardness. Figure 5 displays the Vickers hardness test results of LSTO-treated coatings. The results revealed that TiV coatings had greater hardness than the Ti-V-O 300 kHz and Ti-V-O 500 kHz coatings. By contrast, the Ti-V-O 100 kHz coating (which was subjected to the highest level of laser energy density) exhibited a remarkable increase in hardness (2710.97 \u00b1 136 Hv). Similar results were reported in the study of Montealegre et al. [12] . The results indicated that high laser frequency and scanning speed reduced the hardness of the sample; low laser frequency and scanning speed led to high sample surface temperature increase and quenching to room temperature, thereby increasing the hardness. According to Ryk et al. [13] , the surface COF values of LSTO coatings were lower than those of unannealed samples. The LSTO coating surface exhibited a textured structure with uniform patterns; hence, when a tribological load was applied, the surface served as a microreservoir for the oxides. The oxides stored within the surface structure keep a stable wear process and further improve the surface abrasion resistance. Figure 8 shows that HTA-treated Ti-V-O samples exhibited a lower water contact angle for the sample annealed at higher temperatures. The Ti-V-O coating annealed at 700 \u2022 C had the lowest water contract angle. When it was annealed at higher temperature, the surface of the deposited oxide layer had greater roughness, increasing its wettability. Figure 9 shows that the 300 kHz LSTO coating and 500 kHz LSTO coating had greater surface roughness and wettability than did the Ti (uncoated) sample and the TiV deposited sample. However, the Ti-V-O coating treated under a laser frequency of 100 kHz had a high water contact angle of 140 \u2022 , considerably reducing surface wettability and forming a superhydrophobic surface. When LSTO increased the surface roughness of the deposited coating, the uniform surface texture of the 100 kHz coating demonstrated the lotus leaf-like effect, achieving superhydrophobic properties. Yang et al. [14] conducted a water contact angle analysis on the striped, netted, and dotted surface of coatings subject to LSTO, and revealed that coatings composed of titanium, stainless steel (AISI 316L), aluminum alloy (A16061), and tungsten carbide also exhibited superhydrophobic surfaces. This result confirmed that surface superhydrophobicity is mainly affected by surface morphology instead of material properties. ",

Similar to HTA Ti-V-O coatings, the titanium oxide produced through LSTO had photoactive antibacterial effects [17, 18] , and the vanadium oxide produced also exhibited antibacterial properties [19] . By combining titanium oxide and vanadium oxide, the presented results coincided with the study of Wren et al., indicating that the Ti-V-O thin film exhibited greater antibacterial properties [20] . By contrast, the 100 kHz of LSTO Ti-V-O coating demonstrated higher antibacterial properties because of its superhydrophobic surface (i.e., exhibiting a water contact angle of 140 \u2022 ). In reference to Zhang et al. [11] , when the coating surface came into contact with bacteria cells, the superhydrophobic surface lowered the binding power between the bacteria cell and sample surface. This reduced bacterial cells' ability to attach to the sample surface, resulting in antibacterial effects. As a result of this, the 100 kHz LSTO Ti-V-O coating seems to exhibit superior antibacterial properties compared with the 300 kHz and 500 kHz LSTO Ti-V-O coatings. The present study verified that the Ti-V-O coating exhibited excellent antibacterial properties, and the vanadium compounds within the Ti-V-O coating induced inflammation in cells. Some researchers have indicated that oxidation states of vanadium could induce DNA damage [21, 22] in cells, and excessive amounts of vanadium compounds exert observable toxic effects on body tissues [23] . Although vanadium has been confirmed as a toxic transition metal, the application of it, in cancer treatment and as a novel medicine in special compounds against viral infections, such as Dengue fever, SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), and HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) [24] , still shows great potential for the future.

The results indicated that the HTA temperature influenced the COF of deposited coatings, and the COF value was reduced for the samples after HTA at higher temperature. The Ti-V-O coatings treated by the LSTO method (Figure 7) exhibited similar results. Compared with the untreated TiV coating, the Ti-V-O coatings treated by LSTO at frequencies of 100, 300, and 500 kHz exhibited lower COF values. Reducing the laser frequency transferred a greater amount of laser energy density to the deposited TiV coatings, generating more surface oxides and reducing the COF value; hence, the Ti-V-O samples with coatings deposited at a frequency of 100 kHz had the lowest COF value.",
