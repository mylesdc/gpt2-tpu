            "text": "Acute laryngitis, in general, is caused by the viral infection of upper airways. It mostly affects children aged from 6 months to 3 years, and its peak incidence age is 2 years, especially among male infants. 1 The most common etiological agents are the parainfluenza virus, influenza, metapneumovirus, adenovirus, coronavirus and the respiratory syncytial virus. 1, 2 The infection begins at the nasopharynx and spreads along the respiratory epithelium, causing inflammation of the subglottic portion of the larynx. Congestion and edema of this region lead to a variable degree of airway obstruction, restricting the air flow entry, causing respiratory difficulties. [1] [2] [3] In 24 to 48 hours, the situation is aggravated with mild to severe obstruction, presence of barking cough, dysphonia, aphonia, or hoarse cry, and inspiratory stridor. In extreme cases, besides intensive dyspnea and agitation, there is paleness, cyanosis, numbness, seizures, apnea, and death. 2 The high-flow nasal cannula is an alternative modality of medicinal gas administration, with heated and humidified oxygen in flows that range, in pediatrics, from 1 to 2 L/kg, and which has been used for ventilatory support in several clinical conditions. [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] We reported the case of a patient, in the pediatric emergency room, who needed tracheal intubation due to severe acute laryngitis, and who, after the scheduled tracheal extubation, successfully used the high-flow nasal cannula, which possibility prevented the need for a new tracheal intubation.",

He remained intubated, on midazolam (0.2 mg/kg/h) and fentanyl (2 mcg/kg/h), without the need for vasoactive medication, remaining clinically stable. Six days after hospitalization, flexible bronchoscopy was carried out to assess the conditions of the mucosa before indicating extubation, since the patient had been intubated for six days without signs of tracheal peri-cannula ventilator escape. Bronchoscopy revealed \"major mucosal edema, involving the intratracheal cannula\" (Figure 1 ), so the choice was to maintain the tracheal cannula, without progression of bronchoscopy through the trachea. The infant was intubated, stable, on dexamethasone and medication for sedation and analgesia. Seven days after bronchoscopy, he demonstrated signs of escape through the tracheal cannula, shown by auscultation and observed in the monitor of the ventilation equipment (Servo-i \u00ae , Maquet, Rastatt, Germany). A new flexible bronchoscopy was carried out for the supervised extubation. Bronchoscopy showed \"larynx with discrete posterior wall edema, with good mobilization of vocal folds and air escape between the tracheal cannula and the larynx\". For the programming of the tracheal extubation, a thoracic X-ray was performed and did not show any abnormalities nor arterial blood gas (pH: 7.50; pO 2 : 120 mmHg; pCO 2 : 32 mmHg; sodium bicarbonate: 21 mEq/L; base excess: +1; SatO 2 : 98%). Tracheal extubation was conducted and the use of nasal oxygen catheter began, with 2 L/minute, presenting with mild laryngeal stridor, with improvements after inhalation with one ampoule of budesonide (0.25 mg). Forty-eight hours after the extubation, the patient evolved to severe acute respiratory failure, with major laryngeal stridor, vacillation of the wings of the nose, and increased HR until 167 bmp, and RF of 39 bpm, indicating a new tracheal intubation. The choice was to start support with high-flow nasal cannula (Optiflow Junior \u00ae , Fisher & Paykel, Auckland, New Zealand) at 15 L/minute, FiO2: 25%, with significant improvement in the respiratory situation, as well as reduced HR and RF (Figure 2 ).

It is important to consider the possibility that the patient has a latent problem coming from the neonatal period, result of a previous tracheal intubation, since, in acute laryngitis, a review by Gelbart et al. showed that the mean time of tracheal intubation is 60 hours. 10 When tracheal intubation takes place in the emergency sector, it is important that the most experienced physician at the location performs the tracheal intubation, since an edema associated with agitation may make the procedure more difficult. In situations in which there is no success in tracheal intubation, the edema may be aggravated, preventing new attempts. In these cases, it is essential that the medical service has a protocol for airway access involving the anesthesia and/or ear, nose and throat teams, which contemplates the performance of urgent tracheostomy or cricothyroidotomy. 3, [11] [12] [13] The high-flow nasal cannula presents an action mechanism which, even if not completely clear, has been addressed at improving gas exchange for purifying the dead space and causing positive pharyngeal pressure, which can, up to a certain point, be transmitted to the distal airways, providing low level of positive expiratory pressure. 4, 5, 9 In the case presented, the patient used the high-flow nasal cannula and obtained benefits from the improvement in the respiratory pattern, which possibly prevented tracheal reintubation and the complications from it. The use of the high-flow nasal cannula was efficient and pointed to a good response in acute laryngitis, suggesting it is a possible adjuvant for treatment, avoiding the worsening of the respiratory situation and the need for reintubation. There are studies in adults comparing the use of the high-flow nasal cannula versus non-invasive ventilation in tracheal extubation, and they show that the high-flow nasal cannula is not inferior to noninvasive ventilation; however, these studies do not specifically address acute laryngitis. 14 In the medical literature, we do not know of medical reports regarding the use of high-flow nasal cannula for this purpose.",

Foi imediatamente intubado e encaminhado para a unidade de terapia intensiva (UTI) pedi\u00e1trica. Apresentou falha de extuba\u00e7\u00e3o em fun\u00e7\u00e3o de edema importante de laringe evidenciado por broncoscopia, o que contraindicou a extuba\u00e7\u00e3o. Na segunda tentativa de extuba\u00e7\u00e3o, o paciente apresentou desconforto respirat\u00f3rio, melhorando ap\u00f3s uso da c\u00e2nula nasal de alto fluxo, com redu\u00e7\u00e3o da frequ\u00eancia card\u00edaca e respirat\u00f3ria, possibilitando a extuba\u00e7\u00e3o com sucesso. Coment\u00e1rios: O uso da c\u00e2nula nasal de alto fluxo foi eficaz e apresentou boa resposta nesse paciente com laringite aguda, sugerindo ser um poss\u00edvel adjuvante para o tratamento, evitando-se a piora do quadro respirat\u00f3rio e da necessidade de reintuba\u00e7\u00e3o.",
