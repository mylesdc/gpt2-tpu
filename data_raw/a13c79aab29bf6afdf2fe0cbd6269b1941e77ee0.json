The questionnaire identified the demographics, vaccination status of participants and all household members, barriers to non-vaccination, perceived threat, and preventive behaviors. In Korea, the overall rate of pandemic influenza vaccination coverage in the surveyed population was 15.5%; vaccination coverage in the high-risk group and non-high-risk group was 47.3% and 8.0%, respectively. In the high-risk group, the most important triggering event for vaccination was receiving a notice from a public health organization. In the non-high-risk group, vaccination was more strongly influenced by previous experience with influenza or mass media campaigns. In both groups, the most common reasons for not receiving vaccination was that their health was sufficient to forgo the vaccination, and lack of time. There was no significant difference in how either group perceived the threat or adopted preventive behavior. The predictive factors for pandemic influenza vaccination were being elderly (age $65 years), prior seasonal influenza vaccination, and chronic medical disease.",

            "text": "Pandemic influenza A (H1N1) arose in North America in April 2009 and subsequently spread worldwide. It caused at least 18,449 casualties in 214 countries by June 7, 2010 [1] . In Korea, the first case of pandemic influenza was confirmed in a 50-year-old woman who had returned from Mexico on May 1, 2009 . From mid-August, schools were the epicenters as pandemic influenza A (H1N1) spread widely and quickly into the local community. By the end of October, the influenza-like illness prevalence rate peaked at 45 per 1,000 in the Korean population [2] . During the early stages of the pandemic, a quarantine and isolation policy blocked introduction of the pandemic into the local community. After July, when the epidemic had begun to infiltrate the local community, administration of antiviral agent and a vaccination policy was initiated. Vaccination was the most effective measure for reducing the number of infections, hospitalizations, and deaths. However, it was only available after the pandemic had peaked. The vaccine supply was limited and thus could not be used at a more appropriate time. Therefore, along with the isolation and treatment of the infected, other preventive measures, such as hand washing, mask use, and covering the mouth while coughing, were disseminated through the media to mitigate the damage caused by the pandemic influenza.",

By reporting this statistic widely, the mass media amplified the fear among the general population.

Previous studies on the response to the 2002 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome found that people were more likely to comply with health-related recommendations if they believed that the government was providing clear and sufficient information about the outbreak [4, 5] . In addition, the studies suggested that compliance with health-related recommendations such as vaccination and preventive measures would increase if people believed they had a high likelihood of being affected or if they perceived the illness to have a severe consequence.",

The vaccination coverage of all respondents' household members across all age groups was 26.3%. This finding was consistent with the 26.1% recorded in the Korean Immunization Registry (KIR) study [8] . However, the KIR study found that vaccination coverage in the elderly (age $65 years) was 38.0%, which was lower than the findings of our telephone survey. The KIR information is highly reliable as it used vaccination uptake data. By contrast, the telephone survey confirmed vaccination coverage through selfreported data. Therefore, it is possible that vaccination coverage was overestimated in those aged $65 years. Yet, although selection bias might apply in the severely ill and in the elderly, previous studies support the validity of self-reported vaccination coverage [9] [10] [11] . Moreover, the KIR only provides information on age, sex, and the priority group type of the vaccinated. On the other hand, our survey data provide a range of information, such as the triggering events for the vaccinated or the barriers encountered by the non-vaccinated; the perception concerning pandemic influenza can be a clear advantage. Therefore, the data from this survey address not only pandemic influenza vaccination coverage, but can distinguish differences between factors relevant to pandemic influenza vaccination or non-vaccination, public perception, and preventive behaviors against pandemic influenza between high-risk and non-high-risk groups.",

The findings are consistent with the results of a seasonal influenza vaccination study in Korea [12] . Furthermore, when age, sex, education, and income were adjusted, the difference in vaccination coverage between the high-risk group and the non-high-risk group was statistically significant. The finding showed that in pandemic influenza vaccination, vaccination campaigns targeted towards those at high risk were partially successful. In Korea, there are four aspects to targeting vaccination towards the high-risk group. First, people registered as having a chronic medical disease in the Health Insurance Review Agency database received vaccination information in the mail. Second, the elderly (i.e., those aged $65 years), those known to be financially vulnerable, and nursing home residents received free vaccinations at public health centers. Third, pregnant women and people with chronic medical diseases were vaccinated at private clinics at the overall cost of 15,000 Korean won (US $14). Fourth, an information dissemination campaign was conducted through the public media. However, despite these steps, pandemic influenza vaccination coverage in the high-risk group was lower when compared to seasonal influenza vaccination. In Korea, the high mortality rate in people aged $60 years and with chronic medical disease during the pandemic influenza A (H1N1) indicates that a more aggressive vaccination program is needed for the high risk group [13] .",

The respondents' major reasons for pandemic influenza non-vaccination were ''confidence in health'' and ''not enough time to get vaccinated.'' These reasons for non-vaccination were consistent with a previous study carried out in Korea [12] . Studies in France, Australia, the United States, and Hong Kong demonstrated that vaccine safety and side effects were the most significant barriers to vaccination, whereas fear of vaccination side effects was relatively low in Korea [14] [15] [16] [17] . This could indicate a cultural difference in the perception towards vaccination. Factors associated with pandemic influenza vaccination are important clues for increasing vaccination uptake. Aside from the high-risk group, the non-high-risk group considered receiving a notice from a public health organization the most important triggering event. A study conducted in the US reported that people who received information on the safety and efficacy of a vaccine from public health organizations or healthcare providers rather than media, or family or friends had a higher probability of being vaccinated [18] . This strongly indicates that public health organizations should publicize vaccination more actively. In particular, it is necessary to provide information about influenza and vaccine efficacy to those at high risk to motivate them to receive vaccination.",
