            "text": "Replication of plus-strand RNA viruses depends on recruited host factors that aid several critical steps during replication. In this paper, we show that an essential translation factor, Ded1p DEAD-box RNA helicase of yeast, directly affects replication of Tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV). To separate the role of Ded1p in viral protein translation from its putative replication function, we utilized a cell-free TBSV replication assay and recombinant Ded1p. The in vitro data show that Ded1p plays a role in enhancing plus-strand synthesis by the viral replicase. We also find that Ded1p is a component of the tombusvirus replicase complex and Ded1p binds to the 39-end of the viral minus-stranded RNA. The data obtained with wt and ATPase deficient Ded1p mutants support the model that Ded1p unwinds local structures at the 39-end of the TBSV (2)RNA, rendering the RNA compatible for initiation of (+)-strand synthesis. Interestingly, we find that Ded1p and glyceraldehyde-3phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), which is another host factor for TBSV, play non-overlapping functions to enhance (+)strand synthesis. Altogether, the two host factors enhance TBSV replication synergistically by interacting with the viral (2)RNA and the replication proteins. In addition, we have developed an in vitro assay for Flock house virus (FHV), a small RNA virus of insects, that also demonstrated positive effect on FHV replicase activity by the added Ded1p helicase. Thus, two small RNA viruses, which do not code for their own helicases, seems to recruit a host RNA helicase to aid their replication in infected cells.",

After translation of their mRNA-sense genomic RNA(s), the viral RNA and the viral replication proteins are recruited to the site of viral replication in membranous compartments. After the assembly of the membranebound viral replicase complexes (VRC), the viral replicase uses the viral RNA as a template to produce complementary (2) RNA. This is then followed by (+)-strand synthesis in an asymmetric manner, producing excess amounts of (+)-strand progeny, which is released from replication for other viral processes. For efficient replication, (+)RNA viruses recruit numerous host proteins [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . Among the identified host proteins are RNA-binding proteins, such as translation factors, ribosomal proteins and RNAmodifying enzymes [1] . The co-opted host proteins likely affect several steps in viral RNA replication, including the assembly of the replicase complex and/or viral RNA synthesis. However, the functions of host factors in (+)RNA virus replication are known only for a small number of host factors [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] .",

Although the functions of several of these proteins have been studied in some details, additional host proteins might be also present in tombusvirus VRC [5, 10, [21] [22] [23] 25] . One of the intriguing questions is if tombusviruses use host-coded helicases for their replication. This is because, unlike larger RNA viruses, the tombusvirus genome does not code for a protein with helicase function. Thus, can tombusviruses and other small RNA viruses replicate without the use of a helicase or they subvert a cellular helicase(s) to assist their replication? DEAD-box proteins constitute the largest family of RNA helicases that are involved in all aspects of cellular metabolism and perform RNA duplex unwinding and remodeling of RNA-protein complexes in cells [33] [34] [35] . Ded1p, which is essential for yeast growth, is among the best-characterized DEAD-box helicases [36] . It is involved in initiation of translation of every yeast mRNA [37] [38] [39] and down-regulation of Ded1p level also reduced p33 and p92 levels in yeast [20] . Therefore, not surprisingly, TBSV replication also decreased significantly in yeast with reduced level of Ded1p. Due to its essential role in translation, it is critical to separate the possible role of Ded1p in viral replication from its effect on viral translation.",

We define that Ded1p plays a role in enhancing plusstrand (+)RNA synthesis by the viral replicase. We also find that Ded1p is a component of the tombusvirus VRC and binds to the 39-end of the viral minus-stranded (2)RNA. The obtained data support the model that Ded1p unwinds the 39-end of the TBSV (2)RNA, rendering the RNA compatible for initiation of (+)strand synthesis. Interestingly, we find that Ded1p and GAPDH play non-overlapping functions to enhance (+)-strand synthesis. Altogether, the two host factors enhance TBSV replication synergistically by interacting with the viral (2)RNA and the replication proteins.",

To circumvent this problem, we used whole cell extracts (CFE) prepared from yeast containing reduced level of Ded1p ( Figure S1 ) to support cell-free TBSV replication. As we have shown previously, TBSV (+)RNA can perform one complete cycle of replication in the CFE-based replication assay when purified recombinant p33 and p92 pol replication proteins are provided [23, 40] . The CFE-based replication assay showed that both (+) and (2)RNA synthesis decreased by over 4-fold when Ded1p was down-regulated as compared with the control CFE prepared from yeast with high level of Ded1p expression ( Figure S1 , lanes 4-6 versus 1-3). Thus, these data confirm that Ded1p is important for TBSV replication. However, the observed decrease in the CFE-based TBSV replication could be due to either reduced replication when Ded1p is limiting (direct effect) or lesser amounts of other critical host factors needed for TBSV replication in the CFE with reduced level of Ded1p (indirect effect due to Ded1p's role in host translation). To address these points, we first studied if Ded1p is present within the tombusvirus replicase and then, what is the mechanistic role of Ded1p during TBSV RNA synthesis.",

Small RNA viruses do not code for their own helicases and they might recruit host RNA helicases to aid their replication in infected cells. In this paper, the authors show that the Ded1p DEAD-box helicase, which is an essential translation factor in yeast, is recruited by Tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) into its replicase complex. They also show that Ded1p binds to the viral (2)RNA and promotes (+)-strand TBSV synthesis when added to a yeast-based cell-free extract depleted for Ded1p. An ATPase defective Ded1p mutant failed to promote TBSV replication in vitro, suggesting that the helicase activity of Ded1p is essential for its function during TBSV replication. In addition, the authors also show that another host protein, which also binds to the (2)RNA, namely glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), further enhances TBSV (+)RNA when added together with Ded1p to yeast-based cell-free extract. In summary, the authors show that the major functions of Ded1p and GAPDH host proteins are to promote TBSV replication via selectively enhancing (+)-strand synthesis.",

We observed a ,2-fold increased level of TBSV RNA replication (based on total singlestranded repRNA level) in the presence of recombinant Ded1p when compared with the MBP control ( Figure 2B , lane 2 versus 4). Interestingly, the amount of double-stranded RNA, which correlates with (2)-strand levels [23] , did not increase in the presence of Ded1p in the CFE assay ( Figure 2B, lanes 1 versus 3) . This finding suggests that (2)-strand RNA did not contribute to the 2-fold increase in total TBSV RNA levels when recombinant Ded1p was added to the CFE-based replication assay. Therefore, we conclude that the added recombinant Ded1p selectively increased TBSV (+)-strand RNA synthesis in vitro.",

Under these conditions, the viral replication proteins recruit the repRNA to the membrane and the replicase becomes partially RNase and protease insensitive, but it cannot initiate minus-strand synthesis yet, due to the absence of CTP/UTP [23] . Then, centrifugation and washing the membranes will remove all the proteins and molecules not bound to the membrane.

Moreover, Ded1p was likely lost during the centrifugation/washing step in this assay due to its low association with the membrane. However, addition of Ded1p exclusively during the second step of the CFE assay resulted in ,2-fold increase in TBSV RNA replication ( Figure 3B , lane 14 versus 15), similar to the stimulatory effect of Ded1p during standard CFE replication assay ( Figure 2 ). Interestingly, a Ded1p mutant (D1) deficient in ATPase activity could not stimulate TBSV RNA synthesis in this assay ( Figure 3B , lane 13), while a mutant (D11, Figure S3C ) with increased ATPase activity [41] promoted TBSV RNA synthesis by ,2-fold ( Figure 3B , lane 11). Altogether, these findings indicate that Ded1p has a direct stimulatory function during TBSV RNA synthesis, while Ded1p is unlikely to affect viral RNA recruitment for replication or VRC assembly.",

(A) Scheme of the CFE-based TBSV replicase assembly and replication assays. Purified recombinant p33 and p92 pol replication proteins of TBSV and in vitro transcribed TBSV DI-72 (+)repRNA were added to the whole cell extract prepared from Ded1p-depleted yeast strain in step 1. The assay either contained or lacked the purified recombinant Ded1p (0.3 mg) or MBP during step 1. Note that the assay was performed in the presence of ATP/GTP to facilitate TBSV VRC assembly, but prevent RNA synthesis in step 1. After step 1, centrifugation was used to collect the membrane fraction of the CFE, and after washing the membranes, step 2 was performed in the presence of ATP/CTP/GTP and 32 P-UTP to allow TBSV RNA replication. In the samples presented in right panel, Ded1p or MBP were added at the beginning of step 2.

See further details in Figure 2 . Note that the various preps of D3 mutant of Ded1p showed high variation in in vitro activity (for reasons currently unknown)-see Figure 4B . Each experiment was repeated at least three times and the data were used to calculate standard deviation. To test if Ded1p can interact with the TBSV p33 replication protein, we used the membrane-based split-ubiquitin assay [31] . We found that Ded1p interacted with p33 protein in yeast ( Figure  S6A ). The pull-down experiments with MBP-p33 and MBP-p92 also showed that Ded1p bound to the tombusvirus replication proteins in vitro ( Figure S6B ). This was further supported by the reverse pull-down experiments with GST-tagged Ded1p, which resulted in the co-purification of p33 and p92 ( Figure S6C ).",

            "text": "Ded1p facilitates initiation by the tombusvirus replicase on RNA/DNA duplex To gain further insights into the mechanism of Ded1p-driven stimulation of TBSV and FHV RNA synthesis, we exploited template structures, such as an RNA/DNA duplex, that are known to hinder RdRp-driven RNA synthesis [48, 49] . Since Ded1p is an RNA helicase [39, 41] and the ATPase/helicase function of Ded1p is needed for stimulation of (+)RNA synthesis by the tombusvirus and FHV replicases, we wanted to examine if Ded1p might facilitate RNA synthesis on a partial DNA/RNA duplex. We chose partial duplex for this assay, since Ded1p and other DEAD-box helicases are not processive enzymes and can only unwind short duplexes [34] . Also, we have shown previously that short DNA oligos hybridized to the promoter region of (2)RNA can inhibit (+)RNA synthesis by the tombusvirus replicase in vitro [42, 47, 48] . Interestingly, addition of purified Ded1p to the tombusvirus replicase assay containing the short RNA/DNA duplex ( Figure 7A Non-overlapping functions of Ded1p and GAPDH in promoting initiation by the tombusvirus replicase GAPDH (Tdh2p in yeast) RNA binding protein is also a host factor stimulating (+)RNA synthesis by the tombusvirus replicase [25, 50] . To test if Ded1p and GAPDH could play a complementary role during (+)RNA synthesis, we added the purified recombinant Ded1p and Tdh2p to the in vitro tombusvirus replicase assay based on the purified preparation ( Figure 8A ). While Ded1p mostly stimulated de novo (+)RNA synthesis initiated from the 39 end of the (2)repRNA up to ,3-fold ( Figure 8B , lane 6), Tdh2p enhanced both de novo (+)RNA synthesis and 39TEX by ,2-and ,3-fold, respectively ( Figure 8B, lane 7) . Interestingly, the two host proteins together had the largest (4.5-fold) effect on (+)RNA synthesis, while their effect on 39TEX was only ,2-fold. Based on these data, we suggest that Ded1p and Tdh2p have a We also performed similar experiments with a short partial RNA/DNA duplex as a template. Both Ded1p and Tdh2p alone could enhance (+)RNA synthesis on the short RNA/DNA duplex ( Figure 8C , lanes 2-3 versus 1) but the largest stimulatory effect (i.e., close to 5-fold increase) was seen when both host factors were included in the assay ( Figure 8C, lane 4) . Altogether, these data further support that Ded1p and GAPDH play synergistic roles in (+)RNA synthesis by the tombusvirus replicase. [9] . Since the viral RNA plays multiple roles during infection, it is likely that remodeling of the viral RNAs and RNP complexes during the switch from one step to another requires RNA helicases or RNA chaperones. Accordingly, the larger RNA viruses all code for RNA helicases [51, 52] . However, RNA viruses with shorter than 6 kB genomes usually do not code for RNA helicases. They could still use RNA helicases during infections if they can subvert selected host helicases for viral purposes. Indeed, we show here that Ded1p helicase is recruited for TBSV replication to aid (+)strand RNA synthesis.",

Also, by recruiting Ded1p, viruses could affect RNA degradation (P-body formation; [53] ) and initiation of translation of new RNAs, likely affecting subsequent host translation (including virus-induced mRNAs coding for anti-viral proteins or required for anti-viral signaling).",

For example, AtRH20 has been shown to boost TBSV (+)RNA synthesis in vitro ( Figure 6 ) and bind to p33 replication protein ( Figure S6A ), which can facilitate its recruitment into the VRC.

            "text": "The in vitro data, based on the CFE assay containing the membrane-bound VRC as well as the solubilized/purified tombusvirus replicase, showed the Ded1p can mainly stimulate TBSV (+)-strand synthesis, while its effect on (2)RNA synthesis is less pronounced. The ATPase activity of Ded1p is required for this stimulatory effect, suggesting that the helicase function of Ded1p is likely important for unwinding the secondary structure of (2)RNA template with the purified tombusvirus replicase or destabilizing the replication intermediate with the membrane-bound VRC, which might contain dsRNA structure. This function of Ded1p can explain why yeast with down-regulated Ded1p level produced small amount of (+)-stranded RNA progeny, albeit it has also shown that depleted Ded1p reduced the level of p33/p92 in yeast [20] . However, the decreased p33/p92 levels are expected to reduce both (+) and (2)RNA levels [55] ( Figure S1 ). Since the recombinant Ded1p enhanced (+)-strand synthesis by the purified recombinant tombusvirus replicase, we propose that Ded1p directly affect TBSV RNA synthesis via affecting the structure of the RNA templates. However, we cannot exclude that Ded1p could also affect the activity of the VRC due to its interaction with p33, albeit the assembly of the VRC was not affected by Ded1p in the CFE-based assay ( Figure 3) . Overall, the recruitment of a host DEAD-box helicase for replication of a small RNA virus is remarkable, since RNA viruses with less than 6 kB genomes are usually do not code for their own helicases [51] . These viruses are thought to replicate without needing a helicase by using RNA chaperones or possibly recruiting host helicases. The emerging picture with TBSV is that this virus utilizes both the viral-coded p33 RNA chaperone [48] and the host Ded1p helicase for replication by promoting (+)-strand synthesis. Both p33 and Ded1p have been shown to open up short DNA/RNA duplexes, although the activity of Ded1p was more robust than that of p33 in vitro [48] . Why would TBSV utilize both an RNA chaperone and an RNA helicase? It is possible that both proteins are needed for robust (+)RNA synthesis to make excess amount of progeny RNA. Also, Ded1p helicase could be involved in remodeling the viral RNA bound by the viral RdRp or host proteins prior or during RNA synthesis. Since Ded1p can work in both 59-to-39 and 39-to-59 directions [56] , it could be used for multiple purposes during RNA synthesis.",

For example, Ded1p might unwind either local secondary structure in (2)repRNA or dsRNA region and that, in turn, could favor binding of GAPDH or p92 to the (2)RNA template. This is followed by binding of GAPDH to an AU-rich internal site and proper positioning of the p92 RdRp (bound to GAPDH, [50] ) over the (+)-strand initiation promoter, leading to (+)RNA synthesis.",

            "text": "The synergistic effect of these host proteins could promote efficient recycling of the viral RdRp resulting in multiple rounds of (+)RNA synthesis ( Figure 9 ). Thus, the roles of these host proteins are to serve as ''matchmakers'' between the viral RNA template and the viral RdRp. It is intriguing that two host proteins, eEF1A and eEF1Bc, are proposed to serve somewhat similar functions during (2)RNA initiation for TBSV [27, 29] . Therefore, the emerging picture is that TBSV utilizes different host proteins for promoting (2) versus (+)RNA synthesis. This strategy could be beneficial for the virus by allowing asymmetric RNA synthesis, thus leading to excess amount of progeny (+)RNA.",

Protein expression was induced using isopropyl b-Dthiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for 8 h at 23uC in the case of host proteins and at 16uC in the case of p33 and p92, then the cells were collected by centrifugation (5,000 rpm for 5 min).

The extract was then centrifuged at 16,000 g for 10 min, followed by incubation with amylose resin (NEB) for 15 min at 4uC. After washing the resin 2 times with the column buffer, the proteins were eluted with column buffer containing 0.18% (V/W) maltose. Purification of GST-tagged TDH2 (pGEX-TDH2) [50] was carried out using glutathione resin and eluted with 10 mM glutathione, 10 mM \u00df-mercaptoethanol in the column buffer following the same protocol as MBPproteins.

Figure S1 Reduced TBSV replication in CFE prepared from Ded1-depleted yeast. CFEs were prepared from TET::DED1 yeast strain cultured in the absence of doxycycline (i.e., Ded1p is expressed) or in its presence (10 mg/ml) (i.e., Ded1p is depleted). The CFEs were programmed with recombinant p33/p92 and DI-72(+) repRNA as described in REF 21. Note that the dsRNA product represents the annealed (2)RNA and the (+)RNA, while the ssRNA products represents the newly made (+)RNA products. The CFEs contained comparable amounts of host proteins (not shown). Figure S3 Ded1p mutants with ATPase activity promote plusstrand synthesis by the affinity-purified tombusvirus replicase.

Yeast with depleted Ded1p co-expressing p33 and p92 pol replication proteins and DI-72 (+)repRNA were used to affinity-purify the RNA-free tombusvirus replicase.

The level of complementary RNA synthesis producing ''repRNA'' (marked as ''FL'', the full-length product, made via initiation from the 39-terminal promoter) in each sample was compared to that of the replicase activity obtained in the absence of added recombinant protein. Note that this replicase preparation also synthesizes internal initiation products (''ii'') and 39-terminal extension products (''39TEX'').

The (2)repRNA, which is shown with a ''closed'' 39 end due to either a secondary structure within the promoter (cPR) in the (2)repRNA or part of a dsRNA structure, could be unwound by Ded1p around the 39 end, making the(2)repRNA ''open''. The open ssRNA structure would facilitate (+)RNA synthesis by the tombusvirus p92 RdRp protein. GAPDH could facilitate (+)RNA synthesis via binding to a 39 AU-rich sequence (indicated as a box) and also bringing in the p92 protein and positioning it over the cPR promoter as shown. Thus, Ded1p and GAPDH might play a complementary role, leading to synergistic effect on (+)RNA synthesis. In the absence of Ded1p, GAPDH could promote both 39-terminal extension and (+)RNA synthesis by facilitating the positioning of p92 over the 39 end. doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1002537.g009",
