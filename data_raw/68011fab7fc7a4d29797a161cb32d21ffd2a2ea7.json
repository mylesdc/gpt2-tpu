No T cell epitopes have been previously identified in the H5N1 AIV virus nucleoprotein (NP) in chickens. For the first time, this study used homology modelling techniques to construct three-dimensional structures of the peptidebinding domains of chicken MHC class I molecules for four commonly encountered unique haplotypes, i.e., B4, B12, B15, and B19. H5N1 AIV NP was computationally parsed into octapeptides or nonapeptides according to the peptide-binding motifs of MHC class I molecules of the B4, B12, B15 and B19 haplotypes. Seventy-five peptide sequences were modelled and their MHC class I molecule-binding abilities were analysed by molecular docking. Twenty-five peptides (Ten for B4, six for B12, two for B15, and seven for B19) were predicted to be potential T cell epitopes in chicken. Nine of these peptides and one unrelated peptide were manually synthesized and their T cell responses were tested in vitro. Spleen lymphocytes were collected from SPF chickens that had been immunised with a NP-expression plasmid, pCAGGS-NP, and they were stimulated using the synthesized peptides. The secretion of chicken IFN-c and the proliferation of CD8 + T cells were tested using an ELISA kit and flow cytometry, respectively. The significant secretion of chicken IFN-c and proliferation of CD8 + T lymphocytes increased by 13.7% and 11.9% were monitored in cells stimulated with peptides NP [89][90][91][92][93][94][95][96][97] , respectively. The results indicate that peptides NP 89-97 (PKKTGGPIY) and NP 198-206 (KRGINDRNF) are NP T cell epitopes in chicken of certain haplotypes. The method used in this investigation is applicable to predicting T cell epitopes for other antigens in chicken, while this study also extends our understanding of the mechanisms of the immune response to AIV in chicken.",

Since 2003, the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus (AIV) has caused numerous cases of severe disease and death in humans [2] . An influenza pandemic could ensue if this virus developed the capacity to spread easily among humans [3] [4] [5] . Migratory birds constitute the natural reservoir for AIVs, but chickens may play a key role in the transmission to humans [6] . Epitopes can be used for accurately monitoring immune responses to AIV and for the rational design of protective vaccines. However, only two epitopes from the H5N1 avian influenza A/Vietnam/1194/2004 virus are included in the Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resources (IEDB). The majority of T cell and B cell epitopes have been identified in mouse, human, or rabbit hosts. Few epitopes have been described in chicken [7] .",

The peptide-binding groove is formed by the a1 and a2 domains. Each domain contributes four strands to an eight -stranded anti-parallel b-sheet. Two long interrupted helices, one from each domain, pack against the side of this sheet in an orientation directed away from the cell membrane. There is a series of pockets (A-F) along the peptide-binding groove where highly polymorphic amino acids mediate recognition via haplotype-specific associations with antigens and T cell receptors. However, highly conserved residues are found at both ends of the peptide-binding groove that form a network of hydrogen bonds, which directly interact with hydrogen bonds at the peptide's Nterminus and C-terminus [9] [10] [11] . Peptides that bind to MHC class I molecules are usually octamers or nonamers, where only one or a few residues can interact with polymorphic residues in the groove. These residues are known as anchor residues when they are found in an anchoring position [12] [13] [14] [15] . Several public databases and prediction services are available for MHC molecular ligands and peptide motifs, including SYFPEITHI and RANKPEP [16, 17] .",

            "text": "Unlike mammalian studies, the majority of investigations of MHC class I molecules in chicken remain limited to primary sequences and the structure of MHC class I molecule from the B21 haplotype was solved only recently [18, 19] . The chicken MHC B system is located on chicken Chromosome 16 (Chr16) and is composed of tightly linked polymorphic regions: BF (class I) and BL (class IIb) and a large family of polymorphic Ig-superfamily (IgSF) genes called BG-the latter sharing sequence similarities with mammalian MHC butyrophilin, myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein, and TRIM genes [20, 21] . The MHC B-F molecules are structurally and functionally similar to mammalian MHC class I molecules. The two class I genes are known as BF1 and BF2, although the BF2 gene is mainly expressed. The MHC class I (B-F) molecules present antigen peptides to the CD8 + T lymphocytes, which have a central role in the immune system. The MHC class I molecules of different haplotypes have specific peptide-binding tropisms, and B-F-associated peptide-binding motifs have been determined for several haplotypes, including B4, B12, B15, and B19 [22] . Thirteen peptides derived from the v-src gene of the Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) Prague strain were predicted to fit the peptide-binding motif of the MHC class I molecules of B12 haplotype and all 13 synthetic peptides actually bound to the BF12 class I molecule in subsequent binding tests [23] . This demonstrates that peptide-binding motifs can be used to predict the antigen peptides presented by chicken MHC class I molecules.",

            "text": "Peptide binding to a given class I MHC molecule requires the presence of anchor residues that complement the physicochemical characteristics of the specificity pockets [36] . Anchor residues are usually found at peptide position 2 (P2), where they interact with pocket B, but sometimes at position 5 or 6 (P5 or P6), where they interact with pocket C or E. A C-terminal residue (PC) also typically binds in pocket F [8] . The anchor residues Glu or Asp (P2) in B4 have an electrostatically favourable interaction with the side-chain of the pocket B residue Aspa9, which points up from the b-sheet. Similarly, anchor residues P2 Arg in B15 and B19 provide an electrostatically favourable interaction with the negatively-charged residues Aspa34 and Glua62, the side-chains of which point towards the binding groove from the a-helix. The presence of Glu8 or Asp8 as major residues in the C-terminal position of the B4 motif is unprecedented, and there are no previous mammalian examples of negatively-charged residues in the C-terminal anchor position [16] . It is possible that the positively-charged Arga80 residue of the F pocket is the key to the binding of anchor residues P8Glu or P8Asp. There is an anchor residue in the central cavity region corresponding to pocket C in B12 and B4. This is very similar to the mammalian MHC class I molecules H-2 Kb and H-2 Db, and it may be related to the Glya68(69) residue without a side-chain located in the a-helix (the residue number in parentheses is derived from mammals, whereas that without parentheses is from the chicken). The volumes of the binding grooves in B4 and B12 are 662.45 \u00c5 3 and 637.677 \u00c5 3 , respectively, which are greater than those of B15 (582.595 \u00c5 3 ) and B19 (581.676 \u00c5 3 ) (Fig. 5) . This may explain why the former have anchor residues in the middle region of their binding peptides. In general, anchor residues point downwards into the binding groove, which allows them to fill the pocket and maintain the stability of the peptide-MHC complex.",

First, this is the first study to determine the structural characteristics of the peptide-binding domains of chicken MHC class I molecules belonging to the B4, B12, B15, and B19 haplotypes using a combined motif-structure method to predict T cell epitopes in chickens.

Thus, there is little information available on the structure and function of chicken MHC class I molecules. Therefore, the current study used homology modelling to investigate the peptide-binding domains of chicken MHC class I molecules belonging to the B4, B12, B15 and B19 haplotypes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to understand the peptide-binding properties of these molecules based on their structures. The assessment indicated that the models were of high quality in terms of their folding and they were suitable for structure-based T cell epitope prediction. The structural characteristics of the peptide-binding properties of these MHC class I molecules were described in the results section. Only four haplotypes with known motifs were selected in this study. However, it is possible to use this solution to predict T cell epitopes of MHC class I molecules belonging to different haplotypes for other antigens in chickens, because the only difference would be the increased number of peptides required for molecular docking.",

Some potential epitopes were also shared by several haplotypes. Chickens used for meat and egg production are always heterozygotes, so the identification of these shared T cell epitopes will facilitate the development of broad-spectrum protective vaccines for chickens.

A DNA vaccine expressing HA from A/Goose/Gong Dong/1/96 (H5N1) has been found to elicit antibody responses and protect chickens against challenge with HPAI virus [25] . Methods used for producing the HA-expression DNA vaccine were adopted when preparing the DNA expression plasmid pCAGG-NP. NP antibody responses were detected in immunized chickens, suggesting that this vaccine elicits successful immune responses to the NP antigen in chickens. The T cell responses were not detected directly in this study, but it was inferred that a successful antibody response would have been accompanied by a successful T cell response based on our knowledge of the DNA vaccine. Nine of the peptides were synthesized and used to stimulate sensitized splenic lymphocytes to verify that they were epitopes. Increases in the proliferation of CD8 + T lymphocytes and the secretion of chicken IFN-c demonstrated the antigenicity of these peptides. NP 89-97 (PKKTGGPIY) and NP 198-206 (KRGINDRNF) induced significant T cell responses in splenic lymphocytes. An analysis of the prediction results showed that NP 89-97 was predicted to be a T cell epitope for both B15 and B19, while NP 198-206 also belonged to the B19 haplotype. Thus, it is suggested that the major haplotype of the experimental SPF chickens might be B19. NP 89-97 also overlapped with a previously identified HLA-A68 restriction T cell epitope NP 91-99 (KTGGPIYKR) of the H3N2 AIV [7] .
