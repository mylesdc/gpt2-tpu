            "text": "There exists significant interest in developing statistical and computational tools for inferring 'who infected whom' in an infectious disease outbreak from densely sampled case data, with most recent studies focusing on the analysis of whole genome sequence data. However, genomic data can be poorly informative of transmission events if mutations accumulate too slowly to resolve individual transmission pairs or if there exist multiple pathogens lineages within-host, and there has been little focus on incorporating other types of outbreak data. We present here a methodology that uses contact data for the inference of transmission trees in a statistically rigorous manner, alongside genomic data and temporal data. Contact data is frequently collected in outbreaks of pathogens spread by close contact, including Ebola virus (EBOV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB), and routinely used to reconstruct transmission chains. As an improvement over previous, ad-hoc approaches, we developed a probabilistic model that relates a set of contact data to an underlying transmission tree and integrated this in the outbreaker2 inference framework. By analyzing simulated outbreaks under various contact tracing scenarios, we demonstrate that contact data significantly improves our ability to reconstruct transmission trees, even under realistic limitations on the coverage of the contact tracing effort and the amount of non-infectious mixing between cases. Indeed, contact data is equally or more informative than fully sampled whole genome sequence data in certain scenarios. We then use our method to analyze the early stages of the 2003 SARS outbreak in Singapore and describe the range of transmission scenarios consistent with contact data and genetic sequence in a probabilistic manner for the first time. This simple yet flexible model can easily be incorporated into existing tools for outbreak reconstruction and should permit a better integration of genomic and epidemiological data for inferring transmission chains.",

The 'pairwise approach' begins with a model of disease transmission and attaches to this a genetic model that describes the pairwise genetic distance between putative transmission pairs [6] [7] [8] [9] . The 'phylogenetic approach' uses genetic data to infer the unobserved history of coalescent events between sampled pathogen genomes in the form of a phylogenetic tree and infers transmission trees consistent with this phylogeny using epidemiological data.

            "text": "However, WGS are not always informative of the transmission route of an epidemic. Firstly, genetic diversity across most outbreaks is low and a significant portion of genetic sequences expected to be identical [17] , most prominently if the pathogen genome is small (e.g. human influenza [18] ), the mutation rate low (e.g. Mycobacterium tuberculosis [19] ), or the generation time (delay between primary and secondary infection) short (e.g. Streptococcus pneumoniae [20] ). In these cases, transmission pairs cannot be accurately identified by genetic data alone, resulting in an overall poorly resolved transmission tree. The informativeness of genetic sequence data is also limited by complex evolutionary behavior. Didelot et al. demonstrated that realistic genetic models accounting for within-host diversity, in which several strains coexist inside a host and can be transmitted and sampled, place significant uncertainty around ancestry allocation even when genetic diversity across the outbreak is high, as multiple transmission scenarios are consistent with the genetic data [15] . Pathogens displaying significant within-host diversity include those with long periods of carriage (e.g. Staphylococcus aureus [21] ) or a propensity for super-infections (Streptococcus pneumoniae [22] ). WGS is also uninformative of the direction of transmission between donor-recipient pairs if multiple sequences per host are not available [23] . Finally, WGS will generally not be available for all infected individuals, especially in resource poor settings. In the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, for example, sequences were collected in only 5% of cases [24] . Genetic data is therefore frequently of limited use in reconstructing transmission trees, and inference methods that rely heavily on it will perform poorly in such circumstances.",

A frequently collected and highly informative source of data on likely transmission routes is contact data, an integral component of early outbreak response that describes the network of reported contacts with infected individuals. Contact data provided most of the information used to reconstruct transmission chains during Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) [25] , Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) [26] and Ebola [1, 27, 28] epidemics, and is routinely collected in outbreaks of HIV [29] and Tuberculosis [30] . Contact data can be classified as 'exposure' data and or 'contact tracing' data. Exposure data describes contacts between a given case and their potential infectors and is an intrinsic part of case definition in diseases with person-to-person transmission. Contact tracing data describes contacts between confirmed/probable cases and individuals they could have infected: it is used for active case discovery and rapid isolation and is an integral part of containment strategy. Importantly, both types of contact data potentially contain information on the topology of the transmission tree.",

As an improvement over other approaches, the integration of a full contact model reduces the reliance on high quality genetic data for accurate inference. We evaluate the performance of this new model and compare the value of the different types of data for inferring who infects whom, using a variety of simulated outbreak scenarios. We then apply our approach to the early stages of the 2003 SARS outbreak in Singapore, integrating the available data on contact structures and genome sequences in a single statistical framework for the first time.

Statistical confidence in ancestry allocation as defined by the average Shannon entropy of the posterior distribution of potential infectors for each case, for which a value of 0 indicates complete posterior support for a given ancestry and higher values indicates lower statistical confidence, was also low (S2 Fig) . Including genetic data improved both the accuracy of inference and the statistical confidence in these assignments.

When adding this data to the purely temporal outbreaker model, the accuracy in reconstructing EBOV outbreaks increased from 9% to 44%.

Under the assumption that the reported contacts were very likely to be epidemiologically relevant, by fixing the non-transmission contact rate \u03bb at 1e-4, contact data significantly changed the posterior distribution of ancestries (Fig 3B and 3C ). As expected under these assumptions, transmission links in line with reported contacts were better supported. For example, the most likely infector of cases sin2677 and sin2774 was sin2500 when including contact data (Fig 3C) , instead of sin2748 in the default analysis ( Fig  3B) . Even though these transmission events were less likely under the genetic likelihood, as they implied the accumulation of 2 and 3 mutations, respectively, rather than 1 and 2 mutations, these ancestries were supported by the contact data and were therefore credible under our model.

A similar change in the inferred infection times of sin2500 and sin2748, driven by the contact data, reversed the directionality of their consensus infectious relationship, even though this directionality was not provided in the contact data.

The posterior distribution of transmission networks therefore spanned the contact network, with 6 of the 12 ancestries remaining fixed. This rigid topology of plausible transmission networks resulted in low variance among the remaining ancestries, producing essentially a single posterior tree. Notably, this analysis proposed several new ancestries (sin2679 to sin842, sin842 to sin847 and sin848 to sin850) rejected with a \u03bb value of 1e-4 and had a substantially lower average log-likelihood (-647.4 compared to -579.2).

In contrast, contact tracing is routinely conducted during outbreak response, and therefore provides a valuable additional window of information on transmission events without placing an additional burden on field epidemiologists.

However, a prospective model of this sort is considerably more complex to develop in a statistically tractable manner and has necessitated the assumption of a single index case, whereas multiple infectious introductions are easily accounted for in our contact likelihood. Furthermore, their approach does not explicitly model under-reporting of contacts, and therefore does not allow valuable prior information on the coverage of the contact tracing effort to inform the analysis.

For example, if most contacts in an outbreak are expected to have been reported, the prior on the contact reporting coverage \u03b5 can be shifted to provide greater support for higher values, reducing support for ancestries that lack a contact. \u03b5 could even be fixed at a value of 1, meaning a reported contact is required for a given transmission pair to be inferred, given the assumption that every contact has been reported. Similarly, as shown for the 2003 SARS outbreak, an informative prior on the non-infectious contact probability \u03bb should generally be used. As most contact tracing efforts are conducted under the belief that non-transmission pairs experience contacts with significantly lower probability than transmission pairs, the prior on \u03bb should provide support for lower values, in turn placing greater weight on reported contacts when assigning ancestries.",

As the contacts are undated, the model does not consider that they are only indicative of transmission events if they occur during the infectious period of the infector, potentially resulting in overconfident ancestry assignments if contacts frequently occur outside this time period. However, as epidemiologists generally only record meaningful contacts occurring within likely windows of infection, the assumption that recorded contacts represent epidemiologically plausible transmission pairs appears reasonable. As currently implemented, our model also does not account for different weights between contacts, which could be useful for example to stratify different types of sexual intercourse by their risk of HIV transmission [48] , or TB contacts by their duration of contact (e.g. household vs. casual). However, it could be easily extended to do so by using separate parameters for the reporting coverage (e.g. \u03b5 1 , \u03b5 2 , \u03b5 3 ) and non-infectious contact probability (e.g. \u03bb 1 , \u03bb 2 , \u03bb 3 ) of each type of contact. Furthermore, the contact model is undirected and treats exposure data and contact tracing data equally, resulting in a loss of information about the potential directionality of the infectious interaction which must instead be inferred from other data. Directionality could be incorporated with relative ease by treating reported contacts as asymmetric (individual i contacting individual j is distinct from j contacting i) and relating this to the infector-infectee relationship in the putative transmission tree (I infecting j is distinct from j infecting I). However, the current model generally inferred directionality successfully from temporal data simulated under realistic delay distributions (Fig 1) .",

The likelihoods of pairwise genetic distances are treated as independent, when in fact they are dependent on the underlying infectious relationships between cases (e.g. the genetic relatedness of case A and its infector B is dependent on the infector of B). Similarly, by considering only genetic distances, our method disregards histories of shared mutations between genomes. These assumptions can result in loss of information and potential misinterpretation of genetic signals, especially when evolutionary histories are complex [38] .

The model considers undated, undirected, binary contact data, such that the contact status c i,j is set to 1 if contact is reported between individuals i and j and set to 0 otherwise. The model is hierarchical and describes two processes: the occurrence of contacts and the reporting of contacts. Transmission pairs experience contact with probability \u03b7. This formulation accounts for the possibility of transmission occurring without direct contact, for example by indirect environmental contamination as is observed with Clostridium difficile [52] . Sampled, infected individuals that do not constitute a transmission pair experience contact with probability \u03bb, the non-infectious contact probability. Contacts that have occurred, either between transmission pairs or non-transmission pairs, are then reported with probability \u03b5, the contact reporting coverage. Contacts that have not occurred are reported with probability z, the false positive reporting rate. We make two assumptions to simplify this model, which can be relaxed in future work if necessary. Firstly, we assume that direct contact is necessary for transmission and set \u03b7 to 1. Inferring transmission chains from temporal, genetic and contact data Furthermore, we assume that false reporting of contacts that have not occurred is negligible and set z to zero. This model allows us to define a contact likelihood O 4 , describing the probability of observing the contact data C (a symmetrical, binary, NxN adjacency matrix with zeros on its diagonal) given a proposed transmission tree and parameters \u03b5 and \u03bb.

For a mathematical description of the relationship between \u03c8 and \u03bb, see S3 Text. At each grid point, 100 outbreaks were simulated, with a single initial infection in a susceptible population of 200 individuals. Simulations were run for 100 days, or until no more infectious individuals remained. The first 60 ancestries of each outbreak were reconstructed four times using the R package outbreaker2, using combinations of times of symptom onset (T), contact data (C) and WGS (G): T, TC, TG and TCG. For each analysis, one MCMC chain was run for 10,000 iterations with a thinning frequency of 1/50 and a burn-in of 1,000 iterations. The prior distributions used for \u03b5 and \u03bb were uninformative (Beta(1,1) ), and default priors used otherwise.",

As the number of non-transmission contacts was assumed to be low and a total of 6 contacts were reported in an outbreak of 13 cases, the proportion of contacts reported was believed to be about 50%. The prior on \u03b5 was therefore chosen as Beta (5, 5) . Several priors on the non-transmission contact rate \u03bb were tested; Beta(1, 10), Unif(0, 1), a fixed value of 0 and a fixed value of 1e-4. The priors on the mutation rate \u03bc and proportion of cases sampled \u03c0 were uninformative. The MCMC chain was run for 1e7 iterations with a thinning frequency of 1/50 and a burn-in of 1,000 iterations. green lines correspond to transmission pairs, red lines to non-transmission pairs. Dashed green lines represent contacts between transmission pairs that were not reported. C) The outbreak was reconstructed using temporal and genomic data, and the consensus transmission tree, describing the modal posterior infector for each case, determined. Green lines correspond to correctly inferred ancestries, red lines to incorrectly inferred ancestries. The accuracy of outbreak reconstruction was 46%.
