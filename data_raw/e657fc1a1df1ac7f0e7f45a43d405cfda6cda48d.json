Severe EV-A71 and CV-A16 infections may be associated with life-threatening complications. However, the pathogenic mechanisms underlying these severe clinical and pathological features remain incompletely understood. Lipids are known to play critical roles in multiple stages of the virus replication cycle. The specific lipid profile induced upon virus infection is required for optimal virus replication. The perturbations in the host cell lipidomic profiles upon enterovirus infection have not been fully characterized. To this end, we performed ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-quadrupole-time of flight-mass spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-Q-TOF-MS)-based lipidomics to characterize the change in host lipidome upon EV-A71 and CV-A16 infections. Our results revealed that 47 lipids within 11 lipid classes were significantly perturbed after EV-A71 and CV-A16 infection. Four polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), namely, arachidonic acid (AA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), docosapentaenoic acid (DPA), and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), were consistently upregulated upon EV-A71 and CV-A16 infection. Importantly, exogenously supplying three of these four PUFAs, including AA, DHA, and EPA, in cell cultures significantly reduced EV-A71 and CV-A16 replication. Taken together, our results suggested that enteroviruses might specifically modulate the host lipid pathways for optimal virus replication. Excessive exogenous addition of lipids that disrupted this delicate homeostatic state could prevent efficient viral replication. Precise manipulation of the host lipid profile might be a potential host-targeting antiviral strategy for enterovirus infection.",

Enteroviruses have non-segmented, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genomes that measure around 7.5 kilobases [1] . There are 15 species in the genus Enterovirus, namely, Enterovirus A to L and Rhinovirus A to C. Among members of the species Enterovirus A, enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) and coxsackievirus A16 (CV-A16) are two of the most common causes of recurrent community outbreaks of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) among children worldwide and particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. For example, in mainland China, recurrent large outbreaks of HFMD involving >120,000-600,000 patients have been reported since 1998 [2, 3] . Outbreaks of EV-A71 and CV-A16 infections with severe or fatal cases have also been reported in Malaysia, Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam, and Australia [4] . Importantly, severe EV-A71 and CV-A16 infections are associated with life-threatening complications, such as aseptic meningitis, encephalitis, myocarditis, non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema with respiratory failure, and death [1, 5] . However, the pathogenic mechanisms underlying these clinical and pathological features are incompletely understood.",

Viruses, including enteroviruses, may utilize lipids as receptors or entry co-factors for virus entry [6, 7] , as building blocks or regulators of the viral replication complex [8, 9] , as well as signaling factors to facilitate the cellular distribution of viral proteins, and the trafficking, assembly, and release of virus particles [10, 11] . Interestingly, viruses require a repertoire of host lipids to complete their life cycle. Inhibitions of key lipogenesis enzymes can downregulate virus replication [12] . However, when supplied in excess, these lipids can similarly perturb efficient virus replication [13] . Together, these evidences suggest that the complete lipid landscape induced upon virus infection is required for optimal virus replication.

The retention time shift and mass accuracy of lipid standards ranged from \u22120.12%-4.73% and \u22127.7-4.13 ppm, respectively. The coefficient of variation (CV) of all internal standards in cell samples and the QC samples were lower than 18% and 15%, respectively. These results indicated that the operation repeatability was satisfactory. To evaluate the stability of the analytical batch, the CV values of all mass features in the quality control (QC) samples were calculated. A total of 98.70% and 93.32% of the features measured in the negative and positive mode, respectively, exhibited CV values of <30%, indicating that the analytical batch was stable with minimal variations. Taken together, these results showed that the analytical method was reliable and the observed differences among the test samples represented true physiological differences, rather than technical errors [15] .",

Omics-based analytical method assessments and statistical analyses showed that our unbiased lipidomics approach was reliable in identifying significant differences in the host lipid profiles during enterovirus infection.

In corroboration with our findings, a recent report also showed that human rhinovirus A, another important human pathogenic picornavirus, induces substantial fatty acid modifications in human bronchial epithelial cells [24] . AA, DHA, DPA, and EPA are all polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). AA is an omega-6 PUFA, while DHA, DPA, and EPA are omega-3 PUFAs [25] . It has been previously shown that PUFA play key roles in inflammatory processes [9, 13, 26] . AA is a precursor to pro-inflammatory mediators such as prostaglandins (PG) and leukotrienes (LT), as well as lipoxins, which are endogenous anti-inflammatory, pro-resolving molecules reducing tissue injury and chronic inflammation [27] . DHA and EPA inhibit lipopolysaccharide-induced and lipopeptide-induced cyclooxygenase-2 expression and thus the inflammatory response in epithelial and dendritic cells [28, 29] . Moreover, lipids derived from EPA (Resolvin E series) and DHA (Resolvin D series, maresins, and protectins) are involved in the resolution of inflammation and exhibit anti-inflammatory properties [26, 30] . The omega-3 and omega-6 PUFAs interact in a delicate manner to regulate the inflammatory response. For example, omega-3 PUFAs such as DHA and EPA may serve as competitive substrates for omega-6 PUFA metabolism to decrease AA-derived eicosanoids and their effects on inflammation [31] .",

This corroborated with our previous observation that fatty acids, including AA, possesses antiviral activity against coronaviruses [13] . Taken together, these results suggested that like coronaviruses, EV-A71 and CV-A16 might modulate specific lipid pathways in the host lipid profile to achieve an intricate homeostasis to facilitate their replication. Excessive exogenous addition of lipids might therefore disrupt this delicate homeostatic state and prevent efficient viral replication. Corroborating with our recent identification of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) as a broad-spectrum antiviral treatment, precise manipulation of the host lipid profile might therefore be a potential host-targeting antiviral strategy for enterovirus infection [33] .",

Archived clinical isolates of EV-A71 and CV-A16 isolated from patients with HFMD were available at the Department of Microbiology, The University of Hong Kong. The viruses were cultured in RD cells in serum-free DMEM supplemented with 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 g/mL streptomycin. The supernatants were harvested when cytopathic effects (CPE) were observed and centrifuged to generate the viral stocks. The virus stocks were titrated by plaque assay on VeroE6 cells and stored at \u221280 \u2022 C, as previously described. Briefly, confluent VeroE6 cells were infected with 10-fold serial viral dilutions. The cells were incubated with diluted viruses at 37 \u2022 C for 1 h and subsequently overlaid with 1% low-melting-point agarose (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). The cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde as the plaques were observed and then stained with 0.2% crystal violet.

The cells (four biological replicates per group) were collected for cellular lipid extraction at 4 hpi. Lipid extraction was performed for liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis according to a previously described protocol with slight modifications [34] . Briefly, 550 \u00b5L of ice-cold 150 mM ammonium bicarbonate solution was added to dissociate cells and 50 \u00b5L of cell suspension was used for DNA extraction for normalization [35] . A total of 250 \u00b5L of methanol containing IS and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) was added to the wells. Then, 2 mL of chloroform/methanol (v/v 2:1) was added, followed by vortexing and centrifugation at 4500 rpm for 10 min at 4 \u2022 C. The bottom phase was transferred to glass vials and dried in a Labconco Centrivap cold trap concentrator for storage at \u221280 \u2022C. The dried samples were reconstituted in 25 \u00b5L of chloroform-methanol (1:1, v/v) and diluted to 1:10 of the original concentration of cell lysate in 225 \u00b5L IPA-ACN-water (2:1:1, v/v/v) for LC-MS analysis [36] . Inactivation of virus infectivity was confirmed before further processing, as previously described, with some modifications [13, 33] . UPLC-ESI-Q-TOF-MS analysis was performed, as previously described, with slight modifications [13] . Briefly, the lipid extract was analyzed using an Acquity UPLC system coupled to a Synapt G2-Si High Definition Mass Spectrometry (HDMS) system (Waters Corp., Milford, MA, USA). The chromatography was performed on a Waters ACQUITY CSH C18 column (100 \u00d7 2.1 mm; 1.7 \u00b5m) coupled to an Acquity CSH C18 VanGuard pre-column (5 \u00d7 2.1 mm; 1.7 \u00b5m) (Waters; Milford, MA, USA). The mobile phase A was 60:40 acetonitrile:water (v/v) with 10 mM ammonium formate and 0.1% formic acid. The mobile phase B for positive mode was 90:10 isopropanol:acetonitrile (v/v) with 10 mM ammonium formate and 0.1% formic acid. The mobile phase B for negative mode was 90:10 isopropanol:acetonitrile (v/v) with 10 mM ammonium acetate [37] . Gradient elution applied for UPLC-MS analysis was described in Table S3 . The column and autosampler temperature were maintained at 55 \u2022 C and 4 \u2022 C, respectively. The injection volume was 7 \u00b5L. The mass spectral data were acquired in both positive and negative modes. The capillary voltage was maintained at 2.5kV (positive mode) and 2.0 kV (negative mode). The sampling cone voltage and source offset were maintained at 30 V and 60 V, respectively. Nitrogen was used as desolvation gas at a flow rate of 800 L/h. The source and desolvation temperatures were maintained at 120 \u2022 C and 400 \u2022 C, respectively. Mass spectra were acquired over the m/z range of 100-1500. The SYNAPT G2-Si HDMS system was calibrated using sodium formate clusters and operated in sensitivity mode. Leucine enkephalin was used as a lock mass for all experiments. MS/MS acquisition was operated in the same parameters as in MS acquisition. Collision energy was applied in the range of 30-45 eV for fragmentation to allow putative identification and structural elucidation of the significant lipids.",

The lipids were dissolved in 2% ethanol and 2% ethanol alone was used as \"Control\". The cells were then infected with either EV-A71 or CV-A16 (MOI = 10.0). At 1 hpi, the cells were washed three times with Dulbecco's modified eagle medium (DMEM) and then replenished with lipid-supplemented medium for 4 h of incubation. The cell lysates were then collected for qRT-PCR. Data represented means and standard deviations.
