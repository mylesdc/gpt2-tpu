            "text": "The present study demonstrated the use of the Linear Quantitative Profiling Method (LQPM) to evaluate the quality of Alkaloids of Sophora flavescens (ASF) based on chromatographic fingerprints in an accurate, economical and fast way. Both linear qualitative and quantitative similarities were calculated in order to monitor the consistency of the samples. The results indicate that the linear qualitative similarity (LQLS) is not sufficiently discriminating due to the predominant presence of three alkaloid compounds (matrine, sophoridine and oxymatrine) in the test samples; however, the linear quantitative similarity (LQTS) was shown to be able to obviously identify the samples based on the difference in the quantitative content of all the chemical components. In addition, the fingerprint analysis was also supported by the quantitative analysis of three marker compounds. The LQTS was found to be highly correlated to the contents of the marker compounds, indicating that quantitative analysis of the marker compounds may be substituted with the LQPM based on the chromatographic fingerprints for the purpose of quantifying all chemicals of a complex sample system. Furthermore, once reference fingerprint (RFP) developed from a standard preparation in an immediate detection way and the composition similarities calculated out, LQPM could employ the classical mathematical model to effectively quantify the multiple components of ASF samples without any chemical standard. 2 / 15 Fig 5.

            "text": "The dried root of Sophora flavescens Ait., known as KuShen (Sophorae Flavescentis Radix) in China, is widely used in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) for its effect of clearing heat and dampness, killing parasites, and inducing diuresis [1] . Modern research has also shown various pharmacological effects of Alkaloids of Sophora flavescens (ASF), such as antimicrobial, antiinflammatory, anti-allergic, anti-tumor, anti-arrhythmia, anti-hepatitis, and regulation of the immune system [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . Among many chemical components from the ASF, quinolizidine alkaloids such as matrine (MT), sophoridine (SPR) and oxymatrine (OMT) have been demonstrated to be important active compounds [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] . The quality of ASF as herbal medicine is typically evaluated and controlled by the total alkaloid content. In fact, the National Drug Standard for ASF in China is based on determining the total alkaloid content using a titration method [30] . In practice, the quality of ASF is typically evaluated based on the quantitative content of the marker compounds (e.g., MT, OMT and SPR) determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or capillary electrophoresis (CE) method [31, 32] . But quantitative determination of multiple marker compounds requires significant amount of efforts and resources. In addition to quantitative analysis of the marker compounds, chromatographic fingerprint has been widely adopted for quality assessment of herbal medicines by regulatory agencies, such as US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), European Medicines Agency (EMA), and China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) [33] . However, the chromatographic fingerprints are commonly analyzed for qualitative similarity among the test samples. The quantitative contents of the chemical components in herbal medicines are not analyzed to compare the similarity of the samples. For example, Zhang et al used a qualitative hierarchical clustering method to analyze the chromatographic fingerprints of the alkaloids from commercial Sophorae Flavescentis Radix, and also determined the content of multiple marker compounds for the purpose of quality assessment [34] . They confirmed the usefulness of chromatographic fingerprinting in quality evaluation of herbal medicines, but also acknowledged that direct quantitation of multiple marker compounds was not always feasible due to the availability of the standards for the marker compounds.",

The difference in the quantity of the chemical components is not addressed by qualitative similarity analysis. But this is not the case currently. Quantitative similarity analysis has been developed as a measure to detect the difference in the quantitative contents of the herbal samples and has been successfully applied to quality evaluation of some traditional Chinese medicines [37] [38] [39] . In this study, the Linear Quantitative Profiling Method (LQPM) was first used to evaluate both linear qualitative and quantitative similarities of the chromatographic fingerprints of the ASF samples. Three alkaloid marker compounds (MT, SPR and OMT) were also quantitated using a validated HPLC method, and the relationship between the linear quantitative similarity (LQTS) and the content of the marker compounds was also investigated. LQPM is a low consumed and highly effective way compared with any multi-marker quantitatively determination method. As a complex multiple component system, ASF samples can be firstly identified and secondly quantified by LQPM from an overall mode. Quality consistency of ASF samples has been successfully monitored and effectively proved by our research results.",

In fact, r is always less than unity, however b can be in range of 0-1, thus there is nearly an orthogonality correlation between r and b, which indicates that the LQTS assess is more important than LQLS. In addition, as responses of different detectors are dissimilar to various fingerprint components, weight correction factor should be taken into consideration. However, the weight correction factor can be ignored for the homologue fingerprints lying in profiles. The composition similarities of LQLS and LQTS can be used to analyse the contribution of some fingerprint peaks. They can be calculated out at once when one fingerprint peak area was input into the numerator in Eqs 1 and 2, respectively, while the denominator were unchanged. Therefore both LQLS and LQTS robustly construct the two dimentional orthogonal similarities for reasonably evaluating fingerpring profiling of TCM and herbal medicines. ",

However, the quantitative analysis requires the reference standards, calibration and more time. Even if quantitation is feasible when the reference standards are available, the quantitative results are only meaningful when acceptance criteria for the specific compounds exist. Unfortunately this is not the case for most of the herbal medicines. Therefore, fingerprint analysis becomes more critical if it is consistent with the quantitative results.",

The relationship between LQTS (b) and the quantitative results of the marker compounds is further explored. First, the weight content of each marker compound in all the samples was averaged to generate its average content ( z), then the percentage of the ith marker content (P i %) for 27 samples (seen in S1 Table) was calculated out (shown in Eq 5) using a mass coefficient f j \u00bc m R m j . Secondly, the mean of P i % values of the three marker compounds in each sample (P 3C %) was calculated according to Eq 6. Meanwhile, R% was calculated by Eq 4. Finally, P i %, P 3C % and R% of 27 samples were respectively plotted vs. b as shown in Fig 5. Linear regression shows that the correlation coefficients between P i % and b are 0.9471, 0.9664 and 0.9597 for MT, SPR and OMT, respectively. In comparison, the correlation coefficient between P 3C % and b is significantly higher (0.9884). This indicates that b is highly correlated to the content of the marker compounds. It is not surprising that b is also highly correlated to the apparent content similarity (R%) as shown in Fig 5E, and the correlation coefficient between R% and b reached the most excellent value of 0.9950. This demonstrates that LQTS (b) is a reliable substitute for the quantitative content of the marker compounds and is very effective in quantitatively evaluating the quality of herbal medicines. Therefore, the multiple markers analyses for quality control can be substituted by LQPM, which is simple, briefly, accurate and economic. ASF reference fingerprint contained 228.77mg/g of MT, 240.79 mg/g of SPR and 89.50 mg/g of OMT, and the total content of the tri-marker was 559.06 mg/g which was up to 70% (g/g) when water was taken out (please see the water content in below section 'Overall distribution of basic substances in ASF samples'). So we can immediately calculate each content of the three marker compounds according to b. From Table 3 , the biggest error was not more than 3.5% for \u0394E 1 = R% \u2212 P 3C %, \u0394E 2 = b \u2212 P 3C % and \u0394E 3 = b \u2212 R%. In a word, LQTS (b) is a better way to determine the overall contents of ASF.",

The Pearson correlation coefficient R 2 = 0.1194 (n = 29) reflects that we cannot thoroughly evaluate quality of TCM in the accurate way by only using LQLS (r all more than 0.996). So it is much necessary to use the second measure of LQTS (b) and it is the highest level evaluation for assessing fingerprint profiles of TCM. Fig 6 nearly displays an orthogonality correlation between r and b, which indicates that the LQTS assess is more important than LQLS. Therefore LQPM is a novel fingerprint assessing method like SQFM [37] , in which both LQLS and LQTS are used together for evaluating TCM quality, and a statistical error is used to monitor the method itself.",

The average percent content of total alkaloid was 71.3%, as determined by an acid-base back-titration method in which 10.0 mL of sulfuric acid (0.05 mol/L) was added to the sample, and sodium hydroxide standard solution (0.1 mol/L) was used as a titrant to titrate the excessive sulfuric acid. The titration was carried out using methyl red as the indicator, with the titer expressed in terms of OMT (each 1 mL of sodium hydroxide is equivalent to 26.44 mg of OMT). The water content of all samples was determined to be 20.1% by using Karl Fischer titration with a titer of 3 mg H 2 O/mL. According to the above results, we can calculate the amount of total alkaloid content to be no less than 89.2% (calculated on the dried basis), which meets the requirement of no less than 70% in the national standards [30] . About 0.97% of total saponin was obtained by a colorimetric method at 520 nm by using vanillin-perchloric acid as the coloration system and oleanolic acid as the reference substance. About 0.69% of total amino acids was analyzed by visible spectrophotometry at 570 nm with ninhydrin as the developer and L-tyrosine as the reference substance. Method validations, including precision, stability, reproducibility and accuracy of recovery tests, were performed. The methods met the quantitative requirements as the recoveries were found to be between 98.5% and 100.7% (RSD 1.5%) and all corresponding RSD values did not exceed 0.5%. The 27 batches of ASF samples and the reference sample showed good consistency in the distribution of basic substances. But just like the quantitation of three marker compounds, none of these contents for certain total substances can discriminate the differences of the ASF samples.",

All the test samples showed similar linear qualitative similarity (r) due to the predominant presence of three alkaloid compounds (MT, SPR and OMT) in the Alkaloids of Sophora flavescens; however, the linear quantitative similarity (b) were able to identify the difference among the different samples due to the variations in the quantitative content of the chemical components. Three marker alkaloids (MT, SPR and OMT) were also quantitated using the validated HPLC method to prove the effectiveness of quantitative profiling. Three samples were detected as qualitatively similar based on the quantitative data of the three marker compounds. The LQPM was able to correctly discover that one of the three samples (S18) actually had acceptable quality (Grade 1) considering its linear qualitative and quantitative similarity. In addition, two more samples were identified as dissimilar (S17 belonged to Grade 2 and S19 belonged to Grade 4) based on different linear quantitative similarities. This demonstrates that LQPM can be used to reliably evaluate the quality of ASF samples. The linear quantitative similarity was also shown to be highly correlated to the content of the marker compounds, indicating that quantitative analysis of the marker compounds may be substituted with LQPM based on the chromatographic fingerprints for the purpose of quantifying the multiple components of a complex sample system. Furthermore, once reference fingerprint (RFP) developed and the composition similarities calculated out, LQPM could employ the classical mathematical model to effectively quantify the multiple components of ASF samples without any chemical standard.",
