Although the fecal-oral route is generally accepted, an increased number of reports indicate that airborne transmission may contribute to PEDV outbreak. Here, we show that PEDV could cause typical diarrhea in piglets through a nasal spray. Firstly, PEDV can develop a transient nasal epithelium infection. Subsequently, PEDV-carrying dendritic cells (DCs) allow the virus to be transferred to CD3 + T cells via the virological synapse. Finally, virus-loaded CD3 + T cells reach the intestine through the blood circulation, leading to intestinal infection via cellto-cell contact. Our study provides evidence for airborne transmission of a gastrointestinal infected coronavirus and illustrates the mechanism of its transport from the entry site to the pathogenic site.",

            "text": "A large-scale outbreak of porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED), characterized by watery diarrhea, dehydration, and vomiting, with up to 90% mortality in suckling piglets, occurred in swine farms in Asia, Europe, and America [1] [2] [3] . As the causative agent of PED, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) has spread rapidly between pig farms even over long distances, demonstrating greater transmission potential than other seasonal diarrhea viruses 4, 5 . Fecal-oral transmission is believed to be the main mode of PEDV transmission 6 . As many large-scale pig farms in developed countries are equipped with improved disinfection and management systems (sanitation of the pigsty and feed safety are strictly controlled) 7, 8 , the pathogen is less likely to be spread via the digestive tract (feed or feces). These observations suggest that PEDV may have other routes of infection. Recently, many researchers have highlighted the possible role of airborne transmission of PEDV. Increasing evidence for airborne transmission of gastrointestinal infectious diseases has been reported (e.g., Norwalk viruses and rotavirus) 9,10 , but the underlying mechanisms have not been confirmed. Additionally, if PED outbreaks occur in one farm, then neighboring farms are at an increased risk of PEDV infection, and the orientation of PEDV spread follows the prevailing winds in such areas 11, 12 . Accordingly, aerosolized particles from pig farms with PEDV outbreak can be identified. As found, PEDV can be detected in all sizes of aerosol particles, with the number of copies of the virus in the particles ranging from 1.3 \u00d7 10 6 (0.4-0.7 \u03bcm) to 3.5 \u00d7 10 8 RNA copies m \u22123 (9.0-10.0 \u03bcm) 13 . In addition, PEDV can survive for a long time (up to 9 months) in the environment and be transmitted over long distances in the field (even 10 miles from pig farms with a PEDV outbreak) 14, 15 . Therefore, the cross-talk between PEDV and the respiratory tract merits further attention.",

            "text": "Submucosal DCs are professional antigen-presenting cells with a potent capacity to capture luminal antigens by forming transepithelial dendrites (TEDs). Such antigen-bearings DCs migrate to the nearby lymph nodes, presenting foreign antigens to T cells and further initiating an effective adaptive immune response [20] [21] [22] . Paradoxically, submucosal DCs may sometimes be harnessed by viruses to help them overcome the epithelial barrier, serving as a \"Trojan Horse\" to evade antiviral immune responses and disseminate into the submucosal layer 23 . The infected DCs then migrate to the nearby lymph nodes and transmit the virus to T lymphocytes (productive or recessive infection) 24, 25 . Typically, HIV is a DC-hijacking virus, and DCs might be conducive to its pathogenesis, a mechanism that promotes HIV transmission and infection of CD4 + T cells and further dissemination into the body via the migration of T cells [26] [27] [28] [29] . Additionally, DCs are a crucial target of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) replication and a driver of dissemination 30 . Taken together, these data suggest that submucosal DCs in nasal cavity are likely to uptake PEDV and serve as a virus carrier to help PEDV enter and disseminate beyond the nasal mucosa. When DCs are hijacked by the virus, their endocytosis and antigen-processing abilities are limited, and the virus is maintained on dendrites for efficient transfer to T lymphocytes 31 . The virus can then modulate the migratory ability of T cells; sometimes the increased motility of infected T cells facilitates the use of motile cells as drivers to disseminate within and between tissues 29 . Viruscarrying lymphocytes can reach the small intestine and other structures via the blood circulation, penetrate the intestinal mucosa, and transmit the virus to target cells, becoming a vital source of infection 32, 33 . The virus-carrying lymphocytes transmit the virus to host cells, which is called transfer infection. For instance, researchers have suggested that varicella-zoster virus (VZV)-infected T cells can enter the gut and establish latency in enteric neurons in vivo 34 . Moreover, PEDV can enter the blood and induce viremia in suckling piglets, which implies that PEDV possesses the ability to colonize some cell types in the peripheral blood 35 .",

Piglets were assigned to 3 groups (I: Control, II: PEDV intranasal inoculation, and III: PEDV oral inoculation). Clinical signs included severe watery diarrhea with vomiting that were first detected in oral PEDV-inoculated piglets at 46 h post-infection (hpi). At 60 hpi, the intranasal inoculated piglets from group II began to exhibit classical PEDV symptoms, including acute, severe watery diarrhea, depression, and lethargy. Abundant yellow, foul-smelling watery stools were also observed around the perianal region of the piglets (Fig. 1a) . Then, the piglets were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium (100 mg kg \u22121 ) and sacrificed for macroscopic examination at 66 hpi. After intranasal inoculation, all piglets exhibited moderately thin and transparent intestinal walls in the small intestine, with an accumulation of large amounts of fluid in the intestinal lumen (Fig. 1a) . Pathological examination of the intestine of piglets with diarrhea after intranasal inoculation revealed multifocal to diffuse villous atrophy (Fig. 1b) . Immunofluorescence analysis (IFA) showed a large amount of PEDV-positive cells in the small intestine of piglets with diarrhea, and PEDV antigens were mainly observed in the cytoplasm of villus epithelial cells (Fig. 1b) . Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) showed viral RNA expression in different tissues of the piglets after intranasal inoculation. PEDV mainly colonized the jejunum and ileum, and peak viral RNA titers reached up to 5.19 log10 in the jejunum, this titer was significantly higher than that in the other tissues (Fig. 1c) . PEDV also showed a broad tissue tropism, and low-level RNA expression was detected in the epithelium of nasal and lung tissues (Fig. 1c) . Western blot results further validated the PEDV level in different tissues, and a significant quantity of PEDV N protein was detected in the jejunum and ileum. However, no immunoreactivity was observed with proteins of the nasal epithelium or lung despite the low level of RNA expression (Fig. 1d) .",

After nasal inoculation, the virus was first detected in the nasal mucosa, trachea, and lung, while no viral RNA was detected in the gastrointestinal tissue (Fig. 2a) . The virus showed a certain degree of replication in the nasal epithelium within 24 h, with RNA titers reaching a peak of 3.14 log10 within 12 h and declining at 24 hpi. At 24 h, many PEDV gene copies were detected in the jejunum and ileum at higher levels than those in other tissues. The nasal mucosa of piglets was isolated at different time points after intranasal infection to further investigate the replication features of PEDV in NECs. Similar to the PEDV RNA expression in the nasal epithelium, fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analyses showed that PEDV colonized NECs, with 0.79% positive cells observed at 3 h, and maintained the infection between 12 and 24 h (PEDV-positive cells ranging from 1.81 to 2.02%). In contrast, the level of virus in NECs declined at 66 hpi (Fig. 2b, c) . Moreover, after infection, the nasal cavity was fixed after infection for 12 h and subjected to IHC analysis. Virus-positive cells were unevenly distributed throughout the cytoplasm of NECs in regions I-IV (Fig. 2d, Supplementary Fig. 1c ). In contrast, section IV in which most DCs and other lymphocytes accumulated, showed an increased proportion of PEDV-positive cells (Fig. 2d, e) .",

After 12 h post intranasal administration of PEDV, the capture of luminal PEDV by DCs was detected in the nasal-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT) and lamina propria of the nasal mucosa in vivo (Fig. 4a, b) . We speculated PEDV might exploit submucosal DCs in the nasal cavity to enter and disseminate beyond the nasal mucosa. A NECM/DCs coculture system was used to study virus uptake by DCs ( Supplementary Fig. 3b ). Of note, DCs coculture or PEDV challenge did not modify the morphological characteristics of tight junctions ( Supplementary Fig. 3c ). Moreover, the TEER of the NECM/DCs coculture system was not influenced by DCs or PEDV. Barrier disruption was performed by the addition of EDTA to the apical medium ( Supplementary  Fig. 3d ). The apical side of the NECM/DCs coculture system was inoculated with fluorescence-labeled PEDV (Fig. 4c ). In the coculture system, inoculation with live PEDV resulted in a greater number of PEDV-loaded submucosal DCs than did inoculation with inactivated virus (Fig. 4d, e) . The number of virus-loaded submucosal DCs markedly increased with the increased PEDV inoculation dose (Fig. 4f) . To explain how PEDV entered the DCs in the coculture system, we used an antibody against histocompatibility complex class II (MHCII) to identify DCs in zorthogonal views using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) (Fig. 4g) . DCs were clearly visualized as enlarged TEDs across the tight junctions of NECs and had internalized luminal PEDV, while DCs in the control group were mostly beneath the epithelial cells (Fig. 4h ). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations of the NECM/DCs coculture system further confirmed that DCs extended dendrites into the filter and captured PEDV (Fig. 4i) . Integral PEDV virions could be found in the extended dendrites and cytoplasm of DCs on the basolateral side ( Fig. 4i ).",

To better understand the molecular cues required for DCs recruitment and TED formation in the nasal passage, we assessed the expression of many chemokines associated with DCs migration. Chemokine C-C motif ligand 25 (CCL25) was upregulated at both RNA and protein levels after PEDV inoculation (Fig. 5c, d) . Additionally, after PEDV inoculation, an increase in P65 in the nucleus and p-P65 in the cytoplasm confirmed the activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) in NECs (Fig. 5e ). However, pretreatment of the NECM with an inhibitor of NF-\u03baB (BAY 11-7082), but not with the DMSO control significantly reduced the number of PEDV-containing DCs and TEDs on the apical side in the coculture system ( Fig. 5f -h).",

PEDV was detected in CD3 + T cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of piglets within 24 h after intranasal inoculation. The proportion of virus-loaded CD3 + T cells increased at an early stage and peaked with 4.15% at 12 h ( Fig. 6a , b). Virus in CD3 + cells may be acquired from DCs, which take up virus into the lumen across the nasal mucosa, migrate, and engage with T cells. Coculture of DCs and T cells was employed to study To detect whether PEDV could induce the conjugate structure between DCs and CD3 + T cells, we performed a conjugate formation experiment. FACS analysis of conjugate formation revealed that 42.8% of PEDV-treated DCs formed conjugates with T cells, while DCs in the control group and PEDV (inactivated)-treated group showed reduced conjugate formation compared with those in the live virus treatment group (9-15% of PBS or PEDV (inactivated)-treated DCs formed conjugates with T cells) (Fig. 6f) . Furthermore, DC/T cell conjugates induced by PEDV were observed by CLSM, which revealed virus in the conjugate structures formed by the two cells (Fig. 6g) . TEM imaging also showed that PEDV was taken up by DCs located within large compartments (Fig. 6h , arrowheads) at the synapse, a cell-cell contact that involves extensive interdigitation (black frame) of the respective cell membranes (Fig. 6h) . The combination of the membrane encasement, deep virion channels and interdigitation between the donor and target cell membranes served to ensure that PEDV transfer to T cells occurs in a highly secluded environment. The panel II of Fig. 6h shows that PEDV was successfully transferred from DCs to T cells, and integrated coronavirus-like particles (arrowheads) were present in the cytoplasm of T cells.",

Next, to evaluate whether PEDV-loaded T cells could reach the small intestine, we performed a competitive T cell autotransfusion assay in piglets. After 24 h, more CFSE-labeled T cells (coculture with PEDV-treated DCs) entered the blood circulation and jejunum than did CM-Dil-labeled T cells (coculture with mock infection DCs) (Fig. 7a, b) . Observations of frozen sections of the jejunum further confirmed the FACS results (Fig. 7c) . We further assessed whether the transferred PEDV-loaded T cells could transmit the virus to host cells. T cells (donor cells) acquired the virus from DCs and were sorted and cocultured with PEDV-susceptible Vero cells (recipient cells) in two forms, contact or noncontact (Fig. 7d ). Among CD3 + T cells, 3% were PEDV-positive in both the contact and noncontact groups at the original stage. Surprisingly, PEDV-positive T cells again appeared in both groups after 96 h of coculture. Particularly in the contact group, as much as 51.9% of PEDV + CD3 + T cells were detected, which was much higher than those in the direct contact group (Fig. 7e ). As shown in Fig. 7f , the absence of virus in the supernatant at 2 h eliminated the possibility of residual PEDV outside the T cells in the medium. In contrast to Vero cells in the noncontact group, Vero cells in the contact group with T cells exhibited higher PEDV RNA expression levels and virus titers in the medium (Fig. 7f, g ). An apparent CPE appeared in Vero cells in the contact group at 96 h, while a mild lesion was observed in Vero cells in the noncontact group (Fig. 7h) . Moreover, in the contact group, we observed many Vero cells displaying dramatic changes in cellular morphology, with significant increases in membrane extensions in which the filopodia appeared to be very thick, essentially forming a large branch emanating from the central body of the cell and contacting T cells (Fig. 7i) .",

However, based on its previously reported airborne characteristics, we propose that another pathogenic pathway may be involved in PEDV infection in piglets 13, 14 . In this study, we demonstrate an alternative pathway of PEDV infection, in which PEDV can disseminate from the entry site (nasal epithelium) to the pathogenic site (intestinal mucosa) by utilizing immune cells.",

The longer incubation period observed in the intranasal inoculation group may be attributed to the unique dissemination pathway of the virus, which spreads from the nasal epithelium to the intestine. The nasal mucosa is the first site to be directly exposed to inhaled pathogens, representing an important portal for pathogen entry 39 . In our study, PEDV developed a transient nasal epithelium infection, and more virus was detected at the rear of the nasal cavity. Transient patterns of virus shedding were observed, with viral loads in tissues and host RNA expression peaking early in infection and decreasing over time. We speculate that PEDV primarily affects the nasal epithelium in a transient manner, by which the airborne virus can resume its activity and produce progeny virions in the nasal cavity. Moreover, according to previous research, DCs and many other lymphocytes mainly accumulate at the rear of the nasal cavity 17 .",

            "text": "An interaction between the virus and immune cells is frequently observed, and may benefit or impede the virus. DCs are widely distributed in the mucosal lamina propria of various tissues, such as the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and genital tracts. DCs have the ability to take up antigens at these sites, predisposing them to become primary targets for viral infection 27 . Submucosal DCs are characterized by the extension of cellular processes into the lumen for continuous surveillance 40, 41 . However, as a double-edged sword, the function of DCs is sometimes exploited by the virus to overcome the mucosal barrier. For instance, HIV-infected DCs are mainly responsible for establishing a foothold of infection 27 . DCs are exploited by VZV invading the mucosa and are known as the immune systems' Achilles heel during VZV infection 25 . Additionally, many other viruses, including Dengue virus, measles virus, and cytomegalovirus, can utilize DCs to enter the body, disseminate in humans, evade antiviral immune responses, and cause disease [42] [43] [44] . In our study, DCs formed TEDs to capture luminal PEDV virions in vitro and in piglets, and then helped PEDV overcome the nasal epithelial barrier. Furthermore, integral viral particles may be excluded from degradation by acid proteolysis for more efficient vesicle-mediated transfer to other cells 27 . Moreover, PEDV has evolved strategies to exploit DCs maturation to promote its dissemination, while unchanged levels of MHCII expression may induce interference with MHCIIassociated antigen presentation 45, 46 . The family of NF-\u03baB transcription factors plays a central role in coordinating the expression of a wide variety of chemokines, a family of small molecules that induce chemotaxis of neutrophils, mononuclear cells, or lymphocytes 47, 48 . In our study, activation of NF-\u03baB in NECs by PEDV was associated with the release of the chemokine CCL25 and mobilized DCs to accumulate in the submucosal regions. Taken together, these results imply that, although the virus can be released only from the apical side of the NECM, submucosal DCs may function as an important portal for PEDV entry into the nasal mucosa.",

The swine herd was seronegative for antibodies against PEDV, PRRSV, PRCV, TGEV, and porcine circovirus type 2. Each experimental group of pigs was housed in a separate room in a high-security isolation facility. All animal procedures and experiments were performed according to protocols PEDV intranasal inoculation. Female piglets (5 days old) with similar weight were allocated to 3 groups (3 piglets per group) with a completely random design using the random number generation function (Excel, Microsoft Corporation) and housed in three separate rooms 24 h prior to experiment (acclimation period). The three groups were (I) control, (II) PEDV intranasal inoculation, and (III) PEDV oral inoculation. Piglets in groups II and III were challenged with 1 ml PEDV (10 7 PFU ml \u22121 ) by nasal and oral inoculation. The nasal spray device used for nasal inoculation is commonly used for vaccine absorption by the nasal mucosa and has good atomization effects. In group I, the same volume of PBS was inoculated as a negative control. The animals were artificially fed with milk every 3 h throughout the experiment to meet or exceed the National Research Council (NRC, 2012) requirements for nutrients and energy for this size pig. After a challenge, the piglets were observed daily for symptoms of diarrhea. The piglets were housed under the conditions of controlled humidity (50 \u00b1 5%), temperature (30 \u00b1 1\u00b0C), and light (12-h light/12-h dark cycle, lights on at 8:00 AM). Investigators were not blinded to experimental groups. To further determine the dynamic changes in PEDV in piglets after nasal inoculation, we randomly assigned 18 piglets to two groups (I: control and II: PEDV intranasal inoculation), and the specific methods were the same as those mentioned above. Subsequently, three piglets from each group were euthanatized at 3, 12, and 24 h after virus inoculation. Investigators were not blinded to experimental groups.",
