Although many factors regulate ectodermal organogenesis, there is not any report about their functions in real-time study. Electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS), a non-invasive, real-time surveillance system, had been used to detect changes in organ cell layer thickness through quantitative monitoring of the impedance of a cell-to-microelectrode interface over time. It was shown to be a good method for identifying significant real-time changes of cells. The purpose of this study is to establish a combined bioengineered organ-ECIS model for investigating the real time effects of fibroblast growth factor-9 (FGF-9) on epithelial invagination in bioengineered ectodermal organs. We dissected epithelial and mesenchymal cells from stage E14.5 murine molar tooth germs and identified the real-time effects of FGF-9 on epithelial-mesenchymal interactions using this combined bioengineered organ-ECIS model. Results: Measurement of bioengineered ectodermal organ thickness showed that Fibroblast growth factor-9 (FGF-9) accelerates epithelial invagination in reaggregated mesenchymal cell layer within 3 days. Gene expression analysis revealed that FGF-9 stimulates and sustains early Ameloblastin and Amelogenin expression during odontogenesis.",

Despite diverse forms and functions, ectodermal organs exhibit common developmental features. Originating from adjacent layers of epithelial (ectodermal) and mes-enchymal (mesodermal or neural crest) tissues, the first visible sign of most ectodermal organs is a local epithelial thickening termed an ectodermal placode. Next, a condensation of mesenchymal cells, or papilla, forms under the placode. The ectodermal placode then buds into or out of the papilla in a process called epithelial invagination. Subsequent morphogenesis drives further development of the epithelial and mesenchymal components and is associated with epithelial folding and branching. This ultimately determines the final shape and size of ectodermal organs; however, it is epithelial invagination that regulates when and how ectodermal organs develop, a fact with important implications for future organ engineering and regeneration [for review see [1] ].",

Hence, future study requires a more accurate model. The multipotency of embryonic stem cells makes creation of a non-invasive, noninductive environment for the observation of specific growth factor functions within ectodermal organ development challenging.

Studies have shown that FGF-8 and FGF-9 are expressed within the murine molar epithelium: FGF-8 has a specific role in multicuspid odontogenesis [13, 14] ; therefore, in this study, we investigated the role of FGF-9, also present within the oral epithelium of the first branchial arch at stage E10. FGF-9 expression is restricted to the dental epithelium until epithelial budding at E11. Although not expressed in the mesenchyme, FGF-9 appears in the cap-stage enamel knot of the E13-E15 mouse embryo, spreading within the inner enamel epithelium until E18 [14] . This suggests that FGF-9 is an important factor during the initiation of tooth germ development. However, tissue slicing and staining cannot provide a real-time model for further investigation and, as FGF-9 is critical to embryonic development, a conventional transgenic approach could cause early defects, or even embryonic demise, interfering with in-depth study.",

It is a realtime, label-free, impedance-based method to study the activities of cells including morphological changes, locomotion, and other behaviors of cells directed by the cytoskeletons. When cells were added to the ECIS Arrays and attached to the electrodes, they play the roles as insulators and increased the impedance. As cells grow and cover the electrodes, the current is impeded in related with cell number, cell morphology, and cell attachment. When cells are stimulated, cell function and cell morphology will be changed and the impedance of cell-to-microelectrode will be changed. The data generated is impedance versus time. The high frequency impedance is caused by the increasing of cell numbers, whereas the low frequency impedance indicates the increasing of spaces between the cells. Previous study had reported that ECIS can be used to identify significant, real-time changes in organ layers caused by the invasive activities of cultured metastatic cells [16] .

In addition, FGF-9 can induce early expression of the homeobox protein Msx genes Msx-1 in mesenchymal cells (Additional file 1), which is consistent with previous research [14] . The experimental group also exhibited earlier epithelial differentiation in molar tooth germs at 1 and 10 days in vitro (Additional file 2 and 3). This indicated that the development of tooth germ was promoted by FGF-9, which inspired us to detect the role of FGF-9 in epithelial invagination.",

The absorbance of this colored solution can be quantified by measuring at a certain wavelength (usually between 500 and 600 nm) by a spectrophotometer. The absorption max is dependent on the solvent employed. This reduction takes place only when mitochondrial reductase enzymes are active, and therefore conversion can be directly related to the number of viable (living) cells.

The ECIS parameters include a frequency of 15,000 Hz and impedance data were recorded every 90 s. The black line represents the control group and the pink line represents the FGF-9 group. The vertical (dash) line represents the time of medium change. (A) Before adding epithelial cells and FGF-9 (40 ng/ml), it was necessary to allow mesenchymal cells to reaggregate as a stable layer in each well of the ECIS kit. We then added 2 \u00d7 10 5 mesenchymal cells to each well. Impedance data showed no difference between the two groups in the first 25 h, indicating no significant proliferation or death of mesenchymal cells. (B) The invasion test began after the addition of epithelial cells and FGF-9 (40 ng/ml). We added 2 \u00d7 10 5 epithelial cells to each well of the 8W10E kit. We added ordinary fresh medium to the control group (black line) and fresh medium with FGF-9 (40 ng/ml) to the FGF-9 group (pink line). tended to persist in its own manner (2-4, Figure 4B ). After a 163-h observation period, there was no great change in the control group impedance data, which remained stable (black line, Figure 4B ). We inferred that the well of the 8W10E kit did not provide enough space for further cell proliferation, making it pointless to continue the ECIS study beyond this time point (5, Figure 4B ). The impedance data showed that the bioengineered organ increased in thickness approximately fourfold within 7 days. During this period, electrical resistance increased from <400 \u03a9 to >1400 \u03a9 ( Figure 4B ). Although well size was limited during organ development, we attempted to improve the culture environment by changing the medium in the last 80 h. No further changes in impedance occurred in either the control or FGF-9 groups after this ( Figure 4B ), indicating that only epithelial thickening occurred.",

Owing to very low Amelogenin expression, we also detected Amelogenin expression at 1 h ( Figure 5B ) to determine why early impedance is lower in the FGF-9 than the control group. Ameloblastin was significantly elevated by FGF-9 at 12 h ( Figure 5A ) relative to the control group. Peak Ameloblastin expression was evident at 60 h in the FGF-9 group ( Figure 5A ). This suggests that FGF-9 accelerates early Ameloblastin expression and induces early accelerated epithelial invagination within 72-74 h. FGF-9 also accelerated and sustained Ameloblastin expression during the observation period ( Figure 5A ). Even at 150 h, the FGF-9 group exhibited significantly higher Ameloblastin expression. Combined with the comparatively lower impedance data of the FGF-9 group (Figure 4B ), the evidence suggests that addition of FGF-9 induces early Ameloblastin expression, some early phenotypic characteristics of ameloblasts existed within the epithelial layer and accelerated epithelial invagination.",

These two graphs show that the peak Ameloblastin expression at 60 h is followed by a peak Amelogenin expression at 72 h, in agreement with previous research [21] . Significantly higher Amelogenin expression also coincides with early lower impedance data ( Figure 4B ) and earlier differentiation of tooth germ evident in early organ culture (Additional file 2). These results indicate that FGF-9 can initiate early phenotypic and morphological characteristics of ameloblasts within the epithelium, which coincides with epithelial invagination evident from the ECIS assay ( Figure 4B ). After invagination, the FGF-9 group still exhibits higher Ameloblastin and Amelogenin expressions than the control group. Because of the clear differences, no mark is necessary to specify the results of the FGF-9 group. was very weak, it was higher in the FGF-9 group than in the control group, peaking at 72 h ( Figure 5B ) following peak Ameloblastin expression at 60 h ( Figure 5A ) [21, 22] .

These results provide solid evidence that FGF-9 accelerates epithelial invagination and early phenotypic and morphological characteristics of ameloblast existed within the epithelium.",

Thus, FGF-9 may drive early differentiation of the epithelial cell layer to express phenotypic and morphological characteristics of ameloblasts (Additional file 2 and 3), cause proliferation of the epithelium for invagination ( Figure 3B ) and promote ectodermal organogenesis.

FGF-10 is known to stimulate proliferation in epithelial cells [23] , potentially creating larger tooth germs. MTT data also suggested that FGF-9 can stimulate epithelial cell proliferation at 183 h ( Figure 3B ). Resent research indicates that a TGF\u03b2-FGF9-PITX2 signaling cascade regulates cranial neural crest cell proliferation in palatal mesenchyme during palate formation [24] . It seems FGF-9 can regulate the proliferation and integration within mesenchymal cells in a more specific route, which also control the interaction between ectodermal epithelium and mesenchyme. Previous research [5, 25] demonstrated using a bioengineered organ culture system similar to ours that epithelial invagination occurred after 1 week of in vitro culture: if dissociated epithelial cells recombined with intact dissected mesenchymal layers directly, new tooth germs formed faster than that with reaggregated mesenchymal cell layers [5, 25] . Our FGF-9 group exhibited faster mesenchymal cell integration in the first 3-4 days than previous studies ( Figure 4B ) [5, 6, 25] . These results suggest that FGF-9 functions in assisting mesenchymal cells to closely re-integrated, similar to a tissue layer. This might also explain how FGF-9 accelerates epithelial invagination in murine odontogenesis: by facilitating cross-talk and reunion between mesenchymal cells and stimulating epithelial cell layer differentiation, creating an ameloblast layer. Thus, FGF-9 may play a significant role in future stem cell organ regeneration.",

            "text": "Some authors have suggested that Wnt-7b restricts dental organ development to within the maxillary and mandibular arches [26] . Ectopic epithelial Wnt-7b expression, achieved through murine retrovirus infection, downregulates Shh expression within dental organs, completely abrogating their development; however, subsequent local Shh overexpression through beads revives tooth germ development [26] . This suggests that FGF-9 counterbalances Wnt-7b through the Shh pathway. Previous evidence [27] demonstrated that suppressing Shh created a similar phenotype to BMP4 overexpression in the feather model. We propose that FGF-9 plays a significant role in modulating the BMP-Shh 'signalling module' regulating skin appendage morphogenesis [27] [28] [29] by accelerating epithelial invagination. Our preliminary results show that FGF-9 upregulates Msx-1 expression within a mesenchymal cell culture (Additional file 1). Previous studies [30] showed that FGFs and BMP4 induced both Msx1-independent and -dependent signalling pathways in early odontogenesis. These results suggest that FGFs and BMPs might influence the same regulatory systems functioning in multiple developmental areas and time points. A significant, proximal-distal pattern exists within the lower jaw epithelium of the mouse embryo [13] : FGF-8 and FGF-9 are expressed in the lateral molar field whereas BMP4 is expressed over the medial incisor area. This specific pattern suggests that FGF-8 and FGF-9 correlate with multicuspid odontogenesis whereas BMP4 correlates with unicuspid odontogenesis. Recent research [31] showed that both BMPs and FGFs target the Notch signalling pathway through the Jagged 2 (Jag2) gene, regulating tooth morphogenesis and cytodifferentiation. However, Jag2 expression is downregulated by BMPs but upregulated by FGFs within the dental epithelium. This suggests a specific, counterbalanced relationship exists between FGFs and BMPs. If BMP overexpression suppresses Shh expression, then FGF overexpression may promote Shh expression, accelerating epithelial invagination. We propose an 'FGF-BMP balancing system' (Figure 6 ), [32] which determines the cusp number in odontogenesis and may similarly regulate feather or skin appendage morphogenesis. These topics are interesting issues for further discussion and require future research.",

No direct relationship between Sonic hedgehog (Shh), Jagged (Jag2) and Ameloblastin has been elucidated until now.
