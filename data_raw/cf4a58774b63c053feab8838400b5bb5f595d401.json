To characterize the Central European PEDV strains regarding their virulence in suckling piglets, and to assess the protective effect of maternally derived antibodies (MDA), four trial groups were randomly assigned, each consisting of two pregnant sows and their litter. To induce MDA in a subset of piglets, two sows received a cell culture-adapted PEDV strain, and another two sows were inoculated with field material from German PED outbreaks. Four sows stayed na\u00efve. Subsequently, all piglets were inoculated with the corresponding PEDV strains at an age of 3 to 6 days, and virus shedding, clinical signs and occurrence of specific antibodies were assessed. Piglets without MDA showed a morbidity of 100% and low lethality, while almost all MDA-positive piglets stayed clinically healthy and showed considerably lower virus shedding. Taken together, the Central European PEDV strains showed rather low virulence under experimental conditions, and pre-inoculation of sows led to a solid protection of their offspring. The latter is the prerequisite for a sow vaccination concept that could help to prevent PED induced losses in the piglet sector.",

In a nutshell, the PEDV strains obtained from recent German outbreaks (both cell culture and field material) showed indeed a low virulence with only two MDA-negative piglets that had to be euthanized at the humane endpoint. All remaining piglets recovered completely and were able to compensate the weight loss by the weaning age. However, piglets with MDA were almost completely protected from clinical disease. In direct comparison, the field material induced more severe signs in na\u00efve piglets than the cell culture isolate. Possible reasons include attenuation by cell culture adaptation but also differences in inoculation dose and secondary pathogens. Regarding the inoculation dose, it can be stated that the genome load was higher in the cell culture material than in the field material. Provided that this gives at least an indication for the virus titer, we can assume that the virus titer of the field material was at least not considerably higher than that of the cell culture material. Testing of the field materials for secondary pathogens showed low rotavirus A and enterovirus loads. The secondary materials used for the inoculation of the piglets in groups B1 and B2 contained PEDV and low PEV genome loads. The latter was however not found in any of the piglets.",

Disease progression in these sows was worse than the disease course in the sows following direct inoculation prior to farrowing (groups A1 and B1). Diarrhea and depression even led to a severe decrease of milk production and thus inadequate nutrition of piglets. This underlines the importance of the sow's health status for the fate of PED-diseased piglets. The increased severity could probably be explained by the more fragile immune system during the farrowing and lactating period, but also with the higher virus loads in the stable and ongoing contact to PEDV shed by the infected piglets 39 .",

This is prerequisite for a sow vaccination strategy which should be explored in light of the tremendous impact of PED in the US and also farms in the Ukraine. With neonatal piglets being born agammaglobulinemic and possessing limited, undeveloped lymphoid tissues and no effector and memory T-lymphocytes 41 , it is absolutely necessary that they receive maternal cell-mediated and humoral immune components through the ingestion of colostrum and milk 42 . It is already shown for TGEV that natural oral infection of sows leads to a more effective maternal derived lactogenic protection for suckling pigs than systemic immunization 43, 44 . This effect is mainly based on a larger amount of secretory IgA in colostrum and milk because of stimulation of the gut-mammary-axis of the sow. Systemic immunization usually induces high levels of IgG in both the blood and colostrum, but IgA titers in blood might stay on a low level offering no reliable lactogenic protection against infection of piglets 45 . This is in line with the results of the provided study, in which high amounts of IgG could be detected in colostrum but not in milk samples, whereas IgA could be found in both -colostrum of pre-infected sows and milk of all sows. Thus, also the sows that stayed na\u00efve prior to farrowing seroconverted upon challenge of their piglets and low levels of IgA could be detected in milk samples at the end of the trial. When revisiting PED vaccination, this route-dependent issue should be kept in mind as it could explain the unsatisfactory protection against virus shedding and morbidity of piglets from sows that were only parenterally immunized using different types of vaccines 46 .",

Sows pre-exposed prior to farrowing showed already decreasing levels of IgG at the end of the trial (with ELISA results still being positive). With a high antibody titer in the blood being a requirement for solid and protective antibody titers -especially secretory IgA -in colostrum and milk, it seems that sows would have to be re-vaccinated/re-infected prior to each farrowing to ensure piglet protection. Moreover, immunization is needed close to the farrowing date. From literature it is known that antibody levels of IgG and IgA in serum of primiparous and multiparous sows can remain stable up to 6 months post field infection as measured by high titers in ELISA and virus neutralization assay 49 . The respective sows were obtained from commercial breeding farms that had reported previous PED outbreaks. Thus, booster/reinfection seems to play a role for the duration of immunity. With regard to piglets, field studies observed antibody levels in piglets that lasted up to 100 days 49, 50 . For the piglets/young weaners, the source of antibodies clearly influences the duration of detection. While a decay of MDA is visible already after a few weeks, antibodies induced by active immunization or infection might last much longer. In our study, MDA-positive animals had only low antibody levels by the end of the trial (at the age of weaning). In these animals, protection in later stages of pig production would have been questionable and this could explain field observations that showed reinfection of finishing pigs that had been exposed to PEDV as suckling pigs. These aspects also need consideration when designing a vaccination concept.",

The multiparous sows were purchased in late pregnancy from a commercial breeding farm with a high veterinary hygiene standard (Bundes Hybrid Zucht Programm, BHZP, Dahlenburg-Ellringen, Germany). They were transported to the high containment facilities at the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institute Greifswald, Insel Riems, Germany, five weeks before farrowing. According to EU legislation, the animals were kept in open pens in sets of two before they were moved to commercial farrowing pens one week before farrowing. Two farrowing pens were integrated in one stable room so that each experimental group could be kept together. All animals had access to water ad libitum and were fed with commercial feed for breeding sows and after farrowing for lactating sows. All applicable animal welfare regulations, including EU-Directive 2010/63/EC and institutional guidelines, were taken into consideration. The animal experiment was approved by the competent authority, Landesamt f\u00fcr Landwirtschaft, Lebensmittelsicherheit und All animals were tested prior to arrival with negative PCR-results for PEDV and antibodies against PEDV. After arrival, the animals were randomly assigned to four treatment groups. Two sows (ear tags 1871 and 4249) were orally inoculated with cell culture adapted PEDV (PEDV EU) four weeks before farrowing to induce MDA-positive piglets (group A1). Another two sows (ear tags 4423 and 6150) were treated the same way orally with German field material (organ suspension and fecal homogenate; DE) containing PEDV to also obtain MDA-positive piglets (group B1). The remaining four sows stayed untreated to obtain MDA-negative piglets (group A2: ear tags 4343 and 4454; group B2: ear tags 1866 and 4365).",

The initial isolate was obtained using the following (standard) protocol: 5 \u00d7 10 5 Vero cells were seeded into 6-wells plates. After 24 h of incubation at 37\u00b0C, confluent monolayers were obtained and the cell culture medium was removed. All wells were washed three times with 3 ml phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).

After the addition of 2 ml of PEDV media containing 15 \u00b5g/ml trypsin, cultures were incubated for 24-48 h at 37\u00b0C. The cultures were checked daily for the presence of characteristic fusion formation, and positive materials were further passaged.
