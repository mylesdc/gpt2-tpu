Here, we investigated the viable bacterial population in air samples collected around the slaughterhouses used during the Hajj. Methods and results: We collected air samples on three days from four different sites: slaughterhouses at Al-Kakia, Al-Meaisim and Al-Sharaia, and from a waste disposal area designated for the remnants of slaughter. Samples were cultured on blood agar plates for 48 h, and bacterial isolates were identified using MALDI-TOF MS. A dendrogram using the spectra of the unidentified bacterial species was constructed, and PCR amplification and sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene was performed for one isolate per cluster. In total, 2500 colonies appeared on the nutrient agar plates, and 244 were purified for further analysis. Good identification was obtained for 202 (83%) isolates by MALDI-TOF MS. The most common genera were Bacillus (n = 94, 45%) and Staphyloccocus (n = 55, 26%). Poor identification was obtained for 42 (17%) isolates, and their spectra clustering revealed that these isolates belonged to 10 species. Four of these were considered to be new species. Conclusions: During the Hajj, the air was contaminated by many environmental bacterial agents, and MALDI-TOF MS was successfully adapted for their rapid identification.",

Every year, more than 2 million pilgrims from over 160 countries travel to Makkah to perform the Hajj [1] . The gathering of so many people for a short period of time presents many public health challenges. Crowding, fatigue and the extreme climate conditions are significant factors that promote the transmission of airborne infections. During the Hajj season, respiratory symptoms are very common among pilgrims [2] , and respiratory infections, led by pneumonia, are the most common cause of hospital admissions [3] . In one study, approximately 39% of all patients admitted for hospitalization had a respiratory infection [4] . Recently, an outbreak of respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infections was reported in Saudi Arabia. In addition, the bacterial agents most commonly responsible for pneumonia at the Hajj are Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumonia, Acinetobacter sp., Pseudomonas aeriginosa and Staphylococcus aureus [5, 6] . Many animals are sacrificed by pilgrims or, more commonly, by slaughterhouse workers on behalf of pilgrims as a part of the Hajj rituals. Previously, contaminated sheep waste that had been left uncovered around slaughterhouses was associated with outbreaks of airborne disease in France [7, 8] . Q fever outbreaks have also been associated with airborne transmission from contaminated wastes [7, 8] .",

The monitoring of current levels of outdoor airborne bacterial agents is necessary to evaluate the potential risks to human health. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization timeof-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) for the identification of bacterial isolates or biological samples is being used increasingly in microbiology laboratories [9] . MALDI-TOF MS has previously been used to determine the airborne bacterial community at a subway station in Norway [10] . Determining the overall bacterial diversity in outdoor atmospheres is essential to facilitate the rational development of public health policies. Special slaughterhouses and waste disposal areas have been constructed for this purpose in the Mina region near Makkah. Detection and measurement of airborne bacterial contaminants in these slaughterhouses and waste disposal areas is needed to assess contamination levels and to estimate the resulting exposure of occupants. The objective of this study was to investigate the viable bacterial population in air samples collected around slaughterhouses used during the Hajj season. To this end, we employed MALDI-TOF MS and PCR amplification and sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene [11] and we found that during the Hajj, the air was contaminated by many environmental bacterial agents and MALDI-TOF MS was successfully used for the identification of airborne bacterial contaminants.",

The dendrogram of spectra of the unidentified bacterial species is presented in Figure 1 . This dendrogram revealed that the spectra from unidentified bacteria belonged in 10 different clusters. We considered bacteria in each cluster to be representatives of the same species. As a result, 16S rRNA sequencing was performed for only 10 isolates (one isolate per cluster). These species were identified as Arthrobacter luteolus, Arthrobacter protophormiae, Bhargavaea cecembensis, Leucobacter alluvii, Microbacterium esteraromaticum and Planococcus citreus ( Table 2 ). In addition, we found that four isolates exhibited <98.7% nucleotide sequence similarity with Arthrobacter nitroguajacolicus, Jeotgalicoccus psychrophilus, Pseudomonas bauzanensis and Lysinibacillus sphaericus. This value was lower than the 98.7% threshold required to delineate a new species without carrying out DNA-DNA hybridization [12] .

Air samples collected during the Hajj season were contaminated by many environmental, but not pathogenic, bacterial species. A limitation of our study was that air samples were only tested for bacteria and not for the presence of airborne fungi, viruses, and toxins. In addition, the isolation was based on only one culture condition, a limitation that possibly decreased diversity of the isolates. Finally we did not calculate the number of isolates firstly appeared on the nutrient agars to determined which site was the most contaminated. In our laboratory, MALDI-TOF MS is routinely used to identify bacterial species and subspecies [13] . Our findings are reliable because in cases of a bad MALDI-TOF MS identification, amplification and sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene was performed. In our laboratory, we identify approximately 32,430 isolates by MALDI-TOF MS annually [13] . Moreover we previously used MALDI-TOF MS to directly identify 233 out of 349 bacterial species from 36,500 colonies cultured from 4 stool samples [11] . For the remaining 116 unidentified species of bacteria in the same study, 16S rRNA gene sequencing was necessary [11] . However, the construction of a dendrogram from spectra of unidentified bacteria decreased the need for 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Here, because we tested environmental isolates, the MALDI-TOF database did not contain their spectra, and only 83% of the airborne isolates were correctly identified. Moreover, the presence of a low number of spectra in the database for some species did not allow MALDI-TOF to identify bacteria in the groups with biodiversity within species. In contrast, in a previous study on patient samples, MALDI-TOF MS was much more effective and identified 95% of the bacterial isolates [14] .",

In a large survey conducted of 15 intensive care units during the Hajj in 2009 and 2010, Acinetobacter sp., Klebsiella sp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumonia were among the most common pathogens responsible for pneumonia [6] . Finally, during the 2005 Hajj season, the majority of pneumonia cases were caused by Candida albicans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, followed by L. pneumophila and K. pneumonia [21] . However, the results of this survey are questionable and may have been confounded by laboratory contamination. None of these agents were found in the air samples we tested. The absence of L. pneumophila, M. tuberculosis and H. influenzae can be explained by the fact that we used nutrient agar for the isolation of bacteria. However, the other bacterial species associated with pneumonia in pilgrims can be isolated on blood agar. Two surveys addressing microbiological contamination of air were conducted in the areas of Jeddah and Mecca. In the Jeddah survey, Aspergilus fumigates and Aspergilus niger were the most common fungal types isolated from air samples [22] . In the Makkah survey, airborne microbial contamination was collected from the holy mosque. Gram-positive bacteria constituted 90-100% of the total bacterial isolates. Staphylococcus sp. and Bacillus sp. were the dominant Gram-positive bacteria, which corroborates our results. Steptococci and Pseumomonas sp. were also isolated, with variations depending on the site of collection. A. fumiggatus, A. niger, A. flavus and Fusarium sp. were the most common fungal types isolated [23] .",

The bacterial spectra were automatically acquired using flexControl 3.0 software, and the analysis was carried out with Biotyper 2.0 software. As previous described, a species was considered to be correctly identified when at least one spectrum presented a score \u22651.9 [14, 24] . For isolates with a score <1.9, a dendrogram was made from their spectra by the MALDI Biotyper 3.0 software. Unidentified isolates that clustered together were categorized as belonging to the same bacterial species, and only one isolate per cluster was used for PCR amplification and sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. All of the bacterial spectra identified by 16S rRNA sequencing were added to the MALDI-TOF MS database, and we then performed a new scoring of the clustered species to verify that they were identical and to determine whether their matching score was \u22651.9. For isolates that did not cluster with other bacteria, PCR amplification and sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene was independently performed.",
