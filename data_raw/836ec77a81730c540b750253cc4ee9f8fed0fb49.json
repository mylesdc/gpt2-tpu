Various computational methods that have been developed based on the antigen structures and the mimotopes these years narrow the search for experimental validation. These methods can be divided into two categories: antigen structure-based methods and mimotopebased methods. Though new methods of the two kinds have been proposed in these years, they cannot maintain a high degree of satisfaction in various circumstances. In this paper, we proposed a new conformational B-cell epitope prediction method based on antigen preprocessing and mimotopes analysis. The method classifies the antigen surface residues into \"epitopes\" and \"nonepitopes\" by six epitope propensity scales, removing the \"nonepitopes\" and using the preprocessed antigen for epitope prediction based on mimotope sequences. The proposed method gives out the mean F score of 0.42 on the testing dataset. When compared with other publicly available servers by using the testing dataset, the new method yields better performance. The results demonstrate the proposed method is competent for the conformational B-cell epitope prediction.",

Since humoral responses are induced by epitopes on the surface of antigen, rather than the whole antigen, it is important to locate these epitopes on antigen for the purpose of effective vaccine design. The most reliable methods for identification of an epitope are X-ray crystallography and NMR techniques, but they are time consuming and expensive. Candidate epitopes that are selected by computational methods prior to laboratory experiments can lead to both significantly reducing the experimental cost and substantially accelerating the identifying process [1] .",

These patches are then transformed to a number of graphs using an adaptable distance threshold (ADT) regulated by compactness factor (CF), a novel parameter proposed in the method. Then on each single patch, a complete search is conducted to guarantee the best alignment for each mimotope sequence. Dynamic programming and branch-bound methods are also adopted to both avoid repetition in searching and further narrow the search space.",

The definitions of an epitope inferred from the 3D structure of Ag-Ab complex are mainly based on either ASA or the contact area between residues of antigen and antibody. In the first state, an epitope is defined as the surface residue of antigen with ASA decreased more than a given threshold upon binding with the antibody, and 1\u00c5 2 is frequently used. There are some tools to calculate ASA, and the usually used tool is NACCESS [15] or Surface Racer program [16] . In the second state, an epitope is defined as the residue of antigen which has a contact area above a given threshold upon interaction with the antibody, while the value 4\u00c5 is frequently used. Among these two ways of definition the second one is generally accepted and applied. Ponomarenko tested in his paper that choosing which way to define epitope may not influence the results [17] . In this paper we define epitopes by the first way. In addition, we consider an amino acid residue as a surface residue if the RSA (relative accessible surface area) of its side chain is greater than 5% with 1.4\u00c5 probe radius.",

To give a comparison with MimoPro, we also tested MimoPro and listed the performance measures together with the new method. As seen from Table 2 , the number of predicted epitope of this method was less than MimoPro for most cases, and it leads to the improvement of the specificity of the new method. The average specificity score on testing dataset has reached 81% which is higher than MimoPro. The average sensitivity score of this method decreased slightly, and the reason is that there is no validated feature or feature combination that can distinguish epitope residues from nonepitope residues completely so far. That is, the removed residues which we took as \"nonepitope\" residues in the step of antigen preprocessing may contain more or less true epitope residues. Taking vascular endothelial growth factor (PDB id: 1BJ1) as an example, the native epitope includes two consecutive segments (I80 M81 R82 I83 K84, and H86 Q87 G88 Q89 H90 I91 G92 E93 M94) and five isolated amino acids (F17 Y21 Y45 K48 Q79).

While predicted only by MimoPro, 32 candidate epitope residues (V33 D34 F36 Q37 E38 Y39 P40 D41 E42 I43 E44 Y45 I46 F47 K48 P49 S50 C51 M78 M81 R82 I83 K84 P85 Q87 G88 Q89 H90 G92 E93 M94 S95) were predicted which covers the residue R82. The new method predicted one less true epitope residue than MimoPro. Hence, the sensitivity of the new method is slightly lower than MimoPro. However, sensitivity and specificity are not complete for evaluating the performance of one method. The PPV have more predictive validity. As seen from Table 2 , the average PPV values of this method were higher than that of MimoPro, which not only illustrated that the overall performance of this method is superior to MimoPro but also indicated that the improvement of this study is effective.",

Localizing epitopes by experimental methods is expensive in terms of time, cost, and effort; therefore, computational methods feature for its low cost and high speed was employed to predict B-cell epitopes. In these years, lots of computational methods have been proposed for epitope prediction. These methods predict epitopes either by antigen structure or by mapping mimotopes to the original antigen surface. In this study, we proposed a new epitope prediction method based on antigen preprocessing by six epitope propensity scales and MimoPro searching. The performance of the method is superior to random prediction. Besides specificity, PPV measure improved a lot compared to MimoPro on the testing datasets. Compared with Pep-3D-Search, EpiSearch, and PepSurf, three other mimotope-based tools, testing results from the new method have shown that in most cases, it performed equal to or better than the what three methods did. On average from 18 test cases, performance of the new method indicated by sensitivity, PPV, and value is better than that of Pep-3D-Search, EpiSearch, and PepSurf in epitope prediction. This implies that the new method is a viable alternative to, if not the preferred choice, all of PepSurf, Pep-3D-Search, EpiSearch, and MimoPro for epitope prediction in the same kind.",

As seen from the results that for extremely difficult cases where amino acids forming the epitope include both consecutive segments and isolated amino acids, such as 3BT1 and 2HYM, the method failed in producing any useful mappings. This indicated where our method should be further improved although outcomes from PepSurf, EpiSearch, and Pep-3D-Search for the two test cases were not good either. Potentially this could be achieved through the following aspects in future. Firstly, selecting effective features or feature combination may potentially improve the performance of antigen processing. Secondly, to improve the performance of mapping mimotopes to the antigen surface, a more appropriate substitution matrix according to a specific application should be adopted so that graph rating is more meaningful to such application. In addition, intelligent searching algorithm could be modified so that the highly rated patches are searched first to make searching more efficient.",
