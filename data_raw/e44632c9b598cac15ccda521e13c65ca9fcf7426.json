            "text": "Responses by resident cells are likely to play a key role in determining the severity of respiratory disease. However, sampling of the airways poses a significant challenge, particularly in infants and children. Here, we report a reliable method for obtaining nasal epithelial cell RNA from infants for genome-wide transcriptomic analysis, and describe baseline expression characteristics in an asymptomatic cohort. Nasal epithelial cells were collected by brushing of the inferior turbinates, and gene expression was interrogated by RNA-seq analysis. Reliable recovery of RNA occurred in the absence of adverse events. We observed high expression of epithelial cell markers and similarity to the transcriptome for intrapulmonary airway epithelial cells. We identified genes displaying low and high expression variability, both inherently, and in response to environmental exposures. The greatest gene expression differences in this asymptomatic cohort were associated with the presence of known pathogenic viruses and/or bacteria. Robust bacteria-associated gene expression patterns were significantly associated with the presence of Moraxella. In summary, we have developed a reliable method for interrogating the infant airway transcriptome by sampling the nasal epithelium. Our data demonstrates both the fidelity and feasibility of our methodology, and describes normal gene expression and variation within a healthy infant cohort.",

As compared to the tremendous progress made over the last decades in our understanding of adult lung diseases such as COPD and lung fibrosis 1-3 , this limitation has restricted progress in identifying the molecular mechanisms contributing to pediatric respiratory diseases. Many contemporary studies sample the upper airway, using aspirates of tracheal secretions in intubated subjects to collect intra-airway inflammatory cells and sloughed resident cells of the airway. The availability of these samples is limited to intubated subjects, introducing significant selection bias. Furthermore, the ability of these samples to reliably capture the cellular and molecular state of the lung is unclear. Other studies have analyzed nasal washings, which can be performed in a more broad population. Again, these samples are of unclear relevance to the pathophysiology of the lung.",

We first interrogated the expression of cell type-specific marker gene expression in this data set, in order to assess the nature and composition of the samples (Fig. 3) . We noted high levels of expression (> 1,000 normalized counts) for transcripts for PLUNC, the definitive marker of nasal epithelial cells 6 . BPIFA1 (SPLUNC) and BPIFB1 (LPLUNC) were most highly expressed, as compared to their alternate isoforms. We also observed a high level of expression for other general epithelial cell markers, including CDH1 and EPCAM, and diverse expression of epithelial-specific mucins (MUC1/2/4/16/20). We noted expression of some non-epithelial genes, but at lower expression levels (< 100 normalized counts), so we thoroughly assessed the data set for evidence of non-resident cells. First, we assessed globin gene transcripts as a measure of red blood cells. The total burden of transcripts encoding any of the globin genes was < 0.01%, with 29 (55%) of the subjects having zero reads mapping to any globin gene. These data indicate that bleeding in general, or contamination of samples with blood-derived cells, was not confounding our gene expression assessments. We next assessed the expression of selected lymphocyte and other immune cell markers. Most of these genes (e.g., CD3/8/19, MPO) were expressed at low levels in most subjects. However, the expression of some (e.g., CD4) were reliably detected in many or most subjects, albeit at a relatively low level. Finally, we assessed the expression of a set of immune cell marker genes 7 . These data suggested the presence of a low level of immune cells, primarily granulocytes, mast cells and macrophages (Fig. 3) . However, it is clear that some subjects displayed higher levels of expression for leukocyte markers than others.",

We compared the HINT to the nasal transcriptome previously reported for non-asthmatic control teenage subjects 4 . There was a high degree of similarity between these two transcriptomes (Fig. 4A) , with the older subjects displaying more diversity than the infants.

Thus, we suggest that this approach is useful to estimate responses that occur in the lower airways of infants. Our data are consistent with a recent report of the nasal transcriptome in an older population 4 . A direct comparison of our HINT with gene expression from control subjects from that study demonstrated a high degree of similarity of the nasal transcriptome irrespective of age. It should be noted that this comparison of similarity does not take into account variation in expression levels across subjects and airway regions. Clearly, significant differences in gene expression exist between nasal and lower airway epithelial cells.

Genes with high variance (PROK2, IL1B, CXCR1) could implicate factors that may be associated with heterogeneity in resilience versus susceptibility to disease. Interestingly, many genes with inherently high variance were associated with immunity and infection responses, which may be associated with changes in cellular composition. Differences in expression variance were also identified in association with many demographic and host variables, particularly the presence of known respiratory pathogens in these asymptomatic infants. By comparison, most demographic variables were associated with modest differences in mean expression levels.

Shown are fold-change estimates based upon RNA-seq absolute expression estimates and qPCR relative expression estimates. Shown also are nonparametric p-values for tests of significant differences based upon qPCR data. Comparing gene expression changes in subjects with detectable virus or potentially pathogenic bacteria in the nares, we found greater effect sizes associated with the presence of rhinovirus or coronavirus when compared to any pathogen or bacterial pathogens alone. We suspected these data were likely due to greater variability in gene expression associated with distinct bacteria. Using 16S microbial sequencing of nasal samples from these subjects, we found a strong association between gene expression and the presence of pathogenic Moraxella genera, but not with non-pathogenic Moraxella or other pathogenic bacteria. Furthermore, multivariate analyses identified gene expression patterns significantly associated with the interaction of pathogen and gender.

            "text": "We recognize some limitations of the current study. Although we were able to recover RNA from a vast majority of the subjects using our detailed protocol (see Supplement), we saw significant variability in yield across subjects. Therefore, we chose to use a commercially available \"low input\" protocol for RNA sequencing, which enabled capture of data from all subjects. Although it is likely that this approach sacrifices sensitivity for detection of genes expressed at a low level, we did observe very high technical replicate correlation. We also noted sample-wide correlations which were consistent, but somewhat lower than expected (r = 0.730 \u00b1 0.148). We believe this reflects the heterogeneity of individual samples, which are likely representative of multiple (epithelial, as well as some non-epithelial) cell types. Unfortunately, in the current study, we were unable to use cytometry to directly assess the diversity of cells within individual subjects, or among subjects across the cohort. However, sample composition was partially assessed using cell-specific marker gene expression. High levels of nasal-specific and general epithelial cell marker expression were identified. These data also suggested a low level (but not absence) of immune/inflammatory cells, which may be greater without washing of the nares prior to cell recovery. In addition, the consistently absent or low detection of globin transcripts indicated no significant injury from the procedure as well as little or no red blood cell confounding of expression data. These results strongly suggest that this method predominantly assesses nasal epithelial cell gene expression. It is also worth noting that we found differences in sample recovery efficiency based upon the swab used for brushing the nasal turbinates. After some trial and error, and consideration of the relationship between aggressive cell recovery and injury to the subjects, we were successful in consistently recovering sufficient RNA for complete transcriptome analysis and expression validation. Alternate brush choices, allowing more aggressive brushing, may be better for older subjects. Finally, our recovery procedures were affected by apparent changes in buoyancy of cells stored in RNA stabilizer. In order to overcome some observed variability in centrifugation-based cell recovery of cells suspended in RNA stabilizer, we ensured 100% recovery by simple centrifugation through a membrane. To overcome potential technical impediments, we strongly recommend following the specific protocol provided, particularly the choice of swab.",

Conversely, the data indicate relatively low levels of expression for most leukocyte markers including lymphocyte genes (CD3/8/19/56), neutrophil genes (MPO) and generic hematopoietic genes (CD34).
