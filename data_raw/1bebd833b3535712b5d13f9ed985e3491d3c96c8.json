Since there is no dengue vaccine available for human use, we have set out to investigate the use of chloroquine as an antiviral drug against dengue. Chloroquine, an amine acidotropic drug known to affect intracellular exocytic pathways by increasing endosomal pH, was used in the in vitro treatment of Vero and C6/36 cells infected with dengue virus type 2 (DENV-2). Real-time RT-PCR and plaque assays were used to quantify the DENV-2 load in infected Vero and C6/36 cells after chloroquine treatment. Our results showed that a dose of 50 g/ml of chloroquine was not toxic to the cells and induced a statistically significant inhibition of virus production in infected Vero cells when compared to untreated cells. In C6/36 cells, chloroquine does not induce a statistically significant difference in viral replication when compared to untreated cells, showing that this virus uses an unlikely pathway of penetration in these cells, and results were also confirmed by the plaque assay (PFU). These data suggest that the inhibition of virus infection induced by chloroquine is due to interference with acidic vesicles in mammalian cells.",

            "text": "Dengue viruses (DENV) are single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses that belong to the genus Flavivirus of the family Flaviviridae. They consist of four serotypes (from DENV-1 to DENV-4) that are transmitted to humans and other higher primates by mosquitoes of the genus Aedes [1] . DENV cause the most important arthropod-borne viral disease in the world, characterized by a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations ranging from a flu-like disease (dengue fever) to a life-threatening disease known as dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS). The only available way to control dengue is vector control since there is neither a vaccine for human use nor an antiviral drug to inhibit virus replication. Little is known about the site of flavivirus assembly or the details of maturation, but a decrease in endosomal pH is necessary for flavivirus envelope fusion with endosomal membranes leading to release of the viral capsid into the cytosol and initiation of virus replication [2] . Weak bases such as chloroquine (CLQ) accumulate in acidic vesicles and raise the pH therein. By preventing the low pH-induced fusion of viral envelope and cell endosome membranes, CLQ is potentially able to block the entry of certain viruses into the cytosol [3] . The present study examined the effect of CLQ on the DENV-2 replication in Vero (mammalian) and C6/36 (mosquito) cells in order to define whether or not CLQ could be used to reduce viral yield.",

            "text": "We report here data showing that CLQ is an effective antiviral agent for DENV-2 under cell culture condition. The inhibitory effect was observed when the drug was added 1 h after the initiation of infection, probably due to the increase of the endosomes pH and thus subverting the ongoing fusion events between virus envelope and endosome membranes. These results suggest that CLQ could have a potential for therapeutic use against dengue virus and even against other viruses that penetrate cells by endocytosis. In that sense, some studies have shown that CLQ inhibits SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) replication in vitro [6, 7] . In addition, di Trani et al. [8] tested the antiviral effects of CLQ in vitro against selected human and avian viruses belonging to different subtypes and displaying different pH requirements. Those authors found that CLQ had inhibitory effect against the viruses when the drug had been added at the time of infection and the effect was lost after 2-hour postinfection. Finally, Eng et al. [9] reported that CLQ is able to inhibit influenza A virus replication in vitro. Hour postinfection Viral RNA copy number 1 +00 CLQ is a safe drug with over half a century of use in the treatment of malaria; therefore, the implementation of a protocol to use it in dengue treatment would not be a problem. Since there is a correlation between high viral load and development of DHF/DSS [10] , the use of CLQ to treat dengue virus infection as soon as the patients present the dengue symptoms could prevent the development of the severe forms of the disease due to the reduction of dengue viremia. Furthermore, due to its interference with TNF-cytotoxicity [11] , CLQ would probably reduce the inflammatory symptoms, such as high fever and backache, associated with dengue.",
