Disturbance of a balanced nasopharyngeal (NP) microbiome might be involved in the onset of symptomatic infections with these pathogens, which occurs primarily in fall and winter. It is unknown whether seasonal infection patterns are associated with concomitant changes in NP microbiota. As young children are generally prone to respiratory and invasive infections, we characterized the NP microbiota of 96 healthy children by barcoded pyrosequencing of the V5-V6 hypervariable region of the 16S-rRNA gene, and compared microbiota composition between children sampled in winter/fall with children sampled in spring. The approximately 1000000 sequences generated represented 13 taxonomic phyla and approximately 250 species-level phyla types (OTUs). The 5 most predominant phyla were Proteobacteria (64%), Firmicutes (21%), Bacteroidetes (11%), Actinobacteria (3%) and Fusobacteria (1,4%) with Moraxella, Haemophilus, Streptococcus, Flavobacteria, Dolosigranulum, Corynebacterium and Neisseria as predominant genera. The inter-individual variability was that high that on OTU level a core microbiome could not be defined. Microbiota profiles varied strongly with season, with in fall/winter a predominance of Proteobacteria (relative abundance (% of all sequences): 75% versus 51% in spring) and Fusobacteria (absolute abundance (% of children): 14% versus 2% in spring), and in spring a predominance of Bacteroidetes (relative abundance: 19% versus 3% in fall/winter, absolute abundance: 91% versus 54% in fall/winter), and Firmicutes. The latter increase is mainly due to (Brevi)bacillus and Lactobacillus species (absolute abundance: 96% versus 10% in fall/winter) which are like Bacteroidetes species generally related to healthy ecosystems. The observed seasonal effects could not be attributed to recent antibiotics or viral co-infection. The NP microbiota of young children is highly diverse and appears different between seasons. These differences seem independent of antibiotic use or viral co-infection.",

            "text": "According to the WHO, respiratory tract infections are still among the leading causes of death in children and adults worldwide [1] . The most common pathogens like Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis and Staphylococcus aureus are normal and transient residents of the nasopharyngeal (NP) niche, where they are embedded in a complex microbiota of generally presumed harmless commensals. The human microbiome in general is assumed beneficial to the host due to stimulation and maturation of immune systems, promotion of mucosal structure and function and providing actual 'colonization resistance' against pathogen invasion [2] . Although colonization by the ''potential pathogens'' of the NP microbiome is mainly asymptomatic, progression towards upper respiratory tract infections, pneumonia or even sepsis and meningitis may occur [3, 4] . The exact mechanisms by which this occurs remain largely unknown, although an imbalance in the composition of microbiota, for example by acquisition of new pathogens, viral coinfection or other host or environmental factors have been suggested [5] [6] [7] [8] . In addition, clear correlations between invasive attack rates and season are observed for many of the potential pathogens of the upper respiratory tract [9, 10] , a phenomenon that cannot be fully explained by concomitant changes in colonization rates of the individual pathogenic bacteria [11, 12] . This suggests that local containment of the colonizing pathogenic bacteria by the host and/or the surrounding ecosystem is of major importance in prevention of disease progression. Despite an abundance of data on incidence, prevalence and density of potential pathogens in NP microbiota of children and adults, the detailed composition of the NP microbial community, both during health and disease have not been studied. We, therefore, performed a meta-genomic study on the detailed composition of and variability in NP microbiota in young children sampled during different seasons.",

            "text": "We studied the NP microbiota composition of 96 healthy 18months old children. Their characteristics are depicted in Table  S1 . Being aware of the current discussions on the artefacts that may be introduced by pyrosequencing [13, 14] , we applied a stringent protocol for filtering and clustering of sequences. The approx. 1 100 000 generated sequences (on average 11000 sequences per sample) yielded about 92 000 unique sequences, representing 13 taxonomic phyla and 243 species-level phyla types (OTUs). The data were normalized for equal numbers of reads per sample. The 5 most predominant phyla were Proteobacteria (64%), Firmicutes (21%), Bacteroidetes (11%), Actinobacteria (3%) and Fusobacteria (1.4%) ( Figure 1 ). In addition, we found representatives of Cyanobacteria, probably reflecting plant chloroplasts obtained through inhalation. Sporadically and/or in low abundance we found sequences for the candidate divisions OD1, TM7 and BRC1 and the phyla Deinococcus-Thermus, Nitrospira, Planctomycetes and Chloroflexi. On a lower taxonomic level, the most prevalent genera were Moraxella (40%), Haemophilus (20%), Streptococcus (12%), and Flavobacterium (10%). Other fairly common genera were Dolosigranulum (5%), Corynebacterium (2%), Neisseria (2%) and Fusobacterium (1%). The 30 most common OTUs representing almost 98% of all reads, and their relative and absolute presence are shown in Table 1 (For the complete list of OTUs; see Table S2 ). Although the top 6 predominant phyla are identical to those of neighbouring microbiota, the composition, i.e. relative contribution of each phyla to those microbiota seems fairly different. In the oral cavity, microbiota are dominated by Firmicutes followed by Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes (overall 50% Gram-positive bacteria), whereas the microbiome of the nostril contains more than 80% gram-positive bacteria, mostly Actinobacteria and Firmicutes [15] . These data, therefore, suggest different dynamics (i.e., different biological equilibria) in the NP microbiome.",

When distinguished by the time of sampling (fall/winter versus spring) groups of children did not differ significantly in demographics or life style characteristics, infectious symptoms, medical history or environmental parameters (Table S1 ), reducing the likelihood of internal confounders as a cause of potential seasonal correlations with microbiota profiles. However, with respect to microbiota profiles, we observed marked differences between samples obtained in fall/winter versus samples from spring ( Table 2 ). In samples obtained in late fall and winter, we observed a predominance of Proteobacteria (relative abundance (% of all sequences): 75% versus 51% in spring), Fusobacteria (absolute abundance (% of children): 14% versus 2% in spring), and Cyanobacteria (absolute abundance: 64% versus 30% in spring; relative abundance: 0.27% versus 0.09% in spring) were significantly more abundant compared to spring, whereas Bacteroidetes were more frequently present in samples obtained in spring (relative abundance: 19% versus 3% in fall/winter, absolute abundance: 91% versus 54% in fall/winter) (Figure 3a ). On OTU level we observed amongst others more Bacillus, Brevibacillus and Lactobacillus species, and Flavobacterium and B. fragilis (both Bacteroidetes) in samples from spring compared to fall/winter. In addition we found less a-Proteobacteria, Oxalobacteriaceae, Microbacteriaceae, Ralstonia, Pseudomonas and Acidovorax (all Proteobacteria), Cyanobacteria, and Porphyromonas catoniae (Bacteroidetes) in samples from spring compared to fall/ winter ( Figure 3b ). When re-evaluating the core microbiome per individual season (i.e. OTUs present in more than 50% of samples of a certain season), we observed an additional core of Proprionibacterium and Cyanobacteria for fall/winter and an additional core of Flavobacteria, Brevibacillus and Bacillus (almost exclusively) for spring. The latter groups of bacteria, i.e. Bacteroidetes and (Brevi)bacillus and Lactobacillus species, are generally related to protection against overgrowth of pathogenic species due to the production of bacteriocins and other inhibitory substances [7, 16] . In other microbiota like the gastrointestinal and vaginal tract they are highly related to maintenance of a balanced microbiome as well [17] [18] [19] . Since infections with respiratory pathogens, especially pneumonia, are strongly related to fall and winter season [9, 10] , the presence and abundance of these bacteria in respiratory microbiota in spring might therefore suggest in general a more balanced respiratory microbiome in this specific season as well protecting against onset of respiratory or invasive infections.",

We found no evidence for associations between the observed seasonal shift in microbiota and the overall presence of respiratory viruses, nor for any of the individual viruses when tested by SAM analysis (Figure 3b ). Although these data do not exclude an effect of respiratory viruses on microbiota composition, they do suggest other season-related factors like environmental factors (temperature, humidity, smoke exposure, crowding), or nutrient-or vitamine-related effects, or a combina-tion of factors might be important for the observed shifts in microbiota profiles [3, 16, 20] . Interestingly, day-care attendance or smoke exposure could not be related to the observed shifts in microbiota, although the latter was encountered very rarely. This further underlines that different or more complex effect may be responsible for the observed phenomenon. In addition, no association was observed between seasonal changes in microbiota and recent antibiotic use, which was rather limited in this population (Table 1, Figure 3b ). Because of the explicit correlation between season and microbiota profiles, correlations between other environmental determinants and microbiota could not be accurately tested, which underlines that in future studies one needs to control and power for seasonal effects.",

On average, 76% of the overall NP microbiome in children was composed of Gramnegative bacteria, however with a wide range of 9-99% Gramnegative bacteria per sample. In addition, there was a higher contribution of Gram-negative bacteria to microbiota obtained in fall/winter (81%) compared to spring (72%) (Independent samples t-test: p = 0.044).

In line with other human body habitats, we found a complex, diverse and highly variable microbiota with a relatively limited core microbiome. There is considerable seasonal variation in NP microbiota. This implies the time of sampling should be considered when describing or comparing NP microbiomes, and preferably controlled for when other potential determinants like the impact of viruses or antibiotics on microbiota profiles or the correlation between microbiota profiles and diseases will be tested. Whether these seasonal changes in composition of the NP microbome are causally related to seasonal occurrence of respiratory tract infections remains to be determined, though seems relevant for further understanding of pathogenesis of infectious diseases and in the long run potentially for understanding of effects of current and design of future preventive measures.",

We then used the GAST algorithm [24] to calculate the percent difference between each unique sequence and its closest match in a database of 69816 unique Eubacterial and 2779 unique Archaeal V5-V6 sequences, representing 323499 SSU rRNA sequences from the SILVA database [25] .

The PCR mixture consisted of 15 ml of 2x master mix (Universal Mastermix,catalogue GMO-UN-A100, Europe Diagenode sa, Li\u00e8ge, Belgium), 1 ml of each primer (10 mM), 1 ml of the probe (5 mM), 9.5 ml DNA free water and 2.5 ml of template DNA. Amplifications were performed using a 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, catalogue 4351107, Foster City, CA 94404 USA) under the following conditions: 2 min at 50uC and 10 min at 95uC, followed by 45 cycles of 15 s at 95uC and 1 min at 60uC. Amplicon libraries To generate the PCR amplicon libraries, the small subunit ribosomal RNA gene V5-V6 hypervariable region was amplified for each individual sample independently. Of the 150 samples tested, 96 samples contained more than 1,3*10 ' 3 fg/ml DNA and were included in sequence analysis. PCR was performed using the forward primer 785F (59-GGA TTA GAT ACC CBR GTA GTC-39) and the reverse primer 1061R (59-TCA CGR CAC GAG CTG ACG AC-39). The primers were fitted with the 454 Life Sciences Adapter A (forward primer) and B (reverse primer), fused to the 59 end of the 16S rDNA bacterial primer sequences. The reverse primer also included a unique tetranucleotide sample identification key. The amplification mix contained 2 units of Pfu Ultra II Fusion HS DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA) and 1x PfuUltra II reaction buffer (Stratagene), 200 mM dNTP PurePeak DNA polymerase Mix(Pierce Nucleic Acid Technologies, catalogue NU606001 Milwaukee, WI, USA), and 0.2 mM of each primer. After denaturation (94uC; 2 min), 30 cycles were performed that consisted of denaturation (94uC; 30 sec), annealing (50uC; 40 sec), and extension (72uC; 80 sec). DNA was isolated by means of the MinElute kit (Qiagen, catalogue 28006, Hilden, Germany). The quality and the size of the amplicons were analyzed on the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyser with the DNA 1000 Chip kit (Agilent Technologies, catalogue 5067-1504, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and quantified using Nanodrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer. The amplicons of the individual samples were pooled in equimolar amounts in four libraries. The four libraries were sequenced unidirectionally in the reverse direction (B-adaptor) during two 454 Genome Sequencer FLX (GS-FLX, 454 Life Sciences (Roche), Branford, CT 06405 USA) runs.
