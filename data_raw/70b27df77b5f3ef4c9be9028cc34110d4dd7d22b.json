We recently demonstrated human exposure to PRV in Singapore, which together with previous reports from Malaysia and Vietnam suggest that human infection of PRV may occur periodically in the region. This raises the question whether bats are the only sources of human infection. In this study, we screened 517 cynomolgus macaques caught in Singapore for evidence of exposure to PRV3M (also known as Melaka virus), which was first isolated from human patients in Melaka, Malaysia. We found that 67 serum samples were PRV3M positive by ELISA and 34 were also positive by virus neutralization assay. To investigate whether monkeys could act as hosts for PRV transmission, we experimentally infected cynomolgus macaques with PRV3M and housed these animals with uninfected monkeys. Although no clinical signs of infection were observed in infected animals, viral RNA was detected in nasal and rectal swabs and all infected macaques seroconverted. Additionally, one of the uninfected animals seroconverted, implying active shedding and transmission of PRV3M. We provide evidence that PRV exposure in the macaque population in Singapore occurs at a relatively high prevalence and this study suggests that cynomolgus macaques may be an intermediate or reservoir host for PRVs.",

Evidence of PRV infection in humans has been reported in various locations in Southeast Asia (Figure 1 ). In a molecular surveillance study in Rembau, Malaysia, PRV was detected in oropharyngeal swabs from 17% of outpatients suffering from acute respiratory tract infections [7] and in serological studies on select populations, PRV seroprevalence rates range from 4.4-13% [7] [8] [9] . Although direct bat-to-human transmission was likely the route of transmission in the PRV3M outbreak [3] , it is less clear whether bats played a direct role in transmitting the viruses to humans in the other reported cases of human infection. The high prevalence in selected populations from the recent surveillance studies supports the possibility of transmission by reservoir or intermediate hosts, which may have closer contact with humans than bats.",

It is well known that interspecies transmission of bat-borne viruses is a source of disease outbreaks in the human population and indeed evidence of bat-to- human transmission of PRV has been demonstrated [3, 13] . In contrast to all previous discoveries, nonhuman primates were the source of the most recent PRV detection. Given the cross-species transmission of PRVs and frequent human-monkey interaction in Singapore and surrounding regions, we initiated this study to determine the seroprevalence of PRV3M in wild cynomolgus macaques and to examine the susceptibility of cynomolgus macaques to experimental infection with PRV3M and their potential role in acting as hosts facilitating cross-species transmission. Non-human primates may serve as natural reservoirs and maintain PRV, or act as intermediate hosts to provide a link for virus transmission between bats and humans.",

To further confirm the positivity of the samples and increase specificity, a serum neutralization test against PRV3M was performed on all ELISA positive serum samples. A total of 34 serum samples were able to neutralize PRV3M at a dilution of at least 1:10 (Table 1) . To further confirm the specificity, Western blot analysis was conducted using purified virions. Shown in Figure 2 (b) is a representative Western blot conducted with sample #6301, a known positive sample with a high neutralizing antibody titre, and a negative control sample, both used at dilution of 1:500.

Infected animals did not experience a significant temperature rise, although the body temperature of the infected group of animals was slightly higher overall than the contact group for the duration of the study (Figure 3(a) ). No significant weight loss occurred in either group, but there was a fluctuation in the infected group between days 5-9 post-infection ( Figure  3(b) ). Chest X-rays were normal in all animals when visualized on days -2, 7 and 21 post-infection ( Figure  3(c) ). No additional clinical signs such as rash, loss of appetite, diarrhoea, dehydration, depression or inactivity were observed throughout the experimental period.

It is important to note that, almost in all of the cases, an intermediate host has been identified to play a crucial role in amplifying and transmitting the virus from bats to humans such as horses for Hendra virus, pigs for Nipah virus and palm civets for SARS-CoV [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] . With multiple reports of PRV presence in bats in many parts of Asia [2, 12, [14] [15] [16] [17] and a higher than expected prevalence in certain human populations [7] [8] [9] , we raised the hypothesis that it is possible that a yet-to-be-identified intermediate host(s) may also play a role in the spillover of PRVs from bats to humans.

This was in contrast to experimental infection studies in mice, where 100% of infected animals exhibit disease signs and eventually succumb to the infection [5, 33] . It is possible that certain risk factors absent in healthy individuals pre-dispose the development of clinical signs in monkeys and humans upon PRV exposure, and further epidemiological studies in patient cohorts would help clarify this.",

Furthermore, as the immunobiology of humans is more closely related to monkeys than bats, host-adaptation within monkeys could serve to enhance the virulence or transmission efficiency of PRV in humans. Given the overlapping habitats of bats and monkeys, interspecies transmission to monkeys and subsequent pathogen adaptation could be a relevant theme in the broader context of bat-borne virus spillover to humans, and warrants further investigation. Finally, the recent report by a group in Thailand on the isolation and characterization of a PRV from monkey faecal samples ruled out contamination of these samples with bat faeces. During analysis of the mitochondrial 12S rRNA gene, bat DNA was not detected in the faecal samples, emphasizing monkeys, especially a long-tailed macaque, as potential reservoirs of zoonotic viruses, such as PRV [18] . We believe that the data obtained from our current study supports the notion that the Thai study represents a first isolation of a PRV replicating in monkeys in this region. While the current data presented in this study and from previous publications are not sufficient to determine whether non-human primates may act as a reservoir or intermediate host for PRVs, it is important to bear in mind that PRVs have been detected in a wide geographic area and the first PRV was isolated from bats in Australia where non-human primates do not exist.",
