At metropolitan scales, however, mobility patterns are fundamentally different and less directly observable. Estimating the spatial distribution of infection has public health utility, but few studies have investigated this at an urban scale. In this study we address the question of whether the use of urban-scale mobility data can improve the prediction of spatial patterns of influenza infection. We compare the use of different sources of urban-scale mobility data, and investigate the impact of other factors relevant to modelling mobility, including mixing within and between regions, and the influence of hub and spoke commuting patterns. Methods: We used journey-to-work (JTW) data from the Australian 2011 Census, and GPS journey data from the Sygic GPS Navigation & Maps mobile app, to characterise population mixing patterns in a spatially-explicit SEIR (susceptible, exposed, infectious, recovered) meta-population model. Results: Using the JTW data to train the model leads to an increase in the proportion of infections that arise in central Melbourne, which is indicative of the city's spoke-and-hub road and public transport networks, and of the commuting patterns reflected in these data. Using the GPS data increased the infections in central Melbourne to a lesser extent than the JTW data, and produced a greater heterogeneity in the middle and outer regions. Despite the limitations of both mobility data sets, the model reproduced some of the characteristics observed in the spatial distribution of reported influenza cases. Conclusions: Urban mobility data sets can be used to support models that capture spatial heterogeneity in the transmission of infectious diseases at a metropolitan scale. These data should be adjusted to account for relevant urban features, such as highly-connected hubs where the resident population is likely to experience a much lower force of infection that the transient population. In contrast to national and international scales, the relationship between mobility and infection at an urban level is much less apparent, and requires a richer characterisation of population mobility and contact.",

Increasingly, mechanistic models of disease transmission seek to incorporate this spatial dimension [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . The spatial distribution of a population is a key determinant of transmission, typically characteristics of disease outbreaks. The spatial heterogenity of populations, however, contributes to the dynamics of spread, and the availability of spatially-indexed mobility and disease data is increasing. Models that incorporate space may therefore provide better explanations for observed epidemiology and more accurate predictions of future outbreaks. Similarly, control interventions may be spatial in nature; for example, the imposition of quarantine zones, or culling of livestock around infected farms [17, 18] . Predictive models that incorporate a spatial dimension are thus important to identify geographic subpopulations at particular risk, and hence to more effectively target preventative measures or allocate public health resources [19] .",

Determining which types of mobility behaviour are most relevant to disease transmission depends on the geographic scale of interest. Many modelling studies have been concerned with predicting the spread of an infectious disease at a national or international scale. Examples of this include evaluating the effectiveness of various strategies for containing outbreaks of pandemic influenza [2, 20] and Ebola [5] . Of particular interest are the patterns of international movement that can rapidly increase the scale and human cost of disease outbreaks that would once have remained more geographically constrained. Other studies have considered transmission patterns at an urban scale. Again, a key aim is to evaluate the likely effectiveness of spatially defined control measures such as school closures [21] . In the case of dengue, urban-scale spatial models have been used to help explain observed epidemiological patterns, untangling the respective roles of human and vector movement [10, 22] . At a smaller scale still, some studies have focused on disease transmission that may occur within individual buildings such as schools and hospitals [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] .",

We examine how the introduction of spatial structure and heterogeneous mixing into a meta-population model of influenza transmission affects the spatial distribution of cases. In this study, we address a particular gap in our understanding: how does the nature of the mobility data, and the spatial scale at which they capture mobility, influence the veracity of the contact model? We therefore explore the impact of different sources of mobility data, and different models of how this mobility translates into patterns of contact. We evaluate how these patterns of contact and infection relate to reported influenza incidence in the city of Melbourne, Australian, given the limitations of these mobility and disease data sets. Finally we discuss how spatial heterogenity in disease risk and reporting may be accounted for in terms of underlying factors, and the implications for improved outbreak forecasting and public health response in the future.",

This suggests that SA4 regions are not a suitable higher-level spatial aggregation of metropolitan Melbourne for characterising patterns of urban mobility and their consequences for influenza infection. Instead, the boundary between inner SA4s (206-208) and peripheral outer SA4s (209-213) should be pushed outwards, while retaining the radial division of the outer SA4s. In comparison to the model results, the distribution of influenza cases exhibits less clustering of SA3s where disease activity is consistently increased or decreased. The blue SA3s (decreased activity) and green SA3s (increased activity) are scattered amongst each other to a greater degree than observed for the model simulations. Figure 7 shows the spatial variation of the differences between the spatially-uniform scenario and the median annual proportion of notified cases (over the 2010-16 seasons) in each SA3. These variations share a number of similarities with the spatial distributions of infection that are produced by the simulation model for each of the OD data sets (shown in Fig. 5 ): There are also clear differences between the median distribution of influenza cases and the model outputs: The smallest differences between the distribution of influenza cases and the distribution of model infections, for both the JTW data and the GPS data, are shown in Fig. 8 . Here we can see a trend in overprediction of incidence in the west, north-west, and mid-east, and an under-prediction of incidence in the inner east, inner south-east, outer north-east, and outer south-east. Results are shown relative to the spatially-uniform scenario. The GPS data and private journeys to work data exhibit similar trends, where increases in disease occur along a north-west to south-east axis, extending beyond the inner-most SA4 regions, and moderate to large decreases in disease in the outer-most regions and inner north-east. The public journeys to work data exhibit a greater concentration of disease in and around the CBD, and also in the inner-east, but without increases in the north-west or south-east",

These are also the most densely-populated regions in metropolitan Melbourne (3,000-5,000 persons per km 2 ). In most of the outer regions, where the population densities are lowest, there was a decreased proportion of infections. Yet, heterogeneous mixing also predicted lower proportion of infections occurring in some of the Inner South (208) and inner regions of the North East (209) and North West (210), where population densities are high.

In comparison to the model predictions shown in Fig. 5 , a greater proportion of cases are observed in the outer east, and there is less clustering of increased cases in and around the CBD unsuitable indicator of the spatial heterogeneity of disease, it is worth noting that (a) other SA3s in Inner Melbourne (206) are not under-represented in these data; and (b) the only mixing matrices able to reproduce this pattern were derived from the GPS data and used small values of \u03b4 C . The spatially-explicit SEIR model was able to reproduce some of the features of the case notifications data, particularly in Inner Melbourne (206), the inner west, and many of the outer regions. But there were also clear differences between the model output and the case notifications data in the outer north-east, outer south-east, and Inner South (208). If these urban mobility data sets accurately characterised population mixing as it pertains to human-to-human infection, then these differences would be indicative of the ascertainment biases in the case notifications data. But given the richness of population mobility and contact patterns [33, 44] and the limitations of the mobility data sets available (e.g., in terms of the population sample, the limited capture of transport by transport modalities other than personal vehicles, lack of knowledge regarding lengths of stay), this cannot be claimed. Further untangling this relationship between observed mobility and notified disease cases requires a richer characterisation of mobility and interaction in the urban environment, and having a better understanding of \"the processes that determine how persons are identified by surveillance systems\" [39] , such as access to healthcare.",

At large scales, the analyses are less nuanced and hence the bias in the mobility data may be of less importance. Conversely, at very fine scales, rich data at individual levels can be captured. Second, comparatively few studies have combined detailed mobility data with spatially-indexed disease data in order to investigate the spatial risk profile of infection; we are not aware of any studies that have done so at an urban scale. Existing studies have primarily focused on using high-resolution mobility data and individual-based models to estimate or fit the basic reproduction number [10, 21, 50, 51] , or have used spatially-indexed disease data to infer \"effective\" contact patterns [52] (i.e., combining contact and case ascertainment).",

Therefore, if a higher level of spatial aggregation than SA3s were desired, the use SA4s as the unit of aggregation would not be appropriate. A better fitting spatial aggregation would retain the radial division of SA4s, but would push the boundary that separates the inner SA4s (206-208) from the outer SA4s (209-213) outwards. This unsuitability is not surprising, as SA4s are designed to reflect labour Fig. 9 The relative risks of model infection and influenza case notifications, with respect to the spatially-uniform model. Model risks (coloured points) are compared to the influenza case notification risks (black crosses depict median risk, vertical black lines depict interquartile range), for \u03b4 C = 0.2. The GPS data is the only data set for which we observe a decreased risk of infection in the CBD. Both the GPS data and journeys to work data are capable of yielding relative risks that are similar to those of the influenza case notifications in many SA3s. For 10 of the 38 SA3s, neither data set provides a good match (as identified in Fig. 8) markets rather than the spread of infection, and therefore focus on the employed workforce. This highlights differences in mobility between urban sub-populations. Consequently, appropriate spatial aggregations are not necessarily well-aligned across different sub-populations and scales.",

At urban and smaller spatial scales, the stochastic nature of the infection events can dominate the outbreak dynamics and the average mobility patterns of the population may not be strongly reflected in the time-series data for any single outbreak [27] . The mobility patterns at an urban scale are also fundamentally different to those at other scales [53] : they include a mixture of routine journeys (e.g., journey to work or school), work related and logistic journeys, and irregular social trips (e.g., ad-hoc social activities, emergencies). The duration of stay at the journey destination(s) can also vary from minutes to days, and this has different consequences for the risk of infection than in national and international travel, where the minimum duration of stay is likely to be on the order of hours or days. Finally and most importantly these journeys are much less readily observable than major highway traffic, airline travel trips, and individual movement in enclosed environments such as schools, shopping malls, and military bases, in particular due to privacy concerns associated with extensive and spatially resolved population tracking [54] .",

Such an analysis was not feasible in this study because (a) the journey to work data only characterise the trip to work (and do not include journey times); and (b) the GPS data do not include a sufficient sample size at smaller temporal scales, and so we would expect the data to be substantially affected by sampling bias.",

Fine-scale and detailed data have only small coverage, and are compiled by time-and resource-intensive methods, such as computer assisted telephone interviews [33] and contact diaries [44, 55] . Two of these studies [33, 44] were conducted in the Boroondara and Hume local government areas in Melbourne, which approximately correspond to (a) Boroondara (Inner East 1); and (b) Sunbury (North West 4) and Tullamarine -Broadmeadows (North West 5) in our study. These detailed studies provide a much richer depiction of individual mobility and social encounter behaviour, capturing heterogeneity by age, gender, type of location and geographic area. In contrast, the JTW and GPS data used in the study reported here comprise substantially larger population samples with a greater geographic coverage, but cannot capture the diversity of mobility and contact experience.",

We investigated how two different data sets characterise urban mobility in metropolitan Melbourne, Australia, and the implications mobility has on the spread of infection across the urban system. We have in particular demonstrated how to account for features such as highly-connected regions (hubs) where the resident population is likely to experience a much lower force of infection than the transient population. We have further shown that population mixing models informed by mobility data sets yield spatial distributions of infection that reproduced some of the spatial features of influenza case notifications, despite the inherent limitation of these mobility data and the influenza cases data. A more robust treatment of urban mobility and contact in the context of infectious diseases requires (a) a richer characterisation of population mobility and contact, which are typically only obtainable through intensive small-scale studies; and (b) deeper knowledge of spatial ascertainment biases in the disease surveillance data. The pervasiveness of mobile phone ownership means that mobile phone data could provide a sufficiently-detailed picture of mobility and contact across most demographics. Until available, the relationship between reported disease cases and the population experience of infection remains a fundamental challenge for infectious diseases epidemiology, which new and emerging data sources may help to address [59] [60] [61] .

In contrast, for the private journeys to work data (bottom-left) when \u03b4 h i = 0.1, an extra 1.5-2% of all infections occurred in each of those SA3s. And for the public journeys to work data (bottom-right) when \u03b4 h i = 0.1, these same SA3s experienced an even greater proportion of all infections The distribution of influenza cases over metropolitan Melbourne for the 2010-16 influenza seasons is shown in Fig. 6. With the exception of the CBD (20604), the case distribution in Inner Melbourne (206) aligns well with the population distribution. A similar pattern is evident in the Inner East (207), where only Boroondara (20701) has an increased proportion of cases. Most of the Inner South (208) also have an increased proportion of cases, while the North East (209) has increases in Banyule (20901) and Nillumbik -Kinglake (20903) and a decrease in Whittlesea -Wallan (20904). The North West (210) has a near-uniform distribution of cases, and most of the Outer East (211) have a small decrease.
