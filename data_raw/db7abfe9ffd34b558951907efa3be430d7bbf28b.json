            "text": "To determine the incidence of anogenital warts (AGWs) in the Chinese general population, we compared the data from a prospective study and from the National Notifiable Disease Report System (NNDRS). A cohort study including 2378 women and 2309 men aged 18-55 years old enrolled from Liuzhou, China, was conducted with three scheduled visits at 6-month intervals from May 2014 to March 2016. And, a questionnaire survey was performed to collect the diagnosis history of AGWs at the enrollment visit. The data on reported AGW cases of Liuzhou in the NNDRS from 2006 to 2015 were also analyzed. Overall, the incidence rates of AGWs in the prospective study, in the self-reported diagnosis during past 12 months and in the NNDRS were 1.26 per 1000 person-years (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.16-2.37), 2.35 (95% CI: 1.17-4.20) and 0.183 (95% CI: 0.178-0.187), respectively. Human papillomavirus 6 or 11 were found in all the AGW biopsy samples (10/10). The onset time of AGWs in women was earlier, and the cumulative risk increased more quickly at a young age along with each subsequent younger birth cohort (Po0.0001), whereas slight differences were observed in the different male birth cohorts (P = 0.0785). The sexual behavior of individuals and their sexual partners had a strong relationship with self-reported AGWs. Our study indicates that the incidence of AGWs in China is as high as that in developed countries, and the data based on the national surveillance system seriously underestimate the real disease burden of AGWs.",

            "text": "Anogenital warts (AGWs), also called genital warts or condyloma acuminata, is a common sexually transmitted disease (STD) in both men and women. 1 Patients with AGWs suffer both physical (burning, bleeding, itching and pain) and psychosocial stress (anxiety, decreased self-esteem, and negative emotional and sexual impact). [2] [3] [4] The recurrence of AGWs is common, with the rate ranging from 6% to 77%, which has further increased the economic burden of medical health care and the psychosocial impact on patients. 5, 6 Previously, it was thought that AGWs were benign and not life threatening; however, recently, a Danish study indicated that individuals with AGWs had a long-term increased risk of anogenital cancers and head and neck cancers, which may due to coinfection with oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV), having high-risk behavioral factors (e.g., a higher number of partners, or a higher consumption of alcohol or smoking) or the poor immunity of the patients. 7 The incidence rates of AGWs among the general population worldwide are 1.6-2.8 per 1000 person-years, 8 and the higher rates, over 10 per 1000 person-years, were reported in 15-26-year-old people, 9, 10 sex workers, 11 men who have sex with men 12, 13 and HIV-infected individuals. 13 In China, data regarding the incidence rate of AGWs mainly come from the National Notifiable Disease Report System (NNDRS); however, as AGWs is not a mandatory reported disease, many AGW cases are missed. The reported incidence rates from the NNDRS, which were 0.24-0.30 per 1000 person-years from 2008 to 2016, might severely underestimate the real disease burden of AGWs in China, 14 and data from the general population based on cohort studies are scarce.",

The huge missing report rate can probably be explained by the following factors: first, in China, AGWs is a nonnotifiable disease, and thus, reports of AGWs in the NNDRS were not carefully monitored and managed; and second, due to a variety of psychological and social reasons, patients with AGWs might not seek health care or may select private clinics that have no access to NNDRS for treatment. As decades are needed to observe the effectiveness of HPV vaccines against cervical cancers at the population level, the NNDRS for AGWs in China should be strengthened and monitored so that the effectiveness of HPV vaccines can be evaluated based on the incidence of AGWs over a short period.",

Although younger and sexually active adults had the peak incidence, older adults remained at risk of acquiring AGWs and also needed to be vaccinated. In accordance with another study, coinfection with oncogenic types 16 and 18 was also found in subjects with AGWs. 24 AGW cases coinfected with high-risk HPV types were at a higher risk of suffering anogenital cancers and head and neck cancers, so more attention should be paid to consecutively monitor these infections after treatment. 7 Based on the self-reported AGWs during a lifetime, men had a higher prevalence than women; however, the reverse was observed in the prospective study and for the self-reported AGW cases during the past 12 months. In fact, it is a disputed issue whether there are sexbased discrepancies in the incidence of AGWs. 8 The epidemiological studies, however, have consistently confirmed that women have an earlier peak incidence age than men. [25] [26] [27] In our study, 20-25-year-old females and 25-30-year-old males had the highest incidence rate. This age-specific variation may be due to sexual mixing patterns, where younger women tended to have sex with older men. Another potential cause may be that females had a shorter incubation period of HPV 6 or 11 than men. After the incident HPV 6 or 11 infection, the median time of developing AGWs was 2.9 months in women, whereas it was 11 months in males. 28, 29 The longer period in men may be the reason why no male cases were observed during the 1-year period of our prospective study.",

Second, although one-to-one questionnaire interviews in an independent room were conducted by a same-sex trained investigator, social desirability bias might occur when we collected the information about sexual behavior and other factors. Furthermore, the follow-up period is only 1 year in this study, which is similar to the median time from incident HPV 6 or 11 infection to the lesion development among males, 28, 29 coupled with that men who contracted AGWs are more easily to recognize the lesions and refuse to continue the visits. Therefore, our perspective study may underestimate the incidence of AGWs in men.",
