            "text": "Introduction Cardiovascular (CV) disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, [1] and is associated with activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Within the RAS, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) converts angiotensin (Ang) I to the vasoconstrictor and pro-atherosclerotic peptide Ang II, [2] whilst ACE2 is an endogenous inhibitor of the RAS through its major action to degrade Ang II. [3] ACE2 is highly expressed in the heart and blood vessels [4] and is cleaved from the cell surface to release the catalytically active ectodomain [5] into the circulation through the action of tumour necrosis factor alpha converting enzyme (TACE). [6] In human myocardium, ACE2 is localized to the endothelium of the microcirculation, [7] and is also present in the media of atherosclerotic radial arteries. [8] In healthy individuals, circulating ACE2 activity levels are low [9, 10] but increase in the presence of CV disease or risk factors including heart failure (HF), [11] atrial fibrillation (AF), [12] kidney disease [13, 14] and type 1 diabetes. [15] To date, there is limited information on the prognostic role of circulating ACE2 activity levels and the results are conflicting. For example, increased ACE2 activity predicted adverse CV outcomes in heart failure, [16] but not in patients after emergency orthopedic surgery [17] or with chronic kidney disease. [13, 14] These differences may reflect the patient population, the relative cardiovascular risk of the patient population or the length of follow up. The aim of this study was to investigate the utility of plasma ACE2 activity levels to predict CV events in a high-risk cohort of patients with angiographically proven obstructive CAD with more than 10 years of follow-up.",

Plasma ACE2 activity was measured within 2 years after all samples were collected. Samples were batched and ACE2 assays were run over a period of 2 days. The catalytic activity of ACE2 was measured using a validated, sensitive quenched fluorescent substrate-based assay as previously described. [9] Briefly, plasma (0.25 ml) was diluted into low-ionic-strength buffer (20 mmol/L Tris-HCl, pH 6.5) and added to 200 \u03bcl ANXSepharose 4 Fast-Flow resin (Amersham Biosciences, GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) that removed a previously characterized endogenous inhibitor of ACE2 activity. [9] After binding and washing, the resulting eluate was assayed for ACE2 catalytic activity. Duplicate samples were incubated with the ACE2-specific quenched fluorescent substrate, with or without 100 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid. The rate of substrate cleavage was determined by comparison to a standard curve of the free fluorophore, 4-amino-methoxycoumarin (MCA; Sigma, MO, USA) and expressed as \u03c1mole of substrate cleaved/mL of plasma/min. The intra-assay and inter-assay coefficient of variation was 5.6 and 11.8% respectively. The primary endpoint was a composite of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) defined as CV death, hospitalisation for HF or myocardial infarction (MI). The secondary endpoint was HF hospitalisation. Endpoints were described according to the 2014 American College of Cardiology/ American Heart Association definitions for CV endpoints in clinical trials. [19] CV death was defined as death due to sudden cardiac death, HF, acute MI, cerebrovascular accident, CV haemorrhage, CV procedures or other CV causes, that is death not included in the previous categories but with a specific, known CV cause such as pulmonary embolism. [19] Hospitalisation for HF was defined as an event where the patient is admitted to the hospital with a primary diagnosis of HF where the length of stay is at least 24 hours, where the patient exhibits new or worsening symptoms of heart failure on presentation, has objective evidence of new or worsening heart failure and receives intensification of treatment specifically for heart failure. [19] Myocardial infarction was defined as the clinical diagnosis of ST elevation or non-ST elevation myocardial infarction according to established criteria. [20, 21] Clinical outcomes were collected by an experienced blinded investigator via medical records review and by contacting each patient and/or the nominated general practitioner for additional information.",

[15] The same pattern was observed in kidney transplant recipients with a history of CAD, [23] further supporting the association between raised circulating ACE2 activity and coronary atherosclerosis. In another study of patients with angiographically confirmed CAD, Ortiz-Perez et al. demonstrated elevated levels of circulating ACE2 at baseline (24-48h) in patients presenting with ST-elevation myocardial infarction compared to a control group of patients without known CAD. [24] It is not therefore clear from the Ortiz-Perez et al. study whether the increase in circulating ACE2 reflects acute cardiac injury or underlying atherosclerosis. Our study extends knowledge in this regard as we included only patients with angiographically proven obstructive coronary artery disease, both with and without an acute presentation. As there was no difference in ACE2 according to presentation, our results suggest that the increase in plasma ACE2 reflects underlying atherosclerosis rather than acute myocardial injury.",

            "text": "The importance of the RAS in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis is well established and indeed targeted pharmacological inhibition of the classic RAS improves outcomes in atherosclerotic disease including CAD. [25] In experimental models of atherosclerosis, we and others reported that ACE2 is expressed in vascular endothelial cells, macrophages and smooth muscle cells within atherosclerotic plaques. [26, 27] We also reported that ACE2 was present in atherosclerotic blood vessels in patients with CAD undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery. [8] Experimental studies have shown that ACE2 overexpression promotes atherosclerotic plaque stability and attenuates atherosclerotic lesions [28, 29] . Activation of TACE results in increased ACE2 shedding from tissue into the circulation. [6] Shedding and hence loss of ACE2 from the tissue is mediated by angiotensin II and results in the pro-inflammatory effects of angiotensin II being unopposed. [6] Certainly in a rabbit model of atherosclerosis, gene silencing of TACE enhanced plaque stability and improved vascular remodelling, [30] possibly via reduced tissue ACE2 shedding. These findings reinforce the important counter-regulatory role of ACE2 in atherosclerosis and suggest that modulation of ACE2 could offer a future therapeutic option in patients with atherosclerotic disease. The relationship between tissue and circulating levels of ACE2 is not yet understood. It has been postulated plasma ACE2 levels may parallel tissue ACE2 expression with a constant rate of shedding in normal physiology [16] , although there are no studies that have concurrently measured both tissue and circulating ACE2 and TACE levels to address this hypothesis. Our findings raise the possibility that in human atherosclerosis, increased plasma ACE2 activity in those with adverse cardiovascular outcomes reflect a persistent albeit insufficient counter-regulatory process to shift the balance away from the deleterious effects of sustained Ang II activation. Genetic variation in and around the gene encoding ACE2 may account for differences in ACE2 expression or activity. Indeed, the location of the ACE2 gene within the X chromosome in an area where genes are known to escape X-inactivation may contribute to phenotypic differences between sexes and tissue-specific differences in X-inactivation. [31] Furthermore, the rs1978124 polymorphism in the ACE2 gene has been associated with poorer outcomes in two separate CAD cohorts of Chinese Han [32] and European [33] ancestry but there are not yet studies that combine genetic approaches with measurement of plasma ACE2 activity. [34] The study has a number of limitations including the relatively small sample size and the use of a conventional troponin assay, as a high sensitivity assay was not available at the time of patient recruitment. Furthermore, the finding of elevated plasma ACE2 activity and its association with adverse outcomes only suggest a possible relationship and does not determine cause or effect. However major strengths include the detailed angiographic assessment and the long term follow up.",
