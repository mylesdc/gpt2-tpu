            "text": "Zika virus (ZIKV), a re-emerging flavivirus associated with neurological disorders, has spread rapidly to more than 70 countries and territories. However, no specific vaccines or antiviral drugs are currently available to prevent or treat ZIKV infection. Here we report that a synthetic peptide derived from the stem region of ZIKV envelope protein, designated Z2, potently inhibits infection of ZIKV and other flaviviruses in vitro. We show that Z2 interacts with ZIKV surface protein and disrupts the integrity of the viral membrane. Z2 can penetrate the placental barrier to enter fetal tissues and is safe for use in pregnant mice. Intraperitoneal administration of Z2 inhibits vertical transmission of ZIKV in pregnant C57BL/6 mice and protects type I or type I/II interferon receptor-deficient mice against lethal ZIKV challenge. Thus, Z2 has potential to be further developed as an antiviral treatment against ZIKV infection in high-risk populations, particularly pregnant women.",

            "text": "Z ika virus (ZIKV), a re-emerging mosquito-borne flavivirus, is an enveloped, positive single-stranded RNA virus 1, 2 . As of 20 October 2016, 73 countries and territories had reported continuing vector-borne transmission of ZIKV (http://www.who.int/emergencies/zika-virus/en). In addition to Africa and Asia-Pacific regions, the Americas, particularly South America, are areas at risk for ZIKV transmission 3 . It is concerning that ZIKV infection can cause severe congenital brain developmental abnormalities, including microcephaly [4] [5] [6] , and that it is a trigger of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome 7, 8 . Currently, no specific anti-ZIKV therapeutic or vaccine is available, thus calling for the development of effective and safe antiviral drugs and vaccines for worldwide treatment and prevention of ZIKV infection. Some small-molecule compounds, such as 7-Deaza-2 0 -C-Methyladenosine 9 , 2 0 -C-methylated nucleosides 10 and ( \u00c0 )-epigallocatechin gallate 11 , as well as some US Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs used in clinics for other purposes, such as PHA-690509, niclosamide, bortezomib, mycophenolic acid, mefloquine, daptomycin and bromocriptine [12] [13] [14] , were found to inhibit ZIKV infection. However, the safety of small-molecule drugs for pregnant women requires more extensive evaluation. 2A10G6, a murine antibody, with broad flavivirus-neutralizing activity by targeting the ZIKV envelope (E) protein could neutralize ZIKV infection in vitro and in vivo 15 . However, its relatively low efficacy and requirement for humanization are main obstacles to its further development. ZIKV-117, a human monoclonal antibody (mAb), can broadly neutralize infection of ZIKV strains 16 . However, the high cost may limit its application in developing countries, such as Brazil.",

We next aligned these sequences with those in the E proteins of other flaviviruses, including Japanese encephalitis virus, yellow fever virus (YFV) and West Nile virus. We found that the sequence in this region is highly conserved among flaviviruses with amino-acid sequence conservation of 64 to 82% ( Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 1 ), implying that this region may play important roles in flavivirus infection. Finally, we located this region in the 3.8 \u00c5 resolution cryo-electron microscope structure of ZIKV (Protein Data Bank: 5IRE) 30 , as shown in pink in Fig. 1b , and it was confirmed as the membrane-proximal stem region of ZIKV E protein (residues 421-453), and this was then used as the basis for the design and synthesis of peptide Z2 and the scrambled peptide of Z2 (Z2-scr).",

It was reported that ZIKV infection of these cells resulted in obvious cytopathic effects (CPE) 34 . Using this assay, we tested the inhibitory activity of Z2 at different concentrations on infection of ZIKV strain SZ01. We found that Z2 inhibited ZIKV infection in a dose-dependent manner with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) value of 1.75 \u00b1 0.13 mM (mean \u00b1 s.d., n \u00bc 3) in BHK21 cells (Fig. 2a ) and 3.69 \u00b1 0.27 mM (n \u00bc 3) in Vero cells (Fig. 2b) , while Z2-scr as a negative control showed no significant inhibition on ZIKV infection. We also used the plaque reduction assay and BHK21 cells to test anti-ZIKV activity. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 2 , the IC 50 value is 2.61\u00b10.46 mM (n \u00bc 3), suggesting that the result derived from the plaque reduction assay is consistent with that obtained from colorimetric CCK8 assay. The ZIKV-induced CPE in BHK21 and Vero cells were visibly reduced by Z2 at 5 mM, while Z2-scr at the same concentration exhibited no inhibitory activity (Fig. 2c ). In line with the data from CCK8 assay, the result from immunofluorescence staining showed that Z2 at a concentration of 10 mM almost completely blocked ZIKV E protein expression in BHK21 and Vero cells (Fig. 2d) . We then evaluated the antiviral activity of Z2 against other ZIKV strains. As shown in Table 1 , Z2 was also effective in inhibiting infection of ZIKV strains FLR and MR766 in BHK21 cells with IC 50 values of about 4 and 14 mM, respectively, suggesting that Z2 possesses broad inhibitory activity against ZIKV strains isolated from patients or rhesus monkeys in different regions of the world.",

Using a flow cytometric analysis, we demonstrated that the 293T cells transfected with pcDNA3.1-Env could be stained by Z2-Cy5, whereas the 293T cells expressing no E protein showed only background staining (Fig. 3b) .

For example, the peaks of both genomic RNA and E protein were located at fraction No. 6, suggesting that virions treated by 1% DMSO or Z2-scr maintained intact. However, the genomic RNA and E protein of virions treated by 1% Triton X-100 migrated to different fractions, that is, peaks of genomic RNA and E protein were in fraction No. 1 and 7, respectively, indicating that virions were completely destroyed by Triton X-100.

Therefore, an effective anti-ZIKV drug should have the ability to penetrate through the placental barrier of the infected pregnant women to protect the fetus. Here we investigate whether Z2 can enter into the pregnant mouse's organs, and penetrate through its placenta to enter into the fetus' body. As shown in Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. 9a ,b, the fluorescent signals of Z2-Cy5 were shown at the sites where the liver and bladder were located and the dissected organs, such as liver, kidney, spleen and heart, suggesting that Z2 is able to enter into blood circulation and organs of pregnant mice.

However, to the best of our knowledge, none of these peptides has been reported to be effective against ZIKV infection in vitro and in vivo, or be further developed in preclinical and clinical studies. Here we showed that peptide Z2 derived from the stem region of ZIKV E protein is highly effective in inhibiting in vitro infection of ZIKV, both in BHK21 and Vero cells, and other flaviviruses, such as DENV-2 and YFV 17D. Most importantly, intraperitoneal administration of Z2 protected pregnant C57BL/6 mice against vertical transmission of ZIKV and protected A129 or AG6 mice, which are very susceptible to ZIKV infection, against lethal ZIKV challenge. The mechanism by which a peptide derived from the stem region of a flavivirus can inhibit infection by a broad spectrum of flaviviruses remains a point of controversy. It was reported that DN59, a 33-mer peptide that mimics a fragment of stem region of DENV E protein, acts like a disrupter of the DENV membrane, possibly inducing hole formation, leading to release of the viral genome 28 . Similarly, we found that Z2 peptide could bind to the E protein of ZIKV and disrupt the integrity of ZIKV membrane, resulting in the inactivation of virions. However, no detailed molecular mechanism or signalling pathway has so far been elucidated that would explain how Z2 binds E protein and disrupts the viral cell membrane. Electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions 43, 44 or viral capsid dynamic studies 45 mechanism, but this investigation is beyond the scope of the present paper. Interestingly, Z2 can disrupt flavivirus membranes, but has no effect on the integrity of pseudotyped VSV and MERS-CoV membranes and cell membranes, possibly because the lipid composition, protein components, charge and hydrophobicity among these membranes are different 43, 44 , especially for the flavivirus membranes, which are derived from internal endoplasmic reticulum membranes of infected cells. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude other putative mechanisms of action involved in the anti-ZIKV activity of Z2, such as inhibition of membrane fusion 27, 29 . However, we do not have sufficient evidence to conclude the similar mechanism for Z2.",

The low toxicity in vitro and in vivo of Z2 ensures the safety of Z2 for pregnant women and their fetuses. Protease inhibitors, on the other hand, will not work until the virus enters into the cells, which, in turn, may allow more influx of virions to fetuses. Without the specificity against ZIKV, protease inhibitors may cause harmful effect to high-risk pregnant women. Therefore, combinational use of Z2 with a protease inhibitor for treatment of ZIKV infection may have synergistic effect, resulting in the reduction of dose, and thus the toxicity of the protease inhibitor.",
