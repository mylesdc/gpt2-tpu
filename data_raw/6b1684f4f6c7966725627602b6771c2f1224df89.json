            "text": ": During 1992-2015, a total of 1,881,952 livebirths and 12,541 deaths were under surveillance. Mortality rates in neonates, infants and under-5 children had overall decreasing trends (P<0.01) from 1992 to 2015, decreasing by 84.06%, 80.04% and 80.17%. However, U5MR increased 7.20% from 2013 to 2015. Birth asphyxia, congenital heart disease, prematurity/low birth weight and other congenital abnormalities were in the top 5 causes of death during 24 years. The greatest and fastest rate reduction was pneumonia which reduced 92.26% with AARR of 10.53%. However, distribution of death causes was different in children of different ages. Accidental asphyxia and septicemia were in the top 5 of death in 28 days-1 years old children, whereas for children 1-4 years old was accidental death. U5MRs in Beijing are projected to be 2.88\u2030, 2.87\u2030, 2.90\u2030, 2.97\u2030 and 3.09\u2030 in the period of 2016-2020 through the predictive model. Conclusion: Beijing has achieved great progress in reducing U5MRs from 1992 to 2015. However, U5MRs may show a slightly upward trend from 2016 to 2020 as influenced by the \"Selective Two-child Policy\". The future points of child health care are the management of birth asphyxia, congenital heart disease, prematurity/low birth weight and other congenital abnormalities. Importantly, specific prevention measures should be implemented for children in different age groups. 36(1):41-6. 18. Liu X, Liu G, Wang P, et al.

Several studies have revealed an increase in mean maternal age at childbirth in Beijing since the \"Selective Two-child Policy\" was implemented in 2014. 10, 16 It has been known that advance maternal age was a risk factor of many diseases in under-5 children, such as prematurity and congenital abnormalities. [17] [18] [19] Our study detected that the mortality rates for neonates, infants and under-5 children increased slightly in 2015, with 5.46%, 6.84% and 6.82% growth compared to 2014 and 4.58%, 7.21% and 7.20% growth compared to 2013. What's more, the cause-specific mortality rate of prematurity/low birth weight increased 44.42% during 2013-2015. However, the cause-specific mortality rate of other diseases fluctuated in normal changing interval. Therefore, \"Selective Two-child Policy\" only made U5MR in Beijing occur a slightly upward trend instead of a boosting which may be the high level of health care and medical treatment reducing the influence of policy in U5MR. In this study, we predicted U5MRs between 2016 and 2020 through the forecasting model we established, 2.88\u2030, 2.87\u2030, 2.90\u2030, 2.97\u2030 and 3.09\u2030 respectively, which also indicated U5MR may appear a slightly upward trend in the next five years. So the maternal and child health care work in Beijing still face challenges and more investment and attention should be provided to health facilities involved into this field.",

The five leading causes of death were pneumonia (19.01%), birth asphyxia (13.15%), congenital heart disease (11.66%), preterm/low birth weight (8.53%) and other congenital abnormalities (7.75%) in 1992, in that order; whereas in 2015, this order became preterm/low birth weight (18.41%), congenital heart disease (12.53%), birth asphyxia (10.23%), other congenital abnormalities (8.95%) and pneumonia (7.42%). In particular, pneumonia dropped from 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 The number of deaths due to pneumonia, birth asphyxia, congenital heart disease, preterm/low birth weight and other congenital abnormalities declined by 92.26%, 84.56%, 78.68%, 57.18%, and 77.08%. Among the five leading causes of death during this time period, the fastest rate of decline was observed in pneumonia, the AARR of which was 10.53%; and the slowest rate of decline was observed in preterm/low birth weight, the AARR of which was only 3.62%. In particular, preterm/low birth weight showed a steady overall increase of 44.42% from 2013 to 2015. A similar trend however, was not evident in other diseases. With respect to all causes of death, deaths due to neural tube defects showed a decline by 98.94%, which was the greatest reduction observed; however, deaths due to endocrine, nutritional and metabolic diseases showed an increasing trend by as much as 110.70%. The cause-specific mortality in these diseases also showed significant fluctuations, but were all reduced by varying degrees after 1992 ( Figure 2D ).",

Thus, the present study is not limited by a small sample size, or low coverage rate. Secondly, our study revealed the long-term trends in mortality rates and leading causes of death in under-5 children through a 24-year analysis. Furthermore, we reported the health conditions of under-5 children following the implementation of the 'Selective Two-child Policy' in Beijing in 2014. The results of our study will provide suggestion for the government to assess the present policy and formulate further regulations related to maternal and child health care. However, several limitations should be considered when interpreting our findings. Firstly, because of the unique regional divisions in Beijing and the lack of specific data on each district, we did not analyse the differences between rural and urban areas. Secondly, the ARIMA (1, 1, 1) model forecasts future U5MRs reliably, but only for a short period. This is because the model only considered variations in mortality with time, instead of other possible impacting factors, such as environment, economy and politics. Data must be continually updated to predict further mortality rates. Other model which can predict U5MRs more accuracy and capture its patterns more specific are needed to explore.

The U5MR was marked by various types of influencing factors, as well as continuity in time. The use of traditional regression analysis methods to predict its trends was challenging.Time series analysis uses the factor of time to replace other kinds of influencing factors. The autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model is one of the classic methods of time series analysis, based on past values of a series and previous errors in forecasting.

Furthermore, the cause-specific mortality rate of preterm/low birth weight increased by 44.42% during the period 2013-2015. However, the cause-specific mortality rate of other diseases fluctuated with regular changes in interval. Therefore, we suspected that the 'Selective Two-child Policy' may induce only a slight upward trend in the U5MR in Beijing instead of a major boost. This finding could be attributed mainly to the high level of health care and medical treatment available and is less likely caused by the influence of the policy on the U5MR. Using the forecasting model established in the present study, we predicted the U5MRs from 2016 to 2020, to be 2.88\u2030, 2.87\u2030, 2.90\u2030, 2.97\u2030, and 3.09\u2030, respectively, indicating a slight upward trend over the next five years. Thus, our suggestion is that maternal and child health care in Beijing still faces challenges and greater investment and attention should be provided to health facilities involved in this field.Deaths due to birth asphyxia decreased by 84.56% from 1992 to 2015 in Beijing. On the one hand, it benefited from intensification of intrapartum monitoring and promotion of neonatal recovery technology in Beijing. On the other hand, it may be related to the increase of caesarean. There have been several studies verifying that the increase of caesarean section rate can reduce the occurrence of birth asphyxia. 20, 21 There has been a sharp rise in caesarean section rate in Beijing since 1999 and it reached 57% during 2009 and 2013, 22 which may take part in reducing the deaths in birth asphyxia. Whereas birth asphyxia remained the first and second causes of death in 2012 and 2013, respectively. Increased maternal age, obesity and diabetes are the risk factors of birth asphyxia, 23-25 suggesting that maternal education programs targeted at high-risk groups will probably further reduce the number of deaths due to birth asphyxia. Congenital heart disease has been the number one cause of death in under-5 children in Beijing since 1998. In 2009, Beijing established a local children's congenital heart disease screening and referral network. With the aim of achieving early detection, diagnosis, and treatment, the network has improved the survival rate and quality of life for children with congenital heart disease. In 2010, congenital heart disease dropped to become the second leading cause of death. However, the cause-specific mortality of congenital heart disease in children aged 28 days to 1 year and 1-4 years showed significant fluctuations. These values increased during some years, thus Page 14 of 23 For peer review only -http://bmjopen.bmj.com/site/about/guidelines.xhtml",

The maternal age in Beijing is increasing yearly and elderly parturient accounted for 20.04% in 2014.10 What's more, the increased maternal age is closely related to the occurrence of gestational hypertension and gestational diabetes and they are all the risk factors of congenital heart disease. 18, 26 Therefore, we should advocate pregnancy in appropriate age and improve prenatal diagnosis to decrease the occurrence of congenital heart disease.Preterm/low birth weight continued to be one of the five leading causes of death in under-5 children in Beijing. This may be explained by the increasing caesarean section rate in Beijing. The elder parturient and multiple births by assisted reproductive technique both promoted the rate of caesarean section which has reached 57% in 2014 in Beijing.22  Special prenatal care services might need to be provided to pregnant women of an advanced age and those who became pregnant using assisted reproductive technologies. Recent research suggests that higher levels of particulate matter of diameter <2.5 \u00b5m (PM 2.5 ) were associated with a higher risk of low birth weight.27",

However, deaths due to endocrine, nutritional and metabolic disease showed a general trend of increase by 110.70%, from 1992 to 2015. This might be related to elder parturients, and poor dietary practices; however, further studies and effective preventative measures are still required.It is worth noting that trends in mortality rates and the composition of the causes of death were significantly different in children of different ages. Neonatal mortality (<28 days) accounted for more than 50% of deaths in under-5 children. Therefore, the general trends in mortality and specific of causes of death were significantly influenced by neonates. Nevertheless, the conditions in children aged 28 days to 1 year and 1-4 years showed obvious differences. Therefore, different aspects should receive greater attention among the various age groups, so that different preventative measures can be adopted for children of different ages.For children aged 28 days to 1 year, the key focus of preventative measures should be accidental asphyxia through training of the guardians in the relevant knowledge and skills. For children aged 1-4 years, the key focus of preventative measures should be accidental death.
