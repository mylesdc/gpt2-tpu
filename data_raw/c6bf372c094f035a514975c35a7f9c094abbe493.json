As a result, it is currently being put to practical use in the reagents for detecting various pathogens such as SARS [4] and the West Nile virus [5] and reagents for identifying the sex of fertilized eggs in cow in vitro fertilization [6] . Furthermore, LAMP is a gene amplification method with a variety of characteristics and applications in a wide range of fields, including SNP typing [7] and quantification of template DNA [8] . In particular, LAMP is considered to be effective as a gene amplification method for use in gene point-of-care testing (g-POCT) devices, which are used for simple genetic testing whenever and wherever necessary. First, since LAMP can amplify genes isothermally, the amplification reaction can be carried out with a simple heater. There is no need for the special device used Pattern diagram of LAMP reaction and hybridization of fluorescently labeled oligo DNA probes Figure 1 Pattern diagram of LAMP reaction and hybridization of fluorescently labeled oligo DNA probes. The LAMP reaction takes place in three steps (starting material production step, cycling amplification step, and elongation and recycling step) by the primers depicted in the enclosure. In the starting material production step, the starting material (6) is generated by primers (forward inner primer (FIP) and backward inner primer (BIP)). A complementary strand (11) of the starting material (6) is synthesized from the starting material (6) by a reaction that uses itself as a template and by a reaction from an FIP annealed to the loop segment, thus making up the cycle amplification step. During this step, probes (probe F and probe B, respectively) designed for the region between the F1 and F2 region or the B1 and B2 region can hybridize to the loop segment. As the cycle reaction progresses, an elongation and recycling step takes place, during which elongated products (8, 13, etc.) with an inverted repeat structure are generated. Numbers 14 and 15, which have a cauliflower structure, are also generated. They have many loop structures to which probes can hybridize.",

Next, a large amount of DNA (10-30 \u00b5g/25 \u00b5l) can be synthesized in a short time (15-60 min) while maintaining high specificity. This characteristic greatly facilitates detection of the LAMP reaction [9] . Moreover, since the LAMP reaction progresses by generating a characteristic stem-loop structure, LAMP products have a single-stranded segment in the molecule (loop segment; see Figure 1 and reference No. 1). By using oligo DNA probes designed to recognize the sequence of the single-stranded segment, it is possible to carry out hybridization assay without performing heat denaturation after amplification. This means that all processes, from the amplification reaction to the detection reaction, can be carried out completely isothermally.",

The key to developing such simple devices will be figuring out how to simply and clearly present the final amplification results. The objective of this research is to establish new techniques for sequence-specific visual detection of amplification results by means of the LAMP method. To that end, we made use of a reaction that has been known for a long time, i.e., cationic polymers like polyamines form an insoluble complex with DNA [10] . It is well known that one of such the polyamine, polyethylenimine (PEI), strongly interacts with DNA. PEI is widely used as a nucleic acid precipitant for nucleic acid purification [11] and as an in vivo and in vitro non-viral vector [12, 13] . We discovered that an insoluble PEI-LAMP product complex was generated under certain optimized conditions when PEI was added to LAMP reaction solution. Using this precipitation titration, we investigated whether it was possible to perform bound/ free separation of fluorescently labeled probes. In this paper, we report the novel visual detection methods of the presence of sequences of HBV and HCV cloned to plasmid as a model experiment using this method and the results of an investigation of the basic reaction conditions required to achieve this.",

Forward Inner Primer (FIP) consists of F2 and the complementary sequence of F1, and Backward Inner Primer (BIP) contains of B2 and the complementary sequence of B1 when each sequences (F1, F2, B1, and B2) are defined on the template sequence as shown in Figure 1 . In some references such as Notomi et al. [1] or Parida et al. [5] , a spacer of few thymidines was inserted between F1c or B1c and F2 or B2 in the inner primer (FIP or BIP) so that one and two thymidine spacers were inserted in FIP and BIP of HBV, respectively. However, the spacer was not used in this study because the LAMP reaction can progress with the use of inner primers without the spacer as shown by Hong et al. [4] , Hirayama et al. [6] , and Iwasaki et al. [7] . The LAMP reaction takes place isothermally in the three steps shown in Figure 1 , i.e., starting material production step, cycling amplification step, and elongation and recycling step, by using of polymerase with strand displacement activity. First, the starting structure (structure 6) is generated from the template nucleic acid in the starting material production step. Next, the starting structure becomes structure 7 with a stem-loop structure by self-primed DNA synthesis. When the forward inner primer is hybridized to the loop segment and strand displacement synthesis takes place, structure 11, which is a complementary strand of structure 6, is generated. This means that an auto cycle reaction was established between structure 6 and structure 11. In addition, products bound by an inverted repeat with two amplified regions, like structures 8 and 13, are generated in association with the auto cycle reaction (cycling amplification step). Then, with these structures as starting points, products elongated to a length of several kbp and products with complex structures with cauliflower-like structures (14, 15) are ultimately generated.",

As shown in Figure 2A , precipitate emitting green fluorescence characteristic of FITC was obtained in LAMP reaction solution containing the HBV template, precipitate emitting red fluorescence characteristic of ROX was obtained in LAMP reaction solution containing the HCV template, and precipitate emitting a color (orange) that was a combination of FITC green and ROX red fluorescence was obtained in LAMP reaction solution containing both templates.

After LAMP reaction in the presence of both FITC-labeled HBV probes and ROX-labeled HCV probes followed by addition of the prescribed amount (0.2 \u00b5mol as monomer) of PEI (Mw = 600), it was centrifuged for several seconds using a desk-top, low-speed centrifuge.

(B) Diagram of principle of sequence-specific visual detection method that utilizes precipitation titration of LAMP products by adding PEI. First, a LAMP reaction is carried out using a LAMP primer set for two types of template nucleic acid and fluorescently labeled probes, which can hybridize to loop segments of each LAMP products. When a LAMP reaction corresponding to a certain fluorescently labeled probe progresses, the probe will sequentially hybridize to the loop segment generated during the reaction. On the other hand, an unrelated probe remains free in the solution. When an optimized amount of PEI is added after reaction for a set length of time, the positive charge of PEI neutralizes the negative charge of the DNA to form an insoluble LAMP product-PEI complex. At this stage, fluorescently labeled probes hybridized to LAMP products are taken up by the LAMP product-PEI complex together with the LAMP products. Since most of the PEI added is used for formation of the LAMP product-PEI complex, free oligo DNA probes cannot form a complex with PEI. When the generated insoluble complex is pelletized by centrifugation and the pellet is irradiated with excitation light, the labeled fluorescent dye hybridized to LAMP products produces fluorescence. Figure 3 Precipitation titration of LAMP products by addition of PEI. (A) Effect of amount of PEI on sequence-specific incorporation of ROX-labeled lambda DNA recognition probes by DNA-PEI complex (Mw of PEI is 600). When 0.2 \u00b5mol to 1.0 \u00b5mol of PEI was added as a monomer, almost 100% of labeled probes hybridized to the LAMP products for lambda DNA was taken up by the DNA-PEI complex. On the other hand, when 0.4 \u00b5mol to 0.8 \u00b5mol of PEI was added as a monomer to a reaction solution in which an amplification reaction did not take place, a small amount (<20%) of labeled probes precipitated. Precipitation of this nonspecific probe did not take place when unrelated LAMP products (PSA) were present. (B) Effect of the Mw of PEI on sequence-specific incorporation of ROX-labeled lambda DNA recognition probes by DNA-PEI complex. When PEI with Mw 600 was used, the fluorescence intensity of supernatant decreased only when LAMP product for lambda DNA was present. As the Mw of the PEI used increased from 1,800 to 10,000, the fluorescence intensity of the supernatant decreased in the absence of a LAMP reaction since the formation of insoluble PEI-oligo DNA probe complex occurred. (C) Effect of amount of KCI on sequence-specific incorporation of ROX-labeled lambda DNA recognition probes by LAMP product-PEI (Mw = 600) complex. Normal LAMP reaction solution (control) contains 10 mM of KCI. Since formation of the PEI-LAMP product complex was inhibited by an increase in the amount of KCI added, the fluorescence intensity of supernatant increased regardless of the sequence of the LAMP product. (D) Effect of amount of LAMP product for lambda DNA on sequence-specific incorporation of ROX-labeled lambda DNA recognition probe by LAMP product-PEI complex (Mw of PEI = 600). Even when the amount of LAMP product was 1 \u00b5g per 25 \u00b5L, almost 100% of labeled probes (1 pmol) was taken up by PEI-DNA complex.",

Oligo DNA probes for lambda DNA were captured in the precipitate when 0.2 to 1 \u00b5mol of PEI was added to 25 \u00b5L of LAMP reaction solution for lambda DNA. If the amount of PEI added is too high or too low relative to the optimal range, the PEI-DNA complex precipitate is not formed, resulting in oligo DNA probes remaining in the solution. This phenomenon is characteristic in ionic interaction between cationic polymers and anionic polymers [14] . Namely, when the amount of the cationic polymer PEI is too low, the PEI-DNA complex becomes anionic. In contrast, when the amount of PEI is too high, the PEI-DNA complex becomes cationic. In both cases, the PEI-DNA complex is solubilized as a result. This characteristic, which is shown in Figure 3A , indicates that this precipitation titration is based on neutralization of the negative electric charge of the DNA by the cationic polymer PEI. In the case of LAMP negative, a small amount of free probe was deposited under certain conditions when 0.4 \u00b5mol to 0.8 \u00b5mol of PEI was added as a monomer (< 20%). However, the amount of precipitate in this case was so small that it was impossible to confirm it visually. On the other hand, when LAMP products (PSA) unrelated to the probe sequence were present, no free probe at all was deposited. This is because almost all of the PEI molecules added were consumed in the precipitation of unrelated LAMP products, an excess of which was present relative to the amount of probe. In other words, more reliable detection is achieved by first confirming whether the LAMP reaction has occurred by checking whether white DNA-PEI complex precipitate is generated as a result of addition of PEI and then determining for which nucleic acid template the LAMP reaction occurred based on the fluorescent color of the precipitate. Because of the above results, the amount of PEI added was fixed at 0.2 \u00b5mol for the following experiments in order to avoid generation of free probe precipitate as much as possible.",

When PEI with different Mw was added to the LAMP solution so that the amount per monomer of each was the same, we found that sufficient BF separation occurred if LAMP amplicons were present, even if the Mw of PEI increased up to 10,000. That is, the fluorescence intensity of the supernatant of LAMP solution with specific amplification (lambda DNA) is lower than that with unrelated amplification (PSA). As the Mw of PEI increased, however, almost all probes in LAMP reaction negative solution formed an insoluble PEI-oligo DNA complex. This result means that the LAMP reaction negative solution cannot be distinguished from the LAMP reaction positive solution, which successfully amplifies the targeting sequence if PEI with a high molecular weight is used. As was also observed in Figure 3A , when LAMP amplicons are present, almost all of the added PEI reacts with LAMP amplicons, so there is little opportunity for interaction with free oligo DNA probes, but when LAMP amplicons are not present, all of the added PEI interacts with oligo DNA probes. Under conditions where a large amount of PEI with a high molecular weight can strongly interact with oligo DNA, an undesirable insoluble PEIoligo DNA probe complex forms because the molecular weight of PEI is high. Therefore, the average molecular weight of PEI in this detection system should be about 600. We conducted a similar experiment using spermine, which is a polyamine with a lower molecular weight. In that experiment, an adequate amount of insoluble complex was not generated compared with PEI of an average molecular weight of 600 under conditions used for the present research (data not shown). It is well known that spermine can also make DNA insoluble, as indicated in many other reports [10] . Therefore, optimal conditions in the case of spermine as a precipitant might exist, but since further investigation would have gone beyond the scope of this paper, no further investigation was carried out.",

Until now, not much attention appears to have been paid to the complex consisting of oligo DNA and PEI with a molecular weight of 1,000 or lower, which was used in this study. This is probably because the interaction between low-molecular-weight DNA and oligo DNA is very weak and because its practical utility as a vector or nucleic acid precipitant is low. However, Kunath et al. reported that the complex formed by PEI (5 kDa) and plasmid DNA was more unstable than that formed by PEI (25 kDa) [15] . Osland and Kleppe reported that spemidine, which has a structure similar to that of PEI, formed an aggregate with double-stranded oligo DNA, but it did not form an aggregate with single-stranded DNA [10] . Drawing upon these results, the low-molecular-weight PEI used in this study is thought to interact with DNA with high selectivity to differences in DNA concentration and structure (number of strands and molecular weight). The fact that we took advantage of this nature of lowmolecular-weight PEI as a nucleic acid precipitant for detection led to the establishment of this detection method.",

Since a large amount of amplification product is created by the LAMP reaction, precipitate of a size that can be easily confirmed with the eyes is generated when PEI is added to the LAMP reaction solution. Moreover, the fact that the amplification is highly efficient means that the amount of labeled probe for detection that can be added is large. As a result of these characteristics, the LAMP reaction followed by addition of PEI yields precipitate with a clear color and in a size that can be identified visually, as shown in the photograph in Figure 2 . Furthermore, the fact that the amount of the amplification product is large means that the range of the optimum amount of PEI necessary to generate the insoluble complex is wide. Thus, a precise system for adding the PEI solution is not necessary. This will contribute to simplification of g-POCT devices that use this detection method. In the case of PCR, the most widely used gene amplification method, the amount of amplification product is usually 1/20 or less that of LAMP [9] . Consequently, in order to apply this method to PCR, a device for rapidly cycling the temperature to perform PCR, a high-luminance fluorogenic reagent, a system for washing unreacted probes, and a system for accurately dispensing PEI would be necessary. This would likely be an obstacle to putting to practical use a simple, inexpensive g-POCT device for genetic testing.",

            "text": "There are several ways to make LAMP products insoluble besides addition of a cationic polymer like PEI. We tried carrying out the BF separation using chilled ethanol. Since the addition of chilled ethanol lowered the temperature of the LAMP solution, there was a strong tendency for nonspecific probes to weakly hybridize to LAMP products and precipitate (data not shown). Moreover, isopropanol and PEG are believed to be inferior to a PEI solution because it is necessary to add several times the amount of LAMP reaction solution and they are not as easy to handle. Therefore, we believe that low-molecular-weight PEI, which is efficiently insolubilizes amplicons with only a small amount, is the best option for high BF separation, as was shown in this study.",

There is no risk of false positives with the oligo DNA probes fluorescently labeled at the 3' end as in this study, so that highly accurate genetic testing can be established.",

However, opening the reaction tube after amplification is generally avoided to prevent carry-over contamination. Therefore, development of a technique for adding PEI in a closed system is needed to put this method to practical use. Some possible solutions could be to apply PEI to the lid of the reaction tube beforehand and turn the reaction tube upside down after LAMP amplification or use wax that responds to heat. Furthermore, we should be able to use technology like micro-Total Analysis system or Lab-on-a-Chip, for which much research is being conducted in recent years, to solve this problem.",

The biggest feature of this technique is the ability to visually present sequence information of amplicons without using an expensive source of light or a detector. In contrast, conventional genetic tests require expensive reagents, complex and skillful manipulation, and large devices equipped with an expensive optical system. These are the main reasons why genetic testing is kept within the walls of specific institutions or university laboratories with special equipment and trained engineers. The combination of the LAMP method and the new detection method described here can overcome several factors that have been preventing true practical application of super-simple g-POCT devices for genetic testing. If a simple, inexpensive g-POCT device that is small and light enough to be held in one hand and whose main components are disposable can be developed, the day when parents will be able to genetically test for a pathogen while sitting next to the bed of their child who has a fever will not be far off [16] .",

The hyphens were added between F1c or B1c and F2 or B2. The LAMP reaction for Lambda DNA was used as a LAMP reaction for a basic investigation to clarify the fundamental characteristics of the reaction that occurs between the LAMP product and PEI. A well-established LAMP product [1] for mRNA of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was used as a LAMP reaction product unrelated to the three LAMP reaction products above. A solution was prepared by serially diluting a LAMP reaction solution with a known concentration (28 \u00b5g DNA/25 \u00b5l) using LAMP reaction buffer in order to systematically investigate the reaction between the LAMP product and PEI. The concentration of DNA synthesized by the LAMP reaction was determined according to the attached protocol using a PicoGreen dsDNA Quantitation Kit (Molecular Probes, Inc.).
