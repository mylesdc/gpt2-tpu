            "text": "The remarkable advance in sequencing technology and the rising interest in medical and environmental microbiology, biotechnology, and synthetic biology resulted in a deluge of published microbial genomes. Yet, genome annotation, comparison, and modeling remain a major bottleneck to the translation of sequence information into biological knowledge, hence computational analysis tools are continuously being developed for rapid genome annotation and interpretation. Among the earliest, most comprehensive resources for prokaryotic genome analysis, the SEED project, initiated in 2003 as an integration of genomic data and analysis tools, now contains .5,000 complete genomes, a constantly updated set of curated annotations embodied in a large and growing collection of encoded subsystems, a derived set of protein families, and hundreds of genome-scale metabolic models. Until recently, however, maintaining current copies of the SEED code and data at remote locations has been a pressing issue. To allow high-performance remote access to the SEED database, we developed the SEED Servers (http://www.theseed.org/servers): four network-based servers intended to expose the data in the underlying relational database, support basic annotation services, offer programmatic access to the capabilities of the RAST annotation server, and provide access to a growing collection of metabolic models that support flux balance analysis. The SEED servers offer open access to regularly updated data, the ability to annotate prokaryotic genomes, the ability to create metabolic reconstructions and detailed models of metabolism, and access to hundreds of existing metabolic models. This work offers and supports a framework upon which other groups can build independent research efforts. Large integrations of genomic data represent one of the major intellectual resources driving research in biology, and programmatic access to the SEED data will provide significant utility to a broad collection of potential users.",

Today, tens of thousands of genomes are being sequenced by public and private institutions around the globe [3, 4] , and whole-genome sequencing/re-sequencing has become a routine step of virtually any analysis of microbial behavior. In some fields, researchers are sequencing hundreds of genomes from distant taxa [5] to explore microbial diversity, while elsewhere, hundreds of closely related genomes are being sequenced to understand environmental adaptation, to support pangenome reconstruction [6, 7, 8] , and to build maps of microbial variomes [9] . Sequencing is also being applied to aid in solving urgent biological problems, including the development of strategies to combat emerging or reemerging biothreats, such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus [10] , the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus [11, 12] , and the 2011 German Escherichia coli outbreak [13, 14] .",

Modern bioinformatics must be high throughput and high volume with a strong emphasis on comparative genomics, and the SEED family of resources for genome interpretation and analysis were specifically constructed to embody these characteristics [15] . The SEED resources are built upon the organization of biology into a modular set of subsystems, each describing a specific biological functionality (e.g., flagellar motility or histidine biosynthesis) [16] . Subsystems-based technologies were developed in the SEED with the view that the interpretation of one genome can be made more efficient and consistent if hundreds of genomes are simultaneously annotated in one subsystem at a time [16, 17] . The SEED Project, a multi-institutional effort coordinated by the Fellowship for Interpretation of Genomes (FIG) and Argonne National Laboratory, began with the ambitious goal of consistently annotating 1,000 genomes (http://theseed.org/wiki/ Annotating_1000_genomes); today, over 50,000 viral and prokaryotic genomes have been annotated by the subsystems technology. More recently, the SEED Project has been expanded to include the capacity to automatically generate genome-scale metabolic models based on SEED annotations of genome sequences, and the Model SEED system developed from this pipeline has now been applied to construct metabolic models for thousands of genomes [18, 19, 20] . The SEED family of resources now collectively serves as a repository for almost 5,000 distinct complete prokaryotic genomes, associated with approximately 30,000 annotations, 11,000 metabolic models, 178,000 protein families, 10,250 functional roles, and 1,060 subsystems.",

To cope with the increasing demands placed on the SEED web services, as well as the increasing volumes of data included within the SEED resources, we developed a secondgeneration of web services to improve throughput, response time, and access to SEED functionality.

The server also houses newly developed high-performance methods to assign function to protein sequences or regions of genomic DNA sequences, based on FIGfams [22] . Below is an example application using these methods that produces a relatively accurate annotation of most microbial genomes within a few minutes.

These data are stored in two tables: one for compounds and one for reactions. Next the ''classify_model_entities'' function is used to run a FVA on the SEED E. coli model. In this particular FVA, the reactions and compounds in the E. coli model are classified while simulating growth in LB media (called ArgonneLBMedia in the SEED model). At this point, the data returned by the ''classify_model_entities'' function is added onto the compound and reaction tables prepared previously. In the next step, the code uses the ''simulate_model_growth'' function to run a standard FBA on the SEED E. coli model, maximizing the model growth rate in simulated glucose minimal media (called Carbon-D-Glucose in the Model SEED). The data returned by this function are also added to the reaction and compound tables. In the final call to the server, the program uses the ''simulate_all_single_gene_knockout'' function to simulate the single knockout of all E. coli genes, and the results of this study are stored in a gene table.

The subsystems strategy, adopted as the guiding principle of the effort [16] , centers on leveraging expert annotations to define a small set of functional roles in all genomes rather than all the functional roles in a small number of genomes. 2. The subsystem effort provided a convenient framework for the curation of a set of protein families that became known as FIGfams [22, 23] , intended to contain only isofunctional homologsthat is, each family was intended to contain only homologous proteins playing the same functional role. When errors in FiGfams are detected, the underlying subsystems are updated and then the FIGfams are regenerated to correct those errors. The rapid evolution of the FIGfam collection has made possible a number of the services described in this article. 3. Using subsystems and FIGfams as the underlying technology, the RAST server was developed and made available in 2007 [23] . Thousands of viral and prokaryotic genomes have been annotated with the RAST system, and hundreds more are being annotated each week. 4. The high-quality annotations generated by RAST together with the ability to manually modify those annotations by human experts allowed for the automatic generation of genome-scale metabolic models in the Model SEED [18, 19, 20] .",

            "text": "As indicated above, the improvement in sequencing speed and efficiency led to a rapid accumulation of genome sequences and necessitated more efficient methods for large-scale access to genomes, annotations, subsystems, and genome-scale models within the SEED database. A SOAP server was first developed to allow programmatic access to the SEED data [21] , but several performance issues prevented the service from scaling with the volume of data contained within the SEED database. The server abstraction layer required the loading of numerous large modules on each invocation of server functionality, resulting in a noticeable delay in response to each server request. The encapsulation of the results in SOAP XML conferred significant overhead on the data being transferred. Finally, each operation of the SOAP server was atomic, accepting a single argument and returning a single datum. Trivial requests such as retrieving all the functions for all of the proteins in a genome took unacceptably long to complete, requiring a separate call for each protein and instantiating many threads on the server. The four SEED servers described here provide programmatic access to the SEED data and methods. They expose the current data in a form that is conveniently accessed computationally. The installation and maintenance of the client-side software require minimal effort. We have constructed the underlying methods to support relatively large-grained data transfers, allowing the construction of relatively efficient programs. In comparison to the SOAP server [21] , the new web services provide access to larger amounts of data in less time, and they have been engineered to respond to server requests with little or no server-side delay. Furthermore, the new web services provide a more efficient and flexible computing approach because they are designed to process batches of requests at a time, streaming the responses as they complete. These services provide access to the integrated genomic data, subsystems, FIGfams, co-occurrence data, annotation services, RAST annotation submission and job retrieval (thereby offering access to our continuing improvements in microbial annotation), and metabolic modeling. All client modules, code examples and documentation are available online at http:// servers.theseed.org, and we are continually expanding these services and improving the underlying documentation.",
