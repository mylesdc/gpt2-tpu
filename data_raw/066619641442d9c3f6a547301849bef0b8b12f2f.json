If linked electronically and scanned systematically, the information provided by these technologies could be mined to uncover new epidemiological patterns and associations much faster than traditional public health approaches. The benefits of earlier outbreak detection are significant, but implementation could be opposed in the absence of a social licence or if ethical and legal concerns are not addressed. Methods: A three-phase mixed-method Delphi survey with Australian policy-makers, health practitioners and lawyers (n = 44) was conducted to explore areas of consensus and disagreement over (1) key policy and practical issues raised by the introduction of novel communicable disease surveillance programmes; and (2) the most significant and likely risks from using social media content and WGS technologies in epidemiological research and outbreak investigations.",

Since they are often unanticipated and unpredictable, such outbreaks can cause fear, economic instability and social upheaval [1, 2] . Establishing and maintaining surveillance systems are the foundation of effective outbreak detection and public health response. Moreover, effective routine surveillance is central to the rational allocation of resources and addressing health inequalities, which cannot be tackled unless made visible. Because surveillance relies on the collection, collation and interpretation of large amounts of data, technological innovation has the potential to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of population-based communicable disease research and surveillance systems. For example, the increasing availability of pathogen whole genome sequencing (WGS) and the collection of passive data generated by internet and mobile phone use within a population, will provide new resources for communicable disease research and surveillance activities [3] [4] [5] .",

WGS technologies can provide rapid and accurate information about which microbial species and strain type is causing an outbreak and the timing and direction of transmission. Incorporating this information into surveillance systems will permit more accurate biological risk prediction and faster outbreak identification and tracking [6, 7] , but also reveal information about individuals that many people would consider to be private [8] . Concurrent with these developments in microbiological analysis, there has been a similar rate of technological innovation in data management. Using the tools provided by 'Big Data' , syndromic surveillance systems can track and integrate online data collected for unrelated purposes that potentially reflect disease activity in the community such as social media posts and internet searches [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . Integrating either or both of these new sources of information into communicable surveillance practices has the potential to greatly enhance current systems. If linked electronically and scanned systematically, pathogen WGS data and user-generated online information could be mined to uncover new epidemiological patterns and associations much faster than traditional public health approaches [14] [15] [16] . Incorporating these new technologies and novel sources of information into established communicable disease surveillance systems should improve our understanding of the rate and direction of disease transmission between individuals and within populations, provide earlier warning and more accurate monitoring of outbreaks, and reduce uncertainty and public fear during their early stages [8, 17] .",

However, there are also ethical and medico-legal risks in not using available information that could protect local and, potentially, international communities from serious disease outbreaks [21, 22] .

In this study, we analysed data iteratively in parallel with data collection. Rather than force consensus, we employed a modified technique that allowed participants to explain their views. Participants were asked to assess and respond to the levels of consensus/disagreement that emerged from each round to provide greater insight into the potential benefits, harms and risks of using new technologies to enhance communicable disease surveillance. Participants who completed each round were invited to participate in the next, but were free to withdraw at any time. We used an online survey platform (Limesurvey).",

In the scenario, the new system picks up a post on Facebook from Bob, a 25-year-old high school teacher from Sydney. His post suggests that he may have contracted highly pathogenic avian influenza on a recent holiday to Indonesia. Online discussion of symptoms and work absences also suggests that Bob might have spread the infection to several of his colleagues. Delphi participants proposed a number of responses to this scenario. While the mandate to respond to a potential public health risk was seen to be clear, Delphi panellists disagreed about how to do this and how to contact those most at risk (particularly Bob and his colleagues). After reading each other's comments and suggestions on the merits and risks of different strategies for addressing this acute situation, in rounds 2 and 3 we asked the panel to nominate which approach to contacting Bob they thought was the most appropriate. Figure 1 shows that, while a direct approach (speaking to Bob in person) was strongly favoured, a majority of panel members questioned the acceptability of using a social media platform for this communication, even though Bob had posted information about his health status in a public forum. Others were concerned that an online intervention could create panic by identifying Bob as a public health risk. As one panellist noted: DP #12: \"Where individuals have already disclosed information themselves, then one can make a reasonable assertion that the information is therefore not private. This, however, is not the same as that individual allowing or being willing to have their social media platform used to contact or warn others or to make further enquiries, since all of these actions have the potential to alarm, stigmatise or otherwise negatively affect the social media user.\"",

For example, there was consistent disagreement, across all three survey rounds, about the relative importance of confidentiality and public health risk and prioritisation of reasonable alternative interventions; these differences need attention and resolution. Experience shows that, with current analytical tools, interpretation of passively collected and analysed online or pathogen WGS data raises questions about what counts as significant or compelling evidence and what action, if any, should follow [43] . The absence of a policy framework to provide institutional support for new surveillance systems and guide subsequent public health actions comes at a cost [4] . Surveillance systems have limited effectiveness unless they lead to an organised response [44] . Although impossible to quantify, systematic non-use of data can amplify and compound the harms associated with inaction [22] . For reasons of transparency and public acceptability, if not protection, resolving these issues should be a priority because not collecting and using data of significance to public health can lead to preventable harms [8, 45] .",

Neither individuals nor companies have a broad right to privacy under Australian law. Instead, the law in this area balances public interest against protecting individual or commercial privacy interests and includes a range of protections for the public [46] . This extends to cyber law, which operates under a general principle that social media users own the online content they create, but have limited rights to control its secondary use by others (either individuals or organisations). Similarly, it is a long-established principle under Australian common law that there is no property in human biological samples. This means a person does not own biological samples taken from them (tissues or microbial isolates), nor does the laboratory or facility that holds the samples. As long as there is a clear public health (rather than research) purpose for epidemiological investigation, it follows that there are no significant legal barriers preventing laboratories from performing secondary tests on isolates without the permission of the individuals from whom they were collected [47] .",

Most members of the panel were perplexed by this impediment to secondary testing and argued that public interests should always override any property claims. We note that the case for such a pragmatic approach to issues of consent and ownership for secondary testing of isolates owned by commercial entities is bolstered by epidemiological considerations. Some degree of strain typing must be done routinely if this practice is to be useful for identification of transmission events [5, 16] . Therefore, legal reform may be required because any insistence on a high threshold of public health risk before pathogen WGS can be done would limit the timeliness and, consequently, the effectiveness of this type of communicable disease surveillance. The development of clear guidelines for the secondary testing of patient, food and environmental isolates should be a priority before the use of WGS in epidemiological investigations becomes routine.",

As is the case with many activities undertaken in pursuit of public health, some form of trade-off between public and private interests is necessary. In order to strike the right balance, it is important that the potential benefits and harms of enhanced communicable disease research and surveillance are weighed appropriately. The content of interactions between participants from the different policy networks sampled demonstrated a range of attitudes as to how health authorities should collect, link and use data. The panel concluded that privacy concerns and potential conflicts with commercial interests caused by enhanced surveillance techniques need to be managed appropriately, but neither should substantively limit the pursuit of public interests as important as effective communicable disease prevention and control. However, efficient surveillance across a large population is not achievable unless most people participate. A structured dialogue between interested groups and development of an ethically and legally defensible rationale for the design and operation of surveillance systems [49] , prior to their implementation, will help to reassure the public and other stakeholders and enhance the likely success of these systems.",

The initial response to participant invitations for the current survey was sufficient to generate a lively debate, which was gratifying, given that our invitation was unsolicited. Retention of participants over successive rounds was moderate and the balance between members of different sectors remained constant.

Panellists agreed there is a need to establish a policy framework to ensure appropriate safeguards are in place to protect privacy and that the public is consulted so that they are not unnecessarily alarmed by, or suspicious of, the introduction of new processes for data collection and analyses. However, the emphasis of reforms should be on enabling effective research and surveillance to be conducted, where common benefits are possible. In this regard, the concerns of Australian policy-makers and experts on this issue are not unique. A recent WHO review points to the need to engage with affected communities to establish the conditions and protections under which it is acceptable for surveillance to take place and develop institutional mechanisms that ensure ethical issues are systematically addressed before data collection, use and dissemination [45] . Given that these technologies are already available and have the potential to enhance the capacity of Australian and other health authorities to investigate and prevent outbreaks of infectious disease, with their attendant social and economic costs, the development of clear ethical and legal guidance is urgently needed. The absence of such policy and procedural protections means that public health authorities are likely to only employ these new technologies sporadically, such that opportunities to protect individuals and the wider population from harm will be missed.",
