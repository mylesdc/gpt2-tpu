IRE1 is the most conserved UPR sensor in eukaryotic cells. It has remained controversial, however, whether mammalian and yeast IRE1 use a common mechanism for ER stress sensing. Here, we show that similar to yeast, human IRE1a's ER-lumenal domain (hIRE1a LD) binds peptides with a characteristic amino acid bias. Peptides and unfolded proteins bind to hIRE1a LD's MHC-like groove and induce allosteric changes that lead to its oligomerization. Mutation of a hydrophobic patch at the oligomerization interface decoupled peptide binding to hIRE1a LD from its oligomerization, yet retained peptide-induced allosteric coupling within the domain. Importantly, impairing oligomerization of hIRE1a LD abolished IRE1's activity in living cells. Our results provide evidence for a unifying mechanism of IRE1 activation that relies on unfolded protein binding-induced oligomerization.",

            "text": "Protein-folding homeostasis is critical for proper cell function. Accordingly, cells evolved surveillance mechanisms to monitor protein-folding status and elicit adaptive responses to adjust protein-folding capacity according to need (Balchin et al., 2016; Bukau et al., 2006; Walter and Ron, 2011) . In the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where the majority of transmembrane and soluble secretory proteins fold and mature, protein-folding homeostasis is ensured by a network of signaling pathways collectively known as the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Walter and Ron, 2011) . In metazoans, perturbations leading to the accumulation of mis-or unfolded proteins in the ER are recognized as 'ER stress' by three unique ER-resident UPR sensors, IRE1, PERK and ATF6 (Cox et al., 1993; Cox and Walter, 1996; Harding et al., 2000; Niwa et al., 1999; Sidrauski and Walter, 1997; Tirasophon et al., 2000; Walter and Ron, 2011; Yoshida et al., 1998; Yoshida et al., 2001) . These sensors transmit information about the protein-folding status in the ER and drive gene expression programs that modulate both the protein-folding load and folding capacity of the ER. If ER stress remains unmitigated, the UPR induces pro-apoptotic pathways, thereby placing the network at the center life-or-death decisions that affect the progression of numerous diseases (Bi et al., 2005; Feldman et al., 2005; Lin et al., 2007; Lu et al., 2014; Vidal et al., 2012; Walter and Ron, 2011; Zhang and Kaufman, 2008) .",

In mammals, IRE1 exists in two isoforms, a and b. IRE1a is ubiquitously expressed, whereas IRE1b expression is restricted to gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts (Bertolotti et al., 2001; Tsuru et al., 2013) . Both IRE1 orthologs are trans-membrane kinase/nucleases that oligomerize in the ER-membrane in response to ER stress (Arag\u00f3 n et al., 2009; Li et al., 2010) . Oligomerization is crucial for IRE1 activation as it allows for trans-autophosphorylation and allosteric activation of its endonuclease domain, which for IRE1a then initiates the unconventional splicing of the XBP1 mRNA (Arag\u00f3 n et al., 2009; Cox et al., 1993; Cox and Walter, 1996; Korennykh et al., 2009; Li et al., 2010; Sidrauski and Walter, 1997; Yoshida et al., 1998; Yoshida et al., 2001) . Spliced XBP1 mRNA encodes the transcription factor XBP1s, which activates the transcription of several target genes involved in restoring ER homeostasis (Acosta-Alvear et al., 2007; Lee et al., 2003) . While the XBP1 mRNA is the only known splicing target of IRE1, active IRE1 can also cleave ER-localized mRNAs in a process known as regulated IRE1-dependent decay of messenger RNAs (RIDD), which serves to limit the amount of client proteins entering the ER, thus helping alleviate the folding stress (Hollien et al., 2009; Hollien and Weissman, 2006) .",

A putative peptide-binding groove that architecturally resembles that of the major histocompatibility complexes (MHCs) extends across this interface (Credle et al., 2005) . yIRE1 selectively binds a misfolded mutant of carboxypeptidase Y (Gly255Arg, CPY*) in vivo, and purified yIRE1 cLD directly interacts with peptides in vitro, leading to its oligomerization.

This binding causes this part of the protein to engage other copies of IRE1 and form the oligomers. To understand this interaction in more detail, Karag\u00f6 z et al. used a technique called nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to monitor changes in the shape of proteins. These observations revealed that binding to an unfolded protein causes other parts of IRE1 protein to change shape. In turn, these shape changes act as a switch that causes the oligomers to form. Stopping the sensor domains from forming oligomers inactivated the IRE1 protein in mammalian cells; this rendered IRE1 unresponsive to stress within the endoplasmic reticulum.",

Although the crystal structure of human IRE1a (hIRE1a) cLD displays conserved structural elements in its core, there are several notable differences between the crystal structures of human and yeast IRE1 cLD known to date ( Figure 1) . First, the helices flanking the groove in yIRE1 cLD are too closely juxtaposed in the human structure to allow formation of the MHC-like groove present in the yeast (Zhou et al., 2006) . Second, the yIRE1 cLD structure displays a second interface, IF2 L , which provides contacts for higher order oligomerization, which was experimentally validated to be indispensable for yIRE1 activation in vivo (Figure 1 ). In the yIRE1 cLD, an a-helix-turn region forms an important element in IF2 L making contacts with the incomplete b-propeller in the neighboring protomer. Notably, the residues corresponding to the ahelix-turn are not resolved in the hIRE1a cLD crystal structure (aa V307-Y358). Instead, hIRE1a cLD has two other symmetry mates in addition to the dimerization interface, which appear to be crystal lattice contacts that are predicted to be too energetically unstable to form biologically important oligomerization interfaces (Zhou et al., 2006) . Indeed, the equivalent of an IF2 L cannot form in the depicted hIRE1a cLD structure because of a steric hindrance from a prominent a-helix ('aB helix'; aa V245-I263) that is absent in yIRE1 cLD ( Figure 1 ) (Zhou et al., 2006) .",

Such model finds support in the notion that all structures adopted by a protein in a crystal lattice represent a singular snapshot of many possible conformational states. Therefore, it is entirely plausible that human and yeast IRE1 cLD use a common mechanism of activation and that the divergent structures aforementioned represent different states in a spectrum of possible conformational states that the IRE1 cLD from any species could assume. In this scenario, the crystal structure of hIRE1a cLD represents a 'closed' conformation that can shift towards an 'open' state to allow peptide binding in the MHC-like groove that is apparent in the structure of the yeast ortholog (Video 1) (Gardner et al., 2013; . Human and yeast IRE1 cLD's crystal structures display distinct features. The aB helix in hIRE1a cLD structure (pdb: 2hz6) , the helix-turn region and the incomplete b-propeller in yIRE1 cLD (pdb: 2be1) structure are indicated with arrows. The interfaces IF1 L and IF2 L and the unresolved dynamic region (aaV307-Y358) in hIRE1a cLD crystal structure are depicted with dashed lines. The distance between the helices surrounding the groove in yIre1 and hIRE1a cLD is depicted with red arrows. DOI: https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.30700.003 . As such, this model predicts specific outcomes that can be experimentally tested. Specifically, that (i) human IRE1 a cLD can bind to unfolded polypeptides, (ii) unfolded  polypeptide binding stabilizes the open conformation of the hIRE1a cLD, and (iii) the open conformation  of  hIRE1a  cLD  favors  its  oligomerization. Here, we used complementary biochemical and structural approaches to experimentally explore the mechanism of human IRE1a activation. We show that hIRE1a cLD-just like its yeast ortholog-directly binds select peptides with a characteristic amino acid bias. State-ofthe-art NMR experiments that probe dynamic conformational states further support an activation mechanism involving peptide binding to the MHC-like groove and stabilizing the open conformation of hIRE1a cLD. Moreover, we provide insights into the mechanism that couples peptide binding and oligomerization to produce active IRE1 oligomers. Importantly, we show by mutational analysis that lumenal domain driven oligomerization is crucial for IRE1 function in mammalian cells. Taken together, our results resolve the discrepancies between existing models of IRE1 activation and supports a model in which unfolded polypeptides can bind and directly activate human IRE1.",

To identify hIRE1a cLD-binding peptides, we designed tiling arrays utilizing ER-targeted model proteins known to induce the UPR either by overproduction (proinsulin and 8ab protein from SARS-corona virus [Scheuner et al., 2001; Sung et al., 2009] ) or through destabilizing point mutations (myelin protein zero (MPZ)). The peptide arrays were composed by tiling 18-mer peptides that step through the entire protein sequence, shifting by three amino acids between adjacent spots. We incubated the peptide arrays with purified hIRE1a cLD fused N-terminally to maltose-binding protein (MBP) and probed with an anti-MBP antibody. As shown in Figure 2A (left panel), MBP-hIRE1a cLD bound a select subset of peptides on the arrays. To maximize the available sequence space, we analyzed binding of MBP-hIRE1a cLD to these peptides irrespective of their topological accessibility in the ER lumen. hIRE1a cLD recognized peptide sequences found in both the ER-lumenal and cytosolic domains of MPZ, which we considered together in our analyses to define the chemical properties of cLD peptide recognition. We found that hIRE1a cLD-binding peptides with the top 10% binding scores were enriched in cysteine, tyrosine, tryptophan, and arginine ( Figure 2B , Figure 2 -figure supplement 1A, p<0.05). By contrast, aspartate and glutamate were strongly disfavored, together with glutamine, valine, and serine.",

            "text": "At a first glance, the amino acid preferences displayed by mammalian IRE1 cLD resemble those of the other chaperones including the ER chaperone BiP (Blond-Elguindi et al., 1993; Deuerling et al., 2003; Flynn et al., 1991) . Like BiP, hIRE1a cLD favored binding to aromatic and positively charged residues (Blond-Elguindi et al., 1993; Otero et al., 2010) . BiP is a highly abundant chaperone in the ER lumen, whereas IRE1 is present at orders of magnitude lower levels (Ghaemmaghami et al., 2003) . Therefore, if IRE1 and BiP recognize the same regions of unfolded proteins, the peptidebinding activity of hIRE1a cLD would depend entirely on saturation of BiP by unfolded substrate proteins-a scenario difficult to reconcile with IRE1's task of dynamically sensing ER stress. To address Video 1. The model displaying the transition of hIRE1a cLD from the 'closed' to 'open' state. The crystal structure of hIRE1a cLD is used to represent (pdb: 2hz6) the closed and the hIRE1a cLD structural model based on the yeast crystal structure (pdb: 2be1) represents the open state.

(B) Comparison of the amino acid preferences of MBP-hIRE1a cLD (blue) and His 10 -BiP (gray). The peptide arrays were quantified using Max Quant. The binding intensity in each spot was normalized to max signal intensity in the peptide array. The peptides with the top 10% binding scores were selected and the occurrence of each amino acid in these top-binding Figure 2 continued on next page this point, we compared the binding preferences of mammalian BiP (fused to an N-terminal 10x-histidine tag) on the same peptide arrays. We found sequences recognized by both hIRE1a cLD and BiP ( Figure 2A , Figure 2 -figure supplement 1A,B). Importantly, however, we also found profound differences. While IRE1 tolerated both prolines and histidines, BiP strongly disfavored these amino acids ( Figure 2B , Figure 2 -figure supplement 1A, p<0.05). Conversely, BiP tolerated serine and threonines, while IRE1 strongly disfavored them. Thus, IRE1 can recognize regions of unfolded proteins to which BiP would not readily bind and vice versa, thereby providing a plausible explanation of how IRE1 could recognize unfolded proteins despite of the vast excess of BiP over hIRE1a LD in the ER.",

Fluorescence anisotropy revealed that hIRE1a cLD bound to MPZ1 with K 1/2 = 24 \u00b1 4.7 mM and to 8ab1 with K 1/2 = 5 \u00b1 1.7 mM ( Figure 2C ).

The measured affinities therefore do not reflect true K d values). These affinities fall within the same order of magnitude of chaperone binding to unfolded proteins, supporting the notion that similar modes of fast transient interactions with unfolded proteins are adopted by both IRE1 and chaperones (Karag\u00f6 z et al., 2014; Marcinowski et al., 2011; Street et al., 2011) .",

We further truncated MPZ1-N by two residues at a time from either its N-or C-terminus. Deleting amino acids from the C-terminus gradually decreased the affinity ( Figure 2E ). By contrast, deletion of the first two hydrophobic residues from the N-terminus (leucine and isoleucine) abolished its binding to hIRE1a cLD ( Figure 2F ). These analyses revealed that the minimum peptide length with a comparable binding affinity to the full-length MPZ1 peptide is a 12-mer. This 12-mer peptide matches the chemical properties we found for hIRE1a cLD-binding peptides: it is enriched in Figure 2 continued peptides was normalized to their total abundance in the arrays. The normalized occurrences are plotted in log 2 scale. Blue stars depict the amino acids that are significantly enriched or depleted in hIRE1a cLD binders (p<0.05), whereas red stars depict differences in binding preferences of hIRE1a cLD and BiP (p<0.05).

Immunoglobulins (IgGs) mature in the ER using a well-characterized folding pathway, wherein the constant region domain of the IgG heavy chain (C H1 ) remains disordered until it binds to its cognate partner, the constant region domain of the IgG light chain C L (Feige et al., 2009) . We measured the binding affinity of C H1 to hIRE1a cLD by thermophoresis, which reports on changes in the hydration shell of a biomolecule upon interaction with a partner in solution (Jerabek-Willemsen et al., 2011) . By contrast to earlier findings that showed no measurable binding of hIRE1a cLD to C H1 under different experimental conditions (Carrara et al., 2015) , our experiments showed that hIRE1a cLD interacts with C H1 with a K 1/2 = 29.2 \u00b1 1.2 mM ( Figure 2G ). To further validate this observation, we measured binding of hIRE1a cLD to another model unfolded protein by fluorescence anisotropy, the folding mutant of staphylococcal nuclease D131D (Street et al., 2011) . We observed a comparable binding affinity of K 1/2 = 21.4 \u00b1 2.3 mM (Figure 2-figure supplement 2) . Our data thus show that hIRE1a cLD binds to full-length unfolded proteins with similar affinity as peptides, suggesting that these proteins display a distinct single binding site for hIRE1a cLD.",

NMR spectroscopy reveals structural information at the atomic level for dynamic protein complexes and is well suited to study structural changes in hIRE1a cLD upon its interaction with peptides and unfolded proteins. The hIRE1a cLD dimer is~80 kDa and thus is well above the size limit for conventional NMR approaches. We therefore used methyl transverse relaxation optimized spectroscopy (methyl-TROSY), a specific NMR method that allows to extract structural information from large proteins after selective isotopic labeling of side chain methyl groups with carbon-13 ( 13 C) Tugarinov et al., 2007) in select amino acids including isoleucines. hIRE1a cLD has 12 isoleucines per monomer, which are evenly distributed throughout the protein ( Figure 3A ). In hIRE1a cLD's methyl-TROSY spectra, we resolved seven peaks corresponding to isoleucines ( Figure 3B ), which then served as sensors of peptide binding and accompanying conformational changes. All isoleucine peaks in hIRE1a cLD's NMR spectrum displayed broad line widths ( Figure 3B ), which is indicative of chemical exchange resulting from hIRE1a cLD sampling multiple conformational states at the conditions of the NMR experiments. These data revealed that hIRE1a cLD is dynamic in solution.",

A largely overlapping subset of isoleucine and threonine peaks shifted when hIRE1a cLD bound to the peptides MPZ1 or 8ab1, indicating a change in a localized environment upon peptide binding ( Figure 4A ,B, Figure 4 -figure supplement 1A-C). Yet, a subset of isoleucine and threonine peaks displayed peptide specific changes. The chemical shifts displayed by the isoleucine peaks were not very large yet reproducible upon binding of different peptides allowing us to probe peptide induced changes in hIRE1a cLD. By contrast, the threonine peaks displayed larger chemical shifts, which is expected from their higher solvent exposure rendering them more sensitive to binding events ( Figure Figure 4D and E). Among these isoleucines, only the side chain of Thr159Ile faces towards the MHC-like groove. We noted that in comparison to the isoleucines 124 and 128, Thr159Ile peak displayed a larger shift upon peptide binding ( Figure 4C and E, Figure 4 figure supplement 1D). In addition to the central b-sheet floor, the aB helix that lies at the ends of hIRE1a cLD dimer (marked by Ile263), and the b-sandwich connecting the b-sheet floor to the aB helix (marked by Ile52) were affected, albeit to a lesser extent. By contrast, the unstructured loop extending from the MHC-like groove (marked by Ile186) was only slightly affected and the isoleucines positioned in the flexible region that are not resolved in the crystal structure (marked by Ile326 and Ile334) did not shift ( Figure 4D ,E). Importantly, binding of the unfolded protein C H1 shifted the same peaks in the hIRE1a cLD spectra as the short peptides suggesting peptides and unfolded protein chains interact with hIRE1a cLD in a similar way ( Figure 4F , Figure 4 -figure supplement 2). Taken together, these results indicate that peptide as well as unfolded protein binding populate a distinct conformational state of hRE1a cLD, consistent with a peptide-induced closed-to-open conformational transition. Moreover, the results are consistent with a model in which peptide binding induces conformational changes that propagate from the MHC-like groove via the b-sandwich to affect the regions involved in oligomerization.",

The unpaired electron in the spin label broadens (in a range of 1 to 2.5 nm) or entirely erases (distances <1 nm) NMR signals in its vicinity in a distance dependent manner (Gottstein et al., 2012) . Binding of the spin label attached peptide to hIRE1a cLD would result in a decrease in the intensity of isoleucine peaks depending on their relative distance to the peptidebinding site. Therefore, we analyzed the changes in the intensities of all isoleucine signals upon binding of MPZ1-proxyl peptide to hIRE1a cLD ( Figure 5B . Importantly, Ile128 and Ile263 signals, which shifted upon MPZ1 binding as discussed above ( Figure 4E ), broadened to a lesser extent, suggesting that these residues lie further from the peptide-binding site . Their resonances therefore shifted due to peptide-induced distant conformational rearrangements. Displaying the normalized PRE effect on hIRE1a cLD structure revealed that MPZ1-proxyl binding mapped to the center of the MHC-like groove, suggesting that peptides bind to MHC-like groove and induce distant conformational changes in hIRE1a cLD ( Figure 5D ).",

At the concentration range used at NMR experiments (25-75 mM), hIRE1a cLD was found as a mixture of various oligomeric states, where the main peaks corresponded to dimers and tetramers (with higher amount of tetramers formed at higher concentrations, see Figure 6A ).

AUC data confirmed these findings and showed that at concentrations close to its dimerization constant of 2.5 mM, hIRE1a cLD sediment as a single peak with a sedimentation coefficient corresponding to a mixture of monomers and dimers ( Figure 6B , Figure 6 -figure supplement 1B). In this concentration regime (from 1 to 2.5 mM), the hIRE1a cLD peak progressively shifted to higher sedimentation values with increasing hIRE1a cLD concentration ( Figure 6-figure supplement 1B) . Peptide binding to hIRE1a cLD shifted the hIRE1a cLD population to even higher sedimentation values ( Figure 6B , blue trace), indicating that under these conditions peptide binding stabilized hIRE1a cLD dimers and lead to the formation of oligomers.",

These data suggest that these isoleucines are part of the oligomerization interface and/or that their conformational rearrangements are coupled to the formation of the interface. Moreover, NMR experiments showed chemical shifts in the isoleucines on the beta sheet floor of the groove (marked by Ile124 and Ile128) upon formation of higher oligomers ( Figure 6E ). These coupled, global conformational differences observed by NMR strongly underscore the notion that oligomeric hIRE1a cLD adopts an active conformation and displays higher affinity for unfolded protein ligands.

To this end, we introduced the hIRE1a IF2 L mutant into mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) deficient for both isoforms of IRE1 (IRE1a \u00c0/\u00c0 /IRE1b \u00c0/\u00c0 ). In addition, we attached a GFP tag to IRE1's cytoplasmic flexible linker retaining its function as published previously for HEK293 cells (Li et al., 2010) . In parallel, we introduced hIRE1a-GFP to IRE1a \u00c0/\u00c0 /IRE1b \u00c0/\u00c0 MEFs to compare hIRE1a activity at similar conditions. In these cell lines, we controlled hIRE1a expression via a doxycycline-inducible promoter. In the absence of doxycycline, cells expressed low levels of hIRE1a due to the leakiness of the promoter. In those conditions, the expression level of the hIRE1a-GFP-IF2 L mutant was similar to hIRE1a-GFP and to the level of endogenous IRE1a from wild-type MEFs, as assessed by Western blot analysis ( Figure 8A,B) . We next monitored the XBP1 mRNA splicing activity of IRE1 in IRE1a \u00c0/\u00c0 /IRE1b \u00c0/\u00c0 MEFs harboring hIRE1a-GFP or hIRE1a-GFP-IF2 L mutant ( Figure 8C ). We found that unlike hIRE1a-GFP, hIRE1a-GFP-IF2 L mutant did not splice XBP1 mRNA after induction of ER stress by tunicamycin, a chemical stressor that impairs ER-folding homeostasis by inhibiting N-linked glycosylation ( Figure 8C , Figure 8 -figure supplement 1) (Heifetz et al., 1979) . IRE1's RNase activity is preceded by the autophosphorylation of its kinase domain, which can be monitored by a phospho-specific antibody. Western blot analysis showed no signal corresponding to phospho-IRE1 in the IRE1a \u00c0/\u00c0 /IRE1b \u00c0/\u00c0 cells expressing hIRE1a-GFP-IF2 L , by contrast to the same cells reconstituted with wild type hIRE1a-GFP, or in contrast to wild type MEFs, in which we detected phosphorylation of the endogenous protein ( Figure 8B, Figure 8-figure supplement 2) . Lastly, confocal microscopy revealed that under ER stress conditions where hIRE1a-GFP readily formed foci (>70%, n = 88, Figure 8D , Figure 8-figure supplement 3A) , reflecting its assembly into active oligomers, the hIRE1a-GFP-IF2 L mutant failed to do so ( Figure 8D, Figure 8-figure supplement 3B and C) . These data confirmed that cLD-mediated oligomerization is crucial for IRE1 function in cells.",

Here, we provide evidence that activation of human IRE1a occurs via direct recognition of unfolded proteins and that the mechanism of ER stress sensing is conserved from yeast to mammals. This conclusion is based on six independent lines of evidence. First, we found that hIRE1a cLD binds peptides with a characteristic amino acid bias. Second, NMR spectroscopy suggested that peptides bind to hIRE1a cLD's MHC-like groove and induce a conformational change including the distant aB helix. In this way, occupation of the peptide-binding groove is allosterically communicated, which, we propose, culminates in the formation of a functional oligomerization interface corresponding to IF2 L in yIRE1 cLD. Third, binding of minimal-length peptides induces formation of hIRE1a cLD oligomers as assessed by AUC analyses, further supporting this notion. Fourth, cross-linking experiments captured the oligomerization interfaces, which allowed identification of a functionally crucial hydrophobic patch at IF2 L . Fifth, mutation of this patch uncoupled peptide binding from oligomerization but retained the allosteric coupling within the domain. Sixth, impairing the oligomerization of hIRE1a cLD abolished IRE1's activity in living cells, attesting to the physiological relevance of the activation mechanism proposed here.",

These conformational rearrangements then lead to RNase activation, and thus allowing information flow across the ER membrane. Interestingly, our data show that impairment of lumenal domain oligomerization diminished IRE1's both RNase and kinase activities in cells.",

By contrast, our data indicate that Figure 8 . Lumenal domain driven oligomerization is crucial for IRE1 function (A) Western blot analyses show the levels of hIRE1a-GFP and hIRE1a-GFP-IF2 L mutant proteins stably expressed in IRE1a \u00c0/\u00c0 /IRE1b \u00c0/\u00c0 MEFs in response to various doxycycline concentrations. hIRE1a is detected by anti-IRE1 antibody and GAPDH is probed as the loading control.

DOI: https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.30700.027 The following figure supplements are available for figure 8: peptide-binding is important for lumenal domain-driven IRE1 oligomerization, leading to its activation. We therefore consider it most plausible that BiP binding modulates the response via tuning IRE1's oligomerization equilibrium, similar to what was shown for the yeast counterpart (Pincus et al., 2010) . In this way, BiP binding would buffer IRE1 activity at the early stages of the ER stress when the chaperones are not overwhelmed by the unfolded protein load, and during the deactivation phase, when the protein folding homeostasis is achieved. In this scenario, unfolded protein accumulation exerts synergistic effects on IRE1 activation, simultaneously freeing more IRE1 from BiP upon ER stress and inducing IRE1's oligomerization/activation through their direct binding to the sensor (Pincus et al., 2010) .",

Model of human IRE1 activation Apo-hIRE1a LD dimers are found in equilibrium between closed and open conformations (Step 1) (note that for simplicity IRE1's cytoplasmic kinase/RNase domains are not displayed in the model). Upon ER stress, unfolded proteins accumulating in the ER lumen bind hIRE1a LD. Unfolded protein binding stabilizes hIRE1a LD in the open conformation and induces a conformational change in the aB helix and the neighboring structural elements (Steps 2). This conformational change releases the block on oligomerization, thus leading to active hIRE1a oligomers by allowing the formation of an IF2 L -like interface in hIRE1a LD (Step 3). Oligomerization driven by hIRE1a LD subsequently activates its kinase and RNase domains.

            "text": "We speculate that the conformational change in the aB helix allows the incomplete b-propeller to form contacts with the residues from the flexible region, which is not resolved in the crystal structure (V307-Y358) forming the oligomerization interface in hIRE1a cLD. In this conformation, aB helix may provide additional contact sites contributing to the oligomerization interface. Interestingly, one of the symmetry mates captured by hIRE1a cLD crystal structure shows contacts of the aB helix with the hydrophobic stretch ( 359 WLLI 362 ), which we show to be important for oligomerization. We anticipate that in addition to this hydrophobic stretch, additional contacts contributed by these flexible parts may further facilitate oligomer formation. hIRE1a cLD's groove is enriched in aromatic residues and displays a negatively charged surface. In this way, the amino acids lining the groove chemically complement hIRE1a cLD binding peptides identified in our study, which are enriched in aromatics and arginines. In the crystal structure of hIRE1a cLD in the 'closed' conformation, the a-helices forming the MHC-like groove are close together and mask the residues on the b-sheet floor. When these helices are moved approximately 6 \u00c5 apart from one another, the groove deepens and exposes more hydrophobicity mostly contributed by newly exposed aromatic residues. Thus, opening the groove exposes surface chemistry that is conducive to IRE1 binding peptides. Our data support a model in which widening of the groove is allosterically coupled to the formation of the IF2 L -like oligomerization interfaces.",

It is plausible that similar to MHC molecules, select amino acids in unfolded polypeptides act as 'anchor residues' providing contact sites for hIRE1 a cLD binding Matsumura et al., 1992; Wilson and Fremont, 1993) . Notably, assuming an extended peptide backbone with an average length of 3.4 \u00c5 per peptide bond, a 12-mer peptide can fit without constraints into the 39 \u00c5 -long groove in the structural model presented here. This notion suggests that the groove ensures preferential binding of fully exposed, unfolded 39\u00c5 -stretch of a polypeptide chain. This recognition principle is therefore similar to that of Hsp70-type chaperones, where the structural constraints in the cavity of the substrate-binding domain allow interaction with the substrates only in their extended, unfolded conformation, although Hsp70 only binds a seven amino acids stretch (R\u00fcdiger et al., 1997a; R\u00fcdiger et al., 1997b) .",

            "text": "Supporting the notion of mechanistic similarities in unfolded protein recognition between chaperone proteins and IRE1, hIRE1a cLD and the ER-resident chaperone BiP bind partially overlapping as well as distinct sets of peptides tested in our peptide arrays, as previously shown for the orthologous yeast proteins (Gardner and Walter, 2011) . Importantly, the presence of distinct hIRE1a cLD binding peptides liberates IRE1 from an otherwise inevitable failure to compete with highly abundant BiP for binding sites in unfolded proteins. hIRE1a cLD's affinity for peptides measured here varied between 5 and 30 mM, which is within the same order of magnitude but at the lower range of those reported for most chaperones (Karag\u00f6 z et al., 2014; Marcinowski et al., 2011; Street et al., 2011) . For example, hIRE1a cLD binds the IgG's C H 1 unfolded domain with~30 mM affinity whereas BiP was shown to bind the same protein with~7 mM (Marcinowski et al., 2011) . We surmise that this difference has been selected in evolution to set the threshold for unfolded protein recognition slightly higher for the UPR sensors when compared to that of chaperones so that the UPR is not triggered until a critical concentration of unfolded proteins accumulates. Moreover, our data with the MPZ1-N-2X peptide suggested that IRE1 could display higher affinity for select polypeptides that present more than a single IRE1 binding site.",

Depending on the disease context, IRE1 makes life or death decisions in response to altered ER function manifested in these pathological conditions (Walter P. and D., 2011) . Our data showing that unfolded proteins stabilize a distinct IRE1 conformation suggest novel approaches to manipulate IRE1 pharmacologically. For example, it will be promising to design or screen for small molecule modulators that lock IRE1's groove in the open or closed conformation based on the chemical signature of the IRE1 binding peptides identified here. Such compounds could act as agonists or antagonists of IRE1 activity. As such, it should be possible to develop new classes of pharmaceuticals to induce or inhibit the IRE1 branch of the UPR, driving the desired IRE1 output depending on the disease context.",

Cells were grown in Luria Broth at 37\u02daC until OD 600 = 0.6. Protein expression was induced with 0.3 mM IPTG, and cells were grown at 21\u02daC overnight. For selective labeling, cells were grown according to published protocols . Briefly, cells were grown at minimal media in D 2 O supplemented with deuterated glucose as the primary carbon source. For purification, cells were resuspended in Lysis Buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.2, 400 mM NaCl, 4 mM dithiothreitol (DTT)(or 5 mM b-mercaptoethanol, if a nickel column was used)) and were lysed in an Avestin EmulsiFlex-C3 cell disruptor at 16,000 psi.

The contribution of each amino acid to hIRE1a cLD and BiP binding was calculated as described previously (Gardner and Walter, 2011) . The peptide arrays were quantified using Max Quant. The binding intensity in each spot was normalized to max signal intensity in the peptide array. The peptides with the top 10% binding scores were selected and the occurrence of each amino acid in these top-binding peptides was calculated. This value is normalized to their abundance in the arrays (Figure 2A) . To calculate experimental error, the amino acid occurrences of top binders were calculated for independent replicates.

For peptide and unfolded protein binding experiments, the peptides were dissolved in the same buffer at high concentrations (1-2 mM) and titrated in 1:0.5, 1:1 and 1:2 molar ratios. Two-dimensional [ 13 C, 1 H]-HMQC methyl correlation experiments on 13 CH 3 -Ile hIRE1a cLD were acquired with 86* and 768* complex points in the 13 C and 1 H dimensions, respectively. All spectra were processed with TOP-SPIN 3.2 and analyzed with Sparky.",

The labeled peptide was then dialyzed in a Slide-a-Lyzer dialysis cassette (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with 2 kDa cut-off to remove the excess spin-label and to exchange the buffer to deuterated buffer (25 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM DTT) for NMR experiments. Control samples used in the reference experiments contained (1-oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethylpyrroline-3methyl) methanethiosulfonate spin-label that was treated the same way as the proxyl-labeled peptide. Wild type hIRE1a cLD and quadruple mutant hIRE1a cLD (Leu186Ile, Ile326/334/362Val) and single mutant Leu186Ile were used in PRE experiments at 75 mM and 100 mM protein concentration respectively, in the presence and absence of equimolar concentrations of MPZ1-proxyl peptide. We normalized the PRE effect with the surface exposed area displayed by that isoleucine to exclude possible contributions from non-specific interactions with the spin label attached peptide (Clore and Iwahara, 2009 ). The normalized PRE values are calculated as follows, the solvent accessible surface area for isoleucines are calculated using the 'GETAREA' webserver (http://curie.utmb.edu/getarea. html, [Fraczkiewicz and Braun, 1998 ]) based on hIRE1a cLD crystal structure. The maximum solvent accessible surface by these isoleucines is normalized to one and the normalized values are multiplied with the PRE effect. The PRE effect is calculated by dividing the intensity of isoleucine signals in the control experiments with the isoleucine signals in the presence of MPZ1-proxyl peptide.",

Subsequently, a pulse of 25 nM doxycycline was given to induce expression of the GFP-tagged IRE1 transgenes for 10-12 hr. The following day, the doxycycline was washed out and pseudoclonal cell populations were selected by fluorescent activated cell sorting based on GFP expression for both wild-type (hIRE1a-GFP) and IF2 L mutant (hIRE1a-GFP-IF2 L mutant) forms of IRE1. The cells were selected in a FACS Aria instrument (BD FACSAria3), gating for a very narrow GFP expressing population.

To further increase the number of NMR visible probes in hIRE1a cLD, we mutated Leu186 and Thr159 to isoleucines (Figure 3E,F, Figure 3-figure supplement 1C and F). Leu186 lies in an amphipathic unstructured loop surrounding the putative groove in hIRE1a cLD. The Leu186Ile peak displayed high signal intensity consistent with a dynamic and flexible position (Figure 3F, Figure 3-figure supplement 1F).By contrast, Thr159 lies at the b-sheet floor in hIRE1a cLD structure where its side chain faces towards the MHC-like groove and, as expected, the Thr159Ile substitution resulted in a low-intensity peak(Figure 3-figure supplement 1C).We further enhanced the coverage of hIRE1a cLD with NMR-visible probes in complementary experiments in which we labeled threonine side chains with 13 C at their g 2 methyl groups(Figure 3-",
