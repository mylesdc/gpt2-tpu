The timely identification of novel viruses using NGS technologies is also important for us to control emerging infectious diseases caused by novel viruses. In this study, we identified a novel duck coronavirus (CoV), distinct with chicken infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), using RNA-Seq. The novel duck-specific CoV was a potential novel species within the genus Gammacoronavirus, as indicated by sequences of three regions in the viral 1b gene. We also performed a survey of CoVs in domestic fowls in China using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), targeting the viral nucleocapsid (N) gene. A total of 102 CoV positives were identified through the survey. Phylogenetic analysis of the viral N sequences suggested that CoVs in domestic fowls have diverged into several region-specific or host-specific clades or subclades in the world, and IBVs can infect ducks, geese and pigeons, although they mainly circulate in chickens. Moreover, this study provided novel data supporting the notion that some hostspecific CoVs other than IBVs circulate in ducks, geese and pigeons, and indicated that the novel duck-specific CoV identified through RNA-Seq in this study is genetically closer to some CoVs circulating in wild water fowls. Taken together, this study shed new insight into the diversity, distribution, evolution and control of avian CoVs.",

Several coronaviruses from mammals have also been placed in the Gammacoronavirus genus, including a Beluga whale coronavirus SW1 [21, 22, 24] . IBV circulates widely in many regions in the world, and can cause acute and highly contagious respiratory diseases in chickens of all ages and diminish egg production in hens [23] . Control of the disease is mainly based on vaccination, but antigenic changes of the virus may result in incomplete protection through vaccination. Although chickens are the primary natural hosts of IBVs, several studies have identified IBV-like viruses in turkeys, ducks, geese and pigeons [24227] . Due to the fact that few genomic sequences of these IBV-like viruses circulating in domestic fowls other than chickens or turkeys have been identified, the taxonomy of these IBV-like viruses remains uncertain. For example, complete or partial genomic sequences of only one duck IBV-like virus have been reported in GenBank. Additionally, partial genomic sequences of 39 goose IBV-like viruses isolated in only one country (Norway) have been reported in GenBank, and 33 of the sequences are only 208 bp in length covering a short and conserved region in the viral 1b gene [28] .",

On the other side, if the region in the viral genome is highly variable, the detection may be insensitive in identifying the target virus, although the sequences of the region may be useful in the phylogenetic analysis. Considering these factors, we selected a moderately conserved region in the genomes of IBV and IBV-like viruses, namely a region of the viral nucleocapsid (N) gene, rather than the highly variable spike (S) gene or the highly conserved replicase genes, 1a or 1b (Figure 1 ), as the target of the survey in this study.",

Figure 4 demonstrated that all the CoVs from turkeys and some CoVs from pigeons, ducks and geese, including two from ducks and one from goose identified in this survey, were similar to many chicken IBVs within the same Clade 1. The chicken IBVs identified through this survey from China all belonged to Clade 1 and were distributed in Subclades 1.3, 1.4 and 1.5. A total of four duck CoVs were identified through the survey. Two of them were genetically closer to chicken IBVs in Clade 1, and the other two were genetically closer to the duck-specific Clade 4 along with the virus DK2012-CoV which was identified through RNA-Seq.

Secondly, during the extraction of viral RNA, it is tough to completely delete rRNA from the host and some bacteria, even though rRNA deletion products have been available to minimize the inference of rRNA of the host and some bacteria [35237] . Consequently, many RNA-Seq reads belong to rRNA of cellular organisms. Thirdly, if the viral reads are highly divergent from any known viruses, no hits may be found for these viral reads. The RNA-Seq used in this study is based on Ion Torrent PGM, which is a small and relatively cheap NGS sequencer with much less throughput, compared to some other NGS sequencers, such as Hi-Seq of Illumina or Roche 454 FLX Sequencers [38] . Possibly for these factors, we have obtained only several contigs rather than the full genome of DK2012-CoV through RNA-Seq.",

To our knowledge, this report presented the first large-scale epidemiological survey of avian CoVs in poultry in a large country which provided the virus prevalence in multiple species of domestic fowls. It also presented the first global phylogenetic analysis based on the viral N gene which provided a panorama view as to the diversity and distribution of avian CoVs in the world and in China.

The host-specific clades or subclades may result from that different virus strains are of different efficiencies in replication in different hosts. This may lead to separate replication and circulation of different clades or subclades of the CoVs in different hosts, similar to reproduction isolation of higher organisms. Although the viral spike gene is directly involved in the viral receptor-binding, the replication isolation can also act on the viral N gene through genetic hitchhiking [30] . The regionspecific clades or subclades may result from geographical isolation caused by the limited transmission ability of the virus and the spatial isolation of the regions (e.g. Australia and Taiwan are both separate islands). The explanation of the specificity of the clades and subclades, in turn, supports the theory that replication or reproduction isolation and geographical isolation is important in speciation [43, 44] .",

To remove the naked DNA and RNA in the solution, the solution was further incubated with the cocktail of DNase and RNase enzymes consisting of 14 U of Turbo DNase (Ambion), 20 U of Benzonase (Novagen) and 20 U of RNase One (Promega) at 37uC for 3 h in 16DNase buffer (Ambion). This was followed by the extraction of viral RNA using the QiaAmp Viral RNA Kit (Qiagen), and the viral RNA was eluted in 60 mL of the elution buffer.",

Briefly, the RNA was reversely transcribed into first-stranded cDNA via the first adaptor. Then, the first-stranded cDNA was purified using the Ampure XP magnetic beads (Beckman Coulter). This was followed by the synthesis of the second-strand using the second adaptor. Primers from both adaptors were used to obtain the cDNA library. Then, the concentration of cDNA library and dilution factors were determined for the subsequent emulsion PCR. The emulsion PCR was performed using the Ion One Touch machine and Ion RNA-Seq Kit v2 (Life Technologies). Positive ion sphere particles of the emulsion PCR products were enriched through multiple steps by the Ion ES machine, and then the positive spheres were transferred to Ion Torrent PGM for sequencing.",

The swab samples were collected by taking smears from the trachea and cloacae of the fowls and placed in a transport medium. The samples were clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 g for 5 min, and the supernatants were inoculated in 10-day-old specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chicken embryonated eggs via the allantoic sac route. The SPF embryonated eggs were purchased from Shandong Healthtec Laboratory Animal Breeding Company (Jinan, China). The inoculated eggs were further incubated for 2 d, and checked twice each day during the incubation period. The dead ones were picked out and stored in a refrigerator. After the incubation period, the allantoic fluids of the live embryos and the dead eggs were investigated further by RT-PCR, as described below. In addition, clinical specimens were collected from 34 chicken farms in Zhejiang and Shandong provinces and treated using the same methods described above.",

Then, the best substitution model of the aligned sequences was determined as the one with the lowest Bayesian-Information-Criterion scores calculated by MEGA 5.03. This was followed by phylogenetic analysis according the best substitution model [30] . Bootstrap values were calculated out of 1000 replicates. All the phylogenetic trees were calculated by two separate groups to avoid manual errors. Phylogenetic relationships of the viral 1b gene sequences in this study was performed in the same way except that only several reference sequences selected randomly from GenBank were involved in the analysis.

Among them, 90 positive samples (85 from chickens, 4 from ducks, 1 from goose) were identified through the RT-PCR targeting the viral N gene.
