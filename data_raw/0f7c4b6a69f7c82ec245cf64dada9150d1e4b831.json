We conducted a review describing the effects and the limits of using herbal products in chronic liver disease, focusing our attention on those most known, such as quercetin or curcumin. We tried to describe their pharmacokinetics, biological properties, and their beneficial effects (as antioxidant role) in metabolic, alcoholic, and viral hepatitis (considering that oxidative stress is the common pathway of chronic liver diseases of different etiology). The main limit of applicability of CAM comes from the lacking of randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials giving a real proof of efficacy of those products, so that anecdotal success and personal experience are frequently the driving force for acceptance of CAM in the population.",

Despite the promising biological effects of curcumin, low plasma and tissue levels of curcumin due to its poor oral bioavailability and absorption, rapid metabolism and systemic elimination in both rodents and humans [36] may be responsible for the unfavorable pharmacokinetic of this molecule. To improve the bioavailability of curcumin, numerous approaches have been undertaken. These approaches involve, first, the use of adjuvant like piperine that interferes with glucuronidation; second, the use of liposomal curcumin; third, curcumin nanoparticles; fourth, the use of curcumin phospholipid complex; fifth, the use of structural analogues of curcumin (e.g., EF-24) [35, 36] .",

Ingestion of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) together with alcohol can aggravate the toxicity of alcohol. The degree of abnormal ECM degradation depends on the ratio of active matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs). A recent work studied the influence of bis-desmethoxy curcumin analog (BDMC-A) on the expression of MMPs and TIMPs during alcohol and DeltaPUFA-induced liver toxicity. Administration of BDMC-A significantly decreased the levels of collagen and TIMPs and positively modulated the expression of MMPs. From this study, we can conclude that BDMC-A influences MMPs, TIMPs expression and that it acts as an efficient anti-fibrotic agent [37] .",

Treatment groups were fed with ethanol supplemented with curcumin (400 or 1 200 mg/kg bw). The liver histopathology in ethanol group revealed mild-to-moderate steatosis and mild necroinflammation. Hepatic MDA, hepatocyte apoptosis, and NF-kappaB activation increased significantly in ethanol-treated group when compared with control. Curcumin treatments resulted in improving of liver pathology, decreasing the elevation of hepatic MDA, and inhibition of NF-kappaB activation. The 400 mg/kg bw of curcumin treatment also revealed a trend of decreased hepatocyte apoptosis.

Hyperhomocysteinemia is frequent in the Caucasian and its role in vascular pathology has been clearly established. In hepatology, experimental data in transgenic mice deficient in homocysteine metabolism enzymes have shown the presence of severe liver steatosis with occasional steatohepatitis. In chronic hepatitis C, preliminary data have shown that hyperhomocysteinemia is an independent risk factor for steatosis or even fibrosis. The physiopathological mechanism has now begun to be better understood. On one hand, there is a strong correlation between homocysteine and insulin resistance whatever its etiology. On the other hand, homocysteine has a direct effect on the liver, resulting in overexpression of SREBP-1 and favoring steatosis. It stimulates proinflammatory cytokine secretion such as NF kappa B increasing the risk of NASH. Finally, homocysteine could increase the risk of fibrosis by stimulating TIMP 1. Moreover, hepatitis C virus induces hypomethylation of STAT 1 and could decrease the antiviral activity of interferon. Results from in vitro studies have shown that the normalization of STAT 1 methylation by bringing betaine and S Adenosyl Methionine (which belongs to homocysteine cycle) restores the antiviral activity of interferon. Finally, treatment of hyperhomocysteinemia could have favorable consequences in steatohepatites and HCV infection [75, 76] .",

P. amarus extract was used, in 1988, in a preliminary study involving 37 patients with chronic hepatitis B. 22 of 37 treated patients had cleared the virus 2-3 weeks after the end of the treatment period and only one of 23 placebo treated became HBsAg negative [137] . The mechanism of action appears to be related to the suppressive effect of Phyllanthus extract on HBsAg secretion and HBsAg mRNA expression [138] and the inhibition of hepatitis B virus polymerase activity [139] . A recent study isolated a polyphenolic compound, 1,2,4,6tetra-O-galloyl-\u03b2-D-glucose (1246TGG), from P. emblica, and found that treatment with 1246TGG (6.25 \u03bcg/mL, 3.13 \u03bcg/mL), reduced both HBsAg and HBeAg levels in culture supernatant of HepG2.2.15 cells [140] . The role of Phyllanthus spp. in the treatment of chronic hepatitis B was studied in several reports that were evaluated in a recent Cochrane review. The authors included a total of 16 randomized trials but only one compared Phyllanthus with placebo and found no significant difference in HBeAg seroconversion after the end of treatment or followup. Fifteen trials compared Phyllanthus plus an antiviral drug like interferon alpha, lamivudine, adefovir dipivoxil, thymosin, vidarabine, or conventional treatment with the same antiviral drug alone and found that the combined treatment affect serum HBV DNA, serum HBeAg, and HBeAg seroconversion. The authors conclude that Phyllanthus in combination with an antiviral drug may be better than the same antiviral drug alone but clinical trials with large sample size and low risk of bias are needed to confirm these findings [141] .",

Systemic chemotherapy plays a palliative role while yields unsatisfactory response rates, which is partly due to the poor selectivity and low uptake efficiency of chemotherapeutic drugs in tumor [158] . Since the prognosis of cirrhotic patients seems to be largely influenced by the development of HCC, every attempt should be performed to prevent HCC in such a highrisk group. Oka et al. reported in a randomized controlled trial that a kind of medicinal herb, \"Sho-saiko-to\" could significantly decrease hepatic carcinogenesis rate in patients wiith cirrhosis [159] . Moreover, a number of clinical and laboratory studies have been done in the past decades in order to provide the scientific basis for the effectiveness of traditional Chinese medicine against cancer. However, actually, there are a number of contradictory reports due to various factors, as inconsistency in treatment schemes, limited sampling sizes and lack of quality assurance of the herbal products well-designed randomized controlled trials (RCT). In general, most of the published clinical studies are trials without rigorous randomization or they involved single group pre-post, cohort, time series, or matched case-control studies [160] . Herbs are generally used in combination as \"formulas,\" in the belief that in this way their benefits were enhanced and side effects reduced. Moreover, practitioners can adjust or customize the formulas to suit individual cancer patients. Through synergistic interactions between different effective ingredients, the herbal preparation can exert its effects in several ways: (i) they can protect the noncancerous cells and tissues in the body from the possible damage caused by chemo/radiotherapy; (ii) they can enhance the potency of chemo/radiotherapy; (iii) they can reduce inflammatory and infectious complications in the tissues surrounding the carcinoma; (iv) they can enhance immunity and body resistance; (v) they can improve general condition and quality of life; (vi) they can prolong the life span of the patients in the late stages of cancer [161] .",

Specifically, three specific issues that will require focused attention: (i) more well-designed clinical trials to support the effectiveness and the safety of TCM in the management of cancers; (ii) new parameters based on the unique properties and theory of TCM to assess the clinical efficacy of TCM in clinical trials; (iii) new approaches to research, given the nature of TCM herbs as being fundamentally different from drugs. Undoubtedly, a clinical study of TCM treatment is more difficult and complicated than the study of single compound drugs. In addition, the effects, as well as the toxicity, of individual herbs or single compounds derived from the herb cannot completely reflect the benefits and toxicity of the herbal combination [162] . As a goal, to develop TCM into rational cancer therapy, more well-designed intensive clinical evaluations and translational laboratory studies are absolutely needed. Also, close collaboration between TCM and conventional Western medicine professions and a combination of TCM with modern multidisciplinary cutting-edge technologies, such as omic methodology on systems biology [163] , would provide us with an attractive and effective strategy to achieve this goal. Although there are many therapeutic strategies including chemotherapy to treat cancer, high systemic toxicity and drug resistance limit the success full outcomes in most cases. Accordingly, several new strategies are being developed to control and treat cancer. One approach could be a combination of and effective phytochemicals with chemotherapeutic agent, which, when combined, would enhance efficacy and reduce toxicity to tissues [164] .",
