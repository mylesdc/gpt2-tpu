While some sequence elements are able to trigger programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF), very little is known about how the ribosome normally prevents spontaneous frameshift errors that can have dire consequences if uncorrected. Using high resolution ribosome profiling data sets, we discovered that the translating ribosome uses the 3 end of 18S rRNA to scan the AUG-like codons after the decoding process. The postdecoding mRNA:rRNA interaction not only contributes to predominant translational pausing, but also provides a retrospective mechanism to safeguard the ribosome in the correct reading frame. Partially eliminating the AUG-like \"sticky\" codons in the reporter message leads to increased +1 frameshift errors. Remarkably, mutating the highly conserved CAU triplet of 18S rRNA globally changes the codon \"stickiness\". Further supporting the role of \"sticky\" sequences in reading frame maintenance, the codon composition of open reading frames is highly optimized across eukaryotic genomes. These results suggest an important layer of information embedded within the protein-coding sequences that instructs the ribosome to ensure reading frame fidelity during translation.",

During translation, the ribosome reads nucleotide triplets in a successive, nonoverlapping fashion. For a given coding sequence, it is the start codon (most likely AUG) that establishes the reading frame. Since there is no punctuation between codons for successive amino acid residues, all three reading frames give rise to different codon sequences. However, only one reading frame primarily serves as the coding template for functional proteins because a high frequency of stop signals exists in alternative frames [2] . This feature represents a strong evolutionary optimization of codon sequences that minimizes the consequence of frameshift errors [3] . Unlike missense errors, which are not necessarily destructive to proteins, frameshift errors are deleterious as premature termination often leads to nonfunctional translational products. Therefore, the ribosome must keep the correct reading frame for hundreds to thousands of codons during translation to ensure proper protein production.",

Although codon:anticodon pairing is central to decoding accuracy, there is an extensive network of interaction between mRNA, rRNA, and ribosomal proteins [5] . The stepwise, codon by codon, progression of the ribosome along the mRNA from the 5 to 3 direction is primarily driven by translocation [6] . During this step, the ribosome undergoes massive conformational rearrangement, allowing movement of P-and A-site tRNAs into the E-and P-sites, respectively [7] [8] [9] [10] . It is thought that the coordinated rotation of large and small subunits ensures one codon precision in the movement of mRNA and the attached tRNAs after peptidyl transfer [11] . However, tremendous flexibility exists. In bacteria, while elongation factor G (EF-G) mediates one codon forward movement of mRNA:tRNA complexes, elongation factor 4 (EF4) catalyzes back-translocation [12] . Lack of EF4 has been shown to reduce translation fidelity under stress conditions [13] , suggesting that translocation is error-prone.",

The typical signals for -1 PRF include a slippery sequence, a downstream secondary structure (usually a pseudoknot), and a short spacer in between. With an increasing amount of PRF signals identified, it is clear that the ribosome bears tremendous flexibility in decoding mRNAs. The rich communication between the ribosome and the message is thus equally, if not more, important as codon:anticodon pairing in maintaining translation fidelity.

Importantly, the interaction between the mRNA \"sticky\" sequence and the 3 end of 18S rRNA offers a gripping mechanism after decoding to guide the ribosome in the correct reading frame during translation.

            "text": "To understand how ribosomes normally maintain translational reading frame fidelity, it is necessary to determine the spontaneous frameshift (FS) rate under physiological conditions. We adopted a luciferase-based bicistronic reporter assay, in which both the Renilla luciferase (Rluc) and the Firefly luciferase (Fluc) are synthesized from the same mRNA (Figure 1 (a)) [22] . A flag-tag was added at the 5 end of the Rluc coding region after the start codon and the full length flag-Rluc fusion protein serves as control for in-frame translation. For the +1 FS reporter, we inserted a single cytosine (C) between flag and Rluc, thereby placing the entire Rluc coding region into frame 1. Since no AUG start codons are present in frame 1 before the Rluc coding region, any detectable Rluc activities are derived from the +1 FS event during flag synthesis. To eliminate Fluc products via leaky scanning, we conducted anti-Flag immunoprecipitation in parallel. Notably, only after the FS events taking place within a window delimited by the nearest stop codons flanking the insertion site, can the shifted ribosome reach frame 1 coding region of Rluc (Figure 1(a) , highlighted region). Compared to the in-frame control, we observed a reproducible +1 FS rate of 0.52% in HEK293 cells and 0.37% in MEF cells (Figure 1(a) , right panel). After adjustment by the size of the FS window, the average +1 FS rate per codon in HEK293 and MEF cells is 0.04% and 0.03%, respectively. We next constructed a -1 FS reporter by inserting two additional bases (CA) between flag and Rluc. Once the ribosome skips two bases or slips back one base within the FS window, it will reach frame 2 Rluc coding region for translation. Compared to the +1 FS reporter, we observed a relatively lower -1 FS rate of 0.03% in HEK293 and 0.02% in MEF after adjustment by the size of the FS window (Figure 1(a) ). This value is in the similar range of spontaneous FS rates reported previously [23] .",

            "text": "technical artifacts. For instance, nuclease overdigestion or incomplete digestion will shift the resultant RPF from frame 0 to frame 1 or 2, respectively. Despite these inevitable variations, specific FS events occurring at particular regions could be discernable by altered phasing [30, 31] . We computed the in-frame rate (IFR) for footprints mapped to individual codon positions by calculating the percentage of RPFs aligned to frame 0. The IFR value represents, on a relative scale, how accurately the ribosome is positioned when a particular codon is encountered. A typical ribosome footprint covers 10 or so codons (Figure 2(a) ). If the codon identity at each position does not contribute to reading frame maintenance, we expect to see uniform IFR values among the 61 sense codons. Using the ribosome profiling data from HEK293 cells, we computed the average IFR for RPFs with specific codons at individual positions of the footprint. As expected, RPFs with different 3 end codons show little variation of IFR (< 1.2-fold, Figure 2 (a)), because those codons are not yet being decoded. For RPFs grouped by P-site or A-site codons, we observed a modest variation of IFR (\u223c1.5-fold). To our surprise, when the 5 end codon identity is considered, there is a substantial variation of IFR (> 4.5-fold) among the 61 sense codons ranging from 0.2 to 0.9 (Figure 2(a) ). This feature is independent of the RPF length because we observed a nearly identical pattern for RPFs with a fixed length of 28 nt ( Figure S1E ). Interestingly, for footprints with IFR values above the average, their 5 end codons mostly belong to AUGlike triplets (i.e., codons that differ from AUG by a single nucleotide) (Figure 2 (b) and Table S2 ). This salient feature is highly reproducible in biological replicates and in different cell lines ( Figure S2A ). All 61 sense codons are plotted by the average codon coverage score of RPFs (x-axis) against the average in-frame rate (y-axis). (c) Metagene analysis of RPFs obtained from HEK293 cells. Transcripts are aligned at the annotated start codon (1st AUG, green triangle) or internal AUG codons (blank triangle). The average read density at each nucleotide position is plotted using the P-site of RPFs stratified by reading frames (magenta, frame 0; blue, frame 1; green, frame 2). The aligned codon is highlighted, which corresponds to the 5 end of footprints when the P-site is at the +12 codon position. We next examined whether the codon identity affects the relative abundance of RPFs. The codon-specific RPF abundance is determined by calculating average codon coverage, which represents how frequently we observe ribosomes when that codon appears at specific positions of the footprint. Previous studies have focused on codon identity at the decoding center and the effect on ribosomal pausing [32] . Indeed, both the A-site and P-site codon identities influence the RPF abundance ( Figure 2 (a), bottom panel). Intriguingly, RPFs grouped by 5 end codons display the greatest variation of abundance with prominent pausing that appeared for footprints starting with AUG-like codons (Figures 2(a) and 2(b)). In contrast to A-site or P-site codons that exhibit only weak correlation between the reading frame accuracy and the ribosome dwell time, the 5 end codon identity of RPFs influences both footprint abundance and reading frame fidelity in a coordinated manner (Spearman's R = 0.855, Figure 2 (b)). This result suggests that the 5 end codonassociated ribosomal pausing is coupled with reading frame fidelity.",

            "text": "Preference from Sequencing Bias. We previously attributed the elevated ribosome density at the +12 nt position after the AUG start codon to the peptide tunnel within the ribosome [33] . However, the increased read peak also emerges at the same position after internal AUG codons, including the last AUG ( Figure 2 (c)). Therefore, this feature is unlikely due to the initiation event. Indeed, we observed the same 5 end codon preference after excluding the first 30 nt of CDS ( Figure S2B ). For many deep sequencing results, the 5 end of reads is subject to technical bias [34] . The commonly found A/T enrichment at the 5 end of reads in Ribo-seq and RNA-seq is possibly due to unequal ligation during library construction [35] . Therefore, it is possible that the overrepresentation of AUG codon at the 5 end of RPFs is a result of sequencing bias. To uncover true footprint features masked by sequencing bias, we took several independent approaches to characterizing RPFs. First, we compared ribosome profiling and RNA-seq data sets generated using the same protocol from the same cells. Indeed, RNA-seq reads exhibit an obvious A/T enrichment for the first nucleotide ( Figure S2C ). However, our Ribo-seq reads mainly start with A, but not T. Despite the common A preference for the 5 end nucleotide, RNA-seq reads exhibit poor correlation between read abundance and IFR for their 5 end codons. Therefore, although some ribosome footprints could be inflated as a result of sequencing bias, they must originally dwell in the right reading frame. Second, the high IFR values associated with certain RPFs could also be seen in the absence of cycloheximide (CHX) ( Figure S2A ), excluding the possible side effect of translation inhibitors by altering ribosomal Research 5 conformations [36] . Third, we stratified RPFs based on read length and found the consistent pattern of IFR and codon coverage ( Figure S3A ). Thus, the 5 end bears reliable information in inferring ribosome positions and reading frames. Fourth, we reanalyzed a series of ribosome profiling data sets published previously by different research groups [37] . Despite the varying data quality and using different species, RPFs with certain 5 end codons are well separated in terms of IFR values ( Figure S3B ). In particular, the AUG codon clearly stands out with prominent read density and reading frame fidelity.",

Since 5P-seq also involves the ligation step, a similar A/T bias is found at the 5 end of 5P-seq reads ( Figure S4C ). Notably, 5P-seq revealed a shifted 5 end position compared to Ribo-seq ( Figure S4B ). Only after a 4 nt adjustment, could we observe the prominence of AUG in both IFR and read abundance ( Figure S4D ). Since the virtual 5 end is not part of the sequencing reads in 5P-seq, this result affirms that the 5 end codon preference observed in ribosome footprints is not a result of experimental aberrations. Additionally, we observed a positive correlation between Ribo-seq and 5P-seq results in both 5 end codon coverage and in-frame rate ( Figure S4E ).",

A previous study using UV crosslinking reported extensive interaction between the small subunit 40S and the bound mRNA [39] . In particular, the 3 -terminal of 18S rRNA crosslinked to mRNA positions of -8 to -11 nt (relative to the +1 of the P-site), which corresponds to the 5 end of ribosome footprints. Given the highly conserved 3 -terminal sequence of 18S rRNA among all eukaryotic species ( Figure S5A ), we hypothesize that the AUG-like codons of mRNAs interact with the 3 -proximal CAU triplet of 18S rRNA, thereby retaining the translating ribosome. Supporting this notion, an elevated read density appears unanimously at the +12 nt position following the start site as well as internal AUG codons (Figure 2(c) ). Given the 12 nt offset between the mapped P-site and the 5 end, it is likely that the ribosome pauses whenever the AUG codon reaches the mRNA exit site of the ribosome after decoding. Notably, the same feature is also evident for other AUG-like codons, such as AUC, but not non-AUG codons like GUC ( Figure S5B ). We termed these AUG-like codons of mRNA as \"sticky\" sequences as they tend to retain the ribosome during elongation (Figure 3(a) ).",

It is expected that the first event of such interaction occurs when the ribosome decodes the 5th codon, where the tail of 18S rRNA reaches the start codon AUG (Figure 3(b) ). Intriguingly, we found that the +12 nt ribosomal pausing was far from uniform, suggesting that other factors may influence the putative mRNA:rRNA interaction, such as mRNA folding, modification, or ribosome stacking. We classified all the transcripts into two groups depending on whether the +12 nt peak is above or below the average ribosome density. For messages without +12 nt ribosomal pausing, the downstream region showed a surprisingly lower average IFR value than the first 3 codons. Notably, the downstream IFR was gradually restored to the average level (Figure 3(b) , right panel). However, it is possible that these transcripts contain overlapping out-of-frame ORFs in the 5 -proximal region. We next compared the regional IFR before and after internal \"sticky\" or \"non-sticky\" codons. When transcripts were aligned to the second AUG (first internal AUG) codon, we observed a modest increase of IFR values averaged from the downstream region relative to the upstream (Figure 3(c) , top panel). This feature was not seen when transcripts were aligned to the first GGC codon. We speculate that the putative mRNA:rRNA interaction during elongation helps maintain the reading frame fidelity in downstream coding regions.",

To demonstrate whether the internal mRNA:rRNA pairing could potentially adjust outof-frame translation, we attempted to induce out-of-frame translation by incubating HEK293 cells in a culture medium devoid of methionine. As expected, methionine starvation potently suppressed AUG-initiated translation and gave rise to footprints with mixed reading frames ( Figure S6A and S6B), presumably due to non-AUG translation of upstream and downstream ORFs. To our surprise, in the absence of methionine, there was an outstanding ribosome pausing at the +12 nt position following the start codon as well as internal AUG codons (Figure 3 (c) and Figure S6B ). Despite the poor IFR in regions before the internal AUG, a prominent ribosome pause at this \"sticky\" codon resulted in a much improved IFR with an increase of 17% (Figure 3 (c), bottom panel). By contrast, when a typical \"non-sticky\" codon GGC was chosen to align the messages, we observed a decreased IFR value for the downstream region (Figure 3(d) ). Collectively, these results support the notion that mRNA:rRNA pairing during translation helps retain the ribosome in the reading frame originally set by the AUG start codon.",

To experimentally dissect the differential effects of \"sticky\" versus \"non-sticky\" sequences on reading frame fidelity, we employed +1 and -1 FS reporters by introducing a 21-mer of extra sequences between flag and Rluc but before the FS insertion site (Figure 4(a) ). Both \"sticky\" and \"nonsticky\" sequences were carefully chosen to avoid AUG and stop codons in all three reading frames. By normalizing to the in-frame control, the Rluc levels in transfected cells represent the extent of corresponding FS events. Notably, the insertion of different amino acids had little effect on Rluc activities, although the presence of \"non-sticky\" sequence slightly lowered the Rluc level in the in-frame control (Figure 4 (a), right panel). However, for the +1 FS reporter containing the \"non-sticky\" sequence, the Rluc level was about 4-fold higher than the \"sticky\" counterpart in both HEK293 and MEF cells. Intriguingly, the marked difference seen in the +1 FS reporter was not observable in the -1 FS reporter. To exclude possible crypt splicing events or hidden promoters generated after insertion of extra sequences, we repeated these experiments by transfection of cells using capped mRNAs synthesized in vitro. We obtained nearly identical results in both HEK293 and MEF cells ( Figure S7A ). Our data indicate that the lack of \"sticky\" codons along the coding region triggers high frequency of +1 FS events, but not -1 FS. This is in line with the model that mRNA:rRNA pairing serves as a \"brake\" at the outside of the mRNA tunnel to prevent overmovement of the message during translocation.",

Constructs with frame 0 \"sticky\" insert were used as control. For the +1 FS reporter, we observed negligible difference of Rluc levels in transfected cells regardless of the frames the \"sticky\" sequence residing in Figure 4(b) . However, for the -1 FS reporter, we observed greater than 2-fold Rluc activities in transfected cells when the \"sticky\" insert was relocated from frame 0 to frame 2. Once again, mRNA transfection gave rise to the similar results, confirming the reading frame-specific effects of \"sticky\" sequence in driving frameshifting ( Figure  S7B ). The finding that frame 2 \"sticky\" sequence is easier to induce FS than the same sequence in frame 1 is surprising but consistent with the \"gripping\" model of mRNA movement imposed by mRNA:rRNA pairing (Figure 4(c) ). When the AUG-like codons are present in frame 1, mRNA:rRNA pairing is less favorable than the one bearing \"sticky\" codons in frame 2 ( Figure S8 ).

Instead, we used a previously described 18S rRNA expression system that has been shown to be able to incorporate the exogenously expressed 18S rRNA into \u223c15% of 40S subunits in transfected cells [40] . To change the base pairing between 18S rRNA and mRNA, we mutated the 3 terminal CAU triplet of 18S rRNA into GCC ( Figure 5(a) ). The resultant 18S(GCC) mutant is expected to establish new base pairing with mRNA codons like GGC, one of the typical \"non-sticky\" codons for wild type 18S rRNA. Therefore, global changes of codon \"stickiness\" in the presence of 18S(GCC) mutant will help us validate the critical role of mRNA:rRNA pairing in translation fidelity.",

We examined the abundance of RPFs with specific codons at the P-site or the 5 end (Table S3) .

The postdecoding mRNA:rRNA interaction plays an unexpected role in reading frame fidelity and exerts a surprising reading frame-specificity. For instance, mRNA:rRNA pairing only prevents +1 FS but not -1 FS (Figure 4(a) ). In addition, the \"sticky\" sequence is rather safe in frame 1 because it does not induce +1 frameshifting errors (Figure 4(b) ). Since \"sticky\" codons, when present in frame 2, promote -1 FS by potentially reengaging ribosomes, we reasoned that AUG-like codons must be avoided in frame 2 during evolution to minimize spontaneous FS errors. We computed the codon composition in different reading frames for the entire coding region of human genome (Figure 6(a) ). Intriguingly, nearly all of the ATG-like codons are kept at minimal levels in frame 2 with the ATG itself the lowest. To exclude the possibility that the codon preference in frame 2 is a result of codon selection in frame 0, we randomized whole codons while maintaining the original amino acid sequence. Remarkably, ATG and GGC codons in frame 2 of randomized sequences are clearly deviated from the same codons in human CDS ( Figure S10A ). Similar results were obtained after dinucleotide randomization. Therefore, the codon preference in frame 2 is not a consequence of codon bias that existed in frame 0. Additionally, the asymmetric distribution of \"sticky\" codons among reading frames is highly conserved across different eukaryotic genomes ( Figure  S10B ). These results clearly indicate that there is a universal trend of selection for low frequency of \"sticky\" codons in frame 2. As a typical example, the -actin gene ACTB showed very few \"sticky\" codons in frame 2 and displayed constant ribosome occupancy along the coding region ( Figure 6(b) ). Interestingly, the distribution of \"sticky\" codons among the reading frames of OAZ1 is not uniform (Figure 6(c) ). The stop codon of OAZ1, serving as the +1 PRF site, appears to be a dividing point for \"sticky\" codon composition in frame 2. Since frame 2 becomes frame 1 after +1 PRF, this result supports the view that codon optimization is highly coordinated between general coding regions and specific PRF signals.",

            "text": "Maintaining reading frame fidelity during mRNA translation is a cellular imperative. In general, frameshift errors are more deleterious than missense errors in protein production. While amino acid mis-incorporation is primarily monitored in the decoding center via sampling tRNAs, mechanisms controlling the step size of translocation are poorly understood. The accuracy of decoding itself, however, is insufficient to account for the high degree of reading frame fidelity in translation of long messages. For the ribosome to adhere to the correct reading frame during the entire course of translation, a retrospective fidelity check by the ribosome after translocation seems to be critical. Interestingly, in bacteria, the internal SD:anti-SD interaction is able to reposition the ribosome from frame 0 to frame 1, thereby causing +1 PRF. This feature is well documented in the prfB gene and is essential for the synthesis of full length release factor 2 (RF2) [41, 42] . Although other factors are essential in this PRF, this phenomenon suggests that mRNA:rRNA pairing plays a role in controlling translational reading frames. Analogous to prokaryotic SD:anti-SD duplex formation, eukaryotic mRNA:rRNA pairing has been reported to play a role in noncanonical translation initiation [43, 44] , as well as reinitiation [45] . However, the physiological significance of mRNA:rRNA interaction during elongation remained elusive. We found that the feature of mRNA:rRNA pairing plays a similar role in eukaryotic translation. Importantly, it provides a postdecoding \"gripping\" mechanism to prevent overmovement of mRNA during translocation. This notion is supported by several lines of evidence. First, the FS reporter assay showed greater than 4-fold higher frameshift errors when the mRNA:rRNA interaction is disrupted by replacing the \"sticky\" codons with the \"non-sticky\" sequence. Second, we observed a high frequency of -1 FS when the \"sticky\" sequence was relocated from frame 0 to frame 2. Third, codon composition analysis revealed that \"sticky\" codons are generally avoided in frame 2 for the majority of genes, suggesting a strong selection for codon optimization. Fourth, for genes experiencing PRF (such as OAZ1), the \"sticky\" codons are clearly redistributed among different reading frames. Although the functional purpose of individual cases may differ, the advantage associated with mRNA:rRNA pairing offers a clear mechanistic view of reading frame maintenance during translation.",

While the former ensures proper mRNA decoding via tRNA sampling, the latter secures the correct reading frame via a gripping mechanism. Unlike the continuous codon:anti-codon pairing, the appearance of \"sticky\" codons along the primary reading frame is periodic because the majority of 61 sense codons are \"non-sticky\" (Figure 6(a) ). How does the periodic mRNA:rRNA interaction contribute to continuous reading frame precision? We reasoned that the frame-specific effect of \"sticky\" codons offers an autocorrecting mechanism to achieve retrospective fidelity control. For instance, once the \"non-sticky\" codons reach the exit site of the mRNA path, the lack of mRNA grip may cause a higher chance of +1 FS (Figure 4(a) ). However, the recurrence of the next \"sticky\" codons in frame 0 (now becomes frame 2 after +1 FS) has the potential to induce -1 FS (Figure 4(b) ), which ultimately cancels the original +1 FS. Therefore, the periodic presence of \"sticky\" codons is able to maintain reading frame accuracy via self-guard and autocorrection. The remarkable reading frame fidelity is well reflected by the fact that the majority of transcripts have minimal ribosome drop-off during translation (Figure 1(c) ).",

For any given transcript, it is the position of the start codon that defines the corresponding open reading frame. Despite the codon degeneracy, it is puzzling that the start codon AUG is shared with the internal methionine codon. Since the AUG codon is complementary to the CAU triplet at the 3 end of 18S rRNA, it is tempting to speculate that its \"stickiness\" helps retain the translation machinery in the reading frame originally set by AUG. Robustness to frameshift errors is likely an inherent constraint on the early genetic code. As a result, selection of AUG as a start codon lowers the fitness cost by minimizing frameshifting errors. Notably, recent development of initiating ribosome profiling in eukaryotes revealed prevalence of non-AUG start codons in eukaryotes [32, 46, 47] . Notably, the majority of those non-canonical initiators belong to AUG-like codons, which bear similar \"stickiness\" as AUG in mediating mRNA:rRNA pairing. Additionally, the highly conserved 3 end of 18S rRNA has been found to be heavily modified in both precursor and mature forms [48] . The critical role of differential nucleotide modification in mRNA:rRNA interaction awaits further investigation. It is possible that the ribosome serves as a molecular selector by employing mRNA:rRNA interaction to shape the evolution of the start codon as well as codon optimization in the coding region.",

Purified RNA samples were dephosphorylated in a 15 L reaction containing 1\u00d7 T4 polynucleotide kinase buffer, 10 U SUPERase In, and 20 U T4 polynucleotide kinase (NEB). Dephosphorylation was carried out for 1 h at 37 \u2218 C, and the enzyme was then heat inactivated for 20 min at 65 \u2218 C. Dephosphorylated samples were then mixed with 2\u00d7 Novex TBE-urea sample buffer (Invitrogen) and loaded on a Novex denaturing 15% polyacrylamide TBE-urea gel (Invitrogen). The gel was stained with SYBR Gold (Invitrogen) to visualize the RNA fragments. Gel bands containing RNA species corresponding to 28 nt were excised and physically disrupted by using centrifugation through the holes of the tube. RNA fragments were dissolved by soaking overnight in gel elution buffer (300 mM NaOAc, pH 5.5, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1 U/ L SUPERase In). The gel debris was removed using a Spin-X column (Corning) and RNA was purified by using ethanol precipitation. Purified RNA fragments were resuspended in 10 mM Tris (pH 8) and denatured briefly at 65 \u2218 C for 30 s. Poly-(A) tailing reaction was performed in an 8 L with 1 \u00d7 poly-(A) polymerase buffer, 1 mM ATP, 0.75 U/ L SUPERase In, and 3 U E. coli poly-(A) polymerase (NEB). Tailing was carried out for 45 min at 37 \u2218 C. For reverse transcription, the following oligos containing barcodes were synthesized: MCA02, 5 -pCAGATCGTCGGACTGTAGAACTCT\u00d8-",
