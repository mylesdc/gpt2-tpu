HACE1 has been characterized as an important tumor suppressor. Here, we identified HACE1 as an important negative regulator of virus-triggered type I IFN signaling. Overexpression of HACE1 inhibited Sendai virus-or poly (I:C)-induced signaling and resulted in reduced IFNB1 production and enhanced virus replication. Knockdown of HACE1 expression exhibited the opposite effects. Ubiquitin E3 ligase activity of the dead mutant HACE1/C876A had a comparable inhibitory function as WT HACE1, suggesting that the suppressive function of HACE1 on virus-induced signaling is independent of its E3 ligase activity. Further study indicated that HACE1 acted downstream of MAVS and upstream of TBK1. Mechanistic studies showed that HACE1 exerts its inhibitory role on virus-induced signaling by disrupting the MAVS-TRAF3 complex. Therefore, we uncovered a novel function of HACE1 in innate immunity regulation.",

Aberrant overreaction may lead to proinflammatory diseases. Therefore, the intensity and duration of the signaling are finely modulated at multiple steps of the signaling cascades [5, 6] . In recent years, we have had great interest in the identification of the essential regulators in this signaling pathway.

All three RLRs possess a DEXD-box RNA helicase domain for RNA binding [9] . Except LGP2, both RIG-I and MDA5 also contain a caspase recruitment domain (CARD) that is indispensable for downstream protein-protein interactions. Upon viral infection, the activated RIG-I undergoes self-dimerization and structural changes that permit the CARD domain of RIG-I to interact with the CARD domain of downstream essential adaptor protein MAVS (also known as IPS-1/Cardif/VISA) [10] [11] [12] [13] . MAVS has a transmembrane domain (TM), that guides it to the outer mitochondrial membrane. Besides, MAVS contains three TRAF-interacting motifs (TIM), two included in the N-terminal proline-rich region (Pro), the other one located in the C-terminal region [11, 13] . Upon RNA virus infection, the downstream tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factors (TRAFs) are recruited to MAVS, and the MAVS complex is formed [11, 14] . This is a crucial step to initiate type I IFN signaling. TRAF2, 3, 5 and 6 are all MAVS binding partners through different TIM. The MAVS-TRAF3 complex provides the essential platform for downstream TBK1-dependent IRF3 or IRF7 activation. TRAF3 bridges the upstream MAVS and downstream kinase TBK1 and assembles the active MAVS-TRAF3-TBK1 signaling complex [14, 15] . Therefore, the regulation on the MAVS-TRAF3 signalosome may be very important for the pathway.",

            "text": "HACE1 (HECT domain and ankyrin repeat-containing E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 1) is a HECT-type ubiquitin E3 ligase. The functions of HACE1 have not been fully understood. Until now, the identified ubiquitinated substrates of HACE1 include active Rac1 [16, 17] , optineurin (OPTN) [18] and Rab GTPases [19] . The catalytic cysteine (C876) of HACE1 is essential for its E3 ligase activity [16, 20, 21] . Mutation of C876 to serine or alanine will abolish its E3 ligase activity. HACE1 gene is located on chromosome 6q21, a prominent tumor-suppressor region [20, 22] . The tumor suppressive function of HACE1 is also characterized. HACE1 is downregulated in multiple cancer types due to allelic loss or promoter methylation, such as Wilms' tumor, gastric cancer, lymphoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, breast cancer, neuroblastoma, advanced colorectal cancer, etc. [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] . HACE1-deficient mice developed spontaneous, late-onset cancer [20] . Re-expression of HACE1 in human tumor cells directly abrogates in vitro and in vivo tumor growth, which is dependent on its E3 ligase activity. The mechanical analysis for its growth control shows that HACE1 modulates the expression level of cyclin D1, then reducing cell cycle progression [20] . Moreover, in breast cancer, HACE1 ubiquitinates and promotes the degradation of Rac1, then leading to impaired Rac signaling [29] . In contrast, HACE1 deficiency results in enhanced Rac1 signaling, contributing to breast cancer progression [29] [30] [31] . In lung cancer, HACE1 ubiquitinates OPTN and targets it for autophagic degradation. The HACE1-OPTN axis synergistically suppresses the growth and tumorigenicity of lung cancer cells [18] . Moreover, HACE1 is also involved in other biological processes or pathological conditions. For example, HACE1 mediates resistance to oxidative stress [32] . HACE1 regulates Golgi membrane fusion in cells [33] . It has protective roles in the pathology of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Huntington disease [32] . It also provides cardiac protection in response to hemodynamic stress [34] . However, the functions of HACE1 in immune responses are not investigated.",

The HECT domain containing ubiquitin ligase AIP4 can ubiquitinate and degrade MAVS in collaboration with PCBP2 [37] . Our group previously showed that Smurf2 promotes the ubiquitination and degradation of MAVS, as well [35] .

Then, we tried to systematically investigate whether HACE1 is indeed involved in the regulation of virus-induced IFN signaling. As shown in Figure 1A , overexpression of HACE1 inhibited SeV-induced activation of both ISRE (an interferon stimulated response element) and IFN-\u03b2 promoter in a dose-dependent manner in HEK293T cells.

In all tests, p-values of less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. By a small-scale screening of unknown ubiquitin E3 ligases in the regulation of virus-induced type I IFN signaling by the dual-luciferase reporter, we identified HACE1 as a potential negative regulator in this pathway. Then, we tried to systematically investigate whether HACE1 is indeed involved in the regulation of virus-induced IFN signaling. As shown in Figure 1A , overexpression of HACE1 inhibited SeV-induced activation of both ISRE (an interferon stimulated response element) and IFN-\u03b2 promoter in a dose-dependent manner in HEK293T cells.

Then, we tried to determine whether the E3 ligase activity of HACE1 is required for the inhibition of virus-induced type I IFN signaling. It is well-known that the catalytic cysteine (C876) of HACE1 is indispensable for its E3 ligase activity [20] . Therefore, we constructed a mutant HACE1 in which the amino acid cysteine 876 was mutated into alanine ( Figure 3A) . Consistent with the previous report, WT HACE1 can promote the degradation of Rac1, whereas the HACE1/C876A mutant lost the ability to degrade Rac1, indicating the lost E3 ligase activity of HACE1/C876A ( Figure 3B ). Reporter assays showed that SeV-induced or poly (I:C)-induced activation of ISRE and IFN-\u03b2 promoter activities were inhibited by HACE1/C876A to a similar degree as WT HACE1 (Figure 3C,D) . These data indicate that HACE1 inhibits virus-induced type I IFN induction independently of its E3 ligase activity. ",

Unexpectedly, HACE1 cannot interact with either MAVS or TBK1. It interacted with TRAF3 ( Figure 5A ,B). HACE1 is a HECT ubiquitin E3 ligase. Then, we tested whether HACE1 can promote the degradation of TRAF3. As shown in Figure 5C , HACE1 cannot degrade TRAF3. This is consistent with the results above ( Figure 3C ,D) that the HACE1/C876A mutant has a comparable inhibitory function to WT HACE1 on virus-induced signaling.",

Co-immunoprecipitation assays showed that HACE1 did not interact with MAVS or TBK1. Unexpectedly, it binds TRAF3, which interacts with MAVS and forms a platform for RNA virus signaling. HACE1 does not promote the degradation of TRAF3. This is consistent with the data that HACE1 negatively regulates the virus-induced signaling independent of the E3 ligase activity.

HACE1 can also function in an E3 ligase independent manner. For example, HACE1 can repress the transcriptional activity of RAR\u03b11 and RAR\u03b23. Mutation of the putative catalytic cysteine (C876) does not alter the repressive effect of HACE1 on the transcriptional activity of RAR\u03b23 [21] . HACE1 can mediate p62-dependent selective autophagic turnover of ubiquitinated proteins. This process is achieved by protein-protein interaction through its ankyrin repeat domain and is independent of its E3 ligase activity [34] . Under stress conditions, HACE1 cleared the ubiquitinated proteins in an E3 ligase activity independent manner. Here, we demonstrated that HACE1 suppressed virus-induced signaling independently of its E3 ligase activity, suggesting that HACE1 exerts diverse biological functions by different mechanisms.",

Herpes simplex virus 1 ubiquitin-specific protease UL36 deubiquitinates TRAF3 [41] . A few SARS coronavirus proteins are identified as viral negative regulators, which target the TRAF3 signalosome [42] . SARS coronavirus papain-like protease binds and disrupts the STING-TRAF3-TBK1 complex [43] . SARS coronavirus M protein or open-reading frame-9b impedes the formation of the TRAF3/TANK/TBK1/IKK\u03b5 complex or the MAVS/TRAF3/TRAF6 complex, respectively [44] . Besides, some studies reported endogenous physiological negative regulators that target TRAF3 or the MAVS-TRAF3 complex. The linear ubiquitin assembly complex (LUBAC) downregulates virus-mediated IFN induction by targeting NEMO for linear ubiquitination. Then, linear ubiquitinated NEMO is associated with TRAF3 and disrupts the MAVS-TRAF3 complex, which inhibits IFN activation [45] . MIP-T3, a ciliary protein, is also a TRAF3 binding protein, which acts as a cellular inhibitor in virus-induced IFN production. MIP-T3 impedes the formation of multiple TRAF3 signaling complex, such as the MAVS-TRAF3 complex, the TRAF3-TBK1 or TRAF3-IKK\u03b5 complex [46] . The ubiquitin E3 ligase Triad3A targets TRAF3 for degradation to negatively regulate the RIG-I signaling [47] .
