            "text": "There is consistent evidence that particulate matter (PM) with an aerodynamic diameter < 10 \u03bcm or 2.5 \u03bcm (PM 10 or PM 2.5 , respectively) is adversely associated with respiratory morbidity and mortality (Alfaro-Moreno et al. 2007; Health Effects Institute 2003; Pope and Dockery 2006) . Some findings suggest that associations are stronger for finer than for coarser particles (Kan et al. 2007; Peng et al. 2008; Wichmann et al. 2000) and that there are qualitative differences between the health effects of different particle size fractions (Samuelsen et al. 2009 ). Physicochemical parameters such as size, shape, distribution, number, and volume of airborne particles determine the potential to induce inflammatory injury, oxidative damage, and other biological effects, which are all stronger for smaller-size fractions of particles (Oberd\u00f6rster et al. 2005; Valavanidis et al. 2008) . Ultrafine particles (UFP; particles with a diameter < 100 nm) may contribute more than other particle size fractions to the observed health effects, because they dominate total particle number and surface area concentrations and have a high deposition efficiency in the pulmonary region (Delfino et al. 2005; Frampton 2001; Wichmann 2007) .",

            "text": "Because of the limited availability of measurement data, few epidemiologic studies have investigated associations between particle number concentrations in different size ranges and daily respiratory morbidity or mortality, and their findings have been inconsistent. Wichmann et al. (2000) reported in a study conducted in Erfurt, Germany, with a population of approximately 200,000, that associations with total mortality were comparable for an interquartile range (IQR) increase in UFP [relative risk (RR) = 4.1%; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.1-8.2] and PM 2.5 (RR = 4.9%; 95% CI,1.1-8.8), whereas causespecific mortality showed a somewhat stronger association with respiratory diseases compared with cardiovascular diseases and other causes. Peters et al. (1997) reported that inverse associations with peak expiratory flow (PEF) in asthmatic patients were stronger for an IQR increase in particle number concentrations of UFP than mass concentrations of fine particles (aerodynamic diameter 0.1-0.5 \u03bcm). Penttinen et al. (2001) reported that daily mean particle number concentrations, but not particle mass concentrations, were negatively associated with daily PEF deviations in adult asthmatics, whereas the strongest associations were found with particles in the ultrafine range. In a study conducted in Copenhagen, Denmark, Andersen et al. (2008) reported associations between pediatric asthma hospital admissions and IQR increases in accumulation-mode particles (0.1-1 \u03bcm), UFP (< 0.1 \u03bcm), and nitrogen oxide (NO x ) concentrations.",

To combine both measurements, APS data were transformed from aerodynamic diameter to Stokes diameter assuming an effective particle density of 1.7 g/cm 3 for the particles > 800 nm, because these particles are dominated by sulfate and crustal material in Beijing (Yao et al. 2003) . A low-flow PM 10 inlet was used to minimize contamination by large dust particles. The ambient aerosol was dried in a diffusion drier before entering the air-conditioned laboratory to avoid condensation of water in the inlet systems during warm and humid days in summertime. The data were corrected for losses due to diffusion and sedimentation within the inlet line. Size-dependent losses for the TDMPS inlet line were estimated using empirical particle loss corrections (diffusion and gravitation) from Willeke and Baron (1993) . Losses of 4-nm and 10-nm particles were estimated to be 35% and approximately 10%, respectively.",

A database was built on the basis of these files, and respiratory clinical end points were coded according to the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) [World Health Organization (WHO) 1993] for respiratory diseases (ICD-10 codes J00-J99). Total respiratory ERV comprise acute upper respiratory infections (J00-J06), pneumonia (J18), acute bronchitis (J20), other diseases of the upper respiratory tract (J30-J39), and chronic lower respiratory diseases (J40-J47). In addition, location of permanent residence was recorded for each case; based on this information, only patients from Haidian district were considered for further analysis. Because of an outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome in China in 2003, all patients with body temperature > 38\u00b0C were separately treated in the hospital, and these cases were excluded. Assignment of the diagnoses to ICD-10 disease categories were qualityassured by a nosological expert from the Third Hospital, resulting in a good agreement, as the percentage of misclassification was about 4%.",

We applied a time-series analysis using generalized additive Poisson regression models (Hastie and Tibshirani 1987) to estimate associations between air pollutants and respiratory ERV. In the first step, a base model without pollutants was built for identifying pollutantindependent variability. Long-term trends and seasonality were represented by a smooth function of calendar time, and a categorical variable for day of the week was forced into the model as hospital emergency room admissions showed weekly and yearly patterns. As further potential confounders, we considered the meteorologic parameters air temperature, air pressure, and relative humidity. We accounted for time-delayed effects of these variables using arithmetic means for days up to 7 days before the visit. Additional influences of the year, season (December-February, March-May, June-August, September-November), month, day of the month and holiday, represented by categorical variables were investigated as well. The base model was selected according to Akaike's information criterion (Akaike 1974) and statistical significance of the covariates (p < 0.05). Nonlinear effects were modeled by regression splines with an automatic smoothness selection (Wood 2006) . The smoothness of the trend function was manually adjusted based on the absolute value of the sum of the partial autocorrelation function (Touloumi et al. 2006) . The final base model consisted of the categorical variables holiday, weekend, and season, the linear influence of same-day relative air humidity, and the smooth functions of calendar time, air temperature, represented by the mean of the present and two previous days, and same-day air pressure.",

Traffic-related air pollution has been associated with respiratory diseases in several studies (Brunekreef et al. 2009 ). In our two-pollutant models, associations with NO 2 were most consistent. When controlling for NO 2 , associations with 100-300 nm stayed moderately significant (p < 0.09). A pollutant that exhibits a relatively strong association in a multipollutant model may be acting as a surrogate for an unmeasured or poorly measured pollutant (Peel et al. 2005 ). In addition, associations with pollutants based on single-pollutant models may be attributable to an association with another pollutant that is correlated with the measured pollutant. Typically, epidemiologic studies (including ours) cannot verify to what extent associations with NO 2 are attributable to NO 2 itself or to other pollutants correlated with NO 2 . Therefore, we cannot rule out the possibility that observed associations for NO 2 were due to NO 2 -correlated air pollution.",

Measurements from only one station were used for the particle size distribution data, and we were not able to assess spatial variation in particle number concentrations. Our measurement site may be considered as an urban background station because of its location (20 m height and > 500 m from a major road). Average particle number size distributions at a PKU measurement site and another regional measurement site, located approximately 50 km south of the PKU, were similar (Yue et al. 2009 ), confirming that our measurement site may be considered as an urban background station. In Beijing, concentrations of fine PM (PM 2.5 and PM 10 ) are evenly distributed over the urban area, including the Haidian district (Cheng et al. 2007; Wang et al. 2009 ). In urban areas, differences of absolute particle number concentrations between different measurement sites can be great (Krudysz et al. 2009 ), with the largest variations in ultrafine (< 100 nm) and coarse (2,500-10,000 nm) particles and more homogenous spatial distributions of accumulation mode particles (100-2,000 nm) (Monn 2001) . The low correlation between NO 2 -as an urban average, representing traffic exhaust levels and the main source of UFP-and UFP might suggest low correlation between UFP at the measurement site and UFP levels elsewhere in the city. On the other hand, moderate correlations between UFP and NO 2 were observed for subgroups, for example, seasons or particle subfractions of UFP. Personal levels of UFP can differ substantially, such as in proximity to traffic (Kaminsky et al. 2009 ). However, Buzorius et al. (1999) , Cyrys et al. (2008) , and Puustinen et al. (2007) showed that daily temporal correlations of particle number concentration time series between different monitoring sites are high. The authors concluded that using one carefully chosen monitoring site is a reasonable approach to characterize exposure of particle number concentrations in epidemiologic time-series studies. When associations are estimated by Poisson regression model in time-series studies, Lipfert and Wyzga (1995) argued that exposure misclassification will reduce the precision of effect estimates, resulting in wider CIs, but will not bias estimates. On the other hand, bias away from the null can occur in time-series studies of multiple pollutants, such as this one, when measurement errors of different pollutants are correlated (Zeger et al. 2000) .",
