            "text": "Severe influenza is characterized by a cytokine storm, and the influenza virus-cytokine-trypsin cycle is one of the important mechanisms of viral multiplication and multiple organ failure. The aim of this study was to define the key cytokine(s) responsible for trypsin upregulation. Mice were infected with influenza virus strain A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) or treated individually or with a combination of interleukin-1b, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor a. The levels of these cytokines and trypsin in the lungs were monitored. The neutralizing effects of anti-IL-1b antibodies on cytokine and trypsin expression in human A549 cells and lung inflammation in the infected mice were examined. Infection induced interleukin-1b, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor a, and ectopic trypsin in mouse lungs in a dose-and time-dependent manner. Intraperitoneal administration of interleukin-1b combined with other cytokines tended to upregulate trypsin and cytokine expression in the lungs, but the combination without interleukin-1b did not induce trypsin. In contrast, incubation of A549 cells with interleukin-1b alone induced both cytokines and trypsin, and anti-interleukin-1b antibody treatment abrogated these effects. Administration of the antibody in the infected mice reduced lung inflammation area. These findings suggest that IL-1b plays a key role in trypsin upregulation and has a pathological role in multiple organ failure.",

            "text": "Multiple organ failure with vascular hyperpermeability is a common cause of death in severe seasonal and highly pathogenic influenza A virus infection. The condition is usually associated with hypercytokinemia and severe edema in the lung, heart, liver, kidneys and brain [1, 2] . In our previous studies, we proposed the hypothesis of an ''influenza-cytokine-trypsin'' cycle as one of the key mechanisms of vascular hyperpermeability and multiple organ failure in severe influenza [3] [4] [5] [6] . In the process of influenza A virus entry into the cell, proteolytic conversion of the viral envelope fusion glycoprotein hemagglutinin (HA 0 ) into HA1 and HA2 subunits by host cellular trypsintype proteases is a pre-requisite for membrane fusion activity [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] because HA-processing protease is not encoded in the viral genome. Once viral infection ensues, ectopic pancreatic trypsin, which is one of the cellular HAprocessing proteases and is expressed in limited amounts in various organs, such as the lungs, heart and brain, is markedly upregulated through the induction of proinflammatory cytokines [3] [4] [5] [6] 9] . The upregulated trypsin potentiates viral multiplication in various organs, leading to cellular dysfunction, vascular hyperpermeability and fluid imbalance through proteinase-activated receptor-2 (PAR-2) [4, [11] [12] [13] and tissue damage [14, 15] with the involvement of matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) [10, 16, 17] . Trypsin is also reported to be crucial for infectivity of other viruses, such as rotaviruses, members of the family Reoviridae, and coronaviruses, members of the family Coronaviridae [18, 19] , in addition to influenza A virus, a member of the family Orthomyxoviridae, and Sendai virus and Newcastle disease virus, members of the family Paramyxoviridae.",

Trypsin levels were not significantly increased following the administration of each cytokine but tended to increase following administration of IL-1b combined with IL-6 and/ or TNF-a.

In the lungs of infected mice treated with anti-IL-1b neutralizing polyclonal antibodies, however, the distribution and accumulation of inflammatory cells in the lungs were restricted. The hypercellular areas with inflammatory cell infiltration shown in red and the hypocellular areas shown in green were then quantified in the whole lung area (Fig. 7B) . Histological quantification of the hypercellular area showed that anti-IL-1b neutralizing antibody treatment significantly suppressed the development of inflammatory cell aggregation when compared to the saline and control mouse IgG groups.",

            "text": "In the present study, we made several new observations: 1) among the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1b, IL-6 and TNF-a, which are induced in the early phase of PR8 infection, IL-1b plays a key role in trypsin upregulation in mouse lungs and human alveolar A549 cells. 2) IL-1b in combination with IL-6 and/or TNF-a effectively upregulated trypsin in mouse lungs, but the combination of cytokines without IL-1b did not. 3) IL-1b upregulated trypsin mRNAs (PRSS1, PRSS2, and PRSS3) equally in A549 cells in the presence of IL-1b, IL-6 and TNF-a. 4) Anti-IL-1b antibody neutralized IL-1b and efficiently suppressed the upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and trypsin in A549 cells and also suppressed the development of inflammatory cell aggregation in the lungs of infected mice. We reported previously that influenza A virus infection resulted in significant increases the levels of in IL-1b, IL-6, TNF-a, the viral hemagglutinin processing protease ectopic trypsin, and viral replication in the lungs of the host animal [3] . Upregulation of trypsin induces [Ca 2? ] i mobilization via activation of PAR-2, followed by the loss of the intracellular tight junction protein zonula occludens-1, resulting in vascular hyperpermeability and multiple organ failure [3, 4, 6] . Furthermore, inhibitors of nuclear factorkappa B (NF-jB) and activator protein 1 (AP-1) effectively suppress the upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines and ectopic trypsin and improve the survival rate of infected mice [3] . Based on these results, we proposed the Fig. 6 Suppressive effects of an anti-IL-1b-neutralizing monoclonal antibody on IL-1b-induced upregulation of trypsin and pro-inflammatory cytokines in A549 cells. IL-1b (10 ng/mL) in serum-free medium was reacted with or without anti-IL-1b monoclonal antibody (600 ng/mL) for 30 minutes at 37\u00b0C. These reaction mixtures were added to A549 cells, and the cells were stimulated for 1 hour by incubation at 37\u00b0C. The cells were then washed with PBS(-) and incubated for an additional 8 hours with fresh serum-free medium. After incubation, the mRNA levels of trypsin 1, IL-1b, IL-6, and TNF-a in the cells and the levels of IL-1b and IL-6 in medium were analyzed. *, P \\ 0.05 vs. the untreated group; #, P \\ 0.05 vs. the IL-1b-treated group by Student's t-test IL-1b potentiates trypsin upregulation 207 influenza virus-cytokine-trypsin cycle hypothesis as one of the mechanisms of trypsin upregulation and vascular dysfunction in multiple organ failure with cytokine storm in severe influenza. In this study, our interest was to identify major proinflammatory cytokines that can switch on trypsin upregulation in severe influenza A virus infection. We identified IL-1b as a key cytokine capable of inducing IL-1b, IL-6, TNF-a, and trypsin in mouse lungs and human alveolar A549 cells in the early phase of infection. We used four experiments to provide support for this result. First, we found that intraperitoneal injection of a mixture of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1b, IL-6 and TNF-a) upregulated ectopic trypsin in the lungs, while a cytokine mixture that lacked IL-1b did not (Fig. 3B) . Second, incubation of A549 cells in the presence of IL-1b stimulated IL-1b secretion initially, followed by secretion of IL-6 and TNFa, and finally upregulated trypsin mRNAs in the presence of IL-1b, IL-6 and TNF-a in the culture medium ( Fig. 4  and 5) . Third, neutralization of IL-1b by monoclonal antibody against IL-1b almost completely suppressed such inductions in vitro (Fig. 6) . Lastly, intraperitoneal administration of anti-IL-1b neutralizing polyclonal antibodies efficiently suppressed the development of inflammatory cell aggregation in the lungs of an infected mouse (Fig. 7) .",

Influenza A virus infection upregulates the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1b, followed by IL-6 and TNF-a, with synergistic interaction. Since upregulated trypsin efficiently converts pro-MMPs to active MMPs [16, 39] , induction of trypsin and active MMPs synergistically degrades the vascular basement membrane and extracellular matrix, resulting in tissue damage, edema, and multiple organ failure. In addition, the upregulated trypsin in turn provokes cytokine release [40] , cellular fluid imbalance, and loss of the intracellular tight junction protein zonula occludens-1 [3] via PAR-2 activation. These trypsin-based cascades result in vascular hyperpermeability and multiple organ failure in severe influenza.",

            "text": "Many studies have provided evidence for the therapeutic effects of controlling the balance of IL-1b within certain levels in various diseases by blocking IL-1b receptor or neutralization antibodies [23, [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] . Our in vivo experiment using anti-IL-1b neutralizing antibodies also demonstrated a similar outcome. In addition, our findings regarding the hypothesis illustrated in Figure 8 highlight the important effect of restraining IL-1b-stimulation to avoid trypsin-mediated disease aggravation. Moreover, further studies focusing on IL-1b directed synergic effects of pro-inflammatory cytokines on trypsin upregulation are needed to strengthen our proposed hypothesis. In addition, several hemagglutinin-processing proteases in human airway epithelium other than trypsin, such as TMPRSS2 and HAT, play roles in influenza virus multiplication [48] . We cannot deny the possibility that upregulation of IL-1b and other pro-inflammatory cytokines by infection also induces these processing proteases. Therefore, further studies on the effects of inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1b on these hemagglutinin processing proteases are needed to understand the pathogenesis of multiple organ failure in severe influenza.
