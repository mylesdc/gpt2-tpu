CRFK cells infected with FIPV 79-1146 showed an increase in the expression of interferon-related genes and pro-inflammatory cytokines such as MX1, viperin, CXCL10, CCL8, RANTES, KC, MCP1, and IL8. In addition, an increase in the expression of the above cytokines as well as GM-CSF and IFN\u03b3 was also detected in the PBMC, serum, and peritoneal effusions of FCoV-positive cats. Although the expression of MX1 and viperin genes was variable between cats, the expression of these two genes was relatively higher in cats having peritoneal effusion compared to cats without clinically obvious effusion. Higher viral load was also detected in the supernatant of peritoneal effusions compared to in the plasma of FCoV-positive cats. As expected, the secretion of IL1\u03b2, IL6 and TNF\u03b1 was readily detected in the supernatant of peritoneal effusions of the FCoV-positive cats.",

The widely accepted 'internal mutation' theory describes that mutations in FECV give rise to FIP de novo. In addition, it was suggested that these mutations occur in the monocytes, rather than the intestinal epithelial cells where the FECV first enters the host [3, 4] . FCoV travels to organs and tissues through monocyte-associated viremia where it is later disseminated in the endothelial venules of the serosa, omentum, pleura, meninges and uveal tract (reviewed in [1, 2] ).",

Although it is generally known that FECV causes self-limiting disease, cats can become persistent shedders contributing to the transmission of the disease (reviewed in [1, 2] ). However, only approximately 5% of cats harboring FECV actually develop FIP [1, 8] . The exact nature of this immunity is still unknown although the development of FIP has been postulated to correlate with the magnitude of immune responses, as cats with robust cell-mediated immune (CMI) response have been found to resist the disease [9] . In contrast, humoral response does not seem to be beneficial and could lead to the dissemination of the virus through complement activation via formation of immune complexes and vasculitis associated with type III hypersensitivity (reviewed in [1, 2] ). This would then lead to effusive FIP (wet form), the most commonly reported form of FIP due to the obvious sign of peritoneal effusion. The non-effusive form of FIP is associated with partial CMI response in the individual cat to contain the virus leading to the formation of granulomas containing macrophages, which could then be replaced by B cells and plasma cells [10, 11] .",

However, the observed cytokine patterns are different between asymptomatic FCoV-infected cats and those with clinical signs of FIP [12] . Asymptomatic FCoV-infected cats generally show higher IL10 in the spleen, suggesting the ability to control excessive inflammation triggered by macrophages. Furthermore, lymphocyte depletion has been indicated as one of the hallmarks of FIP and postulated to be induced by excessive production of TNF\u03b1 [13] [14] [15] . In contrast, high IFN \u03b3 and IL 1\u03b2 production has been associated with protection against FIP [16] . Increase in Th1-like cytokines such as IL12/p40 and IFN\u03b3, which were associated with the decrease of IL4 in the lymphoid tissue, has been observed in cats experimentally infected with FIPV [13] . Furthermore, previous studies showed deregulation of different mediators, illustrated by the upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL1\u03b2, IL6, TNF\u03b1, MIP1\u03b1, RANTES, and IFN\u03b3 in peritoneal effusions and serum samples of FIP clinical cases [17] [18] [19] .",

Results revealed that, during the first 3 h of infection, at least 96 transcripts associated with immune responses (e.g. ISGs,  MX1, RSAD2, A3C, ID1, CRIP1, TRIM25 and MDA5),  apoptosis (ID1, ATF3, TNF\u03b1, and RNF7) , and proinflammatory responses (e.g. PD-L1, CCL8, CXCL10 and CCL17) were downregulated. Only a few genes, namely PD-1, PD-L1 and A3H, has been previously characterized in a study on FCoV-infected CRFK cells and expression profiles in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of cats diagnosed with FIP [20] . Characterization of additional immune mediators that modulate innate and acquired immune responses will increase our understanding of their involvement during FIPV infection. The objective of this study was to investigate the immune mediator profiles in CRFK-infected cells and FCoV-positive cats. Both gene and protein expression profiles were determined by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) and multiplex bead-based assays.",

The status of FCoV infection was evaluated in cats that were presented to the University Veterinary Hospital (UVH), UPM, using Biogal's Immunocomb Antibody Test Kit (Biogal-Galed Laboratories, Israel) to determine the antibody titer, followed by reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) to detect the presence of FCoV in the serum [23] . Combscale S value was used as a colorimetric indicator for the determination of anti-FCoV antibody titer, where cats with antibody titers \u2265 S2+ were chosen for further analysis [24] . In addition, cats were also screened serologically for Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV) and Feline Leukemia Virus (FELV) using the SNAP FIV/FELV Combo test (IDEXX Laboratories, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cats with high antibody levels against FCoV (titer \u2265 S2+) and that are seronegative for FIV and FELV were selected and further underwent hematology evaluation. In addition to that, the presence or absence of peritoneal effusion was also evaluated in these selected cats. Post-mortem examination and follow-up analysis were not carried out to arrive at definitive diagnosis of FIP. Healthy seronegative FIV/FELV cats with absence of antibody titer against FCoV were considered as negative control cats.",

Only two cats (cats 10 and 11) exhibited higher viral load in the plasma. Almost all cats with peritoneal effusions had higher plasma viral load (p < 0.05) compared to cats without peritoneal effusion. ",

As shown in Table 7 , expression of all the genes except for CCL17 were detected in the PBMC of the sampled cats. However, gene expression levels varied among the cats. Most of the cats did not express or expressed very low levels of CCL8 and CXCL10 compared to healthy cats, except for cats 2, 3 and 5. The expression of MX1 was detected in all FCoVseropositive cats but not in healthy cats, and higher expression levels were detected in FCoV-positive cats with effusions (Table 7) . Although viperin functions as an IFN-induced antiviral protein, similar to MX1, different patterns of viperin expression was observed. In addition, five out of six cats without signs of effusion showed downregulation of viperin compared to control cats (Table 7) . Nevertheless, in cats with effusions, expression of viperin showed a trend similar that of MX1. In addition, a majority of the FCoV-positive cats with effusions showed markedly elevated expression levels of MX1 and viperin. As expected, the FCoV-negative cats did not express any of the analyzed immune-related genes, except for viperin.",

However, no clear pattern was observed between the different levels of cytokines in cats with or without the presence of peritoneal effusions. Nevertheless, the expression of the immunerelated proteins was higher in PES than in serum.

The expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, such as GM-CSF, IFN\u03b3, IL8, KC, RANTES, and MCP1, was readily detected in the serum of FCoV-positive cats ( Table 9 ). The expression of IL1\u03b2 and IL6 was not detected in the serum of the majority of the cats; however, these cytokines were detected in the PES of cats with peritoneal effusions (Table 10) . TNF\u03b1 production was detected in both FCoV-positive and negative cohorts. The production of this cytokine in the control cats could be due to an inflammatory process unrelated to FCoV infection, such as physiological stress [28] .

Unlike other immune-related proteins, serum levels of stem cell factor (SCF) were lower in the FCoV-positive cats compared to the control cats (Table 9 ).",

Since FIP is an immune-mediated viral disease, studies using immunological approaches are crucial for a better understanding of the illness, particularly by using clinical samples of FIP cases before further studies utilizing experimental infection in cats could be justified. Detection of FCoV antigen in affected tissues by immunohistochemistry remains the gold standard in the confirmation of FIP [2] . One of the limitations of this study is that definitive confirmation of FIP was not made due to the unavailability of post-mortem samples. Therefore, the cats were selected based on their FCoV antibody and antigen status. In addition, the selected FCoV-positive cats were grouped according to the presence of peritoneal effusions at the time of clinical evaluation. Although we could not confirm the status of FIP in these cats, this study provides a preliminary examination on the array of immune mediators that may be involved in the development of FIP. In this study, more than 20 immune mediators were characterized following FIPV 79-1146 infection of CRFK cells and in FCoV-positive cats. Different expression profiles of immune mediators were detected in FIPV 79-1146-infected CRFK cells and those from FCoV-positive cats. Furthermore, the CRFK cells were used to optimize the real-time PCR detection of the different immune-related genes and to detect interferon-related genes during viral infection.",

In this study, we confirmed the upregulation of these genes using Taqman real-time PCR (Table 2) ; however, detected levels of expression varied, which could be due to the differences in the sensitivity of these different platforms. One of the genes of interest that was highly upregulated and associated with an increase in viral load is MX1, an interferoninduced GTP-binding protein. Previous studies have shown that MX1 is an interferon-inducible protein found in humans and various animals that mediates resistance against RNA viruses [29] . In this study, we showed that mRNA expression of MX1 was significantly upregulated at 48 and 72 hpi and found to be correlated with the viral load at 48 hpi (Tables 2 and 3 ). Previous studies have also shown that the antiviral role of this gene is related to IFN\u03b1 and \u03b2 (IFN type 1) induction and GTPase pathways [19] . Similar to MX1, RSAD2, which is also known as viperin, is a gene that encodes for an IFN-induced antiviral protein [30] . However, unlike MX1, which is activated by type I IFN, viperin is induced by different types of IFN [31, 32] . In fact, the expression of viperin can be induced by double-stranded RNA analogs such as poly I:C, lipopolysaccharides and by infection with a broad range of both RNA and DNA viruses, indicating the diverse role of viperin during infection [31, 32] . The importance of this finding is not clear; nevertheless, studies have shown that viruses such as Japanese Encephalitis Virus (JEV) [33] and Dengue Virus type 2 (DENV-2) [34] can downregulate antiviral innate immune responses such as viperin and other IFNinducible protein expression [31, 32] . Further studies are required to measure type I IFN levels in cats with FIP.",

Hence, it is essential to further evaluate the importance of this finding in FIP cats. Earlier studies have proposed that the fundamental difference in the immune profiles of dry and wet forms of FIP is based on the predominant T cell responses. Cats with the dry form of FIP have a higher number of Th1 cells for the induction of CMI response, while cats with the wet form of FIP generally showed Th2-type response that leads to humoral immune response [13, 19] . The majority of FIP cases involve the presence of abdominal effusion, which was observed in eight out of 15 FCoV-positive cats sampled in this study [2] . Based on the pathogenesis of FIP, the accumulation of fluids in the peritoneal cavity of these cats is most probably due to the accumulation of the infected macrophages in the inter-venular space and venule walls [1, 10] . Activated and FCoV-infected monocytes can induce phlebitis through the paracrine and autocrine action of CD18, IL-1\u03b2 and TNF\u03b1 [11] . In addition, higher secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been associated with an increased production of effusion in cats with FIP [36] . Also, studies have shown that PE of cats diagnosed with FIP consisted primarily of macrophages and neutrophils with a low number of lymphocytes [37] . This study is in agreement with another study that reported a higher viral load in the supernatants of PE compared to those derived from the blood component of affected cats (Table 6 ) [15] . In addition, as expected, this study detected high expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, namely GM-CSF, IFN\u03b3, IL8, KC, RANTES and MCP1, which are secreted mainly by monocytes/macrophages. The detection of CCL17 in the cell component of PE but not in PBMC indicated the inflammatory nature of the activated cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells (DC) present in the PE which may play an important role in the activation of Th2 cells [38, 39] . Furthermore, the lack of CCL17 expression, a chemokine that is primarily expressed in Th2 cells of cats with allergic inflammation [40] , in the PBMC of the cats sampled in this study suggests a local rather than systemic response to the virus as also observed in other studies [17, 41, 42] . Further studies are warranted to confirm the expression of CCL17 by the activated cells from the PE of FIP cats. In addition, the downregulation of SCF (Table 9 ) is probably associated with the reduction of DC in cats with FIP, since SCF and Flt-3 L are important cytokines for the ex vivo propagation of human and mice DC [43, 44] . It was known that DC could be infected by FCoV; however, the role of SCF and Flt-3 L in FIPV infection warrants further examination [45] .",

These findings were expected as biological individual variation could occur and has been observed in several other natural and experimental FIPV infections [12, 19] . Nevertheless, the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, namely IL1\u03b2 and IL6, was more readily detected in the PES rather than the serum of the cats diagnosed with FIP. This finding is in agreement with previous studies that showed IL1 and IL6 can be detected in the serum and PE of FIP cases but not in those of healthy cats [18] . Besides, previous studies have shown that IL1\u03b2 is related to CNS involvement and can only be detected in the inflammatory cells in the brain [19] . In this study, we found that IL-18, a proinflammatory cytokine in the IL-1 family that plays a major role in the activation of NK and T cells [46] , was not readily detected in both serum and PES. The upregulation of TNF\u03b1 protein in the serum and PES of some of the cats was in line with findings by previous studies that detected an increase in TNF\u03b1 mRNA in abdominal effusions and PBMC of FIPpositive cats [14] . In addition, it has been suggested that this cytokine is responsible for T cell apoptosis [14, 21] . Hence, the role of these cytokines in FCoVpositive cats requires further evaluation. Interestingly, most of the FCoV-positive cats in this study have increased Fas serum levels, which may suggest a possible role of Fas in T cell apoptosis observed in FIP, as apoptosis can be induced by overexpression of Fas during viral infection [47] .",

In addition, no clear indication of Th1 and Th2 imbalance was detected in the various samples analyzed in this study. However, in general, MX1, viperin, CXCL10, CCL8, RANTES, KC, MCP1, IL8, GM-CSF and IFN\u03b3 were readily detected in FCoVpositive cats whereby MX1 and viperin expression was higher in FCoV-positive cats with peritoneal effusions. Future studies on FIP confirmed cases need to be carried out to further establish the importance of the different immune mediators in the development of FIP. ",
