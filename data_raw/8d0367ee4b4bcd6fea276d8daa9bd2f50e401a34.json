Central public health laboratories use reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) for diagnosis of respiratory viruses, but this protocol identifies only specific targets, resulted in inconclusive diagnosis for many samples.

Globalisation, climate change, settlements near wild animal habitats, and increasing numbers of immunocompromised people are likely to contribute to the emergence and spread of new infections. (3) HTS methods have allowed genomic analysis which is sensitive for unknown or peculiar viruses over previous methodologies, such as the analysis of viral genomes used in the identification or discovery of human herpesvirus 8, (4) bocavirus, (5) human parvovirus 4, (6) human GB virus, (7) Torque Teno virus, (8) WU polyomavirus (9) and KI polyomavirus. (10) HTS has been used, for example, in the discovery of an arenavirus in three patients who died of a febrile illness a few weeks after transplant of solid organs from a single donor. (11) The Illumina platform allowed identifying hepatitis A virus among cases of acute febrile illnesses that occurred in Brazil which were suspected as yellow fever. (12) The same platform was used to identify a new influenza virus from swabs samples and assembly of its genome. (13) It also led to the detection of viral pathogens in nasopharyngeal aspirate samples from patients with acute lower respiratory tract infections, as a new enterovirus, termed enterovirus 109 (EV109) detected in a cohort of Nicaraguan children with viral respiratory disease. (14) Thereby, this study aimed to detect unidentified viruses by HTS approach in negative samples of nasopharynx/tracheal secretions for diagnostics targeting several viruses collected from June to August 2016 in the Federal District (DF), Brazil.",

Central laboratories (Lacens) in Brazil are responsible for the occurrence reports about the etiologic agents, types and subtypes of circulating respiratory viruses in patients with influenza-like syndrome (ILS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). (1) The main technique for detecting respiratory viruses in Lacens is reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), which advantages are sensitivity, specificity, automation, relatively low cost and so on. However, this technique as well as the conventional RT-PCR are pathogen-specific, which only find pre-defined targets. Thus, a peculiar etiological agent or new genetic variants may not be detected, despite the use of a wide range of sensitive diagnostic tests. (2) In this context, high-throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies without requiring any prior genomic information provide large volume of nucleotide sequences, resulting in elucidation of unidentified viruses (which were not detectable by the specific detection methods) and furthermore, allow the discovery of new viruses or new genomic variants using metagenomic approaches.",

Next, part of all three samples were treated with DNase I (Promega, Madison, USA) in order to decrease the human or bacterial DNA in the sample for viral RNA enrichment.

(15) Metagenomic reads of each sample were then uploaded to Kaiju for profiling the reads in taxonomic assessment (http://kaiju.binf.ku.dk). (16) DNA reads were filtered with BWA v0.7.17 (17) and SAMtools v1.9 (18) against reference hg38 (Homo sapiens) obtained from GenBank to remove human DNA sequences from HTS dataset in silico. Trimmed reads were assembled into contiguous sequences ('contigs') with Velvet v.1.2.1 (19) and SPAdes v.3.9 (20) programs. The tBlastx search (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ Blast.cgi) against the viral genome package (RefSeq Virus, NCBI, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/viruses/) which is implemented in the Geneious R8.1 program (Biomatters, Auckland, New Zealand) was used to identify the contig sequences which were viral origins. The analyses showed that nasopharyngeal secretion pooled samples of June, July and August of 2016 had similar metagenomic profiles in relation to the components of microorganisms classified found: predominance of viruses [Supplementary data (Figure) ], followed by bacteria and other microorganisms, such as Archaeas. However, the higher recovery of viral sequences in DNA/RNA samples was considered as misinterpretation by Kaiju program since the later fine analyses using BLASTn found that many of the human DNA sequences present in the samples were recognised as DNA viruses due to the similarity of some genomic regions. After in silico filtration of the reads by human DNA sequences, 77.26% of reads were classified as microbial sequences for June (274,269 out of 354,975), 81.22% for July (242,730 out of 298,846) and 82.50% for August (312,605 out of 378,895). This result showed that the contamination of human DNA was problematic for virus sequence search in these samples. As the human chromosomal and microbial DNA masked the presence of RNA viruses in the total DNA/RNA samples, the amount of DNA was reduced by DNase I treatment and the samples were subjected to the HTS again as one RNA sample.",

Therefore, the fine analyses of virus identification were performed using only the RNA sample, since most respiratory viruses possess RNA genomes. A total of 14,952 reads was classified as virus organisms. The main viruses identified using the Kaiju program were of the families Picornaviridae, Herpesviridae, Parvoviridae and Coronaviridae, with the emphasis on rhinoviruses (Table I) . The same viral families were also found in the DNA/RNA sample reads after the removal of human DNA sequences in silico, however, with less frequency. Only cytomegalovirus sequences were found more in DNA/RNA samples than RNA sample (Table I) , probably due to the negative effect on cytomegalovirus DNA genomes by DNase I treatment in preparation of RNA sample.",

Only the Coronaviridae family was not identified by tBlastx in Geneious (but identified by Kaiju), probably due to limited sensitivity of de novo contig assembly, although we chose the most sensitive ones, Velvet and SPAdes. (21) It is observed in Table II (contigs assembled by SPAdes) that the number of contigs varied from 1 (Enterovirus B and C) to 12 (Rhinovirus A), with sizes of alignment between 93 and 1,239 nucleotides. The number of reads per contig also varied greatly, from 4 to 2,470 with the highest amount of reads per contig found in the Rhinovirus C species. The e-values from 5.38 x 10 -148 to 1.99 x 10 -11 indicates statistical significance in the alignments found using the SPAdes as assembler. Table III shows the tBlastx results of contigs assembled by Velvet. The number of contigs varied between 1 (Enterovirus B, C and E) and 62 (Rhinovirus A) with sizes of alignment between 87 and 885 nucleotides. The number of reads per contig ranged from 3 to 962, with the highest number of reads found also for Rhinovirus C. E-values from 1.23 x 10 -152 to 2.33 x 10 -11 were also low, showing statistical significance of the alignment. The comparison of Tables II and III reveals that, when using Velvet as assembler, more contigs were formed, although with smaller length and fewer reads per contig. But this is important to identify more viruses in less abundance, as Human betaherpesvirus 5. Human bocavirus and Enterovirus E have been identified using Velvet, but not when using SPAdes as assembler.",

Human betaherpesvirus 5 (Cytomegalovirus) was identified by analyses with Kaiju and Geneious program, but not with PR21 RT-qPCR because specific primers for this pathogen were not included in the kit. DNA viruses as herpesvirus and parvovirus were also found in the sample treated with DNase I. We assume that DNase I treatment doesn't exclude totally DNA in the sample, thus, herpesvirus and parvovirus reads were recovered. Coronavirus was identified with the Kaiju program but not by the contig analyses by tBlastx. However, its presence was confirmed by RT-qPCR of PR21 kit. Bocavirus (or Primate bocaparvovirus 1), and Enterovirus was also identified by PR21 RT-qPCR, Kaiju and Geneious programs only using Velvet, which is more sensitive method than SPAdes for contig assembly.

For some cases, the limited sensitivity of HTS is explained by mixing some clinical samples forming one pooled sample for the cost reduction. Therefore, this sample preparation may mask the presence of viruses in low incidence or concentration. The limited capacity of de novo assembly programs is still a main problem in metagenomic analyses. Velvet and SPAdes de novo assemblers were used to build contigs in this study since these were reported as sensitive contig assembler for viral metagenomic study, (21) although there was no best de novo assembler concluded by the same authors. HTS was reported to be less sensitive than RT-qPCR for some respiratory virus detection in such reasons. (23) Rhinovirus was the major viruses found in patients in the DF, Brazil with ILS or SARS samples which were negative by standard RT-qPCR of influenza-like surveillance (targeting Influenza A and B, Respiratory Syncytial Virus, Human Metapneumovirus, Adenovirus, Parainfluenza 1, 2 and 3). Several studies have shown the importance of rhinoviruses in acute respiratory infection in Brazil, especially in children. (24, 25, 26) A study involving 120 children less than 12 years old in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, found that human rhinoviruses (HRV) of species A, B, and C were the most frequent agents of acute respiratory infections (ARI). Moreover, these agents are also associated with up to 70% of virus-related wheezing exacerbations. The most recently identified Rhinovirus C has been detected in association with bronchiolitis, wheezing, and asthma exacerbations requiring hospitalisation. (27) Other study made with hospitalised patients at an academic care centre in Southern Brazil shows that HRV was usually detected in hospitalised children with respiratory infections and was often present in viral co-detections, mainly with enterovirus and respiratory syncytial virus. Comorbidities are closely associated with HRV infections, and this virus predominates during colder seasons, (28) period of which the samples used in this work were collected (winter). In investigations around the world, HRV, as well as agents causing acute respiratory infections, has its peak activity associated with the colder periods of the year. (29, 30) In this study, the relevance of HRV in public health in Brazil was again recognised and we suggest the inclusion of HRV for influenza-like surveillance.",
