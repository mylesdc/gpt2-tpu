The operator DNA sequence to which C.AhdI binds consists of two adjacent binding sites, O L and O R . Binding of C.AhdI to O L and to O L 1 O R has been investigated by circular permutation DNA-bending assays and by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. CD indicates considerable distortion to the DNA when bound by C.AhdI. Binding to one or two sites to form dimeric and tetrameric complexes increases the CD signal at 278 nm by 40 and 80% respectively, showing identical local distortion at both sites. In contrast, DNA-bending assays gave similar bend angles for both dimeric and tetrameric complexes (47 and 388, respectively). The relative orientation of C.AhdI dimers in the tetrameric complex and the structural role of the conserved Py-A-T sequences found at the centre of C-protein-binding sites are discussed.",

The structure reveals a largely alpha-helical dimeric protein, including a helix-turn-helix motif responsible for DNA sequence recognition. Efficient binding to DNA requires dimerization of C.AhdI (16) . However, since the interaction between the two subunits of the dimer is weak (K d \u00bc 2.5 mM), expression of C.AhdI (and thus R.AhdI) from this promoter cannot be established until sufficiently high concentrations of C.AhdI have accumulated (via expression from the weak C-independent promoter) to favour protein dimerization (16) . C.AhdI dimers then bind to the C/R operator and activate transcription from the strong C-dependent promoter, leading to an exponential increase in C-protein (and thus the endonuclease) by positive feedback. It is clear that a mechanism for switching off transcription is also required in any such positive feedback system.",

This sequence contains a quasi-symmetrical repeating sequence resembling that found upstream of many C-genes in a variety of type II R-M systems (6, 13) . EMSA and analytical ultracentrifugation studies have shown that C.AhdI forms dimeric and tetrameric complexes on the promoter, and the binding constants for these interactions have been established (17) . It was proposed that the binding of C.AhdI dimers at the distal site (O L ) upstream of the C-gene activates transcription of the C and R genes, through interaction with the -70 subunit of RNA polymerase bound at the adjacent \u00c035 site, whereas subsequent binding of the C-protein to the proximal (O R ) site (overlapping the \u00c035 site) to form tetramers represses transcription from this operon (17) . Binding of C.AhdI to the proximal site may provide the required mechanism for subsequently switching off transcription of its own gene, and thus also downregulating R.AhdI, to avoid overproduction of the endonuclease (17) .",

Figure 5 shows the increase in \u00c1\" as the protein:DNA molar ratio increases, for both 35WT and 35L sequences. Upon addition of C.AhdI to 35WT, an almost linear increase in \u00c1\" was observed up to a 4:1 protein to DNA molar ratio, indicating strong stoichiometric binding to both DNA-binding sites. The \u00c1\" observed for C.AhdI binding to 35L increases in a similar fashion up to a 2:1 protein to DNA ratio, and thereafter increases at a much lower rate, consistent with strong binding of the first dimer and very weak binding of the second dimer.

The association constant for the formation of C.AhdI dimers (K 1 ) was fixed at 4 \u00c2 10 5 M \u00c01 , as determined previously from AUC experiments, although at the relatively high DNA concentrations used in the CD titrations, this value is not of great relevance as the protein is dimeric throughout the titration. The binding constant for binding the first dimer (K 2 ) could be fitted with a value of 2 \u00c2 10 7 M \u00c01 in both cases. For binding of the second dimer to the O R operator site in the 35WT DNA sequence, K 3 \u00bc 3 \u00c2 10 7 M \u00c01 was obtained. In contrast, binding of the second dimer to 35L is three orders of magnitude weaker (K 3 \u00bc 2 \u00c2 10 4 M \u00c01 ), corresponding to weak nonspecific binding of the second dimer at this site, as expected since the specific sequence required for C.AhdI recognition has been mutated at this site. In order to investigate the stability of the DNA complexes formed, CD melting curves were recorded for the DNA (35WT), and for protein complexes with DNA at 2:1 and 4:1 molar ratios. The free DNA shows a classical melting curve with a T m of 65.28C ( Figure 6A ). It is notable that for the 2:1 and 4:1 nucleoprotein complexes, the large enhancement of the CD signal remains throughout the temperature range until the DNA melts. Thus the C.AhdI dimeric and tetrameric complexes are highly thermostable; moreover, the structural changes induced in the DNA are retained until the DNA denatures. Normalization of the data to represent the fractional denaturation of the DNA ( Figure 6B ) shows that the melting curves are almost identical. Detailed inspection of the curves shows that there is a small increase in the T m from 65.2 to 66.58C for the tetrameric complex and a somewhat higher T m of 68.58C for the dimeric complex. The slightly lower thermal stability of the tetrameric complex, compared to the dimeric complex, could reflect the higher intrinsic binding affinity at the O L site, combined with a decrease in the cooperativity (and thus a reduction in the effective affinity for the second site) at higher temperatures.",

It is interesting to note that the bend angle (488) introduced into DNA when a TET repressor dimer binds to its operator sequence (28) is almost identical to the bend angle (478) when a C.AhdI dimer binds DNA, correlating with a similar increase in CD signal at 276 nm.",

It was therefore proposed that the two dimers must occupy different faces of the DNA helix. This would be consistent with the observed spacing of 15 bp between the centres of the two binding sites, if standard B-form DNA was assumed. However, formation of DNA-protein complexes frequently distort the DNA and indeed, this is the case for C.AhdI as judged by the results of circular dichroism.",

Assuming the local bend at each site is equal, one can relate the overall bend angle to the rotational phasing of the two dimers in the tetrameric complex. If the two C.AhdI dimers bound on the same face of the DNA ( \u00bc 0), the bend angle for the tetramer complex would be double that for the dimer complex. However, we find that the bending is not additive; rather, formation of the tetramer leads to a lower overall bend angle than that caused by binding of one dimer, supporting the hypothesis that the two dimers occupy different faces of the DNA. Clearly, however, the bend angles do not cancel out to zero (as might be expected if the proteins were bound on opposite faces of the DNA helix, i.e. \u00bc 1808).",

For two identical bends () introduced into a linear structure, where the planes defining each bend deviate from co-planarity by an angle , giving an overall bend angle , it can be shown (Dr D. Whitley, personal communication) that cos \u00bc sqrt(1 \u00c0 s 2 ) cos ( \u00fe ), where s \u00bc (sin \u00c1 sin ), \u00bc tan \u00c01 (tan \u00c1 cos ). This analysis assumes that the distance separating the two bends is small compared with the overall length, as is the case here. From this we derive a twist angle, \u00bc 1258 corresponding to 11.1 bp per turn over the 15 bp separating the two centres (or the equally valid mirror image solution, \u00bc \u00c01258 \u00bc 2358, corresponding to 9.1 bp per turn). This can be compared with theoretical values of \u00bc 1808 for 10 bp per turn, or 1558 for 10.5 bp per turn. Thus our data indicate that in addition to DNA bending, there is significant twisting of the DNA, but we cannot distinguish between the two possibilities of underwinding or overwinding.",

It is of interest to note that the trinucleotide spacer at the centre of both C.AhdI-binding sites (CAT and TAT, respectively) is strongly conserved over a wide range of known and predicted C-protein-binding sites from different bacterial species (13) . This suggests a structural role since these sequences are asymmetrical and unlikely to make sequence-specific interactions with the C-protein dimer. It may also be relevant that the most commonly found nucleotide following the T of the trinucleotide spacer is A (i.e. the first base in the consensus recognition sequence AGTC). The conservation of Py-A-T sequences in the trinucleotide spacer could therefore reflect a requirement for protein-induced DNA bending at these sites.",
