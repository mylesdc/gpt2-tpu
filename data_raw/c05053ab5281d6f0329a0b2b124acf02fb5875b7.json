            "text": "We have developed a high-resolution genomic mapping technique that combines transposon-mediated insertional mutagenesis with either capillary electrophoresis or massively parallel sequencing to identify functionally important regions of the Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) genome. We initially used a capillary electrophoresis method to gain insight into the role of the VEEV nonstructural protein 3 (nsP3) in viral replication. We identified several regions in nsP3 that are intolerant to small (15 bp) insertions, and thus are presumably functionally important. We also identified nine separate regions in nsP3 that will tolerate small insertions at low temperatures (30uC), but not at higher temperatures (37uC, and 40uC). Because we found this method to be extremely effective at identifying temperature sensitive (ts) mutations, but limited by capillary electrophoresis capacity, we replaced the capillary electrophoresis with massively parallel sequencing and used the improved method to generate a functional map of the entire VEEV genome. We identified several hundred potential ts mutations throughout the genome and we validated several of the mutations in nsP2, nsP3, E3, E2, E1 and capsid using single-cycle growth curve experiments with virus generated through reverse genetics. We further demonstrated that two of the nsP3 ts mutants were attenuated for virulence in mice but could elicit protective immunity against challenge with wild-type VEEV. The recombinant ts mutants will be valuable tools for further studies of VEEV replication and virulence. Moreover, the method that we developed is applicable for generating such tools for any virus with a robust reverse genetics system.",

The non-structural proteins are initially translated as two polyproteins, P123 and P1234. In SINV, and several other alphaviruses including VEEV, the major non-structural polyprotein, P123, is produced by translation termination at an opal codon at the end of nsP3. Occasional read-through of the opal termination codon produces P1234. Cleavage of P1234 in cis by a protease activity that resides in nsP2 generates a complex of P123 and nsP4 that can initiate minus-strand RNA synthesis. P123 is cleaved into nsP1, nsP2, and nsP3, and these fully cleaved forms generate a complex with cellular proteins, replicate the full-length viral genome from minus-strand templates, and transcribe the subgenomic RNA encoding the viral structural proteins.",

The protein consists of two domains, an N-terminal macrodomain that is highly conserved among alphaviruses and a hypervariable, phosphorylated C-terminal domain. Macro domains (also called X domains) are found in proteins from bacteria, archea, and eukaryotes, as well as several viruses including alphaviruses, coronaviruses, hepatitis E virus, and rubella virus [28, 29, 30, 31] . They bind ADP-ribose and poly(ADP-ribose) and exhibit ADPribose 10-phosphatase activity. The crystal structure of the VEEV macrodomain was recently solved, revealing a conserved adenosine binding pocket [32] . nsP3 is the only Alphavirus non-structural protein that is phosphorylated [33] , with most or all of the phosphorylation on serine and threonine residues in the Cterminus [34, 35] .",

            "text": "The studies that we report here were initiated to gain insight into the function of VEEV nsP3. Toward this goal, we used transposon mutagenesis, reverse genetics, and fragment analysis by capillary electrophoresis to identify regions of the nsP3 gene that are important for replication and that result in temperature sensitive (ts) mutations. Although this work demonstrated the utility of using insertional mutagenesis for identifying such regions, the method was limited by the inherently low capacity of fragment analysis by capillary electrophoresis. Consequently, we developed a novel high-resolution functional mapping technique that couples transposon insertional mutagenesis with tag sequencing on a next-generation sequencing platform. We used transposon mutagenesis to construct a cDNA library with small DNA fragments randomly inserted throughout the VEEV genome and then produced replication-competent virus through reverse genetics. Comparing transposon insertion sites in the resultant viruses to those in the starting library, we were able to produce a functional map of the entire genome of VEEV, and to identify several hundred potential ts mutations, including those we originally identified with the capillary electrophoresis method. We further validated the mutations in cell culture assays of recombinant viruses generated through reverse genetics and tested two of the nsP3 ts mutants in mice to see if they could act as attenuated vaccines. These studies provide both new information about the association of nsP3 gene regions with virulence, as well as a rapid and effective method for identifying and creating new ts mutants for replication studies.",

Our final library consisted of 6.2610 6 full-length clones of the VEEV genome with 15 bp insertions in nsP3 and had an average complexity of approximately 200-fold coverage at every nucleotide position. The 15 bp insertions consist of 10 bp derived from a modified MuA transposon and 5 bp derived from duplication of the transposition target site. The sequence derived from the transposon contains a unique NotI restriction site that allows for mapping the insert location in the VEEV genome. We produced virus pools from the insert library by using standard alphavirus reverse genetics, as depicted in Figure S1 . Infectious RNA was produced by in vitro transcription of the insert library, and was transfected into BHK cells. The transfected BHK cells were then incubated at 30uC to generate virus particles. Virus was collected from the supernatant of the transfected cells and used to infect fresh Vero cells at an MOI of 0.1. The low MOI infection was intended to prevent trans-complementation caused by coinfecting mutant viruses, which could confound our downstream analyses. Infected cell cultures were incubated at either 30uC, 37uC, or 40uC to determine if there would be a temperaturedependent difference in the functional maps of viruses produced at these temperatures. RNA from our starting unselected pool, and RNAs isolated from the 30uC, 37uC, and 40uC infection supernatants were reverse transcribed and used as templates for PCR amplification using primer combinations (Tables S1 and S2) that generated amplicons of approximately 700 bp long with a fluorescent FAM label on the 59 end, and a biotin tag on the 39 end. The amplicons were bound to streptavidin-coated magnetic beads, and then digested with NotI to release any fragments containing a NotI site derived from a transposon insertion. The sizes of the released fragments were analyzed by capillary electrophoresis on a Prism 3130XL Genetic Analyzer. We included a FAM-labeled sequencing ladder of each amplicon to accurately size fragments. To analyze results, we generated electropherograms ( Figure 2 ) in which the X-axis indicates the size of the DNA fragment (the transposon insertion position), and the Y-axis indicates the fluorescence intensity (the number of transposon insertions at that position).",

VEEV normally circulates in rodent populations, but during outbreaks it can jump to horses and humans where it can cause debilitating and potentially fatal disease. There are currently no vaccines or antiviral agents against VEEV licensed for use in humans. In this study, we describe a technique that we have developed that allows for the rapid identification of viral mutants that can be useful for studying the basic biology of viral replication. These mutants can also be used to generate vaccines that protect against infection with wild-type virus. We demonstrate the utility of this technique by identifying over 200 mutations spread throughout VEEV genome that make the virus unable to replicate efficiently at higher temperatures (37uC or 40uC.) Furthermore, we show that two of the mutant viruses work as vaccines, and protect mice against lethal infection with VEEV. This technique can be applied to studying other viruses, and may allow for the rapid identification of numerous vaccine candidates.",

Each prepared sequencing library (30uC virus, 40uC virus, and unselected in vitro transcribed RNA) was assessed on a single large region of a GS-FLX picotiter plate.

Mutant ts11 had an extremely slow growth phenotype that made it difficult to measure.

Not surprisingly, most of the conserved N-terminus of the protein was intolerant to short insertions while most of the variable C-terminus would tolerate insertions. Two regions in the C-terminus that would not tolerate insertions spanned nucleotides 5628-5666 and nucleotides 5684-5702. The latter region might be expected to be intolerant to insertions, as that region encodes the extreme C terminus of nsP3, including the cleavage site between nsP3 and nsP4. Disruptions in this region could prevent cleavage of nsP3 from nsP4, which is an essential step in viral replication [45] . The other site is more enigmatic. The region from 5628-5666 has no obvious homology to known regions of importance, and will require additional study to determine why insertions are not tolerated. One recent study with SFV indicated that the extreme C-terminus of nsP3 contains a degradation signal and a signal important for its' cellular localization [46] . The regions we have identified here might play a similar role in VEEV replication.",

While this technique worked relatively well for analyzing short stretches of DNA or RNA (i.e., up to 2 kb), the technique had limitations that made it cumbersome for analysis of larger gene regions. For example, we could only analyze individual amplicons of approximately 600-800 bp due to the inherent loss of size resolution in larger fragments. We also needed to include a sequencing ladder in each electrophoretic analysis to obtain accurate fragment size information. Because our mapping fragments had short transposon-derived sequences appended to the 39 end, fragment sizing with the sequencing ladder was not exact. We theorized that functional mapping by using massively parallel sequencing might overcome some of these issues. In principle, the large number of sequencing reads obtained would allow us to measure the relative frequencies of insertions at each nucleotide position in the genome. Massively parallel sequencing would also provide an exact sequence readout of the locations of inserts and generate highly accurate maps. Lastly, mapping by For our studies, we used a Roche GS-FLX system, which was adequate for mapping the approximately 11.5 kb VEEV genome (,100 K-200 K reads per sample.) Viruses with larger genomes could be mapped by using other sequencing platforms such as the Illumina Genome Analyzer or Applied Biosystems SOLiD sequencer. These platforms produce hundreds of millions of sequencing reads, and would permit the analysis of a much larger number of samples per sequencing run. Therefore, they are probably the optimal systems for this type of analysis. Although the length of sequencing reads obtained on these systems are shorter than those obtained on the GS-FLX, the 35+ bp reads that they generate should be enough to map insertion sites onto the relatively simple genomes of viruses. In our analysis of VEEV, we found that the first 20 nts of sequence was sufficient for mapping each read back to the genome.",

All 10 sites that we chose for further analysis gave rise to a virus with a ts phenotype, thus it is likely that most or all of the other sites could also be reverse engineered to generate novel ts mutant viruses that could be used for functional studies of VEEV proteins. Many of the sites fell outside of the known functional domains of VEEV proteins, such as the helicase and peptidase domains of nsP2 and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase domain of nsP4, and may represent additional domains with unknown functions in these proteins.

For example, we demonstrated one use of functional mapping data by constructing ts mutants that acted as attenuated vaccines in a mouse model of lethal VEEV infection. None of the mice vaccinated with these viruses showed any signs of disease, and most were protected from challenge with wild-type VEEV. Of the three mice that did succumb to challenge, all were in groups that were inoculated with only 10 pfu of ts mutant virus; thus, it is possible that these mice were not infected in the first place. This is supported by the observation that one mouse in each group did not develop neutralizing antibodies after infection with the ts mutants. The utility of this technique for designing ts vaccines lies not only in the ability to detect large numbers of ts mutants, but also in the ability to multiplex those mutations to generate viruses with a potentially more stable ts phenotype. In our study, we demonstrated that we could combine two mutants in our double ts mutant and still recover viable ts virus. It might be possible to combine more than two mutations, with each additional mutation reducing the reversion potential of the final attenuated virus.",

To prevent interference with restriction digestions required for genetic analysis, NotI sites in both pVEE Replicon 1.0 and pV3000 26S were changed to AscI sites by digestion with NotI followed by ligation of a linker with the sequence 59-GGCCGGCGCGCC-39. This change did not interfere with virus production from the full-length genome. The modified pVEE Replicon 1.0 was named pBB300, and the modified pV3000 26S was named pBB305. A MuA transposon, Entranceposon M1-Kan R (1131 bp, part of the Mutation Generation Kit from Finnzymes, Espoo, Finland), was transposed into pBB300. Briefly, target DNA, Entranceposon M1-Kan R , and MuA transposase were combined in transposition buffer, and the transposition was allowed to proceed for 1 h at 30uC. The transposase was then inactivated by heating to 75uC for 10 min. The transposition reaction was desalted on a Sephadex G-50 spin column and transformed into DH5a E. coli. A primary insertion library with full-length transposon insertions in pBB300 was isolated by plating the transformed cells on LB containing ampicillin and kanamycin. The Mutation Generation Kit has been optimized so that greater than 99% of the clones in the library will contain a single transposon insertion. A fragment containing transposon insertions in nsP3 (and small fragments of nsP2 and nsP4) was isolated from the primary insertion library by digestion with AvrII and BsiWI. This fragment was cloned into AvrII-BsiWI cut pBB300, yielding a secondary library that only contained fulllength transposon insertions in nsP3. Digestion of the secondary library with NotI, followed by intramolecular ligation, generated a tertiary library consisting of clones with 15 bp inserts spread throughout nsP3. Finally, the 26S ApaI-AscI fragment from pBB305 was cloned into the ApaI-AscI cut tertiary library, generating the final library of full-length VEEV genomes with 15 bp insertions in nsP3.",

After binding, beads were washed three times with 500 ml of restriction endonuclease buffer, and were resuspended in 50 ml of restriction buffer containing 5 units of NotI restriction enzyme (NEB). Digests were incubated at 37uC for 1 h. After digestion, bead eluates were desalted on a sepharose filtration spin column and dried. Dried samples were resuspended in 10 ml of deionized formamide with a ROX-labeled size standard (Geneflo 625, Chimerx, Milwaukee, WI). Samples were denatured at 95uC for 2 min, and then loaded onto a Prism 3130XL Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) for capillary electrophoresis. FAM-labeled dideoxy sequencing ladders of each amplicon were run in parallel to allow for accurate fragment sizing. Settings for the run were the same as the default settings for fragment analysis on a 50 cm POP-7 array, except that the run time was changed from 1800 s to 2200 s. Data from the capillary electrophoresis runs were analyzed with Genemapper software version 3.7 (Applied Biosystems) using the Local Southern setting for peak sizing.",

The mixture was digested with AscI to generate ligatable ends on each amplicon. The AscI was heat inactivated, and the digest mixture was purified over Sepharose to remove the small end fragments generated by AscI digestion. The purified amplicons were ethanol precipitated and resuspended in a 5 ml ligation mix including T4 DNA ligase and T4 polynucleotide kinase, and the ligation was incubated overnight at 16uC. The product of this ligation was a collection of high molecular weight DNAs (hmwDNA) with sizes greater than approximately 15 kb as visualized on an ethidium bromide stained agarose gel. The hmwDNAs were processed with a GS-FLX library preparation kit (Roche) with a few modifications to the kit protocol. As per the protocol, hmwDNAs were nebulized to generate small fragments of double stranded DNA approximately 400-800 bp in size. The ends of these fragments were polished with T4 DNA polymerase and T4 polynucleotide kinase to produce blunt, phosphorylated ends. In a departure from the kit protocol, sequencing adapter ''B'' was ligated to both ends of the DNA fragments. The fragments were then digested with Not I (which cuts in the transposon insertions), and a modified sequencing adapter ''A'' was ligated onto the exposed Not I ends. At this point, we returned to the library preparation kit protocol to finish preparing the sequencing libraries for each sample. The final product for each was approximately 10 ng of sequencing library. Sequencing out from the ''A'' adapter present on each DNA fragment allowed us to identify the locations of the transposon insertions in each sample.",

After cleanup of the emPCR reactions, sequencing beads were loaded onto a Picotiter plate and sequenced on the GS-FLX. Sequences from one large region of a Picotiter plate were obtained for each sample. The sequences obtained (between 92,000 and 276,000 per sample) were processed by a short PERL script to identify those that contained a sequence tag indicative of a ''true'' sequence from a transposon insertion event. The sequence of these tags was A(R)*CGGCCGCA. The first A was from the modified ''A'' sequencing adapter. The (R)* came from a multiplex identifier (MID) that was included at the 39 end of the modified ''A'' adapter. The MID consisted of either four A or four G residues. The CGGCCGC was the residual Not I site, and the final A came from the 39 end of the transposon insertion. Approximately 70% of the sequences from each sample contained this sequence tag. The sequence of the first 20 bases after the tag was BLASTed to the VEEV genome to identify the location of the insertion [52] . To be included in the final analysis, each BLAST result had to match the VEEV genome 100% over the 20 base sequence. Approximately 95% of the tag-containing sequences were successfully mapped to the VEEV genome using these criteria. The insertion sites identified by BLAST were tallied to build a histogram of insertion frequencies across the VEEV genome.",

A plasmid containing the entire VEEV genome (pBB306) was subjected to insertional mutagenesis by transposition of a modified MuA transposon (Entranceposon M1-Kan R shown in the inset.) Removal of the bulk of the transposon by NotI digestion followed by intramolecular ligation leaves a library of clones, each containing a 15 bp insertion at an essentially random location in the genome (blue Xs shown in the 15 bp insert library). Each insertion contains a unique NotI site that can be used to map the insert location. The library is transcribed in vitro to produce infectious virus-like RNAs. These RNAs are transfected into cells, yielding recombinant viruses after 24-48 hours.
