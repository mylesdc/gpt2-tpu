Therefore it is important to understand the pathology underlying the development of CM and SMA, as opposed to uncomplicated malaria (UM). Different host responses to infection are likely to be reflected in plasma proteome-patterns that associate with clinical status and therefore provide indicators of the pathogenesis of these syndromes.",

A total of 946 children participated in this study. Plasma was subjected to high-throughput proteomic profiling. Statistical pattern-recognition methods were used to find proteomepatterns that defined disease groups. Plasma proteome-patterns accurately distinguished children with CM and with SMA from those with UM, and from healthy or severely ill malaria-negative children.",

Despite the fact that these WHO case definitions are sensitive and useful for clinical diagnosis, the pathogenesis of severe disease is not well understood. One disadvantage of the WHO clinical definitions is that they lack the specificity required to carry out studies aimed at understanding the pathogenesis of clinically different forms of childhood malaria.",

Small sample sizes, a lack of validation cohorts and a focus on a small selection of host plasma proteins have limited these studies. To overcome such limitations we use a systems approach to define the plasma proteome profile during malaria infection and identify distinctive patterns that are characteristic of different disease states. Contrary to other proteomic approaches, high-throughput plasma proteome profiling enables simultaneous analysis of a large number of samples. Therefore plasma proteome profiling allows the use of statistical pattern-recognition methods to discover and validate proteome-patterns that discriminate disease states.",

We excluded from this study those SMA patients who died. Our overall mortality rate for SMA is less than 1%. Uncomplicated malaria cases were defined as febrile children with P. falciparum parasitemia who did not require hospital admission. Our study was designed to discover and validate plasma proteome changes in dichotomous cases for which we only included those children with CM and UM with PCV greater than 20% (Table 1) . We excluded from the study blood culture positive cases. Although we did not carry out blood cultures in all severe malaria patients, the cases recruited into this study are those in whom septicemia was not suspected and who were successfully treated with antimalarial alone.

A set of proteins that are present, absent or at a different level in the samples defines a proteome-pattern that may discriminate between two or more of the study groups. To discover such patterns we applied statistical pattern recognition algorithms to the profiles and the selected number of discriminating proteins for each of the pairwise group comparisons is shown in Figure 1 , as the numbers in parentheses (Data S1). We built predictive models with the selected proteome-pattern for each study group comparison using a non-parametric supervised learning statistical framework. The discriminatory accuracy of these predictive models in the discovery cohort groups is shown in Figure 1a . To determine differences for malaria-positive children from healthy malaria-negative children we compared individually the plasma proteome of CM, SMA and UM groups with that of the CC group.",
