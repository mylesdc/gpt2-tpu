Here we evaluate the microbial biota in healthy mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) by analyses of lymph node meta-transcriptomes. cDNA libraries from five individuals and two pools of samples were prepared from retropharyngeal lymph node RNA enriched for polyadenylated RNA and sequenced using Roche-454 Life Sciences technology. Protein-coding and 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequences were taxonomically profiled using protein and rRNA specific databases. Representatives of all bacterial phyla were detected in the seven libraries based on protein-coding transcripts indicating that viable microbiota were present in lymph nodes. Residents of skin and rumen, and those ubiquitous in mule deer habitat dominated classifiable bacterial species. Based on detection of both rRNA and protein-coding transcripts, we identified two new proteobacterial species; a Helicobacter closely related to Helicobacter cetorum in the Helicobacter pylori/Helicobacter acinonychis complex and an Acinetobacter related to Acinetobacter schindleri. Among viruses, a novel gamma retrovirus and other members of the Poxviridae and Retroviridae were identified. We additionally evaluated bacterial diversity by amplicon sequencing the hypervariable V6 region of 16S rRNA and demonstrate that overall taxonomic diversity is higher with the meta-transcriptomic approach. These data provide the most complete picture to date of the microbial diversity within a wildlife host. Our research advances the use of meta-transcriptomics to study microbiota in wildlife tissues, which will facilitate detection of novel organisms with pathogenic potential to human and animals.",

Pathogenic microbes often escape detection if the clinical consequences of infection are similar to known pathogens or if they infect non-domestic species [3] . The maintenance of unknown pathogens in wildlife species is particularly problematic because many emerging human and livestock infections arise from contact with wild animals [4] [5] [6] [7] .",

Moreover, although the blood and the lymph systems are considered to be essentially free of viable microorganisms in healthy individuals, the transient and often asymptomatic presence of both bacteria and viruses have been detected in the circulation [30, 31] .

Firmicutes and Actinobacteria represented 22% and 5% of the identified bacterial taxa. Table S3 lists all bacterial genera detected in the seven data sets.

Twenty-nine of these matched to the Retroviridae and Poxviridae while the remaining were to phages, insect viruses, and a single assignment to herpesvirus.

Many of the single transcript-tags came from MD 80228, which had the highest bacterial diversity profile of all libraries analyzed, and from MD 84730. Bacterial genera detected solely in either one or both of these two samples include Acinetobacter, Legionella, Enterobacter, Salmonella, Yersinia, Vibrio, Listeria, Mannheimia, and members of the Corynebacterineae, all of which contain known pathogens. In addition, both specimens depicted by far the highest numbers of reads taxonomically assigned to the family Enterobacteriaceae. The lowest diversity of bacterial genera was found in the MD OCT-pool, which was derived from eight different mule deer. Pooling RNA from several animals potentially increases the representation of transcripts common to all animals but might decrease the ability to detect transcripts that are unique to one animal.

Other genera that were identified based on rRNA in at least two of the libraries were Actinomyces, Campylobacter and Mycoplasma. Of particular importance, rRNA-tags supported the presence of Helicobacter in the MD 257 library (Fig. 2) , of Acinetobacter, Escherichia, Pseudomonas, Salmonella, Shigella and Variovorax in the MD 80228 library, and of Shigella in the MD Bonner-pool library ( Fig. 1 and Fig. S1 , Tables S3 and S4).",

A newly described gamma retrovirus from killer whale (Orcinus orca) [38] is the closest relative of this mule deer retrovirus. The killer whale virus was described as an endogenous retrovirus based on its finding in various tissues and individuals. However, our detection of transcripts to this virus in only three of the libraries and the sequence variation in the PCR fragment between genomic (MD 80228) and transcript-derived (MD 191) mule deer samples suggest that both endogenous and exogenous gamma retroviruses might be present.",

We utilized transcript-based libraries because there is an amplification of protein-coding sequences during transcription, which increased our detection ability and provided support that the identified microorganisms were viable. Further, the database for protein-coding regions is more extensive than that for noncoding regions for non-reference organisms. Thus, focusing on transcripts should facilitate classification of novel organisms and those without complete genome coverage. Indeed, our study demonstrates that at the moderate sequencing depth employed, there were more assignable sequencing tags to protein-coding regions utilizing cDNA compared to genomic DNA, which consequently increased our ability to detect microbial taxa. In addition, transcriptome sequencing yields bacterial ribosomal RNA, which is highly expressed in metabolically active microorganisms and is well documented as a taxonomic tool for bacteria. Because single protein-coding or rRNA transcript-tags from a putative microorganism were frequently encountered, our confidence in taxonomic assignment increased by employing bioinformatics methods to classify organisms based on both types of transcripts. Amplicon 16S rRNA sequencing increased the sensitivity to detect members of some bacterial classes. However, primer specific methods do not provide as comprehensive a perspective on the microbiota due to a possible amplification bias towards more abundant taxa or those exhibiting higher primer specificity. Therefore, neither our metatranscriptomic nor amplicon sequencing approaches should be considered quantitative. We note that in samples that are highly enriched for actively replicating microbial organisms, such as environmental samples or gastrointestinal tract specimens, cDNA-based approaches can yield an abundance of small RNA produced by complex microbial communities, which can facilitate studies on microbial ecology but be less useful for identification of individual microbes [49] . In addition established metagenomics or metatranscriptomic [11, 50, 51] approaches that utilize sample fractionation methods for microbial enrichment will likely provide a more comprehensive profile of the community structure. These methods were not applicable to our samples, which included phagocytized microorganisms and viable microbes that were not robustly proliferating. Nevertheless, as deeper sequencing of cDNA libraries using newer high-throughput sequencing methods becomes more accessible, it could complement the Roche-454 pyrosequencing data, potentially covering the entire viable microbial community.",

In the analyzed samples, we identified members of all bacterial phyla, as well as archaea, a DNA virus and a Retrovirus. The bacteria were representative of organisms that are commensal to mule deer and to their external environment. For example, we detected the common rumen and intestine dwellers, Ruminococcus and Abiotrophia, based on transcript-and rRNA-tags, respectively, in most libraries, indicating that commensal gut and mucosal microorganisms may routinely be sampled in secondary lymphoid tissue, presumably from transient bacteremia. Streptomyces was the most common soil dwelling bacteria identified. Of interest, Legionella, which is found near hot springs, was identified only in an individual mule deer from the Yellowstone region. The finding of a considerable number of archaeal transcripts in MD OCT-pool and MD Bonner-pool libraries implies that members of this domain of life are likely present in mule deer habitats or resident in mule deer gastrointestinal tracts, as has been recently documented in humans [52] . Correspondingly, environmental bacteria identified in healthy deer lymph nodes may reflect the animal's habitat.",

However, viral detection may be more difficult than bacterial identification using this technology in part due to extensive sequence diversity among viruses in the same family. For example, we were only able to detect the gamma retrovirus because a transcript was present which was homologous to a conserved region of the viral env gene, and the cervid poxvirus was detected because sequence data for this virus was present in the database. Other persistent viruses, such as herpes viruses (for which we detected a single transcript), would be expected to be present in some animals. However, detection of latent herpes virus infection may be difficult because protein-coding transcript levels are low and latent viruses express non-coding RNA [53] . In addition, viral detection can be compromised if viral sequence tags were misassigned to the host organism because of homology of viral and host genes. Thus, many virus tags might be found among the host transcripts or in the not-assigned or no-hits groups of the MEGAN analysis, which together comprise nearly half of the total sequenced transcript-tags of our data.",

All members of this complex have been associated with gastritis and peptic ulcer disease in humans and animals [36, [54] [55] [56] . Our detection of this bacterium in only one animal suggests that this Helicobacter is not a mule deer commensal. Of interest in this respect is the high incidence of H. pylori infections and gastric ulcers in American Indian populations from the same geographical area in central Montana [57] . Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas were identified in MD 80228 libraries based on all detection methods used (cDNA transcripts for protein-coding and rRNA, and amplicon rRNA). Phylogenetic evaluation of Acinetobacter transcripts and 16S rRNA from the MD 80228 cDNA library placed the respective reads in close relationship to Acinetobacter schindleri. Acinetobacter species are important environmental organisms, however they also are notable pathogens. In particular, Acinetobacter schindleri infections appear to be increasing in prevalence in hospitalized patients [37, 58] . Therefore, both of the newly identified bacteria are potential mule deer pathogens.",
