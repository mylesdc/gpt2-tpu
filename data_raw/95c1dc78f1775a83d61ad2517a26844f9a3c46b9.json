The transcriptional activity of 2A protease was independent of its protease activity. EV71 2A protease retained its transcriptional activity after truncation of 40 amino acids at the N-terminus but lost this activity after truncation of 60 amino acids at the N-terminus or deletion of 20 amino acids at the C-terminus. Thus, the acidic domain at the C-terminus of this protein is essential for its transcriptional activity. Indeed, deletion of amino acids from 146 to 149 (EAME) in this acidic domain lost the transcriptional activity of EV71 2A protein though still retained its protease activity. EV71 2A protease was detected both in the cytoplasm and nucleus using confocal microscopy analysis. Coxsackie virus B3 2A protease also exhibited transcriptional activity in yeast cells. As expected, an acidic domain in the C-terminus of Coxsackie virus B3 2A protease was also identified. Truncation of this acidic domain resulted in the loss of transcriptional activity. Interestingly, this acidic region of poliovirus 2A protease is critical for viral RNA replication. The transcriptional activity of the EV71 or Coxsackie virus B3 2A protease should play a role in viral replication and/or pathogenesis.",

Thus, EV71 2A protease with 150 amino acids could passively disuse into the nucleus. Confocal microscopy analysis was used to examine the sub-cellular localization of EV71 2A protein. The expression plasmid encoding the Cterminus of VP1 protein, full-length 2A protease and V5 tag was constructed and transfected into HeLa cells before confocal microscopy analysis. The same approach was used to construct and transfect the DNA fragment encoding full-length 2A protease with mutation of amino acid 110 from Cys to Ala. Protein expression of these constructs was demonstrated using Western blot analysis ( Figure 4A ). Both the wild-type and mutant EV71 2A proteins localized in both cytoplasm and nucleus ( Figure 4B ). Amino acids 31 to 42 of EV71 2A protein (Figure 2A ) were identified as a potential nuclear export signal (NES) http://tw.expasy. org/index.html.

To determine whether mutation of the amino acids in the C-terminal acidic region affect its transcriptional activity, EV71 2A protease without amino acids 146-149 (EAME) was constructed.

This fusion protein also activates reporter genes in yeast ( Figure 6 ). Again, Coxsackie virus B3 2A protease lost its transcriptional activity after truncation of 60 amino acids at the Nterminus or deletion of 20 amino acids at the C-terminus ( Figure 6 ). Discussion EV71 2A protease is expected to enter the nucleus by passive diffusion since it is a small protein with no potential NLS. This protein would not be actively exported from the nucleus since no functional NES was detected ( Figure 4 ). These findings explain why only small portion of EV71 2A protease localized in the nucleus and the majority of this protein was retained in the cytoplasm (Figure 4) . Interestingly, 2A proteins of poliovirus and EMCV were reported to localize in the nucleus [22, 23] .",

            "text": "In addition to EV71 2A protease (Figure 1) , Coxsackie virus B3 2A protease is also a transcription activator ( Figure 6 ). Interestingly, there is an acidic domain in the C-terminus of this protein (6 amino acids within the last 15 amino acids are acidic, Table 2 ). The 2A proteases of other members of the Enterovirus genus, such as Coxsackie viruses and polioviruses, also contain an acidic domain in the C-terminus (Table 2) . On the other hand, there is no such an acidic domain in the C-terminus of 2A proteases of rhinoviruses (2 or 3 amino acids within the last 15 amino acids are acidic, Table 2 ) or cardiovirus (3 amino acids within the last 15 amino acids are acidic, Table 2 ). These observations suggest that 2A proteases of enteroviruses but not other distinctly related picornaviruses (e.g. rhinoviruses, cardioviruses) possess transcriptional activity. Interestingly, a previous report demonstrated that this acidic region of poliovirus 2Apro is critical for viral RNA replication but not for cis-or trans-proteolytic cleavage [14] . Our results also demonstrated that EV71 2A protease without amino acids 146-149 still retained its protease activity ( Figure 5A ) but lost its transcriptional activity ( Figure 5B ). Thus, enteroviral 2A proteases may transactivate some cellular genes to benefit virus replication. Some cellular genes, e.g. PCBP2, PTBP1, RTN3, GBF1, CD55, and SAM68 gene, were reported to enhance the replication of poliovirus or EV71. However, EV71 2A protease suppressed rather than increased the transcription of these cellular genes (data not shown). These results were consistent with several reports regarding the shut-off of host cell mRNA synthesis caused by EV71 3C protein [32, 33] . If enteroviral 2A proteases could in deed transactivate some cellular genes to benefit virus replication, further investigations are needed to determine its cellular target(s) and DNA-binding activity. Alternatively, EV71 2A protease may only help its own viral RNA synthesis in cytoplasm, whose mechanism is similar to the cellular transcription, rather than transactivate cellular genes to benefit virus replication. Further studies are needed to elucidate the function of this protein.",
