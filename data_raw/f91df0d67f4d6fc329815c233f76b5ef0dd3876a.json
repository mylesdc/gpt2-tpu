Failures of hospital IPC in recent years have led to nosocomial and community outbreaks of emerging infections, causing preventable deaths and social disruption. Therefore, effective IPC programs are essential, but can be difficult to sustain in busy clinical environments. Healthcare workers' adherence to routine IPC practices is often suboptimal, but there is evidence that doctors, as a group, are consistently less compliant than nurses. This is significant because doctors' behaviours disproportionately influence those of other staff and their peripatetic practice provides more opportunities for pathogen transmission. A better understanding of what drives doctors' IPC practices will contribute to development of new strategies to improve IPC, overall.",

Results: Professional/clinical autonomy; leadership and role modelling; uncertainty about the importance of HAIs and doctors' responsibilities for preventing them; and lack of clarity about senior consultants' obligations emerged as major themes. Participants described marked variation in practices between individual doctors, influenced by, inter alia, doctors' own assessment of patients' infection risk and their beliefs about the efficacy of IPC policies. Participants believed that most doctors recognise the significance of HAIs and choose to [mostly] observe organisational IPC policies, but a minority show apparent contempt for accepted rules, disrespect for colleagues who adhere to, or are expected to enforce, them and indifference to patients whose care is compromised.",

Nevertheless, the use of hand hygiene as a surrogate for IPC quality and the moral status of noncompliance have been questioned, largely as a consequence of ongoing controversy about auditing methods and plausible compliance targets [13] [14] [15] . Ethical considerations have particular salience in light of numerous studies reporting lower than average compliance with IPC policies among doctors, compared with other health professionals, albeit with wide variation [16] [17] [18] . Doctors' attitudes and behaviours are important, because they disproportionately influence those of other hospital staff and doctors often overestimate their own knowledge and compliance [19, 20] . Yet their peripatetic clinical practice provides numerous opportunities to transmit pathogens [21] and to be pathogen \"super-spreaders\" [22, 23] .",

How doctors interpret these commitments depends on how they perceive their professional identity [30] . In practice, their attitudes and practices are complex and sometimes perplexing.

At the other extreme, several participantsindependently -cited examples of units in which IPC standards were notoriously poor and HAI rates (reputedly) excessive; they also described individual consultants who had to be reminded, repeatedly, about basic IPC precautions and who vehemently demurred, refused or tried to avoid situations where they may be asked, to comply:",

He suggested that, rather than relying on VMOs' \"altruism\", the public system should provide more attractive conditions.

These problems are compounded by lack of data. Results of mandatory reporting to health authorities or internal incident reports of serious, but rare HAI-related events, such as bloodstream infections or unplanned readmissions, have little resonance and there are virtually no data about less serious HAIs. So it is impossible to monitor trends or reflect on individual consultant's or unit's performances vis-\u00e0-vis their peers, despite evidence that surveillance and feedback of results can motivate IPC improvement and reduce HAI rates [7, 52] . The lack of consistent national HAI surveillance, in Australia, is a recognised barrier to sustained IPC behavior change, particularly among doctors, and State-or hospitalbased surveillance is highly variable [53] .",

Moreover, the hostile reactions of some doctors, to being reminded about basic IPC precautions, were interpreted as a manifestation of the bullying, which is endemic in healthcare settings in many countries, including Australia [54, 55] , and as 'yet another' failure of professional self-regulation [56] . In this regard, recent media scrutiny of withdrawal of postgraduate training accreditation from two major Sydney public hospitals, largely as a consequence of bullying and harassment by senior medical staff [57, 58] , raises the question of whether hospital administrators and specialist colleges will act to address cultural problems in medicine, including bullying, more effectively.",

In most cases this is apparently sufficient but, if a pattern of behaviour emerges, it is followed by staged escalation [59] . It has proven to be feasible and effective in reducing bullying [60] , patient complaints [61] and poor IPC practices [62] and limits the need for more direct disciplinary action. It has been introduced or considered by several Australian hospitals [63] and the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons [64] .

We argue that this will not be achieved without the full support and participation of all healthcare professions, includingperhaps especiallydoctors. However, our findings suggest that improving doctors' IPC practices will require greater commitment from professional organisations and healthcare administrators to a) more appropriately measure, and inform clinicians about, the adverse effects for patients of non-adherence and b) effectively enforce appropriate policies and practices that prevent these harms. The poor IPC practices of some doctors are just one aspect of the broader issue of unprofessional behaviour and immunity from criticism that must be addressed, if the medical profession, in general, is to be seen to conform with its espoused professional values and those of the community that supports it.
