Nevertheless, MAbs potency is still relatively low when compared to conventional polyclonal Ab preparations. Moreover, the efficacy of an individual neutralizing MAb may significantly be hampered by the potential absence or modification of its target epitope in a mutant or subtype of the infectious agent. These limitations of individual neutralizing MAbs can be overcome by using oligoclonal combinations of several MAbs with different specificities to the target antigen. Studies conducted in our lab and by others show that such combined MAb preparation may present substantial synergy in its potency over the calculated additive potency of its individual MAb components. Moreover, oligoclonal preparation is expected to be better suited to compensating for reduced efficacy due to epitope variation. In this review, the synergistic neutralization properties of combined oligoclonal Ab preparations are described. The effect of Ab affinity, autologous Fc fraction, and targeting a critical number of epitopes, as well as the unexpected contribution of non-neutralizing clones to the synergistic neutralizing effect are presented and discussed.",

Serum therapy was commonly used to treat infectious diseases until the discovery of chemotherapy in the form of sulfonamide in the 1930s [4] . Antibiotics were less expensive and difficult to use, had significantly fewer adverse effects, and were not pathogen-specific, rendering the diagnosis of the microbial infection unnecessary before treatment; thus, serum therapy was pushed aside. However, the emergence of multi-drug-resistant forms of new and old pathogens and the recent explosion of the immunocompromised population worldwide have led to a necessary resurgence in the development of antibody-based therapeutics to treat and prevent this new wave of drug-resistant infectious diseases [5] . Furthermore, whereas antimicrobial drugs can kill the microbes but cannot eradicate pre-formed toxins, a specific antibody is the only compound that can neutralize a given toxin [3] . Therefore, antibodies remain attractive for therapeutic purposes.",

            "text": "However, modern polyclonal antibody (PAb)-based therapeutics, although improved compared with past serum therapies, continue to suffer from major limitations that might be elegantly overcome by MAb-based preparations. First, treatments with hyperimmune equine-or other animal-derived antisera are associated with substantial side effects, including hypersensitivity-related reactions such as serum sickness and anaphylaxis [6, 7] ; in addition, the use of human antisera involves the risk of blood-borne disease [8] . These safety limitations can be addressed by using human-derived or humanized MAb-based preparations that display a substantially decreased incidence of side effects and viral contamination [9, 10] . Humanization, the replacement of mouse constant regions and variable framework with human sequences, results in a product displaying significantly reduced immunogenicity and improved in vivo tolerability [11] . Human or humanized MAbs exhibiting enhanced pharmacokinetics enable the administration of a lower protein load and a reduced frequency of administration during the course of treatment. Second, PAb-based preparations exhibit significant batch-to-batch variability, and their supply is limited. In contrast, MAbs can be produced in vitro, thereby ensuring an unlimited supply of highly purified, well-characterized products that are devoid of contaminating proteins [8] .",

            "text": "Despite the potential of MAbs as powerful tools in the fields of infectious diseases and toxins, during the past 25 years, following the hybridoma revolution, out of the more than 30 immunoglobulins (IgGs) and their derivatives that have been approved for use for various indications [2] , only one MAb has been approved for the prevention of a viral infection (RSV) [12] , and one MAb has been approved in the U.S. for the treatment of bacterial toxin (anthrax) [13] . All others were clinically designed for the treatment of cancer and autoimmune or allergic conditions [14] . Although many MAbs have been purified and characterized for their protective efficacy against different toxins [3] , some of which are under investigation in clinical trials [7, 15] , PAbs remain almost the only available preparations for this indication. MAb-based therapy has some limitations. First, MAbs exhibit unprecedented specificity to their antigenic target, but this extreme specificity may hamper the efficacy of any individual MAb in the case of the absence or modification of its target epitope in a mutant or subtype of the infectious agent. Second, the potency of MAbs, especially those that play a role in the neutralization of pathogens and toxins, remains relatively low compared with PAb-based preparations. This inferior neutralizing potency of individual MAbs may be attributed to the differences in the functional impact of specific antigenic epitopes, to their low affinity to the target epitope, to the biochemical stability of each MAb molecule, or reduced clearance of the MAb-antigen immune-complexes (ICs). These two major limitations of individual MAb-based preparations, their low neutralizing potency and potential failure to treat mutants or subtypes, can be overcome by combining several MAbs to form a MAb cocktail. Moreover, as will be further discussed in details, recent studies show that such MAb cocktails exhibit synergistic neutralization; i.e., MAb cocktails display substantially elevated neutralizing activity that exceeds the level of improvement expected by the contribution of each MAb in the mixture. In fact, the neutralizing activity of MAb cocktails can be similar to the potency of PAb-based preparations.",

BoNTs, which serve as an excellent model for complex antigens against which MAbs are required, are produced by Clostridium botulinum strains and are considered the most lethal toxins identified, with an estimated human median lethal dose (HLD50) of 1 ng/kg body weight [17, 18] .

Indeed, in the last 30 years, many studies have evaluated two or more MAbs in various combinations to improve the efficacy of these potential therapeutics for infectious disease, primarily viruses and toxins (see Table 1 for a list of oligoclonal antibody-based preparations against various toxins). Most of these MAb combinations exerted additive or synergistic neutralizing effects, demonstrating their potential value as future therapies. When combining two or more drugs, such as anti-toxin MAbs, four outcomes can be expected: an additive effect, i.e., the summation of all individual neutralizing activities; antagonism, defined as a reduction in efficacy; indifference, i.e., one drug does not enhance or reduce the efficacy of the second drug; and synergism, in which the protective properties of the combined MAb preparation significantly exceed the additive effect of the components in the mixture.",

Chou and Talalay proposed a general diagnostic function to determine the applicability of experimental data and to distinguish between mutually exclusive and nonexclusive drugs and provided equations for analyzing and quantifying the synergism, summation and antagonism of multiple drugs [56] . The authors designated a \"combination index\" (CI), in which a value of <1, =1, or >1 indicates synergism, an additive effect (summation) or antagonism, respectively, for each drug combination. Similarly, Pohl et al. applied the fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) indices approach for the evaluation of drug combinations to characterize the interactions among multiple MAbs; similar to the CI, the interaction between two MAbs is considered to be synergistic if the FIC index is <1.0, additive if the FIC index is equal to 1, indifferent if the FIC index is between 1 and 2, and antagonistic if the FIC index is >2 [47] .",

The fold-reduction in the dose of each drug included in a synergistic combination at a given effect level, compared with the dose of each drug alone, can be calculated as the dose reduction index (DRI) [48] . The CI and the DRI also enable a useful comparison of the extent of efficacy enhancement between neutralizing MAb combinations in different studies. Although many of the studies involving MAb cocktails do not provide direct data regarding these values, in most of these studies (Table 1) , an enhancement in the neutralization of MAb combinations was detected compared with that of the individual MAb components. This enhancement is often referred to as 'synergism' by authors; however, although enhanced neutralizing effects are reported, it is difficult to compare the extent of this synergy among different studies due to various factors, including toxin biology and the nature of the neutralization assay, which can be conducted either in vivo (for instance, a mouse protection assay) or in vitro (cell toxicity assays, using different cell types). Thus, the information in the table was estimated after careful analysis in light of this 'fold-enhancement' (the terminology that we selected to describe the superiority of a MAb combination compared with its components). In some cases, inferring the difference in neutralization was not applicable.",

The best combination for anti-serotype E MAbs displayed a very high synergistic neutralizing activity of up to 400-fold over that of its components (Figure 1 ). The cocktail of anti-serotype A MAbs, which protected against 125,000 MsLD50 of toxin A, had a 154-fold improvement over the calculated additive effect of the mixture's components. Strikingly, the removal of three non-neutralizing MAbs from the 7-clonal anti-BoNT/A cocktail dramatically reduced the neutralizing activity.

What are the mechanisms underlying this antibody-mediated synergy? Toxin neutralization depends, at least in part, on functional \"neutralizing\" epitopes recognized by antibodies that interfere with the interaction of the toxin with the target cell, on the binding affinities of the antibodies, and on the quality of antibody-toxin complex clearance from the bloodstream. Accordingly, the induction of neutralizing synergism might be explained by at least three putative mechanisms: first, the simultaneous binding of interfering MAbs to multiple functional sites on the toxin; second, an increase in the affinity of the mixture of MAbs compared with each MAb component; and third, enhanced Fc-mediated clearance of antibody-toxin complexes from the serum due to multimeric antibody decoration of the toxin. Each of these three mechanistic explanations for this synergy may exert a partial influence in different MAb combinations and may be considered a different aspect of a tri-partite phenomenon; together, these three mechanisms may induce synergistic neutralization.",

For more than a century, toxins have been believed to be neutralized by antibodies not by indirect mediated measures but rather by a direct \"interfering\" antibody-dependent mechanism in which antibodies bind to toxins and interfere with their interactions with host cells, thus preventing the attachment of the toxin to the target cell or its enzymatic activity that might otherwise damage the target cell. Theoretically, for an antibody to interfere with a toxin, only the variable region of the antibody is required because it is the moiety that specifically recognizes and binds to its epitope on the target toxin. Thus, this binding alone is generally considered as \"neutralization\". The constant region (Fc) of an antibody is known to exert effector functions (ADCC, ADCP, CDC) and is thought to become activated by bacteria and tumor cells [2, 14] , but the involvement of these mechanisms in humoral anti-toxin responses is unclear. Alternative roles of Fc in the clearance of ICs and in antibody pharmacokinetics are discussed in Section 2.3.",

In a study in 2012, Chen et al. predicted that two MAbs, which recognized the protein and the ganglioside receptor binding domains, respectively, synergistically neutralized BoNTs. In this study, the investigators selected three neutralizing MAbs that recognized different non-overlapping epitopes of BoNT/B and compared the neutralizing effects of various antibody combinations. They found that a MAb that responded to the ganglioside receptor binding site synergized with the other two MAbs that recognized non-overlapping epitopes in Syt II (the protein receptor). However, the combination of the latter two MAbs did not exert a synergistic effect [30] . This example demonstrates that the combination of two MAbs that recognize distinct functional domains on BoNTs may represent the general principle for a potent synergistic effect. Interestingly, Chen et al. further analyzed the results generated by the lab of James Marks [22] , which developed MAbs for BoNT/A. They found that the neutralizing potency of one pair of MAbs (C25 + 3D12), which bind to the translocation domain and the sialoganglioside binding domain, respectively, was 10 times higher than that of another pair (S25 + 3D12), whose epitopes are located at the same functional domain. This finding provides additional evidence that a combination of MAbs that recognize different functional domains is more likely to synergize than a combination of MAbs recognizing the same functional domain [30] .",

Hu et al. generated four MAbs directed against the RTB subunit and found that all of them bound to conformational epitopes with a high affinity. When testing pairs of MAbs, they demonstrated a synergistic neutralization of ricin in vitro and in vivo. Hu et al. hypothesized that because the two RTB domains are homologous and are structurally similar, a single RTB-specific MAb may block both galactose binding pockets by binding to similar conformational epitopes sharing both domains and that the simultaneous binding of two MAbs likely synergistically interferes with ricin attachment to cells. In addition, the authors speculated that MAbs might bind to domains that interrupt the transport of RTA from the ER to the cytosol. They also determined that the synergistic effect of the MAb pairs depended on different ricin neutralization activities that were more related with their epitope specificities than their ricin-binding affinities and that were not related to their antibody isotypes [34] . In another ricin study, McGuiness et al. identified and characterized a murine IgG1 anti-RTB MAb (24B11). Using a Vero cell cytotoxicity assay, they compared 24B11 with a known anti-RTA MAb (R70) and found that 24B11 was approximately two-fold more effective at neutralizing ricin. The investigators studied the mechanism of action of these two MAbs and found that both 24B11 and R70 blocked ricin attachment to galactoside receptors, although R70 was directed against RTA [32] .",

Similar to BoNT, it is accepted that TeNT acts via a dual receptor model in which gangliosides and glycosylated proteins, such as the synaptic vesicle proteins SV2A and SV2B, are involved [74] . In one pioneering study of MAb combinations against toxins, Volk et al. evaluated the effect of MAbs on different TeNT subunits and found that all neutralizing MAbs bound to epitopes on the HC of TeNT (approximately half of them to the C-terminal region and half to the N-terminal region). When combining these MAbs, it was found that different cocktails of 2-4 MAbs exerted synergistic neutralization in vivo, resulting in up to 200-fold greater protection than the individual neutralizing MAbs.

For instance, Cheng et al. demonstrated that a combination of two MAbs, one directed against the LC (catalytic domain) of BoNT/A, and the other directed against the translocation domain, did not inhibit endopeptidase activity but, instead, blocked toxin entry into primary and cultured neuronal cells in a synergistic manner.

Similar to other superantigens, SEB simultaneously binds to major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II) molecules on antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and to T-cell receptors (TCRs) that incorporate V chains [50] . Blocking antibodies may prevent SEB from facilitating the formation of the MHC-II/SEB/TCR complex, thereby inhibiting this toxin. According to the crystal structures of complexes consisting of SEB and MHC-II or TCR, the two binding sites are spatially distinct from the contact areas [76] . Varshney et al. generated MAbs against SEB and evaluated different pairs of MAbs in which only one or none of the MAbs individually protected against SEB toxicity. The authors reported that protection was achieved when these MAb combinations were administered simultaneously.

            "text": "The correlation between antibody binding affinity and toxin neutralization is somewhat intuitive, as toxin blocking and the subsequent clearance of the formed ICs depend on the binding of antibodies to the toxin. Thus, one can easily conceive that adherence to the toxin would be more efficacious if the binding of the antibody to its epitope were stronger, thus prolonging the duration that this epitope is 'occupied', leading to more potent inhibition and clearance from the bloodstream. There are several indications that the neutralizing activity of antibodies is associated with their affinity to the target epitope. Indeed, in vivo assays conducted in our lab revealed that the neutralizing potency of MAbs against the three different BoNTs was associated with an increased affinity to the toxin, as all neutralizing MAbs exhibited the highest anti-toxin ELISA titer [16] . Pless et al. also reported that a common characteristic of all anti-BoNT/A-Hc neutralizing MAbs examined was a very high affinity [81] . In another anti-BoNT study, Amersdorfer et al. showed that the most potent anti-Hc scFv displayed the highest affinity for its epitope [82] . In accordance with this concept, Maynard et al. showed that the protection against anthrax toxin by recombinant antibody fragments was correlated with antigen affinity [83] . Likewise, Scott characterized a panel of anti-tetanus toxin scFvs and found that 14/15 clones neutralized toxin activity based on a ganglioside binding assay and that this effect was strongly related to the affinity of these clones [84] .",

Affinity, a measure of the strength of the noncovalent interaction between an antibody and its antigen [85] , is mathematically represented by the equilibrium constant (K) that characterizes the reversible binding of an antibody to an epitope on an antigen [86] . Affinity can be divided into 'intrinsic' and 'functional'. The term 'intrinsic affinity' characterizes systems involving monovalent interactions between one paratope and one epitope, while the term 'functional affinity', also known as 'avidity', refers to higher order complexes between bivalent or multivalent Abs and a number of binding sites per antigen [87] , and reflects the intrinsic affinity, the valence and the topological relationship between the antigenic determinants and the antibody combining sites [88] . The strength of multivalent interactions (functional affinity or avidity), usually exceeds, sometimes greatly, the corresponding intrinsic affinity [85, 86] . Multivalent linkages within ICs can be formed between either the same epitope expressed on separate antigens and Ab molecules of the same specificity (MAb), or between diverse epitopes and Abs with two or more specificities (such as in the case of natural immune reactions), which may have cooperative interactions between them, eventually leading to increase in the functional affinity.",

First, the binding of one bivalent MAb to two epitopes on two soluble antigens, thereby facilitating their cross-linking, increases the probability that a second MAb, specific for an independent epitope, could bind to two sites instead of to only one site [85] . This phenomenon was demonstrated 30 years ago by Moyle et al. for antibodies against human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). The authors found that some MAb pairs but not others displayed a higher affinity to the hormone than either MAb alone and that this increased affinity was associated with the formation of a stable circular complex consisting of two antibody molecules (each one of the two MAbs) and two hCG molecules [89] . Second, the increase in functional affinity observed for multiple MAbs may be due to a conformational change in the antigen that occurs upon the binding of the first MAb, resulting in a higher affinity of the second and third MAbs [22, 85] (illustrated in Figure 3) . Thus, the binding of the first antibody might induce a more stable conformation of the antigen that thermodynamically or entropically favors the binding of a subsequent antibody [84, 85] .",

Thus, any transient dissociation of one antibody arm from the toxin would result in rapid rebinding, as the other antibody bridge would prevent the antigen from diffusing away. This phenomenon would substantially increase antibody avidity, i.e., the combined strength of multiple bonding interactions, resulting in synergistic neutralization [46] .

Generally, the clearance of ICs following a polyclonal response occurs via two pathways, both of which involve antibody Fc. One clearing mechanism is mediated by Fc\u03b3-receptor (Fc\u03b3R) binding. The second mechanism is mediated by the complement system, which plays a crucial role in IC handling [96] . These two mechanisms can act independently [97] . Thus, antibody Fc-mediated clearance is thought to play an important role in toxin neutralization, as well.

For instance, Fc substantially contributes to IgG stabilization in the bloodstream primarily due to protection by the neonatal FcR (FcRn). FcRn plays a critical role in regulating the levels of circulating IgGs in rodents and higher species via strict pH-dependent IgG/FcRn binding [99] . The FcRn-bound antibody is thought to be protected from degradation, thereby increasing the half-life of IgG in serum. Therefore, the use of antitoxin agents that do not bear Fc (such as Fab, scFv, etc.) and thus display a shorter half-life than intact IgG would be expected to exhibit reduced efficacy due to a rapid decrease in the concentration of the antitoxin agent in the bloodstream, as demonstrated by BoNT toxicity studies [22, 70] . Nevertheless, in addition to the inferior potency of the F(ab')2 antitoxin, Mazuet et al. showed that in spite of its shorter half-life (10-fold), one F(ab')2 retained its neutralization efficacy compared with intact IgG. Interestingly, the MAb that was not affected by Fc deletion displayed a much higher affinity than the other MAb [70] .",

This protection suggests that a high dose of F(ab')2 may compensate for the lack of Fc-mediated mechanisms and may induce neutralization solely via toxin blocking. Furthermore, it is plausible that the addition of human Fc fragment to the equine F(ab')2 preparation would improve antitoxin efficacy and reduce the total amount of foreign protein administered to a patient. However, such manipulation is not applicable for polyclonal preparations and may be difficult to evaluate in animal models due to the variance in Fc\u03b3Rs and complement receptors (CRs) among species. Manipulation of Fc fragments is being performed on MAbs, enabling the examination of the role of Fc in neutralization in vivo. Recently, the generation and characterization of an Fc\u03b3R-humanized mouse that lacks all murine Fc\u03b3Rs was described; this model may enable the accurate prediction of the consequences of linking human Fc\u03b3Rs to IgGs for a particular biological response [100] . Recapitulation of the human-specific Fc\u03b3R expression pattern in this mouse model was used recently to assess the activity of anti-anthrax toxin MAbs containing specific Fc variants that selectively enhanced their affinity for particular human Fc\u03b3Rs [101] .",

Vitale et al. showed that F(ab')2 fragments of an anti-PA MAb were 10-to 100-fold less potent than the complete IgG in neutralizing anthrax toxin in vitro, even though they retained equivalent affinity for PA. The addition of FcR-blocking antibodies greatly reduced the activity of this MAb, and the neutralizing activity of mouse, rabbit, and human antisera elicited by PA vaccines was effectively abrogated by blocking FcRs. However, in vivo, significantly higher concentrations of F(ab')2 did protect against anthrax toxin cytotoxicity; thus, in vivo protection cannot be unambiguously attributed to the Fc-enhanced neutralization activity [102] . It is unclear whether this potency reduction in vivo is also attributed to the shorter half-life of the F(ab')2 fragments. This neutralizing activity was abrogated by FcR blockers for PAb and MAb treatment, implying that their potency is indeed FcR-dependent. Experiments conducted by Arturo Casadevall and colleagues have broadened our understanding of the function of Fc in anti-PA antibodies [103] . Abboud et al. generated identical variable regions and specific IgG2a and IgG2b variants of an IgG1 anti-PA MAb and found that the efficacy of antibody-mediated neutralization was dependent on the isotype and that this neutralization activity required a competent Fc\u03b3R. Furthermore, they showed that the IgG2a MAb prevented lethal toxin cytotoxicity more efficiently than the IgG1 MAb and that passive immunization with IgG1 and IgG2a MAb protected wild-type, but not Fc\u03b3R-deficient, mice against B. anthracis infection [103] . Nevertheless, the precise toxin neutralization mechanism after Fc\u03b3R engagement was unclear. The authors hypothesized that MAb PA-Fc\u03b3Rs ICs are endocytosed and sorted to lysosomes for degradation but suggested that the differences in efficacy between the isotypes implied a difference in Fc-mediated effector functions rather than defective endocytosis in mice deficient in Fc\u03b3Rs.",

            "text": "Recently, several studies conducted by the lab of Charles Shoemaker directly investigated the phenomenon of synergistic neutralization mediated by increased Fc valence (illustrated in Figure 4 ). Sepuldeva et al. proposed a novel concept in which BoNT neutralization is exerted by combinations of high-affinity epitope-tagged scFvs against BoNT/A, serving as the 'blocking' arm, and anti-tag MAbs containing Fc, serving as the 'clearing Fc' arm. In this manner, the investigators elegantly illuminated the critical contribution of Fc-mediated clearance of BoNTs to synergistic neutralization and dissected the function of Fc from other putative mechanisms. The authors showed that for individual non-neutralizing scFvs, the addition of additional clearing Fcs synergistically increased the level of protection against BoNT/A. Thus, when an scFv contained two copies of the tag (i.e., two 'clearing Fcs' for each 'blocking arm') instead of one, protection against the toxin was approximately 10-fold enhanced, approximately the same fold-change as the addition of a different scFv. The improvement achieved by the inclusion of an additional tag likely resulted from further Fc decoration of the toxin. Following that study, the definitive role of Fc-mediated clearance in synergistic activity was demonstrated by pharmacokinetic studies showing that BoNT/A was rapidly cleared from the sera of mice administered a pool of anti-BoNT/A scFvs and a clearing Fc but not from the sera of mice administered either the scFvs or the clearing Fc alone. Moreover, the efficacy and clearance profile of this mixture of a neutralizing dose of scFvs combined with an anti-tag clearing Fc was comparable to that of a polyclonal antitoxin serum [24] . . Schematic illustration of the Fc-mediated clearance of antibody-toxin complexes via multimeric antibody decoration of the toxin. The clearance of ICs occurs via FcR and CR pathways, both involve antibody Fc. Low-affinity FcRs on resident macrophages bind to antibody-antigen complexes with a high avidity but do not bind to monomeric antibody-antigen ICs at a detectable affinity. In addition, larger IgG-toxin ICs are much more efficiently cleared from the bloodstream. Thus, a MAb cocktail might mimic a polyclonal reaction by forming large ICs with multiple Fc toxin decoration, resulting in a substantial enhanced antibody-toxin complexes clearance. The figure illustrates binding of multiple Fcs with high avidity to FcRs (b), as opposed to low affinity binding of a single MAb Fc (a).",

The authors generated small (12 kDa) and stable camelid heavy-chain-only Ab VH (VHH) domains against BoNT/A. These VHHs were used as antitoxins via the co-administration of recombinant high-affinity anti-BoNT tagged VHH and an anti-tag clearing Fc. The authors compared neutralizing or non-neutralizing binding VHHs administered with or without clearing Fc to evaluate the relative contributions of toxin blocking and clearance to antitoxin activity. A cocktail of up to three VHHs, each containing one tag, administered with an anti-tag clearing Fc was insufficient to induce efficient clearance. However, a heterodimer consisting of two non-neutralizing monomeric VHH units, each containing two tags instead of one, enabled the simultaneous binding of four Fc domains to the toxin. The resulting toxin clearance dramatically enhanced the protection of mice from virtually no protection in the absence of the clearing Fc to complete protection against 1000 MsLD50 of BoNT/A. Furthermore, a comparison of the antitoxin efficacy between neutralizing and non-neutralizing VHH agents in the presence or absence of the anti-tag clearing Fc revealed that the neutralizing VHHs were highly effective in the absence of clearance (and were improved in the presence of the clearing Fc), whereas non-neutralizing VHHs depended on the clearing Fc for efficient neutralization [23] .",

            "text": "The significance of Fc valence for toxin clearance from the circulation was recently shown using red blood cells (RBCs) mediated toxin sequestration [28] . Opsonization of particulate pathogens by antibodies and complement can lead to their binding to the complement receptor1 (CR1), specific for C3b, on primate erythrocytes. This immune adherence may prevent pathogens from leaving the bloodstream and facilitate their destruction by liver macrophages [107] . Ronald Taylor and colleagues used MAbs specific for CR1 cross-linked with pathogen specific MAbs to generate heteropolymers (HPs) which can bind a wide range of substrates to primate erythrocytes, and imitate the natural clearance mechanism of C3b-opsonized substrates bound to erythrocyte CR1. In this way, Fc receptors on the phagocytic cell engage the erythrocyte-bound complex, CR1 is removed by proteolysis, and the entire immune complex and CR1 are internalized while sparing the erythrocyte [107] . The HP methodology was recently applied by Sharma et al. that used BoNT as a model system in an attempt to enhance toxin rather than particulate pathogen neutralization. They converted a pair of BoNT specific MAbs into HPs and tested them in transgenic mice expressing human CR1 on RBC membranes. The authors reported that two HPs given in combination had 166-fold greater potency than un-modified MAbs, capable of neutralizing 5000 MsLD50 BoNT/A. The ICs formed with an HP and an un-modified MAb were less potent than those formed with two HPs. In addition, peritoneal macrophages internalized BoNT better when it was bound to two HPs rather than to an HP + MAb or MAb + MAb combination, independent of whether the HP pair contained a CR1-binding or nonbinding control MAb. This may indicate that enhanced BoNT clearance from the blood circulation by fixed tissue macrophages is attributed to the opsonization of multiple Fc domains in the HP complexes [28] .",

However, the antigenic variability of toxins (and pathogens in general) and the relatively low efficacy of individual antitoxin MAbs limit their utility as therapeutics. One rational solution to overcome these limitations would be to combine MAbs into therapeutic cocktails to mimic safe polyclonal responses. Until recently, this option was difficult to implement due to regulatory and cost concerns [47] . Nevertheless, efforts in recent years to produce effective MAb cocktails for post-exposure rabies and botulinum prophylaxis [15, 108] have established an important precedent by increasing the relevance of the use of MAb combinations against toxins and infectious diseases.",

In this review, we described a body of evidence supporting three potential mechanisms underlying synergistic neutralization by MAb combinations: (1) the simultaneous binding of interfering MAbs to multiple functional sites of the toxin, facilitating the significant blockade of two or more essential epitopes that react with the target cell, thus dramatically reducing the potency of the toxin; (2) a dramatic increase in the affinity of the combination of MAbs compared with each MAb component, correlating with neutralization; and (3) Fc-mediated clearance of antibody-toxin ICs from the serum, which is enhanced by the multimeric antibody Fc decoration of the toxin. It is plausible that these three mechanisms complement each other and that the combination of these mechanisms mediates the enhanced cooperative activity of MAb cocktails.",

One conclusion may be that screening for toxin-neutralizing MAbs should involve high-affinity MAb combinations to avoid overlooking MAbs that individually display low or no neutralizing activity.",

            "text": "a comprehensive study conducted by the lab of James Marks, Nowakowski et al. elegantly linked synergistic toxin neutralization to an enhanced affinity of MAbs to BoNT/A HC and demonstrated that although no single MAb effectively neutralized the toxin, combinations of three MAbs resulted in significant neutralization both in vivo and in vitro. Significant synergy in toxin neutralization was detected for pairs of MAbs compared with each individual MAb in vitro (mouse hemidiaphragm assay) based on a significant increase in the time to neuroparalysis. The authors further showed that a large increase in the affinity of the MAb cocktail likely resulted in increased toxin neutralization potency. This result was demonstrated by determining the functional binding affinities for each single MAb, each pair of MAbs, and the mixture of all three MAbs. Strikingly, when one MAb (C25) was mixed with a second MAb (3D12), the resulting affinity of the MAb combination was 200-and 10-fold higher than the individual MAbs alone, respectively. The equimolar cocktail of all three MAbs (addition of MAb S25to the other two) further increased the affinity by 4-fold. Interestingly, the affinity of the pair of MAbs C25 and S25 was only 2-fold higher that the single MAb affinities, and this pair was less potent in vivo compared with the other pair consisting of MAbs C25 and 3D12. Moreover, the magnitude of the increase in the in vivo neutralization potency of the different MAb combinations paralleled the increase in functional affinity. Thus, the neutralization potency of individual MAbs and mixtures of MAbs could be predicted based on the equilibrium binding equation according to the affinity data alone. The authors reported a synergistic effect resulting in a more than 20,000-fold increase in potency for the three-MAb combination compared with any individual MAb[22].",

The binding of multiple MAbs to a multisite antigen may result in a substantial increase in overall affinity via two basic mechanisms. (a) Upper panel: The binding of anti-E1 MAb to E1 epitopes on two soluble antigens facilitates their cross-linking, thereby increases the probability that an anti-E2 MAb would bind to two sites instead of to only one site. (b) Lower panel: A conformational change in the antigen upon the binding of anti-E2 MAb that thermodynamically favors the binding of ananti-E1 MAb. Thus, in the presence of MAb2, MAb1 binds E'1 with a substantial lower Kd. E1-epitope 1, E'1-epitope 1 following a conformational change of the toxin as a result of MAb2 adherence to epitope 2 (E2).",

The clearance of ICs occurs via FcR and CR pathways, both involve antibody Fc. Low-affinity FcRs on resident macrophages bind to antibody-antigen complexes with a high avidity but do not bind to monomeric antibody-antigen ICs at a detectable affinity. In addition, larger IgG-toxin ICs are much more efficiently cleared from the bloodstream. Thus, a MAb cocktail might mimic a polyclonal reaction by forming large ICs with multiple Fc toxin decoration, resulting in a substantial enhanced antibody-toxin complexes clearance. The figure illustrates binding of multiple Fcs with high avidity to FcRs (b), as opposed to low affinity binding of a single MAb Fc (a).",
