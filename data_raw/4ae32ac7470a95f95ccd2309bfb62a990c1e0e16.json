            "text": "The discovery of new viruses has been boosted in the last decade by high-throughput sequencing methods. These techniques can generate tens of thousands of sequence reads directly from a clinical sample, and sequence alignment tools subsequently can reveal the presence of previously unknown viruses. The main limitation of these viral metagenomics techniques is that the detection of sequence reads derived from a viral genome does not necessarily indicate that the virus is pathogenic, in the absence of information on phenotypic properties such as infectivity, cell tropism, and the ability to induce the immune system. 1 Once a new virus is identified, the fulfillment of Koch's postulates is needed to establish the role of the virus in disease. A virus culture stage is thus needed to obtain relatively pure virus stocks for inoculation in an animal model. Virus culturing remains a major bottleneck. In the 20th century, virus research and identification were for a large part limited to those agents that could be cultured in conventional cell lines. More recently, powerful sequencing methods allow the identification of new viruses in clinical samples, for which a virus culture as amplification step is no longer required. The downside is that without a virus culture, it is not possible to formally fulfill the Koch's postulates. As a result, one can describe, at most, a disease association, either by a higher viral prevalence in infected subjects compared to controls or by seroconversion to the agent during the course or following the disease. 2 Well-differentiated pseudostratified airway epithelium is formed by culturing of primary human airway epithelial cells (HAE) at an air-liquid interface. The morphology and functionality of the cells resemble those of the human airways, and this system has been used to culture a wide range of respiratory viruses, for example, influenzavirus A, 3 parainfluenza virus, 4 respiratory syncytial virus, 5 adenovirus, 6 and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. 7 Furthermore, some of the viruses which have recently been described can be cultured on these cells, whereas all regular cell lines are not permissive. [8] [9] [10] These results collectively suggest that the HAE cultures are a very promising tool for universal respiratory virus discovery.",

There is, however, one pitfall with HAE cultures. Even with a fast replicating respiratory virus, a cytopathic effect is rarely observed. Some influenzavirus A strains cause cell death, but the majority of infections do not change the epithelial layer. Thus, HAE should be combined with a virus detection, for which we propose immunostaining with convalescent serum collected from the same patient obtained a few weeks after the respiratory infection. This serum will likely contain substantial antibody titers against the virus that caused the respiratory illness a few weeks earlier.",

But the acquisition of essential additional knowledge that is needed to address the pathogenicity of a novel virus is lagging behind. 22, 23 The discovery of a novel human virus should preferably be accompanied by serology (seroconversion to the virus between the acute and convalescent phase of the disease), an association with disease (more frequent detection in disease cases compared to healthy controls), and ideally a virus culture system as the first requirement in fulfilling the Koch's postulates. In this study, we present a combination of a virus culture method and a virus discovery tool that allows the identification of respiratory viruses that 1) have elicited an immune response and 2) are able to infect cells that match the affected organ from which the clinical specimens were originally obtained. Three clinical samples were used to evaluate the combined culture-virus-discovery tool. For all three viruses, staining of the infected HAE cells by convalescent serum from the patients was positive, and the apical washes were investigated by VIDISCA-454, a sequence-independent virus discovery tool that can detect RNA and DNA viruses. 12 The sequence reads provide a high genome coverage. This provides the opportunity of identifying viruses that are highly divergent from known viruses because the inclusion of a conserved domain is more likely. Of each apical wash, only a few thousand sequence reads were sufficient. The low number of reads needed to identify the cultured virus has the advantage that many samples can be analyzed in parallel in a single 454 run (approximately 150 samples per run), which makes the assay only moderately expensive. One should note, however, that this combined assay is currently not suitable to be used in a high-throughput setting, because of the significant hands-on time and expert experience needed to prepare the HAE cell cultures. On the other hand, the availability of a culture method is enormously beneficial for follow-up studies as it provides the progeny virus material, for example, for inoculation of animals to fulfill the postulates of Koch.",

Advanced intestinal epithelial culture systems have been developed of which the Human Intestinal Organoid system is promising for virus replication. 24 This could be combined with staining and virus discovery to identify only those viruses that infect human cells in the intestine. We recently published a virus discovery tool that relies on antibody capture, 25 thereby circumventing the problem that food-related viruses can be mistaken for human pathogens.

Three respiratory samples, S2705 (HCoV-OC43), I2125 (influenzavirus A, H3N2), and E1517 (influenzavirus B), were used to inoculate human airway epithelial (HAE) cell cultures. The cells were fixed 96 or 120 hours post-inoculation with 4% PFA and immunostained with the autologous antibody derived from respective patients (red) and mouse monoclonal anti-\u00df-tubulin IV (green), and examined by confocal microscopy. The difference in intensity of tubulin staining represents experimental variation in differentiation (S2705 versus E1517) or a difference in focus depth (I2125, below the apical surface).
