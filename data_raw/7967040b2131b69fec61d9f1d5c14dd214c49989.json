As such, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is responding to this through the establishment of the ASEAN-Network for Drugs, Diagnostics, Vaccines, and Traditional Medicines Innovation (ASEAN-NDI). This is important in the ASEAN considering that infectious tropical diseases remain prevalent, emerging, and reemerging in the region. This paper looks into the evolution of the ASEAN-NDI from its inception in 2009, to how it is at present, and its plans to mitigate public health problems regionally and even globally.",

            "text": "The ASEAN-NDI will coordinate research by partnering with research networks, developing capacity-building initiatives, supporting R&D infrastructural improvement, advocating for more research investment, and enhancing regional access to health products. It will start by enhancing collaboration among the ASEAN member states to address the specific health needs of the ASEAN, but collaboration with other countries will soon follow. This is consistent with the GSPA-PHI goal of making a network of networks wherein the ASEAN-NDI can partner up with other NDIs (ANDI, China-NDI, India-NDI, etc.) that have been established and form the nucleus for South-South collaboration [6] . With a number of NTDs and vector-borne diseases which affect both the African and Asian regions [20] [21] [22] , network collaboration will be helpful in developing and conducting R&D projects which result in programs and policies which address such public health threats. Likewise, with their expertise in traditional medicine development, the India and China NDIs can help the ASEAN-NDI form its strategies in advancing the ASEAN's own traditional medicine.",
