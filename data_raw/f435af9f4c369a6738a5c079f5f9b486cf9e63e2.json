            "text": "Vaccination regimes against Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), which are based on a single virus serotype, often induce insufficient levels of cross-protection against serotypes and two or more antigenically diverse vaccines are used in attempt to provide broader protection. Amino acid differences in the surface protein, spike (S), in particular the S1 subunit, are associated with poor cross-protection. Here, homologous vaccination trials with recombinant IBVs (rIBVs), based on the apathogenic strain, BeauR, were conducted to elucidate the role of S1 in protection. A single vaccination of specific-pathogen-free chickens with rIBV expressing S1 of virulent strains M41 or QX, BeauR-M41(S1) and BeauR-QX(S1), gave incomplete protection against homologous challenge, based on ciliary activity and clinical signs. There could be conformational issues with the spike if heterologous S1 and S2 are linked, suggesting a homologous S2 might be essential. To address this, a homologous vaccinationchallenge trial incorporating rIBVs expressing full spike from M41, BeauR-M41(S), and S2 subunit from M41, BeauR-M41(S2) was conducted. All chimeric viruses grew to similar titers in vitro, induced virus-specific partial protective immunity, evident by cellular infiltrations, reductions in viral RNA load in the trachea and conjunctiva and higher serum anti-IBV titers. Collectively, these findings show that vaccination with rIBVs primed the birds for challenge but the viruses were cleared rapidly from the mucosal tissues in the head. Chimeric S1 and S2 viruses did not protect as effectively as BeauR-M41(S) based on ciliary activity and clinical signs. Booster vaccinations and an rIBV with improved in vivo replication may improve the levels of protection. IMPORTANCE Infectious bronchitis virus causes an acute, highly contagious respiratory disease, responsible for significant economic losses to the poultry industry. Amino acid differences in the surface protein, spike (S), in particular the S1 subunit, have been associated with poor cross-protection. Available vaccines give poor cross-protection and rationally designed live attenuated vaccines, based on apathogenic BeauR, could address these. Here, to determine the role of S1 in protection, a series of homologous vaccination trials with rIBVs were conducted. Single vaccinations with chimeric rIBVs induced virus-specific partial protective immunity, characterized by reduction in viral load and serum antibody titers. However, BeauR-M41(S) was the only vaccination to improve the level of protection against clinical signs and the loss of tracheal ciliary activity. Growth characteristics show that all of the rIBVs replicated in vitro to similar levels. Booster vaccinations and an rIBV with improved in vivo replication may improve the levels of protection.",

To determine whether a single vaccination with rIBV expressing the S1 subunit of the S gene (with a Beaudette derived S2 subunit) was sufficient to induce protection against challenge with homologous pathogenic isolates of IBV, a vaccination/challenge trial was conducted with BeauR-M41(S1) and BeauR-QX(S1). No clinical signs nor loss of ciliary activity in the trachea were observed in either of the vaccinated groups after vaccination (data not shown). These results showed that replacement of the BeauR S1 gene with the S1 gene from pathogenic strains did not confer pathogenicity to the resulting BeauR-M41(S1) and BeauR-QX(S1) viruses.",

The major surface protein of IBV, S, is a type 1 glycoprotein which oligomerizes to form trimers (7) and is thought to be the main inducer of protective immunity (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) . The S protein is proteolytically cleaved into two subunits, the N-terminal subunit S1 (approximately 500 to 550 amino acids, 90 kDa) and the C-terminal subunit, S2 (630 amino acids, 84 kDa), which contains the transmembrane domain. The S1 subunit plays a critical role in binding to cellular receptors since it contains the receptor binding domain (13, 14) , determines the virus serotype, and is responsible for the induction of neutralizing antibodies (14) (15) (16) . Multiple studies have shown that recombinant S1 expressed in adenovirus and Newcastle disease virus vectors can induce a certain level of protection in specified-pathogen-free (SPF) chickens against challenge with wildtype virus (11, 17, 18) .",

            "text": "Vaccine programs against IBV often include a combination of live or inactivated vaccines which are based on several dominant field serotypes of the virus. The current vaccines often induce insufficient cross-protection, and combinations of antigenically different vaccines are used in an effort to improve levels of protection (19) . Alongside this, with the continual emergence of new field strains the control of IBV is persistently a significant problem to the poultry industry. A reverse genetics system based on the avirulent strain of IBV Beaudette has been developed (20, 21) . This system has many potential applications, such as to enhance our understanding of the role of individual genes in pathogenicity and to lead to a new generation of rationally designed live attenuated vaccines (20) . Previous work using the reverse genetics approach demonstrated that replacement of the ectodomain of the S glycoprotein of the apathogenic IBV Beaudette strain with the same region from either of two pathogenic IBV strains, M41-CK or 4/91, resulted in two nonvirulent rIBVs, BeauR-M41(S) and BeauR-4/91(S), respectively. Notably, both rIBVs based on the BeauR backbone acquired the same cell tropism of that of the donor S, M41-CK or 4/91 (22, 23) . Other work demonstrated that the Beaudette S2 subunit confers the unique ability of Beaudette to replicate in African green monkey kidney (Vero) cells, a continuous cell line licensed for vaccine production (24, 25) . Vaccination with BeauR-M41(S) or BeauR-4/91(S) can confer protection against homologous challenge based on ciliary activity, reductions in clinical signs and viral load in the trachea at 5 days postchallenge (dpc), further demonstrating the dominant role of the S glycoprotein in inducing protective immunity (23, 26) .",

Vaccination with rIBV expressing homologous S1 and S2 subunits (i.e., full S gene) in the Beaudette backbone induced partial protection classified by the level of ciliary activity and presence of clinical signs following challenge with wild-type IBV. Comparison of in vitro growth characteristics shows that inclusion of a foreign S gene or a chimeric S gene in the rIBVs does not impede replication in vitro. However, our data show that despite the ability to induce a degree of virus-specific protective immunity, the rIBVs are hindered by limited in vivo replication and the attenuated BeauR backbone. cellular infiltrates in both the Harderian gland and the conjunctiva-associated lymphoid tissue (CALT) at 2 dpv ( Fig. 3A to D), with areas of CALT more prominent in vaccinated tissues compared to mock-treated samples (Mock) (Fig. 3E) .

Higher IBV-specific serum antibody titers compared to challenge-only controls shows that vaccination with chimeric rIBVs was able to prime the birds for challenge. Whether the lack of full protection against the loss of ciliary activity and clinical signs was due to the absence of a homologous S2 subunit or an incorrect folding of M41/QX (S1) and BeauR rIBV Partially Protects against IBV Journal of Virology (S2)-and therefore lower infectivity-could not be answered in this study. Therefore, a second trial addressing the issue of whether a homologous S2 is required for protection was conducted. Relative contribution of S1 and S2 to homologous protection. In trial 2, the rIBVs used were BeauR-M41(S), BeauR-M41(S1), and BeauR-M41(S2) (described in Fig. 1) , with an experimental design similar to that used for trial 1. No clinical signs were observed in any of the vaccinated groups after vaccination (data not shown). After vaccination, there was no loss of ciliary activity in the trachea, indicating the apathogenicity of the rIBVs (data not shown). Similar to trial 1, at 21 dpv the chickens were challenged with M41-CK. Clinical signs were observed until 7 dpc; BeauR-M41(S) was the only vaccinated group to show less prevalent clinical signs postchallenge compared to the M41-CK challenge control ( Fig. 6A and B). There was little difference between the BeauR-M41(S1), BeauR-M41(S2), and M41-CK groups in terms of the presence and severity of clinical signs ( Fig. 6A and B ), but in the vaccinated groups clinical signs resolved more rapidly compared to the M41-CK controls. Ciliary activity was assessed at 4 dpc, and FIG 5 Measurement of serum anti-IBV titers of BeauR-M41(S1)-and BeauR-QX(S1)-vaccinated groups. Serum titers were assessed by commercial ELISA at 2 dpc (A) and 4 dpc (B) and in M41 groups at 14 dpc (C) and QX groups at 14 dpc (D).

Noteworthy, assessment on an individual bird level showed that three of five birds in the BeauR-M41(S) were classed as \"protected against ciliostasis\"; however, since the group average was 60%, this does not translate into protection on a group level ( Table 2 ). Viral RNA loads in the tracheas and CALTs isolated from challenged chickens were determined by qPCR to elucidate whether the S1 and S2 subunits played any further role in conferring protection. At 2 dpc only the CALT from BeauR-M41(S)-and BeauR-M41(S2)-vaccinated chickens showed any significant reduction (P \u03fd 0.001) in viral RNA load compared to the challenge control (Fig. 7A) . However, at 4 dpc all groups had significantly lower viral RNA loads in the CALT ( [P \u03fd 0.05, BeauR-M41(S) and BeauR-M41(S2), P \u03fd 0.01, BeauR-M41(S1)]. Failure to locate the rIBVs in the head-associated lymphoid and respiratory tissues at 2 dpv in trial 1 led to the inclusion of the 1-dpv time point in trial 2. BeauR-M41(S), BeauR-M41(S1), and BeauR-M41(S2) were detected by RT-PCR in a number of the Harderian glands and tracheas isolated from chickens at 1 dpv; however, at 2 and 4 dpv the rIBVs were mainly detected in the nasal turbinates (Table 3) , suggesting rapid clearance of rIBVs from the mucosal head tissues and sites of inoculation. Although the titers of infectious challenge virus recovered from tracheas at 4 dpc were not significantly reduced in BeauR-M41(S)-, BeauR-M41(S1)-, and BeauR-M41(S2)-vaccinated chickens compared to controls (because of the variation within each group), there was a general trend that vaccination resulted in a reduction in viral infectivity, with no detected infectious virus recovered in four of five birds in the S group, three of five birds in the S1 group, and one of five birds in the S2 group (Fig. 7E ). Collectively, this shows that the chimeric rIBVs are able to induce a degree of local protection against the replication of IBV in the trachea.",

These rIBVs have the advantage rIBV Partially Protects against IBV Journal of Virology of being able to replicate in Vero cells, potentially allowing large-scale vaccine production in cell culture rather than in embryonated eggs. In this first vaccination study, using a single dose of BeauR-M41(S1) or BeauR-QX(S1) in 1-week-old chicks, the birds were not protected against homologous challenge based on ciliary activity and clinical signs. Vaccination with BeauR-QX(S1) induced significantly higher serum titers postchallenge, and the clinical signs associated with challenge virus, although present, decreased rapidly compared to unvaccinated birds challenged with QX. Together, these data show that vaccination with chimeric rIBVs are able to induce a degree of virus-specific immunity with partial local protection in the mucosal head tissues and the primary site of replication, the trachea.",

One-week-old birds were immunized once with BeauR-M41(S), BeauR-M41(S1), or BeauR-M41(S2). Replacement of the apathogenic BeauR-S1 or S2 subunits with a S1 or S2 from a pathogenic strain, allowed BeauR to remain apathogenic, suggesting that the S1 or S2 alone do not play a role in the pathogenicity of IBV. This further expands our previous work showing that spike switching of BeauR-S with M41-S had no effect on pathogenicity (23) . Here, vaccination of chickens with a rIBV based on a BeauR backbone expressing a full S gene from the donor serotype enhanced the level of protection afforded against tracheal ciliostasis, with three of five birds classed as fully protected. However, when classified under European Pharmacopeia standards for assessment of IBV vaccines (28), at which 80% protection (at a group level) against ciliostasis is required, the BeauR-M41(S)-vaccinated group was only able to confer partial protection (\u03f360%) and therefore is still not satisfactory for the criteria used for the assessment of IBV vaccines for industrial application. Consistent with previously published work, we show that collectively as a group the chickens vaccinated via ocular-nasal routes with BeauR-M41(S) had \u03f360% ciliary activity remaining, a reduction in clinical signs, and viral load postchallenge (26) . The protection seen at the trachea may potentially be improved with assessment of ciliostasis at a later time point, as Armesto et al. (23) reported that vaccination with BeauR-4/91(S) gave \u03f360% ciliary activity at 4 dpc, which then improved to 90 to 100% at 6 dpc. In trial 1 the viral RNA load in the trachea and CALT from the S1-vaccinated groups was reduced at 2 dpc, whereas in trial 2 all vaccinated groups had a clear significant reduction in viral RNA loads at 2 and 4 dpc in the trachea and CALT. The qPCR used here is designed to detect the 5= untranslated region (5= UTR) of the genome (29) , and it therefore may be detecting incomplete virions or challenge virus captured in the lumen of the trachea. To further support the viral RNA load data, infectious viral load recovered from the trachea in both trials 1 and 2 were lower in rIBV-vaccinated chickens, indicating a degree of local protection at the site of infection, which was not robust enough to completely protect against viral replication in vivo and the loss of ciliary activity.",

In the coronavirus replication cycle, the spike mediates the critical steps of receptor binding and membrane fusion. Upon binding of the S1 receptor binding domain to the host cell, an irreversible conformational switch to the postfusion state allows the S2 subunit to fuse viral and cellular membranes, facilitating entry of the viral genome and therefore downstream viral replication (32) (33) (34) . Recently, the crystal structure of the prefusion spike from mouse hepatitis virus and human coronavirus (HKU1) were resolved, highlighting the critical role that the interaction between the trimers of S1 and S2 plays in stabilization of the prefusion conformation of spike (31, 32) . Here, expression of a chimeric spike in a recombinant IBV backbone with the lack of a homologous S2 possibly resulted in conformational changes either within the S1 subunit or complete S protein, potentially affecting receptor binding and entry, but may have also altered immunogenic epitopes. The S2 subunits of BeauR shares 87 and 97% amino acid sequence similarities with QX and M41-CK, respectively, showing that there are only a few different amino acid residues between them. The interactions between S1 and S2 subunits are critical for the maintenance of conformation, recognition, and efficient fusion of the spike to host cells; it has been consistently shown that even a single amino acid change within the S2 subunit of coronavirus spikes may influence the secondary structure of the overall spike or the S1 subunit (35, 36) .",

Replacement of the BeauR S1 or S2 with corresponding subunits from a pathogenic strain did not indicate a significant impairment of in vitro growth of the viruses in comparison to the BeauR virus, showing no indication that BeauR-M41(S1) and BeauR-M41(S2) were unable to enter the cells, fuse with cell membranes, or fail to replicate in vitro. Nevertheless, the lack of full protection afforded by BeauR rIBVs against wild-type challenge and the limited in vivo replication strongly suggest that attenuations have occurred in genes playing an essential role in replication and that these are negatively impacting its suitability as a vaccine vector.

            "text": "Live attenuated vaccines against IBV need to induce a good level of mucosal immunity, with local tracheal and cell-mediated immunity also playing an important role in prevention of IBV infection (39) (40) (41) . As discussed earlier, the BeauR backbone is impeded by poor in vivo replication, and the lack of protection shown against ciliostasis indicates that there is a poor level of local immunity induced in the trachea by vaccination with BeauR rIBVs. Cytotoxic responses can also play a key role in the early control of IBV, as indicated by previous studies showing NK cell activation (42), IBV-specific cytotoxic T-cell-lymphocyte (CTL) activity of splenocytes isolated from IBV-infected chickens (41) , and higher CTL proportions in respiratory tissues following IBV infection (43) . Cellular infiltrates in head-associated lymphoid tissues, as well as a reduction in viral load in the trachea and CALT, also imply that the rIBVs infected the chickens and suggests a possible role for the cell-mediated response. However, that we were unable to consistently detect the recombinant S1 viruses at 2 dpv raises possibilities that the viruses were either rapidly cleared from the tissues, replicate poorly at these sites of inoculation, or have limited replication in a few cells which are below detectable limits of the assays. In the BeauR-M41(S)-vaccinated group, more than 50% of the chickens were positive for vaccine virus, as assessed by RT-PCR, in the Harderian gland and nasal turbinates at 1 and 2 dpv, respectively. The primary site of IBV infection is thought to be the ciliated epithelium lining the trachea; however, following ocularnasal vaccination, the virus has been detected in the nasal turbinates (44) and Harderian gland (45) .",

Previous studies using baculovirus expressed IBV recombinant proteins or IBV purified proteins have required multiple injections to achieve a degree of protection in SPF chickens (10, 17) . There is also evidence of an impaired humoral response in young chicks with regard to IBV vaccination; vaccination of 1-and 7-day-old chicks showed a delay in both systemic and local IgA and IgG levels compared to vaccination of older chicks (14, 21, or 28 days old) (46) .

This was characterized by a reduction in the viral load recovered from the trachea and CALT, cellular infiltrations at head mucosal and inoculation sites, higher serum antibody titers in vaccinated groups, and the induction of virus-neutralizing activity. Vaccination with BeauR-M41(S), despite expressing the homologous full S to attempt to overcome any issues with heterologous S1 and S2 subunits and suboptimal folding, only induce a partially protection against the loss of ciliary activity. Since the in vitro growth characteristics show that inclusion of a foreign S gene or a chimeric S gene in the rIBVs does not impede replication in vitro, perhaps the attenuated Beaudette backbone has hindered the in vivo replication of these rIBVs; thus, to improve protection, multiple vaccinations, or an alternative backbone may be required.",

Serum samples collected at 21 dpv (prechallenge) and at 2, 4, and 14 dpc were assayed with a commercial IDEXX IBV antibody test kit (IDEXX Laboratories). To determine the endpoint titer, the serum samples were twofold serially diluted in the range 1:20 to 1:2,560 prior to rIBV Partially Protects against IBV Journal of Virology incubation. After sample incubation, the remaining steps were followed directly according to the manufacturer's instructions. The sample/positive (S/P) ratio was calculated using by the following equation: [(mean sample -mean kit negative)/(mean kit positive -mean kit negative)]. S/P ratios greater than 0.2 were considered positive for IBV antibodies. Polyclonal chicken serum raised against M41 and QX serum were included on each independent test plate (GD Animal Health). Immunocytochemistry. For fluorescent microscopy, cryostat sections (5 m) were fixed in acetone, washed in PBS, and blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 10% normal goat serum and 0.5% bovine serum albumin in PBS (blocking buffer). Slides were washed and incubated for 1 h with optimally diluted primary antibodies (anti-Bu-1 [clone AV-20; AbD Serotec], anti-CD8\u2423 [clone 3-298, AbD Serotec], and anti-CD8\u2424 [clone EP42, AbD Serotec]) and anti-CSF1R (55) or isotype controls, all diluted in blocking buffer. Sections were washed, incubated with an Alexa Fluor 488-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG1/ IgG2a or Alexa Fluor 568-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG1/IgG2b according to the appropriate isotype, and diluted in blocking buffer for 1 h. Nuclei were visualized using DAPI (4=,6=-diamidino-2phenylindole (Invitrogen). Images were captured with a Leica DMLB fluorescence microscope with a coupled device digital camera and analyzed using ImageJ analysis software. For light microscopy, cryostat sections (5 m) were fixed in acetone and stained with Harris' hematoxylin (Sigma-Aldrich) and 1% eosin (Sigma-Aldrich). Sections were dehydrated through graded ethanols and xylene and mounted in a xylene-based medium (DePex; Gurr-BDH Chemicals). Images were captured with a Hamamatsu Nano-zoomer-XR digital slide scanner.",

After culture with M41 for 3 to 4 days at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO 2 , cell monolayers were examined for cytopathic effect (CPE).

Differences between the groups were statistically evaluated by the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test adjusted for post hoc analysis and Mann-Whitney U pairwise comparison. The relationship between anti-IBV serum and virus neutralization titers were compared by Spearman rank correlation analysis. Analysis of the viral growth curves was conducted by fitting a polynomial curve to the exponential phase of viral growth (57); growth rates were then compared between groups by using the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test adjusted for post hoc analysis.
