            "text": "The emergence of novel respiratory pathogens can challenge the capacity of key health care resources, such as intensive care units, that are constrained to serve only specific geographical populations. An ability to predict the magnitude and timing of peak incidence at the scale of a single large population would help to accurately assess the value of interventions designed to reduce that peak. However, current disease-dynamic theory does not provide a clear understanding of the relationship between: epidemic trajectories at the scale of interest (e.g. city); population mobility; and higher resolution spatial effects (e.g. transmission within small neighbourhoods). Here, we used a spatially-explicit stochastic meta-population model of arbitrary spatial resolution to determine the effect of resolution on model-derived epidemic trajectories. We simulated an influenza-like pathogen spreading across theoretical and actual population densities and varied our assumptions about mobility using Latin-Hypercube sampling. Even though, by design, cumulative attack rates were the same for all resolutions and mobilities, peak incidences were different. Clear thresholds existed for all tested populations, such that models with resolutions lower than the threshold substantially overestimated population-wide peak incidence. The effect of resolution was most important in populations which were of lower density and lower mobility. With the expectation of accurate spatial incidence datasets in the near future, our objective was to provide a framework for how to use these data correctly in a spatial meta-population model. Our results suggest that there is a fundamental spatial resolution for any pathogen-population pair. If underlying interactions between pathogens and spatially heterogeneous populations are represented at this resolution or higher, accurate predictions of peak incidence for city-scale epidemics are feasible.",

Recent epidemics of concern include: SARS [1] , influenza [2] [3] [4] , H7N9 [5, 6] and MERS [7, 8] . During an epidemic it is important to accurately predict the impact of the epidemic over different spatial scales, where scale refers to the size of the region being monitored; such as a hospital, city, country or globally. Intervention policies should be defined relative to this spatial scale, for example taking account of how long it will take to vaccinate a whole city or to distribute a treatment country-wide. Those making decisions about intervention strategies need a clear understanding of the underlying epidemic process, so as to anticipate the magnitude and timing of peak incidence at their scale of interest and to effectively control the epidemic.",

All of these examples can be thought of as metapopulation models in which the population of interest is represented as a collection of sub-populations located in space, for example households [17] [18] [19] , airports (GLEaM [20] ) or districts/states [21] .

Both of these are defined according to the resolution of the population representation, where resolution defines the number and size of the pixels making up the ''image'' of the population within the model. A pixel is the smallest single component of an image. A high resolution representation will divide the region into many small pixels; a lower resolution uses fewer, larger pixels (Fig. S1 ). The resolution chosen is usually decided by the data available: for example, population and travel data may be defined at the ward or county level only. The level of mixing between individuals in distinct pixels is defined by mobility models, these are often fitted to travel data from censuses. Also, sometimes, resolution is limited by computational capacity.",

Commuting data also excludes key at-risk groups -the under 17 s and over 70 s -who have lower mobility travel patterns compared to the 18-69 population [22] .

This means that the next generation matrix at any resolution and for any mobility has the same spectral radius: R 0 was the same at all resolutions and contact levels and the local and global R 0 s were the same. A full proof that R 0 was constant with respect to resolution is given in the Text S1 in Supporting Information S1, and is similar to that in Ref [23] . Because R 0 was constant, if the mobility was such that there was contact between every pair of pixels, the final epidemic size was the same across all resolutions and in every pixel. If mobility was restrictive enough that some pixels were never infected the final CAR reflected this restriction.

This was increasingly evident as mobility became more and more restricted: for the most localised mobility assumptions (low power), peak incidence in the fully mixed case was nearly double that at the highest resolution.

We tested 50 parameter sets chosen using the LHS technique [27] , with 10 separate realisations of each set for each region (variation in results from the stochastic model was low -see confidence intervals for 25 repeats in Fig. 2 for example). Kernels for the 50 sets are plotted in Fig. S4 . The LHS results confirmed that the effect of resolution is most important in populations which are less mobile, Fig. 3 . As mobility decreased (a combination of the offset and the power in the kernel) the difference in peak incidence between the lowest and the highest resolution increased. This was particularly true in Guangzhou, Rio and New York, but in Delhi the effect was reduced (due to Delhi having a very large population in comparison to the other regions).",

Indeed the radiation model is always bounded by the three gravity models we use and our LHS models explore a large space around these.

We examined the effect of the resolution of the population density on the model predictions of epidemic spread over the scale of interest. We refer to resolution as defining the number and size of the individual pixels dividing the region; higher resolution representations use a higher number of smaller pixels. Our results imply that for plausible population densities and mobility patterns, fundamental resolutions exist for specific pathogens such that the detail of the population and their interactions must be represented faithfully if accurate epidemic trajectories are to be estimated. The impact of model resolution was clear in models of less mobile populations: our results indicate that at lower mobility, low resolution representations overestimated the peak incidence, obtaining a high peak incidence and fast spread similar to that obtained in a fully mixed model. However, sufficiently high resolution representations gave lower and later peak incidences because of the delaying effect of multiple small pixels. Indeed at low mobility, clear thresholds existed for the resolution of the theoretical population density, such that models with resolutions below the threshold over-estimated the system-wide peak incidence. Similar thresholds existed for real population densities: Guangzhou, Rio, New York and Delhi. Increased mobility reduced the effect of resolution on the epidemic.",

Children also travel less far than working adults [22] . Together, these imply that a kernel for children is likely to be more restrictive than those defined by commuting data alone.

For example, transmission dynamics at different scales may be driven by different age groups: the behaviour of more mobile adults may be disproportionately important in the seeding of nearby pixels. However, the slower than expected within-country spatial spread during 2009 [35] suggests that for pandemic influenza, population sub-groups with reduced mobility likely do define the fundamental resolution.",

The highest mobility model has higher average flux compared to the low and medium mobility models. At lower resolutions and high mobility large numbers of individuals move, but the distribution of the numbers moving is more uniform than at the highest resolution, causing the lines for the three mobility scenarios to swap order at different resolutions. doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003561.g004",
