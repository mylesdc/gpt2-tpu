This act required, in part, that periodic national assessments be conducted of the potential consequences of climate variability and change on the nation's health. The first U.S. National Assessment of the Potential Consequences of Climate Variability and Change was completed in 2000 (National Assessment Synthesis Team, U.S. Global Change Research Program 2001) and was the culmination of a national process of research, analysis, and dialogue about the coming changes in climate and their impacts, and what Americans can do to adapt to an uncertain and continuously changing climate. The goal of the assessment was to address four questions (Dressler et al. 1998 ):",

The HSA focused on five categories of health outcomes: temperature-related morbidity and mortality, the health impacts of extreme weather events (e.g., storms and floods), health outcomes associated with air pollution, water-and food-borne diseases, and vector-and rodent-borne diseases. Each outcome team sought to address how climate change might affect the burden of disease, identify specific strategies and measures needed to effectively adapt, and clarify key knowledge gaps that must be filled to better understand the possible impacts of climate variability and change on human health . The integrated assessment approach that was used reviewed a wide range of literature on climate and health, relied on the expert judgment of the health sector team and those with whom they consulted, and incorporated, where available, some limited modeling of the projected impacts of climate on health. Analyses of the roles of population vulnerability and adaptation were woven throughout the assessment.",

Exceptions were made if no comparable U.S. study was identified for a health outcome of interest. We identified relevant reports and publications from electronic reference databases using combinations of key words developed from the health outcome categories, limited by date. The following databases were searched: Medline (www.nlm.nih.gov), Biosis (www.biosis.org), Social Sciences Index (scientific.thomson.com/products/ssci), Enviroline (library.diolog.com/bluesheets/ html/b10040.html), and Meteorological and Geoastrophysical Abstracts (www2.lib.udel. edu/database/mga.html).

The HSA (Patz et al. 2000) noted a number of population subgroups that are likely to be more vulnerable to the adverse impacts of a changing climate, including the very young (i.e., < 1 year of age), older adults (i.e., those \u2265 65 years of age), and immunocompromised individuals. These groups are often at the greatest risk for climatesensitive health outcomes because they are more sensitive to vector-, food-, and water-borne diseases, have limited capacity to acclimatize to thermal extremes, and have reduced ability to undertake appropriate behavioral changes when exposed to thermal extremes and extreme weather events. Therefore, we reviewed U.S. population projections and public health sector trends to evaluate the potential future changes in the vulnerability of susceptible groups to the health impacts of climate change. Table 2 summarizes U.S. population estimates for various age groups from 2000 to 2100 (U.S. Census Bureau 2002) . Most notable is the anticipated increase in the size and proportion of the total population accounted for by older adults. By 2100, projections suggest that there will be approximately 100 million more citizens \u2265 65 years of age than in 2000. The combined share of the population that will be composed of the very young and older adults is projected to increase from about 15% to > 25%. The anticipated increase in these age groups suggests, all else equal, that the U.S. population will become increasingly vulnerable to the health impacts of climate change.",

First, the recognition of the critical role played by the public health system in protecting the nation's health has increased, which has led to a significant increase in the commitment of resources to the public health sector, particularly public health surveillance and training (Staiti et al. 2003) . This shift is the product of many factors, including the terrorist attacks of September 11, the anthrax attacks in 2001, the fear of bioterrorist attacks (Staiti et al. 2003) , and the continued spread of introduced illnesses such as West Nile virus. In addition, the 2003 SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) outbreak highlighted how quickly diseases can spread from one region to another, the importance of improving public health systems in many developing countries, and the importance of timely and comprehensive public health surveillance systems (Levine et al. 2003) .",

Although this does not address whether the typical conditions in these events may change over temporal and geographic scales, Robinson suggests that if the frequency of exceeding a particular temperature threshold increases, the threshold should be revised for defining excessive heat events.

Collectively, these studies argue that there has been a declining trend in heat-attributable mortality in U.S. cities from the 1960s through the 1990s, although important regional differences remain (e.g., elevated mortality in northeastern and northern interior cities). An interpretation of these results is that estimates of future temperatureattributable mortality that fail to account for this trend, and instead use some central tendency estimate, will overestimate the mortality impact of future heat events. These studies can be viewed as an argument that there is an adaptive trend in the United States that will minimize the future health impacts of extreme heat events and that climate change will have little impact in shaping future mortality in U.S. cities (Davis et al. 2004 ). Sheridan and Dolney (2003) reported results contradicting the HSA's conclusion that residing in urban areas elevated one's health risks during heat events, partly as a result of the urban heat island effect. Sheridan and Dolney (2003) failed to find a statistically significant difference in the percentage increase in daily mortality and the level of urbanization using data from Ohio for 1975-1998. Although not conclusive as a single result, the study identifies a relevant area for future research on shaping adaptive responses by drawing attention to the risks faced by rural populations during heat events.",

Identified research gaps included the need for development of sophisticated meteorologic models that can estimate chemical and spatial relationships, specific meteorologic variables, and future locations and nature of human activities (i.e., anthropogenic emissions).

The literature published since the HSA supports this conclusion, as well as conclusions specific to each health outcome considered. However, this does not mean that there has been no improvement in our understanding of the potential effects of climate variability and change on population health in the United States. For example, recent studies have refined our understanding of the mortality-heat stress relationship and quantified the impact of urban heat islands on ambient temperatures. Similarly, continued development and expansion of morbidity and mortality data sets and advances in epidemiologic modeling techniques have refined the quantitative exposure-response relationships for a number of other health outcome areas. Climate change is expected to increase morbidity and mortality risks from climatesensitive health determinants and outcomes such as extreme heat events and flooding. A larger and relatively older U.S. population in future years will increase overall vulnerability to health risks, depending on the effectiveness of identifying, implementing, and monitoring appropriate adaptation measures.",

The selected health outcomes have long been the focus of epidemiologic research in the United States, with associations between changes in weather factors and increased morbidity and mortality relatively well described. However, data gaps still exist that, until resolved, will limit the ability of any assessment to provide a definitive conclusion about the net health impact of climate variability and change in the United States. Perhaps most important, the continued lack of reliable local and regional climate change projections limits the ability of researchers to quantify the attributable burden of diseases due to climate change. At the same time, quantifying by how much adaptive capacity is likely to reduce impacts also is uncertain. Until reliable quantitative estimates of both impacts and adaptive capacity are developed, the net impacts of climate change on human health will inevitably be described as uncertain.",

This uncertainty reflects the need to evaluate the projected impacts of climate change in the context of changes in the vulnerability of the U.S. population and the efficacy of adaptation strategies and measures. For some health outcomes, such as heat events and flooding, climate change will likely increase morbidity and mortality risks. In addition, aging of the U.S. population is expected to increase its overall vulnerability. However, the capacity of the United States to implement effective and efficient adaptation measures is assumed to remain high throughout this century, thus reducing the overall burden of climate-sensitive health outcomes. As additional research furthers our understanding of how the various determinants of climatesensitive health outcomes interact, our ability to project the future impacts of climate change more accurately will be enhanced.",
