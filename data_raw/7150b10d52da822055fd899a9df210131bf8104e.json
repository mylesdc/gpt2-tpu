To determine the prevalence of HBoV infection in patients with LRTI in Shanghai and its correlation with disease severity, we performed a 3-year prospective study of HBoV in healthy controls, outpatients and inpatients under five years of age with Xray diagnosed LRTIs. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were tested by PCR for common respiratory viruses and by real time PCR for HBoV subtypes 1-4. Nasopharyngeal swabs from healthy controls and serum samples and stools from inpatients were also tested for HBoV1-4 by real time PCR. Viral loads were determined by quantitative real time PCR in all HBoV positive samples. HBoV1 was detected in 7.0% of inpatients, with annual rates of 5. 1%, 8.0% and 4.8% in 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) subtype A was the most frequent co-infection detected; HBoV1 and RSVA appeared to cocirculate with similar seasonal variations. High HBoV viral loads (.10 6 copies/ml) were significantly more frequent in inpatients and outpatients than in healthy controls. There was a direct correlation of high viral load with increasing disease severity in patients co-infected with HBoV1 and at least one other respiratory virus. In summary, our data suggest that HBoV1 can cause LRTIs, but symptomatic HBoV infection is only observed in the context of high viral load.",

Since its discovery, HBoV has been associated with upper and lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) and gastroenteritis worldwide. Recent studies have revealed that three new species, named HBoV2, 3 and 4 are found mainly in the gastrointestinal tract and rarely in the respiratory tract, in contrast to HBoV1 which is a respiratory pathogen [2, 3, 4, 5] . HBoV is classified in the family Parvoviridae, which includes small, non-envoloped, icosahedral viruses with 5.3 kb single-strand DNA genome containing three open reading frames (ORFs). The first two sequential ORFs encode nonstructural proteins NS1 and NP1, whereas the third downstream ORF encodes two viral capsid proteins, VP1 and VP2 [1] .",

Several seroepidemiologic studies have demonstrated that the seropositivity rate for HBoV increases with age, reaching nearly 100% by 6 years of age [9, 10] . Recent data show that HBoV1 is often shed for a long time after primary infection into the respiratory tracts of infants and young children. HBoV1 DNA and anti-HBoV1 antibodies in serum differentiate primary HBoV1 infection from long term post infection shedding [11] , with detection of HBoV1 DNA in blood more closely associated with symptoms than positive respiratory samples alone [9] .",

However, recent studies have implied that high viral load, detection of HBoV alone and viraemia may be associated with RTIs [14] , with mono-infection of HBoV being associated with higher viral load than co-infection [15] . Two case reports about severe respiratory disease found a statistical association between HBoV1 and otherwise unexplained LRTIs, in particular, acute wheezing [16, 17, 18] .

Previous studies including children with acute respiratory tract infections conducted in Shanghai reported HBoV infection rates of 4.6% to 11.8% [19, 20] . In our study the positive rate of HBoV of NPAs from patients with LRTIs was 7.2% (42/583), consistent with previous studies. Importantly, the present study reported six patients with NPAs, serum and stool being HBoV positive. The median viral load of NPAs for these 6 patients were significantly higher than other HBoV-positive samples (5.1610 6 vs 6.3610 8 , p#0.05). Detection of HBoV genomic DNA in blood with high viral load in NPAs strengthened the causal link between the virus and disease, which agrees with findings in other studies [9, 14] . The only subtype of HBoV circulating in Shanghai was HBoV1; HBoV2-4 were not detected. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that the HBoV1 strain circulating in Shanghai is closely related to the FZ40 and WLL-1 strains reported from Fuzhou and Hangzhou, China. Interestingly, we found that HBoV1 cocirculated, to a large extent, with RSVA in the study period with peaks in autumn and winter. RSVA was the most often detected virus in NPAs followed by HRV and AdV, correlating with viruses co-detected with HBoV1, with 47.4% of co-infected patients being infected with RSVA and 15.6% with HRV.",

Recent studies have implied that HBoV DNA can exist episomally in infected human tissues and therefore can likely establish persistent infection in the host [22] . In our study abdominal pain was recorded in more HBoV-positive patients than HBoV- negative patients with 1 out 14 (7.1%) patients with low viral load, and 3 out 25 (12.0%) with high viral load recording diarrhea (p = 0.5453). Although the mechanisms of pathogenesis and routes of infection of HBoV are not yet understood, some information is available for bovine parvovirus (BPV), another member of the genus Bocavirus that may have implications for HBoV disease. BPV causes respiratory and enteric disease in calves following initial replication in the tonsils and intestinal epithelium, from where it spreads into the blood, lymphoid tissues and respiratory epithelium [23] . Several seroepidemiologic studies have demonstrated that HBoV infects 40-50% of healthy children aged 6 months to 4 years, after which there appears to be widespread immunity. The present study chose 29 outpatients who presented to hospital for respiratory symptoms and 195 healthy controls retrieved from SCDC Sample Bank to analyze the HBoV positive rate and the viral load. Outpatients and inpatients had high viral load (.1610 6 copies/mL) whereas the viral load of healthy controls was low. This result confirms that HBoV can exist in the respiratory tract without causing any symptoms; high viral load is necessary for symptomatic disease.",

It is noticeable that in co-infection, HBoV viral load was associated positively with disease severity (p#0.05). Given that the most frequently co-detected virus with HBoV was RSVA, which can also cause severe LRTIs in children, the frequency of RSVA in different disease severity groups was analyzed. The percentage of RSVA co-detection with HBoV was not significantly higher than other infectious viruses in all disease severity groups (p value: mild 0.6393, moderate 0.1006, severe 0.0670). In addition, the patients who were negative for HBoV but infected with more than one respiratory virus were mostly grouped with moderate disease compared to those who were positive for HBoV (p#0.05). Additionally, there were more HBoV-positive patients than HBoV-negative patients (P#0.05) in the severe disease group. Finally, our data of the two infants with HBoV suggest that LRTIs caused by HBoV can lead to severe and life-threatening disease, confirming reports from other studies [16, 18] . To the best of our knowledge this is the first report of severe disease in an infant under 1 month of age with only HBoV being detected and our data imply that HBoV1 can infect very young infants.",

The PCR mix was denatured at 95uC for 30 seconds (s), followed by amplification consisting of 40 cycles of 15 s at 95uC and 1 minute at 60uC. Positive and no-template controls were included in each run. Plasmids containing the target genes were used as positive controls for all four HBoV subtypes and were constructed by Bio-Sune Bio-tech company.",

The conserved and variable regions of the HBoV1 genome were identified by aligning 13 HBoV1 sequences downloaded from Genbank. Primer selection was aided by Lasergene PrimerSelect 7.0.1 software (DNASTAR, inc., CA) for maximum homology. The primer pairs were specific for HBoV1, with no homology found to any other sequences in GenBank. Premix Ex Taq Version 2.0 (Takara, Japan) was used to perform PCR in a volume of 50 ml using GeneAmp PCR system 9700 (AB, Singapore) and optical 96-well reaction plate (AB, Singapore). Each reaction consisted of 25 ml Premix EX Taq, 1 ml each of sense and antisense primers (20 mM), 5 ml HBoV DNA, and molecular grade water to a final volume of 50 ml. PCR consisted of 35 cycles of 15 minutes at 94uC; 30 s at 94uC, 30 s at 45-55uC, 1 minute at 72uC followed by 10 minutes at 72uC. The PCR products were visualized by electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel containing 0.5 mg/ml ethidium bromide in Tris-borate buffer (pH 8.0). Positive PCR products were purified and sequenced by Bio-Sune bio-tech. Sequences were spliced in silico using Lasergene SeqMan 7.0.1 software (DNASTAR, inc., CA). The phylogenetic tree of HBoV sequences was constructed using neighbor-joining by MEGA (5.0 version) software. 6 sequences of HBoV1, 3 HBoV2 sequences, 3 HBoV3 sequences and 2 HBoV4 sequences were downloaded from Genbank and used as the reference viruses in the construction of the tree.",
