However this effect was not considered in previous virus-microwave interaction studies and microwave-based virus epidemic prevention. Here we show that this structure-resonant energy transfer effect from microwaves to virus can be efficient enough so that airborne virus was inactivated with reasonable microwave power density safe for the open public. We demonstrate this effect by measuring the residual viral infectivity of influenza A virus after illuminating microwaves with different frequencies and powers. We also established a theoretical model to estimate the microwaves power threshold for virus inactivation and good agreement with experiments was obtained. Such structure-resonant energy transfer induced inactivation is mainly through physically fracturing the virus structure, which was confirmed by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. These results provide a pathway toward establishing a new epidemic prevention strategy in open public for airborne virus.",

            "text": "In the past few decades, tremendous efforts have been made to kill airborne viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus or influenza viruses, which have caused catastrophic illness worldwide. Current airborne virus epidemic prevention to be used in public space includes strong chemical inactivation, UV irradiation, and microwave thermal heating. All these methods affect the open public. In 1980s, Robach et al. 1 and Cerf 2 demonstrated that ultrasonic energy can be absorbed by viruses. In 2000, Babincov\u00e1 et al. 3 hypothesized that viruses can be inactivated by generating the corresponding resonance ultrasound vibrations of viruses, which is in the GHz region. Based on this hypothesis, several groups started investigating the vibrational modes of viruses in this frequency range [4] [5] [6] [7] . Recently we demonstrated that dipolar mode of the confined acoustic vibrations (CAVs) inside viruses can be resonantly excited by microwaves of the same frequency with a resonant microwave absorption effect 8 . The observed microwave resonance absorption phenomenon indicates a possible structure-resonant energy transfer (SRET) effect from electromagnetic waves (EM waves) to CAVs of viruses. Theoretically this SRET process is an efficient way to excite the vibrational mode of the whole virus structure due to a 100% energy conversion of a photon into a phonon of the same frequency, but the overall SRET efficiency is also related to the mechanical properties of the surrounding environment 9 , which influences the quality factor of the oscillator (virus). A study on the SRET efficiency to inactive virus is thus highly desired and it will determine if this SRET phenomenon provides a solution to inactivate airborne viruses in open public for epidemic prevention.",

            "text": "In this article, we show that SRET from microwave to virus can be efficient enough so that airborne virus was inactivated with reasonable microwave power density safe for the open public. To investigate the SRET efficiency from EM waves to CAVs in viruses, we first developed a theoretical model to describe the relation between the induced stress and the field magnitude of the illuminating microwave. Since the viruses could be inactivated when the induced stress fractures the structure of viruses, we propose to explore the SRET efficiency from microwaves to viruses through measuring the virus inactivation threshold. Based on the proposed model, we studied the inactivation ratio of influenza A (H3N2) virus at dipolar-mode-resonance and off-resonance microwave frequencies as well as with different microwave powers. Plaque assay 10 was then applied to calculate the titer of virus samples before and after the microwave illumination. Our results indicate efficient SRET from microwave to viruses, which resulted in higher inactivation ratio of viruses at the dipolar resonant frequency. At the resonant frequency, the microwave power density threshold for H3N2 inactivation was found to be below the IEEE safety standard, also agreeing well with our developed theoretical model. The real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (real-time RT-PCR) method 11 was further performed to confirm that the main inactivation mechanism is through physically fracturing the viruses while the RNA genome was not degraded by the microwave illumination, supporting the fact that our studied SRET mechanism is fundamentally different from the microwave thermal heating effect. These results provide a pathway toward establishing a new epidemic prevention strategy in open public for airborne virus.",

Since the protein and genome have similar mechanical properties 8 , for the estimation of dipolar vibration frequencies, we treat the virion as a homogenous sphere. Dipolar Mode of a Homogeneous Sphere. Due to the spatial confinement, not only electronic but also acoustic energy quantization has been observed in low dimensional systems such as quantum dots and nano-wires. In 1882, Lamb studied the torsional (TOR) and spheroidal (SPH) modes of a homogeneous free sphere by considering the stress-free boundary condition on the surface 12 . Among these modes, the SPH mode with = \uf06c 1 allows dipolar coupling 13 and the corresponding eigenvalue equation can be expressed as 14, 15 :",

A comparison between the commonly observed = \uf06c 0 breathing mode and the = \uf06c 1 dipolar mode can be found in Supplementary online. the Since the = \uf06c 1 dipolar mode of a nano-sphere cannot be detected by the light scattering experiments 16 , it was not observed until a previous study of the resonant excitation of dipolar mode through THz wave or microwave excitations 17, 18 when the core and shell of the nano-sphere have permanent charge separation. Once the resonantly oscillating electric field was applied to the nano-sphere, opposite displacement between core and shell was generated, thus excited the dipolar mode vibrations. Compared with the breathing ( = \uf06c 0) and quadrapolar ( = \uf06c 2) modes, dipolar mode ( = \uf06c 1) is the only SPH mode to directly interact with the EM waves whose wavelength is much longer than the particle's size. Due to the permanent charge separation nature of viruses, in 2009, dipolar coupling with = \uf06c 1 CAVs is confirmed to be the mechanisms responsible for microwave resonant absorption in viruses by treating spherical viruses as free homogeneous nanoparticles 8, 9 . Figure 1 shows the simulated displacement field of the dipolar mode (calculated by the finite element method, COMSOL Multiphysics, COMSOL, Inc.) of a homogeneous sphere (mass density and viscoelastic properties are constant throughout the sphere). We define the relative displacement direction of the dipolar mode as the z-direction, which will also be the field direction of the applied EM waves discussed in the next section. By plotting the displacement field of the x-z plane (y = 0) of the sphere, the opposite displacement between the core and shell regions can be clearly observed in Fig. 1(b) . Meanwhile Fig. 1 (c) shows the side view of the distortion of the x-y plane of the sphere at different z locations, which concludes that the maximum distortion occurs on the equatorial plane (z = 0) of the sphere. Figure 1(d) shows the top view of the displacement field of the equatorial plane (z = 0). It is interesting to find out that the magnitude of averaged positive displacement (inner region) is 1.27 times the magnitude of the averaged negative displacement (outer region), while positive and negative displacements occupy 42% and 58% area, respectively. Furthermore one can find that the maximum magnitude of the displacement, occurring either at the very center or the outer surface of the equatorial plane, is approximately twice of the averaged magnitude of the displacement.",

With oscillating dipolar vibration to inactivate a virus, the most possible mechanism is to fracture the most outer surface of the equatorial plane (z = 0) due to the location of the maximum distortions, as illustrated in Fig. 1 (c,d). For influenza viruses, this corresponds to the lipid membrane of the envelope. To estimate the maximum induced stress ( ) P stress max on the equatorial plane, we divide the maximum induced force by the area of the shell region (defined by the moving direction in the approximate model) on the equatorial plane. Following above discussion, we found that the maximum induced stress is twice the average value and the shell region covers 58% of the equatorial plane: If the required stress threshold P stress T to fracture a virus can be obtained, the threshold electric field magnitude ( ) E T of the incident microwaves can also be obtained by using: Figure 2 shows the threshold magnitude of the incident electric field at different frequencies with different Q based on equation (12) with a fixed P stress T threshold value. One can observe that the minimum of the threshold electric field magnitude occurs when the applied frequency is closed to the intrinsic resonant frequency. Moreover cavity quality factor Q plays a major role. By changing the pH value of the solution, charge status of viral surface can be modulated, which affects the Q of the vibration. For example, previous studies indicated that the cavity Q of spherical viruses ranges between 2-10 by raising the pH value of the solution from 5.4 to 7.4 8 . With increased Q, more energy can be confined inside the resonator, which leads to much lower microwave field threshold magnitude at the resonant frequency.",

Such viruses can infect birds and mammals and are increasingly abundant in seasonal influenza, which kills an estimated 6309 people in the United States each year, including pneumonia and influenza causes 21 . Based on previous studies, the averaged mass and the diameter of the H3N2 virus are 161 MDa 22 and 100 nm 23 . Here we approximate the structure of the virus as a nanosphere with a core-shell structure of opposite charge distribution. The shell (90% of the total mass) contains lipid, neuraminidase (NA), hemagglutinin (HA), and M-protein. The core (10% of the total mass) includes RNA and RNP. The reduced mass (m*) of virus is thus 14.5 MDa. From the literature 24 , force with 400 pN applied on the AFM tip can fracture the lipid envelope. Since the radius of the tip was 30 nm 24 , the threshold stress to fracture the shell was 0.141 MPa (P stress T ). In order to calculate the threshold magnitude of the electric field to fracture H3N2 virus following equation (12), some important parameters such as q, Q and \u03c9 0 of the studied H3N2 virus has to be obtained by measuring the microwave absorption spectrum of viruses.",

            "text": "Based on Fig. 3(c) , the field intensity threshold for inactivating H3N2 virus ranges between 86.9-236.3 V/m, which corresponds to 82.3-564 W/m 2 , for microwaves between 6 and 12 GHz. Since the aperture size of our horn antenna was 9.8 cm \u00d7 7.1 cm. The required threshold power input ranges from 0.57 W to 3.92 W for 6-12 GHz microwaves. We thus first applied 6.3 W (38 dBm) fixed microwave power, which is higher than all the threshold power input, into the horn antenna for the frequency dependency studies. After considering the transmission coefficient of our horn antenna, this experimental condition corresponded to 765 -882 W/m 2 average illuminated power density on the sample surface, corresponding to the field intensity inside the specimen of 260-296 V/m respectively. For 8-8.4 GHz microwave at the resonant frequency, the average illuminated power density was about 810 W/m 2 , equivalent to 273 V/m effective field intensity inside the sample. We thus expect to observe the inactivation effect throughout the studied spectral range. As been summarized in Fig. 4(b) , a frequency dependent inactivation ratio can be observed in our experiments, with a peak located at the resonant frequency of the dipolar mode while higher than 50% inactivation ratio can be observed throughout the studied frequency range. At 8.4 GHz, the measured titer count was zero, indicating 100% inactivation ratio, which means that the remaining active viral concentration was smaller than the system sensitivity of 10 pfu/mL. This result indicates at least a three-order of magnitudes attenuation on the virus titer, when the microwave frequency was tuned to the dipolar mode resonant frequency with the electric field intensity 3 times higher than the threshold. The illuminated average power density was roughly 6.7 times higher than the IEEE safety standard for the 8-8.4 GHz cases. It is important to notice that the power density is proportional to the square of the field intensity.",

            "text": "To further investigate the efficiency of this SRET effect from microwave to virus and the threshold effect, we further measured the inactivation ratio of H3N2 virus with different power densities at the resonant frequency ~8 GHz of the confined acoustic dipolar mode. Our theoretical model predicted an inactivation threshold field intensity of 86.9 V/m, corresponding to an average microwave power density of 82.3 W/m 2 in specimen. Since we assume all power can transmit from air to specimen, power density in air is also 82.3 W/m 2 , which is 1.48 times lower than the IEEE safety standard. Figure 5 (b) summarized the measured inactivation ratio for 4 different average microwave power densities of 820, 320, 82, and 51 W/m 2 in air, corresponding to an effective field intensity inside samples of 274, 171, 87, and 68 V/m, respectively. It is noted that the experiment with 82 W/m 2 in air was performed in a different experimental setup, as shown in Fig. 5(a) . A significant threshold effect can be observed when the effective field intensity inside samples started to be on the order of or exceed the estimated threshold. A 38% inactivation ratio can be observed with a field intensity of 87 V/m, while the inactivation ratio dropped drastically to only negligible 6% with a slightly lower 68 V/m field intensity. With a 3 times higher field intensity than the threshold, the inactivation ratio saturated at a 100% value. Discussions Compared with the simple theoretical model for threshold estimation as summarized in Fig. 3(c) , our result agrees qualitatively and surprisingly quantitatively. First, in our experiments, we observed a strong resonant effect on the virus inactivation ratio at the dipolar oscillation frequency of 8.4 GHz, thus indicating that the observed virus inactivation after microwave illumination was due to the proposed SRET from microwave to virus through dipolar coupling. Second, at the resonant frequency, we do observe H3N2 virus inactivation by illuminating 82 W/m 2 (lower than the IEEE safety standard in public space) 8 GHz microwaves on our viral solution, corresponding to an average 87 V/m electric field intensity inside the solution, confirming that our proposed simple model to estimate the field threshold (86.9 V/m) to structurally fracture the virus is quantitatively correct, especially combining the observed threshold effect as discussed above. With a low resonator quality factor (around and less than 2 for H3N2), we also observed virus inactivation in off-resonant frequencies (6-12GHz), following a trend predicted with our model. However for off-resonant frequencies, the simple harmonic oscillator model seems to always estimate a lower threshold in the Stoke-side (lower-frequency-side) of the resonant frequency than the anti-Stoke-side (high-frequency-side). For example, at DC (0 frequency) it still predicts a relatively low threshold field magnitude to fracture the virus. This is different from our observation. We observe that the anti-Stoke-side is with a better inactivation ratio than the Stoke-side, and the source for disagreement should be the over-simplification of the adopted model.",

As we introduced, in the past few decades, tremendous efforts have been made to kill airborne viruses such as SARS or influenza A, which have caused catastrophic illness worldwide. Active airborne viruses are always transported inside tiny water droplets, thus similar to our experimental condition. A strategy for airborne virus epidemic prevention in open public is thus highly desired. Our finding represents the first possible mechanism to inactivate airborne viruses without affecting the open public, since the required microwave power could be within the IEEE safety standard. Comparing this work with traditional microwave thermal inactivation, previous works 27,28 used a microwaves oven with more than 100 W to heat the phage suspension. The inactivation ratio could reach almost 100% by increasing the temperature of the phage suspension to 80 \u00b0C. In our case, 100% inactivation were achieved with 6.3 W (38 dBm) as the input power into the horn antenna at 8.4 GHz. A power reduction by more than a factor of 15 is achieved. It is however not possible to directly compare the irradiating power density, since the irradiating area was not provided in previous literatures. Nevertheless our work still shows sharp contrast to current methodologies, including strong chemical inactivation, UV irradiation, and microwave thermal heating with 100 W microwave power 27,28 , which are not safe for the open public.",

It is known that the microwave thermal heating has a weak frequency dependency between 6-12 GHz, and this is not the case for our frequency dependent result as shown in Fig. 4(b) . To confirm that our observation is not due to the microwave thermal heating effect, we had monitored the sample temperature change during the microwave illumination experiments with a radiated power density of 486 W/m 2 at a frequency of 6 GHz by using an infrared thermal imaging camera with a temperature accuracy of 0.05 \u00b0C (CHCT, P384-20). The temperature rise after 15 minutes radiation was 7 \u00b0C, from 27.5 \u00b0C up to 34.5 \u00b0C.

We then preformed real-time RT-PCR (Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction) experiment for RNA amplification in order to compare the results after microwave illumination with the established fractured-virus model. Without protein denature, the established fractured-virus model allowed the viral RNA content to be extracted after fracturing. We then performed the RT-PCR experiments to amplify the extracted viral RNA after fracturing either through the frozen fracturing model or after microwave resonant irradiation. Figure 6 (a) summarized our results. The applied average microwave power density was 320 W/m 2 , the microwave frequency was tuned to the dipolar mode resonant frequency of 8.35 GHz, and the illumination time was 15 minutes. To avoid possible existing viral RNA in solution before the microwave illumination, we pretreated the virus samples by adding RNase to degrade the existing RNA outside the viral particles. As can be revealed in Fig. 6(a) , the control fractured-virus model (shown as \"control\") showed the same RNA amplification trend with excellent quantitative agreement with the RNase-pretreated samples after microwave resonant illumination (shown as \"pretreat\"). Obvious increase of copies in PCR can be observed after cycle 15. We have also performed two post-treat groups to double confirm the effect of the RNase. For post-treat groups, RNase was added right after the microwave resonant illumination. Even if the virus particles were fractured, the released RNA would be degraded by RNase, we did not expect to detect the viral RNA.

The efficiency of such energy transfer was investigated through exploring the virus inactivation ratio. Based on the proposed damped mass-spring model and the experimentally measured microwave absorption cross-section of a single virus, threshold magnitude of electric field to fracture viruses at different illuminated frequencies can be estimated. After the illumination by the microwave, the plaque assay experiment indicated that the inactivation ratio reaches its maximum at the resonant frequency of the dipolar resonance. The real-time RT-PCR experiment double confirmed that the main inactivation mechanism was through physically fracturing viruses without degrading viral RNA genome. This work not only theoretically and experimentally demonstrates a new energy transfer mechanism between EM waves and viruses, but also indicates an efficient SRET effect. Our results have important implications for the interaction between microwaves and biological tissues, which is a highly concerned public issue. With an observed inactivation threshold with a microwave power density within the IEEE safety standard, the demonstrated SRET mechanism also provides a pathway toward establishing a new epidemic prevention strategy in open public for airborne viruses. Microwave Absorption Spectrum Measurement. The microwave absorption spectrum measurement was performed by combining the coplanar waveguide (CPW) circuit with a microfluidic channel. As shown in Fig. 3(a) , we covered the structure of the CPW by the microfluidic channel with a 1.25 mm-long sensing zone (L). The gap between the signal electrode and the ground electrode of the CPW was 25 \u03bc m. In order to decrease microwave loss on the electrodes, the gold layer thickness of the electrode was 1.2 \u03bc m. On the surface of electrodes, we grew a thermal isolator layer of silicon dioxide on the sensing zone by Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition (PECVD) to lower the temperature rise of fluids due to microwave dielectric heating 30 . We then used a network analyzer (Anritsu, MS2028C) as the source to measure the absorption spectrum of H3N2 viruses from 6 GHz to 14 GHz. The virus particle density in the solution was 7.5 \u00d7 10 14 m \u22123 . The spectrum of the solution without viruses was first measured as a reference; solution with viruses was later measured. By removing the solution background, the microwave absorption spectrum of H3N2 viruses in solution was thus obtained (Fig. 3(b) ) following a procedure similar to ref. 8. Microwave Illumination Measurement. In our experiments, we used two different microwave sources, depending on the utilized microwave power: a network analyzer (Anritsu, MS2028C) or an Yttrium iron garnet (YIG) oscillator. Then the microwave signal was amplified by a power amplifier (QPJ-06183640) and radiated from the horn antenna (ELECTRO-METRICS, EM-6969). The aperture size of the antenna was 9.8 cm \u00d7 7.1 cm. To avoid damage on oscillator and amplifier caused by back reflection, we added an isolator and a directional coupler. All the microwave systems were put in a P2 class flow hood. The antenna was directed toward the bottom (Fig. 4(a) ) or the side (Fig. 5(a) ) of flow hood and the microwave was normally incident on either microscope slides ( Fig. 4(a) ) or acrylic cuvettes (Fig. 5(a) ) at a distance of 5 cm below the exit of horn antenna. To avoid large reflection from the metal hood surface, the microscope slide or cuvette was put in a plastic dish supported by a broad band pyramidal absorber. For each measurement, the viral solution (7.5 \u00d7 10 14 m \u22123 particle density) under illumination was drop on the slide and covered with a cover glass or was contained inside the cuvettes. Under such an experimental geometry, we illuminated viruses for 15 minutes at various microwave frequencies or at various Scientific RepoRts | 5:18030 | DOI: 10.1038/srep18030 microwave powers. After illumination, we used buffer to wash-down and collect the viruses, which introduced a 10-fold dilution of virus concentration. Then the illuminated viral solutions, together with the control sets were sent for plaque assay.",

Considering the corresponding dilution factor, the plaque forming unit per mL (pfu/mL) of the original virus can thus be quantified. The titer measurement will be performed three times on the same sample to reduce quantization error. Quantified by the plaque assay, the concentration of active viruses in our prepared viral solutions was around 10 7 /ml for H1N1 and H3N2.",

The sample RNA was extracted and amplified by the RT and quantitative real-time PCR (Primerdesign Precision OneStep \u2122 qRT-PCR Mastermix) with primer AMF (sequence: 5\u2032 -GAGTCTTCTAACCGAGGTCGAAACGTA-3\u2032 ), primer flu-AR (sequence: 5\u2032 -CAAAGCGTCTACGCTGCAGTCC-3\u2032 ) and flu A (5\u2032 -FAM-tttgtgtttacgctcaccgt-TAMRA-3\u2032 ) probe. For control group, RNase was added for 10 minutes digestion and stopped with RNase inhibitor. Then viruses were fractured artificially by freeze-thaw treatment. We thus were able to observe that the RNA signal of virus rose after 15 cycles of the amplification. For pre-treated groups, the RNase treatment were done and stopped before 8 GHz microwave illumination in order to make sure that RNA outside the viral envelope was eliminated in the first place. For the post-treat groups, RNase was added right after the illumination. If the virus particles were fractured, the released RNA would be degraded by RNase.",
