Infections with infectious bronchitis virus (coronavirus) can be transmitted to Galapagos doves [1] . Infections with Newcastle disease virus (paramyxovirus-1) can cause morbidity and mortality in the flightless cormorant, brown pelican, Galapagos penguin, lava gull, Galapagos finches, mockingbirds, and Galapagos pintail [1, 2] . In addition, Mycoplasma gallisepticum infections can cause morbidity and population declines in Darwin's finches, mockingbirds, Galapagos doves, dark-billed cuckoos, and yellow warblers [1, 2] . The use of vaccines in day-old chicks shipped to the Galapagos and after arrival is prohibited. This policy requires high biosecurity standards to mitigate risk of disease transmission between broilers, backyard chickens, and wild birds on the archipelago.",

During 2001-2003, a study conducted on San Cristobal Island produced evidence of prior exposure to several pathogens in 72 broilers including: (i) infectious bursal disease virus, (42%); (ii) infectious bronchitis virus (46%); (iii) Newcastle disease virus (22%); and (iv) M. gallisepticum (7%) [1] . In 2005, a study on Santa Cruz Island revealed that the burden of previous exposure to these four pathogens in 88 broilers varied from 3% to 73% [2] . In both studies, indirect contact with infected backyard chickens or vaccination (although illegal) were suspected as potential risk factors associated with broilers demonstrating positive antibody titers to investigated pathogens. Finally, the study on San Cristobal did not test broilers for intestinal parasites [1] , and the study on Santa Cruz did not find evidence of exposure to intestinal parasites in study broilers [2] . To our knowledge, no other studies have investigated or confirmed the burden of exposure to pathogens in broilers on San Cristobal and Santa Cruz since 2003 and 2005, respectively.",

An important mandate of the ABG is to regulate, control and prevent the introduction and dissemination of introduced species that represent a hazard to Galapagos native species and their habitat. An issue of concern is diseases in poultry that represent a health hazard to poultry, people, and wild birds on the archipelago. The objective of the study reported here was to produce new baseline data on the burden of exposure to infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV), infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), Newcastle disease virus (NDV), M. gallisepticum (MG) and intestinal parasites in a sample of introduced broilers on 13 farms on Santa Cruz Island and San Cristobal Island, Galapagos in July 2017.

Based on a current law and regulations for control of introduced species on the Galapagos (Libro VII del Regimen Especial: Galapagos, Cap\u00edtulo III, Art\u00edculo 6 http:// bioseguridadgalapagos.gob.ec/lista-de-productos-2/) the use of vaccines (e.g., against IBDV, IBV, NDV) in one-day-old chicks shipped to Galapagos, and after arrival, is prohibited. Local authorities do not approve the use of poultry vaccines because poultry are not native island species, and because the use of vaccines in introduced species requires vaccination guidelines supported by a risk assessment that must be approved by local authorities. Chicks are transported by commercial air carriers from Guayaquil to Baltra Island (then crossed by a small ferry to Santa Cruz Island and after by land transportation to the farm) or to San Cristobal.",

It is not clear whether the observed exposure to IBDV or IBD indicates natural exposure or vaccination through accidental or illegal means. Eimeria spp. infection was common in broilers although this finding does not represent a hazard to native wild birds. In addition, we observed interaction between broilers and wild birds (finches) inside broiler pens, as well as the presence of backyard chickens inside property limits of study farms. Study results are relevant because (i) they provide new baseline data on the burden of exposure to avian pathogens in broiler farms, (ii) justify the Table 2 need to verify standard operating procedures in hatcheries that supply (non-vaccinated) dayold chicks to the Galapagos and (iii) to implement enhanced biosecurity standards on broiler chicken farms to mitigate risk of disease transmission between broilers, backyard poultry, and wild birds on the Galapagos. All study farms on Santa Cruz and San Cristobal had ! 1 broilers with positive antibody titers against IBDV. In addition, three of six farms on Santa Cruz and one of seven farms on San Cristobal had ! 1 broilers with positive antibody titers against IBV. Possible explanations for the observed exposure to these two pathogens can be: (i) accidental vaccination (e.g., cross-contamination by spray vaccination in hatchery); or (ii) indirect transmission between infected backyard chickens and susceptible broilers (via farm personnel or use of equipment contaminated with field IBDV and/or IBV strains circulating in backyard chickens nearby study farms); although a limitation in this study was that backyard chickens were not investigated. Two previous studies have produced serologic evidence of exposure to IBDV and IBV in backyard chickens and broilers on the Galapagos. One study on San Cristobal reported that exposure to IBDV was high in both backyard chickens (9/25 = 36%; 95% CI = 20, 55%) during 2001-2003 and broilers (30/72 = 42%; 31, 53%) in November 2003 [1] . Furthermore, that study reported that exposure to IBV was high in both backyard chickens (6/8 = 75%; 41, 93%) and broilers (33/72 = 46%; 35, 57%) during the same time periods; however, the numbers of farms with one or more broilers classified as seropositive to IBDV or IBV were not reported. Another study produced evidence that burden of exposure to IBDV was high in backyard chickens in four flocks (105/119 or 88%; 81, 93%) and broilers on three farms (64/88 or 73%; 63, 81%) located in the same agricultural zone on Santa Cruz in 2005 [2] . The same study produced evidence that exposure to IBV was higher in study backyard chickens (95/119 or 80%; 72, 86%) compared to study broilers (9/88 or 10%; 5, 18%). In addition, the same study [2] , investigated exposure to IBDV and other pathogens in 236 wild birds. All birds were classified as seronegative to pathogens tested including IBDV, NDV, and MG. In that study, one limitation was that serological testing in wild birds required pooling of samples, an inherent bias that could have produced false negative results if too few samples had positive antibody titers to selected pathogens. In the two previous studies [1, 2] backyard chickens and broilers were sampled for detection of IBDV and IBV antibodies on one occasion. Thus, it was not possible to measure seroconversion to these two pathogens and produce serologic evidence of recent infection with IBDV or IBV in either population during the study periods.",

It is possible this is a false positive result because the antibody concentration against NDV in the study broiler was low (i.e., S/P ratio = 0.25), and no other broilers tested seropositive or showed clinical signs associated with NDV infection. Limited funding prevented further testing to reduce false positive results (e.g., testing in series using the HI test, or the use of PCR methods or virus isolation to confirm diagnosis). A previous study produced evidence that exposure to NDV was 16/72 or 22% (14, 33%) on three of five farms in November 2003, and 0/ 27 or 0% (0, 13%) in backyard chickens on San Cristobal during 2001-2003 [1] . In that study, a sample size of 27 backyard chickens was not sufficient to detect exposure to NDV if prevalence of exposure was less than 10% [5] . Another study produced evidence that exposure to NDV was high both in study backyard chickens (53/119 or 45%; 95% CI = 36, 54%) in four flocks and broilers (32/88 or 36%; 27, 44%) on three farms in Santa Cruz in 2005 [2] .

One explanation can be that study broilers were not exposed to this pathogen via (i) vertical (transovarian) transmission or (ii) indirect transmission between infected backyard chickens and susceptible broilers (e.g., contaminated feed or water, shoes, or equipment used by farm personnel). Another explanation can be that the burden of exposure to MG was low (e.g., < 5%), and both the cross-sectional sampling approach (broilers were sampled one time only) and the sample size of 10 broilers per farm were not sufficient to detect low levels of exposure to MG [5] . Previous studies have reported evidence of exposure to MG in broiler chickens on the Galapagos. In the study by Gottdenker et al.

Second, the sample size of 10 broilers per farm was not sufficient to detect one or more broilers as exposed to MG if the burden of exposure per farm was less than 25%. Third, study broilers were blood sampled for detection of selected pathogens on one occasion. Thus, it was not possible to measure seroconversion to these pathogens and produce serologic evidence of recent infection in study broilers. Fourth, detection of antibodies to investigated pathogens was based on one serologic test (IDEXX ELISA) only. Testing in series or testing in parallel (using a second serologic test) could have reduce the risk of potential false positive or false negative results, respectively. Fifth, diagnosis of Eimeria was limited to oocyst morphology. Collection of intestinal scrapings would have been useful for a more accurate diagnosis coccidial infection in study broilers. Finally, backyard chickens were not included in this study, so it was not possible to measure and compare the burden of exposure to investigated pathogens between broilers and backyard chickens.",

For example: (i) use of health records to monitor morbidity and mortality events in broilers; (ii) use of written biosecurity protocols; (iii) use of peripheral fence to keep backyard chickens or other animals out; (iv) poultry pens protected against rodents or native birds; and (v) proper disposal of broiler pen bedding material.",

The implementation of this practice in small poultry operations on the Galapagos, however, can be difficult. Poultry farmers are expected to deliver chilled or frozen chicken meat in the local market (e.g., meat shops, grocery stores, restaurants, tourist boats) once or twice every week. The local business environment justifies the implementation of enhanced surveillance and biosecurity measures identified above.",
