This raised concerns about the effectiveness of the influenza surveillance system, particularly that in the Greater Accra region of Ghana, which recorded no alerts over the past five years. We evaluated the effectiveness of the ILI sentinel surveillance system to determine if its objectives are being met and to assess its attributes and usefulness. The findings of this study are important in order to give useful recommendations to improve the current system.",

This situation is not specific to the GAR alone but is found in all sites in Ghana. In addition, the mainly conservative management of clinical signs and symptoms, of confirmed influenza cases in the health system, without the use of recommended antiviral agents, may partly explain the absence of antiviral susceptibility testing. These shortfalls may, however, be caused by a lack of capacity or resources (antiviral drugs and laboratory reagents) at the sentinel facilities to determine thresholds for influenza alerts and test for antiviral resistance, as was observed in evaluations done in other settings [16, 17] .",

Human infection with zoonotic influenza strains is possible and may cause mild to severe form of the disease. There have been recorded episodes of pandemics in humans over a century due to cross-species transmission of zoonotic respiratory viruses including influenza viruses, notably Spanish flu (1918), severe acute respiratory syndrome (2003) and swine flu (2009), resulting in high morbidity and mortality globally [23, 24] . Thus, the importance of a One-Health approach in the surveillance and response with control of pandemics in an increasingly globalized world is evident. Research findings in Africa, Europe and the Americas, have shown incremental gains derived when interventions are integrated between human and animal health systems [25] . The NIC and Veterinary Service Department in Ghana should collaborate to formalize protocols for engaging each other to integrate influenza surveillance systems in humans and animals, using a One Health approach, as this can provide additional key information on possible cross-species transmission in the country and enhance savings. The usage of one laboratory to test for both human and animal pathogens in Canada was shown to cost about 30% less than the combined original operational costs of testing individually in both laboratories [26] .",

It is sensitive in detecting circulating influenza types, representative of the population under surveillance and timely. However, sentinel sites do not consistently meet annual case detection quotas. There is the need to address shortfalls in the system's objectives as well as improving case detection at sentinel facilities. This would ensure that the successes chocked are not undermined, thereby preventing increasing morbidity and mortality related to influenza infections. Failure of the system to address these shortfalls would also affect Ghana's contribution to the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System. Considering the zoonotic character of most influenza viruses, it is important that a One Health approach is adopted with influenza surveillance in Ghana. We propose strict adherence to case detection targets by individual sentinel sites and determination of alert thresholds for the system to allow for a more effective monitoring of influenza activity in the region for prompt public health actions.",
