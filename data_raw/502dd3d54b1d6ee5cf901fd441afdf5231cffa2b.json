HRV is already known to be one of the most frequently detected respiratory viruses in children (Monto & Sullivan, 1993; Martin, Fairchok et al., 2013) . There are over 100 serotypes of HRV, which would contribute to the frequent repeated infections in young children (Bochkov et al., 2011) . Recent studies have also shown that HRV is associated with lower respiratory tract infections, and it is one of the most important respiratory tract pathogens (Mackay, 2008) . HRV infection may not be highly associated with fever as it was only present at a low rate on HRV-single-positive occasions (11.5 %, 3/26). In fact, in a previous study concerning febrile respiratory tract infections in Japanese paediatric outpatients, HRV was detected in 4.6 % of tested specimens, excluding influenza virus-positive patients (Hara et al., 2014) . Despite being one of the most frequent respiratory virus infections for young children, most cases only experience mild symptoms.",

HBoV1 was detected four times during the study period, and the duration of detection decreased with repeated infection, which may have been related to the child's immunity to HBoV1. The data also suggest that HBoV1 might exist in a latent state after infection and be reactivated by other respiratory viral infections (Jula et al., 2013) . A precise genomic analysis of the HBoV1 strains isolated in this study would enhance our understanding of the reasons underlying repeated detection of HBoV1.",
