In order to identify long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) that may be involved in the development of CTEPH, comprehensive lncRNA and messenger RNA (mRNA) profiling of endothelial tissues from the pulmonary arteries of CTEPH patients was conducted with microarray analysis. Differential expression of 185 lncRNAs was observed in the CTEPH tissues compared with healthy control tissues. Further analysis identified 464 regulated enhancer-like lncRNAs and overlapping, antisense or nearby mRNA pairs. Coexpression networks were subsequently constructed and investigated. The expression levels of the lncRNAs, NR_036693, NR_027783, NR_033766 and NR_001284, were significantly altered. Gene ontology and pathway analysis demonstrated the potential role of lncRNAs in the regulation of central process, including inflammatory response, response to endogenous stimulus and antigen processing and presentation. The use of bioinformatics may help to uncover and analyze large quantities of data identified by microarray analyses, through rigorous experimental planning, statistical analysis and the collection of more comprehensive data regarding CTEPH. The results of the present study provided evidence which may be helpful in future studies on the diagnosis and management of CTEPH.",

A number of gene expression studies conducted in postmortem lung tissue samples from patients with CTEPH have indicated that aberrant processing of the messenger RNA (mRNA) transcriptome in CTEPH may provide a mechanistic convergence between the diverse genetic heritability of this disease and the disruption of fundamental signaling pathways, resulting in the common CTEPH phenotype. Studies conducted in pulmonary endothelial cells have identified differentially expressed genes, which may be involved in the pathogenesis of CTEPH (3, 4) . However, gene expression regulation is a complex process, which involves an interplay between DNA sequence variation, chromatin and epigenetic modifications, protein transcription factors and regulatory noncoding RNAs.",

Pulmonary angiography and right heart catheterization were used in the diagnosis of CTEPH and determination of cardiopulmonary hemodynamics (16) . Mean pulmonary artery pressure >25 mmHg at rest or >30 mmHg during exercise was considered to indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) and the six-minute walk test (6-MWT) were hemodynamic variables applied to assess the cardiopulmonary function and prognosis of the CTEPH patients. At inclusion, all the patients received oral anticoagulants for a minimum of 6 months and underwent PEA in accordance with the guidelines of the Beijing Chao-Yang Hospital (Beijing, China).

            "text": "In the current study, differentially expressed lncRNAs and nearby coding gene pairs were described. The silencing or reduced expression of particular lncRNAs has been previously demonstrated to result in a concomitant reduction in the expression of nearby protein-coding genes, including numerous proteins which are known to govern the regulation of cellular differentiation. In addition, the lncRNAs and nearby coding genes may share upstream regulation or local transcriptional effects (29, 31, (40) (41) (42) . Certain lncRNAs have been reported to increase gene expression. For instance, Evf-2 ncRNA forms a complex with the homeodomain-containing protein Dlx2, which leads to transcriptional enhancement (43) . In addition, heat-shock RNA-1 ncRNA binding to heat-shock transcription factor 1 has been found to result in the induction of heat-shock proteins (44) . Furthermore, an isoform of the ncRNA steroid receptor RNA activator is known to be associated with steroid receptor responsiveness (45) . Finally, \u00d8rom et al (46) recently identified that noncoding RNA-activators 1-7 can enhance the expression of nearby genes. Thus, analyzing the genes nearby to lncRNAs may assist in understanding the involvement of lncRNAs in CTEPH. The majority of lncRNAs have a distinct spatial and temporal specificity in the process of organismal differentiation and development (47) . A previous study, which investigated 1,300 lncRNAs in mice, demonstrated that in particular areas of the brain, there are different expression patterns of lncRNAs (48) . These lncRNA expression signatures have been detected in prostate carcinoma and hepatic tumors (49) . Thus, differential expression patterns of lncRNAs may be present in the pulmonary artery tissues of CTEPH patients, and lncRNAs that are differentially expressed may result in alterations in cellular function, which may be associated with the pathogenesis of CTEPH. In the present study, 464 pairs of differentially expressed enhancer-like lncRNAs and mRNAs, of which 95.3% (442/464) were regulated in the same direction (up or down). Therefore, the present study hypothesized that a number of these lncRNAs enhance the activation of nearby genes.",

The networks intrinsic to the CTEPH phenotype are hypothesized to be involved in the normal functioning of the pulmonary artery endothelium. Based on the information obtained regarding the expression of lncRNAs and mRNAs, Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated. Pairs found to have a significant correlation were selected and used to construct a network. These results demonstrated an association between lncRNAs and mRNAs, indicating that lncRNAs may regulate specific mRNAs, or vice versa. mRNAs are likely to be directly involved in the pathogenesis of CTEPH, while lncRNAs function through the epigenetic modification of mRNAs.",

This gene encodes a member of the natural killer cell receptor C-type lectin family. The natural killer cell has been found to be involved in vascular remodeling, which may lead to pulmonary arterial hypertension (52, 53) . NR_027783 is a 1,199 bp transcript variant 2 from Homo sapiens spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase 1 (SAT1). The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the acetyltransferase family and a rate-limiting enzyme in polyamine metabolism. Numerous studies have demonstrated that the polyamine regulatory pathway is a pharmacological target in pulmonary arterial hypertension (54, 55) . NR_033766 is a 6,384 bp transcript variant 7 from Homo sapiens forkhead box P2 (FOXP2). The FOXP2 gene is involved in the normal development of the areas of the brain controlling speech and language during embryogenesis. In addition, FOXP2 may be associated with a number of biological pathways and cascades, which also influence the development of language. Mutations in this gene result in speech-language disorder 1 (SPCH1), also termed as autosomal dominant speech and language disorder with orofacial dyspraxia. NR_001284 is a 2,783 bp pseudogene, Homo sapiens tenascin XA, the biological function of which remains unclear.",

The authors identified that the most significant functional group consisted of annotation terms associated with gene expression, including transcription regulation, nuclear and DNA-binding transcription factor activity, as well as the regulation of RNA metabolism. In the present study, GO functional enrichment analysis of differentially expressed mRNAs with their coexpressed differentially expressed lncRNA partners, demonstrated that these genes were functionally associated with immune response, inflammatory response, response of wounding and response to endogenous stimulus. Furthermore, pathway analysis revealed that antigen processing and presentation, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and leukocyte transendothelial migration may be involved in the development of CTEPH.
