This field study evaluated treatment with Polyprenyl Immunostimulant (PI) in cats with the non-effusive form of FIP. Because immune suppression is a major component in the pathology of FIP, we hypothesized that treatment with an immune system stimulant would increase survival times of cats with dry FIP. Sixty cats, diagnosed with dry FIP by primary care and specialist veterinarians and meeting the acceptance criteria, were treated with PI without intentional selection of less severe cases. The survival time from the start of PI treatment in cats diagnosed with dry FIP showed that of the 60 cats with dry FIP treated with PI, 8 survived over 200 days, and 4 of 60 survived over 300 days. A literature search identified 59 cats with non-effusive or dry FIP; no cat with only dry FIP lived longer than 200 days. Veterinarians of cats treated with PI that survived over 30 days reported improvements in clinical signs and behavior. The survival times in our study were significantly longer in cats who were not treated with corticosteroids concurrently with PI. While not a cure, PI shows promise in the treatment of dry form FIP, but a controlled study will be needed to verify the benefit.",

With immunosuppression being a major component of pathophysiology, treatment with an immune stimulant is a rational approach. Polyprenyl Immunostimulant (PI) is a veterinary biologic licensed by the U. S. Department of Agriculture for the reduction of the severity of signs of feline herpesvirus and is safe in cats over 8 weeks of age. It was used in our pilot study to treat cats with the dry form of FIP and produced promising results (15) . It upregulates Th-1 type pathway via toll-like receptors (16) and may thus be of benefit in the diseases involving suppression of cellular immunity. In this field study, we tried to determine if PI treatment increases survival time and quality of life in cats diagnosed with dry FIP.",

Only cats in the United States and Canada were accepted. Cats were diagnosed and treated by their primary care veterinarians in conjunction with, in many cases, veterinary specialists. The veterinarians' usual laboratories performed diagnostic tests. The study measured survival times from the start of PI treatment to death or euthanasia in terminal condition. The survival data from this study were compared to the historic data from a number of published articles. The study included cats of all signalments with clinical signs that represented the clinical spectrum of dry form FIP and were accepted and treated regardless of the severity of the disease or current treatments. Addition of appetite stimulants, antiemetics, antibiotics, vitamins, or special diets was not prohibited in our study, but the protocol advised against the use of corticosteroids because they cause immunosuppression. This study was carried out in accordance with the recommendations of the University of Tennessee Office of Laboratory Animal Care.

Following the publication of the article and the note, practicing veterinarians with suspected or confirmed FIP cases contacted the Principal Investigator (AML) via e-mail or phone. All cats diagnosed with dry FIP by their veterinarian were considered and assigned a number (Figure 1) . The initial diagnostics were done by veterinarians and reviewed and assessed for acceptance by AML based on sufficient data to support the diagnosis. In eight instances, AML accepted the cats into the study without all laboratory diagnostics if the diagnosis was made by invasive techniques [immunohistochemistry (IHC), histopathology of biopsied material, or cytology of aspirates]. The initial veterinarian diagnosis was supported using the diagnostic approach proposed by Addie et al. (2) as reflected by our data collection form (Table 1) , which included questions about patient age, history, environment, and observations such as pyrexia, weight loss, lethargy, anorexia, presence of abdominal lesions (masses, enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes). Required laboratory tests included complete blood count, biochemistry, and antibody titers to feline coronavirus (FCoV) and to pathogens that may mimic FIP. Surgical biopsy or aspiration of suspected lesions was encouraged. Necropsy was offered at the University of Tennessee free of charge or veterinarians could provide results of necropsy done by their providers.",

The other 7 cats with ocular signs also had neurologic, abdominal, or non-localized signs and were classified as having mixed form. Neurologic signs, such as seizures, ataxia, and disorientation, were the main reason for the veterinary evaluation in 5/59 cats, and they were categorized as neurologic subform. The \"non-localized\" category (11/59) included cats with persistent fever uncontrollable-with-antibiotics, lethargy, anorexia, and/or weight loss. The mixed subform cats had simultaneous signs from two or more subcategories, such as ocular combined with neurologic signs (e.g., uveitis and seizures).",

The summary of the data for these cats is presented in initially to their veterinarians with signs typical of dry FIP, including inappetance (3/4), lethargy (3/4), and weight loss (4/4). One cat had persistent diarrhea and vomiting; in two of the four cats, abdominal masses were detected by their veterinarians. The A/G ratios for all four cats ranged from 0.3 to 0.5. Three of the four cats were anemic, and all had moderate to high coronavirus antibody titers of 1:320 (K-ELISA), 1:800, 1:1,600 and 1:6,400 (all three by IFA). In two of the four cats, histopathology of biopsied tissues had pyogranulomatous inflammation, and the diagnosis was validated by immunostaining for FCoV antigen. Cat 105, the longest survivor (1,829 days), initially received prednisolone to control the weight loss but the corticosteroid therapy was discontinued at the start of PI treatment. Based on reports by owners and veterinarians, all four cats returned to normal behavior by the first checkup visit, about 1 month from the beginning of the treatment, and the weight either stabilized or increased. The clinical signs of vomiting, diarrhea, lethargy, etc. also resolved. Three cats lost weight before death; data were unavailable for one. The A/G ratios increased after 2 months on the PI treatment in the two longest survivors, and reached >0.8, and anemia improved in one and resolved in another one. The borderline anemia, although somewhat improved, was present in the Cats 2 and 52 survivors and became more pronounced before death. The treatment was stopped after about 700 days in Cat 78, and no laboratory test data are available from that time until his death at 965 days when necropsy was performed. The PI treatment frequency was tapered first to twice weekly and then to once weekly in Cat 105. All cats were euthanized in extremis. The necropsies on the Cat 2 showed lesions consistent with FIP. The necropsy on Cat 78 showed lymphoplasmacytic interstitial nephritis and cystitis cystica without lesions of FIP. Toxicosis, azotemia, and ischemia probably associated with renal failure led to the euthanasia of Cat 105. The ultrasound showed no masses on the internal organs and the results were unremarkable; no necropsy was performed. A number of veterinarians and owners voluntarily provided information on the quality of life in communications, and veterinarians commented from the first recheck on after 30 days of PI treatment using the questionnaire. More quality-of-life-related comments were recorded by veterinarians on medical records which were analyzed. We found improved quality-of-life comments for 32 of the 34 cats that survived for more than 30 days. All comments for those 32 cats indicated an improvement in the perceived quality of life (\"return to normal, \" \"as before the disease, \" \"appears healthy, \" got back to normal routines, and/or improvement in appetite, mobility, socialization, and responsiveness) during the preceding period, most commonly every month on the treatment. Weight stabilized or increased in 31/32 patients, while 1/32 continued to lose weight while showing improvement in behavior and appetite.",

In young cats, with high serum globulin and low A/G ratios, there are few conditions except FIP that are likely. Plasma cell and B-lymphocyte malignancies can produce a monoclonal gammopathy, but these conditions are rare in young cats. Chronic inflammatory or infectious conditions such as chronic abscesses and pyothorax could increase serum globulin levels but these conditions would likely be identified by diagnostic evaluation. Hyperglobulinemia and/or an albumin/globulin (A/G) ratio \u22640.6 were noted in 48 of the 50 (96%) cats; two cats had A/G ratio equal 0.8. At the initial evaluation of the cats in our study, there was hyperglobulinemia in 64.7% of the cats, which is similar to the value reported in the literature in the combined wet-dry group (7) . The albumin/globulin ratio offers the highest positive prediction value for FIP (20) . In our group it was 0.37 \u00b1 0.14, which is consistent with the reported values for FIP in general (20) and lower than the mean and SD reported for the initial presentation by Tsai et al. (7) .",

The prednisolone treatment was tapered and stopped during the first week of the PI treatment and the cat continued gaining weight. The clinical improvements and weight gain in both cats were accompanied by improvements in A/G ratios and hematocrits (Figures 5B,C) . In both cats, PI treatment was either stopped or its frequency was decreased after over 2 years of survival. Cat 105 died of renal failure. Both cats declined at the end of life and were euthanized in extremis. The lack of pyogranulomatous changes in the biopsied tissues in cat 78 is consistent with the observation that cats experimentally infected with FIPV and who had clinical disease and survived were \"free of lesions\" post-mortem (14, 24) . The necropsy changes of mild hepatic firbrosis and mild chronic lymphoplasmacytic interstitial nephritis are not adequate to account for the demise of the cat. There was no evidence of lesions of FIP. The A/G ratio of 0.5 at the initial diagnosis was returned to normal suggesting resolution of the FIP. No necropsy was performed on cat 105.",
