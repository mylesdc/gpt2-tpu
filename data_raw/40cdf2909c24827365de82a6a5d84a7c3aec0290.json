Here, we describe characteristics of animal reservoirs that are required for pathogen spillover. We assembled and analyzed a database of 330 disease systems in which a pathogen spills over from a reservoir of one or more species. Three-quarters of reservoirs included wildlife, and 84% included mammals. Further, 65% of pathogens depended on a community of reservoir hosts, rather than a single species, for persistence. Among mammals, the most frequently identified reservoir hosts were rodents, artiodactyls, and carnivores. The distribution among orders of mammalian species identified as reservoirs did not differ from that expected by chance. Among disease systems with high priority pathogens and epidemic potential, we found birds, primates, and bats to be overrepresented. We also analyzed the life history traits of mammalian reservoir hosts and compared them to mammals as a whole. Reservoir species had faster life history characteristics than mammals overall, exhibiting traits associated with greater reproductive output rather than long-term survival. Thus, we find that in many respects, reservoirs of spillover pathogens are indeed special. The described patterns provide a useful resource for studying and managing emerging infectious diseases.",

Most animal pathogens can infect multiple host species, and pathogen spillover from one host species to another is common [2] . Pathogen spillover has been defined as scenarios in which disease occurrence in a focal population depends on a distinct reservoir source that maintains the pathogen indefinitely [3] . Thus, controlling spillover diseases is complicated by the need to manage not only cases in the target population but also transmission interfaces and reservoir populations. Broadly, a disease reservoir is the source of new cases in a a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 target population.

Ungulates, carnivores, and rodents are the source of most zoonoses [2] , yet recent outbreaks suggest that bats may be a uniquely important reservoir of human pathogens [8, 10] . Reservoir species with fast life history characteristics appear to have higher reservoir competence [11] and contribute disproportionately to cases of some zoonotic diseases [12, 13] . In a study of reservoirs for tick-borne zoonotic diseases, the mammalian species with the fastest life history traits also exhibited the highest reservoir competence [13] . Species with high reproductive output produce a large number of na\u00efve host individuals that can sustain pathogens, even those that induce long-lasting host immunity. For example, the persistence of classical swine fever in pigs and wild boar has been attributed, in part, to high birth rates that maintain a large population of susceptible individuals [14] . Further, because of trade-offs between pace of life and the immune system investment, fast-lived species may exhibit greater reservoir competence through a proneness to acquire, maintain, and transmit pathogens [15, 16] .",

And 3) Are mammalian reservoir species distinct in their life history traits compared to all mammals? Given the strong research bias in favor of human and domestic animal pathogens, we expect that most known disease reservoirs will include mammals.

Searches were conducted using Google Scholar and PubMed with search terms including the scientific names and synonyms of pathogens along with one or more of the following terms: reservoir, reservoir host, epidemiology, ecology, source, spillover, cases, host range, outbreak, and epidemic. We included any pathogen that spills over from one or more non-human animal species to another and causes clinical disease in the recipient (target) species. If, in addition to requiring an animal reservoir host, the pathogen also requires time developing in an external environment, then the environment was included as part of the reservoir. Each record in the resulting database is a unique combination of pathogen, target, reservoir, and geographic region, and is henceforth termed a \"disease system.\" Disease systems were excluded if there was weak or disputed evidence for the ability of the pathogen to cause disease in the target. For example, Sangassou virus, a recently discovered hantavirus in West Africa, has been found in its rodent host and neutralizing antibodies have been found in human fever patients; however, it was excluded from our analysis because the evidence remains inconclusive that it is the cause of human disease [20] . We also excluded any disease system for which the loss of the reservoir would not be likely to eliminate disease in the target because, following established definitions of reservoir and spillover, this could not truly be a reservoir. This most often occurred when spillover was well documented, but populations of the target species alone were sufficient for pathogen persistence.",

Disease systems with single species reservoirs require only a single species, excluding arthropod vectors, for maintenance of the pathogen. For example, most species of hantavirus were found to only depend on a single rodent species for persistence. If genetic evidence suggests distinct pathogen populations amongst different reservoir host populations, the pathogen may be maintained by multiple, single species reservoirs. In contrast, multiple species reservoirs comprise a community of more than one host species where the chronological order in which hosts acquire infection does not affect reservoir capacity and pathogen populations are not distinct between host species within the community. Trypanosoma cruzi uses a multiple species reservoir of sympatric opossums, armadillos, and coatis that together maintain a single pathogen population. A pathogen maintained by a complex reservoir completes each generation across multiple species and/or environments in a chronological order. Complex reservoirs are common to many helminth and protozoan parasites. This is illustrated by the life cycle of Toxoplasma gondii, which requires a suitable external environment, followed by a rodent host, followed by a feline host.",

We inferred the most likely zone for each disease system based on evidence of intraspecific transmission in the target species. We gathered evidence through a literature search focused on epidemiology, transmission, and reports of cases and outbreaks. We aimed to assign the system to the zone that best describes the normal pattern of transmission following spillover. For example, if most spillover events result in a single case, but abnormal secondary transmission events are reported, the system was classified as dead-end. This was the case for many dead-end pathogens transmitted to humans, but for which occasional nosocomial or transplant-associated transmissions are known.",

Briefly, we used the R statistical software to randomly generate a sample of 178 mammalian species from our complete mammalian life history trait database (5,416 species) having the same representation by order as our identified mammalian reservoir species list [40] . We then calculated the mean body masscorrected residual value for a given trait using that randomly generated sample of mammalian species. This process was repeated 1,000 times to generate a distribution of mean residual trait values. The resulting distribution of 1,000 mean values was then compared to our observed mean residual trait value for mammalian reservoir species, allowing us to identify life history traits for which mammalian reservoir species have significantly different values than mammals as a whole. This analysis was repeated with all six life history traits, considering only mammalian reservoirs from systems with humans listed as a target (155 unique species).",

To generate an expected distribution of mean residual trait values, we randomly generated 1,000 sets of mammalian species that had the same taxonomic representation (at the order level) as the unique mammalian reservoir species we identified. By calculating the mean residual trait values for these random sets of species, we were able to generate the mean mass-corrected residual trait distributions displayed in grey. The 2.5 th and 97.5 th percentiles of each distribution are represented with dashed vertical grey lines. For comparison, the observed mean mass-corrected residual trait value of the identified mammalian reservoir species is shown as a vertical black line. Taxonomic and life history characteristics of reservoirs The first two principal component (PC) axes generated from our life history trait residual data together explained over 85% of the variance in the data, with PC1 accounting for 63% and PC2 for 23% ( Table 6 ). The third PC axis only accounted for an additional 7% of the variance explained, and thus we restricted our analysis to the first two PC axes. The first PC axis contrasts litter size and the other life history traits: litter size loads negatively onto PC1 whereas the other life history traits have a positive association with that axis. Neonate body mass and gestation length both have relatively strong negative loadings on PC2, indicating that negative scores on this axis represent a longer gestation length that results in larger neonate body mass ( Table 6 ). Permutation tests revealed that mammalian reservoir species are distinct from all mammals with respect to their PC scores: reservoirs have extreme negative scores for PC1 and extreme positive scores for PC2 (Figs 3 and 4 ).",

            "text": "Pathogen spillover is a common phenomenon driving infectious disease in humans, domestic animals, and wildlife. Intuitively, one might expect that there are some features shared among reservoirs that not only enhance their ability to serve as hosts but also their tendency to be involved in pathogen spillover. While anecdotes and simple summaries indicate that rodents, bats, ungulates, and domestic animals are common sources of human disease, our analysis sought to include spillover pathogens affecting other animals as well. In addition, we aimed to account for publication biases and other attributes of the data that could skew inferences. Further, we investigated whether exceptional life history traits may underlie a mechanism by which reservoirs are associated with spillover. We find that most reservoirs of spillover pathogens include wild animals, include mammals, and are made up of a community. We found more artiodactyl and carnivore and fewer bat and primate species to be reservoir hosts than expected by chance. These findings may signify characteristics of these orders that predispose or prevent them from serving as reservoirs. High priority zoonotic pathogens are more likely to have avian reservoirs, while among pathogens with epidemic potential in the target population, primates are overrepresented despite being relatively uncommon reservoir hosts in general. Finally, compared to mammals overall, mammalian reservoir hosts tend to have faster mass-corrected life history characteristics, specifically those associated with high reproductive output rather than long-term survival. There is widespread debate in the scientific literature surrounding the definition of a reservoir, with the term \"reservoir\" often being used loosely. Our study relied on a clearlydefined reservoir concept [6] to aid in interpretation of the scientific evidence for reservoir identity. For example, rather than simply equating natural infection with reservoir status, we sought evidence that would satisfy both parts of the Haydon et al. [6] definition. We made every effort to seek all available evidence for inconclusive cases but made some partially subjective decisions to exclude disease systems on the basis of insufficient data. We felt justified in these decisions since inclusion of disease systems based on weak or even incorrect data could bias our interpretations more than using a sparser (although possibly non-representative) dataset that included disease systems and host species that have received more extensive research attention.",

For example, one disease system that appears to involve a multiple species reservoir could actually include multiple cryptic disease cycles, each with only one reservoir host species. Indeed, multiple species may overlap in space and act as independent reservoirs without sharing the pathogen, as for cowpox virus in England where both bank voles (Myodes glareolus) and wood mice (Apodemus sylvaticus) serve as distinct, sympatric, single species reservoirs [47] . Alternatively, pathogens we report to have single species reservoirs may in fact depend on multiple species, some of which remain undocumented as hosts. Over half of the reservoirs in our database were classified as multiple species or complex, and two-thirds of disease systems were community-dependent. Our data therefore suggest that most spillover We conducted principal components analysis using mass-corrected residual values for six key life history traits: gestation length (days), litter size, neonate body mass (g), interbirth interval (days), weaning age (days), and age at sexual maturity (days).

The rodent species that appear most often in reservoirs (Rattus spp. and Mus musculus) are associated with human-modified landscapes, and 90% of the disease systems included humans or a domestic animal as a target. Similarly, the association of artiodactyl livestock and domestic carnivores with humans likely drives their orders' high representations among reservoirs, and some pathogens appear to have evolved to exploit the close contact between humans and livestock [49] . Known pathogens of livestock and domestic carnivores are often implicated in spillover events [2] , and artificial selection for increased production in livestock can modify life history traits such that domestic species may be more likely to serve as pathogen reservoirs [50] . Finally, livestock species are kept in high densities, enabling rapid disease spread that can cause significant economic losses and attract increased attention from the scientific community.",

We then used scores from the first two PC axes as variables of interest in imputation tests. To generate an expected distribution of mean PC scores, we randomly generated 1,000 sets of mammalian species that had the same taxonomic representation (at the order level) as the unique mammalian reservoir species we identified. By calculating the mean PC scores for these random sets of species, we were able to generate the mean PC score distributions displayed in grey. The 2.5 th and 97.5 th percentiles of each distribution are represented with dashed vertical grey lines. For comparison, the observed mean PC score of the identified mammalian reservoir species is shown as a vertical black line. Reservoirs were designated as such in previous studies simply based on natural infection. For a given pathogen, evidence of natural infection in a dog, cat, or domestic ungulate is more likely than in other species, including wildlife, owing to the significant research attention given to domestic animals. In contrast, the present study used more stringent criteria for reservoir designation, which resulted in the identification of non-domestic taxa as important zoonotic pathogen reservoirs. However, the use of these criteria limited our sample size because hundreds of systems with weak evidence were excluded (S2 Dataset). This quality over quantity approach may variously bolster or weaken the conclusions presented here.",

Evidence of natural infection in bats is established for dozens of viruses that infect humans [8] , but our analysis only included eight with sufficient evidence in support of bats as the reservoir. Our study does support the role of bats as common reservoirs for high priority viruses that infect humans (Table 5 , S6 and S7 Tables). This suggests that bats and potentially other taxa are particularly suited to act as reservoirs for certain types of pathogens.

The relationship between reservoir competence (defined as the product of a population's susceptibility to infection and infectiousness to na\u00efve vectors or hosts [11] ) and pace of life has been investigated for a number of vector-borne pathogens. Studies have largely found support for a relationship between faster life history traits and greater reservoir competence [12, 13] .

First, we examined mass-independent variation along the fast-slow life history continuum. Most life history traits are significantly correlated with body mass [34] , with small species exhibiting greater reproductive output and faster developmental timing than larger species. By including all mammals listed in Mammal Species of the World [22] , we covered a 10 8 -fold variation in mass between the smallest and largest species [31] . Controlling for mass, we found that the relationship between pace of life and reservoir status persisted. Second, we chose to impute missing values in an incomplete trait database rather than only analyzing species with complete trait data. Although imputing missing life history data leads to more accurate inference [39] , collection of more empirical data on life history traits would be preferable. Life history traits may influence species' abilities to occupy diverse environments. For example, birds in urbanized habitats appear to be especially fecund [54, 55] . Traits associated with reservoir status (e.g., large litter size) may therefore characterize species that are also tolerant of anthropogenic habitat modification. The human population is growing, and disease emergence events have already been linked to anthropogenic disturbances [56] . If the same suite of life history traits predicts both reservoir status and urban adaptability, urban development may inadvertently select for biological communities enriched in pathogen reservoirs.",

In such cases, management of the interspecies transmission interface and reservoir populations may prevent new cases. Diverse reservoir communities and their transmission dynamics may complicate disease management. For example, a transient or uncommon host species may act as a reservoir in the absence of a more permissive species [58] . Thus, control of the primary reservoir host may not effectively reduce disease burden and could, in fact, spread the pathogen to a new host.

(PDF) S1 Fig. Kernel density plots comparing mean mass-corrected residual trait values for all mammalian species versus mammalian reservoir species hosting pathogens with human targets. We conducted imputation tests using mass-corrected residual trait values that were generated by regressing six key life history traits on adult body mass (g). To generate an expected distribution of mean residual trait values, we randomly generated 1,000 sets of mammalian species that had the same taxonomic representation (at the order level) as the unique mammalian reservoir species we identified that hosted pathogens with human targets. By calculating the mean residual trait values for these random sets of species, we were able to generate the mean mass-corrected residual trait distributions displayed in grey. The 2.5 th and 97.5 th percentiles of each distribution are represented with dashed vertical grey lines. For comparison, the observed mean mass-corrected residual trait value of the identified mammalian reservoir species that host human pathogens is shown as a vertical black line. (TIF) S1 Table. Geographical distribution of disease systems. Data show the percentage of disease systems found on each continent. In addition to the pathogen being endemic on a continent, the reservoir and target were also required to occur. Many systems (n = 99) were classified as worldwide and are thus present on each of the listed continents. The number of systems is given in parentheses. \u00c3 The epidemic potential zone subsets represent the transmission potential of the pathogen in the target host population(s) following spillover. The zones are defined as follows: dead-end for a basic reproductive number (R 0 ) nearly equal to zero, stuttering chains for an R 0 greater than zero but less than one, and epidemic potential for an R 0 greater than one. \u2020High priority zoonotic pathogen subsets were determined by estimating the pathogen's representation in the scientific literature using the H-index. Each subset was created to include pathogens that are among the 25% (Top 25%) and 10% (Top 10%) most significant known human pathogens. (PDF) S2 Table. Summary of transmission types found in all disease systems and subsets. Data show the percentage of systems with each type of transmission between the reservoir and the target. A single system may be categorized as showing more than one transmission type. Trophic transmission included both food-and water-borne transmission.
