Based on testing of the hygiene hypothesis, it is now well known that microbial exposure is important for proper development and regulation of the immune system. However, few studies have examined the differences between wild animals in their natural environments, in which they are typically exposed to a wide array of potential pathogens, and their conspecifics living in captivity. Wild spotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta) are regularly exposed to myriad pathogens, but there is little evidence of disease-induced mortality in wild hyena populations, suggesting that immune defenses are robust in this species. Here we assessed differences in immune defenses between wild spotted hyenas that inhabit their natural savanna environment and captive hyenas that inhabit a captive environment where pathogen control programs are implemented. Importantly, the captive population of spotted hyenas was derived directly from the wild population and has been in captivity for less than four generations. Our results show that wild hyenas have significantly higher serum antibody concentrations, including total IgG and IgM, natural antibodies, and autoantibodies than do captive hyenas; there was no difference in the bacterial killing capacity of sera collected from captive and wild hyenas. The striking differences in serum antibody concentrations observed here suggest that complementing traditional immunology studies, with comparative studies of wild animals in their natural environment may help to uncover links between environment and immune function, and facilitate progress towards answering immunological questions associated with the hygiene hypothesis.",

For example, an animal's sex, diet, sociality, life-history stage, and pathogen pressure can influence its immune function [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . One proximal factor widely believed to shape immune function during ontogenetic development is exposure to potential pathogens, including both microbes and macroparasites. In fact, reduced parasitic helminth exposure has been correlated with the increased prevalence of allergy and autoimmune disease in some human populations (reviewed in [8] ). The hygiene hypothesis was originally proposed as an explanation for the commonly observed pattern of increased occurrence of allergic disease in relatively hygienic environments [9] and in human populations with access to modern medicine. This hypothesis has been modified many times, but one of its basic tenets remains the idea that reduced exposure to potential pathogens leads to dysregulated development of immune defense pathways, and consequently to increased risk of allergy and autoimmune disease. Although debate about the implications and breadth of the hygiene hypothesis continues, it is clear that environmental exposure to potential pathogens can play a critical role in the development of the immune system [10] [11] [12] .",

            "text": "A more robust understanding of the effects of ecological variables such as pathogen exposure on immune function might be gained by studying immune function in non-traditional species, and assessing how basic immune defenses differ between wild and captive animals with similar genetic backgrounds. Carnivores are particularly interesting with respect to immune function because they are regularly exposed to pathogens that are capable of infecting both prey and predator. For example, particular Salmonella spp. and Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli are commonly found in wildlife carcasses [20, 21] on which carnivores feed. Furthermore, several carnivores in Africa, including spotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta), regularly test seropositive for anthrax antibodies, yet they show no signs of disease [22] . Wild hyenas are also known to harbor an abundance of parasitic worms of several genera [23] , and survive exposure to a wide array of viral pathogens including but not limited to: rabies virus, canine distemper virus, corona virus, calicivirus, and parvovirus [24, 25] . In the wild, spotted hyenas live in large social groups, which increases the probability of acquiring socially transmitted pathogens [26] . Furthermore spotted hyenas can live more than 20 years, which likely makes their acquired immune system, specifically recall responses, more important than in shorter-lived species, such as mice, that are not re-exposed to the same pathogens over the course of many years [27] . High pathogen exposure rates coupled with low mortality rates from infectious disease suggest that immune function may be particularly robust in wild spotted hyenas.",

To accomplish this, we used an immune defense component model (Fig 1) , modified from Schmid-Hemp and Ebert [28] , to compare immune defenses in wild and captive hyenas along two continua: 1) constitutive to induced defenses, and 2) non-specific to specific defenses. Constitutive defenses are innate defenses that are present in the absence of infection and are functional without prior exposure [28] . Patterns shown here are hypothesized based on existing literature and the locations within the plot were adjusted based on the results of this study. Bacterial killing capacity (BKC) is the least specific defense and also falls at the constitutive end of the x-axis. Specific IgG falls near the induced end of the x-axis, and is the most specific defense represented here. Antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) are specific to nuclear proteins and nucleic acids and can be induced following ligation of endosomal pattern recognition receptors. Natural IgG and IgM are non-specific and can be produced independent of CD4 T cell help. The dashed lines represent primary exposure (left) and secondary (right) exposure.",

Pathogen transmission is often positively correlated with host density, and the effect becomes more pronounced in species that live in large aggregations [44] . Wild hyenas live in social groups that can include more than 100 individuals [45] . By contrast, captive hyenas are housed in groups of two or three. The low number of hyenas in each enclosure reduces the possibility of direct transmission of pathogens among group members via social interactions. Interspecific pathogen transmission between captive hyenas and wild local animals is probably rare because wild animals seldom stray into the hyena enclosures. Wild hyenas are regularly observed feeding on carcasses from which lions, jackals, and vultures, have also fed, and wild hyenas often engage in fierce battles with other carnivores.",

The plates were then washed twice with TBST and non-specific binding was then blocked 1% BSA in TBS. All standards, sera, and detection antibodies were diluted in 1% BSA in TBST. We used pooled sera from both captive and wild hyenas to create a standard curve on each plate. Standard curves were run in duplicate on each plate. The starting dilutions of the pooled sera standard curve were 1:10,000 and 1:100 for total IgG and IgM, respectively, and 12 doubling dilutions were performed. Serum samples were diluted 1:100,000 for IgG and 1:1,000 for IgM and 100 \u03bcl were aliquoted into each well and incubated for 60 minutes. All samples were tested in triplicate. The plates were washed three times with TBST before adding 100 \u03bcl of horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-IgG (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories # 04-20-02) or anti-IgM (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories # 04-20-03) detection antibodies to the plates at concentrations of 0.2 \u03bcg/ml and 0.25 \u03bcg/ml, respectively. The plates were then incubated 60 minutes and washed four times. 100 \u03bcl/well of 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) was used as the substrate for the HRP, and the color change reaction was stopped using 0.2 M H 2 SO 4 .

All bacterial killing assays were conducted in 96-well round bottom plates. All serum samples from both wild and captive hyenas were passed through a 0.22 \u03bcm filter prior to adding to the 96-well plate to remove residual red blood cells and other cellular debris.

After overnight incubation, bacterial cell concentration was adjusted to approximately 10 8 CFU/ml by diluting bacteria in sterile PBS until optical density at 600 nm matched the corresponding turbidity of the McFarland turbidity standard (BD Biosciences # 287298). Bacteria were then serially diluted in PBS to a concentration of 10 4 CFU/ml. Control wells, serum wells and antibiotic wells were next quickly loaded with 50 \u03bcl stock bacteria-containing broth, resulting in a final concentration of 500 CFU/well and a total volume of 100 \u03bcl/well. 50 \u03bcl of sterile MHB were added to blank wells to bring the total volume of each well to 100 \u03bcl. Plates were then placed in an incubator at 37\u00b0C and turbidity was measured after 24 hours on a Bio-Tek plate reader at 600 nm. Percent inhibition was calculated by dividing the optical density of each sample well by the mean optical density of the control bacteria wells. Because the assay allows the bacteria to grow to saturation, there was a clear distinction among wells exhibiting bacterial growth and those without growth. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was defined as the negative log 2 of the lowest dilution that exhibited over 90 percent inhibition compared to the mean of the control wells [55, 56] . For example, if 1:40 was the lowest dilution exhibiting complete growth inhibition, the response variable value would be:-log 2 (1/40) = 5.32. Additionally, the plates were visually inspected to ensure that there was no bacterial growth at the calculated MIC. The mean of triplicates for each sample was used as the final MIC, and we used the combined mean MIC for both E. coli and P. mirabilis as a general measure of serum BKC.",

Age and sex are known to affect aspects of immune function in some species, so we included age in months and sex as covariates in all of the models. Because no single model is a perfect representation of nature [57] , we used an information theoretic multimodel inference approach rather than choosing a single best model [58] . The full models included captivity status, sex, and age as input variables, as well as all twoway interactions between input variables. We explored all possible subsets of the full model, which yielded 18 candidate models for each dependent variable [58] . All subset models were ranked according to Akaike's information criteria corrected for small sample size (AICc) [59] . Models with a difference in AICc of less than two (\u0394 AICc < 2) are considered to be equally good [59] . The top models, those with \u0394 AICc < 2, were then averaged using the 'MuMIn' package in R to produce weighted averages of regression parameter coefficients, 95% confidence intervals, and p-values for each input variable in the top models [47] . In cases where only a single model had \u0394 AICc < 2, we report the results directly from the linear model, rather than weighted averages.",

Previous research in mice showed that approximately 20% of the expanded nAb-producing B-1 cell population showed an activation-induced cytidine deaminase IgM to IgG isotype switch [68] . Repeated stimulation of B-1 cells could lead to a higher proportion of nIgG-producing B-1 cells compared to nIgM-producing B-1 cells, and competition for antigen could further augment production of nIgG and decrease production of nIgM. This might account for the lack of a significant difference in nIgM against KLH in the captive and wild hyenas, and suggests that over the long-term nIgM is the least inducible antibody type described in Fig 1. However, quantification of nAbs against targets other than KLH and a larger sample size would provide greater statistical power to detect differences in nIgM and would help to further clarify this issue.",

Previous work has shown that nAbs, particularly natural autoantibodies, are important for the establishment of self-tolerance [34, 69, 70] . Very little is known about self-tolerance and autoimmunity in wild animals, but in humans, autoimmune diseases are more common in women than men, and are often associated with hormonal changes associated with pregnancy and tolerance to fetal antigens [71] . Despite the positive correlation between autoantibody levels and some autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, high levels of aIgG are associated with a reduced risk of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis [72] . In a well-studied wild population of Soay sheep (Ovis aries) females had higher levels of aIgG than did males, and aIgG-positive females were more likely to survive harsh winters, had higher offspring survival, but reduced fecundity than did autoantibody-negative females [51] , again demonstrating a context-dependent positive role for aIgG. Interestingly, in the study of wild of the Soay sheep the concentration of serum ANAs was positively correlated with the concentration of antibodies that bind antigens derived from an important parasitic trematode [51] . No parasitic helminths have been detected in the captive hyena colony in nearly 30 years by either fecal flotation or during postmortem assessment of the GI tract, whereas every fecal sample ever tested from wild hyenas harbored at least one genus of parasitic helminth egg, and many samples contained thousands of eggs [23] .",

The captive hyenas used in this study were fed a standard diet of 0.5-1 kg of carnivore chow and approximately 0.5 kg of meat and bone daily, which is adequate for maintaining stable body mass. Several days may pass between meals for wild hyenas, and their body masses are highly variable, depending on the size and timing of the last meal. If resources are the primary mediator of the immune defenses tested here, then we would expect to see more variable immune defense levels in wild hyenas. However, our results indicate that variance in immune defenses was similar among captive and wild hyenas. Nevertheless we would need serum samples collected at multiple time points from the same individuals to rule out this hypothesis altogether.",

Importantly, the groundwork for this type of comparative research is already in place in the form of zoos and wildlife research studies that routinely collect tissue samples from captive animals and keep accurate records of the medical history for each animal. The feasibility and impact of comparative immunology research should be augmented by the rapidly increasing availability of published genomes and decreasing costs of monoclonal antibody production, which should allow reagents, such as isotype subclass specific antibodies, to be developed in a cost-effective manner for non-traditional study species. The recent discovery of the important role of TLR10, which is expressed in human and hyenas but not in mice [75] , in the innate immune response to influenza virus in humans [76] suggests that some infectious disease research might progress more rapidly by incorporating comparative studies of non-traditional species.
