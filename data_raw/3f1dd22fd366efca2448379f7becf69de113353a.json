We conducted a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled pilot clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ARMS-I\u2122 (currently marketed as Halo\u2122) in the prevention of URIs. Methods: ARMS-I is patented novel formulation for the prevention and treatment of influenza, comprising a broadspectrum antimicrobial agent (cetylpyridinium chloride, CPC) and components (glycerin and xanthan gum) that form a barrier on the host mucosa, thus preventing viral contact and invasion. Healthy adults (18-45 years of age) were randomized into ARMS-I or placebo group (50 subjects each). The drug was sprayed intra-orally (3\u00d7 daily) for 75 days. The primary objectives were to establish whether ARMS-I decreased the frequency, severity or duration of URIs. Secondary objectives were to evaluate safety, tolerability, rate of virus detection, acceptability and adherence; effect on URI-associated absenteeism and medical visits; and effect of prior influenza vaccination on study outcomes.",

Influenza, coronavirus or rhinovirus were detected in three participants; all in the placebo group. Moreover, frequency of posttreatment exit visits was reduced by 55% in ARMS-I compared to the placebo group (N = 4 and 2, respectively). Fever was reported only in the placebo group. ARMS-I significantly reduced the frequency and severity of cough and sore throat, and duration of cough (P \u2264 .019 for all comparisons). ARMS-I was safe, well tolerated, had high acceptability and high adherence to medication use. Medical visits occurred only in the placebo group while absenteeism did not differ between the two arms. Prior influenza vaccination had no effect on study outcome. Conclusions: This randomized proof-of-concept clinical trial demonstrated that ARMS-I tended to provide protection against URIs in the enrolled study participants, while reducing severity and duration of cough and sore throat. A clinical trial with a larger number of study participants is warranted.",

Although vaccines are generally effective, their coverage and effectiveness vary (40-60%) [1, [14] [15] [16] [17] . Other limitations of vaccinations include vaccine/strain mismatch and \"vaccine hesitancy\" [18, 19] . While neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs, e.g. oseltamivir, zanamivir) are approved in the US to prevent and treat influenza [20, 21] , these agents often induce only a modest decrease in symptom duration in people with uncomplicated illness [22] [23] [24] . NAIs can also be associated with resistance development, side effects, high cost and limited effectiveness [22, [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] .

The hypothesis of the study was that the use of the active product (ARMS-I) sprayed intra-orally 3\u00d7 daily is associated with fewer episodes and a lower duration and symptom severity of acute URIs. Acute URIs were defined as a combination of three of any of the following symptoms: fever (\u226537.8\u00b0C), non-productive cough, sore throat, rhinorrhea (runny nose), sinus congestion (stuffy nose) and malaise [33] . The enrollment target was 100 healthy men and women (18-45 years old, inclusive). Health of study participants was assessed based on patient's recall of symptoms and clinical assessment (inclusion criteria: BMI of 17-35 kg/m 2 , no tobacco/nicotine use for at least 3 months, and nonpregnant or breast-feeding; for all inclusion/exclusion criteria and study design details, see protocol in Additional file 1). Participants were enrolled into the study after informed consent following a clinical trial protocol approved by the University Hospitals Case Medical Center Institutional Review Board for Human Investigation, Cleveland, OH (protocol number 11-11-33, approval date: 12/16/2012, for details regarding background information about the eligible participants and eligibility criteria, see full protocol in Additional file 1). All subjects provided written consent, obtained in accordance with Federal Regulations, and were compensated monetarily for their participation. The written document embodied the elements of informed consent as described in the Declaration of Helsinki and adhered to the ICH Harmonized Guideline for Good Clinical Practice. The clinical trial protocol went through a rigorous review at our Institutional Review Board, and adhered to all components necessary for a pilot clinical study of this nature. Moreover, the protocol was also carefully vetted by Clinical-Trials.gov during registration process (NCT02644135), which did not indicate any deficiencies in trial design. There are no additional currently ongoing clinical trials with this product.",

Then, the number of days for which there was an event per 75 days of person-time follow-up (related to the study duration per subject) was recorded in each group. Since this is a prevention study conducted during the flu season of 2013, we selected 75 days so that we covered the entire season. Next a logistic regression model was constructed. The data were taken at the day level, so the endpoint is yes/no for an event on that day. Furthermore, the data included every day for which there was a completed survey. The endpoints were assessed for each treatment group (placebo vs. ARMS-I). Because there were multiple daily observations for each individual in the study (nominally 75 repeated measures per subject, but different for each subject) an ordinary logistic regression model was inappropriate because the observations within a subject from day-to-day would be expected to be correlated. Therefore, generalized estimating equations were used to fit the regression model. Medical visits (an indicator of whether a subject went to an Emergency Department, an urgent care center or a doctor's office due to URIs symptoms on each day) and absenteeism (an indicator of whether a subject missed school or work or would have missed school or work if it were scheduled on each day) were analyzed the same way as the individual symptom analyses.

Among the 94 enrolled participants, abnormal oral exams were reported for four individuals, of which three belonged to the placebo group (cheek biting for two, and labial mucosal injury in one participant) and one was in the active group (enlarged tonsils at enrollment, not noted at subsequent visits or at end of study). None of these oral events were considered related to the study drug. A total of nine adverse events (AEs) were reported in the study (with a 75-day duration), of which five occurred in the placebo group (headache, two; anxiety, labial mucosal injury and muscle strain, one each), while four occurred in the active group (headache, two; anxiety and extremity rash, one each). None of the AEs were considered related to the study medication.",

In this regard, Lakdawala et al. [49] identified soft palate of the oropharynx as an important site of isolation of transmissible virus and an initial site of infection. Thus, drugs like ARMS-I, that target the oropharynx, could represent an novel approach for the prevention of viral respiratory infections.",
