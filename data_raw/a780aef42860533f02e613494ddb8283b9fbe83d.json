The study of the pathogenesis, spread regularity, and development trend of infectious diseases not only provides a theoretical basis for future research on infectious diseases, but also has practical guiding significance for the prevention and control of their spread. In this paper, a controlled differential equation and an objective function of infectious diseases were established by mathematical modeling. Based on cellular automata theory and a compartmental model, the SLIRDS (Susceptible-Latent-Infected-Recovered-Dead-Susceptible) model was constructed, a model which can better reflect the actual infectious process of infectious diseases. Considering the spread of disease in different populations, the model combines population density, sex ratio, and age structure to set the evolution rules of the model. Finally, on the basis of the SLIRDS model, the complex spread process of pandemic influenza A (H1N1) was simulated. The simulation results are similar to the macroscopic characteristics of pandemic influenza A (H1N1) in real life, thus the accuracy and rationality of the SLIRDS model are confirmed.",

Its advantage is that, according to the characteristics of infectious diseases, the model of infectious diseases is reasonably assumed, the appropriate parameters are set, and the appropriate variables are selected. Then, the dynamic characteristics of infectious diseases can be clearly revealed. It has laid a solid foundation for further analysis of the causes and key factors of the spread of infectious diseases, and for seeking the optimal strategies for the prevention and control of such diseases.",

Some of these are used to study the general laws of infectious diseases, while others are used to study specific infectious diseases, such as HFMD (Hand foot and mouth disease), tuberculosis, AIDS, and so on. In 1760, Bernoulli [7] began using mathematical models to study the spread of smallpox by vaccination. In 1906, Hamer [8] constructed and analyzed a discrete time model for the study of recurrent measles epidemics. In 1927, Kermack and McKendrick [9] proposed the SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) compartmental model for the first time in order to study the epidemic law of the Black Death prevailing in Europe at that time. On the basis of the SIR model's analysis, the \"threshold theory\" was proposed to distinguish the spread or regression of the disease. The validity of the SIR model has been proven by the data regarding large-scale infectious diseases in history, thus the deterministic model [10] based on a differential equation has been widely accepted.",

That model considers that the latency of infectious diseases also has an impact on infectious diseases, so the model is more realistic. Focusing on Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) infectious disease spread in recent years, Safi and Gumel [12] constructed the SEQIJR(Susceptible-Exposed-Quarantine-Infective-Isolation-Recovered) model according to the characteristics of SARS.

Cellular automata can be described as a dynamic system consisting of a transformation function in cellular space, which is discrete in time and space. The cellular automata model can be formally expressed as CA = (L C , S, M, f ), where CA represents the cellular automaton system, L C represents the mesh space which is divided according to given rules, a mesh corresponding to a cell of cellular automata, S represents the set of cell states, M = (C 1 , C 2 , . . . , C n ) represents the set of current cell adjacent to cells, and f represents the transformation function which can transform C n to C, the function that can calculate the state of cell C at t + 1 time according to the state of adjacent cells of cell C at t time. Adjacent cells are Moore neighbors with radius = 1. As shown in Figure 1 , cells can move in eight directions. Misra et al. [16] gave a comprehensive introduction to the theory and application of cellular automata. Since the 1990s, epidemic spread models based on cellular automata [17] [18] [19] [20] have been extensively studied. According to the characteristics and mechanism of AIDS, Pan et al.

Because cellular automata can perform some experiments that cannot be done in real life by modeling, we can analyze the actual situation and obtain the results, in order to solve the complex problems that cannot be dealt with in the deterministic model. It is thus becoming a typical representative of the network dynamics model.",

All things being equal, with the increase of population density, infectious diseases spread faster, and infectious diseases have a greater influence on the population. When analyzing the influence of sex ratio on the spread of infectious diseases, we considered two factors, namely, different influence coefficient and different sex ratio. First, the ratio of males to females was set to 4:1. Because of the large population base of males, infectious diseases have a greater influence on the population when the infection coefficient is greater. Second, the influence coefficients of infectious diseases on males and females were 0.9 and 0.2, respectively. Because infectious diseases have a greater influence on males, when the number of males is larger, the influence of infectious diseases on the population is greater. When analyzing the influence of age structure on the spread of infectious diseases, we simulated three types of population distribution structure, namely, young, adult, and aged, according to the age structure distribution ratio. The number of members of the infected population and deaths in the aged cities were the largest, and the susceptibility of adult cities to infectious diseases was stronger. That is, the uniform distribution of age plays a more active role in the spread of infectious diseases.",
