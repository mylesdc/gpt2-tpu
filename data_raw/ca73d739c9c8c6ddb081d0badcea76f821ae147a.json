Here, we report the construction of a plasmid carrying a cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter-expressed prototype 1947 Uganda MR766 ZIKV cDNA that can initiate infection following direct plasmid DNA transfection of mammalian cells. Incorporation of a synthetic intron in the nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) region of the ZIKV polyprotein reduced viral cDNA-associated toxicity in bacteria. High levels of infectious virus were produced following transfection of the plasmid bearing the wildtype MR766 ZIKV genome, but not one with a disruption to the viral nonstructural protein 5 (NS5) polymerase active site. Multicycle growth curve and plaque assay experiments indicated that the MR766 virus resulting from plasmid transfection exhibited growth characteristics that were more similar to its parental isolate than previously published 2010 Cambodia and 2015 Brazil cDNA-rescued ZIKV. This ZIKV infectious clone will be useful for investigating the genetic determinants of ZIKV infection and pathogenesis and should be amenable to construction of diverse infectious clones expressing reporter proteins and representing a range of ZIKV isolates.

This work describes a model system to produce infectious virus in cell culture. We created a plasmid carrying the prototype 1947 Uganda MR766 ZIKV genome that both was stable in bacteria and could produce high levels of infectious virus in mammalian cells through direct delivery of this DNA. Furthermore, growth properties of this rescued virus closely resembled those of the viral isolate from which it was derived. This model system will provide a simple and effective means to study how ZIKV genetics impact viral replication and pathogenesis. (1) . The approximately 3,423 amino acid viral polyprotein is cleaved by host and viral proteases into structural proteins (capsid [C] , premembrane [prM] , and envelope [E]), which form the infectious virion, and nonstructural (NS) proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5). The NS proteins participate in virion assembly, innate immune suppression, and formation of a cytoplasmic replication complex that replicates the viral genome through a negativestrand RNA intermediate.",

ZIKV emergence in South America in the last 2 years marked the first observation of a link between infections and severe forms of pathogenesis, including microcephaly and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (3) . It is not known if the diseases caused by recent infections are a result of changes to the virus that increase pathogenesis or are influenced by host polymorphisms and immune reactions. The African, Asian, and South American ZIKV isolates are closely related phylogenetically; the original 1947 strain, termed MR766 (accession no. HQ234498) (2) , and a recent isolate identified in Puerto Rico, termed PRV2015 (accession no. KU501215) (4), share 96.9% amino acid identity. Thus, the characterization of sequence changes between these isolates that impact replication and disease should be reasonably straightforward. Such studies would be greatly empowered by the availability of a simple system to assay the functional consequences of altering viral sequences (i.e., a \"reverse genetic\" system).",

These genomes can be cloned into plasmids with elements required for in vitro transcription of the long viral RNA for transfection. Such an approach has only recently been used to rescue a 2010 Cambodia ZIKV isolate (5) . Since flaviviruses have capped RNA genomes, the transcription step can be circumvented by transfecting a plasmid carrying the viral genome under the control of an RNA polymerase II promoter, with the correct 3= end of the viral RNA being generated by a hepatitis D virus ribozyme (HDVr) (6, 7) . The plasmid DNA is required only to initiate transcription of the first round of viral RNA, which can serve as both a translation and a replication template to initiate \"infection\" of transfected cells. Indeed, this is the approach that Tsetsarkin et al. recently used to rescue a 2015 Brazil ZIKV isolate (8) .",

Numerous strategies have been devised to limit and prevent bacterial death, including the use of bacteria that are more resistant to this toxicity, very-low-copy-number plasmids such that fewer viral translation products are produced, and alternative organisms such as yeast for plasmid propagation. Another strategy entails the separation of the viral genome into multiple plasmids, where each piece can be excised by restriction enzyme digestion and ligated into the full-length viral cDNA, which can then serve as the template for in vitro transcription. Here, we used an alternative strategy to stabilize the 1947 MR766 ZIKV genome (2) in bacteria that has been successfully used to stabilize other positive-sense RNA viruses, including transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus and Japanese encephalitis virus (11, 12) and, more recently, the 2015 Brazil ZIKV genome (8) . We identified the major region of the MR766 genome that induced toxicity in bacteria and then cloned this sequence with a synthetic intron insertion to interrupt viral translation in bacteria. This RNA was spliced in mammalian cells to recreate the authentic viral genome, which efficiently initiated infectious virus production.",

In this plasmid, the authentic 5= end of the viral sequence was placed at the transcriptional initiation site of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter, the simian virus 40 (SV40) polyadenylation site terminates transcription, and an HDVr trims the viral genome to its authentic 3= end (Fig. 1B) .

Our first attempts at cloning this region of the ZIKV genome resulted in plasmids with large deletions, which we deduced to likely be a result of homologous recombination events by noting short stretches of sequence similarity at either side of the deleted segment. In an attempt to circumvent this issue, we screened a panel of bacterial strains with documented inefficiencies at homologous recombination. Indeed, using New England BioLabs' Turbo competent cells allowed us to propagate a plasmid bearing the entire ZIKV cDNA. However, all such plasmids continued to lack an intact viral open reading frame due to the presence of either nonsense or frameshift mutations within the NS1 coding sequence. At this stage, we hypothesized that translation of viral polyprotein sequence from this region led to toxicity in bacteria. To test this hypothesis, we inserted a synthetic intron in NS1, such that the coding sequence would be disrupted in bacteria but splicing in mammalian cells would restore the viral RNA ( Fig. 1B and C) . Indeed, this plasmid could be stably propagated in bacteria, thus completing the generation of a plasmid containing the entire ZIKV cDNA. As a negative control for subsequent replication studies, we also generated a version of this plasmid encoding an inactivating GDD to GNN mutation in the viral NS5 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP) catalytic active site [Pol(\u03ea)].",

Three days later, the cells were fixed and immunostained with antibodies against the ZIKV E and NS3 proteins ( Fig. 2A) . While all transfected and infected cells expressed both viral proteins, cells transfected with the wild-type MR766 plasmid exhibited larger amounts of antibody staining than those transfected with the Pol(\u03ea) plasmid. This difference was confirmed by quantifying E protein immunostaining by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis (Fig. 2B ). To examine viral protein expression over time, cells collected at various time points following transfection or infection were analyzed by FACS for E protein antibody staining or by immunoblotting of cell lysates with NS3 antibodies ( Fig. 2C and D, respectively). While the percentage of E protein-positive cells increased over 3 days following transfection with the wild-type MR766 plasmid and infection with the parental MR766 virus, the E protein-positive Pol(\u03ea) plasmid-transfected cells remained below 5% throughout this time course (Fig. 2C ). NS3 protein levels also increased over time in both wild-type plasmid-transfected and parental virus-infected cell populations and yet remained below the limit of detection in Pol(\u03ea) plasmid transfected cells. These results confirmed that although both the wild-type and Pol(\u03ea) MR766 ZIKV plasmids were able to express viral proteins, protein levels were higher and were detected in a greater percentage of cells transfected with the wild-type plasmid, which may be due to viral RNA replication and viral spread.",

The previously developed systems for producing infectious 2010 Cambodia ZIKV and 2015 Brazil ZIKV from plasmids showed that the rescued viruses were attenuated in comparison to the parental inoculum (5, 8) . To compare the fitness levels of our parental and rescued MR766 viruses, we first calculated their Vero cell specific infectivities. To ensure that only virion-associated RNA was quantified, the rescued virus was initially passaged twice at an MOI of 0.1 in Vero cells. The rescued and parental MR766 viruses exhibited similar and not significantly different specific infectivity values of 218 and 130 RNA molecules per TCID 50 (Fig. 4C ). To directly compare growth properties of the 293T cell-rescued MR766 virus to those of the parental inoculum using a strategy similar to that used on previously published systems, we performed plaque assays ( Fig. 4D and E) . When visualized at 4 days postinfection, the rescued and parental MR766 ZIKV-induced plaques exhibited a 1.35-fold, but not statistically significant, difference. According to the work of Tsetsarkin et al., the rescued 2015 Brazil ZIKV isolate made plaques that were 2.5-fold smaller than the parental virus plaques at this time point (8) . A retrospective analysis of plaque sizes in the publication by Shan et al. showed that their rescued 2010 Cambodia ZIKV produced plaques that were approximately 3.3-fold smaller than parental virus plaques at 4 days postinfection (5) . However, we were able to detect slight attenuation of our rescued virus, as we observed statistically significant 2.4-and 2-fold differences in rescued and parental MR766 ZIKV plaque sizes when we stained our plaque assays at 5 and 6 days postinfection, respectively ( Fig. 4D and E) .",

Here, a T7 RNA polymerase promoter directed in vitro transcription of the viral RNA for subsequent transfection into permissive host cells for initiation of infection. Our approach to express the ZIKV RNA from an RNA polymerase II promoter with a ribozyme positioned at the 3= end to trim the viral transcript allowed us to avoid the potentially arduous in vitro transcription step and directly transfect the plasmid into host cells. The Shan et al. system lessened the toxicity of ZIKV cDNA in bacteria by using a very-low-copy-number bacterial plasmid. In our system, the deleterious sequence within the genome was disrupted by the addition of an intron, which allowed the successful amplification of this sequence in a high-copy-number plasmid (Fig. 1) . In a more recent publication, Tsetsarkin et al. described their derivation of a similar plasmidbased rescue system for a 2015 Brazil ZIKV isolate (8) .

Thus, generating high-titer virus stocks in this system required amplification by passage of rescued virus. Our plasmid-based system allowed the production of hightiter virus directly from transfected cells, which results in an increased capacity to generate isogenic virus stocks.

            "text": "Virus produced from the previously published 2010 Cambodia and 2015 Brazil ZIKV isolate rescue systems exhibited slower growth kinetics than the parental viruses, potentially due to sequence diversity within the parental virus populations that provided a fitness advantage (5, 8) . Conversely, our rescued MR766 virus grew identically to the parental isolate in Vero cell multicycle growth curve experiments and produced similarly sized plaques in standard 4-day infection plaque assays. Thus, even though we observed plaque size differences between our parental and rescued virus in extended infection, and thus likely more sensitive plaque assays, we believe that our MR766 rescued virus is less attenuated than the rescued 2010 Cambodia and 2015 Brazil ZIKV. It is unlikely that the methods of rescue (transfection of in vitro transcribed RNA versus plasmid DNA) impacted virus attenuation. Instead, we hypothesize that viral genetics influenced postrescue attenuation, and this may be greatly influenced by the passage history of a viral isolate. The 1947 MR766 isolate may not require the same sequence diversity as the 2010 Cambodia and 2015 Brazil ZIKV isolates to reach optimal fitness in Vero cells. The MR766 virus has been subjected to more rounds of amplification in Vero cells than these more recent strains, which may have preadapted it to efficient cell culture replication. Ultimately, rescued virus attenuation should not be a serious complication to experiments to study viral determinants of replication or pathogenesis. Researchers using any ZIKV rescue system would merely need to monitor the stability of engineered sequences of interest and compare phenotypes between wild-type and mutant viruses rescued in parallel.",

Reporter viruses can be created by cloning fluorescent or bioluminescent proteins into the MR766 plasmid as an efficient strategy to quantify and monitor infections. This system will also permit the modification of viral sequences to study how genetic determinants impact the viral life cycle and pathogenesis. We will also derive analogous plasmids bearing the cDNA sequence of other ZIKV isolates, including those currently circulating in the Americas. Such systems will allow the detailed comparison of the molecular determinants for potential strain-specific ZIKV replication and pathogenesis mechanisms and/or efficiencies.",
