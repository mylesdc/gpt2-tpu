TMV(62A+UPD) showed a drastically reduced accumulation, its coat protein was undetectable in protoplasts, and the inoculated plants remained symptomless. This study analyzed the structures of 3\u2032-UTR of TMV and found that the longer poly(A) tract introduced upstream of UPD reduced viral RNAs accumulation and induced milder symptoms in N. benthamiana. In conclusion, different lengths of the internal poly(A) tract introduced into the TMV 3\u2032UTR lead to structural variations that affect virus accumulation and symptom expression.",

TMV has a wide host range and the symptoms vary with plant species and environmental conditions. In the field, tobacco plants infected by TMV show a typical mosaic pattern of light and dark green colour on the leaves, and distortion of newly emerged leaves. In the greenhouse, TMV infected N. benthamiana plants show severe leaf necrosis and stem collapse, leading to plant death within a few days. Similar to other tobamoviruses, the genome of the TMV-U1 strain 1,2 encodes four major proteins, two RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (p126/p183), a movement protein (p30) and a coat protein (p17.5), which are essential for virus replication, cell-to-cell and long distance movement in plants 3-5 , respectively. A poly(CAA) segment of nucleotides located in the 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) serves as a binding site for the host heat shock protein, HSP101, which is essential for viral translation. The poly(CAA) sequence is functionally similar to a 5\u2032 -cap or a poly(A) tail that recruits host elongation factor eIF4F for viral translation 6-8 . In TMV 3\u2032 -UTR, five pseudoknots (PKs) are present. Three belong to an upstream pseudoknots domain (UPD), and two are located in the tRNA-like structure (TLS) 9,10 . TMV UPD plays an important role in both viral replication and translation. Mutational analysis shows that UPD could interact with eEF1A/GTP with high affinity, and the PK2 and PK3 of the UPD located immediately upstream of the TLS are involved 11,12 .",

Several plant viral RNAs do not have a poly(A) tail, but possess an internal polyadenylate sequence in the 3\u2032 terminal region of their genomes 19 . The length of the poly(A) tract varies in different viruses. So far, internal poly(A) tracts are found in bromoviruses, hordeiviruses, and tymoviruses 20 . Dulcamara mottle virus possesses an internal poly(A) tract in the 3\u2032 -UTR which lacks a 3\u2032 -terminal tRNA-like sequence (TLS). This is different from other tymoviruses 21 .",

HLSV is unable to replicate when the length of internal poly(A) tract is less than 24 nt 25 . Therefore, the 24 nt internal poly(A) tract is the minimal length required for HLSV replication in N. benthamiana. Moreover, HLSV is unable to replicate if the internal poly(A) tract is substituted by TMV UPD sequences, indicating that the internal poly(A) tract is not replaceable. This is different from previous studies that the UPD can functionally substitute for a poly(A) tail in plant and animal cells 26 .",

The TLS mimics the tRNA structure, and it enhances virus translation and promotes minus-strand synthesis 27,28 . In vitro competition experiments reveal that the TMV-TLS has the highest binding affinity for RNA polymerase 29 . Deletion studies of UPD showed that the pseudoknot which is closest to the TLS is essential for TMV replication 11 . It is known that the pseudoknot structure, not sequences in UPD, plays an important role in virus replication. The poly(A) tract is a simple RNA element and its length affects virus replication efficiency of HLSV. In this study, a series of TMV mutants were constructed with different lengths of internal poly(A) tract. The internal poly(A) tract is positioned upstream of UPD in the TMV genome. Results showed that TMV(24A+ UPD) possessed the highest infectivity and induced most severe lethal symptoms. The accumulation of viral RNAs induced by TMV(24A+ UPD) was higher than that of TMV in N. benthamiana. TMV(42A+ UPD) induced necrosis in the inoculated leaves, and systemic movement to the upper leaves was slower than that of TMV(24A+ UPD). The accumulation of viral RNAs of TMV(62A+ UPD) declined rapidly in N. benthamiana protoplasts and infected plants were symptomless after inoculation. The RNA structures of the mutated TMV fragments were subjected to selective 2\u2032 -hydroxyl acylation analyzed by the primer extension (SHAPE) method. Structural change in the 3\u2032 -UTR was dependent on the length of the poly(A) tract that was introduced upstream of the UPD in TMV genomes, and the longer the tract, the lower the viral RNAs accumulation and its infectivity.",

It replicated in N. benthamiana protoplasts and the accumulation of CP was higher than that of TMV in transfected protoplasts (Fig. 2) . N. benthamiana plants inoculated with in vitro transcripts of TMV(24A+ UPD) showed watersoaked lesions on the inoculated leaves and developed severe necrosis 5 days post inoculation (dpi) (Figs 3 and 4) . The stem necrosis observed on TMV(24A+ UPD)-inoculated plant leaves occurred earlier (4 dpi) than that on TMV-infected plants (6 dpi), resulting in a more rapid plant death than plants infected with TMV. Thus, the insertion of a 24 nt internal poly(A) tract upstream of the UPD in the TMV genome results in a higher infectivity and more severe necrosis in the inoculated plants. 25 . Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the same effect would also occur in TMV genome. Two mutant viruses, TMV(42A+ UPD) and TMV(62A+ UPD), were constructed with an introduced poly(A) tract that was longer than 24 nt (Fig. 1) . However, the longer poly(A) tract did not increase TMV infectivity. The viral RNAs accumulation of TMV(42A+ UPD) and TMV(62A+ UPD) were much lower than that of TMV(24A+ UPD) in the transfected N. benthamiana protoplasts. Although the coat protein of TMV(42A+ UPD) could be detected after 48 hours post transfection (hpt) in transfected protoplasts, its expression level was lower than that of TMV(24A+ UPD). Unlike TMV(24A+ UPD) which produced lethal symptoms in N. benthamiana, TMV(42A+ UPD) produced necrotic lesions on the inoculated leaves at 5 dpi, but the upper leaves showed no symptoms (Figs 3 and 4 ). At 7 dpi, severe necrosis appeared on the stem and petioles of the infected plants, but the upper leaves remained symptomless (Fig. 4c) .",

This result is contrary to our result in that the mutant viruses with a longer internal poly(A) tract showed reduced replication in N. benthamiana protoplasts and less virulence in the whole plants (Figs 2 and 4) . The difference between a poly(A) tail and an internal poly(A) tract lies in its relative position in the viral genome. In the mutants, both UPD+ TLS are located downstream of the internal poly(A) tract. The TMV-TLS has been known to function as a 3\u2032 -translational enhancer, which plays a similar role of stabilizing the viral RNA genome. The longer the poly(A) tail, the more stable is the virus. However, the internal poly(A) tract is located upstream of UPD+ TLS, not at the 3\u2032 terminus of its genome. The structure formed by the internal poly(A) tract could affect normal functions of UPD+ TLS, as our results have shown.

TMV(62A+ UPD) showed a reduced viral RNAs expression level and its CP was undetectable in the transfected N. benthamiana protoplasts. The absence of CP suggests that translation of viral proteins may be inhibited.

The structural analysis of TMV(62A+ UPD) showed that the conformation of the original TMV TLS was altered. As TLS is important for TMV replication by enhancing viral RNAs stability during translation, the altered TLS in TMV(62A+ UPD) could be the reason contributing to the lack of CP expression. The larger hairpin loop of the 62 nt poly(A) tract may lead to the absence of CP expression and symptom expression. Most of the cis-acting RNA elements in RNA viruses are local sequences or confined secondary or tertiary structures [40] [41] [42] [43] . The 5\u2032 -and 3\u2032 -UTRs of TMV interact with each other to form a closed loop that initiates virus translation. There is increasing evidence that long-range RNA base paring interactions also have essential functions, such as executing and modulating various viral processes [44] [45] [46] [47] . Therefore, the large hairpin loop in TMV(62A+ UPD) may pose steric hindrance to the region of interaction, or binding to several nucleotides complementary to the 5\u2032 -terminal sequences, preventing the long-range RNA-RNA interaction.",

As the long range interaction of TMV 5\u2032and 3\u2032 -UTRs is mediated through host proteins, instead of direct RNA-RNA interaction 42,47-49 , using full-length RNA for SHAPE analysis would not reflect the long range interaction. The current SHAPE analysis applied has taken rational design that included a sufficiently long region of RNA (about 300 nt) which covers the RNA region of interest, internal poly(A) tract, UPD and TLS sequences. Also, the primer binding at the 3\u2032 -end of TLS sequence would have less effects on the RNA conformations of UPD and internal poly(A) tract. At the 5\u2032 -end of the RNA sequence, there was a short sequence consisting of 14 nucleotides (11nt + UGA) located upstream of the internal poly(A) tract for SHAPE analysis. It is likely that the structure of upstream regions may also be altered. Currently, the results obtained from using the partial sequence of TMV and the mutants have clearly demonstrated the structural differences in the 3\u2032 -UTR. This is a widely accepted strategy used to analyze a local RNA region of interest [50] [51] [52] [53] . In addition, mapping of long RNA using a whole viral genome 54 is not common, as technically it is not trivial to achieve desirable results. Potentially it can lead to mapping of mis-folded structure if the RNA is folded without the appropriate interacting proteins involved. Also, there is a high possibility of having not only one but a mixture of RNA structures and it is difficult to detect and to avoid. It is more straight-forward to verify the folding of 300 nt RNA on native gels to establish appropriate conditions of folding leading to a single structure for analysis. Therefore, we choose RNA sequence covering partial CP ORF and the 3\u2032 -UTR region of TMV and its mutants for the SHAPE analysis. Results showed that the length of introduced poly(A) tract could affect virus replication/accumulation and symptoms induced in N. benthamiana. Additionally, in order to monitor the variation of introduced poly(A) tract in TMV genome, we also verified the genomic sequence of TMV(24A+ UPD) after its replication in N. benthamiana. The result showed that the internal poly(A) tract was also elongated as shown in HLSV. As our results showed that longer poly(A) tract upstream of UPD leads to reduced TMV replication, the Scientific RepoRts | 5:18412 | DOI: 10.1038/srep18412 elongation of internal poly(A) tract is likely to result from polymerase slippage during virus replication and it is an inherent property that exist in both HLSV and TMV mutants.",

It revealed that the longer the introduced poly(A) tract, the lower the virulence of the mutants. This appears to be associated with structural variations and dynamic changes. This research work represents the first application of SHAPE analysis to TMV 3\u2032 -UTR and comparison of the length effect of introduced internal poly(A) tracts on viral accumulation. Our results provide a better understanding of the functions of UPD+ TLS in relation to RNA structures in TMV. In addition, the new knowledge on the effects of different internal poly(A) tract lengths on virus accumulation has potential application in engineering TMV and its mutants into high-efficiency expression vectors.",
