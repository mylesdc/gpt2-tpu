Measurements and Main Results: In 459 patients (285 [62.1%] males; median age, 34.7 [interquartile range, 29.4-41.9] yr), 30-day mortality was 14.6% (64/439) and associated with male sex (adjusted odds ratio, 2.60 [95% confidence interval, 1.17-5.78]), symptom duration greater than 7 days (2.78 [1.40-5.54]), tachycardia (2.99 [1.48-6.06]), hypoxemia (4.40 [2.03-9.51]), and inability to stand (3.59 [1.72-7.50]). HIV was common (355/453; 78.4%), frequently newly diagnosed (124/355; 34.9%), but not associated with mortality. S. pneumoniae (98/458; 21.4%) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (75/326; 23.0%) were the most frequently identified pathogens. Viral infection occurred in 32.6% (148/454) with influenza (40/454; 8.8%) most common. Bacterial-viral coinfection occurred in 9.1% (28/307). Detection of M. tuberculosis was associated with mortality (adjusted odds ratio, 2.44 [1.19-5.01]).",

There is a generalized HIV epidemic (adult prevalence 10.6%) (13) and high tuberculosis (TB) incidence (159 cases per 100,000 population) (14) . These factors create a backdrop distinct from most wellresourced settings and common to many countries in the region that is likely to have a substantial bearing on the epidemiology and etiology of CAP; more comprehensive data are therefore crucial to develop appropriate context-specific management guidelines (15) . Given the continued rollout of antiretroviral therapy (ART) (16) , recent introduction of infant pneumococcal conjugate vaccination (17) , and the broader context of rapidly increasing life expectancy and emergence of chronic noncommunicable diseases (18) , contemporaneous data are vital. We therefore conducted a prospective study of adults hospitalized with CAP to the largest central hospital in Malawi to describe etiology and to identify risk factors for mortality to inform the development of local guidelines for antibiotic choice and severity assessment. Some of the results of this study have been previously reported in the form of abstracts (19, 20) .",

            "text": "Given the observed strong association of hypoxemia with mortality, expansion of supplemental oxygen provision, which across much of sub-Saharan Africa is currently severely limited (39), represents an obvious strategy to be evaluated to improve CAP outcomes. Programmatic interventions in children in low-resource settings based on improved oxygen supply using oxygen concentrators have been associated with a 35% reduction in mortality (40) . The lack of association between respiratory rate and mortality underlines the importance of expanding the availability of pulse oximetry in tandem. Similarly, the association of prepresentation symptom duration with mortality suggests that interventions to improve patient education to alter health care-seeking behavior or referral mechanisms within community healthcare centers should be considered. The continued substantial mortality rate beyond Day 30 also warrants further study to devise targeted interventions to enhance care following discharge from hospital. The use of objective CAP severityassessment tools has been shown to improve the recognition of patients with severe CAP likely to require intensive care support (41) and those with mild disease who can be safely managed as outpatients (42) . Current South African CAP guidelines recommend that CURB65 is used to inform site of care and initial antimicrobial treatment (43) . However, we found that CURB65 showed poor prognostic performance in predicting 30-day mortality in this cohort compared with its performance in CAP cohorts from well-resourced settings (44) . This variation likely reflects differences in microbial etiology, demographics, and comorbidity profiles between this cohort and the patient populations in which CURB65 was derived (29) , and underlines the importance of prospective validation of prognostic tools in relevant settings (29, 44) . The similarly poor performance of the SWAT-Bp score that was derived in a lower respiratory tract infection cohort from Malawi (28), however, highlights the challenges of developing a simple and accurate locally adapted tool. Rather than attempting to derive a single tool capable of accurately predicting mortality across the whole spectrum of disease severity, a tool with high negative predictive performance aimed at identifying those patients with a low risk of adverse outcome suitable for outpatient management may be more feasible and equally useful. In this respect, the SMRT-CO tool performed well with a negative predictive value of 96.8%, but the inclusion *Excluded from multivariable analysis because of prevalence <5%. \u2020 Excluded a priori from multivariable analysis because of assumed collinearity with systolic blood pressure. \u2021 Excluded a priori because of assumed collinearity with MUAC.",

Recent CAP studies corroborate our observation that S. pneumoniae remains the commonest identified cause of adult CAP in sub-Saharan Africa (6, 10, 27) . Universal infant vaccination with pneumococcal conjugate vaccination was introduced in Malawi in 2011, approximately 2.5 years before the start of recruitment. Following the introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination in the United States and South Africa, rates of adult pneumococcal disease (including pneumonia hospitalizations) fell rapidly as a result of indirect protection caused by reduced pneumococcal transmission from vaccine recipients (45, 46) . Further studies are needed to describe the serotype distribution of pneumococcal pneumonia in Malawi, to determine whether targeted vaccination programs of at-risk groups may be beneficial to tackle the persistent burden of adult disease. Recently developed urinary assays that can detect serotype-specific antigens in noninvasive pneumococcal pneumonia may provide a more comprehensive description (47) .",

At 23% of those tested and 16% of the overall cohort, the frequency of TB is similar to that previously reported (7-9; 27), but probably underestimates the true burden given the reliance on spontaneously expectorated sputum specimens and a single specimen submitted for culture. In most sub-Saharan African settings, laboratory diagnosis of TB has until recently relied on sputum smear microscopy that has poor sensitivity, particularly for HIV-associated TB. The World Health Organization has advocated an empirical \"step-up\" approach, whereby antituberculous treatment is initiated for HIV-infected adults with features of severe respiratory infection and negative sputum smears who fail to improve after 3-5 days of antibacterial treatment (48) . Although this approach may limit inappropriate antituberculous treatment, it may miss up to 20% of patients with culture-positive TB and risks delaying treatment in a group of patients with a very high risk of early death (49) . The increasingly available Xpert MTB/RIF assay used in this study offers much improved sensitivity and is now recommended as the first-line diagnostic for HIV-associated TB (50) . Rapid urine-based diagnostics (e.g., urine Xpert MTB/RIF, mycobacterial glycopeptide lipoarabinomannan assay) may have a complementary role to guide initiation of antituberculous treatment, particularly for acutely ill patients from whom sputum is frequently unobtainable (51, 52) .",

Although coisolation may reflect genuine copathogenicity or simply detection of bystander colonizing organisms, more complex relationships in which one organism facilitates the acquisition or pathogenesis of another (e.g., influenza and S. pneumoniae) (54) are possible. Bacterial-viral coinfection has been associated with altered levels of innate immune factors (e.g., CRP and IP10) (55) and a more severe clinical course (56) .

Although the clinical case definition used in this study may have missed some patients with radiographic pneumonia who lacked focal signs at the time of recruitment it nonetheless reflects routine clinical practice and usefully provides data to show how the etiologic spectrum of disease varies with chest radiograph findings (57) . The association of radiographic changes compatible with infection with S. pneumoniae is unsurprising. Although still relatively uncommon, the greater prevalence of invasive Salmonella infection among those lacking radiographic pneumonia has important implications for antimicrobial management. Although specific radiologic features were statistically associated with certain pathogens, the marked interobserver variability in interpretation of these features suggests that the clinical utility of this approach is limited.",

Hence, the applicability of the findings to community-level settings is potentially limited. Extrapolation of these findings to other countries in sub-Saharan Africa must also be done cautiously because of the potential impact that variations in such factors as TB incidence, HIV prevalence, and climate may have on CAP epidemiology and etiology. Given limitations of the healthcare infrastructure in Malawi, chronic comorbid illnesses may be underdiagnosed. Inconsistencies in drug supply, equipment provision, and staff experience may result in variations in CAP treatment that may impact patient outcome but are not fully accounted for in analyses.",

The low rate of bacteremia observed may relate to both prehospital antibiotic use and antibiotic initiation before blood couture collection in hospital, which occurred in up to onethird of patients. Interpretation of the significance of respiratory pathogen multiplex PCR results, particularly for respiratory viruses, is hampered by the lack of data from an appropriate control population.

Accordingly, context-specific approaches to severity assessment and defining empirical antimicrobial treatment are needed. The predominance of S. pneumoniae and influenza suggests significant opportunities for CAP prevention through targeted vaccination programs. Strategies to encourage prompt patient presentation, to increase early detection and treatment of TB, and to improve supportive care, in particular the correction of hypoxemia, should be evaluated in clinical trials to address the high burden of CAP-related mortality. n Author disclosures are available with the text of this article at www.atsjournals.org.",

A PCR assay was performed on NPA specimens for the detection of adenovirus; bocavirus; Chlamydophila pneumoniae;At a Glance CommentaryScientific Knowledge on the Subject: In the antiretroviral therapy era, community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) remains the commonest cause of adult hospitalization and a major cause of mortality in many sub-Saharan Africa HIV-affected countries.What This Study Adds to the Field: In a large prospective cohort of hospitalized adults in Malawi we show that the major burden of hospitalized acute CAP remains in young, HIVinfected patients and that Streptococcus pneumoniae, tuberculosis, and influenza predominate as the major causes. CAP mortality is high compared with populations from well-resourced settings with similar age profiles and is associated with potentially modifiable risk factors including hypoxemia. Death from CAP is poorly predicted by commonly used CAP severity-assessment tools, such as CURB65.coronaviruses 229E, HKU1, OC43, and NL63; enterovirus; human metapneumovirus; influenza A and B viruses; Mycoplasma pneumoniae; parainfluenza virus types 1-4; parechovirus; respiratory syncytial viruses, and rhinovirus. Xpert MTB/RIF assay (Cepheid) and mycobacterial microscopy and culture (BACTEC MGIT 960 Mycobacterial Detection System, Becton Dickinson) were performed on noninduced sputum specimens. When obtained, pleural fluid samples were sent for Gram stain, aerobic culture, mycobacterial microscopy and culture, and pneumococcal antigen testing. Further details of laboratory methods are provided in the online supplement.Statistical analyses were performed with Stata version 12.1 (StataCorp). We tested for differences in continuous variables using Wilcoxon rank sum test, and categorical variables by chi-square test or Fisher exact test as appropriate. Differences in microbial etiology by radiographic status controlling for the effect of HIV were examined using the Mantel-Haenszel method.",
