            "text": "In recent years, there has been an increasing appreciation of the importance of secreted and extracellular proteins that traditionally have been considered as intracellular components. Vimentin is a highly abundant intermediate filament protein, and its intracellular functions have been investigated in a large number of studies. Recently, however, vimentin has been shown to take part in significant processes outside the cell. Our understanding of the functions of extracellular vimentin is, however, limited. In this study we demonstrate that a vimentin specific antibody, obtained by phage antibody technology, promotes tube formation of endothelial cells in a 2D matrigel assay. By binding vimentin, the antibody increases the tube formation by 21% after 5 hours of incubation. Addition of the antibody directly to cultured endothelial cells does not influence endothelial cell migration or proliferation. The enhanced tube formation can be seen for up to 10 hours where after the effect decreases. It is shown that the antibody-binding site is located on the coil 2 domain of vimentin. To our knowledge this is the first study that demonstrates an enhanced tube formation by binding vimentin in a 2D matrigel assay under normoxic conditions.",

            "text": "The intermediate filament protein vimentin exert important intracellular functions, regulating processes like cell migration and sustaining cell integrity. The importance of vimentin-mediated processes was underestimated for years, mainly because vimentin deficient (vim \u2212/\u2212 ) mice initially were described as displaying virtually normal phenotypes and no apparent physiological defects were observed 1 . Eventually, more detailed studies on vim \u2212/\u2212 mice revealed that vimentin has key functions in events of cell signalling, migration and adhesion 2, 3 . The 57 kDa type III intermediate filament protein, consists of a head-, rod-and tail domain and can be post-translationally modified. A large number of phosphorylation sites have been characterised, especially on the head domain where the phosphorylation status regulate filament assembly 4, 5 . Deamination of arginine residues in the head domain leads to citrullination, which may be important in inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis 6 . Vimentin may be further modified by addition of N-Acetylglucosamine or act as a specific target for glycation 7-9 . In addition, proteolytic cleavage by specific caspases and calpain further modify vimentin 10, 11 . Apart from the influence of post-translational modification on filament assembly, the functional effects of modification still remain largely unknown. Possibly due to the high intracellular abundance of vimentin, the extracellular localisation and possible functions has only been described in the last 15 years. Initially, vimentin was found on the surface of activated macrophages, but more recently it has been found on the surface of more cells including circulating tumour cells 12-14 . How the vimentin-mediated processes are regulated remains elusive, and it seems that vimentin is a highly dynamic molecule with tissue specific functions 15-17 . Vimentin has been shown to take part in viral and bacterial infections and may be a key partner in neuronal regeneration [18] [19] [20] [21] . It has been suggested that vimentin may serve as a potential anti-angiogenic target, however, results are contradicting 22-24 . As angiogenesis is an essential part of sustaining oxygen supply in health as well as in disease, potential anti-angiogenic targets have to be carefully evaluated to avoid severe adverse effects by the anti-angiogenic treatment 13 . The ability to form new blood vessels is diminished with age. To increase our cellular and biochemical understanding of this age related decline in angiogenesis, we have previously established long-term in cultivation of endothelial cells 25 . We established that the ability of the endothelial cells to form tube like structures when grown on matrigel decline when allowed to age in culture 25 . To identify change of endothelial cell expression profile that correlates with the loss of ability to form tubes, we applied the phage antibody technology as a discovery tool. The Tomlinson I+J library was applied to select single chain fragment variable (scFv) antibodies against proteins of ageing HUVEC cells by the phage display technology 26, 27 . One of these antibodies, named LOB7, displays pro-angiogenic features in 2D",

            "text": "In this study, we describe a phage display scFv antibody selected against human endothelial cells grown in long-term culture. Mass spectrometry identified vimentin as the antigen of the LOB7 antibody. Increased expression of vimentin has previously been shown in ageing human cells in long-term culture 31 . Vimentin could be detected in the sample of precipitated proteins using a mouse anti-vimentin antibody (V9) in western blotting. To test the specificity of LOB7 and the mouse monoclonal anti-vimentin antibody V9, seven fragments of vimentin were produced as fusions to the pagP proteins all carrying a His-tag. To the left, the fragments F1-F7 are schematically shown. In the right top panel, the seven fragments are detected by an anti-His antibody. In the lower right panel, LOB7 is seen to bind specifically to the F6 fragment. As there is no recognition of the F5 and F7 fragments, the epitope of LOB7 is between amino acid 268 and 396 of vimentin. The mouse monoclonal antibody V9 specifically bind to the F7 fragments, therefor the epitope for V9 is between amino acid 405 and 466. These results were supported by ELISA tests of LOB7 against recombinant vimentin, and recombinant fragments of vimentin. The specificity of the antibody was confirmed by western blot analysis in which V9 and LOB7 were used for detection of vimentin in cell lysate and growth factor reduced matrigel. The antibodies revealed bands sharing the same apparent size. A discrepancy in apparent size of vimentin in matrigel compared to HUVEC lysate was observed (Fig. 1c) . It is known that vimentin can differ in size depending on location 17 and that caspase activity during apoptosis cleaves vimentin into sizes similar to those observed here 32 . The angiogenic effect of targeting vimentin remains unclear. Previously a vimentin specific phage display peptide was shown to promote the tube formation in 2-D matrigel assays by a 2-fold increase 24 . Even small amounts of this peptide induced the formation of tubes, however, the effect was only observed under hypoxic conditions. In contrast a study performed by Beijnum et al. 22 , not relying on 2-D matrigel assays, showed decreased tube formation by targeting vimentin in 3-D collagen assays, in vivo Chick chorioallantoic membrane assay, and in mice models by means of different anti vimentin antibodies 22 . In this study, we have presented an antibody that promotes tube formation under normoxic conditions in a 2-D matrigel assay. The mechanisms mediating the enhanced tube formation were not clarified. However, it was established that the LOB7 antibody does not have a direct influence on migration or proliferation of cultured endothelial cells. It can be hypothesised that the binding site of LOB7 stabilises the focal adhesion points between the cell surface and extracellular matrix. A process in which vimentin has key function 14 . We furthermore show that LOB7 recognises the coil 2 fragment of vimentin. It is of high functional relevance to gain more detailed insight to the epitope of LOB7. Furthermore, future experiments using in vivo models are imperative in order to understand and verify the effect of LOB7.",

All constructs were transformed into E. coli BL21 (Stratagene) and expressed in small scale. In brief, 50 mL cultures were inoculated 1:100 in Terrific Broth media holding 100 \u00b5g/mL ampicillin and grown until OD 600 0.5 where the expression was induced by 1 mM IPTG (Sigma Aldrich). The expression was performed overnight at 30 \u00b0C and 200 RPM. The cells were then spun down at 5000 g for 30 minutes at 4 \u00b0C and the supernatants were discarded. Cell pellets were then resuspended in 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 holding 8 M urea, 500 mM NaCl, 5 mM imidazole, and 1 mM DTT. Next, lysis was conducted with a SONOPLUS ultrasonic homogenizer (Bandelin) with settings 50% pulses of 20 kHz and 28 W. The cells were sonicated in 3 \u00d7 3 minutes including 3 minutes on ice between each round. Finally, lysed cells were centrifuged at 4 \u00b0C and 15.000 g for 30 minutes. The fragments were detected in the supernatants by western blot, conducted as described above.",
