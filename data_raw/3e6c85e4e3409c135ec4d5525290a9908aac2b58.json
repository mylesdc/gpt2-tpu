            "text": "Background: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) can cause recurrent and severe respiratory tract infections. Cytoskeletal proteins are often involved during viral infections, either for cell entry or the initiation of the immune response. The importance of actin and clathrin dynamics for cell entry and the initiation of the cellular immune response against RSV in human immune cells is not known yet. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of actin and clathrin on cell entry of RSV and the subsequent effect on T cell activation and interferon gamma release in human immune cells. Methods: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells and purified monocytes were isolated from healthy adults and stimulated in vitro with RSV. Actin and clathrin dynamics were inhibited with respectively cytochalasin D and chlorpromazine. T cell receptor signaling was inhibited with cyclosporin A. Flow cytometry was used to determine the role of actin and clathrin on cell entry and T cell activation by RSV. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were used to investigate the contribution of actin and clathrin on the release of interferon gamma. Results: Cell entry, virus gene transcription and interferon gamma release are actin-dependent. Post-endocytic processes like the increased expression of major histocompatibility complex II on monocytes , T cell activation and the release of interferon gamma are clathrin-dependent. Finally, T cell receptor signaling affects T cell activation, whereas soluble interleukin 18 is dispensable.",

            "text": "The first line of defense against RSV infection consists of epithelial cells. Upon infection, epithelial cells attract antigen-presenting cells, including dendritic cells and monocytes. Monocytes and macrophages are able to engulf pathogens leading to antigen-presentation. The monocytic cell is one of the major immune cell types that is susceptible to RSV infection and the role of monocytes and macrophages in the pathogenesis of RSV infections has been appreciated for decades [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . During RSV infection in mice, the recruitment of monocytes from the bloodstream limits viral replication and reduces disease severity [8] . Viral particles can interact with receptors at the membrane of monocytes resulting in attachment, uptake and initiation of the immune response [9] [10] [11] . Under many circumstances, actin or clathrin are essential for receptor-mediated internalization [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . Internalization can be regulated differentially dependent on the cell type. Uptake of transferrin occurs clathrindependent in macrophages and is not dependent on clathrin in epithelial cells [17] . Cell-specific differences in entry mechanisms between epithelial cells and fibroblasts have been shown for human cytomegalovirus [18] . Previous studies have studied the internalization of RSV in epithelial cells [19] [20] [21] [22] . No data is available regarding cell entry of RSV in monocytes, which raises the question whether internalization of RSV occurs differentially in innate immune cells. After internalization, immune cells are involved in antigen-presentation, T cell activation and the production of cytokines like interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3). IFN-\u03b3, a type II interferon, plays a critical role in the immune response against viral infections [23] . T cell activation may occur through cytokines like interleukin 18 or through stimulation of the T cell receptor (TCR). The relationship between cell entry, T cell activation and subsequent release of IFN-\u03b3 during RSV infection in primary human cells is unknown. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) provide a useful model to investigate the impact of cellular pathways on antiviral immunity. PBMCs contain important cells that reflect the immune response against RSV like dendritic cells, monocytes and T cells [4, [24] [25] [26] [27] . In this study, we aimed to investigate the regulation of IFN-\u03b3 by actin-and clathrin-dependent mechanisms after stimulation of human immune cells with RSV. For this, we used pharmacological inhibitors to inhibit actin and clathrin. Hereby, the contribution of actin-and clathrindependent processes on cell entry, T cell activation and induction of IFN-\u03b3 in primary human immune cells during RSV infection was studied.",

A representative figure of the gating strategy to determine internalization of RSV into monocytes is shown (Fig. 1a) . Disruption of actin filaments in monocytes with CytoD or Wisko significantly reduces the internalization of RSV whereas inhibition of clathrin with CPZ has no effect on the internalization indicating that cell entry is an actin-dependent process (Fig. 1b) . Extracellular binding of RSV on membrane of monocytes occurred and is not reduced by pre-treatment of monocytes with CytoD or CPZ (Fig. 1c) . To confirm the inhibitory effect of CytoD on cell entry, PBMCs were stimulated with RSV for 24 h and virus gene transcription was measured in monocytes. Treatment of PBMCs with CytoD abrogates virus gene transcription in monocytes whereas CPZ has no effect (Fig. 1d) . Mean percentages of internalization, binding and virus gene transcription in untreated monocytes were respectively 29 %, 13 % and 4 %.",

Whether actin-dependent clustering of nucleolin occurs after RSV infection and whether it is necessary for internalization is unknown. Our finding that intact actin filaments are required for internalization of RSV in monocytes narrows the scope of potential receptors that co-occur with cell entry and are required for internalization. Besides cell entry, intact actin is required for virus filament formation, viral transmission and the production of cell-associated infectious virus by epithelial cells [40] [41] [42] [43] . We observed an inhibitory effect of CytoD on the release of IFN-\u03b3 during an incubation period of 24 h. Inhibition of post-endocytic processes like virus filament formation and transmission could therefore explain the observed reduction of IFN-\u03b3 after treatment with CytoD. However, in our model of PBMCs, monocytes exhibit abortive infection as no replicating virus is detected in the supernatant of PBMCs stimulated with RSV (data not shown). This is in line with the abortive infection of RSV in alveolar macrophages [44] . Therefore, the role of actin on virus filament formation and viral transmission may be applicable to epithelial cells but most likely would not play a role in our model.",

Fusion of the F protein of RSV with the cell membrane could result in entry of viral proteins and might act independently of actin filaments. Clathrin has previously been implicated for internalization of RSV in an epithelial cell line after an incubation period of 20 h [20] . Contrary, others have shown that internalization of RSV after 1 h is not clathrin-dependent [19] . The authors conclude that discrepancies between these studies may arise due to a difference in experimental design. The incubation period of 1 h in our study excludes inhibition of postendocytic processes like viral replication and cell-to-cell transmission. In addition, differences between epithelial cells and monocytic cells have been described previously for internalization of nanoparticles and may explain our results compared to epithelial cells [17] . The role of cellular mechanisms on T cell activation can be studied in our model of PBMCs. Besides internalization, inhibition of actin dynamics reduces the IFN-\u03b3 response. These data suggest that, at least in part, the intracellular compartment is involved in the induction of an adaptive response and binding of RSV to the outer membrane is not sufficient to induce IFN-\u03b3 release. These results are in line with previous data indicating that intact RSV particles are not able to signal via membrane-associated receptors such as TLR4 [45] .",

            "text": "In our study, inhibition of clathrin has no effect on the internalization of RSV by monocytes, but effectively reduces the induction of IFN-\u03b3. CPZ at 5 \u03bcg/ml was the highest tolerable concentration without inducing cytoxicity (data not shown). Our data suggest that activation of T cells by RSV is clathrin-dependent. Calabia-Linares et al. observed the importance of clathrin in the formation of the immunological synapse between T cell and antigen-presenting cells [46] . Possibly, inhibition of clathrin reduces the IFN-\u03b3 release due to improper formation of the immunological synapse and thereby inefficient T cell activation. Less than 1 % of the T cells in the peripheral blood are RSV-specific T cells [47, 48] . Therefore, the relative high percentage of 5-10 % CD69 + T cells after stimulation with RSV in our experiments most likely indicates that a general activation of T cells occurs. We demonstrate that clathrin plays an essential role in the upregulation of RSV-induced MHC-II expression on monocytes . The requirement of clathrin for MHC-II trafficking has been observed previously [49] . The role of MHC-II in the induction of IFN-\u03b3 is strengthened by the observation that inhibition of TCR signaling, as a ligand for MHC-II, reduces the IFN-\u03b3 response, whereas inhibition of IL-18 has no effect. The combination of reduced T cell activation and MHC-II expression suggests that clathrin plays a role in the interplay between innate and adaptive immunity against RSV. Fig. 4 IFN-\u03b3 release after RSV infection is dependent on T-cell receptor signaling. a IL-18 bp was added to PBMCs simultaneously with RPMI, RSV at MOI 1 or heat killed Candida. IFN-\u03b3 release was measured after 24 h. b PBMCs were pre-treated with RPMI or CsA (100 nM). After pretreatment, PBMCs were incubated with RPMI or RSV at MOI 1 for 24 h and IFN-\u03b3 release was measured. Lower limit of detection: 20 pg/ml. Wilcoxon-signed rank test was used for statistical analysis. Data are mean \u00b1 SEM (N = 4-5).

Although others have shown that monocytes can be become infected with RSV and serve as an in vitro model, alveolar macrophages or inflammatory macrophages are the most likely target of infection in vivo [4] . Therefore, there could be differences in the immune response in vivo compared to our model. Pre-treatment of isolated monocytes with the inhibitors and performing a subsequent co-culture with autologous T cells could be considered as an alternative instead of simultaneous culture of all cells present in PBMCs. However, during RSV infection in vivo, multiple immune cells, including monocytes, natural killer cells and T cells are recruited to the lung tissue [8] .",

Post-endocytic processes like the increased expression of MHC-II on monocytes , T cell activation and the release of IFN-\u03b3 are clathrin-dependent. Finally, T cell receptor signaling affects the release of IFN-\u03b3, whereas soluble interleukin 18 is dispensable.

The effect of CPZ on (a) CD4 T cell activation, (b) CD8 T cell activation and (c) MHC-I and (d) MHC-II expression on monocytes cells was determined. Stimulation with PHA (5 \u03bcg/ml) was used as positive control for T cell activation (a-b). One-way analysis of variance with Bonferroni's Comparison Test was used for statistical analysis. Data are mean \u00b1 SEM (N = 4). (*p < 0.05,**p < 0.01,***p < 0.001). (NS = no significant difference between unstimulated and RSV-stimulated cells)",
