Historically, the Spiroplasma spp. were known to associate with only insects, ticks, and plants; however, recent isolations from crustaceans are beginning to change our understanding of the host range (Regassa and Gasparich, 2006) . Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rDNA gene sequences of S. eriocheiris showed that this Spiroplasma strain had a close relationship with S. mirum (Wang et al., 2004a) . S. mirum isolated from the rabbit tick (Haemaphysalis leporispalustris) can infect vertebrates (Kirchhoff et al., 1981; Tully et al., 1982) . It induced the presence of suckling mouse cataract agent (SMCA) (Zeigel and Clark, 1974) . Similarly, S. eriocheiris was detected in the brain of embryonated chickens (Wang et al., 2003) , and it was shown to infect the newborn mouse and cause cataract; adult mice are not infected ( Figure S1 ). Therefore, it is important to study how S. eriocheiris infects mouse cells and its cellular molecular pathogenesis.",

Mollicutes lack a cell wall (St\u00fclke et al., 2009) , and it is well-established that successful colonization of the host cells requires adhesion as the first step. Adhesion of Mycoplasma and Spiroplasma to host cells is a prerequisite for colonization by the parasite and subsequent infection; hence, adhesion-related proteins play an important role in this process (Rottem, 2002; Balish et al., 2003) . The loss of adhesion capacity by mutation results in loss of infectivity, while reversion to the cytadhering phenotype is accompanied by regaining infectivity and virulence (Krause et al., 1982 (Krause et al., , 1983 . Entry of S. eriocheiris involves interaction between the pathogen and host that induces cellular signaling events. However, few studies have focused on how the adhesion-related protein interacts with the host protein.",

Immunofluorescence experiments show ALP was involved in the infection of host cells by the bacterium. The ALP of S. eriocheiris was restrained when the bacteria were incubated with anti-ALP, and therefore the ability of S. eriocheiris to infect host cells was limited. The ALP was confirmed to be present on the outer membrane of S. eriocheiris and plays a crucial role in the bacterial infection of its host cells. When the ALP was restrained, it did not completely abolish S. eriocheiris infection and growth; therefore, the bacterial infection of the host may be a complex process (Figure 7C ).

EGF is a potent mitogenic peptide, also implicated in many non-mitogenic activities such as ion transport (Sardet et al., 1990) , cellular migration (King et al., 1987) , growth and development of various tissues (Carpenter and Cohen, 1997; Somboonwiwat et al., 2005) , and plays a vital role in immune responses (Kansas et al., 1994; Phan et al., 2006) . EGF modules are important for protein-protein interactions and bind many extracellular matrix proteins through the EGF tandem array. For instance, fibulin-1 binds to fibronectin through the EGF domain (Tran et al., 1997) . At the same time, EGF-like domain also plays a key role in the process of bacterial infection of host cells. The cell wall teichoic acid (WTA) of Staphylococcus aureus, which directs interactions with the EGF-like domain of SREC-I, is a key factor that facilitates bacterial colonization in the nasal epithelial cells of humans (Baur et al., 2014) . Similarly, the EGF-like domain was shown to interact with S. eriocheiris ALP in this study. It is likely that the EGF-like domain of FBLN7 binds to ALP and offer an adhesion sites for S. eriocheiris infects the host and accelerates this process. Because the Spiroplasma spp. have no cell wall, ALP may serve a role for interaction with the EGF-like domain as occurs with WTA.",

            "text": "In this paper, the ability of ALP to interact with the EGFlike domain was shown. And this domain containing conserved carboxylated residues and structure with EGF, was an important stimulator of the EGFR signaling. The extracellular regulated protein (ERK) kinases signal transduction pathways in 3T6 cells were restrained when cells were treated with rALP. The ERK pathway is one of the main downstream effectors of the EGFR. It may be due to a competitive activity of ALP against EGF for the EGFR site, as the EGF has a high similarity with EGF-like domain, and then as a consequence the EGFR signaling was restrained and p-ERK was decreased. When different concentrations of rALP with EGF were used to treat the 3T6 cells, the main EGFR signaling, containing RhoA/ROCK (Rho kinase), MEK (MAPK/ERK kinase)/ERK (extracellularsignal-regulated kinase), Akt (protein kinase B), and \u03b2-catenin pathways, were decreased. Previous studies have confirmed that wild-type EGFR undergoes rapid endocytosis after binding to the plasma membrane, followed by lysosomal degradation (Shtiegman et al., 2007) . The small GTPase RhoA has been identified as a negative regulator of EGFR endocytosis via its effector Rho kinase (ROCK) that regulates endophilin A1-mediated crosstalk in specific cell types. Activation of the RhoA effector ROCK phosphorylates endophilin A1 at the Thr-14 amino-acid site, thus reducing the level of EGFR endocytosis (Kaneko et al., 2005) . Hence, the protein competitively combines with EGF, and then the EGFR pathway is restrained upon cellular treatment with rALP; on the other hand, p-RhoA degradation results in increased EGFR internalization and therefore, the EGFR pathway is limited. When the bacteria infect the host cell, the ALP combines with EGF, thus effecting the EGFR pathway and accelerating bacterial infection of the host cell. At the same time, previous studies shown that the Akt signaling play a crucial role on the regulate of cell apoptosis. EFGR signaling play key roles in regulate cell apoptosis, cytoskeleton remodeling, cell proliferationplays and immune responses on, and so on. When S. eriocheiris infect the host cells the EGFR signaling were restrained, and the cells normal metabolism were destroyed, so the bacteria more likely to infect the cell (Riederer and Matus, 1985) .",

There is abundant EGF in the mouse brain at an early stage after birth. Therefore, ALP promoted S. eriocheiris infection in animals by interacting with EGF. The expression levels of EGF dropped significantly several days after birth of the mice. At that point in their development, the target site of ALP was reduced.
