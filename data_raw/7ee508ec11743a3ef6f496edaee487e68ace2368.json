            "text": "The type I interferon (IFN) system is a first line of defense against viral infections. Viruses have developed various mechanisms to counteract this response. So far, the interferon antagonistic activity of influenza A viruses was mainly observed on the level of IFNb gene induction via action of the viral non-structural protein 1 (NS1). Here we present data indicating that influenza A viruses not only suppress IFNb gene induction but also inhibit type I IFN signaling through a mechanism involving induction of the suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS-3) protein. Our study was based on the observation that in cells that were infected with influenza A virus and subsequently stimulated with IFNa/b, phosphorylation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription protein 1 (STAT1) was strongly reduced. This impaired STAT1 activation was not due to the action of viral proteins but rather appeared to be induced by accumulation of viral 59 triphosphate RNA in the cell. SOCS proteins are potent endogenous inhibitors of Janus kinase (JAK)/STAT signaling. Closer examination revealed that SOCS-3 but not SOCS-1 mRNA levels increase in an RNA-and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB)-dependent but type I IFN-independent manner early in the viral replication cycle. This direct viral induction of SOCS-3 mRNA and protein expression appears to be relevant for suppression of the antiviral response since in SOCS-3 deficient cells a sustained phosphorylation of STAT1 correlated with elevated expression of type I IFN-dependent genes. As a consequence, progeny virus titers were reduced in SOCS-3 deficient cells or in cells were SOCS-3 expression was knocked-down by siRNA. These data provide the first evidence that influenza A viruses suppress type I IFN signaling on the level of JAK/STAT activation. The inhibitory effect is at least in part due to the induction of SOCS-3 gene expression, which results in an impaired antiviral response.",

So far two major mechanisms have been described by which NS1 suppresses the initial expression of IFNb. On the one hand NS1 inhibits vRNAmediated induction of the transcription factors interferon regulatory factor-3 (IRF-3), activating protein-1 (AP-1) and NF-kB that target the IFNb promoter. This most likely occurs via binding to the RNA-sensor retinoic acid inducible gene (RIG-I) and inhibition of RIG-I-mediated signaling in response to viral RNA [1, 2] . On the other hand NS1 inhibits maturation [3, 4] and nuclear export of host mRNAs [5] . Other functions of the multifunctional protein include block of activation of the dsRNAactivated protein kinase PKR by direct interaction [6] or activation of the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase PI3K/Akt pathway to prevent premature apoptosis induction [7, 8] .",

Therefore, we analyzed whether STAT phosphorylation patterns are altered in influenza A virus infected cells that were stimulated with IFN at different time points post infection (p.i.). The human alveolar epithelial cell line A549 was infected with the influenza A virus strain A/Puerto-Rico/8/34 (H1N1) (PR8) ( Figure 1A ). Cells were subsequently stimulated with IFNb at given time-points p.i. and STAT phosphorylation was assessed in Western blots. Both STAT1 and STAT2 were readily phosphorylated upon cytokine stimulation in uninfected cells or in infected cells up to 4 h p.i. ( Figure 1A ). Furthermore, virus infection alone resulted in a significant induction of STAT phosphorylation 4-6 h p.i., presumably caused by virus-induced IFN expression. However, at later time points (6-10 h p.i.), in A549 cells both virus-and IFN-induced STAT1 and STAT2 phosphorylation was markedly reduced ( Figure 1A ). Similar patterns were observed upon stimulation of cells with IFNa or upon infection with other viruses, such as the human influenza virus A/Victora/3/75 (H3N2) (data not shown). In addition, this phenomenon could also be detected in other epithelial cells such as the human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293 ( Figure 2E ) or the human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) ( Figure S1B ). Inhibition was not caused by indirect disturbing effects on cellular metabolism or enzyme activities due to ongoing virus replication, since IFNc-induced STAT1 phosphorylation was not affected at all ( Figure 1C ). Finally, involvement of any auto-or paracrine action of virus-induced type I IFN could be ruled out, as the inhibitory effect was also observed in Vero cells lacking functional type I IFN genes ( Figure 1E ).",

This is a novel mechanism by which influenza viruses inhibit the antiviral response of the host and paves the path to efficient virus replication.

            "text": "Decrease of STAT phosphorylation might also be due to the action of virus-induced phosphatases. On the one hand these enzymes may cause direct dephosphorylation of STAT proteins. On the other hand phosphatases could act via an indirect mechanism by dephosphorylation and inactivation of JAKs resulting in an attenuated phosphorylation of STATs. Several protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) are known to mediate dephosphorylation of both, JAKs and STATs [41] . In order to investigate whether influenza A virus activates phosphatases that subsequently target JAKs or STATs, we treated infected or uninfected A549 cells with the well-known tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor sodium vanadate [42, 43] . Uninfected cells or cells infected with PR8 for 10 h were incubated with increasing amounts of this compound 10 min prior to stimulation with IFNb. This time point of infection was chosen since we observed considerable inhibition of IFN-induced STAT1 phosphorylation in the course of infection ( Figures 1A and 1E ). Increasing concentrations of vanadate lead to a gradual shift of the steady state balance of phosphorylation/dephosphorylation. Accordingly, a gradual increase of STAT1 phosphorylation was observed that was similar in both infected and uninfected cells, albeit starting from different basal levels of phospho-STAT1 ( Figures 3A and B ). This is illustrated by an almost identical slope of the regression line in the graphical analysis of the band intensities of the IFNb stimulated samples ( Figure 3B ). If the blockade of IFNb-induced STAT1 phosphorylation would be mediated by specific virus-activated phosphatases, a much steeper slope for vanadate-treated infected cells would be expected. However, the result in Figure 3B indicates that the virus-induced suppression of phosphorylation is not compensated by phosphatase inhibition and consequently no virusactivated phosphatase appears to be involved. In support of these data, phosphatase assays revealed that the overall activity of tyrosine phosphatases in infected cells was not elevated compared to uninfected cells. This is indicated by constant levels of free phosphates released from two different phospho-peptides that represent common tyrosine phosphatase substrates ( Figure 3C ). Thus, involvement of phosphatases in influenza virus-induced alteration of STAT1 phosphorylation can be greatly ruled out.",

Note that the Pol II constructs in use also give rise to expression of second reading frames in the NS, M and PB1 genes (NS2, M2, PB1-F2). 48 h post transfection cells were stimulated with human IFNb (500 U/ml) for 15 minutes. Total protein lysates were subjected to Western blot analysis using anti-phospho-STAT1, anti-phospho-STAT2, anti-STAT1 antibodies. Expression of influenza viral proteins was monitored with antibodies against NP, M1, NS1, PA, PB1 or PB2. (E) HEK293 cells were infected with the human influenza virus PR8 (H1N1) (MOI = 5) for the indicated time points and were subsequently stimulated for 15 min with either human IFNb at a concentration of 100 U/ml.

While SOCS-3 mRNA is strongly and transiently elevated in the early phases of infection, SOCS-1 gene transcription is only significantly induced 15 h p.i.. Elevated SOCS-3 mRNA levels were also observed in other host cell types, such as HUVEC starting 3 h p.i. ( Figure S1A ). Although elevation of SOCS-3 mRNA levels in infected cells was rather transient, there appears to be a robust induction on protein level ( Figure 4C ). First detected at 4 h p.i., SOCS-3 protein levels increased and stayed on a high level throughout the observation period. Strikingly, expression kinetics of the SOCS-3 protein perfectly matched the kinetics of virus-induced inhibition of STAT1 phosphorylation ( Figure 4C ), indicating that both processes are functionally linked.",

This prompted us to analyze whether SOCS-3 transcription might be induced due to an auto-or paracrine action of IFNb expressed during infection. A549 cells were stimulated with IFNb for different time points and SOCS-3 gene induction was measured by qRT-PCR ( Figure 4D ). As a control we monitored expression of 29, 59oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS1) and MxA, genes that are typically induced by IFNb. While OAS1 and MxA mRNAs were readily upregulated upon IFNb treatment SOCS-3 mRNA was not significantly elevated ( Figure 4D ). Similar results were obtained from HUVEC stimulated with IFNb ( Figure S1E ). To further confirm these results we knocked down the IFNAR in A549-cells by an siRNA approach. Although the knock down was efficient and leads to more than 60% inhibition of IFNb induced STAT1 phosphorylation ( Figure 4E ), the induction of SOCS-3 expression was not impaired ( Figure 4F ). SOCS-3 levels in the knock down cells were similar compared to wild type cells and even higher than in the vector control ( Figure 4F ). These results are consistent with data gained from previous experiments in Vero cells ( Figure 1E ) and indicate that neither induction of SOCS-3 mRNA nor inhibition of STAT phosphorylation is dependent on virus-induced type I IFN expression.",

Transfection of RNA from uninfected cells did not result in an increase of SOCS-1 or SOCS-3 gene transcription ( Figure 5A ) or IFNb induction as a control ( Figure 5B ).

This raises the question, which RNA-induced signaling pathways are responsible for SOCS-3 expression. The MKK/p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway [47] [48] [49] as well as the IkB kinase (IKK)/nuclear factor of kB (NF-kB) cascade [50] [51] [52] are both known to be activated by RNA or influenza virus infection and to be involved in the control of SOCS-3 expression. To assess whether the MKK6/p38-or the IKK/NF-kB-module is required for SOCS-3 gene induction, we generated A549 cell lines expressing dominant negative forms of either MKK6 (MKK6Ala) or IKK2 (IKK2KD) (Figure 6A to 6D). These mutants have been previously shown to efficiently block p38 or NF-kB signaling, respectively [52] [53] [54] . To monitor SOCS-3 gene induction, wild type, vector or mutant expressing cell lines were infected with PR8 ( Figure 6A ) or stimulated with RNA from virally infected or uninfected A549 cells ( Figure 6C ). Induction of IFNb mRNA was monitored as a control ( Figure 6B and 6D) . While MKK6Ala expression did not result in significant reduction of SOCS-3 in either infected ( Figure 6A ) or RNA-stimulated cells ( Figure 6C ), transcription is markedly reduced in IKK2KD expressing cell lines. To obtain independent evidence for NF-kB dependence of SOCS-3 gene transcription, A549 wild type cells were incubated with the NF-kB specific inhibitor BAY 11-7085 prior to stimulation with RNA from virally infected or uninfected A549 cells ( Figure 6E ). Again, IFNb mRNA levels were assessed for control purposes ( Figure 6F ). Both, SOCS-3 and IFNb mRNA levels were strongly reduced in BAY 11-7085 treated cells. This indicates that virus-induced SOCS-3 expression strongly depends on IKK2 and NF-kB activation, while the MKK6/p38 appears not to play a prominent role.",

Under the assumption that these cytokines do not additionally induce counteracting processes one can conclude that NF-kB is required, yet not sufficient for the induction of SOCS-3. Thus viral induction of SOCS-3 may require additional factors that are only active in virus-infected cells.

Wild type and SOCS-3 deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) were infected for different time points with PR8. The time of infection was prolonged in comparison to the infection of A549 cells because the human PR8 replicates less efficiently in mouse than in human cells. Following infection lysates of these cells were assessed for STAT1 phosphorylation ( Figure 7A ). Both cell types showed no phosphorylation of STAT1 in the uninfected state. In contrast, infection of SOCS-3 knock out cells resulted in strongly elevated phosphorylation of STAT1 in a sustained fashion. To rule out that this STAT1 phosphorylation is due to altered secretion of IFNb or Figure 7 . Enhanced STAT1 phosphorylation in infected SOCS-3 deficient MEF correlates with elevated induction of IFNb-stimulated genes. Wild type MEF and SOCS-3 knock out MEF were infected with PR8 (MOI = 5) for the indicated times. Subsequently, cell lysates were analyzed for STAT1 phosphorylation (A). For control of productive virus replication, cell lysates were analyzed for viral protein PB1 expression. In (E, F, G) wild type and knock out cells were lysed at indicated time-points of infection. Subsequently RNA was subjected to reverse transcription. cDNA was analyzed in quantitative real time PCR to assess mRNA amounts of three prototype type I IFN-stimulated genes, SP110 (E), interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) (F) and OAS1 (G). Equivalent mRNA amounts were normalized to GAPDH mRNA levels and calculated as n-fold of the levels of untreated cells that were arbitrarily set as 1. In (C) wild type MEF and knock out MEF were infected with PR8 (MOI = 5) or left uninfected. Supernatants were taken 6 p.i. and used for stimulation of wild type MEF for 15 minutes. As control wild type MEF were stimulated with 500 U/ml mouse IFNb for 15 minutes. Cells were harvested and analyzed for the amount of STAT1 and phospho-STAT1 in Western blot analysis by specific antibodies. In (B) and (D) the relative band intensities of phospho-STAT1 of the blots in (A) and (C) were quantified as described. doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1000196.g007 other STAT1-activating cytokines in SOCS-3 deficient cells, we performed conditioned medium experiments ( Figure 7C ). MEF wild type and MEF SOCS-3 deficient cells were infected for 6 h and supernatants were subsequently harvested. Stimulation of MEF wild type cells with these different supernatants for 15 min. revealed no differences in STAT1 phosphorylation, indicating that both infected cell types secrete similar amounts of IFNb and other STAT1 activating cytokines. This is a strong indication that the observed differences in virus-induced STAT phosphorylation are directly due to the presence or absence of SOCS-3 in wild type and knock out MEF, respectively. To answer the question whether enhanced STAT phosphorylation in SOCS-3 deficient cells would also lead to enhanced expression of ISGs, total RNA was isolated at different time points p.i. from infected wild type and knock out cells and monitored for induction of SP110, IRF-1 and OAS1 ( Figure 7E, 7F and 7G ). These genes are described as type I IFN-induced genes [18] . Indeed mRNA levels of all three representative ISGs were elevated in SOCS-3 knock out versus wild type cells at almost every time point during the course of infection. This indicates that enhanced STAT1 phosphorylation and activation in SOCS-3 deficient cells results in elevated expression of ISGs.",

Influenza virus propagation is sensitive to IFN activities and therefore, like other viral pathogens, these viruses do not only induce type I IFN but also antagonize the production and effects of these cytokines at the same time [55] . For influenza A and B viruses, this is accomplished through their non-structural NS1 proteins that are structurally related polypeptides of 26 kDa (A/ NS1) and 32 kDa (B/NS1), which are abundantly expressed in infected cells [55] . NS1 proteins predominantly act on the level of IFN gene induction in infected cells by obstructing RIG-Idependent signaling through interaction with cellular factor(s) and/or sequestration of RNAs generated during virus replication [1, 2, 57] . Some NS1 proteins were also described to inhibit the maturation of cellular pre-mRNAs raising the possibility that this activity additionally reduces production of IFNa/b in infected cells [58, 59] . While NS1 also interferes with the activity of some ISGs, such as the dsRNA dependent kinase PKR [5, 60] , so far no type I IFN antagonistic mechanism was described for influenza viruses that act on the level of IFN signaling rather than gene induction. Here we present data, showing that RNA-induced expression of SOCS-3 in early phases of infection leads to a functional inhibition of IFN-induced STAT activation and gene expression. This is a novel mechanism by which influenza virus suppresses the antiviral response of the host and paves the path to efficient virus replication.",

Instead we observed a significant up-regulation of SOCS-3 by viral 59 triphosphate RNA, indicating that gene induction occurs via accumulation of vRNA during infection. This appears to occur through the RNA-mediated activation of the IKK/NF-kB pathway, most likely activated through engagement of the RNA sensor RIG-I. At a first sight, this might appear controversial since NF-kB activation is among the RIG-I-induced signaling responses and NS1 was reported to inhibit this signaling pathway. However, despite the action of NS1 it is well known that NF-kB is still significantly activated upon influenza virus infection and many NF-kB and IFNb dependent genes are still expressed. We hypothesized previously that the incomplete inhibition conferred by NS1 is an indication that the virus exploits the remaining signaling activities for efficient replication [52, 62, 63] . The findings described here, namely NF-kB dependent induction of SOCS-3 and limitation of type I IFN signaling responses, provide yet another example how influenza viruses take advantage of NF-kB activity.",

Thus there seems to be the need of additional virus or RNA-induced transcription factors. The most likely candidate would be the constitutively expressed interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3), that is known to be simultaneously activated with NF-kB upon virus infection directly via the RIG-I RNA sensing pathway without the need of type I IFN. Furthermore IRF-3 is a factor suppressed by the NS1 protein.",

Although these authors described an inhibitory binding of NF-kB transcription factors to some IFN-induced gene, this mechanism might be cell type dependent since we could not observe similar effects in the cell types used here (data not shown). Thus, the underlying molecular mechanisms appear to be not fully clear. It is striking that the effects described for p50 and p65 knock out cells in these studies fully correlate with our observations in SOCS-3 deficient cells. While in the latter case cells lack the IFNb signaling inhibitor SOCS-3, the p50 and p65 knock out cells are deficient for the factors required for SOCS-3 induction. Thus, given the NF-kB dependent induction of SOCS-3 described in the present manuscript, we provide an additional molecular mechanism that may explain the phenomenon described by Wei et al. [64] .",

Moreover, over-expression of SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 in infected cells revealed that both molecules inhibit antiviral responses. These studies are perfectly complemented by our findings. Here we confirm involvement of RIG-I/MAVS by showing that 59 triphosphate RNA, the ligand for RIG-I, is a major inducer of SOCS-3. Furthermore, the finding that dsRNA is only a weak inducer of SOCS-3 is also consistent with the independence from the dsRNA sensor TLR-3. The only discrepancy of this work and the study of Pothlichet et al. is that they show a dependence on the type I IFN receptor. This may be due to the different virus-strains and cell types used. It is well known that the capability of type I IFNs to induce SOCS proteins is strongly cell type specific [31] . While in some cell types SOCS-3 expression appears to be type I IFN dependent (e.g. fetal liver cells) [31] it is clearly independent of IFN in other cell types [66] . Recently it was shown that SOCS-3 is not significantly induced by IFNa in A549 cells [18] , the major cell type used in our study. Evidence that cell type specificities may be the cause of discrepancy is additionally provided by the fact that Pothlichet et al. show identical induction kinetics of SOCS-1 and SOCS-3. In contrast the kinetics of the two proteins differ clearly in the cells we used, with SOCS-3 being induced much earlier than SOCS-1 on mRNA and protein level.",
