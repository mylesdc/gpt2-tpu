            "text": "To identify malaria antigens for vaccine development, we selected a-helical coiled coil domains of proteins predicted to be present in the parasite erythrocytic stage. The corresponding synthetic peptides are expected to mimic structurally ''native'' epitopes. Indeed the 95 chemically synthesized peptides were all specifically recognized by human immune sera, though at various prevalence. Peptide specific antibodies were obtained both by affinity-purification from malaria immune sera and by immunization of mice. These antibodies did not show significant cross reactions, i.e., they were specific for the original peptide, reacted with native parasite proteins in infected erythrocytes and several were active in inhibiting in vitro parasite growth. Circular dichroism studies indicated that the selected peptides assumed partial or high a-helical content. Thus, we demonstrate that the bioinformatics/chemical synthesis approach described here can lead to the rapid identification of molecules which target biologically active antibodies, thus identifying suitable vaccine candidates. This strategy can be, in principle, extended to vaccine discovery in a wide range of other pathogens.",

            "text": "Human Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) infection is a dramatic public health problem. Today approximately forty percent of the world's population is at risk of malaria. Malaria causes more than 300 million acute clinical cases, and at least one million deaths annually. Ninety percent of malaria deaths occur in sub-Saharan African countries mostly among young children and pregnant women (http://rbm.who.int). Thus, there is an urgent need of a malaria vaccine. However, vaccine discovery, in general and particularly in malaria, is still a very empirical process. In fact, protective antigens do not bear any structural, physico-chemical or sequence-related characteristics that would allow their identification. For protective humoral responses, the only recognized characteristics of antigens are their antigenicity/immunogenicity and accessibility. In addition, the lack of surrogate markers of protection renders the vaccine discovery process difficult and time consuming. Hence, in spite of a constant and impressive progress in molecular biology techniques and antigen identification and expression [1, 2] , vaccine discovery is still labor-intensive, making the approach fastidious, costly and poorly adapted to highthroughput screening. Proper protein folding and solubility remain a limitation in numerous cases. Thus, overcoming the bottlenecks of manufacturing and identification of fragments/proteins, as possible targets of a protective immune response still constitute a scientific and technical challenge.",

            "text": "We addressed this challenge by combining bioinformatics, chemical peptide synthesis and functional protection assays. We focused on the search for a-helical coiled coil motifs that, in general, do not exhibit a folding problem, and are a target of effective antibodies for several current malaria vaccine candidates (eg. LSA-1 [3] , LSA-3 [4] , MSP-3 [5] , and MSP-6 [6] and other pathogens [7] . MSP-1, another leading malaria vaccine [8] , also contains predicted a-helical coiled coil regions (unpublished results). Our choice was based on the following considerations. First, the a-helical coiled coil motif bears a characteristic seven amino acid residue repeat (abcdefg) n with hydrophobic residues located in a and d positions and hydrophilic residues generally elsewhere. This motif can be easily identified by bioinformatic analysis. Secondly, an important known characteristic of the ahelical coiled coil domains is that, taken separately from the whole protein, they frequently and readily fold into the same stable oligomeric structure [9] . Thirdly, for this reason, the a-helical coiled coil fragments are frequently recognized by conformational dependent antibodies, and can similarly elicit antibodies reactive with structurally ''native'' epitopes. In addition, these domains are short (about 40 residues) and can be rapidly produced by chemical synthesis. Furthermore, when the antibodies have an anti-parasite biological activity, this designates the corresponding proteins/ fragments as potential, novel vaccine candidates to be further developed and assessed. Here, we focus on the Pf parasite erythrocytic stage, a target of protective antibodies and describe a straightforward, rapid procedure based on bioinformatic analysis of a-helical coiled-coil motifs and peptide synthesis.",

            "text": "The screening of the Pf genome [10] using generalized sequence profiles [11] identified several hundred proteins containing putative a-helical coiled coil motifs. Through proteome and transcriptome data [12] [13] [14] we assessed which of these molecules are expressed in the Pf parasite erythrocytic stage. The combined analysis/assessment identified over 100 segments associated with this stage and displaying the putative a-helical coiled coil motifs with high probability score (Table S1) . Out of these a-helical coiled coil fragments, in general 30-40 amino acids long, present either in the same protein or in different ones, 95 were chemically synthesized and HPLC purified. Among them, longer peptides (up to 70 amino acids), which contained one or more a-helical coiled coil domains, were also synthesized (antigenS 1, 12 and 83; Table  S1 ). The selected antigens were then tested in ELISA assays for reactivity with three panels of sera obtained from adult donors from Burkina Faso, Tanzania and Colombia, respectively. To our surprise, all of the a-helical coiled coil fragments were antigenic, though the prevalence of responders varied greatly (Tables 1 and  S1 ). In this manner, 71 proteins were identified whose lengths varied from 200 to 10,000 amino acids. Twenty-one peptides with the highest prevalence of responders and ELISA mean OD value were selected for further studies. Variation in recognition among the three panels of sera may be due to differences in the genetic background of the hosts, of the parasites and, most likely, to distinct malaria transmission conditions in the three regions. The high level of recognition of the a-helical coiled coil motifs may be explained by the fact that taken separately from the whole protein these fragments readily fold into the same stable structure in aqueous solution.",

Results show thatwith few exceptions-each antibody preferentially recognizes the peptide against which antibodies were affinity-purified, i.e. they are specific for the corresponding peptide (Table S2) . To determine if non-specific antibody binding to solid phase-adsorbed antigens could be responsible for the rare cross-reactivities detected, ELISA competition assays were performed. To this end, binding of antibodies to the solid phase-adsorbed antigen was competed against increasing concentrations of the homologous or cross-reacting peptides. Only homologous peptides competed best whereas peptides having sequence similarity did not (Figures 2A,  2B , and S2B), or at a much higher concentration ( Figure S2A ) including the shorter Glu-rich peptides derived from the Cterminus of peptide 27 and 45 (Figures 2A and 2B) .

Twelve peptide-specific antibodies proved able to induce a strong (more than 40%) and intermediate (lower than 40%) monocyte-dependent parasite killing (Table 1) , whereas, in the absence of monocytes, no direct effect of antibodies on parasite growth was observed. The effects were in the range observed with antibodies from African adults who have the highest natural protection known against malaria. Therefore peptidespecific, human affinity-purified antibodies were functionally effective as shown by their ability to react with parasite proteins and to inhibit parasite growth. Thus, in vitro functional assays show that peptide-specific antibodies elicited by natural exposure to the parasite can induce protective mechanisms effective against malaria.",

Eleven of them elicited an intermediate or high antibody response, four of which also recognized the parasite protein in infected erythrocytes as determined by IFAT ( Figure 1B ; Table 2 ). As seen before for human antibodies, recognition was restricted to blood stages since sporozoites were negative in IFAT assays (data not shown) and by IFAT competition assays with the corresponding peptide ( Figure 1B ). Anti-peptide 27 mouse antibodies, which are positive in IFAT, are also specific for the homologous peptide 27 but not for the sequence related peptides 9, 12 and 45 (Table S2) . Thus, peptides, which were chosen for their propensity to form ahelical coiled coil, can induce the production of antibodies that recognize epitopes present in the native protein. Improvement of the immunogenicity and structural specificity of the remaining peptides might be achieved in the future by a) a short elongation at the N-and C-terminal ends, b) stabilizing the a-helix as suggested by Cooper et al. and Lu and Hodges [17, 18] and/or c) use of other adjuvants.",

Only one protein contains a signal sequence. Fourteen proteins are predicted to be in the cytoplasm, one in the nucleus, one in the mitochondria, and one in the peroxysomes (Table S3 ). The prediction of the sub-cellular localization of these proteins should be taken with caution because gene annotation is being constantly updated and/or protein trafficking of the parasite is complex and not fully elucidated [23] . Further investigations will be required to determine the actual localization of the corresponding antigens. The predicted localization is a priori surprising for molecules able to trigger an ADCI activity. However, recent studies have shown that in addition to merozoite surface proteins, soluble proteins released at the time of schizont rupture were equally effective at triggering ADCI provided they defined at least two epitopes [24] , which is the case for a-helical coiled coil heptad repeats. Therefore, molecules expressing a trans-membrane domain that can be exported to the parasite or host cell membrane, as well as molecules present in the cytoplasm of maturing schizonts and released by bursting schizonts can trigger antibodies to cross-link Fc-c receptors on monocytes to achieve Pf parasite killing.",

After 48 h and 72 h, 50 ml of culture medium were added to each well and after 96 h the ADCI assay was stopped and the final parasitemia was determined by light microscopy on Giemsa-stained smears by counting $50,000 red blood cells. For each Ab tested, duplicate wells included the following controls 1) non-specific monocytic inhibition, both MN+parasite, and MN+N-IgG+parasites and 2) direct inhibition by control or test IgG, both N-IgG+parasites, and test Abs+parasites. PIAG and N-IgG were used at a final concentration of 1 mg/ml as positive and negative controls respectively. Immunopurified tests Abs were used at 15 mg/ml. The Specific Growth inhibitory Index (SGI) which considers the parasite growth inhibition due to the effect of test Abs cooperating with MN was calculated as follows: SGI = 1006[12(% parasitemia with MN and test Abs/% parasitemia test Abs)/(% parasitemia with MN and N-IgG/% parasitemia N-IgG)].
