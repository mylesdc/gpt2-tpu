            "text": "Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia is a heterogeneous genetic disease that is characterized by cilia dysfunction of the epithelial cells lining the respiratory tracts, resulting in recurrent respiratory tract infections. Despite lifelong physiological therapy and antibiotics, the lungs of affected patients are progressively destroyed, leading to respiratory insufficiency. Recessive mutations in Dynein Axonemal Intermediate chain type 1 (DNAI1) gene have been described in 10% of cases of Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia. Our goal was to restore normal ciliary beating in DNAI1-deficient human airway epithelial cells. A lentiviral vector based on Simian Immunodeficiency Virus pseudotyped with Vesicular Stomatitis Virus Glycoprotein was used to transduce cultured human airway epithelial cells with a cDNA of DNAI1 driven by the Elongation Factor 1 promoter. Transcription and translation of the transduced gene were tested by RT-PCR and western blot, respectively. Human airway epithelial cells that were DNAI1-deficient due to compound heterozygous mutations, and consequently had immotile cilia and no outer dynein arm, were transduced by the lentivirus. Cilia beating was recorded and electron microscopy of the cilia was performed. Transcription and translation of the transduced DNAI1 gene were detected in human cells treated with the lentivirus. In addition, immotile cilia recovered a normal beat and outer dynein arms reappeared. We demonstrated that it is possible to obtain a normalization of ciliary beat frequency of deficient human airway epithelial cells by using a lentivirus to transduce cells with the therapeutic gene. This preliminary step constitutes a conceptual proof that is indispensable in the perspective of Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia's in vivo gene therapy. This is the first time that recovery of cilia beating is demonstrated in this disease.",

The prevalence is approximately 1 in 12,000-20,000 [1] [2] [3] . About 50% of patients affected by PCD have a situs inversus which results from monocilia dysfunction at the embryonic node [4] . This association is referred to as Kartagener's syndrome (OMIM #244400) [5] . PCD causes chronic sinus and bronchial respiratory infections that begin early in life, leading to nasal polyps and bronchiectasis. Males are frequently sterile due to dysfunctional spermatozoa flagella [6] . Other symptoms can also be associated with PCD like hydrocephalus, anosmia, retinitis pigmentosa and congenital heart diseases [7] [8] [9] [10] .",

Three parameters were investigated: (1) the multiplicity of infection (MOI), (2) the moment of infection and (3) whether using a polycation, Polybrene, or not. Two different moments of infection during Jorissen's culture were tested: at J+1, cells were ciliated and in suspension or at J+3, cells were de-differentiated and adherent. Two days post-infection, reporter gene expression was analyzed by FACS ( Figure 1 ). In any of the selected conditions, HAECs were transduced but the proportion of transduced cells seemed to be dependant on MOI irrespective of the other parameters, and apparently higher at MOI 75. Then, transduction of cells infected at J+1 seemed more efficient compared to cells infected at J+3. At MOI 75, approximately 38% of cells infected at J+1 were transduced versus 20% for cells infected at J+3. Moreover, these results seemed to be improved by the use of Polybrene. Finally, at MOI 75, transduction efficiency was quantified at about 38% for cells infected at J+1 without Polybrene compared to approximately 50% for cells infected at J+1 with the use of Polybrene. These experiments which were not repeated, demonstrated that HAECs could be transduced in a variety of conditions and that J+1 with Polybrene at a MOI of 75 were presumably the best experimental conditions for HAECs infection. Therefore, we selected these conditions for further experiments.",

In this autosomal recessive disease, cilia of the epithelial cells that border the upper and lower respiratory tracks are not functioning. As a result, patients suffer from recurrent airway infections leading progressively to respiratory insufficiency. There is no treatment as of today that could restore normal ciliary beating. In this report, we showed that it is feasible to transfer a therapeutic gene to human airway epithelial cells with a lentivirus. This transferred gene is transcribed and expressed. Moreover, defective cells that had immotile cilia due to compound heterozygous mutations in the DNAI1 gene recovered ciliary beating after treatment with a lentivirus containing a normal DNAI1 gene. This is the first report on gene therapy in Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia. Since lentivirus is able to insert therapeutic genes into the cell genome, this result may have impact on in vivo gene therapy in this disease and in diseases related to human epithelial airway cells such as cystic fibrosis.",

Previous studies showed that Murine Leukemia virus (MuLV) [28] and Feline Immunodeficiency Virus pseudotyped with VSV-G envelope [29] could transduce HAECs in culture. Though, this transduction was only possible from the basolateral surface of polarized HAECs. We did not know whether a Simian Immunodeficiency Virus would transduce although we could foresee that transduction would be more efficient from the basolateral surface of HAECs since it was pseudotyped with VSV-G. We did not know also whether dedifferentiated cells would be transduced. It appeared that whatever the conditions used in this study, a certain proportion of cultured HAECs were infected. We then selected the conditions that seemed to provide the higher percentage of infected cells in culture. In any case, these conditions are strikingly different from in vivo situation where HAECs are a component of a complex epithelium recovered by a thin layer of mucus. Moreover, Polybrene which seemed to improve viral infection in cultured cells cannot be used in vivo due to side-effects. In a next step, we demonstrated transcription and translation of the transduced DNAI1 cDNA. Finally, we showed that DNAI1-mutated HAECs treated by DNAI1 gene transfer recovered ciliary beating whereas GFP-treated cells' cilia remained immotile, thus supporting our concept that PCD gene therapy was possible using DNAI1 gene. This conceptual proof is essential in the perspective of a human gene therapy.",

In the mouse model, ciliated cells renewal was reported to be provided by Clara cells which are also essential in the alveolar type II cells generation [34] . Nevertheless, Park et al. reported that after an injury event, murine ciliated epithelial cells could transdifferentiate into other cell types and restored the airway epithelium [35] . In the human airway epithelium, Hajj et al. demonstrated that basal cells were able to regenerate as well as to differentiate into secretory and ciliated cells [36] . Targeting these basal cells with a lentiviral vector would result in the stable integration of the therapeutic gene with no need to repeat infections. The specificity of cells' targeting has been recently improved by taking into account the presence of proteases at the cell surface [37] . Thus, cell transduction can be achieved only in cell types that have the capacity to bind viral surface glycoprotein and to cleave the protease substrate because the surface glycoprotein of several enveloped viruses are expressed as precursor proteins that need to be cleaved into two subunits by cellular proteases to promote cell entry.",

However, another vector should be considered for this gene because of size limitation of lentivirus. As an alternative, AAV vectors offer a good safety profile in particular because viral DNA does not integrate into the genome of transfected cells. However, AAV repeated administration triggers anti-viral immune response and its packaging capacity is too limited to hold the DNAH5 gene (13.9 kb). High-capacity episomal vectors offer the possibility to deliver not only a large gene but also the whole genomic locus including regulatory regions which ensures a physiological expression with tissue and time specificity. However, delivery of extrachromosomal DNA with non viral or viral strategies is so far limited to cell lines. This system, tough, is appropriate for long-term treatment as in PCD because chromosome-based episomal systems contain elements enabling the cell to process episome as an additional chromosome with a mitotic stability .99% in cell lines [38] .",
