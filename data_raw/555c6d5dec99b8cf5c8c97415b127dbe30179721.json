Here, we report the 3.7 \u00c5 resolution cryo-electron microscopy reconstruction of an enteroaggregative Escherichia coli baseplate subcomplex assembled from TssK, TssF and TssG. The structure reveals two TssK trimers interact with a locally pseudo-3-fold symmetrical complex comprising two copies of TssF and one copy of TssG. TssF and TssG are structurally related to each other and to components of the phage T4 baseplate and of the type IV secretion system, strengthening the evolutionary relationships among these macromolecular machines. These results, together with bacterial two-hybrid assays, provide a structural framework to understand the T6SS baseplate architecture.",

These findings were reinforced upon determination of cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) and cryoelectron tomography structures of the TssB-TssC sheath in the contracted and extended states, which provided insights into the mechanism associated with effector delivery to recipient cells and subsequent recycling of the T6SS needle [18] [19] [20] [21] .

Integrating our data with previous work, we propose a complete model for the needle and baseplate components and a putative assembly pathway of the T6SS apparatus.",

To understand the architecture of the T6SS baseplate, we overexpressed and purified an EAEC complex comprising full-lengh TssF and TssG (residues 64-366) as well as the shoulder and neck domains of TssK (TssK SN , residues 1-315) (Fig. 1b) . We omitted from our construct the C-terminal domain of TssK (head domain), which participates to attaching the baseplate to the membrane complex, as it was previously shown to be poorly ordered and highly dynamic relative to TssK SN 24 . Size-exclusion chromatography indicated TssK SN -TssF-TssG eluted as a~400 kDa complex comprising multiple copies of one or several constituting proteins (Fig. 1c, d) , as reported 24, 27 . Processing of the cryoEM data set revealed TssF-TssG was mobile relative to TssK and we relied on extensive 3D classification of the data, to computationally isolate a homogeneous subset of particle images 29 , as well as multi-body focused refinement with density subtraction 30 (Fig. 2a-f ). The final cryoEM map has an overall resolution of 3.7 \u00c5 (3.9 \u00c5 for the TssF-TssG focused map) and is best resolved for the region corresponding to TssK, TssG, and the C-terminal domains of TssF (Fig. 2e, Fig. 3a , b, and Table 1 ).

The architecture of the two TssK SN trimers in the TssK SN \u2212TssF \u2212TssG complex is very similar to the one observed in the TssK structure determined in complex with nanobodies nb18 and nb27 using X-ray crystallography 24 (1.1 \u00c5 r.m.s.d. over 230 aligned C\u03b1 carbons). The TssK SN trimer folds as an N-terminal \u03b2-sandwich (shoulder domain) followed by a four-helix bundle (neck domain) and resembles phage receptor-binding proteins 24 . Each TssK SN trimer attaches to one of the two extended loops protruding from the TssG C-terminal domain. Loop 1 anchors a TssK trimer near the apex of the pseudo-threefold symmetrical (TssF) 2 -(TssG) 1 C-terminal triangle, whereas loop 2 binds another TssK SN trimer at the periphery of the triangle (Fig. 5a -d and Fig. 6a ). The two TssK trimers are tilted~60\u00b0relative to each other and interact together, burying an average surface area of 1000 \u00c5 2 at their interface. These results likely explain the observation of TssK trimers and of TssK trimers and hexamers for the EAEC and Serratia marcescens orthologues, respectively, as the protein forms homotrimers that interact with each other within and across wedges 28, 41 . TssG interacts with excellent surface complementarity with the N-termini of the TssK trimers. Specifically, three residues from loop 1 (Met228, Leu236, and Met242) or three residues from loop 2 (Leu308, Leu319, and Met325) project into the hydrophobic cavity defined by the N-terminal 15 residues of a TssK trimer, and these interactions are further strengthened via hydrogen-bonding and salt bridges at the periphery (Fig. 6b, c) . TssG loop 1 and loop 2 bury an average of 1066 \u00c5 2 and 1249 \u00c5 2 at the interface with a TssK trimer, respectively, whereas TssF weakly interacts with TssK within a baseplate wedge. Key hydrophobic residues in the TssKbinding loops are conserved (or conservatively substituted) across TssG orthologues found in distant Gram-negative bacterial species and TssG paralogues from different T6SSs (Fig. 6d, e) . These findings indicate that the interaction between TssG and TssK are most likely a common feature of T6SSs. Binding of TssK to TssG is reminiscent of the attachment mode observed for receptor-binding proteins to phage baseplates, such as in the cases of TP901-1 42 or p2 43 although the molecular details of the interactions are distinct.",

We next confirmed that the C-terminal domain of TssG acts as an adaptor for the TssK SN -TssF-TssG complex by interacting with TssK and with TssF ( Fig. 6f and Supplementary Figure 1 ), as observed in the atomic model. We interpret the lack of TssG C -T25 interactions with TssF and with TssK as a result of steric hindrance mediated by fusing the adenylate cyclase T25 domain at the C-terminus of the TssG C-terminal domain. This interpretation agrees with our structural data, with the detection of T25-TssG C (T25 fused at the N-terminus of the TssG C-terminal domain) interactions with TssF and with TssK, and with a previous study using a comparable experimental setup 26 .",

Rigid-body docking the TssK SN -TssF-TssG structure into the baseplate map shows the architecture of the recombinant complex recapitulates its overall organization in the context of a fully assembled T6SS apparatus. Although the resolution of the baseplate map is limited, we could nevertheless notice local tertiary and quaternary structural differences likely corresponding to conformational switching upon assembly, as reported for the bacteriophage major tail protein 13 . As the TssK region features weak density in the baseplate reconstruction, owing to mobility relative to the rest of the baseplate and/or substoichiometric incorporation of TssK, we applied a low-pass filter at 20 \u00c5 resolution to enhance map resolvability. This procedure confirmed each wedge attaches two TssK trimers to the baseplate (Supplementary Figure 2a-g) , in agreement with the TssK SN -TssF-TssG structure reported here. The apparent conformational heterogeneity of TssK further reinforces the similarity between phage and T6SS baseplates since receptor-binding proteins or TssK trimers are highly dynamic and this could be important for their functions 42 . The central domain of the proximal TssF protomer from each wedge contacts the VgrG oligosaccharide/oligonucleotide (OB)-fold barrel such as the latter domain is surrounded by two TssF protomers from two different wedges. VgrG thereby ensures the transition between its intrinsic threefold symmetry and the sixfold symmetry of the baseplate and needle, similarly to the phage T4 gp27 protein 15, 27, 46 or the Tal protein of phages TP901-1 42 and p2 43 . Lateral stabilization of the baseplate is provided by inter-wedge TssF-TssF, TssK-TssK, and TssF-TssK interactions (Fig. 7a-d) . Most of the inter-wedge TssF-TssF interactions involve contacts between a proximal TssF protomer of the wedge i (through its central and C-terminal domains) and a peripheral TssF protomer of the wedge i + 1 (through its C-terminal domain, Fig. 7d ). Our model also suggests TssK-TssF-TssG complexes are interacting with the proximal TssB-TssC sheath ring, in agreement with previous BACTH studies 23, 26 . On one hand, the (TssF) 2 -(TssG) 1 heterotrimer N-terminal stem contacts TssC. On the other hand, the N-terminal helix of TssC and the Cterminal helix of TssB protrudes in direction of the same (TssF) 2 -(TssG) 1 heterotrimer to interact with the small \u03b2-barrel located within the TssF central domain. The interactions between TssB/ TssC and TssF are mediated by the TssF protomers radiating at the periphery of the baseplate whereas the TssF protomers protruding toward the center of the baseplate bind to VgrG. TssE, which is absent in the model presented here, is expected to interact with the (TssF) 2 -(TssG) 1 heterotrimer N-terminal stem and with the TssB/TssC sheath, based on similarity with the phage T4 baseplate structure 11, 27, 46 .",

As we could not detect baseplate-like complexes upon overexpression and purification of TssK SN -TssF-TssG (even at high concentration), we propose VgrG nucleates the assembly of individual baseplate wedges, as previously suggested 26 Once assembly of the baseplate is completed, the tail tube and sheath polymerize, either sequentially or simultaneously, via addition of hexameric Hcp rings and of TssB-TssC rings or rows at the growing extremity 48 . Stabilization of the TssB-TssC ring directly contacting the baseplate occurs (i) through binding of TssC to the (TssF) 2 -(TssG) 1 N-terminal helical stem, (ii) attachment of the peripheral TssF central domain to the Cand N-termini of TssB and TssC, respectively, and (iii) putatively via interactions of TssE with TssB-TssC.

Moreover, both (TssF) 2 -(TssG) 1 and (gp6) 2 -(gp7) 1 form a three-helix bundle arranged roughly perpendicularly with respect to the triangle motif. This similarity is strengthened by the observation that the (TssF) 2 -(TssG) 1 heterotrimer participate to circularizing the baseplate, recruiting TssK (which is structurally and to some degree functionally related to phage receptor-binding proteins) and interacting with the central spike and the tail sheath, similarly to T4 (gp6) 2 -(gp7) 1 27, 40 . Circularization of the T6SS and the T4 baseplates, however, is mediated by distinct types of interactions, as interwedge contacts occur between C-terminal triangular-shaped cores through proximal and peripheral TssF protomers or between proximal and peripheral gp6 C-terminal domains (which are distinct from the trifurcation domains), respectively.

In panels a, c, TssG is colored identically to Fig. 1 Fig. 7 Model of the T6SS baseplate and needle complex architecture before sheath contraction. a A model was obtained by rigid-body docking subcomplex structures into the single particle cryoEM reconstruction of the non-contractile sheath mutant of the Vibrio Cholerae T6SS baseplate/needle at 8 \u00c5 resolution (EMD 3879) 45 . b Cut-away view of the model shown in a. c Orthogonal view of the model shown in a. d Circularization of the (TssF) 2 -(TssG) 1 complex in the context of the T6SS baseplate. TssK, TssF, TssG are colored identically to Fig. 1 ; TssB-TssC: teal (PDB ID 3j9g) 19 ; Hcp: magenta (PDB 5OJQ); VgrG-PAAR: green-olive (PDB ID 4MTK and 4JIV) 9 Model building and refinement. TssK was modeled based on the available X-ray crystal structures 24 , whereas TssF and TssG were modeled de novo by initially building a backbone trace of their C-terminal domains into a preliminary 4.2 \u00c5 resolution reconstruction. Modeling of TssF and TssG relied on both the global map and the focused map obtained using multi-body refinement. Co-evolution derived constraints provide a way of inferring structural information given large families of evolutionarily related sequences of a protein. By identifying residues that frequently mutate together, structural information may be inferred. The strength of this \"co-evolution\" is strongly predictive of residue-residue contacts in the 3D structure of the protein 31, 32, 36, 60 . For both TssF and TssG, there was sufficient sequence data to perform co-evolution analysis, and models were built using Rosetta guided by this co-evolution data 32 . These models were built by domain (three domains for TssF and two domains for TssG), and the C-terminal domain models were converged and placed into density with the help of the aforementioned backbone trace (a long insertion corresponding to TssG loop 1 allowed discrimination of TssF from TssG density). Several long insertions that poorly converged using the co-evolution information alone were rebuilt into density using RosettaES 37 . Subsequent modeling of the TssG coordinates was carried out using a combination of Coot 38 and Rosetta 34,35 refinement, with the final model refined with Rosetta. The rest of the TssF structure (residues 20-459) was derived from the Rosetta co-evolution model and fit into density before rebuilding and refinement using a combination of Coot 38 and Rosetta 34, 35 . Building and refinement was carried out using the TssK and TssF-TssG focused maps before performing a final refinement round in the TssK-TssF-TssG map. The TssF and TssG atomic models agree with 247 out of 250 and 105 out of 106 co-evolution constraints, respectively. Interaction surface area was calculated using PISA 61 . All figures were generated with UCSF Chimera 62 and UCSF ChimeraX 63 .",

Three microliters of the purified TssK SN -TssF-TssG complex (0.12 mg/ml) in 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.8 and 150 mM NaCl was applied to glow discharged C-flat holey carbon grids covered with a thin layer of carbon. Grids were then plunge-frozen in liquid ethane with an FEI MK4 Vitrobot with a 3 s blot time. The chamber was maintained at 20\u00b0C and 100% humidity during the blotting process. Data were collected with the Leginon data collection software 50 on an FEI Titan Krios electron microscope operated at 300 kV and equipped with an energy filter (slit width of 20 eV), and a direct electron detector Gatan K2 Summit. The dose rate was adjusted to eight counts per pixel per second, and each movie was acquired in super-resolution counting mode fractionated in 50 frames of 200 ms. A total of 2601 micrographs were collected with a defocus range between 0.2 and 4.0 \u03bcm. Particles were automatically selected",
