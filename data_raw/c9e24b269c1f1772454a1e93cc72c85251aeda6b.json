            "text": "The development of an effective vaccine is critical for prevention of a Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) pandemic. Some studies have indicated the receptor-binding domain (RBD) protein of MERS-CoV spike (S) is a good candidate antigen for a MERS-CoV subunit vaccine. However, highly purified proteins are typically not inherently immunogenic. We hypothesised that humoral and cell-mediated immunity would be improved with a modification of the vaccination regimen. Therefore, the immunogenicity of a novel MERS-CoV RBD-based subunit vaccine was tested in mice using different adjuvant formulations and delivery routes. Different vaccination regimens were compared in BALB/c mice immunized 3 times intramuscularly (i.m.) with a vaccine containing 10 mg of recombinant MERS-CoV RBD in combination with either aluminium hydroxide (alum) alone, alum and polyriboinosinic acid (poly I:C) or alum and cysteine-phosphateguanine (CpG) oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN). The immune responses of mice vaccinated with RBD, incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA) and CpG ODN by a subcutaneous (s.c.) route were also investigated. We evaluated the induction of RBDspecific humoral immunity (total IgG and neutralizing antibodies) and cellular immunity (ELISpot assay for IFN-c spotforming cells and splenocyte cytokine production). Our findings indicated that the combination of alum and CpG ODN optimized the development of RBD-specific humoral and cellular immunity following subunit vaccination. Interestingly, robust RBD-specific antibody and T-cell responses were induced in mice immunized with the rRBD protein in combination with IFA and CpG ODN, but low level of neutralizing antibodies were elicited. Our data suggest that murine immunity following subunit vaccination can be tailored using adjuvant combinations and delivery routes. The vaccination regimen used in this study is promising and could improve the protection offered by the MERS-CoV subunit vaccine by eliciting effective humoral and cellular immune responses.",

Recently, researches have focused on adjuvants that signal through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) [14] . Cysteine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs), which activate B cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells via TLR9 and induce both innate and adaptive immunity, are currently being developed as a vaccine adjuvant [15] .

On the other hand, Th2 antibody responses can be induced by the Alum, as indicated by increased IgG1 relative to IgG2a [18, 19] . However, in situations where both Th1 and Th2 responses are required for protection, the choice of one regimen over another might be counter effective.

Both systemic and local cellular immune responses were assessed using lymphocytes from the spleen and lungs of immunised mice. The peptide library used to stimulate the lymphocytes was described in the Materials and Methods section. Results are expressed as the number of SFCs per 10 6 input cells. Adjuvants without rRBD did not elicit a clear cellular response in the spleen 2 weeks after the third immunisation ( Figure 5A ). Neither RBD/A nor RBD/A+P induced a significant cellular immune response. In contrast, RBD/A+C and RBD/I+C regimen enhanced a detectable systemic cellular immune response. Furthermore, the RBD/I+C regimen induced the greatest cellular immune response with the greatest number of IFN-c-producing cells in the spleen (p,0.05). A significant cellular immune response in the lung was induced only by the RBD/I+C regime, although a few IFN-c producing cells were detected in all immunised mice ( Figure 5B ). We therefore concluded that while both the RBD/A+ C and RBD/I+C regimes could induce a systematic cellular immune response in mice, only the RBD/I+C regime could elicit a significant local cellular immune response in the lung.",

But the differences in IFN-c and IL-2 production among the groups were not significant (p$0.05). Compared with other groups, splenocytes from mice immunised with RBD/A+C induced significantly higher levels of TNF-a ( Figure 6C ) and IL-4 ( Figure 6D ) (p,0.01). All these indicated that the adjuvants of alum and CpG combination could induce a Th1 and Th2 mixed immune responses in the rRBD antigen model of MERS-CoV, though the responses revealed a Th1 polarization in the isotype ELISA and ELISpot detection. Similarly, the high levels of IFN-c, IL-2 and IL-6 also indicated a Th1 and Th2 mixed immune responses could be induced by the RBD/I+C regimes. (Figure 6A, 6B, 6E) . Different from all of these, as shown in Figure 6F , the RBD/A+P regimes induce the highest level of IL-10 (p,0.01), which indicated a Th2 response inclination consistent with the results of IgG isotype.

Therefore it was proposed that vaccination with the RBD of MERS-CoV, which belongs to the same betacoronavirus genus as SARS-CoV [27, 28] , might also inhibit MERS-CoV infection and induce a neutralizing antibody response against MERS-CoV. Du et al [8] identified a recombinant protein containing a 212-amino acid fragment (residues 377-588) in the truncated RBD of MERS-CoV spike protein fused with human IgG Fc fragment (S377-588-Fc) was able to induce in the vaccinated mice strong MERS-CoV Sspecific antibodies, which blocks the binding of RBD to dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the human MERS-CoV receptor [29] and effectively neutralizes MERS-CoV infection. Besides, they [9] showed that residues 377 to 662 in the S protein of MERS-CoV induced significant neutralizing antibody responses, suggesting that this region had a potential to be developed as a MERS-CoV vaccine. Mou et al [10] showed the polyclonal antibodies in rabbits against the RBD in the S protein to a 231-amino-acid fragment (residues 358 to 588) efficiently neutralized virus infectivity. However, none of the studies evaluated the immunogenicity of rRBD protein systematically in an animal model. Recently, Ma et al [7] ssuggested the possibility of developing a recombinant RBD protein containing residues 377-662 into an effective and safe mucosal MERS vaccine through the intranasal route in the presence of the only Poly(I:C) adjuvant in a mouse model. While the need for vaccines with the ability to generate an effective immune response has led to the combination of antigens with more than one adjuvant, the 'Adjuvant System' approaches. The Adjuvant System approach aids in the development of vaccines that generate effective immune responses [11, 30] . In this study, the roles of three adjuvants-alum, IFA, CpG and poly (I:C)-in rRBD subunit vaccination were investigated aimed at inducing an effective immune response through use of tailored adjuvant combinations and delivery routes.",

An unexpected result was the absence of neutralizing antibodies in the sera of RBD/I+C immunised mice, despite anti-RBD specific IgG titres being similar for the RBD/I+C and RBD/ A+C regimes. To further understand the riddle, we detected the aantibody avidity of different vaccination regimes by aavidity ELISA. However, the results showed the high antibody avidity correlated with a high IgG titre in mice of RBD/I+C and RBD/ A+C groups. So, we speculated maybe the adjuvants of destroyed the conformation of rRBD and covered the antigen binding sites. Another probable cause of the low titer of neutralizing antibodies in the sera of RBD/I+C immunised mice was the delivery route of subcutaneous. As known, the subcutaneous may be associated with degradation at injection site, which leads to decreased bioavailability [31] . Whatever, further studies are in process.",

As expected, the RBD/A regimes produced a Th2 response with high IgG1/IgG2 ratio. In contrast, mice received the RBD/A+C or RBD/I+C regimes revealed a Th1 skewed response. Consistently, the RBD/A+C or RBD/I+C regimes induced a systematic cellular immune response in mice by ELISpot analysis. The high level of IFN-c and IL-2 in the CBA was also a proof of the cellular immune response in mice.

The results of the present study also support the importance of the Adjuvant System approach, although adjuvant combinations do not always produce the desired response, as seen with RBD/I+C. Consistent with the results of the present study, CpG plus alum was found to induce protective humoral, as well as cellular immunity, in mice immunised with a recombinant haemagglutinin vaccine that protected against influenza virus challenge [32] . The ideal immunity of the CpG and alum combination may be the result of mutual complementation of these two adjuvants. It is well known that alum can promote antibody-mediated protective immunity. However, alum is a poor inducer of cellular immune responses [12] . Recently, adjuvants including oil-in-water emulsions have shown improved efficacy for avian influenza protection suggesting that even for diseases where humoral immunity can confer protection, cellular immune responses may be necessary in vaccine design [33] . The key features of CpG-ODN used as a vaccine adjuvant, include the ability to elicit Th1 cell, but only under certain conditions, CD8+ cytotoxic T cell responses and an additional ability to divert the pre-existing Th2 response in neonates and elderly mice toward a Th1 phenotype [34] .",

To date, rhesus macaques have been reported to generate pneumonia-like symptoms within 24 h of MERS-CoV infection [35] , and we are testing the effects of rRBD immunisation in rhesus macaques. Considerable efforts are being made to establish a small animal model of MERS-CoV infection. Though the lung cells of the Syrian hamster express the receptor for MERS-CoV, they are not susceptible to MERS-CoV infection [35, 36] . Recently, a mouse model of MERS-CoV infection was reportedly generated by transduction of mice with adenoviral vectors expressing DPP4 [24] . In the future, we expect the protective effect of the RBD/A+C vaccination should be investigated in this murine model of MERS-CoV infection. ",
