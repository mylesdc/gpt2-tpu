            "text": "In 2012, an emerging viral infection was identified in Saudi Arabia that subsequently spread to 27 additional countries globally, though cases may have occurred elsewhere. The virus was ultimately named Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and has been endemic in Saudi Arabia since 2012. As of September 2019, 2468 laboratory-confirmed cases with 851 associated deaths have occurred with a case fatality rate of 34.4%, according to the World Health Organization. An imported case of MERS occurred in South Korea in 2015, stimulating a multi-month outbreak. Several distinguishing factors emerge upon epidemiological and sociological analysis of the two outbreaks including public awareness of the MERS outbreak, and transmission and synchronization of governing healthcare bodies. South Korea implemented a stringent healthcare model that protected patients and healthcare workers alike through prevention and high levels of public information. In addition, many details about MERS-CoV virology, transmission, pathological progression, and even the reservoir, remain unknown. This paper aims to delineate the key differences between the two regional outbreaks from both a healthcare and personal perspective including differing hospital practices, information and public knowledge, cultural practices, and reservoirs, among others. Further details about differing emergency outbreak responses, public information, and guidelines put in place to protect hospitals and citizens could improve the outcome of future MERS outbreaks.",

The reasons behind their appearance, and how outbreaks differ are of notable interest to epidemiologists and public health professionals. Coronaviruses in particular have become a global health threat following the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). While human CoVs do circulate causing mild disease year-to-year, SARS-CoV differed in its rapidity and zoonotic origin, in addition to its ability to cause severe disease [1] . SARS-CoV was the first epidemic coronavirus in decades, as well as the first highly pathogenic CoV discovered, when it appeared in Asia in 2002 [2] . This outbreak was swiftly controlled and came to an end within 8 months, in part because of excellent containment policies, limited contact between humans and the putative reservoir host, and efficient use of social media to educate affected populations on containment and protection procedures [3] . However, ten years later, a new related coronavirus emerged in Saudi Arabia in 2012, and despite the success in controlling the SARS epidemic, the new respiratory virus has become an endemic problem in the Middle East. MERS-CoV has since spread to over 27 countries in Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East [4] . The global transmission of MERS-CoV is outlined in Figure 1 . Middle East. MERS-CoV has since spread to over 27 countries in Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East [4] . The global transmission of MERS-CoV is outlined in Figure 1 . In contrast to the short-lived SARS outbreak, MERS has become an endemic disease in many countries around the Middle East sustained by direct reservoir transmission leading to nosocomial infections and eventual transmission back to surrounding communities [3] . Given that MERS-CoVlike viruses have been isolated from masked palm civets, bats, and camels, these are considered some of the many reservoirs of the virus, which sustain transmission in humans and animals [2] . In fact, MERS CoV has been detected in camels dating back several decades, and likely was endemic before it was detected by epidemiologists in 2012, as the majority of infected animals show mild or no symptoms [5] . Infection in dromedaries can result in either asymptomatic or symptomatic disease, while bats carrying SARS-like coronaviruses have historically been asymptomatic [4] . Asymptomatic hosts and reservoirs can spread disease at a rapid rate, as lack of symptoms masks their viral potential. As of September 2019, 2468 laboratory-confirmed cases with 851 associated deaths have occurred with a case fatality rate of 34.4%, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) [6] .",

The viral structure consists of a small enveloped spherical virion, measuring approximately 90-120nm [10, 11] . The MERS-CoV genome encodes two polyproteins (pp1ab and pp1b) and nested subgenomic mRNAs [2, 9] . The genome of the virion is contained within the nucleocapsid, and which is responsible for RNA binding, synthesis, and translation [9] . This is surrounded by the host-derived envelope, containing the four structural proteins, spike (S), nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M), and envelope (E) [12] . The genome also encodes four nonstructural proteins (ns) in ORFs 3, 4a, 4b, and 5, which have vital functions to the virus life cycle [9, 12] . The S protein is of particular interest, as it mediates virus attachment to the host cell through interaction with the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) receptor resulting in viral uptake [8] . In most cases, CoV S proteins are cleaved by furin-like proteases of the host into active subunits [10] . Thus, the MERS-CoV S protein is being investigated for the development of antivirals and therapeutics because of its vital role in infection and pathogenesis [13, 14] .",

            "text": "Attachment of the MERS-CoV virion to the target cell is initiated by the binding of the S1 subunit of the S protein to DPP4, which triggers conformational changes in the S2 subunit, beginning the process of fusion to the target cell [10, 15] . MERS CoV was the only CoV shown to use DPP4 to gain entry to host cells [15] . Like many viruses, CoVs utilize proteases such as transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and cathepsin to activate the S protein following fusion of the viral envelope and host cell membrane [16] . This multi-step process of the S protein at multiple cleavage sites exposes the fusion peptide, stimulating the fusion process inside acidified endosomes [10] . Within the endosome, MERS-CoV disassembles, releasing the inner genomic material into the cytoplasm [15] . Once inside the cell, transcription in the cytoplasm and RNA replication in the cytoplasm proceed. During this time, coronaviruses in general, including MERS-CoV, are readily able to undergo homologous and non-homologous recombination, leading to higher rates of viral evolution and new subtypes [16] . The replication-transcription complex is formed by further protease cleavage of polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab producing nsp1 and nsp16 template genomic RNA, generating the replication complexes required for transcription and translation [17] . Viral structural and accessory proteins are translated from subgenomic co-terminal mRNAs by replication-transcription complex-mediated transcription of a full-length positive genomic RNA [15, 17] . The viral envelope is added to the virion during assembly at the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. During assembly at the Golgi apparatus of the host cell, the S, E, and M proteins are brought together at a \"budding compartment\", where the M protein likely forms the basic structure and final viral complex [10] . The fully assembled, active virion is then exocytosed to the extracellular compartment and budded from the host cell.",

            "text": "Once the patient has begun showing symptoms, diagnosis presents several distinct challenges. The gold standard for diagnosis of an active MERS-CoV infection is by Real Time Polymerase Chain Reactions (RT-PCR), confirming viral identity by using a well-annotated gene such as the nucleocapsid [27] . While whole blood and plasma can also show active infection of MERS-CoV, respiratory samples are typically used for nucleic acid-based tests and utilize RNA extracted from nasopharyngeal swabs, bronchoalveolar lavage, and tracheal aspirates, among others [27] . After active infection, individuals may be examined for seroconversion suggestive of MERS-CoV infection or exposure. Serology tests include Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbant Assay (i.e., ELISA), and whole virus indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) testing [27] . Many of these isolation and identification methods begin with a viral culture grown from a clinical isolate (i.e., sputum or respiratory samples isolated from the patient), elongating the wait time for results. This long wait period makes these current diagnostics laborious and time-consuming, precluding rapid turnaround of results, which is more problematic for severely ill patients and poses further problems for nosocomial transmission. Serology tests can detect antibodies present due to previous infections, but this is less useful to identify an active infection [27, 28] . Patients who have been actively infected with MERS-CoV could be tested again post-infection and documented for seroconversion, which would be helpful for contact tracing as well as future epidemiological tracking and surveillance. PCR detection and serology testing are vital components to outbreak management and epidemiological tracking, by showing infection patterns and identifying potential risk factors, which can be used by health policy makers or for disease tracking during future outbreaks. However, concerns have been raised regarding the lack of standardization of sample collection, analysis, and data availability post-outbreak, which contribute to the previously discussed information gap in MERS epidemiological analyses [29] .",

However, this number varies within the literature, depending on the model utilized. Small samples size can also be a problem in this instance, from lack of documentation or records available.

The animal reservoir for SARS-CoV was suspected to be bats, living in large numbers in the forested area behind rural communities in SARS affected areas [8, 31, 32] . After the initial introduction in Hong Kong, the SARS-CoV outbreak was sustained by human-to-human transmission [28] . While MERS-like viruses have been isolated from bats, MERS-CoV is primarily transmitted by dromedary camels, a commonly farmed and heavily used animal in the Saudi Arabian region, have been suggested to be a reservoir of the virus [3, 9] . However, the primary reservoir remains officially unknown. While dromedary camels can transmit the virus and be asymptomatic carriers, many suggest that it originated in a similar manner to SARS-CoV in the bat population, and has spilled over to many animals, including camels, which are far more difficult to remove from human populations and contact [20, 33] . In fact, less commonly cited animals such as llamas, pigs, horses, and sheep have been found to carry the virus in their nasal passages, and have been suggested to also be capable of being potential reservoirs [33] . This presents further problems for transmission, as many potential reservoirs are in daily contact with Middle Eastern populations.",

Given that this virus is most commonly spread by respiratory droplets from infected individuals, this is not a surprising finding. While the majority of participants in a recent Saudi Arabian study among medical students were aware that infection prevention was ideally through wearing face masks and public information, 53% of participants were unaware of infection control isolation policies in their hospitals, if an outbreak arose [34] . Furthermore, nosocomial transmission is made worse by the presence of MERS-CoV \"superspreaders\", who transmit the disease at a significantly higher rate than the average host [35] . There are a number of factors that can affect the interpretation of a \"superspreader\", such as nearby immunodeficient patients, sharing of healthcare tools and staff, and poor hygiene in the environment. In a recent study, approximately 33.3% of laboratory-confirmed positive hospital patients were found to be superspreaders [35] . Household transmission occurred in 13-21% of cases, making nosocomial transmission and community/reservoir infections the primary targets for prevention [2] .",

The second is lack of publication of data and results from sample analysis of specimens from laboratory-confirmed positive patients on a global scale. The primary source of information regarding pathologies associated with MERS-CoV and disease progression come from medical imaging, which are few and open to interpretation.

DPP4 is plentiful in the respiratory tract of humans including the bronchial mucosa, but is also expressed in a variety of tissues such as bronchial epithelial cells and kidney cells [36] . This is why renal impairment is a common physiological symptom of infection in addition to lung pathologies [6, 37] . However, comorbidities are extremely common in severe cases of MERS-CoV, and documentation of timing of occurrences in the literature is unclear. Therefore, more work in this area is needed before extra-pulmonary symptoms are definitively linked to severe MERS-CoV. Several studies have also shown downregulation causes severe lung pathologies in CoV models of infection, and impairment in cardiovascular health in general [38, 39] . Further, progression to ARDS and subsequent cytokine expansion, including IL-8 and 6, CXCL10, and CCL2, and complications such as pulmonary fibrosis, neovascularization, and congestive heart failure due to bilateral pulmonary infiltrates have been noted for infections [2, 40] . Lack of availability of samples and tests as previously described has led to a serious lack of information surrounding MERS-CoV pathogenesis, which is crucial to improving healthcare practices during an outbreak. This gap in information due to differences in testing, sample collection, and lack of standardization of collection between countries further contributes to the problem [29] .",

This included where to seek medical attention and protective measures individuals could take to protect themselves from infection, such as face masks. In the case of MERS, there is a belief that lack of knowledge among medical staff and affected communities could be a risk factor for disease containment [34] . With a combination of hospital and community outbreaks, many have suggested that stronger implementation of proper decontamination procedures could reduce outbreak severity and length [8, 42] .

In Saudi Arabia, poor access to healthcare professionals at a hospital and General Practitioner level can result in delays between disease development and progression, and diagnosis or quarantine in a hospital facility [52, 53] . As the Saudi Arabian outbreak continued, many individuals who relied on camels for daily living or livelihood denied the correlation between camels and MERS-CoV infections, kicking off the Kiss Your Camel campaign, which became increasingly popular in Social Media in 2015 [54] . The contribution of this to the outbreak remains unclear, but it is a prime example of the negative general reaction to the outbreak. Because of the structure of the Saudi Arabian healthcare system and lack of preparedness for an infectious disease outbreak, panic quickly followed the announcement of the outbreak, leading to the dismissal of the Saudi Arabian Health Minister, Abdullah al-Rabeeah [55] . Confusion about the outbreak and lack of coordination and organization by hospitals and healthcare centers led to loss of control and lack of public information, which further exacerbated the outbreak.",

This is due to better universal health coverage, and flexibility to choose health care professionals compared to Saudi Arabia, where the government has more restrictions and involvement in healthcare decisions [56, 57] . From the beginning of the outbreak, South Korean patients who were MERS-positive sought and embraced medical attention much faster than did Saudi Arabian patients [58] .

The first was the open relationship between healthcare professionals and patients seen in South Korea. Patients felt more comfortable with their healthcare workers, and were more willing to go to the hospital or clinic if they felt unwell. In addition, unlike the South Korean index patient, the majority of infected individuals were truthful about their travel, and if they had been to a MERS-affected area. This allowed professionals to be involved in the isolation and treatment process much sooner than in the Saudi Arabian outbreak.",

These individuals were better equipped to deal with potential cases of MERS entering the hospital environment, thus avoiding potential nosocomial spread. In the case of the start of the Saudi Arabian outbreak, some medical professionals were unaware of how to isolate and manage patients, lacking basic knowledge of transmission and viral spread, enabling the virus to travel further and faster than if the patient was isolated and protective equipment were worn by staff and visitors from the onset of treatment.",
