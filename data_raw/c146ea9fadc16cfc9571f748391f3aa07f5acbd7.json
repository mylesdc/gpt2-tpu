            "text": "Houttuynia cordata is an important traditional Chinese herb with unresolved genetics and taxonomy, which lead to potential problems in the conservation and utilization of the resource. Inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers were used to assess the level and distribution of genetic diversity in 226 individuals from 15 populations of H. cordata in China. ISSR analysis revealed low genetic variations within populations but high genetic differentiations among populations. This genetic structure probably mainly reflects the historical association among populations. Genetic cluster analysis showed that the basal clade is composed of populations from Southwest China, and the other populations have continuous and eastward distributions. The structure of genetic diversity in H. cordata demonstrated that this species might have survived in Southwest China during the glacial age, and subsequently experienced an eastern postglacial expansion. Based on the results of genetic analysis, it was proposed that as many as possible targeted populations for conservation be included.",

H. cordata Thunb is the only species in the genus Houttuynia [2, 3] . This herb propagates by formation and separation of underground stems and by parthenogenesis [4, 5] , although sexual reproduction has not yet been determined. It is distributed mainly in the central, southeastern and southwestern regions of China, and extends to Japan, Korea and Southeast Asia, where it grows in moist, shady places. H. cordata is used as a traditional Chinese medical herb. It plays a unique role in improving the immune system of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [6] , and the steam distillate from fresh plants inhibits herpes simplex virus type 1, influenza virus and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 without cytotoxicity [7] . H. cordata is also consumed as a vegetable in China for its special aroma. Although H. cordata is of high medicinal and economic value, wild H. cordata population resources are limited, which is a main hurdle for the breeding of new cultivated varieties. Therefore, it is critical to arrest this dearth of information on this important natural resource and study the genetic diversity of the remaining population.",

In this paper, we analyze the genetic structure of H. cordata based on ISSRs using a large number of individuals sampled from wide areas including central, southeastern and southwestern China. The purposes of this study are to address the following questions. What is the level of genetic diversity and the degree of differentiation among populations in H. cordata from its main range? What does the genetic structure imply for the evolutionary history? How can the species be conserved and used effectively based on the revealed genetic information?",

This finding was consistent with the type of genetic structure predicted by the Shannon's diversity index analysis, which suggested that 67.42% of the total variation was partitioned among populations. Table 2 shows an estimate of Nei's genetic identities (G I ) and genetic distance (G D ) for each pairwise comparison between two populations. Genetic identities between populations varied from 0.6936 to 0.9184 with a mean of 0.7764 \u00b1 0.0437. Correlative analysis with SAS software showed that there was no significant correlation either between genetic differentiation and latitude (p = 0.9408), or between genetic differentiation and longitude (p = 0.3368). The AMOVA indicated that most (77%) of the molecular variation in H. cordata populations existed among populations, with lesser amounts within populations (23%). Permutation tests (based on 999 permutations) suggest that the overall \u0424PT was significantly different from the null distribution (\u0424PT = 0.769, p = 0.010) ( Table 3) , which indicates the differences among populations are significant.

In this study, the genetic structure of H. cordata was generally characterized by high genetic variation at species level (Shannon indices of 0.4338 and Nei's gene diversity of 0.2820) and low genetic variation within population (0.1413 and 0.0923 on average, respectively). These results were similar to those obtained using other molecular markers (such as RAPD and SSR) previously in a much smaller sample size [16] . This herb survived and adapted as a result of agamic reproduction in the central and southern areas of the Northern Hemisphere during late tertiary to early quaternary [1] . At the glacial maxima, H. cordata was restricted to refugia with an endurable temperature, and such areas were expected to be small. One of the major genetic consequences of long-term habitation at a small population size is high levels of genetic drift [17, 18] . This factor could be, at least partially, responsible for the low genetic variation within population and high genetic variation among populations.",

In the present study, 15 sampled populations were collected from 13 provinces in China. Latitude and longitude of the areas vary from 21\u00b012' (N) to 34\u00b036' (N) and from 101\u00b031' (E) to 119\u00b036' (E), respectively. Different geographical distribution ranges, the intricate landform and the weather conditions of the sampled populations might have limited migration. In this study, the coefficient of genetic differentiation (G ST ) of the species was 0.6728, the proportion of diversity among populations based on the Shannon indices was similarly high (67.42%); correspondingly, the estimate of gene flow (Nm) is low (0.2431); and the AMOVA test also showed that there was high genetic diversity among populations (77%) and low genetic diversity within the population (23%). H. cordata is a relic of its agamic race [1] , and the plant is small and short. This constrains gene flow via seed and pollen dispersal, and thus the plant fails to reproduce extraneously in each highly isolated population. Cytological examinations revealed that H. cordata is a polyploidy complex with 36 to 126 chromosomes [19] , which hinders gene exchanges among populations harboring different numbers of chromosomes. Therefore, these patterns of variation are due not to ongoing gene flow, but rather to historical association among populations. According to the geographical distribution and the affinities shown in the UPGMA dendrogram (Figure 1 ), H. cordata might have survived in Southwest China during the last Pleistocene glaciation. The route extended southeastward of Southwest China along the Yungui Plateau Range, where the present distribution pattern appeared. The strong differentiation among populations may be mainly due to subsequent genetic drift and natural selection. Genetic drift changes the distribution of genetic variation either by reducing variation within a population or by increasing the differentiation among populations [18] . Although the UPGMA dendrogram ( Figure 1 ) indicated that the distribution of H. cordata in China took on an overall pattern of eastward expansion, the lack of significant correlation between genetic distance and geographical distance supports the hypothesis of historical relationships and the subsequent action of genetic drift accounts for current-day patterns of variation.",

The low levels of genetic diversity within a population and the low gene flow among populations point towards the possibility of the possession of unique genotypes in a single population that are not found in other populations. It is therefore imperative for conservation planners, when designing conservation strategies for wild populations of H. cordata in China, to ensure that as many as possible separate populations are targeted for conservation rather than a few selected populations. Ex situ conservation may also be appropriate, because the total genetic diversity in a population of H. cordata may be adequately captured in only a few plants from the wild, which would not be the case for species with high levels of genetic diversity within a population. It would be beneficial to find ways to strengthen the gene flow between populations to maintain the natural genetic variation of H. cordata. Considering the high genetic differentiation among the wild populations, preservation of only a few populations may not adequately protect the genetic variation within the species in central China. Therefore, several populations throughout the entire range of the species in the country should be considered for conservation.",

To examine population genetic structure, the proportion of genetic divergence was estimated within and among populations as described by Nei [27] , and G ST was designated as the coefficient of gene differentiation among populations. The genetic identity (G I ) and the genetic distance (G D ) among populations were also computed using the model presented by Nei [17] . Gene flow estimates (Nm) were calculated as Nm = (1 \u2212 G ST )/4G ST [29] . Differentiation among population was analyzed with an analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) using Genalex 6.1 based on 999 permutations. The AMOVA procedure in Genalex follows the methods of Excoffier et al. 1992 , which estimates and partitions total molecular variance within and between populations and then tests the significance of partitioned variance components using permutational testing procedures.
