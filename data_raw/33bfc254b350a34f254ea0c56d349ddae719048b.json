The presence of microorganisms is sensed by pathogen recognition receptors (such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs)) of the innate immune defenses. Innate responses are essential for subsequent induction of potent adaptive immune responses, but little information is available about innate antiviral responses of the chicken trachea. We hypothesized that TLR ligands induce innate antiviral responses in the chicken trachea. Tracheal organ cultures (TOC) were used to investigate localized innate responses to TLR ligands. Expression of candidate genes, which play a role in antiviral responses, was quantified. To confirm the antiviral responses of stimulated TOC, chicken macrophages were treated with supernatants from stimulated TOC, prior to infection with AIV. The results demonstrated that TLR ligands induced the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, type I interferons and interferon stimulated genes in the chicken trachea. In conclusion, TLR ligands induce functional antiviral responses in the chicken trachea, which may act against some pathogens, such as AIV.",

Innate responses provide the first line of defense against influenza virus at mucosal surfaces aiming to block the entry of the virus and viral replication. However, when the virus passes the preliminary barriers, the airway epithelial cells are the primary target for the virus. Pathogenicity of AIV in chickens is initiated by the same phenomenon as mentioned above, by infecting the tracheal cells by influenza virus [2, 3] . In chickens, despite the absence of essential lymphoid tissues or mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues in the trachea, the trachea is able to mount immune responses against different pathogens [4] [5] [6] [7] . Chemoattractants produced by the trachea recruit other cells of the immune system, such as macrophages and lymphocytes, toward the trachea to limit spread of the virus [4] [5] [6] 8] . Airway epithelial cells are of prime importance in host responses against AIV. AIV replicates in epithelial cells, and these infected epithelial cells then transport viral antigens to antigen presenting cells [9, 10] .",

Chicken tracheal epithelium contains three types of cells (ciliated cells, goblet cells and basal cells) which express both SA\u03b12-6Gal and SA\u03b12-3Gal linkages [12] . However, distribution and expression of these receptors vary among different types of chicken tracheal cells [12, 13] .

There are some differences between mammalian species and chickens in the way they sense presence of the virus via PRRs. In vertebrate species, three types of PRRs engage to recognize influenza virus: Toll-like receptors (TLRs), nucleotide oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors (NLRs) and retinoic acid-inducible gene-1 (RIG-1)-like receptors (RLRs) [14] [15] [16] . In mammals, TLR3 plays a key role in recognition of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) once the virus replicates in host cells [14, 17] . While the NLR and the RLR families recognize the presence of the virus in the cytosol of infected cells, TLR7 senses the presence of viral RNA in the endosome of host cells, such as plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) [18] . Like mammalian species, several PRRs including TLRs and RLRs have been recognized in chickens. In chickens, the expression of TLRs in trachea is up-regulated following AIV infection [19] . Despite the lack of RIG-1 in chickens to sense AIV infection, AIV is sensed intracellularly by chicken melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (chMDA5), which results in the expression of type I interferons (IFNs). ChMDA5 and downstream mediators of cell signaling, such as mitochondrial adaptor molecule CARDIF and chicken interferon regulatory factor 7 (chIRF7) are necessary to induce antiviral responses [20, 21] .",

In chickens, type I IFNs including chIFN-\u03b1 and chIFN-\u03b2 induce the expression of ISGs, such as protein kinase R (PKR) and the 2 1 -5 1 oligoadenylate synthetase (2 1 ,5 1 -OAS) [23] .

These studies have demonstrated that TLR ligands induce the expression of TLRs and antiviral responses and the production of cytokines and chemokines. TLR2, 4, and 21 ligands have been employed in vitro to treat chicken macrophages prior to AIV infection and resulting in the reduction of AIV replication in chicken macrophages [31] . The same panel of TLR ligands and the ligand for TLR7 have also been administrated in vivo in chickens to induce antiviral responses and resulting in the reduction of AIV shedding in infected chickens. These TLR ligands reduced oral and cloacal viral shedding in infected chickens. TLR21 ligand CpG ODN 1826 is the most efficacious TLR ligand to reduce oral viral shedding, while TLR4 ligand lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Escherichia coli (E.coli) 026:B6 causes the highest reduction in cloacal viral shedding [29] . However, there is little information about induced antiviral responses in the chicken respiratory system following treatment with TLR ligands and the underlying mechanisms which are involved in the induction of antiviral responses. The purpose of this study was to determine first whether the chicken trachea responds to TLR ligands, and second whether these responses induced by TLR ligands are capable to limit AIV replication. In this study, we profiled antiviral responses in the chicken trachea following stimulation of tracheal organ culture (TOC) with TLR ligands. We also confirmed that soluble factors, secreted by chicken tracheal cells stimulated with TLR ligands, had antiviral activity against AIV.",

High dose of LPS significantly induced the up-regulation of TLR3 at 8 h post-treatment. Low dose of Pam3CSK4 and CpG ODN significantly induced the expression of TLR3 at 18 h post-treatment ( Figure 2B , Table 1 ). The expression of TLR4 by TOCs treated with either Pam3CSK4 or LPS was significantly down-regulated, however, its expression was significantly increased by high dose of CpG ODN at 18 h post-treatment ( Figure 2C , Table 1 ).

In addition, the high dose of LPS significantly induced the up-regulation of PKR at 3 h post-treatment ( Figure 1H , Table 1 Table 1 ).

Gene expression is presented as fold change relative to the non CpG ODN group in CpG (low and high doses) groups. Error bars represent standard errors of the means. Fold changes and standard errors were calculated using REST software. Significant up-regulation (p \u010f 0.05) is indicated by *. Significant down-regulation is indicated by \u03b6.

We showed that supernatants from TOC treated with TLR2, 4 and 21 ligands activated chicken macrophages as indicated by NO production in macrophages.

            "text": "Antiviral responses are necessary to suppress viral replication and virus spread within the host. TLR ligands including LPS, Pam3CSK4 and CpG ODN induce antiviral responses in chickens against AIV which leads to reduction of viral shedding in infected chickens [29] . In the current study, the induction of antiviral responses following TLR ligand treatment was demonstrated by induced expression of IRF7 and ISGs in TOCs and the reduction of AIV replication in chicken macrophages treated with TOC supernatants. Engagement of TLRs with their ligands results in triggering several intracellular pathways leading to the expression of cytokines and other antiviral mechanisms. This process is mediated by transcription factors, such as IRF7 [39] . In agreement with previous studies [30, 31] , all three TLR ligands tested in this study induced the expression of IRF7, an important transcription factor in TLR signaling pathways and downstream responses [40] . In the present study, all three TLR ligands induced the expression of type I IFNs in TOCs. The critical role of type I IFNs in innate responses against influenza virus has been well documented in mammalian species and chickens. In humans, it has been demonstrated that the lack of IFN-\u03b2 induction results in impaired responses against influenza virus [41, 42] . In addition, the importance of type I IFNs in the induction of ISGs, which play a critical role in antiviral responses against influenza virus, has been well established [18, 23, 24, [43] [44] [45] . However, we observed that TLR ligands induced the early expression of OAS, viperin and PKR in TOCs even prior to the induction of type I IFNs. Significant up-regulation of OAS, viperin and PKR prior to the expression of type I IFNs in TOCs may support IFN-independent activation of these ISGs, an observation that has been previously reported in humans and mice [46, 47] . Moreover, we determined the expression of IFITM5 in TOCs following CpG ODN and Pam3CSK4 treatment. Members of the IFITM family, which are also classified as ISGs, have primary antiviral functions in host cells. IFITM proteins prevent the fusion of influenza virus to cell membrane and therefore inhibit the entry of influenza virus into host cells [25, 26, 48] .",

The function of TLR3 and its importance in the induction of antiviral responses against influenza virus in mammals and chickens have been previously emphasized [17, 51] .",

Subsequent to treatment of chicken macrophages with supernatants of TOCs treated with TLR ligands, AIV replication was significantly reduced in macrophages. This antiviral activity suggested that supernatants from TOCs may contain IFNs and ISGs or other active antiviral components. Importantly, our findings underlined the differences among TLR ligands for induction of ISGs in TOCs, which may correlate with their ability to reduce viral replication. For example, the inability of LPS to induce significant expression of IFITM5 and TLR3 in TOCs may explain the limited reduction of AIV replication in chicken macrophages following treatment with SupTOC-LPS compared to supernatants from TOCs treated with Pam3CSK4 or CpG.",

SupTOC-Pam3CSK4-24h, SupTOC-LPS-48h and SupTOC-CpG-48h significantly reduced AIV replication in chicken macrophages. The difference in the effects of incubation time between TOCs treated with different TLR ligands might be correlated with the nature and quantity of the antiviral compounds produced by TOCs during the incubation. This interpretation is supported by a previous study which showed that LPS and Pam3CSK4 induced varying profiles of genes involved in the regulation of type I IFNs [52] . The activation and regulation of type I IFN signaling pathway could affect trachea responses which was reflected in TOC supernatants with different incubation time. Along with regulatory mechanisms of type I IFN signaling pathways, the kinetics and the amount of IFN produced by host cells depend on the type and the complexity of TLR ligands [53] . The delineated differences of TOC capability to induce antiviral responses is of importance and further studies are required to detect and quantify components in TOC supernatants.",

In addition, the expression of viperin by TOCs that received low dose of Pam3CSK4 was significantly increased at 3 h post-treatment. Low dose of LPS significantly induced the up-regulation of viperin at 8 h post-treatment. However, high dose of Pam3CSK4 down-regulated the expression of viperin at 8 h post-treatment (Figure 1I, Table 1). High and low dose of CpG ODN significantly induced the expression of TLR2 at 8 h post-treatment. High dose of LPS significantly induced the expression of TLR2 at 18 h post-treatment, however, the high dose of LPS significantly down-regulated the expression of TLR2, at 3 h post-treatment (Figure 2A, Table 1). High dose of LPS significantly induced the up-regulation of TLR3 at 8 h post-treatment. Low dose of Pam3CSK4 and CpG ODN significantly induced the expression of TLR3 at 18 h post-treatment (Figure 2B,",
