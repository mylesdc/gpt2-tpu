Variability is uneven across the genome because mutations resulting in a deleterious effect on viral fitness are restricted. RNA viruses are thus marked by protein sites permissive to multiple mutations and sites critical to viral structure-function that are evolutionarily robust and highly conserved. Identification and characterization of the historical dynamics of the conserved sites have relevance to multiple applications, including potential targets for diagnosis, and prophylactic and therapeutic purposes.",

DENV protein sequence data were collected from the NCBI Entrez protein database in 2005 (9,512 sequences) and again in 2007 (12,404 sequences). Forty-four (44) sequences (pan-DENV sequences), mainly those of nonstructural proteins and representing ,15% of the DENV polyprotein length, were identical in 80% or more of all recorded DENV sequences. Of these 44 sequences, 34 (,77%) were present in $95% of sequences of each DENV type, and 27 (,61%) were conserved in other Flaviviruses. The frequencies of variants of the pan-DENV sequences were low (0 to ,5%), as compared to variant frequencies of ,60 to ,85% in the non pan-DENV sequence regions. We further showed that the majority of the conserved sequences were immunologically relevant: 34 contained numerous predicted human leukocyte antigen (HLA) supertype-restricted peptide sequences, and 26 contained T-cell determinants identified by studies with HLA-transgenic mice and/or reported to be immunogenic in humans.",

The conservation of these sequences through the entire recorded DENV genetic history supports their possible value for diagnosis, prophylactic and/or therapeutic applications.

DENVs are enveloped, single-stranded RNA (+) viruses coding for a polyprotein precursor of approximately 3,400 amino acids, which is cleaved into three structural (capsid, C; precursor membrane and membrane, prM/M; envelope, E) and seven nonstructural proteins (NS1, 2a, 2b, 3, 4a, 4b and 5). Viral replication occurs in the cytoplasm in association with virusinduced membrane structures and involves the NS proteins. There are 4 genetically distinct DENV types, referred to as DENV-1 to -4, with multiple genotypic variants [1, 2] . DENVs are transmitted to humans primarily by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes and cause a wide range of symptoms from an unapparent or mild dengue fever (DF) to severe dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF)/dengue shock syndrome (DSS) that may be fatal. It is estimated that more than 100 million people are infected each year, with up to several hundred thousand DHF/DSS cases [3] . To date, there is no licensed prophylactic vaccine and no specific therapeutic formulation available.",

            "text": "Adaptive immune responses include cellular responses to short peptides derived from self and foreign proteins by proteolysis. The peptides are presented to T-cell receptors (TCRs) by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules, referred to as human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules in humans. HLA class I and class II molecules bind and present peptides to CD8 and CD4 T-cells, respectively, that play a critical role in antigen (Ag)specific cytotoxic responses and the induction and maintenance of Ag-specific memory responses [4] [5] [6] . Peptides that are recognized by the T cells and trigger an immune response are referred to as T-cell determinants. One problem in developing a tetravalent DENV vaccine is the viral diversity [7] , with rather low intra-type, but high inter-type variability, resulting in type-specific and type cross-reactive T-cell determinants [8] . This variability of related structures gives rise to a large number of variant peptide sequences with one or more amino acid differences that may function as alternative determinants, or altered peptide ligands [9] , and affect anti-DENV host immunity [10, 11] . There is abundant evidence that interactions of memory T cells with peptide ligands bearing amino acid substitutions at TCR contact residues may alter T-cell activation and effector function [9, [12] [13] [14] [15] . Even a single amino acid substitution can impair the function of T cells in a variety of ways, producing profoundly different phenotypes that range from modified stimulatory function to complete inhibition [14] . These findings suggest that infection or immunization with multiple DENV types, as is the case with some tetravalent vaccines, may lead to T-cell responses to variant peptides that might be deleterious. There is also the possibility that the altered-ligand phenomenon and cross-reactive T-cell responses, referred to as original antigenic sin, may play a role in DHF/DSS [7, 11, 16, 17] . Although the etiology of DHF and DSS is only partially understood, this consideration may have profound implications for the safety and efficiency of candidate vaccines.",

The 4 intra-type consensus sequences for a given protein (one from each type) were then aligned to reveal sequence fragments identical across each of the types that were at least 9 amino acids long. This minimum length was chosen because it represents the binding core length of a majority of HLArestricted T-cell determinants [26] . Only sequence fragments that were identical in at least 80% of the sequences of each of the 4 types were retained for further analyses. Peptides with residue X in the alignment were ignored from the percentage representation (i.e. frequency) computation. The 80% intra-type representation cut-off was chosen because 44 of the 46 sequence fragments that were common across the 4 DENV types exhibited intra-type representation of $81%, and those two that did not had significantly lower representation (,56-67%) in one of the 4 types.",

The identification and characterization of the historical dynamics of these sites in DENV have relevance to several applications such as diagnosis and drug and vaccine development. In this study, we have identified sequence fragments that were conserved across the majority of available DENV sequences, analyzed their historical dynamics, and evaluated their relevance as candidate vaccine targets, using various bioinformatics-based methods and immune assay in human leukocyte antigen (HLA) transgenic mice. This approach provides a framework for large-scale and systematic analysis of other human pathogens. diversity) and across all DENVs (pan-DENV diversity) and to assess the predicted evolutionary stability of the identified pan-DENV sequences.

The entropy value increases with n(x), the total number of peptides observed at position x; it is also sensitive to the relative frequency of the peptides; such that it decreases when one peptide is clearly dominant (i.e. the position is conserved). Only sequences that contain a valid amino acid at position x were used for the entropy computation, and the alignment gaps were ignored. Although gaps tend to occur in highdiversity regions, proteins that have a high fraction of gaps have reduced statistical support, yielding an artificially low entropy value; for this reason, positions where more than 50% of sequences contained a gap were discarded. Because of the statistical nature of the entropy measure, both complete protein and shorter fragment sequences were used in this computation. The first and last 4 positions in the alignment of each protein were not assigned any peptide entropy value as they cannot be the center of a nonamer. In theory, nonamer entropy values can range from 0, for a completely conserved nonamer peptide in all sequences analyzed, to 39 (log 2 20 9 ); in practice, however, the upper bound is very much lower for alignments of closely related sequences. For finite-size sets of sequences, entropy computations are affected by the sequence count in the alignment. For an alignment of N sequences, alignment size bias is proportional to 1/N [29] . This relationship allows a correction for size bias by applying to each alignment a statistical adjustment that estimates entropy values for an infinitely-sized alignment with analogous peptide distribution. To obtain such an estimate, the alignment was repeatedly randomly sampled to create smaller alignments of varying size, whose entropy was measured. At each alignment position, the entropy of these subset alignments of size N was plotted against 1/N, using a linear regression to extrapolate the entropy estimate for NR'. The regression's coefficient of determination (r 2 ) was used as a goodness-of-fit of the resulting estimate. In this study, size bias correction was applied to all entropy calculations, so that alignment sequence counts could be ignored in comparisons.",

The algorithm integrates the predictions of HLA binding, proteasomal C-terminal cleavage and transport efficiency by the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) molecules. HLA binding and proteasomal cleavage predictions are performed by an artificial neural networks (ANN) method, while TAP transport efficiency is predicted using a weight matrix method. The parameters used for NetCTL prediction were: 0.15 weight on C terminal cleavage (default), 0.05 weight on TAP transport efficiency (default), and 0.5 threshold for HLA supertype binding, which was reported to be optimal (sensitivity (SN), 0.89 and specificity (SP), 0.94) in a large benchmark study containing more than 800 known class I T-cell determinants [35] .",

Although to some extent this redundancy may be accepted as a reflection of the incidence of the corresponding DENV isolates in nature, we assessed its potential bias effect by repeating the analysis of conservation after discarding duplicate sequences from the datasets. The analysis of unique sequences identified all the pan-DENV sequences that were identified when including duplicates (Figure 2) , except for NS1 [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] , NS1 [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] and NS5 597-616 . Therefore, the presence of duplicates in the DENV datasets did not significantly affect the results. Although the removal of duplicates does not fully compensate for biases in the datasets, the removal of highly similar sequences, which may have been generated from relatively large sequencing efforts in single outbreaks, was deemed undesirable, since such arbitrary selection would introduce additional biases.",

The entropy of the proteome of the recorded viruses of each type showed numerous long regions of low entropy (#1), reflecting the relatively high degree of intra-type sequence conservation, in particular in the NS3, NS4b and NS5 proteins ( Figure 3A-D) . Overall, the average intra-type nonamer entropy values of the individual protein sequences of DENV-1, -2, -3 and -4 ranged from 0.2 for the DENV-4 NS4b to 1.0 for DENV-2 prM ( Figure S1 ). Of note, however, were the marked differences in the relative degree of entropy of each protein between the 4 DENV types. For example, NS4b had the least diversity of the proteins of 3 types, but was replaced in DENV-2 by NS2b, which was the second most variable in DENV-3. The consequence of the differences in the sequences of each protein between the 4 types was a marked increase in the peptide entropy across the DENV 1-4 proteomes ( Figure 3E) , with average peptide entropy ranging from 1.6 for NS3 to 2.6 for NS2a ( Figure S1 ), except for 44 sharply defined regions of low nonamer entropy (#0.5) where the sequences were highly conserved in all DENVs ( Figure 3E) , with no significant difference between the 2005 and 2007 datasets ( Table S2) .",

When representations of variants across all DENVs were calculated, the majority of all nonamer sites contained variants that together represented ,60-85% of the total DENV sequences at that site (the highest representation of ,85% was in the NS1 protein) ( Figure 4E ). This was in striking contrast to the 0 to ,5% combined representation of variants at each nonamer position in the pan-DENV sequences, with no significant difference between the 2005 and 2007 datasets ( Table  S2 ). The majority of all nonamer sites in the pan-DENV sequences lacked variant or contained variants that together represented ,1% of all recorded DENVs. These data further illustrate the extremely high genetic stability of the 44 pan-DENV sequences, among all recorded DENV sequences and demonstrate that irrespective of the high variability between the sequences of the 4 DENV types, the representation of variants in the pan-DENV sequences was almost negligible.",

Mice were immunized with pools of overlapping peptides covering the sequences of the E, NS1, NS3, and NS5 proteins of DENV-3, and HLA-DR-restricted CD4 T-cell responses were assessed by IFN-c ELISpot assays using CD8depleted splenocytes. Thirty peptides eliciting positive T-cell responses in the HLA Tg mice contained 9 or more consecutive amino acids of 22 pan-DENV sequences, that were localized in the NS5 (11), NS3 (6), NS1 (4), and E proteins (one) ( Table 5) . Overall, 9, 10 and 18 peptides elicited positive responses in HLA-DR2, -DR3, and/or -DR4 Tg mice, respectively; 20 corresponded to sequences of NS5, 10 of NS3, 6 of NS1, and one of E.

A majority (26/44) contained at least 9 amino acids overlapping with a total of 45 peptides that have been reported to be immunogenic in humans and/or HLA-DR Tg mice. In addition, putative T-cell determinants for 12 major HLA class I supertypes and for class II DR supertype, with broad application to the immune responses of human population worldwide, were predicted by computational analysis. Some of the putative T-cell determinants were predicted to be promiscuous to multiple HLA supertypes, in addition to multiple alleles of a given HLA supertype. Such a degree of promiscuity has previously been observed for DENV [62] and HIV peptides [63] , among others. The existence of conserved T-cell determinants specific for multiple HLA supertypes further supports their evaluation as vaccine targets, since they would provide broader population coverage [63] . Many of the predicted HLA binding nonamers were localized in clusters, as we have also observed in HLA Tg mice immunized with WNV proteins and DNA encoding the SARS coronavirus N protein [64] , and has been reported in studies of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 proteins [65] [66] [67] [68] , the outer membrane protein of Chlamydia trachomatis [69] , and other antigens [64] .",

            "text": "The significant sequence variations between the proteins of the 4 DENV types represent a cardinal issue for the development of a tetravalent DENV vaccine that provides robust protection against each DENV type. Subtle amino acid substitutions within T-cell determinants restricted by a given HLA allomorph, such as in the event of sequential heterologous infections, or between a vaccine formulation and a subsequent natural infection [7] , can dramatically alter the phenotype of the specific T cells, resulting in a wide range of effects from agonism to antagonism [9, [12] [13] [14] [15] . Because of the extent of intra-type (1 to 21%) and inter-type (14 to 67%) amino acid variability among DENV isolates [48] , many nonamer T-cell determinants contain single or multiple amino acid difference(s). When the 4 DENV types were analyzed together, a majority of the nonamer positions across the full proteome exhibited variants that together were present in ,60 to ,85% of all sequences. The frequencies of variant peptides across the 4 DENV types suggest that vaccine strategies incorporating whole DENV immunogens, such as inactivated and recombinant subunit vaccines, live attenuated viruses, or chimeric viruses expressing structural DENV genes, are likely to elicit T-cell responses to altered peptide ligands. This phenomenon is also likely to occur in individuals exposed to several Flaviviruses, such as DENV, JEV and YFV that are co-circulating in regions of Asia, India or South America, or following vaccination [70] .",

The incorporation of defined HLA-restricted T-cell determinants within DENV vaccine candidates might improve vaccine efficiency by increasing T-cell help to sustain a robust, long-lived Conserved Sequences of Dengue Viruses www.plosntds.org immunity, and possibly through direct cytostatic and cytotoxic effects on infected cells. For tetravalent formulations, it may be relevant to focus primarily on sequences that are conserved in all 4 DENV types and to avoid the regions of T-cell immunity that are highly variable, unless they are strictly type-specific [17, 72] . The two pan-DENV E sequences (positions 97-111 and 252-261) and the exposed domain III of the E antigen (positions 300-400) [73, 74] , are also candidate sequences for neutralizing antibody responses. An additional criterion for the selection of T-cell targets is the need for determinants with broad HLA representation, as it has been emphasized in the recognition of HLA supertypes [18] [19] [20] . Further investigations are needed to validate the immunogenicity of the candidate T-cell determinants in human subjects, and to identify sequences associated with deleterious T-cell responses.",
