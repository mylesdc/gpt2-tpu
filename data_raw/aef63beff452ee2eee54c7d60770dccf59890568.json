The pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus is a recently described, rapidly contagious respiratory pathogen which can cause acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and poses a major public health threat. In this study, we found that TSL-1 inhibited viral yields on MDCK plaque formation by pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus on infected A549 cells with high selectivity index. Meanwhile, TSL-1 also suppressed viral genome loads in infected A549 cells, quantified by qRT-PCR. This study further demonstrated that TSL-1 inhibited pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus activity through preventing attachment of A549 cells but not penetration. TSL-1 inhibited viral attachment through significant downregulation of adhesion molecules and chemokines (VCAM-1, ICAM-1, E-selectin, IL-8, and fractalkine) compared to Amantadine. Our results suggest that TSL-1 may be used as an alternative treatment and prophylaxis against pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus.",

According to WHO statistics, this pandemic virus has killed more than 18,000 people around the world since 2009 [2] . In the past few years, there has been a worldwide effort to virus isolation, whole genome sequencing, and hemagglutination inhibition assay to confirm influenza A viruses, which has led to the depositing of more than 46,000 sequences in the Influenza Virus Resource of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Genomic analysis of the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) virus in humans indicates that it is closely related to common reassortant swine influenza A viruses isolated in North America, Europe, and Asia [3] . The 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus is comprised of RNA segments from both North American and Eurasian swine influenza and from avian influenza viruses [3] . Morlighem et al. found that the 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus had a high evolutionary rate [4] . Soon thereafter, oseltamivir-resistant 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus was found [5] . It is therefore prudent to find new antiviral agents.",

The extracts from TS leaves have a wide range of biologic functions, including glycemic control, anti-LDL glycative activity [7] , and improving cognitive function [8] . TS extracts have also been demonstrated to inhibit cancer cell growth in human ovarian cancer, human premyelocytic leukemia, human lung adenocarcinoma, and prostate cancer [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . The mechanism of anticancer activity by TS could be due to the generation of reactive oxygen species and mitochondria-mediated apoptosis [11, 14] . Moreover, TS possesses antiangiogenic activity through suppressing VEGFinduced expression of metalloproteinase-(MMP-) 9 and MMP-2 on endothelial cells [15] .",

We hypothesized that the TSL-1 might inhibit viral attachment and/or penetration of viral entrance into cells. As shown in Figure 4 (a) with viral genome load detection by qRT-PCR, TSL-1 could significantly inhibit viral attachment to prevent the entrance of host cells with the treatment of less than 10 g/mL TSL-1. To the contrary, TSL-1 could not exert the effect of inhibiting viral penetration into A549 cells even up to 100 g/mL treatment of TSL-1 (Figure 4(b) ). We further examined whether TSL-1 had any inhibitory activities towards NA through attachment or penetration process. Our results demonstrated that TSL-1 possessed inhibitory activities to NA through attachment effect with dose-dependent manner (Figure 4 (c)) but not through penetration effect (Figure 4(d) ). Influenza virus has an ability to adsorb to guinea pig red blood cells resulting in HA. We investigated if TSL-1 could interfere with the viral adsorption to RBC resulting in HA inhibition. The minimum concentration of 25 g/mL TSL-1 with the treatment procedure of attachment assay inhibits the adsorption ability of the virus (Figure 4(e) ). The 100 g/mL TSL-1 with the treatment procedure of penetration assay resulted in the inhibition of adsorption of the virus (Figure 4(f) ).

Amantadine had more inhibitory effect on TLR3 gene expression of A549 cells in the presence and absence of H1N1 viral infection compared to TSL-1 ( Figure 6(b) ). The mRNA levels of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, E-selectin, fractalkine (CX3CL1), and IL-8 were inhibited by both TSL-1 and Amantadine. TSL-1 was more efficient to suppress the gene expression of these molecules in comparison to Amantadine (Figure 6(b) ). As for the Bcl2-A1, we demonstrated that Amantadine was more effective to inhibit mRNA expression of Bcl2-A1 without H1N1 vial activation than TSL-1. However, TSL-1 was more efficient to reduce mRNA level of Bcl2-A1 with H1N1 vial activation compared to Amantadine (Figure 6(b) ).

This is reflected by their ability to block adherence, penetration, duplication, and/or maturation during the course of viral propagation [28] . Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) is the ester of epigallocatechin and gallic acid that has been reported to inhibit the infectivity of both influenza A and B viruses in MDCK cells in vitro [29] . The derivatives of gallic acid, including lauryl gallate and Octyl gallate, have shown to significantly inhibit influenza virus production [30, 31] . These polyphenols as antioxidants protected human cells against oxidative damage might play a role to prevent influenza virus attack. Kaempferol, a flavonoid, exhibited the highest activity against two influenza viruses, H1N1 and H9N2 [32] . It was also found that 8-prenylkaempferol isolated from Sophora flavescens suppressed RANTES secretion in H1N1-infected A549 alveolar epithelial cells by blocking PI3K-mediated transcriptional activation of NF-B and IRF-3 (in part by interfering with I B degradation and subsequently decreases NF-B translocation) [22] . A recent study found quercetin and isoquercetin (quercetin-3--d-glucoside) significantly reduced the replication of influenza viruses in vitro and in vivo and protected the lung from the deleterious effects of oxygen-derived free radicals released during influenza virus infection [33, 34] . Additionally, rutin and quercetin exhibit a prooxidant effect in healthy animals and antioxidant activity in influenza-infected animals through detoxicosis increased hepatic monooxygenase activity [35] . TSL-1 includes the above compounds, as its major constituents. As for which specific compound inhibits H1N1 influenza virus, further investigation and identification are required.",

To our knowledge, the early stages of influenza-host cell interaction include primary attachment of virus and subsequent irreversible attachment. We confirmed that TSL-1 blocked viral entry through attachment assay. TSL-1 may interact with viral proteins and alter the adsorption and penetration of the virion. In this study, we demonstrated that TSL-1 is more effective than Amantadine in inhibiting H1N1 infection. Moreover, the mechanisms of TSL-1 and Amantadine H1N1 inhibition are different. Our results demonstrated that TSL-1-mediated inhibition of H1N1 influenza virus-induced adhesion molecules and chemokines expressions was more prominent compared to Amantadine, and correlated well with decreased mRNA levels in A549 cells.",

Recently, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expressions were found to be upregulated on the surface of alveolar endothelial cells upon influenza A virus infection [22] . As we know, the major targets for influenza virus infection in host cells are located on the upper and lower airways. Influenza virus infection of epithelial cells and endothelial cells generally results in amplified viral replication and enhances the expression of adhesion molecules by the host cell to attract leukocytes for immunity. In our current study, analyses of cellular adhesion molecule expression on A549 in response to H1N1 virus infection revealed an upregulation of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin; this is subsequently inhibited by TSL-1. This indicates that TSL-1 is effective in decreasing the adhesion molecules expressed to protect the host from continual viral infection.",

Beck et al. discussed the importance of chemokine biology in the progression of acute lung injury [37] . Recently, it was discovered that IL-8 and lung injury score independently predicted mortality in ARDS, and IL-8 was the most predictive of mortality [38] . Decreasing the release of TNF-and IL-6 played a protective role to decrease vascular permeability and leukocyte recruitment through downregulation of fractalkine [39] . In our current study, IL-8 and fractalkine production after H1N1 infection was significantly downregulated by TSL-1. In brief, TSL-1 not only inhibits H1N1 viral infection but also attenuates the production of a critical chemokine, IL-8, and fractalkine that are responsible for acute lung injury. Therefore, TSL-1 might have the potential to not only decrease H1N1 infection but also to attenuate the severity of acute lung injury after H1N1 infection.",

TSL-1 is more effective than Amantadine in inhibiting H1N1 via different pathways. The influenza virus infection imposes a considerable social and economic burden upon society. The nutritious vegetable Toona sinensis Roem may be an alternative supplement to traditional antiviral therapy.",

The membrane was incubated at room temperature in blocking solution: 1% BSA (bovine serum albumin), 1% goat serum in PBS for 1 hour, followed by a 2-hour incubation in blocking solution containing an appropriate dilution (1 : 1000) of primary antibody, for example, anti-VCAM, anti-ICAM, anti-E-selectin, anti-fractalkine (CX3CL1), anti-IL-8, anti-Bcl-2 related protein (Bcl2-A1), anti-TLR3, and antitubulin antibody (NeoMarkers, Fremonk, CA, USA). After washing, the membrane was incubated in PBS containing goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) for 1 hour.

Sequentially, 1/10 volume of 2 M sodium acetate (pH 4.0), one volume of phenol, and 1/5 volume of chloroform-isoamyl alcohol (49 : 1, v : v) were added to the homogenate. After vigorous vortexing for 30 seconds, the solution was centrifuged at 10,000 \u00d7g for 15 minutes at 4 \u2218 C. After removal of the aqueous phase, RNA was precipitated by the addition of 0.5 mL isopropanol. The primers and probe were designed using Probefinder v2.45 (http://qpcr.probefinder.com/roche3.html). qRT-PCR primers and an appropriate probe were chosen by the UPL Assay Design Center. The free online software specifies a set of specific primers plus the TaqMan locked nucleic acid (LNA) probe from the Roche Universal ProbeLibrary collection. The primers and probe are shown inTable 1. Two hundred nanograms of total RNA from control, infected A549 cells and TSL-1 treatment infected A549 cells, were used for quantitative RT-PCR analysis. PCR was performed on the LightCycler Instrument (Roche Diagnostics, Penzberg, Germany). Reaction was performed using the RealTime ready RNA Virus Master kit (Roche Diagnostics, Penzberg, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The quantization of target genes was determined by the relative quantitative comparative threshold cycle (\u0394\u0394Ct) method using the GAPDH as the endogenous control, where Ct is the threshold cycle. The quantification for the target gene in test sample against reference samples (uninfected cells) was using the formula 2 \u2212\u0394\u0394Ct , where \u0394\u0394Ct = (Ct of target gene in each test sample \u2212 Ct of GAPDH in each test sample) \u2212 (average Ct of target gene in reference samples \u2212 average Ct of GAPDH in reference samples).",
