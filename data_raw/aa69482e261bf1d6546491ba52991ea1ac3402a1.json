            "text": "Important advances have been made in the immunodiagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) based on the detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB)-specific T cells. However, the sensitivity and specificity of the immunological approach are relatively low because there are no specific markers for antigen-specific Th cells, and some of the Th cells that do not produce cytokines can be overlooked using this approach. In this study, we found that MTB-specific peptides of ESAT-6/CFP-10 can stimulate the expression of CD40L specifically in CD4 + T cells but not other cells from pleural fluid cells (PFCs) in patients with tuberculous pleurisy (TBP). CD4 + CD40L + but not CD4 + CD40L 2 T cells express IFN-c, IL-2, TNF-a, IL-17 or IL-22 after stimulation with MTBspecific peptides. In addition, CD4 + CD40L + T cells were found to be mostly polyfunctional T cells that simultaneously produce IFN-c, IL-2 and TNF-a and display an effector or effector memory phenotype (CD45RA 2 CD45RO + CCR7 2 CD62L 2 ICOS 2 ). To determine the specificity of CD4 + CD40L + T cells, we incubated PFCs with ESTA-6/CFP-10 peptides and sorted live CD4 + CD40L + and CD4 + CD40L 2 T cells by flow cytometry. We further demonstrated that sorted CD4 + CD40L + , but not CD4 + CD40L 2 fractions, principally produced IFN-c, IL-2, TNF-a, IL-17 and IL-22 following restimulation with ESTA-6/CFP-10 peptides. Taken together, our data indicate that the expression of CD40L on MTB-specific CD4 + T cells could be a good marker for the evaluation and isolation of MTB-specific Th cells and might also be useful in the diagnosis of TB.",

TBP resolves spontaneously in some patients without treatment. Thus, TBP is thought to be a good model system for studying the protective immune response at the site of infection [2] . It is well recognized that cell-mediated immunity is required for an effective response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection. In MTB infection, the Th1 response has been shown to be protective [3] . IFN-c, a Th1 type cytokine that is the most important factor for macrophage activation, is essential for TB immunity [4] . Although some studies have shown that IL-4 is not essential for the development of a protective immune response to MTB [5, 6] , Sugawara et al. showed that IL-4 is required for proper defense against TB infection [7] . In addition, Th17 cells can recruit granulocytes to the site of MTB persistence to produce inflammation [8] ; these cells seem to play an important role in the early development of protective immunity in the lungs [8, 9, 10] . IL-22-producing CD4 + T cells are distinct from Th1 and Th17 cells and have also been shown to play important roles in the human immune response to mycobacteria [11] .",

However, using cytokines to detect Th cells could bias the measurement of the frequencies of antigen-specific Th cells. Moreover, antigenspecific T cells that do not produce cytokines would be missed using this approach [12, 13, 14, 15] . Previous work has shown that the expression of CD40L (CD154) can be used to detect Th cells that are specific for defined antigens and to isolate viable Th cells for further study [16, 17] . CD40L is expressed by antigen-specific T cells following activation and could provide costimulatory signals to APCs (antigen-presenting cells) [18] and B cells [19, 20] . Because CD40L is only transiently expressed on the cell surface, it is difficult to detect [21, 22] . A modified assay has been developed that stabilizes the intracellular expression of CD40L with the secretion inhibitor Brefeldin A (BFA) [16] . Another assay uses the detection antibody and a protein transport inhibitor, monensin, to detect surface expression of CD40L directly [17] .",

In addition, CD40L expression was not detected in either CD4 + or CD8 + T cells of PBMCs following stimulation with ESAT-6/CFP-10 peptides (Fig. 1A) .

Statistical results indicated that significantly higher expression of CD40L by CD4 + T cells was induced in PFCs than PBMCs (data not shown), suggesting that CD40L expression is induced on antigen-specific CD4 + T cells. However, no detectable expression of CD40L by CD8 + T cells from either PBMCs or PFCs was observed following either antigen-specific or polyclonal stimulation with anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 (Fig. 1) , suggesting that the expression of CD40L is predominantly restricted to CD4 + T cells.",

From the CD4 + T cells analyzed, only the cells expressing CD40L produced IFN-c, IL-2, TNF-a, IL-17 or IL-22 ( Fig. 2A) , suggesting that the expression of CD40L identifies the majority of the responding Th cells. Moreover, considerably higher levels of Th1 cytokines (IFN-c, IL-2 and TNFa) were found to be expressed by CD4 + CD40L + T cells, suggesting that the majority of CD4 + CD40L + T cells are Th1 cells. We confirmed this idea by detecting the expression of T-bet, an essential transcriptional factor in Th1 cells. We found that more than 90% of CD4 + CD40L + T cells express T-bet (Fig. 2D) . We also measured the expression of Th2 cytokines and found that little to no IL-4 or IL-10 is induced following stimulation with ESAT-6/ CFP-10 peptides (data not shown). We found that Th1 cytokineproducing CD4 + CD40L + cells were significantly more abundant than CD4 + CD40L 2 cells (Fig. 2B) . Moreover, CD4 + CD40L + T cells were found to produce significantly higher amounts of IL-17 and IL-22 than CD4 + CD40L 2 T cells. However, the cytokine level was considerably lower than in Th1-cytokine-producing cells (Fig. 2C ), suggesting that natural MTB infection induces a mixed Th-cell response characterized by Th1, Th17 and Th22 cells.",

We found that the CD4 + T cells that express at least one Th1 cytokine (IFN-c, IL-2 or TNF-a) are mostly CD40L + (71.6462.44%, mean 6 SEM); cells that do not express any of the measured Th1 cytokines are mostly CD40L 2 (3.5061.39%, Fig. 3A , B). We then analyzed the cytokine profiles of CD4 + CD40L + T cells by measuring the production of IFN-c, IL-2 and TNF-a. We found that CD4 + CD40L + T cells produce IFN-c, IL-2 and TNF-a, either concurrently or individually (Fig. 3C) . We defined the total Th1 response in the CD4 + CD40L + T cells as the percentage of T cells expressing any combination of IFN-c, IL-2 or TNF-a. With this metric, seven distinct functional populations could be delineated: IFN-c/IL-2/TNF-a triple expressers, IFN-c/IL-2, IFN-c/TNF-a or TNF-a/IL-2 double expressers or IFN-c, IL-2 or TNF-a single expressers. Polyfunctional T cells that simultaneously produce IFN-c, IL-2 and TNF-a (IFN-c/IL-2/TNF-a triple expressers) were found to dominate the CD4 + CD40L + T cells. The percentage of polyfunctional T cells was found to be considerably higher than that of the other six subsets (Fig. 3D ). The percentage of double producers (15.53%) was found to be similar to the percentage of single producers (15.60%, Fig. 3E ).",

PFCs were stimulated with ESAT-6/CFP-10 peptides in the presence of a fluorescently labeled CD40L monoclonal antibody and monensin. CD4 + T cells and CD14 + cells were purified with a positive microbead selection (Fig. 5A ). CD4 + CD40L + and CD4 + CD40L 2 T cells were then isolated using flow cytometry (Fig. 5B) . We then restimulated either CD4 + CD40L + or CD4 + CD40L 2 T cells with CD14 + cells (antigenpresenting cells) in the presence of ESAT-6/CFP-10 peptides and measured the production of cytokines. Notably, CD4 + CD40L + but not CD4 + CD40L 2 fractions produced considerably higher levels of IFN-c, IL-2 and TNF-a (Fig. 5C, D) . Similarly, significantly higher levels of IFN-c, IL-2 and TNF-a were detected in the supernatants of CD4 + CD40L + fractions than in those of CD4 + CD40L 2 (Fig. 5E) . We also assessed the levels of IL-4, IL-10, IL-17 and IL-22 in culture supernatants. Although low levels of IL-17 and IL-22 were detected, it is clear that the CD4 + CD40L + fractions were highly enriched for both IL-17 and IL-22 compared with CD4 + CD40L 2 fractions (Fig. 5E) . IL-21, as well as the Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-10, was not detectable in our co-culture system (data not shown).

Thus, TIGRA cannot be used to measure MTBspecific Th cells that do not produce IFN-c following antigen stimulation. The complexity of the T helper subsets that are involved in natural TB infection and the limitations of measuring antigenspecific Th cells with cytokine production make the identification of a marker to directly evaluate the entire repertoire of antigenspecific Th cells an important research topic. In this study, we found that CD40L expression on CD4 + T cells is a good marker for the evaluation of MTB-specific Th cells. This measurement allows us to estimate the quantity, as well as quality, of MTBspecific Th cells. We used intracellular staining to detect CD40L expression with BFA [16] , and we isolated viable CD4 + CD40L + cells using a fluorescently-labeled CD40L-specific antibody and monensin treatment [17] .",

Therefore, we believe that CD40L can be used not only as a marker for MTB-specific Th cells but also as a highly specific marker of polyfunctional Th cells. In other words, the detection of CD4 + CD40L + cells could represent MTB-specific Th1 cells, and we could thus evaluate polyfunctional T cells without measuring all three cytokines simultaneously. CD4 + CD40L + T cells display CD45RA 2 CD45RO + CCR7 2 CD62L 2 ICOS 2 effector or effector memory cells with the expression of some activation markers, including CD69 and HLA-DR but not CD25 and ICOS. Our results suggest that CD40L cannot be replaced by other activation markers to evaluate antigen-specific CD4 + T cells.

We showed that sorted CD4 + CD40L + but not CD4 + CD40L 2 fractions produce high levels of IFN-c, IL-2 and TNF-a following restimulation with ESAT-6/CFP-10 peptides. This result is consistent with those of our initial assay. We also demonstrated that sorted CD4 + CD40L + fractions produce significantly higher levels of IFN-c, IL-2, TNF-a, IL-17 and IL-22 but not Th2 cytokines (IL-4 and IL-10) compared with CD4 + CD40L 2 fractions. These results demonstrate that the expression of CD40L on MTBspecific CD4 + T cells is a good marker for the evaluation of all T helper subsets involved in TB infection. Our results further suggest that distinct T helper cells are induced during natural MTB infection and that these cells differ in their ability to provide CD40L-mediated help from APC and B cells [10] .",

For the analysis of CD40L expression and Th1 cytokine-producing cells, we chose anti-IFN-c, anti-IL-2 and anti-TNF-a monoclonal antibodies labeled with the same fluorescence. Thereafter, we performed the staining of CD40L and IFN-c/IL-2/TNF-a in one FACS tube. We could thus analyze CD40L expression and IFN-c/IL-2/TNF-a expression in one graph.
