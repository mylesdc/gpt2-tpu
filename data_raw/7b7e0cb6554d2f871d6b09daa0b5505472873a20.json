            "text": "Several international public health crises have emerged in recent years, including Ebola, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and Zika virus. In addition to these novel threats, there has been a resurgence of previously nearly eradicated infectious diseases, including mumps. In recent years, the numbers of mumps cases in the United States has fluctuated from hundreds to thousands of cases per year. In 2006, a multi-state mumps outbreak in the Midwest consisted of over 6,500 cases. In 2009-2010, two large outbreaks occurred in New York City and Guam, affecting about 3,000 and 500 persons respectively. In 2011-2013, there were smaller outbreaks in several states. 1 Many of the outbreaks occurred among college students. There was also a large outbreak in late 2014 among professional hockey players involving at least five teams in the National Hockey League (NHL), which began with players on the Anaheim Ducks. In March 2016, California public health officials issued an advisory noting that five college students at the University of San Diego had been diagnosed with mumps; this was followed by a subsequent advisory identifying three additional mumps cases in college students diagnosed in Orange County, California. 2, 3 In April 2016, a high profile outbreak reported at Harvard University and surrounding areas resulted in more than 40 cases of mumps in less than two months. As of May 5, 2016, nearly 80 cases were reported in the state of Massachusetts with 50 cases at Harvard. 4 Over a 5-year period from 2011 to 2016, mumps cases reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have been steadily increasing, from 370 in 2011 to 1,148 as of May 21, 2016. 5 These cases and outbreaks as well as the potential decrease in measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccination Koenig et al. Mumps Virus: Modification of the Identify-Isolate-Inform Tool uptake due to parental refusal underscore the importance of the emergency department (ED) as a primary location for identification and containment of public health threats.",

            "text": "Patients frequently present to the ED with undifferentiated chief complaints, making rapid and accurate diagnosis challenging. Most contagious diseases that manifest with nonspecific influenza-like illness symptoms and signs will not ultimately be determined to be rare and deadly diseases like Ebola or MERS; however, they may be contagious and require immediate isolation. This underscores the need for emergency physicians to have the necessary information and tools to rapidly identify potential public health threats. While the mumps virus is typically mild and self-limited, it is highly contagious for susceptible patients when proper isolation and containment measures are not rapidly initiated; a single case can result in up to 12 secondary cases in a susceptible population. 6 Infection can occur despite vaccination, and most cases seen in college outbreaks have occurred in fully vaccinated patients. Further, the mumps virus can sometimes have serious long-term sequelae including infertility/ subfertility, central nervous system (CNS) infection, deafness, and severe pancreatitis. In rare cases, these complications can be fatal. 7 Given the highly contagious nature of the virus, it is paramount that frontline providers be aware of how to identify the clinical manifestations of mumps virus and understand how to properly isolate potentially infected patients and rapidly inform necessary authorities of a potential case. This paper provides a comprehensive review of mumps infection followed by a brief discussion of the novel 3I tool, initially developed for Ebola virus and subsequently for measles, MERS and Zika virus, [8] [9] [10] [11] as adapted for use by healthcare providers in the initial detection and management of mumps.",

Parotitis is typically seen in 31-65% (with some authoritative texts citing 60-70%) of cases of mumps infection. In about three quarters of patients, the other parotid gland becomes involved. 12, 13 The parotitis is nonsuppurative and typically progresses for about three days and lasts for approximately one week. 13 Patients often have trismus and have difficulty chewing and speaking. In about 10% of cases, other salivary glands, especially the submandibular gland, can become involved and can mimic anterior cervical lymphadenopathy.",

For example, the United Kingdom has had several outbreaks since 2004, and Japan does not routinely vaccinate against mumps.

Collection of the specimen in the first three days of parotitis is optimal, but virus can still be detected in some cases up to nine days after onset of parotitis. Clinicians should contact local or state public health authorities to arrange for testing, as testing at commercial laboratories may be unreliable. Serologic diagnosis of acute mumps infection by testing for IgM and IgG antibodies may be unreliable, as the IgM response may be attenuated or absent in vaccinated persons, and persons with detectable IgG titers can still develop mumps. 16 ",

            "text": "In post-pubertal males, the most common complication of mumps infection is orchitis. In the era prior to the advent of the MMR vaccine, orchitis occurred in between 12% to 66% of post-pubertal males with mumps. In the post-vaccination era, orchitis has been reported in 15% to 40% of post-pubertal males. 12 Orchitis typically occurs about 10 days after the onset of parotitis, although it can be seen up to six weeks later. Orchitis is typically unilateral, but bilateral orchitis manifests in 15-30% of cases. 13 Orchitis may be accompanied by epididymitis up to 85% of the time. 17 Mumps orchitis can lead to a range of testicular complications. True infertility following mumps orchitis is rare but subfertility has been seen in up to 13% of patients. Subfertility can occur even without accompanying testicular atrophy. 7, 18-20 Testicular atrophy (any reduction in testicular size) occurs in 30-50% of patients with orchitis. 6 Abnormalities of spermatogenesis have been observed to occur in up to half of patients for up to three months after recovery from the acute illness. 20 Mumps orchitis and subsequent testicular atrophy have been weakly associated with the development of testicular tumors, including cancer, with an incidence of 0.5%. 7, 21, 22 Other complications of mumps infection include meningitis, which may occur in up to 10% of cases. When meningitis does occur, it is typically seen 3-4 days after the onset of parotitis. 6 Acute encephalitis and encephalomyelitis are rare. When acute encephalitis due to mumps occurs, it is typically self-limiting. Acute encephalomyelitis, on the other hand, tends to be much more severe. Case fatality rates for acute encephalomyelitis due to mumps virus are up to 10%, while the overall case fatality rate due to CNS complications from mumps virus has been reported to be about 1%. 23 Sensorineural hearing loss is another CNS complication of mumps infection. Permanent unilateral hearing loss has been reported to occur in 1 of every 20,000 cases. Bilateral hearing loss is much less frequent. Other rare CNS complications include Guillain Barre Syndrome, transverse myelitis, facial palsy, cerebellar ataxia and flaccid paralysis. 7 Oophoritis (ovarian inflammation) has been reported to occur in 5% of post-pubertal females. Symptoms of oophoritis may include lower abdominal pain, vomiting and fever. Longterm sequelae of oophoritis, while rare, may include infertility or premature menopause. Mastitis (breast inflammation) has also been reported as a complication of mumps infection in post-pubertal females. 7 In some studies, mumps infection in early pregnancy has been linked with spontaneous abortion, with one study identifying a 27% rate of fetal death after first trimester mumps infection compared with 13% in a control group. 7, 24 A second, more recent study has not shown the same association between spontaneous abortion and mumps infection in early pregnancy. 25 As of early 2016, there is no reported association between perinatal mumps infection and significant congenital malformations. 7 Other rare complications associated with mumps infection include pancreatitis (with rare reported cases of severe hemorrhagic pancreatitis), ECG abnormalities (depressed ST segments, prolonged PR intervals and inverted T waves), myocarditis, polyarthritis, abnormal renal function (with rare reports of severe or fatal nephritis), hepatitis, acalculous cholecystitis, kerato-uveitis, hemophagocytic syndrome and thrombocytopenia. 7 (Table) ",

Previously unvaccinated schoolaged children/post high school students, international travelers and healthcare providers should also receive two doses of the MMR vaccine while other unvaccinated adults should receive one dose of the vaccine. CDC estimates that about 90% of people are protected after two MMR doses. Like other live virus vaccines, the MMR vaccine should not be administered to pregnant women, persons on immunosuppressive therapy, those with congenital or acquired immunodeficiency disorders, persons with severe febrile illnesses, advanced malignancies, or those persons with advanced HIV disease. Other prevention methods include isolation of cases as detailed previously as well as use of respiratory hygiene/cough etiquette. 28",

The first step was to identify patients with an epidemiologic risk factor (potential exposure to a symptomatic Ebola patient) coupled with symptoms of disease. Once identified as a \"patient under investigation,\" isolation had to be immediately implemented and both public health and hospital infection prevention authorities notified of the case. The 3I tool was conceived by Koenig, approved by the American College of Emergency Physicians Expert Ebola Panel and adopted and distributed to EDs nationwide by the CDC. Subsequently the 3I tool was modified for use in MERS, measles, and Zika viruses, in each case considering disease characteristics (e.g., contagious prior to or only after symptom onset, incubation periods, epidemiologic risk factors, types of isolation necessary).",

Accordingly, the first branch of the algorithm involves determination of whether the patient is symptomatic or asymptomatic. For asymptomatic patients, exposure history must be elicited as mumps can be transmitted 1-2 days prior to symptom onset. For patients with a history of exposure to the mumps virus, there is no clear evidence to support reduction of clinical disease severity through post-exposure MMR vaccination or immunoglobulin administration. 7 Public health monitoring of asymptomatic patients for development of signs and symptoms is recommended. Each prior 3I tool (e.g., for Ebola, MERS, measles, and Zika) considered specific disease characteristics, and the algorithms were modified accordingly. For example, Ebola is not contagious from person to person prior to symptom onset, and therefore, no PPE or isolation would be indicated in an asymptomatic person.",
