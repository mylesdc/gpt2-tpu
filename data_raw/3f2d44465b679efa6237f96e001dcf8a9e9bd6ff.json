Most pathogenic viruses encode proteins that interfere with the activation of host innate immune responses. Like other flaviviruses, ZIKV interferes with the expression of interferon (IFN) genes and inhibits IFN-induced antiviral responses. ZIKV infects through epithelial barriers where IFN-\u03bb1 is an important antiviral molecule. In this study, we analyzed the effects of ZIKV proteins on the activation of IFN-\u03bb1 promoter. All ZIKV proteins were cloned and transiently expressed. ZIKV NS5, but no other ZIKV protein, was able to interfere with the RIG-I signaling pathway. This inhibition took place upstream of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) resulting in reduced phosphorylation of IRF3 and reduced activation of IFN-\u03bb1 promoter. Furthermore, we showed that ZIKV NS5 interacts with the protein kinase IKK\u03b5, which is likely critical to the observed inhibition of phosphorylation of IRF3.",

In humans, ZIKV infection has been associated with a mild disease characterized by fever, rash, arthritis, and conjunctivitis [1] . However, the recent epidemic in the Americas in 2013-2015 in an immunologically na\u00efve population revealed that ZIKV can also cause severe neurological symptoms, such as Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome and microcephaly [2] . ZIKV is primarily spread by Aedes species mosquitoes, and vertical and sexual transmission among humans was confirmed during the last epidemic. Multiple infection routes of ZIKV are facilitated by its ability to productively infect several types of human cells, such as skin fibroblast and dendritic cells [3] , Sertoli cells [4] , trophoblast progenitor cells and cytotrophoblasts, as well as placental macrophages [5, 6] . ZIKV also replicates in human brains and cells of the neuronal origin [7, 8] .",

            "text": "Infected cells respond to virus infections by activating innate immune responses. In RNA virus infection, especially the RIG-I-like pattern recognition receptors, RIG-I and MDA5 recognize ssRNA and dsRNA molecules of invading and replicating viruses. RIG-I-like receptors activate signaling cascades involving cellular kinases that eventually phosphorylate and activate transcription factors IRF3, IRF7, and NF-kB. These factors translocate into the nucleus and initiate the expression of type I (IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2) and type III interferon (IFN-\u03bb1-4) and other inflammatory cytokine genes. IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 is produced by several cell types, whereas IFN-\u03bbs are produced by immune cells and cells of epithelial origin [9] . Virus-infected cells secrete IFNs that bind to their specific receptors, IFNAR1-IFNAR2 (IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2) and IL28Ra-IL10Rb (IFN-\u03bb1-4) initiating a signaling cascade leading to the phosphorylation, activation, and dimerization of transcription factors STAT1 and STAT2. STAT1/STAT2 dimers associate with IRF9 to form the so-called ISGF3 complex, which then translocates into the nucleus where it activates the transcription of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). This initiates cellular antiviral responses via the production of antiviral proteins such as MxA, Viperin, and IFIT proteins [10] [11] [12] [13] . Most, if not all, pathogenic viruses encode proteins that interfere with the activation host innate immune responses.",

The polyprotein is cleaved by cellular and viral proteases into individual proteins. ZIKV infection leads to the production of interferons and antiviral proteins [14] and ZIKV RNA has been shown to stimulate both RIG-I and MDA5 receptors [15] . In order to replicate more efficiently in virus-infected cells, ZIKV has mechanisms to evade or delay the activation of innate immune responses. Recent studies have shown that ZIKV can interfere with interferon-induced responses: ZIKV infection inhibits STAT1 and STAT2 phosphorylation [16] , and especially ZIKV NS5 protein inhibits STAT1 phosphorylation [15] and induces the proteasomal degradation of STAT2 [15, [17] [18] [19] . ZIKV NS2B-NS3 protein complex promotes the degradation of Jak1 resulting in reduced STAT1 phosphorylation [20] . ZIKV E, NS4A, and NS5 proteins inhibit the expression of IFIT1 gene [18] , and NS1, NS2B3, NS4B, and NS5 proteins have been shown to inhibit the expression of IFIT2 gene [20] . In addition, NS1, NS2B, NS4A, and NS5 proteins inhibit IFN-\u03b2-induced, and NS5 protein also IFN-\u03bb1-induced ISRE activation [15, 18, 19] . ZIKV also interferes with the production of IFNs: ZIKV infection prevents the translation of type I and III IFNs in dendritic cells [16] . Several ZIKV proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS4A, NS4B, NS5) have also been shown to inhibit the activation of IFN-\u03b2 promoter [15, 18, [20] [21] [22] . NS1, NS4A, and NS5 proteins were demonstrated to inhibit the activation of IRF3 and NS5 was shown to inhibit NF-\u03baB reporters [18] . In most of the events described above the exact molecular mechanisms are not known. However, it has been suggested that some ZIKV proteins block TBK1 function [20] [21] [22] leading to reduced IRF3 phosphorylation [21] .",

We found that the ZIKV NS5 protein efficiently inhibits RIG-I-induced IRF3 phosphorylation, leading to a reduction in type I and type III interferon promoter activation. We show here that ZIKV NS5 interacts with IKK\u03b5, an important downstream kinase of the RIG-I pathway. The data indicates that this interaction leads to impaired ability of IKK\u03b5 to phosphorylate and activate IRF3 leading to reduced activation of IFN promoters including that of the IFN-\u03bb1 gene.",

In the presence of type I interferon neutralizing antibodies, ZIKV NS5 showed a similarly strong 80% inhibition of IFN-\u03bb1 promoter activation ( Figure 2C ), indicating that NS5 acts directly on the RIG-I pathway. The efficacy of the neutralizing antibody mixture is shown in Figure 3 where it strongly inhibited IFN-\u03b2-induced activation of IFN-inducible MxA-promoter.

It has been reported that in the African lineage MR766 ZIKV NS5, which has been shown to inhibit IRF3 phosphorylation by blocking TBK1 activation, the full-length native NS5 protein is required for the inhibitory effect to occur [22] . To study whether the observed inhibitory effect of the Asian lineage FB-GWUH-2016 ZIKV NS5 on \u2206RIG-I-induced IFN-promoter activation was associated with either one of the functional domains, the N-terminally HA-tagged domains were expressed separately or simultaneously, together with the IFN-\u03bb1-promoter-luciferase reporter and \u2206RIG-I. The full-length ZIKV NS5, ZIKV NS3, and the HCV NS3/4A were used as controls ( Figure 4A ). The expression of the domains was confirmed by immunoblotting ( Figure 4B ). Full-length NS5 and HCV NS3/4A strongly and dose-dependently inhibited the activation of IFN-\u03bb1-promoter whereas the expression of separate MTase and RdRp domains alone or simultaneously displayed no inhibitory effect on the \u2206RIG-I-induced IFN-\u03bb1 promoter activation. The location of the tag was not relevant, since the results were the same with C-terminally myc-tagged MTase and RdRp expression constructs.

ZIKV NS3 and HCV NS3/4A were used as putatively negative and positive controls, respectively. Overexpression of the pathway components led to a strong activation of the IFN-\u03bb1 promoter ( Figure 6 ).

ZIKV NS3 had no inhibitory effect on any of the pathway components. Surprisingly, ZIKV NS5 dose-dependently inhibited the activation of IFN-\u03bb1 promoter by all the pathway components, indicating that the inhibitory effect of ZIKV NS5 may act at or downstream IRF3 activation. It is noteworthy that the inhibitory effect of ZIKV NS5 on IKK\u03b5 overexpression-induced activation of the IFN-\u03bb1 promoter was detected only with reduced amounts (from 30 ng per well to 3 ng per well) of IKK\u03b5 expression plasmid, indicating that high-level expression of IKK\u03b5 can override the inhibitory effect of NS5 ( Figure 6 , at the bottom).

Secreted IFNs protect cells from virus infection, and ZIKV infection is inhibited in cells pretreated with IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2, IFN-\u03bb1, or IFN-\u03b3 [3, 18, 46] . Of these, IFN-\u03bb1 is especially important in protecting epithelial barriers from virus infection [9] and, as shown earlier, ZIKV infection is prevented in placental trophoblasts which are secreting IFN-\u03bb1 [45] . Thus, IFN-\u03bb1 is important in protection from ZIKV infection since ZIKV spreads through epithelial barriers such as the skin, the blood-brain barrier, and the placenta. However, like other flaviviruses, ZIKV has the means to inhibit or delay the activation of innate immune responses. So far, most studies have focused on type I IFNs. In this study, we systematically analyzed the effect of all ZIKV proteins on the RIG-I pathway and type III IFN-\u03bb1 promoter activation. We found that ZIKV NS5 protein efficiently inhibited the RIG-I pathway by interacting with IKK\u03b5 followed by inhibition of phosphorylation of IRF3 and reduced activation of IFN promoters.",

Wu and coworkers have shown that ZIKV NS1 and NS4B inhibit IFN-\u03b2 promoter activation by interacting with TBK-1 preventing its dimerization and phosphorylation [20] . Xia et al. [21] reported that IFN-\u03b2 promoter activation was inhibited by NS2A, NS2B, and NS4B via blocking the phosphorylation of TBK-1. In addition, ZIKV NS4A suppressed IRF3 phosphorylation and NS5 was suggested to function on IRF3, possibly by interfering with the nuclear import of IRF3 [21] . Lin et al. reported that NS5 prevented IRF3 phosphorylation by direct binding to TBK-1 [22] . Our data on ZIKV NS5 inhibiting the activation of the IFN-\u03bb1 promoter is well in line with the results described above, suggesting a function for ZIKV NS5 at or after activation of IRF3. However, in contrast to the results by Xia et al. [21] , we observed that ZIKV NS5 inhibited the phosphorylation of IKK\u03b5 and IRF3. In addition, we found a reduction in the amounts of IKK\u03b5 with increasing expression levels of NS5, and furthermore, IKK\u03b5 was also found to bind to NS5. In contrast to the data from Lin et al. [22] who demonstrated that NS5 can interact with TBK-1, we and Xia et al. [21] did not observe the inhibitory effect of NS5 on TBK-1. This discrepancy may be due to differences in the used ZIKV strains, cell types, or expression constructs, as well as differences in overall experimental conditions. Indeed, Esser-Nobis et al. [48] recently showed that infection with Zika viruses of different genetic lineages (Asian vs. African) led to differences in innate immune responses, resulting in differential IRF3 phosphorylation. In the above-mentioned studies, Wu et al. [20] and Lin et al. [22] used African ZIKV strain in their experiments, while Xia et al. [21] used both African and Asian lineage viruses, which both showed NS5-related inhibition of IFN-\u03b2-promoter activation.",

            "text": "Different flaviviruses are known to have different functions for the same/similar proteins. Flavivirus NS5 proteins have two active domains: A methyltransferase and an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase domain. Even though these biological functions are similar amongst flaviviruses, NS5 sequences of flaviviruses show up to 45% differences at amino acid level [17] allowing these proteins to have variable biological functions. For instance, DENV NS5 induces STAT2 degradation via E3 ubiquitin ligase [49] , WNV NS5 inhibits IFNAR1 expression [50] and STAT1 phosphorylation [51] , YFV NS5 binds to STAT2 and prevents its binding to ISRE sites [52] , and ZIKV NS5 binds to STAT2 and induces its proteasomal degradation [17] [18] [19] . ZIKV NS5 also inhibits STAT1 phosphorylation which leads to reduced IFN-induced ISRE activation [15] . Even minor changes in amino acid sequences have been shown to impact these mechanisms. For example, a single amino acid substitution in ZIKV NS1 leads to a protein variant that targets the RIG-I pathway by inhibiting TBK-1 phosphorylation [21] . In addition, a single amino acid substitution in WNV NS2A protein leads to an attenuated virus phenotype with an inability to inhibit IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 production [53] . In our study, the NS genes originate from a highly pathogenic Asian lineage ZIKV strain isolated from fetal brain. Whether there was a selection towards a more fit/aggressive virus type with an exceptional ability to inhibit innate immune responses remains to be studied.",

Importantly, with higher expression levels of IKK\u03b5, the inhibitory effect of NS5 on IFN-\u03bb1 promoter activation was abolished, suggesting that the stoichiometry of NS5 and IKK\u03b5 has an impact on the inhibitory activity of NS5. Other viral proteins are also known to interfere with the functions of IKK\u03b5. For example, DENV NS2B/NS3 protein complex interacts with IKK\u03b5 and blocks its kinase activity [54] , MERS-CoV ORF4b protein inhibits the formation of MAVS and IKK\u03b5 complexes [55] , and arenavirus NP binds to and colocalizes with IKK\u03b5, preventing IKK\u03b5 autophosphorylation and IKK\u03b5-induced IRF3 phosphorylation [56] . It remains to be studied whether the inhibitory effect of ZIKV NS5 on IFN gene expression is due to direct binding of NS5 with IKK\u03b5 or whether NS5 targets some scaffold/modulating proteins on the IKK\u03b5 signalosome.",

ZIKV NS5 is a crucial protein for the life cycle of the virus. Importantly, the ZIKV NS5 structure has already been resolved [41, 57] facilitating the development of small molecular inhibitors that could be used as antiviral substances [58] .

In 2013, Zika virus spread to the immunologically na\u00efve population in the Americas and was found to cause severe neurological symptoms. In RNA virus infections, TLR and RLR signaling pathways are activated leading to the production of IFNs and activation of antiviral responses. Most pathogenic viruses, including the Zika virus, encode proteins that interfere with innate immune responses. Zika virus infects through epithelial barriers where IFN-\u03bb1 is an important component of the host cell defense. Here, we show that the Zika virus NS5 protein is able to interfere with the activation of IFN-\u03bb1 promoter, by targeting the IKK\u03b5 kinase of the RIG-I pathway. A more detailed understanding of the functions of ZIKV proteins on host cells will likely enable us to design new antiviral substances against this newly emerged virus infection.",
