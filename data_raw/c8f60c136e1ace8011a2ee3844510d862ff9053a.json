The best model was in this case P+/D+/S-, with only a minor difference in AIC with respect to P+/D+/S+. Differences in parameters values with respect to the baseline scenario are very small (Table S5) . Besides logistic regression showed the important role of nosocomial transmission, heterogeneity in transmission was not found by AIC selection criterion to be a critical ingredient for modeling secondary case generation.
