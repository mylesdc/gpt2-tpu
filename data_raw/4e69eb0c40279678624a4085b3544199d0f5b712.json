            "text": "Methods: A case-crossover design was used to identify associations between primary MERS cases and preceding weather conditions within the 2-week incubation period in Saudi Arabia using univariable conditional logistic regression. Cases with symptom onset between January 2015 -December 2017 were obtained from a publicly available line list of human MERS cases maintained by the World Health Organization. The complete case dataset (N = 1191) was reduced to approximate the cases most likely to represent spillover transmission from camels (N = 446). Data from meteorological stations closest to the largest city in each province were used to calculate the daily mean, minimum, and maximum temperature ( \u03bf C), relative humidity (%), wind speed (m/s), and visibility (m). Weather variables were categorized according to strata; temperature and humidity into tertiles, and visibility and wind speed into halves. Results: Lowest temperature (Odds Ratio = 1.27; 95% Confidence Interval = 1.04-1.56) and humidity (OR = 1.35; 95% CI = 1.10-1.65) were associated with increased cases 8-10 days later. High visibility was associated with an increased number of cases 7 days later (OR = 1.26; 95% CI = 1.01-1.57), while wind speed also showed statistically significant associations with cases 5-6 days later. Conclusions: Results suggest that primary MERS human cases in Saudi Arabia are more likely to occur when conditions are relatively cold and dry. This is similar to seasonal patterns that have been described for other respiratory diseases in temperate climates. It was hypothesized that low visibility would be positively associated with primary cases of MERS, however the opposite relationship was seen. This may reflect behavioural changes in different weather conditions. This analysis provides key initial evidence of an environmental component contributing to the development of primary MERS-CoV infections.",

            "text": "Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS--CoV) is an emerging zoonotic agent that was first isolated in 2012 from a patient hospitalized in Saudi Arabia [1] , and has since infected over 2200 people with a 36% case fatality ratio [2] . After an incubation period of 2-14 days [3] , the virus causes a disease (Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS) characterized by fever, cough, and shortness of breath, which commonly leads to pneumonia and respiratory failure [4] . The virus circulates silently in dromedary camels, the only known reservoir species and zoonotic source of spillover to humans [5] . However, not all primary human cases have documented exposure to dromedaries or their products, such as milk and meat. Although human-to-human community-acquired infections have not been documented, there is evidence that asymptomatic infections of MERS-CoV exist and could be a source of community transmission [6] . Zoonotic spillover from dromedary camels to humans has been documented in the Arabian Peninsula [7] . Subsequent secondary cases can occur after unprotected contact with family members and within healthcare facilities once the primary case seeks medical assistance [8] . While the sizes of MERS-CoV outbreaks have decreased thanks to improved infection control in healthcare settings in affected countries, cases continue to be reported regularly, especially in Saudi Arabia, where surveillance is strong [9] . In order to further reduce cases and prevent human outbreaks, a better understanding of zoonotic transmission of MERS-CoV is needed. A deeper understanding of the epidemiology of primary human cases can inform evidence-based interventions at the level of the community at the animal-human interface.",

Air quality is also associated with respiratory infections. Air pollution has been linked to pneumonia and acute lower respiratory infections [13, 14] , while dust storms are associated with infectious respiratory disease by acting both as a carrier of pathogens and increasing airway susceptibility to infection [15] . The risk of acquiring primary MERS may be influenced by changes in weather conditions in two ways. First, weather conditions may affect the viability and persistence of the virus in the environment and therefore its transmissibility [11, 16] . Secondly, weather influences behaviour, and it is plausible that the likelihood of people contacting camels depends on environmental conditions.

Case-crossover studies are designed so that exposures during a period of interest before a case are compared to exposures during control periods before or after the case. In this regard, case-crossover studies answer the question \"why now?\" as opposed to \"why these subjects?\" [17] . The design is well suited for rare diseases with short incubation periods such as MERS-CoV. The effect period, that is, the period of time after the proposed \"trigger\", typically has a degree of uncertainty [17] , leading to exposure windows with intervals of biological relevance to the outcome of interest. For infectious diseases, this would equate to the incubation period [18] . Furthermore, with appropriate selection of referent windows, the case-crossover design controls for confounding effects of temporal fluctuations such as climatic and livestock-associated seasons (e.g. the dromedary breeding cycle) [19] . By comparing weather conditions immediately before MERS cases to weather conditions at other times, this study aimed to identify environmental factors that are associated with primary human MERS in Saudi Arabia.",

Geographically, cases were restricted to those reported from Saudi Arabia, where the province of exposure was provided (n = 651). Cases that were likely primary cases were retained by excluding healthcare workers and cases with documented contact with known MERS cases (n = 128). Cases were further removed where symptom onset date was after hospitalization date (n = 44). Of the remaining cases (n = 479), 10 (2.1%) had missing symptom onset dates. To retain these ten cases, the median time between symptom onset date and lab confirmation date was calculated (6 days) and subtracted from the lab confirmation date to obtain an estimate of the symptom onset date. Visual inspection of the timeline of retained cases identified a spike from Riyadh province around August 2015, which corresponds to a documented MERS-CoV outbreak in the city of Riyadh from July-September 2015. Data from a published report of the outbreak contained weekly counts of primary and secondary cases [22] . These weekly counts were compared with the case list for this analysis and thirty-two secondary cases associated with the Riyadh outbreak were removed. The final number of retained cases fitting the primary case definition was 446 ( Fig. 1 ).

Each case's exposure status on individual days before disease onset (the exposure window) was compared to the exposure status on different days during a control period. Under the assumption that weather effects on virus transmission were immediate, the exposure window, that is, the time lag between weather events and disease onset, was set to be equal to the MERS incubation period of 2-14 days [3] . Univariable conditional logistic regression was used to assess statistical associations between cases and weather variables on each day within the case and control exposure windows. Associations with p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. A time-stratified design was used, with a 28-day strata length with random bi-directional controls matched by day of the week. Using a 28-day time window provides at least three control days for each case exposure day while minimizing bias introduced from seasonal changes [27] . Temperature and humidity variables were categorized into tertiles calculated within each time stratum. Wind speed and horizontal ground visibility were categorized into two groups within each stratum with the median as cutoff. Therefore, there is no single threshold for each weather variable, but rather \"low\", \"medium\" and \"high\" are determined according to the measurements in each stratum. Statistical analyses were conducted using STATA 15.0 (STATA Corporation, College Station, TX).",

It is primarily characterized by healthcare-associated outbreaks triggered by index cases who acquire infection from dromedary camels and possibly from unidentified asymptomatic human carriers. Improving our understanding of the epidemiology and risks of primary cases of MERS is vital for designing effective interventions that aim to reduce these index cases and prevent subsequent outbreaks in humans. The list of cases maintained by the WHO was restricted to a subset of primary cases based on explicit inclusion and exclusion criteria and was used to analyze the effect of weather on case occurrence using a case-crossover design. All four weather variables demonstrated statistically significant correlations within the incubation period for MERS in humans. The statistically significant time lags for each variable do not match up perfectly, which is to be expected and could be due to a number of reasons including natural variability in incubation periods, variable impact of weather on transmission, the interaction of unmeasured cofactors on weather variables as well the direct effect of unmeasured factors on transmission, and stochasticity in general.",

This study found that MERS-CoV, although a zoonotic disease, follows similar environmental transmission patterns to other non-zoonotic respiratory diseases with analogous modes of transmission such as influenza and respiratory syncytial virus. Tamerius et al. [30] have shown that global trends of influenza broadly follow either a \"cold-dry\" or \"humid-rainy\" pattern, corresponding to temperate and tropical climates. Additionally, temperate climates tend to have a single annual peak and tropical climates have semi-annual peaks. They further demonstrate that for countries with an annual influenza peak such as Saudi Arabia, temperature and humidity can be predictive of those peaks, even at latitudes close to the equator. Respiratory syncytial virus also follows similar environmental conditions, with peak timing in the Arabian Peninsula from December to February, following the distribution of cases in the temperate northern hemisphere [12] . The influence of weather is further supported by experimental evidence, which has demonstrated that lower temperatures and lower relative humidity each favour influenza transmission [11] . Furthermore, coronaviruses have been shown to exhibit strong seasonal variation in natural hosts, and the theory that these fluctuations may increase risk of zoonotic transmission at certain times of the year has been discussed [16] . The results here demonstrate that colder, drier conditions may increase the risk of zoonotic transmission of MERS from dromedaries to humans.",

A case-crossover study in the United States demonstrated the short-term effects of air pollution on acute lower respiratory infections [14] , while another study demonstrated increased numbers of pneumonia admissions following acute dust storm events in Taiwan [33] . Dust storms can act as a pathogen carrier and also induce inflammatory reactions, potentially increasing both exposure and susceptibility to disease agents [15] . Horizontal ground visibility and wind speed were used as proxies for the occurrence of sandstorms and acute air pollution events. Visibility can be reduced to 5000 m for an average of 3.5 h during a sandstorm [34] . Summarizing the weather data used in this study, the mean daily visibility by province ranged from 82 m to over 10,000 m, although the median value was over 9000 m in all but one province. The distribution of visibility indicates that Fig. 4 Daily mean and minimum temperature and risk of primary MERS by province in Saudi Arabia. Odds ratio (solid line) and 95% confidence limits (dashed lines) are plotted on the Y-axis, while time lags preceding case occurrence are plotted on the x-axis. The odds of primary MERS is increased with low temperature at 9 and 10 day lags (a &b), while the odds of primary MERS are decreased with high temperatures at 10 and 11 day lags (c & d). Asterisks indicate statistically significant odds ratios on corresponding days anything less than full clarity was categorized as low visibility, and that according to the measurements in [34] , could indicate the presence of a sandstorm. It was hypothesized that primary MERS infections are more likely to increase following sandstorms or other severe events of air pollution that affect visibility. However, results indicate that the risk of primary MERS infection increased following high visibility days, and decreased following low visibility days. This may be due to behaviour, if people are more likely to stay inside during acute weather events, and less likely to engage in activities such as interacting with camels. It was further hypothesized that higher wind speeds would be associated with more cases of MERS. While a positive association was found between cases and high maximum wind speeds 5 days prior, there were also similar results to those of visibility. Low minimum wind speed was positively correlated with cases, and conversely, when minimum wind speed was relatively high there were statistically fewer cases of MERS. Results suggest that further investigation of wind speed as a factor for primary MERS is warranted.",

The temperature and humidity findings are consistent with associations between the environment and other respiratory diseases. Further study of weather and seasonal risk factors may strengthen the evidence for an environmental component of MERS-CoV transmission. A better understanding of virus viability in different environmental conditions is also a key research need. Evidence of environmental risk factors for MERS could be utilized by public or One Fig. 6 Daily visibility and wind speed variables and risk of primary MERS by province in Saudi Arabia. Odds ratio (solid line) and 95% confidence limits (dashed lines) are plotted on the Y-axis, while time lags preceding case occurrence are plotted on the x-axis. The odds of primary MERS is increased with high visibility and decreased with low visibility after 7 days (a & c), while the odds of primary MERS are increased with low wind speed and decreased when wind speed is high at 6-day lags (b & d). When maximum wind speed was high, the odds of a MERS case were increased with a 5-day lag (not shown). Asterisks indicate statistically significant odds ratios on corresponding days Health practitioners for targeted interventions during higher-risk periods. The risk of MERS acquired from zoonotic transmission, or from asymptomatic carriers in the community, appears to be sensitive to weather conditions, providing key initial evidence of an environmental component for the development of primary MERS-CoV infections.
