According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), seasonal influenza affects 5% to 20% of the U.S. population and causes major economic impacts resulting from hospitalization and absenteeism. Understanding influenza dynamics and forecasting its impact is fundamental for developing prevention and mitigation strategies. We combine modern data assimilation methods with Wikipedia access logs and CDC influenza-like illness (ILI) reports to create a weekly forecast for seasonal influenza. The methods are applied to the 2013-2014 influenza season but are sufficiently general to forecast any disease outbreak, given incidence or case count data. We adjust the initialization and parametrization of a disease model and show that this allows us to determine systematic model bias. In addition, we provide a way to determine where the model diverges from observation and evaluate forecast accuracy. Wikipedia article access logs are shown to be highly correlated with historical ILI records and allow for accurate prediction of ILI data several weeks before it becomes available. The results show that prior to the peak of the flu season, our forecasting method produced 50% and 95% credible intervals for the 2013-2014 ILI observations that contained the actual observations for most weeks in the forecast. However, since our model does not account for re-infection or multiple strains of influenza, the tail of the epidemic is not predicted well after the peak of flu season has passed.

The competition asked entrants to forecast the timing, peak, and disease incidence of the 2013-2014 influenza season using Twitter or other Internet data to supplement ILI weekly reported data. The work described in this paper was conducted as an entry for this competition. The CDC challenge concluded on March 27 th , 2014. Though individual entries' scores were not announced, the winner was. Officials conducting the contest found each entry informative as to the capabilities of disease modeling to inform public policy but the general consensus was that the current state of influenza forecasting still has too much uncertainty to base public health policy on. Details of the contest will be announced in a forthcoming paper by the CDC [12] . Based on our entry to this contest, we present a novel method to provide a probabilistic forecast of the influenza season based on a mathematical model for seasonal influenza dynamics and historical U.S. influenza observations. The forecast is dynamically adjusted using a statistical filter as current influenza data is observed.",

ILINet data represent the collection of outpatient data from over 3,000 hospitals and doctors' offices across the U.S. Each week, these locations report the total number of patient visits and the number of those visits that were seen for ILI, defined as fever (temperature ! 100\u00b0F) and a cough or sore throat without a known cause other than influenza. Since 2003, these data have been collected weekly, year-round. ILINet data make up one portion of the CDC's complete influenza surveillance efforts. For example, U.S. influenzarelated mortality and virological strain data are also collected, but they are not used in this study.

Furthermore, the distribution and specific reporting practices of the approximately 3,000 healthcare providers involved in ILINet, the lack of care-seeking for many individuals infected with influenza, and the possibility of ILI symptoms without infection from the influenza virus complicates the understanding of the relation between a reported level of ILI and actual U.S. influenza prevalence.

Fortunately for epidemiologists, the methodology for generating probabilistic forecasts with a deterministic mathematical model based on observed data has been well developed in climatology, meteorology, and oceanography [20] [21] [22] . We demonstrate how the ensemble Kalman smoother, can be used to iteratively update a distribution of the influenza model's initial conditions and parameterizations. An advantage of our technique is that it retains information about when the model dynamics systematically diverge from the dynamics of observations. The systematic model divergence from observed influenza dynamics will be used as a basis for future research in model discrepancy to improve forecasts.",

However, this capability is still in its infancy in the field of public health. For more complete literature reviews on the field, we refer the reader to [23, 24] . Briefly, we present the literature on epidemic forecasting influencing this work, all of which rely on a Bayesian viewpoint to adjust an underlying disease model given incoming observations [25] . First, disease forecasting methods that use data to parameterize an underlying causal model of disease can use either sequential Monte Carlo type methods [14, [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] or ensemble methods [32] [33] [34] [35] . Some work has been done on comparing the two methods [36, 37] . There are also several works of a more statistical nature [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] , one that relies on a pure Kalman filter [44] , and one that uses variational assimilation methods [45] . Of these works, the majority tune a differential equation-based compartmental disease model [26, 28-30, 32, 33, 36, 37, 45] . However, some forecasts have been formed using agent based simulations [27, 31, 41] or spatial models [34, 35] .",

However, the methods to arrive at this prior are usually ad hoc and based on beliefs about the ranges for the parameters. It is therefore difficult to see how these methods may be applied to a general disease model given historic observations in the presence of model error. Our method for defining a prior parameterization/initialization can be generalized to any dataset pertaining to disease spread and disease model. After outlining the general forecast methodology, we describe the details of our data sources and model, the technique used to estimate a prior forecast, our data assimilation technique, and our measure of forecast accuracy. We then present an application of our methods to forecasting the 2013-2014 influenza season in the results section, and conclude with a summary of our approach and suggestions for future improvements.",

Using the MapReduce programming paradigm [46] , we aggregate these hourly requests into weekly access counts and normalize the total number of accesses per article using the total requests for all articles across the entire English Wikipedia in each week. Wikipedia access logs have been studied extensively in [15, 16] , and we refer the reader to these sources for thorough analyses of the data. In short, it was shown that for a range of infectious diseases across many countries, some articles have access rates that are highly correlated with public health infectious disease records. Simple statistical models trained using only these article access rates were capable of nowcasting and even forecasting public health data, achieving r 2 ! 0.9 in certain cases.",

To select these articles, we used the simple article selection procedure described in [15] : we first gathered access log time series for relevant articles linked to from the main influenza Wikipedia article [47] , including the main influenza article itself. This totaled approximately 50 articles. The correlation between each of the 50 article access log time series and U.S. ILI data was computed. It was found that access log time series from the five articles mentioned above were much more highly correlated with the ILI data than the remaining articles, so it was decided that only these five articles would be used. It is important to note that only examining this restricted set of 50 Wikipedia access logs will inevitably leave the potential for the existence of an un-investigated article that is highly correlated with ILI data. However, barring an exhaustive search of Wikipedia articles focusing on the articles linked from the main English influenza article seemed like a reasonable choice.",

Our forecasts are ordered by epidemiological week (also called CDC week or MMWR week) since this is how ILI data are reported by the CDC [48] . Epidemiological weeks are used throughout public health reporting in the U.S. (and many other regions of the world). Their widespread acceptance makes them a natural temporal scale to use in disease forecasting. The mathematical model we use for influenza spread does not include re-infection of individuals or loss of immunity and therefore can only hope to model one season's influenza course. For this reason, it was necessary to define a fixed maximum possible length influenza season that would include the earliest possible ramp up of the flu season and the latest possible tapering off. By examining the ILI data for the entire U.S. from the 2002-2003 season to the 2012-2013 season, it was found that influenza incidence does not start to noticeably increase until at least epidemiological week 32 (mid-August). Moreover, once the influenza peak has passed, the incidence decreases to non-epidemic levels by at least epidemiological week 20 (mid-May). To illustrate our maximal flu season's relation to historical ILI data we have includ- With the flu season defined to be between epidemiological week 32 and epidemiological week 20, even the 2009 H1N1 emergence is mostly accounted for. We emphasize that our definition of a fixed maximal influenza season allows us to avoid modeling influenza prevalence during the dormant summer months, a task which would require some re-introduction of susceptible individuals into the population. It is possible that, through modeling the increase of the susceptible population over the summer months or the change in distinct influenza strains the definition of an influenza season could be made unnecessary.",

Since there is usually a single dominant strain each flu season, we assumed that recovered individuals are then immune to the disease for the remainder of the season. In practice, this assumption is not entirely accurate since an individual that contracted and recovered from one strain can get infected from a different strain in the same season [56] . Indeed, in the 2013-2014 influenza season, an elevated level of ILI was maintained well after the primary peak. Upon investigation of World Health Organization and the National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (WHO/NREVSS) strain subtyping data this elevated level correlated with the emergence of influenza B as a secondary dominant strain. We still believe the presentation of our results using a single strain model to be informative especially since one will always have to weigh the cost of model parameter explosion, which can confound identifiability of the model from data with model complexity. After all, an influenza model with no spatial heterogeneity and n strains would consist of 2 n\u22121 (n+2) independent equations [60] compared to the three independent equations we must identify in (2).",

One of the most common schemes for data assimilation is based on the Kalman filter in which both the model error and observation error are assumed to be Gaussian and all mathematical models are assumed to be linear. Updating the model using observations is then accomplished by conditioning a joint Gaussian distribution. In particular, the ensemble Kalman filtering methods we use here, explained in detail below, have been successfully applied to non-linear systems of ordinary differential equations with a much higher degree of non-linearity and a much higher dimension than our S \u03bd EIR model [63] [64] [65] .

We can, of course, only perform this evaluation retrospectively since we require data to evaluate our forecasts against. Since the enKS method assumes that the forecast distributions are Gaussian, we can evaluate the forecast's precision by scaling the distance of our forecast mean from the observation using the ensemble covariance. Such a distance has been widely used in statistics and is commonly referred to as the Mahalanobis distance (M-distance) [68] . The M-distance gives a description of the quality of the forecast that accounts for both precision in the mean prediction and precision in the dispersion about the mean. Other methods of evaluating forecast accuracy such as the root mean square error only consider how close the mean of the forecast is to the observations. Thus, a distribution with a great deal of uncertainty, or dispersion, can have a small root mean square error compared to observations. A forecast is made up of an analysis ensemble of parameterizations fp i K g N i\u00bc1 , K is the index corresponding to the most recently assimilated observation and N is the size of the ensemble. Each p i K is drawn from a Gaussian distribution conditioned on the most recent observations as described above. We can form a forecast of ILI data for the entire season by propagating the p i K through our S \u03bd EIR model. We will denote the discretely sampled time series of these realizations by c i K . The M-distance will then be evaluated using the ensemble of forecast observations, fM f \u00bdc i K g N i\u00bc1 , corresponding to the infected proportion time series, after the time index K, with each c i K scaled to a percentage. The M-distance is then calculated from the M f \u00bdc i K using their sample mean and covariance denoted \u03bc obs and C obs , respectively. Lettingd K correspond to un-assimilated observations (i.e., observations with time indices greater than K), the M-distance we evaluate is",

This gives a common time frame for each of the historical data sets. Then, at each of these common time points, the average and standard deviation of the historical observations can be computed. Thus, the straw man forecast consists of a normal distribution at each corresponding time point in the forecast with an averaged mean and standard deviation. We can then evaluate the straw man's accuracy using the metric given in Eq (11). Given the simple construction of the straw man forecast, this provides a good baseline to necessarily beat, in terms of smaller M-distance, for any compartmental data assimilation-derived forecast. To illustrate the improvement in the M-distance metric of our data assimilative forecast over the straw man forecast, we will calculate the percent of growth (or decline) of the M-distance for the data assimilative forecast in the straw man forecast for each week of the forecast.",

This was done following the methods described above. An example fit using a stochastic optimization algorithm to find 10 approximate solutions to (9) for the 2006-2007 ILI data is shown in Fig 4. Two things can be noticed from this fit of our epidemiological model. First, there is often a small early peak in the ILI data before the primary peak and our model does a poor job of capturing this. In several conversations we've had with experts, the hypothesis has been put forward that the double peak in U.S. ILI data is due to under reporting during the holiday season in the U.S. However, from our observations the first peak can vary in its timing substantially and does not seem to be always present or strongly correlated with the holidays or emergence of separate influenza strains. Second, the ILI data usually remain elevated longer than our model's realizations can support. Under retrospective examination of the tail for the 2013-2014 season, the extended elevated ILI level appears to be due to the emergence of a secondary dominant strain. Further examination of this phenomenon using historical ILI data is necessary but beyond the scope of this study. Both of these areas point to systematic divergence of the model from data. It is always possible that our model fit is representative of influenza prevalence but, due to bias in the ILI reporting, diverges from the historical data. However, without a stronger ground truth dataset to support this, such hypotheses are difficult to test.",

For each of the influenza seasons, from 2003-2004 through 2012-2013, fits similar to the above were generated. These parameterizations formed the basis for our prior, \u03c0 0 (p). This is a good example of the seasonal S \u03bd EIR model's two areas of systematic divergence. In the weeks 50-1 there is a first peak that the model does not catch.

Unfortunately, in carrying out this process of model fitting and estimation of a log-normal prior, it becomes apparent that there is a strong negative bias in our prior forecasts.

The variance in the forecast at epidemiological week 43 is quite large and the mean forecast underestimates the peak. For the forecast made on epidemiological week 2, even the 90% credible region of the forecast diverges from the tail of the epidemic despite the addition of many more ILI observations. As discussed above, the underestimation of the forecast is most likely due to a bias toward low ILI seasons in the prior forecast we have used. In this way, the use of the enKS actually is a success since by our week 43 forecast the projected ILI peak is much higher than the median peak predicted in our prior distribution. In other words, the data assimilation method is performing well, but the prior and possibly the model itself has significant bias that needs to be corrected in future work. Model bias (i.e., systematic divergence of the model from ILI observations) is also responsible for the degradation of performance in our forecast once the ILI peak has past. Our S \u03bd EIR model has a difficult time simulating an elevated tail. Thus, there are fewer model parameterizations that are close to ILI observations by the 2 nd epidemiological week, so the variance in our forecast ensemble is reduced even though accuracy is decreased.",

For instance, in Fig 12, the 2013-2014 season is mostly included in the 50% credible interval. There is, therefore, no correlation between the forecast at successive time points. This is seen when sampling time series from this forecast (right). The lack of correlation in forecasts for successive weeks severely limits the usefulness of such a forecast for public health decision making. For instance, after the 2013-2014 ILI peak was observed a further ILI peak is forecast to be just as likely six weeks later. Forecasting the Influenza Season However, individual forecasts made from the straw man method look different, as time series, from an ILI season since little of the dynamics of ILI are present in the straw man model. On the other hand some of the 2013-2014 ILI data falls outside the 50% credible region during the 43 rd epidemiological week forecast in Fig 11. As discussed previously, this is most likely due to error in the original model and the bias toward low influenza seasons in our prior. However, the accuracy of a probabilistic forecast like Fig 11 should always be in terms of probability. It is possible that the 2013-2014 ILI data given the 2013-2014 ILI data up to epidemiological week 43 should have been assigned a lower probability based on previous seasons. In particular, based on previous ILI seasons it is not uncommon to see a much lower and later ILI peak given the ILI level at epidemiological week 43 for 2013-2014. For this reason, probabilistic forecasts are difficult for public health planners to rely on. However, without a forecast that predicts the dynamics of ILI faithfully week by week, planning can not be informed from the forecast.",

We notice that until the peak of the 2013-2014 influenza season, the data-assimilative forecasting scheme has a noticeably smaller M-distance than that of the straw man forecast. However, after the peak of the influenza season, during week 52 for 2013-2014, the straw man shows considerably smaller M-distance. The M-distances plotted for the straw man prediction use sample covariances and means calculated from 300 time series draws of the straw man forecast. Due to the lack of causal relations included in the straw man model this measure of accuracy is significantly lower in the early season for the straw man prediction. This figure shows that the data assimilation forecast has a noticeably smaller M-distance, and therefore is quantitatively better, than the straw man model for the early influenza season. Once the influenza season peaks the success of the forecast breaks down due to model error. It is interesting to note that due to the enKS data assimilation our S \u03bd EIR forecast seems to attempt self-correction, i.e. the M-distance is increasing and then decreases. This is due to the seasonal S \u03bd EIR's inability to taper off slowly from the peak of the flu season. After the peak, our model has exhausted its susceptible proportion of the population, and the infected proportion rapidly goes to zero. A possible point of confusion in this analysis is the sharp drop off of the M-distance as the end of our forecast horizon is approached. This is due to the decreased dimension of the data being forecasted. During week 17, the forecasts only need to predict the ILI data for 3 more weeks and distances in this 3-dimensional space grow much slower as a function of week-by-week error.",

This gives us Here we see that up to a month before the peak of ILI the use of a mathematical influenza model with data assimilation provides up to a 20% improvement in the forecast with a minimum of a 10% improvement. However, this improvement is quickly degraded due to model bias close to the peak.

It is important to clarify that, since we are adjusting the underlying parameterization and initialization of the S \u03bd EIR model and not the state of the model directly, the median and credible intervals for quantities such as the start week of the elevated ILI season continue to be adjusted even after they are observed. It is important to report these adjustments as they show how later observations effect the model's dynamics throughout the entire season. For example, we can observe that the enKS applied to the S \u03bd EIR model in the later ILI season tries to maintain an elevated ILI level by pushing the simulated peak forward in time. In practical application, the forecast of quantities such as the start week would be fixed once they were observed.",

A similar plot for the start week credible intervals forecast using the straw man model would show a constant distribution with median start week forecast at the 38 th epidemiological week. We can see for Fig 15 that the high probability region for start week, as forecast by our epidemiological model, is usually 1-2 weeks after the actual 2013-2014 start week. However, the actual start week is contained within the 90% credible region until a week or two after the peak of flu season. This region is also seen to constrict as ILI and Wikipedia observations are assimilated. week are plotted along with the median. Each week, as new ILI data become available the forecast is revised. This causes the uncertainty in our forecast to diminish. However, due to the model's inability to maintain an elevated ILI level past the peak, we see that late in the flu season, the model adjusts by pushing the start week later into the season. This causes an overestimation of the start week that worsens as the season progresses. In practice, once the start week has been observed the forecast would be fixed. However, adjustment of the model parameterization using the enKS would continue to affect the model simulation start date. We calculated similar time series of credible intervals for the forecast peak week (Fig 16) , and the magnitude of the ILI peak (Fig 17) . The forecast for the ILI peak was uncertain with the 90% credible interval having width of around 6% until close to the actual peak. However, the median forecast for the peak week was consistently within one or two weeks of the actual observed peak. These results suggest that our model and prior were calibrated to predict the timing of the start and peak of influenza season well but underestimate the size of the peak.",

The straw man's forecast does not assimilate current observations and thus its predicted start week is constant. Two things should be mentioned about calculating these credible intervals for the straw man forecast. First, since a sample from the straw man forecast has no week-to-week correlations, the weekly forecasts can vary greatly from week to week. This is a problem when computing the start week for the influenza season since a given straw man sample does not remain above 2% for consecutive weeks. Second, for similar reasons the duration cannot even be defined for one time series sample of the straw man forecast. The lack of correlations in week-by-week forecasts in the straw man model severely restricts its usefulness in influencing public health policy. For example, even after the 2013-2014 ILI data had been observed to decrease over the course of five weeks the straw man's median prediction was increasing. This makes it difficult to use to interpret the dynamics of influenza progression. On the other hand, even though the S \u03bd EIR model has significant errors in the forecast after the peak the trend of decreasing ILI is in agreement. ",

Though the flu forecasting system we have presented here is not ready to entirely base public health policy on, the methods provide a valuable framework. In particular, this framework provides real-time model testing, model dependent prior estimation, evaluation of probabilistic disease forecasting, and transitioning from a deterministic model to a probabilistic forecast. Moreover, if prior to the peak our model predicts an unexpected change in the future number of cases, then this is an indication to public health decision makers that the model may be picking up on hidden events and trends that are being missed by more traditional statistical prediction methods. In this regard, the model forecast is similar to having another expert viewpoint available during the decision process that can identify trends that might have otherwise been missed.",

We showed how the time series of forecast median and posterior credible intervals for the season's start week, peak week, duration, and peak level changed over time. This measure in particular demonstrated the advantages of having an underlying mechanistic model as compared to the purely statistical normal approximation forecast as used in the straw man forecast.",

However, it also highlights the need to use caution when adjusting the model to match data. If balances inherent in the model are not maintained during each adjustment step, it is possible to forecast data accurately with a model that is incorrect (e.g., one that has no single realization that will reproduce the data up to data error). The upside of this approach is that if only the model parameterization and initialization are adjusted, this type of forecasting process allows one to identify the assumptions of the model that diverge from observations. This is an important tool, to advance models to more accurate representations of reality, that could be ignored if data assimilation methods are used to adjust a model's state and parameterization throughout the forecast.",

More research needs to be done on the best way to adjust a model to observations while maintaining an accurate representation of disease model balances. Moreover, if the goal is to create forecasts for multiple seasons, forecasting from initial conditions will not always be viable. It remains an important open research question as to how far in the past one should optimally start forecasts from. The farther in the past a forecast is made from, the more dynamics of the model and data are assimilated. The downside of this is that considering too much of the models dynamics can impose unnecessary restrictions on the prior, leading to a divergent forecast.",

This divergence is evident in the optimal fitting done with our S \u03bd EIR model on historical ILI data. Since we did not know, before completing this work, which factors in disease forecasting would be most important, we have only added complexity in the model to account for some heterogeneity in the contact network of influenza spread and seasonally-varying transmissibility of influenza. Spatial spread of influenza does have a good data source that could be used in the future since ILI is collected in 10 different Health and Human Services regions for the United States. However, a disease model that links spatial spread in each of these regions would have significantly more parameters to determine in a prior distribution. Moreover, the level of ILI error between regions seems to be highly variable when observing historical ILI time series from different regions. The variability between regional ILI reporting methods poses a challenge beyond the scope of this first approach.",

Vaccination data are available but are not updated on a time scale fine enough to be comparable with weekly ILI. Moreover, vaccination rates would directly reduce the proportion of the population susceptible to influenza. Unfortunately, only sparse data are available on the actual proportion of the population susceptible to a given influenza strain. Thus, incorporation of vaccination rates into a forecast is not obvious until there exists a good method to directly determine the proportion of susceptibles in the United States.",

This belief was based on the fact that a single strain model, with the inclusion of variable transmission, has surprisingly flexible dynamics and thus may be able to fit ILI dynamics well even without biological correctness. Secondly, the introduction of multiple strains into a model adds many more parameters to the model, making it difficult to determine a prior distribution from historical data and increasing the problem of \"lack of determination\" in the model. However, there are regularly updated data on prevalence of specific strains provided by the WHO/NREVSS [6] and therefore, in retrospect, inclusion of multiple strains may be highly advantageous in the future. These data show that often there are one or two outbreaks of secondary dominant influenza strains in the late season. We hypothesize that these secondary strains are a primary cause of the heightened tail in the ILI data and we will investigate a multi-strain influenza model [56] in future forecasting work.",

It is important to note here that the access logs and historical ILI observations used as regressors do not exist on the same scale and therefore it is not correct to use these coefficients to infer importance of the various terms as predictors of ILI. This issue is further complicated by the fact that the individual Wikipedia access logs are not independent or uncorrelated with each other.",
