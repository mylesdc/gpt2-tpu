For example, reports can be on new disease, a rare disease, a new diagnostic tool or a new treatment. An interesting type of case report is that of an emerging infectious disease. By definition, an emerging infectious disease is a condition of outbreak or epidemic of an infection [4] . This can be a newly detected disease or the reemergence of an old disease. Emerging infectious disease is a condition that needs urgent management, and it is a public health focus.",

A good example is the first case report from Mexico on the influenza of 2009 or swine flu before the present pandemic [5] . This outbreak report brought global attention to the possible emergence of this new serious infection [5] . Later, the infection became a pandemic around the world. Hundreds of publications on swine flu were published following this first case report. Of interest, the first case report in each country is usually the starting point to draw attention from local physicians and medical scientists. For example, the first case report on swine flu by Grasselli et al. [6] promoted generalized awareness of swine flu in Italy. Another similar scenario is the report on the outbreak of bird flu, another problematic atypical infection [7] . This report was also published before the existence of the outbreak of bird flu in many Asian countries.",

However, if the case report is well reviewed and screened before publication, it can be reliable [8] . Nevertheless, although the case report is considered weak evidence in the medical literature, it is usually the first report when there is a new emerging infectious disease. A case report on an emerging infectious disease is a signal emerging from the background noise. It is not possible to perform good research on the new emerging infection at its first appearance, since no one completely knows the details of that infection. During the early period, the focus is usually on controlling the new disease.",

Hence, the data in case reports are useful information for planning corresponding to the emerging infection. The recommendation for treatment is usually set on the basis of the clinical information that can be derived from published case reports. A good example is the setting of the new severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) preparedness program based on the analysis of case reports on SARS [9] . However, having a case report peer-reviewed and published in a journal in the classical way might still take a long time. The present rapid online publication policy of the Journal of Medical Case Reports (JMCR) can help reduce delays in publication of interesting emerging infectious diseases. For example, JMCR has published an interesting first case report on an infection associated with the Panola Mountain Ehrlichia species [10] .",
