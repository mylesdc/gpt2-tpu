In spite of many reports about the cytotoxic and antitumor effects of some species of this genus, anticancer researches on one of the Iranian species S. litwinowii have not yet been conducted. The cytotoxic properties of total methanol extract of S. litwinowii and its fractions were investigated on different cancer cell lines including AGS, HeLa, MCF-7, PC12 and NIH 3T3. Meanwhile, the role of apoptosis in this toxicity was explored. The cells were cultured in DMEM medium and incubated with different concentrations of herb plant extracts. Cell viability was quantitated by MTT assay. Apoptotic cells were determined using propidium iodide staining of DNA fragmentation by flow cytometry (sub-G1 peak). Scutellaria litwinowii inhibited the growth of malignant cells in a dose-dependent manner. Among solvent fractions of S. litwinowii, the methylene chloride fraction was found to be more toxic compared to other fractions. The IC 50 values of this fraction against AGS, HeLa, MCF-7 and PC12 cell lines after 24 h were determined, 121.2 \u00b1 3.1, 40.9 \u00b1 2.5, 115.9 \u00b1 3.5 and 64.5 \u00b1 3.4 \u03bcg/ml, respectively. Scutellaria litwinowii induced a sub-G1 peak in the flow cytometry histogram of treated cells compared to control cells indicating that apoptotic cell death is involved in S. litwinowii toxicity. Scutellaria litwinowii exerts cytotoxic and proapototic effects in a variety of malignant cell lines and could be considered as a potential chemotherapeutic agent in cancer treatment.",

The fundamental strategy for separating these compounds is based on their chemophysical properties that can be cleverly exploited to initially separate them into various chemical groups. However, from the literature search of the related genera and families, it is possible to predict the types of compounds that might be present in a particular extract. This tentative prediction on possible identity of the classes of compounds may help choose suitable extraction and partitioning methods and solvents for extracting specific classes of compounds. Plant natural products are usually extracted with solvents of increasing polarity [19] . The larger the variety of compounds that are extracted by the extractant, the better the chance that biologically active components will also be extracted if a specific class of chemical component is not targeted [20] . In this study, the use of a solvent for screening and for the isolation of active components was examined.",

AGS cell line was isolated from an adenocarcinoma of the stomach resected from a 54year-old Caucasian female. In the USA, adenocarcinoma of the stomach is the seventh most common cause of cancer death [21] . HeLa cells are human epithelial cells from a fatal cervical carcinoma. The cell line was derived from cervical cancer cells taken from Henrietta Lacks, in 1951. It has been one of the most widely studied cell lines in cervical cancer, the second most frequent malignant tumor in women worldwide [22, 23] . MCF-7 is a human breast cancer cell line, which is known as a widely used model system for the study of breast cancer [24] .

DMEM and FCS were purchased from Gibco (Grand Island, USA). Voucher specimen was deposited in herbarium of faculty of pharmacy, University of Mashhad Medical Sciences. Dry powdered roots (100 g) of S. litwinowii were extracted with methanol (4 \u00d7 0.5 l) and were then concentrated at 50 \u2022 C under reduced pressure to dryness. The concentrated extract was then extracted with an equal volume of n-hexane, three times, to give a fraction containing non-polar compounds, such as lipids. The process is referred to as defatting. Then the solution was successively partitioned between CH2Cl2, ethylacetate (EtOAc) and n-butanol (n-BuOH) and finally water. The isolated fractions were also dried. A partitioning scheme of the methanol extract of S. litwinowii is presented in Figure 1 [19] .",

            "text": "In the present study, S. litwinowii-induced apoptosis was also shown to be involved in the induction of cell death in the HeLa cell line (Figure 7 ). Apoptotic cell death is known to be induced by many chemotherapeutic agents routinely used in cancer treatment regimens. Apoptosis is characterized by distinct morphological features including, chromatin condensation, cell and nuclear shrinkage, membrane blebbing and oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation. Apoptosis is an important homeostatic mechanism that balances cell division and cell death and maintains the appropriate number of cell in the body. In the present study, apoptosis was determined using PI staining of DNA fragmentation by flow cytometry (sub-G1 peak). It has been reported that DNA fragmentation creates small fragments of DNA that can be eluted following incubation in a hypotonic phosphate-citrate buffer. When stained with a quantitative DNA-binding dye such as PI, cells that have lost DNA will take up less stain and will appear to the left of the G1 peak [27, 28] . A balance between cell proliferation and apoptosis controls normal organ development [36] [37] [38] . The induction of apoptosis in tumor cells is considered a valuable way to treat cancer [39] . A wide variety of natural substances have been recognized to have the ability to induce apoptosis in various tumor cells. It is thus considered important to screen apoptotic inducers from plants, either in the form of crude extracts or as components isolated from them [6] . In this study baicalein could inhibit the proliferation of HeLa cells. Baicalein is a flavone isolated from the plant Scutellariae radix, which is commonly used as a dietary supplement in Asian countries. This flavonoid has modulating effects on drug metabolizing enzymes and antiproliferative effects on cancer cells [40] .",
