The recently discovered open reading frame 5 (ORF5) in PCV2 genome encodes a non-structural protein. Previous study revealed that ORF5 protein inhibits cell proliferation and may interact with host transmembrane glycoprotein NMB (GPNMB). However, whether the GPNMB affects PCV2 replication and the underlying molecular mechanisms are still unknown. In this study, the transcriptome maps of PCV2-infected and ORF5-transfected porcine alveolar macrophages 3D4/2 (PAM) cells were profiled. The GPNMB gene was down-regulated in PCV2-infected and ORF5-transfected PAMs. By using glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down, coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) and confocal microscopy approaches, we convincingly showed that PCV2 ORF5 protein interacts with GPNMB. Furthermore, by utilizing lentivirus mediated overexpression or knockdown approach, we showed that the cellular GPNMB significantly inhibits PCV2 replication and ORF5 expression. Moreover, GPNMB overexpressing leads to an increased Cyclin A expression and a reduced S phase, whereas GPNMB knockdown causes a decreased Cyclin A expression and a prolonged S phase. In conclusion, we identified a novel host factor GPNMB that interacts with PCV2 ORF5 protein and restricts PCV2 replication.",

GPNMB is a type I transmembrane protein containing an N-terminal signal peptide, an integrin-binding (RGD) motif and a polycystic kidney disease (PKD) domain in extracellular domain (ECD), a single pass transmembrane domain and a 53 amino acid (AA) cytoplasmic tail (Selim, 2009; Singh et al., 2010) . Previous studies have showed the GPNMB is involved in various physiological and pathological processes, including immune system activation, cell proliferation, angiogenesis, tissue-repair, especially the invasion and metastasis of malignant tumors (Rose et al., 2010; Oyewumi et al., 2016) . Emerging studies have generated a more complex picture regarding the expression of GPNMB in various cancer progression, including lung cancer, ovarian cancer, stomach cancer and breast cancer (Singh et al., 2010; Zhou et al., 2012; Maric et al., 2013) .",

Total RNA was isolated from PAMs (control), pEGFP-ORF5 transfected and PCV2 infected PAMs using Trizol (TAKARA, China) following the manufacturer's instruction. The RNA samples were submitted to Gene Denovo Co. (Guangzhou, China) for high-throughput sequence (each group was triplicate) and the analysis of the data was also conducted by this company. The RNA samples were assessed for integrity, quality and quantity. 5 \u00b5g mRNA was purified from total RNA, adsorbed to oligo (dT) magnetic beads and converted to cDNA used for PCR following size selection by agarose gel electrophoresis (AGE). The obtained RNA was fragmented and subjected to reverse transcription by the random N6 primer. Next, double-stranded DNA was synthesized from the cDNA. Then fill-in and phosphorylate the synthesized doublestranded DNA at the 5' end. The 3' end forms a sticky end and then ligate with an adapter that have a bubbling T shape at the 3' end. The ligation product is PCR amplified by specific primers. The PCR product is heat-denatured into a single strand, and a single-stranded DNA is cyclized with a bridge primer to obtain a single-stranded circular DNA library. The Illumina sequencing was conducted with Illumina Cluster Station and Illumina HiSeq 2000 System. Q20 and Q30 were used to assess the accuracy of base sequences. The software SOAPnuke was used to evaluate the quality of sequencing reads 2 (Cock et al., 2010) . The raw sequencing data were filtered as follows: (i) remove the reads with adapter sequences. (ii) remove the reads with ambiguous bases (N) > 5%. (iii) remove reads with low quality (defined as reads with > 20% of the bases with quality scores < 10).",

As shown in Figures 6A,B , the highest knockdown efficiency was noticed in the shGPNMB-3 cells and thus this was used in following study. The shN and shGPNMB-3 cells were infected with PCV2 at a MOI of 0.1. At 24 and 48 h post-infection, the PCV2 viral mRNA and ORF5 RNA were significantly increased, compared with that in the control (Figures 6C,D) . These results indicated that the PCV2 replication level was higher in GPNMB deficient cells.

In our previous study, we have revealed that PCV2 ORF5 protein down-regulate Cyclin A expression and this was also confirmed in the present study (Figures 7A,B ) (Lv et al., 2015) . However, whether the GPNMB could regulate Cyclin A expression was still unknown. To explore this, we measured the Cyclin A level in GPNMB overexpression or knockdown cells. As shown in Figures 7C-E , overexpression of GPNMB significantly boosted Cyclin A expression. Cyclin A controls G1/S, S/G2, and G2/M phase cell cycle transitions, which are critical for initiation and progression of DNA synthesis (Yam et al., 2002) . Thus, we measured the cell cycle in GPNMBoverexpressed cells. As shown in Figure 7F , the proportion of GPNMB-overexpressed cells found to be in S-phase was 4.12%, whereas which for control cells were 14.59% or 12.47%, respectively. The results suggested that the overexpression of GPNMB could trigger a less proportion of cells to enter S-phase. To further confirm that GPNMB regulates Cyclin A expression, we also tested Cyclin A expression in GPNMB knockdown cells. As shown in Figures 8A-C , downregulation of GPNMB significantly inhibited Cyclin A expression. Consistently, knockdown of GPNMB lead to more cells to enter S-phase ( Figure 8D) . These results demonstrated that GPNMB positively regulates Cyclin A expression. Together with the observation that GPNMB inhibits PCV2 replication (Figures 4-6) and Cyclin A overexpression suppresses PCV2 replication (Tang et al., 2013) , our finding implies that GPNMB inhibits PCV2 infection may through the up-regulation of Cyclin A.",

Increasing studies have shown that PCV2 subverts host cellular signals and pathways to benefit its replication. Previous study has revealed that PCV2 ORF3 protein can facilitate the proteasomal degradation of regulator of G protein signaling 16 (RGS16) to promote IL-6 and IL-8 secretion (Choi et al., 2015) . Moreover, ORF3 protein also has been reported competes with p53 in binding to Pirh2 and mediates the deregulation of p53 homeostasis (Karuppannan et al., 2010) . Additionally, PCV2 ORF4 has been found for stabilizing the concentration of ferritin heavy chain (FHC) to antagonizes host cell apoptosis (Lv et al., 2016) . However, whether PCV2 ORF5 is involved in these responses was still unknown. In the present study, the high-throughput sequencing was conducted and the functional classification and pathway enrichment analysis of DEGs were performed to elucidate this enigma. DEGs libraries analysis provided data regarding transcriptomic changes in PAM cells transfected with ORF5 or infected with PCV2. We found more genes were changed in the ORF5-transfected cell compared with PCV2 infected cells. This could be explained by the fact that the transfection efficiency is higher that PCV infection.",

In this study, the transcription analysis of cellular response to PCV2 infection and ORF5-transfection in PAM cells also revealed that the GPNMB expression was affected by PCV2 infection (Supplementary Tables S2,  S3 ). Next, we experimentally proved that PCV2 infection and ORF5 transfection down-regulates GPNMB expression (Figure 2) . This is consistent with the transcription analysis done by other group, which also showed that the GPNMB mRNA level was down-regulated after PCV2 infection . The GPNMB was an ORF5-interacting host factor as identified by yeast two-hybrid assay. In this study, we employed diffident approach to validate the interaction between ORF5 and GPNMB. GST-pulldown assay demonstrated that GPNMB can bind to ORF5 protein ( Figure 3A) . The isolation of Flag-GPNMB/pEGFP-ORF5 or Flag-ORF5/GPNMB complexes suggested that GPNMB could bind to ORF5 in vitro (Figures 3C,D) . Furthermore, confocal microscopy confirmed the co-localization of GPNMB and ORF5 protein, confirming the interaction between GPNMB and ORF5 ( Figure 3B) .

PCV2 replication is both S-and G2/M-phase dependent, PCV2 infection induces cellular S phase accumulation via the suppression of Cyclin A (Tang et al., 2013) . In addition to the finding that the GPNMB interacted with PCV2 ORF5 and restricted PCV2 replication, we surprisingly find that GPNMB enhanced Cyclin A expression and triggered a less proportion of cells to enter S-phase (Figures 7,8) .

Thus, it reasonable to speculate that the GPNMB inhibits PCV2 infection through the up-regulation of Cyclin A. However, the molecular mechanism still needs further investigations.

Further studies confirmed that PCV2 and ORF5 decreased GPNMB expression and there was direct interaction between ORF5 and GPNMB. In addition, we also revealed that GPNMB restricts PCV2 replication, regulates Cyclin A expression and leads to a less proportion of cells enter S-phase. This study identified a novel host factor GPNMB that interacts with PCV2 ORF5 protein and restricts PCV2 replication and may provide insights into the PCV2-host interaction.",
