            "text": "I nitially identified in a rhesus monkey from Uganda's Zika forest in 1947 and subsequently isolated from humans in 1968 in Nigeria, 1 Zika virus (ZIKV) is a flavivirus transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, the same vector transmitting other arboviruses of public health impact such as yellow fever virus, dengue virus (DENV) and chikungunya virus (CHIKV). 2 The first known ZIKV outbreak occurred in 2007 in Yap state of the Federated States of Micronesia 1 in the World Health Organization (WHO) Western Pacific Region followed by a 2013-2014 outbreak in French Polynesia with an estimated 32 000 cases. 3 The virus has gone on to cause outbreaks in multiple Pacific island countries and has spread throughout the Americas. 1 In November 2015, Brazil began reporting substantial increases in the number of children born with microcephaly in ZIKV-affected areas. 4 That evidence, coupled with reports of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome cases in other ZIKV outbreaks, particularly in French Polynesia, led WHO on 1 February 2016 to declare that the cluster of microcephaly cases and other neurological disorders constituted a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC). 5 Among the recommendations from that meeting of the International Health Regulations (2005) Emergency Committee were that \"surveillance for ZIKV infection should be enhanced, with the dissemination of standard case definitions and diagnostics to at-risk areas\". 6 Laboratory testing is a critical component of surveillance for ZIKV infection due to co-circulation of DENV and CHIKV that cause similar symptoms. 7,8 To determine regional capacity for ZIKV detection, the WHO Regional Office for the Western Pacific initiated a voluntary, rapid survey among national-level public health laboratories in its countries and areas (areas are non-sovereign jurisdictions within a WHO region; 9 countries and areas are together referred to as \"countries\" in this article). The survey sought to assess preparedness for ZIKV testing in the context of co-circulating DENV and CHIKV. Questions primarily addressed in-country capacity for molecular and serological detection of the three arboviruses, additional laboratory capacities specific for ZIKV and testing-related services to other countries.",

The algorithm followed for differential diagnosis should take into consideration the endemic circulation of DENV, CHIKV and ZIKV. 8 Among 15 countries detailing their algorithm, 9 (60%) indicated they tested suspected samples for all three arboviruses concurrently, similar to the algorithm recommended by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; 7 5/15 (33.3%) attempted to rule out each virus sequentially as outlined in the WHO Regional Office basic laboratory capacity known to rely on specimen referral). The survey was completed by 23 laboratories in 18 countries. For the country not responding, information from other sources such as recent peerreviewed publications was used where possible to augment the data set and cover all 19 countries. Of the remaining three, two were using specimen referral to neighbouring countries (similar to Pacific island countries without PCR capacity), while the other has been working closely with the WHO Regional Office for the Western Pacific to obtain materials and reagents to enable in-country testing. Of the 16 countries with PCR test capacity for ZIKV, 14 could additionally sequence the virus and isolate it in culture.
