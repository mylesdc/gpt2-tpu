            "text": "Hospital isolation rooms are vital for the containment (when under negative pressure) of patients with, or the protection (when under positive pressure) of patients, from airborne infectious agents. Such facilities were essential for the management of highly contagious patients during the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreaks and the more recent 2009 A/H1N1 influenza pandemic. Many different types of door designs are used in the construction of such isolation rooms, which may be related to the space available and affordability. Using colored food dye as a tracer, the qualitative effects of door-opening motions on the dissemination of potentially contaminated air into and out of a single isolation room were visualized and filmed using Reynolds-number-equivalent, small-scale, water-tank models fitted with programmable door-opening and moving human figure motions. Careful scaling considerations involved in the design and construction of these water-tank models enabled these results to be accurately extrapolated to the full-scale situation. Four simple types of door design were tested: variable speed single and double, sliding and hinged doors, in combination with the moving human figure. The resulting video footage was edited, synchronized and presented in a series of split-screen formats. From these experiments, it is clear that double-hinged doors pose the greatest risk of leakage into or out of the room, followed by (in order of decreasing risk) single-hinged, double-sliding and single-sliding doors. The relative effect of the moving human figure on spreading any potential contamination was greatest with the sliding doors, as the bulk airflows induced were large relative to those resulting from these door-opening motions. However, with the hinged doors, the airflows induced by these door-opening motions were significantly greater. Further experiments involving a simulated ventilated environment are required, but from these findings alone, it appears that sliding-doors are far more effective for hospital isolation room containment.",

Once the seal was in place, the tank was slowly filled with water from the bottom up via a supply pipe entering the floor of the tank. This facilitated the removal of air bubbles from the tank, as it filled, which would otherwise obstruct clear views of the tank from the top that were required for filming. The tank was also placed on a custom-built table which allows a tilt of up to 45u when the tank was full, to allow any air bubbles to escape through small drainage air-holes that were drilled into the roof along its edge. Any remaining bubbles were manually suctioned using a 30 ml or 50 ml syringe and small-bore catheter that was passed through these air-holes, as required. Once the bubbles had been removed and the tank leveled again, 50 mls of blue food dye (True Blue, Star Brand, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia) was injected into one side of the tank, as required by the experimental protocol, i.e. into the side containing the human figure (the 'from dye' protocol), or into the side without the figure (the 'to dye' protocol).

For the hinged-doors, both slow (Table 1 , Videos S3-S4) and fast (Table 2, Figures 5 and 6) angular velocities were investigated. This was done because the effect of these door-opening motions on the movements of the food dye were much more dramatic and it was of interest to capture these flows at these two speeds, with the fast parameters being approximately twice those of the slow parameters.

This may possibly be due to the space requirements and the practicalities of higher installation (sliding doors may be more expensive to make and install) and maintenance costs (there are more moving parts in a slidingcompared to a hinged-door).

The results showed that the concentration of the tracer gas decreased dramatically, as measured by a 'dilution factor' that was defined by the authors, ranging from 122-211 (5 minutes after gas release) between the isolation room and the anteroom, and 1260-3670 (10 minutes after gas release) between the isolation room and the outside corridor [19] . However, the types of doors used for the isolation and anterooms (i.e. hinged or sliding) were not described, though it was probably a hinged door design.

[23] described a clinical situation where a severe case of adult chickenpox (i.e. primary varicella zoster virus, VZV, infection) managed in a negative pressure isolation room (with no anteroom) caused an infection of a VZV-susceptible nurse whose only contact with the patient was when he stood outside the room for at least 2 minutes, several times a day, handing supplies to the VZV-immune nurse inside the room that was directly caring for the patient. The access to the isolation room was a standard single hinged-door that opened into the room. The non-immune nurse developed chickenpox 10 days later. Transmission of the same virus between the patient and the nurse was confirmed by viral sequencing of skin lesion samples taken from both individuals. The negative pressure difference across the doorway was measured to be only 3 Pa and it was postulated that this was readily reversed each time the door was opened to receive the supplies. This may have been a fairly typical pressure differential found in many hospital isolation units at this time, and it is clear from this incident that this was probably insufficient to maintain the containment during a door-opening motion event. Additional qualitative flow visualization studies were performed using food dye in a smallscale, water-tank model under the principle of Reynolds number equivalence, to exam the action of the hinged-door opening motion on the airflow across the doorway. These additional experiments confirmed that the hinged-door opening motion into the isolation room was likely to have caused a transient reversal of the negative pressure, allowing airborne virus to leak out and be inhaled and infect the non-immune nurse standing outside. However, the water-tank model developed for this study (with a hand-operated hinged-door) was relatively simple and crude, and this study extends this model and tests double and sliding-door options, also.",

Eames et al.

In addition, with the moving manikin, when entering or leaving an isolation room there is clearly either a backwash or an entrained drag wake flow into this outer area, arising from the passage of a person into or out of the room, respectively. Both of these sources of contamination argue for the use of an anteroom area adjacent to the isolation room, in which the air should be completely exchanged (and filtered) before allowing an exit into the corridor. However, it is acknowledged that other more economical and space limitation factors may also influence the availability of anterooms with isolation units in individual hospitals or healthcare facilities.",

Where a contact plate is required for opening such sliding doors (particularly those leading into dedicated isolation units), these are often 'foot' plates at floor level that are operated by a person's foot pressure, or no-touch sensor plates at higher positions that just require the hand to be passed over them, without any contact with them at all. In short, the way that sliding doors are installed often preclude the need to touch these door surfaces at all, which is another advantage of these style of doors, particularly in areas where the isolation of potentially infectious (or especially vulnerable) patients is of prime clinical importance.",

Relatively little leakage occurs across the doorway when the doors open. Significantly more food dye moves across the doorway when the manikin moves into or out of the room, as described above. hinged-door-opening motion induces a much larger exchange of food dye across the doorway in both directions than the sliding door equivalent.

The series of 4 snapshots with each door-opening, manikin movement scenario were taken with respect to the following events, rather than at specific times: food dye movement due to door-opening motions alone then with any initial manikin movement -manikin interaction and any entrainment food dye -final food dye movements once the manikin had come to rest at its destination position.
