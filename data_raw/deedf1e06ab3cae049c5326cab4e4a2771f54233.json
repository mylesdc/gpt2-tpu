Each infected individual follows a stochastic SEIR model with all time periods following Gamma distributions, the time unit being 1 day. The latent period E is assumed to be \u0393(2, 1/5) (mean = 10, sd = 7.1) and the infectious period \u0393(1, 1/5) (mean = 5, sd = 5). After the infectious period, the individual may either recover, with probability 30%, or die, with probability 70%. The time until recovery is assumed to be \u0393(4, 1/3) (mean = 12, sd = 6) and the time to death \u0393(4/9, 1/9) (mean = 4, sd = 6). Furthermore, each individual has an incubation period (time until symptoms) which is assumed to be similar to the latent period, but with some variation. The incubation period is given by E times a uniformly distributed variable in the interval [0.8, 1.2] . It is assumed that a case is reported when symptoms arise. Finally, during the infectious period, new cases are produced with rate 0.34/day, resulting in R 0 = 0.34 \u00b7 5 = 1.7.",

Furthermore, the largest part of variability is in the first part of the epidemic. If one divides the time period in a first part until the first 100 (cumulative) cases are reached and a second part until level 4500 is reached, one finds that the first part has average length 102 days with sd = 28 and the 95% central range [63, 174] and that the second part has mean 98 days, sd = 10 and 95% range [83, 119].",

It should be noted that the total number of infected is not realistically observable, but of interest to estimate. It should also be noted that all numbers above are examples of delayed observations, from infection to notification and from notification to final destiny. One should therefore expect that the ratios should stabilize around values given by the formula (8) in Section 6 of the main paper. The ratio notified/infected was, on average, 0.70 with 95% of values between 0.68 and 0.72, essentially identical to the theoretical prediction based on \"knowing\" the incubation time distribution, which was assumed to also be the time from infection to notification. The narrow range of the observed ratios indicates that this is a viable method to predict the true actual size of the outbreak from the number of notified cases, given that good estimates of the distribution of time to notification and exponential increase rate are available. An analogous result holds for the ratios of infected to dead or recovered individuals. With the specific parameters of the simulations, at 4500 notifications, on average 3350 of them had either recovered or died, and the remaining 1150 remained between notification and final destiny. At the time of 4500 notifications, an average of 1900 additional individuals had been infected but not yet notified.",

The times and intervals were ascertained \"backwards\", i.e. the infector of the chosen individual was identified and time distance between the respective infection or symptom times was recorded. The distributions of sample means are reasonably concentrated around the respective central values, 12.5 for serial intervals and 12.6 for generation times. It should be remembered that theory predicts that both should have the same expected value which should be less than the true expected generation time, which is 15. Theory again predicts that the backward generation time should have mean 12.57, which is not far from what is observed. The variance of the true generation time is 75 (sd = 8.7) and both variance estimates from the simulation samples tend to be much less, somewhat above 50 (sd = 7.1). This also leads to the useful conclusion that serial intervals are affected by the same \"contraction\" as generation times when ascertained \"backwards\", at least in the chosen parameter setting.",

            "text": "Predicting the size of the outbreak at a later time Finally, we study the performance of the renewal equation (Section 2, Eq. (5), main paper) approach proposed in [1] . This approach is intended to allow estimation of R t (in our simulation, R t is kept constant = R 0 all the time and the method is adapted accordingly) and to further allow prediction of cases 6 weeks (42 days) after the last observed datum. The results, using probabilities derived from observing backward serial intervals, thus biased with respect to the true generation time distribution, indicate that this method seriously underestimates R 0 but has good predictive power anyway. The 95% range of the ratio predicted/true values at 6 weeks after the level 4500 notified has been reached is [\u221210%, +12%], which is slightly better than just using a growth rate based estimate (i.e. just multiplying with exp(42r), using some good estimate of the growth rate r) derived from the first 4500 cases. This is perhaps natural, since the method amounts to an adaptive regression method which has fitted all the observed data up to level 4500 as well as possible, and then extrapolated this fit. As predicted by theory, the estimate of R 0 that results from this method underestimates the true value, in fact the true value 1.7 is never reached in 1000 simulations. The average estimate of R 0 is 1.57, with 95% range [1.51, 1.63], compared to the true value 1.7, thus having an average bias of \u22128%.",

It is then evident that independence of s 0 and g * (or i 0 , depending on how g * is constructed) implies equality of the distributions of G and S. The (theoretical) question remains, however, if this condition is also necessary. If it is not, a presumably weaker sufficient condition would suffice. In the abstract, the question can be answered: it is possible to have three random variables (A, B, C) (representing respectively s 0 , s 1 and g * ) such that A is independent of B and B is independent of C and the distributions of A+C and B+C are the same, but A and C are not independent.

Since the simulation model assumes independence between latent period 0 and the infectious period, upon which g * depends and that s 0 = u 0 , where u \u223c Uniform[0.8, 1.2], the difference between V ar(S) and V ar(G) can be written as 2(Cov(u 0 , 0 ) \u2212 V ar(u 0 )). Since E(u) = 1, this reduces to 2E( 2 0 )(1 \u2212 E(u 2 )). Since E( 2 0 ) = 150 and E(u 2 ) = 1.0133, we should have V ar(S) \u2212 V ar(G) = 3.99. Furthermore, in the model we have G \u223c \u0393(3, 1/5) and thus V ar(G) = 75. In the simulation results, we find the estimates V ar(G) \u2248 52.4 and V ar(S) \u2248 54.6.

It thus appears that the \"backward\" observation shortening also affects the observed serial intervals and the difference between observed generation time and serial interval distributions. In this case, in order to theoretically predict the observed difference in variances, one would have to calculate the effect of \"backward\" observation of a generation time on the marginal distribution of the corresponding latent and incubation periods.",

There are several possible methods but, unfortunately, it seems difficult to evaluate them theoretically on finite samples. We now concentrate on estimating the growth rate directly from case data. However, there seems to be a lack of systematic evaluations adapted to infectious disease spread data. A sensible approach is then to simulate the performance of the chosen estimation method in simulations as close as possible to the data generating situation. We have therefore evaluated various data-based methods in our simulation model. The compared methods are: a) linear regression on logarithms of cumulative numbers of notified cases, b) linear regression on logarithms of daily numbers of notified cases, c) taking the mean of daily ratios of successive cumulative numbers, d) estimating exp(r), the daily multiplication factor, with a branching process type estimator of the form (n(2) + . . . . + n(K))/(n(1) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + n(K \u2212 1)), where n(i) is the number of cases notified day i, and reporting the logarithm, e) fitting the discretized renewal equation described in Section 2 of the main paper to observed incidence data, using the generation time distribution estimated from backward times.
