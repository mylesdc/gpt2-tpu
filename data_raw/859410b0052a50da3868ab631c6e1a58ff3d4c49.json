A series of global health crises have emerged since 2000, ranging from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and its phylogenetic cousin Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), to pandemic Influenza A (H1N1), Ebola, and the ongoing Zika virus epidemic. The Ebola epidemic gave rise to four global commissions proposing a bold new agenda for global health preparedness and response for future infectious disease threats [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . In response to critiques of WHO's performance during the Ebola crisis, the World Health Assembly (WHA) approved an Advisory Group on Reform of WHO's Work in Outbreaks and Emergencies, which reported in January 2016. The WHA also approved a Review Committee on the International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR), due to report in May [8] .",

Most states, however, missed the initial 2012 reporting requirement for meeting IHR core capacities and, in 2014, WHO extended the deadline to 2016 for all 81 states that requested extensions. Of the 193 states required to report, only 64 states reported meeting core capacities, representing a compliance rate of just over 30%, while 48 failed to even respond [10] . This low level of compliance for meeting minimum core capacity standards may be an overestimate because self-assessments are unreliable without independent validation. Table 1 highlights the commissions' recommendations to develop and assess core capacities. The WHO took an important step in February 2016, developing a Joint External Evaluation Tool to evaluate IHR capacities every 5 years, with national and international subject experts reviewing self-reported data, followed by a country visit and in-depth discussions. Each country's assessment will be made public, with a color-coding scheme to delineate implementation levels for each capacity [11] . Until governments achieve a high degree of compliance with IHR obligations, however, WHO should plan more frequent external assessments, rather than waiting 5 years between assessments. Participation of stakeholders in the community should also be a critical component of assessments.",

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) could encourage countries to participate in ongoing evaluations by incorporating pandemic preparedness into its evaluation of macroeconomic stability [4] . IMF assessments offer a powerful inducement given their influence over countries' access to capital. Similarly, the World Bank's Pandemic Emergency Facility-along with regional development banks-could condition disbursements based on governments meeting IHR obligations.",

GHSA, with >$1 billion in funding, has developed \"Action Packages,\" where priority technical areas are identified, with each encompassing a target and action items, along with baseline assessment, planning, and monitoring activities, and capabilities evaluated through a peer assessment process [13] . GHSA, however, formally stands outside the IHR framework, thus lacking the international legitimacy of a WHO-led process. The minimum core capacities set out by the IHR on their own are insufficient to respond to public health threats and emergencies, however, as highlighted by the commissions' recommendations in Table 3 . Effective primary care and public health systems that underpin inclusive, high-quality universal health coverage (UHC) are also required to manage outbreaks and meet a broad range of health needs to ensure the right to health. Fast-spreading novel infections are diverse, demanding resilient health systems. As outbreaks stretch existing resources, resilient systems that are designed to ensure surge capacity in health emergencies are needed.",

This analysis should look beyond traditional government ministry partners to include private sector actors, civil society organizations, and faith-based groups. WHO should review the appropriate partners for coleadership of Health Clusters at the national level and work with partners to build a dedicated capacity for coordination, planning, information management, and communications. WHO should integrate the capacities of its Health Cluster partners in its emergency preparedness and planning. (Rec. 4)Reform of WHO Operations & GovernanceWHO must urgently develop new business processes governing procurement and logistics, as well as the rapid deployment of human and financial resources, during outbreaks and emergencies. These processes should be tailored to support the Programme for Outbreaks and Emergencies and should not be the same as those used for WHO's ordinary business operations. Benchmarks should be established to assess whether these new processes are timely and effectively implemented. (Rec. 5)Increase Member State Assessed ContributionsWHO should make a clear distinction between the resources necessary to support the baseline capacity of the Programme for Outbreaks and Emergencies and funding needed to support specific emergency operations. Predictable and reliable financing streams, including assessed contributions from member states, should fund the baseline capacity of the Programme. Member states must be willing to provide the resources for the Programme to",

The commissions placed a premium on scientifically and ethically rigorous trial designs and research participants' rights.Research requires sharing biological materials, but governments sometimes delay. Concerned about affordable access to the fruits of research, states have claimed sovereignty over viruses under the 2010 Nagoya Protocol to the Convention on Biological Diversity. The Pandemic Influenza Preparedness (PIP) Framework-negotiated by WHO-requires states to share biological materials and pharmaceutical companies to provide reciprocal benefits, such as a share of the resulting drugs or vaccines. The PIP Framework, however, applies only to pandemic influenza and not to other novel pathogens.
