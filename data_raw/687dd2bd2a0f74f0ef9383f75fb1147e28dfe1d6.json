The prevalence of specific anti-VP2 IgG antibodies against HBoV1-4 was determined in different age groups of healthy individuals aged 0-70 years old in Beijing, China, using a competition ELISA assay based on virus-like particles of HBoV1-4. The seroprevalence of HBoV1-4 was 50%, 36.9%, 28.7%, and 0.8%, respectively, in children aged 0-14 years (n = 244); whereas the seroprevalence of HBoV1-4 was 66.9%, 49.3%, 38.7% and 1.4%, respectively, in healthy adults ($15 years old; n = 142). The seropositive rate of HBoV1 was higher than that of HBoV2, HBoV3, and HBoV4 in individuals older than 0.5 years. Furthermore, IgG seroconversion of HBoV1 (10/31, 32.3%), HBoV2 (8/31, 25.8%), and HBoV3 (2/31, 6.5%) was found in paired sera collected from children with respiratory tract infections who were positive for HBoV1 according to PCR analysis.",

Based on phylogenetic analysis of viral genomes, four species of HBoVs (HBoV1-4) have been identified [1, [7] [8] [9] . HBoV1 is associated with respiratory tract diseases [1, 2, [12] [13] [14] . HBoV2 and 3 have been detected in the respiratory tract, but are associated mainly with stool samples [8] [9] [10] [11] 15, 16] . HBoV4 has been detected in enteric infections [9] . However, as HBoVs are frequently co-detected with other viral infections in patients with respiratory or enteric infections, the exact roles of HBoVs in pathogenicity are unclear.",

The genome consists of four open reading frames (ORFs), encoding two nonstructural proteins (NS1 and NP1) and two overlapping capsid proteins (VP1 and VP2) [1] . The lack of a well-established cell culture system or animal model to propagate HBoVs has hampered understanding of the infection and pathogenicity of HBoVs. Studies have shown that the VP2 protein harbors the major antigen of HBoV and can form the empty virus-like particles (VLPs) which mimic HBoV virions morphologically and antigenically. The VP2 VLPs have been successfully used as antigens for detecting antibodies against HBoVs [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] .",

The seroprevalence data also allow a comparison between the frequency of natural infection and the frequency of this virus in individuals with infections [30] . However, previous seroepidemiological studies of HBoVs have mainly focused on HBoV1. HBoV1 specific IgG antibodies were frequently detected in children, with a seropositive rate ranging from 40.7%-60% for children , four years old and up to .85% for those $ four years old [19] . The seropositive rate of HBoV1 VP2-specific IgG antibodies is about 94% in healthy adults [18] . However, Kantola et al. recently showed cross-reactivity between the VP2 VLPs of HBoV1-4, which can largely affect the seropositive data of HBoV species. They showed that after depletion of cross-reactive antibodies, the approximate seroprevalences of HBoV1-4 in adults were 59%, 34%, 15%, and 2%, respectively [22] . However, the samples used in that study were only collected from healthy young people with a narrow range of age, including 115 subjects aged 21-32 years from Finland and 80 subjects aged 18-20 years from Pakistan. Given that the prevalence of a virus infection may vary by age as well as geographically, there remains to be a need to estimate the seroprevalence of HBoVs based on the detection of antibodies against HBoV1-4 from data of a more complete age range and from other global, geographic regions.",

Only the samples that were negative for HBoV1, 2, 3, and 4 VLPs simultaneously were selected as the negative samples. The negativity of those samples was confirmed using a competition ELISA (cELISA) assay, in which the absorbance value at 450 nm did not change significantly with or without competition assays ( Figure 3 ). Serum samples identified by cELISA as positive for individual HBoV species were obtained from 3 children and 4 adults and used as positive controls. However, we did not obtain a serum sample that was positive only for HBoV4 based on the assay; we used a sample from an adult that was IgG positive for HBoV1, HBoV2 and HBoV4. To determine the concentration of VLPs required for exhaustive antibody competition of HBoV1-4, the serum samples were monocompeted with concentrations of HBoV1, 2, 3, or 4 VLPs ranging from 0-32 mg/mL ( Figure 3 ).

The seropositive rates of IgG antibodies against HBoV2, 3 and 4 were lower than that of HBoV1 in individuals of $0.5 years old. These data indicate that HBoV1 is the predominant circulating species of HBoV in Beijing, whereas HBoV2-4 do not seem to have a major impact on HBoV infections. This finding agrees with reports on HBoVs prevalence obtained from most parts of the world using DNA analysis [10, 14, 16] . Of note, our finding that the seroprevalence of HBoV4 is much lower than that of HBoV1-3 is consistent with the rare detection of HBoV4 DNA in clinical samples [9] . Overall, the seroprevalence of HBoVs indicated by results of the cELISA decreased less in children than in adults in comparison to the results without competition, indicating that HBoV infections are more specific in children, especially for HBoV1 [22] . These results suggest that HBoV species may play differential roles in disease.",

We found that the HBoV1-specific seroprevalence was higher in convalescent sera than in acute sera. However, heterotypic seroconversion against HBoV2 and HBoV3 was also observed. Moreover, for some patients who were positive for HBoV1 and HBoV2 IgG at the acute phase, the absorbance value was higher in convalescent sera. These data may suggest the concurrent production of antibodies against HBoV2 and 3 during the infection of HBoV1, as it has been shown that B-cell memory can be boosted either by the homologous virus or by heterologous, yet immunological related virus [20, 34, 35] .",

The IgG cut-off values of HBoV1 (0.344), HBoV2 (0.304), HBoV3 (0.321) and HBoV4 (0.31) are shown for reference. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0039644.g004",
