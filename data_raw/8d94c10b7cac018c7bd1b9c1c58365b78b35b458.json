            "text": "Background: Advances in molecular laboratory techniques are changing the prospects for the diagnosis of viral infectious diseases. Multiplex polymerase chain reaction assay (multiplex-PCR) can detect dozens of pathogens simultaneously, greatly reducing turnaround time (TAT) and improving detection sensitivity. But as a double-edged sword, due to the high sensitivity of PCR, the type of respiratory specimens is critical to diagnosis. In this work, we performed a head-to-head comparison to evaluate the multiplex-PCR yields between two samples, sputum and flocked oropharyngeal swabs (OPS). Methods: Eleven common respiratory pathogens were tested in hospitalized children< 13 years of age who met the criteria for lower respiratory tract infection by GeXP-based multiplex-PCR of paired OPS and sputum. Results: From January to June 2018, 440 children with paired OPS and sputum were tested. The positive rate was 84% (369/440) for OPS and 88% (386/440) for sputum (p = .007). The frequency of detection of HRV, RSV, Influenza A virus, HMPV, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, M. pneumoniae, coronavirus, bocavirus and C. pneumoniae in sputa was higher than that of OPSs (all p < .001). Both types of specimens had similarly very good kappa values for most of pathogens, except for Mycoplasma pneumonia (\u03ba = 0.61) and Chlamydia pneumoniae (\u03ba = 0.24). Additionally, 79.3% (349/440) of cases showed consistent results between the two types of samples, and they were significantly younger than patients with inconsistent results (p = .002). Conclusions: Flocked oropharyngeal swabs and sputum performed similarly for the detection of common respiratory pathogens in hospitalized children by multiplex-PCR, except for Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae. Young patients are likely to have consistent results between the two specimens.",

Although upper respiratory tract specimens are commonly used in children with respiratory viral and some bacterial infections, there is concern whether the results reflect the cause of lower respiratory tract infection [5] . Lots of studies have compared the yields of these upper respiratory tract specimens, and by PCR to identify viral or bacterial infections by PCR, they have found that the sensitivity of aspirate (or suction) is greater than that of swabs [6] [7] [8] . Compared with specimen from upper airway, excellent diagnostic sensitivity is observed when sputum is available [4, [9] [10] [11] . However, for children, especially young patients who cannot expectorate, a sterile negative pressure suction catheter is applied to obtain OP suction. Young children and parents may find this relatively invasive and distressing procedure unacceptable, thus limiting its use in routine clinical practice [9, 12] . In addition, those oropharyngeal suction or sputa, presumably from, or contaminated by secretions from the upper respiratory tract [13, 14] . Therefore, it is important to assess the prevalence of pathogens in different types of specimens.",

In this study, we used multiplex-PCR to detect 9 virus and 2 atypical bacteria in 440 OPS-sputum specimen pairs from hospitalized children with lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI). We found almost perfect diagnosis agreement between these 2 specimens on nine viruses, but not for the atypical bacteria, M. pneumoniae or C. pneumoniae.

Lambert et al. measured eight types/subtypes of virus in 303 paired nose-throat swab/ NP aspirate samples collected from children with respiratory symptoms. They found that NP aspirates improved sensitivity for the major viruses of childhood, except for influenza B, as its sensitivity was slightly higher in nose-throat swab specimens than NP aspirates (100% vs. 90%) [7] . Similar to our study, sputum testing was more sensitive for influenza B detection (91% vs. 89%). Huijskens explored respiratory pathogens in 92 adult CAP patients, and they discovered that the sensitivity of influenza A were similar in OPS and sputum, but influenza B from OPS was greater than sputum (100% vs. 33%) [19] . Based on these findings, OP or NP swab sample could reasonably replace NP/OP suction as an outpatient procedure for children to avoid missed diagnosis on influenza infection. Thea et al. explored 10 bacteria and 18 viruses using the real-time PCR in 1692 children with severe pneumonia, the sputum specimens were found to increase the number of cases with any virus (4.1%) or bacteria (3.9%), but the overall added yield was marginal (1.3%) [13] . In the recent work, we also observed a 4% increase in sputum yields beyond OPS. Although the diagnostic detection of sputum specimen may not be sufficient to offset mild invasive procedure, sputum samples are still important in cases with certain pathogens are suspected, such as B. pertussis [20] , M. pneumoniae [4, 13, [21] [22] [23] . In this study, the advantages of sputum as a specimen type for detection of M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae were concordant with previous findings. Raty et al. compared three sample types (sputum, NP aspirate and throat swab) from 33 young adult with pneumonia, and they discovered that the highest positive detection rate was from sputum [4] . So the sputum for PCR detection of M. pneumoniae was recommended by the British Thoracic Society Guidelines (2009) [21] . Cho et al. also found a superior sensitivity of sputum in the M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae detection among 217 patients with CAP [22] . This outstanding diagnostic sensitivity of sputum PCR may be attributed to the different nature of MP and CP compared with the other respiratory pathogens than we tested for. As a higher copy number of M. pneumoniae [23] and C. pneumoniae [24] organisms was detected in the pulmonary alveoli than on the epithelium of the upper respiratory tract. These data together with ours indicate that LRTI cases who are suspected to infected with atypical bacteria, the sputum specimen is superior to OPS for reliable detection of MP and CP by PCR.",

Numerous studies have reported that most young children are at high risk of pneumonia associated with viral pathogens [25] [26] [27] . Because of the high rate of virus detection in both sample types observed in our work, younger patients were more likely to show consistent results. Furthermore, consideration should be given that the induced sputum requires a vacuum system, suction catheter, mucus trap and better trained personnel, whereas OPS requires only a swab. Therefore, in order to avoid invasive procedures for sputum suction in young children, OPS will be the preferred sample type for pathogen detection.",
