Thus, it represents a useful example where many organisms ranging from bacteria (Haemophilus influenzae) to fairly conserved viruses (respiratory syncytial virus) to genetically diverse viruses, i.e. influenza A virus, human rhinoviruses (HRV), and human enteroviruses (HEV) need to be detected for successful differential diagnosis. Several technologies, Mass-code\u2122 multiplex RT-PCR system [1] , electrospray ionization mass spectrometry analysis of PCR amplicons [2] , Luminex \u00ae xMAP\u2122 [3] , and various microarray-based approaches [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] , are currently under development as diagnostic platforms to effectively and simultaneously detect and identify large numbers of diverse viral and bacterial respiratory pathogens. One high-density resequencing microarray platform, the Respiratory Pathogen Microarray version 1 (RPM v. 1) , has been successfully demonstrated to identify a much broader range of pathogens (including bacteria and DNA and RNA viruses) in a single test at sensitivities and specificities that are similar to or improved over those of other technologies [9, 10] . In addition, the RPM v.1 platform has the demonstrated capability to discriminate among known and previously unknown strains and variants of targeted pathogens [11, 12] .",

            "text": "While promising, the RPM v.1 platform was a proof-ofconcept microarray for the detection of 26 common respiratory pathogens primarily encountered among military basic trainees. It did not provide comprehensive coverage of all potential respiratory pathogens and the design methodology used was not appropriate for genetically diverse viruses. The design methodology for the RPM v.1 microarray consisted of applying selection rules developed for long oligonucleotide microarrays. These rules were not optimal but worked for bacterial organisms and fairly conserved viruses since previous studies had shown a single sequence on a resequencing microarray could reliably detect and serotype strains with as much as 10 to 15% variation [8, [10] [11] [12] . Their application to cover more diverse viral organisms was less successful. For example, the 5' untranslated region (5'UTR) sequence chosen for HRV on the RPM v.1 only provided identification of the prototype HRV-89 and very little coverage of other HRV serotypes. The 5'UTR sequences, which are relatively conserved among HRV and HEV, have been used in PCR and de novo sequencing for tentative viral identification or serotype classification in lieu of the much more variable capsid proteins that actually determine serotypes [13, 14] . However, the 5'UTR sequences still have ~5 to 30% nucleotide sequence variations among different serotypes so require more than one prototype sequence for proper identification and serotyping. Serotyping HRV and HEV is important to FRI differential diagnosis because even though these \"common cold\" viruses generally only induce mild symptoms, they can cause a wide variety of other severe illnesses, such as aseptic meningitis [15] , bronchitis and asthma [16] .",

The use of 8 \u03bcm feature allows microarrays with greater coverage, currently 86, of common respiratory organisms and high human health risk zoonotic pathogens (bacteria and viruses). A new approach to select a minimal number of prototype sequences that can be used to detect all and correctly identify many of the relevant strains of genetically diverse viruses such as HRV and HEV was developed. Due to the great genetic diversity of HRV and HEV, in order to ensure that designed probes (referred to as probe sequences) generated from selected database sequences (referred to as prototype regions) would detect and discriminate all serotypes of HRV and HEV, a predictive model was used to assist the microarray design [17] . This in silico model developed for predicting resequencing microarray hybridization patterns shows good concordance in the overall percentage of base calls predicted versus experimental results. Thus it is possible to use this model for evaluating the performance of database sequences as potential prototype regions. In this study, we report on results of this algorithm applied to the 5'UTR sequences of HRV and HEV and confirm that using ~15% of the RPM-Flu v.30/31 microarray (17,335 HRV and HEV nucleotides of total 117,254 nucleotides on array) is sufficient to detect and differentiate many HRV and HEV serotypes.",

These sequences were treated as target sequences (what would be detected by the microarray) and also as prototype sequences (the potential probe sequences tiled on the microarray). Each downloaded sequence was treated as a prototype used to generate probe sequences (Fig 1. Step 1-2) and the remaining sequences were treated as target sequences (Fig 1. Step [3] [4] . Sets of 4 25-mer probes (1 perfect match and 3 mismatches in the 13 th position) were generated from a prototype sequence and correspond to what would actually appear on a resequencing microarray. The other sequences were treated as a target one at a time and generated overlapping fragments from 13 to 25 bases long with a near neighbor \u0394G energy less than -14.5. These fragments have been shown to have strong binding strength and produce unique base calls. The generated probes and sequence fragments were the input to the in silico model [17] for simulation which compared the fragments to the probe sets and determined the base calls a target sequence would generate. The predicted base calls were assembled into a simulated resequencing microarray result.",

Of the 34 strains, 18 had corresponding 5'UTR sequences tiled on the microarray and were called prototype serotypes, which were used to verify the accuracy of the designed HRV probes. The remaining 16 strains, representing near neighbor serotypes, were selected from diverse clades based on phylogenetic classification of HRV serotypes [18, 19] . These strains were used to investigate the capability of the microarray to detect other HRV serotypes that did not have their sequences tiled on the microarray. Overall, the selected strains covered every single clade of 101 HRV serotypes based on phylogenetic analysis of the P1-P2 regions of 5'UTR sequences [18] . One metric of the hybridization in a reference region is to divide the number of bases reported as A, C, G, or T by the total number of bases for that region (probe length), which we refer to as the base call rate and proportionally reflects the hybridization strength or homology between the prototype and target sequences. A hybridization profile ( Fig. 2A) using the base call rates clearly showed a unique pattern for each serotype. The closely related serotypes with less nucleotide divergences had similar hybridization profiles across the tiled regions, so it is possible to assign species (HRVA and HRVB) based only on the hybridization patterns. The brighter red spots (higher base call rates) along the diagonal suggested that stronger hybridizations between the tiled probes and 5'UTRs from the prototype serotypes. It is also of note that HRV87 does not fall into either of two major clusters which agrees with other findings that it should really be classified as a HEV [20, 21] . To validate the accuracy of the array clustering, 5'UTR of each serotype was amplified by type-specific RT-PCR and subjected to conventional sequencing. The phylogenetic tree derived from the de novo 5'UTR sequences (Additional file 2) confirms the HRVA and HRVB classification. Pair-wise sequence comparisons also indicated that the average nucleotide divergence of 5 to database entries, this information could be integrated into the final identification. For these samples with high base call rates, the best hit would have tens to hundreds more matched bases than the next best hit. The remaining 16 ATCC strains represent near neighbor serotypes, which 5'UTR sequences share >80% identifies to those of prototypes. In all but the case of HRV5, the information was sufficient to identify the correct serotypes. In these samples, the difference in the number of base calls matching in the best hit and the next best hit was more variable and on average was fewer. The confidence of the identification depends on the accuracy of the base call. Since the best hit always had at least one base that matched the resequencing results and was a mismatch for the next best hit, it was Hybridization profiles of HRV and HEV serotypes from RPM-Flu v.30/31 microarrays Figure 2 Hybridization profiles of HRV and HEV serotypes from RPM-Flu v.30/31 microarrays.

Base call rates (number of base calls/probe length in each tile) generated from viral samples (rows) and prototype probes (columns) were calculated and clustered using dChip software. Rows standardized base call rates. Positive hybridization was represented by red color. Higher base call rates were shown as brighter red colors.

With .0001% being the largest level of uncertainty seen for these samples, it was deemed acceptable to treat the best hit as the correct identification. For HRV5, several database sequences representing different serotypes had the same score and since no further information was available it was only possible to determine that a HRV species B was present. The 5'UTR sequences from the tested strains generated with de novo sequencing were subjected to in silico predictive modeling analysis and the result of this was used as input in the CIBSI analysis program. For the case of HRV5, the in silico model predicted a larger fraction of base calls being made than were observed in the experiment.

Two strains were identified by RPM-Flu v.30/31 as HEV4 and HEV5, results in agreement with the conventional sequencing of each 5'UTR. However, the strains as provided by CDC were identified as HEV6 and CAVB3 respectively, based on the VP1 region. Specific serotypes could not be identified for the remaining sixteen samples using the sequence read generated from the array. Nevertheless these samples were easily categorized into the respective species. Due to amplification problems only a subset of strains were successfully de novo sequenced, which showed 3 -18% variations in 5'UTR sequences. The base call rates obtained by in silico predictions based on the de novo sequences were similar to the microarray results and the identifications agreed in all but one case.",

The potential of using resequencing microarray for simultaneous detection and identification of highly diverse respiratory pathogens, such as HRV and HEV, was also demonstrated. The conserved nature of the 5' UTR regions of HRV and HEV genomes and the capabil- ities of the resequencing microarray allow serotype level identification of near-neighbor serotypes of HRV and HEV, when long (> 100 nucleotides) sequences are read from the array. Identifications can be still made for shorter length sequences to the species level particularly when the array has one or more such sequences derived from different probes.",

All HRV variants tested in this study could be detected and identified at least to the species level. The limited number of HRV sequences available in GenBank during the time of design of RPM-Flu v.30/31 rendered a few of the targets represented on RPM-Flu v.30/31 are shorter than 200 bp.

Several strains not producing serotype identifications might have been indicative of assay protocol issues or probe design. The fact that the in silico model prediction was also not serotype specific indicates it was most likely a design issue. This was further confirmed by agreement in base calls made from the resequencing microarray and from conventional resequencing. Although all the strains of HEV have complete genome sequences, there are also many partial sequence submissions for each strain in Gen-Bank that were ignored for the HEV design. A re-examination of the 5'UTR regions showed up to 14% difference in sequences grouped in the same serotype. This indicates that a redesign of the HEV prototype regions is needed where selection of a minimal set of prototype regions would be based on all available 5'UTR sequence data (complete and partial) and not a subset of genome sequences.",

Oberste et al. demonstrated that typing based upon HEV VP1 capsid gene sequences showed excellent correlation with serotype determined by classical antigenic methods [28] . Thus amplification and sequencing of the partial VP1 amino-terminal coding region has been accepted as a standard molecular typing method for HEV but such is not the case for the 5'UTR region [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] . Our results show that the 5'UTR region did not correlate as closely as VP1-based typing to antigenic type definitions for HEV unlike how it performed for HRV. While the 5'UTR region is sufficient to accurately identify the groupings, a design using VP1 as the probe region is needed to provide serotyping identifications that will match classical methods.",
