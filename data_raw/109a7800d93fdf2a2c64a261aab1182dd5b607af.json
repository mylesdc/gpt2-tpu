A radiological investigation was performed in osteonecrosis patients with a high risk of MFON for a more accurate diagnosis between January 2010 and June 2015. For patients with osteonecrosis of both the hip and knee joints or for patients with a history of corticosteroid use or alcohol abuse who had osteonecrosis of one or more joints in the shoulder, ankle, wrist or elbow, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was also performed on other joints, regardless of whether these joints were symptomatic. Furthermore, we performed a radiological screening of 102 patients who had a negative diagnosis of MFON but were at a high risk; among them, another 31 MFON cases were successfully identified (30.4%). Thus, the incidence of MFON during the study period increased from 3.1% to 5.2%. Patients diagnosed with osteonecrosis and who are at a high risk of MFON should have their other joints radiologically examined when necessary. This will reduce missed diagnosis of MFON and facilitate an earlier diagnosis and treatment to achieve an optimal outcome.",

Mont et al. 1 studied 101 MFON cases diagnosed between 1980 and 1996 from 21 centers in the United States. According to the available data from 12 centers concerning their total number of patients with osteonecrosis, 81 patients had MFON of the 2484 patients (3.3%) diagnosed with osteonecrosis. In 2003, we screened post-SARS medical workers with corticosteroid use and found 37 patients had MFON of the 176 patients (21%) with a diagnosis of osteonecrosis. By contrast, between 2005 and 2009, we found only 17 patients with MFON of the 657 patients (2.6%) diagnosed with osteonecrosis who were admitted to our center. The incidence of MFON in post-SARS osteonecrosis patients was obviously higher than that in daily clinical practice. This is because the lesions found in joints, such as the knees, shoulders and ankles, in the early stages of MFON cases may not have any signs or symptoms. In our screening of post-SARS patients, all of them had a comprehensive MRI evaluation of their bilateral hips, knees, shoulders and wrists or ankles, which revealed the asymptomatic osteonecrosis. However, in daily clinical practice, we often focus on the osteonecrosis diagnosis of the femoral head without performing an MRI on the other joints. This implies that there are possible missed diagnoses of asymptomatic MFON patients. A recent study also showed a higher incidence of MFON than that typically reported in literature 4 .",

Therefore, the exact incidence of MFON in patients with various diseases remains unclear. The incidence of MFON in 200 patients with sickle cell disease was reported to be 44% (87 of 200) 4 as a complication in the maintenance treatment of acute lymphocytic leukemia and non-Hodgkin's disease, and its incidence in these diseases is also higher than that reported in the literature. Solarino et al. 9 performed MRI screening in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia after chemotherapy and found that 82% of them had MFON 9 . In the MFON cases presented in this study, most were SLE, followed by hematological diseases, nephropathy, organ transplantation, dermatomyositis and multiple sclerosis. MFON was especially prevalent in leukemia patients; 17 of the 20 osteonecrosis patients with leukemia under our care were found to have MFON. Three of the four patients who received pulse steroid therapy for trauma emergency had a spinal cord injury, for which steroid therapy was considered appropriate. However, one patient received pulse steroid therapy for only an eye injury and was found to have osteonecrosis in eight joints, including the hips, knees, shoulders and ankles. Caution should be taken for such cases in the future. MFON patients most commonly had osteonecrosis of the femoral head, followed by the knee, shoulder and ankle bones. Osteonecrosis of the shoulder, ankle and wrist never occurred aloneand was always accompanied by osteonecrosis of the hip and knee. Among the three populations of MFON patients presented in this study, 98-100% had femoral head involvement, 78-88% had knee involvement, and 29-67% had humeral head involvement.

Initial studies found that low field MRI was as sensitive as a radionuclide scan in diagnosing osteonecrosis. Nevertheless, recent studies have demonstrated that high field (1.5-3 T) MRI has a higher sensitivity, specificity and accuracy in diagnosing osteonecrosis. Mont et al. 17 compared the sensitivity of radionuclide scans with MRI, and found that MRI has a sensitivity of 100%. By contrast, the sensitivity of radionuclide scans is only 45%. Radionuclide scans have a higher sensitivity in detecting advanced stage osteonecrosis of the hip and knee than of the shoulder and ankle. Although the diagnosis of osteonecrosis by MRI has its advantages, the screening for MFON with MRI is faced with a long scanning time and high cost. There have been debates regarding the optimal method to screen symptomatic and asymptomatic MFON 18, 19 . Plain film X-ray is not sensitive enough to diagnose asymptomatic MFON, but there is still an advantage to carrying out an X-ray examination. Even if the X-ray result of a joint with pain is negative for osteonecrosis, it provides a preliminary examination of the local bone structure, which serves as a reference for further investigation by MRI. Other methods include a short time inversion recovery (STIR) MRI test followed by MRI or a radionuclide scan of specific joints. Nevertheless, further studies are required to determine the optimal method for early detection of osteonecrosis. Moreover, as the majority (70-100%) of osteonecrosis cases reported in the literature are bilateral, patients diagnosed with osteonecrosis of a joint on one side should be radiologically examined on the other side.",

In addition, predicting the presence of collapse of the joint surfaces is the basis for determining the order of treatment. The progress of osteonecrosis is often different for each joint. Osteonecrosis of the femoral head progresses the fastest and attention should be paid to the early appearance of symptoms. This is followed by the progression of osteonecrosis to the knees and shoulders. Patients who have osteonecrosis of multiple weight-bearing joints and a large necrotic lesion area may develop joint destruction, and early intervention should be used. The progression of osteonecrosis to the elbow and wrist is relatively slow; however, we still lack experience regarding the appropriate treatment method for this area. Bone infarction often leads to calcification and self-repair. Hence, osteonecrotic elbows and wrists should mainly be managed by monitoring, and over treatment should be avoided if there are no clinical symptoms. In addition, an appropriate treatment strategy should be selected according to the stage of osteonecrosis in each joint involved 20 . For symptomatic patients at an early stage (i.e., ARCO Stages I, II or China Stages I-III), joint-preservation treatment options are commonly used, such as extracorporeal shock wave, core decompression, and vascularized and nonvascularized bone grafting. When > 2 mm of the articular surface has collapsed or the necrotic lesion area is > 50%, joint-preservation treatments may not provide good efficacy. In the advanced stages of the disease (i.e., ARCO Stages IIIc and IV, or China Stages V-VI), arthroplasty is required when joint preservation is not possible.",

Such screening can help to effectively reduce missed diagnoses. The goals of the treatment should be to take measures to delay the progress of the disease, to preserve the joint function and to avoid joint surface collapse and destruction by diagnosing the disease early.

The parameters of the scan included a layer thickness of 5 mm and a distance between layers of 5 mm. The T1WI were obtained with a TR from 416~440 ms and a TE of 15 ms, and the STIR images were obtained with a TR of 1512 ms and a TE of 80 ms. If an abnormal signal was found, then a T2 weighted scan was added, and for some of the patients, we also performed fat suppression and water-fat separation sequences. We only used T1 and T2 sequences for the other joints of the patients. Osteonecrosis was defined as either a subchondral or an intramedullary area demarcated by a distinct marginal rim with low signal intensity that encompassed the medullary fat on the MRI images. In addition to the MRI, all patients were subjected to an X-ray that included the affected joints.",

By contrast, the dose was > 5000 mg in all MFON patients except for one patient who received 2000 mg, with the highest dose at 31,000 mg. The MFON patients also had prolonged corticosteroid treatment (\u2265 30 days) 3 . Of the 17 MFON patients diagnosed between January 2005 and December 2009, one had a 30-year history of alcohol abuse (average daily alcohol consumption of 500 g). The remaining 16 patients had a history of intensive steroid use for the following diseases: SLE (7 patients), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (4 patients), chronic nephropathy (3 patients), anaphylactoid purpura (1 patient) and pulse steroid therapy for traumatic shock (1 patient). Therefore, we summarized the high risk factors for MFON to include: a medical history of SLE, chronic nephropathy, hematological diseases or coagulation abnormalities (especially leukemia); total corticosteroid (methylprednisolone) dose > 5000 mg, especially for patients with a history of intravenous pulse therapy; and a total corticosteroid administration time of > 30 days.",
