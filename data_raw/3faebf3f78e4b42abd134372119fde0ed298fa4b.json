            "text": "Dicer is the key component in the miRNA pathway. Degradation of Dicer protein is facilitated during vaccinia virus (VV) infection. A C-terminal cleaved product of Dicer protein was detected in the presence of MG132 during VV infection. Thus, it is possible that Dicer protein is cleaved by a viral protease followed by proteasome degradation of the cleaved product. There is a potential I7 protease cleavage site in the C-terminus of Dicer protein. Indeed, reduction of Dicer protein was detected when Dicer was co-expressed with I7 protease but not with an I7 protease mutant protein lack of the protease activity. Mutation of the potential I7 cleavage site in the C-terminus of Dicer protein resisted its degradation during VV infection. Furthermore, Dicer protein was reduced dramatically by recombinant VV vI7Li after the induction of I7 protease. If VV could facilitate the degradation of Dicer protein, the process of miRNA should be affected by VV infection. Indeed, accumulation of precursor miR122 was detected after VV infection or I7 protease expression. Reduction of miR122 would result in the suppression of HCV sub-genomic RNA replication, and, in turn, the amount of viral proteins. As expected, significant reduction of HCVNS5A protein was detected after VV infection and I7 protease expression. Therefore, our results suggest that VV could cleave Dicer protein through I7 protease to facilitate Dicer degradation, and in turn, suppress the processing of miRNAs. Effect of Dicer protein on VV replication was also studied. Exogenous expression of Dicer protein suppresses VV replication slightly while knockdown of Dicer protein does not affect VV replication significantly.",

            "text": "It is possible that during VV infection Dicer protein is cleaved by a viral protease at the Cterminus and the cleaved products are then degraded by proteasome degradation pathway. VV G1 protein, a predicted metalloprotease, is essential for the morphogenesis of infectious virions but not for the cleavage of major core proteins [35] . In addition, I7 protease is responsible for processing most or all viral core and membrane proteins in the late stage of VV life cycle [30, 36, 37] . These proteolytic events are involved in the transformation of immature virions into mature virions. There are five predicted cleavage sites for I7 protease (AG/X) in Dicer protein sequence. Therefore, I7 protease may involve in the cleavage of Dicer protein. To address this issue, I7 protease gene was cloned and expressed (Figure SII in S1 File). When co-expressed with I7 protease, exogenously expressed Dicer protein was reduced as detected using antibodies against the extreme C-terminus of Dicer protein ( Fig. 2A, lanes 2 and 3) . When MG132 was added, full-length Dicer protein was increased in the absence of I7 protease ( Fig. 2A , lanes 2 and 4) while it was further reduced in the presence of I7 protease ( Fig. 2A , lanes 3-5) as detected using antibodies against the extreme C-terminus of Dicer protein. The same samples were analyzed using antibodies recognizing the N-terminal T7 tag of Dicer protein. A band with smaller size was detected in the presence of MG132 when Dicer and I7 proteins were coexpressed (Fig. 2B, lanes 2 and 3) . Expression of I7 protease could only be detected by Western blotting analysis in the presence of MG132 to stabilize this labile protein (lane 5, Fig. 2A) . The plasmid expressing a mutant I7 protease lack of the protease activity was constructed by replacing amino acid residue 328 from Cys to Ala [30] . Reduction of Dicer protein was not detected when it was co-expressed with this mutant I7 protein (Fig. 2C) .",

            "text": "Reduction of Dicer protein in VV-infected cells (Fig. 1 ) may be caused by several different mechanisms. One possible mechanism is due to mRNA reduction (Figures SIA and SIB in S1 File), which is also reported previously [20] . VV is known to enhance the degradation of host mRNAs by two decapping enzymes encoded by the virus, D9 and D10 [40, 41] . There are still other possible mechanisms. The reduction of Dicer protein during VV infection could be recovered by adding araC to inhibit the VV DNA replication (Fig. 1) . Therefore, in addition to the reduction of Dicer mRNA, a viral protease expressed after VV DNA synthesis is also probably responsible for the reduction of Dicer protein. I7 protease is required for AG/X-specific cleavages of viral membrane and core proteins during VV assembly [30] . Our results further demonstrated that Dicer protein was first cleaved by I7 protease after a.a. 1817 and the cleaved product was then degraded by the proteasome-ubiquitin degradation pathway during VV infection (Figs. 1-3) . Comparing with the I7 protease encoded by VV infection (Fig. 3) , I7 protease derived from expressing plasmid is much more labile because it could only be detected by Western blotting analysis in the presence of MG132 ( Figs. 2A and 5B ). This also indicated that tiny amount of I7 protease should be sufficient for the cleavage of Dicer protein (Figs. 2A and 5B). However, Dicer protein was reduced after the induction of I7 protease protein in the presence of more than 50 uM IPTG but not in less than 50 uM IPTG (Fig. 3) , indicating that not only the tiny amount of I7 protease but also other factors (e.g., whether I7 protease interacts with Dicer protein or not) are important to cleave Dicer protein and facilitate its degradation.",

            "text": "There are many different ways of interactions between viruses and miRNAs. Firstly, host miRNAs could suppress or facilitate viral replication [5, 6, 38] . Secondly, many DNA viruses, including herpesviruses, adenovirus, polyomaviruses and papillomavirus, have evolved to encode viral miRNAs to potentially control various phases of the viral life cycle, such as latency, reactivation, replication, etc. [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] . We do not expect VV would encode its viral miRNAs, similar to those typical cellular miRNAs, because this virus is replicated in the cytoplasm. Thirdly, both our present study and Dr. Grinberg's report [20] showed that a suppression of host miRNA expression was followed by the reduction of Dicer protein during VV infection. Other DNA viruses may not suppress Dicer protein since this would affect the processing of their own viral miRNAs. Therefore, it is not surprising that VV, different from the other DNA viruses, uses a novel way to interact with miRNAs.",
