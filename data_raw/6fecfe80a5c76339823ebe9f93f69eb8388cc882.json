Methods: We collected 700 nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) from hospitalized children with SARI in Beijing (northern China) and Shanghai (southern China). Multiple respiratory viruses (including 15 common viruses) were screened by validated polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or real-time reverse transcription-PCR assays and confirmed by sequencing. Demographic data and the distribution of viral infections were also examined. Results: Of 700 samples, 547 (78.1%) tested positive for viral infections. The picornaviruses (PIC), which included rhinovirus (RV) and enterovirus (EV), were the most common (34.0%), followed by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (28.3%), human bocavirus (HBoV) (19.1%), adenovirus (ADV) (13.7%), human coronaviruses (HCoV) (10.7%), influenza A and B (8.9%), parainfluenza virus (PIV 1-3) (7.9%), and human metapneumovirus (HMPV) (5.0%). PIC (RV/EV) and RSV were the most prevalent etiological agents of SARI in both cities. The total and age-matched prevalence of RSV, HCoV, and hMPV among SARI children under 5 years old were significantly higher in Beijing than in Shanghai. Different age and seasonal distribution patterns of the viral infections were found between Beijing and Shanghai.",

            "text": "Acute respiratory infections (ARI) are associated with significant morbidity and mortality worldwide, particularly in children under the age of 5 years [1, 2] . Severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) is the leading cause of hospitalization in children and of febrile episodes in infants younger than 3 months old [3, 4] . The most common cause of SARI in children is viral infections [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] , including influenza viruses A and B (Flu A/B); respiratory syncytial virus (RSV); adenovirus (ADV); parainfluenza virus (PIV) 1-3; picornavirus (PIC), which mainly includes human rhinovirus (RV) and human enterovirus (EV); human coronaviruses (HCoV), which includes OC43, 229E, NL63, and HKU; human bocavirus (HBoV); and human metapneumovirus (HMPV). Although the viral and epidemiological profiles of pediatric patients with SARI vary among countries [4, [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] , few studies have comprehensively compared the viral and epidemiological profiles of pediatric patients with SARI in different geographic areas or climate zones within the same country, such as China.",

Beijing is located in the North of China on the Pacific Ocean, which stands at the northern tip of the North China Plain. Beijing has a semi-humid continental climate in the warm temperate zone. The spring and autumn are relatively short when compared with the duration of summer and winter. The annual temperature is around 11.8 degree Celsius, January can be considered as the coldest month in Beijing for average temperature at \u2212 4.6 degree Celsius, while July will be the hottest month in Beijing. Shanghai is the largest city in China, with a population of more than 25 million. The city is located in the southeast region of the country and has a subtropical monsoon climate. Shanghai lies on China's east coast roughly equidistant from Beijing. Shanghai's climate is classified as humid subtropical and experiences four distinct seasons. Summer temperatures at noontime often hit 35-36\u00b0C (95-97\u00b0F) with very high humidity. Winters are chilly and damp, with northwesterly winds from Siberia can cause nighttime temperatures to drop below freezing. In between, spring can feature lengthy periods of cloudy, often rainy, weather, while Autumn is generally mild to dry and sunny. The city averages 4.8\u00b0C (40.6\u00b0F) in January and 28.6\u00b0C (83.5\u00b0F) in July, for an annual mean of 17.1\u00b0C (62.8\u00b0F).",

The second round consisted of 94\u00b0C for 5 min; then 94\u00b0C for 30 s, 50\u00b0C for 30 s, and 72\u00b0C for 1 min, 25 cycles; and then 72\u00b0C for 5 min. The HCoV (including HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1) and HMPV were detected by nested onestep RT-PCR, as described previously [15] [16] [17] . The nested one-step RT-PCR was performed in two rounds as follows. The first round consisted of 50\u00b0C for 30 min and then 95\u00b0C for 15 min; then 94\u00b0C for 40 s, 52\u00b0C for 40 s, and 72\u00b0C for 40 s for 35 cycles; and then 72\u00b0C for 5 min. The second round consisted of 94\u00b0C for 5 min; then 94\u00b0C for 40 s, 55\u00b0C for 40 s, and 72\u00b0C for 40 s for 25 cycles; and then 72\u00b0C for 5 min. HBoV was detected using a nested PCR method as described previously [6] . The nested PCR programs were performed in two cycles as follows. The first round consisted of 94\u00b0C for 5 min; then 94\u00b0C for 45 s, 55\u00b0C for 45 s, and 72\u00b0C for 1 min for 35 cycles; and then 72\u00b0C for 5 min. The second round consisted of 94\u00b0C for 5 min; 94\u00b0C for 45 s, 55\u00b0C for 45 s, and 72\u00b0C for 1 min for 25 cycles; and then 72\u00b0C for 5 min. All of the detection assays were validated and optimized to ensure reproducibility, specificity, and sensitivity. Furthermore, all of the positive PCR products were confirmed by sequencing.",

Our study is the first to compare respiratory viral infections and their epidemiology in hospitalized children with SARI in Beijing and Shanghai. Of the 700 patients included in the study, 78.1% tested positive for at least one virus; this rate was higher than that reported by previous studies (range, 34.6-70.3%) [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . This finding may be mainly explained by some differences in the SARI case inclusion criteria, since additional criteria in our study were a normal or low leukocyte count or indrawing of the lower chest wall. In addition, several factors may account for this disparity, including true differences in the overall burden or differences in study populations or methodologies [18, [23] [24] [25] . Moreover, infection rates vary with geographical location and season [22, 26, 27] . Finally, the specific viruses included in our screening decisions may account for the higher positive rates in our study. The positive infection rate in Beijing was slightly higher than that in Shanghai (92.7 vs. 70.1%, respectively). Given the small number of cases and the limited testing period, further studies are needed to determine whether infection rates significantly differ in the two cities.",

In this study, the seasonal distribution of viral infections differed in Beijing and Shanghai. PIC infections were more Fig. 1 Detection frequencies of respiratory viruses in Beijing and Shanghai according to matched age groups. We considered P < 0.05 to be significant (marked as an asterisk) for all analyses between two cities frequent during the summer months in Beijing and more common during autumn in Shanghai, which is consistent with previous findings [15, 19, 25] . Moreover, our findings that RSV and HMPV were prevalent in the spring and winter and that Flu A/B peaked in winter are consistent with those of previous studies [15, 25, 32, 33] . The HCoV epidemic season occurred in the spring in Beijing, whereas the virus did not show a significant seasonal pattern in Shanghai. It may be that HCoV infections occur as biennial outbreaks in Shanghai [16, [34] [35] [36] [37] . Previous studies have shown that, although HBoV infections occur throughout the year, they are most evident during the winter and spring months [6, 38, 39] . In contrast, we found that HBoV infections were most common during the summer months in Beijing and Shanghai. We did not have sufficient data to confirm whether climate and geographic location were associated with the virus infection patterns.",

The total and age-matched prevalence of RSV, HCoV, and HMPV among SARI children under 5 years old were significantly higher in Beijing than in Shanghai. Moreover, the seasonal distributions of the pathogens differed between the regions. We noticed that the mean and median ages in months of the Beijing group were younger than those in the Shanghai group, so age adjustments of the results should be used to clarify future findings based on future larger surveillance studies.",

The observed pattern of seasonal variation of respiratory viruses are complex between hospitalized children with SARI in Beijing and Shanghai, since the weather and temperature variations between the two cities. Our findings provide a better understanding of the roles of geographic location and climate in respiratory viral infections in hospitalized children with SARI. In addition, our findings provide baseline data for investigations of the burden of respiratory viral infections in Beijing and Shanghai. However, additional studies with larger patient populations are needed to clarify the roles of viral and bacterial pathogens in SARI cases and to evaluate the overall burden of respiratory pathogens in asymptomatic children [40] .",

PIC (RV/EV), HBoV, HCoV, and ADV caused infections throughout the year; thus, a seasonal distribution was not apparent in Beijing or Shanghai. RSV peaked in the spring and winter, and Flu A/B and HMPV peaked in the winter in both Beijing and Shanghai. PIV1-3 occurred mainly in the spring and summer in Beijing, whereas this virus was most prevalent in summer and autumn in Shanghai.
