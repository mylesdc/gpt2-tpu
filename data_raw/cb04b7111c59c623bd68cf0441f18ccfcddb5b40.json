            "text": "Throughout the rabies virus (RABV) infectious cycle, host-virus interactions define its capacity to replicate, escape the immune response, and spread. As phosphorylation is a key regulatory mechanism involved in most cellular processes, kinases represent a target of choice to identify host factors required for viral replication. A kinase and phosphatase small interfering RNA (siRNA) high-content screening was performed on a fluorescent protein-recombinant field isolate (Tha RABV). We identified 57 high-confidence key host factors important for RABV replication with a readout set at 18 h postinfection and 73 with a readout set at 36 h postinfection, including 24 common factors at all stages of the infection. Amongst them, gene clusters of the most prominent pathways were determined. Up to 15 mitogenactivated protein kinases (MAPKs) and effectors, including MKK7 (associated with Jun N-terminal protein kinase [JNK] signalization) and DUSP5, as well as 17 phosphatidylinositol (PI)-related proteins, including PIP5K1C and MTM1, were found to be involved in the later stage of RABV infection. The importance of these pathways was further validated, as small molecules Ro 31-8820 and PD 198306 inhibited RABV replication in human neurons. IMPORTANCE Rabies virus relies on cellular machinery for its replication while simultaneously evading the host immune response. Despite their importance, little is known about the key host factors required for rabies virus infection. Here, we focused on the human kinome, at the core of many cellular pathways, to unveil a new understanding of the rabies virus infectious cycle and to discover new potential therapeutic targets in a small interfering RNA screening. The mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway and phosphatidylinositol metabolism were identified as prominent factors involved in rabies virus infection, and those findings were further confirmed in human neurons. While bringing a new insight into rabies virus biology, we also provide a new list of host factors involved in rabies virus infection.",

            "text": "RABV is a single-stranded negative RNA virus (order Mononegavirales, family Rhabdoviridae) with a 12-kb genome coding for 5 proteins. The nucleoprotein (N) encapsulates the genomic viral RNA, which constitutes a ribonucleoprotein (RNP). The phosphoprotein (P) and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L) bind to the RNP, forming the replication and transcription complex (4, 5) . The glycoprotein (G) is inserted into the envelope of the viral particle and acts as a binding and fusion protein for the entry of the virus into the host cell. The matrix protein (M) links the N protein involved in the RNP to the internal domain of the G protein, shaping the viral particle in a \"bullet\" shape as well as playing a crucial role in the entry and budding phases, notably hijacking the endosomal sorting complex required for transport or endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) (6) . Together with the N protein, the M protein also regulates the balance between replication and transcription (7) . Moreover, all viral proteins harbor secondary functions to hijack the cellular machinery. The N and L proteins are notably involved in hiding viral RNAs from cell sensors (8, 9) . Further, both the G and M proteins participate in the regulation of cell death, interfering with MAST2, protein tyrosine-phosphatase nonreceptor 4 (PTPN4), TRAIL, and cytochrome c oxidase signaling (10) (11) (12) . Finally, the P and M proteins hijack the IRF (IB kinase [IKK] , TBK1, IRF3), NF-B (RelAp43, p105/p50, ABIN2), JAK-STAT (JAK1, STAT1, STAT2, STAT3), and possibly the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) (TPL2) pathways in order to control the immune response (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) .",

Transcriptomic (20) (21) (22) (23) and proteomic (24) (25) (26) experiments identified differentially expressed genes and proteins in RABV-infected cells but generally lacked a clear functional relevance to pathogenesis (23) . A yeast two-hybrid screening determined that the focal adhesion kinase (FAK) interacts with the P protein, and a cell-free protein synthesis screening identified ATP-binding cassette family E1 (ABCE1) as a possible factor for capsid formation such as is observed with HIV (27, 28) . Recently, a first loss-of-function screening was performed on 3,200 mutant neurons differentiated from murine embryonic stem cells using the SPBN-Nfu-GFP laboratory strain (29) . The spreading capacity of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-labeled RABV was investigated at 24, 48, and 72 h, and 63 hits were found, among which 2 targets were validated: Unc13d and Bbs4 (the 61 other hits were neither confirmed nor invalidated). A gene ontology (GO) analysis assigned the 63 hits to the following GO terms: induction of apoptosis, G-protein-coupled receptor binding, and perinuclear region of cytoplasm and ubiquitin-specific protease/thioesterase activity. Further, a genome-wide screening focusing on the late stage of several negative-strand RNA viruses (30) identified nearly 72 important genes for vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV; Rhabdoviridae), among which 25 were also identified as important for lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV; Arenaviridae) and human parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPIV3; Paramyxoviridae). A second genome-wide screening was performed on the early stages of VSV infection (31) and identified 300 host genes important for VSV, among which 23 were validated. Taken together, the following 8 common hits were identified as key factors for the early and late VSV infection: ARCN1, COPB1, COPG, COPZ1, MAT2A, NHP2L1, SYVN1, and UTP6.",

All siRNAs affecting cell viability at 18 h (Fig. 1A ) and 36 h (Fig. 1B) were labeled toxic (threshold at 30% of siNEG count of nuclei). The mean of the siNEG Tha-GFP intensity was then used to define hits under a 3 threshold as viral helpers and hits over a 2 threshold as viral inhibitors at 18 h (Fig. 1C ) and 36 h (Fig. 1D ). The specificity of the 3 threshold was confirmed by analysis of the controls. At 18 h postinfection, the Tha-GFP signals corresponding to 95% of the level seen with the siGFP-treated well and 45% of the level seen with the siNCL-treated well were under the 3 threshold. At 36 h, 100% of the siGFP-treated wells but none of the siNCL-treated wells had a Tha-GFP signal under the 3 threshold. Therefore, NCL is a key factor for Tha-GFP only in the early stages of the infection, which further validates our system. Finally, only genes confirmed with at least two of three single siRNAs were considered high-confidence key host factors (listed in Table 1 and 2) whereas genes with only one effective siRNA were labeled low-confidence factors in further analysis (listed in Table S1 and S2 in the supplemental material). Using this approach, we were able to identify 54 high-confidence viral helpers for the early stages of the infection and 66 for the late stages of the infection (Fig. 1E ). In comparison, only a few high-confidence viral inhibitors were identified (3 at 18 h and 7 at 36 h) (Fig. 1F) . Interestingly, 24 genes were commonly identified as high-confidence viral helpers at all stages of the infection (Fig. 1G) . Furthermore, 7 high-confidence viral helpers were found to be systematically affecting RABV replication with all three siRNAs, including CDC25C, CHTF18, EPHA7, PPP2CA, and PTPRN at 18 h postinfection and DUSP5 and PRPF4B at 36 h postinfection (Table 1 and 2) .",

In particular, CDC25C was shown to be important at both 18 h and 36 h postinfection and all three single siRNAs used against it were shown to affect RABV replication. Further, a significant number of MAPK (MEK1/MAP2K1)associated phosphatases (DUSP5, DUSP7, and DUSP22) and downstream effectors (PAK4 and PAK6) were defined as high-confidence viral helpers among a total of 12 MAPK-associated proteins (Fig. 2) . Interestingly, PAK6 interference was the most effective with respect to RABV replication at 18 h, reducing the Tha-GFP signal to 24% of levels seen with the controls ( Table 1 ). The largest cluster of genes involved as viral helpers of RABV corresponded to inositol phosphate metabolism, with 5 highconfidence hits (INPPL1, INPP5E, MINPP1, MTMR4, and PIK3C2G) among 13 hits (Fig. 2) . This result was linked to two downstream effectors of phosphatidylinositol as well as connecting with the previously described MAPK and inositol phosphate pathways. It is also noteworthy that SRC interference had an inhibitory effect on Tha-GFP at 36 h. However, it was not considered for further analysis as it was also shown to be cytotoxic (Table S2) . At the later stages of the infection, only four gene clusters were associated with a function or pathway (Fig. 3) , and all were already identified at the early stages (Fig. 2) . First, mannose metabolism and fructose metabolism were also shown to be important in the later stages, as a phosphofructokinase-biphosphatase (PFKBP2), a fructosebiphosphatase (FBP2), and pyruvate kinase (PKLR) were high-confidence viral helpers. If we consider the hits labeled \"low confidence,\" FBP2 had already been identified at 18 h and the phosphofructokinase PFKM was identified at both 18 h and 36 h (Fig. 2) . Interestingly, mannose and fructose metabolism interference reduced Tha-GFP signal by 50% at 18 h and by more than 70% at 36 h (Table 2; see also Table S2 ). In addition, high-confidence MAPK (MKK7/MAP2K7) and a downstream effector (PAK6) as well as an associated phosphatase (DUSP5) were again identified as viral helpers at 36 h (Fig. 2) . If we consider the hits labeled \"low confidence,\" PAK4 and MAP2K1 (MEK1) were identified with only one siRNA after 18 h (Fig. 2 ; see also High-confidence (\u05462 siRNA, black) and low-confidence (1 siRNA, gray) hit interactions were computed using STRING v10.5 and were visualized using Cytoscape v3.4. Only low-confidence hits directly interacting with at least one high-confidence hit are displayed. The Tha-GFP score corresponds to the average GFP signal measured in each active single siRNA normalized to the mean of the data from the siNEG control. Hits were retrospectively marked as validated (*) or OTE (#). tyrosine-phosphatase nonreceptor (PTPN7) as well as many MAPK regulators labeled low confidence (i.e., RPS6KA1, RPS6KA4, ZAK, JAK1, and KSR1) were identified as viral helpers. PAK6 interference was also strongly affecting RABV replication, reducing Tha-GFP signal by 87%, as well as RPS6KA5 (RSK) interference, reducing Tha-GFP signal by 85% (Table 2 ). It should be noted that JNK/MAPK8 was identified as a viral helper with only 1 siRNA at both 18 and 36 h while extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/MAPK1 silencing was associated with cell toxicity (Table S1 and S2). Finally, genes associated with inositol phosphate metabolism also constituted the largest cluster observed at 36 h with 7 high-confidence hits (IMPAD1, NPP1, INPP5E, ITPKB, MINPP1, PIK3C2G, and PIP5K1C) among 17 hits (Fig. 3) . Among them, ITPKB interference reduced Tha-GFP signal by 70% whereas the other genes were associated with a 50% to 60% decrease of Tha-GFP signal ( Table 2) .",

First, we investigated a selection of highconfidence hits using the C911 method (33) to determine whether the inhibition of RABV could have been due to off-target effects (OTE) or if it was specific to the siRNA/target identified (Table S2) . Briefly, the C911 method is based on the design of mismatch siRNAs that carry OTE but lose on-target effects. We selected a single siRNA for high-confidence hits that are present at different levels in the MAPK pathway (MKK7/MAP2K7, DUSP5, and RPS6KA5) or the PI3K pathway (PIP5K1C, MTM1, MINPP1, and PIK3C2G) or that are involved in mRNA capping (PRPF4B and RNGTT) or are associated with various other cellular functions (NRBP2, NEK4, ERN1, and FYN). As the C911-modified siRNA should not affect the targets, we were able to demonstrate that the following hits were clearly subject to OTE: RPS6KA5, MINPP1, PIK3C2G, PRPF4B, RNGTT, and FYN (Fig. 6 ). Both siMAP2K7 (MKK7) and siDUSP5 of the MAPK pathway reached 100% inhibition compared to siGFP (Fig. 6) , a level significantly higher than that seen with their C911 target (P \u03fd 0.001). Both siPIP5K1C and siMTM1 of the phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P) pathway were seen to inhibit Tha-GFP compared to their C911 target (P \u03fd 0.05), providing 25% and 45% inhibition, respectively. Furthermore, NEK4 but not its C911 target (P \u03fd 0.05) inhibited 39% of Tha-GFP replication and both NRBP2 and ERN1 inhibited \u03f320% of Tha-GFP but the levels were not statistically significantly different from those seen with their C911 target (P \u03ed 0.054 and P \u03ed 0.103, respectively). NEK4, involved in replicative senescence, has never been found to be associated with host-virus interactions (34) . This confirmed that the hits identified in the RNAi screening-in particular, the hits from both the MAPK and phosphatydilinositol-3-phosphate (PI3P) pathways-are important for RABV replication.",

The latter was shown to be important for viral protein expression and infectious virus production after 24 h of infection. According to our results, NCL is indeed important, although not essential, for viral replication at the early stages of the infection; however, it is not required at the later stages (see Fig. S2 in the supplemental material). In a large-scale loss-of-function screening of murine differentiated neurons (29), the following 2 kinases among 63 hits were involved in later stages of RABV infection: Pick1 (PRKCA-binding protein) and FN3KRP (fructosamine 3 kinase-related protein). In our assay, only Pick1 was found to be a viral helper at both early and later stages of RABV infection with a single siRNA. As a protein adaptor for PDZ domain proteins playing a role in synapse trafficking, Pick1 could therefore be involved in the interaction of G protein with PDZ domain proteins MAST1/2 and PTPN4 in the control of cell survival (10) . Further, several PTPN proteins were identified as viral inhibitors in the later stages and that effect could be linked to the capacity of the G protein to interact with PTPN4. Finally, the proteins identified as involved in mitotic regulation (AURKA and BUB1B) are notably important for microtubule regulation and could have an impact on rabies virus transport (38) .",

It should be noted that although HEK293T cells lack Toll-like receptors (39), they have functioning RLRs and downstream pathways, and they are able to build up an IFN response (40) (41) (42) . The silencing of TPL2 and TBK1, both of which are linked to RABV escape of the immune system (18, 19) , had no effect on RABV replication. MAP2K6/MEK6, whose expression was shown to be repressed by Tha virus (15) , had no significant impact on viral replication. MAP3K14, or NIK, which is crucial for the induction of the noncanonical NF-B pathway (43) , is essential for RABV replication at later stages, while the canonical pathway was shown to be targeted by the M protein to escape the immune response (14, 15, 19) . This indicates that, unlike the canonical pathway, which is inhibited during RABV infection, the noncanonical NF-B pathway is important for RABV replication and the effect could be linked to its disturbance by M-RelAp43 interaction. Indeed, in a previous mass spectrometry analysis of RelAp43 interacting proteins, we found that the M-protein strikingly increases RelB and p100/p52 interaction with RelAp43 (19) . Finally, if we consider a less stringent 2 threshold for the selection of viral helpers, all proteins of the Janus kinase family (JAK1/2/3 and TYK2) had at least 1 siRNA effective at 18 h postinfection. This suggests a role in RABV replication of this protein family triggering the JAK/STAT pathway, inhibited downstream of JAK proteins by the P protein of RABV (16, 17) , as well as in regulating MAPK (44) .",

If we have demonstrated here a role of PI metabolism in the RABV infectious cycle for the first time, it has been previously found to be associated with both entry and egress for several viruses. Phosphatydilinositol-3,5biphosphate [PI(4,5)P 2 ] is required for foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV; Picornaviridae) and VSV (Rhabdoviridae) internalization (50) as well as Ebola virus (EBOV; Filoviridae) egress (51) , and PI(3)P was shown to affect influenza virus (Orthomyxoviridae) propagation (52) . PI kinases PI3K and PI4K3 are also required for EBOV and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV; Coronaviridae) entry, respectively (53, 54) . Further, PI(4)P and PI4K3 are also essential for the formation of the viral replication complex of Aichi virus (Picornaviridae) in organelles (55, 56) . In regard to closely related viruses such as VSV or EBOV, we can hypothesize that (i) several PI-related proteins playing an essential role at the early stages (MTM1, MTMR4, INPPL1, MINPP1, INPP5E, and PI3KC2G) are involved in RABV entry and that (ii) other PI-related proteins only affecting the later stages (IMPAD1, PIP5K1C, INPP1, and ITPKB) are involved in RABV egress. In particular, the PI-related proteins appear to all converge in the production of myo-inositol through I(3)P or I(4)P or I(3,4)P 2 or some combination thereof in the later stages (Fig. 5) .",

Interestingly, PKC has been previously shown to be important for the phosphorylation of RABV P protein (57) . Therefore, in accordance with the high sensitivity of the virus to PKC inhibitor Ro 31-8220, the importance of this mechanism for RABV replication should be considered and further investigated. PD 198306 is a MEK1/2 inhibitor and is also active with respect to effects on other cellular kinases (ERK, c-Src, CDKs, and PI3-kinase). Finally, wortmannin primarily targets PI3K but also cross-reacts with other effectors of the phosphatidyl-inositol metabolism (DNA-PKCs, ATR, and PI4K). As many of the secondary targets of Ro 31-8820, PD 198306, and wortmannin were also identified in the RNAi screening as part of the MAPK pathway (MAPKAP-K1b, MSK1, GSK3b, and ERK), the PIP pathway (S6K1, PI3K, and PI4K), and other pathways (c-Src, CDKs), it is difficult to conclude which affects RABV replication, and the answer is likely to involve a combination of several targets. However, the results from this assay were consistent with the idea of MAPK and PI3K being important for RABV infection in differentiated human neurons.",
