            "text": "Background: Should an emerging infectious disease outbreak or an environmental disaster occur, the collection of epidemiological data must start as soon as possible after the event's onset. Questionnaires are usually built de novo for each event, resulting in substantially delayed epidemiological responses that are detrimental to the understanding and control of the event considered. Moreover, the public health and/or academic institution databases constructed with responses to different questionnaires are usually difficult to merge, impairing necessary collaborations. We aimed to show that e-commerce concepts and software tools can be readily adapted to enable rapid collection of data after an infectious disease outbreak or environmental disaster. Here, the 'customers' are the epidemiologists, who fill their shopping 'baskets' with standardised questions. Methods: For each epidemiological field, a catalogue of questions is constituted by identifying the relevant variables based on a review of the published literature on similar circumstances. Each question is tagged with information on its source papers. Epidemiologists can then tailor their own questionnaires by choosing appropriate questions from this catalogue. The software immediately provides them with ready-to-use forms and online questionnaires. All databases constituted by the different EpiBasket users are interoperable, because the corresponding questionnaires are derived from the same corpus of questions. Results: A proof-of-concept prototype was developed for Knowledge, Attitudes and Practice (KAP) surveys, which is one of the fields of the epidemiological investigation frequently explored during, or after, an outbreak or environmental disaster. The catalogue of questions was initiated from a review of the KAP studies conducted during or after the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic. Conclusion: Rapid collection of standardised data after an outbreak or environmental disaster can be facilitated by transposing the e-commerce paradigm to epidemiology, taking advantage of the powerful software tools already available.",

Indeed, survey design and the elaboration of the corresponding questionnaires take time (2, 3) : unsatisfactory questionnaires can be obtained quickly, but have to be modified a few days later; conversely, excellent questionnaires can be generated after lengthy meetings, but become available too late. Moreover, any important public health problem inherently involves a variety of actors in public health and research. All these players have their own agendas, hypotheses to test, stakeholders to comply with. Each of them designs a different survey, with different questionnaires (4) . Finally, as a consequence, the information collected in the different surveys usually cannot be merged to provide a unified database, because the definitions and questionnaires used are not standardised (5, 6) .",

The basic concept underlying the software was to revisit with an epidemiologist's eye the consumer's e-commerce model used daily. Indeed, not so long ago, the process of getting same-day delivery to your door of the best product, after an informed choice about all those available, was unimaginable. Today, when a customer wants to buy, for example, a new homeentertainment audiovisual system, the internet quasiinstantaneously provides all the necessary information on all possible TVs, DVD players, hard disks, speakers, and so on from a variety of manufacturers. He can choose his desired elements from each of these categories, put them in a shopping basket, and review and modify his choices before making his final decision. Then, he checks out and his system can be delivered in hours. The success of e-commerce led to the development of powerful software, some of it free, that we used in this project.",

The 'categories of products' are the categories of questionnaire questions (e.g., the questions on the outcome of the household, life satisfaction, prevalidated scales for scoring stress). Information on which questions were used in the best high-profile papers published on similar events, information on all 'products' (i.e., questionnaire questions), will be available immediately. The epidemiologist devising his questionnaire will therefore be able to select from the 'catalogue' the best possible questions to meet his needs, put them in his 'shopping basket' and, once he has made up his mind, he 'buys' them and immediately gets his order, here the paper and/or the online version of the questionnaire. If the catalogue provides the best products on the 'epidemiological market', and if a community of researchers starts to collectively build and use this system, a positive byproduct should be the increased possibility of database interoperability because, in the future, epidemiologists working on the same subject will choose the questions for their questionnaires from the same catalogue.",

The manual extraction of those variables that we performed to build the prototype could subsequently be automated, with natural languageanalysis tools (8) 'reading' the tables, figures and their corresponding legends.

Now, using 'root terms', it is formatted as 'In the case of #$DISEASE outbreak, would you avoid going to #$PLACE?', where #$DISEASE and #$PLACE are the root terms to be instantiated by the user selecting this question template, for example, 'In the case of a cholera outbreak, would you avoid going to a restaurant?'

The underlying assumption is that, when the user will have to choose among several questions (e.g., choosing among several scales available for scoring burnout), the one with the best 'value' will be retained. Since such a logical view is likely to be followed by most EpiBasket users, EpiBasket should facilitate better standardisation of questionnaires. At present, we arbitrarily decided to give to a question the value defined as the 'Best IF', that is, the highest journal IF encountered among all papers using it. This choice assumes that, if the user has to choose between two burnout scales, the one previously published in a high-profile journal will be preferred. As a consequence of this valuing system, all demographic variables (e.g., age, sex) get a high value (because they are used in all papers, including those published in journals with very high IF). IF can be systematically obtained from the Journal Citation Reports database, for which a fee must be paid. However, most journals provide their IF on their websites and we used those values in the prototype (see the Supplementary file). The value of 0.000 was arbitrarily assigned to questions published in journals not indexed in the Journal Citation Reports database.

The pdf format is available for epidemiologists wanting to conduct a paper-and-pencil survey. The csv format is proposed to those planning an online survey: users can directly import their csv file and initiate the corresponding survey online in EpiBasket (http://www. epibasket.org/limesurvey/admin/index.html). The user can also install on his own server LimeSurvey (9), freeware designed for building and deploying online surveys, and run the survey on this server.

All 'orders' and 'invoices' are replaced by 'questionnaires'. Moreover, user account-information features used in ecommerce, such as ('my credit slips', 'my vouchers', 'my personal info', and so on) required substantial modifications/suppressions/additions. For example, in EpiBasket, the 'orders' attached to a given user are 'my questionnaires', that is, those ordered since his initial registration in the EpiBasket site. We also developed a specific source code to allow a user account to propose the implementation of a new question in the EpiBasket catalogue. All these adaptations required numerous and substantial code-source changes of the original e-commerce software.",

A questionnaire written in XML can easily be converted to paper (pdf format), enabling rapid deployment of paper-and-pencil surveys, whereas the converted csv file can be directly imported into the LimeSurvey freeware, enabling rapid deployment of an online survey. LimeSurvey (13) is an open-source online-survey application written in PHP, based on a MySQL, PostgreSQL or MSSQL database, and distributed under the GNU General Public License. It is particularly user friendly, as it enables users to develop and publish surveys, and collect responses, without doing any coding (14) .

The strength of our approach is that it relies on and takes full advantage of past knowledge and experiences in similar events. The goal is not only avoiding that epidemiologists 'reinvent the wheel' when they are faced with situations similar, or partly similar, to those the past. It also strives to indirectly encourage more standardised and better quality questionnaires. Another indirect attribute of the proposed approach is to promote interactions among epidemiologists. Indeed, despite informatics advances, which make it easy, at least in theory, to devise databases easily sharable and accessible from any place, the fact is that, in practice, this is not yet reality (15) . The main reason is likely to be found in human factors. However, the tool we present has integrated the potential to stimulate collaborative approaches. For example, the 'EpiBasket store' can host a public depository for existing questionnaires, which are very rarely made available by authors in their papers.",

They represent a small part of the epidemiological investigations done during/after an outbreak and a full-size EpiBasket should provide questions for all fields concerned. After the 2003 SARS epidemic, we identified (7) at total 10 fields other than KAP belonging to three categories: Investigation and Surveillance (four fields: description of the outbreak, search for causative agents, transmission studies, risk factors), case management (five fields: clinical presentation, diagnosis, treatment and medical interventions, prognosis, medical decision-making), and prevention and control. Thus, the EpiBasket prototype described herein is far from what a full-size 'EpiBasket' could be. The design and computer implementation of that ideal project would require a workforce (i.e., epidemiologists and software engineers) that exceeds the resources of a single research group. We think the software aspect is likely the easiest, as it was shown here that the efforts already made in the profitable field of e-commence can be relatively easily adapted to epidemiology. The future editorial and organisational aspects are much more difficult to foresee. The editorial work covers the definitions of the means applied to 'value' the questions. For the prototype, we chose the best journal IF among published papers on similar events that used the question. It is also possible, for example, that an Editorial Committee would prefer a mechanism according high values to questions submitted by experts in the field. In that scenario, coding recommendations should certainly be made by subcommittees. One of the organisational issues concerns copyrighted questionnaires, particularly those that are available only for a fee. The current EpiBasket version does not address such issues.",
