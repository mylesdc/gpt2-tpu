Contact events were measured with a spatial resolution of about 1.5 meters and a temporal resolution of 20 seconds. The study included 46 HCWs and 29 patients and lasted for 4 days and 4 nights. 14,037 contacts were recorded overall, 94.1% of which during daytime. The number and duration of contacts varied between mornings, afternoons and nights, and contact matrices describing the mixing patterns between HCW and patients were built for each time period. Contact patterns were qualitatively similar from one day to the next. 38% of the contacts occurred between pairs of HCWs and 6 HCWs accounted for 42% of all the contacts including at least one patient, suggesting a population of individuals who could potentially act as super-spreaders.",

The collected data can provide information on important aspects that impact the spreading patterns of infectious diseases, such as the strong heterogeneity of contact numbers and durations across individuals, the variability in the number of contacts during a day, and the fraction of repeated contacts across days. This variability is however associated with a marked statistical stability of contact and mixing patterns across days. Our results highlight the need for such measurement efforts in order to correctly inform mathematical models of HAIs and use them to inform the design and evaluation of prevention strategies.",

The accurate description of contact patterns between individuals is crucial to this end, as it can help to understand the possible transmission dynamics and the design principles for appropriate control measures. In particular, the mutual exposures between patients and health-care workers (HCWs) have been documented for bacterial and viral transmission since decades [1, 2, 3] . Transmission might be the result of effective contact, as in the cases of S. aureus [4, 5] , K. pneumoniae [6] or rotavirus [7] , of exposure to contaminated aerosols, as for M. tuberculosis [8] , or the result of exposure to droplets, as for influenza [9] . Some pathogens such as influenza can also be transmitted by different routes. Although close-range proximity and contacts between individuals are strong determinants for potential transmissions, obtaining reliable data on these behaviors remains a challenge [10] .",

These approaches provide essential information to describe contacts patterns and inform models of infectious disease spread. The gathered data, however, often lack the longitudinal dimension [10, 12, 16] and the high spatial and temporal resolution needed to accurately characterize the interactions among individuals in specific environments such as hospitals. Moreover, they are subject to potential biases due to behavioral modifications due to the presence of observers, to short periods of observation, and especially to missing information and recall biases.

The power level is tuned so that devices can exchange packets only when located within 1-1.5 meters of one another, i.e., package exchange is used as a proxy for distance (the tags do not directly measure distances). Individuals were asked to wear the devices on their chests using lanyards, ensuring that the RFID devices of two individuals can only exchange radio packets when the persons are facing each other, as the human body acts as a RF shield at the frequency used for communication. In summary the system is tuned so that it detects and records close-range encounters during which a communicable disease infection could be transmitted, for example, by cough, sneeze or hand contact. The information on face-to-face proximity events detected by the wearable sensors is relayed to radio receivers installed throughout the hospital ward (bedrooms, offices and hall).",

We therefore define two individuals to be in ''contact'' during a 20-second interval if and only if their sensors exchanged at least one packet during that interval. A contact is therefore symmetric by definition, and in case of contacts involving three or more individuals in the same 20-second interval, all the contact pairs were considered. After the contact is established, it is considered ongoing as long as the devices continue to exchange at least one packet for every subsequent 20 s interval. Conversely, a contact is considered broken if a 20-second interval elapses with no exchange of packets. We emphasize that this is an operational definition of the human proximity behavior that we choose to quantify, and that all the results we present correspond to this precise and specific definition of ''contact''.

Numbers and duration of contacts were characterized for each class of individuals and for individuals belonging to given class pairs, yielding contact matrices that represent important inputs for realistic computational models of nosocomial infections. As also measured in other contexts [17, 20, 21, 23, 27] , the numbers and durations of contacts display large variations even across individuals of the same class: the resulting distributions were broad, with no characteristic time scale. As a consequence, even though the average durations of contacts were rather short, contacts of much longer durations than average occured with nonnegligible frequency.",

Our results show that the cumulated number of contacts and the number of distinct persons contacted are correlated; this indicates that in the hospital context under study the super-contactors have contacts with many different patients. They could therefore potentially play the role of super-spreaders, whose importance in the spread of infectious agents has been highlighted both theoretically [29, 30] and empirically [31] .

In this respect, the investigation of the temporal evolution of the numbers of contacts may help envision and discuss changes in the organization of care during epidemic or pandemic periods. The numbers of contacts varied indeed greatly along the course of each day, clearly highlighting the periods of the day (here, the mornings) during which transmission could occur with higher probability. The high numbers of contacts during mornings may indicate a potential overexposure to infection for PATs and NURs, and one may imagine a different organization toward a smoothing of the number of contacts throughout mornings and afternoons. This would decrease the density of contacts, in particular between NURs, at each specific moment, while maintaining the daily number and duration of contacts between NURs and PATs, and overall tend to limit their overexposure [35] . The potential efficacy of such or other changes in the healthcare organization should of course be tested through numerical simulations of spreading phenomena, and their feasibility would moreover need to be asserted through discussions with the staff. The measurement of contact patterns by means of wearable sensors presents strengths and limitations that are worth discussing. Strong advantages are the versatility of the sensing strategy (i.e., the unobtrusiveness of wearable sensors and the prompt deployability of receivers) and the fact that it does neither require the constant presence of external observers nor interfere with the delivery of care in the ward. Another strength lies in the high spatial and temporal resolution: behavioral differences across role classes can be detected, and longitudinal studies are possible. High participation ratios are also crucial: similarly to a previous study in another hospital [23] , the rate of acceptance among HCWs and patients turned out to be very high (92%). The information meetings held before the study, providing a clear exposition of the scientific objectives and of the privacy aspects, most probably played an important role in achieving such a high participation rate.",

The use of close-range proximity as a proxy for the transmission of bacterial infection acquired by cross transmission, such as S aureus or Enterobacteriacea, is more questionable. Other factors related to specific attributes of individuals (e.g., vaccination or immunosuppression), of the microbial agent (e.g., resistance or virulence) or of the environment (e.g., specialty of ward) may also alter the relationship between contact frequency/duration and transmission.

Models of transmission within hospitals might be based on contact matrices such as those presented here, and used to better understand the epidemiology of different types of microbial agents, to assess the impact of control measures, and to help improve the delivery of care during emergency epidemic situations. In our study, specific mixing patterns were observed between different classes of individuals, showing a clear departure from homogeneous mixing, as it is expected in a hospital setting, and highlighting the relevance of correctly informed contact matrices. Moreover, although an important turnover between the persons in contact with a given individual was observed across different days, and although the average contact durations between different classes of individuals varied between mornings, afternoons and nights, the contact patterns remained statistically very similar across successive days. These results suggest that, in order to correctly inform computational models, data collected over just a few hours might be insufficient, but that measures lasting 48 hours would be sufficient to evaluate the statistical properties of contact patterns as well as the mixing patterns between individual classes, and to estimate the similarity between the contacts of an individual across days.

Combining these heterogeneous sources of information within appropriate statistical models would allow elucidating the relation between the risk of disease transmission and contacts patterns, in order to disentangle transmission likelihood from contact frequency. Finally, feedback of the results to HCWs could be an innovative pedagogical tool in health care settings.",

In the second line, the matrix entry at row X and column Y gives the average number (resp. duration) of contacts of an individual of class X with individuals of class Y, during the whole study. In the third line, we normalize each matrix element of the second line matrices by the duration of the study, in days, to obtain average daily numbers and durations of the contacts of an individual of class X with any individual of class Y. The asymmetry of the matrices in the second and third lines is due to the different numbers of individuals populating each class.
