The pathogenesis of SONFH is unclear, so the early diagnosis and treatment for this disease is yet to be established. The purpose of the present study was to identify potential biomarkers for SONFH. The differential expression of serum proteins from patients with SONFH and healthy volunteers was analyzed by the proteomics method. The protein samples were labeled and subjected to isoelectric focusing and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. The resultant protein spots were matched and quantified by an imaging analysis system. The differentially-expressed protein spots were subjected to in-gel trypsin digestion followed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Significantly lower levels of complement component 3 (C3), C4, inter-\u03b1-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain H4 and \u03b1-2-macroglobulin were found in the serum of patients with SONFH. These proteins are reported to be actively involved in intravascular coagulation, apoptosis and reactive oxygen species imbalance, indicating that multiple pathological reactions occur in SONFH and these proteins may serve as potential biomarkers for the diagnosis of SONFH.",

The functions of the hip joint are markedly impaired when the femoral head collapses. Glucocorticoid (GC) therapy was the most common cause of ONFH (2) . The onset of SONFH is within several months following the administration of steroids. Regardless of continuous steroid administration, no expansion of the necrotic area was found, and recurrence was not identified. Due to ischemia, patients have no symptoms when SONFH occurs. No pain is noted until the femoral head collapses. Approximately 5-25% of patients using GC develop SONFH in the legs. Notably, in China 53.5% of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome prescribed GC developed femoral head osteonecrosis, and the SONFH comprises approximately half of non-traumatic femoral head necrosis. In total, >50% of patients with femoral head osteonecrosis admitted to The Third Affiliated Hospital (Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China) between January 2000 and January 2010 had a history of using GC, the majority of whom were young males. At present, patients with SONFH already exceed 10 million in China. However, the pathogenesis of this disease remains largely unknown, so the prevention and treatment have yet to be established.",

The mean steroid dose in equivalent milligrams of prednisone was 850 mg (range, 290-3300 mg). The mean time from administration of steroids to the development of hip symptoms was 16.6 months (range, 6-33 months), but none of them fulfilled the diagnosis criteria of rheumatoid arthritis.",

However, limited studies have systematically elucidated the mechanism by which the immune system affects SONFH. Wu et al (14) showed that the complement factor C3 precursor is elevated in the serum of patients with ONFH. This previous study showed that complement factor C3 precursor plays an important role in the homeostasis of inflammation, necrosis or apoptosis in ONFH. The present results show that complement activation is reduced in patients with SONFH. This may be attributed to the immunosuppressive effect of steroids. Excess steroids can suppress complement activation and immune complex formation (15) . Familian et al (16) found that plasma levels of C3 and C4 increased in the majority of patients with rheumatoid arthritis prior to therapy, but significantly decreased following the start of infliximab (an immunosuppressive agent) treatment.

Pineiro et al (20) showed that in humans, ITIH4 mRNA and the secreted protein are highly upregulated by IL-6 in HepG2 hepatoma cells.

Small amounts of A2MG are also produced by a number of other cells, including lung fibroblasts, macrophages, astrocytes and tumor cells (23, 24) . A2MG functions as a broad irreversible proteinase inhibitor and is involved in various physiological processes (25, 26) . A2MG regulates several key factors of SONFH. The conformational change can activate A2MG, resulting in exposure of binding sites for its cell surface receptor, including the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein. Upon binding A2MG-proteinase complexes from the extracellular matrix are rapidly removed, which blocks lipid catabolism (27) . A2MG modulates blood coagulation. As reported by Simpson et al (28) , A2MG significantly enhanced plasmin generation. However, A2MG binds vascular endothelial growth factor and the resultant A2MG-complex inhibits heparin activity, leading to elevated coagulation. Human A2MG has been verified to effectively decrease the release of superoxide radicals by polynuclear leukocytes following radiation. The activity of superoxide dismutase in red cells can also be increased. The free radicals and MMP imbalance exist in the pathological process of SONFH. Kerachian et al (29) demonstrated that the A2MG gene is significantly upregulated in avascular necrosis of the rat femoral head induced with steroids. Along with those findings, the present study showed that A2MG was significantly lower in the bone tissue of patients with SONFH. Lower A2MG may affect the process of SONFH through Figure 4 .
