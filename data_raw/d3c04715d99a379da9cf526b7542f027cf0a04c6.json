Febrile neutropenia is associated with long hospitalization [3] [4] [5] which has negative social effects for the child and its family [6] . In addition, hospitalization and the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics increase the patient's risk of subsequent infection with antibiotic-resistant bacteria [7, 8] and fungal infections [9, 10] . A better understanding of the etiology of febrile neutropenia is thus needed in order to decrease unnecessary hospitalization and excessive antibiotic use.",

Advances in molecular methods have increased the sensitivity of viral diagnostics tests, with recent studies reporting the detection of respiratory viruses in the nasopharynx in 44-57% of childhood febrile neutropenia episodes using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) [3] [4] [5] 12] . However, the clinical significance of positive PCR findings is unclear, as respiratory viruses have also been detected in asymptomatic immunocompetent children [13] [14] [15] [16] . In addition, some respiratory viruses can be detected weeks after the first infection, which is suggestive of prolonged viral shedding [17, 18] . Here, we describe the results of a longitudinal study involving repeated sampling and the assessment of a broad panel of respiratory viruses by PCR to clarify whether respiratory viruses play a causal role in childhood febrile neutropenia.",

All the patients who met the criteria for febrile neutropenia were asked to participate. Patients could be enrolled multiple times if recurrent episodes of febrile neutropenia occurred during the study period. To be enrolled for a new episode, the patient needed to have been afebrile for more than 72 hours and have completed the antibiotic treatment for the previous episode of febrile neutropenia. Febrile neutropenia was defined as a body temperature of 38.5\u00b0C on one occasion or 38.0\u00b0C on two occasions at least 60 minutes apart, combined with an absolute neutrophil count of either 0.5\u00d710 9 /L on one occasion or 1.0\u00d710 9 /L with a decline to less than 0.5\u00d710 9 /L over a subsequent 48-hour period. Oral and written information regarding the study were provided to each patient prior to enrollment, and signed consents were obtained from their caretakers.

A semiquantitative assay was used and the actual Cycle thresholds-values (Ct-values) were provided, however, the NPA has not been validated for quantitative data. In all study subjects who initially tested positive for one or more respiratory viruses, a follow-up sample was collected at the time of their next visit to the hospital. This follow-up sample was collected regardless of the patient's absolute neutrophil count or symptoms and was analyzed in the same manner as the first sample. However, if the patient had a new episode of febrile neutropenia at the time of the follow-up, this sample was considered both a follow-up sample and a new episode sample, which required an additional follow-up sample if the new episode tested positive for a respiratory virus.",

Briefly, viral RNA was extracted as described above for most samples, but the RNeasy Lipid Tissue Mini Kit (Qiagen, Sollentuna, Sweden) was used for samples that were negative in the VP4/VP2 PCR after MagAttract extraction. The RNA was used for the nested reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR with One-step Superscript-Platinum Taq (Life Technologies, Stockholm, Sweden) for the first (outer) PCR, and Platinum Taq for the second (nested) PCR. Sequencing was done on an ABI 3730 instrument and the RV/EV species and type was determined by maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees constructed using PhyML [22] and the sequences have been deposited in GenBank under accession numbers KX15472-KX154585 for RV-A and KX290514-KX290520 for RV-C. Two of the RV-C samples were not submitted to the GenBank because the sequences were of suboptimal quality due to a probable infection with more than one RV genotype.",

These results support the theory holding that there is a causal relationship between respiratory viral infections and episodes of febrile neutropenia, but proving this theory will require more longitudinal studies with asymptomatic neutropenic control cohorts. In addition, prolonged viral persistence with regard to these respiratory tract infections seems to be uncommon in children undergoing chemotherapy for the treatment for malignancies.",

The clinical significance of a single time-point PCR finding of certain pathogens has been debated. Studies on immunocompetent children have reported that viruses such as HBoV, HCoV, and RV are detected in asymptomatic children at rates ranging between 27-40% [13] [14] [15] [16] , which could be suggestive of prolonged viral shedding from an earlier infection or the incubation period prior to a symptomatic- [17] , or asymptomatic infection [13, 14, 17] . To clarify this issue, more longitudinal studies with appropriate control groups are needed. Rhedin et al. conducted a case-control study to investigate the etiologic role of respiratory viruses in a group of children with respiratory tract symptoms seeking medical care at a pediatric emergency center [13] . The control group consisted of children on routine visits to child welfare centers for vaccination within the childhood immunization program. The detection rate of respiratory viruses in the control group was high (35.4%) with RV and HCoV the most commonly detected viruses in asymptomatic children and HMPV, PIV and RSV detected only rarely. The authors concluded that HMPV, PIV and RSV play an etiologic role and suggested that findings of RV and HCoV must be carefully interpreted [13] .We chose a longitudinal design for the present study, and found that 78% of the infections had resolved by the median follow-up time of 28 days. In addition, two of the RV infections identified at follow-up represented new species of RV from the previous infection, which increases the proportion of resolved infections to 84%.",

However, the use of a longitudinal design allowed us to collect follow-up samples from patients both with and without respiratory symptoms. Only five patients at the first sampling and two patients at follow-up sampling were positive for a respiratory virus without the presence of respiratory symptoms, which suggests that the frequency of asymptomatic infections is low in this group of patients. Interestingly, RV was detected in five of these seven episodes and HCoV was detected in the other two, which are in line with other studies [13] . The presence of respiratory symptoms was significantly higher in the episodes involving only respiratory viral infection, compared with both episodes involving only septicemia and fever of unknown origin, with symptoms appearing with the onset of fever in the majority of the episodes. Peck et al. investigated the incidence of respiratory virus in patients receiving a hematopoietic stem cell transplant using longitudinally collected respiratory tract samples regardless of symptoms [27] . In line with our results, a majority of the respiratory viruses detected could be correlated with respiratory tract symptoms, with the exception of PIV, which was detected in asymptomatic patients. Infection with RV or HCoV was not investigated in that study. In addition, high viral loads were correlated to more symptoms. Our real-time-PCR technique was not validated for use in reporting clinical viral loads; thus the presented Ct-values must be interpreted with extreme caution. Nevertheless, the Ct-values <30 observed in 27 of the 39 episodes of febrile neutropenia are suggestive of high viral loads ( Table 2) . Considered together, our data suggests that respiratory viruses play an etiologic role in febrile neutropenia, but our results should be interpreted carefully, especially those regarding RV, which is commonly detected in asymptomatic patients [13] .",

            "text": "Respiratory viruses and their shedding times have not been thoroughly investigated in immunosuppressed children. Earlier studies on RSV have shown prolonged viral shedding in immunosuppressed children compared with healthy children [32] . Martin et al. conducted a longitudinal study of healthy immunocompetent children attending a daycare center [33] and found prolonged shedding (i.e., persistent virus >7 days) of all viruses examined except Flu A and B. Jartti et al. reported shedding times of 2-3 and 5-6 weeks for EV and RV, respectively, in immunocompetent children [17] . However, RV was not sequenced in that study; therefore, it is unclear whether the sample at 5 weeks represented the same or a new genotype of RV. Another study reported that prolonged persistence (>30 days) of the same RV strain is uncommon (<5%) [34] . Shedding times were of special interest in our cohort of immunosuppressed children because viral shedding necessitates isolation from other immunosuppressed children. The design of our present study did not allow us to determine the exact shedding time, which is a major limitation. However, the clearance of all viruses except RV-A and HCoV at a median follow-up time of 28 days, together with respiratory symptoms appearing at the time of fever onset in a majority of the patients, suggests that the shedding time for viruses such as Flu, HMPV, RSV and PIV is limited. The same RV genotypes were detected from follow-up samples in four episodes, with a follow-up time of 12-51 days. Furthermore, five patients positive for RV reported symptom appearance 6 days or longer before fever onset. That could indicate longer shedding times for RV, which is in line with results from studies on immunocompetent children [17] . However, this needs to be addressed in additional studies with repeated followup sampling, preferable on a weekly basis.",
