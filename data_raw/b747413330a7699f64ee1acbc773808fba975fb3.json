Fourteen (1%) untreated patients returned, and 3 were hospitalized on oseltamivir (median ILI-score = 19). Of 371 patients tested by RT-PCR, 104 (28%) had pandemic influenza and 42 (11%) had seasonal influenza A detected. Twenty (91%) of 22 imaged hospitalized pandemic influenza patients had bilateral infiltrates compared to 23 (38%) of 61 imaged hospital test-negative patients (p,0.001).

Illness attack rates may be higher among most age groups during pandemics than observed for seasonal influenza due to limited immunity among exposed populations [4] .

            "text": "Key features of pandemic influenza planning are developing strategies to meet expected increased demand for patient care, and how to allocate limited resources, including ventilators and critical care [6] [7] [8] [9] . Guidance has been developed for clinical triage of patients with ILI, including special populations (e.g. children, pregnant women), during a pandemic [10] [11] [12] . A key clinical decision is determining which ill persons can be managed as outpatients and which require hospitalization. Scoring systems, with varying predictive power, have been developed to determine who will require hospitalization, need ICU care, require a ventilator, or is at high risk of death (e.g. CURB-65) [13] [14] [15] . The emergence of 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus has presented a great challenge for clinicians throughout the world [16] . Overwhelming demand for medical care by patients with ILI and limited availability of oseltamivir necessitated that clinicians rapidly triage patients for outpatient care or hospital admission. These challenges are compounded by the need for early oseltamivir treatment of influenza patients for optimal efficacy [17] . At the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara, Fray Antonio Alcalde (HCGFAA), Mexico, clinicians from the Adult Infectious Diseases Unit used a modified ILI scoring system to systematically triage adult patients with respiratory complaints and determine who would be prioritized for hospitalization and antivirals. We describe this triaging system during the peak 2009 pandemic in Guadalajara (April-August, 2009).",

In response to high demand for emergency medical services among adult patients with acute respiratory complaints, infectious disease specialists implemented an ILI scoring system on April 25, 2009. This scoring system was adapted from a system developed by Hak et al in the United States for hospitalization decision-making among elderly patients with pneumonia or influenza during influenza epidemics [18] . In the emergency room (ER), a questionnaire was used to record patients' demographics, signs and symptoms, history of health care utilization, chronic medical conditions, laboratory, and radiology findings to calculate patients' ILI-scores ( Figure 1 ). Clinicians used an ILI-score $16 (high-risk), their judgment of patients' severity of illness and proximity to the hospital to decided whether to admit the patient and treat them with oseltamivir. Patients with intermediate ILI-scores (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) were discharged from the ER, treated with oseltamivir and followed daily by phone for 10 days. Those with low ILI-scores (#6) were discharged without antiviral treatment, and instructed to return if their symptoms worsened.",

            "text": "During 6 weeks when there was co-circulation of pandemic and seasonal influenza A viruses in the community, hospital staff triaged more than eighteen-hundred patients with respiratory complaints and identified 12% for inpatient care. The triage system was based on assumptions about who is at risk for developing complications from seasonal influenza (e.g. patients aged over 65 years). Our analyses, however, suggested that patients infected with 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) tended to be younger than seasonal influenza A patients. Nevertheless, our data suggest that clinicians used the ILI-score to help them determine, with minimal misclassification, which patients needed hospitalization versus who could be managed as outpatients [18] . The ILI-score helped guide clinicians to decide who needed hospital care and antiviral treatment when timely laboratory confirmation of influenza was not available. Only 1% of patients triaged needed re-evaluation. Such a system could be readily used to efficiently triage patients during outbreaks and epidemics by adapting the system's scores to match the anticipated characteristics of patients who are at highest risk of developing complications. While the triaging system led clinicians to hospitalize traditional groups at risk for complications from seasonal influenza (i.e. those with chronic medical illnesses), patients infected with 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) were often young and had few pre-existing conditions [20] . These data are comparable with Mexican Directorate General of Epidemiology data that suggest 56% of pandemic (H1N1) confirmed deaths occurred among those aged 30-59 years, many of whom were previously healthy [21] . The age shift in 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) cases may be caused by cross-reactive immunity from prior influenza infections in 33% of those aged more than 60 years [22, 23] . Health officials should adjust pandemic triaging tools to account for the younger age distribution of cases [24] . Pregnancy should also be included as a risk factor in triaging tools. Although there were too few pregnant women in our case series for subgroup analyses, other data suggest pregnant women are at high risk of developing severe complications from 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) [25] .",

Similarly, no ambulatory patients treated with oseltamivir required further medical care. In contrast, 3 patients initially discharged from the ED without oseltamivir returned to triage and required hospital admission. Two of these 3 later tested positive for 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1). One additional patient who required mechanical ventilation and subsequently died had presented 6 days after symptom onset. Another 5 hospital decedent whose care was transferred to the infectious disease service and therefore not part of our triaged case-series presented a median of 15 days after symptom onset. These cases suggest the importance of early oseltamivir treatment. Only one (1%) of 104 patients who tested positive for 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) case-patients died. These findings contrast those of the National Institute of Respiratory Diseases in Mexico City where 12 (67%) of 18 patients required mechanical ventilation and 7 (39%) patients died [24, 26] . The discrepancy between these two case-series may be explained by when the populations served by these hospitals were affected by the pandemic. National Institute of Respiratory Diseases data were collected during March 24-April 24, 2009, when it was still unclear that a proportion of cases with severe acute respiratory infections had 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1). In Guadalajara, the outbreak started later. Hospitalized patients we described received earlier oseltamivir. Our patients were hospitalized during April 25-August 9. Seventy-five percent of our case-patients received oseltamivir within 72 hours of symptom onset. Patients in the Mexico City case-series presented with severe disease an average of 8 days after illness onset and received late oseltamivir.",

With some adaptation, the system may be especially useful in resource-poor countries, during the peak of pandemic influenza, or during other respiratory virus activity. Although no scoring system will replace clinical judgment, our experience suggests that the triaging system may have helped clinicians effectively triage patients and determine who needed hospital care and who could be managed as outpatients. The triaging system and the ILI-score should be modified to the local 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) situation based upon hospital surge capacity, antiviral susceptibilities and supply, and the evolving epidemiology of this virus.",
