HealthMap is part of a new generation of online systems designed to monitor and visualize, on a real-time basis, disease outbreak alerts as reported by online news media and public health sources. HealthMap is of specific interest for national and international public health organizations and international travelers. A particular task that makes such a surveillance useful is the automated discovery of the geographic references contained in the retrieved outbreak alerts. This task is sometimes referred to as \"geo-parsing\". A typical approach to geo-parsing would demand an expensive training corpus of alerts manually tagged by a human.",

These data have been credited with providing early evidence of disease event, such as SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and avian influenza [1] . The availability of open source and freely available technology has spawned a new generation of disease \"mashups\" that scour the web and provide real-time outbreak information. HealthMap [2, 3] is one such system that monitors, analyzes and disseminates disease outbreak alerts in news media from all around the world. Each hour, the system automatically queries over 20,000 sources using news aggregators such as Google News, for relevant reports. It filters the retrieved documents into sev-eral taxonomies and provides on its website, http:// www.HealthMap.org, a geographic and disease-based display of the ongoing alerts. HealthMap provides a starting point for real-time intelligence on a broad range of emerging infectious diseases, and is designed for a diverse set of users, including public health officials and international travelers [4, 5] .",

This information is needed for the precise geographic mapping, as well as for the identification/characterization of the particular disease outbreak described in the alert. Indeed each alert is uniquely characterized by its disease category, a set period in time and its precise geographic location. A good characterization of the outbreak allows the system to discriminate between duplications of an alert and new alerts. It is also essential for the evaluation of the system and for longterm analysis. Most importantly, the automated high resolution geographic assignment of alerts aids rapid triaging of important information by system users, including public agencies such as the World Health Organization and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that use these data as part of their daily surveillance efforts.",

The system uses a rule-based approach relying on a specially crafted gazetteer, which was built incrementally by adding relevant geographic phrases extracted from the specific kind of news report intended for mapping. The approach consists in a look-up tree algorithm which tries to find a match between the sequences of words in the alert and the sequences of words in the entries of the gazetteer. It also implements a set of rules which use the position of the phrase in the alert to decide whether or not the phrase is related to the reported disease.",

The approach presented in the following section is an attempt at producing a geoparser using the prior knowledge encoded in the gazetteer as a base. At first glance, it would seem that in order to increase the resolution of the HealthMap geo-parser, expanding the size of the gazetteer should be enough. However in our experience, adding new terms to the gazetteer, without careful supervision often results in an upsurge of false positives for the system. The ability to predict statistically if a word in a sentence is a geographic reference is a valuable feature for a geo-parser. Indeed no matter the size of the gazetteer, it cannot contain every geographic reference, and even words in the gazetteer might be false positives in the alert (Canada geese). The typical way of obtaining a statistical predictor is to have access to annotated training data. However, data annotation is a very time consuming and expensive task, and thus the approach we present is an attempt at circumventing it by using the already available gazetteer.",

This reader would infer the semantic role of the phrase with a certain accuracy, because he has prior knowledge of the syntactic context in which geographic references appear, maybe also of their particular character distribution or the fact that they generally begin with a capital letter, etc. Our approach in some sense simulates this situation with a learning algorithm in the guise of an artificial \"reader.\" We use the HealthMap gazetteer as the supervision (or reference) for training the reader. Some of the location words in the training texts are purposely hidden from the reader's vocabulary in order to divert the attention of the learning algorithm to the context on which these words appears instead of the words themselves. Previous related natural language processing approaches reported in the literature, like ours, use a limited knowledge base to generate a broader one.",

Indeed, naively deciding to hide the words tagged as location by the HealthMap gazetteer would be equivalent to giving away the label information to the learning algorithm. It would lead it to learn \"by heart\" what it is that the gazetteer considers a location, while what we are interested in is making it discover new location patterns. The strategy we implemented is based on the idea that words referring to specific locations have a lower frequency (ie number of occurrences/corpus size) (average frequency = 4.9/10 5 (\u00b1 12.3/10 5 )) in the corpus than \"typical\" words (average frequency = 8.9/10 5 (\u00b1 103.3/10 5 )). For example, the word authorities appears 268 times in our 1,000 alerts corpus (\u2248 355,000 words) while, the word Australia appears only 38 times. Continuing the metaphor of the artificial reader, we decide to cut words out of its vocabulary indiscriminately, based solely on their frequency. We make the reasonable assumption that if a word is rare then it is less likely to be \"known\" by the reader. Figure 3 shows that applying this strategy indeed leads to hiding more location words than \"typical\" words. As shown in the figure, for a given word's frequency cutoff, the percentage of hidden words out of all words in the corpus (first bar) is lower than the percentage of hidden location words out of all location words (second bar). The graph shows, for example, that cutting words that appear with a frequency lower than 2.8 \u00d7 1e -5 , hides roughly 10% of the words in the corpus, but close to 25% of the location word occurrences (\u2248 2-3% of the words in the corpus are location words). Lets us call this lower bound on the word frequency \u03bb. We apply \u03bb onto the corpus to decide whether or not a word index is to be hidden, so that only frequent word indices are visible to the model. Another justification of our approach is the following. The list of words present in the training set represents the largest vocabulary the algorithm has access to. In general, it would seem a good idea to diversify and augment this vocabulary, by increasing the size of the training set, so that the algorithm is presented with examples of Words sparse representation Figure 2 Words sparse representation. Each word in the dictionary, its part-of-speech in the text and its capitalization status are associated with 3 indexes in the representation. If a word is out of the dictionary, it will only be represented by its part-ofspeech and capitalization status. usage of the new words -as is typically done in a fully supervised approach. Since we do not have access to fully annotated corpora, but rely on a finite gazetteer to label the data, increasing the size of the training set would eventually be redundant. From another point of view, no matter the size of the training set, there is no guarantee that all words in a new set of texts will fall within the algorithm's dictionary. As an example, Figure 4 shows the percentage of out-of-vocabulary words among the unique words of an evaluation set, for several vocabulary sizes. Our approach reduces the dictionary available to the learning algorithm, placing it, during the training, in the situation that it would eventually face when confronted with new data. In particular, since we reduce the dictionary in a way that respects the distribution of words, we make the hypothesis that the location words that we purposely keep out of the dictionary can work as surrogates of the new location words we want to discover.",

On the other hand, however, the increase in out-of-dictionary examples greatly improves the ability of the system to correctly identify locations that are out of the algorithm's dictionary (dashdotted blue line), ability that is non-existent when the whole training set vocabulary is available to the learning algorithm (\u03bb = 0).

The 3 graphs in Fig. 6 show that the word-withholding strategy has mainly a positive effect on the accuracy of the NN geoparsers. While there is a decrease in precision, when the number of \"hidden\" words increases, the recall increases enough that their combination in the F 1 score is higher than when the whole training vocabulary is used. Augmenting the size of the training set, as can also be seen in Table 1 , also has a positive effect on the performance. However this positive effect seems to reach a plateau, since by doubling the number of alerts between T 1 and T 2 we only see a small improvement in F 1 score.",

Such precise information extraction typically requires a dataset of texts with the desired information carefully annotated by a human expert. A corpus of this kind is expensive and time-consuming to create. Instead, we propose a statistical machine learning approach which generalizes the existing HealthMap rulebased geo-parsing by making use of the lexical and syntactic context in which the existing gazetteer phrases appear. We have demonstrated that the described model has indeed the ability to discover a substantial number of geographic references that are not present in the gazetteer. In addition, our approach also limits the number of false positive it produces.",

There are several components of this approach that could be refined in order to improve the performance of the algorithm.

In addition to relying on the term frequency, the strategy could also account for the part-ofspeech of the word to hide (eg verbs are unlikely surrogates for locations), and on the alert frequency of the term (a word that appear a few times in the corpus but only in a unique alert might be more likely to be location than one with occurrences in several alerts). Another place for improvement could be the representation of words. Other features, aside from part-of-speech and capitalization, could provide additional information about the semantic Evaluation with respect to MetaCarta tags Figure 6 Evaluation with respect to MetaCarta tags.

However, these features should be simple enough to implement in several languages, in order to comply with the requirement of portability formulated previously. Another further area of exploration, is the weight given to words tagged as none during training. Some of those words are actually unknown locations that, during the learning process, are strongly supervised as not being locations. Even if we compensate for this error by tuning the decision threshold, it should be also possible to act on the problem by a relaxation of the supervision during the training stage. Finally, the geo-parsing of an alert is only an intermediate step. Finding which terms in an alert are geographic references is crucial, but the final goal is to identify which among these terms is the definitive disease outbreak location and be able to disambiguate it (Paris, Texas vs Paris, France). Ideally, we would like to integrate these different tasks into one, so that the information that is learned from one can benefit the others.",

To generate this dataset, the HealthMap gazetteer-based algorithm was first applied to this set of alerts in order to extract the words in the text referring to geographic locations. The same alerts were then run through the part-of-speech tagger algorithm provided by NEC's project SENNA (a Neural Network Architecture for Semantic Extraction) [22] , making the syntax of the text explicit. This part-of-speech tagger has a reported accuracy of 96.85% on the reference Penn Treebank dataset [23] . We then assigned to every word in the alerts a capitalization status, ie none, first character, upper case. After these 3 steps in the data generation process, each word in each alert had 4 features: the word itself, its part-of-speech tag, its capitalization status and a label indicating if the word is a geographic location or not. The last step in the data generation process consisted in replacing the lexical feature of the words with lowest frequency by a blank, as explained in the Results section.",

First, each word in the window sequence is given as input to a unique multilayer perceptron (MLP) which has been replicated n = 2 \u00d7 hw + 1 times, in a siamese network fashion [24] . This first MLP can be seen as a function \u03d5 mapping the extremely sparse representation x i of the words into a new representation, \u03d5(x i ) \u2208 R d , which has the advantage of being learned during the training.
