            "text": "The impact of metabolic engineering on nontarget pathways and outcomes of metabolic engineering from different genomes are poorly understood questions. Therefore, squalene biosynthesis genes FARNESYL DIPHOSPHATE SYNTHASE (FPS) and SQUALENE SYNTHASE (SQS) were engineered via the Nicotiana tabacum chloroplast (C), nuclear (N) or both (CN) genomes to promote squalene biosynthesis. SQS levels were~4300-fold higher in C and CN lines than in N, but all accumulated~150-fold higher squalene due to substrate or storage limitations. Abnormal leaf and flower phenotypes, including lower pollen production and reduced fertility, were observed regardless of the compartment or level of transgene expression. Substantial changes in metabolomes of all lines were observed: levels of 65-120 unrelated metabolites, including the toxic alkaloid nicotine, changed by as much as 32-fold. Profound effects of transgenesis on nontarget gene expression included changes in the abundance of 19 076 transcripts by up to 2000-fold in CN; 7784 transcripts by up to 1400-fold in N; and 5224 transcripts by as much as 2200-fold in C. Transporter-related transcripts were induced, and cell cycle-associated transcripts were disproportionally repressed in all three lines. Transcriptome changes were validated by qRT-PCR. The mechanism underlying these large changes likely involves metabolite-mediated anterograde and/or retrograde signalling irrespective of the level of transgene expression or end product, due to imbalance of metabolic pools, offering new insight into both anticipated and unanticipated consequences of metabolic engineering.",

            "text": "However, nuclear transformation is associated with several disadvantages. Positional effects can reduce or silence transgene expression, making it difficult to establish a stable population that consistently accumulates high levels of the desired product (Jin and Daniell, 2015; Verma and Daniell, 2007) . Additionally, lack of transgene containment raises regulatory issues and makes commercialization more challenging (Chan and Daniell, 2015) . Some of these problems can be overcome by expressing transgenes via the chloroplast genome. Chloroplast transformation, which occurs through homologous recombination, contains transgenes (Verma et al., 2008) , and its high ploidy-up to 10 000 copies per cell-permits transgene products to reach exceptionally high levels (Ruhlman et al., 2010) . For example, tobacco chloroplasts expressing a multigene operon encoding Bt toxin allowed the protein to accumulate up to~50% of total leaf protein and to form cuboidal crystals within chloroplasts (De Cosa et al., 2001) ; chloroplast-expressed b-glucosidase accumulated to 160-fold higher levels than in untransformed plants (Jin et al., 2011) ; and proinsulin could make up nearly 70% of total transplastomic leaf protein (Ruhlman et al., 2010) .",

In later studies, the chloroplast genome was engineered to express all six genes of the cytoplasmic mevalonate pathway for terpenoid synthesis (Kumar et al., 2012) or thirteen artemisinin pathway biosynthesis genes (Saxena et al., 2014) , although in the latter case, expression was inadequate to meet target levels.

Consequently, chloroplast function requires the import of thousands of nuclear-encoded proteins, many of which work in concert with plastid-encoded gene products and require proper stoichiometry (Jin and Daniell, 2015) . Therefore, the expression of nuclear-and plastid-encoded genes must be coordinately regulated, and this occurs via anterograde signalling from the nucleus to plastids and retrograde signalling from plastids to the nucleus. Whereas anterograde signalling is well understood, retrograde signalling is still enigmatic. Chloroplasts may regulate nuclear gene expression via proteins (Jin and Daniell, 2014; Singh et al., 2008) , redox state (Nott et al., 2006) or metabolites (Chi et al., 2015; Estavillo et al., 2011; Woodson et al., 2011; Xiao et al., 2012) , but these signals act only under specific circumstances, and mechanisms by which they are conveyed remain elusive. However, high accumulation of proteins expressed via the chloroplast genome and compartmentalization within chloroplasts make chloroplast genetic engineering an excellent system to study retrograde signalling.",

The availability of modern tools to study the metabolome and transcriptome facilitates global evaluation of the effect of these introduced pathways on native genes through metabolite-mediated anterograde or retrograde signalling. Here, we used chloroplast genetic engineering and an existing nuclear transgenic line to uncover potential unintended consequences of expressing metabolic genes from different compartments. We focused on squalene because of its importance in steroid biosynthesis, its industrial applications in cosmetics and nutraceuticals (Kim and Karadeniz, 2012) and its use as a vaccine adjuvant (O'Hagan et al., 2011) , as well as the availability of nuclear transgenic lines expressing squalene biosynthetic enzymes for comparative investigations (Wu et al., 2012) . We found profound but similar off-target effects on both the metabolome and transcriptome regardless of the compartment from which transgenes were expressed. By focusing on global effects of intercompartmental signalling rather than attempting to identify yet another signalling molecule, we provide a framework for future studies on large-scale effects of metabolite-mediated intercompartmental signalling.",

Encoded amino acid sequences were identical to those reported previously (Wu et al., 2012) , but corresponding DNA sequences were codon-optimized for enhanced chloroplast expression (Daniell et al., 2009) . In pLD-SQS, Flag-SQS was regulated by the tobacco psbA promoter, 5 0 -UTR and 3 0 -UTR, and isoleucine tRNA (trnI) and alanine tRNA (trnA) flanking sequences were included for integration into the chloroplast genome via homologous recombination (Verma and Daniell, 2007) . In pLD-FPS-SQS, expression of His-FPS was controlled by the plastid rRNA operon promoter (Prrn), the 5 0 translation control element of bacteriophage T7 gene 10 and the tobacco rbcL 3 0 -UTR (Dhingra et al., 2004) .",

Leaves of N were bombarded with pLD-SQS to generate transplastomic lines expressing SQS from the chloroplast genome; the resulting line is referred to as 'CN'. After selection and regeneration on spectinomycin-containing media, several independent CN lines were regenerated from ten bombardments. PCR analysis with the 3P/3M primer set (Verma et al., 2008) indicated that the Flag-SQS cassette had been stably integrated into the chloroplast genome via homologous recombination ( Figure S1 ). After two additional rounds of selection on spectinomycin-containing media, CN lines were confirmed by Southern blot. As shown in Figure 1a ,b, several independent CN lines showed a 6.63-kb band but not the 4.43-kb WT band, confirming that homoplasmic plants had been generated. We also bombarded N with pLD-FPS-SQS, but no shoots survived. When pLD-FPS-SQS was used to transform WT tobacco, several independent transplastomic lines, referred to as 'C', were obtained, as confirmed by PCR ( Figure S1 ) and Southern blot (Figure 1b, left) . Two bands with correct sizes of 8.42 and 3.48 kb (due to the presence of a HindIII site in the His-FPS cassette), but not the 7.67-kb WT band, were observed in HindIIIdigested DNA from C lines, confirming that homoplasmic C lines had been generated (Figure 1b, right) . Because the engineered His tag was not detectable in western blots, we confirmed expression of His-FPS via the chloroplast genome using northern blot for the rbcL 3 0 -UTR ( Figure 1a ). In addition to the endogenous rbcL signal in each line, the C line showed an additional band corresponding to the expressed His-FPS transgene (Figure 1c) . Notably, the His-FPS transcript was as abundant as that of rbcL, which is the most abundant protein on earth (Dhingra et al., 2004) .",

Given this, differences between CN and C are quite striking; despite both expressing high levels of Flag-SQS, CN had much more severe Evaluation of metabolic profiles of transgenic/ transplastomic lines expressing FPS and SQS Although our original intention was to produce transplastomic plants that accumulated squalene, phenotypes of all three lines suggested that more than just squalene levels might be altered. Therefore, we used nodal cutting to grow all lines in vitro under identical physiological conditions and harvested the third youngest leaf from plants at an identical developmental stage to analyse global metabolic profiles. All transplastomic plants were from the T0 generation. The metabolomic analysis used gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and two types of ultra highperformance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC/MS/MS), one optimized for acidic species and one optimized for basic species (Clarke et al., 2013; Evans et al., 2009) . Principal component analysis (PCA) of quadruplicate samples showed tight clustering within each line (Figure 3a ). PCA also showed that metabolic profiles of CN and C were distinct from N and WT but were almost indistinguishable from each other, whereas N showed a small but clear separation from WT ( Figure 3a ).",

In CN, FPS expression increased 3600-fold and nuclear transgenic SQS expression increased 1300-fold relative to WT. Next, we determined which transcripts were most highly changed in each line compared with WT, ranked them by overall fold change independent of the line(s), then identified the fold change in other two lines. Despite identifying DE transcripts in a line-independent manner, the majority of most highly induced (Table 2 ) and most highly repressed transcripts (Table 3) were common to all three lines and changed in the same direction. Strikingly, nearly half of most highly induced transcripts (9/20) were predicted to encode transporters of varying functions, including transporters for sucrose (SWEETs), phosphate, metals and auxin. In addition, transcripts with predicted roles in growth and development, metabolism and defence were induced. Consistent with these annotations, Gene Ontology (GO) analysis of biological process-related terms showed enrichment for terms related to stress and stimulus responses (Figure 4c ). We also observed enrichment for transcripts involved in secondary metabolism (Figure 4c ).

In other instances, as for a transcript annotated to a N. tomentosiformis GDSL-motif esterase/lipase (transcript 2) and for a N. tomentosiformis DNA TOPOISOMERASE II (transcript 9), CN clearly showed the strongest repression: 2000-fold and 1100-fold, respectively. CN also showed a unique enrichment for down-regulated transcripts predicted to be involved in reproductive development (Figure 4c ).

Here, we demonstrate that expressing chloroplast-targeted FPS and/or SQS from the nuclear genome (N line), the chloroplast genome (C line) or both (CN line) has broad off-target effects on the metabolome and transcriptome. However, because many of the same metabolites and transcripts are changed in a similar direction across all three lines, FPS and SQS expression may cause broad but somewhat predictable offtarget effects.",

However, neither transplastomic line accumulated significantly more squalene than N (Figure 3b , Tables 1 and S1), suggesting a substrate or storage limit. Consistent with this, in the background of PH, which has fewer glandular trichomes than 1068 (Wu et al., 2012) , we could generate plants expressing SQS only; transforming PH chloroplasts with pLD-FPS-SQS yielded shoots that did not survive, and similar problems were encountered using nuclear transformation constructs that targeted FPS and SQS to chloroplasts. Inadequate trichomes (sinks) in PH may have caused this, perhaps through feedback inhibition. Indeed, the 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway of terpene biosynthesis is under feedback inhibition by its own products, dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) and isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) (Banerjee et al., 2013) , and IPP is the substrate of FPS. One strategy to increase squalene could be to increase sink capacity by sequestering squalene in storage compartments such as lipid droplets (Wang et al., 2015) or additional trichomes (Lange, 2015) . Trichome density could be increased via transgenic expression of b-glucosidase (Jin et al., 2011) , which improves artemisinin yields in transgenic Artemisia annua (Singh et al., 2015) .",

Fructose 6-phosphate and glucose 6-phosphate are both photosynthetic outputs from the Calvin cycle and are synthesized from glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, a three-carbon Calvin cycle output. In chloroplasts, squalene biosynthesis is initiated by the conversion of glyceraldehyde 3phosphate and pyruvate into 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate in a committed step catalysed by 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase. Therefore, the 150-fold increase in squalene levels and the decrease in fructose 6-phosphate and glucose 6phosphate biosynthesis observed in engineered lines suggest that glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate is repartitioned from the synthesis of sugars into the production of terpenes (Wang et al., 2015) .",

Therefore, given the accumulation of Flag-SQS in transplastomic lines (Figure 1d) , it is not surprising that amino acid metabolism was altered in CN and C (Figure 3c and d, Table 1 ). Decarboxylated aromatic amino acids accumulated to at least eightfold higher levels in CN and C than in WT without an increase in their corresponding precursors (Figure 3d , Table 1 ). This result demonstrates that transplastomic lines are not impaired in amino acid biosynthesis and suggests the diversion of carbon into squalene biosynthesis, leading to an imbalance between carbon and nitrogen that explains the accumulation of these amino acid derivatives. Additionally, the abundance of various nucleotides was affected (Figure 3c ; Table S1), possibly due to large quantities of FPS and/or SQS mRNA.",

Transplastomic CN and C lines accumulate at least 2000-fold more Flag-SQS than N (Figure 1d) , and expression of FPS from the nuclear genome alone may not produce enough transgene product to match levels of SQS in CN (Figure 1c) . Therefore, phenotypes observed in CN may be mitigated by incorporating FPS into the chloroplast genome. Similarly, in transplastomic PH plants expressing only SQS, the abundance of dozens of metabolites changed by >10-fold (Table S2) . Notably, one of these metabolites was nicotine, which accumulated to nearly 11-fold higher levels than in untransformed plants (Table S2) , supporting the idea that metabolic imbalance can result in substantial off-target effects on entirely unrelated pathways.",

However, not only the number of DE transcripts differed, but also their expression levels (Tables 2 and 3 ). The signal may therefore be a different metabolite or metabolites, perhaps one affected by the imbalance between SQS and FPS levels in CN (Figure 3c , Table S1 ), but investigation of this possibility is beyond the scope of this study. Interestingly, an upstream molecule in the MEP pathway, methylerythritol cyclodiphosphate (MEcPP), acts as a retrograde signalling molecule under high light and wounding; these stresses induce accumulation of MEcPP to~two-to threefold higher levels than in controls (Xiao et al., 2012) . Altered flux through the MEP pathway may change the abundance of MEcPP, thereby causing at least a subset of observed transcriptomic changes in engineered plants. The effect of FPS and SQS expression could extend downstream of MEcPP and parallel to farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) and/or squalene, and these metabolites may also serve as retrograde signals. Both IPP and DMAPP are precursors for the synthesis of carotenoids such as b-carotene (Nisar et al., 2015) , and a volatile b-carotene derivative, bcyclocitral, has been proposed as a stress-induced retrograde signalling molecule (Ramel et al., 2012) . Increased demand for IPP by FPS or for FPP by SQS may affect carotenoid metabolism, and, consequently, b-cyclocitral levels, causing altered retrograde signalling. Although none of these metabolites were significantly changed between WT and engineered lines in our analysis, it does not exclude the possibility that the abundance of one or more of them was altered, leading to changes in phenotype and gene expression. If such a difference had occurred, small changes needed to induce signalling (e.g. for MEcPP) and differences in detection and analytical methods may have excluded these metabolites from analysis, especially if differences were statistically insignificant.",

FPS and SQS expression may cause clear transcriptomic, metabolomic and phenotypic changes because they are metabolism related. For example, transplastomic tobacco expressing twelve genes for the biosynthesis of artemisinic acid (AA) accumulated only approximately 0.1 mg/g fresh weight (FW) AA, but growth was still reduced (Saxena et al., 2014) , and nuclear transgenic plants accumulating linalool and nerolidol accumulated 1.5 lg/g FW of these terpenes but still displayed delayed growth (Aharoni et al., 2003) . These observations may reflect the partitioning of carbon away from biomass and into the desired metabolite (Melis, 2013) . By contrast, transgenic/transplastomic expression of genes that are unrelated to metabolism has few to no phenotypic effects and, in the case of transplastomic plants, can often be rescued by adding exogenous nitrogen (Bally et al., 2009 (Bally et al., , 2011 De Cosa et al., 2001; Ruhlman et al., 2010; Viitanen et al., 2004) .

However, these effects may be predictable and can therefore be minimized or exploited. By focusing on global consequences of metabolic engineering rather than simply searching for another individual signalling molecule, our results provide a unique, holistic view of metabolite-mediated intercompartmental signalling that can be used as a framework for future studies on both metabolic engineering and metabolite-mediated anterograde and retrograde signalling.",

All N plants were homozygous siblings derived from the same transformation event. To construct the vectors used to generate transplastomic lines, DNA sequences encoding Flag-tagged yeast SQS (GenBank accession NM001179321) and 4xHis-tagged avian FPS (GenBank accession P08836) were codon-optimized for enhanced chloroplast expression (Daniell et al., 2009) Flag-SQS coding sequence was cloned into the NdeI and XbaI sites of pLD-ctv under the control of the psbA promoter, 5 0 -UTR and 3 0 -UTR (Daniell et al., 2005) . To construct pLD-FPS-SQS, an intermediate vector was assembled that contained the Prrn-g10/ His-FPS/TrbcL cassette. This vector was digested with SalI, and the released cassette was ligated into SalI-digested pLD-SQS. Both vectors were confirmed by sequencing. Chloroplast transformation of WT with pLD-FPS-SQS and of N with pLD-SQS was performed as described previously (Verma et al., 2008) . PCR and western blot of putative transplastomic plants were carried out as described (Kwon et al., 2013a; Verma et al., 2008) . Western blot was performed using an anti-DYKDDDDK antibody (Life-Tein, South Plainfield, NJ) at a 1 : 1000 dilution and a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL, USA) at a 1 : 4000 dilution. Densitometric analysis was carried out using the gel analysis feature of ImageJ, Bethesda, MD, USA. Southern blot was performed using the DIG High Prime DNA Labeling and Detection Kit (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, 0.5 lg of total tobacco DNA was digested with AflIII or HindIII and resolved on a 0.8% agarose gel. The DNA was blotted onto a positively charged nylon membrane (Nytran SPC; GE Healthcare, Marlborough, MA). Hybridization with DIG-labelled probe for the trnI-trnA flanking region (Figure 1a ) was conducted at 41\u00b0C in a UVP HB-1000 hybridizer (UVP LLC, Upland, CA), and signals were detected with CSPD substrate and X-ray film. Probe for northern blot analysis was synthesized using the DIG High Prime DNA Labeling and Detection Kit with a PCR product containing the rbcL 3 0 -UTR. Northern blot was performed using total RNA (see below) run on a 0.9% denaturing agarose gel. The RNA was blotted onto a Nytran membrane and hybridized with the probe at 42\u00b0C. Signals were detected as for the Southern blot. For phenotypic analysis of homoplasmic transplastomic lines, data are representative of at least two independent transformation events.",
