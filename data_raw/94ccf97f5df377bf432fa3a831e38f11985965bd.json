We thus aimed to understand the interaction of viral infections and the nasal microbiota in early life to appraise their roles in disease development. Thirty-two healthy, unselected infants were included in this prospective longitudinal cohort study within the first year of life. Biweekly nasal swabs (n \u03ed 559) were taken, and the microbiota was analyzed by 16S rRNA pyrosequencing, and 10 different viruses and 2 atypical bacteria were characterized by real-time PCR (combination of seven duplex samples). In contrast to asymptomatic human rhinovirus (HRV) colonization, symptomatic HRV infections were associated with lower alpha diversity (Shannon diversity index [SDI]), higher bacterial density (PCR concentration), and a difference in beta diversities (Jaccard and Bray-Curtis index) of the microbiota. In addition, infants with more frequent HRV infections had a lower SDI at the end of the study period. Overall, changes in the microbiota associated with symptomatic HRV infections were characterized by a loss of microbial diversity. The interaction between HRV infections and the nasal microbiota in early life might be of importance for later disease development and indicate a potential approach for future interventions.",

Infections with human rhinovirus (HRV) are, e.g., associated with the later development of asthma. We found that only symptomatic HRV infections were associated with acute changes in the nasal microbiota, mainly characterized by a loss of microbial diversity. Infants with more frequent symptomatic HRV infections had a lower bacterial diversity at the end of the first year of life. Whether the interaction between viruses and the microbiota is one pathway contributing to asthma development will be assessed in the follow-ups of these children. Independent of that, measurements of microbial diversity might represent a potential marker for risk of later lung disease or monitoring of early life interventions.",

Despite recent data on the association between viral infections and changes in the microbiota in adults, data for young children are scarce (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) .

Briefly, bacterial density increased and diversity decreased within the first year of life. If investigating the bacterial families, the relative abundance of Staphylococcaceae and Corynebacteriaceae was highest in the first 3 months of life. A virus was detected in 241 samples (43%); of those, 123 (51%) were accompanied by respiratory symptoms and 11 (5%) samples were taken during periods with more severe respiratory symptoms (lower respiratory tract infection [LRTI] ). The most frequent virus was HRV (147 samples [26%] ); all of the other viruses analyzed were detected in 39 (7%) samples or less; RSV was found only in 11 samples (2%) (for complete viral colonization, see Table 2 ). We thus grouped all other viruses as \"viruses other than HRV.\" After excluding the samples cocolonized with HRV, in 94 (17%) samples, \"viruses other than HRV\" were detected. Of those, 38 (40%) were accompanied by respiratory symptoms, and 56 (60%) were not. A total of 120 samples (21%) showed HRV colonization without cocolonization with other viruses. Of those, 69 (57.5%) were accompanied by respiratory symptoms, while 51 (42.5%) were not. A total of 318 samples (57%) remained free of any viral colonization; of those, 77 samples (24%) did show respiratory symptoms, and 6 (2%) were taken during LRTI. Changes in the microbiota during viral colonization. Changes in the microbiota during viral colonization are depicted in analysis I in Fig. 1 . HRV colonization was associated with a higher bacterial density and a lower alpha diversity: mean PCR concentration (PCR concn ), 44 (standard deviation [SD], 35) ng/l versus 29 [SD, 29] ng/l; Shannon diversity index (SDI), 0.9 (SD, 0.7) versus 1.3 (SD, 0.9) ( Table 3) . This change occurred only during periods of symptomatic HRV infections, whereas no change in density or diversity was found during asymptomatic HRV colonization (Table 3 ). In addition, using two different approaches (Jaccard and Bray-Curtis dissimilarities), there was a significantly different bacterial composition during symptomatic HRV infection (Jaccard, P \u03ed 0.04; Bray-Curtis, P \u03ed 0.034), but not during asymptomatic HRV colonization (Jaccard, P \u03ed 0.06; Bray-Curtis, P \u03ed 0.1) as revealed by a nonmetric multidimensional scaling (nMDS) ordination plot (Fig. 2) .",

Results were significant for bacterial density (PCR concn , incidence rate ratio [IRR], 1.53; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.17 to 2.01; P \u03ed 0.002) and diversity (SDI coefficient [SDI coeff], \u03ea0.15; 95% CI, \u03ea0.30 to 0.00; P \u03ed 0.051), indicating comparable effects for mild and severe infections. To maintain higher statistical power, we combined both groups in our analysis. Investigation on the bacterial family level showed that the relative abundance of the different bacterial families did not change during HRV colonization, but the abundance of \"others\" was significantly decreased (25% [SD, 36%] versus 31% [SD, 32%]) ( Table 3 ; see Fig. S2 in the supplemental material). Findings were confirmed when samples with viral coinfections in the swab were included (results not shown) or in analyses adjusted for age and season and other risk factors (first and second groups of \"Adjusted model\" columns in Table 3 , respectively). Results were verified in two sensitivity analyses: (i) excluding samples with a lower number of reads and (ii) if rarefied to 500 reads per sample (see Tables S2 and S3 in the supplemental material). To reassure that possible changes in the microbiota were due to viral colonization and were not the result of respiratory symptoms per se, we performed additional analyses, including samples free of virus with and without respiratory symptoms separately in the model (see Table S4 in the supplemental material). Results were not different from the calculations presented above, where samples free of virus irrespective of symptoms were used as the baseline. For further analysis, to obtain better statistical power, we thus referred to samples free of virus with and without respiratory symptoms as the baseline for comparison when investigating the microbiota during colonization of the different viruses.",

Analyzing 559 biweekly nasal samples, we found a strong and robust association between HRV colonization and changes in the microbiota. During symptomatic HRV colonization, a lower alpha diversity (SDI), a higher bacterial density (PCR concn ), and a difference in beta diversity (Jaccard and Bray-Curtis dissimilarities) of the microbiota were found. In contrast, during asymptomatic HRV colonization, no changes in the microbiota were detected. Results remained stable if distinguishing between symptomatic and asymptomatic samples free of virus, indicating that changes in the microbiota are not driven by symptoms per se but by HRV infection. Furthermore, in addition to the short-term changes, more frequent symptomatic HRV infections had a sustained impact upon the composition of the microbiota. To our knowledge, an investigation of viral colonization of the nose and the nasal microbiota in infancy has only been published once (23) . In that Australian study, sampling was performed two or three times in each infant, so persisting changes were not investigated. The authors concluded that viruses and the microbiota contribute independently to the later onset of asthma, but the underlying interactions between virus and bacteria were not assessed on a short-term basis. Apart from that study, the impact of symptomatic HRV infection on bacterial colonization has been reported only in older children (24) . The authors reported a higher detection rate and a higher quantity of bacteria during HRV infection in children of ages 4 to 12 years, as well as an association of specific bacteria and HRV infection with asthma symptoms.",

In our study, only symptomatic HRV infections were associated with changes in the microbiota.

PCR products with a concentration of less than 1.0 ng/l were excluded from the study, corresponding to less than 1 pg/l bacterial DNA (10) , which was recently recommended as a reliable threshold (41) . For further quality control, we excluded samples with less than 70 reads and sequenced two negative-control samples. Samples displaying greater than 5% sequence reads identical to the negative controls were excluded. In addition, we did not identify taxa that have recently been identified to be contaminations (42) . A 40-ng/l concentration of each PCR product was pooled, and every MID was used once. The 8 resulting amplicon pools were sequenced with the 454 sequencing platform, and the reads were submitted to the National Center for Biotechnology Information Sequence Read Archive. Analysis of sequencing products was performed using PyroTagger pipeline (43) , which comprises the definition of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) based on 97% sequencing identity, estimation of chimeras, and taxonomic assignments. Pipeline settings were described in detail before (40) . As an additional quality cutoff, samples with less than 70 sequence reads were excluded from the study (n \u03ed 13), resulting in a minimum number of reads of 77. The mean number of sequence reads was, however, much higher (1,469 [SD, 1,083] reads per sample).",
