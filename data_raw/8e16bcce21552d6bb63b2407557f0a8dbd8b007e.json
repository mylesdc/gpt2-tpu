In order to investigate the role of respiratory viruses in chronic adenotonsillar diseases, we developed a cross-sectional study to determine the rates of viral detections of common respiratory viruses detected by TaqMan real time PCR (qPCR) in nasopharyngeal secretions, tonsillar tissues and peripheral blood from 121 children with chronic tonsillar diseases, without symptoms of acute respiratory infections. At least one respiratory virus was detected in 97.5% of patients. The viral co-infection rate was 69.5%. The most frequently detected viruses were human adenovirus in 47.1%, human enterovirus in 40.5%, human rhinovirus in 38%, human bocavirus in 29.8%, human metapneumovirus in 17.4% and human respiratory syncytial virus in 15.7%. Results of qPCR varied widely between sample sites: human adenovirus, human bocavirus and human enterovirus were predominantly detected in tissues, while human rhinovirus was more frequently detected in secretions. Rates of virus detection were remarkably high in tonsil tissues: over 85% in adenoids and close to 70% in palatine tonsils. In addition, overall virus detection rates were higher in more hypertrophic than in smaller adenoids (p = 0.05), and in the particular case of human enteroviruses, they were detected more frequently (p = 0.05) in larger palatine tonsils than in smaller ones. While persistence/latency of DNA viruses in tonsillar tissues has been documented, such is not the case of RNA viruses. Respiratory viruses are highly prevalent in adenoids and palatine tonsils of patients with chronic tonsillar diseases, and persistence of these viruses in tonsils may stimulate chronic inflammation and play a role in the pathogenesis of these diseases.",

Tonsillar hyperplasia and recurrent tonsillitis are common chronic diseases that often lead to complications that include nasal obstruction, recurrent sinusitis, snoring, auditory tube dysfunction, otitis media, obstructive sleep apnea and changes in facial growth and behavioral development [2] . These complications frequently lead to patients undergoing tonsillectomy, which still is one of the most commonly performed pediatric surgical procedures worldwide [3] . Yet, the pathogenesis of chronic tonsillar diseases is largely unknown. Tonsils and adenoids harbor bacterial and viral pathogens [4] [5] [6] , and although bacterial components of biofilms can be cultured from the surfaces and crypts of inflamed tonsils and adenoids, their role as causative agents of adenotonsillar hyperplasia is largely unknown [7] .",

Nevertheless, systematic studies of viruses in adenoids and tonsils have been scarce, especially in association with chronic hypertrophic tonsillar disease. In order to investigate the role of respiratory viruses in chronic adenotonsillar diseases we have performed a cross-sectional study in surgical tissue samples and cavity washes from patients with recurrent tonsillitis and chronic adenotonsillar hyperplasia. To the best of our knowledge, this has been the most extensive study of its kind to date. The results revealed high rates of virus detection in adenotonsillar tissues, with divergent virus preponderance in different sampling sites, possibly owing to different routes of infection and/or tissue composition. The high rates of detection of respiratory viruses in adenoids and palatine tonsils of patients with chronic adenotonsillar disease bring new insights about the transmission of respiratory viruses and their role in pathogenesis of chronic adenotonsillar diseases.",

All qPCR assays were done on Thermocycler 7300 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) with specific primers and probes (Table S1 ). qPCR for bactin and RNAseP housekeeping genes was done in all samples. The qPCR assays using two sets primers for different clusters of HRV types, HRSV subgroups A and B, and HCoV types OC43 and 229E, were done in duplex format. The remaining qPCR assays done with one set of primers per reaction for HAdV, HBoV, HMPV A, HMPV B, FLU A, FLU B, HPIV 1, HPIV 3, RNAseP and b-Actin were done separately. For the RNA viruses (HRV, FLU, HPIV, HRSV, HMPV, HEV and HCoV) reverse transcription was done prior to qPCR using 1 mg of extracted RNA primed with random hexamers, with Multiscribe reverse transcriptase (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) following protocol proposed by the manufacturer. Duplex qPCR assays were done in a final volume of 15 mL with 3 ml of cDNA, 10 mM forward and reverse primers, 5 mM probe, 7.5 ml of TaqMan master mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), with the following parameters: 95uC for 10 minutes, followed by 45 cycles of 95uC for 15 seconds and 60uC for 1 minute.

When HRV and HEV were taken together, the frequencies of picornavirus detection in adenoids and palatine tonsils were respectively 55.4% and 49.6%, showing that these agents together can be present in lymphoepithelial tissues in up to one half of subjects with chronic tonsillar hypertrophy.

Indeed, in only 4 of 46 HRV-positive patients (8.7%), the virus was detected only in tonsils, without concurrent detection in nasopharyngeal secretions. In contrast, detection of HEV in palatine tonsils was significantly more frequent than in adenoids and nasopharyngeal secretions and, conversely, in only 4 of 49 HEV-positive patients (8.2%) the virus was detected in sampling sites either than palatine tonsils. A tropism of HEV for palatine tonsils is illustrated by this site being the only HEV-positive site in 25% of all 45 patients with HEV in palatine tonsils. The frequent finding of picornaviruses in adenoid and palatine tonsil tissues in the present study expands on findings of a previous study done in Finland [10] . In that study a very high frequency of detection of picornavirus RNA (75%) was found by in situ hybridization, yet in a restricted number of palatine tonsil tissues from patients with chronic tonsillar disease. Of note, that study pointed towards a role for HRV in pathogenesis of chronic tonsillitis based on the analysis of tissues from 4 patients. Moreover, the in situ hybridization signal attributed to HRV, could have been caused by persistent HEV. The specificity of our findings is supported by the TaqMan technology, which relies on the hybridization of a fluorescent probe internal to the amplicon, bringing reliability to the differentiation between HRV and HEV. Detection of picornaviruses in that study appeared to be more frequent in patients with chronic tonsillitis than in patients with recurrent tonsillitis, what is in agreement with our observations. Not surprisingly, HAdV was the most frequently detected agent, present in near one half of all patients when results from all sample sites were taken together; and in over 42% considering only macerated adenoid tissues. In fact, HAdV was first identified in association with adenoid tissue [8] , and our findings confirm the strong tropism of that agent for lymphoepithelial tissues. Although the molecular details of HAdV persistency are not completely understood [15] , the prolonged presence of this agent in nasopharyngeal tonsils allows for periodic and asymptomatic virus shedding that ensures successful transmission with infection of vast proportions of humans at some point in life [16, 17] .",

We have shown previously that only approximately 25% of patients with detectable HBoV genome shed mRNA, a marker of active viral replication [20] , indicating that a significant proportion of infected HBoV-patients carry the virus in a latent/persistent state. This is indirectly supported by the fact that bocaviruses of other species can persist in lymphoid tissues of the upper respiratory tract, indicating that HBoV could persist in humans in a similar way and be related to chronic inflammation of these tissues. In fact, a recent flow cytometry study has shown that HBoV can be detected in tonsillar lymphocytes in 32% of pediatric patients who underwent tonsillectomy [13] . In agreement with that, the presently reported study found HBoV in nearly 24% of the adenoids, and further expanded to reveal that HBoV is more likely to be detected in in adenoids than in palatine tonsils or nasopharyngeal secretions, suggesting a preference for adenoids over palatine tonsils and thus bringing new insights to the pathogenesis of this emergent virus. This is the first report of viral co-infection in chronic adenotonsillar diseases, and it is notable that two thirds of the patients had more than one respiratory virus detected simultaneously, even in the absence of symptoms and signs of acute respiratory infection. The majority of viral co-infections resulted from combinations of HAdV, HBoV, HEV and HRV, and coinfections were more frequent when detections of viruses both in tissues and nasopharyngeal secretions were considered. When only adenoids and palatine tonsils were analyzed, rates of viral coinfections were close to 45% and 21%, respectively.",

This finds support on histological studies of enlarged tonsils, which reveals enlargement of follicles, indicating hyperplasia with marked increase in the numbers of lymphoid cells in the germinal centers [23] . On the other hand, it is possible that some respiratory viruses may directly affect tonsil cell survival, by counteracting natural mechanisms of cell death, including apoptosis. Reduction in lymphoid cell apoptosis is accepted as an important mechanism in the pathogenesis of tonsillar hypertrophy [24] , and that could be caused by viruses, such as the case of human coronavirus, which has a nonstructural protein that inhibits apoptosis triggered by the mitochondrial antiviral signaling adaptor (MAVS) [25] .",

The patients were sampled only once, which hampers determination of the duration of virus presence in them. Nevertheless, significant proportions of such patients had different combinations of viruses simultaneously detected at different sites, suggesting that some of them might be persistent. It is remarkable that not all respiratory viruses were detected at similar frequencies in adenoids and palatine tonsils, nor were uniformly shed in nasopharyngeal secretions. Specific viruses seem to preferentially infect some tissues, such as human enteroviruses that were more often detected in palatine tonsils than in adenoids, and were shed in secretions much less frequently than all others. Taken together, these data suggest that respiratory virus persistence/latency may play roles in pathogenesis of chronic adenotonsillar diseases, and that these tissues may serve as interseasonal virus reservoirs, with possible impact in transmission in the community.",
