Human-to-human transmission has been documented amply [12] ; in the Korean situation, for example, transmission appears to be entirely from humans to humans [7] . Contact of various types with camels, such as consumption of raw milk, butchering and cleaning meat, and visiting live animals, has been identified as a significant risk factor, such that camels are seen as a significant reservoir host for MERS-CoV in its transmission to humans (e.g., [13] ).",

The geographic pattern of case occurrences, particularly with respect to the environments manifested at those sites, however, holds potentially rich information about the transmission biology and spatial distribution of transmission risk of diseases such as this one [14] . As such, this paper explores the geographic and environmental circumstances under which MERS-CoV has been transmitted from camels to humans, and where those highrisk circumstances are manifested (i.e., developing a risk map of transmission probabilities). In particular, we test the hypothesis that MERS-CoV cases derived from camel exposure (i.e., as opposed to human-to-human transmission) will have a narrower set of associated environments (i.e., niche breadth), which would be indicative of environmental influences on transmission that can be translated into a map of transmission risk.",

Each report had to be read carefully to extract information for as many of the fields as possible, and we worked hard not to include duplicate records of cases.

Because the first five components summarized 99.99 % of the total variance in the original data, we focused on those components only in our analyses.

We then thresholded each of the niche models using a least training presence thresholding approach, modified to permit an omission rate of E = 0.1 [19] , such that we identified the highest raw suitability level that included 90 % of the data with which the model was calibrated in the suitable area. We then discarded all random points not identified as suitable in either of the models, leaving 5936 points for analysis. Finally, as fewer points were identified as suitable in the model based on camel exposures (4811 points), we rarefied the larger set of points identified as suitable in the model based on all MERS-CoV cases (5707 points) down to the number of points suitable in the camel model, and calculated the standard deviation of each environmental variable associated with points in each data set. Based on direct counts of the observed standard deviation from the camel-based model with those among the 100 random replicates drawn from the unrestricted model, we tested whether the niche estimated based on camel exposures was narrower than that based on all cases.",

This concentration was reflected in the ecological niche model outputs (Fig. 2) : the model based on reported camel exposure showed highest suitability in the northeastern and southwestern parts of the Arabian Peninsula, as well as adjacent areas of southwestern Asia and northeastern Africa. The model based on all occurrences, on the other hand, identified a broader suitable area across the central portion of the Arabian Peninsula and adjacent areas of Asia and Africa. High uncertainty in these predictions, in both cases, coincided with areas of high modeled suitability (Fig. 2) , such that confidence in model predictions is not uniformly high.",

We then related these two predictions to annual mean temperature and annual precipitation via the random points across the study region. The rarefied points for annual mean temperature in the camel-based model had a standard deviation of 40.5, whereas those for the model based on any occurrence ranged 49.0-50.2; for annual precipitation, the camel-based model had a standard deviation of 94.7, whereas those for the anyoccurrence model ranged 236.2-253.1 (Fig. 4) . Hence, with respect to both temperature and precipitation, the diversity of environments indicated as suitable based on camel-based exposures was significantly less than the diversity of environments so identified based on all occurrences (P < 0.01, in both cases).",

Dots represent camel-exposed cases; X's represent any case occurrence the spatial and environmental patterns that we detected, we are nonetheless cognizant of several limitations of this approach. First of all, the occurrence data are quite crude in their geographic localization: because MERS-CoV exposure and infection are rather coarse and diffuse, the occurrence data cannot be georeferenced more finely than multiple kilometers, which limits the spatial detail in our predictions, and constrains us from using remotesensing data to achieve improved spatial resolution [24] .",
