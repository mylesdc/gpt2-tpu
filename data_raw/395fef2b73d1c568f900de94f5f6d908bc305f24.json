African bats are known to harbor a range of pathogens (e.g., Ebola and Marburg viruses) that can infect humans and cause disease outbreaks. A recent study in South Africa isolated a genetic variant closely related to MERS-CoV from an insectivorous bat. Though Madagascar is home to 44 bat species (41 insectivorous and 3 frugivorous) of which 34 are endemic, no data exists concerning the circulation of CoVs in the island's chiropteran fauna. Certain Malagasy bats can be frequently found in close contact with humans and frugivorous bats feed in the same trees where people collect and consume fruits and are hunted and consumed as bush meat. The purpose of our study is to detect and identify CoVs from frugivorous bats in Madagascar to evaluate the risk of human infection from infected bats. Methods: Frugivorous bats belonging to three species were captured in four different regions of Madagascar. We analyzed fecal and throat swabs to detect the presence of virus through amplification of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene, which is highly conserved in all known coronaviruses. Phylogenetic analyses were performed from positive specimens.",

Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the Malagasy strains belong to the genus Betacoronavirus but form three distinct clusters, which seem to represent previously undescribed genetic lineages. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that CoVs circulate in frugivorous bats of Madagascar, demonstrating the needs to evaluate spillover risk to human populations especially for individuals that hunt and consume infected bats. Possible dispersal mechanisms as to how coronaviruses arrived on Madagascar are discussed.",

In humans, CoVs infections are commonly caused by HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 which generally cause mild respiratory illnesses [3] . A new CoV that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) emerged in humans in 2002-2003 and infected more than 8,000 individuals with mortality rates estimated at around 10% [4] . The emergence of SARS-CoV and its mortality rate have raised the risk of a new pandemic that could threaten public health. For this reason, the scientific community invested considerable interest in the identification and characterization of CoVs especially within mammal reservoirs. Subsequently, two novel human CoVs were discovered: HCoV-NL63 in 2004 [5] and HCoV-HKU1 in 2005 [6] . In June 2012, a third novel coronavirus named HCoV-EMC/2012 (renamed MERS-CoV) was isolated from patients presenting with acute respiratory distress and pulmonary inflammation [7, 8] .",

Bats have since become a particular focus and a number of Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronaviruses have been identified in many frugivorous and insectivorous bat species and in many countries worldwide in Asia, the Americas and Europe (see review from Drexler et al. 2014) [12] . Genomic characterization of the recently discovered MERS-CoV showed that this virus belongs to the genus Betacoronavirus and seems to be closely related to bat coronaviruses HKU4 and HKU5 isolated from bats (Tylonycteris and Pipistrellus) [13] .",

Some authors have reported the detection of bat CoVs from mainland Africa [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . A recent study in South Africa detected a genetic variant closely related to MERS-CoV from Neoromicia zuluensis, an insectivorous bat [22] . The authors hypothesize that MERS-CoV may have a common ancestors with CoVs borne by bats from Africa. Though Madagascar is home to 44 bat species (41 insectivorous and 3 frugivorous) of which 34 are endemic [23] [24] [25] , no data exists concerning the circulation of CoVs in Malagasy bats. Certain bat species on the island can be frequently found in close contact with humans, particularly members of the family Molossidae; these synanthropic species roost in human-occupied buildings, like houses, schools or hospitals [26] , whilst frugivorous bats feed in the same fruit trees where people collect and consume fruits. Moreover, hunting and consumption of bat bush meat, especially the larger frugivorous species of the family Pteropodidae, is widespread on the island, bringing hunters, purveyors and consumers into contact with bats [27] . In this study, we report the detection of CoVs amongst frugivorous bats in Madagascar. Our results demonstrated for the first time that CoVs belonging to the genus Betacoronavirus are circulating amongst two endemic frugivorous bats species in Madagascar.",

Bayes factor analysis employing marginal likelihoods, as detailed in [12] . All parameter combinations produced identical, strongly supported tree topologies (data not shown). As has elsewhere been determined by Lau et al. [12] , Bayesian skyline using a relaxed, exponentially distributed clock model was found to be the best fitting model for RdRp dated-tip phylogenies. The final phylogenetic analyses ( Figure 2 ) revealed that strains from Madagascar are members of the Betacoronavirus genus, rooting with Hong Kong strain BtCoV-HKU9 (HM211100) and Kenyan strain KY77 (GU065421), with posterior probabilities of 1. These lineages could be described as SARS-like, and were uniquely affiliated with frugivorous bat hosts of the family Pteripodidae. Malagasy strains were sub-divided into three distinct clusters: two of which were closely related (clusters 1 and 2) and originating from P. rufus, and one more distantly related (cluster 3) containing a strain detected from E. dupreanum and sequences previously detected from E. helvum in Kenya [21] .",

Our strains displayed 3 distinct clusters: 2 clusters associated with P. rufus and 1 cluster associated with E. dupreanum. It can be inferred from the results that multiple clusters of CoVs occurring within Malagasy bat populations co-circulate and possibly in a syntopic manner. The high nucleotide and amino acid divergence between clusters and compared to the reference virus BtCoV-HKU9 suggests previously undescribed genetic lineages. Given the mobility of bats, and the especially long distances that can be travelled by colonies of fruit bats [37] , these coronaviruses may be spread over a large region. However, host-genus-specific phylogenetic clustering (Figure 2 , inset) suggests likely host-specificity which may limit viral spill-over. Thus, further molecular epidemiology studies would be required to fully understand the dispersal potential of CoVs amongst Malagasy bats species.",

More studies are needed in different locations including different species, particularly those with an insectivorous diet, to reveal a more comprehensive view of the diversity of these viruses in Madagascar. Since the strains of Betacoronavirus identified from Madagascar are closely related to those known from Africa, some preliminary biogeographic considerations are in order. All three bat species analyzed herein are endemic to Madagascar. The genus Pteropus has a broad distribution from the Australia-New Guinea region west across the Indian Ocean to offshore islands of Tanzania; it is unknown from the African continent. The genus Eidolon is composed of two species: E. helvum occurring on the African mainland and offshore islands and E. dupreanum restricted to Madagascar. Based on a phylogeographical study, both species show broad panmictic population structure [38] . Further, these two taxa are estimated to have diverged from one another sometime in the late Miocene or early Pliocene [39] . The genus Rousettus is broadly distributed across Africa and Asia and the ancestral origin of the Malagasy species, R. madagascariensis, is unresolved [40] . As with the other two Pteropodidae species occurring on Madagascar, R. madagascariensis shows little genetic population structure and presumably broadly disperses across the island, which in turn has important epidemiological implications for these bats transmitting different zoonoses.",

The primers pair (Forward 5\u2032-GGTTGGGACTATCCTAAGTGTGA-3\u2032; Reverse 5\u2032-C CATCATCAGATAGAATCATCATA-3\u2032) was designed to amplify a 440 bp fragment as described previously [47] . Reaction mixture was carried out using the GoTaq/dNTP mix, Custom kit (Promega Corporation, Madison, USA). Briefly, 5 \u03bcL of cDNA was mixed with 1 X of Green GoTaq Flexi Buffer, 1.5 mM of MgCl 2 , 0.2 mM of each dNTP, 0.2 \u03bcM of each primer, 0.025 U/\u03bcL of GoTaq DNA Polymerase and 28.75 \u03bcL of water nuclease-free giving a final volume of 50 \u03bcL. The thermocycling was performed under the following conditions: activation at 95\u00b0C for 10 min and 40 cycles of denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 1 min, annealing at 58\u00b0C for 1 min, extension at 72\u00b0C for 1 min, and a final extension at 72\u00b0C for 5 min. All negative samples were tested in a semi-nested PCR with the same PCR program and using the following pair of primers (Forward 5\u2032-GGTTG GGACTATCCTAAGTGTGA-3\u2032; Reverse 5\u2032-ATCAGATA GAATCATCATAGAGA-3\u2032). Amplicons products were subsequently electrophorezed on a 2.0% agarose gel and visualized using ethidium bromide under UV light. All specimens that showed a positive band at the expected size (440 bp) were sequenced on both strands by Beckman Coulter Genomics (Essex, UK).",

Alignment was performed using the translation alignment tool in Geneious pro\u2122 v.6.3.2, created by Biomatters (available from http:// www.geneious.com/), and the default ClustalW cost matrix. The final alignment was respectively 329 bp and 993 bp in length for fragments 440 bp and 1086 bp, and contained no free-end or internal gaps. From these alignments, the appropriate substitution model was identified in jModeltest v.2.1.2 [29, 49] . Using the appropriate substitution model, 2*10^8 iterations were run with or without the use of a 3base codon model, using different clock models, alternating between constant and Bayesian Skyline population size models, and seeding with uncorrelated log-normally distributed priors. Trees were sampled every 2x10^5 iterations, and analysis convergence was assessed in tracer v.1.4.0 [50] (available from http://beast.bio.ed.ac.uk/tracer). All analyses converged after a 10% burn-in to give Effective Sample Size values for all parameters superior to 200. Bayes factor analyses were performed in Tracer v1.4.0, with 1000 bootstrap replicates to assess the relative performance of model selections on the generated phylogenies. After identification of an optimal model for phylogenetic classification and dating, two further independent analyses (2*10^8 iterations, sampling every 2*10^5 iterations) were run in BEAST, and all analyses were combined in logCombiner (BEAST package) with a burn-in of 10%, leaving only converged parameter estimates. The final phylogeny and MRCA for fragments 993 bp in length dates were extracted using TreeCombiner (BEAST package) and FigTree v.1.4.0 (available at http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/).",
