Besides this, it is shown that keratinocytes do contain Nacetyltransferase 1 (NAT1) which modifies p-PD by monoand di-N-acetylation, thereby modulating its toxicity [14] [15] [16] . The effect of p-PD was investigated in different cell types and was found to cause apoptosis via ROS [17] [18] [19] .

The cell line was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, USA) in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO 2 and 95% air at 37 \u2218 C [20] . The stock solution of p-PD (100 mg/mL) was dissolved in DMSO and different concentrations were prepared in the culture medium with a final DMSO concentration of 0.1%. Both types of cells were seeded at a density of 4 \u00d7 10 5 cells/30 mm plate and grown for 24 h up to 40% confluence. The culture medium was replaced with new medium before adding different concentrations of p-PD to treat the cells for indicated time points. 0.1% DMSO was used as the vehicle control.",

To further verify this, we have performed haematological and serum biochemical parameters measurement of the treated mice along with the control (up to 6 weeks). Study revealed that there are no mortality and toxic symptoms with no biochemical changes in the major organs of the test groups treated with higher selected dose (10 mg/kg p-PD).

To delineate the possibilities, we have used the same cell lysates that were prepared to show the activation of PARP (as in Figure 3 ) to check the presence of the active forms of these caspases using immunoblot. Interestingly, in the shorter time points (6 and 24 hours), only caspase 8 gets activated ( Figure 5(a), lanes 3, 4, and 6-8) . Activation of caspase 9 is only seen in the samples treated for 48 hours (Figure 5(b),  lanes 2-4) . It is known that activated caspase 8 may lead to activation of Bid, a Bcl-2 family protein which in turn destabilizes mitochondrial membrane to initiate caspase 9 mediated intrinsic pathways [35] . To explore this possibility, we have checked the decrease of full-length Bid in the cell lysates using western blot with anti-Bid antibody. At 6 and 24 hours' time points, the amount of Bid remained unaltered ( Figure 5(a), lanes 1-8) , but its gradual decrease is observed in samples treated with increasing concentration of p-PD for 48 hours ( Figure 5(b), lanes 1-4) . It is apparent from these results that the extrinsic pathway is activated before the intrinsic one in p-PD treated melanoma cells.",

Pharmacological inhibitors of caspases are used to identify the primary caspase, the activation of which is responsible for the initiation of apoptosis [36] . We have performed experiments using different caspase inhibitors and assessed cell viability and apoptosis in response to p-PD treatment. For that, cells that were incubated with caspase inhibitors were treated with p-PD for 24 hours and cell viability was measured by MTT based assay. The result clearly demonstrated that cells pretreated with caspase 8 inhibitor showed significant increase in viable cell ( \u2021, Figure 6 ) or decrease in dead cell numbers ( , Figure 6 ) upon p-PD treatment as compared to cells without the inhibitor ( Figure 6 ). The protective effects of the inhibitor of caspase 8 were 55, 41, and 45% for 20, 40, and 100 g/mL of p-PD, respectively. It is obvious that this effect of the inhibitor is more in the cells treated with lesser p-PD. While the inhibitor of caspase 9 showed no protection in p-PD induced cell death, the PAN inhibitor of caspases significantly prevented cell death induced by higher dosage of p-PD in particular. This protective effect of caspase 8 inhibitor on apoptosis was also verified by flow cytometry experiments where the numbers of Annexin V positive cells in response to p-PD (24 hours) were reduced by 37 and 73% for early and late apoptosis, respectively, when pretreated with caspase 8 inhibitor as compared to the \"no inhibitor\" set. These results demonstrate that a large extent of p-PD induced apoptotic death of melanoma cells is mediated by the activation of caspase 8.",

Reduction in the ratio of reduced and oxidized glutathione (GSH : GSSG) and increase in the activities of enzymes such as glutathione reductase (GR) and catalase are commonly used as standard indicators for cellular oxidative stress/ROS. The result of our measurements demonstrates that the catalase and GR activities were increased by 22 \u00b1 2% and 39 \u00b1 8.6%, respectively, in the lysates of cells treated with 100 g/mL of p-PD for 24 hours (Table 4 ). There was a substantial reduction in the amount of GSH (70 \u00b1 13%) resulting in an 80 \u00b1 9% decrease of GSH : GSSG ratio in the p-PD treated cells. All these biochemical lines of evidence in conjunction with the flow cytometric data strongly indicate that p-PD treatment actually imparts a strong oxidative stress to the cells. a These changes indicate percent decrease of the respective parameters in the treated samples. Each set of data is averaged from three different experiments.",

Parameters were measured as described in Section 2.5. We used control cells and cells treated for 24 hours with 100 g/mL of p-PD for these experiments. GSH was expressed as nmol mg \u22121 protein; catalase and glutathione reductase activities were expressed as nmol min \u22121 mg \u22121 protein. At this point, we have used NAC and glutathione (GSH) pretreatment before p-PD exposure to validate the effect of ROS on apoptosis of melanoma cells. It is clear from Table 5 that these pretreatments, specifically NAC, decreased the amount of ROS induced by p-PD (40 g/mL). These pretreatments also reduced extent of apoptosis in p-PD treated cells (Table 5 ). This result strongly established a correlation between the ROS generation and the apoptotic death of p-PD treated melanoma cells. Furthermore, to investigate whether p-PD mediated depletion of MMP is dependent on ROS or not, a similar experiment with NAC was done. Flow cytometry analysis using JC 1 confirms that MMP destabilization is independent of ROS generation indicating that ROS production is downstream to the disruption of MMP.",

However, suppression of ROS by NAC showed marked reduction in p-PD mediated apoptotic death in vitro (Table 5 ). This observation in conjunction with the fact that the loss of MMP occurred much earlier than the induction of ROS clearly indicates that the mitochondria are one of the primary targets of p-PD (see text). The activation of caspase 8 which took place after the initiation of loss in MMP but before the generation of ROS suggests that mitochondria possibly have a role in its activation as shown elsewhere [40] . It seems that the activation of caspase 8 and the stimulation of ROS take place via two independent pathways that may subsequently have positive feedback on each other. Indeed, there are reports that showed similar interactions between ROS and activation of caspase 8 [41, 42] . Although disruption of MMP occurred very early in response to lower concentration of p-PD, the activation of caspase 9 was only observed in cells treated with higher concentration of p-PD for 24 Figure 7 : p-PD depolarizes mitochondrial membrane potential of both melanoma cells. p-PD treated (as indicated for two hours) and untreated (0 g/mL) melanoma cells were subjected to JC 1 staining for the measurement of MMP. For both cell lines, cell clusters which are high in PE fluorescence are gated in the top of each dot plot (red and green for B16-F10 and A375 cells, resp.) presenting the healthy cell population. Cell clusters that are gated for low PE fluorescence in the bottom part of each dot plot (green and blue for B16-F10 and A375 cells, resp.) are representing the cells with depolarized mitochondria. Cell percentage values of the gated population are stating the effect of p-PD in the polarization of mitochondria. One piece of the representative experimental data is shown here. Each set was performed in triplicate. not necessarily lead to the release of cytochrome C [43, 44] . In our case, p-PD being a cell permeable reducing agent may have caused the disruption of MMP without any appreciable release of cytochrome C as evident from no activation of caspase 9 at the same time.",

The incidence of skin cancer is on the rise especially among the Caucasian population [2, 3] . Case fatality for melanoma is probably the highest, not only among skin cancers but also among all types of cancers [45, 46] . At present, highdose interleukin-2 (IL-2) and more recently anti-CTLA-4 (Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte Antigen 4) that works through activation of the immune system are the only therapies resulting in long-term disease-free intervals [47] . Despite decades of systematic therapeutic investigations using cytotoxic, immunologic, and now molecularly targeted agents, the survival rate among treated patients with advanced melanoma is very discouraging [48] . Our study shows for the first time that both human and mouse melanoma cells undergo ROS mediated apoptotic death when treated with p-PD but not with o-PD in vitro. Most importantly, peritoneal injection of 2 and 4 mg/kg of p-PD inhibited the growth rate of B16-F10 induced melanoma tumour in mice ( Figure 2 ). However, month-long peritoneal administration of as high as 100 mg/kg of p-PD did not show any sign of toxicity in Swiss-Albino mice. The total number of Annexin V positive cells is increased in tumours of p-PD treated mice. This observation substantiates our in vitro finding that p-PD mediates apoptotic death of melanoma cells.",
