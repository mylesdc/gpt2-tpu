Results RAS is dysregulated during mouse H7N9 infection. Two research groups cloned the ACE homolog ACE2 independently in 2000 23 . ACE2 negatively regulates RAS by inactivating Ang II 24 . To assess the effect of influenza virus infection on RAS directly, mice were infected with live influenza Hb01/H7N9 virus. Influenza A (H7N9) virus infection in WT mice caused the development of pulmonary edema and an increase in lung viral titers. Importantly, the WT mice infected with influenza H7N9 virus downregulated ACE2 protein markedly on day 3 after infection. In contrast, the expression of ACE in the lungs was comparable between H7N9-infected and control mice ( Figure 1A) .",

The kinetics of Ang II expression was also quantified in patients who recovered from H7N9 infection ( Figure S1B ; Table S2 and S3). Data revealed that plasma Ang II levels decreased sharply from the early to the late phase of influenza A (H7N9) virus infection in the recovered population.

We next investigated whether ACE2 could mediate or protect mice from 2013 H7N9 influenza infection-induced ALI. ACE2 KO mice that were infected with influenza Hb01/H7N9 virus exhibited survival rates that were reduced significantly compared with WT mice (Figure 2A) . Specifically, the survival rate of WT mice was 20%, whereas no KO mice survived for at least 9 days after influenza Hb01/H7N9 virus infection. Similarly, the lung histopathology and lung injury scores, as defined by leukocyte infiltration cell counts, were worsened significantly in ACE2 KO mice compared with WT ( Figure 2B ). Moreover, lung edema, defined by the wet-to-dry weight ratio of lung tissue, was much more severe in ACE2 KO mice ( Figure 2C ). In addition, the influenza Hb01/H7N9 virus nucleoprotein (NP) copy number was also increased greatly in the KO mice ( Figure 2D ). Consistent with this, the lung viral titers of the ACE KO mice were also increased significantly ( Figure 2E ). Therefore, these results suggest that ACE2 plays an important role in mediating H7N9 influenza-induced ALI, and that interfering with ACE2 expression might attenuate the disease severity and increase survival following respiratory H7N9 infection.",

We next attempted to rescue the ALI in WT mice infected with influenza Hb01/H7N9 virus using specific AT1 and AT2 receptor blockers. Inhibiting AT1 alleviated the severity of influenza Hb01/H7N9 virus-induced lung injury significantly in WT mice, as determined by the lung wet-to-dry ratio and histopathology ( Figures 3A and 3B) . Similarly, the NP copy number and viral titers were decreased significantly in the lungs of H7N9 virus-infected WT mice treated with AT1 receptor blockers ( Figures 3C and D) . In contrast, inhibiting AT2 had no significant effect on the ALI phenotypes ( Figure S2 ), suggesting that actions of Ang II via the AT1 receptor play a critical role in influenza A (H7N9) virus-induced ALI. Inhibiting AT1 attenuates H7N9-induced lung injury in ACE2 KO mice. Similarly, the lung wet-to-dry ratio of H7N9 virusinfected ACE2 KO mice treated with At1 receptor blockers was decreased and the pathological lung alterations were improved ( Figures 4A and 4B) . Similarly, the NP copy number and viral titers were decreased significantly in the lungs of H7N9 virusinfected ACE2 KO mice treated with AT1 receptor blockers ( Figure 4C and D) . Consistent with our observations in WT mice, there was no apparent effect on lung edema and histopathology when ACE2 KO mice were treated with AT2 receptor blockers (data not shown). These results suggest that ACE2 might play a crucial role in influenza A (H7N9) virus infection-induced ALI via the AT1 receptor. Based on these data, schematic diagrams of the RAS in influenza A (H7N9) virus-induced ALI have been proposed ( Figure 4E ). Taken together, these data suggest that the novel influenza H7N9 virus causes severe ALI in a experimental mouse model at least in part by altering the RAS via ACE2 expression that targets AT1.",
