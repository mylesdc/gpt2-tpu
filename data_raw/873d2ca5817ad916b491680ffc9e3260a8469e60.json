These estimated incubation periods are lower than other estimates, such as Legrand et al. [3] and Eichner et al. [4] . These differences may be partly attributed to different virus subtypes [4] . WHO estimated a mean incubation period for the first 9 months of the West African outbreak of 11.4 days, with an upper limit of 21 days [5] and, more recently, Chowell estimated mean incubation period of 12.7 days and mean infectious period of 6.5 days [6] . EbolaResponse allows adjusting the probability distribution to almost any structure desired, with an upper limit of 25 days incubation. While the specific probability distribution used for incubation periods affected the point estimates of the results, they do not affect the overall conclusions of the report.",

The WHO Ebola Response Team estimated the interval from symptoms onset to death was 7.5 days by September 2014 [5] and 8.2 days by the end of November 2014 [7] . A detailed study of chains of transmission between February and August 2014, estimated an infectious period of 8.9 days [8] . A recent parameter review of all EVD epidemics found that the mean time from symptom onset to death in all previous epidemics ranged from 6 to 10.1 days [9] , and a modeling study for previous outbreaks estimated 6.5 days as the infectious period [10] . Because the purpose of our estimate is to illustrate what could have happened had the Ebola outbreak of West Africa expanded beyond the three mostly affected countries, we used the best estimate from WHO for the West Africa outbreak, i.e., an infectious period of 8 days [7] . We found no data reporting measurement of changes in the risk of onward transmission over the duration of fulminate illness. It would be conceivable, therefore, that such risk does change as a patient becomes sicker and requires more and more care. We assumed that the risk of onward transmission (infection) from patient to susceptible was equal throughout the 8-day period. Last, burial practices in the region show potential risk of EVD transmission during a traditional burial due to possible contact with a victim's body fluids [11] . Safe 5 burial practices were considered as a component of the safe community isolation intervention in our model (see section on distribution of patient by category over time).",

To calculate the number of projected cases in each city, we assigned a proportion of patients to either \"hospitalized\", \"effective community isolation\" or \"no effective isolation\" for each of the growth scenarios outlined above. Using the EbolaResponse model [1] , we input each city's population and assumed either 10 or 100 cases occur before detection and initiation of an effective response (hereafter seeding). We estimated low and high case count estimates based on number of cases that occur before detection and initiation of an effective response (hereafter seeding; low case count: 10 cases; high case count: 100 cases). The difference in speed of initiation of an effective response could be due to multiple causes, including the speed of outbreak detection and the speed with which resources can be gathered and deployed. The total number of new cases was then added over 120 days to produce the total cumulative case counts. Bed capacity and diagnostic capabilities are an important limitation to the effectiveness of a response to Ebola [15, 16] .",

The number of cases represents possible scenarios of intervention, and we used the same criteria as before: delayed transmission for lower income countries, Liberia-like transmission for lower-middle income countries, and fast transmission for upper income countries. Table S7 shows the estimated number of Ebola cases at four months (120 days) based on national resources and response scenarios, by city in selected countries (column A shows the baseline estimates, column B shows estimates weighted by population density). By design, the projected number of cases depends on the speed with which we assume that effective control measures are implemented. With our current assumptions, early detection of cases and rapid initiation of control measures is particularly important in the major cities of low-income countries (Ethiopia).
