We studied common polymorphisms in the genes of proinflammatory cytokines (IL6 rs1800795, IL8 rs4073, IL1B rs16944), anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL10 rs1800896, IL4 rs2243250, IL13 rs20541) and toll-like receptors (TLR2 rs5743708 and rs4696480, TLR4 rs4986791, TLR9 rs352139, rs5743836 and rs187084) in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) (390 cases, 203 controls) and nosocomial pneumonia (355 cases, 216 controls). Experimental data were included in a series of 11 meta-analyses and eight subset analyses related to pneumonia susceptibility and outcome. TLR2 rs5743708 minor genotype appeared to be associated with CAP/Legionnaires' disease/pneumococcal disease. In CAP patients, the IL6 rs1800795-C allele was associated with severe sepsis/septic shock/severe systemic inflammatory response, while the IL10 rs1800896-A allele protected against the development of these critical conditions. To contribute to deciphering of the above results, we performed an in silico analysis and a qualitative synthesis of literature data addressing basal and stimulated genotype-specific expression level. This data together with database information on transcription factors' affinity changes caused by SNPs in putative promoter regions, the results of linkage disequilibrium analysis along with SNPs functional annotations supported assumptions about the complexity underlying the revealed associations.",

Pneumonia is classified according to the site of acquisition as community-acquired (CAP) and hospital-acquired (or nosocomial) pneumonia (HAP or NP), which includes healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). HAP tends to be a more serious problem than CAP since HAP patients have an increased risk of infection caused by antibiotic-resistant organisms, besides they are often older and burdened by comorbidities. Pneumonia is considered to be the the most prevalent cause of sepsis associated with the highest mortality rates 1 .",

Most infectious phenotypes result from a complex interplay between multiple genetic factors related to host and pathogen genetics and a variety of non-genetic factors. Since infectious diseases are related to immune-mediated disorders, genetic susceptibility loci for immune traits can be considered as good candidates in genetic association studies of pneumonia and its complications 3 . The first line of defence of the innate immune system is represented by pattern-recognition receptors that sense bacterial, viral or fungal molecular structures and induce systemic inflammation. The most studied class of pattern-recognition receptors is that of the toll-like receptors (TLRs). Once inflammation has been launched a crosstalk between pro-and anti-inflammatory branches of the immune response should provide a balanced immune reaction crucial for a favorable resolution of infection.",

The relationship between host genetics and clinical phenotypes is mediated through a large number of factors and interactions, which are essentially a \"black box\". To contribute to deciphering of this \"black box\" in terms of the studied genes several additional investigations were performed. We combined an in silico analysis and literature data analysis to evaluate the genotype-dependent basal and ex-vivo stimulated expression level. Since the majority of common SNPs in the immune genes are located in promoter regions and thus may influence expression level, we provided an in silico analysis of allele-specific binding affinity of TFs. With the use of database information, we also explored linkage disequilibrium structure along with functional annotations of the SNPs within the genes under study.",

HAP studies comprised the most heterogeneous group of observations. Sixteen studies indicated infectious pathogens (Supplementary Table S4 ), among them, five researches considered viral pneumonia. Deviations for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in controls were reveled mainly in the studies of the IL10 SNPs (two works for each of the three considered polymorphic sites). Eighteen studies were performed in European population, two studies were conducted in Asian population, and three papers analyzed mixed population. All but four investigations were implemented in adult populations. Addressing pneumonia critical complications, the only available type of similar data in different studies was revealed for severe sepsis/septic shock in CAP/pneumococcal disease. In the analysis of this type of poor outcome, we also included our own results and data from the study of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) in CAP patients (SIRS IV vs. SIRS I+ II) 14 .",

Taking into account these considerations, we limited a spectrum of analyzed studies by the use of pneumonia related pathogen stimuli and considered samples only from healthy volunteers. Additional treatment, if applied, was also indicated to compare results for different stimuli in the same studies. Data from genetic association studies of interleukin genes polymorphisms and ex vivo response to bacterial toxins are collected in Supplementary Table S6 . Studies differed by population ethnicity, polymorphic sites, cellular sources, and in vitro incubation protocols. Several studies measured mRNA, but the majority assessed protein secretion. Due to high variability, we could not perform quantitative data synthesis and present here the results of qualitative analysis. Summary for IL10 investigations is given in a block diagram (Fig. 3a) . The majority of studies have measured lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-stimulated IL10 production in association with IL10 -1082G/A (rs1800896) genotype or haplotypes including -1082 alleles and testified that IL10 -1082G allele may be a high producing allele. Since LPS is released from Gram-negative bacteria, the results should be extrapolated on Gram-positive species (e.g. Streptococcus pneumonia, Staphylococcus aureus) with caution. Proportions of data with genotype-linked LPS-induced up-regulation, down-regulation or non-significant associations for all studied cytokines are shown in Fig. 3b ,c. Proportions are given for the number of studies (Fig. 3b) and for the number of subjects in these studies (Fig. 3c) . Data for cytokines other than IL10 could not be interpreted due to a small number of studies/subjects and contradictory associations. Similar analysis was not performed for toll-like receptor genes because genetic variations in these genes were mainly studied in association with cytokine expression.",

Twenty seven SNPs including studied SNPs (IL10 rs1800896, IL6 rs1800795, IL1B rs16944, IL8 rs4073, IL4 rs2243250, TLR9 rs5743836 and rs187084) were identified in the putative promoter regions of the studied genes (2 kb upstream of a transcription start site).

IL6, IL10 and TLR2 genes are of the greatest interest in regard with the results of our meta-analysis. Data for these genes are given in Fig. 6 , while characteristics of the remaining genes are provided in Supplementary Figure S3 . IL6 SNPs are in high LD; SNPs in putative promoter region, including rs1800795 have some regulatory potential, however the highest in silico functionality is predicted for the intron SNP rs2069832 which is adjacent to rs1800795 (distance 788 bp). IL10 SNPs are in weak LD; putative promoter SNPs including rs1800896 have little if any regulatory potential. Three IL10 SNPs were associated with diseases in the NHGRI GWAS Catalog (Supplementary Table S9 ). Several intron and 3' downstream SNPs that are not linked with the SNP rs1800896 may be more functional than the latter one. An analysis of LD blocks and functional annotations of the IL6 SNPs shows that biological effects of these SNPs may be substantially influenced by the effects of proxy SNPs, while for the IL10 SNPs the influence of neighboring SNPs is not profound. The TLR2 functional variations are SNPs in coding regions, especially non-synonymous SNPs with known deleterious effects due to amino-acid change. Among SNPs in the other genes under study (Supplementary Figure S3) , functional SNPs are located predominantly in the IL1B, IL13 and TLR9 gene; two SNPs in the IL13 gene and one SNP in the TLR4 gene have been associated with several disorders and traits in the NHGRI GWAS Catalog (Supplementary Table S9 ).",

Nevertheless, we did not obtain results significant after correction for multiple comparisons. This is a rather typical situation, since common polymorphic variants have low penetrance and cannot provide strong association effects, meanwhile, more sites are analyzed the less probability that results will remain significant after testing for multiplicity. In view of this, the revealed association of the IL4 rs2243250-T allele with NP, which is in line with the results of the recent meta-analysis (see please the Results section), seems worthwhile. Although IL4 is usually considered in regard to the immunoglobulin Figure 6 . Linkage disequilibrium plots of the IL6, IL10 and TLR2 gene regions generated with the LD tag SNP selection tool within SNPinfo resource. Pair-wise LD values are indicated by different color, which changes from red to white as the D' value decreases. SNP name is colored with genomic context: black, intron region; red: coding region; blue, UTR (untranslated) region, green, non-genic region. Minor allele frequency for each SNP in European population is denoted by the height of green bar. Functional annotations from the SNP info web server are shown with red arrows: one arrow, regulatory potential is in the range of 0.10-0.20; two arrows, regulatory potential is in the range of 0.20-0.30; three arrows, regulatory potential is higher than 0.30. Functional annotations from the RegulomeDB info web server are represented with dark blue arrows: one arrow, score 2a-f; two arrows, score 1a-f. Scores 3-7 are not provided. SNPs with category 7 score lack evidence of regulatory function, while category 1 variants are assumed to affect binding and expression of a gene target. Within subcategories a-f, variant scored as 1a has the highest confidence on functionality. Functional annotations from the NHGRI GWAS Catalog are marked by green arrows. The number of arrows corresponds to the number of the associations in the Catalog.",

            "text": "Currently, there are a limited number of pneumonia-related meta-analyses of genetic association studies. In contrary to the majority of other common diseases, which are often subjected to numerous and repetitive meta-analyses, pneumonia meta-analyses considered a narrow range of genes and have never been updated (with the exception for the IL6 association with pneumonia) (https://phgkb.cdc.gov/HuGENavigator/phenoPedia.do). Our study is the first to summarize data from individual papers on the role of TLR2 SNPs in pneumonia/pneumococcal infection. Among TLRs, TLR2 is a receptor with the widest range of recognized pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) including PAMPs from Gram-positive bacteria 29 . There was no association of TLR2 with pneumonia in the whole set of meta-analyzed studies. Given that HAP is an extremely heterogeneous disease, we performed a stratified meta-analysis of CAP/Legionnaires' disease/pneumococcal disease studies. Minor genotype TLR2 rs5743708 GA/AA was associated with infection in this subset. To access an influence of amino-acid change (753 Arg > Gln) on enzyme structure and activity we utilized the HOPE resource 30 . The mutant residue differs from the wild-type one by size, charge and hydrophobic properties; multimer contacts peculiar to wild-type protein may be blocked in the mutant protein. To identify numerous PAMPs, TLR2 forms either homodimers or heterodimers with TLR1 or TLR6. The TLR2 rs5743708 G to A transition leads to a functional deficiency in heterodimerization with TLR6 with subsequent diminished activation of intracellular signaling pathways 31 . This change in TLR2 function correlates with the observed influence of this SNP on susceptibility to infections 6, 32 .",

Severe sepsis/septic shock were associated with the IL6 rs1800795 GC-CC and IL10 rs1800896 G/G genotypes. The result for IL6 was observed on the relatively large sample therefore it seems more reliable than the summary estimate for IL10 based on the smaller sample size. Data for the IL6 genotype GC-CC were also supported by its association with further worsening of critical illness from severe sepsis to septic shock in pneumonia patients 33, 34 . IL6 is a multi-functional cytokine with both pro-and anti-inflammatory properties and a central role in host defence 35 . IL10 is the most potent anti-immune and anti-inflammatory cytokine. In infection, it provides a balance between immunosuppression and immunostimulation to maintain a homeostatic state 36 . Since both cytokines are key players in orchestrating immune response, we assume that alleles that protected against severe complications in pneumonia patients (the IL6 rs1800795-G and IL10 rs1800896-A) may provide more effective regulation in the cytokine network in specific pathophysiological conditions. An assay for ex vivo cytokine stimulation is often applied to study genetically mediated interindividual variations of cytokine production upon specific stimuli. The results of such an assay provide data for classification of common polymorphic variants as \"low\" or \"high\" production ones. Ex vivo stimulated secretion of cytokines is considered to be more standardized assay than in vivo measurement of cytokine level. Ex vivo spontaneous cytokine production was declared not to occur or occur at low levels albeit with some exceptions 37 . Hence, in genetic association studies, the results of the ex vivo stimulation can be interpreted in terms of more or less inducibility for the carriers of different genotypes. There are many methodical circumstances influencing stimulated expression level, the most important of them, in vivo pre-existent conditions, the use of PBMCs vs. whole blood, the length of the incubation period, single or several concentrations of the stimuli applied and even the origin of this stimuli 16, 37, 38 . In general, literature data support an existing classification exclusively for the IL10 \"high\" and \"low\" producing genotypes but only in certain cell types and in terms of LPS-induced ex-vivo IL10 secretion. Utilizing the SNPexp resource we showed that basal mRNA expression level was weakly affected by genetic background.",

IL10 protein level has been not affected by IL10 SNPs in three studies of CAP 39, 40, 46 and one study of NP 47 . Significant but opposite results have been shown for -1082 G/G genotype associated with lower production of IL10 after CPB 48 and with higher secretion of IL10 in burned patients 49 .

            "text": "Functional common SNPs in cytokine genes are mainly located in putative promoter regions. They may fall inside TFBS and alter transcription factor DNA-binding ability. We explored 2 kbp 5\u2032 -upstrem gene region of the studied genes for common SNPs and analyzed their sequence-specific influence on TF binding affinity. Our analysis showed that GATA1-3 factors were highly overrepresented in the set. GATA1-3 factors play a pivotal role in hematopoiesis but also are known to be involved in innate and adaptive immunity. They regulate immune response against different pathogens including those that may cause pneumonia 52 . Among other common TFs there were HSFs (heat-shock factors). SNPs that influence binding affinity of HSFs were located in anti-inflammatory cytokines IL4 (two SNPs), IL10 and in toll-lire receptor genes TLR4, TLR9. Functional activity of these SNPs may be mediated by HSFs' dependent activation of the anti-inflammatory limb of the immune Scientific RepoRts | 6:35021 | DOI: 10.1038/srep35021 response 53 . We also demonstrated that TF family members have similar allele-specific binding affinity (e.g. GATA factors, SOX-related factors) and linked alleles of SNPs may influence binding affinity of the same TF uni or multi-directionally. Clustering of TFBS for the same TF (homotypic clusters of TFBSs (HCTs)) is known to be enriched in promoters. It has been suggested that HCTs provide functional advantages being favorable for recruitment of TFs 54 .",

We did not reveal predominance of functional SNPs in certain regions of the all studied genes; they were more or less evenly distributed within genes. The TLR2 and TLR4 genes size was several times larger than the cytokine genes size. High LD was evident for the IL6, IL4 and IL8 genes while low LD was detected for the TLR2 and TLR4 genes. This means that the estimated genetic associations reflect non-independent effects of tightly linked SNPs in the IL6 and IL4 genes. The TLR2 SNP rs5743708 is not linked with the other functional TLR2 SNP rs5743704 hence the amino-acid change 753Arg > Gln (rs5743708) may solely contribute to the revealed association of the TLR2 gene with pneumonia.",

Our patients were mainly men and the results may not be generalizable to women. Genes with an important role in the development and output of inflammation such as TNFa, IL1R, LTA, TGFb were not included in the analysis. Highly heterogeneous spectrum of pneumonia-related infections in adult and pediatric populations with very different pathogens with different virulence and different sensitivity to antibiotics were considered. The analysis of SNPs influence on DNA -TF binding affinity was limited by the stringent cut-off settings. However, the study has some biological and methodological implications. We combined own experimental data and the results of the meta-analyses with the analyses of the totality of published data (expression studies) and web-based resources. Our original analysis of transcription factors' affinity changes caused by SNPs did not and could not provide an unequivocal interpretation in terms of \"low\" and \"high\" allele-specific expression phenotypes. Instead in silico obtained data demonstrated complexity in an assessment functionality of SNPs that fall inside TFBS. Consideration of the enrichment for the functional SNPs in LD blocks may help to estimate contribution of the individual SNPs in the observed or presumed associations.",
