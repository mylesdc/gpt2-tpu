To help implement the new laws, Health Emergency Response Offices (HERO) were established within China's health administration units at the national, provincial and municipal levels, in Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and in tertiary hospitals [12] . The HEROs within any one province now collectively employ around 1000 staff members, and their role is to help develop and coordinate preparedness planning and emergency response within their jurisdictions, as well as implement the International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR) [13] . However, because staff members were recruited opportunistically from diverse professional backgrounds into the newly established HEROs, they had not been trained systematically in emergency preparedness and response previously. While they received in-service training, this was offered in an ad hoc manner, was not preceded by a needs assessment [14] , and was aimed primarily at improving knowledge of the new laws that did not translate directly into strengthening performance of the HEROs [15, 16] .",

In 2004, the World Association for Disaster and Emergency Medicine (WADEM) proposed a framework for disaster health to facilitate the development of educational programs in the field [17] . Efforts were directed at identifying and defining criteria for assessing disaster health-related competencies, standards for guiding curricular development, and exploring the methods, duration and desired outcomes of training [17\u00b119]. Australia for example, developed a national framework for disaster health education to provide guidance for educators to achieve a standardized and integrated approach across the country [20] . Australia adapted the WADEM recommendations to target seven educational levels, and outlined the curricular contents and outcomes for each level; the seven levels were defined as 1) informing the community, 2) raising awareness of health workers, 3) providing basic knowledge and skills for health workers, 4) advancing the knowledge of health workers who play lead roles in disaster management, 5) enhancing expert knowledge among a small group of health workers, 6) targeting specialist level amongst a small group of individuals, and 7) encouraging research and innovation to further develop the knowledge base of disaster health [20] .",

An immediate priority was to address the WHO requirements for countries to meet the core capacity requirements for implementing the IHR by June 2012 [21] . This paper outlines the consultative process used to conduct the training needs assessment and develop the curriculum for implementation across China, with support from WHO.

Furthermore, while training programs in the past had targeted knowledge and skills required by technical staff such as epidemiologists, laboratory scientists and environmental staff, they had not incorporated skills in mobilizing, managing and coordinating teams across multiple sectors, disciplines and agencies. The respondents stressed the need for adopting interactive learning methods and problemsolving exercises in the classroom, as had been suggested in Chinese publications [26\u00b129]. They supported replacing th\u00e8 hazard-specific' approach with the`all hazards' approach to managing emergencies, development of a competency-based curriculum with modules that addressed specific sets of competency domains, and limiting the duration of in-service training to about 2 to 3 weeks so these interfered minimally with trainees' regular work responsibilities.",

It describes the multimethod approach used to identify training needs systematically, and to adopt international best practice in partnership with senior decision-makers and content experts from the government, academia and the military. The study revealed the overwhelming need to replace didactic teaching, the classical method used across China, with active learning and training methods. The consultative process for developing the curriculum was designed to address the scale of the challenge for coordinating planning and training activities across jurisdictions that cover a population of over 1.3 billion people, and where most provinces have more than 60 million residents. The process required active engagement with experts in government, academia and the military, as well as inputs from 1606 immediate potential beneficiaries. The expert technical advisory panel played a critical role through each step in the ADDIE model, and endorsed the curriculum development process as well as the contents of the curriculum.",

This approach is consistent with the two Chinese symbols that depict``learning'' (f`: xue \u00c2 x\u00f5 \u00c2) -`acquisition of knowledge' and`repeated practice' as inseparable sides of the one coin. Training aimed at strengthening performance has to create opportunities for active learning and experimentation with problem solving exercises to apply and consolidate newly acquired knowledge and skills. The curriculum marks the beginning of a new journey for strengthening the performance of the recently established HEROs in jurisdictions across China. This initial effort focused strongly on meeting the WHO requirements for developing the core capacities required to implement the IHR [21] , and in particular, to strengthen the competencies of the``level four'' health staff [20] who play lead roles in emergency planning and management. Our approach for identifying and developing competencies and standards are consistent with those published by WADEM in 2013 [18, 19] , and in many ways resemble those used in Australia [20] . The initial list of 18 competency domains were derived from the eight core capacities required to implement the IHR [21] and the disaster management cycle of prevention, preparedness, response and recovery [17] , both of which are embedded in Chinese laws and regulations [7\u00b112] . The scope of the task and all aspects of the needs assessment and identification of the competencies were developed through iterative inputs from subject matter experts in the Ministry of Health, academia and the military. The mode of curriculum delivery was based on blended learning methods implicit in Bloom's taxonomy as outlined in the Australian framework [20] . The duration of training for the level four workers In Australia is recommended for 40 hours [20] ; by contrast, our course was conducted over 100 hours because the target group had received little training in the past and included workers with diverse sets of past experience. However, consistent with the WADEM guidelines [17\u00b120], China needs to reconcile its curriculum with international standards and expand its efforts to develop and standardize training frameworks for the other six WADEM levels [20] , as well as interconnect with the``crosscutting'' competencies of workers from the other disciplines that participate in emergency responses [19] . Adopting the international standards and practice will also enhance communications, inter-agency cooperation and inter-operability across China's national borders.",
