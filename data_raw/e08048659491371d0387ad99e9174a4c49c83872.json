            "text": "The 2H phosphoesterase family contains enzymes with two His-X-Ser/Thr motifs in the active site. 2H enzymes are found in all kingdoms of life, sharing little sequence identity despite the conserved overall fold and active site. For many 2H enzymes, the physiological function is unknown. Here, we studied the structure of the 2H family member LigT from Escherichia coli both in the apo form and complexed with different active-site ligands, including ATP, 2 0 -AMP, 3 0 -AMP, phosphate, and NADP + . Comparisons to the well-characterized vertebrate myelin enzyme 2 0 ,3 0 -cyclic nucleotide 3 0 -phosphodiesterase (CNPase) highlight specific features of the catalytic cycle and substrate recognition in both enzymes. The role played by the helix \u03b17, unique to CNPases within the 2H family, is apparently taken over by Arg130 in the bacterial enzyme. Other residues and loops lining the active site groove are likely to be important for RNA substrate binding. We visualized conformational changes related to ligand binding, as well as the position of the nucleophilic water molecule. We also present a low-resolution model of E. coli LigT bound to tRNA in solution, and provide a model for RNA binding by LigT, involving flexible loops lining the active site cavity. Taken together, our results both aid in understanding the common features of 2H family enzymes and help highlight the distinct features in the 2H family members, which must result in different reaction mechanisms. Unique aspects in different 2H family members can be observed in ligand recognition and binding, and in the coordination of the nucleophilic water molecule and the reactive phosphate moiety. Fig 4. Comparison of CNPase and LigT. A. Structural superposition of E. coli LigT (white) and mouse CNPase (blue). Specifically note the unique helix \u03b17 (dark blue) in CNPase, lining the CNPase active site, and blocking access of nucleophiles larger than water. B.

All structures had more than one protein chain in the asymmetric unit, and in general, the one with best-defined electron density for ligands was used in the analyses below.",

The fact that they bind the active site can imply that they may be weak inhibitors, and it can be taken as evidence of a general propensity to bind nucleotides in the active site. The LigT orthologue protein PF0027 from Pyrococcus furiosus was shown to require a GTP cofactor for the RNA ligation reaction [3] , while for the E. coli enzyme, such a cofactor has not been reported. Although we attempted crystallization in the presence of GTP as with ATP, no corresponding GTP electron density was found in the resulting crystals (data not shown). Two similar datasets were collected with ATP, one of which has one ATP bound to only one of the 2 monomers in the asymmetric unit. This ATP molecule probably has a partial occupancy and/or some degree of flexibility, as evidenced by residual difference electron density. The major conformation was built in the structure. The other complex has three ATP molecules for two monomers; the space group remains the same. The reason for this fortuituous ambiguity is unknown. In addition to the ligand in both active sites (Fig 2B) , another ATP in the latter crystal form is bound in the vicinity of it in one monomer; this ATP is also involved in crystal contacts. The binding of this second ATP is a strong indication of a propensity for binding further nucleotides in the active site vicinity by E. coli LigT. Residues interacting with the second ATP include Phe159 and Arg6. Again, the \u03b1-5 0 -phosphate of the active-site ATP is in the same location as the corresponding phosphate in NADP + , and it is similarly coordinated by Arg6, highlighting putative RNA recognition features extending from the active site. As far as the 3 0 -AMP experiment is concerned, one of the 4 monomers in the asymmetric unit has a bound 3 0 -AMP molecule, with the phosphate group in the same position as in the 2 0 -AMP product complex. Binding of the ligand to the remaining monomers is apparently prevented by crystal contacts. The conformation of 3 0 -AMP differs slightly from that observed for 2 0 -AMP, but the essential recognition features remain the same; stacking of the base against Phe48, binding of the phosphate to the two HxTx motifs in the active site, and C-H. . .\u03c0 interaction of the sugar ring against Phe8 ( Fig 2C) . As incubation with 2 0 ,3 0 -cAMP resulted in 2 0 -AMP, the 3 0 -AMP complex is irrelevant for the reaction mechanism.

Other flexible loops close to the LigT active site include the C-terminal hairpin loop \u03b28-\u03b29 and the loop connecting strands \u03b24 and \u03b25.",

In different crystal forms, the active-site loops can be observed in slightly different conformations (Fig 5A) , and especially residues Arg6 and Arg35 take different conformations depending on the bound ligand, further implying their role in phosphomoiety recognition. In a ligand-free active site, also Phe48 is seen to take a conformation distinct from that seen in ligand complexes. Hence, as opposed to CNPase, in which the active site is to a large extent pre-organized for substrate binding [16, 17] , LigT shows more flexibility.",

The Salami structural homology search detected 11 homologous proteins from the PDB, the best hit representing the previous LigT structure. Vertebrate CNPases were not included in this list, which had 2H proteins from bacteria, viruses, and plants; many of these are annotated as 2 0 -5 0 RNA ligases or phosphoesterases. Superposition of the structures indicated highly similar folding, despite sequence identities as low as 7%, and the largest differences were in the loops mentioned above. This result further highlights the flexibility of the active-site vicinal loops and suggests they may be important in RNA substrate recognition in the entire 2H enzyme family. Visualization of the temperature factors in the LigT crystal structure is in line with this loop flexibility (Fig 5C) . The loop corresponding to the \u03b15-\u03b26 loop is also very flexible in mouse CNPase (Fig 5D) . The dynamics of LigT were also studied using MD simulations. Analysis of the root mean square fluctuations (RMSF) during the simulation (Fig 5E) indicates that the most dynamic segments of the protein correspond to the loops described above, surrounding the active-site cavity. The most dynamic structure appears to be the \u03b2 hairpin formed between the two C-terminal \u03b2 strands; interestingly, this hairpin loop is not present in the mammalian CNPase structure. Some loops are more rigid in the simulation than predicted by the crystallographic B factors; this observation may be related to the fact that the reaction product 2 0 -AMP was present in the active site in the simulation run. The results further highlight the flexible nature of the loops, likely to play roles in LigT substrate binding.",

            "text": "To obtain an insight into larger ligand binding, we carried out small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) experiments with samples of LigT and yeast tRNA (Fig 6, Table 2 ). LigT was monomeric in solution, and the obtained 3D shape corresponded closely to that seen in the crystal structure (Chi 2 = 0.8 between experimental SAXS data and calculated data from a LigT monomer). An exception was the highest concentration (>15 mg/ml), which fitted well to a dimeric species; the relevance of this dimerization is not known, and we believe it was an artifact of the very high concentration. tRNA is slightly larger and more elongated than LigT, as expected. A multiphase ab initio modeling approach, taking advantage of the different X-ray scattering properties of RNA and protein, based on SAXS data from the complex and both components alone was employed, and an elongated complex (Fig 6C) fit the experimental data well. The result is a clear indication of the ability of LigT to bind RNA molecules, in this case specifically tRNA. Furthermore, the good fit of the 1:1 complex to the experimental data and the volume of the corresponding ab initio model both imply that the sample was mostly in complex form, with free LigT and tRNA not interfering with SAXS analysis. Whether tRNA would be a true biological substrate or ligand for LigT, is unclear at present, and remains a subject for future work. The fact that tRNA was not observed in the crystal structure can be explained by the commercial yeast tRNA preparation being a mixture of different tRNAs, not homogeneous enough to support crystallization of the complex.",

Structural data [29] from these enzymes incidate that the 2 0 ,5 0 -adenosine bisphophate substrate binds along the opposite side of the active site, compared to LigT and CNPase (Fig 7A) . In CNPase, the side used for 2 0 ,5 0 -adenosine bisphophate in these enzymes is blocked by the \u03b17 helix, which coordinates the nucleophilic water. In LigT, this opposite side is open, and there would be room for a larger nucleophile than water, even though recent data suggest that short RNA molecules would not act as nucleophiles in LigT [22] . The central phosphate moiety sits nearly identically on top of the HxTx motifs, however. Combining both binding modes by superposition, interesting conservation can be observed (Fig 7A) . For example, LigT Trp82 is in a perfect position to stack against a base, and Arg120 is conserved. In the NADP + complex, we actually observe unidentified electron density of a stacking interaction, modeled as a fragment of NADP + , on top of Trp82, which could reflect low-affinity binding of some moiety in NADP + . These observations highlight several possible sites for interaction between phosphate, sugar, and base moieties in RNA with residues lining the active-site groove in LigT.",

The best-characterized 2H enzyme is mammalian myelin CNPase, for which a central role in the reaction mechanism is played by the N terminus of helix \u03b17 [17] . This helix is missing in most 2H family members, including LigT, and therefore, the reaction mechanisms must also be different across the enzyme family. The \u03b17 helix blocks access of larger nucleophiles than water into the CNPase active site, and it could be argued that its absence in LigT and most other 2H enzymes hints towards larger molecules, most likely RNA, as potential nucleophiles.",
