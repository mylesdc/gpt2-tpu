Most people use keywords based on what they remember from doctors, media reports and surrounding advertisements, which may or may not be accurate. At this stage, the keywords selected are general and broad, but they concentrate on several basic symptoms or potential treatments; these words are defined as General Keywords. When staff at hospitals and research institutes refer to the Internet for the causes and methods of treating HFMD using professional keywords, we define these types of keywords as Treatment Keywords. Finally, with respect to preventing HFMD, parents and schools tend to search online for information on how to prevent HFMD; these types of keywords are classified as Prevention Keywords.",

The correlation ranged from 0.62 to 0.83 (S3 Fig.) , which demonstrate that spatial bias does existed. However, it was puzzle that the whole nation's correlation is 0.846, which is higher than any of the regions. So it was not suitable to reduce the bias of GFT of the whole nation by simply using the data based on the scale of HHS regions. Cities with high correlations should be discovered in the further research to act as sample cities to solve this problem. It is also necessary for researchers to deeply analyze the hiding bias of GFT by mining the related keywords that form them both in space and time.",
