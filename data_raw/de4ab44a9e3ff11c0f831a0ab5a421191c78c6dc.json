Gallstone disease and its complications (cholecystitis, pancreatitis, and cholangitis) are the major causes of gastrointestinal morbidity that lead to hospital admission [5] . According to the National Hospital Discharge Survey, cholelithiasis led to 325,000 hospitalizations in the US in 2005 [6] . The estimated total number of cholecystectomies, including laparoscopic procedures, numbered as high as 770,000 in 1996, and was associated with an expense of more than 2 billion US dollars [7, 8] . In the UK, approximately 5.5 million people have gallstones and over 50,000 cholecystectomies are performed each year [5] .",

Clinically, the incidence of gallstone disease has been increasing in the past decade coincident with the rise in calorie and fat consumption, decrease in fiber intake, and increased prevalence of the sedentary lifestyle in the Asian population [15] .

To reduce the likelihood of misdiagnoses, we excluded anyone diagnosed as having primary or secondary liver cancer (155), cancer of the gallbladder and extrahepatic bile ducts (156), pancreatic cancer (157), gastric cancer (151), malignant neoplasm of other sites (140-150, 152-154, 158-199) , and hematological malignancy (200-208).

Among them, 170,781 were identified with incident hospital admissions. After excluding patients with primary and metastatic cancer of the liver, pancreas, and bile duct (n = 5377); malignant neoplasm of other sites (n = 7826); hematological malignancy (n = 441); human immunodeficient virus infection/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (n = 9); and unavailable or incorrect gender or age information in the database (n = 800), Table 2 summarizes the average rates of hospital admissions for severe gallstone disease, gallstone-related complications, and gallstone-related procedures for men and women in the overall population and each age group. Figure 1 shows trends in the age-standardized incidence rates of gallstone-related complications during 1997-2005. Women had relatively stable incidence of severe gallstone disease and acute cholecystitis, whereas men had significantly increased incidence of severe gallstone disease and all related complications (test for trend p < 0.001). Furthermore, the increase in the incidence of acute cholangitis was more marked for men (91%) than for women (32%; test for interaction p < 0.001). The increase in the incidence of biliary pancreatitis was similar for men and women (test for interaction p = 0.07). Figure 2 shows the trends in the incidence of severe gallstone disease and complications among different age groups (20-39, 40-59, 60-79, and \u226580). In the younger population (aged 20-39), increase in the incidences of all gallstone-related complications was significant (82% for acute cholecystitis, 70% for biliary pancreatitis, and 63% for acute cholangitis; test for trend p values < 0.001) ( Fig.  2A) . In the elderly population (aged \u226560), the incidence increase was small for acute cholecystitis but significant for acute cholangitis and biliary pancreatitis, especially among those aged \u226580 (p values < 0.001) (Fig. 2D) . The mean age of patients with gallstone complications after 60 years increased significantly during the study period from 71.6 to 73.5 year-old for men and 71.9 to 73.7 year-old for women (test for trend p values < 0.001). For the age group 40-59, the incidence of all gallstone-related complications remained stable during the study period (Fig.  2B ).

Kang and colleagues reported a steady increase in hospitalization rate for gallstone disease in England from 68.7 to 104.9 per 100,000 population between 1989/1990 and 1999/2000, although the proportion of patients receiving an operation fell significantly by 16.9% during the study period [21] . Urbach and Stukel examined the trends in incidence of gallstone disease and related complications that lead to hospitalization in Canada. They found the incidence rate of all severe gallstone diseases per 100,000 population decreased from 127. 8 in 1988-1991 to 114.2 in 1992-2000 [22] and attributed this decline to the widespread adoption of laparoscopic cholecystectomy leading to a reduction in the incidence of acute cholecystitis.",

It seems to be related in part to the increased accessibility of the patients to hospitals after changing the insurance system in the country although a modest increase in incidence of gallstone diseases in 10-year intervals might also play a role. Especially striking is the increase in the incidence of acute cholecystitis and hospital admission for elective cholecystectomy among those aged 20-39. This rise is mainly due to improved sonographic methods and thereby earlier diagnosis and may be due to a lowered threshold for laparoscopic surgery. Meanwhile, several studies have reported an association of obesity, decreasing intake of dietary fiber, higher intake of carbohydrate and fat, and less exercise with gallstone diseases, and the younger population might be particularly influenced by these factors [23-29].",

Epidemiological studies suggested that bile duct stones are more likely to cause biliary pancreatitis and acute cholangitis in East Asia than in the western countries [31, 32] . In the present study in Taiwan, the incidence of acute cholangitis was substantially higher than that in Canada, while the incidence of biliary pancreatitis was lower than that in Canada but close to that in Sweden. A systematic review of published articles about the epidemiology of acute pancreatitis in Europe found the incidence of acute biliary pancreatitis Age-standardized hospital admission rates of gallstone-related procedures for men and women from 1997 to 2005 . Several studies evaluating admissions for biliary surgery suggested that the proportion of patients with common bile duct stones decreased in Taiwan and Korea from 1980 to late 1990 [34-36]. Our study observed a significant increase in the incidence of biliary pancreatitis and acute cholangitis as well as in hospital admissions for ERCP especially among the elderly between 1997 and 2005. The finding that the mean age of the patients with complications after 60 years increased during the study period suggested this rise in incidence might be related to an increased segment of this elderly population. Although increased vigilance and improved diagnosis contributed substantially to this rise, other factors such as change in stone size or composition and preserved gallbladder motility due to delayed cholecystectomy might also have been contributors [37, 38] . Further studies are required to evaluate the factors associated with the rise in the incidences of biliary pancreatitis and cholangitis.",

The prevalence of gallstone disease among asymptomatic participants was 0.7-1.5% for those aged <40; 2.6% for those aged 40-49; 6-8% for those aged 50-59; 11.9% for those aged 60-69; as high as 10-16% for those aged \u226565 years. Our findings were consistent with prior study results suggesting that incidence of severe gallstone disease leading to hospitalization is highest in the elderly. In Taiwan where pigmented stones are more prevalent, no predominance of gallstone disease in females was seen, as is common in western countries [1, 30, 31] . Women, though, did have a higher rate of elective cholecystectomy, probably because they were more likely to develop symptoms attributable to gallbladder stones [39, 40] . The rate of acute cholecystitis was higher for men than women. However, this can not be entirely explained by the substantial lower rate of elective cholecystectomy rates in men versus women because the change in cholecystectomy rates were almost parallel in both genders during the period studied.",

However, it also had several limitations. First, in this study as in several large database studies conducted in the UK, US, and Canada, patients with severe gallstone disease were identified by ICD-9-CM codes. Consequently, we could not exclude the possibility of an increasing tendency to code biliary colic as acute cholecystitis among younger patients. However, it is less likely because the incidence of elective and nonelective cholecystectomy as well as admissions for ERCP tended to increase in this age group. Second, the proportion of patients with comorbidities was likely to be underestimated because these were probably under-reported in the discharge diagnoses. Third, the outcome of interest in this study was hospitalization for severe gallstone disease and related complications. Patients visiting the emergency department were not counted due to lack of data from ambulatory care records. And finally trends relating to gallstone location and composition could not be analyzed because this information was not available in the database.",
