            "text": "This in vitro study assessed the antimicrobial properties of a novel octasilver salt of Sucrose Octasulfate (IASOS) as well as of an innovative vaginal gel containing IASOS (SilSOS Femme), against bacterial and yeast pathogens isolated from human clinical cases of symptomatic vaginal infections. In BHI and LAPT culture media, different ionic silver concentrations and different pHs were tested. IASOS exerted a strong antimicrobial activity towards all the pathogens tested in both culture media. The results demonstrated that salts and organic compounds present in the culture media influenced IASOS efficacy only to a moderate extent. Whereas comparable MBCs (Minimal Bactericidal Concentrations) were observed for G. vaginalis (10 mg/L Ag + ), E. coli and E. aerogenes (25 mg/L Ag + ) in both media, higher MBCs were found for S. aureus and S. agalactiae in LAPT cultures (50 mg/L Ag + versus 25 mg/L Ag + ). No minimal concentration totally inhibiting the growth of C. albicans was found. Nevertheless, in both media at the highest ionic silver concentrations (50-200 mg/L Ag + ), a significant 34-52% drop in Candida growth was observed. pH differently affected the antimicrobial properties of IASOS against bacteria or yeasts; however, a stronger antimicrobial activity at pH higher than the physiological pH was generally observed. It can be therefore concluded that IASOS exerts a bactericidal action against all the tested bacteria and a clear fungistatic action against C. albicans. The antimicrobial activity of the whole vaginal gel SilSOS Femme further confirmed the antimicrobial activity of IASOS. Overall, our findings support IASOS as a valid active ingredient into a vaginal gel.",

An highly symptomatic inflammatory state, AV typically presents with a yellow, smelly vaginal discharge. BV and AV are generally accompanied with a vaginal pH increase above 4.5, beyond the healthy vaginal pH of 3.8-4.5 [5, 7] .",

We found that pH may indeed affect the antimicrobial activity of IASOS (Figure 1 and 2) . IASOS generally showed a stronger antimicrobial activity at pHs higher than the physiological pH 3.8-4.5, at final ionic silver concentrations higher than 10 mg/L. More evident in BHI medium for all the pathogens tested, this observation is clinically relevant since a vaginal pH.4.5 is an usual finding in patients affected by bacterial vaginosis and aerobic vaginitis, being also a diagnostic parameter [5, 40] .

            "text": "Differently from theoretical expectations, the influence of salts and organic matter in the culture media was of minor relevance. Organic matter and salts present in the culture media could interfere on the antimicrobial activity of silver ions because of their propensity to form complexes with silver ions, thereby reducing silver ions availability to exert the desired antimicrobial activity [41] . Instead, only slight differences were found in the antimicrobial activity of IASOS in relation to the two different media used. These differences were limited to a lower antimicrobial activity against S. aureus and S. agalactiae in LAPT, resulting in both cases in a higher MBC (50 mg/L silver ions in LAPT versus 25 mg/L in BHI), and a stronger antimicrobial activity against C. albicans in LAPT. Comparable MBCs were instead found in both media for G. vaginalis (10 mg/L ionic silver) and for E. coli and E. aerogenes (25 mg/L ionic silver). The different composition in salts and organic compounds of the two media, as well as a diverse susceptibility to silver ions of the different pathogenic species, might explain these results. In support to the present observations, a previous study [41] also found an equal MBC for E. coli (25 mg/ L ionic silver) and a higher MBC for S. aureus (200 mg/L ionic silver). Even if in that study chemically-produced silver nanoparticles were used as a source of silver ions and the determination of the MBCs were performed in different experimental conditions, the similarities of the results is relevant. In an another study, a surfactant-based, temperature-sensitive gel containing silver nanoparticles was tested; a MBC of 5 mg/L was found for S. aureus and MBCs of 10 mg/L were found for both E. coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa [42] . In this study G. vaginalis resulted the most sensitive to IASOS activity in both media and for all pH tested (MBC = 10 mg/L ionic silver). As far as we know no studies testing the susceptibility of G. vaginalis to silver ions are available in literature.",

Furthermore, it has been recently shown that silver can also exert its antifungal effects against Candida biofilms. Colloidal silver nanoparticles has been reported to affect matrix composition and structure of Candida biofilms in a doseindependent manner [44, 45] . Silver is believed to exert antimicrobial properties against fungi, viruses and protozoa according to a mechanism of action similar to its antibacterial effects. Through binding to biological molecules containing thiol, amino, carboxylate, imidazole and phosphate groups, ionic silver forms inhibit vital activities of microbial enzymes and proteins such as ATP production [46] and glucose oxidation [47] . Silver ions can make complexes with microbial DNA and RNA [24, 48] , and microbial membranes are damaged by silver-generated free radicals [49, 50, 51] . All these data indicate that silver, in proper conditions, can be an effective antifungal agent.",

This discrepancy has to be ascribed to the viscous nature of the gel formulation, slowing down the diffusion of silver ions from the matrix, thereby apparently decreasing the amount of silver available for microbial growth inhibition. To this end, it is worth noting that the silver-free gel formulations resulted inactive against all pathogens. This finding suggests that all the other SF ingredients but IASOS do not exert antimicrobial activity.",

The addition of the proper amount of silver ions to the silver-free gel formulations promptly recovered the antimicrobial activity, providing still evidence to the fact that IASOS-derived silver ions are responsible for the antimicrobial effects of SilSOS Femme. Nevertheless, SilSOS Femme displayed a stronger antimicrobial activity against S. aureus, G. vaginalis and C. albicans, well known to organize into biofilm colonies, making them resistant to several drug therapies [52] . This unexpected result could merit further assessment. The finding that different strains displayed differential sensitivity to IASOS alone or to SilSOS femme could suggest that other ingredients into the gel formulation, i.e. KSOS and HYA may synergize IASOS's antimicrobial activity through their antiadhesion properties [36] .",
