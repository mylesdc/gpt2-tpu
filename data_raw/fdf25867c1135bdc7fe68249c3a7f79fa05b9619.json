In the present study, we examined the roles of specific nuclear targeting domains in B1 localization as well as the effect of B1 nuclear localization on the cell cycle and host cell survival. The B1 protein of the Red spotted grouper nervous necrosis virus (RGNNV) was detected in GF-1 grouper cells as early as 24 hours post-infection (hpi). Using an EYFP-B1 fusion construct, we observed nuclear localization of the B1 protein (up to 99%) in GF-1 cells at 48 hpi. The nuclear localization of B1 was mediated by two arginine-rich nuclear targeting domains (B domain: 46 RRSRR 51 ; C domain: 63 RDKRPRR 70 ) and domain C was more important than domain B in this process. B1 nuclear localization correlated with upregulation of p53 and p21 (wef1/cip1) ; downregulation of Cyclin D1, CDK4 and Mdm2; and G1/S cell cycle arrest in GF-1 cells. In conclusion, nuclear targeting of the RGNNV B1 protein via two targeting domains causes cell cycle arrest by up-regulating p53/p21 and down-regulating Mdm2, thereby regulating host cell survival.",

RNA3, a sub-genomic RNA species at the 3\u2032 terminus of RNA1, comprises 2 ORFs that encode B1 (a 111 amino acid protein) and B2 (a 75 amino acid protein).

Betanodavirus-induced cell death also correlates with the induction of ER stress and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential in fish cells. RGNNV has recently been shown to induce the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) during the early and middle replication stages 22 . A number of viral proteins and cell signaling molecules have been shown to be involved in induction of host cell death and post-apoptotic necrosis during betanodavirus infection 7, 8, 23 . These data suggest that there may be crosstalk between the apoptosis and cell cycle pathways, which share a number of regulatory molecules 24 . We therefore hypothesized that betanodavirus infection may affect the cell cycle in a manner separate from induction of apoptosis.",

A degraded form of the protein is labeled by arrows in the figure. DAPI staining revealed that although the EYFP-B1 fusion protein was targeted to the nucleus ( Fig. 2b : e, f, g, h and n [enlarged image]), this targeting was not observed for EYFP alone ( Fig. 2b: a, b , c, d and m [enlarged image]). Loose nucleus targeting was observed for the EYFP-B1\u0394C fusion protein ( Fig. 2b : i, j, k, l and o [enlarged image]), which was distributed throughout the whole cell, including the cytoplasm and nucleus at 48 hpt. In the nucleus targeting test, in EYFP-B1\u0394C fusion protein also lost its targeting ability (Fig. 2b, o) , as compared with that of EYFP-B1 (Fig. 2b , n) and EYFP alone (Fig. 2b, m) . Quantitative analysis of the EYFP, EYFP-B1 and EYFP-\u0394B1 proteins targeting into cytoplasm or nucleus (Fig. 2c) showed that GF-1 cells transfected with pEYFP, pEYFP-B1 and pEYFP-B1\u0394C plasmids exhibited a significant targeting into the nucleus in EYFP-B1-transfected cells (up to 99%) at 48 hpt (*p < 0.01; **p < 0.05) compared with cells transfected with EYFP (100%) and EYFP-B1\u0394C plasmids (10%), which apparently lost targeting ability. The reasons for these observations are discussed below.",

Western blot experiments were used to compare the localization of the EYFP-B1 fusion protein (~40-kDa) with (1) domain A deletion (<40-kDa, designed as \u0394A), (2) domain B deletion (\u0394B), (3) domain C deletion (\u0394C), (4) domain D deletion (\u0394D), (5) domain A and D double deletion (\u0394AD) and (6) domain B and C double deletion (\u0394BC) (in Fig. 4b , lanes 3-9, respectively). Untransfected GF-1 cells and EYFP-transfected cells were used as negative controls (Fig. 4b, lanes 1-2, respectively) . These data, along with nuclear targeting analysis ( Fig. 5a ; Table 1 ) showed that deletion of domain C resulted in the biggest decrease in nuclear targeting (in \u0394C panel: panels e1-e4; indicated by arrows) and deletion of domain B resulted in a minor decrease in nuclear targeting (panels d1-d4; indicated by arrow). In contrast, deletion of domain A (panels c1-c4) and domain D (panels f1-f4) had no significant effect on nuclear targeting. Simultaneous deletion of two domains (B1\u0394BC; panels g1-g4 and B1\u0394AD; panels h1-h4) ( Table 1 ) also showed that domains B and C played an important role in the nuclear targeting of B1, whereas domains A and D were not involved in the nuclear targeting of B1.",

Cells transfected with pFlag and pFlag-B1 and selected for receiving the different producing cell line as term Flag-1 for negative control and Flag-B1-4 and Flag-B1-5 for B1-producing cell lines.

Representative cell cycle profiles and histograms of Flag-1, Flag-B1-4 and Flag-B1-5 cells are presented in Fig. 6a and b, respectively. There was also a significant increase in the percentage of cells arrested at the G0/G1/phase in the Flag-B1-4 and Flag-B1-5 samples compared with the Flag-1 sample (69.1% vs. 64.1% vs. 53.2%, respectively) (*p < 0.01).

To summary B1 protein can arrest cell cycle progression at G1/S phase. B1-induced G1/S cell cycle arrest was correlated with upregulation of p53 and p21 and downregulation of Cyclin D1, CDK 4 and Mdm2. The G1/S transition is regulated by a number of molecules including the cyclin-Cdk complexes, pRb, Mdm2 and CKIs such as p21 25 . We investigated the key molecules responsible for RGNNV B1-induced cell cycle arrest by examining the expression profiles of host G1/S transition proteins. GF-1 cells were transfected with Flag, Flag-B1 and Flag-B1\u0394C plasmids and then assayed for expression of these cellular proteins by western blotting at 24 hpt and 48 hpt.

            "text": "Role of B1 protein in cell cycle progression. Apoptosis and necrosis are two major mechanisms mediating cell death in nucleated eukaryotic cells 30, 31 . Betanodavirus infection has been shown to induce host cell death and post-apoptotic necrosis in fish cells 7, 8, 23 . Many viruses interfere with the host cell cycle and thereby achieve high replication efficiencies and virus yields 24 . Because viral protein expression and production of progeny virus is predominantly observed in the G1/S interface, cell cycle arrest at that point appears to be a common event observed in cells infected with different viruses of various strains and subtypes. We used flow cytometry analysis to show that the B1 protein induced G1/S cell cycle arrest in RGNNV-infected GF-1 cells and immunoblotting The role of the Rb-E2F pathway in cell cycle progression out of G0 through G1 and into the S-phase 32 makes it a suitable target for viruses 33, 34 . Maintenance of Rb proteins in an activated (hyper phosphorylated) state induces cell cycle arrest at the G0 or G1 phase or at the G1/S boundary, thus preventing host DNA replication during viral lytic infection 15, 35, 36 . Virus-induced modulation of the host cell cycle has also been shown to be beneficial during viral replication, transcription, translation and assembly [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] . Previous data have shown that cell cycle arrest induced by enveloped RNA viruses can favor viral assembly, because the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus disassemble into vesicles and larger membrane structures break into clusters or remnants during Our present study showed a B1-mediated upregulation in the expression of p21 and p53 in GF-1 cells at 48 hpt. Although the mechanism underlying this induction is unknown, it is likely to be mediated through ROS signals in GF-1 cells [48] [49] [50] . P21, which is regulated by p53, inhibits the formation of the Cyclin D-CDK4/6 complex, which is important for the G1/S transition and inhibits Mdm2 as a P53 inhibitor 51 . Interestingly, our data also showed a B1-mediated decrease in the expression levels of both Cyclin D1 and CDK4, thus suggesting that cell cycle arrest in RGNNV-infected GF-1 cells may be mediated via inhibition of B1-mediated direct inhibition of mRNA transcription or stability and/or translation of Cyclin D1 and CDK4. Our data suggested that B1-mediated inhibition of Cyclin D1/CDK4 complex formation, Mdm2, P53 inhibitor and G1/S cell cycle arrest occur via multiple pathways. Moreover, we found that betanodavirus infected the B1-producing GF-1 cells, thereby decreasing host cell viability by approximately 40% at 48 hpt compared with wild type GF-1 cells 8 .",

B1 was targeted to the nucleus at 48 hpi. Domain deletion experiments were used to identify the arginine-rich domain C, which was found to play a major role in the nuclear localization of B1. Nuclear targeting of the B1 protein was correlated with cell cycle progression, B1-mediated cell cycle arrest at the G1/S interphase and decreased cell volume at 48 hpt. B1 protein-induced cell cycle arrest was correlated with upregulated expression of p21 and p53 and downregulation expression of the Cyclin D1, CDK4 and Mdm2 proteins. Our findings may provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of RGNNV infection. Our findings provide new insights into RNA viral protein interactions with host proteins.",
