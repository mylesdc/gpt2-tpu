We examined the perceived negativity and positivity of these emotions in terms of their affective and cognitive components among Korean, Chinese, Canadian, and American students. Assessing each emotion at the cognitive and affective levels cross-culturally provides a fairly comprehensive picture of the positivity and negativity of emotions. Affective components were rated as more divergent than cognitive components. Crossculturally, Americans and Canadians gave higher valence ratings to the salient valence of each emotion, and lower ratings to the non-salient valence of an emotion, compared to Chinese and Koreans. The results suggest that emotions encompass both positivity and negativity, and there were cross-cultural differences in reported emotions. This paradigm complements existing emotion theories, building on past research and allowing for more parsimonious explanations of cross-cultural research on emotion.",

It is a construct important for art, literature, and everyday life, and is at the core of the human experience. Traditionally, emotions are categorized dichotomously, as negative or positive, unpleasant or pleasant, activated or deactivated, and so on (Plutchik, 1980; Russell, 1980) . Dichotomous classifications, however, are difficult to reconcile with certain developments in emotion research. In this paper, rather than classifying emotions on a single continuum from positive to negative, we argue that each emotion contains some degree of both negativity and positivity. Further, we employ a crosscultural paradigm in an effort to highlight the nuances of the positivity and negativity of emotion, as there are several important differences in the affective signature of emotions across cultures. If this conceptualization is supported, it would facilitate more parsimonious explanations of several findings related to emotion. We investigated the issue with six basic emotions (sadness, fear, disgust, anger, surprise, and happiness; Ekman, 1992) in a cross-cultural study, involving participants from four different countries (South Korea, China, Canada, and the US).",

Perhaps the first notable scientific endeavor on emotions was Darwin's (1872 Darwin's ( /1998 ). Darwin's (1872 Darwin's ( /1998 concept of emotion as expressive and as physiological states has strongly influenced subsequent investigations of emotion. Consequently, emotion researchers have emphasized physiological aspects of emotions, particularly facial expressions (Ekman, 1977 (Ekman, , 1999 ). Ekman's research suggests that there are universal emotions based on cross-cultural recognition of facial expressions. Although there are cultural differences in display rules for expressing emotion, six basic emotions (sadness, fear, disgust, anger, surprise, and happiness) have been identified as universal. This tenet is widely accepted among emotion researchers.",

Later, Schlosberg (1954) refined these three dimensions into pleasantness-unpleasantness, attention-rejection, and level of activation. Dimensional models of emotion are based on the assumption that all emotions involve the same interconnected system for emotion states. Still, the currently dominant models are the two-dimensional models: the circumplex model (Russell, 1980; Plutchik and Conte, 1997; Remington et al., 2000) , the vector model (Bradley et al., 1992) , and the Positive Activation -Negative Activation (PANA) model which contains two dimensions: positive to negative valence, and high to low activation (Watson and Tellegen, 1985) . In most (if not all) of these models, valence is one important dimension, along which a specific emotion is categorized as positive or negative. Indeed, the field of scientific studies on emotion has rested and evolved on the assumption that emotions are either positive or negative.",

Simultaneous emotions have also been reported in response to winning in disappointing fashion (e.g., a victory that could have been better) and losing in a relieving fashion (e.g., a defeat that could have been worse; Larsen et al., 2004) . Thus, despite the traditional emotion framework that conceptualizes emotions dichotomously -as being either positive or negative, the literature suggests that a more flexible approach is needed. This might be why emotion researchers have long argued that the same emotion can serve different functions (Ekman, 1984; Scherer, 1984; Frijda and Mesquita, 1994) . Indeed, researchers have found both positive and negative effects of a positive mood, and of a negative mood (Clore et al., 1994) . Bagozzi et al. (1999) investigated the valence of emotion cross-culturally, and found that Easterners tended to report more concurrently reported positive and negative emotions than Westerners. Further, Miyamoto et al. (2010) investigated the co-occurrence of positive and negative emotions in both Japan and the United States. Japanese participants reported feeling more mixed emotions than Americans in predominantly positive situations, but not in predominantly negative situations, in which there were no differences.",

Individualistic cultures believe that self-reflective emotions (emotions that reflect on the individual's own actions) concerning a person doing well are good, whereas collectivistic cultures believe that self-reflective emotions concerning that one's actions need improvement are desirable. For example, those from individualistic cultures tend to consider pride as a desirable emotion, and those from collectivist cultures tend to consider guilt a desirable emotion (Eid and Diener, 2001) . This is in line with cultural differences in regulatory focus. Overall, Eid and Diener's (2001) results further support that not all positive emotions are interpreted positively by all people, nor are all negative emotions interpreted negatively. Indeed, Tsai et al. (2006) and Tsai (2007) have shown that ideal affect -the affective state that people desire feeling -varies across cultures: Americans value high-arousal positive affective states (such as excitement) more, whereas East Asians value low-arousal positive affective states (such as calm or peacefulness) more. Further insight to these differences can be found in the literature concerning the components of emotion.",

The affective component is related to our immediate response to stimuli (feelings), while the cognitive component is our more controlled, conscious evaluation after the immediate response (thinking). The Component Process Model (CPM), which is based on appraisal theory, suggests that emotion is composed of different stages: automatic sensory motor, schematic unconscious, and controlled conscious stages (Scherer, 1982 (Scherer, , 1984 Van Reekum and Scherer, 1997) . According to the CPM, the affective process is more immediate and provides a strong subjective sense of feeling that is prominent to oneself. The affective process is automatic, less controlled, and tends to be strongly aligned with the valence of the emotion); on the other hand, the cognitive process is rather controlled, occurring later in the realization of emotion sequence. The cognitive components of emotions are therefore considered less intense and less extreme compared to the affective components (Scherer, 1982 (Scherer, , 1984 Tice et al., 2004; Ochsner and Gross, 2005) . Indeed, research has shown that affective and cognitive components of emotions do not necessarily corroborate each other. For example, Tamir and Bigman (2014) explain that emotions can be pursued both for how they feel and what they accomplish, and highlight the complexities among the different emotional motives. For example, a boxer may desire to feel anger, a negative emotion, in order to motivate himself to beat his opponent. So although he may be feeling a negative emotion (affective component), he thinks about it in a positive light (cognitive component).",

They are called meta-moods because they do not concern the immediate experience of feeling states, but concern their reflective experience, involving subjective thoughts and feelings about one's moods. The regulatory process of the reflective experience is under the individual's control. The duality described above may explain why some cultures focus on hedonic pleasures (e.g., Western cultures) while others focus on peace and harmony (e.g., Eastern cultures). Indeed, East Asians reported that happiness is experienced as rather calm and zenlike, whereas Westerners reported that happiness is experienced as excitement and extreme positivity (Tsai, 2007) . This may explain why Westerners desire to feel positive emotions more than negative emotions relative to Easterners (Sims et al., 2015) . All of the above suggests that subjective interpretation of specific emotions (i.e., primarily the cognitive component of emotion) differs across cultures (Uchida et al., 2004) . Most recently, an argument based on Higher Order Theory (HOT) was put forth that emotions are cognitive (LeDoux and Brown, 2017) . Based on the literature review on neuroimaging evidence, they have concluded that emotion is a cognitive process, as it involves cortical (conscious) rather than subcortical (unconscious) brain circuits. This suggests that emotion could be a higher order process, separate from the affect we feel.",

Indeed, emotions are the result of human cognition (Lazarus, 1982) , and cognitive processes in turn are influenced by emotion (Forgas, 1995) . Research has shown that culture influences cognitive processes . Ji et al. (2001) found that Westerners tend to have a linear thinking style, resulting in expectations of unchanging or consistent outcomes. Easterners, by contrast, have a more dialectical thinking style, resulting in expectations of more malleable or changing outcomes (see also . East Asians' greater dialectical thinking, or the degree to which contradictions are tolerated, is thought to drive the more predominant emotional complexity (i.e., concurrence of positive and negative emotion) of East-Asians relative to Westerners (Spencer-Rodgers et al., 2010) . Because dialectical thinking involves a greater expectation of change, it is likely that any thought about emotion will be less extreme. This is because if something is expected to change or fluctuate, it would not be taken in the extreme view. Linear thinkers, on the other hand, expect stability, so their thoughts might be grounded more in the extremes (less likely to change because they are so strong). One difference between dialectical and linear thinking styles lies in how people from different cultures view events. Easterners tend to take a more balanced view of negative events compared to Westerners (Ji et al., 2004) . Indeed, findings suggest that people from dialectical and collectivist cultures (Chinese, Koreans, Japanese, Indonesians, and Malaysians) make less polarized life quality judgments, whether negative or positive, compared to non-dialectical thinkers and individualist cultures (e.g., Americans; Minkov, 2009 ).",

Miyamoto and Ma (2011) , in a series of studies, showed that, although people in general want to savor rather than dampen their positive emotions, such hedonic emotion regulation was weaker among Asians than among Americans. Furthermore, dialectical beliefs about positive emotions mediated such cultural differences. As a whole, these findings indicate that culturally specific dialectical beliefs guide both emotion regulation and emotional experience. In fact, people from interdependent cultures tend to report experiencing positive and negative emotions simultaneously (Spencer-Rodgers et al., 2010) . This suggests that dialecticism results in emotional complexity.",

Cross-culturally, Miyamoto et al. (2014) found that Asians were less likely than Euro-Americans to engage in hedonic emotion regulation after experiencing a negative event or feeling a negative emotion, mediated by stronger dialectical beliefs among Asians than among Euro-Americans.

For example, sadness, which is salient in negativity, should be rated more negatively on the affective than the cognitive component, and relatively less positively on the affective than cognitive component (H2). Finally, based on the review of the culture and emotion literature, we hypothesized that American and Canadian ratings would be higher for the salient valence (e.g., negativity for sadness) and lower for the less salient valence (e.g., positivity for sadness) of an emotion, compared to Chinese and Koreans (H3).",

As a small peninsula country, Koreans have faced (and are still facing) threats to their existence, but despite that, may think they should live their lives as they normally would. China, on the other hand, is the largest country on the continent of Asia, and their ecological and political situation is not threatened by outside factors, which may affect how cultural fear was shaped for Chinese individuals.",

This suggests that perhaps culture affects how people face and deal with disgust. Americans reported the strongest negativity of disgust, perhaps due to its extreme negativity in American culture. However, for the positivity of disgust, Easterners (Koreans and Chinese) reported stronger positivity of disgust compared to Westerners (Canadians and Americans). This may be due to Easterners' dialectical thinking style, in that they find both the feeling and thinking of disgust to have benefits for them. Regarding anger, Easterners (Koreans and Chinese) reported stronger positivity of anger compared to Westerners, especially on the cognitive component. In most countries, anger is viewed as rather negative, but to Koreans (and to some extent, Chinese), anger has a more positive impact. This is consistent with Park et al. (2013) finding that, unlike in the U.S. where Americans with lower social status expressed more anger -likely due to frustration, in Japan, it was those with higher social status that expressed more anger, presumably to display authority. Thus, anger and its expression may have a more positive connotation in East Asian cultures. On the affective component, Americans reported lower negativity than Canadians (and East Asians, to some extent), which was unexpected. It is unclear to what extent this result was due to the fact that the majority of the US sample was Hispanic, whereas the Canadian sample consisted of only Caucasians. Although a within-US comparison revealed no significant differences, the test may have been underpowered. Future research should further investigate this possibility.",

Not only is happiness considered to evoke less arousal in Easterners compared to Westerners, but happiness also contains possibly more negativity for Easterners (Kubota, 2012) . This suggests that happiness may be experienced differently across cultures. To Westerners, perhaps happiness is an emotion that is bright like a clear sunny day, whereas to Easterners, happiness is still positive, but balanced with negativity, like a drizzling sunny day with a rainbow. In other words, how we treat happiness and deal with such an emotion perhaps requires a different attitude for different cultures.",

This is remarkable, considering that although each basic emotion is universally recognized, they are still experienced differently across several cultures. Further, our findings suggest that the degrees of quality of emotions, such as negativity and positivity, and the affective and cognitive constructs of emotion differ across cultures. An implication of this study is that the cognitive processes that arise from culture affect how people feel. This may stem from differences in thinking styles, such as dialectical and linear thinking (Peng and Nisbett, 1999; Ji et al., 2001; Nisbett, 2003) . Specifically, Easterners tend to be dialectical when thinking about a situation in a manner that balances the positives and negatives. When things are going well, Easterners might expect a change for the worse, and when things are going badly, they might expect things to get better. This may prepare Easterners for unexpected situations. However, Westerners tend to focus more on one pattern-things will tend to stay as they are, good or bad. This thinking style may lead Westerners to think that things are rather consistent, leading them to concentrate on one side of an issue.",

The results of the current study supported our hypotheses. The findings revealed that there are rather consistent patterns across Eastern and Western cultures, although differences also exist across cultures, and sometimes even within cultures. This framework is novel, yet compliments existing theory and research. Also, the current paper is the first to examine cultural differences systematically across basic emotions. We hope that this research enhances our understanding of emotion across cultures, as well as provides a new framework with which to examine emotion more generally.",

Thus, H2 was fully supported in the Korean and Chinese samples, and partially supported in the Canadian sample. Due to the significant 3-way interaction, we examined H3 within affective and cognitive components separately. Within the affective component, the simple effect analyses revealed that Canadians (M Canada & affective & negativity = 4.87, se = 0.11) rated affective negativity the strongest, followed by Chinese (M China & affective & negativity = 4.75, se = 0.12), Koreans (M Korea & affective & negativity = 4.64, se = 0.10), and Americans (M US & affective & negativity = 4.43, se = 0.11); only the difference between Americans and Canadians was significant, F = 2.83, p = 0.031. There were no significant differences among the four countries on affective positivity for anger (M Canada & affective & positivity = 0.98, se = 0.11, M China & affective & positivity = 1.12, se = 0.12, M US & affective & positivity = 1.20, se = 0.11, M Korea & affective & positivity = 1.34, se = 0.09), F = 2.23, p > 0.071. Within the cognitive component, simple effect analyses revealed that Canadians (M Canada & cognitive & negativity = 4.74, se = 0.12) and Americans (M US & cognitive & negativity = 4.50, se = 0.11) rated anger more negatively than did Koreans (M Korea & cognitive & negativity = 4.11, se = 0.10), Fs > 5.97, p < 0.001 and p = 0.057, respectively. Canadians and Americans also rated anger more negatively than did Chinese (M China & cognitive & negativity = 4.38, se = 0.13), although these differences did not reach statistical significance; ps > 0.221. For cognitive positivity, Canadians (M Canada & cognitive & positivity = 1.36, se = 0.12) rated anger least positively, followed by Americans (M US & cognitive & positivity = 1.47, se = 0.12), Chinese (M China & cognitive & positivity = 1.63, se = 0.14), and Koreans (M Korea & cognitive & positivity = 2.07, se = 0.11), omnibus F = 7.71, p < 0.001, however, Chinese were not significantly different from Koreans, Canadians or Americans; p > 0.073. Thus, H3 was partially supported in the cognitive component when evaluating anger. Happiness A mixed ANOVA revealed a marginally significant interaction between valence and component, F(1,454) = 2.79, p = 0.096, \u03b7 2 p = 0.01, which was not qualified by a 3-way interaction, F(3,454) = 1.80, p = 0.147. Consistent with H2, happiness was rated more negatively on the cognitive component (M cognitive & negativity = 0.54, se = 0.04) than the affective component (M affective & negativity = 0.65, se = 0.04), t = \u22122.37, p = 0.018. However, happiness was rated equally positively on the affective component (M affective & positivity = 5.47, se = 0.04) and the cognitive component (M cognitive & positivity = 5.46, se = 0.04) Thus, H2 was partially supported. se = 0.07) rated happiness to be more positive than Chinese (M China & positivity = 5.31, se = 0.08) and Koreans (M Korea & positivity = 5.20, se = 0.06), Fs > 12.11, ps < 0.022, whereas Koreans (M Korea & negativity = 0.86, se = 0.06) and Chinese (M China & negativity = 0.73, se = 0.08) rated happiness to be more negative than Americans (M US & negativity = 0.42, se = 0.07) and Canadians (M Canada & negativity = 0.36, se = 0.07), Fs > 14.51, ps < 0.019. Thus, H3 was fully supported. Surprise The interaction between valence and component, F(3,454) = 0.15, p = 0.703, was not significant, neither was the three-way interaction, F(3,454) = 0.82, p = 0.486. We went ahead to test our priori hypothesis. Simple effect analyses revealed that surprise was rated more positively on the cognitive component (M cognitive & positivity = 3.67, se = 0.05) than on the affective component (M affective & positivity = 3.55, se = 0.05), t = \u22122.80, p = 0.005; however, surprise was also rated more negatively on the cognitive (M cognitive & negativity = 2.26, se = 0.06) than affective (M affective & negativity = 2.18, se = 0.06) component, t = \u22121.85, p = 0.066.
