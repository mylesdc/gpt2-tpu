Single sequence methods for RNA secondary structure prediction are limited by the accuracy of the underlying folding model, if a structure is supported by a family of evolutionarily related sequences, one can be more confident that the prediction is accurate. RNA pseudoknots are functional elements, which have highly conserved structures. However, few comparative structure prediction methods can handle pseudoknots due to the computational complexity.",

As RNA structure formation is of hierarchical nature, secondary structure is the basis for the tertiary fold that produces the functional structure. Especially for RNAs, structure determination by experimental means is an intricate and expensive task. Computational RNA structure prediction is therefore an invaluable tool for biologists. Comparative structure prediction is considered the most reliable approach for computational RNA structure prediction. Single sequence structure prediction is always limited by the accuracy of the underlying folding model. Three main streams have been identified for comparative RNA secondary structure prediction: (i) predict a structure from a pre-computed sequence alignment; (ii) simultaneously compute an alignment and a structure and (iii) alignment-free methods (Gardner and Giegerich, 2004) .",

Such methods heavily depend on the sequence conservation and quality of the underlying alignment. However, ncRNAs are conserved rather on the structure level than on the sequence level. The gold standard of RNA comparative structure prediction is the Sankoff approach as it does not rely on a high-quality sequence alignment and captures the structural conservation of ncRNAs. Sankoff (1985) introduced a theoretical dynamic programming algorithm for simultaneous folding and aligning for a set of N sequences that takes O(n 3N ) time and O(n 2N ) space. Practical variants have been derived which more or less retain the Sankoff principle by sacrificing optimality. Alignment-free methods aim to avoid the pragmatic restrictions made in a practical Sankoff approach as well as the reliance on a high-quality alignment [e.g. CARNAC (Perriquet et al., 2003) ]. Note that all of these comparative structure prediction methods exclude the prediction of RNA pseudoknots.",

In fact, the majority of comparative RNA structure prediction methods exclude pseudoknots. Biologists have delivered a wealth of studies, which show that pseudoknots have an astonishing number of diverse functions and occur in most classes of RNA (Staple and Butcher, 2005) .

Similar to the case of ungapped local sequence alignments (Karlin and Altschul, 1990) , it is assumed here that the base pair similarity scores follow an extreme value distribution. However, the main difference is that a comparison between fixed-length stem fragments is made. It is important to remember that parameters and K describe the extreme value distribution of optimal local alignment scores in the asymptotic limit of long sequences (Altschul et al., 2001) . Here, the parameters for the generalized extreme value distribution are pre-calculated using maximum Fig. 1 . For two unaligned RNA sequences Seq x and Seq y , DotKnot-PW produces structure element dictionaries derived from the probability dot plot. Similarity scores and P-values are computed to detect conserved elements likelihood fitting of a distribution to the histogram of a large sample of random base pair similarity scores. The maximum likelihood fitting was performed using the ismev package of the R statistical language for a range of stem lengths (see Supplementary Material). The P-value is defined as the probability to obtain a score greater than or equal to the observed score strictly by chance. A stem s i (x) in sequence Seq x and a stem s j (x) in sequence Seq y are a significant pair if the score sim[s i (x), s j (y)] has an estimated P-value less than . Stem pairs with a P-value larger than are not considered in the following.",

This may be the set of free energy parameters used by free energy minimization methods or the underlying methodological framework such as maximum expected accuracy methods. DotKnot-PW shows excellent results on H-type pseudoknots with short interhelix loops. For this type of pseudoknots, DotKnot-PW uses free energy pseudoknot parameters by Chen (2006, 2009 ) based on polymer statistical mechanics. Improvements of the accuracy of free energy parameters, both for secondary structures and pseudoknots, will lead to more accurate prediction methods. However, one has to keep in mind that the algorithms themselves must be designed in such a fashion that novel parameters can be efficiently incorporated. The heuristic framework of DotKnot-PW has been designed such that it can incorporate sophisticated free energy parameters for pseudoknots, secondary structures and coaxial stacking. In the future, DotKnot-PW could also use contributions from basic tertiary structure elements such as base triples around the pseudoknot junction or stem-loop interactions.",

This approach called DotKnot-PW is designed as an algorithm for finding the structure including H-type pseudoknots common to two sequences. As shown in Table 1 , DotKnot-PW can greatly improve structure predictions for RNA families when compared with the single sequence prediction using DotKnot. In some cases, a comparative approach might have lower sensitivity than a single sequence prediction; however, this should not generally be judged as 'inferior'. For example, ncRNAs might preserve some integral base pairs throughout evolution and only these will be detected by a comparative approach, which returns the set of base pairs common to a set of evolutionarily related sequences. DotKnot-PW uses a set of unaligned sequences as the input; therefore, no expert user intervention is required. In the future, DotKnot-PW will be extended to include intramolecular kissing hairpins. Furthermore, constrained folding will be implemented to predict a structure subject to constraints, e.g. enforce certain base pairs or regions, which must remain unpaired.",
