However, its mechanism of evolution and contribution to the epidemic spread of S. suis 2 remain unknown. In this study, the potential for mobilization of 89K was evaluated, and its putative transfer mechanism was investigated. We report that 89K can spontaneously excise to form an extrachromosomal circular product. The precise excision is mediated by an 89K-borne integrase through site-specific recombination, with help from an excisionase. The 89K excision intermediate acts as a substrate for lateral transfer to non-89K S. suis 2 recipients, where it reintegrates sitespecifically into the target site. The conjugal transfer of 89K occurred via a GI type IV secretion system (T4SS) encoded in 89K, at a frequency of 10 -6 transconjugants per donor. This is the first demonstration of horizontal transfer of a Gram-positive PAI mediated by a GI-type T4SS. We propose that these genetic events are important in the emergence, pathogenesis and persistence of epidemic S. suis 2 strains.",

Further, S. suis 2 can also be transmitted to humans by direct contact with infected swine, causing meningitis, permanent hearing loss, septic shock and even death (Gottschalk et al., 2007) . Due to its high incidence, transmissibility, persistence in the environment and its ability to occur in explosive epidemic form, S. suis 2 continues to be a global public health concern. After two extensive human outbreaks of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS) caused by S. suis 2 in China in 1998 (Tang et al., 2006 , S. suis 2 has been recognized as a re-emerging zoonotic pathogen and was found to characteristically harbour a candidate pathogenicity island (PAI) designated 89K (Chen et al., 2007) . Recent genetic evidence showing that a two-component system (SalK/R) encoded within this island mediates a piglet-lethal phenotype has strengthened the case that 89K is a PAI (Li et al., 2008) .",

These architectural features strongly suggest that it may have been acquired by horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Meanwhile, the internal modular organization of 89K indicates that it was generated by multiple recombination events because it carries several unrelated gene blocks found in widely divergent species, making it difficult to ascertain its initial origin. A better understanding of the molecular biology of 89K will undoubtedly provide important insight into the emergence, virulence, and evolution of this important pathogen. Indeed, it may reveal some clues concerning the molecular pathogenesis of STSS caused by S. suis 2.",

Based on the organization of genetic determinants, shared homologies and evolutionary relationships, T4SSs can be classified into three major types: (i) type IVA systems resemble the archetypal VirB/ VirD4 system of Agrobacterium tumefaciens and are considered to be the paradigm of T4SS; (ii) type IVB systems resemble the Dot/Icm system found in Legionella pneumophila and Coxiella burnetii; and (iii) other T4SSs bear little or no homology to Type IVA or IVB systems, and their functions await further investigation. Representative of the third group are the recently described genomic island (GI)-type T4SSs that are found in a broad spectrum of Gram-negative pathogens (Juhas et al., 2008) . Ultimately, it is the identification of the GI-type T4SSs that brings insight into the mechanisms by which GIs transfer between bacteria (Juhas et al., 2009) .",

We provide genetic evidence showing that an 89K-borne integrase mediates sitespecific excision and circularization of 89K, with contribution from an auxiliary protein named excisionase. The 89K extrachromosomal circular excision product is selftransmissible and can conjugally transfer via a plasmidlike process into S. suis recipient cells through the 89Kencoded GI-type T4SS transport conduit. Thus far, while mobilization of genetic elements by T4SSs has been well studied in Gram-negative bacteria, the transfer of Grampositive mobile genetic elements by T4SSs is currently limited to conjugative plasmids and transposons. Without a previous comprehensive study, we present the first demonstration of the horizontal transfer of a PAI mediated by a GI-type T4SS in a Gram-positive bacterium. We suggest that this new mobile element is responsible, at least in part, for the recent STSS outbreaks in China and recent sporadic cases in neighbouring countries and areas including Vietnam and Thailand (Holden et al., 2009) , and it will possibly spread further in the future.",

To determine whether the 89K PAI is transmissible from a donor S. suis strain containing 89K to a recipient strain without this element, we performed conjugative mating experiments. To obtain a marked version of 89K, a 3\u2032 single cross-over mutant of strain 05ZYH33 constructed in our previous work was used as the donor, which was tagged with a spectinomycin marker located downstream of the SalK/R two-component system within 89K (Li et al., 2008) . We designated this derivative 05ZYH33-89KSpc and the modified 89K island as 89K*. SS2-N, a virulent strain of S. suis 2 that does not naturally contain 89K, was engineered to be chloramphenicol-resistant by replacing the recA gene with a cat gene cassette (creating SS2-NDrecA) and used as the recipient. Medium containing both chloramphenicol and spectinomycin was used to select exconjugants that received 89K*. In the filter mating assay, double antibioticresistant transconjugants were obtained, and transfer of 89K* was detected at a mean frequency of 5.4 \u00a5 10 -6 per donor (Table 1) . Using specific primers, the integrated 89K* was detected in 10 randomly selected transconjugants, providing further evidence that 89K* was transferred into the recipients. Transfer of 89K* was also observed at a similar frequency by using other S. suis 2 strains as recipients, including the virulent S735 strain and the avirulent (DNase I) SS2-NDrecA 4.9 \u00a5 10 -6 05ZYH33-89KSpc (supernatant) SS2-NDrecA < 10 -8 05ZYH33-89KSpc S735::cat 6.0 \u00a5 10 -6 05ZYH33-89KSpc 7996::cat 2.5 \u00a5 10 -6 05ZYH33DmobA89K SS2-NDrecA < 10 -8 CDmobA89K SS2-NDrecA 9.6 \u00a5 10 -5 05ZYH33DmobC89K SS2-NDrecA",

A total of 80 open reading frames (ORFs) were annotated in the 89K island, most of them (n = 65) on the minus strand. The overall gene organization in 89K is presented in Fig. 1 . Notably, 89K contains a Tn916 element, which is likely associated with the tetracycline resistance phenotype because the S. suis 2 reference P1/7 strain without 89K is sensitive to tetracycline. Furthermore, 89K carries a large lantibiotic biosynthesis cluster, which was suggested to be incapable of producing a functional lantibiotic (due to mutation) but essential for full virulence (Phelps and Neely, 2007; Holden et al., 2009 ).",

It is well documented that integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs) are able to excise from the chromosomes to form circular intermediates prior to conjugative transfer into recipient cells (Burrus et al., 2002) . We confirmed that 89K did excise from the 05ZYH33 chromosome to produce a circular form and the host genome was repaired upon excision because PCR products were obtained for both primer pairs P2/P3 and P1/P4 (Fig. 2B) . Subsequent sequence analysis confirmed the expected structures of attP and attB generated upon site-specific excision ( Fig. 2C and D) . Noticeably, the amplicons obtained with primer pairs P2/P3 and P1/P4 showed a substantially weaker signal compared to that with P1/P2 and P3/P4, indicating that 89K excision is a rare event. To measure the rate of 89K excision, we developed a real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay and determined that the frequency of 89K excision from an 05ZYH33 overnight culture was 0.032%, a rate similar to that observed for SLG excision from the Streptomyces lividans 66 chromosome (He et al., 2007) . These data demonstrated that 89K can spontaneously excise from the chromosome and form a circular A. Aberrant average G+C content of 89K, which is much less than that of the chromosome. B.

The 89K int gene, located near the left end of the island (attL) at a distance of 63 bp, encodes a 403-amino-acid (aa) integrase belonging to the tyrosine recombinase family, which catalyses site-specific recombination between a chromosomal site (attB) and a similar or identical sequence (attP) found on mobile genetic elements including bacteriophages, insertion sequences and transposons (Esposito and Scocca, 1997; Nunes-Duby et al., 1998) . Functional studies of related members of this family give good reason to assume that 89K excision is mediated by the 89K-borne integrase. To determine if this is the case, we generated an isogenic int knockout mutant of strain 05ZYH33 (creating 05ZYH33Dint) and examined 89K excision in this mutant. PCR products were generated using primer pairs P1/P5 (primer P5 is located upstream of xis, as the int deletion removes the priming site for P2) and P3/P4. However, negative results were obtained with primer pairs P3/P5 and P1/P4 (Fig. 3B ). qPCR analysis of the Dint mutant also demonstrated that 89K excision was eliminated, with attP not being detected. Trans-complementation of int restored the excision capacity of 89K to a level comparable to that of the parental strain, with attP being present in~0.025% of cells. These results suggest that deletion of int in strain 05ZYH33 abolished the ability of 89K to excise from the host chromosome. Thus, Int is essential for 89K excision and circularization by mediating site-specific recombination between the attL and attR sites.",

In our analysis, a small ORF (05SSU0904), located immediately upstream of the int gene and separated by a 14 bp intergenic region, was found to encode a possible Xis homologue with 32% aa identity to a putative excisionase (accession number AAL27447.1) from Enterococcus faecalis (Fig. 3A) . The predicted xis is preceded by a putative ribosome binding site (AGGAG), which is located 8 bp upstream from the initiation codon of xis. Further sequence analysis revealed a palindrome of 27 bp with the potential to form a stem-loop structure situated 85 bp downstream from the stop codon of int, which may function as a transcriptional terminator.

Conjugation can proceed only after the formation of a protein-DNA complex (relaxosome) at the oriT site, which is often located in the intergenic region upstream of its cognate relaxase gene (Francia et al., 2004) . The oriT of the 89K PAI was predicted to be a sequence of~40 nt positioned within the 05SSU0915 coding sequence, which is predicted to encode a polypeptide of unknown function with 62% aa identity to a hypothetical protein (SMSK597-1197, accession number ZP_07642092.1) of S. mitis SK597. This segment contains a perfect 9 nt inverted repeat sequence (predicted by the DNA Strider program) that may be necessary to form a stable nucleoprotein complex during conjugation (Bhattacharjee and Meyer, 1993 ). The precise nic (nickase cleavage) site was predicted to reside at position 3\u2032-(887140)CTCG/ CAAA(887147) on the negative strand, which is located 8 nt downstream of the inverted repeats within the oriT region based on an extensive sequence alignment with other oriT sites that have been experimentally determined previously. Figure 4 shows the overall gene organization of the DNA processing region of 89K. We noticed that MobA89K has an N-terminal relaxase domain but lacks a T4SS-mediated transfer of 89K PAI in S. suis 2 1675 C-terminal helicase domain, which usually possesses a processive 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 unwinding activity that provides the motive force for strand transfer (Llosa et al., 1996; Matson et al., 2001) . Instead, we found that ORF 05SSU0934 within 89K encodes a match to the DNA helicase (accession number ACF56805.1) of S. pneumoniae G54, with 93% aa identity. In vivo mutational analysis demonstrated that this gene (designated hlc, helicase) is not required for 89K excision and circularization (Fig. 3B ) but is essential for 89K transfer (Table 1) .",

Sequence analysis revealed that 89K is not similar to an integrated prophage, suggesting that the excised circular 89K may undergo lateral transfer. Confirmation of this hypothesis was obtained by the observation that transfer of a Spc R -marked 89K occurred at a frequency of approximately 10 -6 per donor, similar to that of the Pseudomonas clc element (Sentchilo et al., 2003) and the Salmonella SGI1 island (Doublet et al., 2005) . Further, 89K transfer absolutely requires the 89K-borne integrase, while a Dxis derivative can still transfer at a low but measurable frequency. This suggests that 89K excision is required for its transfer, and Xis may exert its effect by reducing the number of copies of excised circularized 89K molecules. Notably, Gilmore and co-workers demonstrated that transfer of the enterococcal PAI did not require the PAI-resident integrase, excisionase or putative conjugation genes. Instead, transfer only occurred from donors possessing a pheromone responsive-type of conjugative plasmid via an Hfr-like and RecA-dependent mechanism (Manson et al., 2010) .",

Throughout the past half century, investigations of T4SSs have largely focused on defining the mechanisms of action of several model systems of Gramnegative bacteria, such as the F (IncF), R388 (IncW), RP4 (IncP) and pKM101 (IncN) plasmid conjugation systems and the A. tumefaciens VirB/VirD4 system. However, little is known about the architectures or mechanisms of T4SSs in Gram-positives (Alvarez-Martinez and Christie, 2009) . Although T4SS-mediated mobilization of genetic elements has been characterized in some species of Gram-positive bacteria, such elements are currently limited to conjugative plasmids (e.g. E. faecalis pCF10, S. agalactiae pIP501 and C. perfringens pCW3) and transposons (e.g. E. faecalis Tn916, B. subtilis ICEBs1 and S. agalactiae TnGBS2). Indeed, transfer of Gram-positive GIs (especially PAIs) by T4SSs has not yet been reported. Our findings expand the repertoire of Gram-positive ICEs that can be mobilized by T4SS, and this is the first characterization of horizontal transfer of a Gram-positive PAI by a GI-type T4SS. In contrast, GI-type T4SSs have been identified in various Gram-negative GIs such as pKLC102, PAPI-1, SPI-7 and the Pseudomonas clc element, as well as others derived from a wide variety of Gram-negative plant and animal pathogens, including Erwinia carotovora (Chen et al., 2008) , Xylella fastidiosa (Zaini et al., 2008) , Photorhabdus luminescens (Held et al., 2007) and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis (Collyn et al., 2006) . The complete set of 24 genes thought to encode the putative GI-type T4SS in H. influenzae ICEHin1056 has been fully or largely identified in the GIs of the above-mentioned Gram-negative pathogens, suggesting that GI-type T4SSs are highly conserved among these species (Juhas et al., 2008) . Comparative genomic and functional analysis suggested that 89K encodes a GI-type T4SS at its 5\u2032 terminus (05SSU0961-05SSU0982), differing in gene content and organization with the Gramnegative counterparts (Fig. S2 ). This indicates that there may be an evolutionary divergence of GI-type T4SSs between Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, perhaps due to the differences in cell wall structure.",

In a small proportion of host bacteria, the 89K-borne integrase mediates precise excision of 89K from the chromosome with the help of an excisionase. Upon detection of a mating signal, the transfer of the excised circular intermediate of 89K begins (Llosa et al., 2002) . In the first step, MobA89K initiates the processing reaction by generating a strandand site-specific nick at the oriT site of 89K, with help from the auxiliary MobC89K protein. Next, the 05SSU0934 DNA helicase unwinds the nicked strand during relaxosome formation, and the VirD4-89K coupling protein then links the relaxosome and leads it directly to the mating channel (Llosa et al., 2003) . The VirB1-89K lytic transglycosylase, for which peptidoglycan cleavage activity has been previously demonstrated in A. tumefaciens (Zupan et al., 2007) , should play a crucial role in local opening of the peptidoglycan during the assembly of the transenvelope transporter The 89K-borne integrase mediates precise excision of 89K from the chromosome with the aid of excisionase. After receiving a mating signal, the transfer initiates with the oriT nicking reaction catalysed by the MobA89K and MobC89K proteins. The cleaved strand is then unwound by the helicase and delivered to the 89K-encoded GI-type T4SS machinery. The VirB1-89K component is thought to act as a lytic transglycosylase, locally opening the peptidoglycan with contributions from some other factor(s) during the assembly of the transport channel. VirD4-89K is a coupling protein required to deliver the DNA substrate to the transport channel, and together with VirB4-89K, required to energize the substrate transport across the channel. The highly hydrophobic VirB6-89K homologue constitutes the main portion of the transport channel.",

Amplification products were designed to be of similar length to facilitate quantitative comparison. The amount of attP DNA in each sample was normalized to that of the chromosomal hyd gene located immediately downstream of attB. The amplification specificity of each PCR was confirmed by determining melting curves and by electrophoresis of the final PCR products, and efficiency was determined using linearized pMDph plasmid DNA, which contains a single copy of attP (157 bp) and an internal region of hyd (156 bp) as a template. qPCR reactions and data analysis were performed as described by He et al.

Cells were centrifuged and washed to remove the antibiotics, and then diluted 1:10 in pre-warmed fresh THY medium to ensure that cultures were in exponential phase during the matings. Two hundred microlitres of donor culture and 1 ml of recipient culture (1:5 ratio) were mixed in a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube and spun for 2 min in a microfuge at 14 000 r.p.m. to pellet the cells. The pellet was resuspended in 50 ml pre-warmed THY supplemented with 10 mM MgCl2, 2 mg ml -1 BSA and 100 U DNase I. The cell mixtures were placed on sterile nitrocellulose filters (0.45 mm, Millipore) and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 6 h. Cells were removed by washing the filters in 1 ml of THY medium. Transconjugants were selected on THY medium with spectinomycin and chloramphenicol. Conjugative transfer frequencies were calculated as the number of transconjugant cells per donor. To confirm the occurrence of transfer, 10 transconjugants from each mating were randomly selected for PCR analysis with specific primers.",
