However, the region faces a serious problem of ethnic violence. This unrest has led to the loss of over 2,600 lives and more than 7,000 injuries in the past 5 years. It is possible that the local health systems may have deteriorated due to the unrest leading to loosening of preparedness against the threat of an influenza pandemic. We have therefore conducted a study to investigate the preparedness. The current report is confined to perceptions related to the threat of an influenza pandemic with the objective to document the patterns of perception of health personnel toward this threat in southern Thailand. As health personnel are key persons for influenza pandemic preparedness and con-trol, it is hoped that understanding their patterns of perception will allow control programs to properly improve the training. It may also be useful for other developing countries where an influenza pandemic is a serious threat, but the personnel are not fully prepared.",

While conventional factor analysis is used in scale development and tries to group items or variables, Q method tries to group subjects. Therefore, people of the same group or having the same factor will have a similar pattern of chosen statements. The implication would be that it would be easy to put people of the same factor into the same intervention program. This method was taken into our study because this is a scientific and systematic study of human subjectivity, involving perceptions, attitudes, and opinions [15, 16] . Furthermore, it is also unique since it mixes the strong points of both qualitative and quantitative research techniques, compared to traditional surveys [17, 18] .",

Afterward, a Q sample (a representative set of statements) is selected from the concourse and developed to be more meaningful, which represents various issues of the study topic and eventually is compiled into the instrument. The study subjects are then asked to rank the representative statements and place them into a score sheet, which is designed in a continuous scale ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree, following a standardized instruction based on the judgment of each subject. This is known as the Q sorting procedure. The sheets that are completely ranked by each subject (Qsort) are finally correlated and analyzed by Q (subjectwise) factor analysis, and the factors are then interpreted.",

The protection motivation theory (PMT) was used as a basis for grouping and developing the statements into four domains: perceived severity, perceived vulnerability, perceived response efficacy, and perceived self-efficacy, by refining, clarifying, and combining the raw statements to be more meaningful and more understandable. To catch various aspects of an influenza pandemic and keeping the total number of the statements suitably manageable by our subjects, we included eight refined statements in each of such four domains with one additional item added to make the total number of the statements equal 33 (Qsample). These statements were then placed into the score sheet (Figure 1 ), and forced to follow a quasi-normal distribution, that is, 2-3-4-5-5-5-4-3-2. The reliability of this instrument was tested with Cronbach's alpha. Each statement was randomly assigned a number from 1 to 33 for the subjects to arrange and place into the score sheet. To get more understandability, the statements were pilottested with 25 health personnel and were then revised as appropriate before the study.",

Previous metaanalyses provided evidence for self-efficacy having the largest effect size and was the strongest predictions of protection motivation [23, 24] . People with low self-efficacy usually believe that tasks are harder than they can handle. This can lead to limit task planning, increase stress, reduce the low level of attempt, and having a tendency to avoid duties and activities [20] [21] [22] . Balicer et al. reported that nearly a half of local health workers may be unwilling to report to duty during a pandemic event [9] . However, that study did not identify different patterns of health workers as our study has done. Another conventional survey conducted among a general population (rather than health workers) in developed countries of Europe and Asia on avian influenza risk perception showed a similar result. The level of self-efficacy among the respondents was also low and the authors concluded that a low level of self efficacy may obstruct any interventions [25] .",

The threat of a pandemic may be less compared to in urban areas. The study was based on Q methodology which had never been employed among local health workers; thus, the data have to be interpreted with caution. Approximately 30% of the respondents were not able to be classified into any of the three groups determined by our factor analysis. The patterns are therefore far from ideal. The statements about influenza pandemic that were used in our study should be improved to be more specific for health workers in future work.",

Strong consistent perceptions of implementing recommended measures against an influenza pandemic can remove or mitigate impacts of this threat, and may suggest a low priority to convince health personnel on the efficacy of the measures. Perception of low self-efficacy in certain subgroups who gave low scores on the statements related to self-efficacy on an influenza pandemic indicates the need to improve self-confidence of health personnel to participate in an emergency response by the control program.",
