Public health surveillance dates back to the \ufffdrst recorded epidemic in 3180 B.C. in Egypt. Hippocrates (460 B.C.-370 B.C.) coined the terms endemic and epidemic, John Graunt (1620-1674) introduced systematic data analysis, Samuel Pepys (1633-1703) started epidemic \ufffdeld investigation, \ufffdilliam Farr (1807-1883) founded the modern concept of surveillance, John Snow (1813-1858) linked data to intervention, and Alexander Langmuir gave the \ufffdrst comprehensive de\ufffdnition of surveillance. Current theories, principles, and practice of public health surveillance are summarized. A number of surveillance dichotomies, such as epidemiologic surveillance versus public health surveillance, are described. Some future scenarios are presented, while current activities that can affect the future are summarized: exploring new frontiers; enhancing computer technology; improving epidemic investigations; improving data collection, analysis, dissemination, and use; building on lessons from the past; building capacity; enhancing global surveillance. It is concluded that learning from the past, re\ufffdecting on the present, and planning for the future can further enhance public health surveillance.",

In consequence of what I said, the handle of the pump was removed on the following day\" [59] . On September 8, 1854, Snow removed the pump handle and the epidemic waned [13, 60] . Snow's work is a good illustration of collection, analysis, interpretation, and dissemination of data leading to public health intervention. Systematic reporting of various diseases started in the United States in 1874 in Massachusetts [61] . \ue062e Massachusetts State Board of Health inaugurated a plan for weekly voluntary reporting of prevalent diseases by physicians [34] . A sample postcard was designed to \"reduce to the minimum the expenditure of time and trouble incident to the service asked of busy medical men\" [35] . In Europe mandatory reporting of infectious diseases started in Italy in 1888, and in the United Kingdom in 1890. Finally, the 20th century brought the expansion and diversi\ufffdcation of public health surveillance systems. Table 3 gives some of the more important events related to the development of surveillance in the last century.",

A detailed account of the development of the public health surveillance system in the United States for 1850-1950 is given elsewhere [30, 36, 62] . It is of interest to know the brief history of the US agency known as \"CDC\" that is responsible for public health surveillance in the United States. \ue062e CDC was founded in 1942 as the Office of National Defense Malaria Control Activities [63, 64] . Atlanta was chosen as the location because malaria was endemic in the Southern US. In 1946, the agency changed its name to Communicable Disease Center, and hence the acronym \"CDC\" [63] . In 1947, CDC took over the Public Health Service Plague Laboratory in San Francisco, thus acquiring an Epidemiology Division. In 1955, CDC established the Polio Surveillance Program, in order to prove that an epidemic could be traced to a single vaccine manufacturer [33] . In 1961, CDC took over publication of Morbidity and Mortality Weekly (MMWR). \ue062e Communicable Disease Center was renamed the Center for Disease Control in 1970, then the Centers for Disease Control effective 1980 [63, 64] . An act of the United States Congress appended the words \"and Prevention\" to the name effective 1992. However, Congress also speci\ufffded that the agency continue to use the acronym \"CDC\" because of its recognition within the public health community and among the public [65] .",

In recent decades, awareness of the limitations of sample-based epidemiologic studies has grown. \u2026 [H]ealth research can be conducted in the next century using well-maintained and well-validated surveillance databases\" [74] . Epidemiologic research studies that are sample-based are subject to errors caused by the \"False Positive Research Cycle\": false positive associations (positive associations that are not true) will continue to be con\ufffdrmed by a multitude of subsequent studies that are designed to test a hot topic due to an initial false positive report that is incorrect (hot topic bias), and subsequent ampli\ufffdcation of the errors through cycles caused by the tendency of authors to write up and submit positive \ufffdndings but not the true negative \ufffdndings (positive results bias) and of editors to accept and publish positive \ufffdndings (editor's bias) [74, 87, 88] . One way to resolve these errors is population-based epidemiologic surveillance. Choi's 1998 [74] de\ufffdnition of surveillance stresses on the concept of \"population-based\" ( Table 5 ). Resources required for population-based epidemiologic surveillance systems can be formidable, but progress in technology and informatics may soon make implementation much easier to achieve [89] .",

Delphi survey is a method that requires experts to answer questionnaires in two or more cycles, with a feedback summary of experts' opinion a\ue09der each cycle, in order to converge towards a consensus [103] .",

Information for epidemiological purposes is required for a very wide range of relatively common infectious diseases and could best be obtained from a small number of sentinels [137] . \ue062is would give a more accurate picture of a sample of the population, from which extrapolation for national and international comparisons could be done [161] .",

According to the World Health Organization, mental illnesses account for more collective disability burden in developed countries than any other group of illnesses, such as cancer and heart disease [174] . Although mental health measures are now included in established health surveys, there are challenges not seen before. \ue062e ways different surveys de\ufffdne and measure mental illnesses o\ue09den vary and are based on different approaches (such as symptoms, duration, frequency, reference periods, mental health measures, and method of data collection) [175] . In discussing future directions for public health surveillance, Freeman and colleagues suggest that \"(F)uture public health surveillance systems should incorporate measures of positive psychological function as both a protective factor against poor health outcomes and a mental health indicator of interest in its own right\" [76] . Surveillance has traditionally focused largely on established disease or symptoms, but collection of additional data on resilience, coping skills, protective factors, and aspects of positive mental health are considerations in devising strategies for disease prevention and mental health promotion. Maintaining focus on the overall health of our population will be critical in the next decades, as will leaving behind the commonly accepted divide between mental and physical illnesses, \"despite the fact that both exist within individuals in an exquisitely integrated fashion\" [176] . In the future, an optimal surveillance system will examine interactions among biological, social, psychological, and environmental factors to support health promotion, intervention programs, and both mental illness and chronic disease prevention.",

In 2001, the US CDC began implementing the National Electronic Disease Surveillance System (NEDSS) to better manage and enhance the large number of current surveillance systems and allow the public health community to respond more quickly to public health threats (e.g., outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases and bioterrorism) [75] . In 2007, 35 US states had integrated public health surveillance systems as articulated in the NEDSS vision [180] . When NEDSS is fully implemented across the United States, public health professionals and government agencies will be able to quickly recognize and respond in real-time to disease outbreaks or bioterrorism attacks. \ue062e Minitel system used in France has also demonstrated the essential utility of office-based surveillance for a variety of conditions of public health importance [36, 181] .",

Rapid technology development in the laboratory has improved diagnostic precision and reduced the time necessary to make a diagnosis. \ue062ese improvements should continue, for example, to identify pathogens in imported foods at the place of importation and among persons who now travel more extensively and more rapidly around the globe [190] . Similarly, increased use of electronic health records (one form of eHealth [182] ) will facilitate more timely and accurate data collection as well as real-time dissemination of recommended control measures to clinicians and health-care facilities. Statisticians continue to develop new statistical methods that will provide insights through re\ufffdned data analysis. For example, mathematical modeling, especially in complex and timeconsuming investigations (e.g., pandemic in\ufffduenza), can enable application of control measures to reduce the number of cases that are epidemic related. Improved techniques for training also need to be developed so that the technology of epidemic investigations can be used effectively by public health practitioners [190] .",

A timeseries study found that the \"Do Not Call Registry\" available in many countries has no signi\ufffdcant impact on survey response rates [194] . Real-time interpretation during a telephone survey, which can expand the number of languages in which surveys are offered, was found to produce favourable results [195] . Other studies examined using mixed survey modes, such as internet and mail questionnaires, to increase participation in telephone surveys [196, 197] . Recent survey methodology studies also found address-based sampling to be promising [198, 199] and cellular telephone surveys to be able to reach the young age groups that were most likely to be excluded by random digit dialling [200, 201] . \ue062e American Association for Public Opinion Research 2012 Conference discussed new frontiers in public opinion research, including cell phone surveys, surveys with proxies and with immigrants, dual frame sample, mixed mode survey, optimal sample allocation, interactive and gaming techniques, and linking data with action [202] .",

To use surveillance information to better prioritize, plan, deliver, and evaluate programming, public health staff must possess the required knowledge and skills. While it is neither feasible nor necessary for all staff to receive postgraduate academic training, a greater proportion of the public health workforce will need to acquire the knowledge and skills necessary to effectively understand and use surveillance concepts and techniques.

Using a dot map, he illustrated the cluster of cholera cases around the pump. Snow wrote: \"On proceeding to the spot, I found that nearly all the deaths had taken place within a short distance of the [Broad Street] pump. \ue0bbere were only ten deaths in houses situated decidedly nearer to another street-pump. In \ufffdve of these cases the families of the deceased persons informed me that they always sent to the pump in Broad Street, as they preferred the water to that of the pumps which were nearer. In three other cases, the deceased were children who went to school near the pump in Broad Street\u2026 With regard to the deaths occurring in the locality belonging to the pump, there were 61 instances in which I was informed that the deceased persons used to drink the pump water from Broad Street, either constantly or occasionally\u2026 \ue0bbe result of the inquiry, then, is, that there has been no particular outbreak or prevalence of cholera in this part of London except among the persons who were in the habit of drinking the water of the above-mentioned pump well.
