Biases inherent in random PCR-amplification, cross-hybridization effects, and inadequate microarray analysis, however, limit detection sensitivity and specificity. Here, we have studied the relationships between viral amplification efficiency, hybridization signal, and target-probe annealing specificity using a customized microarray platform. Novel features of this platform include the development of a robust algorithm that accurately predicts PCR bias during DNA amplification and can be used to improve PCR primer design, as well as a powerful statistical concept for inferring pathogen identity from probe recognition signatures. Compared to real-time PCR, the microarray platform identified pathogens with 94% accuracy (76% sensitivity and 100% specificity) in a panel of 36 patient specimens. Our findings show that microarrays can be used for the robust and accurate diagnosis of pathogens, and further substantiate the use of microarray technology in clinical diagnostics.",

Traditional methods of culture and antibodybased detection still play a central role in microbiological laboratories despite the problems of the delay between disease presentation and diagnosis, the limited number of organisms that can be detected by these approaches, and the 'hit-ormiss' nature of the diagnostic process, which depends on a clinical prediction of the infectious source [1] . Faster diagnosis of infections would reduce morbidity and mortality, for example, through the earlier implementation of appropriate antimicrobial treatment. During the past few decades, various methods have been proposed to achieve this, with those based on nucleic acid detection, including PCR and microarray-based techniques, seeming the most promising. These approaches are beginning to rapidly decrease laboratory turnaround times so that results can be available within 2-6 hours compared to perhaps 24 hours. Future developments may see this reduced even further; and through the development of point-of-care devices, perhaps enable the clinician to make the diagnosis directly at the bed-side [2, 3] .",

For example, in clinical specimens, contaminating nucleic acid sequences, such as those derived from the host tissue, will cross-hybridize with pathogen-specific microarray probes above some threshold of sequence complementarity. This can result in false-positive signals that lead to erroneous conclusions. Similarly, the pathogen sequence, in addition to binding its specific probes, may cross-hybridize with other non-target probes (that is, probes designed to detect other pathogens). This latter phenomenon, though seemingly problematic, could provide useful information for pathogen identification to the extent that such cross-hybridization can be accurately predicted. With various metrics to assess annealing potential and sequence specificity, microarray probes have traditionally been designed to ensure maximal specific hybridization (to a known target) with minimal cross-hybridization (to nonspecific sequences). However, in practice we have found that many probes, though designed using optimal in silico parameters, do not perform according to expectations for reasons that are unclear (CW Wong et al., unpublished data).",

Together with 7 replicates for each viral probe, and control sequences for array synthesis and hybridization (see Materials and methods), the array contained a total of 390,482 probes. Initially, we studied virus samples purified from cell lines, reverse-transcribed and PCR-amplified with virus-specific primers (instead of random primers). This allowed us to study array hybridization dynamics in a controlled fashion, without the complexity of cross-hybridization from human RNA and random annealing dynamics, which occur with random primers. We then applied our findings to clinical samples amplified using random primers.",

The SARS sample hybridized well to the SARS tiling probes, with all 3,805 SARS-specific probes displaying fluorescent (Cy3) signal well above the detection threshold (determined by probe signal intensities >2 standard deviations (SD) above the mean array signal intensity; Figure 1a ). Cross-hybridization with other pathogen probe sets was minimal, observed only for other members of Coronaviridae and a few species of Picornaviridae and Paramyxoviridae, consistent with the observation that SARS shares little sequence homology with other known viruses [14] . The hybridization pattern of Dengue 1, on the other hand, was more complex (Figure 1b) . First, we observed that hybridization to the Dengue 1 probe set was partially incomplete (that is, there were regions absent of signal) due to sequence polymorphisms. The Dengue 1 sample hybridized on the array was cultured from a 1944 Hawaiian isolate, whereas the array probe set was based on the sequence of a Singaporean strain S275/90, isolated in 1990 [15] . Sequencing the entire genomes of these 2 isolates revealed that the array probes that failed to hybridize each contained at least 3 mismatches (within a 15-base stretch) to the sample sequence. Second, we observed that cross-hybridization occurred to some degree with almost all viral probe sets present on the array, particularly with probes of other Flaviviridae members, consistent with the fact that the 4 Dengue serotypes share 60-70% homology. To understand the relationship between hybridization signal output and annealing specificity, we first compared all probe sequences to each viral genome using two measures of similarity: probe hamming distance (HD) and maximum contiguous match (MCM). HD measures the overall similarity distance of two sequences, with low scores for similar sequences [16, 17] .",

Although the Dengue 1 sequence used to derive the Dengue 1 r-signature was approximately 5% different from the Hawaiian isolate, the detectable probe ratio of the Dengue 1 specific probes was 151/152 (99%), 12 times higher then that for the nearest Dengue serotype signature, suggesting that moderate polymorphic variation is quite tolerable, allowing, in this case, for discernment of the correct pathogen.",

However, in initial experiments using random priming amplification to identify known pathogens, we frequently observed incomplete hybridization of the pathogen genome marked by interspersed genomic regions not detected by the probes. An example involving the amplification of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) B from a human nasopharyngeal aspirate is shown in Figure 3 . In preliminary analyses, sequence polymorphisms, probe GC content and genome secondary structure failed to explain this phenomenon, suggesting that it might result from a PCRbased amplification bias stemming from differential abilities of the random primers to bind to the viral genome at the reverse transcription (RT) step. The random primer used in Heatmap of microarray probe signal intensities our experiments was a 26-mer composed of a random nonamer (3') tagged with a fixed 17-mer sequence (5'-GTTTC-CCAGTCACGATA) [4, 9, 22] . Intra-primer secondary structure formation, such as dimer and hairpin formation between the 17-mer tag and nonamer, and probe melting temperature are known to influence binding efficiency [23, 24] . To explore our hypothesis, we designed an algorithm to model the RT-PCR process using experimental data (see Additional data file 1 for details). Briefly, it calculates the probability that a 500-1,000 base-pair product (average size range of PCR product) can be generated from each possible starting position in the genome assuming that a nonamer in the random primer mix will complement the viral sequence perfectly. This probability is reduced when intra-primer hairpin formation is predicted, and increased according to degree of complementarity between tag sequence and viral sequence. In this manner, the probability that each nucleotide will be successfully PCR-amplified is reflected in its AES (see supplemental methods in Additional data file 1 and [25] ). To validate the algorithm, we ranked the hybridization signal intensities for all 1,948 probes tiled across the RSV B genome and compared them to their AES values ( Figure 3 ). We observed that high AES significantly correlates to probe hybridization signal intensity above the detection threshold (P = 2.2 \u00d7 10 -16 ; Fisher's exact test). In another experiment involving a patient sample positive for metapneumovirus Relationship between probe HD, probe MCM and probe signal intensity Figure 2 Relationship between probe HD, probe MCM and probe signal intensity. Average probe signal intensity and percentage of detectable probes (signal intensity > mean + 2 SD) decreases as HD increases and MCM decreases. The optimal cross-hybridization thresholds HD \u2264 4 or MCM \u2265 18, where >98% of probes can be detected, is shaded in blue. (hMPV), the probes tiled across the hMPV genome showed a similar result, P = 1.3 \u00d7 10 -9 . Repeatedly, we observed that higher AES correlated with greater probe detection, with, on average, >70% detection for probes in the top 20% AES (see supplemental methods in Additional data file 1).",

In a comparative study of eight patient samples (five RSV, three hMPV), we observed that primer A2 showed a marked improvement in overall PCR efficiency in amplifying both RSV and hMPV over the original primer, A1 (Figures S2 and S3 in Additional data file 1). The increased PCR efficiency contributed to increased hybridization of DNA to the probes, and is reflected in the uniformly higher signal intensities observed using primer A2. Consequently, >70% of viral probes had signal intensities above detection threshold when using primer A2, compared to approximately 20% using primer A1 (Anova test, P = 0.00026; Figure S3 in Additional data file 1).",

(a) Distribution of probe signal intensities of all 53,555 probes (red) and rsignature probes for an absent pathogen, for example, parainfluenza-1 (dotted line), show a normal distribution. The distribution of signal intensity for RSV r-signature probes are positively skewed, with higher signal intensities in the tail of the distribution. (b) Distribution frequency of WKL scores for the 35 pathogen r-signatures with the majority ranging between -5 and 3. A non-normal WKL score distribution is observed (P < 0.05 by Anderson Darling test). The presence of a pathogen is indicated by a non-normal distribution caused by outlier WKL = 17, corresponding to RSV. Excluding the RSV r-signature WKL score results in a normal distribution. From this computation, we conclude that RSV is present in the hybridized sample. ond part of PDA, the distribution of WKL scores is subjected to an Anderson-Darling test for normality. If P < 0.05, the WKL distribution is considered not normal, implying that the pathogen with an outlying WKL score is present. Upon iden- tification of a pathogen, that pathogen's WKL score is left out, and a separate Anderson-Darling test is performed to test for the presence of co-infecting pathogens. In this manner, the procedure is iteratively applied until only normal distributions remain (that is, P > 0.05). The PDA algorithm is extremely fast, capable of making a diagnosis from a hybridized microarray in less than 10 seconds.",

Analysis of the published RSV A partial genome sequence (923 bp, Genbank ID: AF516119) revealed that 7 probes on our microarray had 100% identity to RSV A. We created an 'RSV A rsignature' comprising these 7 probes, enabling the specific detection of RSV A by microarray in 4/7 patient samples PCRpositive for RSV A (patients 414, 832, 913, and 924). Although the performance of this small r-signature was not as robust as the other virus r-signatures (median size: 249 probes), it suggested that it was feasible to pursue a 'viral discovery' approach using r-signatures created to detect viruses at the family or genus level that were related to those species already represented on the microarray. Specifically, we binned probes into family-or genus-level r-signatures by relaxing our similarity criteria (to HD \u2264 5 or MCM \u2265 25) and selecting probes common to genome sequences within families and genera for the picornaviridae family, paramyxoviridae family, rhinovirus genus (HRV) and pneumovirus genus (inclusive of RSV and hMPV).",

This finding was intriguing given that the genomic diversity of the over 100 known rhinovirus serotypes makes detection by PCR notoriously difficult [28] . As the real-time PCR primers were capable of identifying only approximately 70% of rhinovirus strains, it is possible that the microarray correctly detected a rhinovirus strain that PCR failed to detect. Similarly, the pneumovirus genus detected in patient 283 could not be verified by RT-PCR, possibly owing to subtle genetic variations that prevented primer annealing.

For example, the array described by Wang et al. [9] is based on probes designed to recognize the most conserved viral domains, facilitating the detection of a taxonomic fingerprint that provides powerful clues to viral identity with minimal probe usage. Lin et al. [8], on the other hand, described a probe-dense resequencing array capable of detecting a smaller set of predefined pathogens, but with higher detection specificity, including the ability to discern highly related subtypes. The microarray described herein represents a blend of these two concepts, integrating a probe tiling approach for substantial genomic coverage (though with lower probe density than a resequencing array), with a taxonomy-based strategy for binning probes into pathogen recognition signatures. Thus, our analytical output includes both family-and genus-level predictions (for r-signatures restricted to conserved probes) as well as species-specific predictions (for r-signatures composed of conserved and unique probes). Indeed, this capability allowed us to detect and accurately identify viruses in clinical samples ( Table 2 ).",

Unfortunately, few such algorithms exist, and only one algorithm, E-Predict, has been reported and validated [5, 29, 30] . E-Predict matches hybridization signatures with predicted pathogen signatures derived from the theoretical free energy of hybridization for each microarray probe. To examine the performance of E-predict on our microarray platform, we analyzed a number of samples with both E-predict and our PDA algorithm. When applied to our microarray data, E-Predict performed well, with its first prediction tending to be the correct one (Table S2 in Additional data file 1). However, for each specimen, a number of false positive calls were also made, which seemed to reflect species with considerable sequence similarity to the true infecting pathogen (Table S2 in Additional data file 1). For example, in patient sample 412, E-Predict detected RSV (the correct pathogen), but also multiple species of coronavirus (which share some sequence similarity with RSV), yet real-time PCR using pancoronavirus primers as well as primers specific for strains OC43 and 229E indicated the absence of coronavirus from this sample ( Figure S4 in Additional data file 1). These false positive calls can be explained by the fact that the function of E-Predict is less geared towards identifying and distinguishing specific pathogen strains, and aimed more at elucidating the best possible candidates as supported by the available probes. Thus, E-Predict is particularly advantageous in situations where a pathogen's sequence is not fully known [5] . In contrast, our PDA algorithm is designed to make calls with greater species-level resolution. A major strength of PDA is its ability to specifically identify sequence-characterized and coinfecting pathogens with low false positivity. This is aptly demonstrated by the ability of PDA to detect specifically the presence of Dengue 1 in the clinical sample, where 7/35 viruses on the array are from the Flaviviridae family, including 4 dengue serotypes that share 70% sequence homology. The benefits of using both algorithms simultaneously for detecting both known and novel pathogens should be further evaluated.",

[41] and HRV [42] have been described. Samples underwent reverse transcription at 48\u00b0C for 30 minutes, then were heated at 95\u00b0C for 10 minutes and amplified by 40 cycles of 15 s at 95\u00b0C and 1 minute at 60\u00b0C on an ABI Prism 7900HT Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems). During amplification, fluorescence emissions were monitored at every thermal cycle. The threshold (Ct) represents the cycle at which significant fluorescence is first detected. Ct value was converted to copy number using a control plasmid of known concentration: RSV A, 5.06 \u00d7 10 9 copies had a Ct value of 10.469; RSV B, 2.61 \u00d7 10 9 copies had a Ct value of 11.897; hMPV, 7.51 \u00d7 10 9 copies had a Ct value of 10.51; HRV, 1.73 \u00d7 10 7 copies had a Ct value of 20.20.",

Using an automated script (J George and V Vega), we calculated the median signal intensity and standard deviation from the seven replicates of each probe. The probe signal intensities were sorted by genome and arranged in sequence order, then reformatted into CDT format for graphical viewing of signal intensities in Java Treeview [44] . In parallel, the probe median signal intensities were analyzed using PDA to determine which pathogen was present, and the associated confidence level of prediction. The AES and PDA algorithms are described in detail in the Results section and all algorithms, formulae, software and microarray data are available on the supplemental website [25] and in Additional data file 1.",
