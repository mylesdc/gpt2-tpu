We found that the nonspecific thiol/ disulfide exchange inhibitor, 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB), significantly reduced HIV-1 entry and infection in cell lines, human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM), and also phytohemagglutinin (PHA)stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Subsequent studies were performed using specific anti-PDI or Trx monoclonal antibodies (mAb) in HIV-1 envelope pseudotyped and wild type (wt) virus infection systems. Although human donor-to-donor variability was observed as expected, Trx appeared to play a greater role than PDI in HIV-1 infection of MDM. In contrast, PDI, but not Trx, was predominantly involved in HIV-1 entry and infection of the CD4 + /CCR5 + T cell line, PM-1, and PHA-stimulated primary human T lymphocytes. Intriguingly, both PDI and Trx were present on the surface of MDM, PM-1 and PHA-stimulated CD4 + T cells. However, considerably lower levels of Trx were detected on freshly isolated CD4 + lymphocytes, compared to PHA-stimulated cells.",

They also establish a cell-type specificity regarding the involvement of particular disulfide isomerases/reductases in this process and may provide an explanation for differences among previously published studies. More importantly, from an in vivo perspective, the preferential utilization of PDI may be relevant to the HIV-1 entry and establishment of virus reservoirs in resting CD4 + cells, while the elevated levels of Trx reported in the chronic stages of HIV-1 infection may facilitate the virus entry in macrophages and help to sustain high viremia during the decline of T lymphocytes.",

This interaction induces a structural rearrangement in Env, exposing conserved regions within the gp120 subunit, thereby enabling binding to an appropriate co-receptor, primarily the chemokine receptors CXCR4 or CCR5 [12, 13] . Engagement of gp120 to the co-receptor triggers conformational changes in the gp41 subunit, exposing its hydrophobic amino-terminal fusion peptide which inserts into the host cell membrane, followed by the formation of the six helix bundle (trimerof-hairpin) structure that enables fusion of the virus and cell membranes and the subsequent release of the viral capsid into the cytosol (reviewed in [12, 14] .",

At present, there is still ambiguity regarding which enzyme(s) mediate the disulfide bond rearrangements. The majority of studies investigating the effects of disulfide isomerase/reductase inhibitors [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] 22] , specific polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies (Ab) directed against these enzymes [16, 18, 20] , as well as fluorescent microscopy and Western blot analysis of gp120 interactions and/ or reduction of disulfide bonds [20, 23, 24] , imply that PDI is the key enzyme involved in the HIV-1 entry process. However, it has also been reported [25] that Trx plays a major role during HIV-1 Env induced fusion, while PDI expression and/or function has a negligible effect. In yet another study [26] , it was shown that another member of the Trx superfamily, glutaredoxin-1 (Grx1), can reduce disulfide bonds in both CD4 and gp120, and its inhibition results in reduced HIV-1 infection.",

R5 strains of HIV-1 are primarily involved in virus transmission; they predominate during the early and asymptomatic stages of infection, and are typically present throughout the symptomatic phase of HIV disease (reviewed in [27] ). For these reasons, we conducted a comprehensive study using a panel of distinct assays to focus extensively on the significance of thiol/disulfide exchange during entry of several R5-tropic HIV-1 strains, including those that were minimally passaged, into their natural targetsprimary human macrophages and CD4 + lymphocytes. In addition, we determined the effects of disulfide reductase/isomerase inhibitors on human macrophage infection with HIV-1 92UG024 , one of the few primary X4tropic strains capable of infecting these cells [28] . Our results provide critical new information on the role of disulfide isomerases in HIV infection and further support previous observations that thiol/disulfide exchange is required for HIV-1 entry. More interestingly, our data reveal cell-type specificity with respect to the enzymes involved in this process.",

Since these particles were only competent for single cycle infection and were produced using the same backbone plasmid, their application allowed a more accurate assessment of the effect of DTNB on distinct HIV-1 Env-pseudotyped virions and/or experimental cell systems. After a brief pre-incubation (~1 h), cells were infected in the presence of DTNB for 2.5 h, followed by an extensive washout of the reagent. About 48 h later, cells were lysed, and Luc activity was measured and expressed in relative light units (RLU). In HOS CD4 + /CCR5 + cells, DTNB exposure potently reduced infection by HIV-1 JR-FL or HIV-1 AD8 Env-pseudotyped virions ( Figure 1A ) without impairing cell viability (trypan blue exclusion test). DTNB also caused a similar dosedependent suppression of HIV-1 JR-FL Env-pseudotyped virion infection of the JC53 CD4 + /CCR5 + cell line, as well as primary macrophages and PBMCs ( Figure 1B ,C,D), without significantly altering the cell surface expression of CD4 or chemokine co-receptors (data not shown). DTNB incubation also has no effect on Luc activity in cells directly electroporated with the pNL4-3 e-R+ Luc plasmid used to generate the reporter gene-encoding HIV-1 Env pseudotyped virus particles (data not shown), consistent with previous observations that DTNB is nearly plasma membrane impermeable [29, 30] .",

            "text": "DTNB inhibits HIV-1 particle fusion with primary human cells and CD4 + /CCR5 + cell lines It is well-documented that the HIV-1 life cycle involves multiple steps that include viral Env-mediated membrane fusion, uncoating of viral RNA, reverse transcription, proviral DNA integration, transcription, and translation, as well as viral particle assembly and budding [31] . Given that DTNB could potentially interfere with multiple cell surface proteins containing sulphydryl groups, although unlikely, it was still possible that the effect of DTNB on HIV-1 replication could be nonspecific. For this reason, we sought to examine the effect of DTNB solely on virus entry by employing \u03b2-lactamase (BlaM)-containing virions [32, 33] prior to testing its effect on spreading HIV-1 infection in vitro. Negative controls prepared for DTNB treated and untreated cells confirmed that DTNB had no detrimental effects on loading of the cells with the fluorescent dye, CCF2/AM, and did not influence the background non-specific cell fluorescence (Figure 2A , B, upper graphs). In addition, cells electroporated with pMM310 (pcDNA3.1(Zeo)-Vpr-BlaM), incubated in 5 mM DTNB and subsequently loaded with the fluorescent dye CCF2/AM showed no significant difference in the number of blue cells, compared to cells incubated in DMEM only (data not shown), indicating that DTNB did not affect the BlaM enzymatic activity. Using HIV-1 AD8 BlaM containing virus particles, we established that DTNB significantly inhibited fusion of HIV-1 AD8 BlaM-containing virions with both the JC53 CD4 + /CCR5 + cell line ( Figure 2A ) and primary human PBMCs ( Figure 2B ), as well as MDMs ( Figure 2C ), indicating that its effect occurs predominantly at the level of virus entry and further supporting the role for thiol/disulfide exchange in HIV-1 Env during infection.",

DTNB was able to suppress infection by all three isolates with levels of reverse transcriptase activity approaching those observed for uninfected control MDM, indicating that its effect was not strain specific ( Figure 3A ,B,C). To identify the disulfide reductases/isomerases involved in HIV-1 infection of MDM and serving as potential targets for DTNB, the effects of specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against PDI and/or Trx, two enzymes previously implicated in HIV-1 Env disulfude bond rearrangements [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] were evaluated. The mAbs were applied before and during virus adsorption/fusion; HIV-1 infection was monitored by measuring RT activity at various time points throughout the course of infection. Anti-PDI or anti-Trx mAbs significantly inhibited MDM infection by all three HIV-1 strains tested. However, data obtained from multiple experiments performed with HIV-1 ADA established that the anti-Trx mAb was more efficient in reducing RT values and delaying the time of peak RT activity during infection ( Figure 3D ,E and data not shown), suggesting that Trx may play a greater role in disulfide bond rearrangement in HIV-1 R5 isolates.",

The same mAb clones used to inhibit HIV-1 infection were directly conjugated to different fluorescent dyes (anti-PDI-DyLight 488 and anti-Trx-APC), and used for Flow Cytometry analysis. Although PDI and Trx are predominantly found as intracellular proteins, it is well-documented that these molecules can also be secreted and associate with the plasma membrane [34] [35] [36] . Given that cell surface PDI and Trx molecules are peripheral plasma membrane proteins, the cells prepared for Flow Cytometry analysis of cell surface PDI and Trx were washed with DPBS, fixed with 1.6% paraformaldehyde prior to labeling to prevent dissociation from the cell surface and then treated with NH 4 Cl to quench the reactive aldehyde groups before incubation with the specific mAbs as described in Methods. In addition to the anti-PDI and anti-Trx mAbs, PBLs were also incubated with a specific anti-CD4 mAb, directly labeled with the fluorescent marker, Pacific blue, and only those cells that stained positive for CD4 were further analyzed for their PDI and Trx cell surface levels. We found that PM-1 cells and primary MDM expressed both PDI and Trx on their surface ( Figure 6A,B) . Intriguingly, in contrast to PDI which was present to comparable levels on both unstimulated and PHA-activated CD4+ T cells, Trx expression was very low on unstimulated CD4 + lymphocytes, but increased significantly after PHA treatment ( Figure 6C ). Taken together our findings strongly suggest that the cell type specific effects of anti-PDI and anti-Trx mAbs observed in PM-1 cells, primary MDM, and PHA activated PBLs cannot be ",

            "text": "There is growing evidence that thiol/disulfide exchange is required for the complex conformational changes that occur during virus-cell fusion. The mature HIV-1 Env is expressed as a trimer of gp120-gp41 heterodimers on the surface of virions and/or infected cells. HIV-1 gp120 consists of five variable domains (V1-V5) interconnected by five more conserved regions (C1-C5), delineated by nine intra-chain disulfide bonds [37, 38] . The gp41 ectodomain, in addition to its hydrophobic N-terminus, encompasses two hydrophobic regions with a characteristic coiled-coil structure, designated as heptad repeats 1 and 2, that are connected by a linker sequence forming a conserved disulfide bond [12, 39, 40] . Although there have been published reports from several independent studies on this topic, the number, location and timing of the HIV-1 Env disulfide bond modifications during virus entry are still not completely elucidated. The majority of disulfide bonds in gp120, delineating or inside domains V1/V2 (Cys 126 -Cys 196 ; Cys 119 -Cys 205 ; Cys 131 -Cys 157 ), V3 (Cys 296 -Cys 331 ), V4 (Cys 385 -Cys 418 ), C1 (Cys 54 -Cys 74 ), C2 (Cys 218 -Cys 247 ) and C4 (Cys 378 -Cys 445 ), as well as the disulfide bond in gp41, have all been implicated as potential targets for reduction and/or isomerization [11, 19, [41] [42] [43] . There has been some ambiguity with respect to when the disulfide bond rearrangements in gp120 take place: immediately following CD4-gp120 binding [19, 20] or after the interaction of gp120 with CD4 and the relevant coreceptor [17, 44] . It is reasonable to suggest that some of the disulfide bonds could be modified right after CD4 binding, if such rearrangements facilitate the subsequent coreceptor association while others, such as the disulfide bond straddling the V3 loop and critical for the integrity of the coreceptor binding site [15, 45] , may undergo modification after the gp120-CD4-coreceptor complex is formed.",

At present, there is no consensus regarding the particular disulfide reductases/isomerases that may be required for HIV-1 infection. Experimental data from various studies have confirmed the PDI mediated disulfide bond rearrangements in both gp120 [11, 20, 23, 24] and CD4 [26] , as well as the suppression of HIV-1 infection by PDI inhibitors [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . However, Trx has also been shown to induce redox changes in gp120 [25, 42] and CD4 [25, 46] and Ou et al., [25] found that Trx, not PDI, played a major role in HIV-1 Env-mediated fusion. Interestingly, it was recently reported [43] that, despite certain quantitative differences, PDI and Trx generally target the same disulfide bonds within gp120. Auwerx et al., [26] established that another oxidoreductase, Grx1, in addition to PDI, caused a disulfide bond reduction in gp120 and CD4 and also observed a significant (~50%), but incomplete, inhibition of HIV-1 RW009 infection by polyclonal anti-Grx1 Abs.",

            "text": "Given that there have been only a few reports on the effects of disulfide reductase/isomerase inhibitors on HIV-1 infection of primary human cells [16, 19, 26] , our current study set out to provide a comprehensive investigation of the role of thiol/disulfide exchange in HIV-1 infection using primary human PBMCs, PBLs and MDMs. Using single cycle as well as multi-round replication assays, we initially tested the effects of the nonspecific disulfide isomerase/reductase inhibitor, DTNB, employing predominantly R5 strains. In contrast to other viruses, such as hantaviruses [30] where surface glycoproteins express free thiol groups, it is unlikely that DTNB will interact directly with the HIV-1 Env, since those cysteines are interlinked via disulfide bonds. However, if reductase activity is not completely suppressed during the virus-cell fusion process, especially when lower DTNB concentrations are applied, potential alkylation by DTNB of the newly generated thiol groups may contribute to its inhibitory activity. We established that DTNB potently reduced HIV-1 entry and infection in primary cells to levels comparable to the observed inhibition in cell lines (Figure 1 and 2) . DTNB also inhibited MDM infection by all strains tested, including the primary, minimally passaged R5 strain BCF03 and X4 strain UG024. Attempts to identify the particular disulfide reductases/isomerases involved in HIV-1 entry by applying specific mAbs, unexpectedly revealed a clearly distinguished specificity among the various cell types tested (Figure 4 and 5) . In MDM, anti-Trx mAbs proved to be (See figure on previous page.) Figure 6 Cell surface expression of PDI and/or Thioredoxin. PM-1 T cells (panel A), primary human MDM (panel B) and PBLs (panel C) were isolated and cultured as described in Methods. Subsequently, the cells were fixed with 1.6% paraformaldehyde and treated with NH 4 Cl to quench the reactive aldehyde groups before labeling. The PDI and Trx levels on the cell surface were detected by a combination of directly labeled anti-PDI-FITC and anti-Trx-APC mAbs from the same clones used in the HIV-1 infection experiments. In addition, the unstimulated and PHA-P stimulated PBLs were labeled with anti-CD4-Pacific blue conjugated mAb, and the PDI and Trx expression were analyzed on the CD4+ lymphocyte (Ly) population. The results were analyzed and the final graphs were created using FlowJoe software. more potent than the anti-PDI mAbs in suppressing HIV-1 entry and infection. In contrast, these same anti-Trx mAbs had negligible effects on the PM-1 T cell line and primary PBLs, while the anti-PDI mAbs significantly reduced HIV-1 infection in these cells (Figure 3, 4 and  5) . Intriguingly, both PDI and Trx were present on the plasma membrane of all cell types tested ( Figure 6 ). Although it appeared that MDMs displayed higher levels of Trx than PDI on their surface, it is unlikely that this fact alone could account for the differences in the HIV-1 inhibitory activities of the anti-Trx and anti-PDI mAbs. In support of this notion, PM-1 cells and PHA stimulated PBLs expressed comparable levels of Trx and PDI on their surface, while anti-PDI and anti-Trx mAbs clearly exerted distinct patterns on HIV-1 infection when compared to each other or to their effects on primary human MDM (Figure 4 and 5) . It was previously shown that gp120, CD4, CXCR4 and PDI co-localize on the cell surface [20] and we speculated that a preferential temporal association of gp120, CD4 and the relevant corecepor with either PDI or Trx might be the reason for the observed cell-type specific oxidoreductase involvement in HIV-1 entry. Molecular docking analysis revealed that PDI may interact with the third immunoglobulin-like (D3) region of CD4 [10] . D3 contains one of the glycosylation sites in human CD4 [48] and it is conceivable that subtle differences in CD4 glycosylation may result in its preferential interaction with PDI in some cell types, but not in others. CD4 is also known to interact with the tyrosine kinase p56 lck in PBLs and T cell lines, but not in monocytes and MDM [49] , which may also influence its behavior on the cell surface in a cell-type dependent manner. CCR5 and CXCR4 heterogeneity [50] , as well as their preferential cell type dependent interactions with CD4 [45] , may also be contributing factors to the cell-type specific disulfide reductase/isomerase involvement in HIV-1 entry. Alternatively, or in combination with the parameters already discussed, there may be differences in the way T lymphocytes/T cell lines and macrophages regulate the balance between the oxidized and reduced forms of PDI and/or Trx on their surface, which in turn may favor the preferential involvement of one of these enzymes during HIV-1 entry. Cell surface molecules other than CD4 and CCR5 may also interact with PDI or Trx and influence their redox status and/or availability during HIV-1 entry. It was recently reported [51] that galectin-9 binds to and increases the retention of PDI on the cell surface, thus facilitating Th2 lymphocyte migration and HIV-1 infection most likely through modulation of the cell surface redox environment.",

The redox imbalance is a hallmark of HIV-1 infection, resulting in a complex chain of events at intra-and extracellular levels that influence HIV-1 replication (reviewed in [52, 53] ). The finding that freshly isolated PBLs, in contrast to PHAstimulated cells, express ample amounts of PDI yet express relatively low levels of Trx on their surface, may provide insights regarding the predominant utilization of PDI by CD4 + lymphocytes, the entry of HIV-1 in resting T cells, and the establishment of virus reservoirs. Given that MDM utilize predominantly Trx during HIV-1 entry ( Figures 3D,E and 5) , the observed elevation of plasma Trx during chronic stages of HIV disease [54, 55] may enhance macrophage infection and help sustain high viremia even when very low levels of CD4 + T-cells exist. In this regard, plasma Trx levels showed a significant inverse correlation with the survival rate of HIV-1infected patients having a CD4 + T cell count below 200 cells/\u03bcL [55] .",

The cell lines were maintained in DMEM (293 T, JC53 and HOS) or RPMI-1640 (PM-1), supplemented with 10% FCS, 2 mM L-glutamine, and antibiotics (DM-10 or RC-10) at 37\u00b0C in a humidified, 5% CO 2 atmosphere. Human PBMC were isolated by Ficoll-Paque TM gradient centrifugation from leukapheresis of healthy, human donors seronegative for HIV-1, HIV-2, hepatitis B and hepatitis C. Monocytes and lymphocytes were further separated using countercurrent centrifugal cell elutriation as previously described [63] . For the Luc reporter gene and the BlaM entry assays, macrophages were prepared from elutriated monocytes by differentiation in 100 mm square Petri dishes (Bibbi Sterilin Ltd., Stone Staffs, UK) in DMEM supplemented with 10% human serum pooled from multiple normal donors, 2 mM L-glutamine and antibiotics (M\u00d8 medium) [64, 65] . Human MDM were obtained after 7 to 14 days of differentiation in the absence of exogenous growth factors and were either used immediately after the differentiation period or kept frozen in liquid nitrogen. The day before the experiment, frozen cells were thawed, washed, centrifuged, and resuspended in DM-10 medium prior to incubation at 37\u00b0C overnight. ",

The BlaM-containing virus particles were produced and the JC53 CD4+/CCR5+ cells, primary human MDM, and PBMCs were cultured as described in Methods. DTNB was dissolved in pre-warmed phenol red free DMEM, and cells were pre-incubated for 1 h before addition of the virus. The infection period was 2 h at 37\u00b0C in serum-free medium for the JC53 cells (panel A) and 2.5 h for the primary PBMCs (panel B) and MDM (panel C) in the presence of DTNB. After incubation with BlaM-containing virus particles, cells were washed with DMEM, loaded with the fluorescent dye CCF2/AM for 1 h at RT, washed and further incubated in DM-10 (phenol red free, supplemented with 2.5 mM Probenecid) for 14 h in tissue culture plates at RT in the dark. Subsequently, the JC53 cells (after trypsinization) and the human PBMCs were transferred to microfuge tubes, fixed with 1.6% pareformaldehyde and analyzed using BD LSR II Cell Fluorometer equipped with a violet laser (407 nm excitation wavelength) and 460/30 nm and 530/20 nm emission filters for detection of the blue and green fluorescence, respectively (A,B). The primary human MDM (C), cultured in a borosilicate glass bottom plate (Whatmann), were fixed in situ and analyzed using a Laser Scanning Cytometer (CompuCyte, Cambridge, MA). Mock-infected cells (upper panels) were used to define the regions of negative (green) and positive (blue) cell populations in the presented histograms. The experiment with human MDM was performed in triplicates. The infection of the JC53 cells and primary PBMC was carried out in duplicate wells, which were combined before Flow Cytometry analysis.",
