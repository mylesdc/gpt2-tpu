The interaction of DC-SIGN with pathogens triggers specific signaling events that modulate DC-maturation and activity and regulate T-cell activation by DCs. In this work we evaluate whether F. hepatica glycans can immune modulate DCs via DC-SIGN. We demonstrate that DC-SIGN interacts with F. hepatica glycoconjugates through mannose and fucose residues. We also show that mannose is present in high-mannose structures, hybrid and trimannosyl N-glycans with terminal GlcNAc. Furthermore, we demonstrate that F. hepatica glycans induce DC-SIGN triggering leading to a strong production of TLR-induced IL-10 and IL-27p28. In addition, parasite glycans induced regulatory DCs via DC-SIGN that decrease allogeneic T cell proliferation, via the induction of anergic/regulatory T cells, highlighting the role of DC-SIGN in the regulation of innate and adaptive immune responses by F. hepatica. Our data confirm the immunomodulatory properties of DC-SIGN triggered by pathogen-derived glycans and contribute to the identification of immunomodulatory glyans of helminths that might eventually be useful for the design of vaccines against fasciolosis.",

They also regulate signaling or cellular interactions such as DC migration and T cell binding, modulating both innate and adaptive immunity 1 . Different CLRs have been identified as critical players in the carbohydrate-mediated immuneregulation induced by pathogens, such as MR, MGL, Dectin, or DC-SIGN. The latter, also known as ICAM-3 grabbing non-integrin or CD209, is a type II transmembrane protein that binds mannose-or fucose-containing N-glycans 2 . Previous works have demonstrated that DC-SIGN interacts with glycan structures from a variety of pathogens ranging from virus to fungi 3 . In fact DC-SIGN binds glycoconjugates from HIV 4 , coronavirus 5 , herpes simplex virus 6 , Helicobacter pylori 4 , Mycobacterium tuberculosis 4, 7, 8 , Candida albicans 9 , as well as cancer-related glycans 10 . More recently, different papers have reported that DC-SIGN also interacts with glycans form parasites, thereby modulating the immune response. Indeed, DC-SIGN recognizes not only protozoan parasites such as Leishmania sp. 11 , but also helminth parasites, such as Schistosoma mansoni [12] [13] [14] or Trichuris suis 15 .",

Fasciolosis, a helminth infection caused by Fasciola hepatica, is of paramount importance due to its wide spectrum of definitive hosts 25 and its worldwide distribution 26 affecting both cattle and human health. Several studies have independently demonstrated that F. hepatica-derived molecules inhibit or decrease DC activation, which results in the induction of a tolerogenic phenotype [27] [28] [29] [30] . In addition, F. hepatica tegumental antigen modulates DC activity by suppressing MAPK-signaling and by up-regulating the expression of the suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) 31 . Furthermore, we have demonstrated that DCs from mice infected with F. hepatica have a semi-mature phenotype that is characterized by low MHC II and CD40 expression and high secretion of the immunoregulatory cytokine IL-10 32 . Thus, it has been hypothesized that F. hepatica may modulate DC function and fate as a mean to control its pathogenesis and survival in the infected hosts.",

Our group has recently described that glycan structures produced by F. hepatica participate in the modulation of bone marrow-derived DCs (BMDCs) and induce/mediate the production of IL-10 and IL-4 during infection 32 . Moreover, mannose inhibition indicated that a mannose-specific receptor mediates the recognition of F. hepatica glycans by DCs 32 . More recently, the mannose receptor was found to mediate parasite tegumental glycan recognition by BMDCs 33, 34 , although further experiments suggested that also other mannose-specific CLRs are participating in F. hepatica modulation of DCs 34 . Last, a MR-dependent mechanism of inducing T cell anergy by DCs loaded with parasite tegumental molecules was reported 33 . Yet, molecular mechanisms associated to the modulation of human DC function by F. hepatica are scarce. \" Thus, we sought to evaluate whether F. hepatica glycoconjugates interact with DC-SIGN and whether this interaction regulates the stimulatory function of DCs by evaluating their capacity to induce regulatory or anergic T cells.",

In addition, these glycans induce regulatory monocyte-derived DCs (mo-DCs) via DC-SIGN that decrease allogeneic T cell proliferation, highlighting the role of DC-SIGN in the regulation of innate and adaptive immune responses by F. hepatica. Our data confirm the immunomodulatory properties of DC-SIGN triggered by F. hepatica-derived glycoconjugates and contribute to the deep understanding of the immunoregulation strategies by this helminth.",

To determine whether F. hepatica glycans modulate DC-mediated immune responses, we first evaluated whether a total preparation of parasite components (FhTE) can modulate the production of cytokines induced after a maturation stimulus by DCs. To this end, immature mo-DCs were cultured in the presence or absence of Pam3CSK4 or LPS and FhTE, and the production of different cytokines were evaluated in the culture medium. Although FhTE alone did not induce the expression of cytokines by mo-DCs, when cultured together with a maturation stimulus, it enhanced the production of IL-10 and IL-27p28 by mo-DCs ( Fig. 1A and B) . Interestingly, this enhanced production of IL-10 was abrogated when FhTE glycans were oxidized with meta-periodate (FhmPox), a common method used to evaluate the biological activity of glycans (Fig. 1C) 32 . These results indicate that F. hepatica glycoconjugates mediate the enhanced production of TLR-induced IL-10 and IL-27p28 by mo-DCs.",

Treatment of FhTE with any of these glycosidases inhibited DC-SIGN binding (40% inhibition), while treatment of FhTE with both fucosidase and mannosidase resulted in a 70% inhibition rate (Fig. 4D) , indicating that DC-SIGN interacts with both fucosylated and mannosylated parasite glycans.

In particular, we show that oligomannose glycans present on FhTE preparation enhance the TLR-induced production of IL-10 and IL-27p28. Although F. hepatica glycoconjugates were both recognized and internalized by MR and DC-SIGN on DCs, the observed immunomodulation of TLR-matured DCs was mediated only by DC-SIGN and not by MR, DCIR or MGL, suggesting a main role of this receptor in the DC-immunoregulatory properties induced by this helminth. DC-SIGN interacts with a wide range of pathogens of major impact on public health, including viruses 4-6 , bacteria 8, 30 and parasites [11] [12] [13] [14] via both fucose (for instance in Lewis and sulfo-Lewis structures) and high-mannose glycans in a Ca-dependent manner 39 . However, until now, DC-SIGN interaction with helminths was reported only via fucosylated glycans and not high-mannose structures 14, 40 . Oligomannose and paucimannose N-glycans present in FhTE could constitute ligands for DC-SIGN through mannose. Our results demonstrate the capacity of DC-SIGN to recognize mannosylated glycoconjugates on F. hepatica components, since the binding of DC-SIGN to FhTE was partially abolished after mannosidase treatment. In addition, we also confirm that DCs interact with helminth fucosylated-glycans via DC-SIGN. Considering that we did not identify potential fucosylated N-glycans that could serve as ligands for DC-SIGN, and together with the fact that defucosylation of FhTE reduces DC-SIGN recognition for parasite components, we propose that DC-SIGN fucosylated ligands are present in O-glycans or glycolipids. Of note, since FhTE is a total parasite lysate, it contains both external and internal glycoconjugates. Thus, to establish the role of DC-SIGN during F. hepatica infection, in vivo studies are necessary.",

Thus, DC-SIGN interacts with F. hepatica glycans and mediates the increased production of IL-10 and IL-27p28 by TLR-matured DCs. IL-10 is a key immune-regulatory cytokine that can impair the proliferation, cytokine production and migratory capacities of effector T cells 41 or induce T cell anergy 42 . On the other hand, IL-27 can both exert immuno-stimulatory or suppressive effects. Interestingly, IL-27 can induce IL-10 production and induce the differentiation of the IL-10-producing type 1 regulatory T (Tr1) cells 43 . In agreement with our results, fucose-induced triggering of DC-SIGN resulted in the induction of IL-27p28 expression and secretion by DCs, driving subsequent follicullar T helper polarization 7 . Furthermore, this type of phenotype on DCs is induced by other helminths, such as S. mansoni 1, 4, 44 , suggesting that fucosylated glycans present on FhTE would trigger DC-SIGN-signaling. In addition, our results indicate that DC-SIGN recognizes next to fucosylated glycans also mannosylated glycans, which can both be present in parasites, that may have a different functional consequence increasing IL-10 and T regs. Additional experiments are needed to determine whether both glycan moieties in F. hepatica glycans trigger different DC-SIGN signaling pathways.",

In particular, DC-SIGN can favor Th1/Th17, Th2, follicular T helper or regulatory T cell polarization 44 . To further understand whether F. hepatica-triggering of DC-SIGN on DCs can alter T cell activation, we evaluated whether TLR-matured DC conditioned with parasite components were able to limit T cell proliferation. Our results indicate that human DC-SIGN promotes a tolerogenic/regulatory state on DCs since F. hepatica-conditioned DCs induced regulatory mo-DCs via DC-SIGN that decrease allogeneic T cell proliferation by the induction of induction of T-cell tolerance. On the other hand, the interaction of myelin oligodendrocyte glycprotein (MOG) with DC-SIGN in the context of simultaneous TLR4 activation resulted in enhanced IL-10 secretion and decreased T cell proliferation 21 . Furthermore, H. pylori glycans that interact with DC-SIGN induced tolerogenic DCs that failed to induce T cell effector functions but induced regulatory T cells 45 . In the context of F. hepatica immunoregulatory properties, other CLRs can also participate in the induction of T cell anergy as has been recently proposed for the MR on bone marrow-derived DCs induced anergic-like T cells via DCs, although only a small reduction of T cell anergy was found when using DCs from knock-out mice, suggesting that other CLRs can participate in this process 33 . Furthermore, this process did not seem to be mediated by recognition of parasite glycoconjugates by the MR on BMDCs but the MR interacting with CD4 + T cells 33 . Thus, our work provides an additional mechanism of induction of T cell anergy induced by F. hepatica-conditioned DCs.",
