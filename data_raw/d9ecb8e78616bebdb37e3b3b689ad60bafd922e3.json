We have cloned, expressed, and purified a Strep-fused recombinant MERS-CoV nonstructural protein 13 (M-nsp13) helicase. Characterization of its biochemical properties showed that it unwound DNA and RNA similarly to severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV nsp13 (S-nsp13) helicase. We showed that M-nsp13 unwound in a 5=-to-3= direction and efficiently unwound the partially duplex RNA substrates with a long loading strand relative to those of the RNA substrates with a short or no loading strand. Moreover, the K m of ATP for M-nsp13 is inversely proportional to the length of the 5= loading strand of the partially duplex RNA substrates. Finally, we also showed that the rate of unwinding (ku) of M-nsp13 is directly proportional to the length of the 5= loading strand of the partially duplex RNA substrate. These results provide insights that enhance our understanding of the biochemical properties of M-nsp13.",

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a novel coronavirus discovered in 2012 and is responsible for acute respiratory syndrome in humans in the Middle East, Europe, North Africa, and the United States of America. Helicases are motor proteins that catalyze the processive separation of double-stranded nucleic acids into two single-stranded nucleic acids by utilizing the energy derived from ATP hydrolysis. MERS-CoV helicase is one of the most important viral replication enzymes of this coronavirus. Herein, we report the first bacterial expression, enzyme purification, and biochemical characterization of MERS-CoV helicase. The knowledge obtained from this study might be used to identify an inhibitor of MERS-CoV replication, and the helicase might be used as a therapeutic target.",

To determine whether nucleic acid unwinding by M-nsp13 depends on the loading strand length and to determine the minimum length of the 5= singlestranded overhang required for efficient helicase activity, we designed five partially duplex RNA substrates with single-stranded 5= ends of various lengths (between 0 and 20 bases) (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material; Fig. 6 ) but with dsRNA duplex regions of the same length. Using these substrates, we monitored the unwinding activity of M-nsp13 in the presence of 2 mM ATP. As shown in Fig. 6A , the efficiency of RNA unwinding by M-nsp13 increased as the length of the 5= loading strand increased. While M-nsp13 required a 5-to 20-nucleotide (nt) single-strand 5= overhang for efficient unwinding of the dsRNA substrate, M-nsp13 was still able to partially unwind (~10% to 30%) a dsRNA substrate with a 0-(blunt) to 2-nt 5= loading strand.",

NTP hydrolysis is known to provide the energy required for translocation of RNA helicases along ssRNA and duplex-RNA during unwinding. To determine whether ATP is required for the unwinding activities of M-nsp13, a standard unwinding assay was conducted with all the RNA substrates described above in the absence of ATP. As shown in Fig. 6B , while M-nsp13 was partially able to unwind the partially duplex RNA substrate with a 20-nt overhang (5=-RNA-20) in the absence of ATP, M-nsp13 could not unwind other RNA substrates with shorter loading strands. A recently identified human enterovirus helicase, nonstructural protein 2C ATPase , was shown to possess an ATP-independent RNA chaperone activity (24) . To investigate whether M-nsp13 has an underlying ability to unwind its substrate in an ATPindependent manner, M-nsp13_K288A (the control protein that lacks the ability to hydrolyze ATP) was incubated with the 5=-RNA-20 partially duplex substrate in the presence of 2 mM ATP. The results showed that M-nsp13_K288A could not unwind the 5=-RNA-20 partially duplex substrate, indicating that M-nsp13 does not have an ATPindependent RNA chaperone activity (Fig. 6C) . Overall, these results suggest that M-nsp13's ability to unwind the 5=-RNA-20 partially duplex substrate is likely due to residual cellular ATP purified with the helicase as well as to a long overhang length, which enhances M-nsp13's unwinding activity.",

We assessed the unwinding activity of M-nsp13 with the various 5=-RNA partially duplex substrates with different overhang lengths in the presence of various ATP concentrations from 0.25 to 5 mM. Using the Michaelis-Menten equation, the unwinding activities under different ATP concentrations were plotted as the fraction of the released RNA from the total RNA helix substrate at each ATP concentration. The results showed that increasing ATP concentrations up to~2 mM ATP apparently enhanced the helix unwinding of each RNA substrate (Fig. 7A) , after which no significant difference in substrate unwinding was noticeable. Moreover, M-nsp13 could not completely unwind the 5=-RNA-0 (blunt substrate), 5=-RNA-2 (2-nt overhang), and 5=-RNA-5 (5-nt overhang) partially duplex RNA substrates even at 5 mM ATP.

The change in the fractions of unwound ssRNA product with time is shown in Fig. 8 . The experimental data for the substrates were fit to the following equation: fraction (ssDNA) \u03ed A \u00b7 (1 -e -kt ) \u03e9 n, where A is the amplitude that corresponds to the maximum fraction of ssRNA that can be generated enzymatically from the substrates, k is the pseudo first-order rate constant of RNA unwinding, t is the reaction time, and n is an additive constant representing the amount of ssDNA present before the reaction started. The results showed that the amplitudes and the rates of RNA unwinding of M-nsp13 were directly proportional to the length of the 5= loading strand ( Table 2) .",

            "text": "Sequence alignment of M-nsp13 with other helicases suggests that the MERS-CoV helicase belongs to the SF1 family of helicases (29) . However, the biochemical aspects of the enzymatic mechanism of MERS-CoV nsp13, including ATP hydrolysis, translocation along the nucleic acid, and the unwinding rate, have not been studied. The present study fills this knowledge gap. One of the unique findings of this study is the observation that the length of the 5= loading strand of the partially duplex RNA can determine the amount of ATP required by the helicase for optimal helix unwinding. The longer the length of the loading strand, the lower the amount of ATP required for optimal unwinding. As noted in Fig. 6B , M-nsp13 was able to partially unwind the substrate with the longest 5= loading strand without inclusion of ATP in the reaction mixture. A recently characterized human enterovirus helicase, nonstructural protein 2C ATPase , was shown to possess an ATPindependent RNA chaperone activity (24) . The RNA chaperone activity was observed along the 3=-to-5= direction in the absence of ATP. Given the presence of an ssRNA product in the absence of ATP, when M-nsp13 was incubated with the 5=-RNA-20 partially duplex RNA substrate, we wanted to confirm a possible RNA chaperone activity by M-nsp13. As shown in Fig. 6C , M-nsp13_K288A (the control protein that lacks the ability to hydrolyze ATP) did not unwind either substrate, thereby ruling out an RNA chaperone activity by M-nsp13. The small amount of the ssRNA product observed with the 5=-RNA-20 partially duplex RNA substrate in the absence of ATP may be due to residual cellular ATP purified with the helicase as well as the longer overhang length of 5=-RNA-20 substrate relative to other substrates that enhances M-nsp13 unwinding activity.",

The 5=-to-3= helicase activity of M-nsp13 may be similar to what was previously proposed for SARS-CoV (31) . It was suggested that SARS-CoV nsp12 and nsp13 may work together to carry out one of the replication complex functions, i.e., synthesis of subgenomic transcripts containing the leader sequence derived from the 5= end of the genome (29, 30) . To achieve this, nsp12 would have to transcribe RNA in a 3=-to-5= template direction, followed by pausing at transcription regulatory element sites. Such pauses may activate motion in the opposite direction, allowing nsp13 (aided by nsp12 and possibly other viral and host proteins) to unwind the 3= end of the nascent RNA primer and facilitate transfer to the complementary region of the 5= leader genomic sequence.",

Other RNA virus helicase-associated NTPase activities were also shown to lack any noticeable specificity for specific nucleotides (30, 35, (39) (40) (41) . This may suggest that the lack of selectivity for specific nucleotide cofactors is a general feature of RNA virus helicases.

Briefly, the pET-28a-FMDV 3Dpol plasmid was transformed into the Rosetta 2 expression strain (Novagen). Kanamycin-resistant colonies were grown at 37\u00b0C, and protein expression was induced at an A 600 of 0.9 to 1.0 by the addition of 1 mM isopropyl \u2424-D-1thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). The cells were allowed to grow for 3 more h after induction. The cells were harvested by centrifugation (4,500 \u03eb g, 20 min) and stored at \u03ea20\u00b0C. Frozen cell pellets were resuspended in buffer A (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, and 5% glycerol). The protein was purified by nickel affinity chromatography with a gradient of 25 mM to 500 mM imidazole in buffer A. Fractions containing pure protein (95%) were pooled and dialyzed against the storage buffer containing 12.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, and 50% glycerol.",

Helicase activity was measured by incubating 20 nM M-nsp13 with a 5 nM concentration of an RNA substrate (Fig. S1 ) in a reaction buffer containing 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 20 mM NaCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA), 5 mM MgCl 2 , and 2 mM ATP at 30\u00b0C for various times. Reactions were quenched by the addition of an equal volume of loading buffer (0.2% SDS and 20% glycerol). Unless otherwise mentioned, reactant concentrations refer to the final concentration in the reaction mixture. The released single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) product and unwound double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) were resolved by 8% nondenaturing PAGE using a running buffer containing 89 mM Tris-borate, pH 8.2, and run for 45 min at 4\u00b0C and 110 V. The controls for measuring maximum unwinding were dsRNAs denatured by heat for 5 min at 95\u00b0C and loaded immediately on the gel. In this and subsequent assays, the gels were scanned with a Bio-Rad multipurpose imager. When necessary, the band intensities representing ssRNA and dsRNA were quantitated using the Image Lab 5.1 software (Bio-Rad). The fraction of unwound RNA was plotted against time, and the kinetic parameters described in the mechanism were determined by nonlinear regression using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Inc.).",
