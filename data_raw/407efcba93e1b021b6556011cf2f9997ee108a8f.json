We aimed to study factors associated with delay before registration at country level among registered migrant TB patients in China (2014-15) who were transferred out (during treatment) through web-based TB information management system (TBIMS). Methods: This was a cross sectional study involving review of TBIMS data. Delays (in days) were classified as follows: patient delay (from symptom onset to first doctor visit), health system delay (from first doctor visit to treatment initiation, divided into health system diagnosis and treatment delay before and after date of diagnosis respectively), diagnosis delay (from symptom onset to diagnosis) and total delay (from symptom onset to treatment initiation). Linear regression was used to build a predictive model (forward stepwise) for the socio-demographic, clinical and health system related factors associated with delay: one model for each type of delay. Delays were log transformed and included in the model.",

TB diagnostic facilities are centralized at the county level and rarely also available at township level (below county). At BMUs, diagnosed patients are registered and initiated on directly observed therapy-short course (DOTS). They are assisted by township clinics and village health workers. Anti-tuberculosis drugs and needful examinations are provided without charge. Similar to a BMU, some regional referral hospitals also take patient management responsibility and register patients. Unlike in BMUs, the drugs and examinations are usually not free in referral hospitals. The payment could be reimbursed by social insurances but migrant population often have many barriers to get reimbursed [26] .",

The median total delay (22 days) and patient delay (16 days) were quite shorter compared to studies in other high TB burden countries [28, 30] . Migrant TB patients received proper diagnosis and management within very short duration of having any symptom of TB and almost immediately after visiting a health facility in China [31] as other general populations [32] . We speculate that this was due to four important reasons. Firstly, most destinations of migration were urban areas and had obviously better universal health coverage [6, 7] . We did not adjust for this factor (urban/rural) in our analysis. Secondly, it might be related to the annual health examination (including TB) especially among people working at industries or companies where people migrated and worked, having high chance of early diagnosis and treatment [33, 34] . Thirdly, patients probably benefitted from the publicpublic mix collaboration among different public health providers and TB designated facilities which was implemented after severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic [35] . Fourth, there were very few private practitioners in China, most health providers were public hospitals. According to national law and regulation of infectious diseases control, all health facilities must report TB cases within 24 h after diagnosis and refer them to programme BMUs since 2004 [36, 37] . BMUs must trace these referred patients with TB and get them involved in programme management [22] . These mandatory requirements possibly shortened the health system diagnosis delay compared to historical studies before in China [38, 39] . On the other hand, providing free anti-tuberculosis drugs by programme BMUs reduced the health system treatment delay [22] , which was also relatively shorter than most other low-middle income countries [4, 13, 40] , while similar as in South Africa [41] .",

It may be because patient delay contributed to most of the diagnosis and total delay. Female migrant TB patients being associated with delays has also been reported elsewhere/before in China, India, and Asia [11, 12, 29] . Females might prefer selftreatment using home remedies to treat their TB like symptoms at home which might lead to delay in seeking care. Compared with pleurisy, patients with sputum smear positive were associated with delay. It might be that TB symptoms were relatively more severe among pleurisy patients [42] . This study also found that patients with 15-44 years of age were less likely to have delays than older age group. This finding contradicts with the finding from India where patients < 45 years of age were at higher risk for delay [43] . Patients who were registered by referral hospitals had longer delay when compared to programme BMUs. This could be explained by the fact that patients visited referral hospital after visiting other public facilities or after becoming sick.",

Migrant populations were less likely to be covered by social insurance, which not only caused delays due to their health seeking behaviors, but also led to high risk of transfer-out during the treatment (programme records). In order to change this situation, firstly migrant population needs to be treated equally under universal health coverage. Providing subsidies to migrant patients with TB could effectively encourage them visit doctors and reduce the patient delay, and ensure them stay in the diagnosed place to complete treatment [46, 47] .",
