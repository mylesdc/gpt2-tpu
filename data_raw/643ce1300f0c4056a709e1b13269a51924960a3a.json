Liu et al. [12] reported the effects of ribavirin (1-\u03b2-D-ribofuranosyl-1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxamide), a guanosine analogue with broad antiviral activities [13] , in the treatment of a total of 311 patients, roughly half of whom did not receive ribavirin. In that study, the daily intravenous injection of 500 mg of ribavirin did not significantly affect the case fatality rate or platelet counts and viral load in blood [12] , indicating that ribavirin is not effective against SFTS at that dose. However, ribavirin apparently shows an anti-SFTS virus effect in vitro [14] . Thus, a higher dose of ribavirin or a different drug/strategy is likely to be necessary in the treatment of SFTS.",

Although statistically significant inhibitory effects were observed at 50-5,000 U/ml for IFN\u03b1 and \u03b2 and 20-2,000 ng/ml for IFN\u03b3, the reduction of viral titers by IFN\u03b3 was lower than that by IFN\u03b1 and \u03b2, especially at higher concentrations ( Fig. 1a, b, c) . Reduction curves were used to calculate 90 % and 99 % effective concentrations (EC 90 and EC 99 ), the drug concentrations at which viral titers were 1 and 2 log-reduced, respectively. The EC 90 values of IFN\u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3 were 29 U/ml, 24 U/ml, and 12 ng/ml, respectively. The EC 99 values of IFN\u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3 were 210 U/ml, 160 U/ml, and >2,000 ng/ml, respectively. Cytotoxicity was examined by measuring cell viability after cell culture in the presence of drugs without virus inoculation. As shown in Fig. 1 , >70 % viability was maintained at all examined concentrations of IFN\u03b1 and \u03b2 (Fig. 1a, b) , while at 200 and 2,000 ng/ml of IFN\u03b3, cell viability was reduced to 60 % (Fig. 1c) . These findings indicate, with the exception of high concentrations of IFN\u03b3 (200 and 2,000 ng/ml), the reduced titers of SFTS virus in the presence of IFNs (Fig. 1 ).",

The combination effects of each of the IFNs with ribavirin Results are means \u00b1 standard deviation obtained from three independent experiments (n = 3). To measure cytotoxicity of IFNs, viability of Vero cells cultured in the presence of IFN\u03b1 a, \u03b2 b, or \u03b3 c was measured by use of WST-1 reagent. Cell viability was calculated as follows: (absorbance of cells in the presence of the drugabsorbance of no cells in the presence of the drug) / (absorbance of cells in the absence of the drugabsorbance of no cells in the absence of the drug) \u00d7 100 (%). Experiments were performed in triplicate and means \u00b1 standard deviation (n = 3) which are shown in red. Effects and cytotoxicity of ribavirin d were calculated from the data reported previously [14] to make comparison with those of IFNs easy. Statistical analysis (unpaired t-test in comparison with data from no drug) was performed only for data from anti-SFTS virus effects of IFNs and ribavirin. *,P < 0.05; **,P < 0.01 were examined at concentrations of their respective EC 90 values. At the same time, the single effects of each drug were also examined (Fig. 2a) . As expected, when used alone, each drug showed a nearly 1-log reduction of viral titer at its EC 90 (IFN\u03b1, 0.75 log; IFN\u03b2, 0.58 log; IFN\u03b3, 0.83 log; and ribavirin, 1.0 log). Viral titers were greatly reduced by the combined usage of IFN\u03b1-ribavirin (3.6 log), IFN\u03b2ribavirin (3.2 log), and IFN\u03b3-ribavirin (3.4 log). Differences between the effects of the combined usage and those of the single usage were statistically significant (P < 0.01, unpaired t-test). The combination effects in the reduction of viral titers were also examined among the three IFNs (\u03b1-\u03b2, 1.0 log; \u03b1-\u03b3, 2.2 log; and \u03b2-\u03b3, 2.5 log). The results of triple or quadruple combinations of IFNs and ribavirin, which showed greater inhibitory effects on SFTS virus infection than single-or double-combination-usage of the drugs, are indicated in Fig. 2a .",

            "text": "In the present study, the single usage of ribavirin [14] or IFN was shown to significantly reduce the growth of the SFTS virus. Furthermore, it was shown that the combined usage of these drugs at low dosages resulted in large inhibitory effects in vitro. When used singularly, for example, approximately 123 \u03bcg/ml of ribavirin [14] , 500 U/ml of IFN\u03b1, 500 U/ml of IFN\u03b2, or more than 2 \u03bcg/ ml of IFN\u03b3 was necessary to achieve a 3-log reduction of viral growth. In contrast, a combination of 43 \u03bcg/ml of ribavirin and either 29 U/ml of IFN\u03b1, 24 U/ml of IFN\u03b2, or 12 ng/ml of IFN\u03b3 resulted in a >3-log reduction of viral growth. A ribavirin concentration of 43 \u03bcg/ml in blood might not be achievable in humans, because the drug reaches a peak serum concentration of 39 \u03bcg/ml with doses as high as 2,400 mg injected intravenously [23] . However, in the present study, we used Vero cells, in which higher concentrations of ribavirin are required to inhibit the growth of SFTS virus (and many other viruses) [14] , than in other cell types [24, 25] , probably due to insufficient phosphorylation of ribavirin to its active triphosphate form in the cell line [26] . Therefore, the administration of high ribavirin doses such as 2,400 mg might show large inhibitory effects against SFTS virus when combined with IFNs. Although the IFNs used in the present study were research-use-only, a concentration of 100-750 U/ ml has been observed after the intravenous injection of 3 \u00d7 10 7 U of human-use-approved IFNs [27, 28] , which Fig 1. Concentrations of the drugs used were ribavirin 43 \u03bcg/ml, IFN\u03b1 29 U/ml, IFN\u03b2 24 U/ml, and IFN\u03b3 12 ng/ml, EC 90 of each drug in the inhibition of SFTS virus infection. Experiments were performed in triplicate and means \u00b1 standard deviation are shown (n = 3). *,P < 0.05; **,P < 0.01 (unpaired t-test in comparison with data from no drug) are more than 3 times higher than the IFN concentrations required to reach the EC 90 of the SFTS virus in vitro. Thus, the combined usage of ribavirin and IFNs at acceptable dosages might result in a large reduction of SFTS virus infection in vivo and could therefore be an effective therapy for the treatment of SFTS patients. Because SFTS virus has been shown to suppress cellular IFN responses [29, 30] , the treatment of patients with drugs including IFNs perhaps should be initiated soon after diagnosis of SFTS is done.",

However, such small combination effects among the IFNs had been expected due to the following reasons: (i) although precise mechanism (s) by which ribavirin affects SFTS virus replication is unclear, ribavirin and IFNs likely work independently of each other [13] ; (ii) IFN\u03b1 and \u03b2 are type-I IFNs and completely share the receptors that transduce intracellular signals; and (iii) IFN\u03b3 is a type-II IFN and partially shares molecules for signal transduction with type-I IFNs [31] . The results, however, strongly suggest that drugs which inhibit SFTS virus proliferation by mechanisms different to those of IFNs/ribavirin could be candidate drugs to be used in combination with IFNs/ribavirin in the treatment of SFTS patients. Further studies may elucidate SFTS virus-specific inhibitors and/or neutralizing antibodies [32] for SFTS therapy.",
