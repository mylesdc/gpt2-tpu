However, growth of live-virus vaccines must be attenuated to minimize their potential pathogenic effects, and mechanisms of attenuation by conventional serialtransfer viral adaptation are not well-understood. New methods of attenuation based on rational engineering of viral genomes may offer a potentially greater control if one can link defined genetic modifications to changes in virus growth. To begin to establish such links between genotype and growth phenotype, we developed a computer model for the intracellular growth of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), a well-studied, nonsegmented, negative-stranded RNA virus. Our model incorporated established regulatory mechanisms of VSV while integrating key wild-type infection steps: hijacking of host resources, transcription, translation, and replication, followed by assembly and release of progeny VSV particles. Generalization of the wild-type model to allow for genome rearrangements matched the experimentally observed attenuation ranking for recombinant VSV strains that altered the genome position of their nucleocapsid gene. Finally, our simulations captured previously reported experimental results showing how altering the positions of other VSV genes has the potential to attenuate the VSV growth while overexpressing the immunogenic VSV surface glycoprotein. Such models will facilitate the engineering of new live-virus vaccines by linking genomic manipulations to controlled changes in virus gene-expression and growth.",

For example, 40 million, 350 million, and 170 million people in the world are carrying human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and hepatitis C virus (HCV), respectively [1] [2] [3] . Annually 5% to 15% of the global population is infected with influenza, resulting in 250,000 to 500,000 deaths [4] . Protection against viral infections may be provided by inoculations with live-virus, killed-virus, or subunit vaccines. Live-virus vaccines offer advantages because they activate both humoral and cellmediated immunity, require only a single boosting, and generally provide longer immune protection than other forms of vaccines. However, they must be adequately attenuated in their growth to minimize the possibility of vaccine-induced pathogenic effects while retaining their immunogenicity. Attenuation of live viruses has traditionally been achieved by serially passaging viruses in tissue or cell culture and adapting them to grow well on new cell types or at elevated or reduced temperatures [5] , a process that tends to reduce their replicative ability and virulence in humans or animals [6] . Such attenuation has historically been a highly empirical process, where its mechanisms are often neither known nor elucidated.",

            "text": "During the last decade the emergence of reverse genetics techniques has created unprecedented opportunities to better control viral attenuation [7] [8] [9] . Reverse genetics enables the production of RNA viruses from cloned cDNA, so specific mutations can be relatively easily introduced into viruses. The challenge to engineering viruses for attenuation then shifts from creating the variants to predicting how specific genetic changes define or correlate with measurable effects on virus growth. Such a challenge can be addressed through the development of quantitative and mechanistic models that map genome-level changes to the dynamics of virus growth under different environmental conditions. Models of intracellular virus growth aim to predict how rapidly a virus-infected cell will produce virus progeny. Inputs to such models include rates of constituent processes such as entry of the virus into the cell, transcription of viral mRNAs, translation of viral proteins, replication of viral genomes, assembly of intermediates, and finally, production and release of viral progeny. Decades of detailed biochemical, biophysical, and genetic studies have, for diverse viruses, contributed toward a level of mechanistic understanding of viral functions and interactions. Various intracellular models of virus growth have been developed for phage Qb [10] , phage T7 [11, 12] , HIV-1 [13] , and influenza A virus [14] .",

            "text": "How can a detailed model for the intracellular growth of a virus be used to explore the behavior of mutant viruses that encode alternative designs? As a starting point, one can create alternative designs that reorder or rearrange the wildtype genes or regulatory elements. Such genomic changes can alter the timing and level of expression of different viral genes, and thereby impact growth because the production of viral progeny depends on the dynamic expression of viral genes. Preliminary models of such alternative genome designs can use the ''language'' of the wild-type virus. They retain the parameters that characterize wild-type molecular interactions, wild-type average rates of viral polymerase elongation, and wild-type composition of progeny viruses, but they apply them in a manner that reflects the reordering of wild-type components in the engineered genome. For example, the timing of expression for the genes of phage T7 during infection maps closely to their sequential order on the T7 genome [15, 16] . By relocating an essential early gene, encoding the T7 RNA polymerase to downstream positions, one delays initiation of transcription by the highly efficient T7 RNA polymerase and thereby attenuates phage growth [17] . Preliminary models for the growth of phage carrying the altered genomes, based on wild-type parameters, capture the overall observed trends in attenuation. Here we expand this approach to a mammalian virus of biomedical and agricultural relevance: vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV).",

The relative production level of each protein matched the relative availability of the corresponding mRNAs ( Figure 1B ) even though different proteins degrade at different rates ( Table 1 ). Because of the different level of incorporation of each protein into a single virion particle, as defined by the protein stoichiometry (Table 2 , [28, 29] ), the relative levels of free viral proteins in the cytoplasm develop differently from their mRNA levels ( Figure 1C ). P protein is most abundant owing to its low content in the virion, and L and N proteins are least abundant. The persistently low level of N protein is related to its immediate complexation with nascent genomes and antigenomes to make nucleocapsid particles during the replication step. Owing to the cyclic switching between transcription and replication by the encapsidation process, the N protein level is predicted to oscillate as shown in Figure 1C .",

Anti-genome templates are only utilized to amplify genomes, while genome templates are used to amplify both anti-genomes and mRNAs, and they are also incorporated into virion progeny particles. The higher demands for genome by these multiple tasks are satisfied by the stronger promoter of the anti-genome template compared with that of the genome template [30] [31] [32] . More polymerases bind to the stronger promoter of the anti-genome, ultimately enhancing the production of genomes over anti-genomes ( Figure 2 ). In our model the parameter S prom measures the strength of the anti-genomic promoter relative to that of the genomic promoter ( Table 1 ). The production ratio of genomes to anti-genomes was estimated to be dynamically changed [33] , varying from one to 30 (wild-type VSV case (S prom \u00bc 5.4), Figure S1 ). Such oscillatory changes in the production ratio shown in Figure S1 follow from the on-off use of the genomes for transcription or replication. They also arise owing to the staggered shifting of dominant templates between genomes and anti-genomes during replication. A large value of S prom favors use of anti-genome templates to replicate genomes. However, as genome templates accumulate in large excess relative to anti-genome templates, they successfully compete for replication resources. Synthesis of anti-genomes then dominates until they accumulate and serve again as the dominant templates.",

DOI: 10.1371/journal.pcbi/0020116.t001 detrimental for growth. For excessively large S cond , newly synthesized genomic nucleocapsids would tend to be prematurely incorporated into virion particles before they could serve as templates for transcription and replication. On the other hand, for extremely small S cond , genomic nucleocapsids would be utilized primarily to produce viral RNA without being packaged into viral progeny. Hence, an intermediate parameter value is expected to be optimal for viral growth. We estimated a possible range for the wild-type value of S cond by fitting our simulation results to previous experimental observations by others (2.5 3 10 \u00c05 to 1.0 3 10 \u00c04 , Figure S4 ). Our simulations further indicate that this range of S cond is near-optimal and optimal for VSV growth on BHK and DBT cells, respectively (unpublished data). Diversion and inhibition of host translation machinery create a time window of opportunity for translation of viral proteins. During the infection cycle, virus actively and passively competes with the host for limited translation resources by inhibiting host transcription and by amplifying viral mRNAs, respectively. Viral leader-mRNA and M protein play key roles in this inhibition [19, 28, [34] [35] [36] . As viral components accumulate in the cytoplasm from the initiation of infection, an ever-increasing fraction of host ribosomes are available for viral mRNAs ( Figure 3A , the fraction of ribosomes associated with viral mRNAs is defined by 1-rib_host in Equation 26 ). However, the inhibition of host macromolecular synthesis causes a failure to supply accessory factors needed for initiation and elongation steps of translation, resulting in a reduction in the fraction of active ribosomes over time ( Figure 3A , as described by f dec in Equation 25 ). These two mechanisms create a time window when active ribosomes are maximally available for viral translation in infected cells ( Figure 3A , refer to the term (1-rib_host)*f dec in Equation 27 ). The abundance of viral mRNAs and the limitation imposed by ribosomal spacing determine the fraction of the active ribosomes involved in translating viral mRNAs (occupied ribosomes in Figure 3B , refer to Equations 11 and 27) . In our model, if the occupied active ribosomes are less than the available ones (in this case the number of free active ribosomes . 0), viral translation is fully supported without any limitation of host machinery. In the early infection stages up to 7 h and 13 h post-infection for BHK and DBT cells, respectively, the host machinery is in excess ( Figure 3B ). However, at later times viral translation becomes limited by the host resources (in this case the number of free active ribosomes \u00bc 0). This limitation may cause a transition from replication-dominant to assembly-dominant infection stages because the replication requires the continuous protein synthesis. As shown in Figure 3B , a small fraction of ribosomes as active forms (less than 5% out of 5 3 10 6 ribosomes, Table 1 ) are utilized for viral translation. Experiments and simulations of VSV gene-order mutants. For vaccine applications, one seeks to minimize viral pathogenicity and maximize its immunogenicity. Based on observed correlations between in vitro and in vivo results, we assume here that the pathogenicity and the immunogenicity of a virus are directly linked to the levels of progeny production [20, 37, 38] and G protein expression in infected cells [39, 40] , respectively. In the previous section we have showed that various VSV regulatory mechanisms are involved in maintaining balances, during infection, among viral synthesis processes, which indirectly indicates the importance of such balances for viral growth. Perturbations of such balances by genetic or genomic manipulations could provide ways to obtain viral phenotypes favorable to vaccine applications. We first test the predictive ability of our model by comparing simulated protein expression and growth of several gene-rearranged VSV strains with experimental results. Later we employ the model to predict how various genomic manipulations could attenuate virus growth and increase G protein expression.",

            "text": "Protein expression rates of gene-rearranged viruses. The stepwise decline in the transcription of genes more distant from the 39-end region promoter highlights how gene order affects gene expression in VSV. Advances in reverse genetics have made it possible to create gene-rearranged virus strains where the transcriptional attenuation mechanism then creates altered levels of gene expression [7, 9, 18, 20] . In one study [18] the three internal genes, P, M, and G, were permuted, and the resulting six possible VSV strains were characterized. Relative rates of viral protein expression in BHK cells were experimentally measured based on their incorporation of [ 35 S]-labeled methionine for a one-hour window at 4 h post-infection [18] . We extended our model to simulate this experiment for mutants representing each geneorder permutation and compared the model prediction with the published results [18] , as shown in Figure 4 . All rates are expressed relative to the synthesis rate of N protein, whose corresponding gene was in position 1, closest to the 39 end of the genome in all strain cases. Expression of gene L, in position 5, was minimal in both simulations and experiments, and the expression of all other genes was above 40%, a feature of the experimental data that the simulation also captured. Most of the points fall close to the parity line, indicating agreement between the simulation and experiment. Noteworthy are two subsets of points. First, the four circled points are exceptions to the general rule that gene order determines the level of gene expression. These were genes in the second position of the genomes that were expressed essentially at the same rate as gene N, in the first position [18] . This result highlights that the expression rate of protein is affected not only by its gene order, or corresponding rate of mRNA production, but also by its length and degradation rate. For a fixed average rate of translational elongation, longer gene products will tend to be produced more slowly. Further, the net rate of protein production will reflect the rates of both protein synthesis and protein degradation. The model accounts for these contributions, and for the circled genes such accounting appears to capture unexpected high translation levels of genes in the second position, which were measured by Ball et al. [18] . The second sets of points, shown in two boxes, indicate mismatches ( Figure 4 ) that, in the most challenging scenario, could reflect unknown strain-specific mechanisms that are not present in our general gene-permutation model. However, one should also note that the experiment is based on labeling and quantifying proteins about 4 h post-infection. This relatively early time point allows one to minimize potentially confounding influences of virion particle assembly and production on cytoplasmic levels of viral proteins, but it also represents a point before the majority of viral proteins have been made ( Figure 1B) .",

We also employed our model to predict the growth of VSV strains having the N gene first position on the genome grows best, followed by N2, N3, and N4. This result is consistent with the previously suggested hypothesis that relocation of the N gene to 39-distal positions on the genome would be an efficient way to attenuate VSV for vaccine use [20] . The reduction in growth that follows from moving the N gene likely reflects, at least in part, an imbalance between replication and transcription. Insufficient production of N protein would reduce the extent of encapsidation of nascent anti-genome and thereby allow transcription to dominate over genome replication [41] . While the simulation matches the growth ranking, it did not quantitatively match the experimental data. The predicted variation in virion production (N1 ! N4: 4.7-fold decrease) is smaller than the experimentally observed variation (N1 ! N4: 16.7-fold decrease). A potential source of this quantitative difference was our neglect of mass action effects of N proteins on the encapsidation process in our model; encapsidation was simulated as an instantaneous process when free N proteins were available. As shown above, our model could capture the major effects of gene rearrangement on viral growth and protein expression.",

The genome and anti-genome of VSV are synthesized in unequal amounts, determined by the differing strengths of their promoters [19, 31, 33, 39] . The stronger promoter of the antigenome allows viral polymerases to produce more genomes to meet their demands as components of virion particles and as templates for transcription and replication. To explore how VSV growth is influenced by differences in the relative strength of the genomic and anti-genomic promoters, we predicted the yield of virus on BHK and DBT cells over a broad range of S prom , as shown in Figure 6A . Small S prom virus cannot grow well because most polymerases would be associated with genomes and tend to synthesize primarily anti-genomes. For example, for S prom equal to 0.1, infected BHK and DBT cells make 5-fold and 26-fold fewer progeny than wild-type VSV infected cells, respectively. However, large S prom virus also cannot grow well because most polymerases would preferentially bind to newly synthesized anti-genomes, producing few of the anti-genomes that are needed as templates to amplify genomes. Our simulations predicted that values of 30 and 50 for S prom would be optimal for VSV growth in BHK and DBT cells, respectively ( Figure 6A ). The estimated wild-type value of S prom of 5.4 gives VSV yields higher than 80% of their maximum yields for both cell types ( Figure 6A) .",

This is a computationally simple task, but experimentally nontrivial. For example, the VSV N4 with S prom \u00bc 0.1 produced a simulated 38-fold fewer virus progeny than wild-type in BHK Figure 6B ). It is interesting to note that this 38-fold degree of growth attenuation is greater than the product of the constituent attenuations (4.7 3 5.4 \u00bc 25) that one calculates by assuming that the effects were uncoupled.

To elicit a systematic immune response, live viral vaccines must present or display neutralizing epitopes, typically through the expression of viral surface proteins. Higher levels of antigen expression have been found to correlate with more rapid and potent induction of anti-viral antibodies [39, 40] . As Flanagan et al. suggested, the gene encoding G may be moved to other positions in the VSV genome to modulate the expression of the VSV surface glycoprotein G [39] . We generated in silico five gene-shuffled VSV strains, having gene orders for the three internal genes, MPG, MGP, PGM, GMP, and GPM, and simulated levels of G protein in BHK cells infected with those strains. Our simulation results were consistent with the idea that the location of G gene affects the production of G protein. The GPM strain gave the highest concentration of G protein in the cytoplasm (almost 2-fold higher than that of wild-type, Figure 7 ). However, in many cases effects of such gene rearrangements can be difficult to anticipate because of the complexity of the involved interactions among viral components. For example, the PGM strain showed only a level of G protein expression similar to those of PMG (wt) and MPG strains even though it has the G gene at an earlier position than the other two strains (Figure 7) .",

Toward such favorable features, Flanagan et al. previously constructed three VSV strains having the following gene orders: 39-G-N-P-M-L-59 (G1N2), 39P-M-G-N-L-59 (G3N4), and 39-G-P-M-N-L-59 (G1N4) [39] . These genome constructions were based on their intuitive idea that translocations of G gene and N gene to earlier and later positions, respectively, compared with wild-type, could not only increase the expression of G protein, but also attenuate virus growth [39] .

The viral growth and the level of G protein in infected BHK cells mainly depend on the locations of N gene and G gene, respectively ( Figure 8A and 8B) , which is consistent with the experimental results of Flanagan et al. [39] . Further, if gene G is fixed, then moving gene N closer to the 39 promoter is predicted to increase protein G expression ( Figure 8B ). Consistent with this prediction, Flanagan et al. also observed a higher G protein expression for the G1N2 strain than for the G1N4 strain [39] . Enhanced replicative ability of VSV strain by locating its N gene at an earlier position in its genome can contribute to increasing the level of G protein. If either gene N or gene G is located at the fifth position, then both levels of virus growth and G protein expression are very low (Figure 8) , because with such genome organizations the stoichiometric amounts of N and G proteins required for replication and assembly (Table 2 , [28, 29] ) cannot be reached. Our simulations with the BHK cell parameters (Table 1 ) overall captured the experimentally established relative growth of the VSV strains in BHK-21 cells, but the growth of the G3N4 strain was significantly overestimated compared with the experimental results [39] ( Table 3 ). The relevant mechanism for such a large discrepancy between the simulation and the experimental results remains to be elucidated.",

Mathematical models for intracellular virus growth can support this design process by providing a tool to systematically analyze the viral infection regulatory network, identify critical regulatory mechanisms or components for redirecting viral phenotypes, and reverse engineer desirable phenotypes. One-step infection of cell monolayers. Cells were harvested, resuspended in growth medium, and plated into six-well plates at a concentration of 5 3 10 5 cells per 2 ml per well. Plated cells were returned to the incubator and allowed to grow overnight. The next day, two representative cell monolayers were harvested and counted to give an approximate number of cells per well.

The plates were rocked gently every 20 min. At the end of the adsorption period, the inoculum was removed from each monolayer sample and then replaced with 2 ml of agar overlay. The agar overlay consisted of 0.6% weight/volume (w/v) agar (Agar Nobel, Difco, BD Diagnostic Systems, http://www.bd.com). 5-Bromo-29-deoxyuridine (B5002, Sigma) was added, at 100 lg/ml, to the agar overlay of N3-and N4-infected samples to enhance plaque formation. Following agar addition, the plates were allowed to cool at room temperature for 30 min, returned to the incubator and incubated for 24 h, and then each sample was fixed with 2 ml of fixative for 3 h at room temperature. The fixative consisted of 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde (VWR) and 5% (w/v) sucrose (Sigma) in 10 mM phosphate buffered saline (PBS, Sigma) of pH 7.4.

Model development. Using algebraic and differential forms of equations, our mathematical model aims to account for established molecular processing steps in the development of VSV. Most model parameters were extracted from the literature. However, five parameters were obtained by fitting our simulation results to experimental data that were from the literature and our own experiments. Key model parameters are given in Table 1 , and detailed descriptions of the model and parameter estimation process are provided below, and in Protocol S1 and Figures S2 and S3 , respectively.",

Following the release of the encapsidated genome and proteins into the cytoplasm, VSV transcription is initiated. The viral transcription was assumed to be independent of host-cell functions such as replication [33] . Instead, the viral complex of L and P proteins, with a stoichiometry of 1-3.6, was taken to function as polymerase in transcription and replication [49] . In the absence of P protein, L protein cannot bind to the genome or anti-genome [50] . After binding to the 39 promoter regions of the genomic and anti-genomic templates, the viral polymerase starts to synthesize its own RNA transcription and replication products by elongating along the templates. During transcription a fraction of elongating polymerases terminate transcription by dissociating from the templates as they encounter regulatory signals at intergenic regions [19, 26] . In addition to the regulated polymerase dissociation, time-dependent concentration changes of the polymerases and the viral templates in the cytoplasm influence the distribution of polymerases on the viral templates during transcription and replication. Hence, the distribution of polymerases continuously varies over the viral templates, ultimately determining the relative synthesis levels of mRNAs and genome-size RNAs.",

For the genome template that is used for transcription as well as for replication, we specially grouped the segments into five genes ( Figure 9B ). We chose 40 as a minimum number for total segments which allows each gene to be split into a specific integer number of segments, proportional to the length of the gene. By considering the mechanisms for the interactions between polymerase and the intergenic regulatory sequences of the templates, as described below in the Transcription section, we simulated the polymerase flux into each segment over the time elapsed from the initiation of transcription on each template. Then we correlated the level of polymerase occupying each geneencoding section of the template with the synthesis rate of each corresponding viral mRNA. In a similar way, the distribution of polymerases on the replication templates was correlated with the synthesis rate of viral genome-sized RNA. Such explicit treatment of polymerase spatial distributions on the viral genome and antigenome templates was central to modeling the growth of wild-type and gene-rearranged virus strains. This treatment systematically accounts for polymerization-associated time delays and the polymerase fluxes into each template segment.",

The genome segments are continuously charged with incoming polymerases and discharged with outgoing polymerases with a rate of k e,pol (Equations 7-9). If the polymerase input to the leader region of the genome is decreased owing to a lack of free polymerases, then the polymerase concentrations downstream of the leader region will be subsequently reduced ( Figure 9C ). There are conserved intergenic sequences involved in letting a fraction of viral polymerases release from the genome template at intergenic sections during transcription, which is so-called partial transcription termination or attenuation ( Figure 9C ) [18, 19] . Because the transcription is initiated from the 39 end promoter, the attenuation mechanism causes genes more proximal to the 39 end to be more highly expressed, which ultimately leads to an unequal concentration distribution of viral mRNAs. The extents of partial transcription termination are quantified by the attenuation factors, / i , in our model ( Figure 9C ). These are 0/0.25/0.25/0.25/0.05 for leader-N/N-P/ P-M/M-G/G-L intergenic regions, respectively [18, 19, 26, 27] . / i fraction of polymerases are released at intergenic region i.

Two main viral products, leader-mRNA and M protein, contribute to the deficiency by inhibiting the synthesis of host macromolecules at the transcription level [19, 28, 35, 36] . Because leader-mRNA starts to accumulate soon after the initiation of infection, and a small amount of the component is enough to trigger the inhibition [28, 35] , the pool of host factors is continuously reduced from the onset of infection. We quantify this reduction with a single decay rate constant specific to the type of host cell:",

The inhibition by the leader mRNA causes a first-order decay of the host factors, resulting in a shortage of the ribosomes equipped with the accessory factors for viral translation in the late infection stage in our model. Unlike viral transcription and replication, viral translation is directly affected by the decay of host factors since it depends entirely on host machinery. In the early infection, host mRNAs outnumber viral mRNAs and thereby successfully compete for the host translation machinery. However, the newly synthesized M proteins inhibit the host transcription initiation and the export of host mRNAs from the nucleus to the cytoplasm [57] , thereby causing a gradual shift in translation from host mRNAs to viral mRNAs. For our model we assumed that the potency of the inhibition by the M protein was independent of the type of cell and its differentiation state [36] , and we developed an empirical formula using available experimental data from the literature [36] to account for the competition between host and viral mRNAs for ribosomes. Lyles at al. cotransfected the host cells with VSV M mRNA and chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) plasmid DNA, and then they quantified the expression of CAT based on its activity, as a function of the expression of VSV M protein [36] . In their experiment the gene expression of CAT was more reduced at higher M protein expression levels. We assume that the decrease of the expression of CAT (or its activity decrease) is proportional to the decrease of the occupancy of host mRNAs by the translation machinery. Using their experimental data, the occupancy of host mRNAs by the translation machinery is correlated with the number of newly synthesized M proteins in the cytoplasm:",

At time zero (t \u00bc 0), the number of bound virus particles and the level of all viral components within cells are zero. In our model, binding of extracellular virus particles to cells reduces their level (Equation 1), and an encapsidated genome and stoichiometric amounts of viral proteins (Table 2 , [28, 29] ) are then immediately released from each bound virus particle to the cytoplasm. Specifically, we assume that all N proteins from a bound virus particle are released as a form of encapsidated genome complex. Downstream processes, beginning with transcription, are then initiated. In our simulation, viral infection starts with rib_host \u00bc 0.99 (with rib_host \u00bc 0.9, ; 0.9995 simulations showed the same results).

Novella (Medical College of Ohio, Toledo, Ohio, United States) and grown as monolayers at 37 8C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO 2 . BHK growth medium was Minimal Essential Medium with Earle's salts (MEM) (Cellgro, Fisher Scientific, http://www.fischersci. com) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, HyClone, http:// www.hyclone.com), and 2 mM Glutamax I (Glu, Gibco, http://www. invitrogen.com). DBT cells were obtained from J. Fleming (University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin, United States) and grown under the same environment as the BHK cells. DBT growth medium was Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (Cellgro, Fisher Scientific) containing 10% newborn calf serum (NCS, Hyclone), 4 mM Glutamax I (Glu, Gibco), and 15 lM HEPES (Sigma, http://www.sigmaaldrich. com). Both BHK and DBT cells were subcultured approximately every third day. For subculture, cell monolayers were rinsed with Hanks Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS, Fisher Scientific), incubated in 0.025% trypsin/26 mM EDTA (Fisher Scientific) for 5 min, dispersed through mixing, and then replated in fresh growth medium at 1:30 (BHK) or 1:15 dilution (DBT). No antibiotics were used, and cells were subcultured for no more than 4 mo to minimize the effects of cell senescence. Viability of cell populations always approached 100%, as determined by trypan blue exclusion at the time of experiments. Four gene-rearranged strains (N1-N4) of VSV were obtained from G. Wertz (University of Alabama School of Medicine, Birmingham, Alabama). Their genomic structures are as follows: 39-N-P-M-G-L-59 (N1), 39-P-N-M-G-L-59 (N2), 39-P-M-N-G-L-59 (N3), 39-P-M-G-N-L-59 (N4). Each strain of virus was bulked once on BHK cells at multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 or 0.1 plaque-forming units per cell. Infected cells were incubated in infection medium (MEM/Glu/2% FBS) for 20-24 h. At the end of the incubation period, the medium was harvested and passed through a 0.2-lm filter. The filtered virus solution was aliquoted and stored at \u00c090 8C until use.",
