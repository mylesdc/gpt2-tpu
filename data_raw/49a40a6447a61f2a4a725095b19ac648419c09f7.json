The dynamics and the factors causing outbreaks of these diseases can be better understood using mathematical models, which are fit to data. Here we investigate the dynamics of a Hepatitis E outbreak in the Kitgum region of northern Uganda during 2007 to 2009. First, we use the data to determine that R 0 is approximately 2.25 for the outbreak. Secondly, we use a model to estimate that the critical level of latrine and bore hole coverages needed to eradicate the epidemic is at least 16% and 17% respectively. Lastly, we further investigate the relationship between the co-infection factor for malaria and Hepatitis E on the value of R 0 for Hepatitis E. Taken together, these results provide us with a better understanding of the dynamics and possible causes of Hepatitis E outbreaks.",

Many important infectious diseases persist on a knife-edge: rapid rates of transmission coupled with brief infectious periods. Such violent epidemic behavior has been observed in plague [4] , cholera [5] , pertussis [6] and more recently Hepatitis E. The recent outbreak of Hepatitis E in northern Uganda, has left many dead and a number of infectives that continue to spread the infection [7] . Hepatitis E is caused by infection with the Hepatitis E virus (HEV) which has a fecal-oral transmission route. It is a self-limiting disease but occasionally develops into an acute severe liver disease. As emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases increase in outbreak frequency, there is a compelling interest in understanding their dynamics [8] [9] [10] .",

Malaria has been shown to disarm the immune system and increase susceptibility to viral infections such as HIV [11] . Recently, in a 3-month follow-up study the pattern of co-infection of Plasmodium falciparum malaria and acute Hepatitis A (HAV), in 222 Kenyan children under the age of 5 years was observed [12] . The incidence of HAV infections during P. falciparum malaria was found to be 6.3 times higher than the cumulative incidence of HAV, suggesting that co-infection of the two pathogens may result from changes in host susceptibility. There is also evidence both for [13, 14] and against [15, 16] an association between Hepatitis B viruses and malaria. HEV transmission route is similar to the Hepatitis A virus and thus for HEV it is important to consider possible links to co-infection with malaria. This can be done using mathematical models of multiple pathogens [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] .",

In Kitgum district Uganda, most people live in internally displaced camps. The number of latrines in the area are not enough for the entire population, [11] , and people use the local environment for this purpose. When rain falls, it washes the faeces into water bodies. In the Kitgum region, few people have access to clean bore hole water [11] , and therefore collect water from the contaminated water sources. To model this phenomenon we use l, to denote the proportion of households in Kitgum with access to latrines. Therefore, the rate of change of contamination c of the environment is given by",

First, we use equation (9), the parameters in Table 2 , and the value of R 0~2 :11, (linear regression) Assume that contamination is due to insufficient latrines. Then, for R 0~1 , this method estimates that the latrine coverage should be increased to at least 17.1%. This translates into increasing the number of latrines from 1,038 to 4,796 (i.e. 3,756 extra latrines): 1 latrine per 7 people. Similarly, the boreholes should be increased from 23 to 230, that is, 17.7%, or 1 bore hole per 26 households. Similar results are obtained using R 0~2 :25 found from the non-linear fitting tool. In this case of Hepatitis E-only, the latrines should be increased to 16.1% and boreholes must cover 16.6% of the population. From the coinfection model, latrines should be increased to 17.5%: 4,908, (3,870 extra), 1 for 6 people. Boreholes should be increased to 18.1%, a total of 234, or 1 bore hole per 26 households.",

Thus, the cost per disability adjusted life year averted in Kitgum, in the case of Hepatitis E is 869,250/7,066 = USD 123.00. In addition to improving hygiene we should consider education. Let us now consider the case of education to the camp dwellers. Taking the simplest and cheapest scenario of hiring twenty (20) guidance and counseling officials to educate the dwellers about hepatitis E for about a month (that is 30) days, moving around the camp. Let us assign each counselor, 10 households per day. We then calculate the total amount in USD that would facilitate such an exercise as shown in Table 3 . From the calculations, it is seen that 104,000 USD would be required.
