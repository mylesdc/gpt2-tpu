            "text": "Development of effective vaccines to prevent influenza, particularly highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) caused by influenza A virus (IAV) subtype H5N1, is a challenging goal. In this study, we designed and constructed two recombinant influenza vaccine candidates by fusing hemagglutinin 1 (HA1) fragment of A/Anhui/1/2005(H5N1) to either Fc of human IgG (HA1-Fc) or foldon plus Fc (HA1-Fdc), and evaluated their immune responses and cross-protection against divergent strains of H5N1 virus. Results showed that these two recombinant vaccines induced strong immune responses in the vaccinated mice, which specifically reacted with HA1 proteins and an inactivated heterologous H5N1 virus. Both proteins were able to cross-neutralize infections by one homologous strain (clade 2.3) and four heterologous strains belonging to clades 0, 1, and 2.2 of H5N1 pseudoviruses as well as three heterologous strains (clades 0, 1, and 2.3.4) of H5N1 live virus. Importantly, immunization with these two vaccine candidates, especially HA1-Fdc, provided complete cross-clade protection against high-dose lethal challenge of different strains of H5N1 virus covering clade 0, 1, and 2.3.4 in the tested mouse model. This study suggests that the recombinant fusion proteins, particularly HA1-Fdc, could be developed into an efficacious universal H5N1 influenza vaccine, providing cross-protection against infections by divergent strains of highly pathogenic H5N1 virus.

            "text": "Influenza epidemics and pandemics caused by influenza A virus (IAV) occur frequently. The first influenza pandemic of the 21 st century emerged in 2009, with a novel swine-origin influenza virus (S-OIV) H1N1 as the causative agent. Originating in Mexico, it rapidly spread to North America and then globally [1] [2] [3] [4] . Of more concern, however, is the continual outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1, an influenza A subtype virus circulating in poultry, which has caused hundreds of human diseases with severe morbidity and high mortality since its re-emergence in 2003 (http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/country/ cases_table_2010_12_09/en/index.html). Although genetic analysis of H5N1 isolated from humans revealed that all genes were of avian origin, limited person-to-person transmission of H5N1 viruses was identified [5] . Now the concern is that future influenza epidemics may be caused by new virus strains derived from mutations and/or reassortments of existing influenza viruses, particularly HPAI H5N1. Therefore, the development of effective preventive and therapeutic measures against IAV, particularly avian H5N1, is urgently needed.",

Current efforts to develop HPAI H5N1 vaccines are mainly focused on inactivated vaccines, which have been demonstrated to be effective in animal models for protection of H5N1 infection and to induce neutralizing antibodies in about 70% of human volunteers [6] [7] [8] . The other H5N1 vaccine candidates, such as those based on live-attenuated virus [9] , viral vectors [10] , virus-like particles (VLP) [11] , DNA vaccines [12] and recombinant proteins [13] , have also been tested in animal models [14, 15] , and even evaluated in clinical trials [16] . However, because of the rapid mutation of hemagglutinin (HA) protein of HPAI H5N1 virus, the cross-protective immunity of these vaccines is fundamentally restricted, highly limiting their potential use against divergent H5N1 viruses.",

This may be achieved by upgrading vaccine formulas with effective adjuvants for either inactivated or live-attenuated IAV vaccines [15] , designing novel vaccine components that rely on conserved sequences or universal epitopes of viral proteins, such as matrix protein 2 (M2), HA, and nucleoprotein (NP) [14, 17] , updating vaccine delivery systems [18] , or combining viral proteins with other components [19] . The above findings represent a significant advancement towards the development of more efficacious H5N1 influenza vaccines.",

For example, fusion of Fc to HIV-1 protein has also been shown to increase the immunogenicity of fusion proteins and to elicit neutralizing antibody responses [22, 23] . This is explained by the ability of Fc to promote correct folding of the fusion proteins following expression and the possibility that IgG Fc may help to enhance binding to antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and cell lines expressing Fc receptors (FcR) [22, 24] . The foldon (Fd) sequence derived from native T4 phage fibritin has been typically incorporated at the C-terminus of collagen-like protein molecules to facilitate stabilization of protein trimer or oligomer [25, 26] , indicating that C-terminal Fd is essential for correct trimerization and folding of the protein [27] .",

After purification, the proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by Coomassie blue staining, and reactivity was determined using a HA-specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) developed in our laboratory [29] . As shown in Fig. 2A , one clear band was observed in samples of HA1-Fc and HA1-Fdc proteins analyzed by SDS-PAGE, indicating that highly purified proteins could be obtained from transfected culture supernatant.

Exogenous bacterial neuraminidase (NA) (Sigma) was added 24 and 48 h later, and supernatants were harvested 72 h post-transfection for single-cycle infection. The pseudovirus-containing supernatants were incubated with serially diluted mouse sera at 37uC for 1 h before adding to 293T cells. Fresh medium was added 24 h later, followed by lysing cells 72 h later using cell lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI) and transferring the lysates into 96-well luminometer plates. Luciferase substrate (Promega) was added to the plates, and relative luciferase activity was determined in an Ultra 384 luminometer (Tecan). The neutralization of HA pseudovirus was calculated [43] and presented as NT 50 .",

No IgG antibody response was detectable in the sera of control mice injected with PBS(Fig. 3).IgG1 and IgG2a subtypes induced by HA1-Fc and HA1-Fdc proteins were detected in the mouse sera collected at 10 days postlast vaccination. The results showed that both HA1-Fc and HA1-Fdc elicited similar levels of IgG1(Th2-associated, Fig. 4A) and IgG2a (Th1-associated,Fig. 4B) antibody responses specific to the HA1 proteins, reaching an end-point antibody titer of 1:2.1610 8 .",
