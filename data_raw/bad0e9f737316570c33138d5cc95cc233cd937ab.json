First, the study spanned over a period of only 12 months, limiting our ability to fully assess the temporal circulation pattern of the investigated agents. Due to the small sample size, we may also have been underpowered to detect small variations in the temporal distribution of the investigated agents. Second, attribution of causality remains challenging due to the lack of controls in our study. The association of pathogen detection with illness could not be well assessed, although most of the viral and bacterial pathogens identified in this study have been described in previous case control studies as causative agents of ARI. 10, 39 In addition, we did not collect blood samples to assess whether the detection of common bacterial colonizers of the nasopharynx, such as S pneumoniae,",

However, the colonization rate found in this study was lower than that reported in a study conducted in 2014 (54.5%), which could be attributed to the introduction of the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccination (PCV13) in Niger that same year.37 The very low detection rate of Hib (2.5%) may also be attributed to the introduction of the Hib conjugate (tetanus toxoid) vaccine in the expanded immunization program in 2008 in Niger.38 Uncommon respiratory bacterial pathogens including M pneumoniae and C pneumoniae were detected at a very low rate (less than 1%), and this correlates with the results reported in previous studies.10,26,27 F I G U R E 3 Weekly number of specimens positive for respiratory (A) viruses and (B) bacteria in Niamey,",

These findings are consistent with a study from Mali, which reported a rate of antibiotics uptake of 39.8% before admission and elevated antibiotics usage (more than 95%) on admission.39 The national guidelines for ARI treatment based on the Inte-grated Management of Childhood Illness (Manuel sur la Prise en Charge Integr\u00e9e des Maladies de l'Enfant (PCIME) (2001), retrieved from https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/67167/ WHO_FCH_CAH_00.12_fre.pdf;jsessionid= 65C124F019A55837AF0B229E9AB1B21A?sequence=1) include the systematic use of antibiotics for empiric treatment to prevent superinfection. However, considering the high number of patients from whom only respiratory viruses were detected, this practice raises concern about the potentially excessive use of antibiotics-and resistance development-in Niger. 28 About 15% to 17% of patients with febrile ARI also had diarrhea, were malnourished, or were coinfected with malaria. This could be explained by the fact that these infections constitute some of the leading public health concerns in Niger and are responsible for elevated childhood mortality (Annuaire des statistiques sanitaires du Niger) (2016).
