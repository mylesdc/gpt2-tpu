            "text": "Highly effective and attenuated dose schedules are good regimens for drug research and development. Combination chemotherapy is a good strategy in cancer therapy. We evaluated the antitumour effects of dihydroberberine combined with sunitinib (DCS) on the human non-small cell lung cancer cell lines (NSCLC), A549, NCI-H460, and NCI-H1299 in vitro and in vivo. DCS showed synergic effects on NCI-H460 cell proliferation, colony formation and transplantable tumour growth, which suggested dihydroberberine increases the sensitivity of lung carcinoma to sunitinib. Further studies indicated that DCS down-regulated phosphorylation of JNK, p38, and NF-jB in NCI-H460 cells and tumours and suppressed the IjB and COX-2 expression. In addition, DCS reduced the secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin-1 (IL-1), in tumours. Inhibition of p38 activation by DCS was a likely contributing factor in IL-1 and COX-2 down-regulation. Consistent with these results, a genomewide microarray analysis found that DCS induced the expression of cell cycle signal molecules that are known to be affected by JNK and p38. The change of cell cycle, in turn, led to down-regulation of JNK and p38, and further reduced IL-1 secretion. Collectively, these findings highlight potential molecular mechanisms of DCS chemotherapeutic activity and suggest that DCS is an efficacious strategy in NSCLC therapy.",

The majority of patients with NSCLC are already in an advanced stage at diagnosis, and surgical treatment is not curative, so chemotherapy remains a mainstay of therapy [3] . Therefore, novel chemotherapeutic agents are urgently needed. Combination therapy, which improves the curative effect and reduces the toxicity of these drugs, has become one of the most important means of improving survival of patients with lung cancer [4] . In addition, agents with anti-inflammatory activities may exert a chemoprotective effect on normal tissues against the toxic insults of chemotherapy.",

            "text": "Accumulating evidence has verified that many inflammatory signalling pathways are activated in various cancers; therefore, inflammation plays a critical role in multiple stages of tumour development, including initiation, promotion, invasion and metastasis [5, 6] . Lung cancer is associated with an inflammatory environment, and many inflammatory mediators promote the development of lung cancer [7] . Meanwhile, it has been reported that activation of the MAPK pathway plays an important role in the initiation and development of inflammatory processes. MAPK signalling cascades are important regulators of pro-inflammatory cytokines [8] , which transmit signals through sequential phosphorylation events. MAPKs can phosphorylate transcription factors or other downstream kinases that up-regulate the expression of pro-inflammatory mediators of extracellular stimuli [9] . There are three major subfamilies of MAPK: the extracellular-signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2), the c-Jun N-terminal or stress-activated protein kinases (JNK or SAPK), and p38 MAPKs [10] [11] [12] . Among mediators, three prominent cytokines, that is tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-1 (IL-1), could contribute to the development of lung cancer [13] . These cytokines could induce transcription factors that drive inflammation, including NF-jB and STAT3. NF-jB, which is one of many downstream targets of TNF receptor 1 activation, is an important, ubiquitous transcription factor known to regulate the expression of genes involved in inflammation, cell proliferation, migration, extracellular matrix turnover and angiogenesis [14, 15] .",

Sunitinib (Fig. 1B) is a multitargeted receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is effective against many tyrosine kinases, including PDGFR, VEGFR, FLT-3, CSF-1R, kit and ret. Preclinical and clinic trials have demonstrated that sunitinib has potent antitumour activity against renal cell carcinomas, gastrointestinal stromal tumours, breast carcinomas, NSCLC and other cancers. Its anticancer activity results from a dual inhibitory effect towards angiogenesis and tumour cell proliferation. Its main adverse reactions include hypodynamia, nausea and thrombocytopenia [17] , which can be attributed to megadosing. In our study, we explored the effect of dihydroberberine on lung cancer cells and investigated the synergistic action of dihydroberberine and sunitinib on NCI-H460 lung carcinoma cells in vitro and in vivo. Here, we report our novel findings that dihydroberberine decreased the effective dose of and increased the sensitivity of lung carcinomas to sunitinib.",

As shown in Figure 1C and D, 25 lmol/l dihydroberberine, 2 lmol/l sunitinib, and their combination had inhibition rates of 26.32%, 36.78% and 62.62%, respectively, in NCI-H460 cells. Meanwhile, the CI value of 25 lmol/l dihydroberberine combined with 2 lmol/l sunitinib was 1.17, which indicated a better synergistic effect of inhibiting NCI-H460 cell viability than the individual compounds. The colony formation assay showed that the colonies treated with DCS were significantly fewer in number and smaller in size than the control cells and Dih-/Sun-treated cells (Fig. 1E and F) , which further confirmed the synergistic effects of DCS. Figure 2B . On day 15, all of the mice were killed, and tumours were excised and weighed (Fig. 2C) .

For comparison, the tumour weight with DCS was 0.47 AE 0.07 g.

Microarray results indicated that a large number of the top-ranking, down-regulated genes in DCS-treated cells were associated with several cancer biological processes, such as cell cycle phase, cell cycle process, M phase, M phase of mitotic cell cycle, homophilic cell adhesion and cell-cell adhesion (Fig. 5B upper panel) . As shown in the lower panel of Figure 5B , the main GO categories for up-regulated genes in DCStreated cells included positive regulation of cell cycle, regulation of apoptosis, p53 signalling pathway and negative regulation of apoptosis.

As shown in Figure 5D , as compared with controls, treatment of DCS induced an accumulation of NCI-H460 cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. The population of untreated cells in G1 phase were 39.26%, whereas in cells treated with dihydroberberine, sunitinib and DCS, the population of cells in G1 phase showed a dose-dependent increase and were 44.67%, 44.00% and 67.97%, respectively. A decrease in the population of cells in the S phase was also observed, and changed from 48.60% to 37.56%, 49.98% and 18.51%. Consistent with the microarray data, DCS significantly up-regulated the protein levels of cyclin D1, cyclin B1, and CDK1, as well as down-regulated the level of cyclin E1 compared to control; the expression of cyclin A2 and CDK2 did not change (Fig. 5E and F) . These results indicate that DCS would induce an accumulation of NCI-H460 cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Our findings suggest that DCS inhibits NCI-H460 cell viability and arrests the cell cycle at G1 phase by modulating JNK and p38 MAPK signalling.",

Therefore, it is necessary to search for novel agents to enhance the anticancer effects of sunitinib. Berberine has been reported to have various pharmacological activities, but there have been no reports on its analogue, dihydroberberine. In the current study, we evaluated the effects of dihydroberberine on lung cancer cells, including NCI-H460, A549, and NCI-H1299 cells, and confirmed that dihydroberberine treatment resulted in a reduction of cell viability in a dose-dependent manner. Meanwhile, we found that dihydroberberine combined with sunitinib at appropriate concentrations (dihydroberberine was 25 lmol/l and sunitinib was 2 lmol/l) had obvious synergistic inhibition on NCI-H460 cell viability, compared with dihydroberberine or sunitinib alone. Furthermore, dihydroberberine combined with sunitinib displayed good inhibition on NCI-H460 cell colony formation in vitro and xenografts in nude mice in vivo. Based on these promising results, we further explored the molecular mechanisms of the synergetic interaction of dihydroberberine and sunitinib.",

In cancer, PI3K/AKT/mTOR is constitutively activated by PI3Ks (composed of p110 catalytic subunits and regulatory subunits) that catalyse [20, 21] . The MAPK signalling pathway belongs to a large family of serine-threonine kinases, which include ERK1/2, p38 and JNK, and forms major cell proliferation signalling pathways from the cell surface to the nucleus [22] . ERK is activated by mitogenic stimuli, such as growth factors, cytokines, and phorbol esters, which are involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation and meiosis. The JNK family members are key molecules in the signal transduction of various kinds of stress, as well as in neural development, inflammation and apoptosis. They are activated by radiation, osmotic pressure, temperature and others factors [23] . P38 mediates growth, inflammation and apoptosis; it has thus become a target in the development of anti-inflammatory drugs [24] . JNK and p38 are important regulators of inflammatory mediators, so the activation of MAPK pathways plays an essential role in the initiation and development of inflammatory processes. Our results indicate that dihydroberberine combined with sunitinib has no effect on various isoforms of PI3K, either the catalytic or regulatory subunits, and also has no effect on the downstream effectors, AKT and mTOR. Interestingly, we found that dihydroberberine combined with sunitinib inhibited JNK and p38 activation in NCI-H460 cells and tumours, but had no effect on ERK. Therefore, our results indicate that DCS may be a good multitarget combinatorial drug.",

The p38 MAPKs phosphorylate and activate several important transcription factors, including NF-jB, p53 and ATF, which leads to the induction and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines [26] . NF-jB is an important signal pathway, which plays a vital role in regulating the expression of multiple genes, including pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, TNF-a and interferon-c) [27] . Increasing evidence reveals that the inhibition of NF-jB activity may lead to alleviating the severity of inflammatory diseases [28] . The activation of NF-jB is regulated by three major steps: phosphorylation of IjB, degradation of IjB and nuclear translocation of NF-jB [29] . Therefore, measurement of the presence of NF-jB can indirectly reflect the activity of the transcription factor. Using Western blotting and immunohistochemistry, our results indicate that DCS significantly inhibits IjB and the phosphorylation of NF-jB in NCI-H460 cells and tumours. It has been previously reported that an increased NF-jB expression is accompanied by an increased secretion of TNF-a, IL-1 and IL-6 [30] . In the present study, DCS only inhibited the level of IL-1, but had no effect on TNF-a and IL-6 in tumours by ELISA. The p38 pathway is also associated with the production of COX-2, which is an important inflammation factor that catalyses prostaglandin synthesis [31] . We show that DCS inhibits the expression of COX-2, but has no effect on PEGES2 in NCI-H460 cells and tumours based on Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Therefore, inhibition of p38 activation by DCS appears to be an inducible factor of IL-1 and COX-2 down-regulation in our model system.",

Cell cycle progression is closely related to various cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), CDK inhibitors and certain tumour suppressor gene products. Cell cycle regulation is downstream of JNK and p38 MAPKs, and genes closely related to the cell cycle, including cyclin D1, cyclin B1, CDK1, cyclin E1, cyclin A2 and CDK2, were confirmed to be altered using Western blotting.

DCS shows more inhibition on lung cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo, possibly by down-regulating p38 and JNK MAPK signalling molecules, while simultaneously inhibiting IjB, NF-jB phosphorylation and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Inhibition of p38 activation by DCS could be responsible for IL-1 and COX-2 down-regulation. Regulation of the cell cycle could subsequently lead to down-regulation of JNK and p38, and further reduce IL-1 secretion.
