            "text": "Prostate cancer is diagnosed in over 1 million men every year globally, yet current diagnostic modalities are inadequate for identification of significant cancer and more reliable early diagnostic biomarkers are necessary for improved clinical management of prostate cancer patients. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) modulate important cellular processes/pathways contributing to cancer and are stably present in body fluids. In this study we profiled 372 cancer-associated miRNAs in plasma collected before (~60% patients) and after/during commencement of treatment (~40% patients), from age-matched prostate cancer patients and healthy controls, and observed elevated levels of 4 miRNAs -miR-4289, miR-326, miR-152-3p and miR-98-5p, which were validated in an independent cohort. The miRNA panel was able to differentiate between prostate cancer patients and controls (AUC = 0.88). Analysis of published miRNA transcriptomic data from clinical samples demonstrated low expression of miR-152-3p in tumour compared to adjacent non-malignant tissues. Overexpression of miR-152-3p increased proliferation and migration of prostate cancer cells, suggesting a role for this miRNA in prostate cancer pathogenesis, a concept that was supported by pathway analysis of predicted miR-152-3p target genes. In summary, a four miRNA panel, including miR-152-3p which likely targets genes with key roles in prostate cancer pathogenesis, has the potential to improve early prostate cancer diagnosis.",

Measuring the levels of prostate specific antigen (PSA; also known as human kallikrein-3) in serum is the standard first line test to indicate risk of prostate cancer and the most widely used biomarker for prostate cancer diagnosis. The advent of the PSA test in the late 1990s as a tool for prostate cancer diagnosis has enormously benefited prostate cancer patients for more than two decades 2,3 . However, inadequacies continue to exist over its suitability for use as a diagnostic tool for early detection of prostate cancer due to lack of specificity and high rates of over-diagnosis and over-treatment associated with PSA testing 4, 5 . Therefore, there is an urgent clinical need for better diagnostic tools for prostate cancer.",

Most prostate biopsies are routinely performed taking 12 cores under transrectal ultrasound guidance 6 , with an increase in the core number found to increase cancer detection rate by only 1.06 fold 7 . However, the major drawback lies in the possibility of generating false negatives, as the samples are often taken randomly due to the unknown location of the tumour, and patients may require repeated biopsies under MRI guidance or in combination with ultrasound for better sensitivity 6 . Over recent years, considerable research has led to the development of several molecular and genetic assays that have provided a prospective direction for the development of prostate cancer biomarkers 5 . Such assays utilise body fluid-or tissue-based biomarkers for the diagnosis, prognosis and risk stratification of prostate cancer 5 . Despite recent advances, it is still necessary to understand the role of these tests in the overall management of prostate cancer patients and the search for potential new biomarkers continues.",

A fold regulation cut-off of 2.5 was selected for the analysis. (b) Scatter plot showing the 11 differentially regulated miRNAs re-analysed by qRT-PCR in patient samples in the discovery cohort (N = 61). The mean fold regulation of each miRNA across the patient and control samples was taken into account and those that were below the 2 fold regulation cut-off were excluded from further analysis. The selected miRNAs are shown in colour. (c) Relative levels of miR-4289, miR-326, miR-152-3p and miR-98-5p analysed by qRT-PCR as in (b) in patients vs healthy controls. Statistically significant differences were assessed using a Mann-Whitney U test; p values are shown after Bonferroni correction for multiple testing. Each data point represents a plasma sample, the horizontal middle line in each data set represents the mean, and the limits of the vertical lines represent the standard deviation.",

Despite some differences in the Gleason score between the two cohorts, the diagnostic accuracy of the miRNA signature was similar in the discovery, validation and combined cohorts. miRNA expression in transcriptomic data from clinical samples. Since there may be differences between the expression of miRNAs in the circulation and in tumour tissues, we next determined whether the plasma levels of the identified miRNAs reflected similar changes in tumour tissues. Analysis of published miRNA transcriptomic data from clinical samples in the TCGA dataset demonstrated low expression of miR-152-3p in tumour compared to adjacent non-malignant tissues (p = 0.001) (Wilcoxon test, p \u2264 0.05) (Fig. 4) Figure S3) . Our results suggest a significant (p = 0.0002) increase in the proliferative potential of LNCaP cells upon overexpression of miR-152-3p using miRNA mimics (Fig. 5a) . We observed a substantial increase in cell confluence and change in cell morphology in miR-152-3p mimic treated cells when compared to non-targeting negative control treated cells over a period Tables S5 and S6 ). The miRNet predicted targets are determined experimentally as part of larger experiments such as microarray, RNA-seq, qPCR and PAR-CLIP, an immunoprecipitation method for identifying the binding sites of cellular RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and microRNA-containing ribonucleoprotein complexes (miRNPs) and each identified target gene is supported by the experiment name and PubMed literature 21 . Based on the analysis of miRNA expression in the TCGA dataset and functional assays, miR-152-3p targets were used as an input for Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). IPA generated 275 canonical pathways for the 131 targets of miR-152-3p (Supplementary Table S7 ). Prostate cancer signalling was among the top ten canonical pathways consisting of 8 deregulated target genes (highlighted in purple) i.e. FGFR3, IRS1, SOS2, HSP90AA1, KRAS, CDKN1B, CCND1 and PTEN of miR-152-3p (\u2212log p = 5.75) (Fig. 6 ) where FGFR3 and IRS1 are closely related to PI3K and hence shown as a group. Analysis of the molecular function of these genes confirmed their involvement in cellular processes such as cell cycle, cell morphology, cell growth and proliferation and cell movement (Supplementary Table S8 ). The analysis also generated a list of upstream regulators of the 8 target genes (Supplementary Table S9 ). Of the 8 target genes of miR-152-3p, six overlapped with GSEA where prostate cancer was found to be the second most important pathway among the top 20 KEGG pathways (Supplementary Figure S6) . Furthermore, Oncomine data analysis of these 8 genes showed significant upregulation of CCND1 (p = 9. Figure S8 ).",

In the present study, we identified an association of elevated plasma levels of four miRNAs i.e. miR-4289, miR-326, miR-98-5p and miR-152-3p in prostate cancer patients. Initially, we analysed the plasma Prostate cancer signalling was among the top ten canonical pathways consisting of eight deregulated miR-152-3p target genes (highlighted in purple) i.e. FGFR3, IRS1, SOS2, HSP90AA1, KRAS, CDKN1B, CCND1 and PTEN where FGFR3 and IRS1 are closely related to PI3K and hence shown as a group. Some of the targets for e.g. HSP90, KRAS and SOS exist as a complex or group of genes. The p value was represented as \u2212log p = 5.57 for the analysis. miRNAome in age-matched prostate cancer patients and healthy controls using a miRNA PCR array approach. We selected sample pooling for initial screening of miRNAs because it minimised cost, reduced analytical run times and compensated for limited amounts of plasma samples enabling us to profile a large number of miRNAs in patient and control samples in a cost effective way, and has been employed in previous studies 22, 23 . Many biological experiments have relied on pooling of biological specimens and the efficiency of this method has also been statistically investigated previously 24, 25 . Although sample pooling has its own advantages, it is not the optimum approach because while mitigating the loss of information, it does not take into consideration biological variation within individual samples. This may lead to the difference observed between miRNA expression in pooled and individual samples. Therefore, subsequent qRT-PCR in single samples from the discovery and validation cohorts was performed for validation of results and only those miRNAs that were deregulated in the same direction in both pooled and individual samples were selected for further analysis by applying a stringent cut-off. The majority of previously conducted studies have used a higher C T cut-off to identify multiple miRNAs, however, we have applied a strict cut-off to our analysis as our goal was to determine the most obvious candidates for rapid identification along the line of clinical translation. Our identified miRNA signature generated ROC curves with AUC values better than the previously reported AUC value for PSA 26, 27 . Similarly, other groups have assessed the diagnostic performance of plasma or serum miRNAs in patients with localised or metastatic prostate cancer, BPH and healthy controls, and in most instances the specificity and sensitivity of the miRNA biomarkers have outperformed the accuracy of the PSA test 23, 28, 29 . Although early detection and management of prostate cancer is a complex ongoing issue, there is insufficient evidence to support the benefits of population-based screening for prostate cancer in Australia and in the United States using the PSA test [30] [31] [32] . The Cancer Council Australia and U.S. Preventative Services Task Force recommends against the PSA test, partly due to the over-diagnosis and over-treatment associated with it 33, 34 . PSA screening in healthy men is uncommon in Australia and thus, we did not have the PSA values for our control group which limited our ability to perform the miRNA vs PSA comparisons in our study. A pertinent limitation of our study is that some (45% and 42%, respectively) patient samples in cohort-1 and 2 were collected after or during primary treatment. Although miRNA levels are affected by the treatment regimen of patients, we have tried to mitigate this effect by keeping the timing of sample collection consistent between the discovery and validation cohorts, using appropriate statistical methods and relying on the stability of miRNAs in body fluids.",

The expression pattern is in line with our findings in the TCGA dataset where miR-152 is lowly expressed in tumour compared with adjacent non-malignant tissues. A possible mechanism for the decreased expression is likely to be methylation of the miR-152 host gene promoter which prevents transcription of this miRNA in tumour tissues possibly due to its tumour suppressive nature 45 . Another mechanism could be its release into the circulation to enable tumour growth at metastatic sites which may explain our results obtained through functional assays using miR-152-3p mimics. Elevated levels of plasma miR-152 have been proposed as a diagnostic biomarker for other cancers such as lung, colorectal and breast cancer 46 , and our findings suggest its potential to detect prostate cancer either alone or in combination with the other three identified miRNAs.",

Studies have reported that circulating miRNAs are involved in cell to cell communication and can be taken up by recipient cells to exert functional effects such as proliferation, invasion and angiogenesis 47 . For example, tumour exosomal miRNAs were shown to promote metastasis in other sites of the body by modulation of stromal cells in distant organs 48 . We did not observe any significant effect of miR-152-3p overexpression on the proliferative ability of PC3 prostate cancer cells as previously suggested by Zhu et al. 43 . In contrast, we found that overexpression of miR-152-3p significantly increased proliferation and migration in LNCaP prostate cancer cells which suggests that regulation by the androgen receptor (AR) may account for the observed differences. This is contradictory to the findings from another study by Theodore et al. where low expression of miR-152 has been correlated with an increase in prostate cancer metastasis 44 . However, this may provide a clue to the metastatic role of this miRNA at a distant site other than its site of production possibly via exosomal escape as miRNAs are known to play a role in metastasis 49,50 and miR-152-3p has been previously reported as an exosomal miRNA 51, 52 . It is also believed that miRNA secretion is a selective process and therefore, SCIenTIFIC RePoRtS | (2018) 8:6653 | DOI:10.1038/s41598-018-24424-w circulatory levels are not a true reflection of intracellular levels 53 .

CCND1 is over-expressed in a considerable portion of human malignancies such as breast and prostate cancer 57, 58 and it has been shown as a miRNA target in breast cancer cells and primary prostatic epithelial cells 56 . Similarly, recent studies by Lynch et al. and Chakravarthi et al. demonstrated an inverse correlation between CDKN1B and miRNAs in prostate cancer cell lines and clinical prostatectomy specimens 59, 60 . However, we did not observe any change in CCND1 and CDKN1B mRNA expression in LNCaP cells with miR-152-3p treatment. KRAS is a well-established oncogenic GTPase protein playing an important role in cell division, differentiation and apoptosis. miRNA targeting of the KRAS 3\u2032UTR in a recent study induced cell apoptosis in vitro and exerted a tumour suppressive effect in vivo in xenograft mice models of colorectal cancer 61 . This suggests the importance of the miRNA-KRAS axis in prostate cancer where the miRNA has been found to play a tumour suppressive role 62 . On the contrary, our results suggest the upregulation of KRAS at the mRNA level with miR-152-3p treatment in LNCaP cells which may explain the increase in cell proliferation and migration observed during our functional studies. HSP90AA1 is a molecular chaperone that promotes regulation of specific proteins involved in signal transduction and cell cycle. A recent study by Wilson et al. indicated the importance of histone methylation of AR binding sites of transcriptional targets, such as HSP90AA1 in androgen signalling in prostate cancer progression 63 . This may result in a positive regulation of HSP90AA1 in metastasis as shown by our Oncomine data analysis, whereas the expression of HSP90AA1 possibly remains unchanged in localised cancer due to more stable complex formation between AR and HSP90AA1. We observed a decrease in HSP90AA1 mRNA in LNCaP cells after miRNA treatment suggesting it as a possible target of miR-152-3p which in turn may play a role in the androgen signalling pathway. SOS2 is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor involved in Ras activation which stimulates a series of signal cascades crucial for malignant transformation. A recent study by Alles et al. demonstrated that miRNA overexpression in the HEK-293T kidney cancer cell line lead to reduced levels of endogenous SOS2 64 . Therefore, targeting of SOS factors by miRNAs may potentially inactivate Ras signalling, however, many other factors are involved in signalling cascades resulting in cancer progression.",

This dataset was selected over other datasets because it had the largest number of prostate cancer (primary/metastasis) and normal samples for comparison of all the target genes of interest. Although PTEN is generally considered to be a tumour suppressor, it may act as a tumour promoter is some instances 69 . It is also widely known that in addition to gene expression, genomic instabilities, mutations and copy number variation in the PTEN gene are often associated with prostate cancer 70, 71 , and it is estimated that up to 70 percent of primary prostate tumours have PTEN gene mutations 71 . The Yu Prostate dataset in the Oncomine cancer microarray database did not take these into account during data analysis and as a result, PTEN may be shown to be up-regulated. Additional data analysis using other datasets in Oncomine taking PTEN deletions and copy number variations into account revealed trends in the opposite direction.",

Prostate cancer patients were recruited as part of the Prostate Cancer Supportive Care and Patient Outcomes Project (ProsCan), a randomised controlled trial of a psychological intervention for newly diagnosed prostate cancer patients 72, 73 for the discovery cohort (N = 42) . The validation cohort of prostate cancer patients (N = 40) were recruited as part of the Australian Prostate Cancer BioResource (APCB) consisting of 3,100 patients including 350 men recruited via collaborations with urologists, 2,000 men from the QLD node of APCB, and 750 men recruited in collaboration with The Cancer Council Queensland 73 . Healthy male control participants for both the discovery and validation cohorts (N = 37) were recruited through the electoral roll as part of the Queensland Men's Health Study (QLDMen), a cross-sectional population-based study consisting of 1,300 men including 450 age-and postal code-matched controls to complement participants in the ProsCan and APCB studies. The patient and control numbers were selected depending on the availability of samples from participants with similar clinical characteristics, as well as with reference to previous studies that we have discussed in our published review article 20 . The patient group in each cohort is further divided into metastatic (\u22645 and >5 years survival) and non-metastatic patients. This subdivision ensured that each category of participants i.e. metastatic, non-metastatic and healthy in each cohort consisted of about 20 samples. Follow-up data for ~10 years was available for the patients including those who survived for less than 5 years after prostate cancer diagnosis. Details of age, PSA levels, clinical grade (Gleason scores), pathologic state (TNM stages) and family history have been collected to document clinical characteristics of the disease. ~19-22% of the patients and ~11-15% of the healthy controls in each cohort had a family history of prostate cancer. 52.4-62.5% patients and 84.2-88.9% controls in both the cohorts did not have any family history of prostate cancer.",

Prior to RNA isolation, plasma samples in the discovery and validation cohorts were centrifuged for 10 min at 16,000 \u00d7 g at 4\u00b0C and all plasma samples were screened for haemolysis using a Nanodrop ND-1000. For miRNA screening (Fig. 7) , eight random plasma pools (two pools per group) were generated before RNA extraction for the control group and three patient groups in the discovery cohort using a randomising web-based tool (https://www.miniwebtool.com/random-picker/). In this way 150 \u00b5l of plasma required per pool was generated by dividing the total volume required (i.e. 150 \u00b5l) by the number of samples per pool. For example, the control group consisting of 19 healthy males was divided into two plasma pools of 10 and 9 controls. Each of the 10 controls in pool-1 contributed 15 \u00b5l of plasma, while each of the 9 controls in pool-2 contributed 16.67 \u00b5l of plasma. Similarly the three patient groups consisting of 12, 16 and 14 samples were divided into 6 \u00d7 2, 8 \u00d7 2 and 7 \u00d7 2 samples/pool respectively, and each patient per group contributed 25 \u00b5l of plasma in pools-3 and 4, 18.75 \u00b5l of plasma is pools-5 and 6, and 21.43 \u00b5l of plasma in pools-7 and 8. Therefore, total RNA was extracted from 150 \u00b5l of pooled plasma from each of the two pools per patient/ control group in the discovery cohort, and eluted in 14 \u00b5l of RNase-free water using the miRNeasy Serum/Plasma kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's instructions. 0.5 \u00b5g of bacterial ribosomal RNA (Roche) was added to each sample for increased RNA recovery, and 3.5 \u00b5l of miRNeasy Serum/Plasma Spike-In Control i.e. cel-miR-39 (at 1.6 \u00d7 10 8 copies/\u00b5l) (Qiagen) was added to each sample as an internal control for plasma miRNA expression profiling and normalisation of qRT-PCR data as previously described 19 . 5 \u00b5l of extracted RNA from pooled plasma samples was reverse transcribed using the miScript II RT kit with HiSpec Buffer (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions (Fig. 7) .",

The qRT-PCR was run on a ViiA7 system (Applied Biosystems) and the data analysed using the GeneGlobe data analysis software (Qiagen). The cel-miR-39 Spike-In control was used by the program to calibrate the data sets, and the miRNA PCR array data was normalised by the global mean normalisation method 75 . This method automatically calculated a global C T mean for the miRNA targets that were commonly expressed in all the samples being analysed after an initial calibration to the exogenous cel-miR-39 Spike-In control. For plasma miRNA expression profiling in individual samples, the cel-miR-39 Spike-In control was used as an internal control for normalisation of qRT-PCR data as previously SCIenTIFIC RePoRtS | (2018) 8:6653 | DOI:10.1038/s41598-018-24424-w described 19 . Fold regulation represents fold change values generated during miRNA expression profiling in a biologically meaningful way. The fold change was calculated using the equation 2 \u2212\u2206\u2206CT . For fold regulation, the fold change values less than 1 (meaning that the miRNA is down-regulated) was transformed by calculating the negative inverse. Therefore, the values remain the same while their representation is changed only. All C T (number of cycles required for fluorescent signal to cross the set threshold; inversely proportional to miRNA levels) values >30 were considered as a negative call by the software. Therefore, the lower limit of detection was \u226430 C T to avoid false positives. The final values of miRNA expression levels were generated in a biologically meaningful way as fold regulation i.e. the negative inverse of fold change. A 2.5 fold-regulation cut-off was used to shortlist deregulated miRNAs.",

Prostatic expression of the shortlisted miRNAs was assessed in a publicly available cohort comprising of 52 tumour and 52 non-malignant prostate tissues from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The expression of the significantly deregulated miRNAs in prostate tumour tissues was evaluated in a panel of prostate cancer cell lines by qRT-PCR. RNA was extracted from cell lysates using the miRNeasy Micro kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions followed by cDNA synthesis using the miScript II RT kit with HiSpec Buffer (Qiagen). qRT-PCR using the miScript primer assays (Qiagen) and QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Qiagen) was performed as described previously. Cell proliferation and migration assays. For cell proliferation assays 15,000 LNCaP and 10,000 PC3 cells were plated per well in a 96 well plate and allowed to grow for 4 hours before transient transfection with miRNA complexes as described above. For cell migration assays 96-well ImageLock plates (Essen BioScience) were coated with 40 \u03bcl Poly-L-ornithine (Sigma) overnight. 50,000 cells/well were plated the next day and allowed to form a confluent monolayer for 24 hours. The cells were treated with 10 \u00b5g/ml Aphidicolin (Sigma) (an antimitotic reagent) for 1 hour to minimise the effect of cell proliferation on migration. Wounds were created using a 96-pin WoundMaker (Essen BioScience) and the growth media was aspirated to remove cell debris. The cells were treated with 50 \u00b5l of miRNA complexes per well for half an hour before replenishment with 150 \u00b5l of RPMI containing 5% FBS. Percentage confluence (for proliferation) and relative wound density (for migration) was measured every 2 hours for 72 hours using the automated IncuCyte live cell imaging system (Essen BioScience) following the manufacturer's protocol. All treatments were performed with six replicates in three independent experiments. Data analysis was performed using the IncuCyte software. Pathway Analysis. In silico network-based visual analysis was performed using the miRNet web-based platform to identify target genes and pathways potentially altered by the miRNA signature 21 . Forward mapping, which allows users to map from miRNAs to their targets, was performed by uploading the list of miRNA IDs of interest. After data processing, the results were presented as an interaction table with each row corresponding to one miRNA and its target. The table also provided hyperlinks to the corresponding databases from where the miRNA-target interactions were derived, together with references to PubMed literature. Network visualisation was performed through functional annotations based on the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway database, and the hypergeometric algorithm was used for enrichment analysis of input data to generate a list of miRNA target genes. This was further used as an input for in depth analysis using IPA (Qiagen) to determine top canonical pathways, upstream regulators and molecular and cellular functions of the miRNA target genes. The association of the deregulated target genes with disease phenotype was also confirmed using the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) computational method. The differential expression of the target genes in normal (N = 23) vs prostate carcinoma (N = 65) tissues were determined using the Oncomine cancer microarray database and integrated data-mining platform 68 . A p-value of \u22640.05 was considered to be significant for all the analyses. Validation of in silico target genes of miR-152-3p. LNCaP (300,000 cells/well) were plated in a 6 well plate for treatment with miR-152-3p and negative control mimics for 72 hours as described above for the collection of cell lysates (Norgen). This was followed by RNA extraction (Norgen), cDNA synthesis (Life Technologies) and qRT-PCR (Life Technologies) to determine the relative fold expression of target genes of miR-152-3p using target-specific primers (Sigma). Data was normalised to the housekeeping gene RPL32 and further normalised relative to the non-targeting negative control to determine relative fold expression. The differences in target gene expression between the negative control and miR-152-3p treated cells were assessed using an Unpaired t test, N = 3 (*p \u2264 0.05, **p \u2264 0.01, ***p \u2264 0.001 and ****p \u2264 0.0001).",

(b) Overexpression of miR-152-3p also increased migration in LNCaP cells (p = 0.0084) measured as an increase in percentage relative wound density. (c) An increase in proliferation was accompanied by a change in morphology in miR-152-3p treated LNCaP cells when compared to non-targeting negative control treated cells. (d) LNCaP cells were grown to form a confluent monolayer before scratches were made and wound healing was measured by the IncuCyte system. Both the functional assays were performed for a period of 72 hours and data was collected at every 2 hour time point throughout the experiments.
