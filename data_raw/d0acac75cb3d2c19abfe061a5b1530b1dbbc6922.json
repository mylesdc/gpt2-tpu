To help resolve this debate, we design new network-based approaches and apply them to get new insight into biological function and disease. We hypothesize that BC genes have a topologically central (TC) role in the human PPI network. We propose two different concepts of topological centrality. We design a new centrality measure to capture complex wirings of proteins in the network that identifies as TC those proteins that reside in dense extended network neighborhoods. Also, we use the notion of domination and find dominating sets (DSs) in the PPI network, i.e., sets of proteins such that every protein is either in the DS or is a neighbor of the DS. Clearly, a DS has a TC role, as it enables efficient communication between different network parts. We find statistically significant enrichment in BC genes of TC nodes and outperform the existing methods indicating that genes involved in key biological processes occupy topologically complex and dense regions of the network and correspond to its ''spine'' that connects all other network parts and can thus pass cellular signals efficiently throughout the network. To our knowledge, this is the first study that explores domination in the context of PPI networks.",

Examples include social, technological, transportation, information, financial, ecological, chemical, and biological systems. We focus on molecular interaction networks, with the goal of understanding complex cellular functioning by studying cells as inter-connected systems rather than as a collection of individual constituents [1] . Nodes in these networks represent biomolecules, such as genes, proteins, or metabolites, and edges connecting the nodes indicate functional, physical, or chemical interactions between the corresponding biomolecules. Since proteins execute the genetic code and carry out most biological processes, we focus on proteinprotein interaction (PPI) networks.

            "text": "We have been witnessing the exponential growth of the amounts of available PPI network data, along with the development of computational approaches for studying and modeling of these data. High-throughput screens for interaction bacterial or viral pathogens (e.g., HIV, herpesvirus, hepatitis, and influenza), exhibit some ''topological centrality'' compared to the rest of the proteins in the PPI network [1, [28] [29] [30] [31] [33] [34] [35] . Many approaches have focused on examining only simple topological properties of these proteins, such as their direct neighborhoods in a PPI network. For example, the key assumption of many studies is that proteins that are direct neighbors are more likely to perform the same function than those that are not [25, 26] , or that a neighbor of a disease-causing gene is likely to cause either the same or a similar disease [1, 34] . Another example is the observed correlation between a protein's essentiality and its degree centrality (the larger the degree of a node, the more ''degree-central'' the node) in a PPI network of baker's yeast [36] . However, the controversy arose in the light of newer and more complete PPI network data for which this correlation was not observed [37, 38] and it appears to hold only for literature-curated [39] and smaller in scope Y2H PPI networks [3] , possibly because these data sets are biased towards essential proteins [38] . Also, degree alone might be a weak measure of network topology, as it captures limited network topology, i.e., only direct neighborhood of a node [27, 31, 40] . A similar controversy arose when cancer genes were initially shown to have greater connectivities and centralities compared to non-cancer genes, indicating central roles of cancer genes within the interactome [33] , but it was later demonstrated that most of disease genes do not show a tendency to code for proteins that are hubs [29] , although a recent study again reached the conclusion that cancer proteins have different network topologies, e.g., higher degrees, than ''control'' genes [35] . Apart from this, general conclusions are that disease genes have high connectivity and are centrally positioned within the PPI network [1] . In addition, it has been suggested that aging genes tend to have higher degrees than non-aging ones [41, 42] , as well as that the majority of viral and bacterial pathogens show tendency to interact with high-degree proteins, or with ''bottleneck'' proteins that are central to many paths in the PPI network [43] .",

            "text": "In addition, we have recently designed a graphlet-based measure of network topology; graphlets are small induced subgraphs of a large network [46, 47] . As opposed to partial subgraphs (e.g., network motifs [48] ), graphlets are induced, meaning that they contain all edges between the nodes of the subgraph that are present in the large network. This measure generalizes the degree of a node that counts the number of edges that the node touches, where an edge is the only 2-node subgraph, into the graphlet degree vector (GDV) that counts the number of different graphlets that the node touches, for all 2-5-node graphlets. Hence, GDV of a node describes the topology of its up to 4-deep neighborhood. This is an effective measure: going to distance of 4 around a node captures a large portion of a network due to the small-world nature of many real networks [49] . For this reason, and since the number of graphlets on n nodes increases exponentially with n, we believe that using larger graphlets would unnecessarily increase the computational complexity of the method. We designed the similarity measure between GDVs of different nodes, GDVsimilarity, to quantify the topological similarity of the extended neighborhoods of two nodes. We used this constraining measure of network topological similarity to demonstrate that: in PPI networks, biological function of a protein and its local network structure are closely related [27, 50] ; from topology of PPI networks we can extract biological information that cannot always be extracted from sequence and hence, topology could be used as a complementary method to sequence-based methods for homology detection [51] ; topology around cancer and non-cancer genes is different and can be used to successfully predict new cancer genes in melanogenesis-related pathways [31, 40] ; purely topological network alignments can be used to extract protein function and species phylogeny [52, 53] .",

We aim to further study and understand currently poorly described mechanisms by which ''biologically central'' genes interact with each other and with other genes in the cell. We define as biologically central (BC) the genes that belong to one of the following four gene categories: aging (A) genes, cancer (C) genes, HIV-interacting (HIV) genes, and pathogen-interacting (PI) genes. Our hypothesis is that BC genes, i.e., their protein products (henceforth, we use terms ''gene'' and ''protein'' interchangeably), will have a topologically central role in the human PPI network. We use two different concepts to define ''topological centrality'': graphlet degree centrality and domination (defined below).",

Here, we propose a new centrality measure, graphlet degree centrality (GDC), to measure the density and complexity of nodes' neighborhoods by counting the number of different graphlets that the node touches. According to GDC, nodes in dense and complex 4-deep neighborhoods will have higher centralities than nodes in sparse 4-deep neighborhoods. GDC is a different and more constraining measure of network topology than the degree centrality (DC), as illustrated in Figure 1 : GDC ranks highly a low-degree gene if its 4-deep neighborhood is dense and gives a low rank to a high-degree gene if its 4-deep neighborhood is sparse (details are below). GDC is conceptually different than the betweenness centrality (BWC), which does not measure topological denseness at all. Subgraph centrality (SC) measures the number of closed walks (which can be thought of as partial subgraphs) that the node touches and it has been shown to be more highly correlated with the lethality of proteins in the PPI network of baker's yeast than DC [44] . Unlike SC, GDC counts induced subgraphs rather than partial ones and in a more rigorous way: while SC counts an edge that a node touches many times, as a 2-edge closed walk (going from node A to node B along edge AB and returning from B to A along the same edge), as a 4-edge closed walk (going from node A to node B and back to A twice), as a 6edge closed walk (going from A to B and back to A three times) etc., GDC counts the edge only once and only as an edge, rather than as different subgraph structures.",

We find that: (1) enrichments in BC genes of the most GDC-central genes are much higher than those of non-GDC-central genes, (2) the observed enrichments in BC genes of the most GDC-central genes are statistically significant, while those of non-GDC-central genes are not, (3) BC genes that are GDC-central have higher and statistically significant enrichments in known drug targets than BC genes that are non-GDC-central, and (4) GDC is at least as discriminative as the next best centrality measure.",

The field of telecommunications and the domain of the efficient design of routing protocols for wireless networks in particular, uses the notion of a dominating set (DS) to find the most central set of nodes in wireless networks that would be used for efficient data routing and lead to bandwidth increase and energy savings; in wireless networks, nodes correspond to computers and routers, and edges correspond to links between them [54] [55] [56] [57] . A dominating set of a network is a set of nodes such that every node in the network is either in the DS or is a direct neighbor of a node in the DS. Hence, the nodes in the dominating set act as a ''gateway'' in the network, since all nodes in the network are at most one step away from them and the transfer of the information to all nodes can be quick and cheap. The challenge is to identify a minimum order DS, a DS of the minimum size (i.e., the minimum number of nodes). This problem is NP-hard. Thus, approximate (heuristic) algorithms are sought.",

We test this by constructing a connected dominating set in the human PPI network with an algorithm that is commonly used in telecommunications [57] . We are interested in connected DSs only since signaling pathways are connected. Other algorithms for finding connected DSs are used in telecommunications as well (e.g., [54, 56, 58, 59] ), but are not applicable to biological networks, because they require nodes to be assigned meaningful numerical IDs, e.g., IP addresses in computer networks; clearly, proteins in PPI networks do not have numerically meaningful labels. Also, several algorithms for finding disconnected (i.e., independent; see Methods) DSs exist [60, 61] , but they are inappropriate for our study for the above mentioned reasons. In addition to applying the existing DS algorithm of Rai et al. [57] , we design a new and simpler DS algorithm that outperforms the algorithm of Rai et al. on our data (explained below). Note that the main focus of this study is not to create a state-of-the-art algorithm for finding DSs, but instead, to demonstrate, as a proof of concept, that a DS of a PPI network found by a very simple algorithm indeed captures biologically vital proteins. Any further algorithmic improvements are likely to yield more optimal DSs and hence improve the biological results.",

Alternatively, DC can be normalized by dividing the degree with n{1, where n is the number of nodes in the network. Betweenness centrality (BWC) of a node is the sum, over all node pairs i and j in the network, of the percentage of all shortest paths between i and j in the network that go through the node of interest. Subgraph centrality (SC) of a node is a weighted sum of the numbers of all closed walks of different lengths in the network starting and ending at the node. These closed walks are related to partial subgraphs of a network, e.g., a closed walk with four nodes can ''go through'' different subgraphs on four nodes, such as along the same edge AB twice (as described above: from node A to node B along edge AB, then back to A along the same edge and then again from A to B and back to A along the same edge), or along a 4-node cycle ABCD that includes edge AB (along the ''square'' from node A to node B to node C to node D and back to A; this is regardless of whether edges CA and DB that ''go along the diagonal of the square'' exist) etc. The above mentioned sum is weighted so that the contribution of the closed walks decreases as the length of the walks increases, i.e., shorter walks (smaller subgraphs) have higher weight.",

Graphlets are small, connected, induced, non-isomorphic subgraphs of a large network (Figure 3 A) [46, 47] . Previously, we generalized the degree of a node, that counted how many edges the node touched, into the graphlet degree vector (GDV), that counted how many graphlets of a given type, such as a triangle or a square, the node touched (Figure 3 B) [27] . In Figure 3 B, this is illustrated by a node being touched by an edge (the leftmost illustration), a triangle (the middle illustration), or a square (the rightmost illustration). More precisely, coordinates of a GDV count how many times a node is touched by a particular symmetry group (automorphism orbit, see [47] for details) within a graphlet (Figure 3 B) . Clearly, the degree of a node is the first coordinate in GDV, since an edge is the only 2-node graphlet. There is a total of 73 orbits in all 2-5-node graphlets. Thus, the GDV of a node, describing its up to 4-deep neighborhood (i.e., 2-5-node graphlets around it), has 73 coordinates [27] . An example of a GDV of a node that contains all 73 orbits can be found in [52] .",

We call this algorithm ''DS-RAI''. It consists of three phases: (1) constructing an independent DS named S, (2) finding a set of nodes C(V \\S to connect nodes in S by constructing the Steiner tree between the nodes in S, and (3) pruning the DS defined on nodes S|C to reduce the number of nodes in the DS. More specifically, the algorithm works as follows. In phase 1, each node is colored white. A white node u that is connected to most other white nodes is taken from V , colored black meaning that it is a ''dominator,'' and added to S. All neighboring nodes of u are colored gray meaning that they are ''dominatees'' and added to V \\S. Previous steps are repeated on the remaining white nodes in V until all nodes of V are either colored black and added to S, or colored gray and added to V \\S. In phase 2, a gray node from V \\S that is connected to the largest number of black nodes in S is selected, colored dark gray meaning it is a ''connector,'' and added to C. The algorithm then checks whether node set S|C is connected and if so, it stops; otherwise, the algorithm selects the next gray node from V \\S that is connected to the largest number of black nodes in S and repeats the entire process until node set S|C becomes connected. In phase 3, ''redundant'' nodes are deleted from the connected DS defined on S|C to reduce its size as follows. Let G\u00bdV ' denote a subgraph of G induced on a subset of nodes V '(V . The algorithm selects a node u with the minimum degree in G\u00bdS|C and checks whether the DS defined on S|C\\fug remains a Figure 3 . Graphlets, automorphism orbits, and GDVs.

If so, the node u is removed from S|C. Otherwise, it remains in S|C. This is repeated for all nodes in S|C, in the order of their increasing degrees. The node set resulting from node removals from S|C in step 3 is the final DS produced by DS-RAI algorithm. An illustration is presented in Figure 4 A.",

An illustration is presented in Figure 4 B. Clearly, DS-DC is much simpler than DS-RAI. Also, as illustrated in Figure 4 , DS-DC results in a smaller DS than DS-RAI (the same holds for real-world PPI networks, as demonstrated in Section 0). Finally, we introduce a modification of DS-DC in which nodes from S are visited in order of their increasing GDCs instead of degrees, which we call ''DS-GDC'' algorithm.",

For example, we measure how many cancer genes (C) are in the top 1%, the top 2%, the top 3% etc. most central genes with respect to each of the four centrality measures. We do the same for aging (A), HIV, and PI genes. For a given centrality measure, BC gene category, and k, we quantify the accuracy of the centrality measure in capturing BC genes by computing precision and recall. Precision can be seen as a measure of exactness: it is the percentage of the top k% of the most central genes that are BC genes. Recall can be seen as a measure of completeness: it is the percentage of BC genes of the network that are in the top k% of the most central genes. We need to determine a threshold for k that results in the best combination of precision and recall. Since when varying the values of k, every decrease in precision corresponds to increase in recall, we choose as the threshold for k the point where precision and recall cross ( Figure 5 ). We do this for each of the four centrality measures and each of the four BC gene categories. If the threshold is found to be K, we denote as ''central'' those genes that are amongst the top K% of the most central genes and as ''non-central'' all the remaining genes in the network.

We find that with respect to GDC, enrichments in each of the four BC gene categories are much higher for central genes, ranging between 23.5% and 36.4%, than enrichments for [57] , and the authors describe the algorithm as follows. In phase 1, nodes 1, 4, 8, 12, and 16 are colored black as members of an independent DS. In phase 2, nodes 2, 9, and 11 are colored dark grey as connectors that connect nodes in the independent DS resulting from phase 1. In phase 3, the connected DS resulting from phase 2 is pruned to reduce it size by removing node 16 from the DS (no other nodes can be removed without violating the requirement of producing a connected DS of the graph). In panel B, all nodes are initially in the DS and then nodes are visited in order of their increasing degrees and removed from the DS if the resulting DS is a valid connected DS of the graph. That is, nodes are removed in the following order: 3, 16, 2, 4, 7, 10, 13, 14, 15, and 9. The resulting DS therefore contains the remaining nodes: 1, 5, 6, 8, 11, and 12.

These enrichments are statistically significant for central genes, with p-values\u019210 {11 , while for non-central genes they are not, with p-values~1 (see Methods). As expected, if we choose lower k, e.g., 1%, precision is even higher (although recall is lower): out of the top 1%~91 of the most GDC-central proteins in the network, 55% (i.e., 47 of them) are aging genes, 45% (i.e., 41 of them) are cancer genes, 71.5% (i.e., 65 of them) are HIV genes, and 42.9% (i.e., 39 of them) are PI genes (Figure 7) . Also, we measure the enrichment in drug targets of BC genes (i.e., of each of the four BC gene categories: ''A'', ''C'', ''HIV'', and ''PI'' defined above) that are GDC-central and of BC genes that are non-GDC-central. We hypothesize that higher GDC of nodes in the PPI network reflects their functional importance. Proteins that are targeted by drugs are clearly functionally important. Hence, we examine whether the sets of BC genes that are GDC-central contain more drug targets than the sets of BC genes that are non-GDC-central. Indeed, we find that enrichments in drug targets are higher for BC genes that are GDC-central than for BC genes that are non-GDC-central (Figure 6 B) . Furthermore, these enrichments in drug targets are statistically significant for GDC-central BC genes (with the exception of GDC-central HIV genes), with p-values\u01920:047, while for non-GDC-central BC genes they are not, with p-values \u00a70:9 (see Methods).",

As shown in Figure 6 C, GDC is at least as good as other centrality measures for all categories of BC genes, except for cancer genes, for which SC has a slightly higher enrichment, but GDC still outperforms DC and BC. GDC always outperforms DC, confirming our hypothesis that GDC, as a more constraining measure of network topology, could capture the biological signal better. SC also outperforms DC for aging genes, but interestingly not for HIV and PI genes.

The results obtained from AUPRs corresponding to different centrality measures are mostly consistent with the results obtained at selected thresholds where precision and recall cross (described above): for HIV and PI genes, AUPRs for GDC are the highest, followed by AUPRs for DC, SC, and BWC, respectively; for A and C genes, AUPRs for SC are the highest, followed by AUPRs for GDC, DC, and BWC, respectively. Hence, as was the case for individual thresholds (see above), GDC always outperforms DC, while SC outperforms DC only for A and C genes. Hence, GDC is always more discriminative than DC, while SC is not always more discriminative than DC, even though SC captures a deeper network topology compared to DC. The values of AUPRs for GDC are: 0.27 for A, 0.2 for C, 0.34 for HIV, and 0.2 for PI genes. These somewhat law values are not surprising, since in biological applications, the number of positive examples (here, the known BC genes) is much smaller than the number of negative examples (here, all proteins in the network that are currently not known to be BC genes). Furthermore, we do not know true negatives (genes that are true non-BC genes). Since we expect that many currently unreported BC genes will turn out to be BC genes in the future, AUPRs are likely to increase as this happens. Moreover, the observed AUPRs are statistically significant: we compute, at each value of recall, the probability of observing a given precision and we find that the probabilities of observing a given number of BC genes among k% of randomly chosen genes are in the range 0:03{10 {13 for k up to 90% (clearly, for k close to 100%, results become statistically insignificant, which is expected, since we choose as GDC-central all genes in the network).",

Its degree is 145 and it is ranked as the top 20 th gene with respect to DC. Both proteins have the same GDC and are ranked as top 92 nd genes with respect to GDC. Hence, GDC rewards the ranking of a low-degree gene if its 4-deep neighborhood is dense (ZAP90) and penalizes the ranking of a high-degree gene if its 4-deep neighborhood is sparse (PRKACA).
