            "text": "Background: Although modified live virus (MLV) vaccines are commonly used for porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) control, there have been safety concerns due to the quick reversion of MLV to virulence during replication in pigs. Previous studies have demonstrated that mutant viruses emerged from lethal mutagenesis driven by antiviral mutagens and that those viruses had higher genetic stability compared to their parental strains because they acquired resistance to random mutation. Thus, this strategy was explored to stabilize the PRRSV genome in the current study. Results: Four antiviral mutagens (ribavirin, 5-fluorouracil, 5-azacytidine, and amiloride) were evaluated for their antiviral effects against VR2332, a prototype of type 2 PRRSV. Among the mutagens, ribavirin and 5-fluorouracil had significant antiviral effects against VR2332. Consequently, VR2332 was serially passaged in MARC-145 cells in the presence of ribavirin at several concentrations to facilitate the emergence of ribavirin-resistant mutants. Two ribavirin-resistant mutants, RVRp13 and RVRp22, emerged from serial passages in the presence of 0.1 and 0.2 mM ribavirin, respectively. The genetic stability of these resistant mutants was evaluated in MARC-145 cells and compared with VR2332. As expected, the ribavirin-resistant mutants exhibited higher genetic stability compared to their parental virus. Conclusions: In summary, ribavirin and 5-fluorouracil effectively suppressed PRRSV replication in MARC-145 cells. However, ribavirin-resistant mutants emerged when treated with low concentrations (\u22640.2 mM) of ribavirin, and those mutants were genetically more stable during serial passages in cell culture.",

            "text": "Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS) is one of the most economically important infectious diseases of swine worldwide. The annual loss associated with PRRS to the United States swine industry has been estimated to be approximately 664 million USD [1] . PRRS virus (PRRSV), the etiological agent of PRRS, is classified as a member of the Arteriviridae virus family, along with equine arteritis virus (EAV), lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV) of mice, and simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV), and belongs to the order Nidovirales [2, 3] . PRRSV is a small, enveloped virus that contains a single-stranded, non-segmented, positive-sense RNA genome approximately 15 kb in length. The PRRSV genome encodes at least ten open reading frames (ORFs) designated as ORF1a, ORF1b, ORF2a, ORF2b, ORF3, ORF4, ORF5a, ORF5, ORF6, and ORF7 [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . Because PRRSV evolves very quickly [9, 10] , there is a great deal of genetic variability among PRRSV strains. In general, PRRSV strains are grouped into European (type 1) and North American (type 2) genotypes [11] [12] [13] , but high levels of genetic variability still exist among viruses, even within the same genotype [10, 14, 15] , which results in suboptimal cross-protection between different PRRSV strains and becomes a significant impediment to the development of effective vaccines. Modified live virus (MLV) vaccines have been most commonly used to control PRRSV because they confer better protection against homologous virus strains compared to inactivated or recombinant vaccines [16] . However, there have been serious safety concerns about using these MLV vaccines because they quickly revert to virulence during serial passages in pigs [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . Therefore, it is important to develop a new strategy to stabilize the PRRSV genome during virus replication for the purpose of vaccine safety.",

These mutagens increase the mutation frequency of RNA viruses above a tolerable error threshold during replication, ultimately driving viral infection into extinction [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] . Amiloride hydrochloride hydrate (hereafter \"amiloride\") is another antiviral drug with efficacy against many RNA viruses, including rhinovirus, coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3), coronaviruses, flaviviruses, and retroviruses [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] . Moreover, it has been demonstrated that amiloride increases the mutation frequency of RNA viruses, in addition to its other antiviral activities [41] . It has also been demonstrated that mutant viruses that emerged following sequential passages of HCV, CVB3, poliovirus, and FMDV [41] [42] [43] [44] in the presence of ribavirin had higher genetic stability than wild-type viruses. Therefore, this strategy was employed to select a mutagen-resistant strain of PRRSV that would have higher genetic stability. In the current study, the effects of four mutagens (ribavirin, 5-fluorouracil, 5-azacytidine, and amiloride) on PRRSV replication in MARC-145 cells were evaluated to select the mutagen that is most effective against PRRSV. Then, mutagen-resistant viruses were rescued after sequential passages in the presence of the mutagen and were evaluated for their genetic stability during additional sequential passages in cell culture systems.",

            "text": "In the current study, the possibility of rescuing a genetically stable PRRSV mutant during sequential passages in MARC-145 cells in the presence of mutagens was explored on the basis of previous reports that showed that mutant viruses that emerged from lethal mutagenesis driven by antiviral mutagens exhibited higher genetic stability than wild-type viruses [35, 41, 43] . To choose the most appropriate mutagen for the study, four different antiviral mutagens (ribavirin, 5-fluorouracil, 5-azacytidine, and amiloride) were evaluated for their antiviral effects against PRRSV and for their cytotoxicity in MARC-145 cells. In the presence of ribavirin at concentrations higher than 0.2 mM, the replication of VR2332 was completely suppressed, whereas even at the highest concentration, 1.5 mM, ribavirin did not cause significant cytotoxicity in MARC-145 cells {Figure 1 (A and B) }. This result is in good agreement with previous studies conducted to evaluate the antiviral effects of ribavirin on several RNA viruses, including HCV, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), poliovirus, FMDV, and Influenza A and B viruses [28, 30, 32, 33, 42, [55] [56] [57] . Recently, ribavirin was reported as a potential antiviral drug against PRRSV because it reduced virus replication approximately 100 times in PAM-pCD163 cells when added at a concentration of 0.05 mM, which was the highest concentration applied in the study [58] . However, in the current study, 0.05 mM ribavirin failed to suppress PRRSV replication in MARC-145 cells, and concentrations higher than 0.2 mM ribavirin were required for complete suppression of PRRSV replication (Figure 2 ). Unlike the results observed in PAM-pCD163 cells, no significant cytotoxicity was observed in MARC-145 cells, even when treated with 1.5 mM ribavirin. Thus, ribavirin-resistant mutant viruses were rescued in the presence of ribavirin at concentrations as high as 0.1 and 0.2 mM. Similarly, 5-fluorouracil effectively suppressed VR2332 replication in MARC-145 cells at concentrations ranging from 0.2 to 1 mM without causing significant cytotoxicity {Figure 1 (C and D)}. The effective antiviral activity of 5-fluorouracil has also been reported for rift valley fever virus, vesicular stomatitis virus, poliovirus, and FMDV [26, [59] [60] [61] [62] [63] . In contrast, 5azacytidine or amiloride at concentrations between 1 and 1.5 mM induced significant cytotoxicity in MARC-145 cells, although concentrations of 5-azacytidine or amiloride lower than 1 mM showed substantial antiviral efficacy against PRRSV {Figure 1 (E and F) and Figure 1 (G and H)}. A previous study reported that 1 mM 5azacytidine caused significant cytotoxicity in 293 T and U373-MAGI CXCR4 cells 24 hours after treatment [46] although a significant level of antiviral activity against HIV-1 was reported with 5-azacytidine at concentrations between 1 \u03bcM and 100 \u03bcM [45, 46] . However, low concentrations (<0.1 mM) of 5-azacytidine did not result in significant antiviral activity against PRRSV in the current study (data not shown). A previous study reported that 1 mM amiloride was non-cytotoxic in HeLa T cells for 48 hours post-treatment [38] , which conflicts with the results observed in this study showing that substantial cytotoxicity was observed with 1-1.5 mM amiloride in MARC-145 cells at 36 hours post-treatment {Figure 1 (H)}. It was speculated that this dissimilarity might be due to the different origins of the cell lines used in the studies. Based on the initial assessment of antiviral mutagens, ribavirin was selected for further study to evaluate the possible emergence of ribavirin-resistant mutants because it showed the greatest effect on PRRSV replication without causing significant cytotoxicity even at the highest concentration (1.5 mM). Two ribavirin-resistant mutants (RVRp13 and RVRp22) were isolated at passages 13 and 22 during serial passages of VR2332 in MARC-145 cells in the presence of 0.1 and 0.2 mM ribavirin, respectively ( Figure 2 ). Previous studies also reported the emergence of ribavirin-resistant mutants: ribavirinresistant HCV emerged after 7 passages in Huh7D cells cultured with 0.25 mM ribavirin [42] . Similarly, ribavirinresistant CVB3, poliovirus, and FMDV emerged after sequential passages in HeLa or BHK-21 cells cultured with 0.05-0.8 mM ribavirin [41, 43, 44] .",

            "text": "The growth competence of the ribavirin-resistant mutants RVRp13 and RVRp22 in MARC-145 cells was assessed in the presence or absence of ribavirin. Both of the ribavirin-resistant mutants showed approximately 10-100-times higher replication efficiency than VR2332 in the presence of 0.1 or 0.2 mM ribavirin. Moreover, the replication of VR2332 was completely suppressed at concentrations higher than 0.2 mM ribavirin, while both mutants were able to generate infectious progeny viruses, reaching titers close to 10 3 TCID 50 /ml in the presence of 0.5 mM ribavirin ( Figure 3 ). As reported in many previous studies conducted with poliovirus [43] , human enterovirus 71 (HEV71) [64] , FMDV [65, 66] , coxsackie virus B3 [41] and HCV [42] , enhanced resistance of mutant viruses to ribavirin might be associated with the increased genetic fidelity that is acquired during viral passages in the presence of ribavirin. However, the higher replication efficiency might also result from virus adaptation to MARC-145 cells because the mutant viruses were rescued after 13 or 22 sequential passages. In fact, the mutant viruses replicated more efficiently in the Table 2 Mutation frequencies of plaque-cloned, ribavirin-resistant mutants (RVRp13-P and RVRp22-P) and VR2332-p after 10 passages in MARC-145 cells absence of ribavirin compared to VR2332. Therefore, the genetic stability of the ribavirin-resistant mutants was assessed by passaging the mutant viruses 10 times in MARC-145 cells without ribavirin in parallel with VR2332 to demonstrate that ribavirin-resistant mutants have increased genetic stability. The most variable genes (nsp2 and ORF5) in the PRRSV genome were sequenced to determine the mutation frequency of the viruses during sequential passages. RVRp13 and RVRp22 virus clones exhibited 1.8-and 3.4-fold lower numbers of nucleotide substitutions and 1.4-and 4-fold lower numbers of amino acid substitutions, respectively, in the nsp2 region compared with VR2332 virus clones {Table 2 and Figure 4 (A)}. In the ORF5 region, the RVRp13 virus clones exhibited mutation rates similar to those observed in VR2332 virus clones, while RVRp22 virus clones had approximately 8.5-fold lower numbers of nucleotide substitutions and 8-fold lower numbers of amino acid substitutions compared with VR2332 virus clones {Table 2 and Figure 4 (B)}. Based on these results, it was concluded that the ribavirin-resistant mutants, especially RVRp22, have significantly higher genetic stability compared with their parental virus, VR2332.",

            "text": "In conclusion, ribavirin was very effective in suppressing PRRSV replication in MARC-145 cells at concentrations higher than 0.2 mM, suggesting that ribavirin could be used as a therapeutic drug against PRRSV; however, its potential usefulness against PRRSV infection remains to be confirmed in animal studies. As described in the current study, the resistant viruses emerged in the presence of low concentrations (<0.2 mM) of ribavirin, and those resistant viruses had significantly higher genetic stability compared with VR2332. Because rapid reversion of attenuated PRRS vaccines to virulence is of great concern, RVRp22, which has a higher level of genetic stability, could be a good candidate for the development of a safer vaccine. Nonetheless, the mechanisms and genetic determinants responsible for the high genetic stability of ribavirin-resistant PRRSV should be elucidated in detail in the near future. In vitro assessment of the genetic stability of ribavirin-resistant PRRSV mutants during serial passages in cells. The genetic stability of the plaque-purified, ribavirin-resistant mutants (RVRp13-P and RVRp22-P) was compared with that of plaque-purified VR2332 (VR2332-p) over 10 passages in MARC-145 cells. Fifteen viral clones obtained from cell culture fluids collected at the completion of 10 passages of each virus by plaque purification and nsp2 (A) and ORF5 (B) regions of each virus clone were sequenced and compared with their parental viruses (RVRp13-P, RVRp22-P, and VR2332-p) to determine nucleotide mutations (a) and amino acid (b) substitutions during the sequential passages. Asterisks represent significant differences in the mutation rate compared with VR2332 (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.001).",

Similarly, 5-fluorouracil suppressed VR2332 replication in a dosedependent manner: the rate of VR2332 replication decreased approximately 100-fold or more than 1000-fold in the presence of 0.2 or 1 mM 5-fluorouracil, respectively. No significant cytotoxicity was observed with up to 1.5 mM 5-fluorouracil {Figure 1 (C and D)}. However, significant levels of cytotoxicity were observed with 1 and 1.5 mM azacytidine at 48 hours post-treatment, although VR2332 replication was significantly suppressed when at least 0.1 mM 5-azacytidine was included in the culture medium {Figure 1 (E and F)}. No significant antiviral activity against VR2332 was measured at low concentrations (<0.1 mM) of 5-azacytidine (data not shown). Similarly, high concentrations (1 and 1.5 mM) of amiloride also caused significant cytotoxicity in MARC-145 cells after 36 hours post-treatment {Figure 1 (H)}; however, VR2332 replication was suppressed by amiloride in a dose-dependent manner and was completely suppressed by more than 0.6 mM amiloride {Figure 1 (G)}. Based on these results, ribavirin was selected for further experiments because it was most effective at suppressing PRRSV replication without causing significant cytotoxicity in MARC-145 cells.Emergence of ribavirin-resistant mutants after serial passage of PRRSV in MARC-145 cells in the presence of ribavirinVR2332 was serially passaged in MARC-145 cells in the presence of ribavirin at concentrations of 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5, and 0.7 mM. Although 0.05 mM ribavirin failed to mediate significant suppression of VR2332 replication, concentrations of 0.1 and 0.2 mM ribavirin were able to suppress virus replication to undetectable levels based on a virus titration assay at passage 2. However, virus replication started to resume at passages 5 and 17 in the presence of 0.1 and 0.2 mM ribavirin, respectively. The reemerging viruses maintained increasing progeny virus production in successive passages, and two virus strains, RVRp13 and RVRp22, were recovered at passages 13 and 22 in the presence of 0.1 and 0.2 mM ribavirin, respectively. Ribavirin doses greater than or equal to 0.3 mM completely suppressed the replication of VR2332 below the detection limit of the virus titration assay for all 22 passages (Figure 2). Growth kinetics of ribavirin-resistant mutants in the presence of ribavirin at several concentrations RVRp13 and RVRp22 were evaluated for their resistance to ribavirin by assessing their growth competence in MARC-145 cells in the presence of several concentrations (0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 mM) of ribavirin, compared to the growth competence of the parental virus, VR2332.",
