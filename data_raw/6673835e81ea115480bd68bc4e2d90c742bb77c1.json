            "text": "Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) is a novel swine enteropathogenic coronavirus with worldwide distribution. PDCoV belongs to the Deltacoronavirus (DCoV) genus, which mainly includes avian coronaviruses (CoVs). PDCoV has the potential to infect human and chicken cells in vitro, and also has limited infectivity in calves. However, the origin of PDCoV in pigs, the host range, and cross-species infection of PDCoV still remain unclear. To determine whether PDCoV really has the ability to infect chickens in vivo, the three lines of chicken embryos and specific pathogen free (SPF) chickens were inoculated with PDCoV HNZK-02 strain to investigate PDCoV infection in the current study. Our results indicated that PDCoV can infect chicken embryos and could be continuously passaged on them. Furthermore, we observed that PDCoV-inoculated chickens showed mild diarrhea symptoms and low fecal viral RNA shedding. PDCoV RNA could also be detected in multiple organs (lung, kidney, jejunum, cecum, and rectum) and intestinal contents of PDCoV-inoculated chickens until 17 day post-inoculation by real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR). A histology analysis indicated that PDCoV caused mild lesions in the lung, kidney, and intestinal tissues. These results prove the susceptibility of chickens to PDCoV infection, which might provide more insight about the cross-species transmission of PDCoV.",

Deltacoronavirus (DCoV) genus was mainly discovered in a variety of avian species and pigs [4, 5] . Porcine DCoV (PDCoV) was first detected in pigs during a molecular surveillance of CoVs in mammals and birds in Hong Kong in 2012 [5] , while the first PDCoV outbreak in swine herds was reported in 2014 in the United States [6] [7] [8] . Thereafter, PDCoV was rapidly identified in many countries, including China, Canada, South Korea, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Thailand, and Vietnam [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . PDCoV can cause severe diarrhoea, vomiting, and dehydration in suckling and nursing piglets, and the clinical symptoms are indistinguishable",

PDCoV is a novel swine intestine CoV and may have a broad host range [25] . However, it is still unclear whether PDCoV can infect avian species, including chickens and other poultry. In this study, we first inoculated the PDCoV HNZK-02 strain into three kinds of chicken embryos, and then the susceptibility of SPF chickens to PDCoV infection was investigated. Our study demonstrated that PDCoV can infect chicken embryos, and could be passaged on them. Moreover, SPF chickens intragastrically inoculated with the PDCoV strain HNZK-02 to develop a mild infection with persistent PDCoV RNA shedding in tissues and intestinal contents, and also showed mild intestinal lesions and clinical disease. Our results indicated that chickens are susceptible to PDCoV infection, but do not present with clinical signs, which might provide more insight about the cross-species transmission of PDCoV.",

            "text": "To further evaluate whether PDCoV can infect and propagate in chickens, the SPF chickens were inoculated with the PDCoV HNZK-02 strain. These SPF chickens showed mild diarrhea symptoms and shed PDCoV RNAs in intestinal contents and tissues until 17 dpi, indicating that PDCoV could persistently infect SPF chickens. Furthermore, PDCoV-specific viral RNA was also detected in fecal samples until 6 dpi. Previous reports showed that PDCoV can infect gnotobiotic and conventional piglets, and caused severe atrophic enteritis characterized by severe watery diarrhea and vomiting [22] . However, PDCoV-infected pigs appeared to shed less PDCoV RNA titer in the feces when compared with the inoculated viral titer [21, 22] , implying a potentially lower replication rate of PDCoV in the gastrointestinal tract of pigs. In addition, a comparable low viral RNA titer was detected from fecal samples of gnotobiotic calves challenged with PDCoV [25] , which also suggested that there was a lower replication of PDCoV in the intestine of calves. These findings raise the possibility that PDCoV is susceptible to piglets, calves, and chickens, but it may not yet be completely adapted to these animals. Studies are needed to investigate if the mortality of PDCoV infection in chickens could be increased by serially passaging PDCoV in chickens.",

In this study, our results indicated that PDCoV viral RNA was mainly detected in chicken lungs; kidneys; and multiple intestinal tissues, including cecum, jejunum, and rectum, implying that there exhibits an extensive tissue tropism during PDCoV infection in chickens. Collectively, PDCoV could infect the lung tissue in pigs and chickens, suggesting that outside of the gastrointestinal tract, the respiratory tract may also be a target route for PDCoV infection. Further studies are still needed to investigate the exact transmission route of PDCoV in chickens.",

The CoVs S protein is responsible for receptor binding and membrane fusion, and its receptor specificity and binding ability determine the cross-species transmission within the novel host [26] . It is still unknown whether passage PDCoV in chickens could increase its pathogenicity, and it needs to be studied. Further study of spike-receptor interactions may provide new insight into the cross-species transmission event of PDCoV.",

            "text": "PDCoV has become a common swine enteric pathogen with worldwide distribution and may have a potential broad host range, including humans and birds (Figure 7) . To date, all the members of the DCoVs genus except PDCoV have been detected in birds. In our study, we found that the PDCoV can infect chickens, indicating that PDCoV may cross the species barrier from avian/birds to some mammals ( Figure 7) . However, our study can not demonstrate if PDCoV has the ability for direct interspecies transmission between pigs and chickens at present. The aminopeptidase N (APN) is a protein receptor, and is mainly targeted by a number of alphacoronaviruses, including TGEV and Human Coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) [26] . Recent reports also showed that PDCoV can efficiently infect human origin cells via interacting with the human APN receptor [26] , suggesting that there are potential possibilities for PDCoV to cross the species barriers to infect humans (Figure 7) . To define the natural host and/or reservoir of PDCoV, further molecular surveillance study and experiments on artificial infection of different animals with PDCoV are needed to investigate the interspecies transmission of PDCoV. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that chicken embryos and SPF chickens are susceptible to PDCoV infection. PDCoV-inoculated chickens showed low fecal viral RNA shedding, extensive tissue tropism with moderate viral RNA titer, and mild lesions on intestinal tissues. However, there were no obvious clinical symptom in PDCoV-inoculated chickens. These results provide new insight into a novel host range and the cross-species transmission of PDCoV. ",
