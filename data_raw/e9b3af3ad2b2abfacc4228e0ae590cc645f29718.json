Glycyrrhizic acid monoammonium salt was used as the model drug. Drug-loaded microparticles were formulated by ionic crosslinking using sodium tripolyphosphate. The Scanning Electron Microscopic study revealed spherical particles of sizes from 4.9 \u00b1 3.8 \u00b5m to 6.9 \u00b1 3.9 \u00b5m. The FT-IR studies presented a possible interaction between the drug and the polymer. The drug was encapsulated in amorphous form as observed from the powder X-Ray Diffraction studies. A cumulative drug release study was carried out in simulated gastric, intestinal, and colonic fluids. The cumulative drug release studies presented a burst release followed by a sustained release of the drug in simulated colonic fluid containing rat cecal contents. The drug-polymer ratio was optimised using a 3 2 factorial design by taking the amounts of glycyrrhizic acid (X 1 ) and guar gum alkyl amine (X 2 ) as the independant variables. The percent cumulative drug release at 240 mins (Q 240 ), 720 mins (Q 720 ), and at 1,440 mins (Q 1440 ) were considered as the dependant variables. The efficacy of the optimized formulation was studied in a 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid-induced rat colitis model. The tissue's nitric oxide, malondialdehyde, and myeloperoxidase activities were found to be much lower in the microparticle-treated group compared to free drug-treated group. The histology of the colonic tissue from the treated group of animals revealed almost no infiltration of inflammatory cells in the tissue for the microparticletreated group of animals. The synthesized amine derivative of guar gum was found to be better in vitro with a better in vivo efficacy in the colonic delivery of 1102 A.",

            "text": "Inflammatory bowel disease is a common disease among urban populations [1] [2] [3] [4] . Drugs prescribed for the treatment of this disease manifest a large number of side effects. A localised delivery is therefore suitable for the treatment of this disease. The development of polymer-based microspheres, microcapsules, and microbeads are currently the focused area of research for intestinally targeted drug delivery [5] . This also prevents a sudden unwanted higher concentration of the drug in the tissue and maintains controlled release of the drug at the target site. Polysaccharides are mainly used in the design of oral drug delivery devices. The increased adhesion of particles in the thick mucosal zones of inflammation or ulceration is an effective physiological parameter that can be exploited for targeted delivery of the drug encapsulated in the microcarriers [5, 6] . In inflammatory bowel disease, microparticulate drug carriers are expected to accumulate at the sites of inflammation in the colon. Due to effective adhesion to colonic mucosa, these carriers will have enough time to deliver their drug load to the sites of inflammation in the colon. Guar gum obtained from guar flour is a polysaccharide commonly used for designing colontargeted drug delivery devices [7, 8] . Guar gum is metabolised by the colonic microflora that releases its contents specifically to the colon. A newer amine derivative of guar gum has been synthesised from commercially available guar gum. The derivative retains the biological properties of the mother polysaccharide and shows additional properties of the amine group. This makes the polymer positively charged. In our study, this newly synthesised derivative was utilized for the preparation of microparticles. Preparation of guar gum microparticles by the ionic gelation technique using metal ions and glutaraldehyde has been reported earlier [9] [10] [11] . In our current study, we used sodium tripolyphosphate as the crosslinker with guar gum alkyl amine.",

The diffraction pattern of the physical mixtures presented the lowering in peak intensities of the intact drug due to the dilution effect of the polymer and no qualitative differences in the diffraction pattern of the drug. GAMs prepared with GGAA were characterized by the absence of the distinct diffraction peaks of GA and a peak for the polymer at 20.29\u00b0, signifying the entrapment of the drug in amorphous form or its solvation in the polymeric carrier (Fig. 5) . Therefore, the PXRD studies verified the decrease in crystallinity of the drug in the microparticles and the effective entrapment of GA in amorphous form within the polymer matrix. ",

Altogether, nine formulations F1 to F9 were prepared with varying proportions of the polymer and the amount of drug. Fig. 6 , 7, and 8 demonstrate GA release profiles from GAMs in three different mediums of pH 1.2, 6.8, and 7.4 respectively. In the simulated gastric and intestinal fluid, minimum drug release was observed and the rate of drug release was also very slow. In the simulated gastric fluid for formulations F1, F4, and F7, a maximum of only 5% cumulative drug release was observed, whereas for the others it was only about 2%. In the simulated intestinal fluid, only about 10% of the drug was released in the first 600 mins of the study for all nine formulations. In the simulated colonic fluid containing rat cecal contents, the drug release was a bit more augmented with an initial burst release common for each of the designed The results predict the drug-polymer ratio to be the key factor for controlling the release. However, a complex interaction between the drug and polymer molecules or the simple adsorption of the drug molecules on the surface of the polymeric MPs due to electrostatic adhesions may be responsible for the successful entrapment of the drug within the polymer matrix. A minimum drug release in the simulated gastric and intestinal fluid implies a minimal chance of the drug molecule getting adsorbed to the surface of the microparticle, as adsorption of GA on the surface of the microparticle would result in a substantial drug release earlier in the simulated gastric and intestinal fluid. Thus, a proper entrapment of GA might be predicted from the study. The increase in drug release in the simulated colonic fluid was facilitated by the enzymatic degradation of the polymer and by the colonic microflora present in the rat cecal contents. The nature of the release profile predicts the dependence of the cumulative drug release on the drug-polymer ratio. Therefore, the formulation was optimized on the basis of the drug-polymer ratio using a 3 2 factorial design model. ",

Intra-colonic administration of TNBS in 50% ethanol resulted in an inflammatory response characterized by extensive mucosal disruption, linear and deep ulcers, haemorrhage, and sub-mucosal oedema (Fig. 12 ). Diarrhoea and rectal bleeding were evident in all the rats with colitis which were without any treatment. The results of the control groups were compared with the treated groups i.e. GA and GAM treated groups.
