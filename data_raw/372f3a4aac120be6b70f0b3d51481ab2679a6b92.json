The outbreak occurred in a shelter of the Apulia region and involved 37 out of 350 dogs that displayed cough and/or nasal discharge with no evidence of fever. The full-genomic characterisation showed that the causative agent (strain Bari/100-12) was closely related to CnPnVs that have been recently isolated in the USA, as well as to murine pneumovirus, which is responsible for respiratory disease in mice. The present study represents a useful contribution to the knowledge of the pathogenic potential of CnPnV and its association with CIRD in dogs. Further studies will elucidate the pathogenicity and epidemiology of this novel pneumovirus, thus addressing the eventual need for specific vaccines.",

Pest control was carried out only sporadically in the shelter, but there were no systematic measures against rodent and insect populations. Housed dogs were routinely vaccinated against canine parvovirus (CPV), canine distemper (CDV), canine adenoviruses (CAdVs) and Leptospira spp., while no specific vaccine for prophylaxis of CIRD was employed. Respiratory signs were generally mild consisting of cough and/or nasal discharge with no evidence of fever. Haematological parameters were not evaluated. Nasal and pharyngeal swabs were collected from two CIRD-affected mixed-breed dogs, a 7-month-old male and a 3-year-old female. Swabs were immersed in 1.5 ml viral transport medium consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum (FCS), 1000 IU/ml penicillin, 1000 mg/ml streptomycin and 10 mg/ml amphotericin B.",

Consequently, the M2 gene length was re-determined as 928 and 921 nt for MPV isolates 15 and J3666, respectively. In strain Bari/100-12, this gene was 926 nt long and shared a 96.4% and 95.1% nt identity with other CnPnVs and MPVs, respectively. Interestingly, the genetic relatedness was higher to HPMV (46.2% nt identity) than to HRSV/BRSV (44.6-45%). The Pneumovirus M2 gene is usually translated into two proteins, M2-1 and M2-1, from alternative reading frames. In both proteins that were 176 and 98 aa in length, respectively, the Italian CnPnV was more closely related to extant canine viruses than to MPVs (aa identities of 98.9% and 99% in the M2-1 and M2-2 products, respectively). The M2-1 protein showed 2 aa substitutions, whereas the M2-2 product was conserved among CnPnVs. Comparison of the Bari/100-12 large polymerase (L) gene with that of other canine strains was not possible since those sequences have not been determined for CnPnVs. The L gene of CnPnV-Bari/100-12 was 6,333 long showing similar length in comparison with MPV isolates 15 (6,332 nt) and J3666 (6,326 nt) . In this region, the nt identity against murine strains was 96.6-96.7%. Interestingly, HMPV was more closely related to strain Bari/100-12 (56.3% nt identity) than were HRSV and BRSV (both displaying 54% nt identity). However, when the aa sequence was analysed, the genetic relatedness to HRSV/BRSV (49.1-49.9% aa identity) was higher than that with HPMV (48.6% aa identity).",

A 10-year survey in French laboratory rodents showed that 13.9% and 15.9% of the tested rat and mouse colonies, respectively, had antibodies against MPV [36] . Serosurveys conducted in wild rodents in UK gave inconsistent results, with antibodies being detected in certain species of wild voles and mice [37] and in wild grey squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis) [38] , but not in wild house mice (Mus musculus) [39] . In Italy there are no recent data about the MPV circulation in laboratory or wild rodents. However, if the mouse virus circulates in the field, there are several chances for its species jump to the canine host. In this scenario, kenneled dogs should be highly exposed to the cross-species transmission, considering that shelters usually attract large populations of rodents and pest control measures are not carried out on a regular basis. Apart from kenneled dogs, hunting dogs could be also exposed to MPV infection through occasional contacts with wild rodents during hunting activities. Introduction of MPV-like viruses in Italy may have occurred through migration of infected wild rodents or importation of infected dogs from other countries.",

A map of the viral genome is shown (not to scale), drawn 39 to 59 as negative-sense RNA such that the direction of transcription is from left to right. Genes are shown as rectangle, with the shaded bars at each end representing the gene-start (lighter shading) and gene-end (darker shading) transcription signals. The horizontal line represents the extargenic regions, specifically the 39-leader (Le), 59-trailer (Tr) and intergenic regions. Nucleotide (nt) length for extragenic sequences are indicated above the map; below the gene map are the gen coordinates, the nt lengths of the mRNAs and the amino acid (aa) lengths of the predicted proteins. P and M2 genes are predicted to encode each for two different proteins. B, C. CnPnV/Bari/100-12 leader (B) and trailer (C) regions aligned with the analogous sequences of other pneumoviruses. All sequences are shown in the negative genome sense from 39 to 59. The conserved 14 nt stretch at the 39 end of the leader region is boxed. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0085220.g001",
