            "text": "Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV) is a highly neurovirulent coronavirus that invades the central nervous system (CNS) in piglets. Although important progress has been made toward understanding the biology of PHEV, many aspects of its life cycle remain obscure. Here we dissected the molecular mechanism underlying cellular entry and intracellular trafficking of PHEV in mouse neuroblastoma (Neuro-2a) cells. We first performed a thin-section transmission electron microscopy (TEM) assay to characterize the kinetics of PHEV, and we found that viral entry and transfer occur via membranous coating-mediated endo-and exocytosis. To verify the roles of distinct endocytic pathways, systematic approaches were used, including pharmacological inhibition, RNA interference, confocal microscopy analysis, use of fluorescently labeled virus particles, and overexpression of a dominant negative (DN) mutant. Quantification of infected cells showed that PHEV enters cells by clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) and that low pH, dynamin, cholesterol, and Eps15 are indispensably involved in this process. Intriguingly, PHEV invasion leads to rapid actin rearrangement, suggesting that the intactness and dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton are positively correlated with viral endocytosis. We next investigated the trafficking of internalized PHEV and found that Rab5-and Rab7-dependent pathways are required for the initiation of a productive infection. Furthermore, a GTPase activation assay suggested that endogenous Rab5 is activated by PHEV and is crucial for viral progression. Our findings demonstrate that PHEV hijacks the CME and endosomal system of the host to enter and traffic within neural cells, providing new insights into PHEV pathogenesis and guidance for antiviral drug design. IMPORTANCE Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV), a nonsegmented, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA coronavirus, invades the central nervous system (CNS) and causes neurological dysfunction. Neural cells are its targets for viral progression. However, the detailed mechanism underlying PHEV entry and trafficking remains unknown. PHEV is the etiological agent of porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis, which is an acute and highly contagious disease that causes numerous deaths in suckling piglets and enormous economic losses in China. Understanding the viral entry pathway will not only advance our knowledge of PHEV infection and pathogenesis but also open new approaches to the development of novel therapeutic strategies. Therefore, we employed systematic approaches to dissect the internalization and intracellular trafficking mechanism of PHEV in Neuro-2a cells. This is the first report to describe the process of PHEV entry into He W. 2017.

PHEV was initially isolated from encephalomyelitic suckling piglet brains in 1962, and since then, several outbreaks of PHEV infection have been reported (1) (2) (3) (4) . Affected piglets exhibit vomiting and wasting disease (VWD) and/or encephalomyelitis, and the overall mortality rates for affected piglets under 3 weeks of age range from 30% to 100%. PHEV propagates via neural circuits to the central nervous system (CNS) and targets nerve cells as a site of replication, resulting in severe nerve damage (5, 6) . Although major progress has been made in the past decades toward understanding the viral characteristics, many pathological aspects of this virus have yet to be characterized.",

            "text": "Coronaviruses (CoVs) are health threats to a wide variety of mammalian and avian species. The coronavirus spike (S) glycoprotein contains two distinctive domains, both of which can function as receptor-binding domains (RBDs) and recognize protein or sugar receptors (7) . Therefore, the S protein is a major determinant of viral host range and is involved in viral binding and fusion, a set of processes that result in coronavirus entry (8) . As for the coronaviral RBD located on the PHEV S protein, it was found to interact with the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) and to participate in viral infection, suggesting that PHEV entry occurs via a receptor recognition pattern (9) . Subsequent electron microscopic analysis demonstrated that membranous coatingmediated endo-and exocytosis can be employed by PHEV for its transsynaptic transfer (10) . The evidence regarding the mechanism of PHEV entry has been very limited until now, and a detailed and comprehensive study of the endocytic mechanism involved in PHEV uptake was urgently needed. Viral entry is the initial step toward a successful infection. Enveloped viruses achieve internalization via two primary pathways: some viruses appear to fuse directly with the plasma membrane, whereas others take advantage of the endocytic mechanism of the host (11) . Most animal viruses gain access to target cells by hijacking host endocytic pathways, such as clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME), macropinocytosis, caveola/raftmediated endocytosis, clathrin-and caveolin/raft-independent endocytosis, and variations of these themes that are not yet well characterized (12, 13) . CME, the most evolutionarily conserved endocytic pathway, is characterized by the uptake of cargo, such as the transferrin-iron complex, toxins, and viruses, by invaginations or clathrincoated vesicles (CCVs) (14) . It is the primary route for internalization of many viruses, including African swine fever virus (ASFV), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), and rabies virus (RABV) (15) (16) (17) (18) . During this process, low pH plays an essential role, and the dynamics of the endosomal system are tightly regulated by the small Ras related in brain (Rab) GTPases (19, 20) . Another well-characterized pathway is caveola/raftdependent endocytosis, where caveolae are defined as specialized lipid raft domains composed of caveolin and high levels of cholesterol (21) . The pathway requires unique structural and signaling machinery and is involved in internalization of some envelope viruses, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), and infectious spleen and kidney necrosis virus (ISKNV), among others (22) (23) (24) . In addition, research in recent decades has found that some viruses can induce macropinocytosis as a direct endocytic route for productive entry and infection (25) (26) (27) (28) .",

Thus, a combination of pharmacological and molecular techniques was carried out to allow the visualization, tracking, and localization of PHEV. The results indicate that CME is part of the PHEV infection process in host cells and that dynamin-2, Eps15, membrane cholesterol, low pH, and a dynamic actin cytoskeleton are specifically required. Additionally, activation of Rab5 significantly affected the early stages of PHEV infection and disturbed virus transportation in endocytosed vesicles at the postentry stages. Together, our data not only contribute greatly to the pathological characterization of the PHEV entry and intracellular trafficking route but also provide new insights into antiviral drug design.",

We observed the attachment of virus particles along the cell surface before the cells were shifted to 37\u00b0C to allow entry; subsequently, PHEVs were engulfed by coated pits, which may represent primary endocytic vesicles (Fig. 1B, panel a) . Endocytosed virions were mainly trapped within large vesicles in the cytoplasm, either individually or in groups (Fig. 1B, panel b) , and the virus-containing coated vesicles were transported intracellularly, during which the virus fused with the endosome membrane and the nucleocapsid was released (Fig. 1B,  panel c) . Subsequently, viral replication and protein structure synthesis were widely observed at 90 min postinfection (Fig. 1B, panel d) . The earlier sign of viral assembly observed inside the cytoplasm was that large numbers of virions with undecorated membranes were present in the dilated cisternae of the Golgi network (Fig. 1B , panel e). As the infection progressed, small coated vesicles, each tightly enclosing a single enveloped virion, were apparently fused with the plasma membrane. Progeny virions seemed to be released from the cell through an opening at the fusion site, but the membranous coating remained at the release sites (Fig. 1B, panel f) .

            "text": "PHEV enters endosomal structures and requires a low pH. As previously reported, NCAM is a potential cellular receptor that interacts with the PHEV S protein, and this association is critical to PHEV infection (29) . Neuro-2a cells were incubated with PHEV and fixed at the indicated time for an IFA using anti-NCAM and anti-PHEV-S antibodies. A dual staining assay for NCAM and PHEV showed that NCAM was localized primarily at the cell surface under normal conditions, but its expression was induced and the protein was transported from the plasma membrane to intracellular compartments after incubation with PHEV at 37\u00b0C for 4 h, whereas colocalization of these two proteins in the vesicles was observed in the perinuclear area ( Fig. 2A) . After an additional 8 h of incubation, NCAM-containing vesicles were less visible within the cytoplasm and instead were seen clustered near the cell surface, suggesting that the receptors were recycled, most likely by endocytosis ( Fig. 2A) . Early endosomal autoantigen 1 (EEA1) is a membrane tethering factor required for the fusion and maturation of EEs in endocytosis. To further confirm that PHEV enters Neuro-2a cells via endocytic pathways, dual immunostaining for PHEV and the early endosome (EE) marker protein EEA1 was performed. We observed a punctate pattern characterized by the indicated colocalization, suggesting that PHEV was internalized to EEs (Fig. 2B) . As a positive control, we monitored trafficking of Alexa-labeled transferrin (Tf), which binds to its receptor and is internalized in coated vesicles, followed by fusion with endosomes (30) . Once internalized within the primary endocytic vesicles, many viruses require acidic pH in the endosome to undergo uncoating and/or escape from the endosome, and the local pH drops following internalization into endolysosomes. To test whether PHEV entry is pH dependent, Neuro-2a cells were pretreated with the weakly basic amines NH 4 Cl and chloroquine (CQ), which selectively raise the luminal pH of the endosome and lysosome, and the cells were then infected with PHEV. In the presence of either 50 mM NH 4 Cl or 60 M CQ, PHEV internalization decreased to less than 40% of the level found in untreated cells, while both reagents inhibited viral protein synthesis even at low concentrations (Fig. 2C) . Moreover, the relative infection rates of PHEV as monitored by IFA were inhibited in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2D) . These results reflect the normal traffic of membrane flow, indicating that internalized PHEV endocytic vesicles fuse with EEs and that the process occurs in a low-pH-dependent manner.",

Dynamin-2 (DNM-2), a 100-kDa GTPase that is responsible for endocytosis, plays an essential role in cellular membrane fission during vesicle formation and therefore is required for clathrin-and caveola-mediated endocytosis. Here we used dynasore, a cell-permeating noncompetitive inhibitor of dynamin, to ascertain whether PHEV infection is dynamin dependent. Neuro-2a cells were pretreated with 0, 10, or 20 M dynasore for 1 h at 37\u00b0C before PHEV infection, and then the lysates were harvested for quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) assay. As a control, we monitored the impact of the inhibitor on infection with VSV, whose internalization was previously proved to occur in a clathrin-and dynamin-dependent manner. Treatment of Neuro-2a cells with 20 M dynasore resulted in a decrease of over 80% in PHEV internalization (Fig. 3A) , and the suppression lasted for over 24 h postinfection (Fig. 3B) , implying that dynamin-2 might play a crucial role in multiple stages of the viral life cycle. When we further tested specialized functions with dynasore, treatment of cells with the chemical inhibitor blocked the uptake of fluorescently labeled transferrin, a cargo that is internalized via the dynamin-and clathrin-dependent endocytic mechanism (Fig. 3C) . In this situation, we also observed a significant inhibition of the viral load in the cytoplasm of dynasoretreated cells relative to that for the control cells (Fig. 3C ). We next explored the effect of the dominant negative (DN) K44A mutant of dynamin-2 (Dyn2K44A), which was previously described to have decreased GTPase activity resulting in reduced endocytosis (31) . When Neuro-2a cells overexpressing EGFP-Dyn2K44A were infected 24 h later with PHEV, they showed a decrease of nearly 85% in PHEV infection (Fig. 3D ). However, in control cells expressing either enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) or wildtype dynamin-2 (Dyn2wt), normal infection was observed, as indicated by punctate staining in the cytoplasmic region. These findings indicate that PHEV endocytosis is dependent on dynamin-2 functionality.",

            "text": "Clathrin-mediated endocytosis is involved in PHEV entry. To better understand the pathway used by PHEV to enter Neuro-2a cells, we compared its sensitivities to inhibitors of different endocytic mechanisms. Chlorpromazine (CPZ) is a specific inhibitor commonly used to block the CME pathway by preventing the assembly of clathrincoated pits (CCPs) at the plasma membrane and causing clathrin lattices to assemble on endosomal membranes (32) . Cells treated with CPZ were incubated with PHEV plus 50 g/ml Tf-AF594 on ice for 30 min, after which they were shifted to 37\u00b0C for 60 min and then fixed for uptake assay. Neuro-2a cells pretreated with 50 M CPZ exhibited a significant decrease in Tf uptake, which occurs by CME suppression, and exhibited a 76% reduction in PHEV infection (Fig. 4A) . During this period, we observed that PHEVs mostly appeared to be colocalized and transported together with Tf in the large endosomal structures. Through an internalization assay, we found that the entry efficiency of PHEV was significantly decreased, to 10.6%, at 50 M, the highest working concentration of CPZ (Fig. 4B) . Furthermore, the drug stimulation significantly suppressed viral genome replication and protein translation levels as determined by qRT-PCR and immunoblotting ( Fig. 4C and D). The role of CME was further tested by the expression of GFP-tagged dominant negative Eps15 mutants (Eps15E\u039495/295). Eps15 is a crucial component of CCPs, in which it interacts with adaptor protein 2 (AP-2), a major clathrin adaptor complex (33) . When Neuro-2a cells overexpressing Eps15E\u039495/295 were infected with PHEV, there was a significant blockage of infection compared to that with cells expressing wild-type Eps15 (Eps15wt) or EGFP only as controls (Fig. 3D ).",

It forms a triskelion shape composed of clathrin heavy chain (CHC) and light chain (CLC), and the former is known as a key component for regulating the formation and disassembly of the clathrin lattice. Here we observed that PHEVs were mostly coexpressed with clathrin at 1 h postinfection (hpi), which could indicate the presence of CCPs during CME (Fig. 4E ). Since our preliminary results showed that CME is involved in PHEV entry, cell perturbation assays using small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of CHC (siCHC) were carried out to evaluate the necessity of clathrin for viral infection. Twenty-four hours after transfection, PHEV entry assays were performed on transfected Neuro-2a cells, and we found that siCHC specifically decreased the expression of CHC, whereas viral internalization and proliferation were reduced in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4F ). Meanwhile, the staining assay showed that the fluorescence signals of CHC and PHEV in 50 nM siCHC-transfected cells were reduced by approximately 84.6% and 74.5%, respectively, compared to those for the control siRNA (siCtrl)-transfected group (Fig. 4G ). Taken together, these coincident results strongly suggest that PHEV entry into Neuro-2a cells can occur efficiently via CME.",

Most endocytic processes are sensitive to cholesterol perturbation, with both CME and caveola/lipid raft endocytosis being inhibited by removal of cholesterol (34, 35) . Cholera toxin subunit B (CTB) binds to the GM1 ganglioside in lipid rafts and travels via the caveosome for delivery to the Golgi apparatus; consequently, GM1 is used as a tracer marker for caveola/lipid raft endocytosis (36) . Cells were treated with a dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) control, methyl-\u2424-cyclodextrin (M\u2424CD), nystatin-progesterone (Nys/Prog), or genistein for 60 min before PHEV plus CTB incubation on ice; PHEV was allowed to internalize at 37\u00b0C for 60 min and then subjected to microscope assay. Distinct endocytic compartment structures were labeled for PHEV (green) and CTB (red) in our study, showing the sorting of these two ligands for delivery to distinct endosomal populations, which suggests that PHEV and CTB take different intracellular targeting routes to the Golgi apparatus or the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in the perinuclear region (Fig. 5A , upper panels). Caveola/lipid raft endocytosis is known to be sensitive to nonacute cholesterol depletion induced by pharmacological agents, such as M\u2424CD or Nys/Prog. Thus, we selectively extracted membrane cholesterol from the plasma membrane by treating Neuro-2a cells with M\u2424CD before PHEV was added. We found that 5 mM M\u2424CD treatment resulted in a noticeable shift of CTB from a punctate cytoplasmic distribution to being located predominantly in the plasma membrane, and quantitative analyses revealed a significant reduction (53%) in the amount of internalized CTB, indicating that the cholesterol-dependent pathway was effectively blocked ( Fig. 5A and B). In this depletion assay, as observed by both internalization (Fig. 5C ) and immunofluorescence ( Fig. 5A and B) assays, PHEV entry was suppressed by approximately 48%, though not abolished, and the majority of both PHEV and CTB was settled on the outside surface of the plasma membrane. When cholesterol-depleted Neuro-2a cells were infected with PHEV, we found that the perturbation of cholesterol fluidity not only inhibited viral genome replication but also affected viral protein synthesis (Fig. 5D) . Similar to what was observed in the M\u2424CD assay, the uptake of CTB was blocked by pretreatment with Nys/Prog, and some of it stayed outside the plasma membrane without being inter- nalized, while PHEV entry, replication, and proliferation were notably inhibited ( Fig. 5A to D). These data confirm that PHEV enters via a cholesterol-sensitive endocytic route.",

Thus, we used a well-known tyrosine kinase inhibitor, genistein, to disrupt the complex pathway and checked for the uptake of PHEV and CTB. We observed that cells pretreated with 100 M genistein showed a significant reduction (73.6%) in CTB internalization but a slight facilitation of PHEV infection (Fig. 5A to D) . This observation implies that the signaling cascade in the caveola/lipid raft-dependent pathway is a negative regulator of PHEV aggregation and that PHEV entry probably occurs via a caveola/lipid raft-independent route. To further verify this speculation, we examined the role of caveolae during viral infection. Given that caveolin-1 (Cav1) is essential for the formation and stability of caveolae and represents a scaffolding molecule for several signaling molecules, a small interfering RNA targeting caveolin-1 (siCav1) was used in this study to characterize caveolar invaginations. The efficiency of the knockdown was first validated by Western blotting (Fig. 5E ), followed by a PHEV entry assay. As expected, reduction of Cav1 expression by RNA interference (RNAi) did not significantly affect viral internalization and infection in the transfected cells, suggesting that PHEV did not hijack the caveola/lipid raftmediated route to gain entry into Neuro-2a cells (Fig. 5E and F). Taken together, these results revealed that PHEV entry is dependent on the fluidity of cholesterol but does not involve caveola/lipid raft-dependent endocytosis.",

Apart from the clathrin-and caveola/raft-dependent endocytic processes, macropinocytosis is a unique mode of endocytosis that has received increasing attention because of its roles in immune defense and virus entry. Recent studies indicated that the actin cytoskeleton is involved in the regulation of multiple endocytic pathways; in particular, F-actin polymerization is critical for the formation of outward protrusions of the plasma membrane during macropinocytosis (38) . To test whether PHEV interacts with protrusions and undergoes rapid actin-driven transport to entry sites in the cell body, Neuro-2a cells were incubated with PHEV labeled with the lipophilic fluorescent dye DiD (DiD-PHEV) and fixed at various time points, and then actin was examined using phalloidin staining. Representative micrographs are shown in Fig. 6A . Without PHEV infection (0 min), the Neuro-2a cells produced random filopodial protrusions and showed a smooth margin at cell surfaces with peripheral actin staining. During the first 10 min postinfection, we found that DiD-PHEV was associated with the protrusions and the bases of the filopodia at the cell surface but that its density decreased at later time points. At approximately 30 min postinfection, the membrane-annulus phase began, and the bound viruses \"surfed\" toward the foot of the filopodia, located on the cell body, through actin retrograde flow. At this time, actin cytoskeleton depolymerization occurred, with the number of actin stress fibers decreasing, the cells becoming more rounded, and transient blebs filled with actin forming at the cell surface. Within 60 to 90 min, the annulus disappeared and actin accumulated in blebs and flaky pseudopods, while most of the DiD-PHEV was transported to the perinuclear cisternae. These data showed an increased distribution of actin cytoskeleton flow in cells after PHEV uptake, implying that viral entry is likely to be an actin-and molecular motor-driven process.",

Neuro-2a cells were pretreated with CytoD or 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl) amiloride (EIPA) at the indicated concentrations for 1 h, and then PHEV internalization was examined by qRT-PCR. We observed that PHEV internalization was blocked when actin polymerization was inhibited in Neuro-2a cells (Fig. 6B) . A confocal microscopy assay highlighted that pretreatment with CytoD strongly disrupted actin polymers, inhibited PHEV infection in Neuro-2a cells, and blocked the uptake of Dx-AF488, a soluble fluorescent tracer of In the uptake assays, Dx-AF488 was added for 30 min on ice, after which the cells were fixed and processed for antibody staining. Representative micrographs and quantitative analyses of average fluorescence intensity showed that PHEV infection and Dx-AF488 uptake were inhibited by CytoD and that the cells took on a more rounded shape with a (Continued on next page) actin-dependent pathways (Fig. 6C) . As a control group, Neuro-2a cells were pretreated with DMSO and processed for later study. Meanwhile, PHEV RNA replication and protein synthesis were also reduced by the drug at the early stage, i.e., before 12 hpi (Fig. 6D and E), suggesting that functional actin cytoskeleton reorganization is required for this process. We therefore examined which stage of internalization was being affected by actin depolymerization. As shown in the schematic in Fig. 6F , CytoD was added either 60 min prior to a 1-h inoculation with virus or at 1 hpi and maintained until analysis. PHEV internalization was assayed by qRT-PCR at 2 hpi. Inhibition of actin polymerization prior to the addition of virus resulted in a 67% reduction in PHEV infection. Treatment of cells with CytoD at 1 h postinoculation had a negligible effect on PHEV accumulation as detected, confirming that the requirement for actin is specific to the very early stage of virus internalization, that is, before 1 h postinoculation (Fig. 6F) .",

The Rab family of small GTPases is known to play crucial roles in orchestrating membrane traffic and localizing cargos to specific subcellular compartments (19) . Generally, after detaching from the plasma membrane, most enveloped RNA virus particles trafficked into EEs, marked by Rab5 and EEA1, and were then either sorted into recycling endosomes (REs), marked by Rab11, or directed to late endosomes (LEs) and endolysosomes (Lys), which are Rab7 and Rab9 positive, respectively. Therefore, we first analyzed the expression of these corresponding marker molecules by Western blotting using specific antibodies, and we found that the expression of Rab5, EEA1, Rab7, and Rab9 was significantly enhanced in the presence of PHEV, while Rab11 expression was not significantly affected (Fig. 7A) . To determine whether PHEV particles were tightly associated with endosomal trafficking, we labeled EEs and LEs by transfection with EGFP-Rab5wt and EGFP-Rab7wt constructs, and their functionality was confirmed in Neuro-2a cells, with labeled transferrin (Tf-AF488) serving as a control (Fig. 7B ). Next, we employed transfected cells to study PHEV entry, and we found that virus particles were colocalized with Rab5 and Rab7 during infection, indicating that Rab5 and Rab7 are involved in PHEV infection (Fig. 7C) .",

Transfection with EGFP-Rab5S34N obviously blocked the trafficking of PHEV cargos into the cytoplasm, leaving them just beneath the cytoplasmic membranes of the infected cells, while only a moderate decrease was observed in EGFP- Rab7T22N-overexpressing cells, indicating that Rab5 and Rab7 were required (Fig. 7C ). In the above-mentioned overexpression studies, the average fluorescence signals of PHEV and Tf-AF488 were quantified, and the resulting values are summarized in a histogram (Fig. 7D) . We then identified the endosomal compartments traversed by endocytosed PHEV when Rab5 and Rab7 were knocked down by RNAi as a means to investigate the necessity of EEs and LEs for viral entry. Neuro-2a cells were pretransfected with 50 nM siCtrl, 25 nM siRab5, or 50 nM siRab7 for 48 h, followed by PHEV infection, and cell lysates were harvested at 24 hpi. Western blotting confirmed that Rab5 and Rab7 levels in Neuro-2a cells were efficiently knocked down by the siRNAs, and the synthesis of PHEV proteins was inhibited compared to that in siCtrl-transfected cells (Fig. 8A) . These results were confirmed by qRT-PCR and IFA. We observed a significant reduction in viral entry and infectivity in siRab-transfected cells (Fig. 8A and  B) , which suggests the involvement of Rab5-and Rab7-mediated transport in PHEV internalization and productive infection. To investigate the endocytic trail followed by PHEV, we allowed fluorescently labeled DiD-PHEV particles to bind to Neuro-2a cells pretransfected with the Rab constructs. As shown in Fig. 8C and D, the viral signal was captured in the cytoplasm, and DiD-PHEV-containing organelles had acquired or fused with Rab5-positive EEs at approximately 30 min postinternalization. Seventy-five minutes later, the cotransport of Rab5 and PHEV gradually disappeared, while a few DiD-PHEV particles were detected in Rab7-positive LEs. By 90 min postinternalization, this colocalization of Rab7 and PHEV was widely apparent. Given this cotransport of DiD-PHEV particles with Rab5 and Rab7 in the cytoplasm, we concluded that Rab5-positive EEs and Rab7-positive LEs were required for viral transport, undergoing endosomal maturation to initiate an infectious cycle.",

At 12 hpi, the cells were lysed and harvested for immunoblot analysis with the indicated antibodies. As expected, overexpression of the high-GTPase-activity isoform Rab5Q79L facilitated PHEV RNA replication and proliferation, while overexpression of the DN isoform Rab5S34N significantly inhibited productive infection (Fig. 9D) . In the Rab5wt-transfected group, cells showed an increased pulldown signal, but to a much lesser extent than that with Rab5Q79L (Fig. 9C) , whereas PHEV infection was 7-fold higher than that in the EGFP-transfected group (Fig. 9D) . Profiles similar to the above findings were observed by IFA: Rab5Q79L overexpression not only increased PHEV infection but also formed some sorting-defective and enlarged Rab5-positive vesicles that allowed us to more easily detect virion particles, reinforcing the notion that the virus traffics through Rab5-positive EEs (Fig. 7C) . These results were further evidenced by increased endocytosis of Tf-AF488: overexpression of Rab5Q79L induced the formation of enlarged vesicles that recruited excessive accumulation of Tf-AF488 compared to that in cells expressing Rab5wt (Fig. 9E) . In contrast, expression of Rab5S34N reduced Tf-AF488 uptake to 66% of control levels (Fig. 9E) . Together, these results suggest that the GTPase Rab5 is critical for PHEV propagation and that endogenous Rab5 function may need to be activated during viral entry and intracellular trafficking.",

Coronavirus entry is largely controlled by the S glycoprotein, since it bears both receptor binding and membrane fusion capabilities. During the initial receptor binding, large conformational changes of the S protein have evolved. Depending on the coronavirus species and strain, the S protein can mediate binding to a proteinaceous receptor or to carbohydrate moieties, and thereby, a multitude of mechanisms and strategies of virus entry have been exploited. For example, MHV strains are capable of entering directly at the cell surface or through the endocytic pathway (46, 47) . While SARS-CoV was initially thought to enter cells through direct fusion with the plasma membrane, more recent evidence suggests that virus entry may also occur through a novel clathrin-and caveola-independent endocytic pathway (48) . Increasing evidence has demonstrated that the choice of coronavirus entry mechanism is very complex. As such, this study on PHEV entry mechanisms is notable and increasingly central for understanding the infection process.",

In our study, RNA interference assays indicated that clathrins are required for the PHEV-induced formation of CCPs at their binding sites. Once assembly is finished, CCPs pinch off from the plasma membrane to form clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs), which involves the dynamic function of dynamin-2 around the neck of the endocytic indentations. As for large GTPases, dynamin-2 is required for various types of endocytosis and intracellular scission events and is indispensable for CME (50) . We found that PHEV endocytosis has a dynamin-2-and low-pH-dependent nature, prompting us to hypothesize that PHEV entry is a quick process, in accordance with the characteristics of CME. As expected, disrupting the assembly of clathrin lattices and blocking AP-2 recruitment to CCPs decreased PHEV entry, showing that it occurs via CME.",

In the present study, we monitored the intracellular trafficking following endocytosis and showed that PHEV infection is regulated by EEs, LEs, and endolysosomes, while the involvement of recycling endosomes in this process is uncertain (Fig. 10) .

In general, Rab cycles between GTP-bound and GDP-bound states, and the conversion between these two states is regulated by GTPase-activating protein, GDP exchange factor, GDP dissociation inhibitor (GDI), Rab escort protein (REP-1), and some effector molecules.

A better understanding of the molecular pathogenesis involved in porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis is likely to open new approaches for the development of novel therapeutic strategies. However, for many aspects of PHEV infection, the underlying physiological processes remain to be characterized. To move forward, it is important to take advantage of powerful novel technologies, combined with improved assays for following a virus step by step through its replication cycle, to achieve unprecedented access to the underlying network of cellular factors involved. qRT-PCR and Western blotting. Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and reverse transcription was performed using PrimeScript reverse transcriptase (TaKaRa, Japan). qRT-PCR was conducted with FS Universal SYBR green master mix (Roche) on a CFX96 Touch real-time PCR PHEV particles may be transported along actin-rich protrusions to reach the cell surface, and internalization from the plasma membrane may be induced by the classical mechanism of CME. The individual particles are rapidly taken up, internalized into CCVs, and then transported to Rab5-, EEA1-, and NCAM-positive EEs in a clathrin-, dynamin-2-, Eps15-, and Rab5-dependent manner. Through endosome maturation, these viruscontaining endosomes acquire Rab7 and become luminal components of Rab7-and Rab9-positive LEs. Further transport to the Golgi apparatus occurs from the late compartments of the endocytic pathway, by an unknown mechanism, and the recycling endosomes are not essential in this process. The vacuolar ATPase (v-ATPase) is responsible for the acidification of the endosomal system, a process that is required for PHEV internalization and the subsequent transport steps.
