            "text": "While bats are often viewed as carriers of infectious disease agents, little research has been conducted on the effects these potential pathogens may have on the bat populations themselves. The southern bent-winged bat (Miniopterus orianae bassanii) is a critically endangered subspecies endemic to south-eastern Australia. Population numbers of this bat have been declining for the past 50 years, but the reasons for this are unclear. As part of a larger study to determine if disease could be a contributing factor to this decline, 351 southern bent-winged bats from four locations were captured, and oral swabs were collected and tested for the presence of potentially pathogenic viruses. Results were compared with those obtained from 116 eastern bent-winged bats (Miniopterus orianae oceanensis) from three different locations. The eastern bent-winged bat is a related but more common and widespread subspecies whose geographical range overlaps partly with southern bent-winged bats. Herpesviruses were detected in bent-winged bats from all seven locations. At least six novel herpesviruses (five betaherpesviruses and one gammaherpesvirus) were identified. The prevalence of herpesvirus infection was higher in eastern bent-winged bats (44%, 51/ 116), compared to southern bent-winged bats (27%, 95/351), although this varied across the locations and sampling periods. Adenoviruses and a range of different RNA viruses (lyssaviruses, filoviruses, coronaviruses and henipaviruses) were also tested for but not detected. The detected herpesviruses did not appear to be associated with obvious ill health, and may thus not be playing a role in the population decline of the southern bentwinged bat. The detection of multiple novel herpesviruses at a high prevalence of infection is consistent with our understanding of bats as hosts to a rich diversity of viruses.",

An International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) report listed 833 species extinctions over the past 500 years and attributed only 3.7% of these to infectious disease [1] . This low percentage of extinctions caused by infectious disease may be partly due to the past use of less sophisticated diagnostic techniques to detect infectious agents, as it is now becoming apparent that the effects of urbanization, human population growth, altered land use, deforestation, reduced biodiversity and global trade are leading to an increase in infectious disease incidence and impact [2] . These same factors are also increasing the frequency of disease transmission between humans, domestic animals and wildlife [2, 3] resulting in a dramatic rise in both emerging infectious diseases and zoonoses [4] .",

Other infectious agents have also impacted bat populations. Of particular note is an event involving the mass mortality of thousands of bent-winged bats (Miniopterus schreibersii) in France, Spain and Portugal in 2002 [7] . This was thought to have been caused by infection with a novel filovirus, termed Lloviu virus [8] , which was only found in dead bats. A betaherpesvirus was also found in the same affected bats. Its significance in the mortality event was unclear, however herpesviruses have been found asymptomatically in a number of different bat species, in addition to bent-winged bats [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] .",

In the last 50 years the size of the Naracoorte population of southern bent-winged bats has declined from an estimated 200,000 in the 1950s to 20,000 in 2009 [17] . The Warrnambool population declined from 15,000 to 10,000 over the same time period [17] . The subspecies was listed as critically endangered under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act in 2007. The eastern bent-winged bat (M. orianae oceanensis) is more common and widespread, being distributed along the east coast of Australia [15] .

Australian bat lyssavirus (ABLV), causes a fatal disease in bats and humans. It is carried by all four species of Australian flying foxes (Pteropus spp.), as well as the yellow-bellied sheath-tailed bat (Saccolaimus flaviventris) [19] . While previous surveys of bentwinged bats in Australia failed to find any serologically positive animals [19, 20] a serosurvey of common bent-winged bats (M. schreibersii) in the Philippines found that 36% were positive for neutralizing antibodies against ABLV [21] . Bat-associated adenovirus infections have been mostly asymptomatic [22] [23] [24] [25] . The virus was found in the gut of three common pipistrelles (Pipistrellus pipistrellus) in Germany with gastrointestinal disease but causation was not established [24] .",

Individual sequences were assigned to groups of identical, or near identical (like) sequences. Near identical sequences were examined for stop codons and multiple peaks. They contained a maximum of four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the approximately 200 bp of the sequenced product (2%). Consensus sequences were generated from groups of like sequences and then compared to published protein sequences in the GenBank database [43] with the highest percentage identity using the BLAST-X algorithm [44] . The resulting predicted amino acid pairwise identities were recorded. A portion of the predicted amino acid sequences of the DNA polymerase region from the detected herpesviruses were aligned with representative members from the three Herpesviridae subfamilies from a range of host species using MAFFT v7.308 [45] , in conjunction with the BLOSUM62 scoring matrix [46] . The sequences selected for inclusion in this alignment included sequences with a high level of identity to the viruses sequenced in this study, other viruses detected in different bat species, and additional viruses that were selected to ensure that the different Herpesviridae subfamilies were represented in the analysis. A phylogenetic tree was generated from the 45 amino acid long alignment using MrBayes v3.2.6 [47] with four heated chains, a chain length of 1,000,000, sampling every 10,000 iterations, and a burn in of 10%. Amino acid sequence is most commonly used when comparing between herpesvirus sub-families as it is typically more informative than relying on overly-divergent nucleotide sequences, which will affect the quality of the alignment and therefore the quality of the tree [48] . Model selection was undertaken using ModelGenerator v0.85 [49] , and the Le and Gascuel model [50] , with gamma-distributed rate variation across sites and a proportion of invariable sites (LG+I+G), was selected based on the Akaike Information Criterion [51] .

Due to the small size of bent-winged bats it was not possible to collect sufficient blood to screen for exposure to viruses using the serological tools that were available to us. The small amount of blood that was collected in this study (a maximum of 90 \u03bcL per bat) was prioritised for haematological and biochemical testing (as a component of a related study) rather than for virological screening. The use of oral swab samples combined with molecular methods to screen for shedding of viruses has been successfully used in bats for European bat lyssavirus, a virus closely related to ABLV, detecting virus in 15 of 71 samples [53] and consistent with lyssaviruses being shed in the saliva of infected Table 3 ",

Two herpesviruses (CH6-like and E22-like) were detected only in eastern bent-winged bats, whilst another herpesvirus (N7050-like) was detected only in southern bent-winged bats, raising the possibility that these viruses are specific for each of the sub-species of bent-winged bats, although this requires further investigation with larger numbers of animals and samples collected over different times of the year. Three herpesviruses were detected across both bat subspecies, including D15-like herpesvirus, which was found at all seven locations. Herpesviruses have a low rate of nucleotide substitution and have co-evolved with their hosts over many millions of years [56] , thus, even in the presence of relatively limited movement of bats between the locations included in the present study, it is expected that the same or similar viruses would occur due to some herpesviruses being present before sub-speciation of the bats, or before bat populations became relatively isolated from each other.",

As temperatures within the caves occupied by the bats are below 25\u02daC year round [61] and bats go into torpor over winter, lowering their body temperatures to within a few degrees of ambient [62] , this would create unfavourable conditions for virus growth and replication. As the bats' body temperatures and activity levels reach a maximum during the summer months, conditions at this time of year would be more conducive to viral replication and transmission.",

Pairwise alignments of amino acids were generated with MAFFT using the BLOSUM62 matrix. More similar sequences are in green. Less similar sequences are in red. (XLSX) S1 Fig. Phylogenetic tree demonstrating the relationship between six bent-winged bat herpesviruses detected in southern and eastern bent-winged bats from south-eastern Australia using PCR, and a selection of viruses from the Alpha-(red), Beta-(blue) and Gammaherpesvirinae (purple) subfamilies. The tree was generated from 136 nucleotide sequences aligned with MAFFT [45] and substitution model selection (using AIC) undertaken with ModelGenerator [49] . The tree was built using MrBayes [47] with four heated chains and a burn in of 10%, subsampled every 10,000 and using the general time reversible model with gamma-distributed rate variation across sites and a proportion of invariable sites (GTR+I+G) [71] . GenBank accession numbers are located to the right of each virus. (TIF)",
