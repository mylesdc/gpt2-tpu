We used two VV strains; neurotropic virulent WR strain and the less virulent Wyeth strain. Although BALB/c mice are frequently used for intranasal challenge of vaccinia virus [10, 22] , we used the C57BL6/J strain of mouse in these experiments for two reasons. One is that most knockout mice lacking genes involved in immune responses have been made with C57BL6/J genetic background. The other is that we and one other group have characterized cellular immune responses, especially CD8 + T cell responses, to vaccinia virus in C57BL6/J mice [23, 24] , when this study was planned. Infection of C57BL/6J mouse with a high dose (10 6 p.f.u. (plaque-forming units)) of the WR strain was lethal, whereas a high dose (10 6 p.f.u.) of Wyeth strain and a lower dose (10 4 p.f.u.) of WR strain were not lethal. The WR strain replicated and produced higher titers of virus in the lung and the brain compared to the Wyeth strain. There was, however, no difference between the virus titers in brains of mice infected with the high or low dose of WR strain. Lethal infection with WR strain resulted in fewer lymphocytes and an altered phenotype of T cells in the lung compared to non-lethal infection and uninfected controls, and induced severe thymus atrophy with a marked reduction of CD4 and CD8 double positive (DP) T cells.",

The degree of the decrease of CD4 + CD8 + DP cells in the non-lethal infection was not as dramatic as in the lethal infection. Infection with the Wyeth strain did not change the size of the thymus (Fig. 7A ) or the number of thymocytes by 5 days post-infection (Fig. 7B ). The number of thymocytes started to decline after that (Fig.  7B ), but the proportion of CD4 + CD8 + DP cells stayed unchanged (Fig. 7D) .",

Isoflurane is known to inhibit interferon stimulation of NK cells in mice [26, 27] . It was also reported that mean white blood cell counts in circulation decreased in mice after exposure to isoflurane anesthesia [28] . In our experiments uninfected control mice were also anesthetized with isoflurane before inoculation of CV-1 cell lysate.

These data suggest that lethal infection with the WR strain by the respiratory route induces immune suppression, resulting in uncontrolled virus replication in the lung. Innate immune responses are likely to be very important to limit virus replication in the lung in the early phase of the infection (1-3 days postinfection) for subsequent recovery from VV infection. In the absence of effective early immune responses, the mice infected with a high dose of WR do not develop effective adaptive immune responses and the high viral burden suppresses the T cell responses in the lungs and causes severe thymic atrophy.",

This replication pattern is similar to infection with paramyxoviruses such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and pneumonia virus of mice (PVM), in which virus titers in the lung peak We observed that intranasal VV infection induced severe thymus atrophy (Fig. 7) . Severe atrophy of the thymus is seen in several infections [43] including acute viral infections, such as rabies [44, 45] , measles [46, 47] , mouse hepatitis [48] , and Ebola viruses [49] . Although inoculation of ectromelia virus into the food-pad of BALB/c mouse is known to cause the necrosis of thymus as well as other lymphatic tissues [50] , there has been no description of thymus atrophy in mice induced by respiratory infection with VV. It is not known whether RSV, PVM, adenovirus and influenza A virus cause thymus atrophy when immune suppression of T cells is observed in the lung. The atrophy of the thymus was mainly due to a reduction of immature CD4 + CD8 + DP. One major consideration regarding thymus atrophy is a rise of glucocorticoid hormone level in the blood, which is induced due to the stress responses to severe infections [43, 44, 51, 52] . CD4 + CD8 + DP thymocytes are particularly sensitive to glucocorticoids. In addition, some cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, may also contribute to the thymus atrophy in some infections [48, 53] . It also has been suggested that infection of the cells in thymus is involved in reducing the number of thymocytes [43, [46] [47] [48] 54, 55] . In measles and mouse hepatitis virus infections apoptotic depletion of thymocytes is mediated by the infection of thymic epithelial cells [46] [47] [48] . In Trypanosoma cruzi infection parasite-derived factors are involved in apoptosis of thymocytes [43, 54, 55] . VV has been found to synthesize steroid hormones with a 3\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase encoded by gene A44L [56] . We did not perform experiments dissecting the mechanisms of the thymus atrophy induced by intranasal VV infection in the lethal infection. However, virus was recovered from the thymus when the thymocyte number was markedly decreasing at days 3 and 5 post-infection in the lethal infection ( Fig. 7B and 7C) , suggesting that the steroid hormone synthesized by both virus and host may contribute to thymus atrophy as well as the direct effect of virus infection against thymic cells. The VV A44L gene is well conserved among VV strains. In contrast, virus was under the detection limit in the thymi of mice infected with a nonlethal dose of WR when the thymocyte number was at nadir at day 10 post-infection ( Fig. 7B and 7C ). Further investigation is required to uncover the mechanisms of thymus atrophy induced by respiratory infection with VV. At this point it appears that acute thymus atrophy early in infection may be a component of the lethal outcome.",

The size of the virus plaques and the ability to form comets were also different between these two strains (Fig. 4A ). In addition, the Wyeth strain induced syncytium formation in infected cells, but the WR strain did not (Fig. 4B) . Usually cell-cell fusion is not apparent during VV infection in cultured cells, but it appears spontaneously with certain mutants or can be triggered by briefly lowering the pH [57] . These differences suggest different host-virus interactions in infected lung cells, and in the case of WR infection, a high dose of virus resulted in uncontrolled replication of the virus in the lung. It has been reported that the hemagglutin and serine protease inhibitor 3 are fusion inhibitor proteins and mutants containing a dis-ruption of these proteins form syncytia at neutral pH [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] . We did not analyze nucleotide differences between WR and Wyeth strains, since the Wyeth strain is not cloned and is genetically heterogeneous, which recent sequencing data of Dryvax (derived from the same New York City Board of Health strain) confirmed (GenBank accession numbers DQ377945, AY313847, AY313848).",

Murine models of respiratory infection with several viruses have been provided useful information about acute and chronic virus respiratory infection, humoral and cellular immune responses, CD4 and CD8 T cell biology, and innate immune responses. We think that VV respiratory infection of the mouse is a useful model not only to understand the pathogeneses of poxviruses but also other respiratory viruses. FBS.

Cells were confirmed to express the endothelial specific markers, PECAM (CD31), ICAM-2 (CD102) and VE-cadherin (CD144) by flow cytometric analysis. [4] [5] [6] week-old female C57BL/6J mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory. Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and then intranasaly inoculated with various doses (10 3 to 10 6 p.f.u.) of the WR or Wyeth strains, or uninfected CV-1 cell lysate (for control mice) in a total volume of 50 \u03bcl. Mice were observed for disease symptoms and weighed daily. All mice were maintained in the Animal Facility at the University of Massachusetts Medical School, which is regulated by AWA-1995, PHS-1986, MA140-1985 and follows the AAALAC-1965 guidelines.",

In contrast, other respiratory viruses, such as influenza and SARS viruses, rapidly replicate in the lung after intranasal infection and the virus titers reached a peak at 1-2 days post-infection [32-34]. Although RSV has direct cytopathic effects on the respiratory epithelium, host immune responses are more important factors in disease pathogenesis [35]. In lethal intranasal infection with VV, in contrast, there is a marked decrease in lymphocytes in the lung. T cells are key effectors of virus clearance in mice infected with various viruses via respiratory route [36]. Immune suppression of T cells is considered to be an immune evasion strategy, observed in several respiratory virus infections. For example, PVM and RSV suppressed T cell effecter functions in the lung [37,38]. Adenovirus infection induced T cells with decreased proliferative ability in the lung and local immunoincompetence by altering DC-T-cell interaction [39]. Infection with highly virulent influenza A strains down-regulated CD8 + T cell responses [33]. Since VV has many immunomodulatory proteins [40-42], it is not surprising that high levels of WR VV induced immune suppression in the infected lungs.",
