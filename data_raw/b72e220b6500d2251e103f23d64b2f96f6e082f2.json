We create a geometric analysis method (called GenomeLandscaper) to conduct landscape analysis of genomefingerprints maps (GFM), trace large-scale repetitive regions, and assess their impacts on the global architectures of assembled chromosomes. We develop an alignment-free method for phylogenetics analysis. The human Y chromosomes (GRCh.chrY, HuRef.chrY and YH.chrY) are analysed as a proofof-concept study. We construct a galaxy of genome-fingerprints maps (GGFM) for them, and a landscape compatibility among relatives is observed. But a long sharp straight line on the GGFM breaks such a landscape compatibility, distinguishing GRCh38p1.chrY (and throughout GRCh38p7. chrY) from GRCh37p13.chrY, HuRef.chrY and YH.chrY. We delete a 1.30-Mbp target segment to rescue the landscape compatibility, matching the antecedent GRCh37p13.chrY. We re-locate it into the modelled centromeric and pericentromeric region of GRCh38p10.chrY, matching a gap placeholder of GRCh37p13.chrY. We decompose it into sub-constituents (such as BACs, interspersed repeats, and tandem repeats) and trace their homologues by phylogenetics analysis. We elucidate that most examined tandem repeats are of reasonable quality, but the BAC-sized repeats, 173U1020C (176.46 Kbp) and 5U41068C (205.34 Kbp), are likely over-repeated. These results offer unique insights into the centromeric and pericentromeric regions of the human Y chromosomes.",

As such, one can detect misassembling and determine to replace a misassembled artefact or maintain a true intrinsic segment. Our hypotheses are: (1) there should be a landscape compatibility among relatives under comparison, and (2) the more the relatives were compared at a large scale, the easier the misassembled architectures could be detected in a big-picture view, thus overcoming the aforementioned central challenge. Based on our GenomeFingerprinter algorithm 19 , here we establish a method (called GenomeLandscaper) to construct a galaxy of genome-fingerprints maps (GGFM), which comprises a set of genome-fingerprints maps (GFM) that are simultaneously constructed for a set of chromosomes under comparison. Hence we can compare a set of chromosomes in a big-picture view at a large scale. To compare a number of large and divergent genomes, we also develop an alignment-free method for phylogenetics analysis. As a proof-of-concept study, we create a GGFM for the human Y chromosomes (GRCh.chrY 12, 13 , HuRef.chrY [4] [5] [6] and YH.chrY 7 ) and conduct assessments on their global architectures. This study establishes a method to retrospectively assess the correctness of assembled chromosome architectures by means of evaluating the quality of their multiple assemblies, which is crucial to assess, re-construct and use complex genomes.",

We develop an itinerary throughout the next sections: (1) constructing a galaxy of genome-fingerprints maps, (2) detecting discrepancies among multiple assemblies, (3) deleting the misassembled chromosome architecture, (4) re-locating the deleted target segment, (5) tracing BACs of the deleted target segment, (6) tracing interspersed repeats of the deleted target segment, and (7) tracing tandem repeats of the deleted target segment. Notably, instead of intending to conduct the straightforward de novo assembling, our goal is to provide a novel method to retrospectively assess the correctness of assembled chromosome architectures by means of evaluating the quality of their multiple assemblies, so that one can detect misassembling and determine to replace a misassembled segment or maintain a true intrinsic segment.",

The 2D-contour maps indicate that GRCh37p13.chrY is distinct from GRCh38p1.chrY and GRCh38p2.chrY ( Fig. 2d-f ). There is an extra turning-changed long sharp straight line on the GGFM (Fig. 3) , which can distinguish GRCh37p13.chrY from GRCh38p1.chrY (and throughout GRCh38p7.chrY).

To evaluate which one is likely misassembled, we need to understand the mechanism of how the turning-changed long sharp straight line occurs between GRCh37p13.chrY and GRCh38p1.chrY (Fig. 3) . The logic is simple with no biases: if the antecedent GRCh37p13.chrY were (and should have been over time) correct, then the descendent GRCh38p1.chrY with a newly-introduced extra segment should be incorrect; and vice versa. To simplify the logic of validations, here we deliberately hypothesise that the turning-changed long sharp straight line on the GGFM (Fig. 3) is resulted from likely misassembling of GRCh38p1.chrY. To test this, we delete the identified segment corresponding to the long sharp straight line on the GGFM (Fig. 3) . Specifically, we delete a 1.30-Mbp (from 9,999,936 bp to 11,299,986 bp) target segment (Supplementary Dataset 1) from the prior-cleaned GRCh38p1.chrY, as guided by the turning-changed long sharp straight line on the 2D-trajectory map (X-Length) of the GGFM (Fig. 4a ). As expected, the resulting re-assembled form (reass.GRCh38p1.chrY) of GRCh38p1.chrY does roughly match its antecedent GRCh37p13.chrY on the GGFM (Fig. 4) . Hence, we name a proofreading errors-deletion (PRED) for this operation of target deletion guided by the GGFM (Fig. 4a) . Such a PRED-deletion rescues the harmonious state of chromosome architecture among the relatives on the GGFM (Fig. 4) . Accordingly, we name a landscape compatibility for such an observed harmonious state.",

As anticipated, we scan it but find no tandem repeats (TTAGGG)n, regardless of dispersed 116 copies of single TTAGGG element.

We track out that Block I (227.10 Kbp) was documented to be the DYZ3 alpha satellite array in a centromeric database that was created from the HuRef WGS reads library 16 , whereas Block II (100.15 Kbp) and Block III (848.71 Kbp) are unclear (Fig. 5 ) about their assembling processes that caused dramatic changes from GRCh37p13.chrY to GRCh38p1.chrY (and throughout GRCh38p7) (Figs 3 and 4) .

Our method took only 1 minute to calculate genome fingerprints and create a weighted distance matrix, but the MEGA6 package 22 took 48 hours to complete base-to-base alignments and calculate a pair-wise distance matrix (i.e., the MEGA distance matrix). We use the MEGA6 package 22 to construct traditional bootstrap consensus trees, both the ME (minimum-evolution) tree (Fig. 6b ) and the NJ (neighbour-joining) tree (Fig. 6c) have a low confidence at arguable sub-branches (e.g., containing FP565576.7, AC_138511.2, AC_113435.1, AC_137800.3 and AC_136625.2). In contrast, we use our weighted distance matrix to construct an NJ tree (Fig. 6d ) by NEIGHOR. exe (from the Phylip package) 23 and a FastME tree (Fig. 6e ) by FastMe software 21 (an update version of ME). Our trees (Fig. 6 d,e) demonstrate a better resolution at the questionable sub-branches observed on the opposite MEGA trees (Fig. 6b,c) . Further, we construct two phylogenetic networks (Fig. 6f,g) using SplitsTree4 software 24, 25 Scientific REPORts | (2018) 8:1026 | DOI:10.1038/s41598-018-19366-2 based on our weighted distance matrix and the MEGA distance matrix, respectively. They are approximate to one another, but ours (Fig. 6f) has a better resolution for discriminating the major discrepancies (e.g., FP565576.7, AC185982.3 and FO203515.7) observed on the phylogentic trees (Fig. 6b-e) . Accordingly, we track out that FP565576.7 (114.29 Kbp, H. sapiens chr10 clone CH17-310O3) has a 35.74-Kbp segment of 7,149 copies of a 5-bp (TGGAA) unit (i.e., a cluster of (TGGAA) 7149 ); AC185982.3 (179.50 Kbp, P. troglodytes chr15 clone CH251-487L24) has a 53.18-Kbp segment of 311 copies of a 171-bp unit; and FO203515.7 (147.99 Kbp, H. sapiens chr9 clone RP11-366F14) has a 9.00-Kbp segment of 1,801 copies of a 5-bp (TCATT) unit. These findings demonstrate that our method has a better resolution for taxa containing high copy numbers of repeats. We thus use our method to construct phylogenetic networks throughout the next sections when dealing with a number of large and divergent sequences, on which traditional approaches may not work. Table S1 ), preventing us from exhaustively analysing them one by one, we intend to evaluate the chosen examples of predicted long repeats (e.g., LTR retrotransposons and satellite DNA). Hence we conduct de novo predictions of long repeats from the 1.30-Mbp segment (Supplementary Dataset 1), trace homologues, and analyse evolutionary relationships.",

We use each of them to do the BLAST search against the NCBI nr/nt database and select top 10 hits (if applicable) to compose a dataset for phylogenetics analysis. Such LTR retrotransposons are mono-centred on the phylogenetic network (Fig. 7c) , coinciding with their close locations (Fig. 7a,b) . These findings weaken the impacts of interspersed repeats, thus strengthen the impacts of tandem repeats to be elucidated. Tracing tandem repeats of the deleted target segment. Using TRF software 29 , we predict 2,531 tandem repeats (Supplementary Dataset 2) , more than the records (1,396 tandem repeats) in the RepeatMask/ Repbase database 28 (Supplementary Table S1 ). The TRF program 29 can list \"period size\" and \"consensus size\", which are usually the same. We use the former for simple notation throughout this paper. We name core-units (CUs) (e.g., 173U for a 173-bp monomer) and core-unit repeats (CURs) (e.g., 173U1020C for 1,020 copies of 173U). A CUR is composed of multiple copies of a CU. The core-unit repeats (CURs) here are equivalent to the higher-order repeats (HOR) elsewhere 16 . For instance, 173U1020C containing 1,020 copies of 173U (a 173-bp monomer) yields a 176.46-Kbp segment (from 7 to 175,880 bp) of the 1.30-Mbp segment, which corresponds and phylogenetic networks (f,g). The bootstrap consensus ME (b) and NJ (c) trees constructed by the MEGA6 package have a low confidence at arguable sub-branches. But the NJ (d) and FastME (e) trees constructed by our method have a better resolution at the questionable sub-branches. The SplitsTree networks (f,g) constructed by using our weighted distance matrix (f) and the MEGA distance matrix (g), respectively, illustrate that our method has a better resolution for the taxa containing high copy numbers of repeats (e.g., we track out that FP565576.7 has a 35.74-Kbp segment of (TGGAA) 7149 in the main text). to Block I (227.10 Kbp) in the assigned centromeric region of GRCh38p10.chrY (Fig. 5) . Likewise, 5U41068C containing 41,068 copies of 5U (a 5-bp monomer, GAATG) yields a 205.34-Kbp segment (from 995,979 to 1,203,802 bp) of the 1.30-Mbp segment, which corresponds to a part of Block III (848.71 Kbp) in the assigned pericentromeric region of GRCh38p10.chrY (Fig. 5) . Each is close to a BAC's size (>150.0 Kbp). We choose long tandem repeats to do the BLAST search against the NCBI nr/nt database, and select top 10 hits (if applicable) from each search to compose a dataset for pursuing our phylogenetics analysis. We construct phylogenetic networks both at the CUs level (Fig. 8a) and at the CURs level (Fig. 8b-e) . Under the circumstances tested, all CUs (Fig. 8a ) and most CURs (Fig. 8c-e) with their traceable homologues demonstrate random distributions, respectively, in a harmonious state (i.e., a landscape compatibility), regardless of certain outliers (Fig. 8b) .",

We develop an alignment-free and bootstrap-free method for phylogenetics analysis. This study also sets up an itinerary of using the GenomeLandscaper method (Figs 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8) . As a proof-of-concept study, we created a galaxy of genome-fingerprints maps (GGFM) (Figs 2, 3 and 4) for the human Y chromosomes (GRCh.chrY 12, 13 , HuRef. chrY [4] [5] [6] and YH.chrY 7 ) and conducted multifaceted assessments on their global architectures (Figs 2, 3, 4 , 5, 6, 7 and 8). Through data-mining approach without prior knowledge or biases (Fig. 1) , our data-driven computational analyses (Figs 3, 4 , 5, 6, 7 and 8) uncovered and characterised the questionable 1.30-Mbp target segment (Supplementary Dataset 1) that distinguished GRCh38p1.chrY (and throughout GRCh38p10.chrY) from GRCh37p13.chrY, HuRef.chrY and YH.chrY (Figs 2, 3, 4 and 5) . We elucidated that (1) it was the 1.30-Mbp target segment (Supplementary Dataset 1) , identified in the modelled centromeric and pericentromeric region debuting in GRCh38p1.chrY throughout GRCh38p10.chrY (Fig. 5) , that contributed to the observed long sharp straight line on the GGFM (Figs 3 and 4) ; and (2) the orphan BAC-sized CURs (Fig. 8b) Dataset 1 and Dataset 2) . This proof-of-concept study validates the efficacy of our GenomeLandscaper method (Fig. 1 ). Hence we have established an effective method to display, detect, delete and analyse the large-scale repetitive regions, thus retrospectively assessing their impacts on the global architectures of assembled chromosomes. We expect that the GenomeLandscaper method could be broadly applicable to understanding and assessing the yet-untouchable centromeric and pericentromeric regions of variants from the human 1,000 genomes project 2,3 and other mammalian genomes. Such endeavours should benefit improvements of the reference genome GRCh38 1 and the 1,000 genomes 2,3 , which is valuable for precise medicine since the roles of centromeres in chromosomal behaviours and clinical diseases are increasingly appreciated 30, 31 .",

            "text": "We would emphasise the technical features of our GenomeLandscaper method (Fig. 1) . First, our GenomeFingerprinter algorithm circularises a linear sequence (Fig. 1a) to avoid interference from arbitrary cut-off sites of a sequence 19 , thus ensures the circularised 3D-map (Figs 1d and 2a) solely representing the given sequence. This feature improves the accuracy of computing a distance matrix (Fig. 1g) based on values of geometric centres of the circularised 3D-maps (Figs 1d and 2a) . Second, we operate map-to-map comparison (Figs 2, 3 and 4) , instead of base-to-base comparison (see Fig. 5 ), to relieve computation burdens. This alignment-free method allows us comparing large genomes in a big-picture view at a large scale (Figs 2, 3 and 4) . Third, we weight the geometrical mean of radiuses (equation (2)) of the circularised 3D-maps to create a weighted distance matrix (Fig. 1g) , thus discriminate a pair of overlapped 3D-maps that share a geometric centre but have different shapes. This feature improves the accuracy of clustering both distant and close relatives (Figs 6, 7 and 8) . Fourth, we create a weighted distance matrix (Fig. 1g) using the values of geometric centres of the circularised 3D-maps (Fig. 1d) , and conduct calculations in the mathematical real number system (equations (1) to (6)). Whenever calculating the same set of sequences should result in the same weighted distance matrix (Fig. 1g) , thus leading to the sole phylogenetic tree (Fig. 1h) and phylogenetic network (Fig. 1i) . As exemplified by the small-sized mitochondria genomes (<17.0 Kbp) of the primates, our tree was approximate to the traditional bootstrap consensus tree (Fig. 1) . So did the moderate-sized BAC clones (>150.0 Kbp) (Fig. 6) . Our NJ and FastME trees (Fig. 6d,e) and SplitsTree network (Fig. 6f) have a better resolution for the taxa containing high copy numbers of repeats. Our alignment-free and bootstrap-free method is faster and has worked effectively for cluster approximations in our cases (Figs 6, 7 and 8) . Altogether, these features allow us analysing a number of large genomes (Mbp) (Figs 2, 3 and 4) and divergent sequences (variations in size, gap, and divergence) (Figs 6, 7 and 8) , on which the traditional approaches 21-25 may not work.",

We have found that there is a landscape compatibility of chromosome architecture among relatives under comparison (Figs 3 and 4) . A misassembled segment can be detected if and only if it breaks such a landscape compatibility (Fig. 3) , which can guide the PRED-deletion of the misassembled segment (Fig. 4) . As such, we have traced down the questionable 1.30-Mbp target segment (Supplementary Dataset 1) from GRCh38p1.chrY throughout GRCh38p10. chrY (Figs 3, 4 and 5) . Furthermore, we have found multiple lines of evidence on its likely misassembling of the 1.30-Mbp target segment (Supplementary Dataset 1). First, we located it in the modelled centromeric and pericentromeric region of GRCh38p10.chrY (Fig. 5) . Second, we decomposed it into sub-constituents such as BACs (Fig. 6) , interspersed repeats (Fig. 7) and tandem repeats (Fig. 8) . And we traced back their homologues from heterogeneous chromosomes beyond the human Y chromosome (Figs 6, 7 and 8) . Third, we elucidated that among the examined tandem repeats, all CUs (Fig. 8a ) and most CURs (Fig. 8c-e) were of reasonable quality, but the orphan BAC-sized CURs (up to 33.14% of the 1.30-Mbp segment) were likely over-repeated (Fig. 8b) . Such data-driven analyses without prior knowledge or biases (Fig. 1) should offer an informative starting-point for the community to retrospectively verify the modelled centromeric and pericentromeric regions that caused dramatic changes from GRCh37p13.chrY to GRCh38p1.chY (and throughout GRCh38p10.chrY) (Figs 3, 4, 5 and 8) . This proof-of-concept study demonstrates the power of our GenomeLandscaper method (Fig. 1) , as discussed below.",

Further, our GenomeFingerprinter algorithm 19 only calculates non-N (A, T, G and C) bases, bypassing gaps and linking two non-N bases adjacent to the distal ends of a homopolymer of Ns, thus presents the effective genome. These advantages allow us to assess incomplete genomes regardless of gaps, sizes and divergences. A batch of incomplete genomes can be displayed as a GGFM (Figs 2, 3 and 4 ) and compared at the chromosome architecture level. As a result, we have detected the incredible discrepancies among the human Y chromosomes (GRCh.chrY 12, 13 , HuRef.chrY [4] [5] [6] and YH.chrY 7 ), as well as the four releases (GRCh37p13.chrY, GRCh38p1.chrY, GRCh38p2.chrY and GRCh38p7.chrY) of the GRCh.chrY assembly per se (Figs 2, 3 and 4) .",

The 3D-trajectory map (X-Y-Z) (Fig. 2a) and three 2D-trajectory maps (X-Y, X-Z, Y-Z) (Figs 3d-f and 4d-f) are the most sensitive, another two 2D-trajectory maps (X-Length, Y-Length) (Figs 3a,b and 4a,b) are less sensitive, and the 2D-trajectory map (Z-Length) (Figs 3c and 4c) is the least sensitive. Hence, the components Xn and Yn of the three-dimensional coordinates carry more information about the distribution biases of bases. The 3D-trajectory map (X-Y-Z) (Figs. 2a) and 2D-trajectory map (X-Y) (Figs 3d and 4d ) amplify such effects of both Xn and Yn on disturbing the landscape compatibility, thus yielding more complex and sensitive profiles. Two 2D-trajectory maps (X-Length, Y-Length) (Figs 3a,b and 4a ,b) are easier (due to simplicity) to guide the PRED-deletion of an identified misassembled segment (Figs 3 and 4) . In addition, the 2D-contour map (X-Y) (Fig. 2b-f ) with high-resolution genome fingerprints is the most sensitive in discriminating close relatives (HuRef.chrY, YH.chrY, GRCh38p1.chrY and GRCh38p2.chrY).",

We deliberately hypothesised that the extra turning-changed long sharp straight line on the GGFM (Fig. 3) resulted from likely misassembling of GRCh38p1.chrY, when compared to its antecedent GRCh37p13.chrY. This hypothesis simplified the logic of validations: if the antecedent were (and should have been over time) correct, then the descendent with a newly-introduced extra segment should be incorrect; and vice versa. Accordingly, we conducted the PRED-deletion of the 1.30-Mbp segment (Supplementary Dataset 1) , guided by the turning-changed long sharp straight line on the GGFM (Fig. 4a) . To justify its likely misassembling, we found multiple lines of evidence. First, the PRED-deletion of the 1.30-Mbp target segment (Supplementary Dataset 1) from GRCh38p1.chrY (Fig. 4 ) did rescue the landscape compatibility, matching its antecedent GRCh37p13.chrY. Second, its sub-constituents such as BACs (Fig. 6) , LTR retrotransposons (Fig. 7) , and tandem repeats (Fig. 8) (Figs 3 and 4) .",

            "text": "Furthermore, to justify our findings from data-driven computational analyses, we conducted retrospective researches in literatures. We tracked out the centromere model representations debuting in GRCh38p1.chrY (DYZ3 0.23 Mbp) and GRCh38p1.chrX (DXZ1 3.60 Mbp), where the assigned gap placeholders were replaced by the models (DYZ3 and DXZ1) 16 that were simulated based on a centromere database derived from the HuRef WGS reads library 6 . GRCh38p1.chrY bears a modelled centromere 1,16 , rather than a real one that was assembled from original reads. These facts are consistent with our findings. First, the 1.30-Mbp target segment (Supplementary Dataset 1) of GRCh38p1.chrY (from 9,999,936 bp to 11,299,986 bp) roughly equals the assigned gap placeholder of GRCh37p13.chrY (from 10,248,904 bp to 13,291,760 bp). Second, the 1.30-Mbp segment covers three blocks that are scattered on GRCh38p10.chrY (Fig. 5) . Block I (227.10 Kbp) (Fig. 5 ) was documented to be the DYZ3 (0.23 Mbp) alpha satellite array 16 that was simulated from the HuRef WGS reads library 6 . Block II (100.15 Kbp) and Block III (848.71 Kbp) (Fig. 5 ) remained unclear about their assembling processes that have caused dramatic changes from GRCh37p13.chrY to GRCh38p1.chrY throughout GRCh38p10.chrY (Figs 3, 4 and 5). Third, the orphan BAC-sized CURs (Fig. 8b) are the individual parts of Block I (227.10 Kbp) and Block III (848.71 Kbp), which locate in the centromeric and pericentromeric regions of GRCh38p10.chrY (Fig. 5 (Figs 5 and 8b) . Fourth, these orphan BAC-sized CURs are exceptional outliers on the phylogenetic network (Fig. 8b) . They are scattered on and up to 33.14% of the 1.30-Mbp segment (Supplementary Dataset 1 and Dataset 2), which mainly contributed to the turning-changed long sharp straight line on the GGFM (Figs 3 and 4) . Such findings coincide with the fact that the monomer ordering of the chromosome-specific alpha-satellite repeats was proportional to that observed in the initial read database, but the long-range ordering of repeats was inferred by a graph-based simulation in the modelled centromere of GRCh38p1.chrY 1, [16] [17] [18] . We conclude that the orphan BAC-sized CURs (Fig. 8b) are likely over-repeated, lacking traceable homologues at this moment.",

By using the same graph-based simulation method 16 , the subfamily-specific 24-mers for HSat2 and HSat3 were recently modelled (each cluster is small, <20 Kbp) in the pericentromeric regions adjacent to centromeres of the human chromosomes 1 and Y 32 . The sizes of the predominant HSat3-rich arrays on the Y chromosomes were estimated to distribute differently within the distinct Y haplogroups 32 . The sizes of HSat3A6 (DYZ1) arrays from 396 individuals varied over an order of magnitude (7 to 98 Mbp) 32 . Thus we would suggest that both the core k-mers (i.e. CUs) and their copy numbers (i.e., CURs) should be equally concerned on the case-by-case basis. The modelled centromeric and pericentromeric regions debuting in GRCh38p1.chrY are not yet true, linear assemblies 1,16,32 ; rather, they are modelled reference regions to be used for mimicking and mapping target short-reads at this stage. Hence the true CUs and CURs discussed in our cases remain to be elucidated in the future.",

            "text": "With and without the modelled centromeric and pericentromeric regions, the two counterparts (GRCh38p1. chrY and GRCh37p13.chrY) have provided excellent cases for a proof-of-concept study via data-mining without prior knowledge or biases, thus have validated the efficacy and demonstrated the power of our GenomeLandscaper method. The itinerary has worked effectively and should be generally applicable. However, we remind that it deserves to investigate whether the 1.30-Mbp segment (Supplementary Dataset 1) is a true intrinsic segment on the human Y chromosome. Theoretically, PCR reactions could be determinate, but could be undoable in this case owing to two-faceted difficulties: amplification of the 1.30-Mbp segment (Supplementary Dataset 1) as a whole is technically unachievable, while amplifying sizable parts of its elements is challenging in designing proper primers. The desired primers must cover the sub-constituents, such as BACs (Fig. 6) , LTR retrotranspons (Fig. 7) , and tandem repeats (Fig. 8) , but also avoid similar sequences that might be scattered on the human Y chromosome. These tasks are hardly achievable due to the natures of eukaryotes repeats 27, 33 . Historical experimental data (including physical mapping, see reference No.32 and others therein) would be inadequate at the level of single-base resolution to discriminate arguable sequences of repeats in genomics. We would recommend sequencing and assembling the real centromeric and pericentromeric regions of the human Y chromosomes by future technology (once it is applicable) 8, [34] [35] [36] . With true, linear reference regions for pursuing our GGFM comparisons, one could ultimately justify whether the 1.30-Mbp segment (Supplementary Dataset 1) containing the orphan BAC-sized CURs (Fig. 8b) might result from an artefact or should be a true intrinsic segment. Therefore, the graph-based simulation method modelled the centromeric 16 and pericentromeric 32 regions in the human reference genome GRCh38 1 , which opened a door to model the yet-untouchable centromeric and pericentromeric regions of mammalian genomes. Our GenomeLandscaper method offers a geometric analysis means to retrospectively assess such modelled regions, which opens a window to assess their impacts on the global architectures of assembled chromosomes.",
