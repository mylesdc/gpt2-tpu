Many will attempt to minimize contacts with other individuals in order to protect themselves from infection and possibly death. This process is called social distancing. Social distancing strategies include restricting socializing and travel, and using barrier protections. We use modeling to show that for short-term outbreaks, social distancing can have a large influence on reducing outbreak morbidity and mortality. In particular, public health agencies working together with the media can significantly reduce the severity of an outbreak by providing timely accounts of new infections and deaths. Our models show that the most effective strategy to reduce infections is to provide this information as early as possible, though providing it well into the course of the outbreak can still have a significant effect. However, our models for long-term outbreaks indicate that reporting historic infection data can result in more infections than with no reporting at all. We examine three types of media influence and we illustrate the media influence with a simulated outbreak of a generic emerging infectious disease in a small city. Social distancing can never be complete; however, for a spectrum of outbreaks, we show that leaving isolation (stopping applying social distancing measures) for up to 4 hours each day has modest effect on the overall morbidity and mortality.",

In response to media reports of outbreaks, many individuals take steps, including social distance, to protect themselves and their immediate families from severe infection and significant chance of death. Social distancing refers to individuals attempting to minimize or eliminate contacts with others (those outside of their immediate family), and can take many forms, including restricting or ending socializing and travel, and using barrier protections. For example, during the 2002-2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak, social distancing behavior included restricting local and long-distance travel, using face masks, and using extra disinfectants [1] . Social distancing for sexually transmitted diseases typically includes using barrier protections [2] . Both face masks and hand hygiene have been shown to be effective social distancing measures for influenza [3] .",

Social distancing moves an individual from the susceptible class directly to the social distancing class and they play no role in the disease transmission. However, it is clearly unrealistic for an individual to remain completely isolated for weeks or months: individuals must venture out into the public to buy food and some will require medial care. Our long-lived models explicitly allow individuals to return from the social distancing class to the susceptible class. Our simulations show for a short-lived outbreak, that allowing individuals to return from isolation (stop applying social distancing measures) has little effect on the attack rate and maximal daily prevalence when individuals are allowed to leave for up to 4 hours each day. Therefore we focus on a short-lived outbreak with strict social distance (no return from social distancing) where we can do analytics. This seems to be the first study to address the question of partial social distancing.",

Our models incorporate a different paradigm and does not change the transmission rate; they instead reduce the number of susceptible individuals. Other authors [10, 17, 18] consider vaccination strategies, which can be considered as a form of social distancing. Our models can be viewed as vaccination models where the number vaccinated is proportional to the number of infections and death reported by the media. In addition, they also accounts for any other social distancing measures.",

In particular, the transmission rate b and disease related mortality, d, are selected to ensure 15% mortality for infected individuals and the basic reproduction number is R 0~2 :9 (see the Results Section). Individuals are assumed to be infectious for five days. We assume that the outbreak occurs in a small city with a population of 50,000 and that the disease is first reported on by health care workers and the media when there are 30 infected individuals. All of the parameters used in the model simulations are in Table 1 .",
