Accordingly, the serological detection of corresponding antibodies would be beneficial to diagnose PEDV indirectly to control the disease. In this study, an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based on the recombinant truncated spike (S) protein of PEDV was developed and validated. Results: The reaction conditions of the developed indirect ELISA were optimized. This indirect ELISA was compared to indirect immunoinfluscent assay (IFA), and the overall coincidence rate was 96.74% based on testing 368 clinical serum samples with different PEDV antibody levels. No cross-reactivity with other common swine pathogens was detected for the developed S1 indirect ELISA. Finally, the S1 indirect ELISA was applied to detect serum antibodies of 3304 field samples collected from different pig farms in eastern China, and it presented an overall substantial agreement on the PEDV infection status.",

            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) is a highly contagious swine enteritis caused by porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), which belongs to the order Nidovirales and family Coronaviridae. The typical symptoms of PED are diarrhea, vomiting, and dehydration, which can be especially dangerous to suckling piglets [1, 2] . The mortality of neonatal piglets younger than 5 days old can approach 100% [3] [4] [5] . PED first appeared in Britain in 1971, followed by an outbreak of diarrhea in several pig farms in Belgium in 1977 [6] . These outbreaks led to identification of a coronavirus-like particle named CV777, which is now recognized as the classic PEDV strain. In recent years, PED epidemics have become prevalent in swine-raising countries in Asia, including South Korea, China, Japan, and Vietnam, and can cause enormous economic loss [7, 8] .",

S protein is located on the surface of the virus particle. It is categorized as a type I membrane fusion protein and has the significant biological effect of binding to target cell receptors and entering the cell through plasma membrane fusion [9, 10] . The S protein has higher antigenicity than any of the other PEDV proteins, and anti-S antibodies detected in PEDV-infected pigs persist longer than anti-N antibodies [11] . The S protein can be separated into the S1 (1-789 aa) subunit and the S2 (790-1383 aa) subunit [12] . The S1 subunit is the extracellular domain and can recognize and bind to target cell receptors [13] , and it is closely linked to the formation of neutralizing antibodies. Therefore, this study selected a gene fragment within the S1 subunit as a coating antigen to develop an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method for the detection of PEDV antibodies.",

These five farms were located in areas with no previous history of enteric signs compatible with viral diarrhea, were PEDV RNA negative by real-time RT-PCR based on a single collection, and were considered non-exposed to PEDV. Three hundred and forty four serum samples from nursery pigs without PEDV exposure were collected from six farms between 2011 and 2015. These samples were confirmed to be positive for anti-PoRV antibodies (3 farms, n = 149) or anti-TGEV antibodies (3 farms, n = 195) by both IFA and commercial ELISA kits (obtained from Ingenasa).

            "text": "Since December 2010, a large-scale outbreak of diarrhea has been observed in swine farms in China. Accumulated evidence indicates that this large-scale outbreak of diarrhea were caused by highly virulent PEDV variants [17, 18] . Serological assays can quickly detect large numbers of samples with both high sensitivity and specificity. Several indirect ELISA have been developed based on either whole PEDV preparations or recombinant viral proteins [19] [20] [21] . The S protein of PEDV has numerous epitopes and highly antigenic index regions that induce the production of neutralizing antibodies [10, 22, 23] , and anti-S antibodies detected in PEDV-infected pigs persist longer than anti-N antibodies [11] , thus, we choose S protein as the diagnostic antigen. The recombinant S1 protein was applied to establish an indirect ELISA, and its reaction conditions were optimized. As PEDV is an enteric virus, it directly infects and damages enterocytes. Mucosal IgA, but not systemic IgG, plays a crucial role in protection [24, 25] . In this research, the titers of IgA in the serum were tested for serological evaluation and indirect diagnosis of PEDV infection. Of the 1125 serum samples which were PEDV exposed, the overall positive rate of the antibody is 91.29%, which were varied from 78 to 100% between 10 farms. Of the 482 serum samples which were PEDV non-exposed, the overall positive rate of the antibody is 6.43%, which were varied from 5.1 to 7.8% between 5 farms. The evaluated ELISA presented an overall substantial agreement on the PEDV infection status of the field swine serum samples. The intra-and inter-assay variability tests proved that this ELISA method had good repeatability. When testing other positive serum related to swine viral pathogens, this established ELISA demonstrated no cross-reactivity to them. Further, the overall rate of coincidence of this ELISA was calculated at 96.74% compared with IFA, proving that the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of this ELISA method were favorable.",
