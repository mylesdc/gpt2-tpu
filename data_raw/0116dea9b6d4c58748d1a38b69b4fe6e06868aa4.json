Dynamic changes of nitric oxide (NO) levels secreted by PAM and IM with stimulation of different doses of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were investigated by Griess method, and the viability of the PAM and IM cells was investigated by MTT assay. Flow cytometry, fluorescence quantitative PCR and ELISA techniques were used to measure cell phenotype, gene expression and cytokine secretion, respectively. The PAM and IM cells in normal healthy pigs showed heterogeneity with 95.42\u00b11.51% and 31.99\u00b15.84% of CD163+ macrophage, respectively. The NO level in IM was significantly higher versus PAM after LPS treatment. Consistently, the ratio of Arg I/iNOS in IM was much lower than that in PAM, suggesting that the PAM belong to M2 macrophages and the IM belong to M1 macrophages. The PAM and IM cells in normal healthy pigs also showed plasticity. The Arg I/iNOS ratio and TIMP1/MMP12 ratio were significantly decreased in LPS-or LPS+IFN\u03b3-treated PAM and IM, suggesting that cells were polarized towards M1 macrophages under LPS or LPS+IFN\u03b3 stimulation. On the contrary, IL-4 and IL-13 stimulation on PAM and IM lead to M2 polarization. A similar result was found in IL-1\u03b2 gene expression and TNF\u03b1 secretion. In conclusion, porcine macrophages have shown heterogeneity and plasticity on polarization under the stimulation of LPS, IFN\u03b3, IL-4 and IL-13.",

            "text": "Macrophages form a front line of the host defense system that can express diverse activities depending on the stimuli encountered. Many of these activities appear to be mutually antagonistic in nature, such as pro-inflammatory versus anti-inflammatory. To determine the macrophage functional status, readouts such as cytokine expression patterns and the ratio of arginase I (Arg I) to inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) or the ratio of the tissue inhibitor of Metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP1) to the matrix metalloproteinases-12(MMP12) gene expression were used. What needs to be emphasized is that these functional phenotypes are reversible since macrophages are very flexible in adapting to changes in their microenvironment, suggesting their potential to be adjusted for therapeutic benefit.",

M2 polarization of macrophages can be induced by IL-4 or IL-13, which mediates tissue repair and immune escape of pathogens, and thus lead to persistent infection. The inflammatory monocytes rapidly migrate into alveolar airspaces after lung infection and are reported to be the main effectors of acute lung injury and infection-related mortality (Duan et al., 2012) . The in vivo function of less mature forms of porcine monocytes, which are believed to play an important role as precursors of inflammatory macrophages in mice and humans, has not been reported and remains completely unknown in pigs (Ondrackova et al., 2010) . The aim of this study was to discover the heterogeneity and plasticity of porcine alveolar macrophage (PAM) and pulmonary interstitial macrophage (IM) cells in normal healthy pigs in vitro, which will be helpful for the understanding of pathologic mechanisms and the prevention of swine infectious disease.",

NO is an important early signal in many pathophysiologic processes. The results in Fig. 2 showed that 10 ng/ml LPS was the optimal dose for NO production in stimulating PAM and IM cells and the NO level was undetectable in 100 ng/ml and 1 \u03bcg/ml LPS groups. The viability of the PAM and IM cells were shown that no significant changes among these groups, which suggested that the sharp decrease in NO production at 100 ng/ml and 1 \u03bcg/ml LPS treated PAM and IM cells was not due to the harm of high doses of LPS to these cells. The NO level in the supernatant of IM cells treated with different doses of LPS was much higher than in PAM cells (P<0.05 or P<0.01), indicating that IM cells were more prone to be M1 cells, and the PAM cells were more prone to be M2 cells.",

This competition for substrate acts as an approach to control the production of NO (Nelson et al., 2011) . The mRNA expression of Arg I and iNOS genes are marker genes for M2 and M1 polarization, respectively. Therefore, the levels of iNOS and Arg I are frequently used as indexes of the M1 and M2 functional macrophage phenotype, respectively (Chiang et al., 2008; Davis et al., 2013) . Based our results in Fig. 3 , the Arg I/iNOS ratio of IM was significantly lower than in PAM cells, indicating the heterogeneity in polarization of different macrophages in the lung of swine. Specifically, IM cells were M1 cells and the PAM cells were M2 cells. After treatment of LPS, the Arg I/iNOS ratio in PAM and IM cells significantly decreased, which was consistent with the results of NO levels in PAM and IM cells (Fig. 2) .",

            "text": "From the results in Fig. 4 , it can be concluded that PAM and IM macrophages exhibited plasticity. The initial stimulation of LPS, LPS+IFN\u03b3 on PAM and IM cells in vitro resulted in M1 polarization, while the stimulation of IL-4 and IL-13 resulted in M2 polarization. Furthermore, this initial polarization was completely reversed by the secondary stimulation using the opposite polarizing cytokines. LPS and IFN\u03b3 stimulated PAM cells are shown to express M1 molecules, whereas IL-4 and IL-13 stimulated PAM cells are shown to express M2 molecules (Wang et al., 2017) . Macrophage arginase expression is upregulated in response to anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-4 and IL-13, forming iNOS-expressing M1 cells into arginase-expressing M2 cells . The resulting Arg I/iNOS ratio in PAM cells by initial treatment with IL-4 and IL-13, showed that the IL-13 stimulated PAM cells expressed a higher Arg I/iNOS ratio versus IL-4 stimulation, suggesting that IL-13 is more critical in M2 polarization, compared to IL-4. TIMP1/MMP12, another parameter of macrophage polarization, showed similar results as the Arg I/iNOS ratio in PAM and IM cells after the initial and secondary stimulation (Fig. 4E,F) . The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are zinc-and calcium-dependent enzymes that regulate the physiological and pathological metabolisms of collagen-based tissues (Cvikl et al., 2018) . MMP12 is an elastase (also known as metalloelastase) that mainly functions in the degradation of elastin (Barroso et al., 2017) . Like other members of MMP family, MMP12 is produced as a proenzyme, mainly by macrophages. TIMP-1 is a very potent inhibitor of MMPs, including MMP12 (Salmela et al., 2001) . The skewing of macrophages to the M1 phenotype enhanced MMP expression and depressed TIMP expression, while skewing to the M2 phenotype enhanced TIMP1 expression (Annamalai et al., 2018) . Therefore, the TIMP1/MMP12 ratio might be related to the polarization of macrophage, which indicates tissue remodeling (Bernasconi et al., 2015) . The results in Fig. 4E and F suggested that the TIMP1/MMP12 ratio was relevant to the M2/M1 balance, showing plasticity in polarization of swine lung macrophages in the environment containing LPS, LPS+IFN\u03b3, IL-4 or IL-13. MMP12 contributes to the proliferation of mouse macrophages as well as secretion of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF\u03b1 through the ERK/P38 MAPK signaling pathway (Guan et al., 2019) . The imbalance between TIMPs and MMPs has been implicated in the progression of inflammation, facilitating the understanding of pathologic mechanisms and prevention of swine infectious disease.",

The TNF\u03b1 production was significantly increased (P<0.01) in the initial or secondary LPS-or LPS+IFN\u03b3treated PAM and IM cells. On the contrary, the TNF\u03b1 production was significantly decreased in initial IL-4-or IL-13-treated PAM cells and IM cells (P<0.01). All the results of IL-1\u03b2 relative expression, the ratio of Arg I/iNOS, TIMP1/MMP12 and TNF\u03b1 secretion in PAM and IM cells suggested that LPS and IFN\u03b3 stimulated PAM and IM cells polarized towards M1, and the IL-4 and IL-13 polarized towards M2. These data demonstrated that in vitro macrophages are capable of complete repolarization from M1 to M2 or M2 to M1, in response to changes in the cytokine environment. These changes in macrophage polarization are rapid and occur at the levels of gene expression, cytokine secretion and NO production. These findings not only revealed the dynamic changes in macrophage polarization, but also provided a basis for macrophage-centered diagnostic and therapeutic strategies (Sica and Mantovani, 2012; Zhu et al., 2014) .",

Switching LPS to IL-4, and LPS+IFN\u03b3 to IL-13 stimulating condition, can result in uniform changes in profiles of polarization marker genes, and vice versa.
