However, the 'humanization' of murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) is a timeconsuming and expensive process that has the inherent drawback of potentially altering antigenic specificity and/or affinity. The immortalization of human B cells represents an alternative for obtaining human mAbs, but relies on the availability of biological samples from vaccinated individuals or convalescent patients. In this work we describe a novel approach to generate fully human mAbs by combining a humanized mouse model with a new B cell immortalization technique.",

            "text": "Hyper-immune sera containing polyclonal immunoglobulins (Igs) have been widely used in both therapeutic and prophylactic clinical settings [1] . However, the use of polyclonal sera was associated with several problems, such as the stimulation of allergic reactions, low reproducibility between clinical batches and high off-label use, which finally caused a decline in their use [2] . The advent of technologies to make monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) derived from animals, especially mice, has overcome many of the problems associated with the use of polyclonal sera. The technology to make monoclonal cell lines of antibody-producing cells by fusing antibody producing plasma cells with myeloma cells was described for the first time in 1975 by Milstein and Kohler [3] . The therapeutic potential of mAbs was immediately recognized and in 1980 the first mAb, OKT3, was approved for therapeutic applications. This antibody inactivates T cells, thereby preventing rejections of organ transplants [4] . However, because of the animal origin of the first generation of mAbs that were used in clinical trials, human subjects treated with these antibodies developed vigorous immune reactions against the animal proteins, which were thereby eliminated preventing their therapeutic actions [5] . To overcome these problems technologies were developed to diminish the immunogenicity of mouse antibodies by replacing part or the complete mouse antibody backbone by its human equivalent, first generating chimeric, and subsequently fully humanized antibodies [6] . In a parallel approach transgenic mice bearing the human Ig region were created to obtain fully human antibodies following immunization. The use of these mice obviates the elaborate molecular engineering of antibodies that is needed to humanize antibodies generated in wild-type mice, however, the maturation process of the mouse B cells expressing human Igs is different from that of fully human B cells [7] .",

            "text": "Immortalization of B cells from immune humans seems to be the logical strategy to avoid these problems. However, the methods to achieve this goal have showed low efficiencies, although some progress has recently been reported [8, 9] . Nevertheless, the major disadvantage of human B cells immortalization is the need for cells from either vaccinated individuals or patients who had recovered from an infection. Thus, to fully exploit the Ig repertoire of human B cells in an in vivo setting, we explored the possibility to raise mAbs following de novo induction of human B cell responses in mice carrying elements of the human immune system (HIS). HIS mice are generated by engrafting immunodeficient mice with human hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) with or without human lymphoid tissues from fetal origin [10, 11, 12] . In particular, mice deficient for the recombinase activating gene-2 (Rag2) and the common gamma chain of the IL-2 receptor (Il2rg) on a BALB/c or a non-obese diabetic (NOD) background are permissive for human HSC xenografts. Inoculation of newborn mice from these strains with human HSC of fetal or umbilical cord blood origin gives rise to robust engraftment of a number of immune cells, including T, B, NK and dendritic cells. In this work, we describe a convenient approach to generate fully human mAbs based on the immunization of BALB/c Rag2 2/2 IL-2Rcc 2/2 engrafted with human CD34 + CD38 2 HSC [13, 14] . To this end, HIS mice were immunized with commercial vaccines against hepatitis B virus (HBV) and tetanus. Following immunization, human CD19 + B cells were sorted based on surface CD27 expression, as a marker of memory phenotype, and the isotype of surface Igs. The sorted B cell populations were immortalized in vitro by retroviral transduction with human B cell lymphoma (BCL)-6 and BCL-XL genes and antigen-specific B cell clones were established and characterized.",

As reported previously, multilineage human hematopoietic reconstitution is observed in HIS mice, which demonstrate human thymopoiesis, B cell differentiation, NK cell and plasmacytoid dendritic cell development, and myelopoiesis [10, 13, 14, 15, 16] . Human immune cells accumulate in lymphoid tissues, and several B cell subsets are observed in HIS mice ( Figure 1B) . We analyzed the human B cell repertoire present in naive HIS mice by using B cell receptor (BCR) immunoscope analysis based on quantitative PCR of Ig variable (V H ) and constant (C H ) region gene segments [17] . Due to the lack of human spleen samples, the cells isolated from HIS mouse spleens, which contained sufficient numbers of human B cells to perform the immunoscope analysis, were compared to control human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) samples, which were considered acceptable for the purpose of the performed comparison. We observed that IgM-expressing B cells as well as Ig isotype-switched B cells are found in naive HIS mice ( Figure 1C) . The vast majority of B cells of HIS mice expressed an IgM (97.961.0%), whereas IgG (1.861.0%) and IgA (0.0760.04%) expressing B cells represented minor populations. Only the frequency of IgA-expressing B cells was found significantly higher in control human PBMC samples (p,0.0001). At 10-14 weeks post-transplantation (i.e. in steady state conditions), the human Ig concentrations in the blood were 12268 mg/ml (IgM) and 143612 mg/ml (IgG) ( Figure 1D ), as previously reported [8, 16] . In comparison, the normal range for Ig concentration in healthy humans is 400-3100 mg IgM/ml and 7200-14700 mg IgG/ml. In brief, despite a low frequency of IgG-expressing cells, both human IgM and IgG accumulated in the plasma of ,3 month-old HIS mice to levels representing around 10% and 1% of adult human IgM and IgG concentrations, respectively.",

This observation suggests that HIS mice contain a broad variety of naive IgM + B cell clones. The V H -family usage was large and similar to control human PBMC ( Table 1) . The BCR immunoscope analysis was also performed for IgG and IgA repertoires and we observed more restricted repertoires, as expected from B cells undergoing clonal selection and Ig class switch recombination ( Figure S1 ).

We therefore cell sorted several different CD19 + CD27 + B cell subsets from individual HIS mice. We used two strategies to isolate the following human B cell (CD45 + CD19 + ) subsets from BM and spleens of vaccinated HIS mice: (i) CD27 hi CD38 hi , (ii) CD27 + CD38 lo/int IgD + , and (iii) CD27 + CD38 lo/int IgD 2 on the one hand ( Figure 3 - , although the number of cells was increased for each of these subpopulations in the vaccinated animals, as expected from the enhanced number of total B cells ( Table 2) . We only observed a significant increase in the frequency of IgG + B cells within the CD27 hi CD38 hi plasmablast population of vaccinated responder HIS mice, as compared to PBS-injected animals (13.262.7% and 4.361.8% of CD27 hi CD38 hi B cells, respectively; p = 0.0311). In order to identify, isolate and immortalize the antigen-specific antibody-producing B cells, the aforementioned B cell subsets were transduced immediately after cell sorting with a retroviral vector encoding both human BCL6 and BCL-XL [9, 19] . By ectopically expressing BCL6 and BCL-XL in splenic or peripheral blood memory B cells and culturing them with factors produced by follicular helper T cells (CD40L and IL-21), we generated highly proliferative, BCR positive B cell lines that secrete Igs. Since these cells express BCL6, the differentiation of memory B cells to terminal plasma cells is blocked [28, 29, 30] . Therefore, the resulting B cells can expand extensively in vitro for long periods of time in presence of CD40L and IL-21, and provide a tool to generate antigen-specific human BCR-positive, antibody-secreting B cell lines.",

Based on the analysis of the length of the CDR3 regions, this IgM B cell repertoire is similar to the repertoire of healthy individuals. Thus, HIS mice have no obvious limitations for the generation of human IgM mAbs against any possible antigen. Upon intramuscular vaccinations with either TT or HBsAg, approximately 40% of the HIS mice were able to mount an antigen-specific antibody response. Human IgM-producing B cell lines against both antigens were obtained after isolation of memory B cells followed by ex vivo differentiation into plasmablastlike cells. It is important to highlight that the selection of the antigen-specific human B cell clones relied on relevant bioassays (e.g., ELISA or neutralization test). In contrast to EBV-based approaches, human B cell immortalization using transduction with BCL-6 and BCL-XL preserves the expression of the BCR at the surface and antigen-specific B cell clones can also be selected by binding of labeled antigen to the BCR of immortalized memory B cells (e.g. by using a labeled antigen).",

The reason for this might be that T cell help in this system is suboptimal as indicated by the absence of antigen-specific T cell responses after vaccination (not shown). We also observed that the BCR of the B cell clones had a close to germ-line sequence, suggesting that also the induction of somatic hyper-mutation is sub-optimal in HIS mice. In our hands the great majority of the vaccinated HIS mice showed a defective formation of germinal centers [14, 16] , which further explains the absence of antigenspecific Ig-class switched B cells. So far, humanized mouse models based on the transplantation of human HSC only -i.e. without additional human tissues -share these limitations, and immunization strategies result in the limited generation of class-switched antigen-specific B cell responses [14, 31, 32] . Similar patterns are observed in human HSC-transplanted immunodeficient mice infected with lymphotropic pathogens, such as HIV [33] or EBV [34] , although Dengue virus infection in HIS mice was reported to induce an IgG response in a majority of the responder animals [35] . It is not clear why IgG antigen-specific responses are limited while serum IgG can accumulate efficiently, considering the low frequency of IgG + B cells in HIS mice. It remains to be determined whether this apparent discrepancy might be explained by the conjunction of particularly effective IgG production on a cell basis by IgG + B cells (which might occur in a T cell independent manner, such as in the case of the IgG3 subclass), long-term stability of human IgG in the HIS mouse serum as compared to human IgM, and/or defective survival of IgG + B cells under specific conditions (e.g. after antigen-specific triggering of the BCR).",

            "text": "Although IgM mAbs might already be useful for some specific applications or could be modified by Ig class swapping to obtain IgG mAbs [36] , optimized humanized mouse models with improved B cell function are highly desirable. One reason for the suboptimal interaction of T and B cells may be the poor survival resulting in a high turnover of human T cells (discussed in [10, 37] ), making it very likely that procedures leading to improved accumulation of human T cells may promote B cell responses and isotype switching. It was already shown that human B cells undergoing isotype switching can be obtained in humanized mice, provided that a human environment supporting this process is present, e.g. in SCID mice transplanted with human fetal bones, thymus and lymph nodes [38] . Consistent with this notion, enhanced human peripheral T cell accumulation was observed in NOD/SCID mice transplanted with human bone marrow HSC, fetal liver and fetal thymus tissues (referred to as BLT mice), as compared to conventional humanized mouse systems [39] . Interestingly, BLT mice consistently generated an antigen-specific IgG response after HIV-infection [40] . Although it is yet unknown whether the isotype switch observed in BLT mice is truly T cell dependent, those data might support the idea that improved T cell homeostasis has a positive impact on B cell responses. To obtain humanized mouse models with improved B and T cell homeostasis, alternative strategies not relying on the transplantation of human fetal tissues -which are not necessarily easy to access to, for ethical, legal or practical reasons -will likely be favored in the future. The replacement of mouse genes involved in the hematopoietic system by their human equivalent is a valuable strategy to improve development, maintenance and/or function of several hematopoietic cell subsets in humanized mouse models, as shown with cytokines, such as IL-7 and Il-15 [15, 21, 41, 42] , or MHC molecules (N.D.H and J.P.D., manuscript submitted) [43, 44] . The fact that the human CD47 was shown to be unable to properly interact with the mouse SIRPa indicates that reintroducing a functional phagocyte inhibition mechanism via the CD47/SIRPa signaling axis is another strategy of potential interest [45] .",

            "text": "In conclusion, our results show using two standard vaccine antigens the general applicability of an innovative B cell immortalization method in combination with the HIS mouse model to generate human mAbs. Similarly to methods based on the immortalization of human memory B cells from vaccinated or convalescent individuals [9] , our approach exploits the broad antibody repertoire of human B cells, overcoming the potential limitations of conventional humanized murine mAbs such as laboriousness or impaired biological properties, synthetic antibody libraries that require a known target antigen, and transgenic mice bearing the human Ig locus that have limited B cell repertoires. In addition, our method enables to exploit experimental infection models and immunization regimes that would be unethical or untenable in humans. Considering the upcoming advances in HIS mice models [37] , this new approach will provide a powerful tool to generate human mAbs for either diagnostic or therapeutic purposes. Figure S1 IgG/IgA B cell repertoire in na\u00efve HIS mice. Similarly to Figure 1E , the naive IgG (A) and IgA (B) B cell repertoires of HIS (BALB-Rag/c) mice were evaluated on splenocytes by performing a BCR immunoscope for each V H family. The profiles obtained with control human PBMC are also shown. Found at: doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0013137.s001 (1.61 MB TIF) Figure 3 . Limited dilutions of B cells transduced with BCL-6 and BCL-XL were performed with 6.4 and 0.64 cells/well. After sub-cloning of the positive wells, we generated 15 IgM + anti-HBsAg mAbs, of which 13 are unique (as determined by Ig-V H sequence, see Table S3 ), and 18 IgM + anti-TT mAbs, of which 5 are unique (see Table S4 ). In the case of HBsAg vaccination, the number of screened B cells was ((192*6.4)+(96*0.64))*3 = 3870, which eventually suggests that the frequency of HBsAg-specific B cells is at least 1/350 B cells.
