Here we investigated the expression and function of tAM subsets in oScc, especially in cancer cell proliferation. Biopsy sample from 44 patients with OSCC were examined for the expression of TAM markers and eGf by immunohistochemistry. eGf production of tAM subsets isolated from oScc patients was assessed by flow cytometry. We also examined the effect of conditioned medium from TAM subsets on the proliferation of OSCC cells. CD163 + cells were detected diffusely all over the tumor and connective tissue area, while CD204 + and CD206 + cells were mainly detected in/around the tumors. Flow cytometric analysis found that CD206 + TAMs strongly produced EGF compared with CD163 + and CD204 + tAMs. cell proliferation and invasion of oScc cells cultured with conditioned medium of CD206 + TAMs were strongly enhanced and inhibited by anti-EGFR. The number of CD206 + tAMs positively correlated with worse clinical prognosis. Our results revealed differences in localization and EGF production among these TAM subsets. CD206 + tAMs might play a critical role in the proliferation of oScc via eGf production.",

Stage of the tumor was classified as stated in the TNM classification of the International Union Against Cancer. WHO classification was used to determine the tumor histologic grade. According to the Yamamoto-Kohama clinical classification of OSCC the pattern of tumor invasion was assessed from the H&E-stained specimens as: grade 1 = well-defined borderline; grade 2 = cords, less-marked borderline; grade 3 = groups of cells, no distinct borderline; and grade 4 = diffuse invasion (4C = cord-like type invasion; 4D = widespread type invasion). Patients type and the clinicopathological characteristics of tumor are shown in Table 1. immunohistochemical analysis. First, we deparaffinized the sections in xylene and then hydrated by graded series of ethanol, the detail of the staining procedure were mentioned in our previous study 19 . Following primary antibodies were used to incubate the sections for overnight at 4 \u00b0C. Primary antibodies included rabbit anti-CD3 (Clone SP7; ab16669, Abcam, Tokyo, Japan, 1:200 dilution), rabbit anti-CD20 (Clone EP459Y; ab78237, Abcam, Tokyo, Japan, 1:100 dilution), mouse anti-CD163 (Clone 10D6; Novocastra, Newcastle, UK, 1:400 dilution), mouse anti-CD204 (Clone SRA-C6; TransGenic Inc, Kumamoto, Japan, 1:200 dilution), mouse anti-CD206 (Clone 5C11; Abnova, Taipei, Taiwan, 1:300 dilution), and rabbit anti-EGF (Clone ab9695; Abcam, Tokyo, Japan, 1:30 dilution). Antibody was washed by TBST and as a chromogen 100-400 \u00b5l DAB (Peroxidase Stain DAB Kit, nacalai tesque, Kyoto, Japan) was applied to each section. Finally, Mayer's hemalum solution (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, 1:4 dilution) was used for counterstain and then sections were washed two times for 5 min each in dH 2 O. After dehydration, sections were mounted with coverslips. The numbers of CD3-, CD20-, CD163-, CD204-, CD206-, and EGF-positive cells were counted in 4 mm 2 sections from five independent high-power microscopic fields (400\u00d7, 0.0625 \u03bcm 2 ). Double and triple immunofluorescence analysis. The slides were microwaved in AR6 buffer (Opal-4 Color Manual IHC kit; PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA) and cooled for 30 min. Sections were then incubated in Antibody Diluent/Blocking Buffer (Opal-4 Color Manual IHC kit; PerkinElmer) for 10 min at room temperature and then incubated with primary antibodies (as listed before). Double staining was performed with CD3/ EGF, CD20/EGF, CD163/EGF, CD204/EGF, and CD206/EGF, and triple staining was performed with CD163/ CD204/CD206 for 2.5 h at room temperature.

Samples were rinsed in TBST, microwaved in AR6 buffer and then mounted with VECTASHIELD MOUNTING MEDIUM FOR FLUORESCENCE WITH DAPI (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA). In double staining, CD3, CD20, CD163, CD204, and CD206 were labeled with Opal 520 Fluorosphore (Green) and EGF was labeled with Opal 570 Fluorosphore (Red). In triple staining CD163, CD204, and CD206 were labeled with Opal 520 Fluorosphore (Green), Opal 570 Fluorosphore (Red), Opal 690 Fluorosphore (White), respectively. For taking photomicrographs we used a light microscope with a digital camera (BZ-9000 series; Keyence, Tokyo, Japan). The ratio of EGF-positive cells in immune cells was defined as the ratio of the number of each EGF + immune cells (yellow) to the whole number of each immune cells (yellow and green) in a 4-mm 2 field of view, from five separate areas. flow cytometric analysis. For detection of intracellular EGF, 5 OSCC patients peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) (5 \u00d7 10 5 cells/ml) were collected and cultured in PBS and then stimulated with 40 ng/ml PMA (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; Wako, Tokyo, Japan), 4 \u03bcg/ml ionomycin (Ionomycin Calcium; Wako) and Brefeldin A Solution (BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA, 1:1000 dilution) for 6 h in a moistened chamber at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO 2 supply.",

Macrophages are divided into two functionally distinct subtypes: classically activated (M1) macrophages, which are stimulated by T helper type 1 (Th1) responses, and alternatively activated (M2) macrophages, which stimulated by Th2 responses 7, 8 . M1 macrophages produce pro-inflammatory cytokines and contribute to tumor suppression, whereas M2 macrophages express anti-inflammatory cytokines and have been shown to contribute to tumors by promoting angiogenesis, immunosuppression and activation of tumor cells 25 . Recent studies have described M2-polarized macrophages as TAMs, which highly express markers, including CD163, CD204, and CD206 [26] [27] [28] . CD163 is a member of the scavenger receptor cysteine-rich family class B and is mainly expressed on mature tissue macrophages 29 .

Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated marked differences in the localizations of CD163 + , CD204 + , and CD206 + cells in OSCC tissues. Interestingly, CD206 + cells, from PBMCs of OSCC patients, strongly produced EGF compared with the other TAM subsets. In addition, OSCC cells showed high viability and invasion activity after co-culture with CM of CD206 + cells and a significant decrease in their viability with anti-EGFR antibody. These results suggest that CD206 + TAMs might play an important role in the proliferation and invasion of OSCC via EGF secretion. Goswami et al. 35 found a paracrine loop between breast carcinoma cells and macrophages through EGF and colony stimulating factor 1 production, leading to increased carcinoma cell invasion. While this paracrine loop might be also involved in the invasion activity in OSCC cells, further examinations are needed to clarify the expression of other cytokines secreted by TAM subsets in OSCC.",

The numbers of CD206 + TAMs in OSCCs were positively correlated with several clinicopathologic factors including clinical stage, clinical T classification, mode of invasion, and cervical nodal metastasis. Notably, a high number of CD206 + TAMs was significantly correlated with poor prognosis. Recently, Dong et al. 36 reported that the high presence of CD206 + TAMs in hepatocellular carcinoma markedly correlated with aggressive tumor phenotypes and were associated with poor prognosis. These results were consistent with our results. In contrast, in adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma, both CD204 + and CD206 + TAMs were not associated with clinical outcome 37 .
