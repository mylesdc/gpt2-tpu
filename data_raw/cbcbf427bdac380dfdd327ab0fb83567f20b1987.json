We obtained 5,990,261 high quality reads from intestine and lung tissue of 235 bats, including 2,975,371 assembled sequences. 631,490 reads predicted overlapping sequences for the open reading frame (ORF), which accounts for 2.37% of all the sequences (15,012/631,490). Further, the acquired virus sequences were classified into 25 viral families, including 16 vertebrate viruses, four plant viruses and five insect viruses. All bat samples were screened by specific PCR and phylogenetic analysis. Using these techniques, we discovered many novel bat viruses and some bat viruses closelyrelated to known human/animal pathogens, including coronavirus, norovirus, adenovirus, bocavirus, astrovirus, and circovirus. In summary, this study extended our understanding of bats as the viral reservoirs. Additionally, it also provides a basis for furher studying the transmission of viruses from bats to humans.",

It is important to understand the distribution of pathogens in different animals across different habitats. An understanding of the natural habitat of bat-associated viruses can prevent newly emerging and re-emerging zoonoses. To expand these studies to southest China, Here we combined second-generation sequencing technology with meta-genomics to understand the outbreak of new infectious diseases caused by animal-origin pathogens and explore the unknown viruses from the natural environment, humans, and animals. In this study, we collected 235 bats from six locations in the southeastern coastal area of China from July 2015 to August 2015. Using Illumina platform for sequencing gut and lung tissue from bats, we detected a total of 25 species of the virus family, including norovirus, which was detected first. Also, we sequenced Myotis formosus for the first time from the southeastern coastal area and found that astrovirus. This work extended our understanding the diversity of bats harboring virsues and provide new clues to monitor these transmittable zoonotic viruses.",

            "text": "In this study, we collected samples for metagenomic analysis from southeast coastal areas of China as the region has vast coastline, abundant species, and suitable temperature. Bats are the only flying mammals which venture out every day and some of the species also retain seasonal migratory habits. Additionally, they as a viral reservoirs, by carrying viruses to different regions, including human habitats. A total of six sampling points along the southeast coast were selected, and the sequencing results were obtained for 2.37% tags ratio of assembled viral sequences. However, 95.73% of sequences were related to vertebrate virus which is far higher than previously reported percentages (8.97%-45%) 13, 14, 17 . This may be due to two reasons. First, reason includes the use of intestine and lung tissue from bats as samples for the virus metagenomics analysis; Before the advent of virus metagenomics, detection samples mostly consisted of bat faeces and throat swabs. This caused a large virus interference from the environment, and higher plant and insect virus ratio compared to this study 13, 17, 29 . In addition, due to the updated virus database, we had abundant reference sequences compared to previous studies. Through a complex comparison process, we annotated a total of 25 viruses, including 16 infected vertebrate viruses. This ratio is higher than previous research, but compared to the other studies fewer phage sequences were obtained. However, this result is limited by less sampling and may not reflect the real situation. Six viruses closely related to human pathogenic virus species were selected for PCR verification of all 235 bat specimens. We found that the virus carrying rates and PCR results were consistent with the metagenomic sequencing results. For example, coronavirus sequence was only detected in ZS, CL, and SS group in the metagenomic sequencing results, while 11 positive amplications of coronavirus were obtained in PCR, including six cases in ZS group, four cases in CL group, and two cases in the SS group. During PCR detection of the circovirus, positive amplifications were detected in the ZS group, CL group, and LJ group, while metagenomic sequencing results only in the CL group notes to one tags. These differences may arise when metagenomic samples and PCR samples are amplified in different parts of the intestinal tissue or in bats with low viral load. Overall, the metagenomic sequencing results can provide strong technical support to classify virus spectrum. At the same time, these results also show that different bats carry different viruses in different regions. Rhinolophus pusillus can carry the most variety of viruses, including bocavirus, coronavirus, adenovirus, iflaviruse, porcine circovirus, astrovirus, and norovirus. Bats can carry a variety of viruses at a given time and different kinds of bats could carry different specific viruses. For example, in a collection of 55 Rhinolophus in the CL, norovirus, coronavirus, circovirus, and adenovirus were tested positive in Rhinolophus pusillus, while in Rhinolophus ferrumequinum only coronavirus tested positive. For future studies,it would also be interesting to study how different viruses exist at the same time without causing a pathogenic situation in bats.",

Norovirus sequences were detected in intestinal samples of Rhinolophus pusillus in ZS and CL groups and norovirus carrying rate reached 20% in ZS group. ZS has food rich in insects for bats. It is also easy for norovirus carrying bats to breed through faeces or direct contact with contaminated water or food. Although, there is no direct evidence that bats with norovirus can infect humans, norovirus carried by bat and the infection of human type GIV norovirus homology reached 76.8%, suggesting that bats may serve as norovirus natural host, a potential threat to human existence.",

Furthermore, the PCR primers were designed according to the results of sequencing and the positive fragments were screened by PCR for phylogenetic analysis. We found that these viruses had low similarity with known viruses and suggest they could be categorized as new viruses. Also adenoviruses and circoviruses were also detected in Myotis formosus and Myotis davidii for the first time. However, further experiments are required to test if these viruses could infect humans. In addition, it is necessary to further investigate more samples in different locations to increase our understanding of the global diversity of bat viruses. Sample colletion and Nucleic acid extraction. After completion of collection from each sample site, all the bats were immediately dissected. The viscera of the sample was sub-packed in 1.5 ml EP tubes, labeled and placed in liquid nitrogen tank, shipped back to the laboratory, and put in \u221280 \u00b0C for cryopreservation until further process.",

The proportion of viruses in this study was not the same compared with previous research 13, 14, 17 . The proportion of Parvoviridae accounted for a maximum of 88.16% (13234/15012) in vertebrate virus, which accounted for more than 97.43% (12894/13234) in the Parvoviridae was further annotated as Dependoparvovirus, followed by the 2.67% Coronaviridae (402/15012). The remaining Herpesviridae, Poxviridae, Picornaviridae, Retroviridae, and Flaviviridae existed in each group, indicating that viruses are a common presence in bats aspreviously reported. Although the viruses Adenoviridae, Circoviridae, Asfarviridae, and Caliciviridae annotated to a small number of sequences (<40 tags), but NCBI results show that known viruses exhibit low nucleotide (nt) or amino acid (aa) sequence identities. Insect virus families contributed to 1.66% (249/15012) tags, including the following virus families: Baculoviridae, Iridoviridae, Rhabdoviridae, Polydnaviridae, and Iflaviridae. Among them, Iridoviridae accounted for the most, with 49.8% of insect virus sequences. Iridovirus was originally detected in insect body, after isolating from several other animals, especially aquatic animals.

Of the remaining four bat species, bocavirus was detected in the bat species Myotis davidii for the first time (N = 2), coronavirus was detected in the bat species Rhinolophus ferrumequinum (N = 2), andastrovirus was detected in bat species Myotis formosus (N = 1). However other viruses were absent. and identification of Coronavirus. Coronaviruses are positive-sense,single stranded RNA viruses with the largest RNA genome, they belong to Coronaviridae family and Coronavirinae subfamily, and are divided into Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, and Deltacoronavirus. Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus are present in mammals, while Gammacoronavirus and Deltacoronavirus are mainly present in livestock and poultry 18 . We found 62 Alphacoronavirus tags and 355 Betacoronavirus tags distributed in ZS, CL, and SS groups (Supplementary",

Members of the family Circoviridae are non-enveloped icosahedral particles with a diameter of 18-25 nm and a circular single-stranded DNA, approximately 2 kb in size 24 . In the present study, only group CL contained circovirus (CV) tags (SupplementaryTable S1). Further screening of all the bat samples by PCR of a partial Rep gene sequence (550 bp) of circovirus confirmed that this sequence existed in the guts of Rhinolophus pusillus of groups ZS, CL, and LJ, but not the other groups. Three complete genomes BtCV ZSR42, BtCV LJR22and BtCV CLR6 (accession number: MF276911, MF278661, and MF322629) were amplified by inverse PCR. Sequencing revealed that BtCV ZS62, BtCV LJ22 and BtCV CL6 DNAs were respectively 1,873 nt, 1,806 nt, and 2,051 nt in length and contained two ORFs in opposite strands(Fig. 6A). Phylogenetic analysis was based on complete sequence(Fig. 6B)and multiple alignments showed Bt CV ZSR42 shared47.1% and 51.8% identity with Bt CV CLR6 and Bt CV LJR22, indicating that they were different isolates. Bt CV ZSR42 shared the highest circovirus identities to Porcine circovirus 2 (PCV 2)(37%) and Porcine circovirus 1(PCV1)(36.9%). Thus, Bt CV CLR6, BtCV LJR22 and Finch circovirus should be clustered into the genus Circovirus. and identification of Bocavirus. Bocavirus was first discovered in animals in the early 1960s, and subsequently it was found in cows, dogs, cats, and gorilla[25][26][27] . In this study, a total 45 tags were related to genus Bocavirus. Further screening of all the bat samples by performing PCR of gene sequence(550 bp) of partial capsid proteins(VP) in bocavirus confirmed the existence of this sequence in guts of Myotis myotis of the group DS but none of the other groups. The two positive samples were named Bt BOV DSM9 and Bt BOV DSM10. Nearly whole sequence of Bt BOV DSM10 (about 3,921nt, accession number: MF278662) were amplified by Genome Walking including three major ORFs (partial NS, VP, and NP gene). Phylogenetic analysis based on partial VP nucleotides and multiple alignments(Fig. 7)showed that the Bt BOV DSM10 shared 86% identity with Bt BOV DSM9, and Bt BOV DSM10 shared 74% identity with BtRf-Bov. The homology of Bt BOV DSM9 and Bt BOV DSM10 to Human bocavirus ranged from 46% to 47%, and the homology to Porcine bocavirus was between 58% and 62%. According to The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) criterion, bocavirus with 85% nt identity in its NS gene can be defined as a new species, and Bt BOV DSR9 and Bt BOV DSR10 can form a new species within the genus Bocavirus. and identification of Norovirus. Norovirus (NV) is a representative strain of the genus Norovirus of family Human Calicivirus (HuCV), which is an icosahedron symmetric single-stranded",
