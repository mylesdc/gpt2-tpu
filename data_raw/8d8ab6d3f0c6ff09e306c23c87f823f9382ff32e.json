            "text": "Leptospirosis is a widespread zoonotic infection that primarily affects residents of tropical regions, but causes infections in animals and humans in temperate regions as well. The agents of leptospirosis comprise several members of the genus Leptospira, which also includes non-pathogenic, saprophytic species. Leptospirosis can vary in severity from a mild, nonspecific illness to severe disease that includes multi-organ failure and widespread endothelial damage and hemorrhage. To begin to investigate how pathogenic leptospires affect endothelial cells, we compared the responses of two endothelial cell lines to infection by pathogenic versus non-pathogenic leptospires. Microarray analyses suggested that pathogenic L. interrogans and non-pathogenic L. biflexa triggered changes in expression of genes whose products are involved in cellular architecture and interactions with the matrix, but that the changes were in opposite directions, with infection by L. biflexa primarily predicted to increase or maintain cell layer integrity, while L. interrogans lead primarily to changes predicted to disrupt cell layer integrity. Neither bacterial strain caused necrosis or apoptosis of the cells even after prolonged incubation. The pathogenic L. interrogans, however, did result in significant disruption of endothelial cell layers as assessed by microscopy and the ability of the bacteria to cross the cell layers. This disruption of endothelial layer integrity was abrogated by addition of the endothelial protective drug lisinopril at physiologically relevant concentrations. These results suggest that, through adhesion of L. interrogans to endothelial cells, the bacteria may disrupt endothelial barrier function, promoting dissemination of the bacteria and contributing to severe disease manifestations. In addition, supplementing antibiotic therapy with lisinopril or derivatives with endothelial protective activities may decrease the severity of leptospirosis.

            "text": "Leptospirosis is a geographically widespread zoonosis that has emerged as a significant public health problem in urban slums, particularly in the tropics. The infection is caused by species of spirochetes belonging to the genus Leptospira. There are more than 200 serovars of Leptospira distributed among both pathogenic and non-pathogenic species [1] . The pathogenicity of different strains can vary considerably depending on the host species and age, and on the infecting serovar [2] . The spirochete's mode of entry is through mucous membranes and cuts or abrasions on the skin [1] . Upon entry, the organisms travel through the bloodstream to multiple sites, and may cause liver and kidney damage, meningitis, and a variety of other inflammatory conditions. If the host survives the acute infection, leptospires can persist in the proximal renal tubules for weeks to months, protected from antibodies and causing little to no inflammation. The bacteria are then shed in the urine, and animal urine contamination of water is the primary source of human exposure.",

            "text": "Although little is known about how Leptospira species establish infection in their hosts, adhesion to the host cell surface and extracellular matrix (ECM) by pathogens is often the first critical step in the initiation of infection. Several groups have investigated the adhesion of Leptospira interrogans to endothelial, fibroblast, kidney epithelial, and monocyte-macrophage cell lines cultured in vitro [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . It is likely that pathogenic leptospires can attach to several different types of mammalian receptors to establish the infection. In fact, infectious strains of Leptospira have been shown to adhere to ECM components including collagen type IV, fibronectin and laminin, and also to the plasma protein fibrinogen [4, [10] [11] [12] . Adhesion to several ECM components is mediated at least in part by the LigA and LigB proteins [11] and a group of additional related proteins that were identified through homology to a laminin binding protein [10, 12] .",

            "text": "Several studies have shown that the adhesion of pathogens to mammalian cells will provoke multiple changes in the physiology and/or gene expression of the host. The host-pathogen interactions that define a disease are clearly complex. Microarrays are a powerful tool to explore those host-pathogen interactions by analyzing the transcriptional profiles of host cells or pathogens. Although it has been documented that temperature and osmolarity alter leptospiral gene expression [13, 14] , no previously published research has focused on the mammalian cell responses to the bacteria. To understand how human endothelial cells alter gene expression in response to incubation with different strains of Leptospira, human gene arrays were probed with cDNA derived from the RNA purified from infected cells and uninfected controls. In this study, we discuss how global analysis of gene expression allows us to gain insights into host specific responses to infection with pathogenic Leptospira.",

Leptospirosis can vary in severity from a mild, non-specific illness to severe disease that includes multi-organ failure and widespread endothelial damage and hemorrhage. To investigate how pathogenic leptospires affect endothelial cells, we compared the responses of two endothelial cell lines to infection by pathogenic versus non-pathogenic leptospires. Our analyses suggested that pathogenic L. interrogans and non-pathogenic L. biflexa caused changes in expression of genes whose products are involved in cellular architecture and interactions with the matrix, but that the changes were in opposite directions, with infection by L. biflexa primarily maintaining cell layer integrity, while L. interrogans disrupted cell layers. In fact, L. interrogans caused significant disruption of endothelial cell layers, but this damage could be abrogated by the endothelial protective drug lisinopril. Our results suggest that L. interrogans binds to endothelial cells and disrupts endothelial barrier function, which may promote dissemination of the bacteria and contribute to severe disease manifestations. This disruption may be slowed by endothelial-protective drugs to decrease damage in leptospirosis.",

            "text": "Actin microfilaments are one of the three major components of the cellular cytoskeleton. The cytoskeleton participates in maintaining adhesion to and communicating with the extracellular matrix, cell migration, division, and signaling. b-Actin (ACTB) mRNA was decreased in response to L. interrogans but increased in response to L. biflexa, both as compared to the uninfected control cells (Table 2) . Guanine nucleotide-binding protein alpha-13 subunit (GNA13) mediates the activation of the small GTPase RhoA [19] which when activated controls the assembly of focal adhesions and actin in the formation of stress fibers [20] . Although RhoA was not differentially regulated in response to the bacteria, Rho GTPase activating protein 5 (RhoGAP5) was differentially expressed following the same pattern as GNA13, in which both genes were downregulated in response to the pathogenic leptospires in comparison to the uninfected controls, and upregulated in response to the non-pathogen. The effect of decreased GNA13 may be to decrease stimulation of Rho, while The changes in expression of several additional genes are consistent with changes in cellular architecture as a result of leptospiral infection of these endothelial cells. For example, decreases in the mRNAs for radixin (RDX, a protein that links the actin cytoskeleton to the plasma), caveolins 1 and 2 (CAV1 and CAV2, which couple integrins to the Ras-ERK pathway, titin, the ECM component laminin b1, and integrin subunits a v and b 3 ( Table 2) , were seen in cells infected with L. interrogans Canicola as compared to the uninfected controls. In contrast, the L. biflexa Patoc caused increases in mRNA levels for the same genes in infected cells vs. uninfected controls (Table 2) . Together, all of these gene expression patterns are consistent with the hypothesis that one effect of L. interrogans serovar Canicola is to promote actin remodeling and detachment of the cells from the ECM. A fundamental stage in the pathogenesis of Leptospira infections is the ability of the bacteria to cross mucous membranes and underlying epithelial barriers, as well as endothelial cell barriers, and disseminate to different organs. Although Leptospira species are Ea.hy926 endothelial cells were plated in tissue culture treated glass chamber slides and allowed to reach near confluence (assessed visually). The bacteria were added at MOI = 10 and incubated with the endothelial cells for 1 or 3 hours at 37uC, then were washed and fixed. The slides were stained with phalloidin-FITC, which illuminates F actin, plus anti-Leptospira antibodies followed by TRITC-conjugated secondary antibody. Retraction of the cell bodies in response to L. interrogans Canicola, but not L. biflexa Patoc, is evident, particularly at 3 hr infection. The brighter staining of rounded and retracted cells with FITC-phalloidin may be due to disorganization of cellular architecture without complete depolymerization of the actin, which in the increased depth and decreased area of the cytoplasm would appear more concentrated and therefore brighter. Changes in endothelial cell morphology were most evident, and at earlier time points, in cells with which the L. interrogans bacteria were associated. One higher magnification micrograph of L. interrogans Canicola infected cells is included because the bacteria are small when viewing fields of endothelial cells that provide information on integrity of the monolayer. Micrographs are representative of multiple (.12) independent experiments. L. interrogans Copenhageni caused essentially the same changes in endothelial cell morphology as L. interrogans Canicola (data not shown). doi:10.1371/journal.pntd.0000918.g001 Endothelial Cell Responses to Leptospira www.plosntds.org extracellular bacteria apparently devoid of actin modifying exotoxins [21] [22] [23] , and devoid of the specialized secretion systems utilized by many bacterial pathogens to deliver toxins that disrupt the host cell cytoskeleton (as reviewed in [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] ), pathogenic leptospires might be indirectly targeting the cytoskeleton via cell surface attachment mechanisms that co-opt the host cell signaling to achieve the same result.",

To further explore the possibility that actin rearrangements are triggered by Leptospira infection at the functional level, endothelial cells plated in chamber slides were infected at an MOI of 10 for 1 hour and 3 hours. As shown in Figure 1 , the bacteria were clearly more adherent to the cells than to the extracellular space, and the pathogenic bacteria caused dramatically more significant alterations in cellular morphology and integrity of the cell layer than did the non-pathogenic bacteria. The earliest change noted was a reduction in cortical actin (so the cell edges are less defined) and appearance of gaps in confluent cell layers, followed by loss of stress fibers and rounding of the cells. The images shown in Figure 1 are from cell layers that were just below confluence prior to infection, to allow better visualization of changes in individual cells. For example, while the cortical actin has largely disappeared in cells infected with L. interrogans Canicola by 1 hour postinfection, and stress fibers have disappeared and cell rounding is evident by 3 hours, the cells are largely unaffected at the same time points after infection with L. biflexa Patoc (Figure 1 ).

As shown in Figure 4 , inhibition of proteoglycan synthesis did not fully prevent the damage to the endothelial cell layers caused by L. interrogans. The inhibition of glycosaminoglycan chain attachment does not significantly affect the formation of holes in the cell layer caused by L. interrogans Canicola as assessed visually and by measurement of L. interrogans penetration of the cell layers (data not shown). b-xyloside does cause a reduction of L. interrogans Canicola and Copenhageni attachment to these cells ( [17] and data not shown), but does not abolish bacterial attachment, consistent with the hypothesis that additional nonproteoglycan molecules serve as substrates for L. interrogans attachment to cells. Direct bacterial attachment to the cells does appear to be required for the damage to the endothelial cell layers, as supernatants harvested from infected cell layers (infection times of 1-24 hr) and sterilized by centrifugation and filtration through 0.1 mm filters did not affect endothelial cell layer integrity (data not shown). Therefore, non-proteoglycan cell surface receptors are likely to be those primarily involved in the responses of the endothelial cells to L. interrogans attachment, and efforts to identify both the host cell and the bacterial cell molecules involved in these interactions are underway. As noted in the publication reporting the sequence of two L. biflexa Patoc strains [29] , there are a number of proteins predicted in the published L. interrogans genomes that are not present in the L. biflexa Patoc genome, including some that are postulated to have potential adhesin activities. These include proteins containing leucine-rich repeats, which are involved in many protein-protein interactions [29] . As stated in the publication of the L. biflexa genome, it is intriguing Ea.hy926 cell layers were treated with the proteoglycan synthesis inhibitor b-xyloside, or the control a-galactoside, as described in [17] prior to infection with L. interrogans sv. Copenhageni. After 3 hr, the cell layers were washed and fixed, then stained with phalloidin-FITC. Neither reagent significantly reduced disruption of the cell layers by L. interrogans, as alterations in cell morphology and significant gaps between cells were seen when L. interrogans was present, and trans-endothelial cell layer migration was not significantly affected (data not shown). Consistent with this result, chondroitin sulfates B and A, which do and do not inhibit L. interrogans attachment to mammalian cells, respectively [17] , also had no effect (not shown). doi:10.1371/journal.pntd.0000918.g004",

            "text": "Several drugs currently in use in humans have been reported to have endothelial barrier protective function; all are in use as antihypertensive therapeutics, and some for other therapeutic purposes as well. We therefore tested four different drugs with different mechanisms of action for the ability to prevent the damage to endothelial layers in culture caused by L. interrogans. Lisinopril binds to and competitively inhibits angiotensin 1 binding to angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), which is expressed by endothelial cells, while telmisartan competitively inhibits angio-tensin 2 binding to its receptor AT 1 . Dopamine is an antagonist of VEGF/VEGFR2-mediated cell layer permeability in treatment of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in vitro at 10mM, as well as VEGF-mediated angiogenesis in vivo and proliferation of HUVECs at 1 mM in vitro [34, 35] . Furosemide is an anion transport blocker and is used as a diuretic but has antihypertensive activity as a consequence, and was used as a control not expected to preserve endothelial layer integrity. While telmisartan, furosemide, and dopamine did not protect the endothelial layers from the damage due to L. interrogans Copenhageni infection, lisinopril did at 100 nM, 1 mM and 10 mM ( Figure 5 , representing 3 independent experiments, and data not shown). There are several possible explanations for this, including: 1) lisinopril inhibits L. interrogans attachment to the cells, and 2) that attachment is unaffected but the interaction of the bacteria triggers activation of a signaling cascade or release of a mediator whose action or activation is inhibited by lisinopril. We therefore investigated the possibility that lisinopril might prevent Figure 5 . Effects of specific drugs that protect endothelial barrier function on damage caused by L. interrogans.

There were no significant differences in the absence of cells, and the drugs did not affect bacterial motility or attachment of 35 S-labeled leptospires to the cells (Panel C and data not shown). doi:10.1371/journal.pntd.0000918.g005 Figure 6 .

            "text": "Although it was tempting to speculate that cell-surface-localized ACE could serve as a receptor for L. interrogans, as the enzyme is expressed by endothelial cells and proximal tubule epithelial cells [36] , and is therefore open to possible competition by the lisinopril, this is not consistent with our results to date. However, ACE2 is not inhibitable by lisinopril, but is a receptor for the SARS virus [37] , so there is precedent for ACE proteins serving as receptors for pathogens. It is also possible that the effect of lisinopril in our system is not related to ACE inhibition, but is instead due to additional effects of lisinopril, such as inhibition of isoprenoid synthesis, which is required for the post-translational modification of Rho GTPases, which in turn regulate the actin cytoskeleton [38] . In turn, this may lead to increased NO synthesis, which is protective of endothelial function in the face of a variety of insults. Given that doxycycline also has endothelial protective effects [39] , and that doxycycline is effective in treating leptospirosis [40] , our results may also provide a starting point for investigation into possible combinatorial therapeutic approaches to reduction of endothelial damage and consequent organ damage in human populations during leptospirosis outbreaks. Should this combinatorial approach prove useful in animal models, consideration as a focused approach to the treatment of human leptospirosis is warranted. The 1 mM dose shown in Figure 5 is at the high end of the physiologically relevant dosing range for humans, but administration of an antihypertensive to a patient with clinical manifestations of leptospirosis would be contraindicated, as further depression of blood pressure levels would be potentially lethal. However, in outbreak situations, this agent could potentially help to reduce endothelial damage if administered to affected populations as soon as an outbreak situation is recognized, prior to exposure of the majority of the population to pathogenic Leptospira species. In addition, protective effects of lisinopril were maintained even at a dose of 100 nM, which is well within the range routinely used in humans ( Figure 6 ). It will also be interesting to investigate the possibility that, on a population basis, patients on lisinopril fare better than patients not on this therapy during leptospirosis outbreaks.",

            "text": "Reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, as indicated by our microarray studies and by phalloidin staining of F actin, is essential to the pathogenesis of diverse bacterial infections, and pathogens use many different strategies to provoke changes in the cellular cytoskeleton in order to facilitate invasion of tissues, invasion of host cells, or evasion of phagocytosis (as reviewed in [24, 41, 42] ). A different spirochete, Treponema denticola, produces the protein Msp, which disrupts the actin cytoskeleton in neutrophils and fibro-blasts, preventing phagocytosis of the bacterium and inhibiting the cellular migration required to respond to and repair the damage caused by the pathogen and the host response at the site of infection [43, 44] . These activities are likely to facilitate invasion and colonization of periodontal tissues by T. denticola. Previous work by another laboratory demonstrated that L. interrogans Copenhageni crosses MDCK canine kidney epithelial cell layers in culture more rapidly than does L. biflexa Patoc [45] , but without significant disruption to the cell layers or the actin cytoskeleton. Consistent with these results, in experiments not shown here we also observed no significant damage to NRK (normal rat kidney) 293 (human kidney) or HEp-2 (human laryngeal) epithelial cell layers infected with L. interrogans Canicola or L. interrogans Copenhageni. The calculations of the proportions of bacteria crossing the cell layers differed between the two studies, but our protocol accounted for the replication of the L. interrogans Canicola and Copenhageni in the co-cultures, while the L. biflexa Patoc did not replicate (data not shown). Thus the endothelial cells tested here respond very differently to the bacteria than did the MDCK epithelial cells, and our results are the first to suggest a mechanism: disruption of actin dynamics by bacterial attachment to the cell surface. Thus, while L. interrogans has not been shown to secrete a toxin that modifies actin, the bacteria are able to manipulate the actin cytoskeleton indirectly. Even the pore forming toxin activity reported for Leptospira [46, 47] does not appear to have as large an effect, as the endothelial cells here were viable throughout the experiments. The leptospires may be able to establish disseminated infection in part due to the binding of the bacteria to one or more mammalian cell surface receptors that in turn, regulate the dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton in the mammalian cell. Deciphering the role of, and mechanisms behind, actin rearrangement in response to pathogenic Leptospira will provide insights into the mechanisms that leptospires uses to disseminate to different organs of the host to cause infection and disease, and provides a possible avenue for therapeutic intervention in conjunction with antimicrobial therapy.",
