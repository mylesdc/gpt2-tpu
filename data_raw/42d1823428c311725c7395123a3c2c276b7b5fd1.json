            "text": "Canine parvovirus (CPV-2) is an enteric virus causing morbidity and mortality in dogs worldwide. Since CPV-2 emerged as canine pathogen, the original CPV-2 strain has constantly evolved, and its primary variants (CPV-2a, CPV-2b, and CPV-2c) co-circulate to varying extents in canine populations worldwide. Thus, rapid and accurate laboratory diagnoses of CPV-2 variants are crucial to monitor CPV-2 evolution. Conventional methods for CPV-2 genotyping are laborious, time consuming, and determining the genotype of a CPV-2 variant often requires two or more reaction tubes. The present study developed a probe-based fluorescence melting curve analysis (FMCA) for genotyping six different CPV-2 variants (original CPV-2, CPV-2a, CPV-2b, CPV-2c, and vaccine strains of CPVpf and CPVint) in a single reaction tube using only two TaqMan probes. One of the TaqMan probes (FAM labeled) was designed to perfectly match with the target sequence of CPV-2a, this probe allows a 1-bp mismatched hybridization with the CPV-2b VP2 gene region (A4062G), and a 2-bp mismatched hybridization for CPV-2c (A4062G and T4064A); Another TaqMan probe (HEX labeled) was produced to perfectly match with the target sequence of original CPV-2, this probe enables 1bp mismatched hybridization with the other CPV-2 variants (A3045T). Using the two TaqMan probes, all six CPV-2 variants were readily distinguished by their respective melting temperature values in a single reaction tube. The detection limits of this assay were 1-10 copies per reaction for six CPV-2 construction plasmids and no cross reactions were observed with several other common canine viruses. In this assay, coinfected samples were also directly identified via probe-based FMCA without using a mixing control; only a pure control is required. The clinical evaluation of this assay was demonstrated by analyzing 83 clinical fecal samples, among which 41 (49.39%), 8 (9.63%), and 14 (16.87%) samples were found to be positive for CPV-2a, CPV-2b, and CPV-2c, respectively. The concordance rate between probe-based FMCA and Sanger sequencing was 100%. Thus, the duplex FMCA is effective, rapid, simple, high-throughput, and straightforward for genotyping CPV-2 variants, and is useful to effectively diagnose and monitor CPV-2 epidemiology.",

A new antigenic variant (CPV-2a) completely replaced the originally identified CPV-2 virus between 1979 and 1980. Additional antigenic variants, CPV-2b and CPV-2c, were identified in 1984 (Parrish et al., 1991) and 2000 (Buonavoglia et al., 2001) , respectively. Novel antigenic variants of CPV-2a/2b are still being identified, including new CPV-2a, new CPV-2b (Ohshima et al., 2008) , , and Asp-300(2b) (Ikeda et al., 2000) . Today, the CPV-2 variant originally identified in 1977 can only be found in some vaccine strains. The primary determinants of the CPV-2 genotype are codons 84, 87, 101, 297, 300, 425, and 426 in the VP2 protein (Decaro et al., 2006a,b,c; Yoon et al., 2009; Decaro and Buonavoglia, 2012; Bingga et al., 2014) .",

Furthermore, these live vaccines may replicate in the gastrointestinal tract and are shed along with the feces of vaccinated dogs (Gizzi et al., 2014) , which has been suspected to interfere with diagnostic tests for clinical signs of acute gastroenteritis. As variants of CPV-2 emerged, the CPV-2 vaccine appeared to provide relatively lower and shorter immunity against heterologous CPVs (Decaro et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2010) . This observation can lead to a diagnostic dilemma when pups that have been administered with a CPV-2 vaccine recently present with clinical signs of acute gastroenteritis (Decaro et al., 2007) . Based on these findings, CPV-2 variants need to be identified effectively for diagnosis and epidemiological monitoring.",

However, HI testing needs at least four monoclonal antibodies (Nakamura et al., 2003) to identify CPV-2 variants, and most of the molecular methods need at least two reactions (Decaro et al., 2006a,b,c; An et al., 2012; Naidu et al., 2012; Bingga et al., 2014; Chander et al., 2016; Pavana Jyothi et al., 2016) or/and two technologies Naidu et al., 2012; Bingga et al., 2014; Pavana Jyothi et al., 2016; Meggiolaro et al., 2017) ; Sequence analysis is regarded as the \"gold standard\" for CPV-2 genotyping, it is still time consuming, and labor intensive; In our previous study, PCR coupled with high resolution melting (HRM) curve analysis has been developed to genotype CPV-2 variants (Bingga et al., 2014) . HRM is a simple, rapid, and inexpensive method for CPV-2 genotyping; however, it is not feasible for detecting multiple mutation sites of CPV-2 variants in a single test tube using DNA binding dye. In addition, due to the very small melting temperature difference (0.2 \u2022 C), genotyping CPV-2 variants had to be performed by generating heteroduplexes in HRM analysis (Bingga et al., 2014) . Probe-based fluorescence melting curve analysis (FMCA), however, could overcome those limitations mentioned above.",

The results showed that the developed duplex FMCA assay using dual-labeled, self-quenching probes could identify original CPV-2, CPV-2a, CPV-2b, CPV-2c, and vaccine strains CPVpf and CPVint based on the Tm values and the type of fluorescence of the melting peaks, as shown in Figures 1B,C. For each sample, two Tm values were obtained from the HEX and FAM channels, corresponding to probe P1 and P2, respectively. In the HEX channel, strains CPV-2a, CPV-2b, and CPV-2c were clustered together with Tm values of 50.01 \u00b1 0.26 \u2022 C, 49.91 \u00b1 0.29 \u2022 C, and 49.82 \u00b1 0.19 \u2022 C, respectively; the original CPV-2 and CPVpf strains were clustered together with Tm values of 55.10 \u00b1 0.04 \u2022 C and 55.17 \u00b1 0.25 \u2022 C, respectively. These two clusters were easily differentiated from each other by their Tm values. In this channel, the vaccine strain of CPVint was also readily distinguished from other strains based on the broader melting peak shape ( Figure 1B) . In the FAM channel, strains CPV-2a, CPV-2b, and CPV-2c were separate from each other, with the Tm values of 58.37 \u00b1 0.30 \u2022 C, 51.87 \u00b1 0.31 \u2022 C, and 48.85 \u00b1 0.36 \u2022 C, respectively. The original CPV-2 and CPVpf strain were also separate from each other, with the Tm values of 58.42 \u00b1 0.07 \u2022 C and 52.47 \u00b1 0.33 \u2022 C, respectively. In this channel, although the vaccine strain of CPVpf yielded a Tm value of 52.47 \u00b1 0.33 \u2022 C, which was only 0.60 \u2022 C higher than that of CPV-2b, the Tm difference between them was 5.16 \u2022 C in the HEX channel. Thus, it was obviously feasible to distinguish all of the different CPV strains based on Tm differences and melting curve shapes in the HEX and FAM channels.",

Compared with TaqMan probe-based FMCA, HRM is a simple, rapid, and inexpensive method for SNP testing. In our laboratory, PCR coupled with HRM curve analysis has also been developed to genotype Canine parvovirus type 2 (CPV-2) variants (Bingga et al., 2014) . However, HRM analysis encounters technical difficulties when different CPV-2 genotypes from one sample need to be detected simultaneously in a single reaction tube. This problem can be solved using probe-based FMCA. The advantage of probe-based FMCA is its ability for multiplex detection using probe with specific melting temperatures. When the template DNA fully matches with the probe sequence, the probe will bind at the specific melting temperature. If the template DNA has a mismatch with the probe, the melting temperature will decrease remarkably compared with the matched hybrids. Thus, the Tm difference ( Tm) between the fully matched hybrid and the mismatched hybrids allows researchers to detect SNP variations in a single reaction tube.",

A standard TaqMan probe consist of an 18-25 bp oligonucleotide probe that is labeled with a reporter fluorophore at its 5 end and a quencher fluorophore at its 3 end (Livak et al., 1995) . In solution, the randomly coiled conformation enables fluorescence quenching because the quencher and the fluorophore remain in proximity to each other. Thus, a nonhybridized TaqMan probe is only weakly fluorescent. When the probe hybridizes with its target, strong fluorescence occurs because the quencher and fluorophore are separated by the length of the probe.

This probe allows a 1-bp mismatched hybridization with the CPV-2b VP2 gene region (A4062G), and a 2-bp mismatched hybridization with CPV-2c (A4062G and T4064A). The result of FMCA showed that the melting temperature differences ( Tms) between the fully matched hybrid and the mismatched hybrids were 6.85 \u00b1 0.22 \u2022 C and 9.86 \u00b1 0.29 \u2022 C for 1-and 2bp mismatched hybridization, respectively. Therefore, the Tm values were sufficient to classify the three melting temperatures clearly in a single detection experiment for CPV-2a, CPV-2b, and CPV-2c. However, one limitation was that using only the FAM-labeled probe, the assay could not discriminate CPV-2a from the original CPV-2, as both strains have similar nucleic acids at the target sequence ( Figure 1A) . Thus, a HEX-labeled TaqMan probe was produced to distinguish the original CPV-2 from CPV-2a strains, based on the melting temperature difference. The HEX-labeled TaqMan probe was designed to perfectly match with the target sequence of original CPV-2, in which other strain of CPV-2 variants have a 1-bp mismatch (A3045T). This mismatched hybridization resulted in a Tm of 5.35 \u00b1 0.18 \u2022 C between original CPV-2 and CPV-2a. In addition, two attenuated live vaccine strains (CPVpf and CPVint) were also successfully identified using the two TaqMan probes, because of mutations A4061G and A3038G in the corresponding target sequences (Figure 1) .",

The increased accuracy of FMCA derived from larger Tm differences than those in HRM between the different genotypes of CPV-2. For example, the melting temperature shifts between CPV-2b and CPV-2c were 3.2 \u2022 C using probe-based FMCA, which was significantly higher than the Tm difference (0.2 \u2022 C) between them in the HRM analysis in our previous study. In the HRM analysis, CPV-2b and CPV-2c were discriminated from each other by an additional hybridization step to generate heteroduplexes (Bingga et al., 2014) . Moreover, distinguishing all the CPV genotypes, including two vaccine strains, had to be accomplished using four separate reaction tubes in the HRM assay (Bingga et al., 2014) , while it was done in a single reaction tube with two labeled probes in FMCA.",

In our laboratory, co-infection sample CPV-js11, containing CPV-2a and CPV-2b, was detected by HRM analysis in a previous study (Bingga et al., 2014) . In the present study, two strains from the mixed sample of CPV-js11 were readily distinguished using the probe-based FMCA method. In comparison with the HRM method, the coinfected sample was directly identified by probe-based FMCA without using a mixing control, only a pure control is required (Figure 2) . This is because the mixed sample contains both heteroduplex and homoduplex species after PCR, and the melting curve of the co-infected sample is a combination of their melting profiles (Montgomery et al., 2007) . In the HRM assay, the higher melting temperature peak was a combination of two homoduplex melting profiles, and the lower melting temperature peak was also a combination of two heteroduplex melting profiles. In the probe-based FMCA, however, the higher melting temperature peak was derived from one duplex melting profile, which was perfectly matched with the probe; the lower melting temperature peak was derived from one duplex melting profile, which was mismatched with the probe. Thus, the components of the mixed sample were detected by the labeled probes directly from the four duplexes in the probe-based FMCA assay; however, it is not feasible to identify the ingredients in the co-infected sample using the intercalating dyes-based HRM assay without using a mixing control.",

The sequencing results of the PCR products and cloning experiments both confirmed two different strains of CPVpf and original CPV-2 co-existed in the CPV-2 commercial vaccine Vanguard R Plus 5. Thus, this developed method can also be used as a tool for rapid identification of vaccine purity.",

While, other codons (like 297 and 300) determine the antigenic variants of new CPV-2a/2b and Asp-300(2a/2b) (Decaro et al., 2006c; Decaro and Buonavoglia, 2012) . Due to the classical CPV-2a/2b variants were almost replaced by new CPV-2a/2b and the sporadic cases of Asp-300(2a/2b) were occurred (Supplementary Figure S6) , we have not developed a probebased FMCA to differentiate new CPV-2a/2b variants from other CPV-2a/2b types. However, once the classical CPV-2a/2b or/and Asp-300(2a/2b) are prevalent again, a tricolor probebased FMCA, based on codons 84, 87, 297, 300, 425, and 426, can be developed to solve this problem.",
