            "text": "Many host cellular signaling pathways were activated and exploited by virus infection for more efficient replication. The PI3K/Akt pathway has recently attracted considerable interest due to its role in regulating virus replication. This study demonstrated for the first time that the mammalian reovirus strains Masked Palm Civet/China/2004 (MPC/04) and Bat/China/2003 (B/03) can induce transient activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway early in infection in vitro. When UV-treated, both viruses activated PI3K/Akt signaling, indicating that the virus/receptor interaction was sufficient to activate PI3K/Akt. Reovirus virions can use both clathrin-and caveolae-mediated endocytosis, but only chlorpromazine, a specific inhibitor of clathrin-mediated endocytosis, or siRNA targeting clathrin suppressed Akt phosphorylation. We also identified the upstream molecules of the PI3K pathway. Virus infection induced phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) but not Gab1, and blockage of FAK phosphorylation suppressed Akt phosphorylation. Blockage of PI3K/Akt activation increased virus RNA synthesis and viral yield. We also found that reovirus infection activated the IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) in an interferon-independent manner and up-regulated IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) via the PI3K/Akt/EMSY pathway. Suppression of PI3K/Akt activation impaired the induction of ISRE and down-regulated the expression of ISGs. Overexpression of ISG15 and Viperin inhibited virus replication, and knockdown of either enhanced virus replication. Collectively, these results demonstrate that PI3K/Akt activated by mammalian reovirus serves as a pathway for sensing and then inhibiting virus replication/infection.",

The mammalian orthoreoviruses (MRV) firstly isolated from humans in 1951 commonly infects humans, but is pathogenic only in children (Tyler et al., 2004) . Reovirus infection is widespread and 50-100% of adults show seropositivity (Twigger et al., 2012) . Most infections result in only mild illness or are asymptomatic. Despite its lack of pathogenicity in humans, recent studies have demonstrated that infection of reoviruses spilled over from wild animals can lead to acute and severe clinical disease in humans (Chua et al., 2007 (Chua et al., , 2008 (Chua et al., , 2011 Cheng et al., 2009) .

            "text": "The PI3K/Akt signaling pathway is involved in multi-cellular processes such as glucose metabolism, protein synthesis, and proliferation. In addition, the PI3K/Akt pathway appears to be associated with the host cell immune response to counteract viral infection (Diehl and Schaal, 2013) . Activation of this pathway contributes to the induction of a set of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) through the regulation of the transcriptional repressor EMSY (Ezell and Tsichlis, 2012; . Nevertheless, a large number of viruses rely on activation of the pathway for their replication. For certain viruses, the PI3K/Akt pathway has been shown to be required not only for viral cell entry but also for subsequent intracellular trafficking and viral replication (Cooray, 2004) . Infection with mature vaccinia virus triggers PI3K/Akt signaling, and blocking P13K activation can reduce viral entry in an \u03b21-integrin-dependent manner, suggesting that \u03b21 integrin-mediated PI3K/Akt activation is induced by vaccinia virus (Izmailyan et al., 2012) . Inhibition of PI3K signaling decreases HIV infection after viral entry and reverse transcription but prior to HIV gene expression (Francois and Klotman, 2003) . Activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway plays an important role in regulating vesicular trafficking and cellular entry of the Zaire Ebola virus (Saeed et al., 2008) . The internalization of adenovirus relies on the PI3K-mediated organization of the actin cytoskeleton (Li et al., 1998) . Parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5) and avian leukosis virus (ALV) utilize the PI3K/Akt pathway to enhance synthesis of viral RNAs (Sun et al., 2008; Feng et al., 2011) . Activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway by the influenza virus regulates an early step during viral entry, which impairs dimerization of IRF-3 and reduces IRF-3-dependent promoter activity, thus causing the loss or reduction of host antiviral activity (Ehrhardt et al., 2006) .",

Here, we report our investigation into the role of PI3K/Akt during reovirus infection in vitro. Our results showed that Akt was phosphorylated early during infection with two different reovirus strains in a PI3K-dependent manner. Reovirus virions can use both clathrin-and caveolaemediated endocytosis, but only the blockage of clathrin-mediated endocytosis suppressed Akt phosphorylation. We also found that activation of PI3K/Akt depended on the focal adhesion kinase (FAK) phosphorylation and not on the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) pathway. Inhibition of PI3K activation enhanced reovirus replication by repressing ISG expression, and ISG15 and Viperin played important roles in inhibiting reovirus replication.",

In contrast to mocktreated cells, infection with both viruses resulted in a rapid increase in Akt phosphorylation within 5-15 min post-infection (p.i.), a subsequent decline by 30 min p.i. and a return to background levels by 6 h p.i. (Figure 2A ). Akt phosphorylation in MPC/04-infected cells began after approximately 5 min, which was faster than the time required (approximately 15 min) in B/03infected cells (Figure 2A) . Moreover, Akt phosphorylation in MPC/04-infected cells at each time point reached higher levels than in B/03-infected cells ( Figure 2B) . Similar results were obtained in 293T cells ( Figure 2C ) and Vero cells ( Figure 2D ). To eliminate any secreted factors that could possibly have triggered production of phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt), viral stocks were filtered and pelleted by centrifugation, and they were then resuspended and inoculated into cells. As shown in Figure 2E , both viral filtrate and pellet from viral stocks triggered p-Akt at 30 min p.i. In contrast, no signal was detected in cellular extraction from L929 cells inoculated with supernatant after centrifugation. To demonstrate further that Akt phosphorylation depended on viral infection, both viruses were exposed to shortwave (254 nm) UV light treatment, and virus inactivation was verified by plaque assay. When inactivated viruses were inoculated into A549 cells, phosphorylation of Akt was still detected (Figure 2F) .",

PP2, a selective Src-kinase family inhibitor that blocks integrininduced FAK phosphorylation (Xia et al., 2004) , abolished the phosphorylation of tyrosine 397 of FAK and serine 473 of Akt with both B/03 and MPC/04 infection (Figures 5B,C) . In contrast, PP3, an inactive analog of PP2, had no effect on FAK or Akt phosphorylation (Figures 5B,C) . To eliminate the potential non-specificity issue caused by pharmacological inhibitors, we knocked down the expression of FAK by siRNA and found that p-Akt levels were reduced (Figures 5D,E) . Furthermore, when cells were transfected with the dominant negative FAK (FAD-DN) plasmid, phosphorylation of FAK and Akt was blocked in response to infection of both viruses (Figures 5F,G) . These results suggested that the activation of PI3K/Akt signaling was mediated by FAK during B/03 or MPC/04 infection.",

            "text": "To explore the mechanism of PI3K/Akt regulation of reovirus replication, we analyzed the role of apoptosis and interferon in reovirus replication. Akt promotes cell survival by inhibiting apoptosis via phosphorylating and inactivating multiple targets, including Bad (7), forkhead transcription factors (8), c-Raf (9) and caspase-9 (Cardone et al., 1998; Bonni et al., 1999; Zimmermann and Moelling, 1999) . Suppression of Akt activation should promote cell death and may increase the release of virus particles. Treatment with TRAIL did not affect reovirus replication in A549 cells (data not shown). The levels of interferon production in infected cells were analyzed. MPC/04 infection did not significantly increase the production of IFN-\u03b2 ( Figure 7A) . B/03 infection increased the production of IFN\u03b2 only at 6 h p.i. (Figure 7A ), but this increase did not occur at the other time points (Figure 7A) . However, activation of the IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) was detected during infection of both viruses (Figure 7B ). To rule out the effect of endogenous interferons, activation of the ISRE was examined in A549 cells treated with anti-type I and III receptors antibodies before reovirus infection. Both viruses triggered the ISRE (Figure 7C) , and downregulation of Akt by RNAi nearly abolished activation of the ISRE (Figure 7C) . The plaque assays in Vero cells revealed that knockdown of Akt formed larger plaques than mock-transfected cells (Figure 7D) , suggesting that suppression of Akt increases the cytopathic effect of both reoviruses. These results demonstrated that reovirus infection-mediated induction of ISRE was independent of IFN production.",

In addition, adenovirus binding of \u03b1v integrins induces activation of PI3K, which is required for adenovirus endocytosis (Li et al., 1998) . Because of their wide distribution, integrins are common receptors of diverse viral pathogens (Izmailyan et al., 2012) . Reovirus infection is initiated by interactions between the attachment protein \u03c31 and JAM-A. Blockage of \u03b2-integrin by a specific antibody inhibits reovirus infection in HeLa cells, and expression of the \u03b21-integrin and JAM-A in non-permissive chicken embryo fibroblasts confers susceptibility to reovirus infection (Maginnis et al., 2006) . These results suggest that \u03b21integrin can affect reovirus infection. PI3K/Akt can be activated by both integrin-and RTK-mediated endocytosis pathways (Izmailyan et al., 2012; Goh and Sorkin, 2013) . Activation of both pathways can lead to clathrin-mediated endocytosis. In this study, we found that the activation of PI3K/Akt depended on the upstream molecule FAK and clathrin-mediated endocytosis during reovirus infection. Further investigation is required to understand whether reovirus binds to \u03b21-integrin and lead to the phosphorylation of FAK and activation of PI3K/Akt.",

            "text": "The precise molecular mechanism(s) for regulating viral replication by PI3K/Akt are not yet fully elucidated. Interferonstimulated transcription is thought to occur mainly through the action of the JAK/STAT pathway. Recent findings have demonstrated that activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway contributes to the induction of a set of ISGs through regulating the EMSY transcriptional repressor (Ezell and Tsichlis, 2012) . In this study, we found that ISRE was activated in an interferon-independent, PI3K/Akt-dependent manner. In addition, the phosphorylation of EMSY was induced via PI3K/Akt after infection, and EMSY may regulate the induction of ISRE and reovirus replication. Further, reovirus infection up-regulated the transcription of ISGs, namely IFITM1, ISG15 and Viperin, and blockage of the PI3K/Akt pathway in reovirus infection inhibited the expression of IFITM1, ISG15 and Viperin. Overexpression of ISG15 and Viperin decreased reovirus replication, and knockdown of either enhanced reovirus replication. Although interferons are potent antiviral factors, many viruses, in turn, have evolved multiple strategies to counteract the IFN system (Didcock et al., 1999; Wang et al., 2000 Wang et al., , 2010 Wang et al., , 2011 Fensterl et al., 2005; de Los Santos et al., 2006) . We found that reovirus infection did not induce a high production of IFN-\u03b2, which may inhibit antiviral effects mediated by the IFN-\u03b2 response. As a result of reovirus infection, activated PI3K/Akt promoted the induction of ISRE and increased the expression of ISGs, which can function as a compensatory pathway in interferon signaling to inhibit reovirus replication. Zhang et al. (2015) reported that PI3K/Akt/p53 signaling pathway was activated upon reovirus strain MPC/04 infection and the activation suppressed the viral replication. In this study, activated PI3K/Akt pathway suppresses reovirus replication through EMSY phosphorylation and ISG induction. Both studies found that PI3K/Akt was involved in reovirus infectin, but provided different pathways. EMSY and p53 are known to involving DNA damage/repair pathways (Cousineau and Belmaaza, 2011) , and any cross-talk between two results may exist. However, we found that overexpression of p53 promoted reovirus replication, but did not affect the expression of ISGs (data not shown). So, both may affect reovirus replication via different pathways.",

This new finding will not only help us to better understand the role of the PI3K/Akt pathway in the general virus-host interactions, but it will also be important for future investigations of the mechanisms of reovirushost specificity and pathogenesis as well as for the development of novel prevention and control strategies for reovirus infection in human and animals.",

After a 1 h incubation, the monolayers were covered with 2 ml of 1% Bacto Agar and 2 \u00d7 MEM containing 10 \u00b5g/ml TLCK-treated \u03b1-CHT. Plates were photographed 4 days later for plaque counting. (E) Analysis of phosphorylated EMSY in MPC/04-and B/03-infected cells with and without LY294002 (50 \u00b5M) treatment at 30 min post-infection. (F) A549 cells were transfected with empty plasmid or a plasmid expressing EMSY, EMSY-targeting shRNA or control (shCtl). 24 h after transfection, the cells were infected with MPC/04 and B/03 at a MOI of 5, and viral titers of cell supernatants were determined 24 h after infection. (G) 12 h after A549 cells were cotransfected with pISRE-TA-Luc and RLTK, the cells pretreated with or without LY294002 (50 \u00b5M) were infected with MPC/04 and B/03 at a MOI of 5 or mock infected at 12 h post-transfection. SeV infection was included as a positive control. Relative luciferase activities were determined at 12 h p.i. using a luciferase assay kit. (H) A549 cells were cotransfected with pISRE-TA-Luc, RLTK and shAkt or shCtrl (negative control). 12 h after transfection, the cells were infected with MPC/04 and B/03 at a MOI of 5 or mock infected at 12 h post-transfection. SeV infection was included as a positive control. Relative luciferase activities were determined at 12 h p.i. using a luciferase assay kit. (I-K) Analysis of mRNA levels of IFITM1, ISG15 and Viperin in MPC/04-and B/03-infected cells with or without pre-treatment with LY294002 (50 \u00b5M) (I) or with transfection with shAkt or shCtrl (negative control) (J) or with transfection with shEMSY or shCtrl (negative control) (K) by qPCR. (L-N) 24 h after transfection with plasmids expressing IFITM1, ISG15, Viperin (L), shCtl, ISG15-targeting shRNA (sh-ISG15) or Viperin-targeting shRNA (sh-Viperin) (M,N), cells were infected with MPC/04 and B/03 at a MOI of 5, and the relative RNA levels of viral S4 gene (M) and viral titers of cell supernatants (L,N) were determined 24 h after infection. Data represent the results of three independent experiments. *p < 0.05 and **p < 0.001. Error bars indicate SD.",
