            "text": "Outbreaks of zoonotic diseases in humans and livestock are not uncommon, and an important component in containment of such emerging viral diseases is rapid and reliable diagnostics. Such methods are often PCR-based and hence require the availability of sequence data from the pathogen. Rattus norvegicus (R. norvegicus) is a known reservoir for important zoonotic pathogens. Transmission may be direct via contact with the animal, for example, through exposure to its faecal matter, or indirectly mediated by arthropod vectors. Here we investigated the viral content in rat faecal matter (n = 29) collected from two continents by analyzing 2.2 billion next-generation sequencing reads derived from both DNA and RNA. Among other virus families, we found sequences from members of the Picornaviridae to be abundant in the microbiome of all the samples. Here we describe the diversity of the picornavirus-like contigs including near-full-length genomes closely related to the Boone cardiovirus and Theiler's encephalomyelitis virus. From this study, we conclude that picornaviruses within R. norvegicus are more diverse than previously recognized. The virome of R. norvegicus should be investigated further to assess the full potential for zoonotic virus transmission.",

            "text": "Rodents constitute a diverse taxonomic group rich in species. Globally, rodents are considered the natural reservoir of a large proportion of known zoonoses. 1, 2 The ubiquitous Rattus norvegicus (R. norvegicus) thrives in close proximity to humans in most urban or rural settings and have notoriously been associated with zoonotic disease transmission of mainly bacterial pathogens (for example, Y. pestis, rat bite fever and leptopspirosis). 2 Zoonotic transmission may be direct through contact with the carrier animal or its faeces or indirectly mediated by arthropod vectors (for example, ticks or fleas). Serological and epidemiological evidence shows that rodents are among the animal reservoirs for important human viruses including hanta virus, arenavirus and cowpox virus. 3 Furthermore, there are strong indications of encephalomyocarditis virus transmission from rodents to domestic swine. 4, 5 Zoonotic transmissions of emerging viruses are extremely difficult to predict and control. One important factor in containment of outbreaks of viral diseases is efficient PCR-based diagnostics, as in the case of the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 6, 7 and viral haemorrhagic fevers where early differential diagnostics are important to limit secondary transmission. 8 However, PCR diagnostics requires knowledge about the sequence of the pathogen genome and its variation. Therefore, it remains important to explore the viromes of animal species that potentially host zoonotic viruses.",

For each sample, AdapterRemoval (v1.1) 22 was used to trim low-quality bases, to remove adaptor sequences from paired-end reads and to merge paired-end reads overlapping with more than 11 nt. Reads were assembled into larger contigs using Ray Meta (v2.2.0) 23 with default settings. The contigs are available in NCBI Bioprojects (PRJNA323583). The contigs were mapped using PROmer (v3.07) from the MUMmer package 24 to several databases from European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) consisting of archaea, archaeal viruses, bacteria, bacteriophages and viruses. Furthermore, fungi and protist genomes from the National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) were used for reference. The mapped data were filtered and tiled using delta-filter and delta-tiling from MUMmer, respectively. The contigs were grouped based on how they mapped to the reference. For each group, the mean contig length, mean identity to reference and total coverage of reference were summarized (Supplementary Table S1 ). The output from PROmer with option show-tiling was used to find all hits from a contig to establish a common taxonomic rank within a group. For instance, if one contig in the group mapped to multiple references, the ranking for the group would be the highest common rank, for example, the kingdom, given by NCBI, as summarized (Supplementary Table S1 ).",

Multiple structural alignments of internal ribosome entry site (IRES) regions of novel viral contigs and Boone cardiovirus (JQ864242.1) were performed using locARNA-p (v1.7.16). 27 Secondary structure of the consensus sequence was predicted using partition function and minimum free energy options for RNAalifold (no lonely pairs, no closing G-U pairs). 28 The reads were mapped to the contigs using Bowtie2 (v2.1.0). 29 This mapping was used to assess the quality of two Boone cardiovirus-like contigs using samtools (v1.2). 30 The number of unique reads was calculated using MarkDuplicates from the Picard command-line tools (http://picard.sourceforge.net, v1.130) using the default settings. These unique reads and the contigs were mapped to the Virus Pathogen Database and Analysis Resource (VIPR) database 31 using Bowtie2 (v2.1.0). 29 Phylogenetic analysis All contigs of 45000 nt in length resembling cardioviruses were extracted and getorf was applied from the Emboss software suite (v6.6.0) 32 to extract all the open reading frames (ORFs) coding for proteins longer than 100 amino-acid residues. We searched the translated ORFs against the NCBI np database with BLAST 33 and found four long proteins (ranging from 1818 to 2326 amino-acid residues in length) with significant hits to polyprotein sequences from the Picornaviridae family. As previous studies have used the polyprotein sequences to identify novel members of the Picornaviridae family, [34] [35] [36] we selected these four sequences for phylogenetic analysis of the assemblies. In order to infer the evolutionary relationship between our sequences and the members of the Picornaviridae family, we searched for homologous polyprotein sequences in the NCBI nr database. Three iterations of PSI-BLAST 37,38 were compared against the NCBI nr database using the four sequences as the seed sequences, resulting in 999 hits to Picornaviridae sequences, of which 407 were considered near full-length (more than 2000 amino-acid residues long). We aligned the four new sequences and 407 near full-length sequences obtained from the BLAST search using PASTA (v1.1.0), 39 a new alignment method that can accurately align evolutionarily divergent sequences. We estimated a maximum-likelihood (ML) tree on the alignment under the LFG+gamma substitution model using RAxML (v8.0.19) 40 (model selection performed using helper scripts on the RAxML website, downloaded on 25 August 2014). Support was drawn on the tree using 100 bootstrap replicate runs (bootstrap values on major nodes were \u2265 69). The remaining fragmentary contigs were analyzed as follows: hmmbuild from the HMMER software package (version 3.0) [hmmer.org] was used to build a profile Hidden Markov Model (HMM) on the PASTA alignment of the near full-length sequences. Next, hmmsearch was used to find all ORFs from the fragmentary contigs that had a hit to the profile HMM (93 total ORFs hit). We inserted the ORFs into the ML tree using SEPP (SAT\u00e9-enabled phylogenetic placement) (v2), 41 a phylogenetic placement method that can accurately place evolutionarily divergent sequences.",

Nucleotides with low-quality scores were trimmed using seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk) trimfq -q 0.01. Sequences were aligned using NUCmer from the MUMMER package. We concurrently performed another metagenomic experiment by reverse transcription and random amplification using primer K as previously described, 44 with 35 cycles of amplification. These randomly amplified DNA fragments were sequenced on the PGM. All sequences below 50 nt length were discarded and the rest were trimmed of 20 nt from each end to avoid any primer contamination. Next, reads were trimmed and aligned using the same parameters as for the Sanger sequences. Three samples from EM were processed this way.",

We found that the greatest proportion of unique reads were either of unknown origin or mapped to bacterial contigs. The number of unique reads varied between the different sampling locations, with CUH and AE yielding the highest number of unique reads from the RNA and DNA libraries, respectively ( Figures 1A and 1B) . Overall, substantially fewer reads from the RNA libraries could be mapped than from the DNA libraries. Despite this, we found 433 times more reads mapping to contigs resembling viruses of eukaryotes in our RNA library data. Although samples were sequenced to different depths, data sets with fewer reads still exhibited a proportionally larger number of reads mapping to viral contigs, for example, AE ( Figures 1C and 1D ).",

We found a total of five ambiguous nucleotide sites in the consensus sequence created from all the reads. None of these ambiguities disrupted the ORF. Furthermore, indels were found in a low fraction of reads (o6.7%), indicating that the contigs may be considered the best assembly from the reads. Hence the lack of DVETPNG/P motif is likely a biological occurrence. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that many of the identified viral contigs originated from novel cardio-or picornaviruses.

            "text": "We detected picornavirus contigs in RNA libraries from all samples. In ten cases across geographical locations including several urban and rural habitats within Denmark along with Asian metropolises, contigs showed high sequence similarity to Boone cardiovirus. The Picornaviridae are a diverse family of ssRNA viruses, which includes numerous human and animal pathogens 56 that are often shed in faeces. 17, 57, 58 Among the cardioviruses, Theiler's-like virus of rats and Theiler's encephalomyelitis virus are known to cause demyelination in mice, a condition resembling multiple sclerosis, which, among other symptoms, can lead to paralysis. 59 The cardioviruses are also associated with respiratory illnesses, severe infections of the myocardium and brain, and sudden infant death syndrome in humans. [60] [61] [62] The sequence similarity to other known rat (and rodent) picornaviruses and the proportions of identified reads combined, suggest that the identified sequences likely derive from viral species infecting the carrier animal. This suggests a wider presence of cardiovirus species in rats than has previously been recognized. In this regard it is noteworthy that the abundance of picornavirus sequences was relatively high in all samples, and that novel picornavirus species were not restricted to single locations. We found one contig that in SEPP analysis cluster with the clinically relevant rhino, polio and enterovirus B. Although interesting, the sequence was too short (108 bp) to support further sequence analysis. It is also interesting to note that the Boone cardiovirus together with the new rat cardioviruses identified here lack the DVETNPG/P motif at the junction of the 2A and 2B proteins. This motif is present in all the previously identified cardioviruses 63 and is also present within multiple other genera within the picornavirus family (for example, aphthoviruses, teschoviruses, erboviruses) although not all (for example, enteroviruses, hepatoviruses). Thus, it appears that members of the cardiovirus genus can be sub-divided into those that have this motif (to separate the capsid protein precursor from the non-structural proteins) and those that do not. The presence of human pathogens like the Saffold virus could be indicative of zoonotic potential, but further studies are required to investigate this. The data support that rats, among other rodents, are an important vector to consider for transmission of pathogens to human and livestock. Besides picornaviruses, we identified reads from common gastric virus groups. Expectedly among these, Astroviridae and Adenoviridae (including enteric adenoviruses) sequences were abundant ( Figure 3) . However, considering their environmental stability, it was somewhat surprising that reads mapping to calicivirus were found in relatively small proportions and that rotavirus (reoviridae) was not detected. In our study, the possible bias that may be generated by bacterial or fungal growth during post-sampling storage that would reduce the proportion of viral reads, hence providing a conservative estimate of the viral proportion. We cannot exclude that taxon-specific degradation of virions post sampling may have biased the results. The low virome abundance and diversity in the sample from Hong Kong (Figures 1 and 3 ) may indicate suboptimal sample preservation and degradation of viral RNA.",
