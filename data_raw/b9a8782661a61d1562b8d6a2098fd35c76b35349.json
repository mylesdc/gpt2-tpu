Although broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) against the HIV-1 were observed in patients, elicitation of such bnAbs remains a major challenge when compared to other viral targets. We previously hypothesized that HIV-1 could have evolved a strategy to evade the immune system due to absent or very weak binding of germline antibodies to the conserved epitopes that may not be sufficient to initiate and/or maintain an effective immune response. To further explore our hypothesis, we used the 454 sequence analysis of a large na\u00efve library of human IgM antibodies which had been used for selecting antibodies against SARS CoV receptor-binding domain (RBD), and soluble G proteins (sG) of henipaviruses. We found that the human IgM repertoires from the 454 sequencing have diverse germline usages, recombination patterns, junction diversity, and a lower extent of somatic mutation. In this study, we identified antibody maturation intermediates that are related to bnAbs against the HIV-1 and other viruses as observed in normal individuals, and compared their genetic diversity and somatic mutation level along with available structural and functional data. Further computational analysis will provide framework for understanding the underlying genetic and molecular determinants related to maturation pathways of antiviral bnAbs that could be useful for applying novel approaches to the design of effective vaccine immunogens and antibody-based therapeutics.",

Among the different factors thwarting the induction of bnAbs, we previously found that all known HIV-1 bnAbs are highly divergent from germline antibodies; germline antibodies of bnAbs could not bind to the epitopes of respective mature antibodies, which led to a hypothesis that HIV-1 may have evolved to use the \"holes\" (absence of or weak binding to germline-lineaged bnAbs) in the human germline B cell receptor repertoire (Xiao et al., 2009) . Consistent with our earlier hypothesis, we did not find any specific binders against the HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins (Envs) but only identified binders against the SARS CoV receptorbinding domain (RBD), and soluble Hendra virus G protein (sG) when combinatorial phage display libraries mimicking human antibody repertoire constructing from human IgM libraries had been used for panning experiments . These findings had indicated that the major problem could be related to a high level of somatic mutations required for bnAbs to accurately target the conserved structures on the HIV-1 Envs.",

This study helped to identify germline predecessors of bnAbs observed in normal individuals, and find maturation pathways of antiviral bnAbs. Indeed, most of the known HIV-1 bnAbs are highly divergent from their closest respective germlines as well as their intermediates as they undergo somatic mutations required for their neutralization function. The results corroborate that the HIV-1 may use a strategy to eliminate strong binding of germline antibodies due to the absence of closer anti-HIV antibody intermediates as an escape mechanism from adaptive immune responses, and finding of closer intermediates of bnAbs from rare individuals might help designing the effective vaccines against the HIV-1 and other viral diseases.

A total of 113,139 sequences were obtained from which 91,528 sequences were found as unique with each had >300 nt in length. The total number of unique amino acid (aa) sequences for each V-gene subgroup in heavy and light chains that were found functionally productive as determined by IMGT/HighV-QUEST (Alamyar et al., 2012) are shown in Figures 1A,B , respectively. The read coverage or gene frequencies observed in the study suggested for biased germline usages and were comparable to the previous studies (Glanville et al., 2009; Prabakaran et al., 2012) but way far less than the theoretical diversity attainable by antibodies attributing to several factors such as library sampling, primer efficiency, and sequencing errors and limitations. Nevertheless, we selected known bnAbs against the viral targets including the HIV-1, SARS CoV, and henipaviruses (Table 1) , and created sequence data sets related to those bnAbs from the 454 analysis as depicted in Figures 1C,D showing the germline usage frequencies of IGHV genes in the V H domains, IGKV, and IGLV genes in the V \u03ba and V \u03bb domains, respectively. We found that while all antiviral-related germlines were expressed in human IgM repertoire, some preferential germline usages were noted, for example, HV1-69 gene in IGHV subgroups and KV3-20/LV2-14 genes in IGKV/IGLV subgroups were overrepresented (Figures 1C,D) .",

Phylogenetic analysis of those intermediates revealed two major groups, one group consisting of germline related antibodies and the other having potential intermediates closer to the bnAb b12. We then constructed a phylogenetic sub-tree selecting only the potential intermediates and the V1-3 * 01 germline along with bnAb 12. The tree was rooted at the known germline V1-3 * 01 of bnAb b12, and phylogram showed evolutionary relationship among the different intermediates ( Figure 5A) . One of the intermediates, G3JY1, had the maximum of 72% sequence identity (82% sequence similarity) at aa level to the bnAb b12 ( Figure 5B) . However, the HCDR3 length of that intermediate was found to be 17 aa long, which is 3 aa shorter than that of b12 antibody. To find the closest HCDR3 to that of b12, we scanned 28,925 unique HCDR3 sequences from the entire IgM 454 sequence data. We identified a HCDR3 with the same length (20 aa) and 50% sequence identity to that of b12 (Figure 5C) , which was found to be the most similar to the HCDR3 of b12 but the IGHV gene associated with that HCDR3 was found to be V4-b. We used the HIV-1 gp120-b12 complex structure and mapped the V H somatic mutations, which showed the overlapping of three mutated residues of b12 (N36 from HCDR1, Y59 from HCDR2, and W111.1 from HCDR3) that contribute to the most of binding interactions with the gp120 as previously observed (Zhou et al., 2007) (Figure 5D ).",

We have found intermediates of antiviral related bnAbs, of which most of those against the HIV-1 were highly diverged from their mature forms of bnAbs as compared to other viral targets, SARS CoV, and henipaviruses. Although antibodies are generated through various mechanisms involving VDJ recombination, junctional modification, and hypermutations, the V-genes sculpt the most of the antigencombining sites, CDR1 and CDR2, and support frameworks for the CDR3. We found that antiviral antibodies targeting different Env binding regions of the HIV-1 and other viruses utilized different germline V-genes as the origins (Table 1) . We noted that, among antiviral-related bnAbs, the V1-69 gene usage was dominated in the heavy chains while V3-20 and V2-14 genes of kappa and lambda were used with the highest frequencies in the light chains of human IgM repertoire (Figure 1) . Accordingly, four of the V H genes of bnAbs (4E10, X5, m102, and m396) originated The most similar HCDR3 sequence to that of bnAb b12 from the IgM repertoire was found to originate from V4-b * 01 gene and is shown in the pairwise alignment.

One possible reason for dominance in the usage of those germline genes could be reflecting from the relatively higher frequencies of distributions observed in the expressed IgM repertoire (Figures 1A,B) . The HV3 gene was used in the three of the HIV-1 bnAbs, 2G12, PG9, and CH01. The structural data for most of the bnAbs selected in this analysis were known and the heavy chains of these bnAbs were dominantly used. The increased number of V H mutations and longer HCDR3s are characteristics for the HVI-1 bnAbs when compared to other antiviral bnAbs (Breden et al., 2011) . We analyzed the distribution of HCDR3 lengths and extent of somatic V H mutations in the human IgM repertoire to compare with that of antiviralrelated bnAbs (Figure 2) . The results showed that the longer HCDR3s and low level of somatic V H mutations as compared to the HIV-1 bnAbs existed in the intermediates as found from the 454 sequencing. The somatic diversity through VDJ recombination involving antiviral-related V-genes in the IgM repertoire was found high; the most abundant VDJ combination consisted of the HV1-69 gene with certain D and J genes as depicted in gray and red (Figure 3) , which might be the reason for the preferential usage of that HV1-69 in many other viral diseases (Sui et al., 2009 ).",

All of these four bnAbs were less divergent from their V-germlines and intermediates, when compared to other HIV-1 bnAbs, and formed a single cluster at a mid-point rooted phylogenetic tree (Figure 4) . The gp41 membrane-proximal epitope region (MPER) binding site bnAbs, 2F5, and m66, were moderately divergent from their Vgermlines and intermediates and formed distinct clusters. The V-gene of VRC01 bnAb was the most divergent from its respective germline as well as the closest intermediate, and was placed at a distal branch of HV1 subgroup of bnAbs. For the mid-point rooted phylogenetic analysis, we included the closest intermediates only; however, favored maturation pathways could involve other intermediates too. We created the germline-rooted phylogenetic tree as a use-case for the bnAb b12 ( Figure 5A ) and analyzed the maturation pathway along different V-gene intermediates from HV1-3 gene family. The closest b12 intermediate, designated as G3JY1, had three mutations each at HCDR1 and HCDR2 compared to the germline, and were found similar though not identical to that of mature b12 ( Figure 5B) . Interestingly, we also identified a HCDR3 with the same length (20 aa) and 50% sequence identity to that of b12 (Figure 5C) , which was found to be the most similar to the HCDR3 of b12 but the IGHV gene associated with that HCDR3 was found to be V4-b. This might suggest for the possible maturation mechanism of bnAbs which could be involving the VH replacement (Chen et al., 1995) . These two mutated residues (N36 from HCDR1 and Y59 from HCDR2) from the V-gene and a Trp residue from the D-gene (W111.1 from HCDR3) contributed to the most of binding interactions with the gp120 (Figure 5D ) (Zhou et al., 2007) .",
