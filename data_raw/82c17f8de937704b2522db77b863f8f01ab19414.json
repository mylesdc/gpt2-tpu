There is a paucity of evidence on the epidemiology and clinical manifestations of these four HCoV strains worldwide. We collected 11,399 throat swabs from hospitalized children with acute respiratory tract infection from These were tested for four strains of HCoV infection using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). HCoV-positive patients were then tested for 11 other respiratory pathogens. 4.3% (489/11399) of patients were positive for HCoV, of which 3.0% were positive for OC43 (346/11399), 0.6% for 229E (65/11399), 0.5% for NL63 (60/ 11399), and 0.3% for HKU1 (38/11399). Patients aged 7-12 months had the highest prevalence of HCoV and OC43 when compared with other age groups (p < 0.001). The peak seasons of infection varied depending on the HCoV strain. Patients infected with a single strain of HCoV infection were less likely to present fever (\u2265 38\u00b0C) (p = 0.014) and more likely to present pulmonary rales (p = 0.043) than those co-infected with more than one HCoV strain or other respiratory pathogens. There were also significant differences in the prevalence of certain symptoms, including coughing (p = 0.032), pneumonia (p = 0.026), and abnormal pulmonary rales (p = 0.002) according to the strain of HCoV detected. This retrospective study of the prevalence of four HCoV strains and clinical signs among a large population of pediatric patients in a subtropical region of China provides further insight into the epidemiology and clinical features of HCoV.",

Human coronaviruses (HCoV) OC43, 229E, NL63, and HKU1 are associated with a wide range of upper respiratory tract infections (URTI) and, occasionally, lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI), including pneumonia and bronchiolitis [1] [2] [3] [4] , particularly in children [5] . Although HCoV is widespread globally [6] [7] [8] , the frequency of detection of its four major strains varies significantly both by geography and over time [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . Despite these features of its epidemiology, few long-term studies of the prevalence of HCoV strains and their clinical manifestations have been undertaken [14] [15] [16] . This paucity of evidence has led to an incomplete characterization of the epidemiology and clinical presentation of HCoV across different contexts.",

The most common co-infecting pathogens among HCoV-positive patients were Flu A and RSV (Table 1) . Other recent studies have also reported that RSV, Flu A, and rhinoviruses are the most common pathogens that co-occur with HCoV, and that co-infection may influence the clinical presentation of HCoVpositive patients [4, 5, [19] [20] [21] . Consistent with studies conducted in other contexts, including America and Slovenia [16, 20] , our results showed that the prevalence of HCoV was highest among patients aged 7-12 months (Fig. 1) . This increased vulnerability to respiratory pathogens may be attributable to increased contact with pathogens as infants begin to explore their environment or the waning of maternal antibody levels in infants while the immune system remains underdeveloped [22] [23] [24] .",

Our study found that HCoV prevalence among patients presenting with ARTI in Guangzhou over a 7-year period was highest in the spring and autumn (Fig. 2) . This stands in contrast to other studies which find higher prevalence of HCoV infection in winter and spring [16, 20] . We also found different seasonal prevalence patterns for each of the four HCoV strains, with peak frequencies of 229E, NL63, and OC43 occurring mostly in the spring and autumn in Guangzhou, although OC43 had lower peaks appearing in July 2012 and 2013, however (Fig. [14] . In the United States, 229E, OC43, and HKU1 have been shown to follow different seasonal patterns, with outbreaks of 229E occurring in winter, OC43 in spring and autumn, and HKU1 in summer [20] . Although these seasonal patterns vary between countries and over time, it is apparent across all studies that the prevalence of HCoV among children is lowest in early summer. Patients with HCoV infections presented a wide spectrum of respiratory symptoms. When we compared the clinical presentations of patients with a single HCoV infection to those with co-infections, we found that abnormal pulmonary rales occurred more frequently in the former group, while fever was more prevalent in the latter ( Table 2 ). The results, therefore, indicate that patients infected with more than one respiratory pathogen are more likely to develop fever. Furthermore, abnormal pulmonary rales were more frequently detected among patients infected with OC43 than those infected with other strains. This suggests that HCoV-OC43 is more closely associated with LRTI. Patients with HCoV-OC43 also had the highest prevalence of broncho-pneumonia and asthma, although this was not significantly higher than among patients with other strains (Table 2 ). Our results are consistent with the findings of Lee and Storch [13] that HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-OC43 are associated with LRTI in children. However, Kuypers et al. [5] have found that, although HCoV-OC43 may be associated with asthma and some symptoms related to LRTI, other pathogens such as RSV may be more strongly implicated in cases of severe LRTI [26] . Recent studies have also shown that the most prevalent URTI symptoms among HCoV-positive individuals are fever, cough, sore throat, and headache [1, 19] , and that LRTI including pneumonia and bronchiolitis also occasionally co-occur with HCoV [1, 5] . However, influenza-like symptoms were uncommon in our sample of HCoV-positive patients in this study.",
