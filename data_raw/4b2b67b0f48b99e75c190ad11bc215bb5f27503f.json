Moreover, nationally, about 15% of patients default on the fi rst-line six-month treatment, while almost a third of patients default on secondline treatment [21] . This highlights the urgent need for the health system (which includes health-care workers) to reinforce the DOTS (directly observed treatment, short-course) and DOTS-plus strategy, to revise current adherence counselling and public information strategies, and to actively promote avoidance of a \"victim blaming approach\".

Instead, understandably, these highly infectious individuals fail to receive appropriate therapy and are likely to default on adherence. They mix broadly in society among non-infected individuals, typically utilise public transport, and seek or continue their gainful employment. In so doing, they pose a signifi cant public health risk to their families, co-workers, local community, and the wider public they encounter. Given the cost of trying to manage a MDR-TB or XDR-TB epidemic [28] , the South African government ought to rethink its policy of suspending welfare benefi ts to patients with MDR-TB or XDR-TB for the duration of their hospitalisation. Moreover, it ought to consider extending welfare benefi ts to those infected patients who are gainfully employed as an incentive to draw such patients into the health system so that their adherence to anti-TB medication and resistance profi le can be monitored. Although these measures will undoubtedly have cost implications for the government and may not adequately compensate patients for their lost income, they would at least serve as some form of incentive and encouragement for infected individuals to enter and remain in the health system, although admittedly, their confi nement could conceivably be indefi nite or until they die.

Moreover, because most hospital beds in South Africa are occupied by patients infected with opportunistic infections associated with HIV/AIDS, there is little or no spare capacity to accommodate patients with MDR-TB and XDR-TB. However, given the airborne transmission of TB and the grave threat that MDR-TB and XDR-TB pose immediately to such immunocompromised patients and, if the spread of XDR-TB is not abated, to global health, the government ought to reconsider its prioritisation of hospital resources. It seems that, at minimum, patients with XDR-TB requiring inpatient care should be housed in facilities independent both of patients with MDR-TB and patients who are immunocompromised. The containment of infectious patients with XDR-TB may arguably take precedence over any other patients not infected with highly infectious and deadly airborne diseases, including those with full-blown AIDS.

Ideally, patients suspected of having TB should be isolated in an acute infectious diseases setting while awaiting anti-tuberculosis drug-susceptibility testing, and then triaged for further management based on these results. Current WHO guidelines recognise that this strategy is not feasible in resource-constrained environments. WHO recommends that persons with MDR-TB voluntarily refrain from mixing with the general public and from those susceptible to infection, while they are infectious and in ambulatory care [30] .

No one shall be deprived of his liberty save in the following cases and in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law\". Section 5(1)(e) provides for the situation at hand: \"the lawful detention of persons for the prevention of the spreading of infectious diseases\". The applicant argued that the substantive provisions of Article 5 were not made out in his case, given that the detention did not constitute a proportionate response to the need to prevent the spread of infectious disease. The court held that any such detention must be in compliance with both the principle of proportionality and the requirement that there be an \"absence of arbitrariness\" such that other less severe measures have been considered and found to be insuffi cient to safeguard the individual and the public. This would entail that the deprivation of liberty was necessary in all circumstances [33] .",

The court ruled that the institution of detention for infectious disease must be appropriate to the nature of the disease. Where these conditions are satisfi ed, deprivation of liberty is justifi ed, both on grounds of public policy and in order to provide medical treatment to the affected party. In ruling in favour of the applicant the court found that the compulsory isolation of the applicant by Swedish authorities ought to have been considered only as a last resort in order to prevent him from spreading HIV after less severe measures had been considered and found to be insuffi cient to safeguard the public interest. We believe that the forced isolation and confi nement of individuals infected with XDR-TB and selected MDR-TB may be an appropriate and proportionate response in defi ned situations, given the extreme risk posed by both strains and the fact that less severe measures may be insuffi cient to safeguard public interest. Patients with XDR-TB should also be quarantined separately from those with MDR-TB, as the latter is potentially curable.",

In this regard, section 25 of the Siracusa Principles on the Limitation and Derogation of Provisions in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights holds: \"Public health may be invoked as a ground for limiting certain rights in order to allow a state to take measures dealing with a serious threat to the health of the population or individual members of the population.
