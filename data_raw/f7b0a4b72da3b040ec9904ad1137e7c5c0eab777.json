A viral quasispecies is a group of abundant and diversified genetically related viruses found in a single carrier.

            "text": "Results: In this study, we present a hybrid method for assembling highly polymorphic data combining the partial de novo-reference assembly (PDR) strategy and the BLAST-based assembly pipeline (BBAP). The PDR strategy generates in situ reference sequences through de novo assembly of a randomly extracted partial data set which is subsequently used for the reference assembly for the full data set. BBAP employs a greedy algorithm to assemble polymorphic reads. We used 12 hepatitis B virus quasispecies NGS data sets from a previous study to assess and compare the performance of both PDR and BBAP. Analyses suggest the high polymorphism of a full metagenomic data set leads to fragmentized de novo assembly results, whereas the biased or limited representation of external reference sequences included fewer reads into the assembly with lower assembly accuracy and variation sensitivity. In comparison, the PDR generated in situ reference sequence incorporated more reads into the final PDR assembly of the full metagenomics data set along with greater accuracy and higher variation sensitivity. BBAP assembly results also suggest higher assembly efficiency and accuracy compared to other assembly methods. Additionally, BBAP assembly recovered HBV structural variants that were not observed amongst assembly results of other methods. Together, PDR/BBAP assembly results were significantly better than other compared methods. Conclusions: Both PDR and BBAP independently increased the assembly efficiency and accuracy of highly polymorphic data, and assembly performances were further improved when used together. BBAP also provides nucleotide frequency information. Together, PDR and BBAP provide powerful tools for metagenomic data studies.",

There are several key components for an assembly algorithm, including the capacity to handle massive data sets, the accuracy and efficiency of the assembly, the nature of the data set itself, and the intended use of the assembly results. The former two are dependent of the hardware and algorithms implemented, whereas the latter two influences the optimization strategy and the type of information to be extracted during assembly. For example, metagenomic studies commonly aim to understand the composition and relative abundances of the data set as well as the intra-species or inter-population heterogeneity, therefore the assembly depth and length as well as accuracy are prioritized for such data sets [2] .",

Two main NGS platforms, 454/Roche pyrosequencing [6] and Illumina Genome Analyzer [7] , have been commonly used for recent quasispecies-related studies. Pyrosequencing has longer sequence reads and typically does not require data set assembly [8] [9] [10] , although some studies still performed de novo assembly [11] or reference sequence assembly [12, 13] . Illumina sequencing generates much larger data sets compared to pyrosequencing, but its shorter read length limits the efficiency for de novo assembly [2] . Therefore, Illumina sequenced viral quasispecies data sets are usually assembled using reference sequences as templates [14] [15] [16] [17] while de novo assembly is applicable but not commonly used [18] .",

Sequence assembly using a reference approach is not only subject to bias of the chosen reference sequence, but also assembles less reads and thus less genetic variation information in the assembly [15] . De novo assembly should be able to provide the most complete and accurate genetic information of NGS data, but can be hindered by regions with high levels of diversity. The commonly used de novo assembly algorithms, such as Velvet [19] , SOAPdenovo [20] , CLC Genomics Workbench (CLC, CLC bio, Aarhus, Denmark), and Euler-SR [21] , were not originally intended for the assembly of metagenomics data with high diversity and coverage depth.

PDR generates an in situ reference sequence by de novo assembly of a smaller yet less diverse partial data set followed by the reference assembly of the full data set. Results show that the PDR assembly results are more complete and accurate than direct de novo or reference assembly of highly polymorphic metagenomic data sets. We also present a novel BLAST-based assembly pipeline, BBAP, capable of both de novo and reference assembly specifically designed for assembly of metagenomic data sets. The assembly efficiency and accuracy of both PDR and BBAP were examined using actual NGS data sets as well as in silico generated simulated NGS data sets and compared with the assembly results of other assembly methods.",

For de novo assembly of partial data sets (PD) of each data set, five partial data sets were initially randomly generated and assembled independently. Because the PD assembly results of the partial data sets from each library were highly similar (data not shown), a single partial data set and its assembly results were used for representation of the sample in further analyses. The PD assembly yielded fewer number of contigs and longer average maximum contig lengths, indicating the PD assembly results were not as fragmentized as FD assembly. Furthermore, PD assembly required fewer contigs than the FD assembly to span the full genome to recover the full length HBV genome (Fig. 1a , Additional file 2: Figure S1 ).

Not only did the remaining 376 HRURs all mapped to one of the nine PDR assembled variant contigs, but the SR alignment qualities of those 376 HRURs was less optimal than the 50,211 HRURs, shown by the significantly greater BLAST e-value and lower BLAST alignment score (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, p < 0.001), both supporting the higher alignment accuracy of PDR assembly. Overall, results of SR assembly and PDR assembly were similar in recovering sequence variation, but the latter included more HRURs and RiHRURs with increased accuracy due to the additional mapping options of the shorter HBV variant contigs provided by the de novo assembly of the partial data set, whereas the lower assembly accuracy of the former resulted in low quality alignments and slightly more polymorphic sites.",

            "text": "For a more general assessment and comparison of BBAP performance, in silico NGS data sets were generated from the NCBI HBV complete genome and assembled separately using BBAP FD, Velvet, MetaVelvet, SOAPdenovo, and Genovo. Data set sizes were set to 1,726,462 (55,799X), 172,646 (5,579X), 17,264 (557X), and 1726 (55X) HQRs in combination with error rates of 10 \u22122 , 10 \u22123 , and 10 \u22124 /site. Due to computing time considerations, the maximum simulated data set size of 55,799X was approximately 10% of the D2_1 data set size. Five independent data sets were generated for each parameter combination. BBAP assembly results were highly consistent regardless of the data set parameter values. All but one of the 60 assembly results had both perfect coverage and accuracy; the lone standout assembly result had perfect coverage but a 0.9996 (3214/3215) accuracy (Table 3 and Additional file 1: Table S9 ). The single \"inaccurate\" nucleotide was not an assembly error, but rather a degenerate nucleotide (Y) representing the reference nucleotide (T, 2/3 or 0.67) and the in silico generated erroneous nucleotide (C, 1/3 or 0.33). The corresponding in silico data set was generated with the highest error rate (0.01) and smallest data set size (55X), which is the most likely parameter value combination for erroneous nucleotides to exceed the minimum nucleotide frequency threshold (0.2). Velvet assembly of the in silico data sets produced mixed results (Additional file 1: Table S10 ). Data sets with low error rates and/or small data set sizes were assembled with near perfect coverage and accuracy, whereas both large data sets and high error rates were poorly assembled. As the degree and amount of polymorphism are proportional to the error rate and data set size, respectively, results suggest Velvet is inefficient in assembling highly polymorphic data sets. Unlike the assembly results for D2_1 data sets, MetaVelvet in silico data set assembly results, compared to Velvet results, were improved with higher coverage and less fragmentation (Additional file 1: Table S11 ). MetaVelvet has wider parameter handling range than Velvet, but was still unable to assemble highly polymorphic data sets with high error rates and large data set sizes. Similar to that of Velvet and MetaVelvet, SOAPdenovo could not efficiently assemble data sets of high polymorphism (large data set size and high error rate). In addition, SOAPdenovo also performed poorly when assembling data sets of low polymorphism (low error rate and small data set size). Only data sets of medium sizes and error rates were efficiently assembled by SOAPdenovo (Additional file 1: Table S12 ). Genovo assembly of smaller data set sizes (55X, 557X, and 5,579X), regardless of the error rate, were highly consistent, with only a single nucleotide assembly error among all 45 assembly results (Additional file 1: Table S13 ). The assembly result for the largest data sets (55,799X) were slightly fragmentized across all error rates and on average 4 assembly errors were identified among high error rate (0.01) data sets.",

Current assembly approaches typically assemble the full data set straightforward with either de novo or reference assembly methods, each with their respective advantages and disadvantages. Reference assembly is a much more direct process than de novo assembly which reduces alignment ambiguities and low coverage issues. However, the quality of reference assembly is reliant on the representation level of the reference sequence, as the assembly result will be biased towards the reference sequence and sequence variations not represented by the reference sequence will not be captured. De novo assembly, which is independent of reference sequences, possesses the potential to generate a more complete assembly result including majority consensus sequences and minor variant sequences, but can be hindered by coverage gaps that lack sequencing information and polymorphic regions with high levels of diversity as shown in Tables 1 and 2.",

In turn, the following reference assembly not only assembles more reads due to the accurate representation of the reference sequences, but also has increased assembly accuracy than both straight-up de novo and reference assemblies (Table 1) . More importantly, the improved quality of assembly resulting from this hybrid PDR approach was not limited to BBAP, as better assembly results using partial data sets were also demonstrated by Velvet, MetaVelvet, SOAPdenovo, and Genovo ( Table 2) .",

Velvet, MetaVelvet, and SOAPdenovo all assemble NGS data sets through the construction of de Bruijn graphs and Eulerian paths. De Bruijn graphs contain overlapping sequence information represented by branching nodes and stemming vertices, and is extremely sensitive and results quickly deteriorate even with the slightest amount of polymorphism [21] . The assembly algorithm of Velvet and SOAPdenovo both manipulate the constructed de Bruijn graph with error removal and simplification to generate optimal assembly results, which effectively excludes the essential polymorphism information vital to metagenomics data sets during assembly. In contrast, MetaVelvet decomposes the de Bruijn graphs into individual subgraphs and assembles each subgraphs into separate contigs. On the other hand, BBAP adopts a greedy assembly approach by incorporating and clustering sequence reads through BLAST results, and Genovo implements a Bayesian-based probabilistic model and takes into account the potential presence of multiple genomes in the data set. Therefore, it was reasonably expected for BBAP, MetaVelvet, and Genovo to have better assembly results than Velvet and SOAPdenovo when assembling metagenomics data sets, and this was consistent with our results that support BBAP, MetaVelvet, and Genovo are better equipped to assemble metagenomics data sets than Velvet or SOAPdenovo. We compared the average assembly times for in silico and NGS data sets on our server (E5310 1.6GHz x4 x2, 12GB RAM) between all methods to further assess the performance of both BBAP and PDR. For smaller in silico data sets (data set size \u22665,579X or 17.44 Mb) BBAP assembly time was slightly longer than Velvet, MetaVelvet, and SOAPdenovo, but still within a couple minutes (Additional file 1: Table S14 ). BBAP assembly time for the largest in silico data sets tested (data set size = 55,799X or 174 Mb) were similar to the assembly time by the other methods except Genovo, which required considerably much more assembly time than BBAP or the other methods for all in silico data sets. The average BBAP PDR assembly time (624 s) for the 12 NGS data sets was drastically faster than the average BBAP FD assembly time (14,347 s). Overall, results suggest not only do both BBAP and PDR individually increase assembly efficiency and accuracy compared to their respective counterparts, but the combination of BBAP and PDR together further improves the overall assembly quality of metagenomic data sets.",

Partial data sets of different ratios were assembled and 1% partial data sets generated the most optimal assembly results (Additional file 1: Table S16 and Additional file 3: SD). Assembly results of different BBAP methods were then compared to each other. Fig. 3 Flow chart summary of BBAP. a The pipeline is divided into four major steps: quality control (QC), blast and cluster (BC), alignment and consensus determination (AC), and contig assembly (CA). b BBAP can perform de novo assembly, reference assembly, or partial de novo-reference assembly, which includes the initial de novo assembly of a randomly extracted partial data set followed by the reference assembly of the full data set using the assembly results from the initial assembly as reference sequences Variant contigs were identified by BLAST against the NCBI HBV complete genome sequence (NC_003977), the Sanger reference sequence, and the NCBI nr/nt database. To verify that the identified variants were not artifacts of incorrect assembly by BBAP, sequences of at least 20 bp and spanning the junction regions of the structural variations were searched for in both the RRs and HQRs fasta files.",

In silico data sets were generated by randomly generating 101 bp reads from the reference NCBI HBV complete genome, NC_003977. To mimic observed polymorphism from virus diversity or sequencing error of NGS, different error rates, 10 \u22122 , 10 \u22123 , and 10 \u22124 /site, were applied to the simulated reads. Data set sizes were set to 1,726,462 (55,799X), 172,646 (5,579X), 17,264 (557X), and 1726 (55X) HQRs. Five independent data sets were generated for each parameter combination, error rate and dataset size. Data sets were assembled using BBAP FD assembly, Velvet, MetaVelvet, SOAPdenovo, and Genovo. All in silico data sets, except for data sets of high error rate (0.01) coupled with small data set sizes (55X and 557X), used the same BBAP parameter values for NGS de novo assembly. For the high error rate-low coverage depth data sets, the redundancy threshold was reduced from 5 to 1 to compensate for its low redundancy. For Velvet, MetaVelvet, and SOAPdenovo assembly, the k-mer size was optimally set to 57, 57, and 63, respectively. For Genovo assembly, different numbers of iterations were used for data sets of different coverage depths because of the extreme long run time for larger data sets; the number of iterations for data sets with coverage depths of 55,799X, 5,579X, 557X and 55X was 10, 2000, 10,000, and 10,000, respectively.",
