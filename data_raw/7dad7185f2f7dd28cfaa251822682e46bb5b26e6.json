            "text": "Background: Rodents are natural reservoirs of hantaviruses, which cause two disease types: hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in Eurasia and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in North America. Hantaviruses related human cases have been observed throughout Asia, Europe, Africa, and North America. To date, 23 distinct species of hantaviruses, hosted by reservoir, have been identified. However, the diversity and number of hantaviruses are likely underestimated in China, and hantavirus species that cause disease in many regions, including Yunnan province, are unknown. Results: In August 2012, we collected tissue samples from 189 captured animals, including 15 species belonging to 10 genera, 5 families, and 4 orders in Fugong county, Yunnan province, China. Seven species were positive for hantavirus: Eothenomys eleusis (42/94), Apodemus peninsulae (3/25), Niviventer eha (3/27), Cryptotis montivaga (2/8), Anourosorex squamipes (1/1), Sorex araneus (1/1), and Mustela sibirica (1/2). We characterized one full-length genomic sequence of the virus (named fugong virus, FUGV) from a small oriental vole (Eothenomys eleusis). The full-length sequences of the small, medium, and large segments of FUGV were 1813, 3630, and 6531 nt, respectively. FUGV was most closely related to hantavirus LX309, a previously reported species detected in the red-backed vole in Luxi county, Yunnan province, China. However, the amino acid sequences of nucleocapsid (N), glycoprotein (G), and large protein (L) were highly divergent from those of Hantavirus LX309, with amino acid differences of 11.2, 15.3, and 12.7 %, respectively. In phylogenetic trees, FUGV clustered in the lineage corresponding to hantaviruses carried by rodents in the subfamily Arvicolinae. Conclusions: High prevalence of hantavirus infection in small mammals was found in Fugong county, Yunnan province, China. A novel hantavirus species FUGV was identified from the small oriental vole. This virus is phylogenetic clustering with another hantavirus LX309, but shows highly genomic divergence.",

            "text": "Hantaviruses (genus Hantavirus, family Bunyaviridae) cause two disease types: hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in Eurasia and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) in North America [1] . The hantavirus genome is composed of three segments, designated the large (L), medium (M), and small (S) segments, which encode an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase [2, 3] , a glycoprotein precursor that is cotranslationally processed to produce two envelope glycoproteins (Gn and Gc), and a nucleocapsid (N) protein, respectively [3, 4] . HFRS is a typical rodent-borne disease and a severe public health issue in China [5] . In addition to rodents, hantaviruses have recently been detected in shrews (order Soricomorpha, family Soricidae and Talpidae) [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] and bats (order Chiroptera, family Rhinolophidae, Hipposideridae, Vespertilionidae, and Nycteridae) [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] , but it is not clear whether these hantaviruses lead to human illness. It is believed that only hantaviruses in rodent hosts (order Rodentia, family or subfamily Muridae, Arvicolinae, and Sigmodontinae) cause HFRS and HPS in Asia, Europe, Africa, and North America [17] . To date, 23 distinct hantavirus species are recognized by the ICTV [18] . In China, two main hantaviruses, Hantaan virus (HTNV) carried by the striped field mouse (Apodemus agrarius) and Seoul virus (SEOV) carried by the Norway rat (Rattus norvegicus), cause HFRS [19] . In 2012, we reported a novel hantavirus harbored by the Yunnan red-backed vole (Eothenomys miletus) [20] . In this study, we identified another novel hantavirus in the small oriental vole (Eothenomys eleusis, subfamily Arvicolinae), designated Fugong virus (FUGV) because it was recovered in Fugong county, Yunnan Province, China. The small oriental vole is distributed widely in Hunan, Hubei, Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou, China [21] .",

Either one or two genomic segments for several viruses were unavailable (e.g., the El Moro Canyon virus genome lacked the L region and the Isla Vista virus lacked M and L sequences); accordingly, the phylogenetic trees based on each genomic segment consisted of different numbers or combinations of viral taxa. Despite this, the nt and aa trees presented a consistent branching pattern and topology (Fig. 2) . In the S, M, and L trees, FUGV clustered in the phylogenetic lineage that corresponded to viruses harbored by rodents in the subfamily Arvicolinae. In the M and L trees, FUGV and LX309 formed a distinct clade, both of which have been detected in the genus Eothenomys (Arvicolinae: Cricetidae) [20] .

We found that FUGV and LX309 diverged earlier than Prospect Hill virus, Tula virus, Puumala virus, and others, which was not congruent with their Myodes spp. host evolutionary statuses in the CytB tree. This phenomenon may be explained by differences in the evolutionary rates of hantaviruses in different hosts.

We successfully amplified the nucleotide sequences of the virus obtained from E. eleusis. These results suggested a high cross-reactivity of SEOV and HTNV with other hantaviruses in serological level, but their genomic sequences were highly divergent. We thus suspected that there were other novel hantaviruses that cannot be detected with the degenerate primers used in this study. We also cannot exclude potential RT-PCR sensitivity issues. The three segments of FUGV harbored by E. eleusis were most closely related to Hantavirus LX309 carried by E. miletus. However, the aa sequences of the N, G, and L proteins of FUGV were highly divergent with respect to Hantavirus LX309, with similarities reaching 11.2, 15.3, and 12.7 %, respectively. The new ICTV classification guidelines indicate that a novel Hantavirus species should show at least a 10 % difference in S segment similarity and a 12 % difference in M segment similarity based on complete amino acid sequences [35] . Accordingly, the hantavirus harbored by E. eleusis represents a novel species. Additionally, no reassortment or recombination events were detected among FUGV and other hantaviruses. We propose that this novel species be named Fugong virus (FUGV) based on the location where it was first recovered.",

Recently, more than 100 HFRS cases have been reported in Yunnan province (unpublished data). However, the types of hantaviruses that cause HFRS in Yunnan province are still unknown.

FUGV was most closely related to hantavirus LX309, which is carried by different rodent species within the same genus. Additionally, we detected differences in the evolutionary rates of hantaviruses in different hosts. The Eothenomys genus consists of eight rodent species, but only two have been investigated. Considering the high prevalence and diversity of hantaviruses in the genus, additional investigations should be performed in the future to extend the number of species considered.",
