We have screened 333 natural oriental herbal medicines to search for new antiviral candidates against PEDV. We found that two herbal extracts, KIOM 198 and KIOM 124, contain significant anti-PED viral effect. KIOM 198 and KIOM 124 were identified as Epimedium koreanum Nakai and Lonicera japonica Thunberg, respectively. The further plaque and CPE inhibition assay in vitro showed that KIOM 198 has much stronger antiviral activity than KIOM 124. Additionally, KIOM 198 exhibited a similar extent of antiviral effect against other subtypes of Corona virus such as sm98 and TGE viruses. Cytotoxicity results showed that KIOM 198 is nontoxic on the cells and suggest that it can be delivered safely for therapy. Furthermore, when we orally administered KIOM 198 to piglets and then infected them with PEDV, the piglets did not show any disease symptoms like diarrhea and biopsy results showed clean intestine, whereas control pigs without KIOM 198 treatment exhibited PED-related severe symptoms. These results imply that KIOM 198 contains strong antiviral activity and has a potential to be developed as an antiviral phytomedicine to treat PEDV-related diseases in pigs.",

Next, we investigated the toxicity of KIOM 198 using lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay in Vero cells and MTT assay in mouse primary liver cells. Vero cells were lysed, mixed with 20 fold-diluted herbal extract, and the activity was measured using substrate. Figure 4 represents the cytotoxicity result of 27 antiviral herbal extracts in Vero cells. The extent of cytotoxicity of KIOM 198 is close to nothing, compared to other herbal extracts. And, when we checked the cytotoxicity of KIOM 198 on mouse liver primary cells, in the presence of 1.5 mg/mL, cell viability was more than 90% (Figure 4(b) ). These data suggest KIOM 198 could be a safe and nontoxic drug when it is used for antiviral therapy. 198, the intestine of piglet was free of disease symptom ( Figure 5(b) , right panel) compared to intestine of control pigs, which was thinned and filled with diarrheal material ( Figure 5(b) , left panel). Furthermore, we compared viral replications in the piglets, at 24 h, 48 h postinfection, and on necropsy. As shown in Figure 5 (c), no virus was detected in the feces of piglet dieted with KIOM 198 at 24 h postinfection. From 48 h of postinfection, viral number in the KIOM 198-dieted piglets was increased, but it was still 10-fold lower than control group. Taken together these results, KIOM 198 has strong inhibitory effect on PED viral growth in the pigs.",

Although some inhibitors were screened and tested for antiviral effect on PED virus, new effective antiviral remedy without toxicity should be developed. KIOM 198 exhibited antiviral activity on not only PED virus but other corona virus like sm98 and TGE virus. We examined whether antiviral agents available commercially, such as Deoxynojirimycin, Mizoribine, and Ribavirin, could inhibit PED viral growth. Each compound at concentration of 100 \u03bcg/mL was treated to the Vero cells infected with PED virus and compared their antiviral activity with KIOM 198. These agents except for KIOM 198 did not significantly inhibit PED viral growth in this study (data not shown). These results mean KIOM 198 contains specific, remarkable antiviral activity on PED virus, which is not inhibited by other well-known antiviral drug. Antiviral activity of KIOM 198 was confirmed in vivo disease model. Piglets infected with PED virus expressed disease symptoms like diarrhea, but piglet oral-administered with KIOM 198 had normal feces and no virus was detected in the early time and 10fold lower viruses were found in the feces later.

KIOM 198 Showed Stronger Inhibitory Effect than KIOM 124 on PED Viral Production from 18 h of Postinfection. Next, we evaluated the antiviral activities of KIOM 198 and KIOM 124 using plaque assay. The cells preinfected with virus at an MOI of 0.1 were treated with KIOM 124 or KIOM 198 and incubated for 18 h and 24 h. From the supernatant harvested at each time-point, the viral titer was determined by plaque assay. Figure 2(a) shows when infected with 0.1 MOI of virus, in control cells without KIOM extracts, viral production was steeply increased at 18 h postinfection. The viral replication yield in the cells treated with KIOM 124 was 10 times lower than control. Interestingly, KIOM 198 strongly repressed viral replication at 18 h and 24 h postinfection. Although antiviral effect of KIOM 198 was weaken and viral replication was bounced at 48 h postinfection, it still lowered viral production than control or KIOM 124. Figure 2(b) is the representative plaque assay results. The plaques formation was repressed 10-40 fold by KIOM 124 and 10 4 fold by KIOM 198.
