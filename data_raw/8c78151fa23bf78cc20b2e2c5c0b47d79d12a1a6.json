Different scoring functions focus on diverse aspects of ligand binding, and no single scoring can satisfy the peculiarities of each target system. Therefore, the idea of a consensus score strategy was put forward. Integrating several scoring functions, consensus score re-assesses the docked conformations using a primary scoring function. However, it is not really robust and efficient from the perspective of optimization. Furthermore, to date, the majority of available methods are still based on single objective optimization design.",

Results suggest that MOSFOM can effectively enhance enrichment and performance compared with a single score. For three different kinds of binding sites, MOSFOM displays an excellent ability to differentiate active compounds through energy and shape complementarity. EFMOGA performed particularly well in the top 2% of database for all three cases, whereas MOEA_Nrg and MOEA_Cnt performed better than the corresponding individual scoring functions if the appropriate type of binding site was selected.",

For the computational chemist, an attractive goal is to develop computer programs capable of automatically evaluating large-scale chemical libraries (databases). These computational methods are referred to as virtual screening (VS) [4] . In general, two strategies have been employed in virtual screening: (1), using pharmacophore-based database searching (PBDS) methods to identify potential hits from chemical libraries, mostly in the cases where threedimensional (3D) structures of the targets are unknown; and (2), using molecular docking approaches to screen the libraries in cases where the 3D structures of the targets are available [4, 5] . Because more and more 3D structures of drug target proteins are available, VS with molecular docking approaches has become promising, as demonstrated by numerous recent examples [2, [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] .",

[11] published the first docking algorithm DOCK in 1982, numerous docking programs have been developed during the past two decades [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . Several comprehensive reviews of the advances of docking algorithms and applications have been published [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] . Scoring (ranking) the compounds retrieved from a database is performed simultaneously with the docking simulation. Molecular docking is a typical optimization problem, for it is difficult to obtain the global optimum solution. As the fitness during the optimization process, scoring function should be fast and accurate enough, allowing simultaneous ranking of the retrieved poses in the optimization process. Based on this idea, several scoring functions have been developed [31] [32] [33] . Unfortunately, there is no scoring function developed so far that can reliably and consistently predict a ligand-protein binding mode and the binding affinity at the same time [31, 32, 34] . Therefore, heuristic docking and consensus score strategies are often used in virtual screening [34] [35] [36] .",

One is the computational cost; only docking programs capable of docking a flexible ligand within a reasonable time scale are acceptable for virtual screening [34] . The other one is the ability to discriminate between true actives and inactive compounds; only those docking approaches able to distinguish the active molecules rapidly and accurately, are suitable for virtual screening applications in practice. Although the consensus score strategy has demonstrated an advantage over single scores, it is actually based on the results of single scoring optimization. This means that consensus scoring only re-scores a limited molecules or conformations (generally 30 or more), thereby inevitably losing a number of true positives [33, 34] . To some extent, consensus scoring seems to be far-fetched and artificial [37] .",

However, real-world problems normally involve multiple objectives (possibly conflicting ones) or optimization criteria, which should be satisfied simultaneously, and suitable solutions to the overall problem cannot be found by using individual optimization algorithms with single objectives [38] . For example, an optimization solution for the binding affinity (energy) between a ligand and a receptor is usually not the optimization solution for other criteria (e.g. shape or chemical complementarity, etc.). Similar problems in combinatorial library design and structural superposition of three-dimensional molecules have been reported [39, 40] . Thus, there is a need for an optimization algorithm compromising several objectives, which may result in more reasonable and robust binding modes between ligands and receptors. In fact, it is a problem of multi-objective optimization (MO) [41] , which tends to find a set of alternative good compromises, generally known as pareto-optimal solutions. These solutions are optimal because no other solutions in the search space superior to them when all objectives are considered. Then, the 'optimum' is chosen by the design which fits better in a certain application. [42] There are more than twenty mathematical multi-objective optimization techniques [43, 44] . However, due to their inherent parallelism, evolutionary algorithms (EAs) and genetic algorithms (GAs) are still the top priority in terms of finding multiple pareto-optimal solutions for multiobjective optimization problems [45] .",

An EA population P(t) and an archival population E(t) (t is the iteration counter) were used as two coevolving populations in \u03b5-MOEA. After initialization, two solutions from P(t) and E(t) were chosen for mating. Then, each of these offspring solutions was compared with the archive and the EA population for possible inclusion. For the case of j objectives, the search space and objective space were divided into hyper-boxes (a number of grids, each having the size \u03b5 j in the jth objective) to ensure that a hyper-box could be occupied by only one solution through comparing with an identification array of the archive, which guarantees the diversity of the archive. The total number of pareto-optimal solutions, i.e. the final size of suitable solutions, can be controlled approximately by adjusting the \u03b5 j value (see refs [58] and [57] for more details).",

MOEA_Nrg efficiently eliminates conformations that could not satisfy shape complementarity although they displayed good energy scores. The maximum enrichment was 2.8-fold over random, which was reached at the top 8.8% of the database when using a single energy score for optimization, but the maximum enrichment was 3.9-fold over random, and moved up to the top 2.6% of the database when using MOEA_Nrg (Figure 3a) . MOEA_Cnt also got a good enrichment (EF = 3.4485) at the top 0.4% of the database, but it was worse than single contact score with EF = 6.9 at the top 0.2%. There are several possible explanations; first, the conformation with highest contact score cannot satisfy energy score, that is, the conformation that has the best contact score but a bad energy score not among the paretooptimal solutions will be eliminated; second, the scoring function is imprecise which is the common disadvantage for all the scoring functions. Interestingly, although contact score maintained higher enrichment among the top 2% of the database, the same enrichment as that of MOEA_Nrg was obtained at the top 2% of the database, and from this point, the enrichment peak of MOEA_Nrg became broader.

A set of pareto-optimal solutions were obtained which can simultaneously satisfy energy and shape complementarity using \u03b5-MOEA method, then through two different preferences, the binding conformations of pareto-optimal solutions with lowest energy scoring or best shape complementarity were ranked among all selected conformations. However, EFMOGA acquires different weights of each scoring function for different systems based on experimental X-ray complex structure, that is, for different system, EFMOGA regards the varying weight as the degree of contribution of individual scoring function, which generally focuses on one aspect for a special type of binding sites, this means the scoring function with bigger weight is more suitable for the binding site. We used 10000 random compounds as the decoys, active compounds selected from MDDR database were randomly merged into the decoys, respectively. To ensure justness of comparison, GAsDock, based on an improved genetic algorithm, was used as a benchmark for single-objective optimization. Results show that MOSFOM can enhance the enrichment and greatly increase the hit rates compared with individual score (see Results). For three different kinds of binding sites, MOSFOM represents excellent ability of distinction of active compounds with energy and shape complementarity. EFMOGA specially performed well at the top 2% of the database, MOEA_Nrg and MOEA_Cnt performed better than individual scoring function if a proper type of binding site was selected.",

By analyzing the characteristics of binding site in advance, the most effective multi-objective optimization method is adopted, which is meaningful for all current scoring functions since they can not suit all cases. More specific scoring functions and protein flexibility will be taken into account in our future work.",
