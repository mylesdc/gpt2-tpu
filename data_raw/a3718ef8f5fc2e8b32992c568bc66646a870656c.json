Human caliciviruses (HuCV) including norovirus (NoV, genogroup GI and GII) and sapovirus (SaV), is a leading cause of acute sporadic diarrhea in individuals across all age groups. However, few studies had been conducted clarifying the characteristics of HuCV in diarrhea cases across all age groups in China. Stool specimens were collected from 1,121 diarrhea cases and 319 healthy controls in outpatient departments. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to detect NoV (GI, GII) and SaV. Sequencing was applied to confirm the three viral infections and phylogenetic analysis was performed to determine their genotypes. A structured questionnaire was used to record the demographic information and clinical symptoms of subjects.",

Human caliciviruses (HuCV) including norovirus (NoV) and sapovirus (SaV) are single-stranded RNA viruses [3] . NoV is classified into six genogroups (GI-GVI), which are subdivided into at least 38 genotypes based on their cap and pol genes [4] . NoV is the leading cause of sporadic cases and outbreaks of acute diarrhea worldwide [5, 6] . NoV-related viral gastroenteritis, known as the stomach flu, is one kind of mild diarrhea, and is characterized by sudden intense vomiting (more common in children), watery stool, or liquid stool without blood (more common in adults) [7] . The NoV infection is self-limiting and the symptoms may disappear after less than three days, but prolonged diarrhea symptoms (e.g. dehydration and death) and viral shedding might occur in immune-deficient individuals and the elderly [5, 8] .",

Several factors may explain this phenomenon: on the one hand, immune defenses (such as milk IgA antibodies) might protect against NoV GII infection in children below six months of age [40, 41] ; on the other hand, non-specific properties (such lactoferrin and enterotoxin-binding oligosaccharides present in artificial milk powder, which is the most common food for children) might prevent the adherence of NoV GII to mucosal invasion to reduce the virus count or toxicity [40, 42] . These factors might also interpreted that the healthy carrier rate of NoV GII in non-diarrhea subjects below five years of age (5.5 %) was higher than that of healthy controls above five years of age (1.5 %). Mathematical modeling also proved that protection against acute diarrhea could be acquired in early life and led more frequently to NoV asymptomatic infection [43] .",

In this study, GII.4 was preponderant genotype in all genotypes of NoV GII, which was in accordance with the epidemic characteristics of GII.4 in other studies [44] , but the constituent ratio of GII.4 in all NoV GII genotypes was less than that found in other studies conducted in the period of 2008-2009 in China [28] .

The low prevalence of NoV might suggest that other enteropathogens such as bacterial and parasitic pathogens played a prominent role in diarrhea disease [10] . Acute gastroenteritis cases due to NoV had mild diarrhea symptoms, thus many NoV-related diarrhea cases might not seek medical treatment. This might explain why the prevalence of NoV in community cases (24.0 %) was higher than that found in outpatient cases (17.0 %) [10] . Diarrhea cases in our study were all selected from outpatient departments, which might be the reason for the low prevalence of NoV in this study. The prevalence of NoV in this study was lower than that found in Shanghai, China [27] . This difference might be caused by the different food habits among residents in different areas; shellfish, which is easily infected with NoV [46] , was one of the common foods for residents in Shanghai, which is near the Yangtze river and the sea, but shellfish is not commonly eaten in inland regions. Food species might be one of the important reasons for the variation of NoV in different regions. There were no significant differences in NoV GII prevalence across several age groups, which might suggest that age had no significant influence on NoV infection. Other studies led to similar conclusions [28, 34] . The reasons might be that NoV had great diversity and a lack of long-term immunity, hence human immunity to NoV was not stable and repeated infection might occur throughout life [8] . But the prevalence of GII was slightly higher in children aged below five years with diarrhea and in elderly patients. This finding was in accordance with some other reports [43, 47] . NoV tended to infect these subgroups because they have relatively low immunity to NoV [20] . One interesting finding of this study was that diarrhea cases in children below two years of age and elderly patients were susceptible to the GII.17 genotype, which might be explained by the weak immune system of these two age groups and the fact that the newly emergent GII.17 had no immune barrier among the population.",

The GII.17 variant was the prominent genotype in sporadic diarrhea patients, the detection rate of which in diarrhea cases was up to 15.0 %, which was higher than the prevalence of the GII.4 Sydney 2012 strain in sporadic diarrhea patients in Jiangsu Province, China, from the end of 2014 onwards [29] . The novel pathogen GII.17 variant Fig. 1 Phylogenetic trees of SaV and NoV (GI, GII) based on dependent RNA polymerase. \u2022: diarrhea cases above five years of age; \u25cb: controls above five years of age; \u25b2: diarrhea cases below five years of age; \u25b3: controls below five years of age. The count in bracket is the number of same genotype isolated from diarrhea cases and healthy controls. The molecular analysis of SaV and NoV (GI, GII) showed that NoV GII was the major subtype of HuCV, and GII.4 was the most predominant genogroup detected in diarrhea patients. In addition, GII.17 variant emerged in diarrhea cases was found in diarrhea patients in the study, which benefitted from the web-based information system for disease control and prevention in China [48] . In addition, laboratory-based pathogen diagnosis was conducted to find novel pathogens or variant strains [49, 50] . In the meantime, a syndrome-based surveillance system has also been important in supporting the detection of variations in the intestinal pathogen spectrum and the emergence of the new pathogen or variant strain in China [50, 51] .",

Firstly, the subjects were mainly selected from urban areas, and in addition, the diarrhea cases were all selected from outpatient department, which might lead to selection bias in respect of the epidemiological characteristics of HuCV. Secondly, the number of healthy controls was small, hence the OR of the HuCV and NoV genogroups were not highly reliable. Thirdly, genetic characterization of NoV was only based on partial polymerase regions in this study. However, the genotyping of NoV based on only capsid regions or on both regions might provide different results. Therefore, further study involving diarrhea cases selected from urban, rural, outpatient, and inpatients departments will should be conducted to ensure accurate assessment of the NoV disease burden. A 1:1 match casecontrol study will be a good choice. Meanwhile, genotyping of NoV based on both capsid regions and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase regions should be conducted in order to enhance the accuracy and effectiveness of NoV GII genotyping.",

This will provide new obstacles to preventing NoVassociated diarrhea. Therefore, monitoring the prevalence trends and evolution of GII.17 is necessary. ",
