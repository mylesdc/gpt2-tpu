It has been postulated that infection causes activation of the innate immune system stimulating the release of proinflammatory cytokines, which may underlie the pathogenesis of both PTB and LBW [14] . Identification of a relationship between HRV infection during pregnancy and adverse birth outcomes has the potential to drive improvement of diagnostics, infection control measures, and treatment options for HRV infection. METHODS We conducted an analysis using samples and clinical data collected in a community-based, prospective placebo-controlled, randomized trial of maternal influenza immunization of 3693 pregnant women and their infants conducted in rural southern Nepal from 2011 to 2014. Methods of the parent study have been previously published [15] . In brief, illness episodes were identified through longitudinal household-based active weekly surveillance of women from the second trimester of pregnancy until 6 months postpartum. Mid-nasal swabs were collected from women meeting criteria for respiratory illness episode, which was defined as subjective fever plus 1 or more symptom (cough, sore throat, runny nose, or myalgia). Fever was included in the illness episode definition as part of the primary trial of maternal influenza immunization to capture influenza-like-illness during pregnancy [3] . Febrile HRV respiratory illness was defined as a respiratory illness episode with a nasal swab with HRV detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. A unique illness episode was defined as an illness episode followed by 7 symptom-free days. Only the primary HRV illness episode was included in the analysis.",

Gestational age was calculated based on last menstrual period according to a house-to-house census conducted every 5 weeks of all women of childbearing age [16] . If a woman had a missed period, then a urine pregnancy test was performed and she was enrolled in the study if her urine pregnancy test was positive. Therefore, the last menstrual period was used to date the infant's gestational age in the study with a 5-week recall period. The frequencies of each adverse outcome were compared between infants born to mothers with febrile HRV respiratory illness during pregnancy and those without febrile HRV respiratory illness during pregnancy. Infant weights were included if they were obtained at less than 72 hours after birth. Small-for-gestational age was calculated based on the INTERGROWTH-21st criteria [17] .

Real-time PCR for additional respiratory viruses, including respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza viruses 1-4, influenza, coronavirus, bocavirus, and adenovirus, was performed using previously published methods [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . Although the HRV RT-PCR assay has been shown to detect some enterovirus from culture lysates in which enterovirus was present in high copy numbers, this assay has not been positive when enterovirus-positive clinical respiratory specimens were tested as part of other studies and therefore less likely in this case to misdiagnose enterovirus as rhinovirus [23, 24] . Rhinoviruspositive samples collected from pregnant and postpartum women with cycle threshold values less than 30 were selected for sequencing using a previously published protocol [23] . For sequencing, previously extracted samples were used to generate complementary deoxyribonucleic acid using random hexamers, and sequencing was performed using primers targeting the 5' noncoding region. Gel-extracted amplicons were sequenced (GeneWiz) and analyzed using Sequencher 4.1 software and compared with HRV reference sequences from GenBank using the nucleotide-nucleotide Basic Local Alignment Search Tool ([BLAST] www.blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) algorithm. Trimmed sequences were aligned using Geneious R6.1 (Biomatters) and Seaview 4.4 [25] . Phylogenetic reconstruction was performed using the maximum likelihood method with 100 bootstrap replicates using PhyML 3.0 within DIVEIN [26] . Neighbor joining trees were drawn and edited using FigTree v1.4.1. Sequences were considered to be divergent genotypes if they differed from other study sequences by >2% when compared using BLAST [23] . Sequence data were not of sufficient length to be submitted to GenBank but are available upon request.",

Three HRV infections occurred in the first trimester of pregnancy, 40 in the second and 53 in the third. The lack of HRV infection in the first trimester is due to enrollment of women into the study beginning at 17 weeks gestation or later rather than lack of rhinovirus infection during the first trimester of pregnancy. Low birth weight prevalence was not affected by the trimester of pregnancy in which the HRV infection occurred (P = .91). Febrile HRV respiratory infection occurred yearround with a peak in October ( Figure 2 ) and accounted for a consistent 5% of respiratory virus infections each month. Low birth weight occurred at a monthly rate of 20%-30% (Supplementary Figure 2) . Due to the nature of enrollment, the number of patients under surveillance and therefore the numbers of samples collected were not constant over time, and this is reflected in the numbers of proportions of births and specimens tested (Figure 2 and Supplementary Figure 2) .

Human rhinovirus accounts for 18%-26% of cases of viral pneumonia in hospitalized children and was detected in approximately half of children admitted to the intensive care unit for lower respiratory tract infection [30, 31] . In adults, HRV is the most frequent cause of community-acquired pneumonia requiring hospitalization in the United States [12, 32, 33] . We find that 39% of women with rhinovirus infection sought care for their illness, and that 7% of these were seen by a physician or at a hospital. This compares to an international study of community-based elderly adults, where 15% of those with rhinovirus illness were hospitalized [34] .",

Low birth weight is the result of either preterm delivery or poor growth of the fetus resulting in intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). Rates of PTB did not differ in women with and without febrile HRV respiratory illness during pregnancy, suggesting that IUGR was the primary mechanism leading to LBW associated with HRV during pregnancy. We did not find a significant effect of febrile rhinovirus illness during pregnancy on PTBs or SGAs. We note that approximately half (52%, or 719 of 1380) of infants with any poor outcomes are affected by only 1 of 3 adverse birth outcomes (LBW, PTB, or SGA); and only 41 (1%) of infants are affected by all 3 adverse birth outcomes. Of 688 infants with LBW, 76% are also SGA (compared with 25% of 2063 who are not LBW but are SGA). Likewise, of 688 with LBW, 26% are also preterm (compared with only 8% of 2063 who are not LBW but are preterm). Therefore, although there is evident correlation between these outcomes, they are not completely overlapping. Therefore, these outcomes are defining distinct populations and, in our study, may demonstrate different associations with risk factors.",

Fever is associated with increased circulation of cytokines, in particular interleukin-8, and has been postulated to be part of the reason why women with influenza may be at increased risk of severe disease and adverse birth outcomes [3] . We did not find an effect of febrile respiratory illness without the detection of rhinovirus in this study, however, making this less likely to be responsible for the birth weight effect seen in this study.",

We find that pregnant women with rhinovirus had a median 5 days of symptoms, and that this did not differ in those with LBW or in those who had rhinovirus during pregnancy or after birth. No significant difference in hospitalizations, physician visits, or other care seeking was observed among pregnant women with febrile HRV illness who did and did not give birth to LBW infants. Because of the potential for flu vaccination to reduce risk of LBW or PTBs, we evaluated for a difference in the incidence of rhinovirus febrile illness in women who did and did not receive the flu vaccine during pregnancy. We found no difference with flu vaccination. In addition, no mothers with rhinovirus febrile illness had evidence of influenza coinfection as a potential etiology of LBW.",

Use of subjective fever as criteria for respiratory illness rather than use of a measured temperature may have also decreased our ability to detect respiratory illnesses. We also did not conduct surveillance before 17 weeks gestation, and, therefore, it is possible that some women had infections earlier in pregnancy that we were not able to identify in our study. Gestational age dating was limited by lack of first-trimester ultrasound; however, 5-weekly prospective home surveillance minimized maternal recall error of last menstrual periods. Illness episode severity measures, such as radiographic evidence of pneumonia or use of supplemental oxygen, were not evaluated because medical records of healthcare visits were not reviewed in this study. We were also unable to assess medical comorbidities in the participants, given the lack of access to primary or antenatal care in the study region. Other limitations include lack of detection of bacterial pathogens in this study. Human rhinovirus infections have been shown to augment respiratory bacterial colonization and infection; therefore, it is possible that bacterial infections may be contributing to the described febrile illnesses and play a role in the relationship with LBW. Mid-nasal samples were only obtained once weekly, and brief episodes of viral shedding, as commonly observed in adults with pre-existing immunity, could have been missed. The association of virologic factors, such as viral load or subtype, with disease severity, were also unable to be assessed due to a lack of a method to quantify rhinovirus by our RT-PCR assay and our limited ability to sequence the majority of the isolates. The study was performed within a single geographic locale with specific demographics and risk factors, compromising generalizability. Finally, because this is an observational study, we were unable to assess for a causal association between rhinovirus febrile respiratory illness and LBW. The groups with and without rhinovirus infection were similar in baseline sociodemographics, including factors that may affect LBW or risk of respiratory viral infections, such as maternal parity, maternal body-mass index, maternal literacy, household smoking, household density, and running water.",

Because LBW infants have an increased risk of mortality compared with their heavier counterparts and HRV is a highly prevalent respiratory virus, this may represent a potential modifiable risk factor to reduce risk of LBW infants, particularly in developing countries. Interventions to reduce the burden of febrile respiratory illness due to rhinovirus during pregnancy, such as measures to improve infection control, development of targeted therapies, or improvement of diagnostics, may have a significant impact on LBW and subsequent infant mortality worldwide.",
