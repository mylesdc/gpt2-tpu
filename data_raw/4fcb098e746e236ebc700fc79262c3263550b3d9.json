Although NP is regarded as a promising antiviral druggable target, no chemical ligands have been reported to interact with EBOV NP or MARV NP. We identified two compounds from a traditional Chinese medicine Gancao (licorice root) that can bind both NPs by combining affinity mass spectrometry and metabolomics approaches. These two ligands, 18\u03b2-glycyrrhetinic acid and licochalcone A, were verified by defined compound mixture screens and further characterized with individual ligand binding assays. Accompanying biophysical analyses demonstrate that binding of 18\u03b2-glycyrrhetinic acid to EBOV NP significantly reduces protein thermal stability, induces formation of large NP oligomers, and disrupts the critical association of viral ssRNA with NP complexes whereas the compound showed no such activity on MARV NP. Our study has revealed the substantial potential of new analytical techniques in ligand discovery from natural herb resources. In addition, identification of a chemical ligand that influences the oligomeric state and RNA-binding function of EBOV NP sheds new light on antiviral drug development.",

Two compounds, nucleozin and RK424, that are found to target IAV NP and alter its oligomeric state showed potent antiviral activity against IAV infection in vitro and in vivo 9, 10 . However, no chemical ligands have been reported towards EBOV NP or MARV NP. The only known ligand of EBOV NP is a peptide derived from the protein component VP35 within the viral nucleocapsid 11, 12 . This VP35 peptide binds NP with high affinity and specificity, inhibits NP oligomerization, and releases RNA from NP-RNA complexes in vitro. Previous elegant structural work on the VP35 peptide bound EBOV NP complex reveals how the peptide ligand occludes a large surface area important for NP assembly, NP-RNA interactions, and viral RNA synthesis 11, 12 . These results strongly imply that EBOV NP can be also a good target for therapeutic development.",

It has shown a wide variety of therapeutic properties such as antiviral, anti-hepatotoxic, anti-inflammatory, anti-leukemogenic, and anti-carcinogenic effects in clinical treatment of liver diseases [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] . Here, two compounds were discovered from Chinese licorice to bind both EBOV NP and MARV NP. They were verified by defined compound mixture screens and further characterized with individual ligand binding assays. Accompanying biophysical analyses demonstrate that binding of one ligand to EBOV NP significantly reduces protein thermal stability, induces formation of large NP oligomers and disrupts he critical association of viral ssRNA with NP complexes.

            "text": "To comprehensively screen the crude extract of Chinese licorice for virus NP ligand discovery, we devised a workflow combining affinity mass spectrometry and metabolomics approaches (Fig. 1A) . The recombinant core domains of Ebola virus NP (EBOV NP, amino acids and Marburg virus NP (MARV NP, amino acids 19-370) were purified and separately incubated with Chinese licorice extract before ultrafiltration was performed to isolate ligand-bound NP complexes. The compound mixture dissociated from the NP complexes or the protein-free control was subjected to metabolomic analysis using liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) (full datasets in Supplemental Table S1 ). A multivariate model based on orthogonal partial least-squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) was then created to differentiate the compound profiles from the crude extracts, the protein incubation samples and the control samples. In both types of NP experiments, there was distinct separation of three sample groups, indicating that the composition of compounds associated with the NP complex was substantially deviated from that in the crude extract and the control (Fig. 1B) . We then applied multiple criteria to select putative ligands specifically enriched in the EBOV NP or MARV NP complexes which include: 1) variable influence on projection (VIP) score > 1.0, representing compounds most implicated in the difference between the NP complex and control 27, 28 ; 2) average S/N value > 2.0 and RSD < 30%, indicating significant change of peak intensity of the compound in the protein complex relative to control 19, 20 ; 3) matching the accurate mass of a putative ligand to the TCM compound database for Chinese licorice (see details in Experimental). Using this set of stringent criteria, we identified 30 and 22 components from the licorice extract to be candidate ligands bound to EBOV NP or MARV NP, respectively (Fig. 1C , Table S1 ).",

To verify binding of ligands discovered from the licorice extract and evaluate other known licorice constituents, we incubated the EBOV NP or MARV NP protein with a mixture of fourteen pure standards at an equal amount for affinity MS analysis.

By contrast, all tested compounds including GC7 and GC13 had little influence on MARV NP thermal stability (Table 3) , suggesting the specificity of GC7 in impairing EBOV NP stability. The oligomeric state of viral NPs is closely related to their functions in replication and transcription of viral RNA genomes 4,10-12 . The N-terminal truncation construct of EBOV NP (residues 36-351) used in our study entails the folded core domain which stays as an RNA-free, monomeric form in solution 31 . However, addition of GC7 to the EBOV NP solution shifted the monomer to much larger molecular weight species as shown by size-exclusion chromatography with in-line multiangle light scattering (SEC-MALS) ( Table 3 ). Increased molar excess of GC7 eventually produced super-large complexes of EBOV NP. This ligand-bound EBOV NP core region gave rise to a monodispersed peak eluting in the void volume of SEC that closely resembled the peak of another construct 1-450 well characterized to form large homo-oligomeric complexes 11,12 (Supplemental Figure S3 ). These results indicated GC7 shifted the equilibrium of EBOV NP towards the native oligomeric state of NPs. Notably, addition of the structural enantiomer GC10 converted a small portion of the monomeric EBOV NP to oligomers. In contrast, GC13 and another licorice constituent GC2 had very little effect in mediating oligomerization of EBOV NP ( Table 3 ). The MARV NP truncation construct (residues 19-370) used in our study formed a mixed population of monomer, tetramer and large oligomer in solution. Interestingly, binding of GC7 to our MARV NP disrupted its tetramer conformation and increased the fraction of monomers in a dose-dependent way ( Table 3) . On the contrary, incubation of MARV NP with GC13 largely promoted tetramer formation (> 2-fold increase) whereas reducing the fraction of monomers. GC10 and GC2 did not induce significant changes in the monomer and oligomer distribution of MARV NP (Table 3) .",

We prepared EBOV NP mutants harboring alanine substitution at K160 and R298 to examine ligand binding capacity using our affinity MS approach. Compared to the wild-type protein, mutation at K160 resulted in nearly 40% loss of binding of both GC7 and GC13, and mutation at R298 reduced binding efficiency of two ligands to a less extent (Fig. 5A) . Importantly, the predicted binding free energy for GC7 (\u2212 5.88 kcal/mol) is much lower than that for GC10 (\u2212 2.75 kcal/mol), which provides the molecular basis for selective binding of one diostereo-isomer GC7 to the protein target.

The bacterial RNA co-purified with the protein was removed by collecting the monomer fraction eluted from SEC using high-salt buffer (1.5 M NaCl) (Supplemental Figure S4A) . Subsequent dilution to the low-salt condition (200 mM NaCl) triggered spontaneous NP oligomerization confirmed by SEC analysis (Supplemental Figure S4B) . The resulting oligomeric RNA-free EBOV NP 36-450 readily binds to an 18 nucleotide ssRNA with low micromolar affinity (~5 \u03bc M) measured by fluorescence anisotropy (Fig. 6A) . Next a competitive binding assay was conducted by first incubating the monomer of EBOV NP 36-450 with GC7 at various concentrations before diluting the mixture and adding the RNA probe. GC7 incubation with the NP monomer caused protein oligomerization. Importantly, this ligand when bound to the NP oligomer was found to compete with ssRNA for interaction with NP complexes. Increasing GC7 concentration during incubation resulted in a proportional loss of ssRNA from the RNA-NP complex, yielding a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) of ~160 \u03bc M (Fig. 6B) . These results indicate that the new ligand GC7 disrupts the interaction of EBOV NP with viral ssRNA through either directly occluding the RNA-binding cleft or inducing a conformational change of NP oligomers that would impair ssRNA association.",

            "text": "Most previous studies used HPLC coupled to a UV/vis detector to search for compounds that are enriched in the protein incubation with natural product extracts, and then applied mass spectrometry analysis to structural identification of these potential ligands. However, limited sensitivity of the UV/vis detector substantially lowers the chance of capturing medium to low abundant species in the complex crude extracts. In comparison to dozens of peaks typically observed in the ultrafiltration-HPLC chromatograms 29,35,36 , the HRMS-based the metabolomic experiment facilitates structural identification of putative ligands. Using the available reference compounds, structures of two ligands were unambiguously determined. GC7 (18\u03b2 -glycyrrhetinic acid) and GC13 (licochalcone A) represent the first chemical ligands reported to partake in interaction with filovirus NPs. Accompanying biophysical analyses demonstrate that GC7 binding impairs the thermal stability of EBOV NP core domain, triggers protein oligomerization, and disrupts viral RNA association with oligomeric NP complexes. Prior to our study the only documented ligand to EBOV NP is a peptide derived from EBOV VP35 which is a protein component of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase complex (RDRP) 11, 12 . Notably, this VP35 N-terminal peptide can maintain NP in a non-oligomeric and RNA-free state (NP 0 ), yet it cannot support viral RNA synthesis in trans. Thus the previous work on VP35 peptide chaperoning the NP assembly granted a model where Ebola VP35 peptide binding to NP prevents NP from associating with noncognate RNA (i.e., cellular and non-genomic viral RNA) 12 . Furthermore, VP35 is speculated to facilitate transfer of the monomeric and template-free NP to the viral template RNA to initiate RNA synthesis 11 . By contrast, the chemical ligand GC7 discovered in our study exerts an effect opposite to the VP35 peptide which is to induce formation of large oligomeric complexes of the NP core domain (Fig. 5B, Table 3 ). This result reminded us of nucleozin, a chemical compound targeting influenza A NP that can induce the formation of NP aggregates and antagonize its nuclear accumulation, leading to cessation of viral replication in vitro 9 . Another chemical RK424 which disrupts viral RNA-induced oligomerization of influenza A NP, also showed potent antiviral activity against many different subtypes of influenza A virus in vitro and in vivo 10 . However, no compounds capable of influencing the NP oligomeric state have been discovered towards Ebola virus up to date. As the NP protein is an integral part of the viral nucleocapsid and is intimately associated with the viral RNA template, its oligomeric state is particularly important for maintaining template integrity and providing template access to the viral RDRP 11 . The ability of GC7 to disrupt ssRNA association with NP complexes further indicates this ligand upon binding to the RNA-free NP monomer may induce a significant conformational change of the resulting oligomers that they no longer interact with viral ssRNA as effectively as the native NP oligomers. Therefore, whether GC7 and its derivatives have any pharmacological activity on Ebola virus life cycle would be a very intriguing question to address in the future.",

            "text": "According to our in silico docking results, both GC7 and GC13 are predicted to interact with the RNA-binding groove of EBOV NP which is composed of certain basic residues (K160, K171, K248 and R298). In particular, K160 and R298 possibly make hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl groups of two ligands (Fig. 4C,D) . Substitution of K160 with alanine resulted in significant loss of binding capacity of GC7, and this residue is further engaged in GC7-induced NP oligomerization (Fig. 5) . We also noticed that substitution of either K160 or R298 did not completely abrogate binding capacity of GC7 and GC13, suggesting there may be other residues engaged in ligand interactions. Importantly, these residues comprising the GC7/GC13-binding site are well conserved across the whole filovirus family (Fig. 4B ) and known to play essential roles in encapsidation of the viral genome and EBOV proliferation 31, [38] [39] [40] , which sheds light on antiviral drug development. Considering the strong homology of the core domain between EBOV NP and MARV NP, we would speculate GC7 and GC13 might interact with the RNA-binding groove of MARV NP in a similar fashion. It is noteworthy that GC7 exhibits much less influence on the thermal stability and oligomerization state of MARV NP compared to EBOV NP, probably because the protein was purified in a mixed form of monomer, tetramer and oligomer (Table 3 ). In addition, lack of protein structural data for MARV NP renders it more difficult to predict ligand binding mode. Therefore, further structural and biochemical study of the NP-ligand complex is needed to definitively identify the precise interaction mode.",

Glycyrrhizin is a well-characterized major component of Chinese licorice and possesses a wide range of pharmacological and biological activities 24 . Glycyrrhizin in line with glycyrrhetinic acid have been developed in China and Japan as an anti-inflammatory, antiviral, and antiallergic drug for liver disease treatment 24 . It is of our particular notion that glycyrrhizin was reported to inhibit the replication of SARS-associated coranovirus and Hepatitis C virus [37] [38] [39] . Furthermore, glycyrrhizin exerts antiviral effects in H5N1 influenza A virus-infected cells by inhibiting virus replication and pro-inflammatory gene expression 40 . Interestingly, although glycyrrhizin (i.e. GC6) is an abundant constituent of Chinese licorice, we did not observe its direct binding to EBOV NP or MARV NP in the crude extract or the compound mixture screens (Figs 1 and 3) , nor did it show any influence on NP thermal stability ( Table 2 ). Our results clearly indicate that it is GC7, the primary metabolite of glycyrrhizin, that targets viral NPs directly and exhibits multiple biological activities against EBOV NP. These findings would shed new light on our understanding of the antiviral mechanism of Chinese licorice. Given the structural diversity and novelty of numerous compounds in natural products and traditional Chinese medicine, our study presents a promising new approach to mine the great resource of natural herbs for ligand discovery towards therapeutic targets and thus aid potential drug development.",

Extracted ion chromatograms (EICs) were checked to review consistency of integration across samples, to analyze peak shapes, and to exclude background noise. Features from the NP incubation sample showing intensity over 25 (LOQ levels for most compounds in our LC-HRMS system) across four replicates were kept for multivariate analysis. The preprocessed data sets were used as input for SIMCA (version14, Umetrics, Sweden), and data analysis was preceded with the supervised Orthogonal Projection to Latent Structures-Discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) models 27, 28, 42 . All data were log transformed and Pareto scaled to minimize heteroscedasticity and to adjust for fold differences between components. The model validity was verified using permutation tests and CV-ANOVA by SIMCA and also by checking the goodness of fit (R 2 X = 0.908, R 2 Y = 0.993, Q 2 = 0.967 for the EBOV NP model; R 2 X = 0.906, R 2 Y = 0.989, Q 2 = 0.885 for the MARV NP model). Contribution of each component to sample group separation was reflected by the Variable Influence on Projection (VIP) score in OPLS-DA. We also calculated the ratio of peak intensity from the protein incubation sample vs the control (S/N) for each component. Components that match the accurate mass to the TCM compound database for Chinese licorice (within 20 mDa mass tolerance) and show S/N ratios with RSD < 30% from four replicates are recognized as putative licorice constituents, and their data were used to make the VIP and S/N plots (Fig. 1C) . Potential NP ligands from licorice extracts were further selected based on: 1) VIP score > 1.0 27,28 ; 2) average S/N ratio > 2.0 (RSD < 30%) 19, 20 . The TCM compound database was purchased from Neotrident Company (Beijing, China) 43 .",
