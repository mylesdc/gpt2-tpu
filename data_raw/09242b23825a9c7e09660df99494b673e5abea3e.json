It has been asserted that after insertion into the membrane, proteins undergo structural arrangements in the monomeric form. In an analogy with single protein folding, during synthesis proteins are thought to rapidly achieve an intermediate state referred to as the 'molten globule' or 'compact intermediate' state 3 . Since hardly any information is available about this state, at this point, how the final assembly is formed can only be speculated. Viral channel forming proteins (VCPs) encoded by the virus are a special type of membrane protein which are a dependant of the larger ion channels of the host 4-8 but smaller in size. Since VCPs are also known to interact with host proteins and initiate ion channel-independent functions, it can be hypothesized that they also need to 'exist' as monomers. In this respect, VCPs can be used to explore the dynamics and structural features of membrane protein assembly within the lipid membrane [9] [10] [11] [12] .",

The ion channel activity of Vpu has been shown to be attributed solely to the TMD 17 . A recent review has discussed speculations about the, as yet, unclear ion channel function of Vpu in vivo 18 . In addition, Vpu is phosphorylated at two serines at positions 52 and 56 which are responsible for initiating downregulation of membrane proteins of the host, including CD4 19 , BST-2 20, 21 or NTB-A 22 . This function of initiation of host factor degradation is independent of the function of altering electrochemical gradients via the formation of an ion channel 17, 23 .",

In the case of the pentameric ligand gated ion channel of Gloebacter violaceus (GLIC), the serines and threonines of the pore-lining helices M2 of each of the five subunits points into the lumen forming a hydrophilic ring 25 . It was also speculated that the only hydrophilic residue in the transmembrane domain of Vpu, Ser-23, should point into an ion conducting pore 26 . However, in these computational models 10 Ser-23 is located at the helix-lipid interface leaving the putative pore as a pure hydrophobic stretch, they contradict the current notion of the putative pore architecture. Consequently, there is a need for further refinement of the model of the formation of ion-conducting pore by assembled Vpu. In addition, Vpu is known to act against host factors for down-regulation. Vpu was proposed to exist in a stable equilibrium between oligomeric and monomeric forms, which are inactive and active, respectively, for interacting with host proteins 27 . However, how Vpu is assembled and how it eventually reaches a pore-like formation remains to be characterized.",

Wild-type (WT) Vpu and mutations at the sites of the phosphorylated serines at positions 52 and 56 were investigated to assess the role of phosphorylation in the dynamics of assembly. Coarse grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) simulations of Vpu proteins embedded in a planar lipid bilayer model were chosen to evaluate the oligomeric assembly under likely in vivo conditions such as an abundance of Vpu proteins in a large lipid patch and simulated over a long time period. In addition, CGMD simulations proposed mechanical features of how individual domains of Vpu, both transmembrane and cytoplasmic, contribute to the assembly process.",

The SDS-PAGE analysis of the double mutants Vpu-DD and Vpu-NN, which lack phosphate groups at the serines, showed only a single band each on the SDS-PAGE at various molecular weights due to the decreased migration rate of the negative charged Vpu-DD upon denaturation (Fig. 2a , lanes 3 and 9) 28, 29 . Vpu-52D and Vpu-56D each show two bands ( Fig. 2a lanes 5 and 7) .

The respective averaged oligomeric state was calculated to be around 19.0 \u00b1 2.0 for P 1 and 2.0 \u00b1 0.2 for P 2 . Thus, Vpu is able to exist in two oligomeric states, which are most likely a dimer and higher oligomer. Modulation of the dynamics of Vpu-WT, Vpu-NN and Vpu-DD oligomerization by the two phosphorylation sites. After purification of the proteins from a stock solution, the peak ratio between the higher oligomer (referring to P 1 ) and the dimer (referring to P 2 ) for Vpu-WT and Vpu-DD was in favor of the dimer for all ionic strengths investigated, 50, 150 and 300 mM NaCl (Fig. 3a) . The peak of the higher oligomer is the largest at the highest ionic strength of 300 mM NaCl for the two proteins. The peak area of the higher oligomer was largest for Vpu-NN at all ionic strengths (Fig. 3b) . Higher ionic strength screens the negative charges at the serine sites and even the partial charges of the amide group in asparagine indicating electrostatic type interaction modulates assembly.",

Vpu-DD (Fig. 4b , red) and Vpu-NN (Fig. 4b , blue) can both be fitted with a single function (see also Table 2 ). Vpu-NN (c = 1.05 day \u22121 ) and Vpu-DD (c = 0.56 day \u22121 ) mark a fast and slow increase in the area of the higher oligomer, respectively. Vpu-WT exhibited a fast increase (c = 2.35 day \u22121 ) first, followed by a slow increase (c = 0.31 day \u22121 ), similar to the afore-mentioned growth rates of Vpu-NN and Vpu-DD, respectively. As a result, Vpu-DD, due to their negative charges at the two serine sites tended to assemble very slowly reaching a final assembly ratio of a = 0.22, whilst Vpu-NN, having charges removed at the site of the two serines, assembled very quickly reaching the largest assembly ratio of a = 0.78. Therefore, the fast increase in the peak of the higher oligomer of Vpu-WT should be due to the assembly of non-phosphorylated Vpu, whilst the slower increase of that peak should be due to the assembly of both, single and double phosphorylated Vpu proteins. The single phosphorylated Vpu proteins obscure the plot in as much they show 'mixed' assembly dynamics. The negative charges of the phosphorylated serine site slowdown or even prevent oligomerization.",

Two copies of the kinked Vpu 1-52 are run in a single lipid patch in an inverted orientation for 100 ns (Fig. S1 ). Both of the helices remain in both of the structures. Both of the structures (Fig. S1 , black and red curves) show larger root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) values for residues Glu-28 to Ile-32. The structure shown by the red lines in Fig. S1 , named Vpu 1-52 , was chosen for the next step, since the residues Leu-33 to Arg-40 of its second membrane-associated helix show lower RMSF values than those of the structure represented by the black curve. Residues Ile-38 to Ala-49 of the second, membrane-associated helix of Vpu 1-52 are overlapped with the N terminal side of the NMR-based structure of Vpu 16 to finally generate full-length Vpu 1-80 with united atoms. MD simulation of two copies of Vpu 1-80 showed a leveling off of the root mean square deviation (RMSD) values after about 10 ns (Fig. S2 , upper left). One of the Vpu 1-80 structures showed large fluctuations of the amino acids in the kink region (Ile-32 to Gln-35, Fig. S2 , upper right, red curve).

Analysis of the growth curve showed that the growth rates c of the TMDs are almost independent of the phosphorylation state.

The precise oligomeric state of Vpu has not yet been established. In many studies, synthetic peptides corresponding to the transmembrane domain of Vpu or Vpu expressed in Escherichia coli 10 and purified have been used (Supplementary Table S1 ). In these studies using electrophoresis, it was proposed that the TM of Vpu 32 exists in the tetramer to hexamer range. Size-exclusion chromatography of full-length Vpu by coupled transcription/translation systems suggests a pentameric structure 24 . In the E. coli system, all forms of Vpu, either the TM-containing segment or full-length Vpu, were over-expressed into inclusion bodies and extracted into denaturating buffer. In a subsequent step the Vpu protein is then refolded. In this study, full-length Vpu is expressed in human cells and extracted into LDAO micelles from cell membranes. LDAO is a gentle and commonly-used detergent for membrane protein structure determination 33, 34 . Application of other detergents like Cymal5 (5-cyclohexyl-1-pentyl-\u00df-D-maltoside), also showed a similar pattern of two peaks in the size-exclusion chromatogram (data not shown). The expression system and purification steps in this protocol most likely keep the structure in the native states as much as was possible. In addition, SEC-MALS which measures molar mass directly is used as a tool to obtain the oligomeric states of Vpu without relying on reference standards which are usually needed in conventional size-exclusion chromatography. From our results, the smallest oligomeric state of Vpu and Vpu with phosphate group is a dimer. Experimental evidence about this has not been reported in previous studies. The dimer is assembling into larger assemblies of up to approximately 19 proteins.",

In this study, the computational models exhibit the same behavior as found experimentally. The dimer is smallest unit to assemble. The level and growth rate of oligomerization of Vpu without the phosphate groups is bigger and faster than Vpu with phosphate groups. In addition, structural features taken from the simulation data allowed specification of the interaction dependent on the cytoplasmic domain and TMD with the latter contributing mostly to the oligomerization ratio. The coarse-graining investigations of conformational dynamics are limited to emphasizing the diffusive aspects of the protein in the bilayer. The computational data represent a semi-quantitative analysis of protein diffusivity which matches the experimental findings. The number of Vpu was chosen to be 16 instead of the putative 19 Vpu molecules calculated from the experimental analysis.

This formation of a dimer is driven by the association of the TMDs as indicated from computer simulations. In the dimer the two phosphorylation sites are the furthest apart due to electrostatic charge repulsion. During assembly into larger units the exposed negative charges of the phosphate groups have to be taken care of. Whilst the cytoplasmic domain directs oligomerization, the TMDs are responsible for holding the oligomer together. Based on this study, how Vpu is assembled and how it eventually reaches a pore-like structure is shown in the schema in Fig. 7 . Some of the individual monomers assemble into dimers via association of TMDs (Fig. 7a,b) . Within a larger assembly or patch (Fig. 7c) , dimers and additional monomers are able to adopt conformations, which can either be channel-like (as marked by the red circles) or not channel-like (as marked by the dashed grey circles). Conformational changes of the proteins will allow e.g., to the transformation of Vpu proteins from the not channel-like region into the channel-like regions. It is always possible that the assemblies can be made out of the dimers or a mixture of both dimers and monomers. The generation of protein patches for more than 16-20 proteins may be restricted due to thermodynamic considerations taking into account protein binding affinities and protein dynamics due to the membrane environment.",

Non-linear regression was performed by using non-linear curve fitting of OriginLab 9.0. The initial values were set to a = 1, b = 1, and c = 0.1. Iteration was conducted until the difference between reduced \u03c7 2 values of two successive iterations was less than a specified tolerance value, here 10 \u22129 by default. Fitting the experimental Vpu-WT data two logistic growth functions were combined additively. Structures are considered as oligomers when the distance between 10 pairs of CG-atoms of different Vpu structures was below 5 \u00c5 and observed continuously for more than 10 times steps between the proteins.",

The fully suspended cells were disrupted twice on ice by Microfluidizer (M-110 L). Cell lysate was centrifuged in a JA25.5 rotor (Beckman Coulter) at 12,000 g for 35 min at 4 \u00b0C to remove unbroken cells and debris. The supernatant was then centrifuged in a Ti 45 rotor (Beckman Coulter) at 40,000 rpm for 1 h at 4 \u00b0C to separate the membrane pellet.Vpu membrane pellets were homogenized with 0.5% (wt/vol) lauryldimethylamine-oxide (LDAO) detergents and incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C.

The encoded protein contains a thrombin cleavage site (LVPRGS motif) cleavage site separating Strep-His8 tag from the C terminus of Vpu. Thus, a ratio of Thrombin (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to purified Vpu proteins at room temperature overnight. The mixture was concentrated using an Amicon Ultra Centrifugal Filter (Millipore).Protein analysis.Protein concentration in the samples was quantified by Nanotrop (Thermo). Protein purity was analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 16% acrylamide gels, stained by Rapid Stain. Size-exclusion chromatography was performed on a FPLC system (AKTA, GE) using a Superdex 200 10/30 size exclusion column pre-equilibrated in the buffer (0.05 M Tris, pH 8.0, 0.15 M NaCl and 0.05% (wt/vol) LDAO). The flow rate was set at 0.5 ml/min. Absorbance at 280 nm was monitored and recorded. The fraction from the major peak was collected in 0.5 ml fractions.SEC/MALS measurement. The mass determination of purified Vpu protein and LDAO detergent inVpu-LDAO micelle was measured by a combination of size exclusion chromatography (SEC) coupled with three detectors: Multi-Angle Light Scattering (MALS), Refractive Index Detection (RI) and UV 280nm absorbance (Wyatt Technology). The whole system was pre-equilibrated with 50 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl and 0.05% LDAO buffer. Vpu-LDAO micelles were injected into a Superdex 200 10/30 column at 0.3 ml/min in buffer and then passed through the multi-angle light scattering detector and refractive index detector continuously. The data was analyzed by ASTRA software (Wyatt Technology).Construction of full-length Vpu model. An ideal helical structure of the first 52 amino acids of Vpu (Vpu 1-52 , HV1S1, P19554) was generated using the MOE software suit (www.chemcomp.com). The sequence used for Vpu 1",
