            "text": "Motivation: Deep sequencing of clinical samples is now an established tool for the detection of infectious pathogens, with direct medical applications. The large amount of data generated produces an opportunity to detect species even at very low levels, provided that computational tools can effectively profile the relevant metagenomic communities. Data interpretation is complicated by the fact that short sequencing reads can match multiple organisms and by the lack of completeness of existing databases, in particular for viral pathogens. Here we present metaMix, a Bayesian mixture model framework for resolving complex metagenomic mixtures. We show that the use of parallel Monte Carlo Markov chains for the exploration of the species space enables the identification of the set of species most likely to contribute to the mixture. Results: We demonstrate the greater accuracy of metaMix compared with relevant methods, particularly for profiling complex communities consisting of several related species. We designed metaMix specifically for the analysis of deep transcriptome sequencing datasets, with a focus on viral pathogen detection; however, the principles are generally applicable to all types of metagenomic mixtures.

Among these applications, the discovery of viral pathogens is clearly relevant for clinical practice (Chiu, 2013; Fancello et al., 2012) . The traditional process of characterizing a virus through potentially difficult and time consuming culture techniques is being revolutionized by advances in high throughput sequencing.

Part of the difficulty stems from the read length limitation of existing deep DNAsequencing technologies, an issue compounded by the extensive level of homology across viral and bacterial species. Another complication is the divergence of the microbial DNA sequences from the publicly available references. As a consequence, the assignment of a sequencing read to a database organism is often unclear. Last, the number of reads originating from a disease causing pathogen can be low (Barzon et al., 2013) . The pathogen contribution to the mixture depends on the biological context, the timing of sample extraction and the type of pathogen considered. Therefore, highly sensitive computational approaches are required.",

From a statistical standpoint, this identification and quantification question can be thought of as an application of mixture models. These ideas have been applied in the metagenomics context in frequentist [GRAMMy (Xia et al., 2011) ] and Bayesian [Pathoscope (Francis et al., 2013) ] settings. GRAMMy formulates the problem as a finite mixture model, using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate the relative genome abundances. Pathoscope refines this process by penalizing reads with ambiguous matches in the presence of reads with unique matches and enforcing parsimony within a Bayesian context. Fitting a mixture model is useful for the species relative abundance estimation, as well as the read to species assignment. A related but distinct question concerns the set of species which should be included in the mixture model. This question is closely related to the biological question of asking what species are present in the mixture. Including all species flagged as potential matches by the read classification can introduce a large number of species, often in the low thousands. Mixture models will then identify a large number of species at low levels. This interpretation is appropriate in some applications. In many other cases, the expectation is that the underlying species set should be parsimonious and that some divergence with database species or sequencing errors can explain a large fraction of the non matching reads.",

Our strategy is based on parallel tempering, a Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) technique, using parallel computing to speed up the inference. We implemented these ideas in a user friendly R package called metaMix. metaMix produces posterior probabilities for various models as well as the relative abundances under each model.

We first fitted the mixture model with the complete set of 2500 species and a limited run length of 500 iterations. Based on this analysis, we identified 1312 species supported by at least one read and explored this state space. To limit the computational time, we also considered a stronger approximation, including only the 374 potential species supported by at least 10 sequencing reads. Both approaches generated similar results, albeit the more complex one with 1312 potential species required the quadruple of the computation time (12 h instead of 3 h). metaMix identified 116 species, detecting successfully all the members of the metagenomic community. These were detected on the strain level except in four instances where a different strain of the same species, or different species within the same genus was detected. Four species were identified and not in the simulated dataset, hence can be considered as false positives. In order to assess the variability of metaMix results, we ran the analysis 25 times changing the random seed. We report the number of species detected, the sensitivity and specificity as well as relative abundance estimate measure errors, at various posterior probability cutoffs (Table 1) . We summarize the resulting community profile based on one of these runs in Supplementary Table S1 .",

We followed up on the sequences assigned to the 'unknown category', looking for nucleotide similarity with NR-NT using BLASTn. Half of the reads originated from an untranslated region of the Coronavirus genome, which is not captured by the protein reference database. The remaining reads matched confidently to either zebrafish or chicken sequences, two organisms whose proteins are not in the human microbiome reference we are using. These matches were explained as barcode leakage resulting from multiplexing on the same flowcell zebrafish and chicken RNA-Seq libraries. metaMix appropriately assigned these reads to the 'unknown' category, producing a clean probabilistic summary (Supplementary Table S2 ).

Using a Bayesian mixture model framework, we account for model uncertainty by performing model averaging and we resolve ambiguous assignments by considering all reads simultaneously. A key feature of the method is that it provides probabilities that answer pertinent biological questions, in particular the posterior probability for the presence of a species in the mixture. Additionally it accurately quantifies the relative proportions of the organisms. This general framework is designed to address interpretation issues associated with closely related strains in the sample, low abundance organisms and absence of genomes from the reference database. We show that metaMix outperforms other methods in the community profiling task, particularly when complex structures with closely related strains are studied. As a consequence, it also produces more accurate relative abundance estimates for the species in the mixture. The method can deal with either unassembled reads or assembled contigs or both, allowing for flexibility of choice for the bioinformatics preprocessing. In practice, the choice of bioinformatics processing prior to the application of our Bayesian mixture analysis must be optimized for each application, and our processing pipeline has been designed with viral sequence identification from transcriptome sequencing as a main goal. Nevertheless, as demonstrated by our analysis of the mock bacterial community dataset, the method can be applied in other contexts.",

For the datasets presented here, the computation time remained manageable and did not exceed a few hours, using 12 cores to run 12 parallel chains. Nevertheless, a limitation of metaMix is the increased processing time for very large datasets. Speed related improvements can be implemented in scenarios where the species ambiguity concerns only a small proportion of the read set. Reads with certain assignments can be flagged prior to the MCMC exploration of the state-space. Their assignment information can then be carried forward, thereby reducing the size of the similarity matrix used as input by the mixture model. Another area of possible improvement is MCMC convergence determination. The current version of metaMix produces log-likelihood traceplots allowing the user to visually inspect the MCMC convergence; however, additional diagnostic criteria can be implemented in future versions. Finally, consideration of the differences between mismatches, especially on the amino-acid level could lead to more accurate estimation of the p ij probabilities. Such information is captured by the BLASTx similarity score. This metric could thus be used for probability estimation, instead of the number of mismatches. metaMix is most useful for complex datasets for which the interpretation is challenging. It has been mainly used as a clinical diagnostic tool, helping with the identification of the infecting pathogen while providing an accurate profile of the community in the sample.
