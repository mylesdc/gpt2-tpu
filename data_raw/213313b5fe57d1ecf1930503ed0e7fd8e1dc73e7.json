Serum samples were tested by PEDV (IgG, IgA) ELISAs using a procedure performed routinely at the Iowa State University-Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory (ISU-VDL). Serum samples were tested using PEDV serum IgG and IgA ELISA procedures as routinely performed at the Iowa State University-Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory (ISU-VDL). Serum samples were diluted 1:50 and conjugate concentrations were 1/20,000 for IgG and 1/3000 for IgA. Meat juice samples were tested using the serum PEDV IgG and IgA ELISAs, with modifications, i.e., meat juice samples were diluted 1:25 and conjugate concentrations were 1/40,000 for IgG and 1/10,000 for IgA. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analyses were used to estimate diagnostic sensitivities and specificities over a range of sample-to-positive (S/P) cutoffs. Consistent with previous reports, this study showed that the PEDV IgG and IgA meat juice ELISAs provided excellent diagnostic performance and suggest that meat juice recovered from samples collected at slaughter could be used in routine PEDV surveillance.",

As such, meat juice contains antibodies, albeit at a lower concentration than serum [1] , and diagnostically sensitive and specific meat juice antibody ELISAs have been described for porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), influenza A virus, Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, Salmonella spp., Trichinella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, and Toxoplasma gondii [2] . Meat juice is particularly compatible with abattoir-based surveillance because muscle tissue samples are easily collected at slaughter [2, 3] . Typically, meat samples collected in the abattoir are hard-frozen and then thawed after arrival at the laboratory to produce the specimen. Samples can be stored frozen or tested immediately. Abattoir-based meat juice surveillance or monitoring has been described for salmonella, Toxoplasma gondii, and PRRSV [2, 4] . Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the detection of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV)-specific IgG and IgA in individual serum and meat samples (longissimus dorsi muscle).",

Meat juice samples were harvested from the muscle tissue after one freeze-thaw cycle. Serum and meat juice samples were randomly ordered and tested using PEDV ELISAs (IgG and IgA), as fully described elsewhere [6] . In brief, PEDV ELISA plates were coated with purified PEDV (USA/NC35140/2013) viral particles propagated in Vero cells. To prepare the antigen, propagated PEDV was subjected to one freeze-thaw cycle (\u2212 80\u00b0C). The harvested material were centrifuged at 4000 x g for 15 min to remove cell debris. The virus pellet was harvested and washed (2X) with PBS (1X, pH 7.4). The purified virus was resuspended in PBS (1X pH 7.4) at a dilution of 1:100 of the original supernatant volume and stored at \u2212 80\u00b0C. The virus was coated onto polystyrene 96-well microtitration plates (Nalge Nunc Corp.). PEDV serum and meat juice ELISA (IgA, IgG) positive and negative controls consisted of samples controls collected from pigs of known PEDV status. Positive and negative controls were included in duplicate in every plate. To perform the test, 100 \u03bcl of diluted (1,50) serum was aliquoted into each well and the ELISA plate incubated for 1 h at 25\u00b0C. For serum, 1:20,000 peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-pig IgG (Fc) antibody (Bethyl Laboratories Inc., Montgomery, TX) or 1:3000 goat anti-pig IgA (Bethyl Laboratories Inc.) was added to each well and the plate incubated at 25\u00b0C for 1 h. The reaction was visualized by adding 100 \u03bcl of substrate solution (TMB, Dako North America, Inc., Carpinteria, CA) to each well, then incubating the plate at 25\u00b0C for 5 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 50 \u03bcl of stop solution (1 M sulfuric acid). Reactions were measured as optical density at 450 nm using an ELISA plate reader (Biotek\u00ae Instruments Inc., Winooski, VT). The results were represented as sample-to-positive (S/P) ratios:",

Highly transmissible and stable in the environment [10] , these viruses have moved rapidly across pork-producing regions of the world. The exception to the rule, Canada has been effective in slowing the spread of PEDV and PDCoV and may ultimately succeed in eliminating both viruses [12] . The Canadian effort is based on extensive surveillance of animals, farms, and the production chain, i.e., livestock assembly yards, abattoirs, truck wash stations, and livestock trailers, by RT-rtPCR. If control and elimination is successful, other regions may choose to follow suit. However, swine coronaviruses will continue to circulate widely in swine populations in much of the world. Thus, inexpensive but effective surveillance methods will be needed to detect incursions, guide program responses, and maintain freedom from these pathogens.",

For completeness, both IgG and IgA antibody ELISAs were evaluated for their ability to discriminate between PEDV-negatives and -positives in the meat juice matrix. Although the duration of detectable PEDV antibodies in meat juice specimens has not been described, Bjustrom-Kraft et al.

In this study, even though the broad test diagnostic sensitivity and specificity were reported due to number of the animals, these ELISAs were found to be highly diagnostically specific and sufficiently diagnostically sensitive at the individual pig level to be useful in surveillance. The results of this study suggest that a cutoff of S/P \u2265 0.5 would be appropriate for surveillance using either the IgG or IgA meat juice ELISAs (Table 1 ). This cutoff intentionally maximizes diagnostic specificity at the cost of sensitivity because false positive results quickly undermine confidence in the surveillance program. The shortcoming of a lower probability of detection (diagnostic sensitivity of~90%) is offset by the fact that most individuals in PEDV-positive populations are infected. Furthermore, the availability of both IgG and IgA PEDV meat juice ELISAs would provide for screening and confirmatory assays based on different antibody isotypes. Given these advantages, this approach should be given consideration if the industry elects to intensify efforts to monitor and/or control PEDV. Sample-to-positive (S/P) = (sample ODblank well control mean OD)/(positive control mean ODblank well control mean OD) Fig. 2 The association between serum and meat juice S/P results was significant for both the PEDV IgG (a) and IgA (b) ELISAs (linear regression; p < 0.0001)",
