During the foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) outbreak in the UK in 2001, several research groups developed a range of models that were able to predict the spatio-temporal pattern of disease spread and the impact of control strategies [1, 3, 5] . The use of these models in 2001 highlighted the role that models could play in shaping policy. Since then, the infection data from the 2001 epidemic have enabled research to be carried out to predict optimal culling and vaccination strategies both for the 2001 epidemic itself and for any future FMD epidemic in the UK and elsewhere [6] [7] [8] [9] .",

In other countries where FMD is endemic, livestock movements are believed to play a significant role in disease persistence [11] . Movements of live animals are also thought to cause significant transmission of diseases such as bovine tuberculosis (bTB) in the UK [12, 13] , as well as vector-borne diseases such as trypanosomiasis in southeast Asia, Australasia and Africa [14, 15] , and Rift Valley fever in Africa [16] . In cases such as these, infected livestock may be moved prior to showing symptoms, and therefore there is a risk of long-distance spread occurring. It is therefore crucial to understand the risk of infection spread associated with livestock movements.",

            "text": "In the UK, an annual livestock census records the location and species composition of all livestock farms. Births, deaths and movements of animals are recorded for individual cattle via the Cattle Tracing System (CTS), and for batches of other livestock via the Animal Movement Licence scheme. Such data have driven the development of sophisticated models to capture and predict the spread of livestock diseases such as FMD [1, 8, 17, 18] , bovine tuberculosis [12, 19] and Escherichia coli [20] . However, many countries around the world do not routinely collect farm-level data, or they are not readily available for research owing to issues regarding privacy. For example, in the USA, the National Agricultural Statistics Service carries out an agricultural census every 5 years. In order to preserve anonymity for farmers, all data are aggregated at the county level, and therefore precise locations of livestock farms are unknown. Furthermore, movement data are held at the individual state level, and there is no requirement for livestock movements to be recorded unless movements are out of state [21] . In the UK, the poultry industry infers movements between holdings using targeted sampling of premises based upon their function and size. This method predominantly targets large farms, and therefore does not accurately capture the demographic characteristics of the underlying farm population [22] . Therefore, it is important to understand the ability of models to predict the potential for disease spread through livestock movements when only a partial sample of the network is available.",

While the amount of data available to modellers is increasing, so too are privacy concerns. In order to predict the risk of disease spread in humans across large spatial scales, detailed movement networks must be established. These networks can be informed using commuting and migration data available from population censuses [23] [24] [25] . These data capture long-term trends, but may not be appropriate at predicting movements over a shorter time scale, and therefore can be complemented by the inclusion of other information such as mobile phone data. Mobile phone records track locations and times that individuals make and receive calls, and therefore can act as a proxy for shorter-scale movement patterns [23, 26] . While full access to these datasets is not readily available, previous work indicates that partial samples may be sufficient to accurately predict the risk associated with disease spread across these networks [24, 27] .",

Different approaches can be applied to construct contact networks. The most basic methods involve random sampling of nodes (i.e. individuals or farms [28] ) or random sampling of edges (i.e. links between nodes). However, it may be possible to capture the key properties of a network more efficiently using an approach such as snowball sampling (SBS). SBS is typically used in situations where the target population is small and hard to find. A number of individuals from the target population are asked to nominate an x number of people from the target population [29] . This method has been used previously to identify networks of sexual contacts for HIV-positive individuals [30] . In the case of livestock, when there may be knowledge regarding the size of farms or number of aggregated movements from a farm ( per year), a targeted sampling approach could be used where larger farms or farms with the highest number of movements are sampled. When constructing networks, including specific network characteristics (such as age structure) improves the quality of the constructed network [31] . Previous studies have shown that subsets of networks are not always representative of the whole network (e.g. scale-free networks [28] ). Therefore, caution is needed when networks are constructed with partial data.",

In the UK, selling and buying of livestock often takes place through livestock markets. Previous work suggests that these markets played a substantial role during the 2001 FMD outbreak [10] . As animals from different farms are kept in close proximity, there is a risk of disease transmission between batches of animals resulting in spread of infection to multiple farms.

If the largest of these components is of the same order as the complete network it is known as the giant strongly connected component (GSCC) and gives a lower bound to the maximum size of an outbreak on the network if the disease is perfectly transmissible [33] . In addition, we explore the impact of the sampling schemes upon the mean and standard deviation of the weighted w and unweighted k degree of nodes in the GSCC. Finally, we investigate the tendency for similar nodes to connect to each other through degree assortativity [40, 41] . These statistics are averaged over 1000 realizations of the network for each sampling method. The diameter of the GSCC was also measured but, owing to extensive computational time, this was only calculated for a single realization of the network. The diameter of a network is the length of the longest shortest path across the network [40] .

This allows us to construct networks that include markets as nodes. The above-listed sampling schemes can all be applied to this situation. There is significant uncertainty regarding the level of contact of animals from different batches (farms) on a market, and therefore the risk of transmission between animals during their stay on the market. For this reason, we investigate the effect of two extreme assumptions of transmission within a market (electronic supplementary material, figure S3 ). In the first scenario, we assume no within-market transmission, such that infection is only transmitted between the source and the destination farm. We assume complete segregation between herds being strictly enforced (this would be equivalent to having no markets in the network). In the second scenario, we assume no segregation and no biosecurity at rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org Proc. R. Soc. B 282: 20150205 a market, such that all batches that move through a market mix with one another homogeneously. In this case, we use the CTS data to determine which batches of cattle move through a market. When an infected batch moves to a market, that market becomes infected and we then assume that infection can be transmitted to all possible destination farms (as determined based on the destinations of all batches that move from the market) with an equal probability.

As the infectious period of the disease increases, a higher percentage of nodes needs to be sampled, but the effect of this is less pronounced than a variation in the transmission rate (electronic supplementary material, figures S14 and S15). For diseases with a very high transmission rate, a much higher percentage of nodes must be sampled for all methods, even when the infectious period is short (electronic supplementary material, figure S16). When we include within-market transmission into our model, we observe significantly larger epidemic sizes, with the mean epidemic size after one infectious period when b \u00bc 1 and T \u00bc 21 being 2266 farms for outbreaks seeded in Cumbria. The TNS and SBS methods under-predict epidemic sizes when less than 35% and 50% respectively of the nodes are sampled (electronic supplementary material, figure S7 ).

An alternative strategy to collect movement data would be to randomly sample movements from any farm (i.e. the RMS method). In a practical sense, this would be a much more difficult strategy to implement, requiring individual farmers to keep a record of livestock moving from their farm a given percentage of the time. This method is found to be more effective than the RNS method, particularly in the case when within-market transmission occurs. In that case, only 10-20% of movements are required in order to accurately predict epidemic sizes. For lower percentages, the model predicts smaller epidemics than observed using the true network data, and in that case suggested intervention strategies may not be sufficient to control outbreaks. It may, however, be possible to make accurate predictions with a lower percentage of movement data when incorporating a Bayesian kernel approach to scale up a partially observed network [43] . An alternative approach may be to adopt targeted movement sampling where movements would be recorded based on some criterion. For example, particularly frequent movements between pairs of nodes could be recorded, or shipments involving a large number of animals.

The results of this work provide evidence of the viability of using partially sampled data to predict disease spread in livestock [21] and humans [23] [24] [25] [26] , and will inform data collection strategies in situations where complete knowledge of the network is impossible (e.g. wildlife movements [47, 48] ).",

When markets do not contribute to disease transmission, only a very small percentage of nodes needs to be sampled using the TNS method. However, when we make the assumption that all batches on a market are well mixed, a much larger proportion of the nodes must be sampled. We also find that in this case, the RMS method requires sampling of a much smaller percentage of movements than the nonmarket scenario. This is unsurprising-markets represent very highly connected nodes in the network, and therefore when they are explicitly included in the model, an RMS approach will preferentially sample movements to and from these highly connected nodes. The model currently assumes that livestock do not stay overnight on markets, in line with Defra policy, and hence any infectious markets would become susceptible the following day. Should this not be the case, the role of markets in disease transmission may be slightly altered. Therefore, our results suggest that a more thorough, disease-specific analysis of the precise role of markets in disease transmission would be required in the future in order to determine context-specific optimal sampling strategies. However, our sensitivity analysis shows that TNS is the preferred sampling strategy for all studied transmission rates and infectious periods.",

Weighted static networks are regularly used in livestock disease models, and previous work indicates that they provide good prediction of mean epidemic sizes, though may potentially underestimate variability when compared with results on dynamic networks [38] . The advantage with a weighted static network approach is that it is possible to determine the epidemic impact independent of time of year. However, there is clear seasonality observed in the cattle movement network [49] , and it is therefore possible that a weighted static network could result in an under-or over-prediction of epidemic size. Our sensitivity analysis suggests that the preferred sampling strategies are robust, although the proportion of nodes that need to be sampled may vary dependent upon time of year. Future studies will focus upon constructing rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org Proc. R. Soc. B 282: 20150205 a dynamic network, and testing network sampling schemes and temporal sampling schemes (whereby sampling is targeted based on time of year) on their ability to predict epidemic behaviour.",

This relies on the assumption that infected movements result in all livestock on the destination farm becoming rapidly infected. This is not the case for all livestock diseases. For example, animals infected with bTB can remain asymptomatic carriers for several months [13] before becoming infectious. The model framework described here would not be appropriate for a disease of this nature, and further work will focus upon the development of optimal sampling strategies for slow-spreading diseases such as bTB, where it may be crucial to track movements of individual cattle.",

Of course, this creates something of a conundrum-in order to sample the most highly connected nodes, and thus accurately represent epidemic risk on an unknown network, one needs to know which farms have the most movements. One solution to this would be for all farmers to be required to record the number of movements they make in a given year. These summary statistics could then be used to determine which farms should be sampled for the following year. In the UK, at least, analysis of the movement network for multiple years suggests that those farms that have a high number of movements in a given year are more likely to have a high number of movements in the following year. This method may therefore be used in countries where livestock movement data are not currently available in order to inform epidemic models and predict the potential for disease spread owing to animal movements in the early stages of a disease outbreak.",
