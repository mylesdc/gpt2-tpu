            "text": "Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are conserved kinases regulating critical signaling pathways, such as apoptosis, differentiation, and immune response 1 . So far, four subgroups of MAPKs are identified, namely extracellular regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), ERK5, p38, and c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) 2, 3 . Among them, ERK1/2 is activated by growth factors and mitogens, whereas p38 and JNK respond to cellular stresses and/or environmental stimuli 2 . MAPKs are activated by kinase cascades. In particular, JNK is activated by MAPK kinases 4(MKK4) or MKK7, which are phosphorylated by upstream MAPK kinase kinases 4 . JNK activation requires dual phosphorylation of Thr and Tyr within a conserved Thr-Pro-Tyr motif 4 . Active JNK phosphorylates c-Jun and other substrates to modulate their activities 5 . For example, phosphorylated c-Jun dimerizes with other transcription factors to form activator protein-1(AP-1) complex, thereby activating transcription of target genes 6 . JNK pathway modulates apoptosis by two mechanisms: transactivation of pro-apoptotic genes and interactions with B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl2) family proteins 7 . JNKdependent activation of AP-1 upregulates expression of pro-apoptotic genes such as Bcl2 homologous antagonist killer, Fas ligand, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha 8 . Some transcription factors, such as p53 and p73, are also activated by JNK and promote cell death 9, 10 . Also, JNK can translocate into mitochondria and modulate the function of Bcl2 family proteins, such as BH3-interacting domain death agonist 11 , Bcl2-interacting mediator of cell death 12 , and Bcl2-associated death promoter 13, 14 . JNK can also directly phosphorylate Bcl2, inhibiting its anti-apoptotic activity 15 .",

Here we determined upstream MKKs of IBV-induced JNK activation and characterized its involvement in regulating IBV-induced apoptosis. We found that IBV infection activated the MKK7/JNK/c-Jun pathway in two mammalian cells (H1299 and Huh-7). IBV-induced JNK activation was mediated by MKK7, and required both its ATP binding and phosphorylation sites. We also showed that JNK-promoted apoptosis during IBV infection, and this activity was not mediated via c-Jun, but involved modulation of Bcl2. Taken together, our data demonstrate an important pro-apoptotic function of JNK during coronavirus infection.",

No phos-JNK was observed in UV-IBV control. A low level of phosphorylated c-Jun (phos-c-Jun) was detected in UV-IBV control and in early IBV-infected samples, possibly due to basal activation or nonspecific detection. A sudden increase of phos-c-Jun was observed at 16 hpi, which slowly subsided later. Total c-Jun was slightly higher at 16-24 hpi compared to early infected samples or UV-IBV control, indicating that phosphorylation may stabilize c-Jun. Total MKK4 and MKK7 remained unchanged in both IBV-infected and UV-IBV control. A basal level of phosphorylated MKK4 (phos-MKK4) was detected at 0 hpi, which gradually increased and peaked at 24 hpi. Phos-MKK4 also stably accumulated in UV-IBV control, but remained lower than infected samples of the same time point. No detectable phos-MKK7 was observed in UV-IBV control, but a drastic increase of phos-MKK7 was detected at 16 hpi, which slowly decreased, but remained high even at 24 hpi. In Huh-7 cells, IBV infection induced similar JNK phosphorylation, though phos-JNK signal was stronger and remained high even at 24 hpi (Fig. 1b) . Significant c-Jun phosphorylation was also detected in IBV-infected Huh-7 cells, but phosphorylation seemed to destabilized c-Jun, as total c-Jun reduced at 20-24 hpi. Minimum phos-MKK4 was observed, except in 24 h-infected sample. Phos-MKK7 appeared earlier at 12 hpi, but diminished faster than in H1299 cells. Phos-MKK7 could be hardly detected at 20-24 hpi, possibly also due to reduction of total MKK7. Taken together, JNK pathway was activated during IBV infection and JNK was more likely phosphorylated by MKK7 instead of MKK4. Notably, phos-JNK preceded PARP cleavage in IBV-infected cells, suggesting its potential involvement in regulating apoptosis ( Fig. 1a, b) . ",

We found that IBV-induced phosphorylation of MKK7, JNK, and c-Jun in the infected cells. Transfection of MKK7, but not MKK4, promoted IBV-induced phosphorylation of JNK and c-Jun. Using various MKK7 mutants, we showed that both ATP-binding activity and phosphorylation sites in MKK7 were required for optimal JNK activation in IBV-infected cells. Finally, gain-offunction and loss-of-function studies demonstrated that JNK phosphorylation plays a pro-apoptotic role during IBV infection. Thus, this study established a crucial involvement of JNK in regulating apoptosis induced by coronavirus infection.",

            "text": "Studies on the involvement of JNK in coronavirusinduced apoptosis are limited. In one study, JNK inhibition was found to suppress apoptosis induced by overexpression of SARS-CoV protein 6 35 . Previously we reported that hyper-phosphorylation of JNK was associated with increased apoptosis observed in IRE1knockdown cells infected with IBV 36, 37 . Here we showed that overexpression of MKK7 or constitutively active JNK-promoted IBV-induced apoptosis, while inhibition or knockdown of JNK suppressed apoptosis, further supporting the pro-apoptotic role of JNK during IBV infection. Interestingly, our data suggested that, opposite to JNK, c-Jun actually promotes survival during IBV infection. This is not totally unexpected, because under certain situations the pro-apoptotic activities of JNK was mediated independent of c-Jun 38 . For example, both vinblastine and taxol induce JNK-dependent apoptosis with similar kinetics and induce c-Jun expression, but c-Jun phosphorylation is only observed in cells treated with vinblastine, but not taxol 39 . Also, DNA damage-induced apoptosis is mainly mediated by JNK-dependent phosphorylation of p53 or p73 9, 10 . Thus, JNK-mediated apoptosis during IBV infection might also involve similar c-Jun-independent mechanisms. JNK can translocate into mitochondria and modify Bcl2 family proteins 7 . We showed that Bcl2 was upregulated in JNK-knockdown cells infected with IBV. Overexpression of Bcl2 or other anti-apoptotic Bcl2 family proteins can protects cells from coronavirus-induced apoptosis 40, 41 . However, our data showed that phosphorylation at Ser70 of Bcl2 was not essential for its anti-apoptotic function during IBV infection. Nonetheless, JNK might still mediate its pro-apoptotic function by indirectly modulating Bcl2 and/or other Bcl2 family proteins. Previous studies showed that JNK signaling is necessary for maintenance of persistent SARS-CoV infection in cells 25, 42 . Establishment of persistent infection was observed after the apoptotic events, so it is possible that JNK first serves as a pro-apoptotic protein in the acute phase of SARS-CoV infection, but switches to a pro-survival factor in persistently infected cells.",

For each well, 0.8 \u00b5g of plasmid DNA and 2 \u00b5l of Lipofectamine 2000 were each diluted with 100 \u00b5l of plain medium and incubated for 5 min. Then the diluted plasmid and transfection reagent were mixed by brief vortex and incubated for another 20 min. The H1299 cells were changed with 800 \u00b5l of medium containing 5% FBS and the transfection mixture was added to each well. The cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 6-8 h before replacing with complete medium. At 24 h post-transfection, the cells were infected with IBV at an MOI of 2 or were mock infected, and were continued to be incubated before being harvested for protein and/or RNA analysis at indicated time points.",
