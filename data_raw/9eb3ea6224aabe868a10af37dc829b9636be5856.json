Previous in vitro studies with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), performed to determine the cellular tropism of VACV, showed that recombinant VACV expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) preferentially infected professional antigen-presenting cells (APC) 9, 16, 17 . In accordance with these results, similar in vitro infection studies with rMVA expressing GFP (rMVA-GFP) also demonstrated that APC were preferentially infected, directly followed by apoptosis of these target cells [18] [19] [20] . Furthermore, to determine the tissue tropism of MVA in vivo, mice were previously inoculated via the intranasal (IN), intraperitoneal (IP) or subcutaneous (SC) route with rMVA expressing luciferase 21, 22 . In these studies, it was shown that following IN instillation rMVA-infected cells could be detected in nasal-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT), lungs and draining lymph nodes (LN) of the lungs. Following IP and SC injection, rMVA-encoded luciferase was detected in all lymphoid organs, lungs, liver and ovaries. A mouse study with rMVA-GFP demonstrated predominant infection of CD11c + dendritic cells (DC) in the spleen at 9 hour post-administration (HPA), however, in this study rMVA-GFP was administered intravenously 19 , which is not a standard immunization route. These studies focused on tissue tropism in mice, but the nature and phenotype of cells targeted by MVA in vivo in this and other, more relevant, animal models after administration via routes commonly used for vaccination, remain largely unknown.",

In addition, we compared the in vivo cell tropism of MVA after IM injection with tropism after direct delivery to the respiratory tract. We demonstrated predominant infection of CD11c + MHC class II + DC by rMVA-GFP in vitro in human PBMC and ex vivo in mouse lung explants. In vivo, rMVA-GFP was detected in both interdigitating cells in between myocytes and myocytes themselves after IM injection, whereas direct administration of rMVA-GFP to the respiratory tract led to preferential targeting of alveolar macrophages (AM) in mice and DC in non-human primates, respectively. Since GFP + cells were subsequently detected in the LN draining the site of administration, we concluded that rMVA-GFP-infected cells migrated to secondary lymphoid tissues and that direct targeting of professional APC is involved in the shaping of the immune response.",

BAL cells, WBC and single cells suspensions of lymphoid tissues obtained from ferrets were directly analysed for GFP expression by flow cytometry. By performing positive/negative scorings based on flow cytometry data (Fig. 5b) , BAL cells were consistently positive after IT inoculation and GFP + cells disseminated from the site of administration and could be detected in the ING-LN draining the hind leg muscle and trachea-bronchial (TB-)LN draining the lungs after IM injection or IT inoculation, respectively (Fig. 5b,c) . Systemic rMVA-GFP + cells were detected in both the spleen and WBC of multiple animals, however, the detection was not consistent. Low frequencies of GFP + cells were found in BAL after IM injection, potentially due to the circulation of GFP + cells in these animals (reflected by GFP + cells in PBMC). Of note, some tissues that scored positive in flow cytometry (Fig. 5b) appear negative in Fig. 5c , due to the low frequency of GFP + events.

Notably, GFP + cells were equally distributed over the different populations for BAL, WBC and splenocytes, but there was a clear preference for DC-like cells in the draining LN of the hind leg muscle or lung after IM injection or IT inoculation, respectively.

From within this plume, smaller droplets have a tendency towards deposition in the lower airways, whereas larger droplets most likely deposit in the nasal cavity and conducting airways. In order to fully characterize the aerosol and predict where in the respiratory tract rMVA-GFP may deposit, cascade impaction was performed during which the aerosol is fractioned into discrete droplet size ranges between 0.98 and 14.1 \u03bcm. Each fraction was titrated in order to determine in what size aerosol droplets viable rMVA-GFP is present (Supplementary Figure 4) . The Fine Particle Fraction (FPF) -the percentage of the rMVA particles contained in droplets under 5 \u03bcm -was calculated as 96.75% with a mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) of 1.70 \u03bcm, predicting targeting of the lower airways of non-human primates. However, through the use of a facemask interface it was ensured that the nasal cavity/upper airways were exposed to aerosol as well. Collectively, these results confirm that rMVA-GFP can be delivered to the upper and lower respiratory tract of non-human primates via aerosol inhalation. ",

            "text": "Vaccination is the cornerstone control measure to reduce morbidity and mortality caused by infectious diseases. However, vaccination against hypervariable and emerging pathogens can be challenging. For example, seasonal influenza vaccines need to be updated almost annually to antigenically match emerging drift variant viruses and to maintain vaccine efficacy. Furthermore, in case of an emerging pandemic strain of influenza virus, timely production of a pandemic influenza vaccine has proven to be challenging 27, 28 . The rapid construction of recombinant viral vaccine vectors, such as MVA, which allows easy insertion of any or multiple antigens of choice and rapid production of a large number of vaccine doses, is an attractive alternative to conventional vaccine production technology 29, 30 . In addition, MVA has been considered as vaccine delivery system for many other infectious diseases and cancers 31, 32 . Despite the increasing number of successful clinical trials performed with rMVA-based vaccines in recent years 7 , surprisingly little is known about their mode of action and the in vivo tissue and cell tropism of MVA, particularly in the ferret model, the golden standard for influenza virus pathogenesis studies, and animal models more closely related to humans such as non-human primates. This gap of knowledge could potentially hamper future registration of MVA-based vaccines for use in humans. In this study, we describe the use of rMVA-GFP, allowing detection of single rMVA-GFP infected cells with high sensitivity, to elucidate the tropism of the viral vector MVA. In vitro tropism was investigated by inoculating human PBMC with rMVA-GFP, ex vivo tropism by inoculation of mouse lung explants and in vivo tropism by inoculating three different animal species via two different administration routes. In general, myeloid cells (mainly DC and macrophages) were preferentially infected by rMVA-GFP, independent of the experimental set up, animal species or route of administration. Direct targeting of APC in mice, ferrets and non-human primates confirms the suitability of MVA as vaccine vector, since they are involved in shaping the immune response. Of note, the relation between vector tropism and vaccine immunogenicity is not always straightforward, for example optimizing DC infection by an adenovirus vector did not result in increased immunogenicity in non-human primates 33 .",

However, for the induction of protective mucosal immunity against respiratory pathogens, delivery of MVA to the respiratory tract has been considered (reviewed in ref. 37) 24, 38, 39 . In this study, rMVA-GFP was administered to the respiratory tract of non-human primates as an aerosol, as best possible proxy for future studies with MVA-based respiratory vaccines. Importantly, the aerosol droplet size and nebulizer delivery system chosen in this study allowed exposure of the entire upper and lower respiratory tract to infectious virus, allowing accurate definition of target cells (Supplementary Figure 4) . Furthermore, aerosol delivery is under extensive investigation as an alternative for vaccine delivery by injection, as it abolishes the necessity for hypodermic needles. This facilitates safety of large-scale vaccination campaigns in developing countries with high prevalence of blood-borne infections, as there is no need for a complicated infrastructure to dispose of potentially contaminated needles. Finally, direct administration of vaccines to the respiratory tract could lead to efficient induction of local immune responses leading to increased protection from respiratory pathogens. This has been evaluated extensively with a live-attenuated influenza vaccine administered IN to children (FluMist \u00ae ), showing that nasal spray administration led to efficient induction of local mucosal IgA antibody responses 38, 40, 41 . Similar advantages potentially exist when rMVA is used as live vaccine against respiratory pathogens and could lead to the induction of local humoral and cellular immune responses (tissue-resident T-lymphocytes) 39, 42 .",

            "text": "In summary, we are the first to comprehensively examine the tropism of MVA in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo in different species. Preferential targeting of APCs by rMVA-GFP was demonstrated in vivo in each animal model, regardless of the route of administration. Furthermore, delivery of rMVA-GFP to the respiratory tract of non-human primates as an aerosol also resulted in infection of local epithelial cells and IM injection resulted in infection of myocytes. In mice, AM were preferentially infected over DC which was opposite in the case of non-human primates. Of interest, preferential targeting of DC over AM would be an advantage for a vector-based vaccine, as AM are notoriously inefficient APC in comparison to DC [43] [44] [45] [46] . As a proxy for the sequence of events after vaccination of humans with MVA, the non-human primate data show that directly after administration, MVA infects local APC, which in the case of aerosol delivery were CD11c + MHC class II + DC in the lung. These rMVA-GFP + DC subsequently migrate to the draining LN, where they can present antigens via both MHC class I and II to responder cells, leading to an efficient shaping of the immune response (reviewed in ref. 47) 48 . Previously, it was shown that infection of DC with MVA induced their maturation, potentially forming the basis of direct and cross-presentation of MVA-encoded antigens by HLA class I and II 18 . Whether rMVA-GFP-infected APC present antigens to responder cells directly, or via uptake of antigen by other DC for MHC class II-and cross-presentation, was not examined in this study. Data obtained in this study show that direct targeting of professional APC could explain the excellent immunogenicity of MVA-based vaccines. Knowledge on targeting of specific cell types by MVA could guide future vaccine design and delivery strategies.",

Animal welfare was observed on a daily basis and to minimize animal suffering all animal handling was performed under light anaesthesia using 4% isoflurane in oxygen (mice) or a mixture of 10 mg/kg ketamine and 0,05 mg/kg medetomidine (ferrets and non-human primates). To antagonize the effect of medetomidine, atipamezole was administered after handling. Generation of rMVA-GFP. rMVA-GFP was generated by homologous recombination as described previously 49 . Briefly, MVA clonal isolate F6 1 served as the parental virus for generating rMVA-GFP. Vector plasmid pG06-P11-GFP was used to direct insertion of GFP coding sequences under the transcriptional control of the natural VACV late promotor P11 into the deletion III site in the MVA genome. Virus stocks were generated in CEF, purified by ultracentrifugation through 36% sucrose and reconstituted in a 120 mM NaCl 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4). Titre of the rMVA-GFP stock was determined by plaque assay on CEF and the construct was validated by PCR, nucleotide sequencing and transgene expression in various cell types.",

To determine whether rMVA-GFP-infected cells migrated to the draining LN, the inguinal LN (ING-LN, draining the hind leg muscle) or mediastinal LN (MED-LN, draining the chest) was examined for presence of GFP + cells after IM injection or IN instillation, respectively. As internal negative control the axillary (AX-LN) draining the front leg muscle (after IM injection) or ING-LN (after IN instillation) were used.To determine whether rMVA-GFP could be detected systemically, blood and spleen samples were analysed for the presence of GFP + cells.After IM injection, GFP + cells were detected in single cell suspensions of the draining ING-LN as early as 6 HPA, mainly in mice that received the highest dose (10 9 PFU) rMVA-GFP. GFP + cells were hardly detected at later time-points and were never observed in the control AX-LN(Fig. 4a, left panel). Notably, GFP + cells were also detected systemically; in white blood cells (WBC) and single cell suspensions of the spleen at 6 and 24 HPA(Fig. 4a). After IN instillation of rMVA-GFP, low numbers of GFP + cells were detected in the MED-LN at all time-points, but not in the control ING-LN(Fig. 4b, left panel). Similar to IM rMVA-GFP injection, GFP + cells were detected systemically in WBC and spleen after IN instillation(Fig. 4b). Collectively, these data illustrate that both after IM injection and IN instillation, GFP + cells can be detected in the LN draining the site of inoculation and systemically.",
