We study, by means of a mathematical model and bifurcation analysis, conditions under which the wild-type and mutant viruses, which compete for the same host cells, can coexist. The coexistence conditions are formulated in terms of the basic reproductive numbers of the strains, a maximum value of the mutation rate and the virulence of the pathogens. The analysis reveals that parameter space can be divided into five regions, each with distinct dynamics, that are organized around degenerate Bogdanov-Takens and zero-Hopf bifurcations, the latter of which gives rise to a curve of transcritical bifurcations of periodic orbits. These results provide new insights into the conditions by which viral populations may contain multiple coexisting strains in a stable manner. environmental changes such as new host species, the presence of antiviral drugs, new transmission routes or to new vectors [1]. This tremendous evolvability, coupled with densely populated animal and plant susceptible hosts (in many cases lacking genetic variability for resistance to infection), are the reasons for the persistence and emergence of new viral diseases or the re-emergence of new strains with novel properties of already known diseases. The continuous emergence of new mutants leads to an overlap in existence of wild-type (hereafter referred to as wt) and mutant genotypes of the same virus within individual infected hosts [2, 3] . This cloud of mutants is usually known as a viral quasi-species [1] and it constitutes the target of selection, instead of the individual viral genomes. This reservoir of coexisting genetic variants may lead to the emergence of new genotypes with different host ranges, pathologies and epidemiological properties that may result in outbreaks [4, 5] .",

In the present article, we introduce mutation into a mathematical model in a similar way although avoiding forceful restrictions put upon mutant strains and allowing the mutant virus to have similar characteristics to the wt virus. The difference between mutant and wt strains occurs when focusing the study on specific phenotypic characteristics. A number of studies employ fitness to investigate the survival of a population in dynamical systems that present competition or coexistence [22 -24]. As an accumulative property resulting from various phenotypic traits, fitness is a convenient measure of the overall success of the population. In the case of virus evolution, fitness can be considered proportional to the infection rate of the virus [25 -27], and measured by the infection rate when other parameters are fixed. It is known that infection rates differ between strains, a fact which has significant implications for the evolution of virulence and strain coexistence in nature [28] . Even the balance between genetic diversity and competition is believed to be achieved due to the possibility of coexistence among strains with differences in infection rates [29] . In other words, a direct competition for infecting available cells mediates the stable coexistence only when competitive abilities in viral clones satisfy certain pairwise asymmetries [30] .",

The evolution of virulence has received great attention from theoreticians, particularly on the coevolution between resistance and virulence traits and their combined effect on host and virus dynamics [32, 33] . However, understanding the evolution of virulence for coexisting viral strains still requires attention due to the complexity of the underlying evolutionary and dynamical processes, being inherently nonlinear. Many of the models brought forward to explain the evolution of virulence take into consideration the processes of coinfection and superinfection [34 -37], where the host or the host cell is infected simultaneously by more than one pathogen particle (coinfection) or sequentially by different pathogens (superinfection). Here, infection of a cell will be modelled with virions of a single strain and superinfection will be neglected. The benefit of this approach is that analytical insights into coexistence of viral strains can be obtained.",

Nearly all mathematical models in epidemiology detecting various dynamical behaviours with multi-strain infections illustrate the necessity of numerical approaches and the dependency of such models on a large number of parameters [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] . A classical approach used in epidemiology [44] to circumvent this difficulty is to introduce dimensionless parameter groups, such as the basic reproduction number R 0 , as in [45] . However, the number of dimensionless groups can still become large as additional complexity is introduced into the model, as is the case here. Thus, we perform a bifurcation analysis to systematically track how the dynamics of the system change as multiple parameters are varied. In general, the study of parameters in terms of their effect on the stability of certain states of a model is a highly effective way to gain important insights into the investigated system [46] [47] [48] .",

The model is based on a nonlinear system of five ordinary differential equations. The state variables of the model are: uninfected susceptible cells, x; two different virus strains, given by the wt (z w ) and the mutant (z m ) species; and two types of infected cells, one infected by the wt strain, y w , and another one infected by the mutant strains, y m (figure 1). The time evolution of the interacting populations is described with the following model: . Schematic diagram of the processes included in the mathematical model for the main system investigated, which does not consider backward mutations. The system is composed of two pathogenic strains: wild-type (variable z w ) and mutant (variable z m ) species, that compete for the infection of healthy cells (variable x, green cells). Infection of healthy cells gives rise to two different populations of infected cells with wt (variable y w ) and mutant (variable y m ) strains, displayed by red and blue cells, respectively. Viral strains are assumed to grow and mutate (dashed lines) within the cells, being released again to the system for further infection after cell lysis. The terms in model (2.1) are labelled with the biological processes. The meaning of these processes as well as of the parameters is discussed in the following lines. The uninfected host cells, which are limited by the carrying capacity of their environment, K, proliferate and die proportionally to parameters b and d, respectively.",

Mathematical and statistical models of multiple infections, coinfection and superinfection have been studied in detail [49] [50] [51] [52] and are not considered here. Acknowledging the importance of differences between lytic and lysogenic infection cycles in the production of virions, yet unlike [53] [54] [55] , we consider only lytic infections, i.e. the populations of infected cells do not grow as uninfected cells do [56] . In fact, the model is based on the same assumptions of the classic Lotka-Volterra equations, which were adapted to virus dynamics by Nowak & May [57] and many others [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] . In the study of coexistence of viral populations, the main role of infected cells is viewed in the scope of the processes of the lytic cycle, i.e. a direct impact in change and production of free virions. Viruses replicate and produce their own type of virions via infected cells. Strains can change and mutations occur only during the process of viral replication inside an infected cell (see dashed arrow in figure 1 ). Therefore, cells from population y w infected by the wt strain can mutate at rate m into cells of population y m . That would increase the size of the latter population at the same rate m. We note that our analyses are mainly developed considering mutations from the wt to the mutant strains. This is a standard strategy to keep the model as simple as possible, assuming that the probability of backward mutations is extremely small due to the enormous size of the sequence space. However, some results considering backward mutations will also be presented. While considering mutation in infected cells, we implicitly study the mutation of the viral genomes. It is clear that infection affects the life-span of infected cells in a nontrivial way [63] . In this study, the virulence of the strains is depicted by including new decay mechanisms for the uninfected cells. However, for simplicity, we consider death rates of infected cells to be g m and g w , and as opposed to d \u00fe Dg m and d \u00fe Dg w .",

Therefore, the overall number of virions produced in one lytic cycle must be proportional to the virulence and the number of virions produced by a single-infected cell, the latter of which we refer to as the burst size. We average the burst sizes of viral strains and consider them as constants k m and k w for mutant-and wt-infected cells, respectively. Au contraire, the infection from the perspective of the virus is associated with an average number of virions spent to ensure a successful infection process. Owing to the absence of co-infection by different strains in our model, this number can be considered as the multiplicity of infection of the viral strain. We take the multiplicity of infections to be constants n m and n w for mutant and wt strains, respectively. In this model, we assume that populations are not being harvested, but do consider a decay of all the populations in the system. In the case of the virus populations, this decrease is described as an outflow or 'death' of free virus particles from the system.

The non-dimensional burst size k is simply the ratio of the wt and mutant burst sizes. Both multiplicity of infections are scaled with respect to the burst size of the mutant strain.

In particular, our analysis reveals that a curve of global transcritical bifurcations of POs (TPO bifurcation) emanates from the DZH point rather than a curve of torus bifurcations [66] . A TPO bifurcation occurs when an unstable PO and a stable PO collide with each other in a non-destructive way (differently from what would happen in a saddle-node bifurcation of POs, with destruction of POs), and subsequently exchange stability.

Blue and orange lines denote equilibria that exist in biologically meaningful and non-meaningful phase space, respectively. The parametric dependence of the population of uninfected cell population x is used as this is the only component that differs between all four equilibria. Figure 3a shows, for the case a w \u00bc 0. When the infection rate of wt virus is increased to a w \u00bc 2, the virus-free and coexistence states undergo a transcritical bifurcation. Consequently, the bifurcation diagram in figure 3b shows that for mutant-type infection rates given by a m , 0.86, the coexistence state v 3 is stable whereas the virus-free state v 1 is unstable. This implies that Region I (v 1 stable) is replaced by Region III (v 3 stable). Although v 1 and v 2 undergo a transcritical bifurcation at a m \u00bc 0.44, there is no exchange of stability. Instead, it is v 2 and v 3 which exchange stability through a transcritical bifurcation at a m \u00bc 0.86, corresponding to the case of equal basic reproduction numbers, R m 0 \u00bc R w 0 \u00bc 1:93.

Thus, we can eliminate from figure 4a the biologically irrelevant curves of transcritical bifurcations emerging from the DBT point in order to obtain the boundaries between Regions I, II and III shown in figure 4b. The DZH bifurcation occurs at the simultaneous intersection of two curves of Hopf bifurcations associated with v 2 and v 3 and the curve of transcritical bifurcations involving v 2 and v 3 . As predicted from linear stability analysis, the Hopf bifurcation curve associated with the wt-free state v 2 does not depend on the infection rate of the wt virus a w and thus appears as a straight line given by a m \u00bc 1.55. Emanating from the DZH point is a curve of TPO bifurcations. To better understand the dynamics that occur near the DZH point, one-dimensional bifurcation diagrams are obtained by setting a w \u00bc 8 and treating a m as a bifurcation parameter and then setting a m \u00bc 2 and treating a w as the bifurcation parameter. The resulting diagrams are shown in figure 5 , with open circles denoting unstable POs. Figure 5a shows that as a m is increased from zero when a w \u00bc 8, the wt-free state v 2 first undergoes a transcritical bifurcation with the virus-free state v 1 , then a subcritical Hopf bifurcation, and finally a transcritical bifurcation with the coexistent state v 3 . None of these bifurcations change the stability of the equilibria. Thus, the associated curves of transcritical and Hopf bifurcations in figure 4a do not represent boundaries between the five characteristic regions and are not shown in figure 4b. For these infection rates, all of the equilibria are unstable and the dynamics are therefore determined by the stability of POs. For sufficiently small values of a m , the system is in Region V, and there is a stable PO around the coexistence state v 3 . This PO is created by the Hopf bifurcation that defines the boundary between Regions III and V shown in figure 4b. As a m is increased, the unstable POs around the wt-free state v 2 that emerge from the subcritical Hopf bifurcation grow in size. Eventually, this unstable PO collides and exchanges stability with the stable PO around v 3 through a TPO bifurcation at a m \u00bc 2.3972. During the TPO bifurcation, the stable and biologically meaningful PO around v 3 becomes unstable and some components enter negative phase space. Afterwards, the PO around the wt-free state is stable and the system is in Region IV.",

These experiments focused on studying the behaviour of a newly emerging mutant in a population of a few strains of bacteria that compete with each other in a spatially homogeneous environment for the same type of nutrients. The results of the competition experiments demonstrate that in the vast majority of cases, the competitors stably coexist in steady or periodic states, which align with the outcome of our theoretical model. When even a slight change is possible in the genome, new mutations will appear. However, if all the other characteristics of an initial and a mutant population are the same, then, for both populations to persist, the initial population must have larger fitness than a mutant population.

From the definition of R m 0 given by (3.9) , we see that the basic reproduction number of the mutant is independent of the virulence. Thus, changes in g m or g w cannot increase R m 0 beyond one. Therefore, Regions II and IV, where the mutant-type virus persists at the expense of the wt virus becoming extinct, cannot be entered. The basic reproduction number for the wt virus given by (3.8) is an increasing function of the virulence of the wt virus. In the limit of very large virulence, g w ! 1, we find that R w 0 ! a w (k \u00c0 n w )=z w . Thus, if the infection rate a w is so small that the limit of R w 0 is less than one, then it will not be possible to leave Region I and both strains of the virus will always become extinct. However, if a w is sufficiently large and the basic reproduction number increases beyond one, then a change in dynamics will be observed as g w is increased.

Thus, the transition between Regions II and III appears as the vertical dashed line in figure 6b .

These transitions occur via supercritical Hopf bifurcations, denoted by solid lines.

Greater values of a m lead to increases in the area of Region IV under Region II. The stability diagrams of figure 6 indicate the impact of virulence on the complexity of the dynamics. Clearly, the virulence of the mutant strain does not affect the survival of the wt strain. That is, increases in g m do not lead to an appearance or disappearance of the wt strain. However, the survival of the mutant strain does not appear to depend on g m either. Importantly, the virulence of the wt strain, g w , strongly controls the dynamics and the persistence of the wt strain. As can be seen for small values of g w , this strain can become extinct as shown in figure 6b. In other words, even for a superior infection rate of the wt viral strain, there is a threshold of g w that must be surpassed in order for this strain to exist. For inferior values that are below this threshold, the survival of the wt strain is impossible because the rate of wt virion production, i.e. the death of rate infected cells, is insufficient. The qualitative behaviour of solutions, i.e. whether the populations of wt strains undergo oscillations or stabilize to a certain value, depends on the virulence in a non-trivial way. As shown in figure 6b, there is an interval of values for g w for which the system has a stable PO governing the coexistence of strains, marked as Region V. Outside of this interval, the populations reach stable stationary states.",

Hence, equation (3.18) defines a critical, finite mutation rate at which coexistence no longer becomes possible due to extinction of the wt virus due to the outcompetition by the mutant strains. To explore this in more detail, we have repeated the stability diagram shown in figure 4b using a value of m \u00bc 0.5 . m c . The stability diagram changes drastically, becoming that shown in figure 7b , and contains only three regions: I, II and IV. The stability diagrams in figure 4b and 7b are linked through the fact that as the mutation rate increases, the DBT bifurcation shifts to the right, eventually tending to infinity as the critical value is approached. Finally, figure 7c,d illustrates how the equilibrium populations of infected cells and viral strains change with increasing mutation rate m. Specifically, we have used a w \u00bc 3.0 and a m \u00bc 1.0, along with the parameters in (3.12), in both panels. As m increases beyond the point where (3.17) is satisfied, the population of mutants (virions and infected cells) outcompetes the wt populations ( figure 7c,d) . This phenomenon is similar to the error threshold defined in quasi-species theory.

Furthermore, the DBT and the DZH bifurcations have vanished, the latter of which implies that the curve of TPO bifurcations no longer exists either. The vertical and horizontal lines of transcritical bifurcations defined by R w 0 \u00bc 1 and R m 0 \u00bc 1, which intersected at right angles in figure 4a , have now merged into two separate branches that do not intersect. The curves of Hopf bifurcations, which also intersected in the case of uni-directional mutation, have also merged into two distinct non-intersecting branches. Finally, the transcritical bifurcation between the wt-free and coexistent states v 2 and v 3 has vanished as well. The resulting stability diagram, shown in figure 8 by patterns, is now considerably simpler and involves only analogues of Regions I, III and V. Thus, the only virus-persistent states are those in which both virus strains coexist. The wt-free state can no longer occur due to the creation of the wt virus through backwards mutation.",

            "text": "In this paper, we studied a mathematical model of population dynamics of two viral strains infecting a population of the same cell type. Unlike previous models of parasite-host-like interaction, we consider the emergence of a second strain by mutation from a single strain introduced into the environment. The mechanism of virus replication forces the consideration of two types of infected cells, one for each viral strain, in the model. We analysed the system of differential equations and its solutions. By studying parameters space, we identified five different regions, each characterized by distinct dynamics: (Region I) the virus-free state which maximizes the population of host cells, (Region II) the stationary existence of mutant virus with nonzero cell populations supporting it, (Region III) the stationary persistence of both viral strains with nonzero cell populations, (Region IV) the oscillating existence of the mutant virus and corresponding cell populations but extinct wt virus population, and finally, (Region V) the oscillating coexistence of all populations. The population of the mutant-type virus exists as long as the mutation rate of the wt strain is positive. The broken symmetry between the wt and mutant strains is clear from the stability diagrams based on infection rates. From our results, we observe that survival of the wt virus is essential for coexistence. However, the growth of the wt virus population jeopardizes its persistence in the system by creating its own competitor: the mutant-type virus. Moreover, the larger the mutation rate, the greater the infection rate of the original wt strain should be in order to remain in the system. Interestingly, we have found a maximum-critical value-of the mutation rate in the context of the model which allows for the persistence of the wt strain and hence coexistence. Values of the mutation rate that are higher than the critical value make coexistence impossible even for the most infectious wt strain. Furthermore, our model shows that the concept of the error threshold may not be considered as a one-parameter-driven effect, i.e. based solely on the mutation rate [69, 70] . The critical value of mutation is shown here to be proportional to the virulence and burst size of the wt virus and proportionally inverse to its multiplicity of infection. Hence, our results extend the phenomenon of the error threshold at the infected cell population level.",

The quantities b 0 and b 1 in equations (A 1) play the role of bifurcation parameters, with b 0 \u00bc b 1 \u00bc 0 corresponding to the BT point. The bifurcation diagram of system (A 1) consists of curves of saddle-node and Hopf bifurcations, neither of which were detected in the local analysis of the model analysed in this article (2.4) near the BT point, as well as curves of global bifurcations involving homoclinic orbits. The procedure outlined by Kuzetnsov [72] enables the normal form coefficients to be related to the model studied here. Remarkably, the coefficient a 2 can be calculated analytically and is found to be equal to zero for all parameter combinations. Thus, the BT bifurcation occurring in our model is always degenerate and the local dynamics will be different from those of equation (A 1). The vanishing of a 2 can be rationalized in terms of the number of equilibria at the degenerate Bogdanov-Takens (DBT) point. An equilibrium analysis shows that (A 1) will only have two equilibria at the DBT point b 0 \u00bc b 1 \u00bc 0 if a 2 = 0; however, the model under study has three. Thus, a 2 \u00bc 0 is needed to capture the triple equilibrium at the DBT point in our model. This also suggests that higher-order terms must be included in (A 1) in order for it to capture the DBT bifurcation in the model investigated here. While an extended system of normal form equations for degenerate BT bifurcations is proposed in Kuznetsov [72] , it cannot capture the transcritical bifurcations found in the original model, suggesting that an alternative form is required. However, due to the simple nature of the local dynamics near the degenerate BT point shown in figure 2 , which can be obtained analytically from the full model (2.4), we do not pursue this point further.",

Analyses of the normal form equations for the ZH bifurcation show that local dynamics depend on the values of the normal form coefficients H ijk and G ijk . A common feature between the various cases is that the ZH bifurcation occurs at the tangential intersection of curves of saddle-node and Hopf bifurcations. However, figure 4a shows that the zero-Hopf bifurcation in our model lies at a transversal intersection of curves of transcritical and Hopf bifurcations. Furthermore, none of the normal forms predict that a curve of TPO bifurcations should emanate from a ZH point. The calculation of the three normal form coefficients for the DZH bifurcation is rather involved and must be performed numerically. We find that the normal form coefficient G 011 (0) \u00bc 0 across a range of parameter values, indicating the ZH bifurcation is degenerate. The normal form equations for degenerate ZH bifurcations are not well known and previous studies have focused on different cases [73, 74] . Tigan et al. [75] showed that a degenerate ZH bifurcation with G 011 (0) \u00bc 0 occurs in a R\u00f6 ssler-type system and used averaging theory to detect periodic orbits, leaving the structure of global bifurcations unresolved. We believe, as far as we know, that this is the first time a curve of TPO bifurcations has been observed to emanate from a degenerate ZH bifurcation of this type. We leave determining the corresponding normal form as an interesting area of future work.",

This is possible because the local structure of a bifurcation is model independent and thus can be immediately determined from pre-existing analyses of simpler systems of equations. The simplest system of equations that completely captures the dynamics of a particular bifurcation is called the normal form. The conducted numerical studies on the system (2.4) revealed that the Bogdanov-Takens and zero-Hopf bifurcations are non-standard in the sense that the local dynamics do not agree with those predicted by their normal forms. Such a mismatch can occur when one of the terms in the normal form equations vanishes due to its coefficient being equal to zero, implying that an extended system of equations needs to be considered. We now examine the normal forms of the Bogdanov-Takens (BT) and zero-Hopf (ZH) bifurcations in order to rationalize the discrepancies between the two-dimensional bifurcation diagram shown in figure 4 and those predicted from normal form theory.The local bifurcation diagram near a BT point can be determined from the normal form equations given by (e.g. Kuznetsov [66, \u00a78.4])",
