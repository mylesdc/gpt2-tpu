AMP can be inhibited by linear pentapeptides isolated from Microcystis aeruginosa LTPNA08 (MG7XX). Porcine AMP inhibition-a model for human AMP-activity was spectrophotometrically measured by the formation of p-nitroanilide from L-leucine-p-nitroanilide substrate by AMP. AMP inhibition by MG770 exhibited comparable inhibition levels to amastatin (IC 50 values: 1.20 \u00b1 0.1 \u00b5M and 0.98 \u00b1 0.1 \u00b5M, respectively), while MG756 was slightly less potent (with IC 50 values of 3.26 \u00b1 0.5 \u00b5M). Molecular modelling suggests a potential binding mode, based on the interaction with the Zn 2+ cofactor, where MG770 s extra methyl group contributes to the disturbance of the Zn 2+ cofactor complex and highlights the importance of hydrophobicity for the site.

The first step involves proton abstraction from the water molecule, coordinated with the catalytic Zn 2+ and stabilized Glu350 (not depicted in Figure 1 ), by the Glu384, which then allows the substrate entrance. The carbonyl oxygen of the substrate's peptide bond is activated by zinc and Tyr472, while the alpha-nitrogen is stabilized by the Ala348 main-chain oxygen, in an intermediate state.

Human and porcine AMP ectodomains share 79% of residue identity, together with the same domain architecture and dimerization pattern [2] . Human/porcine aminopeptidase proposed mechanism of action involves the peptide bond hydrolysis Starting from the free enzyme complexed with the structural water towards the activated state by a proton abduction from the water by the Glu384. Upon substrate binding the hydroxyl group nucleophilic attacks the carbonyl's carbon in the Michaelis complex leading to the formation of the tetrahedral intermediate, which then reassembles itself expelling one aminated product. The cycle closes with the expulsion of the second product from the active site allowing the entry of a new water molecule. The ionized proton from the water is highlighted in cyan along the cycle.

Furthermore, antitumor drugs, which bind to AMP site, are currently Starting from the free enzyme complexed with the structural water towards the activated state by a proton abduction from the water by the Glu384. Upon substrate binding the hydroxyl group nucleophilic attacks the carbonyl's carbon in the Michaelis complex leading to the formation of the tetrahedral intermediate, which then reassembles itself expelling one aminated product. The cycle closes with the expulsion of the second product from the active site allowing the entry of a new water molecule. The ionized proton from the water is highlighted in cyan along the cycle. Mechanism was initially proposed by [6, 7] . Dashed lines represent interactions and are for illustration purposes only, in the sense that angles and distances are not proportionally realists.",

Amastatin ligand co-crystallized with the human aminopeptidase structure (PDB ID: 4FYT, hAMP) was used as the basis for crossdocking validation. The root means square deviation (RMSD) differences between the best-scored docking pose and the ligand coordinates from the crystal were employed as initial quality criteria (1.9 \u00c5 [25] ). However, due to big conformational differences between the hAMP and pAMP, only cross-docking was not sufficient to evaluate docking quality. Therefore, the observation of important interactions, such as the distance towards the zinc ion (3.9 \u00c5), further supported the use of docking, which was also analyzed by molecular dynamics simulations. The proposed binding mode involves hydrogen bond between amastatin's hydroxyl group with the side-chain of the Glu406 residue, which is responsible for the Zn-binding domain along with His383 and His387. Based on the simulation results, we hypothesize that amastatin interaction with Glu450 could help with the initial orientation the coordination of the vicinal carbonyl/hydroxyl pair in a conformation that stably interacts the Glu406/His383/His387/Zn 2+ complex.

Amastatin ligand co-crystallized with the human aminopeptidase structure (PDB ID: 4FYT, hAMP) was used as the basis for cross-docking validation. The root means square deviation (RMSD) differences between the best-scored docking pose and the ligand coordinates from the crystal were employed as initial quality criteria (1.9 \u00c5 [25] ). However, due to big conformational differences between the hAMP and pAMP, only cross-docking was not sufficient to evaluate docking quality. Therefore, the observation of important interactions, such as the distance towards the zinc ion (3.9 \u00c5), further supported the use of docking, which was also analyzed by molecular dynamics simulations. The proposed binding mode involves hydrogen bond between amastatin's hydroxyl group with the side-chain of the Glu406 residue, which is responsible for the Zn-binding domain along with His383 and His387. Based on the simulation results, we hypothesize that amastatin interaction with Glu450 could help with the initial orientation the coordination of the vicinal carbonyl/hydroxyl pair in a conformation that stably interacts the Glu406/His383/His387/Zn 2+ complex.",

The twin tyrosine residues from microginins are longer and uncharged substituents to the double charged moieties of amastatin, it is observed that those residues are highly flexible and are not restricted to a single binding mode within the binding site ( Figures 7A and 8A , highlighting the hydrogen interaction profile), however, longer simulations would be required to understand the full effect of this in the protein dynamics. The crystal structure of hAPN (PDB ID 4FYS) co-crystallized with AngIV substrate peptide shows poorly fitting electron density and high-temperature factors for the last three amino acids (His-Pro-Phe residues and occupying the pockets P3 -P5 ), as well as for the amastatin's second amino-acid (Leu\u00dfN, PBD 4FYT); those are in line with highly disordered regions and fit to our increasingly RMSF values along the molecule ( Figure 7A ).

Nevertheless, previous structureactivity studies indicated that dityrosine C-terminus plays a key role in ACE inhibition [26] . The differences between activity between MG770 and MG756 could be attributed to the presence of a weaker interaction with the zinc ion for the ionized state of MG756. Simulations with the ionized amine state of MG756 shows increased ligand flexibility on Ahda atoms ( Figure 7A ), which would interact with the active site, but also overall binding instability. However, the same is not observed in MG770 ionized simulations. We hypothesize that the additional charge on MG756 could prevent the conjugation with Zn 2+ , despite the additional electrostatic interaction with the Glu450, which was not stable during simulations ( Figure 8E ). Furthermore, amastatin isopropyl moiety proximity with specific side-chains ( Figure 6D ) reveals a small unoccupied hydrophobic pocket composed by Phe467 and Phe893 (with distances larger than 5 \u00c5), which accommodates the larger microginin's acyl substituent ( Figure 8B ). Crystal structures of hAPN bound to AngIII-IV peptides show the substrate Figure 7 . Microginins specific moieties, when compared to amastatin (green/orange lines), have highly flexible ligand binding within the binding pocket, as noted by the high root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) average along with the short simulation (A). Lines represent the average of RMSF values, which were calculated using ligand's heavy atoms only, and compared against the initial conformation.

However, just molecular size cannot explain the differences in inhibition. Comparatively, the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition, another member of the aminopeptidase family with the similar catalytic domain and zinc ion as a cofactor, shows an inverse correlation between molecular volume and activity [29] [30] [31] . As observed by the SiteMap analyses ( Figure 3E ), the closed conformation of the pAMP active site have small contributions of hydrophobic residues and, therefore, the insertion of a methyl group (increasing hydrophobicity), could be deleterious, when not addressing proper pockets. Controversially, the amino-ionized forms of MG770 maintained stable interactions with residues around the Zn 2+ ion, whereas the MG756 equivalent does not. Recently, the work from Lodin-Friedman and Carmeli (2018) demonstrated the activity of other microginins, purified from Microcystis spp. collected from the Kishon Reservoir in Israel, against the porcine aminopeptidase M [32] . Those new microginins differ among themselves not only in terms of sequence, but also in absolute configuration of the Ahda moieties' chiral centers, and also on the N-methylation of the Ahda amine group (Ahda stands for the modified amino acid 3-amino-(2-hydroxy)-decenoid acid). They conclude that Ahda-N-methylation, and even the chlorination of the Ahda terminal methyl group, did not influence the extent of the aminopeptidase M inhibition, which is in line with our observations that apolar groups would not lead to inactivity.",

Results derived from 30 independent rounds of genetic algorithm (GA) with a precision level of 100% and poses were ranked according to the GoldScore and CHEMPLP score values. The molecular docking results were visualized to verify the interaction of polar groups with the zinc ion and accommodation of the hydrophobic acyl groups. Poses were selected by Zn 2+ interaction, however, due to the high diversity of potential binding modes, as well as poorly performing cross-docking, further validation was made necessary.

A constant temperature of 310 K was maintained throughout the simulation using the Nose-Hoover thermostat algorithm and Martyna-Tobias-Klein Barostat algorithm to maintain 1 atm of pressure, respectively. After minimization and relaxation of the system, we proceeded with a single production step of 100 ns. The representative structure was selected by clustering the structures from the RSMD values, using 1 \u00c5 as a cut-off (Supplementary material, Figure S2 represents the variation of the RMSD values along with the simulation and the RMSF variation for the protein backbone, on Figure S3 ), small RMSF variation between the simulated systems was observed, this could be justified by the short simulated time, which allows for the observation of small time-scale events, but not big protein conformational changes. In this sense, simulations were used only to validate the initial docking results and evaluate the ligand stability within the protein active site. Interactions and distances were determined using the Simulation Event Analysis pipeline implemented in Maestro (Maestro 2019v2). The current geometric criteria for protein-ligand H-bond is distance of 2.5 \u00c5 between the donor and acceptor atoms (D-H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7A); a donor angle of \u2265120 \u2022 between the donor-hydrogen-acceptor atoms (D-H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7A); and an acceptor angle of \u226590 \u2022 between the hydrogen-acceptor-bonded atom atoms (H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7A-X). Similarly, protein-water or water-ligand H-bond are a distance of 2.8 \u00c5 between the donor and acceptor atoms (D-H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7A); a donor angle of \u2265110 \u2022 between the donor-hydrogen-acceptor atoms (D-H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7A); and an acceptor angle of \u226590 \u2022 between the hydrogen-acceptor-bonded atom atoms (H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7A-X). Non-specific hydrophobic interactions are defined by hydrophobic side-chain within 3.6 \u00c5 of a ligand's aromatic or aliphatic carbons and \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions required two aromatic groups stacked face-to-face or face-to-edge, within 4.5 \u00c5 of distance.

For each concentration tested, the commercial enzyme was added and the positive control (inhibitor amastatin) was used for comparison (concentration: From 0.1 to 10 \u00b5M). The final volume at the 96-well plates was 75 \u00b5L (medium composed of 0.1 M borate buffer, Ph 8.0). After 30 min pre-incubation, 30 \u00b5L of the L-leucine-p-nitroanilide substrate at the concentration of 1.2 mM were added for the microginins AMP inhibition assays. The kinetics of inhibition of AMP were determined and the reaction interrupted with the addition of 25 \u00b5L of 30% acetic acid solution.",

Referring to ligand bound systems, average residue fluctuations obtained from root mean square deviation fluctuations (RMSD) of the pAMP backbone atoms calculated in relation to the initial simulation frame of the amastatin (B, green for protonated and C, orange line for neutral form), MG756 ionized amine form (D, blue) and neutral amine form (E, red), MG770 ionized (F, dark yellow) and neutral counterpart (G, purple), in all figures, RMSF values are compared against the ones derived from the simulation without ligand (gray line).
