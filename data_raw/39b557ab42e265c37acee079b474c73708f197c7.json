Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis revealed that apo-SsTroA binds Zn 2+ and Mn 2+ . Both metals bind to SsTroA with nanomolar affinity and stabilize the protein against thermal unfolding. Zn 2+ and Mn 2+ induce distinct conformational changes in SsTroA compared with the apo form as confirmed by both circular dichroism (CD) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra. NMR data also revealed that Zn 2+ /Mn 2+ bind to SsTroA in either the same site or an adjacent region. Finally, we found that the folding of the metal-bound protein is more compact than the corresponding apoprotein.",

In 1998 and 2005, S. suis 2 human infections, with the new disease form of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS), had been reported in China, following the outbreaks in swine stocks initially, which caused a total of 240 human infections and claimed 52 lives [4] . Our group, in collaboration with other groups, has sequenced the entire genomes of the representatives of these two virulent S. suis 2 isolates (05ZYH33 and 98HAH12) in 2007 [5] and laid the foundation for the study of the STSS-causing S. suis 2 at the molecular level to reveal its pathogenicity [1, 6, 7] .",

However, only recently have insights emerged into the metal metabolism of S. suis. The adcR gene (which encodes the regulator of the Adc operon) was isolated by divalent cation deprivation [15] . Furthermore, the extracted cell surface proteins of S. suis from mutants defective in genes regulating metal ion uptake are able to confer significant protection against S. suis 2 infection in mice [16] . Previously, we identified a global zinc-response regulator of the Zur family (zinc uptake regulator) from S. suis 2 [17] , unveiling its relationship with zinc homeostasis in this organism. Whole-genome sequence analysis led to the proposition that S. suis expresses two putative transition metal transport systems, encoded by the Adc operon [15] and Tro operon (Table S1) , consistent with the situation in many other bacterial pathogens that harbor several metal transporters.",

This protein belongs to a wellstudied family, formerly designated as cluster 9 substrate binding protein (SBP) [19] , but recently reclassified into the A-1 family of prokaryotic SBPs [20] . The SsTro operon contains five genes, an ATP-binding cassette metal transport system (troABCD) (encoding four proteins) and a transcriptional regulator (troR) (Fig. 1A) . The crystal structures of some A-1 family SBPs have been determined over the past decade. These structures include Mn-specific SBPs (e.g.,TpTroA [21] - [22] , Streptococcus pneumoniae PsaA [23] , and Synechocystis 6803 MntC [24] ), Zn-specific SBPs (e.g., S. pneumoniae AdcAII [25] , Synechocystis 6803 ZnuA [26, 27] , and S. pyogenes Lbp [28] ) and Fe-specific SBPs (Streptococcus pyogenes MtsA [29] ). They share a common structure of two (a/b) 4 domains linked by a long helix, with the metal bound at the interface between the domains. Hazlett et al. [30] and Desrosiers et al. [31] revealed that TpTroA has high binding affinity for both Zn 2+ and Mn 2+ , but Zn 2+ is considered to be the primary substrate of TpTroA [32] .",

When bound to metal, by CD spectra TpTroA does not undergo structural changes, however, T. pallidum ZnuA undergoes conformational changes when Zn 2+ is loaded [31] . Synechocystis 6803 ZnuA displays concomitantly large conformational changes in two of its three chelating histidines due to the release of Zn because it possesses two Zn binding sites [27] . However, the second binding site is absent in other transporters (e.g., TpTroA), and therefore its exact biological function remains unclear [33] . To obtain further insight into the function of SsTroA, we determined the X-ray crystal structure of the Zn 2+ -bound form of the SsTroA at a resolution of 2.6 \u00c5 , and further characterized the recombinant SsTroA. Binding of divalent metal cations to SsTroA, induces a substantial conformational reorganization to a more ordered state. Our structural and functional data reported here lay out the scenario of SsTroA participating in S. suis divalent metal homeostasis.",

The amino-terminal signal sequence of such lipoproteins is distinguishable by the presence of a lipobox motif at the signal sequence cleavage site. The conserved lipobox motif is usually characterized as L 23 -[A/S/T] 22 -[G/A] 21 -C +1 and lipid modification is achieved through a covalent linkage of a diacylglyceride to the conserved cysteine residue. Indeed, the cysteine residue is absolutely conserved in all bacterial lipoproteins [34, 35] . SsTroA contains a typical type II signal peptide for Sec-dependent transport. Its presumptive lipobox sequence is LGAC, containing the indispensible cysteine in position 30, indicating that SsTroA is not released into the environment but rather inserted into the plasma membrane via a diacylglyceryl anchor. Alignment of sequences also revealed that the metal binding site of SsTroA is very similar to Mn-specific SBPs (Fig. 1B) . These data suggested that the SsTroA should physiologically bind Mn 2+ .",

Samples collected from elution fractions were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE (Fig. S1A ) and the results show that SsTroA has a molecular mass of ,34 kDa, in consistence with the theoretical monomer molar mass of 32 kDa. An analytical FPLC SuperdexH 200 profile revealed that SsTroA exists as a mixture of monomer and dimer in solution, though mainly as a monomer (Fig. S2A) . To determine the native mass of SsTroA (unaffected by protein shape), quantitative hydrodynamic analyses were performed by analytical ultracentrifugation. Analysis of the sedimentation velocity profiles using the SEDFIT program yielded the weight average molar mass of the major peak is 31.8 kDa ( Figure S2B ), which accounts for 90% of the total protein (i.e., nearly identical to the theoretical molar mass of 32 kDa). Another peak at 62.6 kDa (6.8% of the total) is believed to correspond to dimers. The other ,3.2% of the protein has a significantly-higher sedimentation coefficient, but the amount of this subpopulation did not change significantly as a function of protein concentration. Thus, our data suggest that under the solution conditions used, a small portion of SsTroA is involved in the formation of stable complexes. This is consistent with the evidence that periplasmic SBPs exist in a monomer/dimer equilibrium, with monomers having higher affinity for the substrate [36, 37] .",

ITC measures the heat directly released or absorbed upon an interaction triggered by mixing two components, and is capable of calculating both the extent of the ligand binding affinity and the free energy values (DG) and enthalpy(DH) changes, from which entropy (DS) is determined [38] . The isotherms for loading with Zn 2+ and Mn 2+ appeared in normal sigmoidal titration curves, in agreement with our ICP-MS data. Again the binding stoichiometry (n) was determined to be ,1 in both cases (Fig. 2) , confirming that a specific 1:1 complex is formed in each case. The association constants (Ka) for each metal ion binding to SsTroA were around 10 7 M 21 (Fig. 2) . SsTroA affinities for Zn 2+ and Mn 2+ were calculated from duplicate measurements with K D s ( = 1/Ka) of 43469 nM and 254613 nM, respectively, indicating the formation of tight complexes. It should be noted that SsTroA binds Mn 2+ with a higher affinity than that of Zn 2+ . These values are of a similar magnitude to those described for binding of Zn 2+ and Mn 2+ to N. gonorrhoeae MntC [33] . In each metal ion titration with both metal ions, we observed negative enthalpy and entropy values, demonstrating that binding of each ion to SsTroA is an exothermic event. The thermodynamic profiles for metal binding by SsTroA are not identical to those previously reported for TpTroA [31] . Intrinsic metal binding to proteins is usually entropically driven (DH.0) due to the very high dehydration energies of divalent cations.

The X-band EPR spectra of Mn 2+ -SsTroA at room temperature displays a typical six-line pattern (Fig. 3A) . High-spin Mn 2+ centers typically exhibit EPR resonances with characteristic six-line splitting patterns due to hyperfine interactions between the unpaired electrons and the I = 5/2 55 Mn nucleus, indicating the binding of the Mn 2+ to the protein [42] .

Interaction of the probe with a hydrophobic site yields an enhancement of fluorescence intensity, usually accompanied by a blue shift of the maximum. SsTroA significantly enhances the emission intensity of ANS and promotes a blue shift (Fig. 3B) . Meanwhile, the fluorescence intensity of ANS clearly decreases in the metal bound form compared to the apo-SsTroA. As indicated by the diminished fluorescence, ANS displays stronger binding to Mn 2+ -SsTroA than Zn 2+ -SsTroA. The spectra clearly provide evidence that the addition of metal ions induces a large change in the nonpolarity of the ANS-binding site, and the Mn 2+ causes a greater change than Zn 2+ does.

To obtain further information on the metal sensitivity of the SsTroA and details on possible structural changes occurring upon its interaction with metal ions, we applied CD spectroscopy to monitor these processes. Proteins were prepared by incubation with Zn 2+ and Mn 2+ as previously described [31] . In the far-UV regions (Fig. 4A) , the CD spectra are generally characterized by distinct minima at 208 and 223 nm respectively, which are the features of proteins that contain a-helix conformational elements, consistent with the crystal structure data. The metal bound SsTroA samples both displayed spectra similar to apo-SsTroA, only with minor differences, though both has deeper 208 nm and 223 nm minima relative to apo-SsTroA. The intensity of the 223-nm band of SsTroA is in the order: apo-SsTroA.Zn 2+ -SsTroA.Mn 2+ -SsTroA, suggesting a decrease of the content of secondary structure in the apo form compared to the metal-bound forms. While previous work demonstrates that TpTroA does not manifest changes discernible by CD upon metal binding, in contrast, T. pallidum ZnuA does undergo conformational changes when Zn 2+ is loaded [31] . These data indicated that TpTroA and SsTroA present differential binding behaviors upon metal binding.",

As expected, thermal denaturation proceeded, as expected, with a sharp decrease in ellipticity at 223 nm at the melting temperature and a complete loss of secondary structure (Fig. 4B) . The data are fit very well to a twostate model between the folded and unfolded states. Nonetheless, the unfolding profiles are obviously different, the heat denaturation analysis revealed that the apoprotein begins to dramatically lose CD signal at 60-65uC, whereas the Zn-bound or Mn-bound protein starts to significantly lose CD signal at a temperature as high as 65-70uC. The apoprotein exhibits a half-denaturation (T m ) of 71.560.1uC, and addition of Zn 2+ and Mn 2+ significantly stabilizes SsTroA as judged by a substantial enhancement in the Tm value (DTm = 4.660.2uC and 560.1uC, respectively), which agrees with the presence of Zn 2+ or Mn 2+ as seen in CD spectroscopic changes (Fig. 4A) . These results combined with CD spectrum data imply that the ternary protein-metal complex appears to form a compact domain organization, i.e., the metalligand interactions in the SsTroA protein indeed play an important role in imparting extra stability to the metal binding site of the protein. Further, as we proposed that Mn 2+ has a more significant effect on the conformation and thermal stability of SsTroA than Zn 2+ .",

There exists difference with SBPs, specific either for zinc or manganese. In the Zn-specific ZnuAs, the metal is coordinated by 3 histidines plus a water or glutamate [44, 45] . In the case of Zn-specific AdcAII, the residues involved in Zn binding are three histidines and one glutamate [25] . This is similar to the observation in Zn-specific Lbp, the zinc ion is coordinated by the side chains of three histidines and one glutamate in a slightly distorted tetrahedral geometry [28] . In the Mn-specific SBPs (PsaA and MntC), the metal is coordinated via two hisitidine residues, the third histidine is replaced by a glutamate, and the fourth position is occupied by an aspartate [23, 24] . The coordination geometry of Zn is usually tetrahedral or distorted tetrahedral (coordination number = 4) in the protein, although the coordination number can increase to five to stabilize high-energy intermediates and their flanking transition states. In contrast, the Mn 2+ ion tends to prefer hard ligands such as the carboxylate oxygens of aspartate or glutamate, and the carboxamide oxygens of asparagine or glutamine. The nitrogen atoms of histidine imidazole groups are occasionally observed as metal ligands in Mn 2+ metalloenzymes despite their borderline hardness, the metal coordination geometry is usually square pyramidal or trigonal bipyramidal (coordination number = 5) [13] . Accordingly, our structure indicated that Mn 2+ is likely to be the natural ligand. However, despite great efforts, we failed to obtain any crystals of SsTroA containing Mn 2+ .",

Loop 1 is locateed between the b2-1 and b2-2 (refer to the TpTroA [21] topology nomenclature). The TpTroA and S. pneumoniae PsaA structures display a short loop compared to Loop 1 of SsTroA. Among the ZnuA proteins examined, this loop is longer (histidinerich) and it is proposed that this region is possibly involved in the capture of the Zn around the metal binding site or plays an important role in the process of docking with permeases [26] . Nevertheless, the significance of this loop remains unclear because there are limited experimental results to confirm these hypotheses. Regardless, it is speculated that the mobility of this loop may possess a biological function in SsTroA [26] .",

The cross peaks, still visible after incubating with Mn 2+ , belong to protons distal from the Mn 2+ binding site. By contrast, the broadening and disappearance of the cross-peak strongly indicates the involvement of the amide proton close to the Mn 2+ coordination sphere. It should be noted that almost all of the peaks in the presence of Zn 2+ and Mn 2+ have similar chemical shifts (Fig. 6C) , indicating that the protein regions adopt identical structures when bound to Zn or Mn.

One puzzling observation that was unclear until now is whether or not Zn and Mn bind to the same site in TpTroA. Nuclear spin relaxation properties of resonances from protons close to the ion-binding sites can be selectively perturbed in the presence of paramagnetic ions [50] . The unpaired electrons of Mn 2+ can interact with protons close to Mn 2+ and the effect of the strong paramagnetic interaction of the Mn cation leads to specific changes in the corresponding NMR signals, which helps to locate the Mn 2+ binding site [51] . Our NMR data demonstrated that Zn 2+ -SsTroA and Mn 2+ -SsTroA have very similar tertiary structures. Introduction of Mn induced the disappearance of some cross-peaks and the loss of intensity of others. Moreover, the binding of metal ions induces chemical shift changes for some of the cross-peaks (highlighted in circles, Fig. 6 ). However, the Zn 2+ -SsTroA and Mn 2+ -SsTroA spectra are nearly identical (except for the cross-peaks that disappear from spectrum), indicating that Zn 2+ and Mn 2+ share the adjacent binding region or even the same site in SsTroA.",

            "text": "Metal binding to the SsTroA has been proposed as a major event leading to conformational changes. From our combined NMR and ANS fluorescence data, we speculated that the metalbinding pocket of apo-SsTroA and other locally disordered folding adopts a loosely folded structure in solution. This behavior explains why metal-bound states induced the decreased ANS fluorescence intensity and changes in the NMR spectra of the metal-loaded forms. These loosely ordered structures may enhance an inducible response to the changing environmental conditions or may play a pivotal role in recognizing different divalent metal ions. In some cases, binding of a target molecule or ligand drives disordered folding to a more ordered state [52] . It should be noted that the crystallographic studies on TpTroA [21, 22] have referred to a comparatively minor folding movement upon the metal binding, and structural analysis of Escherichia coli ZnuA suggests that binding and release of Zn drive small yet significant conformational changes [45] . One explanation may be that the nature of protein in solution is shown to be more dynamic than suggested by crystal structures.",

BtuF is a periplasmic binding protein (PBP) for the vitamin B12 transporter BtuCD. BtuF and TroA are classified in the same class of SBPs, which both exhibit very little domain movement upon ligand binding [20] . The complex structure of BtuCD-BtuF revealed that the conserved glutamate residues Glu 74 and Glu 202 from BtuF form salt bridges with Arg56 residues from two BtuC subunits [55] , which are also found in other ABC importers [56] . Moreover, these salt bridges are critical for molecular interaction in vivo [56] . Intriguingly, we found that SsTroA also has two conserved glutamate residues Glu 107 and Glu 230 that are positioned on the surface of the N-terminal and C-terminal domains (Fig. 5A) . Based on the findings described above, we predicted that SsTroA docks to the periplasmic face of SsTroCD, and charged amino acid residues probably are likely involved in salt bridge formation and contribute to the interface.",

The PCR product was cloned into the BamHI/XhoI restriction sites of the pGEX-6P-1 expression vector (Amersham) to generate the pGEX-SsTroA plasmid. This construct was then transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3). E. coli cells were grown at 37uC to mid-log-phase in LB broth supplemented with 100 mg/ml ampicillin, and then SsTroA expression was induced with 1 mM isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for 4 hours at 37uC. Cultures were harvested by centrifugation, and the cells were homogenized in PBS (140 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , and 1.8 mM KH 2 PO 4 , pH 7.4) prior to sonication. The cell lysate was then centrifuged for 20 minutes at 35 000 g, the clarified supernatant was loaded onto a glutathione Sepharose 4B column (GE Healthcare) for 2 hours, and bound proteins were cleaved from the resin by incubating with PreScission Protease in accordance with the manufacturer's instruction for batch purification.

The purified protein was verified by SDS-PAGE and high purity fractions containing SsTroA were concentrated using Amicon Ultra 15 centrifugal filters (Millipore) with a 10-kDa molecular mass cut-off. Protein concentrations were determined by the BCA assay (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's protocol using bovine serum albumin as the standard. To produce uniformly 15 N-labeled SsTroA samples for NMR studies, E. coli BL21 (DE3) were grown in M9 minimal medium containing 0.1% 15 NH 4 Cl (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) as the sole source of nitrogen.

The metal and protein solutions were prepared in 20 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 6.5. Prior to experiments, the reference cell was filled with deionized water, and both metal solutions and protein solutions were clarified for 10 minutes at 16,000 g and degassed for 20 minutes to eliminate air bubbles, using the ThermoVac accessory of the microcalorimeter. Upon experimental setup, the protein solution present in the sample cell was stirred at 200 rpm. After a stable baseline was achieved the titration was initiated with 25 consecutive 10 ml injections of 500 mM Zn 2+ into the sample cell (volume = 1.5 ml) containing 90 mM apo-SsTroA,and then 200 mM Mn 2+ was injected into 30 mM apo-SsTroA. The background heat of dilution is collected by titration with buffer alone, and the integrated data were subtracted from data obtained with apo-SsTroA present. Integrated heat data obtained for Zn 2+ and Mn 2+ titrations were analyzed using the NanoAnalyze software (TA Instruments) fitting them to an independent binding model. The free energy (DG) and entropy (DS) of the binding reaction can be determined with Equations 1 and 2, respectively:",

(A) EPR spectra of Mn 2+ (100 mM) in the absence (red line) and presence (purple line) of SsTroA (100 mM) at room temperature in solution. The total Mn 2+ concentration was the same in both samples. The signal intensity decrease corresponds to the zero-field splitting arising from the disturbances in the octahedral ligand field of the bound metal. The instrument conditions are as follows: microwave power, 20 mW; microwave frequency, 9.53 GHz; modulation frequency, 100 KHz; modulation amplitude, 1 G; and modulation amplitude, 1.0 mT. (B) Fluorescence changes in the intensity emission for SsTroA indicate a metal dependent decrease in hydrophobic residue exposure. Emission spectra of ANS in the presence of different SsTroA states: apo-SsTroA (purple), Zn 2+ -SsTroA (green) and Mn 2+ -SsTroA (red). A significant enhancement in fluorescence is probed on binding of ANS to apo-SsTroA. This fluorescence is slightly diminished in the presence of metal ions, which indicates the ordering of the metal binding domain of the SsTroA structure when metal is bound. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0019510.g003",
