            "text": "IFN-a/b plays a critical role in limiting viral spread, restricting viral tropism and protecting mice from neurotropic coronavirus infection. However, the IFN-a/b dependent mechanisms underlying innate anti-viral functions within the CNS are poorly understood. The role of RNase L in viral encephalomyelitis was explored based on its functions in inhibiting translation, inducing apoptosis, and propagating the IFN-a/b pathway through RNA degradation intermediates. Infection of RNase L deficient (RL 2/2 ) mice with a sub-lethal, demyelinating mouse hepatitis virus variant revealed that the majority of mice succumbed to infection by day 12 p.i. However, RNase L deficiency did not affect overall control of infectious virus, or diminish IFN-a/b expression in the CNS. Furthermore, increased morbidity and mortality could not be attributed to altered proinflammatory signals or composition of cells infiltrating the CNS. The unique phenotype of infected RL 2/2 mice was rather manifested in earlier onset and increased severity of demyelination and axonal damage in brain stem and spinal cord without evidence for enhanced neuronal infection. Increased tissue damage coincided with sustained brain stem infection, foci of microglia infection in grey matter, and increased apoptotic cells. These data demonstrate a novel protective role for RNase L in viral induced CNS encephalomyelitis, which is not reflected in overall viral control or propagation of IFN-a/b mediated signals. Protective function is rather associated with cell type specific and regional restriction of viral replication in grey matter and ameliorated neurodegeneration and demyelination.",

Although anti-viral responses are initiated in infected cells, they act in an autocrine and paracrine fashion, antagonizing virus replication in host cells and inducing a protective anti-viral state in neighboring cells. The anti-viral state is distinguished by the expression of numerous IFN stimulated genes (ISG), which directly or indirectly interfere with both viral and host RNA transcription and translation [1] . Many of these pathways can also result in the apoptosis of infected cells [2] .

            "text": "The best characterized anti-viral mechanisms are mediated by activation of double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) and the 29-59-oligoadenylatesynthase (OAS)/ribonuclease L (RNase L) pathways [3] [4] [5] . Upon recognition of double-stranded RNA, the OAS family of proteins convert ATP into unique, unstable 29-59-A oligomers, which are bound by latent RNase L monomers, driving the dimerization and activation of RNase L. Activated RNase L cleaves single-stranded RNA, 39 of U-A and U-U sites found in both viral and cellular RNA. RNase L endoribonuclease activity is thus not limited to viral RNA, but also degrades host cell RNA, including ribosomal RNA. As OAS genes are stimulated by IFN-a/b, elevated OAS levels enhance the antiviral state in adjacent, non-infected cells responding to IFN-a/b. Nevertheless, inappropriate activation of RNase L is counterbalanced by the unstable nature of 29-59A oligomers and the endogenous RNase L inhibitor, RL1 [6] . A novel aspect of the OAS/RNase L pathway is the cleavage of host RNA releasing free 39-monophosphates that can activate the cytoplasmic RNA helicases RIG-I and Mda-5 [7] . Recognition by these pattern recognition receptors initiates IFN-b transcription, similar to the activation mediated by recognition of specific viral RNA structures. RNase L thus not only exerts anti-viral effects via RNA degradation and apoptosis, but also has the capacity to amplify and prolong expression of anti-viral genes and other ISGs.",

            "text": "The anti-viral activity of the OAS/RNase L system has been studied in several virus infections in vitro and in vivo [3, 4] . Protective mechanisms of the OAS/RNase L pathway are generally more evident for RNA relative to DNA virus infections. However, the contribution of RNase L to disease severity and viral control varies significantly depending on the virus and even virus strain studied, presumably reflecting the diverse mediators and targets of these anti-viral mediators. For example, encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) replication was only modestly increased in RNase L deficient (RL 2/2 ) mouse embryonic fibroblasts, consistent with enhanced susceptibility to infection in vivo. Although RNase L prolonged survival, mortality rates of infected RL 2/2 and control mice were similar. Furthermore, IFN-b treatment increased the survival time of infected wild-type (wt) and to a lesser extent RL 2/2 mice, indicating that alternate IFN-dependent anti-viral mechanisms act in the absence of RNase L [8] . In contrast, the requirement for RNase L activity to protect from another picornavirus, Coxsackievirus B4, was evident by significantly increased mortality rates of infected RL 2/2 compared to wt mice. However, increased mortality was not the result of uncontrolled virus replication, as virus titers were only slightly elevated within pancreatic islet cells in vivo. By contrast, pancreatic islet cells derived from RL 2/2 mice, treated with IFN-a and infected in vitro exhibited increased virus replication and loss of cellular integrity, compared to IFN-a treated RNase L sufficient cells [9] . These results revealed distinct differences in direct antiviral functions of RNase L in vitro and in vivo. Cell type specific effects of anti-viral RNase L activity are also clearly evident from studies with West Nile virus (WNV). While mouse embryonic fibroblasts display RNase L dependent anti-viral activity [10] , IFN-b treatment revealed no affect of RNase L in reducing WNV replication in either cortical or peripheral motor neurons [11] . Nevertheless, a modest effect was observed in bone marrow derived macrophages, consistent with increased viral burden in CD11b + splenocytes derived from RL 2/2 compared to wt mice [11] . Furthermore, increased mortality of RL 2/2 mice in response to peripheral WNV infection correlated with increased replication in lymphoid tissue, but not enhanced viral dissemination into the CNS. A minor role for RNase L in control of WNV in the CNS was supported by similar viral titers in brains as well as kinetics and rates of mortality following intracranial infection of RL 2/2 and wt mice. Although viral replication was only transiently increased in spinal cords of intracranially infected RL 2/2 mice, the most prominent effect was increased spread to the spleen and liver [11] . The more critical role of RNase L in limiting WNV spread in peripheral tissues rather than the CNS highlights the complexities of OAS/RNase L mediated anti-viral mechanisms in vivo.",

            "text": "IFN-a/b mediated innate responses are also essential to control virus replication and survival following coronavirus infections [12] [13] [14] [15] . Infections in vitro and in vivo induce upregulation of IFN-a/b and anti-viral mediators, including PKR and OAS [12, 16, 17] ; however, the participation of these pathways in the anti-viral response to CNS infection has not been elucidated. In vitro, the dual liver and neurotropic MHV-A59 strain does not elicit degradation of 18S and 28S ribosomal RNA, suggesting the absence of RNase L activation in HELA cells [18] . However, administration of an RNase L agonist inhibited replication of the hepatotropic MHV-3 strain in peritoneal macrophages in vitro and in liver in vivo [19] . Nevertheless, reduced viral replication via RNase L function in vivo was insufficient to prevent liver necrosis and death. The nonlethal gliotropic JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV-JHM) replicates exclusively in the CNS following intracranial infection and is controlled by both innate and adaptive responses [20, 21] . CNS infection results in a non-lethal encephalitis with immune-mediated demyelination resulting in hind limb paralysis [21] . Based on expanded tropism to hippocampal neurons and widespread dissemination within the CNS of mice deficient in IFN-a/b signalling (IFNAR 2/2 ) [12] , the gliotropic MHV-JHM variant was used to probe an anti-viral role of RNase L within the CNS. While the vast majority of wt mice survived, RL 2/2 mice succumbed to infection, albeit delayed compared to IFNAR 2/2 mice. Although enhanced morbidity suggested a prominent role of RNase L in anti-viral protection, the absence of RNase L neither diminished overall virus control in the CNS, nor enhanced neuronal infection. Furthermore, RL 2/2 mice did not reveal any impairment in IFN-a/b induction, alterations in proinflammatory cytokines or inflammation compared to wt mice. These data rather reveal a novel role of RNase L in specifically counteracting focal microglia/macrophage infection, thus potentially sustaining microglia mediated neuroprotective effects and ameliorating demyelination.",

To elucidate the role of RNase L in CNS pathogenesis, gliotropic MHV-JHM infection was examined in RL 2/2 mice [8] . Increased susceptibility of RL 2/2 mice was evident by more severe clinical symptoms of acute encephalitis at 9-11 days post infection (p.i.) (Fig. 1, top panel) . With the exception of increased severity, onset and progression of clinical symptoms in infected RL 2/2 were similar to those exhibited by infected wt mice. These included initial symptoms of acute viral encephalitis, including: lethargy, dehydration and weight loss, which progressed to diminished hind limb function. Furthermore, mortality rates were significantly higher in RL 2/2 mice, with over 90% succumbing to infection by 12 days p.i.

            "text": "Initial spread of viruses is controlled by type I interferon induced antiviral molecules. Early intervention with viral replication is especially critical in central nervous system infections to reduce loss of non-renewable cells and mitigate immune pathology. One of the best characterized anti-viral mechanisms is mediated by ribonuclease L (RNase L). RNase L exerts activity at multiple levels, including degradation of viral and host RNA, induction of apoptosis, and propagation of the IFN-a/b pathway. Recent studies suggest that RNase L antiviral activity is dependent on the virus, as well as the cell type and tissue infected. This study demonstrates that RNase L protects mice infected with a sub-lethal, demyelinating neurotropic coronavirus by ameliorating encephalitis and morbidity, albeit without affecting control of infectious virus or IFN-a/ b expression. RNase L specifically protected the brain stem from sustained infection and prevented spread of virus to microglia/macrophages located in spinal cord grey matter. The subtle regional alteration in tropism in the absence of RNase L coincided with increased apoptotic cells and earlier onset as well as increased severity of axonal damage and demyelination. The results demonstrate how subtle regional alterations in viral tropism within the CNS may severely affect the balance between neuroprotection and neurotoxicity mediated by microglia/macrophages. significant changes of infectious virus in brains of RL 2/2 , compared to wt mice. Virus titers were increased less than 0.5 log 10 in RL 2/2 mice (Fig. 1, bottom panel) . Very modest anti-viral RNase L activity in the CNS was confirmed by analysis of viral RNA from CNS tissue. Levels of viral mRNA encoding the viral nucleocapsid protein were increased less than 2.4-fold in spinal cords of RL 2/2 compared to wt mice at any time point (Table 1) .",

However, IFN-a and IFN-b expression levels were slightly increased, rather than decreased in brains of MHV-JHM infected RL 2/2 mice relative to wt mice (Fig. 2) . Furthermore, OAS-2, IFIT-1, IFIT-2, and IRF-7, representing prominently activated ISGs, were induced to similar, or modestly increased levels in the CNS of infected RL 2/2 mice. Slightly enhanced IFN-a/b and ISG expression was also observed in spinal cords from infected RL 2/2 relative to wt mice (data not shown). Consistent with similar virus replication and control in the CNS, neither IFN-a/b nor the expression of downstream ISGs were impaired at the tissue level.

To assure that altered pathogenesis was not due to differential inflammatory responses, the CNS was examined for extent, composition and localization of infiltrating cells. Characterization of cells recruited to the CNS using flow cytometry revealed similar total numbers of infiltrating cells and no alterations in their composition (Fig. 3 ). Unlike IFNAR 2/2 mice [12] , neutrophil infiltration was not affected in RL 2/2 mice and macrophages comprised the most prominent population early p.i. in both strains. CD4 + and CD8 + T cells peaked to nearly identical numbers at day 7 p.i. in both groups. Furthermore, CNS infiltrating CD8 + T cells in both groups were comprised of 50% and 60% virus specific cells at day 7 and 10 pi, respectively, as monitored by D b /S510 class I tetramer staining [23] . Similarly, no significant differences in the extent of inflammatory cells were observed by histochemical analysis (data not shown).

MHV-JHM initially infects ependymal cells and spreads to astrocytes, microglia/macrophages and predominantly oligodendrocytes, but rarely infects neurons [24] . However, MHV-JHM induced mortality in the absence of IFN-a/b signalling is associated with a dramatically expanded virus tropism to hippocampal neurons [12] . To assess the possibility that RNase L exerts cell type dependent anti-viral effects not apparent from whole tissue homogenates, the distribution of virus infected cells was analysed by immunohistochemistry. Sequential analysis demonstrated a limited infection of neurons within the brain with a predominance in the brain stem at day 5 p.i. in both RL 2/2 and wt mice (Fig. 4) . Glia tropism prevailed in both groups and overall distribution of virus infected cells was similar with occasional neurons still infected at day 7 p.i. (data not shown). By day 10 p.i. virus infected cells declined in cortex and brain stem of both wt and RL 2/2 mice. However, in contrast to wt mice which had cleared virus from brain stem, virus infected cells were sustained in the brain stem of RL 2/2 mice and were predominantly microglial in appearance (Fig. 4) . The overall extent and distribution of viral infected cells was thus similar during peak virus replication in brains of RL 2/2 and wt mice, with the exception of sustained infection in brain stem in the absence of RNase L. Preliminary experiments indicate that these cells are microglia or macrophage/ monocytes (see below). These data contrast with the infection of IFNAR 2/2 mice [12] which show predominant neuronal infection. Therefore, preferential infection of neurons could not account for the increased mortality in RL 2/2 mice. The data also indicated that protective RNase L functions are not overtly reflected in early anti-viral activity but are manifested in region specific protection.",

Furthermore, IFNa/b mediated activation of RNase L also induces apoptosis in non-infected cells [8] . During MHV-JHM infection of wt mice the majority of apoptotic cells are lymphocytes [26] , which are not targets of infection. Although oligodendrocyte apoptosis has been linked to the demyelinating process, the demonstration of apoptotic oligodendrocytes during MHV-JHM infection has been elusive [27, 28] . The retention of virus infected cells in brain stem may result in enhanced local T cell activation and apoptosis of either T cells, infected cells, or both. Therefore, the frequency of apoptotic cells was examined at day 10 p.i. In contrast to the brain stems of wt mice which contained few apoptotic cells, apoptotic cells were prominent in brain stems of RL 2/2 mice (Fig. 4 ) coincident with retention of virus infected cells. Although increased focal virus infection associated with substantially increased apoptotic cells presumably dysregulates neuronal function and potentiates tissue damage, there was no evidence that apoptotic cells are preferentially located adjacent to neurons.",

The morbidity in MHV-JHM infected RL 2/2 mice also coincided temporally with the onset of acute primary demyelination in wt mice. RL 2/2 mice were thus examined for enhanced tissue pathology and demyelination. Brain stems of infected wt mice revealed minimal demyelination by day 10 p.i. (Fig. 5 ). By contrast, demyelination was more severe in brain stems of RL 2/2 mice, correlating with increased numbers of virus infected as well as apoptotic cells. Demyelination is associated with a variable degree of axonal damage [29, 30] . Primary immune mediated demyelination in the spinal cord during MHV-JHM infection coincides with early axonal degeneration [31, 32] . While axons were largely intact in brain stems of wt mice, axonal integrity within demyelinated lesions was severely compromised in RL 2/2 mice as indicated by a striking decrease in neurofilament and an increase in dystrophic axons within lesions (Fig. 5) .",

Increased demyelination in spinal cords has been correlated with the extent of white and grey matter infection in mice infected with heterologous MHV strains [33] . Furthermore increased apoptosis, specifically in spinal cord grey matter of RL 2/2 mice supported grey matter infection. Increased demyelination as well as apoptosis in grey matter in RL 2/2 mice thus prompted a more detailed investigation of viral antigen distribution in spinal cords, where the demarcation between grey and white matter is linear as opposed to the more complex organization of brain stem. Neuronal infection was not observed in spinal cords of either RL 2/2 or wt mice. Furthermore, the number of infected cells with oligodendrocyte morphology in the white matter of RL 2/2 mice was similar to wt mice at day 7 p.i. (Fig. 8) . However, a prominent difference in viral antigen positive cells was noted in spinal cord grey matter. RL 2/2 mice harboured several foci of infected cells with microglia morphology, whereas viral antigen positive cells were rarely observed in spinal cord grey matter of wt mice (Fig. 8) . Furthermore, a large number of infected cells in the grey matter of RL 2/2 mice were identified as microglia and/or infiltrating monocytes based on co-localization with Iba-1 positive cells (Fig. 9 ). Foci of Iba-1 positive cells co-expressing viral antigen in the grey matter were only observed in RL 2/2 but not wt mice, confirming results obtained by immunohistochemistry (Fig. 8) . Nevertheless, infected Iba-1 positive cells were dispersed throughout the white matter of wt and RL 2/2 mice. Similar characterization of the brain stem at day 10 p.i. also identified Iba -1 positive cells as prominent cells harbouring sustained viral infection (data not shown). Co-stains with the astrocyte specific marker GFAP showed no evidence of infected astrocytes in spinal cord grey matter; astrocytes were also only rarely infected in white matter of wt and RL 2/2 mice (data not shown). These data indicate that RNase L mediated antiviral function acts specifically in microglia and/or monocytes. Moreover the focal nature of infection in grey matter suggests microglia localization is associated with enhanced susceptibility to infection in the absence of RNase L.",

However, viral mRNA levels decreased in both cell types reaching comparable levels by day 10 p.i. While RNA levels for TNF were elevated in RNase L deficient microglia and monocytes by 2-fold and 1.4 fold, respectively, iNOS levels remained similar relative to wt derived cells (data not shown). IFNc relative to GAPDH mRNA levels in spinal cord were also modestly increased from 4.660.5 in wt mice to 8.160.3 in RL 2/2 mice at the peak (day 7 p.i.) and declined to 1.460.4 and 1.260.1, respectively, by day 10 p.i., confirming a modest contribution of proinflammatory cytokines to pathogenesis.

Furthermore, the limited extent of increased focal glial infection appeared insufficient to mediate the pathological effect. To assess potential differences in the overall activation state of microglia, the distribution and morphology of Iba-1 positive cells was assessed in spinal cord grey matter. Microglia in wt mice were activated as demonstrated by their intense staining and ramified phenotype and localized in close proximity to neuronal cell bodies (Fig. 10) . By contrast, in infected RL 2/2 mice, fewer microglia were activated based on their Iba-1 staining and morphology and did not show preferential association with neurons. Whether the absence of RNase L itself or infection of microglia mitigates a neuroprotective function of microglia remains to be explored. The notion that inflammatory insults disrupt neuroprotective functions by microglia is based on microglia mediated neuroprotection in models of injury and LPS preconditioning [34] [35] [36] and loss of protection following viral infection [37] .",

Nevertheless, the in vivo anti-viral effector mechanisms contributing to innate viral control remain poorly understood. The best characterized pathways are mediated by activation of PKR and RNase L [3] [4] [5] . However, in contrast to the conclusive effects of PKR and RNase L deficiency on viral replication in vitro, in vivo studies demonstrate more subtle anti-viral effects [8, 9, 11] . During WNV infection, RNase L deficiency is manifested in profoundly altered morbidity, despite similar viral control after footpad inoculation [11] . IFN-a/b-mediated anti-viral responses are also critical for controlling spread of neurotropic coronavirus within glial cell populations and preventing infection of neurons [12] . Based on its activation by numerous RNA viruses, RNase L was investigated as a prototypical anti-viral effector molecule in controlling MHV-JHM virus replication in the CNS.",

For example, RNase L contributes to IFN-a/b mediated apoptosis, as well as homeostasis of thymocytes and splenocytes in young na\u00efve mice [8] . RNase L deficiency also delays tissue graft rejection [22] implicating a defect in T cell function or trafficking. Nevertheless, both histochemical and flow cytometric analysis revealed a similar extent and composition of inflammatory cells in the CNS of infected RL 2/2 and wt mice. The lack of RNase L mediated alterations in T cells was supported by similar peripheral expansion of virus-specific CD8 T cells and kinetics of viral control. Increased morbidity could thus not readily be attributed to altered inflammation or pro-inflammatory signals at the tissue level.",

No evidence for enhanced neuronal infection in RL 2/2 mice thus suggested that the IFN-a/b mediated anti-viral mechanisms in neurons are RNase L independent. This contrasts with a protective role for RNase L in inhibiting HSV-1 replication in neurons of IFN-b treated trigeminal ganglia [41] , and supports virus specific susceptibilities to innate anti-viral immunity. Distinguishing features in MHV-JHM infected RL 2/2 mice are the sustained areas of microglia infection in brain stem and focal areas of infected microglia within the spinal cord grey matter. Infected cells in spinal cord grey matter are also evident in SCID [42] and IFNAR 2/2 mice (unpublished observation) following infection with the gliotropic MHV-JHM. In RL 2/2 mice the prominent infected cells in brain stem and spinal cord grey matter were identified as Iba-1 positive microglia or infiltrating monocytes, which cannot readily be distinguished by immunohistochemistry. Nevertheless the morphology of infected cells in the grey matter was consistent with activated microglia, rather than the monocyte/macrophages with dense cytoplasm found prominently in demyelinating lesions. Furthermore, preferential microglia infection was supported by a relatively greater increase of viral RNA in microglia relative to monocytes, when comparing RL 2/2 versus wt mice. The prominent location of Iba-1 positive cells in grey matter of RL 2/2 mice could not be attributed to the absence of activated microglia in grey matter of wt mice. In fact, microglia in wt mice exhibited a more ramified phenotype surrounding neurons compared to microglia in RL 2/2 infected mice. It remains unclear whether abrogation of the proximal localization of microglia to neurons in RL 2/2 spinal cords reflects an unknown function of an RNase L enhanced neuroprotective effect, or altered function due to infection.",

Preliminary analysis showed no co-localization of activated caspase 3 and Iba-1 (data not shown). Overall, the neurologic disability and morbidity of the infected RL 2/2 mice appears to result from axonal or neural degeneration, independent of neuronal infection in both brain stem and spinal cord. The enhanced demyelination phenotype is thus distinct from demyelination attributed to enhanced white matter infection by recombinant neuronotropic MHV variants [33] . RNase L deficiency and infection of microglia may contribute to this pathology in several ways. Infection in the absence of RNase L may impair neuroprotective effects exerted by microglia under inflammatory conditions [34] [35] [36] . Alternatively, enhanced infection of microglia may increase proinflammatory responses resulting not only in enhanced recruitment of T cells and monocytes, but also increased local production of neurotoxic factors such as TNF, nitric oxide, oxidative radicals, and matrix metalloproteases. However, only modest increases in IFNc mRNA in spinal cord, as well as minor differences in TNF and iNOS mRNA in microglia/monocytes suggest these effects may only be apparent at a focal level. Increased localized T cell effector function, manifested in release of perforin and granzymes, has also been shown to contribute to axonal injury without affecting demyelination [30] . Lastly, RNase L deficient and/or infected microglia may perturb normal microglia functions in maintaining neuronal health as indicated by disruption of neuronal autophagy by SIV infected microglia [37] . It thus remains to be determined to what extent accelerated and more severe pathology is due to disruption of the neuroprotective functions of microglia and/or from overt activation due to infected cells [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] . Independent of a pathogenic effect, it is interesting to note that the absence of RNase L also enhanced macrophage susceptibility to WNV infection [11] . Whether this reflects differential activation of OAS enzymes or participation of other pattern recognition receptors such as Mda-5 in susceptible cell types in vivo remains to be elucidated.",

Although RNase L did not play an overt anti-viral role as measured by viral replication, it did provide specific protection from focal infection of microglia/macrophages in the CNS. RNase L was not crucial in protecting neurons from infection and played no obvious role in protecting oligodendrocytes or astrocytes. Furthermore, RNase L deficiency did not alter proinflammatory responses, diminish IFNa/b mediated signals, or dampen adaptive immune mediators. The results rather uncover how subtle local alterations in viral tropism may affect the balance between neuroprotection and neurotoxicity mediated by microglia/macrophages.",
