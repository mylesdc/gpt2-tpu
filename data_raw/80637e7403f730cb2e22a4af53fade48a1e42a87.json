Real-time TaqMan RT-PCR, western blot analysis and plaque assays were carried out to evaluate specific viral inhibition by the siRNAs. Results: Transfection of rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cells with siRNAs targeting the EV71 genomic 5 0 UTR significantly delayed and alleviated the cytopathic effects of EV71 infection, increased cell viability in EV71-infected RD cells. The inhibitory effect on EV71 replication was sequence-specific and dosage-dependent, with significant corresponding decreases in viral RNA, VP1 protein and viral titer. Appropriate 2 0 -modified siRNAs exhibited similar RNA interference (RNAi) activity with dramatically increased serum stability in comparison with unmodified counterparts.",

            "text": "The selection of appropriate siRNA targets is a critical initial step in the development of antiviral RNAi therapeutics. Successful siRNA designs must be based on the conserved sequences of the viral genome. EV71 is a small, non-enveloped, positive single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the genus Enterovirus within the family Picornaviridae. Like all picornavirus, EV71 genome possesses a conserved 5 0 untranslated region (UTR) of approximately 740 nucleotides (nt) [23, 24] . The 5 0 UTR of EV71 is involved in key steps of the viral life cycle, including replication and translation [25, 26] . Due to its high degree of conservation which renders it less likely to mutate and functional importance for viral replication, the 5 0 UTR of the EV71 genome is an attractive target region for siRNA therapeutic treatment. In both cell cultures and animal experiments, RNAi in the form of chemically synthesized siRNA or plasmid-derived shRNA has been used to effectively inhibit EV71 infection, revealing several potential target sequences within the 3 0 UTR, VP1, 3D, 3C, and 2C regions of the EV71 genome [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] . However, the higher order structure of the EV71 genomic 5 0 UTR makes targeting of this region especially challenging. To date, no effective siRNAs targeting the conserved 5 0 UTR of the EV71 genome have been reported.",

Identification of effective target sequences within the highly conserved 5 0 UTR and optimization of siRNA properties by 2 0 -OMe or 2 0 -F modification for future in vivo applications were considered primary objectives. Direct in vitro evaluation explored the effectiveness of siRNAs targeting the 5 0 UTR of the EV71 genome in inhibiting viral replication. Meanwhile, we observed good compatibility of the introduction of appropriate 2 0 -OMe or 2 0 -F modifications into the siRNA duplexes, which maintained high antiviral activities. Enhanced serum stability was confirmed as a major advantage of the 2 0 -modified siRNAs in comparison with unmodified counterparts. These strategies may ultimately lead to the development of appropriate chemically modified siRNAs against clinical EV71 infection.",

The siRNA screening procedure was primarily based on a combination of RNA target accessibility prediction, siRNA duplex thermodynamic properties, and empirical design rules [32] using the web-based tools (http://sfold. wadsworth.org/cgi-bin/sirna.pl and http://www.genebee. msu.su/services/rna2_reduced.html). The nucleotide identities between siRNA targeting sequences in HM003207.1 and corresponding sequences in other EV71 China strains available in GenBank were also considered by using the cluster alignment function of the DNAStar (DNAStar, Inc., Madison, WI, USA) software. Specifically identified sequences were subjected to analysis by the BLAST algorithm (www.ncbi.nlm.nih. gov/BLAST) to exclude homology in both human and mouse genomes. Unmodified siRNAs targeting the 115-133 nt sequence and the 648-666 nt sequence of 5 0 UTR that satisfied the above criteria were designated as si-1 and si-2. Subsequently, si-1 and si-2 were chemically modified by 2 0 -OMe or 2 0 -F at U and C sequences on complementary strands. The 2 0 -modified siRNAs were designated as si-1OMe, si-1 F, si-2OMe, and si-2 F. A scrambled sequence with the same base composition as si-2 and no sequence homology to the viral genome was designed as a negative control. In addition, FAM-labeled si-2 was synthesized with the label on the 5 0 end of the sense strand, designated as si-2FAM. The siRNA sequences are listed in Table 1 . All siRNAs were synthesized by Genepharma Co. Ltd., Shanghai, China.",

The 2 0modified si-2OMe and si-2 F were also fairly efficient in reducing EV71 RNA transcripts. EV71 RNA transcript levels declined to 16.56 \u00b1 1.99% and 6.22 \u00b1 1.85% with 50 nM and 100 nM of si-2OMe, respectively, and 17.63 \u00b1 2.45% and 7.02 \u00b1 1.38% with 50 nM and 100 nM of si-2 F, respectively (Figure 4 ). When the RD cells were treated with si-1 and si-1 F, the levels of EV71 RNA transcripts were found to be, respectively, 29.72 \u00b1 1.72%, 29.72 \u00b1 3.16% (50 nM) and 17.64 \u00b1 2.03%, 18.34 \u00b1 1.55% (100 nM) (Figure 4 ). In contrast, 2 0 -modified si-1OMe was not as effective as unmodified si-1, as there was only a slight reduction in EV71 RNA transcripts compared with the mock transfection control (Figure 4) . The inhibitory effects of the siRNAs targeting the EV71 genome were shown to be sequence-specific, as reductions in EV71 RNA transcripts were observed to be negligible in RD cells transfected with 100 nM of nonspecific scrambled siRNA (Figure 4) .",

Transfection of RD cells with unmodified (si-1, si-2) and 2 0 -modified (si-1 F, si-2OMe, or si-2 F) siRNAs effectively deceased progeny virus yield, resulting in significant reductions in plaque formation in RD cell monolayers compared with those of the mock transfection control ( Figure 6A) .

Previous studies have shown that EV71 for its survival and replication developed a defense mechanism that could not only eliminate the innate interferon immune response but also weaken the effect of exogenous interferon treatment. The 3C protein of EV71 inhibits retinoid acid-inducible gene I-mediated interferon regulatory factor 3 activation and type I interferon responses [33] . EV71 suppresses Toll-like receptor 3-mediated type I interferon responses by down-regulation of Toll/ interleukin-1 receptor domain-containing adaptor inducing beta interferon (TRIF) [34] . EV71 also antagonizes type I interferon signaling by reducing the level of interferon receptor 1 [35] . Traditional interferon therapy, which has been successfully applied to many viruses, showed only weak anti-EV71 activities and is not suitable for the treatment of EV71 infections [35, 36] . Given the limitations of current therapies for EV71 infections, our attention was drawn to the developing RNAi research field. In this study, unmodified and 2 0 -modified siRNAs were designed to target the highly conserved 5 0 UTR of the EV71 genome to inhibit EV71 infection in vitro. When compared with EV71 China strain genomes available in GenBank in the previous 5 years, siRNAs targeting the 115-133 nt sequence of the EV71 genomic 5 0 UTR indicated the rates of sequences with complete nucleotide coincidence reached about 71.30%, while the siRNAs targeting the 648-666 nt sequence of the EV71 genomic 5 0 UTR showed the rates of sequences with complete nucleotide coincidence (37.04%) and those with the same single-nucleotide difference (41.66%) together reached about 79.70% (Additional file 2: Table S1 ).

The inhibitory effects against EV71 replication were sequence-specific and dosagedependent, resulting in significant decreases in viral RNA, VP1 protein and viral titer. The most effective inhibition was observed for the siRNAs (si-2, si-2OMe, and si-2 F) targeting the 648-666 nt sequence of the 5 0 UTR of the EV71 genome, followed by the siRNAs (si-1 and si-1 F) targeting the 115-133 nt sequence of the 5 0 UTR of the EV71 genome. It is likely that variations in efficiency are primarily due to differences in positional accessibility of respective target sequences.

The results were consistent with previous studies of siRNAs targeting the 5 0 UTR of other RNA viruses such as hepatitis C virus [37, 38] and coxsackievirus B3 [20] . These studies demonstrated that siRNAs targeting the 5' UTR of the viral genome can exert significant antiviral activity. However, siRNAs targeting the highly conserved 5 0 UTR of the poliovirus genome failed to inhibit virus replication [39] . It is possible that some siRNAs cannot efficiently hybridize to target sequences of the viral 5 0 UTR due to complex secondary structure or protein interactions with RNA motifs that may occlude the target sequences. Thus, the secondary structure of target RNA is an important factor in selecting a suitable target sequence, as it can have a negative effect on RNAi efficiency [40, 41] .",

It was found that 2 0 -modified si-1 F, si-2OMe and si-2 F manifested similar RNAi activity in comparison with unmodified counterparts. The cells transfected with si-2OMe and si-2 F targeting the sequence of nt 648-666 within the 5 0 UTR of the EV71 genome had better RNAi activity than si-1 F targeting the sequence of nt 115-133 within the 5 0 UTR of the EV71 genome. The results indicated that the RNAi activity of 2 0 -modified siRNAs can be determined based on the primary sequence of the siRNAs. It is worth noting that the 2 0 -modified si-1OMe showed significantly decrease in antivirus activity compared with unmodified counterparts. It is not clear why the patterns of 2 0 -OMe modifications work for one sequence but not for another. Perhaps the introduction of 2 0 -OMe modifications into the si-1 alters the thermostability of the duplex that could interfere with the activity of siRNA.

Morphological changes in RD cells were observed with phase-contrast microscopy at different time points. At 24 h post-infection, the mock transfection cells and scrambled siRNA transfected cells exhibited CPE, characterized by increased shrinkage and refraction, in contrast with non-infected normal cells. Meanwhile, no CPE was observed by microscopic examination in EV71infected cells transfected with either unmodified (si-1, si-2) or 2 0 -modified (si-1 F, si-2OMe, si-2 F) siRNAs; however, cells transfected with si-1OMe showed slight CPE. At 36 h post-infection, cells transfected with 50 nM of si-1 or si-1 F showed slight CPE. At 48 h postinfection, cells transfected with si-2, si-2OMe, or si-2 F showed slight CPE, whereas mock transfection cells, scrambled siRNA transfected cells, and si-1OMe transfected cells showed complete CPE, characterized by shrinkage, enhanced refraction, rounding up, and detachment from the culture plate (Figure 3A). The siR-NAs (si-2, si-2OMe, and si-2 F) targeting the 648-666 nt sequence of the EV71 genomic 5 0 UTR conferred a remarkable level of resistance to infection, thus delaying CPE in EV71-infected RD cells up to 48 h post-infection. These inhibitory effects lasted up to 72 h post-infection. The viral inhibitory effect of siRNAs (si-1 and si-1 F) targeting the 115-133 nt sequence of the EV71 genomic 5 0 UTR was also evident in RD cells, delaying CPE for up to 36 h post-infection.
