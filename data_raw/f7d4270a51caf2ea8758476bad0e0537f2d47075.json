Also, [even though] vaccine produced domestically is free, one should not take it, especially, the Encephalitis B vaccine and the Hepatitis A vaccine.\" This post expressed the lack of consumer's confidence in China-made health-related products. Two posts in our dataset on Jan 13, 2012 were re-posts of this post. Each of them included the microblogger's own comments. One wrote, \"What can we do? The humble poor people cannot afford imported products.\" Another wrote, \"For the sake of the kids, switch!\" This is an example showing that the mistrust of certain healthcare products (including vaccines) by many Chinese citizens should be understood as part of a general mistrust of the quality control of Chinese products from infant formulas to vaccines. There was also a Weibo post (and one re-post) that provided a link to a Tudou (the Chinese equivalent of YouTube) video that was a news program. The first part of the news program was about a hepatitis B virus carrier trying to promote the knowledge of the proper routes of transmission of hepatitis B, by asking passersby to kiss her hand. She waited for 10 minutes before a passersby was willing to do so (Video: http://t.cn/zO2SiRy). According to the reporter, personnel from the Communist Committee of Zijin County tried to offer bribes to cover it up. After being rejected by the reporter, they tried to block the article to appear in print via various means (see Weibo post in the Table below) . Eventually, after two months, the news article finally went in print and the news was covered by major newspapers in China, including the People's Daily. Weibo posts of news articles about this outbreak were then re-posted by many (n=92). Summary: Of the 11 Weibo posts that mentioned \"poliomyelitis\" on December 15, 2012, seven mentioned a so-called \"World Strengthened Immunity Day\". What is written in Chinese as \"Strengthened Immunity Day\" is known as National Immunization Days (NIDs) or supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) in WHO's parlance. This is intended to supplementnot replaceroutine immunization. National Immunization Days are conducted in two rounds, one month apart (see reference: http://www.polioeradication.org/Aboutus/Strategy/Supplementaryimmunization.aspx, accessed June 9, 2014). In mainland China, the National Immunization Day was conducted on December 5 and January 5.",

They also wanted to share their experience. They did so by re-posting the original post. The fact that certain famous writers (and Weibo opinion leaders) commented on the incident further amplified the original \"signal\". In October 2012, ACIP recommended all pregnancy women to receive Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis) 3-in-1 vaccine among pregnancy women. A Chinese hospital took the opportunity to emphasize that this recommendation was also practiced by them. It is interesting to note that CDC statistics about the resurgence of pertussis cases in the US was quoted directly from the CDC press release. However, the Weibo quote did not mention that the case count statistics was for the US only. * Note: Even though the same keyword \u6dcb\u75c5 appear in the posts, the words here actually mean something entirely different from gonorrhea. This is an example that nuances in language may reduce the specificity of our detection methods. Figure S28 . Summary: There were 207 Weibo posts containing the keyword for \"syphilis\" (\u6885\u6bd2) on August 4, 2012. Of these, 168 were related to a case of denial civil servant employment due to a positive syphilis test. Tang Haiqing ranked number one for a Chinese government position that she applied. Unfortunately, she was repeatedly tested positive for syphilis in hospitals specified by the authorities. However, when she sought independent tests from other hospitals, she was found negative. She posted her negative results online and was rebutted by her Communist Party superior.",

Vinegar can kill the common cold virus hidden in the nasopharynx. During an influenza epidemic, using vinegar as nose drops has a reliable preventive effect. * Our keyword search picked up 16 posts that were not related to influenza.

According to a newspaper report (The Beijing News, August 23, 2012: http://epaper.bjnews.com.cn/html/2012-08/23/content_366619.htm?div=-1), Mr. ZHANG Liang (\u5f20\u4eae), who travelled to Africa frequently on business trips, was infected with malaria and had severe complications. He received treatment in a hospital in Beijing. Due to his severe conditions, his 5-day treatment plan involved a transfusion of 4000cc of blood plasma each day, which required 8000cc of blood of type AB. (According to a Weibo post, the severe malaria led organ failure and a loss of liver function and blood transfusion was used to maintain life (not cure); see: http://www.weibo.com/2923373595/yz6T3oBYM?mod=weibotime; accessed June 10, 2014). Based on a rate of blood donation of 200cc per head per donation, Mr. Zhang's 5-day treatment plan requires 200 blood donors of blood type AB. In order to recruit enough blood donors, his wife wrote a Weibo post on August 15, 2012, asking for help, in the hope that enough blood donors will visit the Beijing Red Cross blood center to donate blood. The post was circulated on the internet for a week. By August 23, the Beijing News reported that blood donors had successfully donated 250 units of 200cc of blood for Mr. Zhang. However, at the end, the patient died on August 25, 2012, leaving behind a widow and two orphans (Weibo post released by his family or friends: http://www.weibo.com/1407255042/yyNx8fflv; accessed June 10, 2014). This was a case of using Weibo to recruit blood donors in a short period of time (one week) to try to save one individual's life.",
