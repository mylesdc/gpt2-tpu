Previous work showed that IL-12 reversed Treg-mediated suppression of CD4 + Foxp3 2 T cell (Tconv) proliferation. We and others have also shown that Tregs express T-bet and IFN-c at sites of Th1 inflammation and that IL-12 induces IFN-c production by Tregs in vitro. To investigate whether loss of immunosuppression occurs when IFN-c is expressed by Tregs we treated mouse lymphocyte cultures with IL-12. IFN-c expression did not decrease the ability of Tregs to suppress Tconv proliferation. Rather, IL-12 treatment decreased Treg frequency and Foxp3 levels in Tregs. We further showed that IL-12 increased IL-2R expression on Tconv and CD8 T cells, diminished its expression on Tregs and decreased IL-2 production by Tconv and CD8 T cells. Together, these IL-12 mediated changes favored the outgrowth of non-Tregs. Additionally, we showed that treatment with a second cytokine, IL-27, decreased IL-2 expression without augmenting Tconv and CD8 T cell proliferation. Notably, IL-27 only slightly modified levels of IL-2R on non-Treg T cells. Together, these results show that IL-12 has multiple effects that modify the balance between Tregs and non-Tregs and support an important role for relative levels of IL-2R but not for IFN-c expression in IL-12-mediated reversal of Treg immunosuppression.",

Interactions between Tregs and non-Tregs result in modifications of the function of both cell types, with the goal of minimizing detrimental side effects of pro-inflammatory immune responses while maximizing the efficacy of processes such as pathogen clearance.

Thus, in apparent conflict with the results using suppression assays, these data suggest that IFN-c expression is a marker for reduced immunosuppressive ability. However whether IFN-c expression actually affects Treg suppressive function has not been assessed experimentally. Collectively these results suggest that IL-12 has independent effects on Tconv and CD8 T cells as opposed to Tregs. Consequently, the effect of IL-12 (or other cytokines) on the T cell response in a total lymphocyte culture will reflect the summation of effects on the different cell types.",

Among these cytokines, IL-12, IL-6 and IFN-c have roles in T cell polarization and Treg development [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] , so we first evaluated their participation in Treg-mediated IFN-c expression. Lymphocytes were prepared from the lymph nodes of na\u00efve B6 mice, labeled with CFSE and treated with each cytokine and anti-CD3 mAb for 66 hours. Cells were then stimulated for 4 hours with PMA and ionomycin and evaluated for T cell proliferation and IFN-c expression.",

The fraction of Tregs expressing IFN-c increased after LPS or CpG exposure and was similar to levels obtained in cultures treated with IL-12 (Fig. 3 ). LPS and CpG likely functioned via effects on DCs because no IFN-c was induced when unfractionated lymph nodederived lymphocytes were treated with LPS or CpG in the absence of added DCs (data not shown). CpG or LPS-mediated augmentation in the proportion of cells expressing IFN-c was largely dependent on IL-12, since the fraction of IFN-c + Tregs increased only slightly in cultures containing IL-12Rb2 2/2 T cells (Fig. 3) .

Initially, we showed that IL-2 expression by Tconvs was modestly reduced after 48 hr with more substantial effects noted after 72 hr of IL-12 treatment (Fig. 8A ). More strikingly, IL-2 production by CD8 T cells was greatly reduced after both 48 and 72 hr (Fig. 8A ). In agreement with this diminished expression, levels of IL-2, measured by ELISA, were reduced in IL-12-treated cultures at 48 hr (Fig. 8B) . T cell proliferation is augmented by IL-2, especially in tissues at sites of inflammation [31] [32] [33] , yet the results in Fig. 1 show that Tconv proliferation is increased by IL-12 treatment. One possible explanation for these results is that IL-12 preferentially induces Effects of IL-12 on IL-2 and IL-2R Expression PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org IL-2R expression on Tconvs; IL-12 was previously shown to enhance IL-2R expression on CD8 T cells [34] . As shown in Fig. 9 (A-B, D-E), this is indeed the case. Treatment with IL-12 in the presence of anti-CD3 mAb induced up-regulation of both the a (CD25) and b (CD122) chains of the IL-2R on Tconv and CD8 T cells in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, IL-12 treatment diminished CD25 expression on Tregs while not affecting CD122 expression, reducing the ability of Tregs to compete for IL-2 in the culture. Of note, even though IL-12 induced increased IFN-c expression by Tconv and CD8 T cells, IFN-c, by itself, was unable to induce diminished expression of IL-2 (Fig. 8B) or IL-2R upregulation on non-Treg T cells (Fig. 9C) .",

Previous studies showed that IL-2 is required for maximal Foxp3 expression [35] but whether IL-12-mediated reduction in Foxp3 expression occurred through effects on IL-2 signaling was not examined. To address the role for IL-2 signaling in IL-12-mediated effects, we treated cells with exogenous IL-2. IL-2 treatment partially reversed the effect of IL-12, resulting in higher levels of Foxp3 in Tregs (Fig. 9F ). [30] . To determine whether IL-27 has similar effects as IL-12, we treated lymphocyte cultures with anti-CD3 mAb and IL-27 or medium. Similarly to IL-12, IL-27 diminished IL-2 production by Tconvs and CD8 T cells (Fig. 10A ) and down-regulated Foxp3 expression by Tregs (Fig. 10B) . However, unlike IL-12, IL-27 decreased proliferation of Tconvs and Tregs and had no effect on CD8 T cell expansion (Fig. 10C , D) resulting in a relatively slight decrease in Treg frequency (Fig. 10E) . The effects of IL-12 were mediated both by diminished IL-2 expression and changes in the relative amounts of IL-2R on Tregs and Tconvs and CD8 T cells. IL-27 reduced CD25 and CD122 expression on Tregs but only marginally affected expression on non-Tregs (Fig. 10F) . Collectively, these results suggest that Tregs are better able to compete for IL-2 in IL-27 compared to IL-12-treated cultures.",

Here, we extend these observations to analyze the effects of IL-12 on T cells in unfractionated lymphoid cultures and identify a basis for at least some of the effects of IL-12. We show that IL-12 decreases IL-2 production by Tconv and CD8 T cells and differentially modulates IL-2R expression on Tregs and non-Tregs. IL-2R is up-regulated on Tconv and CD8 T cells and down-regulated on Tregs. When coupled with decreased IL-2 production, this results in a milieu that favors non-Treg proliferation. The effect of IL-12 on CD25 expression by CD8 T cells is especially notable. In the absence of IL-12, levels of CD25 are much greater on Tregs than CD8 T cells, but treatment with IL-12 at 1 ng/ml results in levels of CD25 on CD8 T cells that exceed those on Tregs in the same culture (Fig. 8B, C) . Levels on CD8 T cells are substantially higher than those on Tconv cells, explaining why IL-12 more readily relieves Treg-mediated suppression of CD8 T cell proliferation. These results are consistent with previous reports showing that IL-2R is down-regulated on Tregs in inflamed tissues in the setting of infectious or autoimmune diseases and that IL-2 levels are reduced at these sites, resulting in the outgrowth of non-Treg T cells [5, 36, 37] .",

IL-27 is a cytokine with pro-and anti-inflammatory properties [42] [43] [44] [45] . Mice transgenic for the expression of IL-27 exhibit diminished IL-2 production, which results in decreased numbers of Tregs and subsequently, a systemic inflammatory disease [46] . We showed that IL-27 diminished IL-2 expression, consistent with these results, but IL-27 only modestly decreased Treg frequency (Fig. 9D ). Consistent with a role for IL-2R expression on non-Tregs, there were minimal changes in IL-2R levels on these cells after IL-27 treatment (Fig. 9E) . Thus, under these conditions, Tregs were presumably able to compete for IL-2 even in the presence of reduced amounts of IL-2.",

Tregs express IFN-c at sites of inflammation under conditions of Th1-type lethal and non-lethal infections [5, 8] . It has been difficult to determine whether IFN-c affects Treg suppressive function, since Tregs in these settings include both IFN-c + and IFN-ccells. Here we showed that IFN-c expression did not diminish Treg suppressive function. These results are in agreement with others showing that in vitro-generated IFN-c + and IFN-c -Tregs were equally suppressive in a mouse model of colitis [13] . In other experimental settings, loss of Foxp3 and gain of inflammatory cytokine expression suggested that Tregs converted into effector T cells [22, 47] . If Tregs at sites of inflammation can generally express IFN-c and still remain suppressive, these results raise the possibility that IFN-c + Tregs, instead of entering the effector T cell pool, could lose IFN-c and revert to a classic Treg phenotype. Whether these cells would preferentially re-express IFN-c on repeat exposure to antigen remains to be determined.",

Further, IL-12 is critical for IFN-c production by Tregs in mice with autoimmune colitis [13] . However, the requirement for IL-12 in IFN-c expression by Tconv and CD8 T cells or Tregs in virus-infected animals is less clear. To investigate whether IL-12 signaling is critical for IFN-c production by Tregs in virus-infected mice, we infected IL-12Rb2 2/2 mice with the mildly neurovirulent rJ2.2 strain of MHV [48] . We detected slightly lower frequencies of virus-specific IFN-c expressing Tregs and Tconv in IL-12Rb2 2/2 mice, consistent with a previous report showing that IL-12 modestly decreased the frequencies of virus-specific T cells in MHV-infected IL-12p35 2/2 mice [49] . The absence of IL-12 signalling may not have had a substantial effect because we detected no differences in CD25 expression on Tregs and virus-specific non-Treg T cells when cells harvested from the brains of IL-12Rb2 2/2 mice and B6 mice were compared (data not shown). Our results are also consistent with others showing IFN-c production was relatively normal in IL-12 2/2 or IL-12R 2/2 mice infected with viruses such as lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, influenza A virus, adenovirus or hepatotropic strains of MHV. In contrast, IL-12 was essential for IFN-c expression in mice infected with some intracellular nonviral pathogens, such as Leishmania species and Toxoplasma gondii [50] .",
