            "text": "Replication of plus-strand RNA viruses depends on recruited host factors that aid several critical steps during replication. Several of the co-opted host factors bind to the viral RNA, which plays multiple roles, including mRNA function, as an assembly platform for the viral replicase (VRC), template for RNA synthesis, and encapsidation during infection. It is likely that remodeling of the viral RNAs and RNA-protein complexes during the switch from one step to another requires RNA helicases. In this paper, we have discovered a second group of cellular RNA helicases, including the eIF4AIII-like yeast Fal1p and the DDX5-like Dbp3p and the orthologous plant AtRH2 and AtRH5 DEAD box helicases, which are co-opted by tombusviruses. Unlike the previously characterized DDX3-like AtRH20/Ded1p helicases that bind to the 39 terminal promoter region in the viral minus-strand (2)RNA, the other class of eIF4AIII-like RNA helicases bind to a different cis-acting element, namely the 59 proximal RIII(2) replication enhancer (REN) element in the TBSV (2)RNA. We show that the binding of AtRH2 and AtRH5 helicases to the TBSV (2)RNA could unwind the dsRNA structure within the RIII(2) REN. This unique characteristic allows the eIF4AIII-like helicases to perform novel pro-viral functions involving the RIII(2) REN in stimulation of plus-strand (+)RNA synthesis. We also show that AtRH2 and AtRH5 helicases are components of the tombusvirus VRCs based on co-purification experiments. We propose that eIF4AIII-like helicases destabilize dsRNA replication intermediate within the RIII(2) REN that promotes bringing the 59 and 39 terminal (2)RNA sequences in close vicinity via long-range RNA-RNA base pairing. This newly formed RNA structure promoted by eIF4AIII helicase together with AtRH20 helicase might facilitate the recycling of the viral replicases for multiple rounds of (+)-strand synthesis, thus resulting in asymmetrical viral replication.

After translation of the viral mRNA-sense genomic RNA(s), the viral (+)RNA and the viral replication proteins together with host RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are recruited to the site of viral replication in membranous cellular compartments. Ultimately, the process leads to the assembly of the membranebound viral replicase complexes (VRCs), followed by the activation of the polymerase function of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and initiation of complementary RNA synthesis on the viral (+)RNA template [1] [2] [3] [4] . Subsequent (+)strand synthesis in the VRCs takes place in an asymmetric manner, producing excess amounts of (+)-strand progeny, which is released from replication to participate in encapsidation, cell-tocell movement and other viral processes.",

The membrane-bound tombusvirus VRC contains p33 and p92 pol , and the tombusviral (+)repRNA, which serves both as a template and as a platform during VRC assembly and activation [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . Interestingly, the tombusvirus VRC contains at least seven host proteins as resident members, including glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH, encoded by TDH2 and TDH3 in yeast) [21] , the heat shock protein 70 chaperones (Hsp70, Ssa1/2p in yeast) [22] [23] [24] [25] , pyruvate decarboxylase (Pdc1p) [25] , Cdc34p E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme [26] , eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1A (eEF1A) [27, 28] , eEF1Bc [29] , and Ded1p DEAD-box helicase [30] . The VRC also contains two temporary resident proteins, Pex19p shuttle protein [31] and the Vps23p adaptor ESCRT protein [28, 32, 33] . Detailed mechanistic studies revealed that the cellular Hsp70, eEF1A and Vps23p are involved in the assembly of the VRC, while the functions of host RBPs, such as eEF1A, eEF1Bc, GAPDH and Ded1p, are to regulate viral RNA synthesis by the VRC [3, [21] [22] [23] [24] 29, 30, 34] .",

Among the host proteins identified are 11 host ATP-dependent RNA helicases out of 39 known yeast helicases that could be involved in TBSV replication. DEAD-box proteins constitute the largest family of RNA helicases, which perform ATP-dependent RNA duplex unwinding, RNA folding, remodeling of RNA-protein complexes, and RNA clamping in cells. DEAD-box helicases are involved in all aspects of cellular metabolism [39] [40] [41] and affect replication of many viruses [42] , including plant RNA viruses [43] . Plant RNA helicases are also implicated in plant responses to abiotic stress and pathogen infections [44] [45] [46] .",

These viruses likely recruit host helicases in order to facilitate viral replication. The best-characterized member of the helicase family involved in tombusvirus replication is the yeast Ded1p (the human DDX3like) and the similar plant AtRH20 DEAD-box helicases, both of which promote (+)-strand synthesis [30] . Ded1p and AtRH20 bind to the 39-end of the TBSV minus-strand RNA, making the promoter sequence accessible to p92 pol for initiation of (+)-strand RNA synthesis. Additional characterization of Ded1p and the similar yeast Dbp2p (similar to human p68) DEAD-box helicases revealed that these helicases play major and overlapping roles in (+ )-strand synthesis [30, 49] . Altogether, the identification of 11 yeast RNA helicases involved in tombusvirus replication suggests that tombusviruses likely co-opt a number of host RNA helicases and these helicases might have a number of unique functions in viral replication.",

We found that the yeast Dbp3p (DEAD box protein 3, human DDX5-like) and Fal1p (eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4AIII-like) DEAD box helicases, which are involved in ribosome biogenesis in yeast [50] [51] [52] , and the orthologous Arabidopsis RH2 and RH5 helicases bind to a critical replication enhancer element (REN) present in a 59 proximal region of the TBSV minus-strand RNA. We show that these cellular helicases can locally unwind the double-stranded (ds) structure within the REN of the replication intermediate in vitro. These activities by the host helicases enhance in vitro replication and plus-strand RNA synthesis, and the accumulation of TBSV RNA in yeast and plants. We also demonstrate that AtRH2 and AtRH5 helicases work synergistically with the DDX3-like AtRH20 helicase (that binds to the 39 promoter sequence) to facilitate plus-strand synthesis in an asymmetric manner. Altogether, these co-opted host DEAD box helicases greatly enhance TBSV replication by interacting with the viral (2)RNA and the replication proteins within the VRCs.",

These helicases were chosen from the 11 previously identified yeast helicases from several complementary high throughput screens using yeast and tombusviruses [26, 28, 35, 36, 38, 53, 54] . Overexpression of all 5 host RNA helicases increased TBSV accumulation, with the yeast Dbp3p showing the highest (over 2-fold increase) stimulation ( Fig. S1A-B) . The overexpression of these host helicases did not affect the accumulation of p33 replication protein ( Fig. S1A-B) , suggesting that the effects of this group of RNA helicases are not through increased translation of viral replication proteins. Altogether, the observed 30-to-140% increase in TBSV RNA accumulation due to overexpression of these yeast helicases is significant since overexpression of most yeast proteins nonspecifically reduces TBSV accumulation by 20-30% as demonstrated before based on individual overexpression of 5,500 yeast proteins [26, 54] . Thus, these helicases likely play stimulatory roles in TBSV replication.",

Accordingly, in this paper, the authors show that the yeast eIF4AIII-like Fal1p and Dbp3p and the orthologous plant AtRH2 and AtRH5 DEAD-box helicases are co-opted by Tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) to aid viral replication. The authors find that eIF4AIII-like helicases bind to the replication enhancer element (REN) in the viral (2)RNA and they promote (+)strand TBSV RNA synthesis in vitro. Data show that eIF4AIIIlike helicases are present in the viral replicase complex and they bind to the replication proteins. In addition, the authors show synergistic effect between eIF4AIII-like helicases and the previously identified DDX3-like Ded1p/ AtRH20 DEAD box helicases, which bind to a different cisacting region in the viral (2)RNA, on stimulation of plusstrand synthesis. In summary, the authors find that two different groups of cellular helicases promote TBSV replication via selectively enhancing (+)-strand synthesis through different mechanisms.",

While overexpression of AtRH2 and AtRH5 did not affect the phenotype of uninoculated N. benthamiana plants, the tombusvirus-induced symptoms were intensified (Fig. 2 ) and the symptoms appeared faster (not shown), when compared with the control host plants not overexpressing the AtRH2 and AtRH5 helicases. Simultaneous co-overexpression of AtRH2 and AtRH5 increased tombusvirus replication by up to 2-fold ( Fig. 1B, lanes 13-16) , similar to the level obtained with individual overexpression of AtRH2 and AtRH5. Also, the symptoms induced by tombusvirus infection in plants with cooverexpression of AtRH2 and AtRH5 were comparable to those induced by the individual overexpression of AtRH2 and AtRH5 (Fig. 2) . Therefore, it is likely that AtRH2 and AtRH5 play comparable and overlapping functions in tombusvirus replication. Overall, the host helicase overexpression studies in yeast and plant established that AtRH2 and AtRH5 helicases and the orthologous yeast Dbp3p and Fal1p helicases could support increased level of tombusvirus RNA replication in host cells.",

Therefore, we tested if recombinant AtRH2 and AtRH5 could unwind partial RNA duplexes, which are known to hinder RdRp-driven RNA synthesis [58, 59] . We chose partial duplex for this assay, because DEAD-box helicases are not processive enzymes and can only unwind short duplexes [40] . Interestingly, addition of purified AtRH2 and AtRH5 unwound the partial RNA duplex (Fig. 4B , lanes 1 and 2) and the yeast Dbp3p and Fal1p showed similar activities (lanes 7-8). In contrast, Ded1p and AtRH20 helicases did not efficiently unwind the RNA duplex formed only within the RIII(2) REN ( Fig. 4B , lanes 3 and 6). The failure to unwind this partial duplex by Ded1p and AtRH20 is likely due to the preference of these helicases to bind the RI(2) sequence of the tombusvirus RNA ( Fig. 3 ) [30, 49] . Overall, the unwinding assay further supported that AtRH2, AtRH5 and the yeast Dbp3p and Fal1p have a novel pro-viral function during TBSV replication that is based on interaction with the RIII(2) REN element.",

TBSV (+)RNA has been shown to perform one full cycle of replication, starting with VRC assembly, (2)RNA synthesis and finally production of excess amount of (+)-strands, in the CFE-based replication assay when purified recombinant p33 and p92 pol replication proteins are included [24, 63] . The CFE-based replication assay showed that (+ )RNA synthesis decreased by ,2-fold when compared with the control CFE prepared from yeast with high level of Dbp3p and wt Fal1p (Fig. S4B , lane 4 versus 1). This is in contrast with (2)RNA synthesis (represented by dsRNA product), which was unchanged when the CFE was prepared from dbp3D/ts-fal1 yeast versus wt yeast. However, addition of purified AtRH2 or AtRH5 to the CFE assay increased (+)RNA production by ,60-70%, while the (2 )RNA (in the form of dsRNA) was unchanged (Fig. S4C-D) .

Interestingly, the interaction of p33 with AtRH2 and AtRH5 did not affect the ability of p33 to bind to the viral (+)repRNA in vitro (Fig.  S7) . The interaction between p33 and (+)repRNA is required for recruitment of the viral (+)RNA into replication [17, 64] . Based on the above interaction data, we suggest that the viral p33 replication protein (and p92 replication protein, which within its N-terminal region contains the p33 sequence due to the expression strategy) co-opts AtRH2 and AtRH5 DEAD-box proteins from the host cells into the viral replicase complexes to aid the replication process.",

Interestingly, AtRH5 and AtRH20 host proteins, when co-expressed together, had the largest (up to ,5.5-fold, Fig. 8A, lanes 13-16) effect on viral genomic RNA accumulation in comparison with the ,2-fold increase for separate expression of AtRH20 (lanes 5-8) and AtRH5 (lanes 9-12) . Also, the symptom development of tombusvirus-infected plants was the most severe and the fastest when the two helicases were co-expressed (Fig. 8C ).

The VRCs likely have to remodel viral RNA structures, including the dsRNA formed during replication. In addition, the viral RNA plays multiple roles, such as template for translation and RNA synthesis, and as a VRC assembly platform and the viral RNA also becomes encapsidated during infection [2] [3] [4] 66] . It is likely that remodeling of the viral RNAs and RNP complexes during the switch from one step to another requires RNA helicases or RNA chaperones. While the larger RNA viruses over 6,000 nt genome-size all code for RNA helicase-like proteins [47, 48] , small RNA viruses usually do not code for RNA helicases. However, the small RNA viruses likely coopt cellular RNA helicases during infections as shown for TBSV [30, 49] . The yeast DDX3-like Ded1p and the orthologous plant AtRH20 helicases are recruited for TBSV replication to promote (+)-strand RNA synthesis by aiding initiation by the viral RdRp. However, genome-wide screens and global proteomics approaches with TBSV have identified 11 host helicases, suggesting that several host helicases might be co-opted during TBSV infections [28, 34] .",

Overall, the recruitment of eIF4AIIIlike DEAD-box helicases for replication of a small RNA virus is remarkable, and we suggest that small (+)RNA viruses likely co-opt two or more different host helicases that interact with different cisacting elements in the viral RNA to aid viral replication.",

Why is local unwinding of dsRNA within the RIII(2 ) REN stimulatory for replication? We suggest that the locally opened RIII in the dsRNA form might allow the bridge sequence within the RIII(2) REN to participate in a long-range basepairing with the 39end of the (2)RNA, thus bringing the 59 and 39 terminal sequences of the (2)RNA in close vicinity (Fig. 9 ). This could facilitate (+)-strand synthesis and the reutilization of the viral replicases (VRCs) for multiple rounds (as discussed below).",

            "text": "In summary, based on this and previous publications [21, 30, 49] , the emerging picture with TBSV is that this virus utilizes co-opted RNA-binding host proteins to regulate asymmetric viral RNA replication. The recruited host proteins are needed for specific interactions with various cis-acting sequences in the viral (2)RNA because the viral p33/p92 replication proteins bind to TBSV (2 )RNA nonspecifically [72] . We propose that, first, the recruited eIF4AIII-like RNA helicase proteins bind to RIII(2) REN, while the DDX3-like AtRH20/Ded1p helicases bind to RI(2) sequence. The interactions of two groups of helicases with the viral dsRNA likely opens up the 59 proximal RIII(2) REN and the 39 terminal promoter region from the dsRNA structure present in the VRCs. Then, long-distance RNA-RNA interaction between the bridge sequence in the RIII(2) REN and the 39 terminal sequence [57] could ''circularize'' the (2)RNA template and bring the p92 RdRp protein from the 59 end back to the 39 end for a new round of (+)strand synthesis (Fig. 9) . As proposed earlier [30, 49] , an additional function of AtRH20/Ded1p is to further unwind local secondary structure within RI(2) to promote the association of the cellular GAPDH with an AU-rich internal site and proper positioning of the GAPDH-p92 RdRp complex [73] over the (+)-strand initiation promoter, leading to robust (+)RNA synthesis. Therefore, we propose that the synergistic effect between the two groups of subverted helicases, host GAPDH and the viral p92 pol might promote efficient recycling of the viral RdRp, resulting in multiple rounds of (+)RNA synthesis on the same dsRNA template (Fig. 9) . This strategy could be beneficial for the virus by allowing asymmetric RNA synthesis on dsRNA templates, thus leading to excess amount of progeny (+)RNAs.",

            "text": "Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain BY4741, Ddbp3 (YKO library) and TET::Fal1 yeast strain (yTHC library), were obtained from Open Biosystems (Huntsville, AL, USA). Ts-Fal1 yeast strain was from a yeast ts strain collection [91] . Yeast strain NMY51 was obtained from Dualsystems. Ddbp3/ts-Fal1 yeast strain was generated as follows: plasmid pYM-14 (EUROSCARF) [92] was used for PCR with primers #5011 and #5012 (Table S1 ) to amplify the Dbp3 deletion cassette. Ts-Fal1 yeast was transformed with the obtained Figure 9 . Model on the roles of co-opted cellular helicases in asymmetrical replication of tombusviruses. Cis-acting replication elements present at the 39 and 59 ends of the viral (2)RNA are recognized by cellular helicases to locally open the viral dsRNA replication form. Namely, the eIF4AIII-like helicases unwind the dsRNA structure within the RIII(2) REN, while the DDX3-like helicases open up the dsRNA structure within RI(2) (as shown schematically). Long-range RNA-RNA interaction between the ''bridge'' and the cPR region (promoter sequence at the 39 end) in the (2)RNA is proposed to lead to circularization of the viral (2)RNA, which is still part of the dsRNA. This RNA structure is suggested to facilitate the transfer of the viral p92 pol from the 59 end of the (2)RNA [after completion of the (+)RNA strand synthesis in the previous round] back to the 39 cPR in the (2)RNA for a new round of (+)RNA strand synthesis. Another co-opted cellular protein, GAPDH (called Tdh2/3 in yeast) is likely involved in this process by facilitating the binding of p92 pol to the 39end of the (2)RNA. Altogether, the re-use of the viral p92 pol multiple times on the same (2) RNA template could result in production of multiple (+)RNA progeny, resulting in the characteristic asymmetric viral RNA replication. Note that it is also possible that p92 pol is standing still, while the RNA template is moved during RNA synthesis within the membrane-bound VRCs. doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1004051.g009 PCR product and the suitable yeast strain was selected on G418 containing plates. Then, yeast strains were grown in liquid media and genomic DNA was isolated. The correct deletion site was checked by PCR with primers #2215 and #5019 using genomic DNA as a template. PCR products of yeast helicase genes were obtained as follows: yeast genomic DNA was used as a template for amplification by PCR with primers #4612 and #4613 for DBP3; #4569 and #4570 for DBP5; #4611 and #4756 for DBP7; #2351 and 4825 for TIF1; and #4893 and #4894 for FAL1. The generated PCR products were digested with BamHI and XbaI in the case of DBP3 and DBP5 and with BglII and XbaI in the case of DBP7. Plasmids pYC-His (provided by Dr. Daniel Barajas) and pMalc-2x (New England Biolabs) were digested with BamHI and XbaI and pPr-N (Dualsystems) was digested with BamHI and NheI and ligated with the similarly treated PCR products of DBP3, DBP5 and DBP7.",

Briefly, the expression plasmids were transformed into E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) CodonPlus.

The CFE-based TBSV replication assays were performed in 20 ml total volume containing 2 ml of CFE, unlabeled 0.15 mg DI-72 (+)RNA or RI/II/IV (+ )RNA transcripts, 200 ng purified MBP-p33, 200 ng purified MBP-p92 pol and 200 ng purified MBP-tagged helicase proteins. The assays were performed as published [24, 63] . Fractionation of the assay products was done as follows: after 3 h of incubation at 25uC, reaction mixtures were centrifuged at 21,0006g for 10 min to separate the ''soluble'' (supernatant) and ''membrane'' (pellet) fraction. Then the membrane fraction was re-suspended in reaction buffer. Both fractions were then treated as separate samples during phenol/chlorophorm extraction, ethanol precipitation. The samples were dissolved in 16RNA loading dye and analyzed by PAGE electrophoresis in 5% polyacrylamide gel containing 8 M urea with 0.56 Tris-borate/EDTA buffer as described [24, 63] . For the detection of the 32 P-labeled dsRNAs generated in the CFE assays, we prepared the RNA samples in 16 RNA loading dye (containing 25% formamide), followed by dividing the samples into two equal fractions; one half was loaded on the gel without heat-treatment, while the other half was heattreated for RNA denaturation at 85uC for 5 min and analyzed by PAGE [27] . in the presence of 0.4 mg of purified recombinant cellular helicases (except 1.0 mg in case of AtRH20) is shown. Note that lanes 1-6 show samples from the in vitro replication assays with the combination of two cellular helicases [i.e., AtRH20 (1.0 mg) plus the shown helicase), while lanes 7-13 show samples with only a single helicase in the assay. (C) Detection of (+) and (2)-stranded RNA products produced by the purified TBSV replicase on the DI-72 RNA/RNA duplex template in vitro replication assay containing cellular AtRH5 and AtRH20 helicases (lane 2 in panel B). The blot contains the same amount of cold (+) and (2)stranded DI-72 RNA, while the 32 P-labeled repRNA probes were generated as in panel B. The ratio of (+) and (2)-stranded RNA products was estimated. (PDF) Figure S4 Cell-free TBSV replication assay supports a role for Fal1p and Dbp3p helicases in plus-strand synthesis. (A) Scheme of the CFE-based TBSV replication assay. TBSV DI-72 (+)repRNA was added to the whole cell extract (CFE) prepared from either WT yeast or Dbp3p-depleted and ts-Fal1p-inactivated yeast strain expressing p33 and p92 pol replication proteins. The membrane and soluble fractions were separated at the end of the replication assay by centrifugation. (B) Detection of single-and doublestranded RNA products produced in the cell-free TBSV replication assays. ''T'' total, ''M'' membrane fraction, ''S'' soluble fraction. Note that the ssRNA present in the ''S'' fraction represents the released (+)repRNA products from the membrane-bound VRCs. (C) Scheme of the CFE-based TBSV replication assay with purified recombinant cellular helicases. (D) Detection of single-and double-stranded RNA products produced in the cell-free TBSV replication assays by denaturing PAGE analysis of the 32 P-labeled TBSV repRNA products (See panel C). The assay also contained purified recombinant AtRH2 or AtRH5 (0.15 mg) or MBP (the same molar amount as the helicases) as a control. Odd numbered lanes represent replicase products, which were not heat treated (thus both ssRNA and dsRNA products are present), while the even numbered lanes show the heat-treated replicase products (only ssRNA is present). The % of dsRNA and ssRNA in the samples are shown. Note that, in the nondenatured samples, the dsRNA product represents the annealed (2)RNA and the (+)RNA, while the ssRNA products represents the newly made (+)RNA products. Each experiment was repeated three times. (PDF) Figure S5 AtRH5 is a component of the tombusvirus replicase in yeast. (A) The membrane-bound tombusvirus replicase was purified via solubilization of the FLAG-tagged p33F from yeast extracts using a FLAG-affinity column (lanes 1-2). Yeast not expressing p33F was used as a control (lane 3). Top panel: Western blot analysis of FLAG-tagged p33F with anti-FLAG antibody. Bottom panel: Western blot analysis of His 6 -tagged AtRH5 with anti-His 6 antibody in the affinity-purified replicase preparations.
