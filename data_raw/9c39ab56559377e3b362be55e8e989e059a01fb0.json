            "text": "Signaling by Bone Morphogenetic Proteins (BMP) has been implicated in early lung development, adult lung homeostasis and tissue-injury repair. However, the precise mechanism of action and the spatio-temporal pattern of BMP-signaling during these processes remains inadequately described. To address this, we have utilized a transgenic line harboring a BMPresponsive eGFP-reporter allele (BRE-eGFP) to construct the first detailed spatiotemporal map of canonical BMP-pathway activation during lung development, homeostasis and adult-lung injury repair. We demonstrate that during the pseudoglandular stage, when branching morphogenesis progresses in the developing lung, canonical BMP-pathway is active mainly in the vascular network and the sub-epithelial smooth muscle layer of the proximal airways. Activation of the BMP-pathway becomes evident in epithelial compartments only after embryonic day (E) 14.5 primarily in cells negative for epithelial-lineage markers, located in the proximal portion of the airway-tree, clusters adjacent to neuro-epithelial-bodies (NEBs) and in a substantial portion of alveolar epithelial cells. The pathway becomes activated in isolated E12.5 mesenchyme-free distal epithelial buds cultured in Matrigel suggesting that absence of reporter activity in these regions stems from a dynamic cross-talk between endoderm and mesenchyme. Epithelial cells with activated BMP-pathway are enriched in progenitors capable of forming colonies in three-dimensional Matrigel cultures. As lung morphogenesis approaches completion, eGFP-expression declines and in adult lung its expression is barely detectable. However, upon tissue-injury, either with naphthalene or bleomycin, the canonical BMP-pathways is re-activated, in bronchial or alveolar epithelial cells respectively, in a manner reminiscent to early lung development and in tissue areas where reparatory progenitor cells reside. Our studies illustrate the dynamic activation of canonical BMP-pathway during lung development and adult lung tissue-repair and highlight its involvement in two important processes, namely, the early development of the pulmonary vasculature and the management of epithelial progenitor pools both during lung development and repair of adult lung tissue-injury.

Thereafter, during the ''saccular'' stage [E17.5 to postnatal day 4 (P4)] the distal airways form the saccular units which are further subdivided by secondary septae formed during the alveolar stage (P4-P28 in mice) to form mature alveoli. This sequence of events is tightly controlled by the concerted action of growth factors, transcription factors, and mechanical forces [5, 6, 7] .",

BMPs, like all other members of the TGFb superfamily, signal via specific membrane receptors that have serine-threonine kinase catalytic activity [9] . Functional BMP receptor units are composed of two Type-I and two Type-II receptor polypeptides. Four different Type-I BMP receptors (ALK2, ALK3/BMPRIa, ALK6/BMPRIb and ALK1), and three Type-II receptors (BMPRII, ActRIIA and ActRIIB) have been identified [10] . Upon ligand binding, the constitutively active Type-II receptors phosphorylate and thus activate their Type-I partners, which in turn phosphorylate their intracellular targets, the receptor-regulated Smad proteins 1, 5 and 8. Phosphorylated Smads form complexes with the ''common'' Smad4 and translocate to the nucleus where they regulate expression of their target genes, synergistically with other transcription factors [8, 11] . BMPs can also signal via Smad-independent intracellular pathways that involve mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases [12, 13] .",

Disruption of BMP signaling by ectopically expressing the BMP antagonists noggin or gremlin in the lung epithelium [15, 22] , inactivating BMP receptors [16] or expressing a dominant negative form of the BMP Type-I receptor (dnALK6) result in abnormal distal lung architecture. Remarkably, over-activation of the BMP pathway is also incompatible with normal lung development. Ectopic over-expression of Bmp4 in the epithelium leads to smaller lungs and to substantially reduced epithelial cell proliferation [14] and mice with deletion of the BMP antagonist Follistatin-Like 1 (Fstl1) gene die at birth from respiratory distress and show multiple defects in lung development [23, 24] .",

Moreover, characterization of the mechanisms by which BMPs affect adult lung homeostasis and tissue repair is still rudimentary. The current study was based on the premise that identification of the actual cellular targets of BMP mediated signaling during lung development, homeostasis and adult lung tissue repair will facilitate interpretation of earlier genetic studies, guide rational targeting of BMP signaling components in future experiments and contribute to the clarification of the mechanisms of action of this signaling system. Therefore, utilizing a mouse transgenic line carrying the eGFP reporter gene under the control of a canonical BMP pathway responsive regulatory element [33] we have constructed a detailed spatiotemporal map of canonical BMP signaling in the lung and identified putative cellular targets of this signaling pathway during lung development and adult lung tissue-injury repair. Our studies suggest that canonical BMP pathway plays key roles during early development of the pulmonary vasculature and the management of lung epithelial cell progenitors during late lung development and repair of adult lung tissue injury.",

The kinetics of mRNA expression for eGFP and the BMP target gene Id1 were analyzed by quantitative PCR. EGFP and Id1 mRNA levels followed similar kinetics to eGFP protein expression, reaching maximum levels around birth ( Figure 2A ). P1 lungs were therefore enzymatically digested and lung cells were separated by cell sorting on the basis of eGFP expression into eGFP negative (eGFP neg ), eGFPlow (eGFP low ) and eGFP high (eGFP high ) cells ( Figure 2B ). Western blot analysis of protein extracts from the isolated population demonstrated good correlation between expression of eGFP and levels of pSmad1/5/8 ( Figure 2C , D). Analysis of the mRNA levels for eGFP and BMPregulated target genes such as Smad6, Id1 and Id3 demonstrated very good correlation between the level of eGFP expression and the activation of known BMP targets ( Figure 2E ). Interestingly, expression of Id2 mRNA did not correlate with levels of eGFP expression. Furthermore, treatment of embryonic lung explants exvivo with either BMP-or TGFb-receptor inhibitors resulted in either suppression or augmentation of BRE-eGFP transgene expression, respectively (see below Figure 3B ). Moreover, treatment of embryonic lung explants with FGF10, a known inducer of BMP4 production by distal endodermal cells, or recombinant BMP4 resulted in substantial up-regulation of eGFP expression ( Figure S3 ). Treatment of the lung explants with purmorphamin, a Shh agonist, resulted in redistribution of the eGFP staining pattern that involved a small increase of eGFP expression in a narrow zone of sub-mesothelial cells and a reduction of eGFP expression in the more central parts of the mesenchyme. This pattern of expression could stem from a Shh mediated reduction in FGF10 synthesis by mesenchymal cells [35] that in turn leads to a more confined BMP expression zone.",

As shown in Figure S4 , nuclear pSmad1/5/8 was detected in regions with intense eGFP immuno-staining demonstrating consistency between BRE-eGFP reporter activity and pSmad1/5/8 immuno-staining ( figure S4 ). Unfortunately, in our hands the anti-pSmad1,5,8 reagents we have analyzed so far were unable to detect pSmad1/5/8 in lung tissues from embryos before stage E19.5 and thus we were not able to confirm correlation of eGFP and pSmad1/5/8 at earlier developmental stages. A number of studies have indicated that the value of measuring pSmad1/5/8 as the sole indicator for canonical BMP pathway activation is questionable since presence of pSmad1/5/8 does not necessarily lead to transcriptional activity of BMP target genes. Canonical BMP pathway activity is known to be regulated by cell type-specific Smad-interacting transcription factors, co-activators and co-repressors. For example Tbx1 can bind to Smad1, interfere with Smad1/Smad4 interaction and decrease BMP transcriptional activity without affecting the amount of pSmad1/5/8 in the responding cell [42] . Furthermore, Leeuwis et al. [41] demonstrated that in the kidney of BRE-eGFP animals, whereas the expression pattern of BRE-eGFP exhibited excellent correlation with the expression of the BMP7 and the BMP target genes Id1, and Smad6, in contrast pSmad1/5/8 exhibited a brought expression pattern that did not correlate with the expression of BRE-eGFP, BMP7, Id1 or Smad6. Therefore, a safer assessment of canonical BMP pathway should combine analysis of several known BMP target genes and pSmad1/5/8 immuno-stainings when this is technically possible. Collectively, the analysis by Monteiro et al. [33] , Leeuwis et al. [41] and the results described herein indicate that the BRE-eGFP transgenic line reports quite faithfully activation of the canonical BMP pathway in-vivo and ex-vivo and thus it provides an additional method for assessing potential canonical BMP pathway activation.",

The eGFP expression, which interestingly involved only a portion of the sub-epithelial SMCs, was undetectable by P15. It has been proposed that sub-epithelial SMCs originate from a pool of sub-mesothelial, FGF10-expressing, mesenchymal cells. Under the influence of several signalling pathways, such as those mediated by FGF, BMP, Shh, and Wnt, these cells proliferate and passively translocate to surround the proximal portion of the developing airway tree [35, 43, 44, 45, 46] . http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012160611 010189 -bb0125To map more precisely the temporal activation of the BRE-eGFP reporter during development of the subepithelial SMC compartment we isolated P11, P12 and P13.5 lungs from the BRE-eGFP reporter animals and analysed coexpression of eGFP and SM22a, a marker of both primitive and mature SMCs [47] , or aSMA a marker of more differentiated SMCs. As shown in Figure S1B , SM22a expression was observed in a sub-epithelial population of cells around the developing proximal airways already at embryonic stage E11, aSMA expression was evident only in the most proximal portion of the SM22a pos zone and eGFP expression was clearly detected in the aSMA pos zone only after embryonic stage E13.5 (very few aSMA pos cells expressed very low levels of eGFP at E12). These findings are consistent with the notion that canonical BMP signalling does not involve primitive SMCs but rather mature aSMA expressing sub-epithelial SMCs.",

From E19.5, the eGFP pos -CC10 low ''cap'' cells (green-arrows in Figure 4B ) were separated from the eGFP neg -CC10 pos cells by a zone of double positive epithelial cells (yellow-arrows in Figure 4B) . Notably, the zone of eGFP pos -CC10 pos cells coincided with zones richin NEBs ( Figure S5 ). From P15 and beyond, the only NEBassociated eGFP pos cells were CGRP pos neuro-epithelial cells (blue-arrows in Figure 4B ).",

One model suggests that mesenchymal derived FGF10 induces Bmp4 expression by the distal bud epithelium to limit, in an autocrine manner, Fgf10-mediated bud outgrowth [45, 50] . The other model, based on the differential response of the distal epithelial buds to BMP4 in the presence or absence of mesenchyme, proposes that Bmp4 produced by the distal epithelium acts in an autocrine manner to limit proliferation of distal epithelial buds, and in a paracrine manner, on the adjacent mesenchyme, to induce production of a mesenchymal signal that enhances proliferation of distal epithelial buds [51] . Thus, according to the latter model the negative or positive effect of BMP signalling on branching is the outcome of a dynamic balance between negative autocrine and positive paracrine mechanism.",

Therefore, mesenchyme free distal epithelial buds and epithelial free mesenchyme were isolated as previously described [35, 36] and cultured in Matrigel. Remarkably, within 8 hours of incubation, the BRE-eGFP reporter was strongly up-regulated in the mesenchyme-free epithelial buds and conversely it exhibited a tendency for decline in the isolated mesenchyme ( Figure 5 ). These findings are consistent with the model of Bragg et al. [51] and moreover suggest that the elusive, mesenchyme derived, epithelial growth promoting signal could simply act by negatively regulating activation of the canonical BMP pathway in the distal epithelium buds.",

The finding that disruption of the vascular network in growing lung explants affects branching morphogenesis by reducing primarily ''orthogonal bifurcations'' of the epithelial tubules [53, 54] and the findings presented herein demonstrating the influence of the adjacent mesenchyme on the activation of the canonical BMP pathway reporter ( Figure 5 ) illustrates the importance of the crosstalk between epithelial and vascular cells during early lung development.",

Further studies will be required to assess whether the BRE-eGFP reporter is not active in the distal endoderm because: a) non-canonical BMP pathways are primarily involved; b) the canonical BMP pathway is active however, does not reach the activation threshold required to activate the BRE-eGFP reporter; or c) that the dynamic balance between the mesenchyme and endoderm which keeps the BRE-eGFP reporter inactive most of the time (Figure 5 ), allows at critical points along the branching process transient spikes of canonical BMP pathway signaling to reach the nucleus and regulate expression of target genes.",

Since eGFP expression was highly increased in lung parenchyma of the BRE-eGFP mice during the saccular and alveolar stages, the period during which functional alveoli are formed, we characterized the nature of the eGFP pos cells in this part of the developing lung. Tissue sections from different developmental stages were analyzed by co-staining for eGFP and pro-surfactant protein C (pro-SpC), a marker of type-II pneumocytes. As shown in figure 6 and Figure S2 , eGFP staining during the pseudoglandular stage was confined to endothelial cells and peri-bronchial smooth muscle cells of the proximal airways. Pro-SpC pos epithelial cells in the distal airways were uniformly eGFP neg at this developmental stage ( Figure S2 ).In contrast, starting at the canalicular stage (E17) and persisting until approximately P15, a population of eGFP pospro-SpC pos cells emerged in the distal lung compartments ( Figure 6A ).The SpC pos cells at this stage of development are thought to be immature type-II pneumocytes [55] . Morphometric analysis demonstrated that during the saccular and alveolar stages, approximately half of the pro-SpC pos alveolar cells were eGFP pos . Adult tissues, in which alveolarization was complete, contained a very small number of eGFP pos -pro-SpC pos alveolar cells (,0.5-1%) ( Figure 6B ). High resolution confocal microscopy analysis revealed that at all the developmental stages analyzed only a very small portion of type-I pneumocytes were eGFP pos ( Figure S7 ). Interestingly, ectopic over-expression of a constitutive ALK3 in cultures of adult primary pulmonary cells resulted in increased pro-SpC (,6-fold) and Id1 (,15 fold) mRNA levels, in comparison to the untreated or ALK5ca treated groups ( Figure 6C ) further implicating canonical BMP-signaling in the physiology of type-II pneumocytes.",

The conclusion that canonical BMP signaling becomes crucial for lung epithelial cell development at the cannalicular stage is consistent with earlier genetic studies demonstrating that deletion of Bmpr1 [16, 18] or Smad1 [19] and ectopic expression of negative regulators of BMP signaling such as XNoggin and dominantnegative ALK6 [15] by SpC-promoter-driven expression, resulted in defects in lung development visible only around E15-E16, i.e. after completion of the branching morphogenesis.",

BrdU pos cells accounted for ,6.7% of the surface airway epithelium in conducting airways and were uniformly distributed throughout the airway tree ( Figure 7A ).

The randomly distributed eGFP neg -BrdU pos cells detected in the developing lungs ( Figure 7A ) could represent the former type whereas the eGFP pos epithelial cells could represent the latter type of progenitors. Once lung development is completed, the homeostatic, low turnover, maintenance of the epithelial population can be supported by the distributed Clara cells [38, 56] and thus active BMP signaling may not be required any longer. The decline in eGFP expression in the lungs of the adult BRE-eGFP transgenics may reflect just that. Reactivation of the BRE-eGFP reporter in adult lung after tissue injury suggests an active role of BMP-signaling in adult lung repair after injury",

As shown in Figures 9A and 9B , treatment of adult BRE-eGFP animals by intra-tracheal administration of bleomycin resulted in substantial reactivation of the eGFP reporter in type-II pneumocytes (Pro-SpC pos ). During the first days of treatment the eGFP pos cells were primarily cuboidal SpC pos cells. From day-4 onwards both cuboidal and squamous eGFP pos cells were found in the alveolar regions. Interestingly, the squamous eGFP pos cells were T1a-expressing type-I pneumocytes and were always localized in the borders between affected and apparently normal tissue ( Figure 9C ). We postulate that the cuboidal eGFP pos cells observed in the early stages of the bleomycin induced response represent a reparatory progenitor population that expands and differentiates into the eGFP pos -T1a low cells observed in the later stages to repair the damaged alveolar epithelium. Further studies will be required, however, to validate this hypothesis.",

Our studies demonstrated that during the pseudoglandular stage, when branching morphogenesis characterises lung development, canonical BMP pathway is active mainly in the vascular network and the airway smooth muscle layer. Only after the completion of branching morphogenesis and the initiation of epithelial cell differentiation canonical BMP pathway activation commences in airway and alveolar epithelial cell that are enriched in progenitors that can form epithelial colonies in Matrigel in-vitro. The BRE-eGFP reporter is reactivated in mesenchyme-free distal epithelial buds cultured in Matrigel suggesting that the low reporter activity in intact lungs is the result of a dynamic interplay between the endoderm and the mesenchyme and moreover suggest that the elusive, mesenchyme derived, epithelial growth promoting signal postulated by Bragg et al. [51] may act by regulating negatively activation of the canonical BMP pathway in the distal epithelium buds.",

            "text": "BRE-eGFP expression, in agreement with earlier reports describing the temporal expression pattern of some BMP pathway components during late lung development [65] , peaks around birth and returns to very low levels upon completion of lung development. Remarkably, severe depletion of Clara cells in the adult lung by naphthalene treatment, leads to re-expression of the eGFP reporter around NEBs and terminal bronchioles, areas known to harbour airway progenitor cells. Likewise, injury of the alveolar epithelium in the adult lung by bleomycin treatment, leads to re-expression of eGFP initially in SpC pos cuboidal epithelial cells, which we postulated to be alveolar epithelial progenitors and subsequently in squamous T1a low cells which we postulated to be derived from the former population and on the way to differentiate to Type-I pneumonocytes. Our findings are compatible with the notion that during the late stages of lung development the role of canonical BMP signalling pathway is to maintain the undifferentiated state of the airway and alveolar epithelial progenitors preventing premature exhaustion of their pools and securing the continuous supply of the differentiated epithelial cells that are required for a fully developed lung. The reactivation of the BMP responsive reporter in adult animals undergoing repair of severe epithelial injury, where the same requirements regarding proper management of the undifferentiated epithelial progenitor pools apply, is also compatible with this conjecture. An analogous function has been previously proposed for BMP signaling regarding the maintenance of the undifferentiated state of pluripotent mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells [66, 67] and the maintenance of the undifferentiated, multipotent state of distal lung progenitor cells [45, 68] .",

Figure S3 FGF10, BMP4 and a Sonic Hedgehog agonist affect expression of the BRE-eGFP reporter. A) Whole E12 lung-explants were cultured on Nuclepore membranes for eight hours in the presence of vehicle, FGF10 (250 ng/ml), BMP4 (100 ng/ml) or Sonic Hedgehog agonist Purmorphamin (500 nM). Upper panel shows bright field images of representative explants. Lower panel shows eGFP expression in the same explants. B) Confocal images of tissue sections prepared from the explants described above stained for eGFP (green stain). Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI. Note the strong upregulation of eGFP expression in the FGF10 and BMP4 treated explants, and the Figure S4 Correlation between pSmad1/5/8 and BRE-eGFP immune-staining in P1 lung tissue sections. Adjacent tissue section of lungs from BRE-eGFP reporter animals were stained with anti-GFP or anti-pSmad1/5/8 antibodies as described in materials and methods. A) Staining of adjacent sections of a large airway with anti-GFP and anti pSmad1/5/ 8antibodies or normal rabbit IgG fraction as isotype control. B) Representative images from the indicated tissue regions demonstrating that tissue areas with intense BRE-eGFP expression coincide with regions exhibiting pSma1/5/8 immuno-staining.

A) Representative confocal images demonstrating activation of the BRE-eGFP transgene in the vascular network of the lung in E12 embryos. E12 lung tissues from BRE-eGFP transgenic animals were stained for eGFP, CD31, VEGFR-2 and aSMA. Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI. The images demonstrate robust activation of eGFP expression in CD31 pos and VEGFR-2 pos cells and week activation in some of the subepithelial aSMA pos cells (see insert in lower right image). Of note is the complete absence of any eGFP staining in the airway epithelial compartment. B) Kinetics of BRE-eGFP reporter activation in sub-epithelial smooth muscle cells (CMSs). Representative confocal images of tissue sections prepared from E11, E12, E13.5 and E14.5 BRE-eGFP transgenic lungs and stained for eGFP, SM22a and aSMA. The left panel shows magnified the eGFP channel only. The white dashed rectangles in each lane of images correspond to identical tissue areas. Note that the BRE-eGFP reporter is activated in mature aSMA positive cells that are located in the most proximal portion of the airway tree.
