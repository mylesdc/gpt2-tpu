The agricultural, economic, and social impacts of prion diseases have been intensified by evidence suggesting transmissibility of BSE to humans [2] . The putative infectious agent in these diseases, designated PrP Sc , is a misfolded isoform of the normal cellular prion protein (PrP C ). The amino acid sequences of PrP Sc and PrP C are identical [3] ; normal and abnormal forms of the protein differ only in conformation. No differences in posttranslational covalent modification have been demonstrated [3] . Circular dichroism and infrared spectroscopy indicate that the disease-specific isoform has a higher b-sheet and lower a-helix content than PrP C [4] . The normal isoform is soluble and primarily monomeric in solution, whereas PrP Sc forms insoluble aggregates.",

Routes of natural transmission remain to be clarified, but available evidence indicates that an environmental reservoir of infectivity contributes to the maintenance of these diseases in affected populations [6] [7] [8] . The expanding range of CWD (several regions of North America and Korea) increasingly brings domestic livestock, companion animals, and wildlife species into contact with infected animals and carcasses, and shedded TSE agent, raising the possibility of cross-species transmission. This was demonstrated by the recent detection in Colorado, USA, of a free-ranging, CWD-infected moose, a species not previously known to be affected by the disease in the wild [9] .",

TSE infectivity exhibits remarkable resistance to inactivation by most chemical agents, radiation, and heat [12] and has been shown to persist after burial in soil for at least 3 y [13] . Anecdotal observations of healthy sheep contracting scrapie after occupying fields previously containing diseased animals have been reported [7, 8] . Although these older studies did not account for the genetic susceptibility of the sheep under study, they suggest that scrapie agent can persist in the environment for years. Recent controlled field experiments provide more compelling evidence of the environmental persistence of prions. Miller et al. [14] demonstrated that na\u00efve mule deer could contract CWD when housed in paddocks previously inhabited by infected animals or containing decomposed infected carcasses.",

Furthermore, bovine, sheep, and deer TSE agents have been introduced to soil environments through the burial of diseased carcasses and other infected material [18] . Animals ingest soil both deliberately and incidentally [19] . Cattle, deer, sheep, and other animals can consume hundreds of grams of soil daily [20, 21] . Taken together, these data support the notion that PrP Sc -contaminated soil may allow intraspecies TSE transmission and enhance the likelihood of spread to other species. As a first step toward understanding the role of soil as a reservoir of TSE infectivity, we investigated the binding of PrP Sc to common soil minerals and whole soils and examined the infectivity of mineral-bound prions.",

A large degree of PrP Sc binding to the nonexpandable clay mineral Kte was observed when the surface area was matched to that of external Mte surfaces ( Figure 1A ).

TSEs include scrapie in sheep, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (''mad cow'' disease) in cattle, chronic wasting disease (CWD) in deer and elk, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans. Scrapie and CWD are unique among TSEs because they can be transmitted between animals, and the disease agents appear to persist in environments previously inhabited by infected animals. Soil has been hypothesized to act as a reservoir of infectivity, because PrP Sc likely enters soil environments through urinary or alimentary shedding and decomposition of infected animals. In this manuscript, the authors test the potential for soil to serve as a reservoir for PrP Sc and TSE infectivity. They demonstrate that PrP Sc binds to a variety of soil minerals and to whole soils. They also quantitate the levels of protein binding to three common soil minerals and show that the interaction of PrP Sc with montmorillonite, a common clay mineral, is remarkably strong. PrP Sc bound to Mte remained infectious to laboratory animals, suggesting that soil can serve as a reservoir of TSE infectivity.",

Neither treatment prevented PrP Sc cleavage. Amorphous metal oxide coatings on clay mineral particles can alter their surface reactivities and could potentially be responsible for PrP Sc cleavage. The size-fractionated Mte used in this study has been reported to not contain such impurities at levels detectable by X-ray diffraction analysis [23] , and precautionary pretreatment of the clay with a buffered neutral citrate-bicarbonate-dithionate solution to remove metal oxide coatings [24] failed to prevent cleavage.",

We incubated PrP Sc with Mte for short time periods (1-15 min) to qualitatively investigate initial adsorption and cleavage kinetics. Adsorption of PrP Sc to Mte was apparent within 1 min, and reduction in protein molecular mass was discernable (Figure 2A ). Prion protein cleavage consistently occurred early within the first 15 min of contact with Mte and appeared maximal by 60 min. Cleavage of PrP Sc caused by sorption to or desorption from Mte seemed to be a phenomenon specific to this protein. We examined sorption and desorption of scrapie-infected hamster brain homogenate (BH) to Mte. Desorption of brain proteins from Mte produced no changes in the overall molecular mass distribution as visualized by Coomassie blue staining (unpublished data). Subunit C2 of the 20S proteasome (;29 kDa), an unrelated protein similar in size to PrP likewise did not appear cleaved upon desorption from Mte ( Figure 2B ).

In contrast, probing identical samples with a polyclonal antibody against full-length PrP demonstrated that PrP Sc was desorbed from the Mte.

Washing Mte-PrP Sc with the background solution used in sorption experiments did not induce detachment of detectable amounts of PrP Sc from Mte (unpublished data). Contact of PrP Sc with Mte for up to 1 wk did not result in additional degradation, indicating that the protein was not rendered more susceptible to cleavage by further structural rearrangements on the clay surface ( Figure 3A ). The strength of PrP Sc attachment to Mte was surprising, even in light of reports of protein sorption-desorption hysteresis on mineral surfaces [26] . Conditions previously employed to desorb other proteins from soil minerals were largely ineffective in detaching PrP Sc from Mte surfaces [26, 27] . In our experiments, described above, a solution containing 10% SDS at 100 8C was used to remove the PrP Sc from mineral surfaces. Changes in pH often alter interactions between clay surfaces and sorbed proteins [27, 28] . Incubation of Mte-bound PrP Sc in 100 mM phosphate buffer at pH 2.5 or 11.5, proton activities substantially higher and lower than the reported isoelectric points for PrP Sc [29] , failed to release the protein ( Figure 3B ). Likewise, increases in ionic strength (0.1 M or 1 M NaCl) failed to remove detectable PrP Sc from Mte ( Figure 3C ). Strong chaotropic agents can be effective in desorbing proteins from soil minerals by disrupting hydrogen bonds [26] ; however, neither 8 M urea nor 8 M guanidine released detectable amounts of PrP Sc from Mte ( Figure 3D ). Our data indicate the interaction between PrP Sc and Mte is strong and of high affinity.",

If binding to Mte surfaces results in (partial) unfolding of PrP Sc , a reduction or loss of infectivity would be expected, as denaturation renders the protein noninfectious [31] . We therefore tested whether PrP Sc adsorbed to Mte remained infectious by intracerebrally inoculating hamsters with Mte-PrP Sc complexes ( Table 2) . The time to onset of clinical symptoms after inoculation provides a measure of infectivity [32] . Hamsters inoculated with Mte-PrP Sc exhibited clinical symptoms of scrapie 93 dpi. To control for any unbound prion protein that may have cosedimented with Mte particles, mineral-free PrP Sc suspensions were processed in the same manner as in sorption experiments. The sedimented fraction of these control samples (mock pellets) showed substantially less infectivity than Mte-PrP Sc pellets with a mean incubation period of 178 d, 105 d longer than Mte-PrP Sc pellets. Hamsters inoculated with supernatants from these control samples (mock supernatants) showed clinical symptoms 103 dpi. Animals intracerebrally inoculated with Mte alone and uninoculated animals did not exhibit TSE symptoms during the course of the experiment (200 d). ",

When equal masses of soil (0.5 lg) were used, all soils bound PrP Sc to a similar extent ( Figure 4) ; no detectable PrP Sc remained in the supernatant at the level of protein used in this experiment. Prion protein desorbed from the soils did not appear cleaved. Several nonmutually exclusive factors may have contributed to this finding, including (1) relatively small amounts of Mte in some samples, (2) occlusion of Mte cleavage sites by metal oxide and/or natural organic matter coatings, and (3) competition among the various sorption domains (both inorganic and organic) for PrP Sc , limiting interaction with Mte. The amount of immunoreactive PrP Sc recovered from each soil differed slightly; for example, the immunoreactive protein desorbed from the Elliot soil was less than that from the Boardman soil. This may have been due to stronger interaction of PrP Sc with the Elliot soil than with the Boardman soil, leading to incomplete extraction, consistent with the larger fraction of clay-sized particles in the Elliot soil (Table S2 ).",

Interestingly, the N terminus of PrP Sc desorbed from Mte was truncated ( Figures 1A and 2) . While Mte is known to catalyze several reactions, including the deamination of free glutamine and aspartic acid [34] and the polymerization of RNA into oligomers [35] , protease activity has not been noted previously. The interaction between Mte and PrP Sc is remarkably avid, as the only extractant used in this study that effected desorption was a solution containing 10% SDS at 100 8C ( Figure 3B-3D) . Prion protein appears unlikely to readily desorb from Mte in the environment. The propensity for PrP Sc to tenaciously bind to Mte could be exploited in landfills to isolate prion-infected materials and prevent migration of the infectious agent.",

Current mechanistic models for conversion of PrP C to the pathological form require direct PrP C -PrP Sc interaction [36] . The brain is unlikely to possess microenvironments capable of extracting significant amounts of PrP Sc from clay surfaces. The 10-d increase in incubation period for Mte-adsorbed PrP Sc relative to clay-free controls (mock supernatant) was statistically significant (p , 0.05) and would correspond to approximately a 1-log increase in infectivity [32] . This result suggests that PrP Sc -Mte complexes are inherently more infectious than the unbound protein and/or adsorption to Mte reduces clearance from the brain. We consider it likely that PrP Sc adsorbed to Mte surfaces was available to convert PrP C in the brain to the pathological isoform. Our findings are reminiscent of reports in which metal wires exposed to scrapie agent harbored significant infectious agent despite attempts to remove attached PrP Sc [37, 38] .",

Brains from clinically positive hamsters and uninfected controls were analyzed for protease-resistant PrP by immunoblotting. Figure S1 . Sucrose Cushion Prevented Sedimentation of Unbound PrP Sc under Conditions Necessary to Pellet Soil Minerals A substantial amount of unbound PrP Sc pelleted when centrifuged under conditions required to remove Na \u00fe -Mte from suspension, but was prevented from sedimenting by a sucrose cushion. Sucrose cushions were therefore employed in batch sorption experiments to prevent sedimentation of unbound PrP Sc . Results from representative mock adsorption experiments are shown. PrP Sc was rotated in a solution of 10 mM NaCl in the absence of soil minerals for 2 h and was either placed above a 750 mM sucrose cushion and centrifuged (two right lanes), or centrifuged without a sucrose cushion (two left lanes).
