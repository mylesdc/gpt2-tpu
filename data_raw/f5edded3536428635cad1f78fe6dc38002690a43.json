In the past thirty years, great achievements have been made in integrative medicine researches, especially in clinical practice. The clinical achievements mainly include the following three: innovating methodology of disease-syndrome combination, excavating the classical theory in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), preventing and curing refractory diseases. The development ideas and strategies of integrative medicine for future mainly include (a) standing on frontier field of international medicine and improving the capability of preventing and curing refractory diseases; (b) moving prevention and control strategy forward and improving the curative effect of common and frequent disease; (c) excavating the classical theory of TCM and broadening the treatment system of modern medicine; (d) improving the innovation level of new high effective drugs on the basis of classical prescriptions and herbs in TCM; (e) rerecognizing the theory of formula corresponding to syndrome in TCM and enhancing the level of clinical research evidence based on evidence-based medicine. Integrative medicine will do obtain greater achievements in creating new medicine and pharmacology and make more tremendous contributions for the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation and human health care.",

The tendency of \"confluence of Chinese and western medicine\" appeared as the two medical systems contacting and influencing with each other since then. With the development of modern medical technology, intercourse, and cooperation between TCM and WM, integrative medicine was established in the 1980s. Under the guidance of \"system learning, comprehensively mastering, sorting, and improving,\" predecessors of integrative medicine have been exploiting the complementary advantages of macro and micro, global and local, structure and function, traditional and modern, disease differentiation, and syndrome differentiation in WM and TCM, in order to create new medicine and pharmacology theory. Through unremitting efforts of integrative medicine staffs at home and abroad, remarkable achievements have been made in health care, teaching, researching, academic development, discipline construction, talent training, and so forth. So we can say that integrative medicine is not only an innovative China model in clinical practice, but also the bridge for TCM toward the world [1] [2] [3] . Now the clinical achievements of the past 30 years and developing strategies of integrative medicine are described as follows.",

As a new mode for syndrome research, disease-syndrome combination mainly refers to absorbing the idea and theory of disease differentiation in western medicine (WM) as 2 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine well as syndrome differentiation in TCM. The mode, which originates from the medical practice since more than half a century ago, has realized mutual compensation of advantages of TCM and WM [1, 2] . Combining whole thinking, imagery thinking, and dialectical thinking in TCM with materialism of modern medical sciences, the mode can be regarded as a good cut-in point and successful control pattern for integrative medicine [3] . It has complementary advantages of WM and TCM and marks a new era created by integrative medicine in clinical researches. Seminar on the academician Chen Keji's academic thinking about \"the new mode of disease-syndrome combination and its application in clinical practice\" was held in Beijing on May 23, 2011. Professor Chen and his students discussed the scientific connotation of this new mode and its application in diagnosis, treatment, and scientific research together. China news of traditional Chinese medicine, a famous domestic media, made followup report on the symposium, which had evoked large repercussions.",

            "text": "Academician Chen Keji pointed out that modern view of disease-syndrome combination includes six aspects: (a) mode of disease differentiation by WM combined with syndrome differentiation by TCM; (b) mode of syndrome differentiation and treatment combined with specific prescription for certain illness; (c) mode of treating according to disease staging; (d) mode of differentiation of the basic pathogenesis combined with syndrome differentiation and treatment in TCM; (e) mode of treating according to syndrome differentiation rather than disease differentiation when there's no disease can be diagnosed in WM; (f) mode of treating according to disease differentiation rather than syndrome differentiation when there's no syndrome can be diagnosed in TCM [4] . The emphasis of the mode could be played on either syndrome or disease. As the connotation of syndrome in TCM is significantly different from disease in WM, laying special emphasis on syndrome means that syndrome is just the basis of therapeutic scheme. On the contrary, effective therapeutic plans should be formulated according to disease differentiation when special emphasis is laid on disease. This new mode is beneficial to the original innovation in diagnosis and treatment. The advantages of the mode include four aspects as follows. (a) Definitely diagnosing. As the disease diagnosis in TCM is vague and extensive, it is entirely necessary and possible to absorb some relevant achievements of disease diagnosis in WM for definitely diagnosing. (b) Targeted treating. As the new mode pays more attention to the therapeutic evaluation of disease, it could achieve more definite therapeutic targets and stable curative effect compared with syndrome differentiation mode alone. (c) Accurately prognosing. Summarization of clinical phenomena is the principal judgment basis for prognosis in TCM, therefore, the prognosis judgment is always not very accurate. However, the new mode has vital guidance value for treatment and prognosis judgment. (d) Deepening classics. Due to the succinctness and conciseness of TCM classics, the essential features of the disease and syndrome could be rerecognized and deepened through combining with the modern cognition of pathology, diagnostics and pharmacology study in WM.",

Different from diagnosis based on pathological mechanism, syndrome is a classification according to subjective symptom and objective sign collected by physical examination [5] [6] [7] . Premise studies on diseasesyndrome combination lies in syndrome diagnostic criteria and therapeutic evaluation system. Researches on syndrome diagnostic criteria aim at establishing the scientific and normative diagnosis system, while researches on therapeutic evaluation aim at constructing an objective evaluation system. Under the leadership of academician Chen Keji, we are the first to study and report on blood stasis syndrome in coronary heart disease based on the new mode. Contributed to the diagnosis of blood stasis syndrome in coronary heart disease, 19 items such as precordial pain, dark purple tongue color, and erythrocyte deformability were selected based on the calculation analysis of 48 kinds of examination items in 92 cases patients with coronary heart disease. And the clinical diagnosis accordance rate was 89%. 6 items giving the greatest contribution to diagnosis such as blood viscosity and total cholesterol (TC) were confirmed by a stepwise regression analysis for 21 items such as hemorheology and blood lipid [8] . Correlation analysis of blood stasis syndrome and pathological changes shown in coronary angiography with coronary heart disease showed that the blood stasis syndrome score was significantly correlated to the maximal stenosis degree and coronary lesion score demonstrated by coronary angiography before percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and the correlation was increased along with the increasing of the patients' age and the course of the disease. Conclusions were also verified in our related researches [9] [10] [11] .",

We also constructed the diagnosis scales of blood stasis syndrome and its accompanied syndromes in coronary heart disease, such as qi deficiency and blood stasis syndrome and qi stagnation and blood stasis syndrome [12] [13] [14] . In the study of therapeutic evaluation system, taking coronary heart disease as example, important indexes such as syndrome evaluation scale, clinical critical events, and quality of life were selected on the basis of completely evaluating the present indexes through application of clinical epidemiology-/evidencebased medicine method. Meanwhile, high validity and reliability of therapeutic evaluation system of coronary heart disease was constructed through comprehensive analysis of various index by the hall for workshop of metasynthetic engineering. Clinical efficacy scale of TCM syndrome and the primitive entry pool of scale for patient-reported outcomes of coronary heart disease were established by our team [15] .",

Blood stasis syndrome theory is first recorded in The Songs of Chu, a classical literature written in ancient China. Shuo Wen Jie Zi (Text Notes and Word Explanations) written by Xu Shen in the Eastern Han Dynasty explained that blood stasis is hematocele. And it was frequently mentioned in TCM classics such as the Canon of Internal Medicine, Treatise on Febrile Diseases, and Synopsis of Golden Chamber. Inspired by the prominent TCM doctor Guo Shikui's experience in treating angina pectoris by Decoction for Removing Blood Stasis, a classic formula developed by Wang Qingren in Qing Dynasty, academician Chen Keji advocated treating coronary heart disease by activating blood circulation to dissipate blood stasis principally. His team was the first to study the diagnostic criteria of blood stasis syndrome and report the quantitative scoring method, which had been extensively used in domestic and was the first study in using objective quantitative method in TCM syndrome study. Objectified study of abdomen diagnosis on blood stasis syndrome was also superior to the research methods of Japan in the same period. Standards of syndrome differentiation and therapeutic evaluation of coronary heart disease were formulated according to above-mentioned researches, which had already become national standards. The essence of blood stasis syndrome and mechanism of treating coronary heart disease by activating blood circulation to dissipate blood stasis had been elucidated at various levels of intact animal, tissue, cell, molecule, and gene protein expression. As coronary restenosis after coronary artery balloon injury and stent placement have been considered an international difficult problem, academician Chen firstly treated it by decoction for removing blood stasis and optimized the prescription to a more simplified and effective recipe, Xiong Shao Capsule (XSC). A randomized controlled trial (RCT) about XSC showed that the restenosis rate in XSC group treated by XSC on the basis of routine western therapy was decreased by 45% compared with routine western therapy group, and the experimental studies showed that XSC could suppress the gene expression of proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells [16] [17] [18] [19] . With important academic value and clinical significance, the study has promoted the academic development of TCM greatly, which had been awarded the first award of national science and technology progress in 2003.",

Through unifying standard for syndrome differentiation and defining operative indication, his team accumulated a large number of valid acute abdomen cases with the therapeutic method of expelling pathogens by purgation. Under the leadership of Professor Wu, the multidisciplinary and prospective researches included the effects of dispelling interior pathogenic factors and purgation on the splanchnic blood flow and caecal single smooth muscle cell, the clinical characteristics of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) caused by several different kinds of elements, the changes of nerve-endocrine-immunological network in MODS and the effects of purgative herbs on information transmission mechanism of immune cells through four times of different scale joint research in the seventh to tenth five-year plan period.

The theory is a traditional simple understanding of hypertoxic drug treating difficult and complicated diseases. It was recorded in Compendium of Materia Medica that the herbal nature of arsenolite is very hot and poisonous, while white arsenic sublimed from arsenolite is more poisonous. White arsenic is a traditional external drug for removing the necrotic tissue and promoting granulation plaster, the effective component of which is AS 2 O 3 . The research was enlightened by the prominent TCM doctor's experienced external prescription for treating skin cancer. On the basis of verification of curative effects and optimizing prescription, researchers developed the arsenous acid injection from the experienced external prescription, which had definitive curative effect for the patients with APL and reached the top level in the world [23] [24] [25] [26] . The mechanism of arsenous acid treating APL was illustrated from the perspective of molecular oncology, including degradation of PML/RARa fusion proteins, downregulating gene expression of Bcl2 and inducing apoptosis in leukemia cells. Arsenous acid became the first antileukemia drug of inducing apoptosis in the world arousing the medical research fever of arsenic trioxide [27] [28] [29] . It was honored as \"ancient remedy performs new tricks\" in 1996 by Science [30] . Sloan-Kettering and his coworkers reported that 12 patients with recurrence of APL after conventional chemotherapies were treated with AS 2 O 3 , and 11 cases of them relieved completely in 1996. This paper, published in New England Journal of Medicine, directly led to the widely acceptance of AS 2 O 3 in the treatment of APL in the international medical field [31] .",

Compared with the control group, the incidence of RS rate in the XSC group was significantly lower (24.1% versus 48.5%, P < 0.05) and the extent of angiostenosis and diameter of the culprit arteries, determined by CAG, also significantly reduced after patients had been treated for 6 months with [(2.21 \u00b1 0.85) mm versus (1.72 \u00b1 0.99) mm, P < 0.05], and [(26.58 \u00b1 20.72) % versus (41.19 \u00b1 30.92) %, P < 0.05], respectively. The incidence of clinical end-point event was significantly lower in the XSC group than that in the control group (11.7% versus 27.6%) and the P value was close to statistical significance (P = 0.051). Comparing with the control group, the blood-stasis syndrome score in the XSC group was also significantly lower (P < 0.01). The results showed that XSC had a wide range of therapeutic effects including effectively preventing RS after PCI in combination with conventional western medical treatment, decreasing the attack of angina pectoris and improving the blood stasis syndrome.

Since the 1970s of 20th century, some scholars began to take vigorous action to explore a new way of preventing and treating MODS by integrative medicine and a new theory of \"bacteria and bacterial toxin treated simultaneously\" was presented ultimately. They also perfected schemes for the diagnosis procedure and treatment standard of MODS by both TCM and integrative medicine. And four therapeutic principles for the main types of syndromes were put forward, such as activating blood circulation to dissipate blood stasis therapy on blood stasis syndrome, clearing heat and toxin therapy on heat toxin syndrome, reinforcing the vital energy and consolidating the constitution therapy on acute deficient syndrome, and dispelling interior pathogenic factors and purgation therapy on Yangming fu-organ syndrome. Integrative medicine therapy can effectively improve the clinical efficacy and shorten the course of the disease thus reducing mortality. A famous injection of Chinese medicine, \"Shen Nong 33,\" with the effect of activating blood circulation to dissipate blood stasis and antiendotoxin, was developed, which has reduced the mortality of international recognized infectious four or more organs failure from 100% to 50% and reached the international advanced level.

Those recipes have multilevel and multitarget effects, including improving symptoms, reducing blood glucose, improving blood rheology and blood flow, lowering triglycerides (TGs), and malondialdehyde (MDA), enhancing activity of erythrocyte SOD, Na + -K + -ATP enzyme and Ca 2+ -Mg 2+ -ATP enzyme, and so forth. The experimental studies showed that the effect of Xian Zhen tablet includes lowering blood glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin, decreasing urine protein excretion, improving renal function, reducing the pathological changes of glomerular mesangial expansion and basement membrane thickening, decreasing AGEs amounts of renal cortex, and downregulating RAGE-mRNA expression in renal cortex and endothelia of heart vessel. It provided a new idea for preventing and treating diabetic and chronic vascular complications [53, 54] .",

However, it had been ignored for a long time. The theory of syndrome differentiation and formula corresponding to syndrome are two characteristic inheritance veins in TCM. Generally speaking, the former is always the mainstream ideology in TCM, while the latter has been paid little attention. Clinical medication based on pathogenesis is the core idea of syndrome differentiation, while clinical medication based on formula syndrome is not exactly the same as it. The most significant difference between them is whether giving attention to the objective evidences of formula utilization. The theory of formula corresponding to syndrome attaches great importance to the objective indications of herbs, which mainly comes from long-term, large-scale and repeated clinical trials by Chinese ancients.",

So it is suggested that, facing with one patient, 10 TCM physicians may prescribe the identical prescription and get rapid treatment effect simultaneously according to the indications of formulae and herbs. This is just the reason why the significant curative effect can be by classical prescriptions get in treating severe and lingering illness. The extractive process of indications is similar to the evidencebased research, and indications of herbs have probably exceeded the category of expert experience in EBM. Therefore, carrying out clinical studies under guidance of EBM and formula corresponding to syndrome is helpful to summarize the indications of formulae and herbs, and enhance the level of clinical research evidence in TCM [75] [76] [77] [78] [79] .",

Integrative medicine, an unprecedented task in present world, is a new pattern of medicine, which is formed by the integration of TCM and WM. The current situation of integrative medicine career was highly evaluated by academician Han Qide. He pointed out that integrative medicine is an inevitable choice for the development of Chinese medicine and the breakthrough point of development for modern medicine, which have unique advantages and will play an important role in China. With changing of the disease chart, increasing of metabolic disease, malignant tumor, iatrogenic disease and drug-induced disease, and the coming of senile society as well as the change of people's views on health and medical mode, both opportunities and challenges have been brought to the development of integrative medicine. Thus we believed that under the guidance of \"pay equal attention to both WM and TCM\" and \"implementing the integrative medicine and developing TCM,\" integrative medicine will obtain great achievements in creating new medicine and pharmacology, which builds on the combination of both WM and TCM, and make tremendous contributions for the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation and human health care [80] .",
