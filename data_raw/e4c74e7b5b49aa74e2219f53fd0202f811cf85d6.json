            "text": "Enterovirus genome replication occurs at virus-induced structures derived from cellular membranes and lipids. However, the origin of these replication organelles (ROs) remains uncertain. Ultrastructural evidence of the membrane donor is lacking, suggesting that the sites of its transition into ROs are rare or fleeting. To overcome this challenge, we combined live-cell imaging and serial block-face scanning electron microscopy of whole cells to capture emerging enterovirus ROs. The first foci of fluorescently labeled viral protein correlated with ROs connected to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and preceded the appearance of ROs stemming from the trans-Golgi network. Whole-cell data sets further revealed striking contact regions between ROs and lipid droplets that may represent a route for lipid shuttling to facilitate RO proliferation and genome replication. Our data provide direct evidence that enteroviruses use ER and then Golgi membranes to initiate RO formation, demonstrating the remarkable flexibility with which enteroviruses usurp cellular organelles. IMPORTANCE Enteroviruses are causative agents of a range of human diseases. The replication of these viruses within cells relies on specialized membranous structures termed replication organelles (ROs) that form during infection but whose origin remains elusive. To capture the emergence of enterovirus ROs, we use correlative light and serial block-face scanning electron microscopy, a powerful method to pinpoint rare events in their whole-cell ultrastructural context. RO biogenesis was found to occur first at ER and then at Golgi membranes. Extensive contacts were found between early ROs and lipid droplets (LDs), which likely serve to provide LD-derived lipids required for replication. Together, these data establish the dual origin of enterovirus ROs and the chronology of their biogenesis at different supporting cellular membranes.",

Other viruses (e.g., hepatitis C virus [6] and severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS] coronavirus [7] ) produce, among other structures, doublemembrane vesicles (DMVs) that can be found in isolation or with outer membrane connections to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), from which they are derived. Identifying the cellular donor organelle for \u03e9RNA virus ROs provides important clues about the host factor requirements underlying viral replication. However, determining the donor is problematic when ultrastructural analyses fail to capture direct connections between cellular organelles and ROs.

Their proliferation and utility as replication membranes are dependent on lipids like cholesterol and phosphatidylcholine, which are recruited to ROs via coopted cellular lipid transport mechanisms, and whose levels are sustained by upregulated import, the lipolysis of lipid droplets (LDs), and lipid biosynthesis (8) (9) (10) (11) . During the earlier stages of infection, enteroviruses produce ROs with a singlemembrane tubule (SMT) morphology, which transform into double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) and multilamellar vesicles as infection progresses (12, 13) . While enterovirus ROs appear in cytosolic clusters in which their membranes are frequently tightly apposed, both SMTs and DMVs are distinct, isolated structures that do not form a continuous membrane network. These membrane morphologies parallel those found in cells infected with cardioviruses, another genus of Picornaviridae (14) .",

            "text": "Despite our understanding of enterovirus RO morphology, establishing the sites of their formation has proven challenging, as enterovirus ROs have thus far been observed only as separate compartments that lack direct connections to any cellular organelle. Different studies have diverged in linking RO biogenesis to ER, Golgi, or autophagy membranes (15) (16) (17) (18) , and their interpretation is complicated by the uncertain correspondence between markers used and ROs. Although the majority of viral RNA (vRNA) synthesis is associated with ROs, it remains possible that the initial sites of genome replication are largely unmodified membranes, ahead of viral protein accumulation and RO biogenesis. In fact, sustained enterovirus RNA synthesis can occur at morphologically unmodified membranes under conditions where RO formation is delayed (19) . Moreover, rather than reflecting RO origin, host proteins may be recruited to ROs, independently and differentially, according to infection stage, host cell, or viral species studied. For other \u03e9RNA viruses, like SARS coronavirus (7), hepatitis C virus (6), dengue virus (4), and cardiovirus (14) , direct connections between host membranes and ROs have been established, providing compelling evidence regarding their origins. While visualizing membrane connections between donor organelle and nascent enterovirus ROs would help clarify whether the ER, Golgi apparatus, or other membranes are utilized for RO formation, the lack of such connections in ultrastructural studies to date suggests that they are rare or transient and thus difficult to capture.",

SBF-SEM is a recently developed technique that facilitates the reconstruction of large volumes (whole cells and tissues) but at the expense of resolution compared to conventional transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (20) . First, we explored the resolving power of this technique on enterovirus-infected cells and extracted quantitative information about the abundance and volumes of RO clusters. We next set out to pinpoint the subcellular location of RO biogenesis. For this, we monitored infection until the emergence of the first ROs in live cells, exploiting a split-green fluorescent protein (split-GFP)-tagged coxsackievirus that illuminates the viral 3A protein (21) . These emerging 3A foci correlated with nascent ROs in SBF-SEM reconstructions, which were further assessed for any association between cellular organelles and ROs. A close physical association was found between ROs and LDs, whose volumes decreased over the course of infection, suggesting that RO proliferation is supported by the formation of tight LD-RO contacts that facilitate lipid transfer. Importantly, we were able to locate and resolve membrane continuities between putative donor organelles and ROs. Our data provide a timeline that unites apparently disparate observations related to the origins of enterovirus ROs, revealing that RO formation starts at the ER, followed by biogenesis at the trans-Golgi network. These findings suggest a remarkable flexibility in virus membrane utilization of different cellular organelles to form morphologically similar structures.",

            "text": "Large-volume electron microscopy resolves RO ultrastructure during enterovirus infection. To assess the resolving power of SBF-SEM on enterovirus-infected cell ultrastructure, Vero E6 cells were infected with coxsackie B virus 3 (CVB3) and fixed at 6 h postinfection (hpi). Our previous studies with electron tomography showed that enterovirus ROs with different morphologies (i.e., single-membrane tubules, doublemembrane vesicles, and multilamellar vesicles) are present at this time point. After fixation, cells were prepared and imaged by SBF-SEM along with mock-infected cells for comparison. These data revealed expansive fields of ROs in infected cells, which dominated a large volume of the cell cytoplasm ( Fig. 1A ; see also Movie S1 in the supplemental material). Although the individual membranes of single-and doublemembrane ROs were not resolvable by SBF-SEM under the imaging conditions used, single-membrane ROs (white arrowheads) were distinguishable from doublemembrane (hatched arrowheads) or multilamellar (black arrowheads) ROs by the apparent thickness of the stained membrane (Fig. 1A, left) . To support this interpretation, SBF-SEM images were compared with higher-resolution TEM images collected from the same type of samples ( Fig. S1A and B) , confirming that enterovirus ROs were discernible in the SBF-SEM data. Cellular organelles like the ER, lipid droplets, cis-Golgi cisternae, and trans-Golgi network, could be unambiguously identified in SBF-SEM reconstructions of mock-infected cells through comparisons with TEM images (Fig. S1C ). In infected cells, prominent cellular organelles, like the nucleus, ER, and mitochondria, were also identified (highlighted in Fig. 1A , right). While Golgi cisternae were absent throughout these infected cell volumes, Golgi cisternae were clearly visible in all mock cell volumes assessed (n \u03ed 13). These whole-cell visualizations confirm that Golgi apparatus cisternae disintegrate during enterovirus infection, as was previously inferred from live-cell imaging studies monitoring Golgi markers across infection, and two-dimensional (2D) ultrastructural data at early and late infection time points (12, 17, 19, 22) .",

CVB3-induced RO clusters accounted for large parts of the cytoplasmic volume, at 16% of in cell A (104 m 3 ) and 6% in cell B (37 m 3 ). The difference likely reflects a more advanced infection stage in cell A, which is supported by the appearance of extensive ER dilation (Fig. 1A ) characteristic of later stages of enterovirus infection (12, 23) . The nanometer resolution achievable by SBF-SEM allowed RO clusters in close proximity to be segmented apart to analyze their size distribution (Fig. 1C) . For both cells, most ROs were not homogeneously distributed across the cytosol but instead accumulated in a single large cluster (bright green segmented volumes, 98 m 3 in cell A and 27 m 3 in cell B) proximal to the nucleus. Most of the remaining ROs could be found in relatively small clusters (colored), with more than 90% of these clusters smaller than 0.1 m 3 in both cells (Fig. 1C) .",

Our previous live-cell imaging data demonstrated that the onset of Golgi apparatus disintegration in CVB3 infection is concomitant with the accumulation of viral protein (e.g., 3A) in the Golgi region (19, 21) . Intriguingly, the first foci of 3A protein Sites of Enterovirus Replication Organelle Biogenesis \u00ae arise in the cell periphery, often ahead of the dramatic 3A accumulation in the Golgi region that expands to dominate the cell cytoplasm as infection progresses (Movie S2, white and black arrowheads, respectively). It is unknown whether both the peripheral and Golgi-proximal 3A foci that emerge during this phase represent developing ROs. One possibility is that the small peripheral 3A foci that form early in infection are replication independent and that these 3A accumulations are merely the result of translation of the incoming vRNA delivered by uncoating of virus particles. To test this, we inhibited vRNA synthesis by treating infected cells with guanidine hydrochloride (GuHCl) and monitored these cells by live-cell imaging. The CVB3 3A was visualized by utilizing a split-GFP system (21) . Neither peripheral nor any other 3A-GFP signal emerged under GuHCl inhibition, demonstrating that their formation is not a product of translation of only incoming vRNA but depends upon vRNA replication (Fig. S2 ).",

Ultrastructural evidence of continuities between cellular organelles and ROs that would shed light on the membrane donor organelle has been lacking, however, suggesting that connections between enterovirus ROs and cellular organelles are rare, or that the association of ROs with their donor organelle is short-lived. To capture these events, we employed live-cell imaging to monitor the emergence of viral 3A protein using a split-GFP system. The resulting 3A-GFP signal was utilized as a correlative marker to highlight potential sites of interest in SBF-SEM cell volumes, which were further assessed for any association between cellular membranes and ROs.

The presence of disperse peripheral RO foci even at late stages of infection ( Fig. 1B and C) , often in close contact with the ER (data not shown), makes it tempting to speculate that ER-derived ROs are continually produced throughout infection, even after Golgi disassembly.

As for the ER-derived ROs, we show that vRNA synthesis is a requirement for the formation of peripheral 3A-GFP foci and therefore must take place ahead of the development of Golgi-derived ROs. (Fig. S2) . At this stage, there is a complete correspondence between peripheral 3A-GPF foci and morphologically typical ER-derived ROs (Fig. 2 and S3) .

In light of a recent study demonstrating the importance of LD-derived lipids for enterovirus replication and RO formation (11) , it is tempting to speculate that ROs and LDs can form bona fide membrane contact sites (MCS) containing tethers and lipid transfer machinery. These MCSs could underlie an important route for the recruitment of critical lipids for enterovirus RO formation, like fatty acids and cholesterol (8, 25) , which may contribute to LD depletion as ROs proliferate over the course of infection (Fig. S4) .",

This indicates that any core cellular components required for enterovirus RO formation are common to both the ER and Golgi apparatus or readily recruited by viral proteins. The enterovirus host factor phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P), which was recently shown to expedite the formation of ROs (19) , may represent one example of this. While the beta isoform of phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase, PI4KB, is primarily responsible for PI4P production at the Golgi apparatus, the alpha isoform PI4KA produces PI4P at the ER, with particularly high levels of PI4P present at ERES (27) . Together with the observed associations between viral proteins and ERES markers (15, 17) , this could nominate PI4P-rich ERES as candidate nucleation points for developing ER-RO foci. However, PI4KA inhibition does not affect the final replication yield during enterovirus infection (28) (29) (30) , suggesting that ER-derived ROs may confer a small benefit early in infection but are ultimately expendable for replication. Another possibility is that the PI4P utilized for ER-derived RO formation is supplied by PI4KB, recruited by the enterovirus 3A protein (17) . While peripheral 3A protein also accumulated early in the replication of a mutant enterovirus, this accumulation was abolished under PI4KB inhibition (19) , which could support the notion that ER-derived ROs require PI4KB. In this way, the compositional requirements for RO formation and viral replication would be met by supplementing suitable but diverse donor membranes with recruited host factors.",

Correlative live-cell and SBF-SEM imaging indicates that RO formation occurs at ER and then Golgi membranes with some chronological separation, implying that the core cellular components required for enterovirus replication and RO formation are common to both organelles or readily recruited by viral proteins. Flexible recruitment of membranes for replication would confer a remarkable level of adaptability to different conditions, providing \u03e9RNA viruses with an important evolutionary advantage. This work extends the growing body of evidence suggesting that \u03e9RNA viruses are not constrained to utilizing membranes from a single cellular source for their replication, with important implications for the development of antivirals targeting viral host factors.",

Variable pressure imaging conditions, which reduce the final resolution, aided in the suppression of charging resulting from the large regions of bare resin surrounding single cells.

Vero E6 cells were infected with CVB3, fixed at 6 h postinfection, and stained and processed for SBF-SEM imaging. (A) Left, a single slice from the SBF-SEM reconstruction of an infected cell. The cytosol is populated by clusters of ROs (example in boxed area), including single-membrane (white arrowhead), doublemembrane (hatched arrowhead), and multilamellar (black arrowhead) ROs. Right, cellular organelles, including mitochondria (red), the ER (yellow), and the nucleus (blue), can be resolved alongside ROs (green). (B) Segmentations of two infected cells (A and B) highlight the positions of individual ROs clusters (multicolored) and the nucleus (blue) within the cell volumes (beige, semitransparent). (C) The number of RO clusters and their respective volumes were quantified in the cells presented in panel B, and the histogram of RO cluster sizes revealed a similar binary distribution in each cell, where the majority of RO volume in each cells falls within a single perinuclear cluster, while the majority of all other RO clusters are 2 orders of magnitude smaller.
