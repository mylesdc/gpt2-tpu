Mass media reports on an epidemic or pandemic can provide important information to the public, and in turn, can induce positive healthy behaviour practices (i.e., handwashing, social distancing) in the individuals, that will reduce the probability of contracting the disease. Mass media fatigue, however, can dampen these effects. Mathematical models can be used to study the effects of mass media reports on epidemic/ pandemic outcomes. In this study we employ a stochastic agent based model to provide a quantification of mass media reports on the variability in important public health measurements. We also include mass media report data compiled by the Global Public Health Intelligence Network, to study the effects of mass media reports in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. We find that the report rate and the rate at which individuals relax their healthy behaviours (media fatigue) greatly affect the variability in important public health measurements. When the mass media reporting data is included in the model, two peaks of infection result.",

Influenza control can be achieved through various strategies including vaccination, the use of drug therapy, hand washing and social distancing-removing oneself as much as possible from the population [1, 2] . Vaccines and drug therapies, however, may be ineffective (e.g. resistance to antivirals) or unavailable (i.e. pending development of a new vaccine). Thus, hand washing and social distancing practices (i.e., ranging from moderate to extreme total isolation), which can be used at all times during an infectious disease outbreak are integral in decreasing the probability of contracting and transmitting infection [1] .",

Public health education campaigns, that include informative literature (i.e., pamphlets), posters, newspaper articles and advertisements, radio and television messages, and social media outlets (i.e., twitter, facebook) are used daily to inform the public on current health issues. Mass media outlets can aid in dissemination of this information. Studies of mass media campaigns and healthy behaviour have reported that mass media campaigns can elicit positive behaviour change and even prevent negative behaviour change in individuals [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . It is therefore concluded that mass media campaigns should be used to inform the public so that behaviour change can result [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . It has been shown that information conveyed by the media is becoming the critical factor as to whether or not a vaccination campaign will succeed [11] . It is believed that the media coverage of the recent SARS and 2009 H1N1 epidemics had an effect on the total spread of these pathogens [4, 7, 12, 13] . More recently, MERS-CoV, Ebola, and H7N9 have been the subject of many media reports.",

From herewithin, we describe all healthy behaviours including isolation, limiting contacts and hand washing as 'social distancing'. Social distancing levels included in the model are chosen to reflect different degrees of protection that healthy behaviour change can provide. Specifically, we include the extremes-no protection and total protection/isolation, and a moderate protection level.

This may be due to the fact that individuals can move between social distancing classes many times during the epidemic, providing greater uncertainty in these outcomes of the epidemic.

These methods are said to be the most efficient methods for performing sensitivity analysis with variation in multiple parameters simultaneously [43] . The outcomes that are of interest for Eq (3) include the peak time of the epidemic (or time to the peak), the end time of the epidemic (or length of the epidemic), the peak magnitude of infectious and exposed individuals, and the total number of infectious individuals. Fig 4 shows the PRCC values for Eq (3) assuming a constant population size N. This figure shows that R 0 is the most important parameter for each outcome. However, the total number of infections over an epidemic is also sensitive to changes in the rates at which individuals become infectious (\u03c3) and recover (\u03b3). The figure also shows that the peak magnitude and the total number of infections are both sensitive to the media parameter \u03c1, and the epidemic end time is sensitive to the media fatigue rate \u03c1 1 . Overall, the sensitivity analysis results show that to minimize the effect of the epidemic, public health programs should strive to (1) reduce transmission (effectively reducing R 0 ), (2) effectively use drug therapies that can shorten the infectious period (effectively decreasing \u03c3 and increasing \u03b3), (3) increase the number of reported cases \u03c1, and (4) provide educational programs throughout an epidemic that will help minimize the waning of positive social distancing practices \u03c1 1 . These results demonstrate that role of mass media can significantly affect the severity and length of an epidemic/pandemic. Thus, attention should be given to studying how best to use mass media during an epidemic, so that epidemic measurements can be minimized.",

The structure of Eq (3), however, allows for the incorporation of real mass media data into the model like that compiled by GPHIN (Fig 3) [34] . Fig 5 shows the results of Eq (3) when social distancing and waning behaviour are included in the model with (right column) and without (left column) vaccination and the media data [34] . Here, the English language media report levels are used (see Fig 3, dashed line) (top row), and the media data is then extended to consider various scenarios of media reporting until the end of the pandemic: a constant level equal to the last collected data point (second row), a decay after the final data point (third row), setting the report level to zero at the end of the data set (fourth row), and setting the number of reports to zero at the declared end of the pandemic (week 47 [44] ). Note that when vaccination is included in the model (right column), the vaccination rate for each of the scenarios is between 25% to 40% of the population [2] , and vaccination is included only in the second wave of infection. Fig 5 demonstrates that for all cases, two waves of the pandemic occur, with the magnitude of the peaks varying by the model assumptions. Interestingly, these dynamics agree with what was observed in many countries globally during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic-two waves of infection with two distinct peaks were observed in this timeframe. For a qualitative comparison we plot the total number of confirmed cases in Canada during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic [44] that shows this two wave behaviour (see Fig 6) . In addition to English, French is another official language in Canada. When the French language reports are included in the model similar results are found-two peaks of infection occur, however, there is a smaller number of total infections due to the fact that there are more media reports used in the media equation and the total population N being considered was unchanged. A further simulation considering the same population size and all media reports in all languages (Fig 3 solid line) results in a a single small wave of infection (not shown). Again, this is an intuitive result since the model assumes that if there are more media reports, more individuals will uptake social distancing practices and vaccination. However, if we increase the total population size, which better represents a population that is affected by media reports in all of the languages tracked by GPHIN, two peaks of infection will result.",

In a recent study, we demonstrated that epidemic outcomes can vary greatly depending on the mass media function chosen, making it difficult to determine any quantification of the variability in key epidemic measurements for public health [33] . It was concluded that models that include a mass media compartment should thus be employed [33] .

First, two waves of infection were experienced by many countries globally during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, including Canada. Second, previous studies of the two wave behaviour have mainly focused on the effects of school holidays during the pandemic, which effectively reduced transmission and then increased it again a couple months later, producing two waves of infection [44] [45] [46] [47] .

Also, exposed and infectious individuals can also practice social distancing measures. For example, an infected individual may elect to stay home from work, and distance themselves from family members in the same household as well. To model continuous social distancing in all classes we propose a new model employing partial differential equations that keeps track of all classes of infection over time and social distancing space. Analysis of this model is current work. In future work, the model will be augmented to include asymptomatic infections, where individuals are infectious but do not demonstrate symptoms. This will affect transmission, as social distancing will not be enhanced if infection is asymptomatic, and thus, mass media messages that encourage social distancing will be ever more important.",

Transition probability from state to state is called the infinitesimal transition probability, the change in time is sufficiently small that only one event occurs in the time period, and depends only on the state of the system at the previous time: Markov property. The probability of a transition can be described by Eq (13) From the equations for the infinitesimal transition probabilities, Eq (14), we can derive the forward Kolmogorov differential equations. From the forward Kolmogorov differential equation we derive a probability generating function (pgf), a moment generating function (mgf) and finally the differential equations for the mean and higher order moments. The derivation for the forward Kolmogorov differential equation from Eq (14), representing the rate of change of the transitions from state to state follows. The first step is to derive a discrete equation from Eq (14) for sufficiently small \u0394t for p i,j,k,l (t + \u0394t), the transition probability, p i;j;k;l \u00f0t \u00fe Dt\u00de \u00bc lp i\u00c01;j;k;l \u00f0t\u00deDt \u00fe b\u00f0i \u00fe 1\u00dekp i\u00fe1;j\u00c01;k;l \u00f0t\u00deDt \u00fed\u00f0i \u00fe 1\u00dep i\u00fe1;j;k;l Dt \u00fe s\u00f0j \u00fe 1\u00dep i;j\u00fe1;k\u00c01;l \u00f0t\u00deDt \u00fed\u00f0j \u00fe 1\u00dep i;j\u00fe1;k;l \u00f0t\u00deDt \u00fe g\u00f0k \u00fe 1\u00dep i;j;k\u00fe1;l\u00c01 \u00f0t\u00deDt \u00fed\u00f0k \u00fe 1\u00dep i;j;k\u00fe1;l \u00f0t\u00deDt \u00fe d\u00f0l \u00fe 1\u00dep i;j;k;l\u00fe1 \u00f0t\u00deDt \u00fe\u00f01 \u00c0 \u00f0l \u00fe bik \u00fe di \u00fe sj \u00fe dj \u00fe gk \u00fe dk \u00fe dl\u00de\u00dep i;j;k;l \u00f0t\u00deDt; \u00f015\u00de where p i,j,k,l (t) represents the probability of a susceptible, exposed, infectious and recovered population of size i, j, k, and l, respectively.
