Examination of RNA expression of known surface receptors that bind and internalize filoviruses demonstrated that IL-4/IL-13 stimulated expression of the C-type lectin receptor DC-SIGN in human macrophages and addition of the competitive inhibitor mannan abrogated IL-4/IL-13 enhanced infection. Two murine DC-SIGN-like family members, SIGNR3 and SIGNR5, were upregulated by IL-4/IL-13 in murine macrophages, but only SIGNR3 enhanced virus infection in a mannan-inhibited manner, suggesting that murine SIGNR3 plays a similar role to human DC-SIGN.

Macrophages are important cell targets for the virus, yet infection of these cells remains poorly understood. Here, we show that macrophages stimulated with the immunomodulatory cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 are significantly more susceptible than unstimulated cells to a model virus that expresses the Ebola virus glycoprotein. These cytokines increase virus entry by enhancing the expression of the cell surface receptors DC-SIGN in humans and SIGNR3 in mice. Blocking availability of those receptors reduced virus load. Consistent with an important role for macrophages during EBOV infection, reconstitution of mice with macrophages treated with IL-4 and IL-13 exacerbated virus pathogenesis. Our studies argue for the critical importance of the macrophages and their response to immunomodulatory cytokines in controlling the pathological consequences of Ebola virus glycoprotein-dependent infections and highlight an important aspect of filovirus/ macrophage interaction that if controlled could decrease virus pathogenesis.

All but Reston are pathogenic to humans and endemic in Africa. This genus is one of two extant genera that compose the family Filoviridae, with Marburgvirus being the other. Ebola virus disease (EVD) in humans is difficult to diagnose as it results initially in nonspecific symptoms common to a number of infectious agents endemic to Africa. Symptoms ultimately progress to a severe hemorrhagic fever with case fatality rates ranging from 25-90% [1, 2] . Historically, EBOV has caused sporadic outbreaks in Central Africa; however, the 2013-2016 epidemic in Western Africa demonstrated the potential of viral spread to other regions of Africa [3] . Most recently, a smaller, but persistent EBOV outbreak is ongoing in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, highlighting the continued re-emergence of this pathogen. No targeted therapeutics have come to market, with little more than supportive care currently available to patients [4] .",

Filoviruses enter susceptible cells by interactions with several different cell surface receptors that mediate virion attachment and internalization into the endosomal compartment. Two different groups of cell surface receptors are known to mediate filovirus uptake: phosphatidylserine (PS) receptors, such as the TIM and TAM family of proteins, and C-type lectin receptors (CLRS) that bind to glycans on the heavily glycosylated viral glycoprotein (GP) [5, 6] . To date, five different PS receptors and five CLRs have been shown to facilitate filovirion uptake [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . Binding to these receptors mediates uptake of virions into endosomes where the filovirus GP is proteolytic processed [12, 13] . Cleaved GPs interact with the cognate receptor NPC1 within the late endosomal/lysosomal compartment [14] . While NPC1 binding is required for filovirus entry, studies suggest at least one additional step is required to trigger membrane fusion events [14, 15] . Given the redundancy of attachment/internalization receptors and ubiquitous expression of endosomal proteases and NPC1, it is not surprising that a wide range of host cells are susceptible to infection, including macrophages.",

            "text": "Macrophages are known to play a critical role in EBOV pathogenesis. These cells are one of the initial cell types infected by EBOV and are targets throughout the course of infection, facilitating systemic dissemination of the virus [16] [17] [18] [19] . Infection of macrophages results in aberrant production of proinflammatory cytokines, synthesis and secretion of vasoactive peptides disrupting vascular permeability, and recruitment of additional susceptible cells to the site of infection. This creates a positive feedback loop to allow further viral replication and systemic spread [20] . However, macrophages are not phenotypically homogenous; rather, they adopt a broad spectrum of phenotypes depending on their microenvironment, including the cytokines to which they are exposed [21] . Their remarkable phenotypic plasticity in response to cytokines and other stimuli is referred to as \"macrophage polarization\". M1 or classically activated macrophages are elicited by exposure to proinflammatory signals such as interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3). M2 or alternatively activated macrophages are immunomodulatory macrophages and elicited by signals such as the cytokines IL-4, IL-10, IL-13 and TGF-\u03b2, as well as additional immunosuppressive chemicals such as glucocorticoids or combination treatments of immune complexes (IC) and bacterial LPS [22] . Importantly these cells perform disparate functions in the body. M1 macrophages upregulate expression of a number of proinflammatory genes such as CXCL10, IL-12 subunits, IL-1\u03b2, TNF, and IL-6 and mediate clearance of pathogens. M2 macrophages produce a number of immunomodulatory compounds and promote resolution of inflammation and wound healing. More recently, it has become clear that the classification of M2 is insufficient to describe the unique and specific expression profiles induced by disparate anti-inflammatory stimuli. As a result the field has moved towards subdividing the M2 macrophage populations and frequently refer to the polarization by the specific stimulus administered to elicit the unique and characteristic macrophage phenotype [21] . Thus, IL-4/ IL-13 treatment is referred to as IL-4/IL-13 or M2a polarization, whereas, IC/LPS or dexamethasone treatments are frequently referred as M2b or M2c polarization, respectively.",

Studies in our lab have demonstrated that IFN-\u03b3 treatment, resulting in M1 polarization of human or mouse macrophages, inhibits EBOV infection and in vivo IFN-\u03b3 administered as late as 24 hours following EBOV challenge abrogates morbidity and mortality [33] . These findings provide evidence that eliciting a proinflammatory state at early times during filovirus infection can control filovirus replication. However, tissue macrophages of many West and Central African individuals may not manifest a strong proinflammatory phenotype during early filovirus infection due to other infections. For example, helminth infections are common in this region and they induce a systemic M2/Th2 response, pushing the immune response towards an anti-inflammatory phenotype [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] . Further, while there is no evidence that filovirus infection directly pushes macrophages towards an M2-like state, it is known that filoviruses encode an IFN-\u03b3 antagonist that would be predicted to block effective M1 polarization [39, 40] . Thus, it is important to understand the effect of M2-like macrophage polarization on filovirus infection.",

Also, the M2 stimulus, IL-10, exacerbates EBOV infection as IL-10 knockout mice have reduced EBOV load in some organs at late times during infection and have better survival than wild-type mice [42] .

In these studies, we primarily use BSL-2 recombinant VSV encoding EBOV GP (rVSV/EBOV GP) as a costeffective and safe surrogate model of EBOV infection. This recombinant virus has been used by numerous groups to study filovirus entry and offers the distinct advantage of allowing filovirus entry studies to be performed outside of BSL-4 laboratories [14, 33, 41, 43, 44] . Administration of IL-4/IL-13 to macrophages significantly enhanced EBOV GP-dependent viral particle binding and internalization with increases in overall infection. IL-4/IL-13 also increased surface expression of several C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) on human monocyte derived macrophages or murine peritoneal macrophages, including DC-SIGN on human macrophages and SIGNR3 on mouse macrophages. Enhanced IL-4/IL-13-mediated infection was blocked by mannan, indicating that mannose-binding CLRs, such as DC-SIGN, are responsible for the increased virus infection. Ectopic expression of these receptors in poorly permissive cells increased rVSV/EBOV GP entry, but other related CLRs did not. IL-4/IL-13 that was administered to mice prior to rVSV/EBOV GP challenge increased virus-associated mortality. Further, transfer of ex vivo IL-4/IL-13-stimulated peritoneal macrophages to na\u00efve mice enhanced rVSV/EBOV GP pathogenesis. In total, these studies demonstrate that IL-4/IL-13 polarization of macrophages generates a macrophage that is highly susceptible for EBOV entry and infection through enhancement of cell surface CLRs, and further highlight the importance of macrophages in the pathogenesis of EBOV.",

As both viruses encoded GFP in their genomes, infectivity was assessed in some studies by the number of GFP+ cells in infected wells at 24 hours following infection. For these assays, cells were infected with a quantity of virus that achieved~10-20% GFP positivity in unstimulated cultures. This level of virus infection is in the linear range of the infection curve, allowing detection of subtle increases and decreases in viral infectivity. Approximate MOIs used in each study are noted in the figure legends.

While a large number of studies have used IL-4 and IL-13 to elicit the M2a phenotype in macrophages [31, 56, 57] , we verified in our primary cells of interest, murine resident peritoneal macrophages (pmacs), that changes in gene expression occurred that were reflective of functional macrophage polarization following IL-4/-13 treatment. We found changes consistent with those reported by others, allowing us to confidently utilize these cytokines to induce an M2a phenotype [58, 59] (S1 Fig). We next investigated the effect of these cytokines on the ability of both murine pmacs and human MDMs to support infection of rVSV/EBOV GP. We found that IL-4/IL-13-stimulated macrophages were more robustly infected by rVSV/ EBOV GP as compared to non-polarized controls, with a 3-4-fold increase in infection observed (Fig 1A and 1B) . In contrast, infection with rVSV/G, expressing native VSV G glycoprotein, was not enhanced by IL-4/IL-13 stimulation, suggesting that the increase in infection is specific to EBOV glycoprotein-expressing virus. To verify that the effect observed in murine pmacs was not impacted by the lack of type 1 interferon signaling, we performed a similar experiment in WT pmacs and found that IL-4/IL-13 treatment increased infection 2.5-fold, consistent with the effect observed in Ifnar -/cells (Fig 1C) .",

Pmacs or human MDMs were pretreated with IL-4/IL-13 for 24 hours and rVSV/EBOV GP was bound to cells at 4\u02daC to prevent virion internalization. Unbound virus was removed, total RNA was isolated, and the quantity of virus bound to the cells was assessed by qRT-PCR amplification of viral genomes. Virions bearing EBOV GP bound to IL-4/IL-13-treated macrophages more efficiently than to non-polarized macrophages (Fig 2A and 2B) , suggesting that M2 polarization enhanced surface expression of viral adhesion factors/receptors. To determine if virion fusion events were also enhanced in IL-4/IL-13-treated macrophages, EBOV virus like particles (VLPs) containing EBOV VP40 fused to \u03b2-lactamase [60] were assessed for fusion efficiency. EBOV VLP fusion events were measured in cells loaded with the fluorescent \u03b2-lactam containing dye, CCF2-AM, by flow cytometry as described by others [60, 61] . Pmacs exposed to IL-4/IL-13 were more susceptible to VLP fusion (Fig 2C) , demonstrating that enhanced entry, likely secondary to enhanced binding, is at least in part responsible for the increased infection observed in M2 macrophages. Importantly, VLPs expressing the native VSV glycoprotein exhibited no increase in fusion in IL-4/IL-13 treated pmacs, providing strong evidence that the increased entry in M2a pmacs is specific to the EBOV GP (Fig 2C) .",

            "text": "Enhanced virion binding and entry into IL-4/IL-13-treated cells suggested that one or more cell surface receptors used by filoviruses are upregulated. To evaluate this, the expression of genes encoding many of the known cell surface receptors used by EBOV was assessed by qRT-PCR in untreated or IL-4/IL-13-treated pmacs. The expression of the CLR, macrophage galactose binding lectin (MGL or CLEC10a), was upregulated~13-fold by IL-4/IL-13 treatment (Fig 3A) . In addition, two PS receptors, Tyro3 and TIM-4, and the critical endosomal receptor NPC1 were modestly enhanced, but expression of other known filovirus surface receptors was unchanged. Because expression of Tyro3 and TIM-4 were modestly increased in the presence of IL-4/IL-13, we incubated IL-4/IL-13 stimulated or unstimulated pmacs in the presence of liposomes composed of phosphatidylserine (PS). These liposomes competitively inhibit the PS-dependent attachment of EBOV to PS receptors, thereby blocking PS-dependent entry [48] . We found that IL-4/IL-13 enhanced virus infection of pmacs by about 3 to 3.5-fold, regardless of whether PS liposomes were present suggesting these receptors do not mediate the IL-4/IL-13-enhanced infection (S2 Fig). We also investigated IL-4/IL-13 upregulation of DC-SIGN on human MDMs as well as the murine orthologs on pmacs. IL-4/IL-13 treatment has been previously shown to upregulate expression of DC-SIGN on human dendritic cells [62] [63] [64] . Consistent with these reports, we found that human MDMs expressed significantly higher amounts of DC-SIGN RNA and the number of MDMs expressing DC-SIGN on their cell surface increased when stimulated with IL-4 and IL-13 (S3 Fig). Mice encode 8 potential DC-SIGN orthologs and reports differ on whether SIGNR1, 3 or 5 is most functionally similar to human DC-SIGN [65] [66] [67] . We found that IL-4/IL-13 treatment dramatically enhanced SIGNR3 and SIGNR5 RNA expression in pmacs, but not SIGNR1 (Fig 3B) , suggesting that SIGNR3 and/or SIGNR5 are similar to DC-SIGN in responsiveness to IL-4/IL-13. Additionally, the number of cells within the pmac population expressing cell surface CLRs, SIGNR3, SIGNR5, and MGL, were enhanced by the cytokine treatment; however, neither SIGNR1 nor the PS receptor, TIM-4, were increased (Fig 3C) . Parallel surface staining studies were unable to detect expression of Tyro3. These data suggested that CLRs may be responsible for enhanced EBOV GP-dependent entry into IL-4/-13 treated pmacs.",

These results, in conjunction with earlier qRT-PCR The effect of M2a polarization on Ebola virus entry data, strongly suggest that DC-SIGN/SIGNR3 upregulation mediates increased rVSV/EBOV GP susceptibility in M2a polarized murine macrophages.

            "text": "While the impact of IL-4/IL-13 upregulation of mannose-binding CLRs such as SIGNR3 on virus infection of pmacs is statistically significant, it is a modest effect. We postulated that one possible explanation for the limited enhancement by IL-4/IL-13 of virus infection in pmacs is that other receptors utilized by EBOV are also available and utilized in pmacs. Thus, we investigated the use of another source of primary macrophages, the bone marrow, and found that bone marrow derived, M-CSF matured macrophages (BMDMs) poorly support rVSV/EBOV GP infection. Further IL-4/IL-13 stimulation does not upregulate SIGNR3 expression or enhance infection (S5 Fig). Hence, we returned to the use of pmacs. Murine pmacs not only express SIGNR3 upon IL-4/-13 treatment, but constitutively express the PS receptor TIM-4 [47] , that has been shown to serve as a filovirus receptor in HEK 293T cells [51, 70] . We investigated if constitutive, high level TIM-4 expression mediates filovirus entry into pmacs, making SIGNR3-dependent virus uptake redundant and thereby reducing the impact of SIGNR3 expression on filovirus infection. To test this, we evaluated TIM-4 expression and observed strong expression on pmacs, but no expression on BMDMs (Fig 5A) . We also observed that pmacs from TIM-4-sufficient mice supported higher levels of viral infection that those from Timd-4 -/mice, whereas there was no difference in susceptibility of wild-type versus Timd-4 -/-BMDMs (Fig 5B and 5C ). VLP fusion events were also significantly decreased in pmacs from Timd-4 -/mice when compared to TIM-4-sufficient pmacs (Fig 5D) , showing the importance of TIM-4 as a receptor for EBOV in pmacs. These observations explain the poor susceptibility of BMDMs previously observed (S5 Fig). However, as TIM-4 expression was not enhanced by IL-4/IL-13 treatment (Fig 3A) , this receptor cannot be responsible for the increase in virus infection mediated by IL-4/IL-13.",

We administered the M2a polarizing stimulus IL-4/IL-13 i.p. and, in parallel, the M1 polarizing stimulus IFN-\u03b3 was also tested for its effect. After 24 hours, peritoneal cells (consisting primarily of macrophages, but also containing epithelial cells and other cell types) were isolated and changes in gene expression by qRT-PCR were assessed. We found that expression of the M1 marker gene IRF-1 was modestly increased in mice administered IFN-\u03b3, and that the M2a marker genes Fizz-1 and, in particular, SIGNR3 were increased in IL-4/IL-13 treated mice (S6 Fig).

The mice were monitored daily for survival. We found that in vivo M2a polarization of the TIM-4-sufficient mice elicited a modestly enhanced mortality (Fig 7A) , whereas rVSV/G challenge was equally virulent to PBS or IL-4/-13 treated mice (Fig 7B) . To evaluate the role of peritoneal macrophages in this in vivo phenotype, pmacs were harvested from mice 2 days post infection and viral load was assessed by qRT-PCR. We found that IL-4/ IL-13 enhanced in vivo infection of pmacs upon rVSV/EBOV GP challenge, but not rVSV/G ( Fig 7C) . These data suggested that in vivo IL-4/-13 administration increases virus load in an EBOV GP-dependent manner. In parallel, Ifnar/Timd-4 -/mice were challenged as we anticipated that these mice would be even more sensitive to the effect of IL-4/IL-13 treatment. In these studies,~100-fold higher concentrations of rVSV/EBOV GP were administered since we observed that TIM-4-null mice were decidedly less permissive for the virus and we observed that loss of TIM-4 protected mice from virus challenge (Fig 7D) . In Ifnar/Timd-4 -/mice, a dose of rVSV/EBOV GP that resulted in no mortality in the PBS-treated mice caused 100% mortality in IL-4/IL-13-treated mice (Fig 7E) . Because we recognize that in vivo administration of a large bolus of cytokine is likely to have additional effects on the immune response, we performed ex vivo polarization and adoptive transfer of IL-4/IL-13 treated macrophages prior to challenge of Ifnar/Timd-4 -/mice with rVSV/EBOV GP. As observed with in vivo polarization, these mice had increased mortality (Fig 7F) compared to mice receiving PBS-treated macrophages, although the adoptive transfer may have increased the sensitivity of the mice to virus since more than half of the PBS-treated mice also succumbed to virus infection under these conditions. Taken together these data provide evidence that M2a polarization exacerbates EBOV infection in vivo likely due to the enhanced infection of a critical cell population, peritoneal macrophages.",

In vivo administration of IL-4/IL-13 or addition of IL-4/IL-13-treated pmacs to Ifnar/Timd-4 -/mice resulted in greater viral pathogenesis as reflected in increased mortality. We further demonstrate both in vivo and in vitro that IL-4/IL-13 enhances EBOV GP specific entry, as rVSV/G infection of mice and pmacs were not altered by these cytokines. We propose that our findings extend to WT EBOV and potentially other filoviruses as the mechanism of entry is highly conserved.",

Mannose-binding CLRs, DC-SIGN in humans and SIGNR3 in mice, were increased on the surface of pmacs by a 24 h treatment with IL-4/IL-13. Expression of MGL, another CLR that can support EBOV binding and internalization [11, 73] , was also significantly upregulated by IL-4/IL-13 treatment. However, while mannose polymer, mannan, abrogated IL-4/IL-13 enhancement, the MGL ligand, GalNAc, did not, despite a similar level of receptor upregulation. This suggests that DC-SIGN/ SIGNR3 are more efficient receptors on macrophages, but does not inherently disagree with other reports that MGL can mediate entry in other contexts. We also note that there were changes in other potential receptors, including the endosomal receptor NPC1, that could contribute to the enhanced entry upon IL-4/IL-13 exposure, however studies with mannan suggest that mannose-binding CLRs are critical for this effect.",

            "text": "DC-SIGN has previously been shown to be a receptor for attachment and internalization of EBOV and not a receptor for VSV [8, 74] . However, attempts to identify mouse orthologs with functionality similar to DC-SIGN have met with limited success. Baribaud, et al (2001) cloned a murine cDNA that was initially proposed to be a functional murine ortholog [75] . This cDNA was shown to have 68% identity to human DC-SIGN and bound to ICAM-3 and HIV-1 and HIV-2 in a manner similar to human DC-SIGN [75] . However, the authors noted that expression of this cDNA did not result in efficient transmission of HIV to T cells in a mixed culture, suggesting this receptor did not entirely recapitulate the behavior of human DC-SIGN [75] . This murine cDNA was shown by others to encode murine SIGNR1 [66] . The murine CLR, CIRE or SIGNR5, was also evaluated as the murine homolog to human DC-SIGN [76] . However, SIGNR5 was not found to bind to EBOV GP and the authors concluded that mice do not have a DC-SIGN homolog that served as a cell surface receptor for EBOV. We find that both SIGNR1 (CD209b) and SIGNR3 (CD209d) are able to mediate virus entry, whereas SIGNR5 (CD209a) was a less effective receptor. These findings are consistent with the work by Gramberg et al [76] as well as previous studies that found that SIGNR1 and SIGNR3 bind mannose and complex mannose containing glycans in a manner similar to DC-SIGN and possess endocytic capabilities [77] , whereas SIGNR5 lacks that crucial endocytic function [66] . While both SIGNR1 and SIGNR3 mediated rVSV/EBOV GP infection, only SIGNR3 is upregulated when exposed to IL-4/IL-13. As additional evidence, we also show that IL-4/IL-13 exposure does not increase SIGNR3 expression in BMDMs and these polarized macrophages do not exhibit IL-4/-13-dependent enhancement of rVSV/EBOV GP infection. In total, these data provide strong evidence that SIGNR3 upregulation is a key component of the IL-4/IL-13-mediated increase in virus infection in murine macrophages. Thus, we propose that murine SIGNR3 functions in a similar manner to human DC-SIGN in the context of EBOV infection during M2a polarization. This role for SIGNR3 has not been previously recognized.",

A similar long repeat domain is absent in the murine proteins; the neck domains of SIGNR1 and SIGNR3 are shorter, contain-ing~100 and~68 residues, respectively. However, apparently the neck domain of SIGNR3 is sufficient for homo-oligomerization, as it has been shown to weakly form dimers upon ligand interaction [65] . An added structural issue with these CLRs is that an 8 amino acid motif composing the DC-SIGN carbohydrate binding domain is not completely conserved [81] [82] [83] , potentially resulting in reduced glycan binding.",

Disease states eliciting a strong Th2 response may skew macrophages to an \"M2\" phenotype, although many chronic diseases are complex and appreciated to elicit a mixed M1/ M2 phenotype under some circumstances [21] . Two well established disease states that elicit an M2-like phenotype are parasitic infections caused by roundworm and whipworms and tumors [84] . Worms elicit a strong type 2 immune response and may play an important role as a pre-existing condition during filovirus outbreaks. It is estimated that over 1 billion individuals worldwide are infected with parasitic worms, with the greatest prevalence in Sub-Saharan Africa where EBOV is co-endemic [85] . Furthermore, the WHO estimates that over 800 million children are in need of treatment from these pathogens, highlighting the prevalence of infection and difficulty in providing care. Given our findings that M2a cytokines elicit enhanced virus infection in macrophages, future studies are warranted to understand the role of helminth infections during EBOV co-infection as there may be profound clinical implications. Macrophages present in tumors (TAMs) also express an anti-inflammatory phenotype that is thought to help drive tumorigenesis [84, 86] . While no studies have investigated whether malignancies drive more robust filovirus replication, the loss of immune control combined with the enhanced presence of M2 polarized macrophages found during tumorigenesis would be anticipated to establish an in vivo setting conducive for filovirus infection.",

However, the effect of this interaction on macrophage polarization has not been directly examined. While LPS/TLR4 interactions can generate a M1 polarization state [22] , in combination with immune complexes LPS stimulates a M2b state [90] . Thus, it would be of interest to examine the effect of EBOV GP on macrophage gene expression.",

We have previously shown that ectopic expression of human and mouse TIM-4 in HEK 293T cells enhances rVSV/EBOV GP entry [50, 51] . While it is appreciated that tissue macrophage and dendritic cell populations express endogenous TIM-4 in both humans and mice [91, 92] , the role of this receptor in filovirus infection of those primary populations has not been previously reported. Two lines of evidence indicated that TIM-4 is important for EBOV infection of pmacs. First, infection of TIM-4-sufficient pmacs is inhibited by addition of PS liposomes and, second, virus infection of pmacs from Timd-4 -/is markedly lower inTIM-4-sufficient pmacs. Consistent with an important role for TIM-4 as a receptor in pmacs that can mask the effect of IL-4/IL-13 polarization, the effect of IL-4/IL-13 was notably enhanced when TIM-4 was absent. In total, our studies have been able to tease apart the multiple layers of host receptor-dependent events that drive filovirus entry and infection.",
