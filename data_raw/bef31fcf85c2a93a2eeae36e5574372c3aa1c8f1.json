Rhinovirus, a member of the genus Enterovirus, family Picornaviridae, is the leading cause of upper respiratory infection in the world; it is the most frequently detected virus in human infection worldwide [12, 13] . However, lower respiratory tract infections in infants and children associated with severe clinical manifestations caused by rhinovirus could be underestimated due to lack of screening. Predisposing factors and underlying conditions are known to contribute to rhinovirus-associated severe respiratory diseases [14] . One study reported the possible link between rhinoviruses and congenital heart disease [14] ; however, the causal role of rhinoviruses in cardiac conditions remains elusive. The genome of the virus is a positive sense ssRNA with approximately 7200 bp [15] , and classified at least into three groups of rhinoviruses: A, B and C. Rhinovirus C, detected in 2006, was classified as a new species in 2010 [16] . This group was known to be associated with more severe illness than rhinovirus A and B, and resistant to commonly used antiviral treatments for rhinovirus [17] . A number of studies have reported the association of rhinovirus C with increased wheezing, asthma exacerbations and lower respiratory tract infection in children [7] . The virus was also detected in the bronchoalveolar lavage specimen, pericardial fluid, plasma and stools of a 14-year-old patient with pericarditis [18] . However, the association of rhinovirus C with DCM or myocarditis is not well documented. Currently, there are about 55 different types of human rhinovirus C, with 13 % variability in VP1 and at least 10 % variability in VP4/VP2. Vaccine and specific viral therapies for rhinoviruses are not currently available, and treatment is primarily supportive [15] . Here, we report the viraemic detection of rhinovirus C in a 4-year-old boy with acute onset DCM, suggesting a likely possible causative role of this virus in severe cardiac disease.",

The patient received treatment in a primary care centre before being admitted to hospital. On examination, he was tachypnoeic and pale, with clammy extremities. His heart rate was 90 beats min \u00c01 , respiratory rate 30 breaths min \u00c01 , blood pressure 100/60 mmHg and temperature 37 C. There was a mild face and lower limb oedema. On cardiac examination, there was decreased cardiac impulse on palpation. Heart sounds were muffled and no murmur was heard. His liver was palpable 3 cm below the costal angle. Pulses were palpable and equal in all four extremities. Laboratory examinations revealed a normal haemoglobin level of 132 g l \u00c01 with a slightly increased white blood cell count (15 900 cells mm \u00c03 ), whereas the platelet count was within normal limits (342 000 platelets mm \u00c03 ). Unfortunately, cardiac markers such as troponin, creatinine kinase (CK) and its MB isoenzyme (CK-MB) were not tested due to limited resources. Chest X-ray showed cardiomegaly with congested lungs. Electrocardiography (ECG) revealed a sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 136 beats min \u00c01 . There was a normal P wave with slightly prolonged PR interval (>0.2 s). The QRS axis was normal and a possible left ventricular hypertrophy. There was no obvious ST change.

Sequencing the 400 bp UTR indicated the presence of rhinovirus C genetic material. Further characterization of this Indonesian strain rhinovirus C was conducted using PCR with primers targeting the VP4/VP2 gene. The 390 bp VP4/VP2 sequence that was obtained and compared to an online nucleotide database using BLASTN (National Center for Biotechnology Information) showed 96-97 % similarity with the closest strain isolated in Ulaanbaatar (Mongolia) and Japan in 2012. Other infections associated with myocarditis, such as dengue, chikungunya, coxsackievirus, herpesvirus, paramyxovirus, coronavirus and influenza, were ruled out. Virus isolation was not attempted, as rhinovirus C could not be propagated in regular epithelial cells or immortalized cell lines [21] . The sequence has been submitted to GenBank with accession number KY379152 (Fig. 1) . ",

Also, we were not able to exclude other possible causes of myocarditis, such as adenovirus, parvovirus B19 and hepatitis C virus, or autoimmune disease and environmental toxins, although the clinical picture was not consistent with the latter two causes.
