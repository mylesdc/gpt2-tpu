            "text": "Viroporins are viral proteins with ion channel (IC) activity that play an important role in several processes, including virus replication and pathogenesis. While many coronaviruses (CoVs) encode two viroporins, severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) encodes three: proteins 3a, E, and 8a. Additionally, proteins 3a and E have a PDZ-binding motif (PBM), which can potentially bind over 400 cellular proteins which contain a PDZ domain, making them potentially important for the control of cell function. In the present work, a comparative study of the functional motifs included within the SARS-CoV viroporins was performed, mostly focusing on the roles of the IC and PBM of E and 3a proteins. Our results showed that the full-length E and 3a proteins were required for maximal SARS-CoV replication and virulence, whereas viroporin 8a had only a minor impact on these activities. A virus missing both the E and 3a proteins was not viable, whereas the presence of either protein with a functional PBM restored virus viability. E protein IC activity and the presence of its PBM were necessary for virulence in mice. In contrast, the presence or absence of the homologous motifs in protein 3a did not influence virus pathogenicity. Therefore, dominance of the IC and PBM of protein E over those of protein 3a was demonstrated in the induction of pathogenesis in mice. Aguilella VM, Sola I, Enjuanes L. 2018.

            "text": "KEYWORDS coronavirus, PBM, PDZ, SARS-CoV, viroporins C oronaviruses (CoVs) are pathogens responsible for a wide range of existing and emerging diseases in humans and domestic or companion animals (1) . A CoV causing the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) was identified in Southeast China in 2002 and rapidly spread worldwide to more than 30 countries within 6 months, infecting more than 8,000 people, with mortality in approximately 10% of the cases (2, 3) . While SARS-CoV has not since reappeared in humans, other CoVs, including ones similar to SARS-CoV, are widely disseminated among bats circulating all over the world, making future outbreaks possible (4) (5) (6) . In fact, a novel CoV, the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), was identified in September 2012 in two human patients with severe respiratory disease in Saudi Arabia (7, 8) ; since then, the WHO has reported 2,144 laboratory-confirmed cases and at least 750 deaths (as of and virulence, in contrast with E protein, which required both for virulence (34, 46) . Protein 3a IC activity was characterized in planar lipid bilayers, showing that it forms non-voltage-gated ion channels. Furthermore, we identified residues located in TMD2 and TMD3 of the 3a protein that were involved in its IC activity. The potential interdependence of the three viroporins described in SARS-CoV was studied by deletion of single viroporins or of different combinations of two viroporins. The variant missing both the 3a and E proteins was not viable, indicating that the presence of at least one of the proteins is essential for virus viability. Furthermore, it was shown that either protein should maintain its PBM to compensate for the absence of the other full-length protein. These results suggest that PBMs interact with cellular proteins with PDZ domains to change cell metabolism, enhancing virus replication or pathogenicity. Identification and inhibition of specific cellular pathways affected by these interactions may be crucial for the identification of new antiviral strategies.",

Analysis of the growth kinetics of each mutant in Vero E6 cell supernatants (Fig. 1A ) was used to determine their requirement for replication. Cell-associated virus was also analyzed at 24 and 48 h postinfection (hpi), showing results similar to those observed for the released virus (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). The \u03943a and \u0394E mutants grew to lower titers than the parental wild-type (wt) virus (Fig. 1A) . However, while the \u0394E mutant showed 100-fold-lower titers (around 8 \u03eb 10 5 PFU/ml), \u03943a titers decreased slightly (3-fold) (3 \u03eb 10 7 PFU/ml).

However, as the relevance of the IC activity of the 3a protein was not known, we studied 3a protein in planar lipid bilayers and identified the amino acids involved in ion conductance. This system was used because its high sensitivity allows the detection of electric currents of a single ion channel (50) . To this end, a baculovirus was engineered to express the parental 3a protein in Sf-9 cells. Conductance of purified protein 3a was evaluated in the presence of KCl in planar lipid bilayers with a biologically relevant mix of 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC)/1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-L-serine (DOPS)/1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE) with ratios of 3:1:1 (wt/wt), which is a composition similar to that of intracellular organelle membranes, such as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi intermediate compartment (ER-GIC). Single-channel conductance was estimated from a statistical analysis of the current jump amplitudes. This procedure allows a reliable estimate of the most probable value of current change every time a new channel is inserted or disappears. Although several channels were being inserted, the magnitude of the current through a single channel could be discriminated. Current jumps corresponding to 201 inde- cells were infected with wild-type (WT) (black filled circles), \u0394E (blue filled squares), \u03943a (red filled circles), and \u03948a (green filled diamonds) SARS-CoV at a MOI of 0.001. Culture supernatants were collected at 4, 24, 48, and 72 hpi and titrated by plaque assay. The results are representative of three replicate experiments. (B) Groups of six 16-week-old BALB/c mice were infected with 100,000 PFU of either the parental virus (WT, black columns) or genetically engineered viruses lacking E protein (\u0394E, blue columns), 3a protein (\u03943a, red columns), or 8a protein (\u03948a, green columns).

Histograms of the current jump amplitudes of the recorded traces showed that the most frequent events corresponded to single-channel conductance of 16 pA ( Fig. 3A and B). Simultaneous bursts of two or three 3a ion channels were also observed, although with much lower frequency (Fig. 3B) .",

By comparing the measured E rev to the theoretical E rev that would be obtained in the case of a neutral pore (i.e., representing only the difference between cation and anion intrinsic mobilities), the selectivity of the ion channel can be inferred. The theoretical E rev is calculated using the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz (GHK) equation, replacing the permeability ratio P \u03e9 /P \u03ea by the solution diffusion coefficient ratio D \u03e9 /D \u03ea (53). Higher, lower, or similar measured E rev values indicate anion selectivity, cation selectivity, or no selectivity, respectively.

To begin to understand the nature of the replacement of E protein by 3a, or vice versa, in the replication of SARS-CoV, we assessed the cellular localization of each protein. The SARS-CoV E protein localizes to the ERGIC (56), but less is known about protein 3a localization (27) . The potential colocalization of the 3a and E proteins was first studied by infecting Vero E6 cells with wt rSARS-CoV. Confocal microscopy analysis of rSARS-CoV-MA15 at 24 hpi showed that the proteins were located in different cell subcompartments during infection, as the Pearson's coefficient value was below 0.6 (see Table S1 in the supplemental material) (57); protein 3a mainly accumulated at an unidentified perinuclear compartment different from the ERGIC (Fig. 8A ). E protein IC activity promotes virulence by releasing calcium from the ERGIC, leading to inflammasome activation (34, 58) . We showed that protein 3a IC activity is not involved in virus virulence. To extend these results, we next determined whether 3a was localized to any of the known cellular calcium reservoirs, i.e., the ER, the Golgi apparatus, and the mitochondria (59), using specific markers, including protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) (ER marker), 58 K (Golgi marker), and aconitase 2 (mitochondrion marker) (Fig. 8B) . Also, other subcellular compartments were analyzed for colocalization with the 3a protein by the use of antibodies (Abs) against Na \u03e9 /K \u03e9 ATPase (plasma membrane marker), Rab5 (early endosome marker), Rab7 (late endosome marker), and LAMP-1 (lysosome marker) (Fig. 9 ). Pearson's coefficient was below 0.6 in all cases (Table S1 ). Overall, 3a protein did not localize at any of the main intracellular calcium storage locations, suggesting that it is not located at a site that facilitates increased cytosolic calcium levels. Collectively, these results suggest that the IC activity of proteins 3a and E, while shared by the two proteins, is not the function responsible for the replacement for the full-length E and 3a proteins.",

An additional mutant was generated in which the protein 3a PBM was mutated in the context of full-length E protein deletion [(3a-PBM \u03ea ,\u0394E)], but the rescue of this virus was not possible (Fig. 10B) , again showing the necessity of at least one of the two proteins with a functional PBM for virus viability in the context of complete deletion of either the E gene or the 3a gene.

To analyze the relevance of protein shortening or folding, an additional mutant was constructed in the \u03943a background by filling in the E\u03944 deletion with an alanine-rich sequence in order to restore the original length or folding of the E protein [(\u03943a,E\u03944*)] (Fig. S2 ).

All three PBM mutants were viable, showing that the consequences of the presence of E and 3a protein PBMs when these proteins have been completely deleted are different from those seen when only their PBM is missing. However, virus titers decreased 10-fold when both viral PBMs were missing in comparison to the levels seen with the parental virus or mutants lacking only one PBM (Fig. 11A) . Remarkably, when PBM was present in E protein, the virus was highly virulent independently of whether the 3a protein included a PBM (Fig. 11B) . In contrast, mortality significantly decreased when E protein lacked a PBM, regardless of the presence or absence of a PBM within protein 3a. These results indicated that the impact of the presence or absence of the E protein PBM on virulence is definitive, as it determines whether a virus is pathogenic or nonpathogenic, respectively. In contrast, the presence or absence of 3a protein with or without its PBM had little impact on virus virulence, illustrating the much greater relevance of the E protein PBM than of the 3a PBM with respect to virus pathogenicity.",

Here, we show that removal of the 3a protein slightly reduced virus titers in vitro compared to the results seen with the parental virus (Fig. 1A) . In contrast, the titers of the \u03943a mutant were reduced 10-fold in vivo (Fig. 1B) , indicating that the 3a protein was required for optimal SARS-CoV replication. This result is in agreement with previous studies showing a slight reduction of SARS-CoV-\u03943a titers in Vero E6 cells (62) . Nevertheless, it has to be noted that the mice in the previous study were infected with a human SARS-CoV Urbani strain, which causes only a mild murine infection, in contrast to our mouse-adapted strain (61) . The reduction of titers after infection with \u03943a mutant viruses may reflect the role of 3a in membrane rearrangement, increasing the levels of intracellular vesicles that can promote nonlytic release of viral particles (30) . Alternatively, protein 3a may induce apoptosis (30, 63) and may enhance inflammation by activating nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB), leading to the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-8 (IL-8) and RANTES (CCL5) (29) . In fact, histopathological analysis of lungs from SARS-CoV-\u03943a-infected mice showed minimal damage or cellular infiltration at 2 and 4 dpi, whereas mice infected with the SARS-CoV parental virus revealed interstitial and peribronchial cell infiltration and edema in both alveolar and bronchiolar airways at 2 dpi and, mainly, at 4 dpi (see Fig. S3 in the supplemental material). This suggests that the attenuation of the \u03943a mutant may be due to its inability to activate an exacerbated proinflammatory response, resulting in survival of infected mice. In fact, similar results were obtained in the lungs of mice infected with rSARS-CoV-MA15-\u0394E, which also led to attenuation by downregulation of the host proinflammatory response (61, 64) .",

We previously reported that the E ion channel activates the inflammasome through calcium release from intracellular stores (34, 58) . IC activity of SARS-CoV E protein is exerted in the membrane of the ERGIC. This facilitates the release of Ca 2\u03e9 from this intracellular compartment, which contributes to the activation of the inflammasome complex, leading to the release of proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u2423), IL-1\u2424, and IL-6. The accumulation of these cytokines promotes an exacerbated proinflammatory response, which leads to death. Thus, E protein IC activity is a virulence factor similar to the IC activities of M2 from influenza virus (19) or rotavirus NSP4 (13, 66) . As E protein IC activity promotes virulence via inflammasome activation (34, 58) , we hypothesized that protein 3a IC activity could act in a similar way. However, as no correlation was found between protein 3a IC activity and SARS-CoV titer and pathogenicity, we conclude that, in our mouse model, the IC activity of 3a protein did not affect replication and virulence in the same way as that of E protein. However, SARS-CoV 3a protein TMD3 \u03ea and TMD [2, 3] \u03ea mutants displayed no IC activity and were attenuated. In principle, a possible explanation for this observation is that the TMD3 \u03ea three-amino-acid mutations present in both mutant TMD3 \u03ea and mutant TMD [2, 3] \u03ea could have disrupted a function of the 3a protein other than its IC activity. Nevertheless, viruses that included the point mutations that disrupt IC activity (Y91A, H93A, and Y109A) and which are less likely to affect other functions of the 3a protein than the 3-amino-acid and 5-amino-acid mutations of TMD3 \u03ea and TMD [2, 3] \u03ea , respectively, were completely virulent. The TMD3 \u03ea mutant showed 10-fold-lower titers in the lungs of infected mice. The impact of these mutants on virus replication and virulence may in principle be due to an exclusive effect on 3a protein functions different from its IC activity. The TMD [2, 3] \u03ea mutant maintained the same titers as the native virus, which could be explained if the mutations in TMD2 were structurally compensated for the ones in TMD3 when the two were simultaneously present in protein 3a. Overall, these results indicate that protein 3a IC activity is not involved in virus virulence.",

There are 266 motifs present in more than 400 cellular protein isoforms, each containing between 1 and 13 PDZ domains (42) . As SARS-CoV E and 3a protein PBM sequences are different (DLLV and SVPL, respectively), they are likely to interact with different networks of PDZ-containing cellular proteins. The protein 3a PBM interaction with cellular PDZ proteins most likely induces a signaling pathway that either is not pathogenic for the host or is activated at a lower intensity due to a reduced affinity of the viral PBM for the cellular PDZ domain, explaining why viruses with or without the PBM of 3a showed no significant differences in pathogenicity.

The 8a protein was included to determine its potential relevance in the absence of the other viroporins, showing a significant impact on viral growth under conditions in which 3a protein or E protein was absent. In contrast, we observed that SARS-CoV was not viable when both the 3a and E proteins were absent but that its viability was rescued by the presence of either 3a or E. We showed that the E protein could compensate for the loss of the other viroporin providing that it carried a functional PBM (Fig. 10A) , a conclusion reinforced by the results obtained with five different recombinant viruses. Even more biologically relevant was the rapid reversion of a stop codon introduced 9 aa upstream of the carboxy terminus of the E protein in mutant \u0394PBM. Reversion was identified only in this mutant, presumably because reversion of a single altered codon occurs more easily than the 4-aa changes in E-PBM \u03ea or the deletions performed (Fig. 10A) . Our results also showed that a 3a protein carrying a PBM could compensate for the loss of E protein and could restore virus replication but not virulence ( Fig. 10B and 11) .",

In addition, when SARS-CoV-\u0394E was passaged in mice, it spontaneously gained an internal PBM in the 8a protein. PBMs are also phylogenetically conserved in proteins from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV isolates from humans, civet cats, dromedary camels, and bats (Fig. S4) , further reinforcing the idea of the relevance of PBMs for coronavirus viability. Viral PBM-cellular PDZ interactions have been previously described in several viruses. For instance, the PBM of E6 oncoprotein from human papillomavirus 16 (HPV-16) interacts with several cellular proteins containing PDZ motifs, leading to tumorigenesis and virus dissemination (69) . On the other hand, different strains of rabies virus (RABV) include a variety of PBMs in the G protein that differentially contribute to viral virulence through activation of a variety of signaling pathways (70) . In the case of influenza virus, NS1 protein has a PBM located at its carboxy terminus that is possibly involved in enhanced virulence (71) .

Viruses with mutations in SARS-CoV viroporins E, 3a, and 8a were constructed in an infectious cDNA clone of SARS-CoV-MA15 within a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) (plasmid pBAC-SARS-CoV-MA15) (49, 73, 76) . Generation of the E deletion mutant was described previously (61) . The 3a gene was deleted by overlap extension PCR using pBAC-SARS-CoV-MA15 and the primers shown in Table S2 in the supplemental material. Mutations included deletion of a region (nt 25270 to 25668) of the SARS-CoV genome, resulting in deletion of the 3a protein while retaining the 3b protein; a disruption of the ATG start codon of the 3a gene; and point mutations at nt 25673 and codon. A PCR product was generated from nt 24937 to 26060 of the SARS-CoV genome, digested at flanking SwaI and BamHI sites, and cloned into intermediate plasmid pBAC-SARS-PmeI-BamHI-SARS-CoV (which contains the nt-18404-to-26044 sequence of the SARS-CoV infectious cDNA clone) to generate plasmid pBAC-SARS-PmeI-BamHI-\u03943a. Finally, that plasmid was digested with PmeI and BamHI and the fragment carrying the 3a deletion was reinserted into a similarly digested pBAC-SARS-CoV-MA15 plasmid to generate pBAC-SARS-CoV-\u03943a. To construct the 8a deletion mutant, a DNA fragment containing nt 26790 to 28753 of the SARS-CoV genome flanked by restriction sites XcmI and NheI was assembled by overlap extension PCR using pBAC-SARS-CoV-MA15 as the template and the primers indicated in Table S1 ; this process resulted in the deletion of the first 82 nt of the 8a gene without affecting the 8b gene. The final PCR products were digested with XcmI and NheI and cloned into intermediate plasmid pBAC-BamHI-RsrII-SARS-CoV (which contains nt 26044 to 29782 of the SARS-CoV infectious cDNA clone [49] ), thus obtaining pBAC-BamHI-RsrII-SARS-CoV-\u03948a. That plasmid was digested with BamHI and RsrII, and the fragment carrying the deletion of the 8a gene was reinserted into pBAC-SARS-CoV-MA15, generating pBAC-SARS-CoV-\u03948a.",

The potential was defined as positive when it was higher on the cis side, whereas the trans side was set to ground. An Axopatch 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) was used in the voltage-clamp mode to measure the current and the applied potential. The chamber and the head stage were isolated from external noise sources with a double metal screen (Amuneal Manufacturing Corp., Philadelphia, PA). Single-channel conductance data were obtained from current measurements under conditions of an applied potential of \u03e9100 mV and were evaluated using the Gaussian fit tool of Sigma plot 12 (Systat Software, Inc.).",

Second, one or several channels were inserted into the bilayer and a net ionic current appeared due to the concentration gradient. Third, the ionic current through the channel or channels was manually set to zero by adjusting the applied potential. The potential needed to achieve zero current was then corrected using values corresponding to the liquid junction potentials of the electrode salt bridges (78) to obtain the final E rev .",

At 24 hpi, the medium was removed and cells were washed twice with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde-PBS for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were subsequently washed twice with PBS, permeabilized for 10 min with ice-cold methanol, and then blocked with PBS containing 10% FBS for 40 min at room temperature. Immunofluorescence was performed using mouse Abs specific for SARS-CoV E protein (generated as described in reference 56) (1:500), protein disulfide isomerase (PDI; Abcam, Inc.) (1:500), 58 K (Abcam, Inc.) (1:100), aconitase 2 (Abcam, Inc.)

Primary antibodies were diluted in PBS containing 5% FBS and incubated for 90 min at room temperature, and then coverslips were washed four times with PBS before incubation with secondary antibodies was performed. Alexa 488-or Alexa 546-conjugated antibodies specific for the different species (Invitrogen) were diluted 1:500 in PBS containing 5% FBS and incubated for 45 min at room temperature. Nuclei were stained using DAPI (4=,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; Sigma) (1:200), and coverslips were mounted in ProLong Gold anti-fade reagent (Invitrogen) and examined on a Leica SP5 confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems, Inc.). Image analysis was performed using ImageJ (79) and the JACoP plug-in (57) . Three areas per image of 120 by 120 pixels with high accumulation of 3a protein were analyzed to determine Pearson's coefficient (Pc). Pc values below 0.6 were considered negative for colocalization. Partial colocalization was considered to have occurred for Pc values between 0.6 and 0.85. Pc values between 0.85 and 1 were considered positive for colocalization.",

Changes to the E protein included the following: alanine substitutions in the N-terminal domain [rSARS-CoV-MA15-(\u03943a,E\u03941)]; disruption of the TMD, abrogating E protein IC activity [(\u03943a,E-N15A)]; short in-frame deletions throughout the C-terminal domain [(\u03943a,E\u03942), (\u03943a,E\u03943), (\u03943a,E\u03944), (\u03943a,E\u03945), and (\u03943a,E\u03946)]; truncation of the E protein by introduction of a stop codon 6 aa upstream of the PBM [(\u03943a,E-\u0394PBM)]; interruption of the E protein PBM by amino acid substitutions within its core sequence [(\u03943a,E-PBM \u03ea )]; and replacement of the E protein PBM with an alternative PBM sequence [(\u03943a,E-PBM*)]. The \u0394PBM(rev) sequence represents the sequence of a spontaneous revertant virus isolated after growth of the original \u0394PBM strain in cell culture. (B) Viability of SARS-CoV \u0394E mutants with or without 3a protein PBM was evaluated in Vero E6 cells. Titers of the viable viruses after the first passage (representative of three replicate experiments) are shown. Data represent means \u03ee SD.",
