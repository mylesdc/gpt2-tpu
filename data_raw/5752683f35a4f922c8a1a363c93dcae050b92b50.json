However, these methods with the Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices (KAP) model do not always work. Therefore, we used the theory of planned behavior (TPB) to understand dog owners' behavior and distinguished the knowledge effect as objective knowledge (OK) and subjective knowledge (SK). A total of 310 dog owners completed a questionnaire based on our model. We employed structural equation modeling to verify the structural relationships and found three main results. First, our model was fit, and each path was significant. People with better attitudes, stronger subjective norms, and more perceptive behavioral control have stronger behavioral intention. Second, perceived behavioral control, not attitude, was the best predictive index in this model. Finally, on perceived behavioral control, subjective knowledge showed more influence than objective knowledge. We successfully extended TPB to explain the behavioral intention of dog owners and presented more workable recommendations. To reduce the latent social risk of disease, the government should not only address dog owners' attitudes, but also their OPEN ACCESS Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2014, 11 5935 subjective norms and perceptive behavioral control. Indeed, perceptive behavioral control and SK showed the most influence in this model. It is implied that the self-efficacy of dog owners is the most important factor in such a behavior. Therefore, the government should focus on enhancing dog owners' self-efficacy first while devoted to prevention activities.",

Conversely, the effective investigation of epidemic situations, a high vaccination rate (over 80%), and effective canine management are key factors in successfully controlling rabies infections. According to the report, since 1973, WHO has widely promoted two rabies prevention measures: broad vaccination programs and strict control of stray dogs. Among KAP-model promotions, improving knowledge and instilling positive attitudes toward prevention should be the main elements of a Taiwanese rabies-prevention campaign. However, Taiwan's current vaccination rate is only between 30% and 40% [4, 5] , far below WHO's 80% recommendation [2] . To close this gap, we focused on owners' intentions to vaccinate dogs and attempted to find the determinants for vaccinating against rabies in Taiwan. We had three main purposes: first, we argued that the KAP model's attitude concept should be extended to behavioral intention and that the theory of planned behavior (TPB) would be a suitable structural model for behavioral intention of vaccination against rabies because of its wide application in research on forecasting and building rational behavior. TPB has been used to predict, for instance, people's intention to vaccinate against influenza as well as many other health behaviors [6] . We used structural equation modeling (SEM) to verify that TPB can explain people's intention to vaccinate dogs against rabies [7] . Second, we argued that attitude is not the only key factor, or even the best factor, for understanding dog owners' behavioral intention. According to the low vaccination rate in Taiwan, we considered only improving knowledge and instilling a positive attitude are not enough to control the latent risk of rabies in Taiwan. By applying TPB to the intention of rabies vaccination, we described relationships among the variables to determine the best predictive index. Finally, we argued that the knowledge concept of the KAP model should be distinguished into two types, objective knowledge (OK) and subjective knowledge (SK). OK indicates the level of accurate information in one's cognition about the target; SK indicates the level of one's perceptions of what or how much one knows about the target [8, 9] . Azjen et al. [10] argued that knowledge, especially objective knowledge, would affect attitude and enhance self-efficacy (perceived behavioral control, PBC), but they did not test the correlation between subjective knowledge and TPB. Besides, we thought that especially SK, rather than OK, would be more likely to prompt people to vaccinate their dogs. In conclusion, we proposed to the government rabies prevention policies and suggestions for raising the vaccination rate through TPB, thus not only helping prevent a rabies outbreak in Taiwan but also preventing latent risk for similar situations.",

Descriptions of vaccination determinants have been mainly from physician perspectives, and past studies have often ignored those who actually make the decisions [15] . Hence, the limited success of these interventions clearly indicates the need for a fresh approach and new methods.",

Furthermore, vaccinating dogs is not only a personal act but also a social behavior involving moral perception. At least partly because authorities, such as WHO and the Center for Disease Control (CDC), have advocated epidemic prevention for several years; for some people, vaccinating dogs has become an ethical and moral act of socialization.",

The first is that intentions best predict behaviors, and the second is that human behavior is quite rational and employs the limited information available to the individual [21, 22] . In this theory, two independent factors determine one's intention: attitudes and subjective norms. Attitudes consist of general evaluations of behavioral performance and beliefs about the consequences of performing the behavior, weighted by an individual's evaluation of each consequence. Subjective norms reflect general perceptions of social pressure to perform the target behavior and are affected by the expectations of important referents, weighted by an individual's motivation to comply with each referent. Researchers have conducted many empirical studies on this topic over the past 30 years and provided evidence in support of TRA to explain health and social behavior [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] .",

Ajzen also proposed that perceived behavioral control affects behavior not only indirectly through intention but also directly [17, 29] . In fact, many theoretical and empirical studies provide evidence supporting TPB. In 1985, Ajzen presented \"From intentions to actions: A theory of planned behavior\" to open theoretical discussions about TPB. He theorized that the relationship between behavioral intention and behavior is stronger when perceived behavioral control is high. To provide a powerful foundation for TPB, he also presented arguments about social psychology [34] , organizational behavior [17] , self-efficacy [36] , laws of human behavior [37] , and the relationship between consumer attitudes and behavior [38] . In addition to this psychological research, Armitage and Conner argued that TPB can be applied to health behavior and also disseminated TPB to such fields as moral behavior, technological behavior, and exercise behavior [39] . These researchers found that TPB explained an average of 39% of the variance in intention and 27% of the variance in behavior.",

Nevertheless, the current study is one of only a few attempts to use TPB as a conceptual framework for vaccination, and more specifically, canine vaccination against rabies. This behavior involves morals, social impressions, and health concepts. Researchers have repeatedly used TPB to interpret moral behavior [40] , including behaviors of health promotion [41] , environmental friendliness [42] , and tax compliance [43] . In the social behavior domain, researchers used TPB to examine alcohol abuse [44] , volunteer behavior, substance use [45] , blood donations [18] , and others. In the health domain, TPB has explained various behaviors, for example, smoking [46] [47] [48] , giving up smoking [49] , and drinking [48, 50] . Researchers have also used TPB to predict a variety of attendance decisions for many types of health behaviors, including the decision to attend health checks and health clinics [51, 52] , breast cancer screenings [53] , and workplace health and safety courses [54] . Therefore, TPB could be the most powerful theory for predicting a rise in the rate of vaccination against rabies.",

Intentions are assumed to measure motivational factors that influence a behavior; they are indications of how hard people are willing to try and how much effort they are planning to exert to perform the behavior [17, 29] . Furthermore, intention is jointly determined by attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control in the TPB model. First, attitudes refer to the degree to which an individual favorably or unfavorably evaluates the behavior in question; second, subjective norms refer to social pressure to perform or not to perform the behavior; and, third, perceived behavioral control refers to whether the individual anticipates the action's performance as relatively easy or difficult. Presumably, this third measure reflects past experiences and anticipated hindrances. Generally speaking, a person with a more favorable attitude, more positive subjective norms, and higher perceived behavioral control has a stronger intention to perform the target behavior [17, 29] .",

Beside, Ajzen argued that individual behaviors sometimes could be predicted best by self-efficacy, especially while the behaviors need to be controlled [55, 56] . In taking a dog to receive the rabies vaccine, we also considered perceived behavioral control, not attitude, would be the best predictive index: H1: Attitude (A) toward the vaccination of rabies positively affects behavioral intention (BI). H2: Subjective norms (SN) about the vaccination of rabies positively affect BI. H3: Perceived behavioral control (PBC) over vaccination positively affects BI.

OK provides information and skill, reducing the impediment of bringing dogs to be vaccinated; SK enhances dog owners' self-efficacy so that they feel they can perform the behavior well. Therefore, we argued that people with higher levels of OK and SK will have higher perceived behavioral control. Furthermore, Azjen et al. [10] argued that knowledge would positively affect attitude and perceived behavioral control. However, they did not test the correlation between SK and TPB. Because SK combines knowledge and self-confidence, it is more important in problem-solving [61, 62] . Hence, we also argued that SK could affect dog owners' perceived behavioral control more than OK.

Besides, Ajzen argued that there could be some correlation among attitude, social norm and perceived behavioral control [17, 29] . Several literatures also found evidence to support the relations among these variables [64, 65] . Hence, according to the Modification Indices (MI), we opened the correlation among these variables in TPB. Finally, all indicators used to test the fitness of SEM models were acceptable (Table 4 ). It is shown that the fitness of our model was confirmed. Figure 2 illustrates the SEM results of our model. Almost all the paths and relations were significant, and the hypotheses were supported, except H5. For the A-I path (H1), the standardized coefficient was 0.28, with a t-value of 2.60 (p < 0.01). Hence, the stronger the attitudes, the stronger the behavioral intention to take a dog to be vaccinated against rabies. For the SN-I path (H2), the standardized coefficient was 0.22, with a t-value of 2.47 (p < 0.05). Accordingly, people who felt more social pressure and had higher subjective norms exhibited stronger intention to take their dogs to be vaccinated. For the PBC-I path (H3), the standardized coefficient was 0.43 with a t-value of 6.22 (p < 0.001). In other words, subjects with a higher sense of behavioral control had a higher intention to take their dogs to be vaccinated against rabies. Therefore, people who had a more positive attitude, stronger subjective norms, and more perceptive behavioral control would have stronger behavioral intention to take their dogs for vaccination against rabies. Additionally, three indices explained 69% of the variance on behavioral intention. Social norm positively affected attitude and attitude positively affected perceived behavioral control individually. In knowledge effect on attitude and perceived behavioral control, we also obtained evidence to support our hypotheses. For the OK-A path (H4), the standardized coefficient was 0.14 with a t-value of 3.11 (p < 0.05). In other words, the dog owners with higher objective knowledge had a more positive attitude toward taking their dogs to be vaccinated. For the OK-PBC path (H5), the standardized coefficient was 0.02 with a t-value of 0.50 (p > 0.05); for the SK-PBC path (H6), the standardized coefficient was 0.11 with a t-value of 2.29 (p < 0.05). In other words, people who have more subjective knowledge enhance their perceived behavioral control to perform rabies prevention. Therefore, for vaccinating a dog, objective knowledge enhanced an individual's attitude and subjective knowledge enhanced an individual's perceived behavioral control individually.",

However, many latent risks still surround this area, especially those coming from China. With the ECFA deal, more activities between Taiwan and China could lead to a higher chance of a rabies outbreak in Taiwan. Although the administration has tried to improve knowledge and instill positive attitudes, the vaccination rate in Taiwan is still between 30% and 40%, far below the 80% rate recommended by the WHO. Hence, it is necessary to better understand and predict owners' behavior about vaccinating their dogs.",

Through these results, we verified that TPB is a suitable structural model for the behavioral intention of vaccination against rabies and successfully extended TPB to explain the behavioral intention of dog owners. In addition, perceived behavioral control, not attitude, is the most obvious index for predicting the target behavioral intention. In other words, the results confirm our argument that attitude, although important, is not the best index for understanding dog owners' behavioral intention.

At the same time, people who had more subjective knowledge tended to have a better perceived behavioral control toward vaccination. In other words, subjective knowledge could change people's perceptions and considerations about preventing rabies and enhance their self-efficacy so that they feel they perform the behavior well.

First, we successfully extended TPB to explain behavioral intention not planned only concerning the individual. This study is the first one to use TPB as a conceptual framework for canine vaccination against rabies. Previous authors successfully applied TPB in studies regarding the intention of people to obtain vaccinations for themselves. This study proves that TPB provides adaptability, in that people decide to perform some behavior for their dogs. Besides, for the KAP model, we also found the evidence to support it can describe the behavior against rabies. However, we found other important factors should be considered at the same time. Therefore, we should extend the KAP model to the Knowledge, Intention, Practices (KIP) model and take care, at least, of perceived behavioral control, attitude, and subjective norms.",

Their control was a primary determinant of their behaviors [55, 56] . In other word, for the TPB model, we also found evidence to support the argument of Ajzen. Furthermore, for the KAP model, we thought when the owners of dogs, or other animals, try to bring them to be vaccinated against diseases, the perceived behavioral control of owners should be more important than the attitude of them.",

We added the concept of subjective knowledge in our model and found the SK-PBC-BI path should be the most effective method for raising the vaccination rate against rabies. In other words, SK-PBC-BI-Practices path would be better than the traditional KAP model. Self-efficacy plays the key factor in such preventive behavior. People with greater self-efficacy feel more subjective knowledge and perceived behavioral control, and then they perform better.",

To influence perceived behavioral control, the government should provide manageable conditions and a comfortable situation, for instance, a vaccination subsidy, a more convenient location for vaccination, and so on. Moreover, social norms and attitude should also be addressed. Owners who consider vaccination necessary within a social atmosphere and believe that vaccination against rabies is beneficial will have stronger intentions toward this behavior.
