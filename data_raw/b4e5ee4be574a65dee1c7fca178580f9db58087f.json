In particular for mesial temporal lobe epilepsy, the presence of a latency period between the first manifestation of seizures to chronic epilepsy provides the opportunity for therapeutic interventions at the molecular biology level. Using global expression profiling techniques, approximately 2000 genes have been published demonstrating differential expression in mesial temporal epilepsy. The majority of these changes, however, are specific to laboratory or experimental conditions with only 53 genes demonstrating changes in more than two publications. To this end, we review the current status of gene expression profiling in epileptogenesis and suggest standard guidelines to be followed for greater accuracy and reproducibility of results.",

DNA microarray and serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) were introduced allowing comparisons of global gene expression utilizing differing conditions in laboratory experimentation. This has allowed the relatively new field of comparative genomics to flourish (43, 54) . With respect to the brain, patterns of gene expression have been reported as early as 1999 with comparative libraries generated between malignant glioma tissue and normal brain for SAGE, and between sleep-wake cycles for microarray (40, 55) . From this point there has been an explosion of genomic information with steadily increasing reports generated during development and aging (38, 94, 106) , malignant brain processes (37, 101) , neurodegenerative disorders (41, 58) , behavioral (12, 45) and anatomical studies (18) . Studies into epileptogenesis have also expanded since the first global gene expression studies into epilepsy in 2001 (29, 42) . For this reason we will review the published papers and discuss the usefulness of global transcriptome analyses with regards to epileptogenesis.",

It includes seizures occurring in the absence of a recognized cause as well as events occurring in patients with antecedent stable (non-progressing) central nervous system insults (unprovoked seizures), but excludes seizures occurring in a close temporal relationship with an acute systemic, toxic or metabolic insult, which is expected to be the underlying cause (provoked seizures) (28) .",

            "text": "Within the broad classification of epilepsy, mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) is the most common location-related epilepsy. This may be lesional or non-lesional, with the great majority of non-lesional MTLE being associated pathologically with hippocampal sclerosis (HS). There remains much debate in the neurological world regarding HS as a cause or consequence of seizures. Pathological evidence has shown the presence of HS in brains of dementia patients without clinical epilepsy (19, 104) . In addition, MTLE patients with dual pathology may have HS that is: (i) a non-specific result of the primary epileptogenic lesion and not in itself epileptogenic; (ii) secondary to the primary epileptogenic lesions but also epileptogenic; or (iii) a primary HS that coexists with another epileptogenic lesions (109) . Proponents of the initiating hit theory of epilepsy argue that the progressive nature of MTLE demonstrates HS as a consequence of the seizure process. Typically a variable latent period between the initial precipitating incident and habitual unprovoked seizures is present, followed by a silent period between the first habitual unprovoked seizure and the onset of intractability. This strongly suggests that the pathology is progressive (5) . Worsening HS creates a cycle whereby increased seizure severity and frequency lead to further neuropathological changes and hence worsening clinical seizures. Several theories for the cause of HS have been proposed, with the most commonly quoted being febrile convulsions. Other theories include vascular injuries and developmental abnormalities. It is this process of progression to seizures of worsening severity with increasing frequency that is termed epileptogenesis (Figure 1 ).",

It is a pathological diagnosis although advances in neuroimaging through magnetic resonance imaging had allowed the use of radiology as a supporting or diagnostic tool. The pathological diagnosis consists of atrophy of the hippocampal formation with loss of neurones and reactive gliosis in CA1, CA4 and the dentate gyrus. In CA4, there is a loss of polymorphic neurons and pyramidal neurons. CA3 shows some neuronal loss, but CA1 always shows significant neuronal loss that may be very severe. There is a variable degree of gliosis seen in these subregions and occasional vessel sclerosis has been described. Loss of granule cells in the dentate gyrus is variable, as is gliosis. Granule cell distribution is often disrupted and various patterns including dual lamination or dispersion are described. Sprouting of the mossy fiber system in the dentate gyrus is apparent with Timm's stain with many believing that this sprouting leads to aberrant reinnervation resulting in the hyperirritable lesion that constitutes the epileptogenic hippocampus. Within all these changes, CA2 is relatively spared (68) (Figure 2 ). Treatment of non-lesional MTLE continues to be a challenge for the epileptologist. Monodrug therapy is initially implemented however this may progress quickly to multidrug therapy because of continued poor seizure control. Targeted surgical excision of the epileptogenic zone in carefully selected medically refractory patients has been shown to improve outcome with 44% to 72% of patients remaining seizure free compared with 4.3% to 12% of patients on further trials of anti-epileptic medications (6, 108, 111) . Despite these figures, there remains a large proportion of epileptic patients who continue to suffer unpredictable recurrent seizures. Understanding the molecular biological changes underlying the process of epileptogenesis is crucial to the development of newer, more effective treatment regimes.",

Several possible key pitfalls have been identified in the SAGE technique. A high amount of starting mRNA is required that is often prohibitive and not feasible, especially in difficult to obtain human specimens or complex experimental procedures. In addition, the cost of SAGE is high and may preclude repeat experimentation to verify collected data. Although SAGE studies the entire genome, the use of a four-base pair anchoring enzyme relies on the fact that the majority of mRNA sequences contain an anchoring site on average every 256 base pair stretch (4 4 = 256). The reality is a small proportion of mRNA will not include this anchoring site, leading to a loss of some small fraction of mRNA from the analysis that is extremely difficult to quantify. Clearly the use of a 10-base pair sequence to map gene assignment may cause issues in terms of specificity and sensitivity. It is not uncommon for multiple genes to share the same tag or for a single gene to be mapped by multiple tags.",

These arrays are then assayed for changes in gene expression following experimental treatment or in different disease states.

There are several types of microarray technologies currently in use with studies using oligonucleotide microarray technology, the most common for high-throughput quantitative studies of RNA expression (47) . In this instance, RNA extracted from the material of interest is reverse transcribed to complementary DNA and incubated with a mixture of fluorescently labeled markers at set conditions on a microarray chip containing a predetermined set of genes. Quantification is then performed by computerized measurements of fluorescent intensities. Microarray is a relatively simple procedure to perform and is becoming a standard technology for research laboratories worldwide. They allow testing of thousands of genes simultaneously with quantification of differential expressions at a reasonable cost when compared with SAGE. However, microarray technology relies on prior knowledge of the genes to be identified with the possibility of selection bias during creation of the cDNA array. As a result, novel genes are not able to be identified. Second, the amount of starting material required was also prohibitively high in the initial stages. This has largely been addressed with a two-stage hybridization process or global RNA amplification prior to running the array (73, 100) .",

In cases with conflicting values (ie, one MPSS run claiming a value and the other claiming zero), the trends obtained by ignoring the zero measurements within runs of the same sample, are shown statistically to be closer to the ideal unbiased comparisons between two samples.

This was more often than not accompanied by behavioral seizures including status and subsequent spontaneous seizures, and is also described as the \"status epilepticus models.\" Other methods include the electrical kindling models first described by Goddard et al in 1967, whereby repeated stimulation of selected regions of the mesial temporal lobe structures result in behavioral seizures and the classical neuropathological changes seen in the human MTLE. The electrical kindling models also demonstrate seizures with progressive increase in frequency and severity following prolonged stimulation. A chronic increase in seizure susceptibility is seen; however, in contrast to the status epilepticus models, spontaneous seizures are unusual and not expected.",

This model demonstrates the classical progression of human temporal lobe epilepsy with an initial convulsive event leading to seizures and status epilepticus before a latency period of varying length and appearance spontaneous seizures following this. Advocates of this model point to the presence of a latency period as the period of opportunity, whereby interruption of the epileptogenic process during this time may bring about a stop in the progression of spontaneous seizures. The difficulty lies in measuring the duration of each animal's individual latency period and hence the optimal time point for intervention and study. The duration of latency is known to be related to the convulsant dose with higher doses yielding shorter onset latencies (39) . Current figures suggest a mean onset latency of around 40 days; however, shorter periods have been described (32) . As such, estimates of latency periods used in research studies vary from 8 to 50 days.",

Interictal spike frequency was noted to drop during the latent phase and increase again during the chronic stage in concert with the development of behavioral seizures, neuronal loss and mossy fiber sprouting. (69) Status epilepticus models also demonstrate a varying clinical response of the animal subjects to differing doses of convulsive agents. A high mortality rate is not unexpected and severe neuronal loss is often encountered histologically. Initial seizures are unpredictable in their duration and severity and may be difficult to control. Acute antiseizure medications such as benzodiazepines are often needed to bring about a cessation of the status epilepticus state. It is clear, however, that the onset of spontaneous seizures is directly related to the duration of the status epilepticus state and at least 30 minutes duration of initial status epilepticus is required for manifesting an epileptogenic process (53) .",

In addition to this electrical progression, a behavioral progression of seizure activity occurred commencing with focal seizure activity typically manifested as initial facial clonus contralateral to the side of stimulation after a short delay. Progression through a stepwise series of more overt and eventually generalized seizures follows. This behavioral progression has been assigned a grading system, from grade 1 to 5 by Racine (81) in his study of amygdala kindling in rats.

Stimulation paradigms are also spaced over minutes to days and may take months to reach the fully kindled state. The ideal animal model for human temporal lobe epilepsy would consist of similar pathology, a latent period after the initial insult appropriate for the species, a state of chronic hyperexcitability and the emergence of spontaneous seizures after a latent period (107) . The absence of a true latent period in electrical kindling is in opposition to this. Latency is seen from the first kindling stimulation to the eventual appearance of seizures; however, additional insults in the form of further electrical stimuli are being provided leading up to and merging with the evoked seizures. Electrical kindling also does not produce spontaneous seizures, unless prolonged kindling is performed. This is coined the \"over-kindling\" model (79) . In this model continued electrical stimulation is given beyond the standard stage-5 criterion of the fully kindled state. The number of additional stimulations is extremely variable with recent reports suggesting at least an additional 90 to 100 kindled seizures required in rats for recurrent spontaneous seizures to occur (71, 87) .",

What is clear, however, is the similarities in histological changes seen in these conditions with marked neuronal loss, fibrillary gliosis with vacuolation and enlarged reactive astrocytes variously reported following severe hypoglycemia and ischemia, with or without associated status epilepticus (1, 13, 51, 52) .",

            "text": "Lukasiuk et al have recently presented in abstract form and in a review article, an extension to their previous analysis of gene expression during epileptogenesis. Identification of highly represented functional classification as well as individual genes that appeared across data sets was performed with cell death and survival, neuronal plasticity and immune response as the most prominent. Seventy individual genes were identified to be consistently regulated across at least three studies using specific time-point analyses (64, 65) . Our data indicates only 22 genes consistently regulated across at least three studies. This difference is explained by the inclusion of animal models of traumatic head injuries in the analysis by Lukasiuk et al that we did not include. The justification for their inclusion is the initial hit theory whereby an early insult, be it ischemic, traumatic or infective, sets into motion a series of molecular changes that lead into the latency period before chronic epilepsy. However, recent figures suggest only 2% to 5% of traumatic brain injury cases will develop epilepsy (75) . Second, posttraumatic seizures are more commonly a result of cerebral contusions leading to scarring and altered neuronal circuitry rather than the classical MTLE syndrome. Filtering out the head injury papers from Lukasiuk et al's study leaves only four consistently regulated genes, three of which are included in our list of regulated genes (Gadd45a, Ctsd, Ctss, Zfp36). The last gene, zinc finger protein 36 (zfp36) is only reported differentially expressed in different arms of the same study by Becker et al and was excluded from our analysis. The complexity of neuronal structure and organization within the mesial temporal lobe regions may contribute to this issue. In particular, the anatomical subregions of the hippocampus demonstrate both histological and functional differences in their composition and response to certain conditions. Whereas CA1 and CA3 are considered integral to the transmission of input signals, CA2 is considered a transitional zone with no clear function and the dentate gyrus is considered the main input pathway into the hippocampus, receiving afferents itself from the entorhinal cortex via the perforant pathway (31) . Increasing interest in gene expression profiling between hippocampal subfields has suggested a molecular basis underlying the previously defined anatomic subregions of the hippocampus (112) . This may further improve understanding of the differing histopathological responses described earlier.",

Indeed, of the reviewed articles, only three reported comparisons between subregions of the brain. Reasons for this may include the large amounts of starting mRNA needed for global gene expression platforms in general, or the difficulty in isolating individual subfields. The use of stereo dissection or laser microdissection to accurately isolate different hippocampal subregions as performed by Becker et al, Datson et al and Torres-Munoz et al have challenged these notions. This technique has been described to allow direct microscopic identification of specific cell types without appreciable loss of their DNA or RNA. Furthermore microarray analysis was able to be performed on the limited amount of mRNA extracted using double round amplification to provide sufficient material (4, 17, 99) . Marked differences (>700 genes) were found in the hippocampal response to chronic glucocorticoid exposure between CA3 and the dentate gyrus; however, 79 genes reliably identified in individual subfields were virtually undetectable when looking at whole hippocampal specimens. The practice of analyzing gross or pooled hippocampal specimens fails to take into account these obvious differences and may skew ensuing results.",

            "text": "Although global expression profiling has the advantages of being time efficient in analyzing large portions of the transcriptome, there are limitations to the sensitivity and accuracy. It is well documented that SAGE may inconsistently detect low abundance transcripts leaving small genomic expression changes induced by the experimental model or disease undetected. This is evident in examining the epilepsy studies discussed above with each generated database containing 5000 to 14 000 unique tags only, a significant decrease from the estimated size of the entire hippocampal transcriptome being over 30 000 (16, 26) . Furthermore, the sequencing error of SAGE is estimated at an average of 1% per base because of the fact they utilize a single-pass sequence in data processing. This accumulates to roughly 10% per 100 base pairs, leading to lower correct tags counts and artificially inflate the tag counts of already established tags or establish a count of a tag that does not exist. Microarray studies have also been shown to demonstrate significant variations even under the same experimental conditions. As such, validation of global expression profiling results by independent methods, such as real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), Northern/Western blotting and immunohistochemical methods, is crucial. In our experience, a significant decrease in the number of differentially expressed genes is demonstrated when validating SAGE results using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) with a custom-made, low-density array chip of 94 significant genes as indicated by SAGE (82). Following the changes into the proteomic stage will further validate results of global expression profiling. Translation into functional proteins represents the final pathway of genomic regulation. Quantifying the proteomic changes specimens through immunoperoxidase stainings and in situ hybridizations will not only complete the interrogation process, but also give insights into region-specific changes that may have been missed in interrogation of gross hippocampal, possibly negating the requirement for microdissection of hippocampal subregions (Figure 3) .",

It is the opinion of our laboratory that the entire process of molecular transcription and translation be interrogated with validation of global expression profiling results utilizing qRT-PCR followed by proteomic profiling using any combination of Western blotting, immunoperoxidase staining and in situ hybridization. Focusing genomic profiles into specific anatomical regions may enable causative molecular pathways to be identified and allow greater understanding of the histological changes, particular in the situation of HS associated MTLE whereby disagreement remains over the cause or effect of the pathological changes.",
