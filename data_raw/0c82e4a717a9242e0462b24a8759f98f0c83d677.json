We extracted total RNA from different mosquito species from South China.

Bioinformatic analyses to identify putative viral agents were conducted and the results confirmed by PCR. We identified a non-enveloped single-stranded DNA densovirus in the wild-caught Culex pipiens molestus mosquitoes. The majority of the viral transcripts (..80% of the region) were covered by the small viral RNAs, with a few peaks of very high coverage obtained. The +/2 strand sequence ratio of the small RNAs was approximately 7:1, indicating that the molecules were mainly derived from the viral RNA transcripts. The small viral RNAs overlapped, enabling contig assembly of the viral genome sequence. We identified some small RNAs in the reverse repeat regions of the viral 59-and 39 -untranslated regions where no transcripts were expected.",

During the past decade, novel viruses, particularly those causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and avian influenza A H5N1, have attracted international concern. These diseases represent only part of a rich tapestry of pathogens that have emerged to pose public health threats in recent years. Clearly, there is a pressing need for rapid and accurate identification of viral etiological agents. The development of Next Generation Sequencing (high throughput sequencing) technology provides a possible solution to this problem; indeed several recent studies have used these techniques to identify novel viral agents [3, 4, 5, 6, 7] . Palacios et al. identified a novel and deadly arenavirus by employing 454-pyrosequencing technology, the results of which were later confirmed by PCR [4] . Recent studies, have identified a novel strain of Ebola virus which caused a hemorrhagic fever epidemic in Uganda [6] , and dengue virus type 1 (DENV-1) sequences in laboratory reared mosquitoes experimentally infected with DENV-1 [7] . Using de novo next generation sequencing, Makoto Kuroda et al. showed that the etiologic agent identified in a deceased pneumonia patient was, in fact, the pandemic influenza A H1N1 virus, rather than that originally assumed to be pneumococcus [8] .",

The sequencing technologies offer distinct advantages over traditional viral detection and surveillance methods that generally require prior knowledge of the etiologic agents, as well as depending on virus-specific primers, probes or antibodies. These traditional techniques are, therefore, unsuitable in situations where the causative agent of an outbreak is entirely novel, or is a pathogen variant with several mutations to key priming regions. Hence, high throughput sequencing techniques provide a powerful new opportunity for surveillance and discovery of novel pathogens. The techniques provide a cost-effective mechanism for massive parallel sequencing generating extreme sequencing depth, whilst providing multiplex analyses for etiologic agent identification.",

Surveillance of infectious agents carried by mosquitoes is important for predicting the risk of vectorborne infectious disease outbreaks. Recently, a new strategy based on small interfering RNA (siRNA) immunity to virus infection was proposed for detecting novel RNA viruses in laboratory reared drosophilae and mosquitoes, as well as RNA/DNA viruses in plants using high throughput sequencing techniques [9, 10] . Prompted by these results (in laboratory reared insects and plants by deep sequencing and assembly of small RNAs isolated from the host organisms), we explored the feasibility of using this approach to identify viruses from wild-caught mosquitoes. Our findings show for the first time that high throughput sequencing of small RNAs can detect both RNA-and DNA viruses in wild-caught insects, thus supporting the feasibility of employing this approach for surveillance purposes.",

Further analysis demonstrated that the matched A. albopictus Parvovirus sequences were also present in the A. gambiae densonucleosis virus genome and the A. aegypti densovirus strain 0814616 genome. The A. gambiae densonucleosis virus and A. aegypti densovirus strain 0814616 shared most of their matched sequences. Sequence alignment showed that these three viruses exhibited more than 80 percent sequence identity, indicating that a virus with homologous sequences to these three viruses was present within the C. pipiens molestus sample. For the other two samples (C. tritaeniorhynchus and A. sinensis), no significant amount of sequence was found that corresponded to any specific virus. To discover potential novel viruses which may be remotely related to known viruses, a BLAST strategy proposed in the literature [9] was adopted. This strategy employs the tblastx search to ensure identification of viruses based on amino acid sequences. However, this analysis did not reveal any additional viral sequences in any of the three mosquito samples tested.",

The results showed that the small RNA reads overlapped which allowed contig assembly. Of the three viruses, A. gambiae densonucleosis had the most mapped reads (4481) and the longest assembled consensus sequence (3248 bp) which covered 78.5% of the whole genome (4139 bp) ( Figure 1 and file S1). The overall similarity between the newly identified virus and the A. gambiae densonucleosis virus was about 98% (3182/3248). The distribution of the lengths of the matched small viral RNAs showed that the majority (.60%) of them were 20-24 nt in length, with a peak distribution of 21 nt, while the total library small RNA (majority of them were endogenous siRNA) displayed a peak distribution of 22 nt ( Figure 2 ). This is consistent with the discovery in sindbis infected mosquitoes [11] and virus infected Drosophila OSS cells [9] , where the matched viral siRNAs had a peak distribution at 21 nt, while the endogenous siRNA in Drosophila [12, 13] and the total library small RNA in mosquitoes [11] had a peak length of 21,22 nt. Most of the small RNAs distributed along three viral transcripts (e.g. NS1, NS2 and Capsid), with more than 80% of the transcript length covered. The viral small RNA +/2 strand ratio approximated 7:1 (3933/548), indicating that these molecules were largely derived from the viral RNA transcripts. The mechanism for biogenesis of the -strand small RNAs in mosquitoes is currently unknown.",

It also contains two pairs of direct repeats in close proximity to those inverted repeats. All of these repeats are located in the untranscribed regions at the genome termini. It is interesting to note that no small RNAs were mapped to the untranscribed regions, although large numbers of reads mapped to the four inverted sequences (with a coverage greater than 506), but not the direct repeats ( Figure 1 , Table 3 ). Sequencing was performed on small RNA fragments, therefore, the fact that no reads mapped to the untranscribed region was not unexpected. The fact that reads mapped to the untranscribed 59 and 39 inverted repeat regions indicates that those inverted repeat regions may be transcribed by an unknown mechanism. Since the terminal stem-loop structures are usually involved in viral genome replication, it is possible that transcripts from the stem-loop regions are involved in virus replication (e.g. as primers for genomic DNA synthesis).",

            "text": "High throughput sequencing as a next generation sequencing technology has been developing rapidly during the last few years and has found various applications in different biological and medical research fields. Recent advances in this technology have made its application easier, cheaper, more convenient and more efficient allowing it to evolve into a powerful tool for identification of novel human pathogens [3, 4, 5, 6, 7] . High throughput sequencing of small RNA's (esp. miRNA) has become routine practice, with reliable protocols and readily available reagents. Due to the short length of the small RNA molecules, sequencing is even faster and cheaper than standard high throughput sequencing using longer DNA or RNA fragments. This makes high throughput sequencing of small RNA an attractive method for pathogen detection in plants and insects based on siRNA, an innate defense mechanism of plants and insects [9, 10] . Detection of viruses in laboratory reared insects [9] or experimentally infected mosquitoes have been reported [7] . Our work shows that high throughput sequencing is suitable for detecting viral agents in wild-caught insects. Since siRNA defense mechanisms are triggered by the doublestranded RNA (dsRNA) sequence (and the siRNA mature forms generated from dsRNA), it is reasonable to expect that only RNA viruses which contain dsRNA as genomic RNA or replicate via a dsRNA intermediate can be identified using this strategy. This perception is consistent with previous reports where only RNA viruses were identified using small RNA sequencing techniques [7, 9] . However, our work clearly demonstrates that small RNA sequencing can also detect DNA viruses in insects, although the underlying mechanism of the biogenesis of these small RNAs is unclear. Similar findings have been reported in plants [10] , but again the mechanism has not been defined. It is possible that plants and insects generate small RNAs from infected DNA viruses differently. Possible mechanisms for small RNA biogenesis from DNA viruses include, for example, the local dsRNA formed in the stem-loop structure of the viral transcripts or overlapping convergent viral transcripts [23, 24] . In the case of densoviruses, there seem to be no overlapping convergent transcripts [25, 26] and no obvious stem-loop structure has been identified in densovirus transcripts.",

However, this hypothesis cannot explain at least two things: one is the very high incidence of some small RNAs that have 3-4 adenines at the 59 terminus, the other is the biogenesis of the small RNAs that map to the inverted regions of the genomic termini. These are predicted to form a T-or Y-shaped structure that may participate in genome packaging signaling or replication initiation [26] . It is interesting to note that a longer length direct repeat was located very close to each inverted repeat (Figure 1 ), but no small RNA mapped onto the direct repeats themselves. The function of the inverted and direct repeats, and how the small RNAs are generated from the inverted repeats but not from the direct repeats, remain interesting questions to be answered. To this end, we provide all the original data containing the read sequences of the virus small RNAs as a supplementary file to this paper (file S1).",

Field trials using a densovirus that infects A. aegypti mosquitoes showed that the virus had significant efficiency, although most densoviruses take 2-20 days to kill their insect hosts [29] , making this agent unsuitable for commercial use.

With the advent of next generation high throughput parallel sequencing platforms, the possibility of random metagenomic sequencing of diseased samples with the object of identifying new putative pathogens has emerged [6, 31] . However, elimination of host nucleic acid is critical to boost any pathogen signal toward the detection threshold. In addition, the danger of missing extremely low titer viruses is still a possibility with these systems. By comparison, small RNA sequencing requires neither viral particle purification nor viral nucleic acid sequence amplification. With the advantages of high throughput, high speed, low cost and greatly simplified methodologies, small RNA sequencing can now be used more widely to identify known viruses as well for novel virus discovery.",

The quality of total RNA was analyzed on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer system and by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A small RNA library was generated according to the Illumina sample preparation instructions [33] . Briefly, total RNA samples were sizefractionated on a 15% tris-borate-EDTA-urea polyacrylamide gel. RNA fragments 15-50 nt long were isolated, quantified, and ethanol precipitated. The SRA 59 adapter (Illumina) was ligated to the RNA fragments with T4 RNA ligase (Promega).

Next the SRA 39 adapter (Illumina) ligation was performed, followed by a second size-fractionation using the same gel conditions as described above. The 64-99 nt long RNA fragments were isolated by gel elution and ethanol precipitation. The ligated RNA fragments were reverse transcribed to singlestranded cDNAs using M-MuLV (Invitrogen) with RT-primers (as recommended by Illumina). The cDNAs were amplified with pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) using 20 PCR cycles and the Illumina small RNA primer set. PCR products were purified on a 12% tris-borate-EDTA polyacrylamide gel and a slice of gel containing cDNAs of 80-115 bp was excised. This fraction was eluted and the recovered cDNAs were precipitated and quantified on the Nanodrop (Thermo Scientific) and on the TBS-380 minifluorometer (Turner Biosystems) using PicoGreenH dsDNA quantization reagent (Invitrogen). The concentration of the sample was adjusted to 10 nM and 10 mL used for the sequencing reaction. The purified cDNA library was used for cluster generation (on the Illumina Cluster Station), and then sequenced on the Illumina GAIIx machine, following the manufacturer's instructions.
