Mathematical modelling on infectious diseases helps to study the transmission dynamics of the pathogens. Theoretically, the diseases can be controlled and eventually eradicated by maintaining the effective reproduction number, (R eff ), strictly less than 1. We established a vector-host compartmental model, and derived (R eff ) for vector-borne diseases. The analytic form of the (R eff ) was found to be the product of the basic reproduction number and the geometric average of the susceptibilities of the host and vector populations. The (R eff ) formula was demonstrated to be consistent with the estimates of the 2015-2016 yellow fever outbreak in Luanda, and distinguished the second minor epidemic wave. For those using the compartmental model to study the vector-borne infectious disease epidemics, we further remark that it is important to be aware of whether one or two generations is considered for the transition ''from host to vector to host'' in reproduction number calculation.",

Especially in tropical and sub-tropical regions, most vector-borne diseases are treated as a part of neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) (Fenwick, 2012) , present endemic features, and are persistent in the interface of host and vector communities. During 2014, the historical large-scale dengue fever caused an extensive international epidemic in southern China as well as other regions in Southeastern Asia (Sang et al., 2015; Stanaway et al., 2016) . The Zika virus (ZIKV) emerged in the Pacific area in 2008 (Duffy et al., 2009 Besnard et al., 2014; Cauchemez et al., 2016) , then in South America since 2015, and caused more than 500,000 (confirmed or probable) cases, while the true number of cases remains unclear (He et al., 2017; Gao et al., 2016; Johansson et al., 2016; Ferguson et al., 2016; He et al., 2019) . The West Nile virus (WNV) was widespread across tropical parts globally, and was introduced into North America in 1999, which lead to an approximated 1.8 million infections from 1999 to 2010 (Kilpatrick, 2011) . The chikungunya virus (CHIKV) hit the Americas and beyond, where tens of millions of previously unexposed persons would be at risk (Fischer & Staples, 2014; Weaver & Lecuit, 2015) . In 2015-2016, the largest yellow fever (YF) outbreak (since the 1980s) occurred in Angola and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) (Zhao et al., 2018b; Kraemer et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2016; Shearer et al., 2017) . After Africa, the YF continuously posed a serious threat to the unprotected population of southern Brazil, which was believed to have eradicated YF after the middle of the last century (Barrett, 2018) . Malaria epidemics occur from time to time in many under-developed places in the tropical and sub-tropical regions (Caminade et al., 2014; Murray et al., 2012) . The increasing frequency of such outbreaks over the past decades urges disease control and prevention studies (Johansson et al., 2012; Kraemer et al., 2019) .",

Theoretically, the infectious diseases can be controlled and finally eradicated by maintaining the effective reproduction number, R eff , strictly less than 1, i.e., R eff < 1. The R eff is the expected number of secondary cases produced by one typical infection joining in a population during its infectious period (Van den Driessche & Watmough, 2002) . This theoretical criterion is widely adopted as a threshold to characterise the transmission dynamics and measure the disease control effectiveness (Earn et al., 2008; Keeling & Rohani, 2011) . For airborne communicable diseases, e.g., respiratory diseases and most childhood infections, that transmit in the vector-free context, R eff is given as in Eq. (1).",

The local authority had conducted large-scale mass vaccination campaign since February 2016, and the vaccine program immunised approximated 55% of the local population within 6 months since started (Zhao et al., 2018b; WHO, 2017) . Owing to the timely and large-scale mass vaccination campaign, it was estimated that over 5-fold of both cases and deaths were saved.

We use S h ,I h ,R h to denote the numbers of susceptible, infected and removed host population respectively. The S v ,I v ,R v denote the numbers of susceptible, infected and removed vector population respectively. The susceptible host becomes infected by the ''contact'' with infectious vectors, eventually recovers, i.e., move to the recovered class, and remains protected from secondary infection. A similar path is also modelled in the vectors' population. For simplicity, we ignored the incubation period, commonly denoted by E, of the infection in the epidemic model. Based on the above descriptions, the compartmental model is formulated in Eqs. (2). Figure 1 shows the schematic diagram of model (2).",

According to Van den Driessche & Watmough (2002) , Diekmann, Heesterbeek & Roberts (2009) and Diekmann, Heesterbeek & Metz (1990) , a systematic procedure to calculate the R 0 by solving the dominant eigenvalue, i.e., the eigenvalue with the largest real part, of the next generation matrix, G, at the disease-free equilibrium (DFE). Mathematically, it can be shown easily that the DFE exists and is stable for our epidemic model (2). For the next generation matrix G = FV \u22121 , the F is the new infection (or transmission) matrix and V is the infection transfer (or transition) matrix. The entry of ith row and jth column of matrix F is denoted by F i,j , and F i,j = \u2202F i \u2202x j where F i is the ith equation of F and x j is the jth variable of the vector of infected classes. For instance, in Eqs. (2), the I h and I v are the infected classes. Similarly, the entry of ith row and jth column of matrix V is denoted by V i,j , and V i,j = \u2202V i \u2202x j where V i is the ith equation of V and x j is the jth variable of the vector of infected classes. The vector F is the transmission rates' vector quantity, i.e., the changing rates from infected to non-infected classes, and vector V is the transition rates' vector quantity, i.e., the changing rates among infected classes. The F is the Jacobian matrix of F, and V is the Jacobian matrix of V.",

Note that the Z i s are from the underlying time-dependent version of model (2). By contrast, the number of observed YF cases time series, denoted by C i for the ith week, are regarded as random samples from a negative binomial (NB) process determined by the theoretical case numbers. We assume the observation noise follows an over-dispersed Poisson distribution (Bret\u00f3 et al., 2009) , and in particular, the C i s follow a Poisson process determined by Z i s. Furthermore, the rate of the Poisson process is considered to be a Gamma random variable, and thus, this leads to a NB process (Lin et al., 2018) . The probability framework is described in Eq. (6).",

Thus, the overall log-likelihood value can be calculated by summing up to all log-probabilities of all is during the entire YF epidemic period. Therefore, the reconstructed R 0 (t ) can be estimated by finding the number of nodes and values of nodes (of the cubic spline function) with the ''best fitting performance''. We evaluate the fitting performance of the reconstructed R 0 (t ) by measuring the trade-off between the goodness-of-fit (in term of the log-likelihood) and the complexity of the model structure (in term of the number of parameters to be estimated). As in Zhao et al. (2018b) , the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) is employed to evaluate the fitting performance. By using the likelihood profile approach (He, Ionides & King, 2009; He et al., 2017; Zhao et al., 2018a; Barndorff-Nielsen & Cox, 1994; Ionides, Bret\u00f3 & King, 2006) , in which the profile of maximum log likelihood was calculated as a function of the model parameter, we estimated the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the reconstructed R 0 (t ).

We estimated the R(t ) from the YF cases time series by using the serial interval (SI) approach proposed by Wallinga & Teunis (2004) . The SI, in the epidemiology of infectious diseases, is the period of time between successive cases in a chain of transmission (Porta, 2014; Fine, 2003) . If we know the distribution of the inter-arrival time of patients arrived at a clinic, we may simulate the sequence of patients arrivals. Similarly, if we know the distribution of SI, we may simulate the sequence of infections, adding that one primary infection could lead to a number of, which is determined by the reproduction number, secondary infections. Reversely, if we know the distribution of SI and the cases time series, we can reconstruct the reproductive number backwardly. This SI approach was extended by Forsberg White & Pagano (2008) , Katriel et al. (2011 ), Ali, Kadi & Ferguson (2013 ), Fraser (2007 , Cori et al. (2013) and Wallinga & Lipsitch (2006) , and also implemented to study several vector-borne diseases (Ferguson et al., 2016; Zhao et al., 2019a; Wu et al., 2016; Zhao et al., 2019b) .

            "text": "The analytic formula of R eff was given in Eq. (5). Since in many situations, the R 0 (t ) is time-varying, we defined the percentage reduction in R 0 as 1 minus the ratio of the reduced R 0 over its original highest value, usually the basic reproduction number during the initial outbreak. Similarly, the percentage reduction in S h can be defined as 1 minus the host susceptibility. We noted that both percentage reductions in S h and R 0 ranged from 0 to 1. The relationship of R eff against the percentage reductions in S h and R 0 was shown in Fig. 3. Figs. 3(A) -3(C) were the scenarios of the highest R 0 = 2, R 0 = 5, and R 0 = 10 respectively. The range of R 0 from 2 to 10 covers most of the vector-borne diseases' basic reproduction numbers during the initial outbreak. We used the 2015-2016 YF outbreak in Luanda to demonstrate the effective reproduction number formula in Eq. (5). The YF epidemic was shown in Fig. 2A . Subsequent to the (first) major epidemic wave that peaked in the February of 2016, we observed a second minor wave that followed the major wave, which peaked in May. We showed the reconstructed R 0 (t ) and approximated S h (t ) reproduced from Zhao et al. (2018b) in Fig. 2B . The local human susceptibility, S h (t ), was decreasing by the end of February and ended up less than 7% due to the timely mass vaccination campaign (Shearer et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2016; Zhao et al., 2018b; Kraemer et al., 2017) . We found two peaks in the reconstructed R 0 (t ), of which the highest value was found to be 7.1 during the first wave that peaked in January. The second peak of R 0 (t ) occurred in the April of 2016 with the local maximal value of 5.6. We matched the second peak in R 0 (t ), highlighted in purple, and the minor epidemic wave in the YF incidences, highlighted in grey, by one SI shift, i.e., 23 days averagely (Wu et al., 2016) . Figure 2C shows the effective reproduction number calculated or estimated by Eq. (1) or Eq. (5) or the renewable equation in Eq. (7). The (first) major transmission, i.e., R eff (t ), wave peaked in January of 2016 associated with the major epidemic wave that peaked in February ( Fig. 2A) . We found the R eff (t ) series based on R 0 (t ) and S h (t ) (in Fig. 2B were (almost) synchronised, i.e., in-phase, with the estimated R eff (t ) (or R(t )) series by the renewable equation. The highest R eff (t ) estimate by renewable equation was 5.5, and the same as the estimate by using Eq. (5) that was also 5.5, whereas the Eq. (1) version is 4.4. Similar to the trends of YF incidences and R 0 (t ), we also found a second minor wave in R eff (t ) around April, highlighted in purple. During this minor wave, the local maximal R eff (t ) estimate by renewable equation was 2.0 (95% CI [1.1-3.4]) that is larger than 1 significantly, the '' R 0 \u221a S h S v '' version was 2.3, and the '' R 0 S h '' version is 0.9 ( < 1). Figure 4 showed the trajectory of the R eff (t ) from Eq. (5) against the percentage reductions in S h and R 0 of the YF epidemic in Luanda. Consistent with the observations in Fig. 2C , we found both of the two transmission waves of YF R eff (t ) moved across the disease control threshold, i.e., R eff = 1. For the second transmission waves, marked in the purple rectangle, it ''broke'' the R eff = 1 boundary and thus associated with the second (minor) YF epidemic wave in May of 2016, highlighted in grey in Fig. 2A .",

We formulated the analytic form of the effective reproduction number, R eff , with respect to the basic reproduction number, R 0 , and the susceptibilities of the vector (S v ) and host (S h ) for vector-borne diseases in Eq. (5). The R eff from Eq. (5) were compared with the R eff of the classic airborne infectious disease in Eq. (1) as well as the estimation by the SI approach in Eq. (7). We re-visited the yellow fever (YF) outbreak in Luanda, and used this epidemic as an example to compare the R eff calculation and estimation. Although there existed differences in the three R eff series during the first transmission wave around January 2016 in Fig. 2 , the R eff values were roughly synchronised. However, for the second (minor) transmission wave around April 2016, the R eff s from Eq. (5) were consistent with the estimates from the renewable equation that were significantly larger than 1, the '' R 0 S h '' appeared inconsistent with the formers and lower than 1. According to theoretical epidemiology (Earn et al., 2008; Brauer & Castillo-Chavez, 2001; Keeling & Rohani, 2011; Grenfell, Dobson & Moffatt, 1995) , the condition that R eff < 1 guarantees the disease under control. The R 0 S h was calculated lower than 1 since the mid-February 2016, and this contradicted with the occurrence of the second YF epidemic wave in May. Therefore, the '' R 0 S h '' form of effective reproduction number was demonstrated unqualified for measuring the transmissibility of a vector-borne disease. On the other hand, our derived R eff = R 0 \u221a S h S v , Eq. (5), matched the two waves of both YF incidences time series and the R(t ) estimates by renewable equation well.",

Figure 3 shows that the reduction in S h is (relatively) less effective in reducing R eff during the initial stage, i.e., from 0% onwards, and becomes more effective when the cumulative reduction of S h grows. This finding suggests that directly reducing R 0 , via, e.g., vector elimination, avoiding exposure to vectors, improving treatment, etc., could be a more efficient option to control the vector-borne diseases, especially when the herd protection in the host population is difficult to build up.",

(1), (5) and (7). The maximum likelihood-based reconstruction method and the SI based estimation method are different in the calculation procedures and theoretical features. The maximum likelihood-based reconstruction relies on the mechanistic disease transmission model, e.g., model (2), and thus, it follows a biologically reasonable model structure. It is able to disentangle the changing dynamics of susceptibility, S h (t ), and the basic reproduction number, R 0 (t ), based the number of cases time series and other reasonable epidemiological settings. Hence, we adopted this approach to find both S h (t ) and R 0 (t ), and further calculate the R eff (t ) in two difference forms. The SI based (renewable equation based) estimation method is to calculate descriptive statistics by nature. By directly using the number of disease cases time series and the knowledge (distribution) of SI, the R(t ) can be estimated straightforwardly.",

As stated in the analysis parts, the relationship holds on the condition that the transmission paths remain from-hostto-vector and from-vector-to-host. Hence, when direct transmission occurs, e.g., sexual transmission between hosts in Zika virus (Gao et al., 2016) , the R eff = R 0 \u221a S h S v . However, since the sexual transmission merely contributes very minor infections, it can be ignored in scale, and thus R eff \u2248 R 0 \u221a S h S v . The numerical results and estimates in this work are calculated with S v = 1 fixed. This S v = 1 is based on two facts that the vector's lifespan is much shorter than host's lifespan; and the infected vectors do not recover (for most of the vector-borne diseases). These two facts will lead to an outcome in model (2) that class R v = 0 and class I v is remarkably small and almost zero. As the matter of fact, I v , i.e., the prevalence of disease in vectors, is likely to increase when the pathogen is extremely infectious and the vertical transmission accounts. Therefore, the surveillance on the disease prevalence in vectors would be helpful for calculating the R eff .",
