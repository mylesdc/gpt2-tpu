Although most are suspected to be of viral origin, a putative causative pathogen is not identified in over a quarter of these febrile episodes. Using a de novo assembly sequencing approach, we report the detection (15.4%) of dicistroviruses (DicV) RNA in sera collected from 692 febrile Tanzanian children. In contrast, DicV RNA was only detected in 1/77 (1.3%) plasma samples from febrile Tanzanian adults, suggesting that children could represent the primary susceptible population. Estimated viral load by specific quantitative real-time RT-PCR assay ranged from < 1.32E3 to 1.44E7 viral RNA copies/mL serum. Three DicV full-length genomes were obtained, and a phylogenetic analyse on the capsid region showed the presence of two clusters representing tentative novel genus. Although DicV-positive cases were detected throughout the year, a significantly higher positivity rate was observed during the rainy season.",

For a large proportion of these cases, the microbial aetiology remains unknown even after extensive diagnostic panels have been applied; thus, it is suspected that new or divergent viruses that are not detectable by standard targeted diagnostics assay may be involved. High-throughput sequencing (HTS) coupled with de novo assembly offers the possibility of recognizing viral RNA or DNA in an unbiased fashion. HTSbased screenings in both vertebrate and non-vertebrate biological specimens [1] [2] [3] have shown that the diversity of viruses circulating in the animal world is larger than anticipated (including potential human infections such as astroviruses, reoviruses, pseudorabies viruses, and bornaviruses [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] ), and that many viral families are shared by the two kingdoms, raising the possibility of yet to be discovered viral infections in humans [10] .",

In contrast to the HTS analysis results obtained with the paediatric cohort, the presence of DicV RNA was detected in only one of 77 (1.3%) plasma specimens from the adult cohort (2 reads, real-time RT-PCRs were performed but the results were not conclusive due to the presence of a very strong PCR inhibition) ( Figure 1 ).

Most DicV+ sera contained a large number of reads and a significant proportion of the DicV genomes was thus frequently obtained (Figure 2a) , including full-length genomes in 3 cases. These HTS-based findings were subsequently verified by two specific in-house real-time RT-PCR assays in the 38 samples which had sufficient leftover sera (Figure 1 ) and by conventional sequencing in 5 samples selected for their high viral load (100% nucleotide identity, data not shown). Positivity in 30 of 38 (79%) cases could be confirmed by real-time RT-PCR with a median of 5.7E3 viral RNA copies/ mL of sera and, in some cases, reached up to 1xE7 viral RNA copies/mL, supporting a significant viral load. In contrast to children, only one of 77 adults was found to be DicV-positive by HTS from a parallel cohort, suggesting that children could represent the predominant susceptible population. However, this latter observation should be interpreted with caution since a potential temporal bias cannot be ruled out (sampling times for the paediatric and adult cohorts are not overlapping). In order to expand our screening we tested by real-time RT-PCR 100 paired sera from adult and paediatric patients enrolled in a North-Eastern Tanzania cohort (Tanga region) between December 2017 and end of April 2018; we did not identify any DicV positive cases. However, not only a restricted number of adult (n = 60) and paediatric (n = 40) cases could be tested in this later cohort but also the paediatric populations studied in the Tanga and Dar es Salaam cohorts are different (e.g. age of enrolment) and limit our conclusions.",

Secondly, DicV positivity by HTS analysis was successfully cross-validated by separate extraction and real-time RT-PCR assays in 30/38 DicV+ patient sera with sufficient leftover volume, excluding the probability of spurious bioinformatics results and further eliminating contamination of HTS reagents (especially considering the absence of any common reagent between the HTS and real-time RT-PCR protocols).

The viral loads detected by realtime RT-PCR corresponded in most cases to the HTS read coverage and ranged from < 1.32E3 up to 1xE7 viral RNA copies/mL; this viral load heterogeneity speaks against a common and systematic source of contamination and would rather be compatible with the expected kinetics of an acute viral infection.",

Finally, when analysing publicly available sequence databases from a recent study that investigated the plasma virome of febrile adult Kenyans [22] , and thus has absolutely no link with our investigations, we identified 2'290 DicV reads covering 96.1% (5'350 nt) of ORF1 and 97.5% (2'525 nt) of ORF2 in one pool (SRR4255933). For ORF1, the covered sequence showed 95.4-96.4% nucleotide identity and 98.9-99.2% amino acid identity compared to the Tanzanian DicV sequences. ORF2 had similar results, with 91.5-97.5% nucleotide identity and 94.5-99.2% amino acid identities. The phylogenetic tree of the RdRp region shows that the Kenyan sequence clusters with the Tanzanian ones ( Figure  2b ), which represents an additional argument for the presence of this DicV novel genus in this geographic region.",

This latter result could be explained either by a higher sensitivity of the HTS in specific situations (particularly in relation to the additional freeze-thaw cycle for the real-time RT-PCR) and/or by the presence of primer-probe mismatches (this hypothesis could not be checked since only a very limited number of reads were obtained). The number of reads obtained through HTS provides a rough estimate of the viral load and depends on various factors, such as cellularity, the presence of other microorganisms and the efficiency of the library preparation [23] .",

Indeed, the seasonality clustering observed in this study, may suggest vector-borne transmission although others transmission routes cannot be ruled out. A zoonotic reservoir is also possible since DicVs have been detected in stools from various non-human primates (such as gorillas [24] ) as well as giant pandas [25] , and bats [26] , which also raises the possibility of a faecal-oral or sylvatic transmission cycle. Furthermore, the presence of DicV sequences were recently reported in the blood of a fruit bat captured in 2015 from the Republic of Congo [27] . In humans, unbiased sequencing analysis of stool samples collected from 35 South Asian children presenting with non-polio acute flaccid paralysis revealed the presence of DicV in 3 subjects coinfected with other viruses [28] . Another study reported DicV sequences in stool samples from Australian children with acute diarrhoea [29] . In both studies, whether the presence of DicV in these stools resulted from a viral replication in the human gastrointestinal tract or from environmental contamination was not determined. At the in vitro level, the cellular tropism of DicV has been investigated using the Taura syndrome virus (TSV): a DicV that infects shrimp. Exposing various primate cells to this virus revealed a range of susceptibilities, where RD, Hep-2C and BGM cells were considered vulnerable to infection [30] , while FRhK-4, MA-104 and BGMK remained non-permissive [31] . Both animal models as well as reverse genetics approaches will be needed to further investigate the tropism and likely replication sites of DicV in humans.",

The presence of DicV was not associated with any other co-infections (such as malaria, HIV or skin infections) nor was it linked to any other comorbidities. However, our cohort specifically enrolled patients at the outpatient level who presented unspecific febrile illnesses and thus covered a homogenous spectrum of clinical syndromes from which to draw conclusions.

Whether this finding reflects acquired protective immunity in adults, a more frequent transmission from the vector, a greater susceptibility in the paediatric population or as mentioned above a temporal bias needs to be evaluated. A recent study investigated the seroprevalence of antibodies against another DicV from another genus named Triatoma virus (TrV) [32] . TrV is known to infect the vector responsible for Chagas disease transmission. Their findings revealed a high prevalence of anti-TrV antibodies against the TrV structural proteins in human sera of subjects living in Argentina, Bolivia and Mexico and suggested a passive transmission of the virus (i.e. absence of viral replication in human hosts). To fully investigate the possible transmission of DicV, future serological investigations should be carried out on a more diverse collection of symptomatic and asymptomatic adult and paediatric cohorts from varied geographical regions inside. At this time, we may raise the hypothesis of a vector-borne transmission and that, among the potential vectors, triatomines should be considered.",

We lack an afebrile cohort to assess the association. Other than the small increase in the inflammatory marker, PCT, we could not identify any specific clinical features, diagnoses or co-morbidities associated to DicV infection despite the detailed clinical database gathered at the time of sample collection. Elevated PCT is commonly associated (although not strongly) with bacterial infections; it may be increased either directly by bacterial endotoxins and lipopolysaccharides or indirectly by inflammatory mediators (such as tumour necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6, interleukin-1). Mediators of viral infection (interferon-gamma) are thought to attenuate PCT levels. Thus, its increase in DicV+ patients could be an indication that DicV may have a pathological immunomodulatory effect on its human host or an as yet unidentified association to another bacterial infection. However, given the small size effect size, no clinically relevant conclusions could be drawn from this observation. Notably, the de novo analysis performed on all sera and plasma specimens (from the paediatric and adult cohorts respectively) revealed the presence RNA sequences from viruses known to infect humans (Supplementary Figure S1 ). Of the 103 paediatric patients who were DicV+ by HTS, only ten presented a co-detection with sequences from these known human RNA viruses (two human pegivirus-1, two enteroviruses, four rhinoviruses and two rotaviruses). Human pegivirus-1 sequences were also detected in the plasma of the unique DicV+ adult patient by HTS. Studies in larger and more clinically diverse patients (including asymptomatic subjects) are needed to clarify whether DicV is pathogenic or if it should rather be considered as a member of the commensal blood virome, similarly to torque tenovirus or human pegivirus. Screening other types of samples will also help to define the in vivo tropism of DicV.",
