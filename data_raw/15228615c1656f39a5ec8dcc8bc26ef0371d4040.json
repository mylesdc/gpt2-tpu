There are two pathways for viral infection to ''right next door'': one is the virus transmission through cell-cell fusion by forming syncytium without production of progeny virions, and the other is mediated by virions without virus diffusion, generally designated cell-to-cell transmission. Influenza viruses are believed to be transmitted as cell-free virus from infected cells to uninfected cells. Here, we demonstrated that influenza virus can utilize cell-to-cell transmission pathway through apical membranes, by handover of virions on the surface of an infected cell to adjacent host cells. Live cell imaging techniques showed that a recombinant influenza virus, in which the neuraminidase gene was replaced with the green fluorescence protein gene, spreads from an infected cell to adjacent cells forming infected cell clusters. This type of virus spreading requires HA activation by protease treatment. The cell-to-cell transmission was also blocked by amantadine, which inhibits the acidification of endosomes required for uncoating of influenza virus particles in endosomes, indicating that functional hemagglutinin and endosome acidification by M2 ion channel were essential for the cell-to-cell influenza virus transmission. Furthermore, in the cell-to-cell transmission of influenza virus, progeny virions could remain associated with the surface of infected cell even after budding, for the progeny virions to be passed on to adjacent uninfected cells. The evidence that cell-to-cell transmission occurs in influenza virus lead to the caution that local infection proceeds even when treated with neuraminidase inhibitors.",

For example in the case of measles virus belonging to Paramyxoviridae, infection is initiated by the interaction of the viral hemagglutinin glycoprotein with host cell surface receptors. The virus penetrates into the cell through membrane fusion mediated by the interaction of the fusion glycoprotein. In later stages of infection, newly synthesized glycoproteins accumulate at the cell membrane resulting in fusion of the infected cell with neighboring cells by producing syncytia.

Vaccinia virus particles bound on the filopodium of an infected cell are repelled toward neighboring uninfected cells by the formation of filopodia using actin filament [3] . The filopodia direct viruses to uninfected cells. Immunotropic viruses including retroviruses utilize an immunological synapse, designed as virological synapses for the cell-to-cell transmission [4] [5] [6] [7] . Claudin-1 and occludin, components of tight junction, are involved in hepatitis C virus (HCV) entry through the cell-to-cell transmission [8, 9] . The cell-to-cell transmission through tight junction is also observed in other viruses which infect epithelial layers [10, 11] . These retroviruses and HCV remain on the surface of an infected cell even after budding. The uninfected cells adjacent to these infected cells can accept or take over viruses from the infected cell. Thus, the cell-to-cell transmission can be categorized into two manners based on the state of infecting viruses, either cell-free or cell-associated virions.",

            "text": "Influenza virus, belonging to the family of Orthomyxoviridae, is one of the most serious zoonotic pathogens and causes seasonal epidemics or periodic pandemics among human beings around the world. The viral envelope consists of a lipid bilayer derived from cells that anchors three of viral transmembrane proteins, hemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA), and matrix protein 2 (M2). Influenza virus infection is initiated by the attachment of HA on virus particles to cell surface receptors containing sialic acids [12] . It has been known that the specific interaction between HA and sialic acid species is one of the determinants of the host range of influenza viruses [13] . Beside its role in the viral attachment, HA is also involved in intracellular fusion between viral envelope and host cell endosome membrane in the endocytotic pathway, by which the virus content is released inside the host cell [14] . The functional maturation of HA is mediated by the cleavage of HA into two disulfide-linked glycopolypeptides, HA1 and HA2 [15] , accomplished by trypsin or trypsin-like proteases derived from host cells [16] [17] [18] [19] . The membrane fusion is induced by a conformational change in the mature HA, which is triggered at low pH in the endosome, allowing viral ribonucleoprotein complexes to release into the cytoplasm [20, 21] . Thus, HA plays a critical role in initiation and progression of influenza virus infection. Influenza virus NA possesses the enzymatic activity that cleaves a-ketosidic linkages between terminal sialic acids and adjacent sugar residues of cellular glycoconjugates [22] . The sialidase activity of NA removes terminal sialic acid residues from HA and NA proteins as well as host cell surface glycoproteins. Since the terminal sialic acid of sialyloligosaccharides is critical for HA binding, the receptordestroying activity of NA serves to counter the receptor-binding activity of HA. It is quite likely that this activity contributes to prevention of successive superinfection of an infected cell [23] . In the absence of the functional sialidase activity, progeny virions aggregate on the cell surface due to the HA receptor-binding activity and can not be released [24, 25] . Thus, NA cleaves sialic acids from the cell surface and facilitates virus release from infected cells. However, it is not clear whether every progeny virion is released as cell-free virion to infect the uninfected cells after diffusion into the extracellular environment. Influenza viruses are generally transmitted as cell-free viruses from infected to uninfected cell but they may also infect through the cell-to-cell transmission, in particular during local lesion formation.",

Influenza virus can form an infection center even in the presence of oseltamivir, a potent NA inhibitor (commercially known as Tamiflu) [26] [27] [28] . Oseltamivir at the concentration of 50 mg/ml completely prevented the release of progeny influenza viruses ( Figure 1A ). Noted that a large number of single fluorescent foci caused by initial infection markedly expanded and formed cell clusters consisting of 5-10 infected cells in an MDCK cell monolayer ( Figures 1B and S1 ), suggesting influenza virus can spread to some extent in the presence of oseltamivir. To verify that NA is not involved in this spreading, we generated an NA-deficient influenza virus by a reverse genetics method as described previously [29, 30] . The NAdeficient influenza virus contains a mutated NA segment, in which the NA coding region including a sialidase catalytic domain was replaced with the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) gene [29] . By this replacement, the NA activity is eliminated from the recombinant influenza virus, and EGFP can be utilized as a marker for viral infections. Immunofluorescence analyses demonstrated that the NA-deficient influenza virus also forms infected cell , culture supernatant was collected, and then its virus titer was determined by plaque assays. Each result was represented by a value relative to that in the absence of the drug. Error bars indicate standard deviation (s.d.) from 3 independent experiments. (B) Confluent MDCK cells were infected by wild-type influenza virus A/WSN/33 or NAdeficient influenza virus at MOI of 0.0001 in the presence or absence of 50 mg/ml oseltamivir phosphate. NA-deficient influenza virus was generated by reverse genetics as previously described [29] . After incubation at 37uC for 36 hours, immunofluorescence analyses were performed using anti-nucleoprotein (NP) polyclonal antibody and antirabbit IgG antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 568 (Invitrogen). Scale bar, 100 mm. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0028178.g001 clusters similarly to those formed by wild-type influenza virus in the presence of oseltamivir ( Figure 1B) . The fluorescence pattern of NP overlapped with the localization of GFP derived from the EGFP gene of the NA-deficient influenza virus ( Figure S2 ). Thus, NA-deficient influenza virus can be used to investigate the NAindependent infection pathway of influenza virus.",

The virus started to spread from an infected cell to adjacent cells in 5-6 hours after the first appearance of a GFP-positive cell ( Figure 2 and Video S1). The spreading rate was clearly faster than the rate of cell divisions. The mean doubling time of uninfected MDCK cells was 20-24 hours under the condition employed here, and it is expected that the proliferation speed would be much slowly because infected MDCK cells were maintained in the serum-free medium and formed cell monolayer at the high cell density. These suggest that NA-deficient influenza viruses may infect adjacent cells through the cell-to-cell transmission mechanism without apparent production of cell-free virions.",

Amantadine inhibits the early step of uncoating of influenza virus RNP from virion in endosomes [33, 34] . For this study, other influenza virus strain, influenza virus A/Udorn/72, was used instead of influenza virus A/WSN/33 because influenza virus A/ WSN/33 is highly resistant to amantadine [35] . We confirmed that influenza virus A/Udorn/72 is sensitive to oseltamivir ( Figure  S3 ) and could also spread via cell-to-cell transmission independent of the NA activity as did for influenza virus A/WSN/33 ( Figures 1B and 4B ). In the case of a single administration of amantadine, fluorescent foci derived from infected cells scattered, and the number of single foci was greatly decreased compared with that in the absence of the drugs. In contrast, a single administration of oseltamivir, fluorescent foci formed some clusters and expanded in a time-dependent manner ( Figure 4B ). This dissimilarity of inhibitory manner was caused by the difference of the sites of action between amantadine and oseltamivir. Amantadine inhibits the replication of influenza A virus by preventing the translocation of vRNP complexes from endosomes to the cytoplasm, whereas oseltamivir has no effects on viral replication itself but inhibits the release of cell-free virions from infected host cells. We investigated the inhibitory effect of amantadine on the cell-to-cell transmission of influenza viruses. The formation of infected cell clusters was observed with co-administration of amantadine and oseltamivir, as well as with a single administration of oseltamivir ( Figure 4B ). However, the quantitative analysis revealed that the size of infected cell clusters with the coadministration were decreased as compared to that with oseltamivir alone ( Figure 4C ). These observations indicated that the NA activity-independent cell-to-cell transmission of influenza virus was susceptible to the inhibitory effect of amantadine, suggesting that the cell-to-cell transmission undergoes through endocytosis but vRNP complex itself is not incorporated in the infected cells by adjacent cells.",

In the case of the cell-to-cell transmission of influenza virus in the presence of oseltamivir, it is possible that a progeny virion is temporarily bridged by HA between an infected cell and adjacent uninfected cells, since viruses can not be released from infected cell surface due to the inhibition of the NA activity by oseltamivir. The cellassociated progeny virion may have an opportunity to re-infect the previously infected cell, compared to a cell-free progeny virion in the general spreading. Thus, we examined whether influenza viruses can infect the cell which had already been infected, using ts53 mutant and wild-type influenza virus A/WSN/33. ts53 virus has a substitution mutation from U to C at the nucleotide position of 701 in the PA gene. This substitution introduces an amino acid change from wild-type Leu 226 to Pro 226 and gives a defect in the viral genome replication process [47, 48] . At first, cells were infected with ts53 virus at moi of 10, and after incubation for 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 hours, cells were superinfected with wild-type virus at moi of 10. The amount of segment 3 viral RNA (vRNA) encoding PA was determined quantitatively by RT-PCR. Then, using a mutated primer for PCR, we could introduce a Stu I site only in the PCR products derived from the wild-type sequence ( Figure 6A ). Thus, DNA fragments amplified from the wild-type and ts53 could be distinguished by Stu I digestion. The digested DNA fragments containing 220 and 199 base pairs derived from ts53 and wildtype, respectively, were separated through PAGE. After 6 hours or later post infection, re-infection with the second challenging virus hardly occurs in the absence of oseltamivir. However, in the presence of oseltamivir, appearance of wild-type fragment suggests that the re-infection had occurred ( Figure 6B ). The result indicates that progeny virus particles remain on the surface of infected cell even after budding, and can infect the cell previously infected, as well as uninfected cells adjacent to the infected cell, when oseltamivir is present.",

            "text": "With the except for the virus which spreads through the cell-cell fusion transmission, virus infection is initiated by the binding of cell-free virions to their host cells. Recently, the virus transmission mechanism from an infected cell to adjacent cells without virus diffusion into the extracellular environment is highlighted from the aspect of its significance in virus spreading in the presence of antibodies [1, 2] . This antibody-insensitive pathway is often called cell-to-cell transmission [2] . The cell-to-cell transmission may be categorized into two pathways, i.e., transmission of cell-free virions to adjacent uninfected cells, and transmission of progeny virions associated on the surface of an infected cell even after budding through narrow synaptic space between an infected cell and adjacent uninfected cells. As an example of the former mechanism, cell-free vaccinia virus particles associated with the filopodium of an infected cell are repelled toward neighboring uninfected cells by inducing the formation of actin filament [3] . Several cases have been reported for the latter mechanism: Immunotropic viruses including retroviruses utilize the immunological synapses [4] [5] [6] [7] . Immune cells are not constitutively polarized, but contain the machinery that directs their secretory apparatus towards a cell that is involved in an immunological synapse. This machinery can be subverted by retroviruses containing human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). An HIV-infected cell can polarize viral budding towards a target cell expressing receptor through a structure called a virological synapse. Virions bud from an infected cell into a synaptic cleft, from which they fuse with the target-cell plasma membrane [49] [50] [51] [52] . The progeny virions of HCV are trapped between infected and uninfected cell membranes at the tight junction. Using Claudin-1 known as a component of the tight junction and one of the entry factors of HCV [8] , virions fuse with and penetrate uninfected target cells [31] . Therefore, HCV may acquire the ability to spread within polarized liver epithelium. Thus, the cell-to-cell transmission certainly plays significant roles for the dissemination of several enveloped viruses. However, the cell-to-cell transmission of influenza virus has not been discussed well. Here, we have shown that influenza virus spreads by forming infected cell clusters even in the presence of an NA inhibitor. Live cell imaging clearly showed that influenza virus lacking the NA activity spreads from an infected cell to adjacent cells through the cell-to-cell transmission mechanism (Figure 2 ). This was also the case for wild-type influenza virus during early phases of infection ( Figure 4B ). In the cell-to-cell transmission of influenza virus, progeny virions could remain associated with the surface of infected cell even after budding, and then these progeny virions can be passed on to adjacent uninfected cells.",

The viral spreading in the absence of oseltamivir appears to be much faster compared to the viral spreading in the presence of the drug, suggesting that NA could be involved in determination of spreading speed ( Figure 4B ). The NA activity prevented progeny virions from entering cells which virus came from (Figure 6 ), implying that progeny virus particles should be transmitted to adjacent uninfected cells. The cell-to-cell transmission started in early phase of infection, and the virus spread through diffusion of cell-free viruses ( Figure 4B ). Indeed, it was reported that the cell-to-cell transmission is a rapid spreading pathway in the case of vaccinia virus [3] . Vaccinia virus induces a blocking mechanism of superinfection and thereby infects to adjacent uninfected cells efficiently. In early phases of vaccinia virus infection, viral proteins A33 and A36 are expressed at the infected cell surface. Once cell-free virus particles contact the filopodium, the A33/A36 complex induces the formation of actin filament, which causes this superinfected virion to be repelled toward uninfected cells [3] . Influenza viruses can re-infect the cells previously infected in the presence of oseltamivir (Figure 6 ), suggesting that a progeny virion may be bridged by HA between infected and adjacent uninfected cells temporarily. Thus, in the case of the cell-to-cell transmission of influenza virus, we propose that progeny virions associated with the surface of infected cells even after budding are directed to adjacent uninfected cells. The cell-to-cell transmission mechanism of influenza virus is distinctly different from that of vaccinia virus in the infecting virus status: Infected cell-associated virions and cell-free virions are involved in the cell-to-cell transmission of influenza virus and vaccinia virus, respectively. The strategy for influenza virus appears to be similar to that for HCV. HCV progeny virions budded from an infected cell are trapped between infected and uninfected adjacent cell membranes at the tight junction. HCV virions then, enter into adjacent cells through endocytosis and low pH-dependent membrane fusion using Claudin-1 [8] . The cell-to-cell transmission of influenza virus also required functional HA and endosome acidification by M2 ion channel. However, it has not been reported that HCV has a gene encoding a receptor destroying enzyme similar to NA of influenza virus. We speculated that HCV progeny particles are bridged between infected and adjacent uninfected cells temporarily like influenza virus in the presence of oseltamivir. Progeny influenza virus particles could be transmitted to adjacent uninfected cells efficiently in the presence of the NA activity, suggesting that the cell-to-cell transmission of influenza virus is more strategic than that of HCV.",

For reverse genetics, we used plasmids containing cDNAs of the influenza virus A/WSN/33 viral genome under the control of the human RNA polymerase I promoter (referred to as Pol I plasmids). Briefly, 293T cells were transfected with seven Pol I plasmids for production of all vRNA segments of influenza virus A/WSN/33 and one for the mutant NA vRNA segment containing EGFP ORF, together with protein expression vectors for PB2, PB1, PA, and NP controlled by the chicken b-actin promoter (pCAGGS). TransIT-293 (Mirus) was used for transfection. At 24 hours post transfection, recombinant viruses were harvested from the cell surface using bacterial NA derived from Clostridium perfringens (sigma). MDCK cells were infected with harvested recombinant viruses treated with N-tosyl-L-phenyl-alanine chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-trypsin (1 mg/ml). After confirmation of GFP fluorescence derived from amplified recombinant virus genomes at 48 hours after infection, the recombinant viruses on the cell surface were collected using bacterial NA. The viral titer of recombinant viruses was determined by counting the number of infected foci using a fluorescence microscopy (Carl Zeiss).",

This substitution introduces an amino acid change from wild-type Leu 226 to Pro 226 and gives a defect in the viral genome replication process [48] . However, under the permissive temperature, the level of viral genome replication is no difference between wild-type and ts53 [47] . To discriminate the genome of wild-type and that of ts53, total RNA was reverse-transcribed by reverse transcriptase (TOYOBO) with PA-895-rev (59-TTAATTTTAAGGCATC-CATCAGCAGG-39), which is complementary to the segment 3 positive sense RNA. The cDNA was amplified by PCR using primers, PA-895-rev and PA-695-cut (59-TCTCCCGCCA-AACTTCTCAGGCC-39) partially corresponding to segment 3 positive sense RNA between nucleotide sequence positions 678 to 700 except for nucleotide positions 696 and 697. Since segment 3 of ts53 has a substitution mutation from U to C at the nucleotide position of 701, the PCR product derived from wild-type was digested by Stu I but not that from ts53. After PCR reactions, PCR products were digested with Stu I and separated through PAGE. Large and small fragments derived from ts53 and wild-type viruses were 220 and 199 base pairs, respectively. DNA was stained with GelRed (BIOTIUM) and visualized by UV illumination.",

(B) MDCK cells were infected with influenza virus A/Udorn/72 at moi of 0.0001 in the presence or absence of 50 mM amantadine or 50 mg/ml oseltamivir phosphate. Amantadine at the concentration of 50 mM almost completely inhibited the production of progeny virions (data not shown). After incubation for 12, 24, and 48 h, immunofluorescence analyses were performed using anti-NP antibody and anti-rabbit IgG antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 (Invitrogen). Viral NP and nuclear DAPI staining are shown in green and blue, respectively. Scale bar, 100 mm. (C) Median sizes of clusters were shown as box plots summarizing sizes of 60 individual infectious foci formed in the presence of oseltamivir alone, or both oseltamivir and amantadine. Immunofluorescence analyses were performed as described in (B) at 24 hpi. Boxes enclose the lower and upper quartiles; thick horizontal lines represent the median; dashed lines indicate the extreme values; and black dots are outliers of individual infectious foci. The size of infectious foci was measured with AxioVision Release 4.7.2 imaging software (Carl Zeiss).
