This study represents the first attempt to characterise viral aetiologies of ILIs in Bolivia. Methods: It was performed in Santa Cruz city from January 2010 to September 2012, based on 564 naso-pharyngeal swabs collected in a National Reference Laboratory and real-time PCR techniques, viral cultures and phylogenetic analyses. Results: 50.2% of samples were positive for at least one virus with influenza viruses (Flu A:~15%; Flu B:~9%), rhinoviruses (~8%), coronaviruses (~5%) and hRSV (~4%) being the most frequently identified. The pattern of viral infections varied according to age groups. The elucidation rate was the highest (>60%) amongst patients under 10 yo and the lowest (<40%) amongst patients \u226560 yo. Nearly 3% of samples showed dual viral infections. Epidemiological peaks were associated with a predominant virus but generally included 30-50% of infections by different viruses. Unexpectedly, the frequency of influenza in the 0-4 yo population was very low and a complete hRSV eclipse occurred in 2011. Genetic analyses indicated that distinct evolutionary lineages of Flu A(H1N1)pdm2009, Flu A/H3N2 and Flu B have co-circulated in Bolivia in the study period, originating from Central and North America, Europe, Asia and Australia. Conclusion: Our results emphasise the requirement for a reinforced epidemiological and genetic follow-up of influenza and other ILIs in Bolivia to further inform the preparation of vaccines used in the region, guide vaccination campaigns and improve the medical management of patients.",

Besides the issue of bacterial pneumonia, which represents a frequent cause of mortality in paediatric populations of developing countries, there is an increasing interest in the epidemiology and characterization of Influenza Like Illnesses (ILIs), which are predominantly of viral aetiology [4] . First, ILIs are responsible for a large number of cases in all age groups (with a specifically high frequency in children) and despite their frequent association with a mild clinical presentation, their medical and socio-economical impact is enormous [5] . Second, a proportion of ILIs is associated with severe clinical evolution [6] . In adults, viruses are the putative causative agents in a third of cases of community-acquired pneumonia, in particular influenza viruses, rhinoviruses, and coronaviruses. Dual viral infections are common, and a large proportion of children have evidence of viral-bacterial co-infection [4] . Deciphering the epidemiological and pathophysiological links between viral primary infection and secondary bacterial super-infection and pneumonia currently represents a major challenge for improving the prevention and medical management of pneumonia.",

We did not attempt to build a representative sample of specimens received at CENETROP (supposedly poorly representative of ILIs in the general population of Santa Cruz), but rather examined a similar number of samples in each age group to allow a comprehensive aetiological analysis in all age classes. Our final sample has equivalent numbers of swabs in the 0-9, 10-19, 20-29 and 30-39 age classes (90 to 98 per class) but slightly lower numbers in the older classes (40-49: 70; 50-59: 59; \u226560: 61) due to the limited number of samples received at CENETROP for these age groups. As expected, it under-represents the 0-9 years old (yo) age group (which includes~35% of eligible samples received), and over-represents the 30-39, 40-49, 50-59 and \u226560 yo age groups (Additional file 1). The general characteristics and distribution of cases are presented in Table 1 . The gender ratio (M/F) is 0.84 and the history of influenza vaccination clearly shows that a limited proportion of the population received influenza vaccines, in particular in the elderly (0.53% have received at least one dose of influenza vaccine in their life in the \u226560 yo age group).",

Peaks of detection matched peaks of reception of samples, which globally followed the seasonal subtropical pattern of ILIs observed in Bolivia, with one peak during the austral autumn and a second during the austral winter season. In 2010, a great number of samples could be studied (257) allowing to precisely follow several peaks of activity corresponding to a mosaic of viruses including Flu B, hRSV, hRV, Flu A A/H3N2 and A (H1N1)pdm09 and hCoV E229&OC43. In 2011 and 2012, the number of samples studied annually was lower (163 and 144, respectively), but still sufficient to elucidate the main peaks of activity with a major incidence of Flu A (H1N1)pdm09 in 2011 and Flu B in 2012, co-circulating with a variety of other viruses (see Figure 2C ). Epidemiological peaks were generally associated with a predomin- This is summarised in Figure 1C that shows a clear epidemiological evolution. In 2010, following the 2009 Flu A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic wave, influenza A infections were for the most part due to Flu A/H3N2 and associated to a large number of Flu B and rhinovirus infections and a variety of less prevalent viruses. By contrast, year 2011 was characterised by the massive come back of Flu A(H1N1)pdm09, the low number of Flu B, the emergence of a large number of hCoV E229&OC43 infections and the absence of hRSV infections. In 2012, the situation changed again with a large number of Flu B and hRSV infections and the persistence of a significant proportion of rhinovirus and Flu A(H1N1)pdm09 infections. Altogether, this provides a striking picture of a moving infection pattern, which is presumably modelled by the herd immunity in the most epidemiologically susceptible populations. The complete disappearance of hRSV infections in 2011 represents a specific case that was never encountered by the authors in Europe.",

Firstly, the great year-to-year variation of infection epidemiological patterns is a reminder that the epidemiology of ILIs should be studied over long periods of time. Each of the three years studied here would have provided, if analysed separately, a partial view of the situation and would have lead to erroneous conclusions (e.g., the absence of hRSV infections in Bolivian children extrapolated from 2011 data). The analysis of a 3-year period is expected to smooth such epidemiological jolts but an extended observation period would have undoubtedly revealed more information about the viruses that circulated at low rates in the period studied (e.g., parechoviruses, parainfluenzaviruses). Secondly, Bolivia includes territories with diverse geographical, climatic and ecological characteristics. Santa Cruz is located in an eastern low-altitude area with a humid tropical climate whilst La Paz is in a western Andean high-altitude area with a colder and dryer climate [11] . This may explain important epidemiological differences observed between both cities, as exemplified by the case of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09: in 2010, we observed a very limited number of Flu A(H1N1)pdm09 infections in Santa Cruz whilst the PAHO surveillance system reported an intense circulation of the virus in La Paz during the first months of the year (PAHO surveillance website: http://ais.paho. org/phip/viz/ed_flu.asp); in 2011, a large outbreak occurred in Santa Cruz (see Figures 1 and 2) , whilst only a few cases were observed in La Paz; in 2012, an important outbreak was observed in La Paz, but not in Santa Cruz. This clearly indicates that epidemiological data collected in Santa Cruz cannot be extrapolated easily to the Andean regions of Bolivia. Divergent influenza epidemiological patterns according to geographical distribution were finely documented in a previous Peruvian study [7] .",

The distribution of cases in age groups is also essentially similar with what was reported elsewhere, e.g., in Ecuador [8] . The most surprising items, which deserve investigations on an extended period of time, were the unusually low frequency of influenza infections in the 0-4 yo age group and the complete RSV eclipse in 2011. However, precise comparison with data collected in South America is most often difficult, e.g., with a molecular study in Ecuador [8] and a previous large study in Peru [7] (different periods investigated, viruses detected using immunofluorescence tests, parechoviruses, coronaviruses, metapneumoviruses and rhinoviruses not tested).",

All specimens had been sampled between day 0 and day 4 following clinical onset, sent to the laboratory at room temperature using a universal transport media and kept at \u221220\u00b0C upon reception. All patients or their legal representative gave oral consent for the shipment of samples to CENETROP and the detection of respiratory pathogens. To provide a preliminary report of viral aetiologies in all age groups (i.e., information that may be translated easily for Public health purposes), a random selection of an equivalent number of samples was operated in age groups (0-9, 10-19, 20-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59 and \u226560 years of age) for each year of the study.",

Victoria-related Bolivian isolates appear in two distinct clusters, together with other South American isolates (Figure 3). The first cluster, supported by a 98% bootstrap resampling value (Additional file 2), includes the 2012 Bolivian isolates, together with a vast majority of Central and South American isolates in the 2010-2012 period and a limited number of isolates from different origin (Asia, North America, Australia). According to the tree topology, the 2012 South American cluster may originate from 2010 Australian isolates (observed both at the root and within this cluster). The second cluster, supported by a 100% bootstrap value (Additional file 3), includes the 2010 Bolivian isolates, together with other Bolivian and South American isolates in the same period. The third cluster (within the Yagamata lineage), supported by a 94% bootstrap value (Additional file 4), seems to be issued from 2007 Asian isolates and includes one 2012 Bolivian isolate, together with a variety of other Bolivian, Central and South American, North American and Asian isolates in the 2007-2012 period.Altogether, these results demonstrate the co-circulation of viruses from different lineages in Bolivia and the existence of a global epidemiological system in which influenza B of various origin (presumably most frequently from Australia, Asia and North America) circulate in Central and South America.Influenza A/H3N2Figure 4 presents a tree reconstructed from 2,643 HA sequences. It illustrates the genetic drift of H3N2 viruses since 1991, but also the limited information available regarding South American strains before 2008. Sequences from H3N2 2011-2012 Bolivian isolates appear in 3 clusters in the so-called Victoria/208 lineage. Cluster 1 (Additional file 5) includes a 2012 Bolivian isolate, together with isolates of various geographical origins. The 2012 South American isolates group with 2011 Asian and Australian isolates and may therefore be epidemiologicaly linked.

The 2011 Bolivian isolates were collected from October to December and are related to German strains collected in February 2011, suggesting the circulation in Bolivia during the 2011 (South hemisphere) influenza season of viruses derived from those that circulated in Europe at the end of the previous (North hemisphere) influenza season. The presence in the same cluster (100% bootstrap support) of Bolivian strains that circulated during the first 2012 influenza epidemic peak (March 2012, Figure 2) indicates that the virus has been continuously circulating at low level after November 2011 and reveals the possible persistent viral circulation over long periods (possibly a one-year periodfrom August 2011 to July 2012-according to Figure 2).",
