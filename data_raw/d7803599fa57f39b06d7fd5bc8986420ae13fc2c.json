In this study, extensive investigations were conducted on the genome sequences, antigenicity, pathogenicity, and host immune responses of several IBV strains in specific-pathogen-free chickens. Sequence analyses revealed that 3575/08 and 2575/98 shared high homology in their structural genes, but not in non-structural accessory proteins such as 3a, 3b and 5b. Despite a high degree of homology in their spike protein genes, cross neutralization test showed low cross protection between 3575/08 and 2575/98, suggesting distinct antigenicity for the two strains. Animal challenge experiments exhibited strong respiratory and renal pathogenicity for 3575/08. In addition, early and prolonged viral shedding and rapid viral dissemination were observed. Immune gene expression profiling by PCR array showed chickens infected with 3575/08 had delayed expression of a subset of early innate immune genes, whereas chickens infected with the wild-type or attenuatedtype 2575/08 revealed quick gene induction and efficient virus control. In summary, this study reveals a new IBV strain, which harbors a known local genotype but displays remarkably altered antigenicity, pathogenicity and host defenses.",

Respiratory signs such as coughing, sneezing, and nasal discharge are the primary symptoms associated with IBV infections, and some of the strains also display kidney and oviduct tropisms, causing urogenital symptoms 1-3 . The disease poses economic threat to the poultry industry worldwide. More than 50 serotypes of IBV have been documented since the first isolation of virus in Massachusetts (Mass), US in the 1930 s 2 . The most commonly detected genotype of IBV in the US is Ark-DPI, accounting for 23% to 65% of total isolation per year 4 . While most strains circulating in the US cause respiratory symptoms, nephropathogenic QX-like strains are dominant in Europe 2 . In the Far East, nephropathogenic LX4, LDL as well as proventricular-type QX-like strains have been reported frequently 2 . Presently, vaccination is adopted to manage the disease, and Mass type vaccine H120 is the most widely used vaccine formulation 2,5 . Due to frequent strain variations, however, traditional Mass type vaccines can be ineffective against infections by different IBV variants 2,5,6 . Effective disease management thus demands better elucidation of strain variations.",

The four structural proteins include spike glycoprotein (S), envelope protein (E), membrane glycoprotein (M), and nucleocapsid protein (N). Of the different structural proteins, the S protein, which comprises of S1 and S2 subunits, is responsible for host cell attachment and virus-cell membrane fusion and is the primary antigen target for virus neutralization. Currently, genetic grouping for IBV is based primarily on the S1 gene 1-3 . Among the genes that encode for non-structural proteins, the ORF 1a and 1ab encode two polyproteins, which are further cleaved into 15 nsps. These and other non-structural accessory proteins 3a, 3b, 5a and 5b are associated with RNA replication, virulence, and host-pathogen interactions of IBV 3 .

In general, toll like receptor (TLR) families, retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5, encoded by IFIH1 gene) are intracellular pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) that function as viral infection detectors and all contribute to type I interferon (IFN) production 15 . As RIG-I is absent in chickens, IFIH1 is a functional compensate 16 . Avian TLRs are different from their mammalian counterparts, lacking TLR9 but possessing TLR1LA, poultry-specific TLR15, and a TLR9 homologue TLR21 17 . TLR3 and TLR7 are known to be involved in RNA virus recognition, and its stimulation leads to activation of IRF3 and IRF7 (IFN-regulatory factor 3 and 7) . These factors then signal IFN transcription to trigger IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) through JAK-STAT pathway to express various antiviral proteins 15, 17, 18 . A global gene expression profiling of chicken kidney has revealed that 103 immune and inflammatory-related genes are involved in the host defense response during the first week of IBV infection 19 . The TLR3/7 and MDA5 signaling pathways and innate immune cytokine were induced after IBV infection in chicken tracheas at 3-8 days post IBV M41 infection 20 . In addition, STAT1 expression has also been found to be significantly elevated in response to IBV infection in ovo 21 .

However, a novel TW-I strain 3575/08 emerged from a broiler chicken farm where the 2575 AT vaccine was applied. IBV 3575/08 has been observed to cause high morbidity and mortality in affected broilers. In the present study, we compared the viral genome sequences of IBV 3575/08 and 2575/98 and investigated the infectivity and host immunity induced by 3575/08, 2575 WT, and 2575 AT infections. To this end, sequence analysis, neutralization test, experimental infection, and immune-related gene profiling were performed. The results show that IBV 3575/08, which possesses heterologous ORF 3a, 3b, and 5b sequences to 2575/98, caused a more deadly infection with early and prolonged viral shedding, stronger clinical and pathological manifestation, and delayed innate immune responses as compared to 2575 WT and 2575 AT.",

Excluding the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 untranslated regions the entire genome size is 26,704 nucleotides. The genome comprises ten ORFs in the order of 5\u2032 -1a-1ab-S-3a-3b-E-M-5a-5b-N-3\u2032 . No significant protein truncation was observed. To evaluate the nucleotide sequence identities among 3575/08 and other reference IBV strains, sequence alignment and phylogenetic analyses on each gene segment were performed ( Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. S1 ). Comparisons of the available full-length genome showed that the sequence identities between 3575/08 and other IBV strains ranged from 85.0% (with strain BJ) to 94.9% (with strain 2575/98). Overall, IBV 3575/08 showed close genetic grouping with 2575/98 and other Taiwan local strains in 1a, 1b, S, E, M, 5a and N genes. The sequence similarities of these protein genes between 3575/08 and 2575/98 were 95.6% (1a), 94.2% (1b), 95.6% (S), 93.3% (E), 92.4% (M), 93.4% (5a), and 96.3% (N) for the respective genes. Further comparison of the two spike protein subunits between 3575/08 and 2575/98 showed sequence similarities of 97.1% and 94.4% in the S1 and S2 subunits, respectively. Based on the S gene, 3575/08 was clearly defined as a TW-I strain. The sequence identities of S gene between 3575/08 and other analyzed strains ranged from 67.6% (with strain Georgia 1998 pass8) to 96.4% (with strain 3468/07). While 3575/08 was closely related to 2575/98 in four structural protein genes, their homology in ORF 3a (86.1%), 3b (82.1%), and 5b (95.5%) were relatively low (4.5% difference is considered significant for the 5b protein since its variation among IBV strains is small).

IBV 3575/08-infected chickens showed similar but more severe clinical signs at 2 dpi (score = 1.4) and 3 dpi (score = 1.2). At 4 dpi, more than half of 3575/08-infected chickens still suffered from mild respiratory symptoms (score = 0.6), and clinical signs receded after 5 dpi. In contrast, IBV 2575 AT-infected and PBS control groups did not show any clinical manifestations throughout the observation period. Collectively, over a 7-day observation period, the averaged clinical scores of IBV 3575/08-, 2575 WT-, 2575 AT-infected chickens were 0.49, 0.32, and 0, respectively (Fig. 2C) . Overall, IBV 3575/08 infection caused stronger clinical manifestations in chickens than 2575 WT and 2575 AT.",

Lesions in the 2575 WT (Fig. 3B ) and 2575 AT (Fig. 3C ) groups were similar but less severe as compared to the 3575/08 group. Upon observing the kidneys, the control group showed normal renal tubular epithelial cell with homogeneous plasma and distinctive renal tubular cavities (Fig. 3H ). In the kidneys of IBV 3575/08-infected chickens, however, renal tubule dilation, necrotic tubular cells, and urate in the tubular cavity were observed (Fig. 3E , arrowed). Vesicular degeneration was also observed in the renal tubular epithelial cells from the 2575 WT group (Fig. 3F, arrowed) . On the other hand, the 2575 AT group showed normal kidney patterns similar to the control group (Fig. 3G ). The pathological findings indicate that both IBV 3575/08 and 2575 WT are respiratory and nephropathogenic strains. IBV 3575/08 showed higher virulence as it inflicted more severe trachea and renal tissue damages in chickens than the 2575 WT strain. No virulence in the kidney was observed for IBV 2575 AT.",

Next, to dissect the antiviral gene induction in chickens in response to IBV 3575/08, 2575 WT and 2575 AT infections, we examined a panel of immune response gene expression in the lung at 24 and 48 hours after the IBV infections using a quantitative PCR array kit. The fold changes in the expression of 84 genes from infected chickens were normalized to that of naive chickens (Fig. 5A , also see Supplementary Table S3 for innate immunity genes (TLR1LA, TLR3, IRF7, STAT1, and C3) (Fig. 5B ). 6 other genes upregulated by 2575 WT and AT at 24 hpi, including TLR4, MyD88, IFNA3, IFNGR1, CD28, and CATH2, showed delayed stimulation following the 3575/08 infection (Fig. 5C ). In addition, 10 other genes that were not enhanced in either the 2575 WT or the 2575 AT group were found to be upregulated in the 3575/08 group at 48 hpi. The finding suggests that IBV 3575/08 may have evaded the initial virus sensing and delayed the signaling pathways for early antiviral defense.",

            "text": "The spread of TW type IBV in Taiwan has been attributed to poor protection by commercial Mass type vaccines 23 . An effective TW type vaccine strain 2575 AT has been previously developed through serial passages in SPF embryonated eggs to control IBV infection in Taiwan. However, a new IBV strain 3575/08 emerged from 2575 AT-vaccinated broiler chickens and caused high morbidity and mortality. To characterize the new strain 3575/08, comparative analyses on viral genotype, serotype and pathogenicity were conducted. Pairwise sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis revealed that 3575/08 and 2575/98 share high homology in most of the structural protein genes, including the S1 gene that are commonly applied for IBV strain genotyping. Therefore, IBV 3575/08 was grouped in the TW-I genotype with 2575/98 and other strains. It has been reported that the serotype of IBV is associated with the hypervariable region (HVR) 1 in the N-terminus (residues 45-114) of the S1 gene 24 , which overlaps with one of the antigenic sites located in the spike protein of IBV 25 . Despite high sequence similarities between 3575/08 and 2575/98 were found in the spike protein gene (95.6%), S1 subunit gene (97.1%) and HVR 1 (94.8%), a distinct serotype of 3575/08 was clearly established in this study through a cross neutralization test. Similar findings were previously reported in UK showing that IBV strains of three distinct serotypes possess as little as 2% of amino acid variations in region 19-122 and 251-347 of the S1 subunit 26 . The variations led to failure of cross-protection 27 , supporting that small sequence differences can result in a serotype change. In addition, it has been reported that small sequence changes in the S2 subunit may alter interactions with the S1 subunit, which could in turn affect the conformation of the S1 subunit and serotype-specific epitopes 28 . A previous study on murine hepatitis virus (MHV), a group II coronavirus, also showed that a single amino acid substitution in region 1109-1116 of S2 subunit can confer resistance to neutralization by S1 subunit-specific monoclonal antibody 29 . Therefore, the gene variations in the S2 subunit (5.6%) between 3575/08 and 2575/98 may have a significant contribution to the serotype difference. Future studies are warranted to further examine the determinants of antigenicity. In addition to the new serotype, we also found that IBV 3575/08 exhibited higher mortality and more profound clinical signs as compared to 2575 WT and 2575 AT through experimental challenges in chickens. Following intranasal infection, IBV 3575/08 had a very short latent period. The viral shedding from cloaca was detected as early as 24 hpi and lasted for 21 days, and a rapid viral dissemination to renal tissues (3 dpi) was observed. As it has been documented that spike proteins play a major role in determining viruses' cell tropism and pathogenicity 30 , the increased IBV 3575/08 virulence is a notable finding given the high degree of homology between the spike protein genes between IBV 3575/08 and 2575 WT.",

We hypothesized that a different innate immune response may account for the altered pathogenicity of IBV 3575/08. Therefore, the early immune-related gene expression in the lung following 3575/08, 2575 WT and 2575 AT infections in chickens was analyzed by PCR arrays. In contrast to the 20 and 33 genes activated in the 2575 WT-and 2575 AT-infected chickens, only a small subset of the genes was triggered in the 3575/08-infected chickens at 24 hpi, and a delayed activation was observed at 48 hpi. This result suggests that IBV 3575/08 has the potential to evade the initial virus sensing and suppress the first wave of host defense, leading to enhanced pathogenicity observed in this study. Many coronaviruses have the ability to evade detection by the host's immune system and disrupt the host immune response through multiple mechanisms [32] [33] [34] . It has been reported that small accessary proteins 3a and 3b of IBV can delay the onset of IFN response by interfering with the PRR sensing without disrupting the signaling pathways 35 . Previous studies have also demonstrated that 3a and 3b accessory proteins of IBV are not essential for replication but can modulate the IFN-\u03b2 response at the transcriptional and translational level 36, 37 . In addition, 5b accessory protein of IBV has been found to shut off host immune response and limit interferon production 38 . It has been shown that a natural recombinant strain containing partial nsp regions from a low pathogenic H120 strain in the frame of a nephropathogenic strain possesses attenuated pathogenicity, which suggests strong associations between nsps and IBV virulence 39 . Studies on other coronaviruses such as MHV and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) have also shown that nsps are associated with viral replication and evasion of host innate immune response via viral RNA modification 40, 41 , host mRNA degradation, and IFN antagonist competition 42 . Therefore, given the low sequence homology in the accessory proteins 3a, 3b, and 5b between IBV 3575/08 and 2575 WT, we conjecture that these accessary proteins contribute to the blockade of PRR expressions, delayed immune response, and enhanced virulence of IBV 3575/08 in the present study. Future studies are warranted to further dissect the roles of IBV 3575/08's nsps and accessary proteins in modulating host's antiviral defenses. An in vitro infection model with detailed functional analysis of nsps would shed clearer insights on the host-virus interactions.",

For instance, IBV 2575 AT infection activated multiple PRR genes, including IFIH1, TLR1LA, TLR2-2, TLR3, TLR4, TLR7, and TLR15. In addition to the two primary sensors for IBV, TLR3 and TLR7 43 , other PRR molecules have been studied for their roles in coronavirus infections. In previous studies, SARS-CoV and MHV infections have been shown to trigger IFIH1 expression for MDA5 signaling 44, 45 . It has also been reported that TLR4 expression can be induced by SARS-CoV infection 46 . The robust expression of PRR molecules triggered by IBV 2575 AT sheds light on the molecular mechanism behind the strain's attenuated virulence and pathogenicity. In contrast, the lower number of stimulated PRR genes triggered by IBV 3575/08 and 2575 WT serve to explain these viruses' increased virulence.",

            "text": "The present study may also offer insight on IBV disease management and vaccine design. Firstly, identification of a new pathogenic IBV strain with a unique serotype and strong host tropism suggests a rapid viral mutation rate in chicken hosts. This observation raises the need for regular vaccine update to keep up with the mutating viral strains. As the antigenicity or pathogenicity shift may result from genetic changes outside of structural protein genes, antigen derived from a single epitope (eg. spike protein) may not be sufficient in eliciting cross-protection against different serotypes. Multi-epitope vaccine formulations should be considered for better disease management. Secondly, the present study elucidates several key innate immune genes and TLR pathways (eg. TLR3, TLR4, MYD88, IRF7, IFNA3, etc.) responsible for early restriction of IBV infection. When designing an inactivated or subunit vaccine, immunomodulatory adjuvants may be tailored to promote an infection-like immune stimulation as observed in the study. Triggering innate immune gene expressions and TLR pathways in a virus-like manner may facilitate a robust adaptive immune response against IBV infection.",

This virus can also evade the initial virus sensing and delay several early innate immune genes, collectively leading to enhanced pathogenicity in a chicken host. Virus. IBV strain 2575/98 was isolated in Changhua, Taiwan in 1998 8 , and designated 2575 wild-type (2575 WT) throughout this study. Embryo passage 74 of 2575/98 was obtained as previously described 8 , and designated 2575 attenuated-type (2575 AT) throughout this study. IBV strain 2296/95 was isolated in Taoyuan, Taiwan in 1995 8 . Mass type strain H120 was purchased from Abic Biological Lab (Beit Shemesh, Israel). IBV strain 3575/08 was isolated from a broiler farm in Yunlin, Taiwan in October 2008. In that affected farm, death was first observed in 25-day-old broilers with typical IB disease symptoms. The morbidity was higher than 15%, and the mortality was approximately 7.5%. All IBVs used in this study were propagated in 10-day-old SPF embryonated eggs (Animal Health Research Institute, Tamsui, Taiwan) via an allantoic route as previously described 47 . All the used viruses were ensured free of other avian respiratory pathogens, ie. avian influenza virus and Newcastle diseases virus contamination by RT-PCR 48 .

The PCR reaction mixture contains 0.5 \u03bc l of Phire hot start II DNA polymerase (Thermo, Carlsbad, CA), 5 \u03bc l of 5X buffer, 0.5 \u03bc l of 50 \u03bc M forward primer and reverse primer (Tri-I Biotech, Taipei, Taiwan), 3 \u03bc l of 2.5 mM dNTPs (GeneTeks BioScience, Taipei, Taiwan), 5 \u03bc l of cDNA and 10.5 \u03bc l of nuclease-free water. For PCR, the initial denaturation was at 95 \u00b0C for 3 min, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 95 \u00b0C for 1 min, annealing at 55 \u00b0C for 30 s, and extension at 72 \u00b0C for 2 min. The final extension was at 72 \u00b0C for 10 min. All the amplified PCR products were analyzed in 1% agarose gels electrophoresis. DNA sequencing was conducted by a commercial service (Tri-I Biotech). Each nucleotide was determined from at least three identical results generated from separate PCR products. Nucleotide sequences were assembled using DNAStar software (DNAStar, Madison, WI). Sequences of the reference IBV strains were retrieved from GenBank with the accession numbers listed in Supplementary Table S4 . Multiple sequence alignments and sequence identity were analyzed with the Clustal W method available in BioEdit 7.2.5 software.

Antisera production and cross neutralization test. Antisera against 3575/08, 2575/98 and 2296/95 were prepared in 3-week-old SPF chickens as previously described 24 . The antiserum against Mass-type H120 was purchased from Charles River Laboratories (North Franklin, CT). Cross neutralization test was performed with the protocol previously described 24 . Briefly, four-fold diluted sera were incubated with the same volume of 100 EID 50 homologous or heterologous virus at room temperature for an hour, respectively. The virus-serum mixtures were then inoculated into the allantoic cavity of 10-day-old SPF embryonated eggs. Seven days after inoculation, the eggs were opened and examined for typical lesions caused by IBV infection (embryo dwarfing or malformation). The neutralizing titer of each serum against homologous or heterologous virus was determined by the last serum dilution that protected 50% of the embryo and calculated by Reed-Muench method 49 . In addition, the cross neutralization r-values between strains were calculated by the method described by Archetti and Horsfall 51 . Antigenic (serotype) difference between two given strains was defined as follows, when r: 70-100%, same serotype; r: 33-70%, different subtype (minor); r: 11-32%, different subtype (major); r; 0-10%, different serotype 52 .",

Another six chickens received PBS as na\u00efve controls. For the clinicopathological assessment, 2-week-old SPF chickens were used. Following intranasal challenge with 10 6 EID 50 of IBV 3575/08, 2575 WT and 2575 AT, chickens were monitored on a daily basis. The clinical scores of IBV were interpreted according to the methods described by Avellaneda et al. 53 . The clinical signs were evaluated as: 0 = no clinical signs; 1 = slight lacrimation, slight shaking, watering feces or tracheal rales; 2 = lacrimation, presence of nasal exudate, depression, water feces, apparent sneezing or cough; 3 = same as 2 but stronger with severe watery feces; 4 = death. Throat and cloacal swabs were collected at 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, 21 dpi for virus detection. In addition, lungs and kidneys were also harvested from euthanized chickens at 3, 7, 21 dpi for virus detection and histopathological examination.

Following three washes, 100 \u03bc l of 1:2,000 diluted peroxidase-conjugated affinipure rabbit anti-chicken IgG (H + L) (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) was dispensed into each well and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. After three additional washes, the wells were then incubated with 100 \u03bc l of SureBlue Reserve TMB Microwell Peroxidase Substrate (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD) for 10 min in the dark. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 100 \u03bc l of TMB stop solution (KPL). The optical density (OD) at 450 nm was read using an automated plate reader (Thermo).",

At 48 hpi, 16 (19%), 3 (3.6%), and 3 (3.6%) genes were induced by more than 3-fold over the naive group in the 3575/08-, 2575 WT-, and 2575 AT-infected chicken, respectively. Overall, a robust immune-related gene expression was rapidly induced in the 2575 WT-and 2575 AT-infected chickens at 24 hpi, and a 90% overlap was observed among the upregulated genes between the two groups. These results identified the critical components in early host defense against IBV 2575 WT and 2575 AT.
