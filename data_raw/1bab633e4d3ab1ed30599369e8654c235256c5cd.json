Recently, we reported that inactivation of a single HA-activating protease gene, Tmprss2, in knockout mice inhibits the spread of H1N1 influenza viruses. However, after infection of Tmprss2 knockout mice with an H3N2 influenza virus, only a slight increase in survival was observed, and mice still lost body weight. In this study, we investigated an additional trypsin-like protease, TMPRSS4. Both TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS4 are expressed in the same cell types of the mouse lung. Deletion of Tmprss4 alone in knockout mice does not protect them from body weight loss and death upon infection with H3N2 influenza virus. In contrast, Tmprss2 \u060a/\u060a Tmprss4 \u060a/\u060a double-knockout mice showed a remarkably reduced virus spread and lung pathology, in addition to reduced body weight loss and mortality. Thus, our results identified TMPRSS4 as a second host cell protease that, in addition to TMPRSS2, is able to activate the HA of H3N2 influenza virus in vivo.",

Due to high variability of the virus genome, resistance to available antiviral drugs is frequently observed, and new targets for treatment of influenza are needed. Host cell factors essential for processing of the virus hemagglutinin represent very suitable drug targets because the virus is dependent on these host factors for replication. We reported previously that Tmprss2-deficient mice are protected against H1N1 virus infections, but only marginal protection against H3N2 virus infections was observed. Here we show that deletion of two host protease genes, Tmprss2 and Tmprss4, strongly reduced viral spread as well as lung pathology and resulted in increased survival after H3N2 virus infection. Thus, TMPRSS4 represents another host cell factor that is involved in cleavage activation of H3N2 influenza viruses in vivo.",

Several pandemics, such as the Spanish flu (1918) , Asian flu (1957) , and Hong Kong flu (1968), caused millions of deaths in the last century (1) . Currently, only two therapies, targeting the viral proteins neuraminidase and M2, are approved to treat influenza. Therefore, novel viral or host targets for antiviral strategies to block viral replication or inhibit cellular proteins necessary for the virus life cycle are urgently needed (2) . In this context, host proteases are a group of very promising antiviral targets, because proteolytic cleavage of the precursor hemagglutinin (HA 0 ) into HA 1 and HA 2 subunits by host proteases is essential for fusion of HA with the endosomal membrane and thus represents an essential step for infectivity of the virus (3, 4) . Due to the potential risk of side effects after application of broadband protease inhibitors, the specific inhibition of a single enzyme would convey a huge therapeutic benefit.",

In vitro studies with cultured human respira-tory epithelial cells demonstrated the involvement of several membrane-associated proteases (9) . Cell culture studies further identified, among others, the transmembrane serine proteases TMPRSS2, TMPRSS4, and TMPRSS11D as enzymes able to cleave the HAs of influenza virus subtypes H1 and H3 (10) (11) (12) . We previously showed that deletion of Tmprss2 in knockout mice strongly limits viral spread and lung pathology after H1N1 influ-enza A virus infection (13) . An essential role for TMPRSS2 in cleavage activation and viral spread was also reported for H7N9 influenza A virus (14, 15) . We also demonstrated that deletion of Tmprss2 slightly reduced body weight loss and mortality in mice after H3N2 virus infection compared to those for wild-type mice but did not protect mice from lethal infections (13, 15) . Therefore, it is likely that in addition to TMPRSS2, other trypsin-like proteases of the respiratory tract are able to cleave the hemagglutinin of H3 influenza viruses.",

Sections (0.5 m) were cut from three evenly distributed levels of paraffin blocks and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. For immunohistochemical studies, sections were stained overnight at 4\u00b0C with a primary antibody against influenza A virus nucleoprotein (clone hb65; ATCC, Wessel, Germany). Subsequently, tissue sections were incubated for 30 min with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled goat antimouse IgG2a (Biozol) and counterstained with hematoxylin (22) . Semiquantitative assessment of influenza virus antigen expression in the lungs was performed as reported earlier (23) , with the following minor modifications. For the alveoli, 25 arbitrarily chosen 20\u03eb objective fields of lung parenchyma per lung slide were examined by light microscopy for the presence of influenza virus nucleoprotein, without the knowledge of the identities of the animals. The score for each animal was presented as the percentage of positive fields. For the bronchi and bronchioles, the percentage of positively staining epithelium was estimated for every slide to provide the score per animal, as follows: 0, 0% staining; 1, 1 to 25% staining; 2, 25 to 50% staining; and 3, \u03fe50% staining. For immunofluorescence analyses, 12-m-thick cryo-sections were air dried, fixed in ace-tone at \u03ea20\u00b0C, and rehydrated in PBS. Slides were blocked with anti-FCR (1:500; purified rat anti-mouse CD16/CD32). Primary antibodies used were AF350-conjugated rabbit anti-TMPRSS4 polyclonal antibody (Bioss) and Cy5-conjugated rabbit anti-TMPRSS2 antibody (Antikoerper-Online). Both antibodies were checked on appropriate knockout slides to exclude potential cross-reactivity. After staining, the slides were washed with PBS, dried, and mounted with Neo-Mount (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). Analyses were performed using a Zeiss LSM510 laser scanning microscope with a 40\u03eb oil immersion objective. For in situ hybridization (ISH) studies of type I alveolar epithelial cells (AECI) and type II alveolar epithelial cells (AECII), 5-m-thick formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded lung tissue sections were used with a QuantiGene Vie-wRNA ISH tissue assay kit (Affymetrix, Cleveland, OH) following the manufacturer's instructions. Type 6 (Sftpc; for AECII) and type 1 (Aqp5; for AECI) QuantiGene ViewRNA probes were generated based on Affymetrix probe sets.

Pretreatment was performed for 10 min at 90 to 95\u00b0C, and protease digestion was performed for 20 min at 40\u00b0C. Slides were stained with Fast red for type 1 probes.

As shown in Fig. 1A , round and mostly cuboidal AECII were detected by expression of the cell type-specific marker surfactant-associated protein C (Sftpc; stained blue). Thin and flat AECI could be identified by expression of the cell type-specific marker aquaporin 5 (Aqp5; stained red). In addition, we used immunohistochemical staining to detect expression of both TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS4.

However, both wild-type and knockout mice showed similar degrees of lymphopenia during the first 2 days p.i., followed by an increase of lymphocytes in both knockout and wild-type mice (Fig. 4D) . Similar granulocytosis was observed in both strains on days 2 to 6 p.i. Furthermore, we measured the protein levels of inflammatory chemokines and cytokines in BAL fluid. Three days after infection, increases of the levels of 13 chemokines were observed in C57BL/6 mice compared to mock-infected mice. Most importantly, we observed significantly less expression of IP10, KC, MCP1, MIP1\u2423, RANTES, VEGF, and TNF-\u2423 in knockout mice than in wild-type mice (Fig. 5) . No detectable levels of IL-1\u2423 were observed in knockout samples at this time point. 11-week-old female mice were infected with 2 \u03eb 10 3 FFU of mouse-adapted H3N2 influenza virus by intranasal application, and body weight and survival were monitored until day 14 p.i. In addition to mice that were found dead, mice with a weight loss of \u03fe30% of the starting body weight were euthanized and recorded as dead. (B) Numbers of infectious particles in lung homogenates were determined. Individual values, means and SEM are presented. (C) Relative lung weights were determined by weighing freshly prepared lungs and determining the percent ratio of lung weight to body weight. Individual values, means, and SEM are shown. (D) Hematological parameters were measured with a VetScan HM5 system, and the kinetics of relative numbers of lymphocytes (Lym), monocytes (Mon), and granulocytes (Gr) were determined. Homozygous Tmprss2 \u03ea/\u03ea Tmprss4 \u03ea/\u03ea knockout mice lost significantly less body weight than wild-type mice (e.g., P \u03fd 0.0001 at day 2 and P \u03fd 0.0001 at day 4; Mann-Whitney U test). Tmprss2 \u03ea/\u03ea Tmprss4 \u03ea/\u03ea mice showed significantly reduced mortality compared to that of wild-type mice (P \u03fd 0.0001; log rank test) as well as single-knockout mice. Viral loads were significantly higher in infected wild-type mice than in infected homozygous mutant mice at days 2, 4, and 6 p.i. (P \u03fd 0.01; Mann-Whitney U test). Furthermore, lung weights were significantly higher in infected wild-type mice than in infected Tmprss2 \u03ea/\u03ea Tmprss4 \u03ea/\u03ea knockout mice (P \u03fd 0.01). In the hemograms, lymphocyte numbers decreased until day 2 p.i., and granulocytes increased in wild-type mice on day 2 p.i. and, to a lesser degree, in Tmprss2 \u03ea/\u03ea Tmprss4 \u03ea/\u03ea knockout mice.",

Under these conditions, only completely matured virus particles will enter cells and form foci. We were able to detect a significant smaller amount of matured virus than the total amount of virus in samples from double-knockout mice (Fig. 7) . In contrast, no difference was observed in wild-type samples with and without trypsin treatment.

In particular, host proteases that exhibit trypsin-like activity, such as TMPRSS2, TMPRSS4, TMPRSS11D (HAT), ST14 (matriptase), KLK5, KLK12, TMPRSS11E (DESC1), and TMPRSS13 (MSPL), have been shown to cleave influenza virus HAs with a monobasic cleavage site and to support multicycle virus replication in cell culture (11, 27, (29) (30) (31) . Notably, altered TMPRSS2 expression was identified as a susceptibility marker for severe A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H7N9) influenza virus infections in humans (32) . On the other hand, the trypsin-like proteases prostasin, hepsin, TMPRSS3, TMPRSS6, TMPRSS9, TMPRSS10, TMPRSS11B, and TMPRSS11F did not activate HA upon coexpression in mammalian cells (10, 31, 33) . We showed previously that TMPRSS2 is required for H1 cleavage activation in vivo (13) . Tmprss2 \u03ea/\u03ea mutant mice are completely protected from mortality after infection with several H1N1 and H7N9 viruses (13, 14, 32) . In addition, infection with 10 FFU of A/HK/01/68 (H3N2) virus, which also carries a monobasic cleavage site in HA, resulted in less body weight loss and lower mortality for Tmprss2 \u03ea/\u03ea mice than for wild-type mice. However, this difference was less pronounced after infection with an increased virus dose. Therefore, we investigated whether a further protease may be involved in cleavage activation of H3N2 viruses.",

An increased expression of TMPRSS4 was associated with increased progression and metastatic potential of several cancers (36) . TMPRSS4 transcripts have been detected in the gastrointestinal tract (esophagus, stomach, small intestine, and colon), the urogenital tract (kidney and bladder), mouse bronchiolar-alveolar epithelial cells, and human lung tissue (27, 37, 38) . Nevertheless, the in vivo function of this protein is still unclear. A recent study showed that the regulation of the epithelial sodium channel is not affected by deletion of Tmprss4 (19) . For lung tissue, TMPRSS2 expression has been described for human bronchial epithelium, AECII, and alveolar macrophages (10, 24). We confirmed the expression of Tmprss2 and Tmprss4 in the alveolar region and the bronchial epithelial cells of murine lungs and showed that both proteases were coexpressed in granular and roughly cuboidal cells, representing AECII. In other studies, influenza A virus antigens were detected almost exclusively in AECII and, to a lesser degree, in alveolar macrophages (25, 26) . This colocalization of host proteases and virus strongly suggests that both proteases can be recruited for HA maturation.",

In general, seasonal influenza viruses of the H3 subtype cause more severe symptoms in humans than H1 viruses. One may thus hypothesize that the increased accessibility of the H3 HA to more than two proteases allows for more efficient replication of H3N2 viruses, which may be associated with more severe pathology. The more proteases are able to cleave the hemagglutinin, the faster the virus can replicate and cause illness. It has been shown that increased expression of TMPRSS2 leads to more severe outcomes of human disease caused by the pandemic H1N1 (2009) virus or the novel avian H7N9 virus (32) . Comparison of the amino acid sequences of the H1 (PSIQSR) and H3 (PEKQTR) cleavage sites shows three differences (also see Fig. 9 in reference 13). However, it is likely that specificity and efficiency for protease cleavage are determined not only by the amino acid sequence of the cleavage site but also by the overall tertiary or quaternary structure. The HA cleavage site of the H7N9 virus, which is also cleaved by TMPRSS2 (14, 15) , supports this view, as it consists of the amino acids EIPKGR, which are quite different from both the H1 and H3 cleavage sites. Therefore, it will be important to inves- infectivity in the absence of trypsin. Eight-to 11-week-old female mice were infected with 2 \u03eb 10 3 FFU of mouse-adapted H3N2 influenza virus by intranasal application. On day 2 p.i., the ratio of processed to nonprocessed virus (HA cleavage or not) in lung homogenates was determined using a modified FFU assay without exogenous trypsin. The total number of virus particles (mature or not) was determined in the presence of trypsin. Samples from mutant mice showed significantly lower levels of matured viruses than the total number of virus particles (P \u03fd 0.05). No difference was detectable in samples from infected wild-type mice. Data shown are means \u03ee SEM for 7 replicates from two independent experiments. tigate the structures of both proteases and hemagglutinins to determine the molecular mechanisms of HA cleavage susceptibility and efficiency.",

This is consistent with the observation that both proteases are expressed in the same cell types. Thus, after removal of Tmprss2 alone, Tmprss4 is still able to activate the HAs of H3N2 viruses, and vice versa. Survival rate was increased only after deletion of both proteases due to reduced viral loads in the lungs. Although virus replication was decreased, we still detected processed HA protein, viral spreading, and pathology. From these data, we conclude that in addition to TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS4, further proteases are able to cleave and activate the hemagglutinin of H3N2 viruses. Different proteases have been shown to activate H3 viruses in vitro (11, (29) (30) (31) . TMPRSS11D (HAT) is expressed mainly in the murine trachea and bronchi and is thought to cleave HA mainly in the upper regions of the lower respiratory tract (14, 39, 40) . Furthermore, kallikrein-related peptidase 5 (KLK5) was described to cleave H1 and H3 HAs (30) , tryptase Clara (TPSB2) was reported to cleave H3 HA (5), and matriptase (ST14) cleaves H3 HA to a certain degree (29) . A recent study also reported that the host proteases TMPRSS11E (DESC1) and TMPRSS13 (MSPL) are capable of cleaving H1, H2, and H3 HAs in vitro (31) .",
