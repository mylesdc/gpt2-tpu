Current antiparasitic drugs are teratogenic and cause hypersensitivity-based toxic side effects especially during prolonged treatment. Furthermore, the recent emergence of drug-resistant toxoplasmosis has reduced the therapeutic impact of such drugs. In an effort to develop recombinant antibodies as a therapeutic alternative, a panel of affinity-matured, T. gondii tachyzoite-specific single-chain variable fragment (scFv) antibodies was selected by phage display and bioinformatic analysis. Further affinity optimization was attempted by introducing point mutations at hotspots within light chain complementarity-determining region 2. This strategy yielded four mutated scFv sequences and a parental scFv that were used to produce five mouse-human chimeric IgGs in Nicotiana benthamiana plants, with yields of 33-72 mg/kg of plant tissue. Immunological analysis confirmed the specific binding of these plant-derived antibodies to T. gondii tachyzoites, and in vitro efficacy was demonstrated by their ability to inhibit the invasion of human fibroblasts and impair parasite infectivity. These novel recombinant antibodies could therefore be suitable for the development of plant-derived immunotherapeutic interventions against toxoplasmosis. M. 1995.

Toxoplasmosis infections in immunocompetent individuals are usually self-limiting and are quickly resolved by immune system, thus preventing acute infection. However, T. gondii can cause severe neurological birth defects when transmitted congenitally during a primary infection, with a devastating life-long impact on child health, development, and later productivity (Holliman, 1995) . The parasite is also an opportunistic pathogen affecting immunocompromised individuals such as AIDS patients, by causing the reactivation of latent infection into fulminant disease, usually manifested as toxoplasmic encephalitis and chorioretinitis (Israelski et al., 1993; Luft et al., 1993; Holliman, 1995; Hunter & Sibley, 2012; McLeod et al., 2012) .",

Such drugs are also teratogenic and therefore cannot be used during the first trimester of pregnancy (Goldstein, Montoya & Remington, 2008) . These factors combined with the emergence of drug-resistant T. gondii strains (Sims, 2009 ) have created a pressing need for novel antiparasitic therapies. Passive immunization is a useful alternative strategy particularly for diseases characterized by chronic, life-long infections. Vaccination strategies have enjoyed little success because the parasites can evade the immune system, and the major challenge has been to establish sterile immunity, which is an elusive vaccination endpoint (Lim & Othman, 2014) . Although preventive vaccines are desirable, most lethal cases of toxoplasmosis are reactivated infections in immunocompromised patients with insufficient cellular immunity (Luft & Remington, 1992) . Recombinant antibodies are suitable in this context for passive immunization to inhibit pathogenesis, either as a replacement or adjunct for conventional interventions. Neutralizing antibodies against T. gondii have already demonstrated the feasibility of this strategy (Cha et al., 2001; Fu et al., 2011) .",

Briefly, washed RH parasites were incubated in DMEM with 2% (v/v) FCS supplemented with 35 mg/ml of each antibody or 1.5% volume of a buffer control (PBS) and incubated at 37 C for 30 min while rotating. Invasion was encouraged by incubating on coverslips confluent with a monolayer of HFF cells for 2 h at 37 C in a CO 2 incubator (1 \u00c2 10 7 tachyzoites in 140 ml per coverslip for six-well plates). Infected monolayers were then gently washed twice in PBS and fixed in 2.5% formaldehyde. Extracellular parasites were stained with rabbit anti-T. gondii polyclonal antiserum followed by AlexaFluor 594-donkey-anti-rabbit secondary antibodies. Infected monolayers were first permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS and then blocked with 3% BSA. Parasites were then stained with goat anti-T. gondii polyclonal antiserum followed by AlexaFluor 488-donkey-anti-goat secondary antibodies. All primary and AlexaFluor-conjugated secondary antibodies were obtained commercially (Abcam, Cambridge, UK). Coverslips were mounted with Prolong Gold containing DAPI (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) overnight. The numbers of green (intracellular and extracellular) and red (extracellular) tachyzoites were scored on 30 randomly-selected fields on each of two separately-mounted coverslips with different antibody treatments, and visualized using a 100 \u00c2 lens on an Olympus BX51 microscope. All digital images were acquired and analyzed using the Nikon NIS Elements software. Results are representative of data from at least two independent experiments. Attachment assays proceeded as described for the invasion assay, except that the HFF monolayers on coverslips were pre-fixed with 2.5% paraformaldehyde before parasite incubation. Freshly-released tachyzoites were incubated with the monoclonal antibodies (25 mg/ml IgG in DMEM per 1.0 \u00c2 10 6 tachyzoites) separately for 30 min at 37 C while rotating. Pre-treated tachyzoites were then allowed to attach to fixed monolayers on a six-well plate for 15 min at 37 C. The attached parasites were stained with rabbit anti-T. gondii polyclonal antiserum followed by AlexaFluor 594-donkey-anti-rabbit secondary antibodies. After washing, fixing and mounting, the number of attached parasites was determined in 15 random fields at 40\u00c2 magnification. All assays were carried out in triplicate.",

Although the CDR-L3 region of scFv TG130 had twice as many mutations (four substitutions) as the CDR-H3 region (two substitutions), molecular superimposition revealed that the greatest structural deviation was located within the heavy chain (HC) CDR-H3 loop rather than CDR-L3. The structural alignment showed that the greatest deviation point for the V L chain was the L3 Thr 94 germline residue, which had been mutated to Tyr 94 in scFv TG130, with a root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 2.523 \u00c5.

These IgGs were shown to bind specifically to T. gondii tachyzoites and inhibited the invasion of human fibroblasts, suggesting a great pharmaceutical potential of these plant-derived antibodies against toxoplasmosis. Toxoplasma gondii is an opportunistic pathogen that can cause severe or lethal infections in individuals with reduced cellular immunity, for example, infants, neonates, and immunocompromised adults. The humoral and cellular immune responses must act in concert for effective resistance to toxoplasmosis. Mice deficient in B cells are more susceptible to lethal toxoplasmosis during the chronic infection phase mainly due to unrestricted parasite proliferation in the brain and lungs, causing widespread tissue necrosis (Kang, Remington & Suzuki, 2000) . Although T cells and IFNc are important mediators of host immune responses to T. gondii, specific antibodies produced by B cells are essential for long-term resistance (Kang, Remington & Suzuki, 2000) . Therefore, neutralizing antibodies are an important therapeutic option for the disease, as has recently been demonstrated for West Nile virus infections (Oliphant et al., 2005) and Ebola virus disease (Pettitt et al., 2013) .",

We therefore panned a phage-scFv library against living T. gondii tachyzoites and used stringent selection combined with bioinformatics analysis to isolate a promising parasite-specific scFv. The specific scFv was isolated from a relatively small scFv library (1.6 \u00c2 10 4 independent transformants) which was generated from a single ligation reaction. Generation of a larger scFv library to the magnitude of 10 7 independent transformants could possibly yield more specific scFv antibodies; which would require approximately ten ligation reactions followed by electrotransformation (Barbas et al., 2001) .",

We therefore converted the scFv antibody into a full-length IgG, which was produced by transient expression in N. benthamiana plants. We also attempted in vitro affinity maturation by V L -CDR3 site-directed mutagenesis, but the detailed functional analysis of the mutant variants demonstrated that no significant improvement was achieved over the performance of the parental antibody using this approach. All mutants were able to bind specifically to T. gondii tachyocytes with no cross-reactivity to human cells or murine ascites. Two variants (RT51 and LT3) showed similar efficacy in parasite invasion assays compared to the parental IgG TG130, but the in vitro performance of variant RA15 was poor. The lack of antibody improvement achieved through the affinity maturation strategy could be due to the inherent limitation of low signal-to-noise ratios as equilibrium selection methods require antigen levels in the range of the antibody K D . The use of tachyzoite cells as native antigens was also likely to contribute to the high noise in the selection phase owing to the complex cell surface landscape. Similar work in the future to improve antibody affinity should consider the use of more nonstochastic methodology such as look-through mutagenesis which systematically generates single amino acid substitutions at each CDR positions; and computational design to predict binding affinity by calculation of binding free-energy of antibody models before generating the antibody mutants. These methods, combined with the use of competitive binding strategy in the selection phase could enable the enrichment for clones with slower-disassociation kinetics than the parent antibody and result in improved affinity.",

However, we found that multiple rounds of biopanning on T. gondii cells resulted in the recovery of predominantly truncated proteins instead of full-length scFvs, as previously reported for other antigens (Yan, Ko & Qi, 2004; Liu et al., 2005; Mart\u00ednez-Torrecuadrada et al., 2005) including the selection of Fab antibody fragments against the T. gondii protein SAG1 (Fu et al., 2011) . Whole-cell biopanning can be challenging because heterogeneous and sticky cell surfaces tend to trap nonspecific binders, a problem compounded by the propagation of these nonspecific binders in subsequent amplification rounds (Kramer et al., 2003) . However, this is offset by the advantage of screening native antigen conformations including carbohydrate epitopes in the context of complex cell-surface landscape (Siegel, 2001) . Therefore, we used a single round of selection on tachyzoites resulting in the recovery of functional full-length scFv antibodies, as previously used to isolate functional antibodies against botulinum toxin (Chahboun et al., 2011) .",

We therefore carried out extensive bioinformatics analysis on the putative T. gondii-binding scFv sequences to rule out false positives and immature antibodies similar to germline antibody sequences (Vodnik et al., 2011) . The antibody sequences were screened against the SAROTUP and MimoDB databases to exclude clones with TUP motifs and identical peptides selected on different targets, which would indicate nonspecific binding. We found that scFv TG130 and its affinity-matured counterparts lacked known TUP motifs and contained no identical peptide hits in the MimoDB database, making them the most likely candidates to show specific high-affinity binding to T. gondii and low cross reactivity. The molecular structure of TG130 revealed more changes of amino acid residue in the CDRs than the framework regions (14.3% and 5.1%, respectively). This is in close agreement with observed somatic hypermutation trends during the humoral response, whereby average mutational probabilities for antigen-combining site and core residues are \u223c12% and \u223c4%, respectively (Clark et al., 2006) . Somatic mutations in the variable regions provide increased ligand diversity and are also an established hallmark of in vivo affinity maturation resulting from antigen exposure (Tonegawa, 1983; French, Laskov & Scharff, 1989) . As such, the significant sequence and structural changes found within scFv TG130 indicate an antigen-driven selective process during antibody maturation from its germline precursors.",

For example, several cancer-targeting antibodies have been described with 93-94% identity to germline sequences in the V H region (Hansen, Nielsen & Ditzel, 2002; Ho et al., 2005) , and virus-targeting antibodies have been described with 92.8-99.0% identity (David et al., 1995; Ray et al., 2001) . A similar trend can also be observed for the V L regions in these antibodies. RGYW hotspot motifs are DNA sequences that are frequently mutated during in vivo affinity maturation (Neuberger & Milstein, 1995; D\u00f6rner et al., 1998) . V-Quest analysis of scFv TG130 (Lefranc, 2001 ) revealed a total of five RGYW hotspots within the variable regions, all located within the CDRs (Fig. S9) . Hotspots are found either in the germline sequences or close to non-germline sequences, but we focused on germline sequences because previous studies have shown they are more suitable for affinity maturation in vitro (Ho et al., 2005) . We chose the germline RGYW hotspot sequence within V L CDR1 for a preliminary round of affinity maturation. A pair of degenerate primers spanning the target RGYW sequences was designed to introduce random paired amino acid substitutions but not stop codons, thus avoiding the generation of truncated and non-functional antibodies.",

However, the characterization of the IgGs showed that the affinity-matured IgGs did not confer greater binding affinity for the parasite antigen compared to the parental IgG. To avoid this issue, incorporation of an ELISA test of mutated scFvs to help inform selection of higher affinity antibodies as candidates for IgG conversion should be considered in similar work. We found that immunoblotting data was not completely commensurate with the strong ELISA signals. Of five recombinant IgG antibodies tested, only two (parental TG130 and RT51) showed clearly positive immunoblot signals, revealing that one or two substitutions in the CDR can result in a conspicuous difference in antibody binding characteristics. This is expected as mutagenesis often occurs on hotspot residues, which serve as a ligand binding site. Immunoblot analysis using fractionated, non-reduced parasite lysate showed that all two positive antibodies bound to antigens of \u223c55 and \u223c60 kDa, suggesting that the same epitope was recognized by the parent antibody and derivatives. The reducing and non-reducing immunoblots (Fig. 5) showed different banding patterns, with the non-reduced blots showing fewer bands compared to the reduced blots-indicative of the parasite's multimeric proteins with its disulfide bonds intact. As has also been shown in another study, an immunoblot analysis of T. gondii parasite lysate under reduced conditions would tend to result in multiple non-specific bandings, with a more prominent banding of the protein-of-interest (Besteiro et al., 2009) . Therefore, it was important to run an immunoblot analysis under both reduced and non-reduced conditions to gain better clarity on the specificity of the antibodies.",

Overall, our results showed that paired amino acid substitutions within the V L CDR1 had a significant impact on ELISA and immunoblot performance but these changes were better tolerated in IFA experiments. Sequence bias in the affinity-matured antibody library can have this effect but is unlikely in our case because an evaluation of sequence diversity showed a near-even sequence distribution at the target loci (Table S4 ). However, it is possible that above an affinity threshold, other factors can affect the formation of an antibody-antigen complex, as documented for several cancer-targeting antibodies (Nielsen et al., 2000) . This is supported by the lack of correlation between antibody affinity, specificity, and functionality (Nap et al., 1992) , with instances where lower-affinity antibodies have shown better targeting and retention properties (Nielsen et al., 2000; Rudnick et al., 2011; Yu et al., 2011; Bien-Ly et al., 2014) . These findings confirm that the functionality of antibodies is influenced by many different factors, and we are currently investigating the context of such interactions by identifying the parasitic epitopes involved.",

Murine polyclonal antibodies against T. gondii surface antigens P30 and AMA1 were previously shown to inhibit invasion by 87% and 40%, respectively (Mineo et al., 1993; Hehl et al., 2000) , whereas a murine monoclonal IgG raised against a P. falciparum erythrocyte-invasion antigen achieved a 38% inhibition of invasion (Triglia et al., 2011) . The monoclonal IgGs in this study therefore achieved a potent inhibition of invasion comparable to the levels afforded by polyclonal antisera. More remarkably, our experiments showed that the plant-derived chimeric IgGs also inhibited plaque formation by T. gondii on HFF monolayers by 87% (TG130 and RT51) even at a low antibody dose of 2.5 mg/ml. The individual attachment data sets showed substantial variability between the experiments but all IgG variants except RA15 demonstrated positive blocking activity. We therefore conclude that defective parasite attachment to host cells may not be the main inhibitory mechanism but it plays a substantial contributory role. Based on these encouraging findings, we are currently investigating the in vivo efficacy of our antibodies during toxoplasmosis infections. Taken together, our results demonstrate that plant-derived monoclonal antibodies can substantially inhibit the in vitro activity of T. gondii and, if these results can be confirmed in vivo, the antibodies could be developed into a therapeutic option for immunocompromised patients suffering from toxoplasmosis.",

We chose N. benthamiana as the production platform for our antibodies because the tobacco family is well-established as a host for recombinant protein expression and is recognized by the regulatory bodies governing the production of biopharmaceuticals (Schillberg, Fischer & Emans, 2003; Stoger et al., 2005) . Tobacco plants can produce high antibody yields, including a tumor-specific full-length human IgG at 500 mg/kg fresh biomass (Giritch et al., 2006; Frenzel, Hust & Schirrmann, 2013 ) and up to 600 mg/kg for a scFv (Rosenberg et al., 2013) . Our yields of 33-72 mg/kg fresh biomass are satisfactory for a preliminary proof-of-concept study with no optimization and could be improved by co-expression with protease inhibitors or the viral p19 protein to prevent gene silencing.",

Immunofluorescence assays were used to detect extracellular parasites immobilized on poly-lysine coverslips to confirm the binding of each chimeric antibody (A-J) and buffer control (NC; K and L). Parasites pre-treated with the antibodies or buffer control were fixed in formaldehyde and stained in the absence of permeabilization.
