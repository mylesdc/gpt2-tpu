Laboratory-confirmed, hospitalized AdV pneumonia adults were prospectively enrolled in Beijing Chao-Yang hospital from March to June 2013. Clinical data and serial whole blood and respiratory tract secretions from such patients were collected. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed to quantify the viral load. A total of 14 AdV pneumonia cases were consecutively enrolled, and four of them were fatal. Ten cases were caused by AdV-55, three by AdV-7 and one by AdV-3. There were no differences in age, gender or underlying diseases between the patients in the fatal cases and surviving cases. At admission (on day 5-7 after illness onset), the patients in fatal cases presented higher initial viral loads in respiratory tract secretions (8.578 \u00b1 2.115 vs 6.263 \u00b1 1.225 Log 10 copies/ml, p = 0.023). All patients in fatal cases presented with viremia on day 12-14 (100% vs 66.7%, p = 0.017). A higher initial viral load in the respiratory tract and sustained viremia (more than 2 weeks) may be predictors for fatal clinical outcomes. Fig 4.",

Most severe cases were previously reported to be associated with AdV-3, 4, 7 and 21 [2, 3] . A new strain, AdV-55 (formerly known as AdV-11a), has been a major AdV pneumonia pathogen in immunocompetent adolescents and adults in China since 2008 [4] . Our previous study identified a fatal AdV-55 infection case with a patient who presented with systemic infection and high-level viremia [5] . However, even though AdV-55 as well as AdV-3, 4, 7 and 21 can cause severe cases, those strains are not necessarily associated with bad outcomes, and the pathogenesis of fatality is still unknown. We have already ascertained that AdV can be detected in whole blood specimens of severe cases, but we still lack the knowledge about the viral shedding history and the relationship between the viral clearance in the respiratory tract and viremia duration and clinical outcome. In this study, we focus on the dynamic virological changes in whole blood and respiratory tract secretions to see if lethal cases experienced a high viral load and longer duration of viral shedding compared to the non-lethal cases. We hypothesize that sustained virus shedding in the blood and/or respiratory tract can appear in severe immunocompetent adult cases, and it may be a risk factor for fatal outcome.",
