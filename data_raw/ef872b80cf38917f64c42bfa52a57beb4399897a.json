These vaccines elicited antibodies that neutralized multiple strains of HPAI H5N1 when given in combinations containing up to 10 HAs. The response was dose-dependent, and breadth was determined by the choice of the influenza virus HA in the vaccine. Monovalent and trivalent HA vaccines were tested first in mice and conferred protection against lethal H5N1 A/Vietnam/1203/2004 challenge 68 weeks after vaccination. In chickens, protection was observed against heterologous strains of HPAI H5N1 after vaccination with a trivalent H5 serotype DNA vaccine with doses as low as 5 mg DNA given twice either by intramuscular needle injection or with a needle-free device.",

The greatest threats posed by this virus are its ability to cause mortality in humans, its potential to compromise food supplies, and its possible economic impacts. Viral maintenance in poultry potentiates the risk of human-to-human transmission and the emergence of a pandemic strain through reassortment. An effective, safe poultry vaccine that elicits broadly protective immune responses to evolving flu strains would provide a countermeasure to reduce the likelihood of transmission of this virus from domestic birds to humans and simultaneously would protect commercial poultry operations and subsistence farmers.",

In human trials, these vaccines elicit cellular and humoral immune responses against various infectious agents, including influenza, SARS, SIV and HIV. In addition to their ability to elicit antibody responses, they also stimulate antigenspecific and sustained T cell responses [1] [2] [3] 6, 12, 13] . DNA vaccination has been used experimentally against various infectious agents in a variety of mammals, including cattle (against infectious bovine rhinotracheitis/bovine diarrhea virus, leptospirosis and mycobacteriosis) [14, 15] , pigs (against classical swine fever virus and mycoplasmosis) [16] , and horses (against West Nile virus and rabies) [17] . In addition, DNA vaccines have been tested against avian plasmodium infection in penguins [18] and against influenza and infectious bursal disease in chickens [7, 8, 19] , duck hepatitis B virus in ducks [6] , and avian metapneumovirus and Chlamydia psittaci in turkeys [20, 21] (reviewed in ref. [22] ). While they have been used in chickens to generate antisera to specific influenza viruses and confer protection against the low pathogenicity H5N2 strain [23] , there is only one previous report of a monovalent DNA vaccine effective against H5N1 (and that only against a matched H5N1 isolate) [24] ; no protection with multivalent DNA vaccines against heterologous strains has been reported.",

While there is marked diversity in the host range of type A influenza viruses, many experts have speculated that a pandemic strain of type A influenza could evolve in avian species or avian influenza viruses could contribute virulent genes to a pandemic strain through reassortment [28, 29] . Thus, there is reason to consider vaccination of poultry that would stimulate potent and broad protective immune responses [7, 30, 31] . In undertaking such efforts, it is important that there be a differentiation of infected from vaccinated animals [32] so that animals can be protected and permit monitoring of new infections using proven and sensitive methodologies.",

As expected, there were substantial differences in the breadth of neutralization between these two sets of 5 immunogen multivalent vaccines (Fig. 2 , B vs. C). In one set, while neutralization of homologous strains was comparable to the monovalent and the 10 immunogen multivalent immune response, fewer cross-reactive antibodies were detected, directed most prominently against A/Iraq Protection of DNA-vaccinated mice against challenge with heterologous H5N1 A/Vietnam/1203/2004 influenza virus Mice immunized as described above were challenged with a heterologous H5N1 virus 68 weeks after the final DNA vaccination. Animals were then challenged with 10 LD 50 of the highly pathogenic A/Vietnam/1203/2004 virus intranasally, and morbidity and mortality were monitored for 21 days after the viral challenge. The control animals, injected with the plasmid expression vector with no insert, died within 10 days of infection. Complete survival was observed in the groups immunized with the 10 component and set 2 of the 5 component multivalent DNA vaccines (Fig. 3) . Immunization with HA derived from the A/ Indonesia/05/2005 strain or set 1 of the 5 component multivalent DNA vaccine showed a survival rate approaching 90%. In contrast, animals injected with HA plasmid DNA derived from A/ Anhui/1/2005, which has diverged more from A/Vietnam/ 1203/2004, showed a lower percent survival (70%) after lethal viral challenge. Survival differences between groups were assessed using a log-rank test and the Gehan-Wilcoxon test on the survival curves for pairs of groups. A test was deemed significant if the pvalue was ,0.01. Mice injected IM with different HAs, A/ Indonesia/5/05, A/Anhui/1/05, 10HA, 5 HA (Set 1), or 5 HA (Set 2) showed a significant difference compared to control (all p values,0.001). Among the HA-immunized groups, there was no significant difference between any two groups (p.0.08 for all comparisons). For example, no significant difference was observed between the A/Anhui/1/05 group, which had the least survival among the HA immunized groups (7 out of 10), and other HA groups: A/Indonesia/5/05 (p = 0.377), 10 HA (p = 0.082), 5 HA (Set 1) (p = 0.101), or 5 HA (Set 2) (p = .411).

In addition to needle injection, a needle-free repetitive injection device, Agro-JetH (Medical International Technology, Inc., Denver, CO), was analyzed. This device disperses the 0.1 to 5 ml injection doses into the dermal, subcutaneous, or intramuscular tissue depending upon the pressure adjustments, powered by a CO 2 gas pressure plunger [39] . The injection conditions were determined by histologic analysis of tissues that received injections of India ink; a pressure of 48 psi was chosen since it enabled consistent delivery into intradermal and subcutaneous tissues (Fig. S1 ).",

In these experiments, the HA derived from A/chicken/Nigeria/641/ 2006 was substituted for A/Vietnam/1203/2004 since it represented a more contemporary isolate. The observed rate of protection was higher among the animals receiving 5 mg by Agro-Jet (8/8) than by IM injection (6/8) (Fig. 5, B vs. C). Both modes provided complete protection for all animals at doses higher than this, and 25% protection for the animals receiving 0.5 mg doses (Fig. 5B, C) . Survival differences between consecutive doses were assessed using a log-rank test on the survival curves for pairs of groups. A test was deemed significant if the p-value was ,.01, and marginally significant if the p-value was ,.05 but ..01. Chickens injected IM showed a marginally significant difference between 0.5 and 5 mg (p = .047). In the same group there was a significant difference between control and 5, 50 and 500 mg (p,.001 for all comparisons) and the difference between control and 0.5 mg was marginally significant (p = .016).

There were no differences between control and 0.5 mg or between 5, 50, and 500 mg. Lastly, the survival differences between Agro-JetH and IM for each dose group were not significant. The neutralizing antibody response to homologous and heterologous HAs corresponded with protection and correlated with dose, with higher titers elicited by injection with Agro-JetH compared to needle (Table S2) . We assessed viable viral shedding after inoculation by chick embryo inoculation three days after virus challenge (Week 8). While we noted some embryonic lethality at the 0.5 mg dose, there was no embryonic lethality at 5, 50 or 500 mg groups (data not shown).",

The pandemic potential of this virus, especially as it relates to the poultry industry and for reservoir avian hosts, underscores the need for a vaccine that offers broad spectrum immunity and protection against lethal viral challenge. While the virus remains restricted in its ability to infect humans and undergo efficient human-to-human transmission [28, 47] , its persistence and spread in poultry increases the risk of the emergence of a pandemic strain.

A multivalent H5 vaccine containing diverse serotypes could expand the antigenic breadth sufficiently to provide protection against heterologous challenge and may preclude the emergence of vaccine-resistant strains that may arise due to evolutionary vaccine pressure on the virus. Due to the antigenic drift and shift of the influenza virus genome, it has been very difficult to predict the next dominant strain of an avian endemic outbreak. DNA vaccines can be synthesized in a relatively short period of time, and the targeted mutations can be tailored to specific viral serotypes. The mutations promote a focused and enhanced immune response [3, 49, 50] that may be particularly important in the event of an outbreak where specificity is the key to epidemic control. The use of modified codons ensures maximal expression in the host and eliminates the possibility of recombination with influenza viruses that might potentially generate new strains.",

In addition, based on the chick embryo inoculation data, we believe that there is effective neutralization of the virus and lack of infectious viral shedding in chicken vaccinated with as little as 5 mg of DNA. The device's capacity for rapid repetitive injection and the lower quantity and stability of DNA enhance the practicality and utility of this approach for vaccination of endangered species in captivity or administration to poultry or other animals.",

Three sites (thigh, wing and breast) were used, and biopsies were taken for routine hematoxylin and eosin staining.

The GMT HI in each group two weeks post-challenge were: Control: 80 (n = 1); Trivalent by Agro-Jet (500 mg): 580 (n = 8); Trivalent by Agro-Jet (50 mg): 430 (n = 8); Trivalent by Agro-Jet (5 mg): 183 (n = 8); Trivalent by Agro-Jet (0.5 mg): 200 (n = 2). C. Immunization with trivalent DNA vaccine pCMV/R-HA(A/Anhui/1/2005), pCMV/R-HA(A/Indonesia/05/2005), and HA(A/chicken/Nigeria/641/2006) was performed twice by needle and syringe IM at doses outlined in panel B. The GMT HI in each group two weeks post-challenge were: Control: not done (n = 0); Trivalent by needle (500 mg): 325 (n = 8); Trivalent by needle (50 mg): 120 (n = 8); Trivalent by needle (5 mg): 197 (n = 8); Trivalent by needle (0.5 mg): 200 (n = 2). The chickens in panel B and C each received two immunizations. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0002432.g005",

Group 5 received subcutaneous immunizations via needle and syringe with pCMV/R-HA(A/Indonesia/05/2005); and Group 6 received intramuscular immunizations via needle and syringe with pCMV/R-HA(A/Indonesia/05/2005). Blood samples were collected from the alar veins of the chickens at various intervals. All groups were challenged at week 8 intranasally with 5610 6 EID 50 /ml of A/Vietnam/1203/2004 H5N1 viruses. For the virus load study, cloacal and tracheal swabs were collected from each animal on days 3 and 5 post challenge and titrated for virus infectivity in embryonated eggs. Chickens were monitored each day for signs of disease or death. Surviving chickens underwent necropsy on day 14 post challenge.For dose response experiments, five groups were immunized with the trivalent HA vaccine (pCMV/R-HA(500 mg (167 mg of each of the three plasmids), 50 mg (17 mg of each plasmid), 5 mg (1.7 mg of each plasmid), 0.5 mg (0.17 mg of each plasmid) and a 500 mg control vector administered IM with needle and syringe, and an additional five groups were injected with the same plasmid doses using the Agro-JetH injection device.",

Significant neutralizing antibodies generated to homologous HAs were detected consistently by LAI with few exceptions, while cross reactivity to a standard isolate, A/Vietnam/1203/2004, was variable. For example, IC90 titers exceeding 1:800 were observed against A/chicken/Nigeria/641/2006 and A/Hong Kong/156/ 1997, while a lesser response was detected for the A/chicken/ Korea/ES/2003 strain(Fig. 1). Heterologous neutralization to A/ Vietnam/1203/2004 was variable and did not fully correlate with the degree of relatedness of the specific HA. The ability of these immunogens to generate robust cross-reactive antibodies is consistent with previous observations[4,37,38].",
