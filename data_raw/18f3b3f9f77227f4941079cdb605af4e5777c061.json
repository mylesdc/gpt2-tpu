            "text": "Hantaan virus (HTNV) infections can cause severe hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in humans, which is associated with high fatality rates. Cytotoxic T cell (CTL) responses contribute to virus elimination; however, to date, HLA class I allele-restricted HTNV glycoprotein (GP) epitopes recognized by CTLs have not been reported, limiting our understanding of CTL responses against HTNV infection in humans. In this study, 34 HTNV GP nine-mer epitopes that may bind to HLA-A*0201 molecules were predicted using the BIMAS and SYFPEITHI database. Seven of the epitopes were demonstrated to bind to HLA-A*0201 molecules with high affinity via the T2 cell binding assay and were successfully used to synthesize peptide/HLA-A*0201 tetramers. The results of tetramer staining showed that the frequencies of each epitope-specific CTL were higher in patients with milder HFRS, which indicated that the epitopes may induce protective CTL responses after HTNV infection. IFN-\u03b3-enzymelinked immunospot analysis further confirmed the immunoreactivity of epitopes by eliciting epitope-specific IFN-\u03b3-producing CTL responses. In an HTNV challenge trial, significant inhibition of HTNV replication characterized by lower levels of antigens and RNA loads was observed in major target organs (liver, spleen, and kidneys) of HLA-A2.1/ K b transgenic mice pre-vaccinated with nonapeptides VV9 (aa8-aa16, VMASLVWPV), SL9 (aa996-aa1004, SLTECPTFL) and LL9 (aa358-aa366, LIWTGMIDL). Importantly, LL9 exhibited the best ability to induce protective CTL responses and showed a prominent effect on the kidneys, potentially preventing kidney injury after HTNV infection. Taken together, our results highlight that HTNV GP-derived HLA-A*0201-restricted epitopes could elicit protective CTL responses against the virus, and that epitope LL9 against HTNV, while patients with severe/critical severity tend to have weak T-cell responses (19) (20) (21) . Araki el al. found that HTNV infection was maintained in the presence of high titers of neutralizing antibodies, indicating that antibodies alone cannot eliminate the virus. Notably, NP was undetectable after adoptive transfer of HTNV-specific CD8 + T cells, suggesting that HTNVspecific CD8 + T cells are the major effector cells against the virus and contribute to the clearance of HTNV (22, 23) . Moreover, individuals who had been infected with PUUV or HTNV maintained virus-specific memory CTLs many years after acute infection, revealing the importance of CTLs in preventing a second infection (24) (25) (26) . Therefore, further identification of the CTL epitopes and exploration of the mechanism of CTL responses against HTNV infection are very desirable for the development of an effective vaccine for HFRS.",

Recently, we also reported eight HTNV NP-specific CTL epitopes that were restricted by various HLA alleles including A2, A11, A24, B7, and B35 (6, 20, 30) . It has been demonstrated that GP are the major antigens involved in the induction of neutralizing antibodies and play an important role in eliciting humoral immune responses to protect infected animals and humans against lethal hantavirus infection (17, 31) . However, Kilpatrick et al. discovered that patients with HPS during early SNV infection showed higher frequencies of Gc epitope-specific CD8 + T cells than those of NP epitope-specific CD8 + T cells (32) . Tobias et al. found that ANDV Gn-derived peptides were the immunodominant epitopes eliciting specific CD8 + T responses compared with those from NP and Gc. While NP-specific responses declined, Gn-specific responses remained readily detectable up to 13 years after infection (33) . Hence, we assumed that HTNV GP-derived peptides may function as epitopes to induce effective CTL responses against HTNV infection. Recently, an HTNV Gn-derived H-2K b -restricted CTL epitope (ITSLFSLL) was identified (34) , confirming our hypothesis that there are specific CTLs against HTNV GP-derived epitopes. However, H-2K b -restricted CTL epitopes may not induce parallel responses in humans, screaming HLA class I allele-restricted epitopes could provide additional help for better understanding of the recognition of HTNV by human CTLs. Importantly, Chinese Han populations in different regions have a similar allelic diversity, among which HLA-A*02 is the most common HLA class I allele (35, 36) . Hence, the identification of HLA-A*02-restricted HTNV GP-specific CTL epitopes could be a promising, broadly applicable approach to the prevention of HTNV infection.",

Although T2 cells express a very low level of the HLA-A*0201 molecule under normal culture conditions, they express HLA-A*0201 molecules at much higher levels after binding to appropriate peptides that stabilize the expression of HLA-A*0201 on the cell surface (40) .

Seven nonapeptides were successfully used to synthesize tetramers, whereas the nonapeptide VPV9 could not form a stable peptide/HLA-A*0201 tetramer complex. Thus, we used the seven peptide/HLA-A*0201 tetramers to determine whether the nonapeptides could be recognized by CD8 + T cells and quantify the frequencies of the nonapeptide-specific CD8 + T cells. HLA-A*02 + patients with a different severity of HFRS were tested at the acute phase during hospitalization. HLA-A*02 + subjects who were seronegative for HTNV served as NC. Epitope-specific tetramer + CD8 + T cells could be detected in PBMCs, indicating that seven nonapeptides could be recognized by TCRs of CD8 + T cells (Figure 2A) . Notably, the frequencies of seven HTNV GP nonapeptidespecific CD8 + T cells in the patients with mild/moderate disease were significantly higher than these in the patients with severe/ critical disease and NC (p < 0.05, Figure 2B) , indicating that the seven HTNV GP-derived epitopes might induce protective CTL responses in HLA-A*02 + HFRS patients. In addition, epitopes VV9-, SL9-, LL9-, and VI9-specific CD8 + T cells revealed higher frequencies compared with other epitope-specific CD8 + T cells in patients with mild/moderate disease and showed significantly higher frequencies in patients with severe/critical disease than these in NC (p < 0.05, Figure 2B ), while no significant difference was found between VFV9-, SV-, and FL-specific CD8 + T cells of patients with severe/critical disease and NC. This may due to the better capability of epitope VV9, SL9, LL9, and VI9 to stimulate proliferation of epitope-specific CD8 + T cells.",

Thus, we used single peptide or a peptide mixture (including the seven nonapeptides) to stimulate PBMCs of HLA-A*02 + patients with HFRS, and detected the frequencies of IFN-\u03b3-producing T cells by ELISPOT assay. Notably, the results showed that either the peptide mixture or single peptide could induce IFN-\u03b3 production from the PBMCs of HFRS patients in vitro (Figure 3A) , indicating that each of the seven HTNV GP epitopes could effectively elicit epitope-specific IFN-\u03b3-secreting T-cell responses. Next, we analyzed the positive responses at the single-peptide level. For the limited ELISPOT data of each peptide, we could not perform the statistical analysis between different severity groups. Here, we showed the numbers of epitope-specific CTLs and make a comparison between HFRS patients and NC.

Compared with the negative control Tg mice, immunization with epitope VV9 led to a significant decrease in mean HTNV titers in the supernatants of the livers (p < 0.05, Figure 4B) , immunization with epitope SL9 led to a significant decrease in the liver and spleens (p < 0.01 for liver and p < 0.05 for spleen, Figure 4B ), and immunization with epitope LL9 led to a significant decrease in the liver and kidneys (p < 0.05 for liver and p < 0.01 for kidney, Figure 4B) .

An absorbance value exceeding 0.1-and the 2.1-fold of the negative control (P/N > 2.1) was considered positive and significant, indicating that the HTNV-specific antigen could be detected in the sample.

In this study, we first identified seven HTNV GP-derived HLA-A*0201-restricted CTL epitopes based on their high binding affinity to HLA-A*0201 molecules, ability to bind to TCRs and ability to elicit IFN-\u03b3-producing CTL responses. Importantly, the frequencies of seven epitope-specific CTLs were higher in patients with mild/moderate severity than in those with severe/critical severity. Notably, epitopes VV9, SL9, and LL9 showed higher binding affinity to HLA-A*0201 molecules and frequencies of epitope-specific CTLs in PBMCs of HFRS patients. Further evidence indicated that immunization with epitopes VV9, SL9, and LL9 successfully generated protective CTL responses to inhibit HTNV infection after HTNV challenge in HLA-A2.1/K b Tg mice.

The secondary CTL expansion in vaccinated mice competes for antigen accessibility on antigen-presenting cells, suppressing the priming of other protective pathogen-specific CTLs (45) and potentially explaining how subdominant epitope vaccination could reduce immunodominant epitope-induced CTL responses. Since HFRS vaccines have the potential to elicit both immunodominant and subdominant epitope-specific CTL responses, immunization with the inactivated vaccines may restrict the induction of optimal CTL responses. Notably, peptide vaccines are available for targeted prevention by eliciting epitope-specific CTL responses. The identification of protective immunodominant epitopes from HTNV may be feasible for the design of safer and more effective vaccines against HTNV infection. The Chinese Han population has developed stable gene polymorphisms of the HLA -A, -B and -DRB1 loci over a long evolutionary process in which HLA-A*02 alleles predominate as much as 29.7% (35, 36) .

Interestingly, our results showed that patients with mild/moderate HFRS severity during the acute phase had higher frequencies of HTNV GP epitope-specific CTLs than patients with severe/critical severity, suggesting that these epitope-specific CTLs might play protective roles to reduce the severity of HFRS at early time points by recognizing the epitopes presented on HTNV-infected cells. The tetramer + results of 0.1% or less, which were approximate to the frequencies of NC, were mainly in patients with severe/ critical HFRS, also suggesting that patients with lower frequencies of HTNV GP-specific CTLs during the early time of HTNV infection may develop severer HFRS. These results are consistent with our previous studies showing that increased and vigorous HTNV NP-specific CTL responses correlated with milder HFRS (19, 20) . Other studies also indicated the protective effect of CTL responses. In a hamster model, activation of T-cell immune responses was not responsible for the immunopathogenesis of HPS-like disease, but perhaps the innate immune responses, either elicited from infected endothelial cells, macrophages or neutrophils, contributed to the disease (46) . In a mouse model of persistent infection, almost no IFN-\u03b3-producing T cells were detected, while mice with transient infection showed increased functional HTNV-specific CTLs (23, 47) . HTNV-specific T-cell responses in patients with severe HFRS were heavily impaired at the early stage of infection, indicating that an initial failure to mount strong T-cell responses may be the primary cause of the progression of acute HTNV infection into severe HFRS (27) . In our study, when remove the ELISPOT data of patients with severe/critical disease, the numbers of epitope VV9-specific CD8 + T cells were significantly larger than that in NC, indicating patients with milder disease may have more functional epitopespecific CD8 + T cells. Thus, functional HTNV epitope-specific CTLs at early time points of HTNV infection are important for HTNV clearance and prevention of HFRS development. We demonstrated that the seven HTNV GP nonapeptides were able to induce IFN-\u03b3-producing CTL responses. Considering that patients with milder severity had higher frequencies of epitope-specific CTLs during the acute phase of infection, we speculated that HTNV GP epitope-specific CTLs might have been generated at an early time point after HTNV infection and elicited effective protective IFN-\u03b3-producing CTL responses against HTNV in patients with milder HFRS rather than in those with more severe infection.",

There are some important factors that influence the balance between protective CTL responses that contribute to viral clearance and intense activation of CTLs that may trigger immunologic injury. Different HLA allele restrictions and virus species may be the considerable factors that impact CTL responses and disease outcome, which should be taken into account in studies of CTL responses against virus infection. Notably, in Kilpatrick's study, the total frequencies of three SNV epitope-specific CTLs reached 44.2% in patients with severe HPS, while those in patients with moderate HPS did not exceed 10% (32) . In the present study, the frequencies of each HTNV GP epitope-specific CTL maintained a relatively lower range (0.02-1.17%). Our previous study also showed that HTNV NP epitope FA9-specific CTLs, which also contributed to milder HFRS, maintained a lower frequency (0.01-0.70%). Hence, the frequencies of activated specific CTLs maintained in an optimum range may be an appropriate way to elicit effective responses against virus while avoiding damage to the host.",

Tuuminen et al. also found that PUUV NP epitope-specific CTLs measured by IFN-\u03b3 ELISPOT were lower in acute PUUV infection, indicating that increased epitope-specific CTLs which can be visualized by direct tetramer staining may not readily detectable by an in vitro functional assay such as IFN-\u03b3 ELSIPOT (48) . Both tetramer staining and ELISPOT assay met validation criteria, while the tetramer staining showed better precision (49, 50) . Tetramer staining mimics the molecular interaction between peptide-HLA complexes and TCRs that initiate T-cell activation in vitro. ELISPOT assay relies on a functional readout of cytokine secretion in situ to enumerate responding T cells (51) . The overwhelming amount of antigen and different thresholds of peptide stimulation may drive the T cells into apoptosis by activation-induced cell death and lead clonal exhaustion (52, 53) . Exhausted and terminally differentiated cells could die during lengthy incubation (24-48 h) before producing enough IFN-\u03b3 to be measured by ELISPOT assay. As to tetramer staining, the unresponsive cells could be measured, which may explain why the frequencies of epitope-specific CTLs tested by ELISPOT were lower (54) . CTLs in a dysfunctional state could be restored after incubation with IL-2, suggesting that cytokines produced by Th cells may maintain the function of the CTLs (55), However, antigen-specific CTLs may lack effector activity in vitro for loss of other stimulation in vivo and could not be detected by ELISPOT, which could also contribute to the differences between tetramer staining and ELISPOT assay. Hobeika et al. set the mean + 2 SDs of response of CMV seronegative subjects as cutoff values and found that both tetramer staining and ELISPOT assay had a high sensitivity of 87.5% and specificity of 95-100% (56) . In our study, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to determine the cutoff value for a positive versus negative tetramer score. When set the optimal operating point, which showed the largest positive likelihood ratio, as the cutoff value of each tetramer staining, the sensitivity and specificity ranged from 57.7 to 100% and from 60 to 90% (Table S2 in Supplementary Material). Among them, LL9/HLA-A*0201 tetramer staining had a high sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 90% with the cutoff value 0.09%, which may have the potential to be applied to clinical assistant diagnostic of HTNV infection.",

Humanized mice, which are mice engrafted with human tissue and/or engineered to express human genes, can mimic human immunity against species-restricted pathogens in vivo. The humanized HLA-A2.1/K b Tg mice, which express a chimeric gene consisting of the \u03b11 and \u03b12 domains of HLA-A*0201 molecule and the \u03b13 transmembrane and cytoplasmic domain of H-2K b , can be a powerful tool to establish an HTNV replication model and explore the effect of immune responses primed by HTNV GP-derived HLA-A*0201-restricted epitopes in vivo (6, 57) . Here, vaccination with HLA-A*0201-restricted HTNV GP epitopes VV9, SL9 and LL9 significantly reduced HTNV antigen levels and RNA loads in target organs of HLA-A2.1/K b Tg mice compared with Tg mice injected with PBS or immunized with the control peptide VY9 after HTNV challenge, indicating that three HTNV GP epitopes all could induce protective CTL responses to inhibit HTNV replication and might elicit similar effects in humans. Although the proteomes of pathogens contain abundant peptides that have the potential to act as MHC I-restricted epitopes, CTL responses tend to be focused on some limited dominant epitopes, which are considered to be good candidates for vaccines (58) . LL9-immunized Tg mice had lower HTNV antigens and RNA loads levels compared with LL9-and SL9-immunized Tg mice and even showed equivalent levels in kidneys compared with HTNV vaccine-immunized mice, suggesting that LL9 might function as an immunodominant epitope to induce optimal CTL responses against HTNV infection.",

In our study, the immunodominant epitope LL9 (aa358-aa366) also derives from Gn (aa19-aa648), while the subdominant epitopes VV9 (aa8-aa16) and SL9 (aa996-aa1004) are located in a region of the signal peptide (aa1-aa18) and Gc (aa649-aa1135), respectively. Thus, the immunodominance of Gn is an interesting finding. Hantaviruses contain conserved tyrosine residues near the C-terminus of Gn that form an immunoreceptor tyrosine activation motif (ITAM) (aa611-aa634 for HTNV), which could promote polyubiquitination of the Gn polypeptide to facilitate its degradation via the proteasome (46, 59) . The proteasome generates the epitopes presented on MHC I molecules that elicit CTL responses (60) . After hantavirus infection, increased Gn epitopes produced by enhanced ITAM-regulated degradation are presented on the cell surface with MHC I molecules, and then the epitopes are recognized by specific CTLs and induce high-frequency CTL responses against target cells, which might explain the more effective Gn-related vaccine-induced CTL inhibition of virus replication after virus challenge in vivo.",

Interestingly, the LL9 sequence LIWTGMIDL is relatively conserved in SEOV (LIWRGLIDL) and DOBV (LIWEGYIDL) and is characterized by invariable primary anchor residues and few substitutions of the internal sequence. Although the internal sequence contexts of individual peptides would affect the binding affinity to MHC I molecules (either increase or decrease the binding affinity), substitutions of the secondary anchor amino acids at positions (3, 6, and 7) seems to have a limited effect on the immunogenic properties of peptides (39) . More encouragingly, it has been demonstrated that HLA-A*0201-restricted peptides derived from influenza A virus proteins could elicit broad protection against distinct strains based on the induced-fit molecular mimicry of the TCR effectively targeting mutated peptides (61) .

Higher levels of HTNV-specific CTLs have been associated with lower levels of blood urea nitrogen and creatinine, suggesting that HTNV-specific CTLs may help reduce the risk of progression to acute renal failure caused by HTNV infection and contribute to the reduction of disease severity (71, 72) . Considering the prominent protective effect of epitope LL9 in kidneys of HLA-A2.1/K b Tg mice, which is possibly attributable to the tendentious distributions of epitope-specific CTLs (73) , LL9-based vaccination may induce effective CTL responses for the prevention of kidney damage caused by HTNV infection in humans.",

There are heterogeneous populations of CD8 + T cells after distinct virus-specific peptide stimulation characterized by different multi-cytokine secretion profiles and proliferation abilities (57, 74, 75) . However, due to the limited number of cells, we did not perform more functional assays except the detection of IFN-\u03b3 secretion in vitro to confirm that these epitopes could induce functional CTLs. Since we identified and demonstrated that HTNV Gn-derived HLA-A*0201-restricted nonapeptide LL9 could act as immunodominant epitopes to induce effective immune responses against HTNV, we will further explore the characteristics of CTL responses elicited by epitope LL9 in our future study together with its structural biology by performing, for example, X-ray crystal structure analysis of the peptide LL9/HLA-A*0201 complex.",

Three chosen epitopes all exhibited immunogenicity characterized by significant inhibition of HTNV replication in HLA-A2.1/K b Tg mice that received the peptide vaccination. More importantly, epitope LL9 showed a powerful ability to induce effective CTL responses against HTNV infection in major target organs of HLA-A2.1/ K b Tg mice, especially a prominent protective effect in kidneys, suggesting that LL9 was an immunodominant epitope that could elicit specific CLT responses to eliminate HTNV in vivo. These results provide novel valuable information to better understand CTL responses against HTNV infection, which may support the diagnosis and immune-targeting of HFRS, and promote the development of an effective peptide vaccine to prevent HTNV infection in humans.",

The overlay of the three conditions in histograms clearly show that the curve of T2 cells incubated with each of the eight HTNV GP nonapeptides was shifted more to the right with a higher fluorescence intensity of HLA-A*0201 molecules than those incubated without peptide, indicating that these nonapeptides have a high binding affinity to the HLA-A*0201 molecule.
