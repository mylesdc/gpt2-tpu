            "text": "Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is the leading cause of epidemic encephalitis worldwide. JEV-induced neuroinflammation is characterized by profound neuronal cells damage accompanied by activation of glial cells. Albeit long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been emerged as important regulatory RNAs with profound effects on various biological processes, it is unknown how lncRNAs regulate JEV-induced inflammation. Here, using microarray approach, we identified 618 lncRNAs and 1,007 mRNAs differentially expressed in JEV-infected mice brain. The functional annotation analysis revealed that differentially regulated transcripts were predominantly involved in various signaling pathways related to host immune and inflammatory responses. The lncRNAs with their potential to regulate JEV-induced inflammatory response were identified by constructing the lncRNA-mRNA coexpression network. Furthermore, silencing of the two selected lncRNAs (E52329 and N54010) resulted in reducing the phosphorylation of JNK and MKK4, which are known to be involved during inflammatory response. Collectively, we first demonstrated the transcriptomic landscape of lncRNAs in mice brain infected with JEV and analyzed the coexpression network of differentially regulated lncRNAs and mRNAs during JEV infection. Our results provide a better understanding of the host response to JEV infection and suggest that the identified lncRNAs may be used as potential therapeutic targets for the management of Japanese encephalitis.",

The crucial factor in JEV-induced neuroinflammation is the uncontrolled activation of microglia, which release proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6, monocyte chemotactic protein 1, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1), and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 5 (6, 7) . The higher levels of proinflammatory mediators appear to commence an irreversible inflammatory response leading to neuronal death (4) . Many studies have shown that microglia can be directly infected with JEV, and serves as long-lasting reservoir for JEV (8) . Therefore, the activation of microglia is a key event during JEV-caused neuroinflammation. Previously, we have investigated various molecular mechanisms of JEV pathogenesis (9) (10) (11) (12) ; however, further studies are still required to advance the understanding of JEV-induced neuroinflammation.",

However, the precise molecular mechanisms by which lncRNAs act are largely unknown. Recently, the transcriptomic analysis has revealed that a large number of lncRNAs were differentially expressed upon infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and enterovirus 71 (17, 18) . Furthermore, several lncRNAs have been reported to be involved in virus replication. For instance, an lncRNA, NRAV, can regulate the replication of influenza A virus through inhibition of interferon-stimulating genes such as IFITM3 and MxA (19) . Many lncRNAs have also been shown to modulate inflammatory response (20) (21) (22) (23) . Of these, Lethe, a pseudogene lncRNA, interacts with nuclear factor-kappa B to inhibit the binding of RelA with DNA and to suppress the activation of downstream signaling cascades (23) . These findings suggest that lncRNAs play important roles in virus infection and inflammatory response. Thus, further efforts toward accurate annotation and functional significance of lncRNAs will be critical for our understanding of disease processes.",

Specifically, we used two-side Fisher's exact test and \u03c7 2 test to classify the GO category, and the FDR (30) was calculated to correct the P-value. Smaller the value of the FDR, smaller will be the error in judging the P-value. We computed P-values for the GOs of all differentially regulated genes. Enrichment provides a measure of significance of the function: as the enrichment increases, the corresponding function is more specific, which helps us to find those GOs with more concrete function description in the experiment.",

The findings showed that MKK4/7 is the most enriched pathway. An altered gene status in the coexpression network between JEV-infected and mock-infected groups suggest that the gene may perform a very important function during the JEV infection. Therefore, we compared the status of genes in both groups, and the genes exhibiting the most significant difference are enlisted in Table 2 .",

We also measured whether the lncRNA E52329 and N54010 can modify the NF\u03baB pathway.

            "text": "The struggles between viruses and hosts have been existed for very long times. People usually gave attention to the interaction between protein-coding genes and viruses. Interestingly, only 2% of the mammalian genome is translated into proteins, and the remaining genome contains the non-coding RNA genes (42) . Several transcriptome profiling studies have provided compelling evidence highlighting the importance of non-coding RNAs, such as miRNAs, in modulating the immune response against various viral infections, including JEV infection (43) . However, the roles of lncRNAs in viral infections and associated inflammatory conditions are largely unknown. Long non-coding RNAs have emerged as important regulators of gene expression, with an accumulating body of evidence linking lncRNAs to pathologies, including inflammatory diseases (44) . Albeit, the precise functions of lncRNAs in virusmediated pathogenesis remain poorly understood, evidence from recent studies indicates that lncRNAs may play a key role in virus-mediated inflammatory responses (19, 20) . Herein, a transcriptomic profiling of lncRNAs and protein-coding genes from JEV-infected mice brain was performed using a microarray platform. The results of our study reveal the first experimental evidence demonstrating the complex regulation of lncRNAs by JEV infection in mice brain and microglial cells. The present study is unique from different angles. First, we used mice brain to understand the regulation of host lncRNAs upon JEV infection. This may provide us a way to elucidate the relationship between lncRNAs and protein-coding genes in the brain, having the more complex biological system compare to cell culture system. Second, we validated our findings using microglial cells, which play important role in eliciting innate immune response during JEV infection (4) . However, some of the lncRNAs were not detected in BV2 cells, which may associate with cell type specificity. Third, the integration of microarray platform, quantitative real-time PCR, GO analysis, pathways analysis, and lncRNA-mRNA coexpression network analysis has allowed us to conduct an active comparative genomics and bioinformatics study to reveal host lncRNAs expression patterns associated with JEV infection. We have identified a unique series of host molecular responses involving different combinatorial contributions of multiple cellular lncRNAs. This provides an opportunity to understand the unique cellular lncRNAs-mRNA interactome network, dynamically regulated by JEV infection. Since we confirmed our findings using microglia cell line, further validations using primary microglia remain to be done in future.",

We found that the most significant GOs associated with upregulated transcripts were related to innate immune response, inflammatory response, apoptotic process, acetylation, nucleotide binding, and defense response to virus infections; whereas the GOs terms associated with downregulated transcripts were mainly limited to ions transportation, cell adhesion, signal transduction, and synaptic transmission. Similarly, the most enriched upregulated pathways included Jak-STAT signaling pathway, Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, MAPK signaling pathways, and pathways related to Herpes simplex and influenza A viruses infection. In contrast, the most enriched downregulated pathways were related to calcium signaling, neuroactive ligand-receptor signaling, and retrograde endocannabinoid signaling. To find the potential key lncRNAs involved during JEV infection, we built the lncRNA-mRNA and lncRNA-lncRNAs coexpression networks. To verify the coexpression Network, we performed RNA pull-down experiments and found that three mRNAs Nod1, Tap2, and Col4a1can interact with indicated lncRNAs. Nod1 are known to play a remarkable role in host immune responses which can positively regulate JNK cascade, NF\u03baB activity (49) . This may explain the fact of reduced production of inflammatory cytokines upon silencing of target genes. Our analysis revealed some important genes that may have their roles in regulating JEV-induced neuroinflammation. Considering the networks analyses and previous study, we speculated that the selected genes may trigger the MKK4/JNK and NF\u03baB pathway, and our experimental found the selected lncRNAs may activate MKK4/ JNK pathway but not NF\u03baB pathway. The lncRNA E52329 and N54010 may also regulate other pathways to alter the JEVmediated inflammation. However, we can not exclude all the other possibilities by experiments. We also compared our mRNA transcriptomic profile with a recent study revealing the dynamic changes in miRNAome and transcriptome in JEV-infected microglia (50) . Of the 30 enlisted differentially expressed genes, 10 genes are also found to be differentially expressed in our study. Moreover, nine of 11 pathways predicted in referenced study are also analogous to our prediction analysis, thus, supporting our predictions.",

Using the bioinformatics tools, we found some important lncRNAs that may involve during JEV infection. Furthermore, our experimental data revealed the role of selected lncRNAs in regulating the kinase activity of MKK4 and JNK, which are considered to be involved in inflammatory pathway, and thus, confirmed our predictions. This study may provide insights into the molecular mechanisms involved in JEV pathogenesis. Further studies are still required to understand the biological functions of these identified lncRNAs during JEV infection. As the roles of lncRNAs in viral infections have not yet been fully identified and understood, this study may also provide valuable resource for further studies.",

Mice were randomly assigned to two groups (n = 3 for each group): the JEV-infected group and the control group. For the infection group, mice were inoculated intracranially with 200 PFU JEV (P3 strain) in 20 \u03bcl DMEM, whereas mice belonging to the control group were injected intracranially with equal volume of DMEM. On day 5 postinfection, mice infected with JEV showed signs of acute encephalitis. Mice from both groups were euthanized, and brain samples were collected for further studies. FigUre s4 | Selected lncRNAs regulate JEV-induced production of inflammatory cytokines. (a) RAW cells were transfected with siE52329, siN54010, or their non-specific control siRNA (final concentration, 50 nM) for 24 h, and then expression levels of lncRNA NONMMUT054010 and ENSMUST00000152329 were detected by quantitative real-time PCR. (B,c) RAW cells were transfected with siE52329, siN54010, or their non-specific control siRNA (final concentration, 50 nM) for 24 h, and then infected with JEV at MOI of 5 for 2 h. The mRNA (B) and protein (c) levels of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-1\u03b2 were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR and ELISA, respectively. IFN-\u03b2 mRNA level was determined by quantitative real-time PCR. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01. (D) RAW cells were transfected with siE52329, siN54010, or their non-specific control siRNA (final concentration, 50 nM) for 24 h, and then infected with JEV at MOI of 5 for the indicated times.
