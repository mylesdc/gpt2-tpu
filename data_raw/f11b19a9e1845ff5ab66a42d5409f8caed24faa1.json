Sequence reads were assembled into 62,482 contigs and 111,796 reads remained unassembled (singletons). This combined contig/singleton dataset, designated as the Syrian hamster transcriptome, represents a total of 60,117,204 nucleotides. Our Mesocricetus auratus Syrian hamster transcriptome mapped to 11,648 mouse transcripts representing 9,562 distinct genes, and mapped to a similar number of transcripts and genes in the rat. We identified 214 quasi-complete transcripts based on mouse annotations. Canonical pathways involved in a broad spectrum of fundamental biological processes were significantly represented in the library. The Syrian hamster transcriptome was aligned to the current release of the Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell transcriptome and genome to improve the genomic annotation of this species. Finally, our Syrian hamster transcriptome was aligned against 14 other rodents, primate and laurasiatheria species to gain insights about the genetic relatedness and placement of this species.",

The Syrian hamster is emerging as a promising model for leishmaniasis [10] and dyslipidaemia research [11, 12] . The Syrian hamster is also an important animal model in neurosciences research [13, 14] .

Here we sequenced a normalized 39 mRNA fragment primed cDNA library produced from pooled RNA isolated from the major organs of adult female Syrian hamsters following strategies in common-use described elsewhere [27, 28] . We reasoned that pooling a large variety of different organs of animals will provide a large pool of mRNA fragments to sequence and annotate. Sequencing reads were de novo assembled into contigs. The combined contig and unassembled read (singleton) dataset, designated as the Syrian hamster transcriptome, was annotated based on the mouse and rat transcriptomes. We identified the most highly covered and the most highly expressed transcripts in our Syrian hamster transcriptome and performed a functional enrichment analysis to identify which canonical pathways and biological functions were most significantly represented. In order to contribute to the annotation efforts of the Chinese hamster species, we aligned our Syrian hamster transcriptome to the current version of the CHO cell genome and transcriptome. Finally, we aligned our Syrian hamster transcriptome to 14 other primate species and analyzed the genomic divergence of our transcripts in order to gain insights into the genomic evolution of the Syrian hamster.",

This compendium of transcriptome references included the human (Homo sapiens), chimpanzee (Pan Troglodytes), gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla), macaque (Macaca mulatta), and orangutan (Pongo abelii) sequences, as well as the ferret (Mustela putorius furo), guinea pig sequences (Cavia porcellus), and pig (Sus scrofa). As expected, the greatest number of aligned sequences occurred with the mouse and rat species transcriptomes ( Table 1 ). The human and the non-human primate species also showed high numbers of aligned sequences, possibly due to the current high quality assembly and annotation of those genomes. The CHO, ferret, pig, rabbit (Oryctolagues cuniculus), and squirrel (Ictidomys tridecemlineatus) species showed intermediary numbers of aligned sequences, while the guinea pig, kangaroo rat (Dipodomys ordii), pika (Ochotona princeps), shrew (Sorex araneus) and tree shrew (Tupaia belangeri) had the lowest numbers of aligned sequences. Of 174,278 Syrian hamster transcriptome fragments 50,433 aligned to at least one transcript reference while 61 fragments from our dataset aligned in common across all of these transcriptome references. Importantly, 76,175 of our Syrian hamster transcriptome fragments did not align to any of the 17 transcriptomes tested, nor to the CHO cell genome. It is important to note that some of the variability seen in our transcriptome comparisons may be due to differences in genome quality, assembly and annotation for the reference genomes tested. Figure 4A is a distogram showing the results of our analysis of transcript sequences shared in common. The kangaroo rat, pika, shrew, and tree shrew had the lowest amount of commonly aligned sequences, amongst themselves and with the other species. The mouse and rat species showed the highest number of aligned sequences, presumably because of both their relatedness and genome quality/completeness.",

All the primate species formed a super group, while the ferret and pig transcriptomes clustered together as the rabbit and squirrel transcriptomes.

We identified 214 quasicomplete transcript sequences based on homology with mouse mRNAs and their annotations. In addition, we aligned our Syrian hamster transcriptome to the CHO cell transcriptome in order to further annotate our hamster species, and we observed a transcriptome similarity of 85.14% between the two. When compared to a large compendium of transcriptome references, comprised of rodent, primate, and laurasiatheria species, using 661 Syrian hamster transcriptome fragments that aligned in common, the Syrian hamster transcriptome was found to be evolutionarily closest to the CHO genome and in close proximity to the mouse and rat species. The branch pattern and branch length between the Syrian and Chinese hamster transcriptomes was found to be similar to that observed between the mouse and the rat species.

In addition to the 214 quasi-complete transcripts, identified based on mouse annotations and the most highly expressed transcripts, functional analysis of the entire set of sequence fragments in the Syrian hamster transcriptome that mapped to mouse genes revealed that a number of critical biological pathways are well-represented, including many related to key processes that are potentially perturbed or induced during infection. Among the most significantly enriched canonical pathways were several involved with protein synthesis, turnover, and antigen processing (protein ubiquitination, EIF2 signaling), metabolism and stress responses (mitochondrial dysfunction, NRF2-mediated oxidative stress response, PI3K/Akt, and mTOR signaling), and inflammatory and immune responses (production of NO and reactive oxygen species by macrophages, CXCR4 signaling, IL-1 signaling, and IL-3 signaling). The aim of this study was to collect and annotate a large panel of transcripts regardless of tissue origin. These observations suggest that we have generated a representative transcriptome of the Syrian hamster. Therefore this transcriptome data could be used to generate a biologically meaningful first-generation expression DNA microarray for analysis of Syrian hamster response to disease, including those infectious agents known to alter immune and pro-inflammatory responses. Mechanisms of transcriptome regulation in the Syrian hamster, by way of these important pathways can now be monitored and analyzed further.",

For instance, some classes of non-coding transcripts are now increasingly recognized as major components of regulation, and are widely expressed, but are poorly characterized and annotated.

IPA examines differentially expressed transcripts in the context of known biological functions, mapping each gene identifier to its corresponding molecule in the Ingenuity Pathways Knowledge Base (IPKB).
