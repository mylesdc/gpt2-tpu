Microwave chemistry is widely applied to increase reaction rate as well as product yield and purity. The objectives of the present research were to apply microwave heating to RCA and indicate factors that contribute to the microwave selective heating effect. The microwave reaction temperature was strictly controlled using a microwave applicator optimized for enzymatic-scale reactions. Here, we showed that microwave-assisted RCA reactions catalyzed by either of the four thermostable DNA polymerases were accelerated over 4-folds compared with conventional RCA. Furthermore, the temperatures of the individual buffer components were specifically influenced by microwave heating. We concluded that microwave heating accelerated isothermal RCA of DNA because of the differential heating mechanisms of microwaves on the temperatures of reaction components, although the overall reaction temperatures were the same.",

Moreover, it detects single nucleotide polymorphisms using a circularized DNA probe called a padlock probe as well as efficiently amplifying bacterial genomes by a hyper-branch method [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . Isothermal DNA polymerization has various application possibilities [11] [12] [13] [14] . Microwave heating technology is applied to organic and inorganic chemistry using a microwave generator to produce useful effects such as rapid heating, decreased reaction times, and improved product yield and purity [15] [16] [17] [18] . The microwave effect is debated to be the \"Thermal-effect,\" \"Non-thermal effect,\" and \"Specific microwave effect (superheating or selectivity heating)\" [19, 20] . One of the mechanisms of microwave heating in organic chemistry involves heating a low molecular weight compound with a dipole polarization and an ionic conduction.",

            "text": "Enzymatic reactions (in the fields of proteomics, pretreatment, degradation, chemical synthesis, and optical resolution) are performed using microwave heating [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . Published studies on PCR using microwave heating (microwave-assisted PCR, MW-PCR) show that amplicon synthesis is inefficient, large reaction volumes are required, and temperature is difficult to control or measure [26] . We reasoned that these problems may be attributed to the use of three temperatures (for annealing, elongation, and denaturation) in the MW-PRC method that are not precisely controlled by microwave heating. Temperature measurement under microwave irradiation is a matter of importance [27, 28] . For strict temperature control by microwave irradiation, a gene amplification study using microwave was reported in Milliliter-scale PCR [29] . Microwave device with several frequencies for PCR is developed to accurately control temperature [30, 31] . In contrast, RCA does not require complex temperature control compared with conventional PCR methods, and isothermal conditions are appropriate for controlling microwave heating. In our previous study, we reported the microwave-assisted RCA for the first time using a multi-mode microwave generator [32] , but the reproducibility was difficult. We developed a novel single mode resonant cavity microwave generator with fiber-optic probe to improve accurate temperature measurement and reproducibility. Further, this applicator can be used by a conventional PCR-scale (50-100 \u03bcL). MW-RCA was performed using a circular DNA template and four thermostable DNA polymerases with strand displacement activity. We focused on microwave selectivity heating, which is one of the features of microwave heating. Microwave selectivity heating is thought to alter molecular motion state compared with conventional heating when the reaction temperature is the same. To examine the components of RCA responsible for microwave selectivity heating, we measured the temperature of RCA components under conventional and microwave heating conditions at the same temperature. MW-RCA, which increased the components of selectivity heating, was performed.",

Temperature, power, and frequency profiles of MW-RCA using Bst-LF at 30\u00b0C for 30 min is shown in Fig 3. A power profile of microwave is a value obtained by subtracting reflected power from incident power. Temperature profile data proved that MW-RCA was performed at precise temperatures. Conventional RCA and MW-RCA reactions were sampled at intervals from 10 to 60 min and 10 to 30 min, respectively, and analyzed using agarose gel electrophoresis and fluorescence emission (Fig 4) . The use of the microwave applicator ended in 30 min under high temperature conditions. A comparison of MW-RCA with conventional RCA using the Bst-LF revealed that the reaction product of MW-RCA was increased by a factor of four compared with conventional RCA (Fig 4A) . Fluorescence intensity showed a 4-fold increase than conventional RCA in 30 min. Repetitive DNA sequences repeated four times (300 bp) and eight times (600 bp) were accurately replicated using MW-RCA using Bst-LF under microwave irradiation. The results of each assay showed that the yields of DNA produced by MW-RCA using the Bst DNA polymerase (60\u00b0C) were markedly greater compared with those by conventional RCA during the first 30 min ( Fig  4B) . The fluorescence intensities of the MW-RCA reaction sampled at 20 and 30 min and those of the conventional RCA reaction sampled at 60 min showed that the former plateaued at 20 min ( Fig 4B) . The Bst DNA polymerase was the most effective enzyme for MW-RCA. In the same way, MW-RCA using the Csa DNA polymerase was accelerated at 60\u00b0C compared with conventional RCA, and polymerization was increased at 20 min. In contrast, DNA synthesis was not detectable in the conventional RCA reaction at 30 min ( Fig 4C) . The fluorescence intensity in MW-RCA using Csa was higher by a factor of 30 at 30 min compared with that of the conventional RCA, and it was almost equal to that of conventional RCA at 60 and 90 min ( Fig 4C) . Reactions using the 96-7 DNA polymerase were incubated at 55\u00b0C, its optimum temperature, and showed an increase in discrete bands at 120 min, representing repeated sequences that were detected in the conventional RCA reaction. In contrast, MW-RCA using the 96-7 DNA polymerase showed diffuse migration of high molecular weight DNA molecules at 20 min, although DNA synthesis using conventional RCA was undetectable after 60 min. The fluorescence intensity of the conventional RCA reaction products at 90 min was twice as that of MW-RCA at 30 min (Fig 4D) .

To accomplish our objective, we developed a microwave applicator, which avoided the problem of temperature measurement under microwave irradiation and allowed us to implement new reaction conditions that enhanced conventional RCA. We considered the possibility that microwave-assisted enzymatic reactions are more effective at higher temperatures compared with those at typical physiological conditions. Using four thermostable DNA polymerases with strand displacement activity, we compared the products of MW-RCA and conventional RCA and found that microwave heating accelerated the reactions catalyzed by the four DNA polymerases compared with conventional heating at the same temperature (Fig 4) . In a previous study, DNA amplification of MW-PCR, which was controlled at the precise temperature using the three steps, was reported [29] . In this study, RCA using four thermostable DNA polymerases was accelerated by microwave heating. A RCA reaction is equivalent to an elongation reaction of three steps (annealing, elongation, and denaturation) of PCR. These results of MW-RCA suggest that the reason of acceleration in MW-PCR was DNA polymerization by microwave heating.",

In another report of microwaveassisted enzymatic reactions, the authors hypothesized that microwave effects on enzymatic digestion are due to the increased dipole moments of \u03b1-helices of proteins [33] . A microwave study using immobilized thermostable lipase B suggested that the effect of microwave irradiation of enzymes was due to superheating of the water layer near the enzyme surface [34] . A study using thermostable \u03b2-glucosidase under microwave irradiation at frequencies of 2.45 and 5.8 GHz suggested, with respect to the heating mechanism, that 5.8 GHz irradiation affected only the water molecules in the buffer solution, whereas 2.45 GHz acted on both water molecules and buffering ions [35] .",

The RCA components of the Bst DNA polymerase-LF reaction mixture were used for this purpose, because only the ThermoPol buffer of this polymerase is a nonproprietary reagent. The temperature increases for all RCA components, which were placed in a 60\u00b0C heating block, were the same. Microwave heating to 60\u00b0C increased the temperature of the RCA mixture as well as that of the ThermoPol buffer to 60\u00b0C. In contrast, the temperature of the four RCA components (Bst DNA polymerase-LF, dNTP, template-primer, and water) was 42\u00b0C. These data indicate that the ThermoPol buffer in MW-RCA was selectively heated by microwave irradiation. ThermoPol buffer, which contains a high concentration of ionic molecules, is considered to be heated by conduction loss of microwave irradiation [19, 20] .",

The approach to the microwave heating effect is expected to change the amount of the ThermoPol buffer, which was selectively heated by microwave irradiation. However, a substantial change in concentration of the ThermoPol buffer is impossible because enzymatic reactions have an optimum concentration. We focused on the four components of ThermoPol buffer. We hypothesized that the microwave selective heating could be observed with heating of only one of each buffer component under microwave irradiation. We accordingly prepared four samples of one-fold ThermoPol buffer components [Tris-HCl, KCl, (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 , and MgSO 4 ] and four samples of ThermoPol buffer components in four-fold excess concentrations, and measured their temperatures under microwave heating ( Fig  6) . Temperature measurements of ThermoPol buffer components at four-fold excess concentrations showed an increase in temperature compared with one-fold concentrations. The microwave heating method correlated with the increase in concentrations of buffer components.",

            "text": "In conclusion, we report here the development of a microwave applicator for enzymatic reactions and demonstrate the effect of microwave heating on RCA of DNA. The temperature profiles of RCA components by microwave heating suggest that the ionic components of the ThermoPol buffer are selectively heated and that the rate of temperature increase induced by microwave heating depends on the components of a molecule and the concentrations of buffer components. These findings indicate that (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 and MgSO 4 play important roles in the mechanism of MW-RCA. The shortened reaction time and higher product yields indicate that microwave heating systems can be widely used to enhance enzymatic reactions. Studies are being conducted to further improve the maximum incubation time at temperatures higher than 60\u00b0C as well as to enhance the visualization of the heating process. Preliminary results indicate that MW-RCA can be accelerated at 37\u00b0C. Thermopol-buffer and enzyme component was measured (pH 8.71). The pH of fictitious RCA mixtures of one 4-fold constituent of Thermopol-buffer were measured (4-fold Tris-HCl: 8.73, 4-fold KCl; 8.69, 4-fold (NH4) 2 SO 4 : 8.37, 4-fold MgSO 4 : 8.67). Thus, to assess the effect of pH, RCA using the Thermopol-buffer prepared by us (pH 8.80 and 8.34) was performed and was compared with a control RCA using NEB Thermopol-buffer. As a result, no effect of RCA products by pH alteration of this range was confirmed by electrophoresis and fluorescence analysis. (DOCX)",

In contrast, Mg 2+ is necessary for the function of DNA polymerase. The conventional RCA reaction mixture containing 8 mM of MgSO 4 contained a slightly amplified concentration of DNA. Conventional RCA with 8 mM of MgSO 4 was not at optimum concentration, although MW-RCA reaction in mixtures containing 8 mM of MgSO 4 was accelerated. As shown in Figs 5 and 6, buffer solutions of (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 and MgSO 4 showed large temperature increases per 1 mM under microwave irradiation. These findings suggest a link between the amplification of MW-RCA and the temperature increase of (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 and MgSO 4 under microwave irradiation.",
