            "text": "Attenuated viral vaccines can be generated by targeting essential pathogenicity factors. We report here the rational design of an attenuated recombinant coronavirus vaccine based on a deletion in the coding sequence of the nonstructural protein 1 (nsp1). In cell culture, nsp1 of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), like its SARS-coronavirus homolog, strongly reduced cellular gene expression. The effect of nsp1 on MHV replication in vitro and in vivo was analyzed using a recombinant MHV encoding a deletion in the nsp1-coding sequence. The recombinant MHV nsp1 mutant grew normally in tissue culture, but was severely attenuated in vivo. Replication and spread of the nsp1 mutant virus was restored almost to wild-type levels in type I interferon (IFN) receptor-deficient mice, indicating that nsp1 interferes efficiently with the type I IFN system. Importantly, replication of nsp1 mutant virus in professional antigen-presenting cells such as conventional dendritic cells and macrophages, and induction of type I IFN in plasmacytoid dendritic cells, was not impaired. Furthermore, even low doses of nsp1 mutant MHV elicited potent cytotoxic T cell responses and protected mice against homologous and heterologous virus challenge. Taken together, the presented attenuation strategy provides a paradigm for the development of highly efficient coronavirus vaccines.",

They can cause severe diseases in livestock animals and lead thereby to high economic losses. In humans, coronavirus infections manifest usually as mild respiratory tract disease (common cold) that may cause more severe symptoms in elderly or immunecompromised individuals [2, 3] . In 2002-2003, the appearance of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), caused by a formerly unknown coronavirus (SARS-CoV), exemplified the potential of coronaviruses to seriously affect human health [4] [5] [6] [7] . The frequent detection of SARS-like coronaviruses in horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus sp.) and the broad range of mammalian hosts that are susceptible to SARS-CoV infection may facilitate a potential reintroduction into the human population [8] . Therefore, the development of efficacious coronavirus vaccines is of high medical and veterinary importance.",

Some of these vaccines consist of virus subunits or inactivated virus preparations that mainly induce the production of pathogen-specific antibodies. In contrast, live attenuated vaccines consist of replicationcompetent viruses that induce broad cellular and humoral immune responses without causing disease [10] . The most prominent live attenuated vaccines are vaccinia virus [11] , poliovirus [12] , and yellow fever virus (YF-17D) [13] . Despite their documented efficacy, it is still not fully understood why and how successful vaccines work [10, 14] . However, recent concepts in immunology provide a link between innate and adaptive immune responses and suggest that the quality, quantity, and longevity of adaptive immune responses is determined very early after infection or vaccination [14] . Of major importance are professional antigen-presenting cells (pAPCs) such as dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages, which play a major role in (i) sensing pathogen-associated molecular patterns, (ii) inducing innate immune responses, and (iii) shaping the upcoming adaptive immune response. Efficient live attenuated vaccines should therefore not only lack significant pathogenicity, but should also deliver antigens to pAPCs and activate the innate immune system.",

For a number of reasons, the non-structural protein 1 (nsp1) is of particular interest in this context. First, coronaviruses are positivestranded RNA viruses, and the replicase-encoded nsps are expressed from the viral genomic RNA immediately after virus entry by translation of two large polyproteins. nsp1 is encoded at the 59 end of the replicase gene and is therefore the first mature viral protein expressed in the host cell cytoplasm [21] . Second, a recent in vitro study suggests that SARS-CoV nsp1 may be associated with host cell mRNA degradation and may counteract innate immune responses [18] . Finally, nsp1 is encoded by all mammalian coronaviruses known to date (coronavirus groups 1, 2a, and 2b) [22] , and recent structural data on SARS-CoV (group 2b) nsp1 suggest functional similarities to mouse hepatitis virus (MHV; group 2a) nsp1 [23] .",

Using transient gene expression studies, we found that MHV-A59, SARS-CoV, and HCoV-229E nsp1 significantly reduced luciferase reporter gene expression under the control of IFNb, IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE), and SV40 promoters ( Figure 1 ). This is consistent with a recent report suggesting that SARS-CoV nsp1 induces general host cell mRNA degradation [18] . Nevertheless, it should be noted that the nsp1-mediated reduction in reporter protein expression appeared more robust for ISRE and SV40 than for IFN-b promoter-driven expression. Our data also support the hypothesis that MHV encodes a SARS-CoV nsp1 homolog that displays the same function [23] . Although comparative sequence analyses suggest that nsp1 of group 2a/2b coronaviruses (e.g., MHV and SARS-CoV, respectively) and the nsp1 of group 1 coronaviruses (e.g., HCoV-229E) may belong to different protein families [22, 23] , we also observed reduced reporter gene expression in HCoV-229E nsp1-transfected cells ( Figure 1 ). Whether functional similarities may exist between nsp1 molecules encoded by coronaviruses of different phylogenetic lineages remains to be established in future studies. Importantly, our data also revealed that reporter gene expression from all tested promoters was not affected when C-terminally truncated MHV nsp1 molecules were tested ( Figure 1 ).",

The recent proceedings in the area of virus reverse genetics allows for the rational design of recombinant vaccines by targeting, i.e., inactivating, viral pathogenicity factors. For coronaviruses, a major pathogenicity factor has now been identified. The effect of coronavirus non-structural protein 1 on pathogenicity has been analyzed in a murine model of coronavirus infection. By deleting a part of this protein, a recombinant virus has been generated that is greatly attenuated in vivo, while retaining immunogenicity. In particular, the mutant virus retained the ability to replicate in professional antigen-presenting cells and fulfilled an important requirement of a promising vaccine candidate: the induction of a protective long-lasting, antigen-specific cellular immune response. This study has implications for the rational design of live attenuated coronavirus vaccines aimed at preventing coronavirusinduced diseases of veterinary and medical importance, including the potentially lethal severe acute respiratory syndrome.",

            "text": "MHV-A59 is a hepatotropic and neurotropic virus that can cause acute hepatitis and encephalitis. Following intraperitoneal infection, virus replication is first detectable in spleen and liver, followed by virus spread to other organs, including the central nervous system. Hepatitis is the first clinical sign of disease, accompanied by elevated liver enzyme values in serum. Associated with the appearance of cytotoxic T cell responses approximately at day 5 post infection (p.i.), virus titers usually decline and are no longer detectable after day 7 p.i. Infections with a high dose (! 5 3 10 6 pfu, intraperitoneal) may, however, occasionally result in fatality. To evaluate the importance of nsp1 for virus replication and viral pathogenicity in vivo, C57BL/6 mice were infected intraperitoneally with different doses of wild-type MHV or MHV-nsp1D99. Both viruses replicated in the spleen, whereby MHV-nsp1D99 titers were consistently lower than wild-type virus titers ( Figure 3A ). Furthermore, MHV-nsp1D99 was rapidly cleared and not detectable after day 2 p.i. ( Figure 3A ). Wild-type, but not mutant virus, was detectable in the liver at low and intermediate dose (50 pfu and 5,000 pfu, respectively) ( Figure 3B ). When high virus doses (5 3 10 6 pfu) were applied, MHV-nsp1D99 eventually reached the liver at day 2 p.i., but was not detectable at later time points ( Figure 3B ). MHV-nsp1D99 was not detectable in other non-hematopoietic organs, such as lung and central nervous system (unpublished data). Mice infected with wild-type virus showed acute liver disease with elevated liver enzyme values in serum. Furthermore, after high dose infection with wild-type virus (5 3 10 6 pfu), a significant weight loss that peaked at approximately 10%-15% at day 4 was observed ( Figure 3E ). In contrast, mice infected with the nsp1 mutant virus remained healthy after low, intermediate, or high dose infections. Even at the highest dose applied (5 3 10 6 pfu), MHV-nsp1D99-infected mice did not lose weight ( Figure 3E ), and no elevated liver enzyme values were detected in the serum ( Figure 3C ). This observation correlated well with the absence of hepatocyte necrosis and parenchymal inflammation following MHV-nsp1D99 infection ( Figure 3D ). To further assess the attenuation of the MHV nsp1 mutant, mice were infected intracranially with 200 pfu and 20,000 pfu of MHV-nsp1D99 Figure 3F ). Collectively, these data demonstrate that MHV-nsp1D99 is strongly attenuated in vivo, but has retained the ability to replicate in secondary lymphoid organs, such as the spleen.",

To test whether nsp1 has an influence on the induction of IFN-a, we infected both cDCs and pDCs with MHV-nsp1D99 or wild-type MHV. Both viruses elicited rapid and high IFN-a production in Flt3-L-differentiated bone marrow-derived pDCs ( Figure 4A ) and FACS-sorted primary pDCs ( Figure 4B ). Furthermore, both wild-type and mutant MHV elicited only a late and weak IFN-a production in cDCs ( Figure 4A and 4B). These results suggest that nsp1 does not affect the induction of type I IFN. To assess a potential impact of nsp1 on type I IFN signaling and antiviral effector mechanisms in target cells that efficiently support MHV replication, cDCs and macrophages were pretreated with different dosages of IFN-a and infected with MHV-nsp1D99 or wild-type MHV. In cDCs, IFN-a treatment had a comparable effect on the replication of both MHV-nsp1D99 and the wild-type control virus ( Figure 4C ). However, replication of MHV-nsp1D99 was, in a dose-dependent manner, more vulnerable to IFN-a treatment in macrophages ( Figure 4D ), suggesting that nsp1 might counteract IFN signaling and/or the antiviral activities of IFN-induced effector proteins.",

Infection of IFNAR \u00c0/\u00c0 mice with wild-type MHV led to high titers in all tested organs ( Figure 5A -5D), indicating that signals transmitted via the IFNAR are crucial for preventing uncontrolled spread of the virus [27] . Surprisingly, the severe attenuation of MHV-nsp1D99 in wild-type 129Sv mice was not present in IFNAR \u00c0/\u00c0 mice ( Figure 5A-5D ). Replication of MHV-nsp1D99 in IFNAR \u00c0/\u00c0 mice was largely restored and virus titers reached about 10 4 -10 5 pfu/g tissue in several organs after only 36 h (figures 5A-5D). These data strongly suggest that nsp1 has a pivotal role in counteracting type I IFN host responses and provide an explanation for the rapid clearance of MHV-nsp1D99 in wildtype mice. Interestingly, liver damage, measured as alanine 2oxoglutarate-aminotransferase (ALT) levels in serum, was not yet detectable in MHV-nsp1D99-infected IFNAR \u00c0/\u00c0 mice at 36 h p.i. (Figure 5E ). At 72 h p.i., MHV-nsp1D99 reached titers and ALT levels in IFNAR \u00c0/\u00c0 mice comparable to those observed in MHV-A59-infected IFNAR \u00c0/\u00c0 mice at 36 h p.i., demonstrating that MHV-nsp1D99 replication in IFNAR \u00c0/\u00c0 is, although with slower kinetics, restored.",

MHV-nsp1D99 grows to high titers in cell culture, infects pAPCs, replicates almost exclusively in secondary lymphoid organs, and is strongly attenuated in vivo. To assess the potential of MHV-nsp1D99 as an attenuated live vaccine, we replaced accessory gene 4 of MHV-nsp1D99 and wild-type MHV-A59 by a gene encoding a fusion protein of the immunodominant cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitope (KAVYNFATC) of the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) and the enhanced green fluorescent protein (GP33-GFP) [29] . The resulting recombinant viruses, MHV-nsp1D99-GP33-GFP and MHV-GP33-GFP, were used to infect C57BL/6 mice with different doses (50 and 5,000 pfu, intraperitoneal), and CD8 \u00fe T cell responses were assessed using flow cytometry-based detection of intracellular IFN-c following antigen-specific short-term in vitro restimulation. As shown in Figure 6A and 6B, infection with as few as 50 pfu of MHV-nsp1D99-GP33-GFP elicited strong CD8 \u00fe T cell responses against both the H2-D b -restricted GP33 and the H2-K brestricted MHV S598 epitope.",

Sixteen days p.i., mice were challenged with wild-type MHV (5,000 pfu) and viral titers were determined 5 d post challenge infection. Viral titers were below the limit of detection in MHV-nsp1D99-GP33-GFPand MHV-GP33-GFP-immunized mice ( Figure 6C ). Together with the absence of elevated liver enzyme values in immunized mice ( Figure 6D ), these data indicate that vaccination with the attenuated MHV nsp1 mutant provides complete protection against homologous virus challenge. The reverse genetic system facilitates incorporation of antigens derived from other infectious organisms. In order to determine whether the attenuated nsp1 mutant virus could confer protection against heterologous virus infection, MHV-nsp1D99-GP33-GFP-immunized C57BL/6 mice were challenged after 4 wk with LCMV (200 pfu, intravenous). LCMV titers in spleens were significantly reduced both in mice vaccinated with MHV-GP33-GFP and the attenuated MHV-nsp1D99-GP33-GFP virus ( Figure 6E) . Remarkably, only 50 pfu of nsp1 mutant virus expressing the GP33 epitope were sufficient to achieve a reduction of LCMV titers by more than 4 orders of magnitude, indicating that nsp1 mutant viruses are well-suited to serve as attenuated recombinant virus vectors against heterologous viral infections.",

In accordance with the recent report by Kamitani et al. [18] , we observed reduced reporter gene expression in transient nsp1 expression studies. The suggestion that SARS-CoV nsp1 may play a role in SARS-CoV pathogenesis by promoting host cell mRNA degradation [18] has now received support through the analysis of a coronavirus nsp1 mutant in a murine model. The MHV nsp1 mutant phenotype led us to conclude that nsp1 mainly affects IFN signaling pathways or other downstream events. The influence on IFN-a induction appears to be limited. These conclusions are based on several observations. First, the analysis of IFN-a production by pDCs and cDCs revealed no significant differences between wildtype and nsp1 mutant virus infections. Second, treatment of macrophages with IFN-a revealed a more efficient reduction of MHV-nsp1D99 replication compared with that of wild-type MHV. Finally, and most strikingly, IFNAR \u00c0/\u00c0 mice were highly permissive for the mutant virus, and organ titers almost reached those of wild-type MHV-infected IFNAR \u00c0/\u00c0 mice. Nevertheless, it should be noted that the nsp1 mutant virus replication was still slightly delayed in IFNAR \u00c0/\u00c0 mice. Therefore, further studies are required to define molecular target(s) and the precise function(s) of coronavirus nsp1. Likewise, further studies are required to assess the impact of other coronaviral gene products on coronavirus pathogenicity. Recent reports indicate that coronaviruses most likely express a number of proteins, such as MHV and SARS-CoV nucleocapsid proteins, and SARS-CoV ORF3b and ORF6 proteins, that may interact with innate immune responses [19, 20] . Also, the coronavirus replicase gene may harbor additional functions that play a role in virus-host interactions. It has been shown that the MHV and SARS-CoV nsp2 proteins [30] , and the highly conserved ADP-ribose-199monophosphatase activity [31] encoded in nsp3, are both dispensable for virus replication in tissue culture, and that a single point mutation in the MHV nsp14 confers a strong attenuation of MHV in mice [32] . Clearly, the murine model, with MHV as a natural mouse pathogen, will be highly advantageous in the examination of this issue, because it allows the use of well-characterized inbred and transgenic mice in combination with well-established immunological techniques required to assess the full range of coronavirushost interactions.",

The coronavirus nsp1 has been suggested as a group-specific marker to differentiate group 1 coronaviruses from group 2a/2b coronaviruses [22] . Our transient nsp1 expression data indeed support the notion that SARS-CoV and MHV may encode evolutionarily conserved nsp1 homologs [22, 23] . Nevertheless, further in vivo studies are required to determine whether the group 2b SARS-CoV nsp1 is indeed a functional equivalent to the structurally highly conserved group 2a nsp1 molecules encoded by MHV, bovine coronavirus, porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyocarditis virus, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-HKU1. Likewise, it will be important to clarify in vivo, whether, despite the apparent lack of any sequence homology [22, 23] , the nsp1 of group 1 coronaviruses (e.g., HCoV-229E) may represent a functional correlate to the nsp1 of group 2a/2b coronaviruses.

One important aspect of protection against viral infections is the induction of specific cytotoxic T cells by pAPCs in secondary lymphoid organs [14] . A number of coronaviruses, such as MHV, HCoV-229E, feline infectious peritonitis virus, and SARS-CoV, have been shown to infect pAPCs and to replicate in the secondary lymphoid organs [27, [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] . Because of their pronounced tropism for pAPCs and the induction of strong CTL responses, we propose that coronaviruses represent promising vectors for the expression of heterologous antigens. The identification of nsp1 as a major pathogenicity factor will significantly increase the safety of coronavirus-based vectors [43] . For example, the deletion of accessory genes (i.e., not replicase or structural genes) has been described for some coronaviruses to confer attenuation in the natural host [44] [45] [46] , and the deletion of the structural envelope protein E has resulted in the development of replication-competent, but propagation-deficient, coronavirus vectors [47, 48] . Now, with an accompanying deletion in the nsp1-coding sequence, such vectors would be considered ''recombination proof'', because the deletions are located at opposite genomic regions (i.e., within the replicase gene at the 59 end and within the structural gene region at the 39 end of the coronavirus genome), which make the reconstruction of virulent viruses by recombination unlikely. We therefore suggest that accessory gene, E gene, and partial nsp1 gene deletions will result in particular safe vectors with the potential to express multiple heterologous antigens [40, 49] .",

Briefly, the gene to be mutated was replaced by the Escherichia coli guanine-phosphoribosyltransferase (GPT) gene through vaccinia virus-mediated homologous recombination, and GPT-positive clones were selected by three rounds of plaque purification on CV-1 cells in the presence of xanthine, hypoxanthine, and mycophenolic acid (GPT-positive selection) [50] . In a second round, the GPT gene was replaced by the mutated gene, and GPTnegative clones, containing the mutated gene, were selected by three rounds of plaque purification on D980R cells in the presence of 6thioguanine (GPT-negative seletion) [50] . To construct the recombinant vaccinia virus encoding the MHV-nsp1D99 cDNA, the 59 end of the MHV-A59 cDNA in vMHV-inf-1 was replaced by GPT using the plasmid pRec4. This plasmid is based on pGPT-1 [50] , and the GPT gene is flanked to its left by 500 bp of vaccinia DNA and to its right by an internal ribosomal entry sequence (IRES) followed by MHV-A59 nts 952-1315.
