Of 4,822 acute care hospitals, 148 hospitals met our ECMO criteria and 447 hospitals met our mechanical ventilation criteria. Geographic access varied substantially across states and regions in the United States, depending on center criteria. Without interhospital transfer, an estimated 58.5% of the national adult population had geographic access to hospitals performing ECMO and 79.0% had geographic access to hospitals performing a high annual volume of mechanical ventilation. With interhospital transfer and under ideal circumstances, an estimated 96.4% of the national adult population had geographic access to hospitals performing ECMO and 98.6% had geographic access to hospitals performing a high annual volume of mechanical ventilation.

Severe respiratory illnesses caused by Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus [12] , avian influenza A [13] or other respiratory pathogens may place abrupt demands on regional intensive care resources underscoring the importance of a geographic access evaluation.

In contrast to other time-sensitive medical conditions [14] [15] [16] , severe ARDS can develop over days, often after hospital admission [17, 18] ; therefore, we incorporated interhospital transfers into our geographic access calculations. We included long distance transits in our model as they are considered feasible and safe by ground [19] or air [8, 20] in this patient population.

As many patients with severe ARDS are initially treated at community hospitals [8] , we created a two-level population geographic access model using high capability center locations and referring hospital locations. We defined geographic access as the percentage of the adult population living within a one-hour driving radius of a high capability center, plus the percentage of the adult population living within a one-hour driving radius of hospitals that may refer patients to these centers. We used a onehour driving radius to liberally estimate the hospital catchment population, based on prior studies that show 95% of emergency department patients live within 12 miles of the hospital [23, 24] , but also expecting that patients with more severe symptoms will be willing to drive farther for emergency treatment [25] . For interhospital transport access, we performed separate analyses for both one-hour and two-hour transport intervals. We examined state-level, regional and national geographic access when patient transport between referring hospitals and high capability centers was conducted using ground or rotary air transportation.",

We excluded adult cases reported from children's hospitals, to identify hospitals that provide routine care of adult patients. Second, we used the 2010 Medicare Provider Analysis and Review (MedPAR) file to identify hospitals reporting ECMO in administrative claims. MedPAR includes the final action claims of all hospitalized fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries and is the only national source of hospital claims data.

Practically, access also requires complex coordination efforts across multiple hospitals and explicit regional planning to address other key access domains. These domains include capacity (e.g., the relationship between demand and ICU supply-including ICU beds and ICU personnel), accommodation (e.g., the relationship between the development of acute respiratory failure and the ability of the health care system to move the patient to a high capability center), affordability (e.g., the relationship between the cost of care and the patient's or insurer's ability to pay), and acceptability (e.g., the patient's or hospital's comfort with characteristics of client-provider relationship) [36] .

However, in the absence of a consensus definition, the provision of ECMO or high annual volumes of mechanical ventilation may identify hospitals with these other capabilities. Indeed, it is notable that there are currently no standardized definitions for categorizing critical care resources.
