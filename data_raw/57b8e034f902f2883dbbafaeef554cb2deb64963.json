            "text": "Recently, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have been shown to provide a novel approach to overcome tumors, especially those of hepatocarcinoma. However, the anticancer mechanism of silver nanoparticles is unclear. Thus, the purpose of this study was to estimate the effect of AgNPs on proliferation and activation of ROS-mediated signaling pathway on human hepatocellular carcinoma HePG-2 cells. A simple chemical method for preparing AgNPs with superior anticancer activity has been showed in this study. AgNPs were detected by transmission electronic microscopy (TEM) and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX). The size distribution and zeta potential of silver nanoparticles were detected by Zetasizer Nano. The average size of AgNPs (2 nm) observably increased the cellular uptake by endocytosis. AgNPs markedly inhibited the proliferation of HePG-2 cells through induction of apoptosis with caspase-3 activation and PARP cleavage. AgNPs with dose-dependent manner significantly increased the apoptotic cell population (sub-G1). Furthermore, AgNP-induced apoptosis was found dependent on the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and affecting of MAPKs and AKT signaling and DNA damage-mediated p53 phosphorylation to advance HePG-2 cells apoptosis. Therefore, our results show that the mechanism of ROS-mediated signaling pathways may provide useful information in AgNP-induced HePG-2 cell apoptosis.",

Unfortunately, the diagnosis of HCC is difficult in its earliest stages without screening tests available [4] . Meanwhile, owing to its poor sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents, high metastatic potential, and resistance to traditional drugs, it is dismal to the overall prognosis of patients with HCC. Thus, it is imperative to develop efficient chemotherapy that has become the great challenge in clinical treatment [5, 6] . In addition, most of current anticancer agents usually have short half-life in the blood circulation and poor aqueous solubility, which hampers therapeutic efficacy of chemotherapy [7, 8] . Recently, nanomaterials have been widely used in biomedical field due to its unique physicochemical properties, including their size distribution, stability of dispersion, morphology, crystalline structure, and thermal properties, that might have the potential to overcome these problems [9] . The increased of application of nanomaterials resulted in raising hopes for employing nanoparticles as alternative anticancer agents [10, 11] .",

The studies on the underlying molecular mechanisms revealed that the major mode of cell death induced by AgNPs was cell apoptosis. The mechanisms indicated that AgNPs promote caspase-3-mediated apoptosis by the involvement of ROS generation. Further investigations on apoptotic signaling pathway triggered by the AgNPs in HePG-2 cells are p53, AKT, and MAPKs pathways.
