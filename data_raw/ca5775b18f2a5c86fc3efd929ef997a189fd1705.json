This work explores how protein states can be manipulated through controllability analysis: the determination of the minimum manipulation needed to drive the cell system to any desired state. Here, we complete a two-part controllability analysis of two protein networks: a host network representing the healthy cell state and an influenza A virus-host network representing the infected cell state. In this context, controllability analyses aim to identify key regulating host factors of the infected cell's progression. This knowledge can be utilized in further biological analysis to understand disease dynamics and isolate proteins for study as drug target candidates.",

Virus interacting and driver host proteins are significant both topologically and in controllability, therefore playing important roles in cell behavior during infection. Functional analysis finds overlap of results with previous siRNA studies of host factors involved in influenza replication, NF-kB pathway and infection relevance, and roles as interferon regulating genes. 24 proteins are identified as holding regulatory roles specific to the infected cell by measures of topology, controllability, and functional role. These proteins are recommended for further study as potential antiviral drug targets. Conclusions: Seasonal outbreaks of influenza A virus are a major cause of illness and death around the world each year with a constant threat of pandemic infection. This research aims to increase the efficiency of antiviral drug target discovery using existing protein-protein interaction data and network analysis methods. These results are beneficial to future studies of influenza virus, both experimental and computational, and provide evidence that the combination of topology and controllability analyses may be valuable for future efforts in drug target discovery.",

Traditional systems biology approaches to understanding cell dynamics during infection include the creation of detailed kinetic models for intercellular signaling pathways. While these models are advantageous in understanding the disease state in a quantitative way, they require experimentally-derived or estimated parameters and training data [2] [3] [4] , without which complications can arise and an accurate model can quickly become unattainable. Further, modeling studies are often limited to specific pathways which fails to consider the total cellular environment as an interdependent system.",

This strategy provides a holistic understanding of system behavior by viewing proteins as interdependent states, regardless of specific interaction mechanisms, and allows for the exploration of cell level relationships. The field of network theory is well established. Several basic network metrics like degree (the number of interactions a protein is involved in) and betweenness (the importance of a protein to information flow through a network, or, how much of a bottleneck a protein is to system behavior) [6] are commonly used to describe the significance of network components in a wide range of applications [7] [8] [9] . These analyses have repeatedly revealed the importance of specific proteins within biological processes that cannot be found from traditional modeling approaches [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . Disease networks have identified genes involved with cancer [15] [16] [17] [18] , demonstrated that the genes responsible for similar diseases are likely to interact with each other [19, 20] , and predicted novel drug targets [21, 22] .",

Past work studying the effects of influenza virus in PPI networks has focused on identifying host factors involved in virus replication and improving the prediction of drug targets but ends with an analysis of basic topological measurements. While this provides a general overview of the state of the network, it is a static snapshot of the cell and, therefore, fails to capture the dynamic nature of the cell. Therefore, the next logical step in analyzing biological networks lies in understanding how these dynamic systems can be manipulated and exploited to manage biological properties.",

Therefore, the system is fully controllable and it is possible to drive the protein concentrations to any desired state. Applying the idea of controllability to a cell at the onset of viral infection, a virus aims to control cellular functions (the system of proteins), promote virus replication tasks, and reach a final infected cell state. While it would be advantageous to interpret the infection from this control perspective, mathematical limits due to large system dimensions prevent the direct application of traditional controllability methods to PPI networks.",

Controllability classification is founded in \"driver node\" calculations: identifying the network components which must be manipulated for the system to be fully controlled (analogous to determining the non-zero elements of the B matrix in classic controllability). Without manipulation, driver nodes will remain unaffected by changes to the rest of the system, rendering the total system uncontrollable. Driver nodes are identified using the Hopcroft-Karp algorithm [36] which can be applied to any directed graph in bipartite form. This method calculates the maximum matching of the graph, or, the largest set of network paths where no node is shared by two edges. Because each node can only influence one of its interactors, the identification of these paths dictates the way in which control can propagate through the network. The nodes that are not included in these paths or at the start of these paths are not receiving control from a neighboring node and, therefore, require \"driving\". A set of driver nodes (size N D ) that is capable of controlling the total network is called a minimum input set (MIS). The MIS is not unique and the number of possible MISs scales exponentially with the size of the network [37] . After a primary MIS is calculated, two methods of controllability node classification can be used.",

The node is then classified by its effect on the manipulation required to control the network, where an increase in the size of the MIS makes it more difficult to control the network and a decrease in the size of the MIS makes it easier to control the network. The removal of: an indispensable node increases the number of driver nodes (N D \u2032 > N D ), a dispensable node decreases the number of driver nodes (N D \u2032 < N D ), and a neutral node has no effect on the number of driver nodes (N D \u2032 = N D ). This method has previously been applied to many network types such as gene regulatory networks, food webs, citation networks, and PPI networks to better understand what drives the dynamics of each system [29, 38] . While it is useful to observe the structural changes to the network after the removal of singular nodes, this method only considers one possible MIS. A second global controllability method by Jia et al. [39] (Pictured in Fig.  1c ) classifies a node by its role across all possible MISs. A critical node is included in all possible MISs, an intermittent node is included in some possible MISs, and a redundant node is not included in any possible MISs.

Unlike in robust controllability, there is a small disturbance to global type distributions of host proteins after the addition of virus interactions. 24 host proteins shift from being classified as critical (a member of all MISs) to intermittent (a member of some MISs) proteins. Identities of these proteins (deemed \"global proteins\") can be found in Table 4 along with the shortest distance to an IAV protein in the network and protein degree and betweenness. The two most notable changes in degree and betweenness between the HIN and VIN are EPH receptor A2 (EPHA2) with an increase of 1 and 93, respectively, and transferrin receptor (TFRC), with an increase of 3 and 164, respectively. All 24 global proteins are driver and IAV interacting proteins which, as mentioned, only comprises 3.5% of the total network. There are only two proteins (EPHA2 and HNRNPA0) that are also members of the robust protein set. 45% of IAV interacting proteins are never drivers, suggesting that they are always manipulated by neighboring host proteins within any possible control configuration. IAV interacting proteins are not enriched for driver proteins (Fisher test p: 0.14). Again, a randomized protein set was created to test if IAV may be selectively interacting with host proteins based on their controllability characteristics. 10,000 random sets of 752 proteins (the number of IAV interacting proteins) were sampled from the host proteins of the VIN. Their global type distributions were plotted against the classification results of IAV interacting proteins, driver proteins, and all proteins in the VIN (Fig. 3d-f ) . As with the robust classification, the random sets closely resemble the total network (one-sided p = 0.50, 0.51, and 0.50 for critical, intermittent, and redundant, respectively). While there are no redundant driver proteins by definition, driver proteins are more likely to be intermittent proteins than critical proteins (Fig. 3d-e) , where more than 75% of all driver proteins are missing from at least one possible MIS. This means the majority of possible driver proteins are able to be controlled by a neighboring protein in at least one MIS. IAV interacting proteins tend to be redundant compared to the total number of proteins that are redundant (Fig. 3f ) . This suggests that viruses prefer to interact with proteins that are part of existing control structures to receive input from neighboring proteins.",

Proteins identified in the robust analysis show little deviation in both degree (Fig. 5a) and betweenness (Fig. 5b) measures after the addition of virus-host interactions to the network. In contrast, proteins identified in the global analysis show much larger deviations in degree (Fig. 5a) and betweenness ( Fig. 5b) with all proteins having a betweenness of 0 in the HIN with an up to two log unit increase in the VIN (Table 4 ).

Further, a comparison of driver protein betweenness for those that are also IAV interacting proteins in comparison to those that are not shows a significant difference. Driver proteins that are IAV interacting are not receiving control influence from viral proteins (dictated by the maximum matching requirement that each protein only control a single protein) and require additional external influence to achieve network control. However, the increased betweenness of proteins that are both driver and IAV interacting proteins suggests that this group is still of great importance to information flow through the network.

The increased population of indispensable IAV interacting proteins (robust controllability: N D \u2032 > N D , Fig. 3a ) compared to what would be expected by random chance suggests that it would be more difficult for an outside influence (such as viral infection) to control the network after removing the IAV interacting proteins opposed to a randomly selected protein. This is logical as IAV interacting proteins act as the connection between viral proteins and the host network where control is initiated. The increased population of redundant IAV interacting proteins (global controllability: never a driver protein, Fig. 3f ) when compared to the random expectation indicates that more IAV interacting proteins are always being manipulated internally than would be expected by chance. This means that they are fully incorporated into the control structure of the VIN. From these two results, one can conclude that IAV interacting proteins contribute to both the \"gate\" (the ease of entering the system) and the \"heart\" (the proteins responsible for propagating control through the system) of the network control structure during infection. These findings support the idea that viruses are likely to interact with a b Fig. 6 Percent of each a) robust classification type and b) global classification type confirmed in 6 siRNA screens (Brass, Karlas, Shapira, Hao, Konig, Watanabe).

In their absence, the number of driver proteins would decrease and it would theoretically be easier for a viral attack to compromise the network control structure. As such, a possible strategy for drug development could be to protect these proteins from repression effects during infection. Over 75% of driver proteins are classified as intermittent (global controllability: sometimes a driver protein, Table 3 ), meaning there is at least one MIS where these driver proteins are not drivers, and receive control influence through internal propagation.

All global proteins are IAV interacting and driver proteins, a high distinction which demonstrates a significant importance to network information flow marked by significantly higher betweenness in the VIN than even driver proteins that are not IAV interacting. Additionally, all global proteins have no importance to network flow in the HIN (betweenness = 0) ( Table 4) , suggesting their role in network structure \"turns on\" after the onset of infection. It is noteworthy that PRDX1 has been implicated in respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [58] , a lower respiratory tract infection that is often associated with influenza virus [59] . Though the number of global proteins identified in existing siRNA screening data is not statistically significant, it should be noted that siRNA screens cover only the partial genome. As such, this type of analysis could be used to direct future experimental studies to save time, money, and effort. IPA analysis reveals that some of the identified proteins hold roles in mRNA processing, an integral part of the influenza virus' ability to spread through processing its own RNA using host machinery [60] . The global protein network is centered around NF-kB, which is implicated in host immunity with evidence that the virus directly inhibits NF-kB activity [61, 62] . The interferon regulating roles of proteins in a high number of both identified sets (all 11 changing MIS proteins and 20 of 24 global-identified proteins) speak to their responsibility in controlling infection. PPA1 appears as downregulated in 63 studies and HNRNPA0 appears as downregulated in 20 studies when treated with interferon compared to a control, solidifying their involvement in the host immune response. In total, this evidence suggests that controllability analyses hold power as predictors for important regulators of the host response to influenza infection and, therefore, hold power for drug target prediction.",

The limits of these methods lie in limited availability of large-scale, dependable databases of protein-protein interactions. Foundational maximum matching algorithms for the calculation of driver proteins must be performed with directed networks. While larger directed networks than the network from Vinayagam et al. [40] are available [70] , the network used here contains only experimentally derived data opposed to computationally predicted interactions, assuring biological confidence in the results within this study. A robust controllability analysis of the computationally predicted network presented in Uhart et al. [70] finds that 29% of proteins are categorized as indispensable where approximately 20% of proteins in the Vinayagam network are classified as the same, though there is 89% overlap in directed edges between the two networks. This suggests that methods for predicting protein interactions may over represent these key proteins within the analysis, even in combination with experimental results. However, larger networks will move towards a more complete analysis of infected cell behavior and possibly reveal further proteins of interest. Therefore, the future of this field depends on continued establishment of large, confident, directed PPI networks.",

While robust controllability methods have previously been applied to study PPI networks [29] , past analysis focuses only on the classification of virus interacting proteins and does not evaluate before and after the addition of virus-host interactions to the network. A global controllability analysis has never been applied to PPI networks. The unique construction of the VIN includes experimentallyderived virus-host interaction data [41] which represents opportunities for the virus to manipulate host intracellular machinery using protein-protein interactions. Here, analysis of the transition between the healthy and infected network states and further investigation of virus interacting and driver proteins has identified 24 proteins as regulatory markers of the infected state. This protein set is noted for its characteristics in topology, controllability, and functional roles within the infected cell: results that are summarized in Table 5 . Our workflow observes both the effect of structural changes to the network in the case of potential protein knock outs, as well as each protein's role in all MISs, representing all possible ways of controlling the system. In combination, network approach and results provide deeper understanding of how changes to cell behavior at the onset of infection are able to occur through the work of a small set of viral proteins. Through understanding the system in this way, we present the possibility to \"outsmart\" viral attack by dismantling the control structure which allows the viral infection to take hold.",
