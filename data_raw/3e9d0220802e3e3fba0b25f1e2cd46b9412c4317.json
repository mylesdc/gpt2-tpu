However, cisplatin resistance is still a challenging issue, and the molecular mechanisms underlying this resistance remain to be fully explored. CLEC4M, a Ca 2+ -dependent C-type lectin, has recently been found to correlate with tumourigenesis. This study mainly focused on whether CLEC4M impacts clinical prognosis and how CLEC4M contributes to cisplatin resistance in NSCLC. Our results found that CLEC4M was correlated with poor prognosis in patients with lung cancer. In addition, a positive association between CLEC4M expression and the IC50 values of cisplatin was found, which suggests that CLEC4M may impact cisplatin sensitivity. In vitro results from cultured A549 and H1299 cells confirmed that CLEC4M could enhance cisplatin resistance, while CLEC4M knockdown led to higher sensitivity to cisplatin in these cells. Further experiments showed that the underlying mechanisms included inhibition of cisplatin-induced cell apoptosis by CLEC4M and improved DNA repair capacity by upregulating XPA and ERCC1 expression. In addition, CLEC4M was able to promote cell migration with or without cisplatin treatment. Collectively, these findings suggest the potential clinical significance of CLEC4M inhibition in overcoming cisplatin resistance in NSCLC patients.",

Approximately 85% of lung cancer cases are diagnosed as non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) [1] .Platinum-based chemotherapy is the foundation of treatment for most NSCLC patients, including patients with advanced disease, or patients presenting relapse after curative intent surgery [2, 3] . The most commonly used chemotherapy agent is cis-diamine-dichloroplatinum (II), also known as cisplatin, which is used as the backbone of first-line chemotherapy for NSCLC [4] . However, the development of cisplatin resistance remains one of the most challenging problems in the clinical management of patients with NSCLC; cisplatin resistance is a major cause of treatment failure [5] . Accumulating evidence reveals that there are multiple factors involved in cisplatin resistance, including enhanced DNA repair, evasion of apoptosis, drug transport deficiency and reduced drug accumulation [6] [7] [8] . Although great advances have Ivyspring International Publisher been achieved in this field, the underlying mechanism of cisplatin resistance remains to be fully explored.",

            "text": "Recently, the role of lectins in tumourigenesis has attracted much attention. Selectins (E-, P-and L-selectin) promote lung metastasis by facilitating the formation of the metastatic microenvironment [9] . Liver sinusoidal endothelial cell lectin (LSECtin), an adhesion molecule, is an important player in colorectal carcinoma liver metastasis [10] . CLEC4M, also known as DC-SIGNR, L-SIGN or CD209L, is a Ca 2+ -dependent C-type lectin. CLEC4M and its homologue DC-SIGN are encoded by the closely related lectin gene cluster on chromosome 19p13.3 [11, 12] . Both CLEC4M and DC-SIGN are type-II transmembrane proteins that share very similar genetic structures and protein functional domains. The structure of CLEC4M and DC-SIGN consists of an intra-cellular N-terminal domain, a tandem-repeat neck domain and a C-type lectin carbohydrate recognition domain [11, 12] . Of note, CLEC4M and DC-SIGNR are expressed in different tissues; CLEC4M is expressed in the endothelial cells of lung, liver and lymph nodes, while DC-SIGN is expressed in the dendritic cells (DCs) [11] . Both CLEC4M and DC-SIGN have long been considered to perform the same function of recognizing a range of pathogens and mediating the endocytosis of ligands [11, 12] , but emerging evidence has demonstrated some differences between their roles in immunity and tumour progression.",

The level of serum CLEC4M was higher in patients with colon cancer than in healthy controls [13] . Subsequent studies confirmed that CLEC4M could promote colon cancer liver metastasis [14] . Studies in gastric cancer mirrored this finding; the serum CLEC4M level is increased in patients with gastric cancer, especially in patients with liver metastasis, and CLEC4M levels strongly correlate with advanced pathological stage [15] . These findings indicate a novel role for DC-SIGNR in tumour metastasis. In the case of lung cancer, similar results were observed; patients with metastasis had a higher level of serum CLEC4M, while patients without metastasis showed lower serum expression of CLEC4M, compared with healthy controls [16] . Based on these observations, one intriguing issue is whether and how CLEC4M contributes to the aetiology of lung cancer and impacts cisplatin sensitivity. This study mainly focused on the association of CLEC4M with clinical prognosis and the particular role of CLEC4M in cisplatin resistance in lung cancer patients.",

This study mainly investigated the biological effect of CLEC4M on cisplatin resistance. Our results showed that CLEC4M was associated with poor patient OS and FP. The positive association between CLEC4M expression and the IC50 values of cisplatin suggests that CLEC4M may impact cisplatin sensitivity. In vitro results from A549 and H1299 cells confirmed that CLEC4M could enhance cisplatin resistance, while CLEC4M knockdown could significantly increase cisplatin sensitivity. Further experiments showed that inhibition of cisplatin-induced cell apoptosis by CLEC4M and improvement in DNA repair capacity by upregulating XPA and ERCC1 expression were among the underlying mechanisms. In addition, we found that CLEC4M could promote cell migrationwith or without cisplatin treatment.",

CLEC4M was previously identified as a receptor to bind and internalize potential ligands, especially viruses [11] . Recently, the clinical significance of CLEC4M in cancers has been investigated. The high level of CLEC4M in serum may be a potential molecular marker for the diagnosis of early stage colon cancer [13] . The biological effects of CLEC4M in lung cancer remain unclear. In the current study, prognostic analysis of 119 LUSC patients and 1926 NSCLC patients demonstrated that patients with higher expression of CLEC4M showed poorer OS as well as shorter FP. These results indicate that CLEC4M could lead to worse clinical outcomes in lung cancer patients. Cisplatin resistance is a major reason for the negative prognosis of NSCLC patients. Our study verified the initial speculation that CLEC4M promotes cisplatin resistance; A549 and H1299 cell lines with forced CLEC4M expression had greater IC50 values of cisplatin. These findings indicate that the poor clinical outcome of patients with higher CLEC4M expression may result from enhanced cisplatin resistance.",

Consistently, CLEC4M overexpression inhibited cisplatin-induced apoptosis. These results indicate that CLEC4M suppresses cisplatin-induced apoptosis and thereby leads to cisplatin resistance in NSCLC cells. Apoptotic signals are regulated at several levels. Caspases are essential regulators in the process of apoptosis [22, 23] . Of these regulators, caspase-3 is recognized as a key player in controlling cellular apoptosis. Upon receiving signals from the upstream activators (caspase-2, -8, -9 and -10), the inactive precursor of caspase-3 is converted into an active form that is responsible for the majority of cellular destruction [24] . Our results showed that CLEC4M suppressed the upregulation of cleaved caspase-3 that was induced by cisplatin in NSCLC cells; when CLEC4M expression is suppressed, the cisplatin-induced upregulation of cleaved caspase-3 was further increased, suggesting that CLEC4M inhibits cisplatin-induced apoptosis in NSCLC cells, which might be the molecular underpinnings of the role of CLEC4M in cisplatin resistance.",

            "text": "The DNA repair capacity (DRC) of tumour cells has a substantial impact on cisplatin sensitivity and/or resistance [25, 26] . Nucleotide excision repair (NER) is considered an important way to sense and respond to cisplatin-induced DNA damage [27] . Four steps are followed to remove DNA lesions by NER: recognition, DNA unwinding, incision by endonucleases, and DNA resynthesize [6, 28] . In the early stage, clinical studies revealed that elevated DRC could enhance cisplatin resistance in NSCLC cell lines [29] . A subsequent study also demonstrated that DRC was an independent predictor of clinical outcomes for NSCLC patients treated with cisplatinbased chemotherapies [30] . The components of NER are a series of protein that display distinct functions in DNA repair. ERCC1 is implicated in DNA incision and has received much attention regarding its role in platinum resistance [28, 31] . XPA protein binds to the damaged site of DNA and provides docking sites for excision. XPA expression is upregulated in cultured NSCLC cell lines resistant to cisplatin resistance [32] . Our results showed that CLEC4M knockdown inhibited ERCC1 and XPA expression in both A549 and H1299 cells. Conversely, CLEC4M overexpression upregulated ERCC1 and XPA expression in H1299 cells. While the mRNA levels of EXCC1 and XPA were also increased in A549 cells, increases at the protein level were not obvious. However, the reason for the different observations between A549 and H1299 cells is not clear. To some extent, current results suggest that DC-SIGNR may enhance DNA repair by increasing EXCC1 and XPA expression. However, we did not detect the direct DNA repair capacity of CLEC4M, and the molecular action also needs to be elucidated.",
