Indeed, the use of synthetic antibodies derived from oligoclonal IgA gene sequences has identified intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies with viruslike particles in intact tissue sections from children with KD, specifically in the ciliated epithelium of medium-sized bronchi [13] . These studies suggested, therefore, a putative viral aetiologic agent as a cause of systemic vasculitis in KD patients. Moreover, pathologic studies identified three distinct, but linked basic KD vascular processes: necrotizing arteritis, subacute chronic vasculitis and luminal myofibroblastic proliferation [15] . Necrotizing arteritis is an acute synchronized neutrophilic process of medium-sized arteries that could be responsible for the saccular aneurysms that can lead to the formation of thrombi or ruptures within the first month. It starts at the endothelium of medium-sized muscular and elastic arteries and progresses peripherally. Luminal myofibroblastic proliferation occurs in close association with subacute chronic vasculitis. It is a unique process that involves medial (smooth muscle cell-derived) myofibroblasts and their matrix products, which form a concentric mass that can progressively obstruct the arterial lumen. Both subacute chronic vasculitis and luminal myofibroblastic proliferation can persist for months to years following the onset of KD. Furthermore, giant aneurysms are most likely to develop stenosis resulting from repetitive layering of thrombi, which eventually become occlusive, whereas dilated coronary arteries that preserve some portion of the media most likely undergo luminal myofibroblastic proliferation with or without thrombosis [15] .",

This crosstalk between activated platelets and leucocytes operates through several systems, including the interaction of P-selectin with P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1). Pselectin and PSGL-1 are vascular adhesion molecules that play an important role in the inflammatory response by mediating the interaction of leucocytes with stimulated endothelium and platelets bound in the vicinity of vascular injury. P-selectin captures leucocytes from the blood to bring them into contact with the endothelial cell surface on the blood vessel wall, where P-selectin-PSGL-1 interaction supports leucocyte rolling [18] . On the other hand, neutrophils can interact with adherent platelets and leucocytes in a process called secondary capture, which is often followed by neutrophil-endothelial interactions. During inflammation neutrophils recruited by platelets contribute, through Toll-like receptor 4, to neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) formation that function as a barometer for systemic infection [19] . Importantly, while platelets stimulate NET formation, NETs cause platelet activation and aggregation, thus linking inflammation and thrombosis [20] .

In particular, genes related to innate and acquired immune functions or to vascular remodelling have been studied [24] . Although incidence of KD varies in different ethnic population, genetic polymorphisms of 1,4,5-trisphosphate 3-kinase C (ITPKC) and caspase 3 (CASP3) have been shown to associate with coronary artery lesions formation in both Japanese and Taiwanese populations of patients with KD [25] . ITPKC gene is located on chromosome 19q23 and acts as a negative regulator of T-cell activation. CASP3 gene, located on chromosome 4q35, is profoundly related to the apoptosis of immune cells. Both ITPKC and CASP3 are involved in Ca 2+ /nuclear factor of activated T-cells pathways, indicating the potential role of this signalling pathway in immune system [25] . Furthermore, in 2011, Shimizu et al. suggested that genetic variations in the transforming growth factor-b (TGF-b) signalling pathway influenced the susceptibility to the manifestation of KD, to the disease outcome as well as to the response to therapy [26] . In the immune system, TGF-b modulates the balance of proinflammatory/anti-inflammatory T cells, through a complex set of interactions. Genetic variations in the TGF-b pathway may lead to an imbalance of pro-inflammatory and regulatory T cells (T reg ) by affecting the expression of the forkhead/winged helix transcription factor P3 (FOXP3) that is involved in the differentiation, function and survival of CD4 + CD25 + regulatory T cells.",

It is located on chromosome 8p22-23 and its expression pattern during the acute and convalescent stages of KD correlates with the percentage of B cells in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells.

A large number of T cells, mononuclear cells, macrophages and plasma cells, with a smaller number of neutrophils, are observed in various organ tissues of fatal cases of acute KD [34] . An imbalance of Th1 and Th2 subsets during the acute stage of KD has been suggested by Matsubara et al. [35] . In particular, a decrease in the numbers of Th1, producing interferon (IFN)-c, but not of Th2, producing IL-4, has been observed. As a general rule, Th1 cells play an important role in cellular immunity by secreting IL-2 and IFN-c, whereas Th2 cells have the helper function for the development of antibody-producing B cells by secreting various cytokines such as IL-4, IL-5, IL-6 and IL-10. Some of these cytokines play an important role in the progression from systemic activation of the immune system to local inflammation in coronary vessels. Recently, it has been demonstrated that KD patients may be non-responsive to IVIG when, after IVIG treatment, the serum levels of IL-6 and IL-10 decrease slowly and the levels of IL-4 and TNF-a increase [36] . Very important are also the data obtained from the study of Th17 and T reg cells. These cells have been described as two subsets distinct from Th1 and Th2 cells. While Th1 and Th2 cells have long been known to regulate cellular and humoural immunity, Th17 cells have been identified only recently as a Th lineage that regulates inflammation via production of distinct cytokines, such as interleukin IL-17. Conversely, T reg cells expressing FOXP3 have an anti-inflammatory role and maintain tolerance to self-components by contact-dependent suppression or releasing anti-inflammatory cytokines, e.g. IL-10 and TGF-b1 [37] . An imbalance between Th17 and T regs cells has been described in the peripheral blood from patients with KD [38] . Interestingly, Ikeda and collaborators [39] reported that, in the acute phase, peripheral blood mononuclear cells from KD patients show a unique activation state with a high expression of genes for damage-associated molecular pattern molecules (S100A9 and S100A12) and a low expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine genes.",

The importance of NT-proBNP has recently been reassessed, as the levels of this pro-hormone are raised in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with LV dysfunction [23] , allowing the specificity of this biomarker for KD patients to be investigated in more detail. Finally, genetic polymorphisms have also been considered as potential biomarkers for KD, with particular regards to six HLA class I genes, two MHC class I chain-related gene A (MICA) alleles and ITPKC gene [48] .",

In fact, oxidative/nitrative stress has been measured in KD inflamed blood vessels, as revealed by the high levels of reactive oxidizing species (i.e. superoxide anion and nitric oxide), protein 3nitrotyrosine and MPO levels in the blood [51] . Protein 3-nitrotyrosine is the covalent post-translational modification identifying the formation of nitric oxide-derived nitrating agents used as a specific biomarker of oxidant burden in many pathological conditions from acute to chronic diseases. Increased levels of MPO, the pro-inflammatory enzyme released from activated leucocytes, could support the proinflammatory status forming highly oxidizing species and protein oxidation products, such as 3-nitrotyrosine, promoting lipid peroxidation and inducing an autoimmune response mediated by MPO autoantibodies [52] . Moreover, MPO could promote a pro-coagulant state of the blood, although it is binding at the platelet and neutrophil surface, then favouring the appearance of platelet-neutrophil aggregates detected in KD [21] . In this regard, 3-nitrotyrosine and MPO could play a pathogenetic role in the cardiovascular complications of KD and could be considered as biomarkers of inflammation in this disease. Furthermore, it has been suggested that this pro-oxidant blood status could alter also red blood cell (RBC) homeostasis, resulting in a sort of premature ageing in these circulating cells that could lead to anaemia and formation of blood clots [51] . In particular, decreased glycophorin A and CD47 expression as well as the externalization of phosphatidylserine (PS) were measured in RBCs from KD patients [51] . Glycophorin A, a glycoprotein widely expressed at the RBC surface, is down-regulated during cell senescence; CD47, an integrinassociated protein known as the thrombospondin receptor, acts as a marker of self; PS, a phospholipid normally localized to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane, is externalized to the outer leaflet during cell remodelling, leading to RBC ageing and cell death. The appearance of these ageing and death biomarkers on RBCs from KD patients was related with clinical evaluations. Indeed, during the first 5 days of hospitalization, the number of RBCs and the values of haemoglobin, the mean corpuscular volume and the haematocrit were significantly decreased in KD patients [51] . This could be of relevance as RBCs can act as physiological scavengers of ROS in circulating blood and can be considered as 'biosensors' for monitoring oxidative imbalance in inflammatory diseases [53] . Importantly, alterations in RBC structure and function may independently and synergistically impair blood flow and induce vascular occlusion, whereas premature ageing of RBCs, and their consequent removal from circulation, might be a risk factor for anaemia. Both vascular occlusion and anaemia are pathological conditions found in KD patients [54] .",

This can exert a pathogenetic role in the cardiovascular complications that characterize KD. Recently, it has been suggested that thrombocytosis in KD could depend on platelet stimulation and defective apoptosis, probably bolstered by nitrosative stress [55] . This hypothesis is supported by the detection of circulating platelets-neutrophils aggregates in KD patients [21] and by the increase in markers of platelet activation, such as the shedding of Pselectin and the externalization of PS. P-selectin is a cell-adhesion molecule constitutively expressed in the a-granules of resting platelets that translocates at the surface during platelet activation. Its release as a shedding phenomenon modulates leucocyte adhesion to both platelets and endothelial cells during inflammatory responses and thrombus formation [56] . The externalization of PS in platelets, i.e. its presence on outer leaflet of the plasma membrane, is usually associated with a sort of programmed cell death [57] , but it has also been correlated with their hyperactivation [58] . Importantly, specific studies on platelet activation identified two different platelet subpopulations in the peripheral blood of na \u20ac \u0131ve patients with KD: (i) platelets with PS externalization (annexin V positive platelets), characterized by the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (considered as procoagulant), and (ii) platelets without PS externalization (annexin V negative platelets), characterized by mitochondrial membrane hyperpolarization. This latter subpopulation become pro-coagulant when stimulated by mediators normally released from activated platelets, e.g. adenosine diphosphate [59] . These two subpopulations may considerably affect the coagulation cascade and inflammatory response in KD patients.",
