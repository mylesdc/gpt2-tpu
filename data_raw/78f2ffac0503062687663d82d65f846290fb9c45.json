            "text": "Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) transmission from dromedaries to humans has resulted in major outbreaks in the Middle East. Although some other livestock animal species have been shown to be susceptible to MERS-CoV, it is not fully understood why the spread of the virus in these animal species has not been observed in the field. In this study, we used rabbits to further characterize the transmission potential of MERS-CoV. In line with the presence of MERS-CoV receptor in the rabbit nasal epithelium, high levels of viral RNA were shed from the nose following virus inoculation. However, unlike MERS-CoV-infected dromedaries, these rabbits did not develop clinical manifestations including nasal discharge and did shed only limited amounts of infectious virus from the nose. Consistently, no transmission by contact or airborne routes was observed in rabbits. Our data indicate that despite relatively high viral RNA levels produced, low levels of infectious virus are excreted in the upper respiratory tract of rabbits as compared to dromedary camels, thus resulting in a lack of viral transmission.",

            "text": "Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a novel pathogen that is known to infect dromedary camels and humans [1, 2] . Seroepidemiological studies indicate that this virus has been circulating in dromedary camels in the Arabian Peninsula and Africa for decades [3] [4] [5] . MERS-CoV sequences obtained from these camels are largely similar to those obtained from human MERS cases in corresponding regions, thus providing evidence that dromedary camels act as the zoonotic source of this virus [6, 7] . However, many primary human MERS cases do not have a history of direct contact with these animals [8] . This suggests the presence of unidentified routes of human-to-human transmission or the involvement of other animal species in spreading the virus to humans. Besides dromedary camels, other animal species, i.e. llamas, alpacas, and pigs have been shown to be susceptible and develop upper respiratory tract infection upon experimental intranasal MERS-CoV inoculation [9] [10] [11] . This is in line with the expression of the MERS-CoV receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4), in their nasal epithelium [9] . MERS-CoV-seropositive llamas and alpacas have been reported in the field, and MERS-CoV-experimentally-inoculated alpacas have also been shown to transmit the virus via contact [12] [13] [14] .",

These cages are separated by two stainless steel grids 10 cm apart to prevent direct contact but still allow airflow from the donor rabbit to the airborne recipient rabbit. These transmission cages allow the experiment to be conducted in negatively pressured isolators in the BSL3 facility, with HEPA-filtered airflow <0.1 m/s [18] . Since these cages were too small for New Zealand rabbits, we chose a smaller-sized breed, the Netherland dwarf rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus), for the MERS-CoV transmission experiment. We used both male and female rabbits with an age Viruses 2019, 11, 381 3 of 13 range of 6 months-3 years in these experiments.

We previously reported that they develop both upper and lower respiratory tract infection upon MERS-CoV inoculation [15] , suggesting the expression of the viral receptor at these locations. Using immunohistochemistry, we analyzed the DPP4 expression in rabbit respiratory tract tissues. In the upper respiratory tract, DPP4 is strongly expressed at the apical surface of both nasal respiratory and olfactory epithelium ( Figure 1 ). In the lower respiratory tract, DPP4 is present in both bronchiolar and alveolar epithelial cells, although some variation in DPP4 expression was observed throughout the lungs. DPP4 is either absent, limitedly expressed on alveolar type II cells, or expressed on both alveolar type I and II cells ( Figure 1 ). Thus, these data highlight a broad DPP4 expression in the respiratory tract Different human MERS-CoV strains have been isolated since the EMC/2012 strain was first characterized [22, 23] . However, studies that evaluate phenotypic differences between these strains in animals are currently lacking. We investigated whether a more recent MERS-CoV strain (Qatar15/2015) replicates differently in rabbits in comparison to the EMC strain. We found that rabbits inoculated with the MERS-CoV EMC strain and those with the Qatar15 strain developed an equally mild infection and shed similar levels of viral RNA in their nasal and throat swabs ( Figure  3 ).

In contrast, intranasal inoculation is less invasive and had been used in other studies to infect rabbits with MERS-CoV [20, 21] . Here we investigated whether intranasal MERS-CoV inoculation is sufficient to induce both upper and lower respiratory tract infection in rabbits, in comparison to combined intranasal and intratracheal inoculation. Three New Zealand rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) were inoculated with MERS-CoV EMC strain either intranasally with 200 \u00b5L of 1 \u00d7 10 6 TCID 50 /mL (group a); intranasally with 1 mL of 1 \u00d7 10 6 TCID 50 /mL (group b); intranasally with 200 \u00b5L of 1 \u00d7 10 6 TCID 50 /mL and intratracheally with 3 mL of 4 \u00d7 10 6 TCID 50 /mL (group c); or intranasally with 1ml of PBS as a negative control (group d). All three groups of MERS-CoV inoculated rabbits developed minimal clinical manifestations and histopathological lesions. The amount of viral RNA shed in the nasal and throat swabs did not vary among the inoculated groups (Figure 2A,B) . However, in the lungs of the rabbits, the amount of viral RNA was significantly lower in group a than in groups b and c ( Figure 2C ). In line with these observations, fewer MERS-CoV-infected cells were observed in the lungs of group a animals compared to groups b and c ( Figure 2D ). Based on these results, we decided to use intranasal inoculation with 1 mL of 1 \u00d7 10 6 TCID 50 /mL MERS-CoV for our subsequent experiments. pictures were taken at a 400\u00d7 magnification, and alveolar epithelium at 1000\u00d7.

In contrast, none of the swabs from recipient rabbits was positive for virus titration (Figure 5C,D) . Serological analysis of samples collected 14 days after exposure showed that only the donor rabbits seroconverted and developed neutralizing antibodies ( Figure 6A,B) . The antibody response of these directly inoculated rabbits was relatively low, confirming the results of previous studies [15, 21] . This indicates that these rabbits developed MERS-CoV infection while the contact and airborne-exposed rabbits did not, supporting the results of the virus titration. To study MERS-CoV transmission, four Netherland dwarf rabbits were intranasally inoculated with MERS-CoV.

The amount of viral RNA shed by the inoculated rabbits remained high until day 7 post inoculation. On the other hand, recipient rabbits housed in the same cage (direct contact recipients), or adjacent cage (airborne recipients), shed limited amounts of viral RNA (~10 TCID 50 GE/mL) in both nasal and throat swabs. Among four animals in each group, only two direct contact recipient and two airborne recipient rabbits had detectable viral RNA up to day 5 post inoculation in the nasal swabs, while in the throat swabs, viral RNA was only detected in one direct contact recipient and one airborne recipient rabbit at day 1 post inoculation ( Figure 5A,B) . Infectious virus was detected at low level (~10 2 TCID 50 /mL) both in the nasal and throat swabs of the donor rabbits; in the nasal swabs of all donor rabbits at day 1 post inoculation, and in one of the donors up to day 7.

This suggests that this virus is easily transmitted between dromedary camels. From an epidemiological point of view, it is important to know whether other animal species in the region may also spread the virus to humans or other animal species. In vitro, MERS-CoV has been found to infect cells from a broad range of animal species including Old and New World camelids as well as primates, bats, cows, sheep, goats, pigs, horses, and rabbits [15, 25, 26] . The DPP4 viral receptor of these species, especially rabbits, has high similarity to that of humans and dromedary camels, especially in the region that interacts with the spike protein, and thus can facilitate MERS-CoV infection [25] [26] [27] . The New World camelids, i.e. llamas and alpacas, have been shown to seroconvert to MERS-CoV when present in regions where MERS-CoV is circulating and may transmit the virus [12] [13] [14] . It is currently unclear why, besides camelids, other livestock animals do not seem to transmit the virus to humans [24, [28] [29] [30] . To further understand the transmission potential of MERS-CoV, we performed virus transmission experiments using rabbits as animal model.",

            "text": "To perform the virus transmission experiments, we housed MERS-CoV-inoculated rabbits together with na\u00efve contact rabbits either in the same or adjacent cages. Rabbits developed both upper and lower respiratory tract infection upon MERS-CoV inoculation [15] , either via intranasal or combined intranasal and intratracheal routes, in line with the localization of DPP4 in their respiratory tract epithelium. The amount of viral RNA being shed by the inoculated rabbits during the first three days post inoculation is almost as high as that of the MERS-CoV-inoculated dromedary camels [31, 32] . However, none of the direct contact and airborne-exposed rabbits developed any clinical signs, shed significant levels of viral RNA, shed infectious virus, nor did they seroconvert. One possible reason for this lack of transmission is the limited amount of infectious virus being shed by the inoculated rabbits [21] . Previous studies have shown that in the nasal and lung tissues of experimentally infected rabbits, infectious virus was generally detected in a limited amount despite the abundant presence of viral RNA and virus nucleoprotein [15, 21] . Alternatively, low levels of infectious virus transmitted to recipient animals may be unable to initiate a productive infection due to the presence of host proteins that restrict replication. Comparable to rabbits, MERS-CoV-infected pigs and goats develop minimal clinical signs, hardly shed infectious virus, and barely spread the virus to na\u00efve animals [28, 33] . In contrast, MERS-CoV-infected dromedary camels develop nasal discharge and shed a high amount infectious virus (10 4 -10 5 TCID 50 /mL), almost equal to the amount of viral RNA being shed (10 5 -10 6 GE/mL), during the first 4 days post inoculation [31, 32] . These interspecies differences may indicate presence of nasal discharge and infectious virus shedding as critical factors in MERS-CoV transmission. In humans, levels of infectious virus shed by MERS-CoV patients have rarely been reported. However, MERS-CoV patients that transmit the virus have been shown to shed a higher amount of viral RNA in their swabs compared to those that do not, supporting the quantity of virus shed as an important factor in the transmission of MERS-CoV between humans [34] . For influenza A viruses, infectious virus shedding has been documented as one of the main determinants of airborne virus transmission. Using ferrets as an animal model, it has been reported that a reduction in infectious virus shedding in the nasal swabs can subsequently limit virus transmission [35] [36] [37] .",

            "text": "Our results show that despite the presence of DPP4 in the upper respiratory tract, accompanied by MERS-CoV replication at this site, a limited amount of infectious virus was shed. Similarly, titration of rabbit lung homogenates that show high levels of viral RNA and presence of nucleoprotein ( Figure 2C ,D) resulted in only low levels of infectious virus, in line with earlier observations [15, 21] . At this stage, it is not clear which host mediated mechanisms limit the production of infectious virus while allowing viral RNA to still be shed at high levels. Since restriction of infectious virus shedding in the rabbits already occurred one day post inoculation, activation of host innate immune responses, including type I interferon induction, may be relevant. In vitro studies have shown that MERS-CoV is relatively sensitive to type I interferon-mediated antiviral activities [38, 39] . In human plasmacytoid dendritic cells, MERS-CoV inoculation leads to secretion of large amount of type I and III interferons and production of viral RNA, but hardly any infectious virus is being produced [40] . It is also possible that most infectious virus shed by these rabbits is defective, lacking the capacity to efficiently infect target cells. Further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms that restrict MERS-CoV replication in rabbits compared to dromedary camels. Potentially, some of the MERS-CoV accessory proteins shown to antagonize immune responses including production of interferon, may not work efficiently in some MERS-CoV susceptible species, including rabbits. It is intriguing to investigate whether a similar phenomenon occurs in some human MERS-CoV infections and whether this is linked to the development of asymptomatic to mild clinical manifestations [41] . This might partly explain why MERS-CoV transmission in humans is rather inefficient in comparison to dromedary camels [42, 43] , and why camelids that secrete high levels of infectious virus are the only known zoonotic source of MERS-CoV [2, 7, 14, 31] . Deciphering these mechanisms could potentially offer insight into understanding MERS-CoV transmission as well as developing novel treatments to tackle the ongoing outbreaks. ",
