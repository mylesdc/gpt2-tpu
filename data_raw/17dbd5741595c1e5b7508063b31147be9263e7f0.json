            "text": "Coronaviruses raise serious concerns as emerging zoonotic viruses without specific antiviral drugs available. Here we screened a collection of 16671 diverse compounds for anti-human coronavirus 229E activity and identified an inhibitor, designated K22, that specifically targets membrane-bound coronaviral RNA synthesis. K22 exerts most potent antiviral activity after virus entry during an early step of the viral life cycle. Specifically, the formation of double membrane vesicles (DMVs), a hallmark of coronavirus replication, was greatly impaired upon K22 treatment accompanied by near-complete inhibition of viral RNA synthesis. K22-resistant viruses contained substitutions in non-structural protein 6 (nsp6), a membrane-spanning integral component of the viral replication complex implicated in DMV formation, corroborating that K22 targets membrane bound viral RNA synthesis. Besides K22 resistance, the nsp6 mutants induced a reduced number of DMVs, displayed decreased specific infectivity, while RNA synthesis was not affected. Importantly, K22 inhibits a broad range of coronaviruses, including Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and efficient inhibition was achieved in primary human epithelia cultures representing the entry port of human coronavirus infection. Collectively, this study proposes an evolutionary conserved step in the life cycle of positive-stranded RNA viruses, the recruitment of cellular membranes for viral replication, as vulnerable and, most importantly, druggable target for antiviral intervention. We expect this mode of action to serve as a paradigm for the development of potent antiviral drugs to combat many animal and human virus infections.",

            "text": "Coronaviruses are enveloped viruses and their positive strand RNA genome, the largest of all RNA viruses, encodes for as many as 16 non-structural proteins (nsps), 4 major structural proteins, and up to 8 accessory proteins (reviewed in [9] ). Many of these proteins provide essential, frequently enzymatic, functions during the viral life cycle and are therefore attractive targets for antiviral intervention. Antiviral strategies are mainly proposed for targeting coronavirus entry and essential enzymatic functions, such as coronavirus protease or RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activities. For example, the spike (S) protein mediates binding of different HCoVs to their specific cellular receptors [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] , an event associated with preferential virus tropism for either ciliated or non-ciliated cells of the airway epithelium [15] . The S protein also mediates fusion between lipids of the viral envelope and the host cell plasma membrane or membranes of endocytic vesicles to promote delivery of viral genomic RNA into the cytoplasm. Virus binding and cell entry events can be inhibited by antibodies directed against the S protein, antibodies or small molecules interfering with the virus receptors, or synthetic peptides derived from the fusion-triggering heptad repeat regions of the S protein (reviewed in [16] ). Following virus entry, the coronavirus genome, a positive sense, capped and polyadenylated RNA strand, is directly translated resulting in the synthesis of coronavirus replicase gene-encoded nsps. Coronavirus nsps are translated as two large polyproteins harboring proteolytic enzymes, namely papain-like and chymotrypsin-like proteinases that extensively process coronavirus polyproteins to liberate up to 16 nsps (nsp 1-16) [9] , [17] [18] [19] [20] . These proteolytic functions are considered essential for coronavirus replication and, consequently, a number of candidate drugs were reported to inhibit coronavirus polyprotein processing [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] . Likewise, the coronavirus RdRp activities, which reside in nsp8 [27] and nsp12 [28] , are considered essential for coronavirus replication and attractive targets for antiviral intervention. In addition to these classical drug targets, coronaviruses encode an array of RNAprocessing enzymes representing additional candidate targets. These include a helicase activity linked to an NTPase activity in nsp13, a 39-59-exonuclease activity linked to a N7-methyltransferase activity in nsp14, an endonuclease activity in nsp15, and a 29-O-methyltransferase activity in nsp16 (reviewed in [28] ).",

            "text": "Like all positive strand RNA viruses, coronaviruses synthesize viral RNA at organelle-like structures in order to compartmentalize this critical step of the viral life cycle to a specialized environment that is enriched in replicative viral and host-cell factors, and at the same time protected from antiviral host defense mechanisms [29] [30] [31] . There is now a growing body of knowledge concerning the involvement, rearrangement and requirement of cellular membranes for RNA synthesis of a number of positive-strand RNA viruses, including coronaviruses [30] , [32] [33] [34] [35] . Three coronaviral nsps, i.e., nsp3, nsp4, and nsp6 [9] , [36] , [37] are thought to participate in formation of these sites for viral RNA synthesis. In particular, these proteins contain multiple trans-membrane domains that are thought to anchor the coronavirus replication complex through recruitment of intracellular membranes to form a reticulovesicular network (RVN) of modified, frequently paired, membranes that includes convoluted membranes [32] and double membrane vesicles (DVM) [38] interconnected via the outer membrane with the rough ER [32] . Indeed, Angelini and colleagues [39] have recently shown that co-expression of all three transmembrane domain-containing SARS-CoV nsps (nsp3, nsp4, and nsp6) is required to induce DMVs that are similar to those observed in SARS-CoV-infected cells. Such organelle-like compartments harboring membrane-bound replication complexes show remarkable parallels amongst a broad range of positive-strand RNA virus families, and are potentially evolutionary linked to similar mechanisms in the life cycle of double-strand (ds)RNA, reverse-transcribing, and cytoplasmic replicating DNA viruses [29] . Coronavirus ER-derived DMVs are induced early after virus entry into the host cell cytoplasm [9] , [32] , [34] , [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] , and display striking similarities to DMVs induced by hepatitis C virus [33] . The evolutionary conservation of engaging host cell-derived organelle-like membranous structures for virus RNA synthesis and genetic evidence that impairment of coronavirus DMV integrity is associated with severe reduction of virus replication [44] , [45] suggest that antiviral intervention by targeting membranes involved in virus replication represents an attractive, however yet largely unexplored approach.",

Compounds that reduced or abolished viral cytopathic effect were re-tested in 24-well plate format for more precise evaluation of their antiviral potential. This two-step screening procedure resulted in several hits including two structurally similar compounds referred to as K22 ( Figure 1A ) and J15 ( Figure S1A ). The former compound, K22, whose structural name is (Z)-N-(3-(4-(4-bromophenyl)-4-hydroxypiperidin-1-yl)-3oxo-1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)benzamide was examined in detail. The compound was completely soluble in medium up to 50 mM. The concentration of K22 that inhibited the number of HCoV-229E plaques by 50% (IC 50 ) was 0.7 mM ( Figure 1B ). K22 did not reduce viability of MRC-5 cells by .50% (CC 50 ) at a concentration range of 0.032-500 mM ( Figure 1C ).

Here we describe a small compound inhibitor of coronavirus replication that (i) specifically targets this membrane-bound RNA replication step and (ii) has broad antiviral activity against number of diverse coronaviruses including highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Since resistance mutations appear in an integral membrane-spanning component of the coronavirus replicase complex, and since all positive stranded RNA viruses have very similar membrane-spanning or membrane-associated replicase components implicated in anchoring the viral replication complex to host cell-derived membranes, our data suggest that the membrane-bound replication step of the viral life cycle is a novel, vulnerable, and druggable target for antiviral intervention of a wide range of RNA virus infections.",

K22 (4 mM) was incubated with cells for a period of only two hours either prior to, during, or after infection with HCoV-229E. As shown in Figure 1D , K22 treatment prior to infection resulted in only marginal reduction of virus infectivity thus excluding blockade of cellular receptor(s) for HCoV-229E as its mode-ofaction. Simultaneous addition of K22 and virus resulted in ,50% reduction of virus infectivity suggesting that the compound may interact with viral particles thus inactivating their binding or cellentry activity. To clarify this possibility, the virus was incubated with ,70 IC 50 doses of K22 or DMSO solvent for 15 min at 37uC, followed by virus dilution and its titration at non-inhibitory compound concentrations. Similar titers were observed for the virus treated with K22 (7.2610 5 /ml68.9%) and DMSO (7.5610 5 /ml64.7%) (n = 2; two experiments), indicating that K22 exhibited no virus particle-inactivating activity. Thus, the ,50% reduction in plaque number ( Figure 1D ) observed by simultaneous addition of K22 and virus is likely due to cellular uptake of K22 and inhibitory activity of probably not yet metabolically processed compound during a very early step of virus replication rather than the drug binding to viral particles and interference with their penetration into cells. This idea is further corroborated by the most pronounced inhibition of HCoV-229E replication when K22 was added after infection ( Figure 1D ). To more precisely determine the time window of efficient K22mediated inhibition of HCoV-229E, K22 (10 mM) was added to infected cells at different time points post infection (p.i.), and intraand extracellular viral RNA, and infectious particles were quantified at 24 hours p.i.. As shown in Figures 1E-F , K22 addition within the first 6 hours p.i. resulted in near complete inhibition of viral RNA synthesis and ,1000-fold reduction of produced infectious virus, suggesting that K22 inhibits most potently post virus entry during the early phase of the HCoV-229E life cycle.",

In two independent experiments we isolated and plaque purified several variants displaying moderate (,2-fold) to strong (,12-fold) K22 resistance (IC 50 of 1.6-8.5 mM; Table 1 ). Whole genome sequencing analysis of wild type (wt) HCoV-229E, mock passaged virus, and K22 passaged virus revealed two amino acid substitutions within nsp 6 (H121L; M159V) that were associated with strong K22 resistance (Table 1) . Sequence alignment and prediction of potential transmembrane regions of nsp6 homologs of HCoV-229E and other coronaviruses used in this study, revealed presence of 7 potential membranespanning domains ( Figure 2 ) 6 of which are proposed to be used as membrane anchors in other coronaviruses [36] , [37] , and that mutations conferring resistance to K22 are located in or near these regions ( Figure 3A ). Subsequent generation of recombinant mutants, designated HCoV-229E H121L , HCoV-229E M159V , and HCoV-229E H121L/M159V , carrying the nsp6 mutations individually or combined by reverse genetics confirmed that these mutations confer resistance to K22 inhibition as revealed by plaque inhibition (Table 1 ) and the time-of-addition ( Figures 3B-C) assays. Thus, as expected from the previous experiment ( Figure 1E ), K22 addition within the first 6 hours p.i. with the wt HCoV-229E resulted in near complete inhibition of viral RNA synthesis ( Figure 3C ), an effect completely abrogated in the drugresistant recombinant mutant viruses ( Figure 3B ). Notably, although the amount of intracellular ( Figure 3D ) and extracellular ( Figure 3E ) viral RNA was comparable between K22-resistant mutants and parental wt HCoV-229E, production of infectious particles during infection with K22-resistant mutant viruses was greatly reduced (up to 34 fold at 48h p.i.) ( Figure 3F ). This difference cannot be attributed to the presence of free viral RNA in preparations of extracellular virus, since the treatment of K22resistant HCoV-229E M159V mutant virus with ribonuclease A did not reduce the quantity of viral RNA ( Figure S2 ). This observation suggests that K22 resistance-conferring mutations in nsp6 are associated with a fitness cost (reduced specific infectivity).",

            "text": "The observation that amino acid substitutions in nsp6 confer K22 resistance strongly suggests a mode-of-action based on interference with host cell membranes required for coronavirus replication. Nsp6 is expressed as a membrane-spanning integral component of the viral replication complex, and is, together with nsp3 and nsp4, implicated in anchoring the coronavirus replicase complex to DMVs or related membrane structures [9] , [36] , [37] , [39] , [43] . Indeed, there is genetic and experimental evidence concerning nsp4-mediated alterations of coronavirus DMVs [44] , [45] , and that ectopic expression of nsp6 results in the formation of ER-derived vesicles [46] . We therefore assessed if K22 may impact the formation of coronavirus-induced DMV by electron microscopy ( Figure 4 ). As expected, perinuclear DMV clusters as well as viral particles were readily detectable in wt HCoV-229E-infected cells ( Figure 4A ). In sharp contrast, no DMV clusters or viral particles were detectable in wt HCoV-229E-infected and K22treated (4 mM) cells ( Figure 4A ). Since double-stranded (ds) RNA is indicative of coronavirus replication and has been shown to reside predominantly within the inner lumen of coronavirus-induced DMVs [32] we also performed immunofluorescence analysis and stained HCoV-229E-infected cells for viral replicase complex (nsp8) and dsRNA. Strikingly, the characteristic perinuclear immunofluorescence staining pattern for viral replicase complexes and dsRNA visible in wt HCoV-229E-infected cells was completely absent under K22 treatment ( Figure 5 ), confirming the remarkable efficacy of K22-mediated inhibition of viral replication and supporting the notion that K22 blocks the formation of DMVs. In contrast to parental wt HCoV-229E and irrespectively whether K22 was applied, recombinant K22 escape mutants were still capable of inducing the formation of DMVs ( Figure 4B ) and displayed the characteristic staining pattern for replicase complexes and dsRNA ( Figure 5 ). Likewise, compound J15 efficiently blocked replication ( Figure S1B ) and DMV formation of wt HCoV-229E but not K22 resistant nsp6 recombinant HCoV-229E M159V ( Figure S3 ) suggesting that J15 may have the same target and mode-of-action. Notably, in cells infected with K22 escape mutants the overall number of DMVs per cell was reduced (30.3629.7 in HCoV-229E M159V versus 65650.1 in wt HCoV-229E infected cells; P,0.05; n = 20), similar as previously described for mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) nsp4 mutants [44] , [45] , while the number of intracellular viral particles that were often packed in tubular vesicle-like structures ( Figures 4A-B ) was comparable to that of wt virus (471.86212.6 in HCoV-229E M159V versus 438.3696.8 in wt virus infected cells; n = 10). We could also frequently detect DMVs displaying partially collapsed inner membranes in cells infected with K22 escape mutants (irrespectively whether or not K22 was applied; Figure 4B ), again similarly as reported for MHV nsp4 mutants [45] , suggesting that nsp6, like nsp4, has a pivotal role in coronavirus DMV formation. Overall, these findings demonstrate that the antiviral activity of K22 (and that of the structurally similar compound J15) results in complete loss of DMVs. This efficient block in replication can be overcome by resistance ",

We therefore assessed if K22 treatment may, independent of virus infection, impact autophagy, a cellular process displaying similarities to coronaviral DMV formation. To this end we first transfected Huh7 cells with a plasmid encoding LC3B-GFP in order to trace rapamycin-induced autophagsomes by life imaging. This analysis revealed that three to six hours after adding rapamycin to the culture medium green fluorescent autophagocytic vesicles become apparent, irrespectively if K22 (20 mM) was added or not (data not shown). We corroborated this result by immunofluorescence analysis of Huh7 cells that were stained for endogenous LC3B at six hours post addition of rapamycin. As shown in supplementary Figure S4 rapamycin-incuced autophagocytic vesicles were again readily detectable in the presence of K22 (20 mM), suggesting that K22 does not impact cellular autophagy.",

Furthermore, there was no cytotoxicity detectable in cells of feline (FCWF cells), murine (L929 cells), and primate (Vero cells) origin in the K22 concentration range assessed, and analysis of K22 cytostatic activities in the cell proliferation assay revealed CC 50 values $40 mM (Table S1) , i.e., the highest drug concentration used in antiviral assays. Notably, the efficacy of K22-mediated inhibition varied amongst different coronaviruses, however whether this is related, as in HCoV-229E, to nsp6 function would require generation and analysis of K22 resistant variants for all coronaviruses tested. In contrast, K22 exhibited little or no effect on replication of poliovirus ( Figure S6 ), a pathogen that like coronaviruses induces rearrangement of cellular membranes to assist RNA replication.",

Fully differentiated primary human airway epithelia (HAE) cultures [15] , [51] derived from three different donors and grown under air-liquid interphase conditions were infected with a recombinant HCoV-229E expressing Renilla luciferase as marker for virus replication [52] , and with MERS-CoV [8] , [51] . MERS-CoV was first described in 2012 and was isolated from a 60-year old man with acute pneumonia, renal failure and fatal outcome in Saudi Arabia [8] . The virus is most likely of zoonotic origin [7] , [53] and by February 2014 the number of laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection reported to the World Health Organization exceeded 182, including more than 79 cases with fatal outcome. We have previously shown that MERS-CoV can readily replicate on primary HAE cells [51] by infecting nonciliated cells expressing the cellular receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 [14] . As shown in Figure 6 , HCoV-229E and MERS-CoV infections were inhibited by K22 treatment with remarkable efficacy, illustrated by reduction of viral replication by several orders of magnitude ( Figure 6E -F) and substantial reduction of dsRNA in MERS-CoV-infected primary HAE cultures ( Figure 6G-H) . This result demonstrates that the broad anti-coronaviral activity of K22 makes this compound particularly promising for the development of efficacious treatment options for emerging coronaviruses, such as MERS-CoV.",

This evolutionary conserved strategy provides a compartment for viral RNA synthesis that is enriched in replicative viral and host cell-derived proteins and believed to protect from antiviral host cell defense mechanisms. The remarkable efficacy of K22-mediated inhibition of coronavirus replication confirms that the employment of host cell membranes for viral RNA synthesis is a crucial step in the coronavirus life cycle, and importantly, demonstrates that this step is extremely vulnerable and also druggable for antiviral intervention.",

Moreover, we expect this mode-of-action to serve as a paradigm for the development of similar antiviral drugs to combat infections caused by many other positive strand RNA viruses. Notably, resistance conferring mutations in nsp6 emerged only after 10-13 consecutive passages of HCoV-229E under K22 selection, and we were so far not successful in obtaining K22resistant MHV-A59 mutants (data not shown). This suggests that escape mutations in membrane domain-containing coronavirus nsps compatible with maintaining efficient RNA synthesis are limited. In addition, the nsp6 escape mutants we have obtained for HCoV-229E display a remarkable reduction of specific infectivity. Thus, although RNA synthesis appears to be unaffected and viral RNA detected in preparations of extracellular virus was ribonuclease insensitive implying its adequate package in viral particles, mutations in nsp6 seem to reduce virus fitness. Thus, it is conceivable that the nsp6 mutants may be functionally impaired during an early step in the viral life cycle. Since dsRNA is localized in DMVs and nsp6 escape mutants induced decreased number of DMVs that are structurally impaired, it is possible that the reduced specific infectivity of these viruses could be related to dsRNAtriggered innate immune responses.",

Nsp6 of HCoV-229E (this report), MHV, and SARS-CoV [36] , [37] is predicted as a hexaspaning protein comprising a conserved C-terminal cytoplasmic tail. The latter domain may serve as a wedge-like amphipathic helix which upon insertion into the lipid membrane can trigger its bending due to induction of positive membrane curvature (reviewed in [54] ). The vesicle formation would also require a putative ion channel activity that depolarizes curved membranes thus facilitating their fusion and vesicle scission. The question as to whether nsp6 or other components of the coronavirus replicase complex exhibit such activities would require further investigation.",

            "text": "Although our data reveal that the K22 escape mutations occur in nsp6, further binding experiments are required to clarify whether K22 targets nsp6 directly. We observed that K22 is most active in inhibiting replication of the tested a-coronaviruses (HCoV-229E, FCoV) and the c-coronavirus IBV, whereas amongst b-coronaviruses K22 was highly active in inhibiting MERS-CoV, but only moderately against MHV or SARS-CoV ( Figure 6 ). It is conceivable that K22 may strong inhibit acoronaviruses, since K22 has been identified by screening for anti-HCoV-229E activity. However, the limited nsp6 sequence similarity between coronaviruses (Figure 2 ) does not allow predicting the strength of K22-mediated inhibition of replication based on nsp6 homology. We also like to address in future studies a question of how the moderately resistant virus variant L (containing mutations in nsp15 and nucleocapsid) can escape K22mediated inhibition of replication. This variant, in contrast to these containing resistance mutations in nsp6, exhibited only moderate resistance to K22 (,2-3-fold) and was not consistently selected in separate selection experiments. Although nsp15 and nucleocapsid protein have not yet been described as being directly involved in DMV formation, these proteins are components of the replicase complex that may somehow affect/modulate nsp6 functions, and compensatory mutations in these proteins may partially relieve K22 blockade of nsp6. An alternative possibility is that the actual K22 target may be a cellular protein or a process of recruitment of a cellular protein that participates in coronavirusinduced membrane rearrangements by interacting with nsp6. While we could not observe any detectable impact of K22 on the formation of autophagosomes, further studies are required to address if K22 may target similar vesicles, such as EDEMosomes [41] . Both possibilities are compatible with the observed phenotype of DMV impairment and the detection of resistance mutations at regions of HCoV-229E nsp6 that are structurally conserved while displaying only limited sequence similarity. It is thus conceivable that membrane domain-containing nsp3 and nsp4 may represent additional drug targets. Similar as described for the related arteriviruses, where co-expression of membranespanning nsp2 and nsp3 results in membrane alterations and DMV formation similar to those observed during arterivirus infection [55] , [56] , co-expression of coronavirus nsp3, nsp4 and nsp6 is required to produce coronavirus-like membrane rearrangements including DMVs [39] . Expression of nsp3, nsp4 or nsp6 alone or in combinations of two induces aberrant membrane rearrangements that only partially mimic membrane structures known from coronavirus infection [39] . Thus, there is growing evidence that nsp3, nsp4, nsp6, and possibly ER membraneresident host cell proteins [41] , [57] , orchestrate critical events that lead to the development of suitable membrane structures facilitating coronavirus RNA synthesis. Since K22 apparently interferes with these processes, inhibitors like K22 and corresponding escape mutants will likely become valuable tools to further our understanding on the induction of membrane alterations and DMV formation that take place during the early phase of the coronavirus life cycle. For example, co-expression of nsp3, nsp4 and native or mutated nsp6 in the absence of virus replication, similar as described by Angelini and colleagues [39] , may help to clarify whether presence of K22 would affect formation of DMV by directly targeting nsp6 or cellular protein(s) required and recruited for DMV formation.",

Specifically, we are currently focusing on the structure-activity relationship analysis of K22 analogs, with the aim to identify compounds with improved antiviral and cytotoxic profiles prior to their assessment in vivo. However, one important lesson of the past SARS-CoV and recent MERS-CoV outbreaks is that zoonotic transmission of coronaviruses into the human population can pose considerable threat to human health and that it is warranted to eventually invest significant efforts to developing efficacious and approved drugs to increase preparedness and combat coronavirus infections. The antiviral activity against a number of diverse coronaviruses makes K22 an ideal candidate for further development towards an efficacious ''pan-coronavirus inhibitor''. Broad anti-coronaviral activity has been proposed for inhibitors targeting highly conserved enzymatic functions, such as coronavirus proteinase activities [26] , [58] , or more recently, for compounds targeting host cell factors required for efficient replication, such as cyclophilins [59] , [60] . The concept of targeting multiple key functions of viral replication led to the development of efficacious treatment regimens against HIV and hepatitis C virus by combining multiple antiviral drugs [61] , [62] and it is tempting to speculate that this concept will be applicable to combat coronavirus infections in the future. Moreover, with the identification of K22, we demonstrate that there are yet additional critical steps in the life cycle of positive strand RNA viruses to explore as targets for antiviral intervention.",

Experiments with recombinant nsp6 mutant viruses and original virus were carried out in a similar manner except that the cells were inoculated at a moi of ,0.25 and incubated with or without the presence of 4 mM K22.
