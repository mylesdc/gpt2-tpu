Moreover, different studies have demonstrated a subtype dependent interaction between viral non-structural protein (NS1) and cellular nucleolin, suggesting a role of the nucleolar targeting functions of NS1 in IAV pathogenesis 28, 29 . Proteomics-based approaches have revealed changes in the nucleolar proteome of IAV infected cells 5,30 and identified several nucleolar components, such as nucleolin, nucleophosmin (B23) and ribosomal proteins, as putative interactants of reconstituted IAV vRNPs 7 .

We first characterized NP, the main component of IAV vRNP, as co-localizing and interacting with endogenous nucleolin during infection. Moreover, using cell fractionation and RNAi approaches, we suggest that nucleolin contributes to efficient vRNP trafficking and viral replication. Based on our results, we propose nucleolin as an essential host factor for the chromatin targeting of the nucleocytoplasmic export complex of vRNPs during infection.",

To achieve this export, influenza viruses hijack the host cell export machinery. However, the complete mechanisms underlying this hijacking remain not fully understood. We have previously shown that influenza viruses induce a marked alteration of the nucleus during the time-course of infection and notably in the nucleolar compartment. In this study, we discovered that a major nucleolar component, called nucleolin, is required for an efficient export of vRNPs and viral replication. We have notably shown that nucleolin interacts with the viral nucleoprotein (NP) that mainly constitutes vRNPs. Our results suggest that this interaction could allow vRNPs to \"catch\" the host cell export machinery, a necessary step for viral replication.",

Considering the strongly altered host nucleolar ultrastructure and composition during IAV infection, we analyzed the subcellular localization of three major constitutive nucleolar proteins, nucleolin, B23 and fibrillarin, during the time course of influenza infection. We used immuno-fluorescence confocal microscopy in human lung epithelial A549 cells, mock-infected or infected by influenza A/Moscow/10/99 (H3N2) virus, at 7 and 10 hours post infection (hpi). In addition to nucleolin, B23 or fibrillarin immunostaining, we also used NP as an indicator of viral cycle advancement, as previously carried out 3, [17] [18] [19] [20] . As expected in mock-infected cells, the three nucleolar proteins mainly localized in nucleoli (Fig. 1 , panels a to h and Supplementary Figure 1B,C) . During infection, localization patterns of B23 and fibrillarin remained unmodified up to 7 hpi (data not shown) compared to mock-infected cells, as previously reported 7, 27 . In contrast, when NS1 is notably accumulated within nucleolus at this time (Supplementary Figure 1A) , nucleolin no longer preferentially localized in the subnuclear compartment and instead displayed a broad relocalization throughout the nucleus (Fig. 1 , panels i to p; and Supplementary Figure 1A ), in accordance with previous study 28 . Later in infection (10 hpi), as illustrated by the mainly cytoplasmic localization of NP, nucleolin mostly redistributed at the nuclear periphery of more than 95% of the infected cells (Fig. 1 , panels q to x). At this time most of the fibrillarin accumulated in a large nuclear spot (Supplementary Figure 1B) , probably linked to the ultrastructural remodeling of the nucleolar compartment 3,17-20 , whereas B23 remained associated (Supplementary Figure 1C) .",

As shown in Fig. 3A , endogenous nucleolin was pulled down from GST-NP lysates (Fig. 3A, lane 2) . In comparison, no interaction with nucleolin was characterized with cell lysate obtained after transfection of non-fused GST protein (Fig. 3A, lane 1) . In addition, a very weak interaction with nucleolin was characterized with GST-NS1 (Fig. 3A , lane 3). This partial discrepancy with a previous study 29 could be explained by the different strain origin of the NS1 tested (A/WSN/33), especially considering other reports showing strikingly different properties among NS1 of various origins 28 . Another explanation would be our experimental conditions being based on transient expression in A549 cells and not on the use of recombinant proteins expressed from bacteria 29 . On the other hand, our use of GST-NEP protein expression as a negative control did confirm no interaction with nucleolin (Fig. 3A, lane 4) . Additionally, this interaction between endogenous nucleolin and transiently expressed NP was also confirmed by immunoprecipitation assay using a specific rabbit polyclonal anti-nucleolin antibody 43 (data not shown).",

The immunoprecipitated complexes from infected cells contained NP, the amount of which increased from 8 hpi to 24 hpi (Fig. 3B , lane 5 versus 8). Otherwise, RNAse A treatment did not abolished immunoprecipitation of NP, suggesting nucleolin could interact with both vRNP and non-vRNP forms of NP (Supplementary Figure 3) . Alternatively, we investigated the presence of vRNA in immunoprecipitated complexes in similar experimental conditions (Fig. 3C ). To this end, we subjected cell lysates of infected cells (8 and 24 hpi) to anti-nucleolin immunoprecipitation before extracting the putative associated vRNAs for quantification by specific RT-qPCR (Fig. 3C) , described in our previous study 60 . As expected, total cell lysates at 24 hpi contained more vRNA copies as compared to those at 8 hpi; total cell lysates from mock-infected cells contained no detectable vRNA. Accordingly, we detected vRNAs in complex containing NP at 8 hpi and mostly at 24 hpi, whereas no vRNA in control (IgG) (Fig. 3C, right panel) .",

In contrast, the si-nucleolin treatment strongly affected the subcellular localization of NP during infection (Fig. 4A , panels b versus f, j versus n) in such a way that 1.9 to 3 times more cells harbored a stringent nuclear pattern only for NP in this condition, compared to the si-Control condition at 8 and 24 hpi, respectively.

A549 cells, previously transfected with si-Control or si-Nucleolin, were infected with H3N2 virus (MOI 1) for 24 h and harvested for nucleocytoplasmic fractionation. As a control, we studied the expression of histone H3 and \u03b2 -tubulin. As expected, endogenous nucleolin had been silenced in the different sub-cellular fractions (Fig. 4C , compare lanes 1, 3 and 5 with lanes 2, 4 and 6, respectively). Moreover, the two experimental si-RNA conditions showed no difference in terms of expression levels of NP and PB1 viral proteins in whole cell extracts, suggesting no effect on viral protein expression (Fig. 4C , lanes 5 and 6). In contrast, we noted a strong increase of NP and PB1 in the nuclear fractions of si-Nucleolin-treated cells as compared to those of si-Control (Fig. 4C, lanes 3 and 4) , while the cytoplasm fractions displayed similar protein ratios between the two si-RNA conditions (Fig. 4C, lanes 1 and 2) . We completed this analysis by performing total RNA extraction from the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions, followed by a quantification of viral genome copy numbers by RT-qPCR (Fig. 4D) . Results revealed no difference in cytoplasmic fractions between si-Nucleolin and si-Control (Fig. 4D, left panel) . In contrast, the nuclear fraction of si-Nucleolin treated cells contained a significative higher level of vRNA copies than that of the control (Fig. 4D , right panel, p-value < 0.05). In accordance with these results, the silencing of nucleolin also significantly reduced the yield of progeny virus produced at 24 and 30 hpi, as compared to si-Control conditions. Quantification of vRNA copies number/ml in cell supernatants revealed a marked decrease in viral progeny yield that could reach up to 95.5% at 30 hpi, (MOI 0.2, Fig. 4E ) or up to 63% at 30 hpi (MOI 2, Fig. 4E ). This result was also confirmed by quantification of infectious titers (TCID50/mL) in supernatants, with a slight decrease and a delay of viral production in the context of silencing of nucleolin (Fig. 4F) .",

Discussion Influenza A are nuclear replicating viruses which have direct access to and thus hijack host nuclear machineries in order to achieve optimal infection 3 . In this context, several studies including ours have described the extensive modifications of nuclear ultrastructure and composition 7,5,30 with marked nucleolar and chromatin alterations in IAV infected cells 17, 18, 20 . In accordance with these observations, we report in this study the differential delocalization through the nucleus of the three major nucleolar components, nucleolin, B23 and fibrillarin during the time-course of IAV infection. Interestingly, the earlier and specific redistribution of nucleolin was of interest and in particular its dynamic colocalization with NP at the vicinity of the inner nuclear membrane, where vRNPs accumulate before their nuclear export 13, 16, 58 . Consequently, we then investigated the putative connection between nucleolin and vRNP traffic, notably in regard to a previous study that identified nucleolin as a possible interaction partner of reconstituted IAV vRNPs, without further exploring the functional significance of this interaction 7 . Interestingly, some functional interactions have been described in other viral models, such as feline calicivirus (FCV) and Norwalk virus (NV), in which infections also result in a relocalization of nucleolin from nucleoli to nucleoplasm and the perinuclear area. In this context, nucleolin was shown to act as a positive regulator of viral replication by forming RNP complexes with viral RNA and interacting with the viral NS6/7 proteins 54 .",

Chase and collaborators proposed that association between vRNPs and export machinery occurs in dense chromatin domains, where RCC1 exchanges GDP for GTP to produce export energy. They suggested that IAV gain preferential access to host nuclear export machinery by targeting vRNP export complexes to chromatin-dense territories which confer a physical proximity to the sites of Ran regeneration 13 . Our results support the model proposed by Chase and collaborators and also suggest the requirement of nucleolin in the close association between vRNPs and the host chromatin (Fig. 6A) . Indeed, by subnuclear fractionation, we observed a strong accumulation of nucleolin within the condensed chromatin domain (ch500 fraction), which is targeted by vRNPs at 24 hpi. Moreover, depletion of endogenous nucleolin induced a decrease in accumulation of NP, a component of vRNP trafficking through the condensed chromatin fractions.",

Indeed, nucleolin is known to induce chromatin de-condensation by binding to histone H1 72 and thus has a function analogous to the family of high-mobility-group (HMG) proteins. In this context, the nucleolin-H1 interaction could cooperate to reorganize cellular chromatin in order to facilitate its efficient targeting by vRNPs. By interacting with NP, the main component of vRNPs, nucleolin would thus constitute a key mediator in the vRNP nuclear export (Fig. 6A ). Alternatively and in regards to RNase sensitivity assay, nucleolin most probably also interacts with non-vRNP form of NP during infection, which could incidentally have an impact on several other steps of viral cycle, as well, including vRNP assembly and/or trafficking.",

Alternatively, NP interactants are strongly enriched in nucleo-cytoplasmic transport proteins, such as RAN or KPNA1, and protein complexes associated with the nuclear envelope such as Nup62 (Red squares, Benjamini P-value = 1.7 \u00d7 10 \u22122 ) (Fig. 6B) . Interestingly, at the interface of chromatin organization and nucleo-cytoplasmic transport processes, and in addition to p53 (TP53) which we have previously shown to be involved in multiple levels of IAV-host interactions 73, 74 , B23 (NPM1) represents another common interactant of NP and nucleolin as well as interacting with vRNP 7, 28 .",

Human lung epithelial cells (A549) were cultivated in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM, Lonza, Biowhittaker) supplemented with 200 units/ml penicillin, 200 \u03bc g/ml streptomycin, 2 mM L-glutamine and 10% fetal calf serum (Dutscher). All cells were maintained at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO2. For infection, viruses were inoculated at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 for 1 hpi to 24 hpi, in DMEM supplemented with 200 units/ml penicillin, 200 \u03bc g/ml streptomycin, 2 mM L-glutamine and 0.5 \u03bc g/ml TPCK-trypsin (Roche diagnostics), as previously described 17 .

The confocal image stacks were treated by three-dimensional visualization software: Amira version 3.1 (Mercury Inc). To create three-dimensional animations and pictures, two methods were applied. Isosurface generated a geometric surface representing points of constant value as a limit between shadow and brightness of a staining. This limit was defined through an adjusted threshold. This representation was used to define the limit of the nucleus staining (DAPI). Volume rendering visualization technique was used to simulate the casting of light rays through the volume and give a 3D impression of the stained structure.
