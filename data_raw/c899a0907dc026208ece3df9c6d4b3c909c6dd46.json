Accurate and timely diagnosis of infection remains challenging to both clinician and laboratory. Clinical and laboratory signs of systemic inflammation, including changes in body temperature, tachycardia, respiratory rate and leucocytosis, are sensitive. However, their use is limited by poor specificity for the diagnosis of sepsis, because critically ill patients often present with the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) but no infection [1, [4] [5] [6] . These issues have fuelled the search for a reliable marker. Many potential biomarkers have been investigated, but only C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT) are currently used on a routine basis [7] [8] [9] [10] . The search for a single magic bullet marker might ultimately be fruitless, but a combination of markers could improve diagnosis, prognosis and treatment efficacy, and thereby survival [7] .",

The value of sTREM-1 in diagnosing sepsis in settings other than the ICU remains to be determined. Another novel infectious disease biomarker is soluble urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR). Concentrations of suPAR are increased in conditions that involve immune activation, and studies have shown that high concentrations of suPAR portend a poor clinical outcome in diverse infections such as tuberculosis, malaria and pneumococcal bacteraemia [14, 15] . Finally, the cytokine macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) has been found to be a valuable marker of microbiologically documented infection in patients who have undergone cardiac surgery [16] , and elevated MIF concentrations may be an early indicator of poor outcome in patients with sepsis [17] .

Information from the three single best performing markers and all six markers were combined using the method reported by by Xiong and coworkers [27] , that is, by identifying the linear combination of markers that yielded the greatest area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). This led to the construction of a composite threemarker test and a composite six-marker test optimized to differentiate between bacterial and nonbacterial causes of inflammation. Standard errors of the AUCs were obtained using the method reported by Xiong and coworkers [27] , based on Fisher's Z transformation. The diagnostic performances of the composite markers were compared with the performances of all singles marker using the AUC, in accordance with by the method suggested by Hanley and McNeil [28] . All tests were two sided, and P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Data were analyzed using the statistical package R version 2.3.1 (R Development Core Team, Vienna, Austria).

Additional analysis of the ability of single markers to discriminate between infection of any kind and no infection It was apparent from Figure 2 that patients with a parasitic (Plasmodium falciparum) infection had high concentrations of CRP and PCT in particular, and so the effect of omitting these patients on the AUCs for these two markers was determined. This analysis identified AUCs of 0.83 (95% CI 0.76-0.90) and 0.77 (95% CI 0.69-0.85) for CRP and PCT, respectively, with regard to discrimination between bacterial and nonbacterial causes of inflammation.

Several statistical studies have addressed the problem of combining correlated diagnostic tests to maximize discriminatory power. These include logistic regression and linear and nonlinear discriminate analyses to identify the linear combination of markers that yield the greatest AUC [29, 30] . These models derive a score but not a specific decision rule, as decision trees, Bayesian decision making and neural networks do [4, 27, 29, [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] .",

Gibot and coworkers [13] measured sTREM-1 in plasma samples from ICU patients with SIRS suspected of having an infection; they found that sTREM-1 was able to diagnose infection with a sensitivity of 96% (95% CI 92-100%) and a specificity of 89% (95% CI 82-95%). There were large difference between the two patient cohorts, both in terms of spectrum and severity of disease. It is known from previous studies that the diagnostic accuracies of several sepsis markers are highly dependent on the setting in which they are tested. Based on data from these studies, it seems that PCT, in particular, exhibits superior per-formance to that of CRP when it is used in an ICU; this might as well be the case for sTREM-1 [3, 9, 13, 22, 25, [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] . In addition, different analytical methods, plasma anticoagulants, and plasma sampling and processing procedures were used [12, 21] . In this regard we have shown that the half-life of sTREM-1 in plasma is short (1.5 hours), and so our handling procedures in the present study might have been too slow [21] . Recently published findings on plasma sTREM-1 in patients with pneumonia, COPD and asthma in a setting similar to ours indicate no difference in admission levels of sTREM-1 between COPD and pneumonia patients, although the AUC for guidance of antibiotic therapy was found to be 0.77 (95% CI 0.70-0.84) [44] , which is almost identical to the AUC of 0.76 (95% CI 0.62-0.91) achieved in our subgroup analysis.",

            "text": "Despite our study's strengths, however, several limitations deserve consideration. It is probably an oversimplification to use a linear model to combine markers. Quadratic or cubic transformations of the biomarkers might improve diagnostic accuracy. Because we used clinical criteria and microbiological evidence, it might have been difficult to ascertain the precise cause of SIRS in all patients, and this might have introduced some misclassification bias. The expert panel disregarded measurements of leucocytes and CRP, but -as in most studies on diagnostic sepsis markers -total blinding was not achievable, because these measurements are an integrated part the routine monitoring of infectious disease patients and the values are reflected in the way in which the patient is treated. This might have lead to incorporation bias and thus an overestimation of the diagnostic power of these two markers as compared with the other markers tested, although this was not reflected in any statistically significant differences in the concentrations of any of the markers in the patients with 'known' versus 'unknown' bacterial infection. Thus, it seems that no marker was afforded preferential conditions by the classification. The fact that not all samples were collected before antibiotic therapy was initiated might weaken the results, because markers with short half-life would be more affected than markers with long half-life. Patients with dementia or other mental diseases could not participate in this study (because of the need for informed written consent), and so it is not know whether the results are valid for this important group of patients. Finally, our results may apply only to patients with community-acquired infections, which do not require hospitalization in an ICU directly at admission, and so they may not be valid in ICU patients.",
