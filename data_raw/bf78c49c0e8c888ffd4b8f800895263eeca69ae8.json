Previous studies have shown that NBV can infect and replicate in a wide variety of cell types derived from their natural host (bat), as well as from human, mouse and monkey. Within permissive cells, NBV induced significant cytopathic effects characterised by cell-cell fusion and syncytia formation. To understand the molecular events that underpin NBV infection we examined the host transcriptome and proteome response of two cell types, derived from bat (PaKiT03) and mouse (L929), to characterise differential cellular susceptibility to NBV.",

At both the transcriptome and proteome level, the host response was dominated by IFN production and signalling pathways. The majority of proteins up-regulated in L929 and PaKiT03 cells were also up-regulated at the mRNA (gene) level, and included many important IFN stimulated genes. Further functional experimentation demonstrated that stimulating IFN signalling prior to infection, significantly reduced NBV replication in PaKiT03 cells. Moreover, inhibiting IFN signalling (through specific siRNAs) increased NBV replication in L929 cells. In line with the significant cytopathic effects seen in PaKiT03 cells, we also observed a down-regulation of genes involved in cell-cell junctions, which may be related to the fusogenic effects of NBV.",

            "text": "Nelson Bay orthoreovirus (NBV) is the prototypic member of the Pteropine orthoreovirus species. This group contains viruses that have been isolated from both bats and humans. NBV was isolated in 1970 from the blood of a grey-headed flying fox (Pteropus poliocephalus) [1] . Bats are considered natural hosts for a number of Pteropine orthoreovirus species, including NBV, Pulau virus [2] and Xi River virus [3] . Human isolates of Pteropine orthoreovirus species are genetically related to NBV [4] and are often from patients with respiratory illness. Indeed, Melaka virus (MelV) was the first bat-related orthoreovirus isolated from a human exhibiting respiratory symptoms [5] with the transmission believed to be from bats. Further, other Pteropine orthoreovirus species such as Kampar, HK23629/07, HK46886/09, HK50842/10 and Miyazaki-Bali/2007 have all been isolated from humans presenting respiratory illness [6] [7] [8] [9] . A link to either direct or indirect contact with bats was demonstrated in a number of these cases [5, 6, 8, 10] . A seroprevalence study of 272 human serum samples in Vietnam identified 12 serum samples to be seropositive for Pteropine orthoreovirus. This suggests that human infection with Pteropine orthoreovirus species is potentially more prevalent than initially thought [11] . To date, NBV has not been linked to clinical disease in humans, however given the increasing number of spill-over events from bats to humans, the potential transmissionand pathogenicityof this virus in humans, domestic animals and livestock must be considered.",

Within almost all of these cell lines, NBV -like other fusogenic orthoreovirusescauses extensive cell-cell fusion (syncytia) and viral replication. One exception was a mouse fibroblast cell line, known as L929, which was significantly less permissive to infection compared to other mammalian cell lines [12] . In NBV infected L929 cells, there was reduced syncytia and a difference in viral replication compared to permissive cell types, including other mouse cell types. The ability of L929 cells to resist infection with NBV was an interesting observation, given that L929 is also the cell type of choice that is used to propagate the non-fusogenic mammalian orthoreovirus (MRV) [13] .",

In particular, MB induces large syncytia in L929 and Vero cells as early as 12 h post infection (hpi) [9] , and MB replicates to similar titres in L929 and Vero cells. Taken together, these findings suggest that the reduced permissiveness of L929 cells to NBV is due to a unique host/pathogen interaction between the L929 cell type and NBV. Presently the molecular mechanisms that underpin this interaction is unknown. We propose that elucidating the host factors that regulate the interaction between L929 cells and NBV will shed light on the elements required for an effective antiviral response against fusogenic orthoreoviruses, thereby informing future therapeutic design.",

The induction of syncytia is not required for virus entry and is only observed during infection with the FAST protein trafficked to the plasma membrane, mediating fusion with neighbouring cells [18] . These fusion proteins provide an efficient way for dissemination of the virus via cell to cell spread. The fusion of uninfected cells, allow for the use of their translational machinery for virus replication. In addition, syncytia formation serves to sequester the virus allowing it to avoid immune system components that attempt to clear infection, such as complement proteins, antibodies and phagocytes [19, 20] .",

The mechanisms by which L929 cells limit syncytia formation and viral replication is of particular interest in the broader context of understanding, and ultimately mitigating, infection with fusogenic nonenveloped viruses. To this end, the present study aimed to identify host factors that influence NBV replication and cytopathic effects by exploiting differences in NBV permissiveness between cell types. Immortalised bat kidney cells, PaKiT03, which represent a highly permissive (and natural host) cell type was compared with the relatively resistant L929 cells. To identify critical host factors, we used an integrated Proteomics Informed by Transcriptomics (PIT) approach [21] to simultaneously quantify changes in gene expression and protein synthesis at a genome wide scale. Based on transcriptome sequencing (RNASeq) and stable isotope labelling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) coupled with mass spectrometry (MS), this approach has been used to successfully examine virus host interactions previously in a non-model species (Fig. 1) [22] . More recently the PIT approach was evaluated for proteomic characterisation of an organism's repertoire of genetic transposable elements [23] .",

For instance, genomics provides information on the number of genes and sequence information of these genes, and using these sequences it is possible to construct phylogenetic trees to compare evolutionary relationships. The application of transcriptome technologies is for the study of an organism's transcriptome to assess gene expression activities. Although, transcript information is obtained it fails to provide complete information on protein synthesis and their abundance, which is known to not have a perfect correlation to gene expression through transcription. This is particularly true for proteins that have functional (enzymes) other than a structural role in any biological system. Although an integrated PIT approach does not guarantee complete correlation between gene expression and protein synthesis which is due to the temporal lag in the sequence of events. It is considered the most representative approach in comparison with transcriptomics and proteomics applied alone.",

For this analysis, we calculated the average mRNA fold change for all transcripts that were assigned to differentially expressed proteins. The proteins were annotated based on their transcript annotation (determined through BLASTx as described above). Given only a small number of proteins were differentially expressed at 8 hpi, we restricted this analysis to only those proteins that were differentially expressed at 24 hpi. In general, we found a positive relationship between protein up-regulation and mRNA up-regulation in both cell types ( Fig. 4a and b) . That is, most proteins up-regulated were also up-regulated at the mRNA level. Furthermore, many of the proteins up-regulated in L929 cells at 24 hpi were also up-regulated in the PaKiT03 cells ( Fig. 4a and b) . In contrast, and in both cell types, proteins down-regulated at 24 hpi were generally not down-regulated at the mRNA level. Taken together these findings suggest that increased protein expression within the host is likely regulated through mRNA transcriptional activity in response to NBV. In contrast, the processes leading to the down-regulation of host proteins following NBV infection are likely driven at the post-transcriptional level.",

A full description of enriched pathways for L929 and PaKiT03 cells are included as Additional file 9: Table S7 and Additional file 10: Table S8 . In both cell types, the broad 'Immune Response' (R-HAS-168256) pathway, including its sub-pathways ' Adaptive Immune Response' , 'Cytokine Signalling' and 'Innate Immune Response' were the most significantly overrepresented pathway at both 8 and 24 hpi (Fig. 5 ). Within these subpathways, RIG-I/MDA5 mediated induction of interferon, interferon signalling and MHC class I antigen processing/presentation were the most significantly overrepresented pathways in both cell types (Fig. 5) .",

Subtle differences however existed in the composition of genes and their expression kinetics. Central to the immune response pathways described above is the up-regulation of the intracellular pathogen recognition receptors (namely the RIG-I-like receptors) RIG-I (DDX58) and MDA5 (IFIH1) and subsequent downstream production of IFN molecules. In both cell types DDX58/Ddx58 and IFIH1/Ifih1 were up-regulated at the mRNA and protein level ( Fig. 6a  and b) . Consequently, we also observed an mRNA up-regulation of the transcription factors that are responsible for relaying RIG-I/MDA5 signals to promote the transcription of IFN genes. These genes included IFN regulatory factors (IRFs) and NF-\u03baB genes. In both L929 and PaKiT03 cells, IFNB1/Ifnb1 was up-regulated significantly at the mRNA level at both 8 and 24 hpi. In L929 cells, we also observed an up-regulation of Ifna2 and Ifna5. In line with the up-regulation of type I IFN's, we also observed a significant induction of IFN stimulated genes (ISGs) at both the mRNA and protein level. This included the IFN-induced proteins with tetratricopeptide repeats (IFIT1/Ifit1, IFIT2/Ifit2 and IFIT3/Ifit3), Myxovirus (Influenza virus) resistance genes (MX1/Mx1 and MX2/Mx2) and 2-5A synthetase family members (OAS1, OAS2/Oas2, OAS3/Oas3 and OASl) ( Fig. 6a and b) . Interestingly the kinetics of this response varied between the cell types. Indeed, PaKiT03 cells appeared to show a stronger ISG response at 8 hpi compared to L929 cells for some genes such as the IFN-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITM1 and IFITM2/Ifitm2) and MX1/Mx1. The up-regulation of IFNB1/Ifnb1 was also much stronger within the PaKiT03 cells at 8 hpi compared to L929 cells. We also observed a difference in protein expression between the two cell types. There were 34 and 42 genes in L929 and PaKiT03 cells respectively that were associated with type I IFN signaling. However, there was protein evidence for 14 genes in the L929 cells and 5 genes in the PaKiT03 cells. Genes and proteins related to MHC class I antigen presentation were also significantly up-regulated in both cell types, suggesting activation of cell mediated immune responses.",

We postulated that the strong IFN signalling response in L929 cells may be associated with the reduced viral titre observed in these cells.

            "text": "Bats are now recognised as a major reservoir of important zoonotic viruses. High profile examples include the henipaviruses, SARS [38] and MERS [39] coronaviruses, and the filoviruses, Ebola [40] and Marburg [41] . Bat borne Pteropine orthoreoviruses have also been associated with human disease and represents a growing public health concern. Despite its isolation almost four decades ago, little is known concerning the zoonotic potential of NBV. Our previous work has shown that NBV can infect and replicate in a wide variety of cell lines, and cause extensive fusogenic cytopathic effects in permissive cell lines. The present study, aimed to investigate the host response further by identifying the molecular events that underpin NBV infection and syncytia formation. We proposed that by exploiting two cell types which differ in their susceptibility to NBV, we may also be able to identify host factors that influence cell tropism. Interestingly, despite the fact that the cell lines differed considerable in their ability to support NBV replication, the host response of PaKiT03 and L929 cells was remarkably similar. Immune response processes, namely IFN production and signalling, were highly up-regulated at the mRNA and protein level in both cell types. Indeed, genes and proteins involved in RIG-I/ MDA5 pathogen recognition receptors; IFN production; and ISG stimulation were induced at either 8 hpi and/or 24 hpi. While both cell types showed an overall similar response in respect to immune system process, the expression kineticsparticularly at the mRNA levelvaried between the cell lines. Indeed, PaKiT03 cells demonstrated a stronger up-regulation of IFNB1 and the ISGs (MX1, IFITM2 and IFITM3) at 8 hpi compared to the L929 cells at the same time point. We suspect that the early (8 hpi) induction of IFNB1 and its downstream signalling in the PaKiT03 cells may be a consequence of the increased viral transcription/replication within these cells compared to L929 cells. In line with previously published work [42] , we observed no induction of IFN-\u03b1 in the PaKiT03 cells, while both Ifna2 and Ifna5 were induced in the L929 cells at 24 hpi. This is similar to previous work from our laboratory that has shown that the transcript of IFN-\u03b1 is constitutively expressed in P. alecto cells and tissues, but is not inducible following viral infection in PaKiT03 cells [42] . The fact that IFNB1 was both more rapidly and strongly induced in PaKiT03 cells may suggest that this is a way these cells compensate for a lack of inducible IFN-\u03b1. Additional research will be required in the future to explore this hypothesis. Infection of cells with virus results in a large induction of ISGs. Interestingly, ISG15 that has known antiviral activity against a number of viruses such as Respiratory syncytial virus [43] , Chikungunya virus [44] , Ebola virus [45] and MRVs [46] was strongly up-regulated in PaKiT03 and L929 cells at the gene level. This expression of ISG15 is evident in the L929 cells at a protein level, however, there was no evidence of protein expression in the PaKiT03 cells. The antiviral activity of ISG15 is through the conjugation to other proteins, altering its function, and is termed ISGylation. Given the effect that ISG15 has on a broad range of viruses, perhaps there is a similar interaction occurring in L929 cells and not in PaKiT03 cells with NBV infection. As there is no evidence of ISG15 expression in PaKiT03 cells which exhibits extensive CPE and high virus titre compared to L929 cells, adds credence to this theory [47] . This is not the first study to show that reoviruses can induce IFN production and signalling pathways. Indeed, mammalian reovirus dsRNA has been shown to be recognised by RIG-I and MDA5 and causes an induction of the IFN response [48] . Not only that, reoviruses are also susceptible to the effects of this IFN response [49] .",

Given these finding, it appeared unclear whether the IFN response in either cell line was effective at reducing NBV replication. To address this question, we investigated the functional relevance of IFN signalling on NBV replication in L929 and PaKiT03 cells. We showed that NBV replication and CPE was reduced in the PaKiT03 cells (at 24 hpi) when cells were primed with Universal type I IFN. Moreover, disruption of the IFN signalling pathwaythrough siRNA transfectionsincreased the replication of NBV within the L929 cells. Taken together, these experiments demonstrated that the type I IFN response is indeed capable of reducing NBV replication in both PaKiT03 and L929 cells. However, given the strong IFN response seen in the PaKiT03 cells, it seems unlikely that the IFN activity is solely responsible for inhibiting NBV replication in the L929 cells. Reduced viral receptor expression, could also contribute to the increased resistance of L929 cells to NBV. However, to date, no host molecules have been identified as receptors that are required for NBV infection in any cell type.",

            "text": "The parallel integration of proteomic and transcriptomic datasets provides multidimensional insights of host-pathogen interactions. Certainly, within our study we found that the majority of proteins up-regulated following NBV infection, were also up-regulated at the mRNA level. However, proteins down-regulated were generally not down-regulated at the mRNA level. Taken together these findings suggest that increased protein expression within the host is likely regulated through mRNA transcriptional activity in response to NBV. In line with this theory, we observed the up-regulation of important host transcription factors that specifically promote the expression of immune gene sets. Indeed, in both cell types we observed up-regulation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT1/Stat1 and STAT2/Stat2) and IFN regulatory factors, IRF [54] , both of which are essential for IFN signalling pathways. In contrast, the processes leading to the downregulation of host proteins following NBV infection may be driven at the post-transcriptional level, or possibly a direct consequence of virus mediated degradation. It has been shown that proteins are able to target cellular translation factors, as is the case during feline calicivirus infection, where virus encoded proteases cleave eukaryotic initiation factor, eIF4G, and inhibits host protein synthesis [55] . Additionally, it has been shown that MRV infection, results in the inhibition of host protein synthesis. This inhibition is a stress response that is initiated by the cell through the recognition of dsRNA with dsRNA kinase, PKR, resulting in the phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor, eIF2\u03b1 [56] . The phosphorylation limits the formation of the ternary complex eIF2/GTP/tRNAi met that binds with the 40S ribosomal subunit to initiate translation. This in turn results in the cytoplasmic aggregation of cellular mRNAs and translation factors termed stress granules [57] . The stress granules hold mRNAs in a translationally inactive state until the removal of the stressor and recovery of the cell, where the mRNA is again translated [58] . Although this response serves to inhibit virus replication, MRV is able to escape the halt in protein expression by disrupting the stress granules [59] . This strategy allows the translation of viral but not cellular mRNA. In addition, the MRV \u03c33 protein can interact directly with PKR, preventing its activation and subsequent phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 and in this case, both cellular and viral translation proceeds [59] [60] [61] .",

            "text": "For a fusogenic virus, one of the hallmarks of NBV infection within permissive cell types is virus mediated cell-cell fusion, or syncytia. Syncytia formation from NBV infection is caused by the p10 protein [14] . As a non-structural protein, p10 is produced during infection and transported to the cell surface mediating fusion between neighbouring cells. Within the present study we detected p10 transcripts and peptides in the PaKiT03 cells, but not L929 cells, at 24 hpi. Interestingly, in line with the significant cell-cell fusion observed in the PaKiT03 cells, we observed a down-regulation of genes involved in cell-cell adherence and junctions. In a normal healthy cell, claudin and cadherin proteins, act to maintain tight cell-cell junctions/organisation [62] . The loss of cell-cell junctions and the formation of multi-nucleated syncytia seen in NBV infected cells, may be directly related to the down-regulation of these genes. The importance of cell-cell fusion and syncytia formation in promoting NBV replication remains unclear. In avian reovirus replication it has been shown that syncytia formation is not an essential step but it enhances the virus induced CPE and the release of virus progeny [63] . We have also shown previously with a low cell density infection with NBV, in an environment not favourable for syncytia formation, replication and syncytia still occurred but at a reduced rate [12] . It therefore seems plausible that intervention strategies which aim to inhibit the fusogenic activity of NBV, through directly targeting p10 or restoring cell-cell organisation, could reduce NBV replication.",

The effect on syncytia formation of IFITMs has been demonstrated in HIV infection previously.Here, transfected cells expressing IFITM proteins significantly inhibited HIV spread and syncytia formation by antagonising the virus envelope protein [65] . Interference of membrane fusion affects virus entry and has been demonstrated against a range of viruses including Marburg virus, Ebola virus, SARS-CoV and Influenza A virus [66] . The IFITM proteins have also been shown to restrict infectivity and replication of reoviruses, the only known group of non-enveloped viruses to be affected. Although the exact mechanism of action of IFITMs during the replication of reoviruses is unclear, studies on Ifitm3 proposes that it acts on endosomes that are utilised by the virus during either entry or replication [67] .",
