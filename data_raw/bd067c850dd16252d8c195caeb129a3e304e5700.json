Our findings showed that PT-1 exhibited highly potent effects against a diverse group of HIV type 1 (HIV-1) strains and displayed low cytotoxicity and genotoxicity. The time-addition assay revealed that PT-1 acted at an early stage of infection, and these findings were supported by the observation that PT-1 had more potency against Env-pseudotyped virus than vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSVG) pseudotyped virus. Surface plasmon resonance binding assays and flow cytometry analysis showed that PT-1 blocked the gp120 binding site in the CD4 receptor. Moreover, PT-1 bound directly to gp41 NHR (N36 peptide), thereby interrupting the core bundle formation of gp41. In conclusion, our data suggested that PT-1 may be developed as a new anti-HIV-1 agent through its effects on entry inhibition.",

It has infected more than 36 million people worldwide by the end of 2015, according to the United Nations Joint Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) reports. Significant success has been achieved in HIV-1 treatment since the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in the 1990s [1] . Current antiretroviral therapy, with three to four anti-HIV-1 drugs used in combination, targets multiple steps in the HIV-1 life cycle, including the viral reverse transcriptase, integrase, protease, viral entry, and fusion. Viral entry and fusion inhibitors are some of the most attractive agents in HIV-1 therapy [2] . In the last several decades, great progress has been made in the understanding of the mechanisms of HIV-1 entry into host cells. It involves the binding of viral glycoprotein gp120 to the cellular CD4 receptor, and subsequent reconfiguration of gp120 to allow the interaction of gp120 and a cellular coreceptor, i.e., CCR5 or CXCR4. The interaction was followed by additional conformational changes in the viral envelope, resulting in exposure of gp41 transmembrane protein and ultimately driving the fusion of the viral envelope with the host membrane [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . To date, the CCR5 antagonists maraviroc (MVC) and the fusion inhibitor targeting gp41, T20 (enfuvirtide) have been approved for clinical use, and many other inhibitors targeting various stages of viral entry are still in development [9, 10] .",

Mice were administrated intragastrically with PT-1/normal saline or intraperitoneally with CP once a day for three days. Mice were sacrificed 48 h post the last administration, then the bilateral femur was separated, bone marrow cells were collected from the aforementioned femur in fetal bovine serum, centrifuged at 1000\u00d7 g for 5 min, and smeared onto slides. Slides were air-dried and fixed by submerging in methanol for 15 min, followed by Giemsa staining for 15 min. Slides were then randomly coded and counted under \u00d71000 magnification. Data were expressed as the ratio of immature erythrocytes (polychromatic erythrocytes, PCE) to total erythrocytes (PCE + normochromatic erythrocytes, NCE) by counting at least 200 erythrocytes and the number of micronucleated (MN) PCE in 1000 PCEs.

In MT4 cells, the replication of the wide-type virus was significantly inhibited by PT-1 at IC50 ranging from 0.47 to 1.56 \u00b5M. To confirm the inhibition in primary T cells, PT-1 was tested using HIV-1 NL4-3 and PBMCs from three healthy donors, respectively.

In addition to its remarkable high potency, PT-1 showed low cytotoxicity in TZM-bl, MT4 cells and PBMCs, even at a concentration that was 100-fold higher than the effective dose ( Figure 1C and Table 1 ). No significant changes in the percentage of early and late apoptotic cells were seen in PBMCs and MT4 cells after PT-1 treatment ( Figure 1D and Figure S1 ). Furthermore, the genotoxic effect of PT-1 was monitored using mouse bone marrow micronucleus tests ( Figure 1E , Table S2 ), and the data showed that PT-1 at doses up to 1800 mg/kg resulted in no mortality and bone marrow toxicity.

We noted that pre-incubation of CD4 with PT-1 caused a substantial reduction in the binding signal, whereas PT-1 did not bind directly to gp120 itself, suggesting that PT-1 competed with gp120 for binding to CD4 ( Figure 3A ). We then analyzed the binding of PT-1 to CD4 recombinant protein using a direct binding assay, where CD4 protein was immobilized on a CM5 chip, and PT-1 was run in a serial of dilutions. The average K D value for the PT-1-CD4 interaction was 1.58 \u00b5M using a 1:1 langmuir binding model ( Figure 3B ). To further elucidate the binding ability of PT-1 to the natural CD4 receptor, we co-incubated PT-1 with MT4 cells and stained the cells with anti-CD4 RPA-T4 antibodies, which bind to the D1 domain (gp120 binding domain) of CD4. FACS analysis revealed that PT-1 suppressed the fluorescence intensity in a concentration-dependent manner ( Figure 3C) ., In addition, PT-1 incubation did not induce IL-2 secretion ( Figure S3 ), suggesting that PT-1 may interfere with the gp120 binding site on the CD4 receptor without activating CD4 T cells. We also compared the effects of PT-1 on CCR5-(YU2) and CXCR4-(NL4-3) utilizing strains; however, no differences were observed. PT-1 also did not inhibit the binding of specific anti-CXCR4 and anti-CCR5 monoclonal antibodies to MT4 cells (data now shown), suggesting that PT-1 did not interact with any of the co-receptors.

PT-1 also did not inhibit the binding of specific anti-CXCR4 and anti-CCR5 monoclonal antibodies to MT4 cells (data now shown), suggesting that PT-1 did not interact with any of the co-receptors. We also performed native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (N-PAGE) to detect the effects of PT-1 on gp41 6-HB formation, as shown by N-PAGE ( Figure 4B ,C). N36 alone showed no bands because of the net positive charge, whereas C34 alone showed a clear band at a low position in the gel (Lane 1). When N36 was mixed with C34, a new band corresponding to the 6-HB formed by N36 and C34 appeared at the higher position (Lane 2). After incubation with PT-1, the density of the 6-HB band was weakened, and recovery of the C34 band was observed (Lanes 4-6). In addition, AZT did not reduce 6-HB formation (Lane 3). These data indicated that PT-1 affected the functional conformation of 6-HB. Similarly, PT-1 showed clear concentration-dependent binding affinity with the N36 peptide in SPR assays, with PT-1 bound to immobilized N36 showing an average K D of 42.8 nM ( Figure 4A ). Taken together, these data revealed that PT-1 inhibited HIV-1 Env-mediated entry by blocking the gp120 binding site of the CD4 receptor and interacting with the viral gp41 NHR. and C34 appeared at the higher position (Lane 2).

HPA-23, known as antimonium tungstate, was one of the first-generation POM and the only one of all studied POMs so far that progressed to clinical trials. However, it caused adverse effects on the hepatic and renal functions [36] . POMs still suffer from the stigma of this failure, although new generations of POMs including Keggin structures, have been synthesized with less toxicity and greater efficacy, most studies have focused on cancer therapy [37, 38] , and very few studies have been conducted to investigate the anti-HIV potential in the past decade [39] . The mechanism of action has remained unclear. In the present work, we evaluated the potency and mechanism of action of a Keggin POM, PT-1 (K 6 HPTi 2 W 10 O 40 ) in preventing HIV-1 entry and replication. We demonstrated that PT-1 inhibited replication of multiple virus strains with IC 50 values in the nanomolar range. In addition to its remarkable high potency, it revealed low cytotoxicity and genotoxicity. The high therapeutic index (TI) makes PT-1 a good candidate for HIV-1 treatment.",

Previous studies have demonstrated that POMs could block the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) or protease [19, 40] . Thus, we conducted the assay to test the inhibition on RT, protease, and integrase. PT-1 exhibited a certain degree of inhibition on RT and integrase, but not protease. We also observed that the RT inhibition percentage was not comparable to the HIV-1 inhibition percentage, indicating that the anti-HIV-1 activity was not fully mediated via inhibition of RT or integrase activity. To learn more about which steps of the HIV-1 cycle were targeted by PT-1, we conducted a time-drug-addition assay to have a thorough investigation of possible targets of the HIV-1 life-cycle. By adding PT-1 at different time points, we showed that PT-1 exhibited inhibition at a very early step of virus replication. Moreover, PT-1 specifically interacted with the HIV-1 envelope and not with VSV-G, thus the viral entry process might be the most likely antiviral target of PT-1.",

            "text": "The HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins, composed of gp120 and gp41, are responsible for virus binding and membrane fusion. The first step in the HIV-1 entry into the host cells involves the binding of the gp120 envelope glycoprotein to the CD4 on the target cell membrane. Previous studies revealed that POMs were effective in blocking viral absorption by interacting with the gp120 glycoprotein [41] . In our assays, PT-1 did not directly bind to gp120 in the SPR assay, however, it competed with CD4 for binding to gp120. The CD4 receptor is a monomeric protein composed of four immunoglobulin (Ig)-like extracellular domains (D1-D4). Numerous mutagenesis tests indicated that the D1 domain (complementarity-determining region (CDR2, region 21-64) is critical for gp120 binding and can be blocked by anti-CD4 antibody [42, 43] . We thus used anti-CD4 RPA-T4 antibody (binds to D1 domain) to analyze the interaction of PT-1 and CD4 on the cell membrane. The FACS analysis confirmed the direct binding of PT-1 to the D1 domain of the CD4 receptor. When gp120 interacted with CD4 and co-receptor CXCR4 or CCR5, the gp41 transmembrane subunit experiences conformational changes, and the N-terminal heptad repeats (NHR) of gp41 associate with the C-terminal heptad repeat (CHR) to form a thermostable, six-helix bundle (6-HB) core. The NHR and CHR domains are critical for the membrane fusion. NHR and CHR derived protein, such as N36 and C34, blocked gp41 core formation by interacting with CHR and NHR, respectively, and served as important targets for HIV fusion inhibitors [44] . In our study, PT-1 interfered with gp41 formation by binding to an NHR peptide. The K D value of PT-1 binding to N36 was close to the IC 50 obtained in the cell-based assay, suggesting that PT-1 inhibited HIV-1 entry by interfering with NHR and disrupting gp41 six helix bundle formation.",

            "text": "The current antiretroviral therapy is a combination of three or more antiretroviral drugs that target different steps of HIV-1 life cycle. Despite the fact that it reduces the viral load to an undetectable level and has greatly improved survival rates and life quality of HIV-infected patients, it still faces challenges including long-term drug resistance, unwanted drug-drug interactions and low compliance of patients. Thus, the discovery of multifunctional agents that interact simultaneously with more than one target has proven effective in anti-HIV leads discovery. For instance, inducible T cell kinase (ITK) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors blocked multi-steps of HIV replication, including viral entry, reverse transcription, integration, and viral particle production [45, 46] . Many plant-derived polyphenols such as quercetin, isoflavones, flavanones and phenolic acid derivatives, showed activity against various viral enzyme targets simultaneously [47] . Importantly, HIV protease inhibitors were found not only affecting virion release, but also blocking viral entry, reverse transcription and post-reverse transcription [48] . In the present study, we have identified the multi-target profile of PT-1, which not only blocked viral entry, but also interfered with main HIV enzymes reverse transcriptase and integrase In addition, POMs could be easily modified by various chemical reactions to enhance the specificity or activity, and they are less expensive than organic agents. We synthesized a serial of POMs derivatives by decorating PT-1 with amino acid to improve biocompatibility, and the modifications did not affect anti-viral activity. Thus, PT-1 has shown some promising properties for drug development. It is also important to note that the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics profile of most metal-based compounds have yet to be identified and warrant further investigation.",
