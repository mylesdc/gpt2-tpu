            "text": "Polyamines are small positively-charged molecules abundant in eukaryotic cells that are crucial to RNA virus replication. In eukaryotic cells, polyamines facilitate processes such as transcription, translation, and DNA replication, and viruses similarly rely on polyamines to facilitate transcription and translation. Whether polyamines function at additional stages in viral replication remains poorly understood. Picornaviruses, including Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3), are sensitive to polyamine depletion both in vitro and in vivo; however, precisely how polyamine function in picornavirus infection has not been described. Here, we describe CVB3 mutants that arise with passage in polyamine-depleted conditions. We observe mutations in the 2A and 3C proteases, and we find that these mutant proteases confer resistance to polyamine depletion. Using a split luciferase reporter system to measure protease activity, we determined that polyamines facilitate viral protease activity. We further observe that the 2A and 3C protease mutations enhance reporter protease activity in polyamine-depleted conditions. Finally, we find that these mutations promote cleavage of cellular eIF4G during infection of polyamine-depleted cells. In sum, our results suggest that polyamines are crucial to protease function during picornavirus infection. Further, these data highlight viral proteases as potential antiviral targets and highlight how CVB3 may overcome polyamine-depleting antiviral therapies. Viral proteases play many roles during infection, and picornaviruses encode two distinct proteases: 2A (2A pro ) and 3C (3C pro ). The 2A and 3C picornaviral proteases function to cleave both host and viral proteins. 3C is responsible for the majority of viral polyprotein cleavage. Importantly, 3C also functions as part of 3CD (a polyprotein consisting of the 3C protease and 3D polymerase) and acts as a protease in this context as well [11] . To date, reports demonstrated that 2A facilitates the cleavage between the P1 and P2 protein segments [12] . The precise regulation of these proteases, their activities, and their overlapping and unique functions remains to be fully understood. However, due to their copious functions during infection, they represent potential drug targets [13] [14] [15] .",

Difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), which inhibits polyamine biosynthesis, has received attention as an anti-trypanosomal molecule and is well-tolerated in patients [22, 23] .

We isolated two distinct viral mutants in the 2A and 3C proteases. We determined that these mutant viruses were resistant to polyamine depletion and that these mutations conferred no fitness advantage in the absence of polyamine depletion. To investigate the proteolytic activity of these enzymes, we developed a protease-dependent split-luciferase reporter system to measure 2A and 3C activity. Using this assay, we observed that 2A and 3C activity was diminished with polyamine depletion, to which mutant 2A and 3C proteases were resistant. Additionally, we observed that viruses containing these mutants were able to cleave cellular targets efficiently in polyamine-depleted cells.

CVB3 commonly infects children, resulting in a self-limiting illness that can lead to the development of muscle, lung, and heart maladies. Importantly, CVB3 infection can lead to myocarditis and endocarditis, and the virus is able to persist in cardiac tissue [1, 2] . Currently, no antivirals are available for treating or preventing CVB3 infection; thus, the identification of novel antiviral targets is crucial to controlling infection. Viral proteases, including enteroviral proteases, play crucial roles in the replication of RNA viruses [3] . Following virus entry, picornavirus RNA is directly translated via host ribosomes into a polyprotein, containing both structural and nonstructural proteins. This large protein is subsequently cleaved to generate functionally distinct viral proteins. Importantly, the ability of viral proteases to cleave the viral polyprotein is essential for productive infection, as limiting viral protease activity significantly hinders virus infection. Modulation of protease activity, however, can also alter antiviral susceptibility [4] . Additionally, viral proteins cleave several host proteins, including translation factors, immune effectors, and signaling molecules [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] , to establish a proviral environment. ",

As shown in Figure 2A , the wildtype and mutant viruses replicate with similar kinetics. To ascertain whether these viruses produced similar levels of infectious particles, we measured the ratio of viral genomes to infectious virus. Vero cells were infected with the wildtype or protease mutant viruses for 48 h, and subsequently, viral titers ( Figure 3A ) were determined by plaque assay and RNA was processed from infected cellular supernatant. The number of viral genomes was quantified by qRT-PCR ( Figure 3B) , and the ratio of genomes to infectious virus (pfu) calculated ( Figure 3C ). We observed no changes in viral titers in polyamine-sufficient conditions, and viral genomes were slightly elevated, though not statistically significant, in 2A 29K and 3C 52R mutant viruses ( Figure 3B) . Overall, the genome-to-pfu ratio was not statistically significantly different among our protease mutant viruses.",

To determine whether our CVB3 mutants had fitness enhancement manifesting as a more rapidly replicating virus, we measured virus plaque sizes of wildtype and protease mutant virus. We observed no significant difference between wildtype and mutant CVB3 plaque size ( Figure 3D ). To better measure viral fitness via competition assay, we infected Vero cells with equal quantities of infectious virus of wildtype and 2A 29K or 3C 52R , and after five passages, we extracted RNA, reverse transcribed, amplified viral genomes by PCR, and Sanger sequenced the appropriate genomic locus corresponding to each protease (Table 1) . After the fifth passage, we observed that the wildtype and either protease mutant virus existed as a mixed population, with peaks corresponding to the wildtype and mutant nucleotide present in the samples ( Figure 3E , representative of three independent passages). Additionally, we passaged mutant virus without competition to determine the stability of the mutant. We observed that the mutation was maintained after five passages, suggesting that there is no fitness cost to this mutation in our cell culture conditions. Altogether, our data suggest that protease-mutant CVB3 exhibits no significant replicative advantage compared to wildtype CVB3. ",

To this end, we treated Veros with 500 \u00b5M DFMO or left cells untreated and then infected at MOI 10 for 24 h. Cellular lysates were collected and analyzed for cleavage of eIF4G ( Figure 4C ). In untreated cells, we observed significant cleavage of eIF4G with wildtype infection that was not enhanced with infection of CVB3-2A 29K , -3C 52R , or double protease mutant. However, with DFMO treatment, eIF4G cleavage was significantly reduced in wildtype CVB3 infection, as previously observed ( Figure 4A ). When we analyzed DFMO-treated cells that were infected with protease mutant CVB3, we observed proteolytic cleavage of eIF4G, significantly higher than wildtype CVB3. In total, our data suggest that polyamine depletion significantly reduces CVB3 protease activity and that the mutant proteases derived from our passages exhibit a rescue in this sensitivity. ",

By isolating DFMO escape mutants, we can glean insight into the mechanisms by which polyamines function in virus infection. Here, we have isolated two protease mutants following passage of CVB3 in DFMO. We previously characterized escape mutants for chikungunya virus and found three mutations that conferred resistance when simultaneously present in the virus [31] . In contrast, we find that CVB3 gains resistance to DFMO with a single mutation in either protease. From our data, we cannot determine whether polyamines facilitate protease activity against a specific target; however, we observe that both viral proteases maintain activity in polyamine-depleted cells with either of these mutations and that these mutations facilitate virus infection in an otherwise antiviral environment. Determining the specificity of this activity is an area of important future investigation.",

Interestingly, we have observed such amino acid changes in our CHIKV passages [31] , in which we observed a glycine-to-arginine mutation in nsP1. Given that polyamines are positively-charged at physiological pH, the emergence of positively-charged amino acids in polyamine-depleted conditions suggests potential amino acid compensation for a loss of charge. The amino acids in which we observe mutations for CVB3 2A and 3C are not located in the active sites of either enzyme [27, 38] , suggesting that these amino acids and their associated charge may alter enzymatic activity allosterically.

For instance, spermidine interacts with and activates the activity of mammalian chymotrypsin [32, 33] .

We previously described how DFMO reduces CVB3 replication in vitro and in vivo [25] . Here, we show that CVB3 gains resistance to DFMO-mediated polyamine depletion via two distinct and independent mutations. Such emergence of resistance highlights that polyamine depletion as a monotherapy may not be sufficient to quell virus replication. As viruses rapidly mutate and gain resistance to antivirals, potential therapy that includes polyamine depletion would necessitate combination therapy to prevent resistance. Neither protease mutant exhibited an enhanced fitness phenotype, as we had observed with CHIKV mutants [31] , suggesting that even if this virus were to emerge, the mutation may not fix in a viral population not exposed to DFMO.",
