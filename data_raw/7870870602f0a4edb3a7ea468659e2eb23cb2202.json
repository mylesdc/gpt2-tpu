In this study, we determined the ability of AcNPV-LC3 to protect against ALA by the intramuscular route as well as the liver immune response associated with protection. Results showed that 55% of hamsters IM immunized with AcNPV-LC3 showed sterile protection against ALA, whereas other 20% showed reduction in the size and extent of abscesses, resulting in some protection in 75% of animals compared to the sham control group. Levels of protection showed a linear correlation with the development and intensity of specific antiamoeba cellular and humoral responses, evaluated in serum and spleen of hamsters, respectively. Evaluation of the Th1/Th2 cytokine patterns expressed in the liver of hamsters showed that sterile protection was associated with the production of high levels of IFN and IL-4. These results suggest that the baculovirus system is equally efficient by the intramuscular as well as the oral routes for ALA protection and that the Gal-lectin LC3 fragment is a highly protective antigen against hepatic amoebiasis through the local induction of IFN and IL-4.",

This is a protein complex of three subunits that are preferably located at the surface of the parasite and whose main component, the heavy subunit of 170 kDa, is also one of the most immunogenic E. histolytica molecules [6] . Along with other proteins, such as the family of serine-rich proteins [7] and the 29 kDa cysteine-rich Alkyl hydroperoxide reductase [8] , the Gal-lectin is considered as one of the main targets for an effective vaccine against amoebiasis. The gal-lectin, with its cysteine-rich portion of the 170 kDa lectin subunit, is the target for serum of 95% of patients with amoebic liver abscess [9] as well as IgG and IgA anti-Gal-lectin antibodies recovered from serum and feces of patients with intestinal amoebiasis, respectively [10, 11] . Oral or nasal immunization of mice, gerbils, and nonhuman primates with the cystein-rich section of galactose-inhibitable lectin LC3 and cholera toxin as adjuvant induced high level of specific serum IgG and fecal IgA [12, 13] antibodies that inhibit in vitro E. histolytica adherence to CHO cells [14] . Moreover, intraperitoneal immunization of gerbils with the LC3 fragment with Titermax adjuvant elicited IgG antibodies that conferred 71% of protection against ALA [15] . Recently, it was demonstrated that LC3 is one of the main targets of antibodies elicited by natural infection of female baboons with E. histolytica [16] . Thus, 73% and 46% of such animals showed serum anti-LC3 IgG and IgA antibodies, respectively, and 49% exhibited fecal anti-LC3 secretory IgA antibodies. Noteworthy, the specificity of recognition of epitopes in LC3 and the native Gal-lectin by the infected baboons was similar to the specificity of recognition of human asymptomatic subjects and ALA patients [16] .",

            "text": "Although promising results have been obtained in protection assays against amoebiasis using various experimental models such as mice, hamsters, and gerbils, the use of these strategies to protect humans in the future is hampered by the use of adjuvants that are potentially toxic and proinflammatory to mammals, such as bacterial toxins or oil-based adjuvants. In a previous report, we proposed the use of viral vectors such as the baculovirus as a strategy for the delivery of amoebic antigens in studies of protection [17] . Baculoviruses are insect viruses capable of infecting mammalian cells, but not of replicating in them. The most promising is Autographa californica, an envelope and double-stranded DNA nucleopolyhedrovirus that can drive the expression of foreign genes in mammalian cells without causing cytotoxic effects [18] . This virus has the ability to transduce a wide range of mammalian cells, including liver and kidney cells, and therefore it has been proposed as a delivery vector for human gene therapy, mainly as oncolytic agent. In this sense, A. californica has been proposed as a tool for targeting and transferring therapeutic genes into carcinoma cells from patients with prostate [19] , colorectal [20] , and lung [21] cancer as well as ameliorating the collateral ischaemia in organ transplantation [22] . Noteworthy, from 27 nonhuman virus species that are in preclinical studies, A. californica was classified in the category of \"negligible\" regarding the relative environmental risk [18] , suggesting that its use in human for any medical purpose, including gene therapy and vaccines, is safe. As vaccine delivery strategy, the baculovirus A. californica has the advantage of priming the immune response by itself, innate and adaptive as well as humoral and cellular [23] , preventing the need for adjuvants with potential adverse effects such as bacterial toxins and oil-based formula. Thus, baculovirus displaying target antigens on their surface and/or driving the expression of them under the control of a cytomegalovirus promoter has been highly efficient in inducing immune responses that confer protection against viral and parasitic infections in experimental models [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] .",

Although the protection was associated with the development of an antiamoebic cellular immune response measured in spleen, the underlying cytokines and cell populations responsible were not identified. Herein, we complement the previous study by evaluating the potential of an intramuscular immunization with the AcNPV/CMV/Gal-lectin LC3 system for conferring protection against ALA in hamsters, determining whether this route of immunization confer a greater level protection than the mucosal delivery and evaluating in the liver the locally produced cytokines and cell populations responsible for protection.",

The results showed high levels of ALT, about three times above the reference value, in the serum of nonimmunized and infected animals (sham group), which correlates with an increase of more than twice the weight of the liver as a result of abscesses (Table 1) . By contrast, the liver weight and ALT levels in the serum of immunized animals correlated with the degree of protection, being these normal values in hamsters fully protected (ALT < 87 U/L and liver around 6 g) and intermediate in animals showing partial protection (Table 1) .",

Moreover, the sterile protection levels obtained by both routes were also similar (55% oral versus 58% intramuscular). This result was unexpected because being ALA a systemic type infection, it was more probably that the intramuscular route of immunization had higher efficiency to induce a systemic protective response than the oral route. Therefore, this supports the proposal by our group and others that the oral route may be the appropriate to administer a vaccine against amoebiasis in general, because, in addition to the classic advantages of this route as its manageability, noninvasion, and no needs for specialized personnel, oral route triggers local and systemic immune responses that in addition to conferring protection against intestinal amoebiasis, may also protect against the development of liver abscesses if trophozoites manage to pass from the intestine to the liver. This is noteworthy as extraintestinal amoebiasis, and in particular, ALA is considered the main cause of human death by E. histolytica [37] . The effectiveness of the Gal-lectin as vaccine against amoebiasis has been extensively studied [5] . Recently, a new model of intestinal infection with E. histolytica in baboons (Papio sp) and the efficacy of nasal vaccination against amoebic colitis using a Gal-lectin synthetic peptide was reported [38] . Notably, a vaccination schedule of four doses of 1600 g peptide/nostril in combination with cholera toxin as adjuvant once a week was able to eradicate amoebic infection in all baboons by the 51st day after intracecal challenge with trophozoites. Moreover, serum IgG and IgA antibodies induced by natural infection of baboons with E. histolytica are directed to epitopes present in the LC3 fragment of the Gal-lectin, and this immunodominance is shared with humans carrying asymptomatic E. histolytica infection or recently cured of ALA [14] . These results, together with the obtained by our group, previously and reported here, using recombinant baculoviruses driving the expression of the LC3 fragment [17] as well as other protection assays using LC3 as immunogen [15] , highly support that Gal-lectin, in particular its LC3 fragment, is the target of protective antibodies and cellular immune responses resolving intraand extraintestinal amoebiasis, and, therefore, it should be the basic component of an effective vaccine against human amoebiasis.",

            "text": "The immune elements responsible for protection against intestinal amebiasis or ALA are not entirely known. In this study, we found an association of sterile protection against ALA with the local production of high levels of IFN , a cytokine of Th1 profile. This result is in agreement with previous studies where protection against ALA in hamsters correlated with the production of the same cytokine in protective assays using the EhCPADH surface complex as immunogen [39] . In addition, relevance of IFN as playing a role in the innate immunity against ALA came from studies in SCID mice with targeted disruption of the IFN receptor gene [40] . Moreover, T cell derived IFN and IL-17 were also essential for protection against intestinal amoebiasis in a murine model vaccinated with recombinant LecA fragment of the Gal-lectin, determined by adoptive T cell transfer and IFN /Il-17 neutralizing assays [41, 42] . The source of the protective IFN in our assays is unknown, but it could be from T cells responding specifically to the amoeba antigen as observed in the cell proliferation assays, in which the best protected animals showed higher response to the amoeba extract. However, NKTs cells as source of the early production of IFN in the liver during the ALA are also well known [43] . In this regard, interestingly, the wild-type baculovirus was able to confer up to 25% protection by itself, which was also associated with local production of high levels of IFN , suggesting that activation of the innate immune response by the baculovirus, probably IFN from local NKT cells, is partly responsible for the observed protection. Thus, it has been demonstrated that baculovirus recognition by TL9 leads to the production of various cytokines that triggers innate immunity, including IFN [23] , which in turn has the potential to confer high levels of protection in several experimental models, such as influenza where intranasal immunization with a wild-type baculovirus protected 100% of mice from a lethal challenge [44] .",

Although the production of IL-4 has been associated with susceptibility to intestinal infection by amoeba [45] , a previous study by our group using lactoferrin as an oral therapy for the treatment of intestinal amebiasis in C3H/HeJ mice showed production of this cytokine in tissue of ceca from animal cured [46] . As we suggest in such paper, it is likely that the production of IL-4 is the result of a feedback mechanism for controlling excessive inflammation (a typical feature of the intestinal mouse and liver hamster amoebiasis), restoring the physiological antiinflammatory state that predominates in both intestine and liver. IL-4 also augments fibroblast growth and collagen production during granulomas formation, a characteristic mark of the chronic development of ALA [47] , a reaction trying to contain the infection. Thus, it is possible that the role of IL-4 depends on whether liver abscesses develop or not, so contributing to the formation of granulomas at later stages if ALA develops or decreasing excessive inflammation at earlier stages.",

            "text": "Protection against ALA in hamsters was also associated with the induction of serum anti-amoebic antibodies, particularly IgG (Figure 2 ). This is consistent with a variety of previous studies demonstrating that antibodies are important in protection against amoeba, particularly secretory IgA against intestinal amebiasis, and serum IgG and IgA against hepatic amoebiasis [48, 49] . It is possible that the high levels of IFN observed in protected hamsters have also contributed to the increased production of IgG antibodies mentioned, mainly IgG2a isotype (Th1 response), linking the two arms of the immune response in the liver infection by E. histolytica. Taken together, the results suggest that both responses, cellular and humoral anti-LC3 fragment of the Gal-lectin, are important for the development of resistance in hamsters against ALA.",

            "text": "Immunization in humans has always faced with the difficulty of identifying safe adjuvants that do not generate unwanted side effects. Most protection assays against intestinal and/or liver amoebiasis described above used toxins derived from bacteria or mineral or vegetable oils suspensions, which although inducing a good immune response also usually generate local or systemic inflammatory responses that can have implications for the health of the vaccinated subject [50] . In this work, we reinforce the probability of using recombinant baculovirus system as an alternative approach to the use of toxic adjuvants for the safe release of amoeba antigens into mammals, due to its per se capacity of stimulating the innate immune response, and, thus, conditioning the generation of a specific antiamoeba adaptive immune response. In this sense, many studies demonstrating the phenotypic and functional maturation of dendritic cells and macrophages as well as direct activation of B cells induced by AcNPV, resulting in antigen presentation and Th1 responses, have been reported [51, 52] . Noteworthy, the acceptability for using baculovirus in humans has been recently increased with ongoing trials of gene therapy based on the use of such viruses as delivery system [53] , which lays the foundation for safe and extended use of recombinant baculovirus systems in other areas such as vaccines [54] .",
