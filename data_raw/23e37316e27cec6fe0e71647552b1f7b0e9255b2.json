            "text": "Antibody repertoires for library construction are conventionally harvested from mRNAs of immune cells. To examine whether germline rearranged immunoglobulin (Ig) variable region genes could be used as source of antibody repertoire, an immunized phage-displayed scFv library was prepared using splenocytic genomic DNA as template. In addition, a novel frame-shifting PCR (fsPCR) step was introduced to rescue stop codon and to enhance diversity of the complementaritydetermining region 3 (CDR3). The germline scFv library was initially characterized against the hapten antigen phenyloxazolone (phOx). Sequence analysis of the phOx-selective scFvs indicated that the CDRs consisted of novel as well as conserved motifs. In order to illustrate that the diversity of CDR3 was increased by the fsPCR step, a second scFv library was constructed using a single scFv clone L3G7C as a template. Despite showing similar binding characteristics towards phOx, the scFv clones that were obtained from the L3G7C-derived antibody library gave a lower non-specific binding than that of the parental L3G7C clone. To determine whether germline library represented the endogenous immune status, specific scFv clones for nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-associated coronavirus (SCoV) were obtained both from na\u00efve and immunized germline scFv libraries. Both libraries yielded specific anti-N scFvs that exhibited similar binding characteristics towards recombinant N protein, except the immunized library gave a larger number of specific anti-N scFv, and clones with identical nucleotide sequences were found. In conclusion, highly diversified antibody library can be efficiently constructed using germline rearranged immunoglobulin variable genes as source of antibody repertoires and fsPCR to diversify the CDR3.",

Potential Ig genes may not be recovered from antibody cDNA library due to reading frame shifted or the presence of stop codon(s) which are generated by imprecise somatic recombination and P-and N-additions [15, 16] ; or the immunoglobulins are self-reactive and thus eliminated by the host immune system [17, 18] . Besides, like other somatic cells, B cells are diploid and therefore rearranged Ig genes can only be expressed from one of the sister chromosomes while the other is concealed [18, 19] . In addition, chance of getting Ig genes against poor immunogenic targets is hampered by poor humoral response of immunized host. On the other hand, activated B cells undergo clonal expansion and therefore the antibody repertoires of a cDNA-derived scFv library would be dominated by antigenstimulated humoral response. Hence recombinant antibody repertoires of a cDNA-derived antibody library are limited.",

Essentially, the frameshifting reverse primers (RFSH for V H and RFSK for V Lk ) are composed of two portions. In the 59-portion of the frame-shifting reverse primer is a 59-degenerate sequence of J gene-segments while the 39-portion is a random hexamer. We reasoned that the 59-degenerate J gene sequence would bring the frame-shifting reverse primer close to the CDR3-J region of the Ig templates while the 39-random hexamer would imperfectly anneal to the CDR3 ( Figure 2A) . As for the low sequence similarity and the sequence heterogeneity of 39-random hexamer, annealing between templates and the frame-shifting reverses primer would not be precise and resulted in generating a library of immunoglobulin chains with different CDR3 nucleotide sequences. Indeed, as illustrated in Figure 2B , fsPCR generated DNA fragments that To analyze the nucleotide diversity in CDR3, PCR products of fsPCR were gel-purified, subcloned and sequenced. Multiple sequence alignment of the derived V H and V Lk sequences indicated a significant sequence variation within the CDR3 among various clones. It is of interest to note that sequence variation occurred mainly at the 39-end of CDR3 which the random hexamer portion of the degenerate reverse primer was predicted to anneal to during fsPCR ( Figure 3 ).",

After 5 rounds of panning, 288 clones were randomly picked. Specificity of candidate scFvphages was assessed using phageELISA against phOx-BSA conjugate, and 15 phOx-BSA binders were identified from which 5 high binding clones were selected for further characterization including L3B8C, L3B10B, L3E4C, L3G7C and L3H11A ( Table   Figure 3 . Multiple alignments of frame-shifted germline-derived V H and V Lk genes. After fsPCR, the PCR products were cloned into TOPO TA cloning vector. Following nucleotide sequence determination, clones were aligned using ClustalWH. Significant sequence variations of heavy (A) and k light (B) chains were noted in the CDR3. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0027406.g003 S2). The phOx-selective phage clones bound phOx-BSA in a concentration-dependent manner ( Figure 4A ). The binding of these phage clones to phOx heptan was further confirmed by competitive phageELISA in which free phOx competed with immobilized phOx-BSA for phage binding. Phage binding towards immobilized phOx-BSA was dose-dependently suppressed by free phOx at concentrations that spread more than two log 10 scales, suggesting each phage clone exhibited distinct binding characteristics towards phOx ( Figure 4B) . Furthermore, the phage clones bound significantly higher to phOx-BSA than to other irrelevant immobilized antigens including BSA, insulin, thyroglobulin, angiotensin II (Ang II), LPS and ssDNA ( Figure 4C ), suggesting the isolated phage clones were selective towards phOx. To compare the phOx binding pocket, putative amino acid sequences of the phOx-selective scFvs were translated, and their CDRs were identified and aligned. It is noted that some of the identified scFvs shared conserved CDR motifs with previously characterized phOx-binders in the Ig database [37, 38] , while others showed conservative amino acid substitutions (Figure 4 , panels D and E, Table S2 ).",

This result is consistent with previous reports that mouse anti-phOx IgG response is highly restricted and most antibodies are preferentially generated via the recombination of V H -Ox1 and V k -Ox1 variable gene segments [23, 37] . In comparison with the CDR3 of heavy chain, the light chain CDR3 was more conservative. This result suggests that light chain CDR3 of anti-phOx antibody may play a critical role in phOx binding. The less variability in light chain CDR3 is also in line with previous observation that in the course of affinity maturation of anti-phOx antibodies, hypermutations of amino acid residues in light chain are much concentrated in the CDR1 rather than the CDR3 [45] . It has been reported that the CDR3 of anti-phOx heavy chain consists of a sequence motif Asp-X-Gly-X-X (where X is any amino acid) [38, 46] and the length of CDR3 ranges from 4-11 amino acid residues [47] . In the present study, it is noted that majority of the heavy chain CDR3 of anti-phOx scFvs were 8-11 amino acid residues in length (Tables S2 and S6 ). The heavy chain CDR3 of L3G7C consisted of the sequence motif Asp-X-Gly-X-X, but other clones were not. These results suggest that the anti-phOx scFvs prepared from genomic DNA with fsPCR displayed similar characteristics of anti-phOx antibody derived from hybridoma or mRNA. However, by comparing the CDR3 composition, anti-phOx scFvs derived from genomic DNA with fsPCR were more heterogeneous in nature.",

(A) The specificity of anti-phOx scFv clones that derived from L3G7C was evaluated using phageELISA against different antigens, including phOx-BSA conjugate, insulin, thyroglobulin, Ang II-BSA conjugate, LPS, ssDNA as indicated. After subtraction of the background binding of M13KO7 helper phage, the binding activity of scFv clones towards different antigens was normalized against their binding towards BSA (negative control). Error bars represent SEM of three separate experiments each performed in duplicate. Difference of the means between selected clones and the parental clone (L3G7c) is evaluated by One Way ANOVA using GraphPad Prism 4. Statistical significance is indicated as *** (P,0.001); ** (P,0.01) and * (P,0.05).(B) PhageELISA analysis of phOxselective scFv-phages. ELISA plate (96-well) was pre-coated with 50 ml of phOx-BSA (1 mg/ml) overnight. Resuspended scFv-phage clones L3H11A (close square), L3A6C (close upward triangle), L3D11C (close downward triangle), L3B10B (close diamond), L3E2C (close circle), L3B5C (open square), L3E6C (open upward triangle), L3E4C (open downward triangle), and L3G7C (open circle) at the indicated concentration were added and incubated with immobilized phOx-BSA at 37uC for 1hr. Error bars represent SEM of 3-6 separate experiments each performed in duplicate. (C) Phage clones were subcloned into a pCantab His vector for adding a His 6 tag at the C-terminus of scFv and bacterial periplasmic expression. After Ni-NTA purification, expressions of scFv proteins was examined by Western protein analysis, and the protein blot was probed with an anti-His antibody. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0027406.g006",
