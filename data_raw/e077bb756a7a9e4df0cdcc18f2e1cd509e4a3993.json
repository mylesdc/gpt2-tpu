In this article we show that when population size is finite the dynamics of infection by multi-strain pathogens is a stochastic process whose outcome can be predicted by evolutionary entropy, S, an information theoretic measure which describes the uncertainty in the infectious age of an infected parent of a randomly chosen new infective. Evolutionary entropy characterises the demographic stability or robustness of the population of infectives. This statistical parameter determines the duration of infection and thus provides a quantitative index of the pathogenicity of a strain. Standard epidemiological theory based on R 0 as a measure of selective advantage is the limit as the population size tends to infinity of the entropic selection theory. The standard model is an approximation to the entropic selection theory whose validity increases with population size.",

Some of these have their origins in animal (wild or domesticated) reservoirs [2] [3] [4] , and the years since 2003 have witnessed the appearance of SARS [5, 6] and swine flu [7] . The 20 th century saw, for example, the emergence of pandemic 'flu in 1918, 1957 and 1968 (with a limited H1N1 re-emergent outbreak in 1977) [8] , avian 'flu [9] and the rise of HIV in the 1980's [10, 11] . Additionally, antibiotic-resistant pathogens have become increasingly widespread in the past decade, particularly in healthcare settings [12] . Antigenically-variable pathogens are responsible for much of the burden of communicable disease in the world today. Therefore, developing an understanding of the factors that lead to the emergence and spread of novel pathogenic agents and strains is a topic of great interest. In recent months the emergence of a swine 'flu (H1N1 2009) with human-to-human transmission capability has re-focussed attention on this issue [7, 13] . Likewise, studies, such of those of Creanza et al. [14] who used a computational analysis of viral nucleotide and amino acid sequence data collected during seasonal 'flu epidemics show how diversity declines over the course of an epidemic. These observations underscore the role that ecological constraint play in the evolution of pathogens.",

Diseases in this category include influenza A virus, meningococcal and pneumococcal bacterial infection, malaria and dengue fever, to name but a few. The principal epidemiological characteristics of such diseases are the absence of life-long protective immunity, cross-reactive immunity between strains and the potential for future re-infection. Each strain is in competition with the others for resources. In this case the resources are susceptible hosts, and dominance goes to those variants that are able to outpace their neighbours in their ability to infect susceptibles. From a Darwinian perspective it is the ''fittest'' strains that will dominate.

The measure of selective advantage given by equation 2 implicitly assumes that the population is infinite -a mathematical idealisation. The fact that conditions of finite size may have an effect on the outcome of selection has been recognised in a population genetics context [17] but has not been explored analytically in multi-strain epidemic models [16] . These studies, however, assumed that the populations were unstructured or demographically homogeneous. The effect of finite size in studies of selection between competing types in structured populations was first developed in Demetrius [18] . The analysis focused on demographic structure and rested on the observation that in view of the heterogeneity in structure and the finite population size,fluctuations in population numbers will occur. The ergodic theory of dynamical systems was then exploited to generate a new family of demographic variables to describe the population dynamics and its fluctuations. A diffusion process was then applied to show that the outcome of selection will now be determined by the robustness or demographic stability of the population, and regulated by the population size and certain demographic parameters which characterise the geometric properties of the infectious net-reproductive function. Robustness, the rate at which the population returns to the steady state condition after a perturbation in age-specific fecundity and mortality variables, can be formalised in terms of the statistical measure evolutionary entropy. This macroscopic variable describes the uncertainty in the age of the mother of a randomly chosen newborn. The change in basic reproduction number, the classical criterion for selective outcome, was shown to be the limit, as population size tends to infinity, of the entropic selection principle. Hence the classical models of selection are limiting cases of the entropic models. This study of competition in age-structured populations was extended by Demetrius, Gundlach and Ochs [19] to the analysis of the dynamics of selection where the heterogeneity derived from individual variations in size, metabolic condition or spatial location. The entropy parameter in this general context describes the uncertainty in the state (size, metabolic condition or spatial location) of the ancestor of a randomly chosen individual.",

This has led to progress in understanding issues such as strain clustering effects, for example, but at the price of intractability when large numbers of strains are considered. By contrast, the model presented here takes a different approach, as it focuses on the emergent properties of multiple competing strains without a detailed rendering of all biological features. The penalty for generating this alternative model is that the biological detail is presented more crudely than in the more detailed epidemiological approaches. Strain selection takes place at a number of levels ranging from within hosts all the way up to the population level. In such multi-scale systems a variety of modelling approaches are needed. However, we believe that the approach presented here complements existing formulations. To make the presentation concise we will summarise certain general results of the dynamics of competition in structured populations, as elaborated in directionality theory [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] , and apply them in an epidemiological context. Specifically, our model shows that in the context of emergence of new human 'flu strains in SE-Asia there will be a progressive shift to less pathogenic strains.

D can be generally expressed in the form D~kT where k is a parameter dependent on the strain, but the characterisation of D will depend on the model system under consideration. In a basic S-I-R model, for example, the fecundity function is a constant independent of infectious age. Consequently the generation time will depend uniquely on the mortality rate (i.e. the rate of recovery from the pathogen). The generation time T will be inversely related to the rate at which individuals leave the infected class, denoted by n. Hence for this class of models D~kT~1=n. In the model described in this paper, survivorship and fecundity are functions of age, so the generation time involves both survivorship and fecundity components. The generation time T can be expressed in terms of the entropy function S. As shown by Demetrius et al. [31] , the evolutionary entropy can be shown to be analytically related to T by This equation asserts, therefore, that in systems with demographic heterogeneity the duration of infection will now be regulated by the pathogen entropy, S.

This suggests that novel H3N2 variants compete with existing strains within the E-SE Asia circulation network with the dominant strain being responsible for generating the next global seasonal 'flu strain.

When a new H3N2 variant is generated within the seeding region it competes for susceptibles with existing variants. The epidemiological picture in this densely populated SE-Asia seeding region is one of strong fluctuations of multiple circulating strains [32] . Much of this fluctuation is driven by the cross-reactive immunity and heterogeneity of host population immune response to the different strains and finite size population effects. The dynamics are characterised by repeated boom-bust cycles in the strain populations, so competition is taking place between a new variant and a rapidly growing incumbent pathogen population that has a large positive growth rate r, implying that the reproductive potential Ww0. Information on the infectious netreproductive function from which we would infer the value of c is less readily available [33] . It is plausible to assume, however, that the rate at which secondary infections are produced is broadly correlated with pathogen burden. This results in a netreproductive function for influenza [33, Figure 1 ] that is slightly skewed towards the early stages of host infection, implying that c is small and negative. From Table S1 , the constraints Ww0 and cv0 suggest that new variants will enjoy a selective advantage if their evolutionary entropy is lower than other competing strains (DSv0) during the competitive growth phase. In this model the invasion success of the new strain will be dependent on the relative evolutionary entropy of the variant contingent on the demographic variables W and c. The information given in Table  S1 can be invoked to determine the selective outcome of competing strains. This information underscores the difference between the deterministic process which defines the classical models and the stochastic process which characterises entropic epidemiology. A variant strain has epidemic potential and will dominate existing H3N2 strains providing that DSv0. By contrast, in a deterministic model (equation 2) the outcome of competition between strains is a deterministic process predicted wholly by R 0 -the strain with the largest basic reproduction number will always dominate. In the entropic model there is a probability of a downward drift in the evolutionary entropy, S, of the dominant strain. Within the classical framework (infinite population size) the outcome is deterministically ordained, that is, we expect that those variants which produce more secondary infectives to dominate all others. By contrast, in a finite population (and contingent on the values of W, and to a lesser extent c) the outcome has an intrinsic stochastic component: it is the evolutionary entropy that determines success so there may be dominant variants which produce fewer secondary infectives (i.e. have a lower growth rate and R 0 ) than their co-circulating competitors.",

Consequently, we expect new annual 'flu strains to have variable R 0 and short infectious duration relative to strains circulating in the SE-Asia seed network because of their smaller evolutionary entropy, S. This pattern is also seen in Table 1 where successful emergent epidemics have variable R 0 but short infectious durations. Additionally, these lower entropy strains will have a greater resilience in maintaining the chain of infection as the pathogen spreads because they have a selective advantage with respect to other strains with which they have to compete for susceptibles. Basic epidemic models [10] correlate the basic reproduction number R 0 with the duration of infection, D which implies that short duration infections will have smaller basic reproduction numbers and would be more likely to die out. By contrast, the analysis here suggests that in the context of emergent epidemics it is the minimisation of the evolutionary entropy (which is proportional to D -since S~log Dz(b{ log k)) that is the determinant of emergent epidemic success, Figure 1 shows the change in entropy over time for a simulation of the invasion process by variants, and it is clear that there is a tendency to decreasing entropy over time for each run. Classical epidemic models define the proportion of the population that need to be vaccinated to eliminate a disease in terms of R 0 , but the theory presented here shows that this is only true in the limit of infinite population which indicates that in future new vaccination criteria will be required for emergent epidemics which take into account finite population size, variability in infection profile and stochasticity effects.",

However, the mechanism of antigenic drift (as described above) then begins to operate on this newly established sub-type and so there will be a gradual decrease in infectious duration of the dominant circulating variant with time. Given that the new virus is likely to be a hybrid animal-human type, it is likely that it is less well adapted to human hosts so it might have a low R 0 . If, rather crudely, we associate infectious duration in the host with pathogenicity, directionality theory implies high pathogenicity immediately following establishment of a new sub-type followed by decreasing pathogenicity in subsequent years. That is, the new Influenza A sub-type (such as 1918, 1957 and 1968) appears to be highly pathogenic in the immediate interval following establishment, but there is a contribution to the decrease in 'flu mortality in the era following the antigenic shift by the action of competitive selection of lower entropy variants during the antigenic drift phase in the SE-Asia seeding region. When a new Influenza A virus sub-type is generated due to antigenic shift the cycle is repeated again. Clearly, there will be a decrease in the absolute influenza mortality figure (number of fatalities) during the drift phase because as time passes the overall population immunity level increases. However, the model suggests that the case fatality rate (CFR -number of fatalities per infected individuals) will decline during the drift phase due to declining pathogenicity. A decline in the CFR is observed empirically when comparing a pandemic attack year and the next subsequent epidemic [39] but there does not appear to be any detailed epidemiological analysis of long-term CFR trends during the drift phase. A recent detailed study of the epidemiology of Influenza A H1N1 in the era 1918-1951 [40] shows, Figure 2 , that during the H1N1 era there is evidence of a sustained decrease in mortality rate between 1918 (autumn wave) and 1924 and likewise between 1928 and 1944. Whilst some of this progressive weakening of the influenza epidemics is due to increasing host population immunity it is likely that there is also a contribution to declining pathogenicity resulting from the mechanisms proposed in the directionality theory. H1N1 (2009) Swine flu. In March 2009 the first reports of an epidemic of a novel influenza-like pathogen emerged in Mexico [13] . Analysis showed that the infectious agent in this on-going epidemic to be Influenza A H1N1 (swine flu) [7] . H1N1 has generated epidemics in humans in the past and was responsible for the 1918 influenza pandemic and a 1977 'flu epidemic. It is possible to explain the relentless spread of this current outbreak in directionality theory. This new variant has emerged from a 'flu type associated with pigs, but now has human-to-human transmission capability. This successful variant has a shorter infectious duration than other influenza A strains [13] which suggests that it may have emerged with a competitive advantage founded on its lower entropy DSv0 \u00f0 \u00derelative to other currently circulating 'flu strains. The extent of pre-existing immunity to H1N1 (swine flu) is currently unknown, but our results suggest that in humans there may be some pre-existing protection from previous exposure to influenza virus. This possibility is also noted by Fraser et al. [13] . Alternatively it may simply be a novel pandemic strain with short infectious duration. SARS had a higher R 0 and longer infectious duration (Table 1 ) than swine flu yet did not have the same global impact, which reinforces the generic suggestion from entropic considerations that it is those emergent diseases with shorter infectious durations that appear to have the greater pandemic potential.",

We noted above that many antigenically stable infectious diseases (measles, chickenpox for example) have comparatively long infectious durations compared with emergent infections (Table 1 ). Directionality theory suggests that this might be the consequence of a long evolutionary adaptation to humans by occasional mutations resulting in ever higher evolutionary entropy S. In this picture, for a mutation to dominate an established equilibrium incumbent strain it is necessary for the variant to have DSw0, so on evolutionary time scales we see an upward drift in entropy and, consequently, ever increasing duration of infectiousness. Although such diseases do have a seasonal component to their incidence they nevertheless exist at some stable mean prevalence within the host population. The next dominant strain measles has to compete against a long-established incumbent strain that is at overall equilibrium in the population. Figure 3 shows the change (upward drift) in entropy of the most frequent variants in the population using a simulation of the invasion process. In this picture the dynamics of invasion is considered at a global scale (number of infectives N large) so the conventional Malthusian picture re-asserts itself. Consequently in this situation there will be proportionality between the duration of infection and R 0 , so the concept of a basic reproduction number retains its conventional role as a measure of selective advantage and, hence, its usefulness as a metric for the amount of vaccination required to eliminate a given pathogen strain. It is apparent that within the approach presented here the epidemiological context (emergent pathogen versus established equilibrium) in which the competition takes place does matter to the outcome and the properties of strains that will dominate.",

By contrast, in established (equilibrium) populations it is longer infectious duration (high entropy) strains that have competitive advantage. This suggests that the epidemiological circumstances, opportunistic or equilibrium, that are prevalent in a host population during competitive emergence are critical in determining the properties of the dominant pathogen strain. To be clear, the stochasticity and fluctuations present in this model arise from consideration of an infection process in a finite population that has infection demographics defined by the function V (x). In this case the straightforward application of the concept of the basic reproductive number can be of limited usefulness as a key determinant of epidemic dynamics as there is no longer an automatic correlation between R 0 and competitive dominance.",

Moreover, these results suggest the calculations of R 0 may not provide a reliable guide to the vaccination effort required to eliminate an emergent pandemic strain. The limitation of a singular focus on R 0 has been highlighted by Meyers [41] in the context of epidemics on networks.
