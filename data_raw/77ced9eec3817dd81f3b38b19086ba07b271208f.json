Their PPs, mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) and intestines were collected, and the cells were labelled with CD11c, CD40, CD80, CD86 and MHC-II to analyse the expression of these molecules and determine the frequency of these activation markers on DCs. Compared with the controls, NC8-pSIP409-NP-M1-DCpep induced a notable enhancement in the surface expression of CD80 + , CD86 + , CD40 + , and MHC-II + on CD11c + cells in the lamina propria of the small intestine by 24 h post-vaccination (Fig. 2d) . However, in contrast to the MLN, only CD11c + CD40 + and CD11c + CD80 + DCs were present in the PPs at 24 h post-vaccination (Fig. S2b,c) . Furthermore, at 36 h post-vaccination, greater frequencies of CD11c + CD80 + , CD11c + CD86 + , CD11c + CD40 + , and CD11c + MHC-II + DCs were observed in the MLNs of mice treated with NC8-pSIP409-NP-M1-DCpep (data not shown). These data also imply that DC activation initially occurs in the small intestine and PPs following oral NC8-pSIP409-NP-M1-DCpep administration and that these activated DCs subsequently migrate to the MLN. The increased expression of DC activation markers may indicate the functional maturation of these APCs.",

In a repeated tests utilizing a lethal dose of H1N1 virus, we observed no significant difference in weight loss after mice were challenged with H1N1 (10 \u00d7 LD 50 ) (Fig. S7a) . Both vaccinated and control mice succumbed to infection, but the survival time of the mice vaccinated with NC8-pSIP409-NP-M1-DCpep was always more longer than that of the mice that received PBS, NC8-pSIP409, or NC8-pSIP409-NP-M1-Ctrlpep (Fig. S7b,c) . The above-described results were further validated by challenge with a smaller dose of H1N1 (0.5 \u00d7 LD 50 ) after vaccination. As expected, 50% of the control mice survived the infection, but the mice administered NC8-pSIP409-NP-M1-DCpep 15 days prior to challenge presented significant improvements in terms of bodyweight loss (NC8-pSIP409-NP-M1-DCpep vs NC8-pSIP409-NP-M1-Ctrlpep, unpaired t-test of peak weight loss, observed on day 6-7; P = 0.0205) and survival [NC8-pSIP409-NP-M1-DCpep vs NC8-pSIP409-NP-M1-Ctrlpep, log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test, P = 0.0419] (Fig. 10d,e) . In contrast to the control mice, the mice immunized with NC8-pSIP409-NP-M1-DCpep exhibited significantly lower residual lung virus titers after infection with H1N1 (Fig. 10g) . Furthermore, the degree of lung damage after challenge with H1N1 was significantly reduced in the mice immunized with NC8-pSIP409-NP-M1-DCpep compared with those belonging to the other groups (Fig. 11b) . After the lung sections were scored by three independent blinded readers, the lung inflammation was found to be significantly decreased in the lungs from infected mice vaccinated with NC8-pSIP409-NP-M1-Dpep compared with the PBS-or NC8-pSIP409-NP-M1-Ctrlpep-vaccinated controls (Fig. 11c) .

Waterfowl are generally considered the natural reservoir of AIVs and can easily transmit viruses to other species, such as poultry, via migration. Transmission to other species likely requires pivotal genetic and antigenic mutations 32, 33 . Specific T cell responses are elicited by the relatively well conserved internal influenza antigens, which are an important component of the inherent immunity to influenza, particularly heterosubtypic AIVs. However, the current AIV vaccines do not provide cross-protection against different subtypes of AIVs. Hence, the development of safe and efficacious oral vaccines against a broader spectrum of AIVs that infect poultry has been actively pursued. These efforts are not intended to completely control the virus but rather to alleviate clinical symptoms, reduce virus shedding and accelerate recovery 16 . The T cell-mediated immune response could also offer much broader protection when combined with ) and survival (c,e) were recorded for 14 days. The weight loss and mortality data are presented as the means \u00b1 SEM of triplicate tests (n = 10 mice per group). The weight loss data were analysed by using an unpaired t-test. The mortality data were analysed by using a Log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test and are expressed relative to the NC8-pSIP409-NP-M1-Ctrlpep group (*P < 0.05). Five days after infection, the mouse-adapted H9N2 AIVs (f) and A/PR/8/34(H1N1) (g) in the lungs were titrated in MDCK cells.

In addition, lactobacillus can induce the activation of DCs in MLNs and the small intestine cells help kill the pathogen, in a mouse model 29 . In this study, we observed that recombinant L. plantarum can enhance the expression of DC markers in vivo and in vitro. Importantly, the oral vaccination of mice with L. plantarum expressing NP-M1-DCpep also effectively elicited the activation of DCs in the small intestine and gradually in the PPs and MLNs. Similar results have been obtained by Kathania 30 .

In previous studies, Lactobacillus GG has been found to cause enhanced IgA production 37 , whereas L. Johnsonii leads to enhanced IgA production in PP whole-organ culture supernatants 38 . DCs may be associated with the mechanism underlying the enhanced IgA production by L. plantarum AYA 39 . Furthermore, we and other researchers have recently demonstrated that the oral administration of recombinant L. plantarum may contribute to the production of secretory IgA antibodies at the mucosal surface of the respiratory tract to combat infection with pathogens such as influenza virus 25, 40, 41 . In this study, we extended our earlier findings and determined that NP-M1-DCpep delivered by L. plantarum significantly elicits B220 + IgA + cells in the PP and ileum (data not shown). Our results indicate that NC8-pSIP409-NP-M1-DCpep induces significantly higher levels of total and antigen-specific secretory IgA in faecal matter and the BALF in mice. Cytokines such as IL-4 and TGF-\u03b2 are associated with the differentiation of B cells and the induction of IgA 42, 43 . Our data also revealed that vaccination with recombinant L. plantarum likely contributes to the increased numbers of FAS + PNA + B220 + B cells in the PPs and MLNs to shape GCs within the mucosa in mice. We presume that recombinant L. plantarum or probiotics induce T follicular helper (Tfh) cells, which contribute to T cell-dependent humoral immune responses by providing helper T cells to B cells and by contributing to GC formation and long-lived antibody responses 44 .",

Perforin-deficient mice exhibit decreased cytotoxic activity in vitro or in vivo 50 . CD8 + T cells are cytolytic, and combatting cells infected with AIV or other viruses is generally considered their main role 49 . Perforin could induce this activity, resulting in the complete maturation of effector CD8 + T cells. The specific expression of CD107a or IFN-\u03b3 /TNF-\u03b1 on CD8 + T cells is critical to determining the phenotype of the CD8 + T cells produced during our immunization schedules and associated with a protective immune response 51 . In this study, we observed that recombinant L. plantarum elicits the production of CD8 + CTLs with an activated type that may present cytotoxic activity to kill targets of the NP and M1 peptides in vivo. Our data are consistent with results from previous studies indicating that immunization with Lactococcus lactis expressing NP with a cholera toxin B subunit adjuvant in mice induces significant cellular immune responses at day 33 after the initial immunization 52 . The role of perforin in this response awaits further confirmation. Future studies should evaluate potential improvements in the survival of IFN-\u03b3 -deficient or perforin-deficient mice.

The transfer experiments with NOD-SCID mice provide additional evidence that CD8 + T cells but not CD4 + T cells play an important role in combatting influenza viruses. CD8 + T cell responses can provide strong protection against influenza virus infections 48 . Furthermore, specific CD8 + T cells result in strong pathogen-killing effects, and thus, the use of these T cells has been studied extensively 58, 59 . However, whether CD4 + T cells provide protective responses to influenza virus in mice vaccinated with recombinant L. plantarum via other mechanisms awaits further study.",

Mice were orally administered LG2055 or heat-killed Lactobacillus pentosus b240 once a day for 21 days and were subsequently i.n. inoculated with the influenza virus, and some of the observed protection may have resulted from non-antigen-specific immune responses to the lactobacillus 60,61 . In our experiment, however, the mice were immunized orally with recombinant L. plantarum and vaccine vectors using a primer-booster regime. In addition, the mice immunized with NC8-pSIP409-NP-M1-DCpep started to recover eight days after challenge, and all of these mice survived (Fig. 10a,b) , indicating a protective effect against homologous AIV challenge. However, the immunized mice challenged with 10 \u00d7 LD 50 heterologous virus did not exhibit effective protection. Recombinant L. plantarum may not protect mice against H1N1 infection because the epitopes of the NPs or M1 from the H9N2 and HIN1 subtypes of AIV differ. Therefore, although the recombinant L. plantarum provides only limited protection against infection with a lethal dose of a heterologous virus, it can provide complete protection against infection with a sub-lethal dose of a heterologous virus. In future studies, we will examine more conservative vaccine epitopes to develop more effective vaccines.",

Inactivated vaccines targeting AIV surface proteins, such as haemagglutinin, provided complete protection against homologous AIV (Fig. 10c) , but conferred only partial protection against heterologous viral strains (Fig. 10e) , to which a humoral immune response is thought to provide the major protective effect 62 . A more effective strategy aiming to stimulate T cell responses has been confirmed to provide protection against heterologous influenza virus strains in both mice and humans 63, 64 . In this study, oral immunization with L. plantarum expressing NP-M1-Dcpep provided effective protection against heterologous influenza virus infection (Fig. 10e ). In addition, L. plantarum-based vaccines have other advantages, including the protection of the integrity of the lungs, possibly because Tregs markedly improve the lungs of mice that administered L. rhamnosus 65 . Many studies have implicated Ag-specific Tregs in primary infections. In addition, antigen-specific memory regulatory CD4 + Foxp3 + T cells contribute to immune regulation during memory responses to a previously encountered influenza virus, which play important regulatory roles in the cellular immune responses to viral infections and are thought to prevent pathological changes resulting from excessive immune responses 66 .",
