            "text": "Species within the Neoromicia bat genus are abundant and widely distributed in Africa. It is common for these insectivorous bats to roost in anthropogenic structures in urban regions. Additionally, Neoromicia capensis have previously been identified as potential hosts for Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-related coronaviruses. This study aimed to ascertain the gastrointestinal virome of these bats, as viruses excreted in fecal material or which may be replicating in rectal or intestinal tissues have the greatest opportunities of coming into contact with other hosts. Samples were collected in five regions of South Africa over eight years. Initial virome composition was determined by viral metagenomic sequencing by pooling samples and enriching for viral particles. Libraries were sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq and NextSeq500 platforms, producing a combined 37 million reads. Bioinformatics analysis of the high throughput sequencing data detected the full genome of a novel species of the Circoviridae family, and also identified sequence data from the Adenoviridae, Coronaviridae, Herpesviridae, Parvoviridae, Papillomaviridae, Phenuiviridae, and Picornaviridae families. Metagenomic sequencing data was insufficient to determine the viral diversity of certain families due to the fragmented coverage of genomes and lack of suitable sequencing depth, as some viruses were detected from the analysis of reads-data only. Follow up conventional PCR assays targeting conserved gene regions for the Adenoviridae, Coronaviridae, and Herpesviridae families were used to confirm metagenomic data and generate additional sequences to determine genetic diversity. The complete coding genome of a MERS-related coronavirus was recovered with additional amplicon sequencing on the MiSeq platform. The new genome shared 97.2% overall nucleotide identity to a previous Neoromicia-associated MERS-related virus, also from South Africa. Conventional PCR PLOS ONE | https://doi.",

            "text": "The role of bats as potential or confirmed reservoirs of various viral agents with public health importance has been increasingly appreciated in recent years. Several bat-borne viruses are considered emerging, with an increase in the number of human cases and outbreaks over the past two decades; such as the bat-borne viruses Marburg virus and Nipah virus [1, 2] . These viruses are associated with direct zoonotic transmission and infection of exposed human populations. Other identified bat-associated viruses are only related to viruses of known public health importance, like the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) or Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [3] [4] [5] . Though no direct spillover have been identified, overall sequence similarities between human viral strains and related batborne viruses have implicated these viruses in the emergence of new human coronaviruses [6, 7] . Detection of potentially zoonotic viruses in bat species has been the driving force for increased research and surveillance of the bat virome (as well as other infectious agents).",

The use of sequence-independent metagenomic approaches has enabled detection of highly divergent viruses, often sharing only low homologies to currently known virus species [11, [14] [15] [16] [17] . Viral metagenomic investigations provide opportunities for the detection of potentially zoonotic viruses, as well as other mammalian-infecting viruses not previously known to have been present [8, 11, 18 ]. An inventory of novel viruses can thus be constructed, and further investigated for their potential as zoonotic agents. Metagenomics and conventional PCR surveillance have identified bats as natural hosts for large genetic diversities of several viral families-such as the Circoviridae, Coronaviridae, Paramyxoviridae, Parvoviridae, and Adenoviridae, as well as the genus Hepacivirus, in the family Flaviviridae [6, 10, 19, 20] .",

Investigations have identified that both species host various viruses. The novel hantavirus, Mouyassu\u00e9 virus, was detected from archival specimens of two N. nana individuals collected in the Ivory Coast in West Africa [25] . In South Africa, novel paramyxovirus sequences were identified from the same host species [26] . Lastly, coronaviruses from both the genera Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus have been reported from N. capensis species [27, 28] . A detected lineage C betacoronavirus, named NeoCoV/PML-PHE1, grouped taxonomically within the same species as MERS-CoV [4, 28] . The virus shared an overall nucleotide identity of 85.5-85.6% to human and camel strains of MERS-CoV, with only 64.3-64.6% amino acid identity within the spike gene that is responsible for receptor recognition and attachment [4] . Considering the high diversity of genus-specific bat coronaviruses detected globally [6, 27, 29] , other MERS-related viruses are likely circulating within this host genus.",

Viral metagenomic sequencing provided an initial assessment of the virome composition from gastrointestinal samples at a host genus-level, detecting sequences from several viral families. However, sequencing outputs produced fragmented coverage of several viruses, making sequence diversity difficult to discern, and lacked suitable sequencing depth as some viruses were only detected from sequencing reads-data. Three viral families (Coronaviridae, Adenoviridae, and Herpesviridae) were selected for further investigation by analysing samples pooled per host species. Conventional nucleic acid detection based on conserved gene regions confirmed diverse sequences of adenoviruses and herpesviruses, as well as the recovery of the complete coding genome of another MERS-related virus.",

The study focused on samples from the lower gastrointestinal tract (faecal, rectal and intestinal samples), to identify viruses present in these tissues or excreted in faecal material (Fig 2A; S1 Table) . Due to the size of these bat species and small quantities of faecal material at times available for collection, sample material for certain individuals were limited. All faecal or tissue samples were used sparingly to enable additional analyses. However, priority was given to sample preparation for high throughput sequencing in order to determine the virome composition of the analysed host genus. Therefore, if sample material consisted of very small quantities of faecal or rectal material, these samples were completely used for this step. For high throughput sequencing sample preparation, faecal and rectal samples of all bats were pooled and processed by mechanical homogenization in 400 \u03bcl PBS (Lonza) with two stainless-steel beads (Qiagen). A Tissue Lyser II system (Qiagen) was utilized, shaking at 30Hz for 60 seconds. The lysates were cleared by low temperature (4\u02daC) centrifugation for 10 minutes at 10,000x g. Cleared supernatants were pooled and filtered through a 0.45 \u03bcM cellulose acetone syringe filter (Corning Incorporated) to remove large particulate matter.

Neoromicia species do not roost in caves where they can be readily caught and sampled [21] . Instead, most individuals were caught in flight away from their roosts, and therefore fewer individuals were available to investigate. The samples utilized in this study were processed with methods similar to those that have proven to be successful in bat virome analyses-with enrichment methods for conserving viral particles and reducing sequencing of host and non-viral nucleic acids [11, 15, 17, 56] . Furthermore, an additional host ribosomal RNA depletion step was incorporated to simplify bioinformatics analysis. Prepared Illumina libraries were sequenced on the MiSeq platform as an initial examination, followed by sequencing on the NextSeq500. Combined data outputs produced 37 million reads of which 34.8 million remained after quality and adaptor trimming with an inhouse developed workflow in CLC Genomics Workbench ( Fig 2B) . As no Neoromicia host genomes are available for sequence removal, the genome of Myotis brandtii, another species within the family Vespertilionidae, was utilized. Despite enrichment efforts, application of strict mapping parameters within the CLC workflow removed nearly 40% of reads as host ( Fig 2B) .",

Again, less than 1% of all contigs were assigned as viral with BLASTn analyses. Contigs and unassembled reads assigned to specific virus families from BLAST outputs were inspected manually before being considered as valid ( Fig 2C) . Many of the assignments were deemed as false positives due to poor e-values, low complexity sequences (such as repeat runs of nucleotides) or having greater similarity matches to host/mammalian sequences [57] . Reads and contigs (e.g rhabdoviruses, orthomyxoviruses and caliciviruses) identified as such were discarded from further analyses ( Fig  2C) . Despite a low percentage of viral reads, sequence data from eight mammalian-infecting virus families were detected, including the Adenoviridae, Circoviridae, Coronaviridae, Herpesviridae, Parvoviridae, Papillomaviridae, Picornaviridae and Phenuiviridae. In agreement with other virome investigations, many of detected sequences shared low genetic similarities to known viruses due to a lack of available sequence diversity for comparison [11, 14] . This lack of available sequence data may only be overcome by further reports documenting the viral diversity of bats as well as other hosts. Though non-mammalian infecting viruses (phages and insect viruses) were identified, they were outside the scope of the study and not investigated any further.",

The capsid protein shared amino acid similarities of only 20.6-49.1% to all compared viruses in the family. In agreement with additional species demarcations suggested by Li et al.

Given it meets the ICTV criteria for species demarcation, we propose the new species, Neoromicia-associated cyclovirus 1 (strain 19681/RSA) within the genus Cyclovirus. Interestingly, the closest relative of the putative new Neoromicia cyclovirus originated from human stool; with an overall nucleotide identity of 64.9%, and amino acid similarities of 73.3% and 49.1% for the Rep protein and capsid protein, respectively.

For example, no contigs were produced from the Coronaviridae family, though several pairs of reads were detected across distant genome regions. Several contigs of <430bp were designated as herpesvirus sequences, though were discarded after manual curation as being only mammalian-derived sequences. Some contigs were still identified as herpesvirus, though had poor evalue support. Severely fragmented viral genome coverage was observed for the Adenoviridae, with contigs aligning to multiple gene regions ranging in length from 200 to 1826bp (Fig 6A) . Estimation of adenovirus genome coverage is further complicated by the detection of divergent sequences that align to diverse adenovirus reference genomes. These limitations may be attributed to overall insufficient depth of sequencing, the bioinformatics analyses methods implemented (BLASTn), or biases incorporated by certain nucleic acid preparation techniques for library construction-such as the use of randomly primed cDNA [66, 67] . Similar events have been noted in the literature; where viruses were unsuccessfully or partially sequenced by high throughout sequencing though readily amplified with conventional PCR assays [10, 68] . Due to limited computational resources, and surveillance emphasis focusing on identification of mammalian viral families with zoonotic potential, BLASTn analyses was deemed sufficient. However, more divergent viral sequences, particularly for non-frequently sequenced genome regions, may have been better detected with a BLASTx analyses using the complete NCBI nr database.",

Adenoviruses are double-stranded DNA viruses of approximately 35kb, which may cause a variety of respiratory and gastrointestinal infections within their human, domestic pet animal, and wildlife hosts [37] . Surveillance initiatives in multiple countries have identified bats as important hosts for the genetic diversity and evolutionary history of adenoviruses [19, 69, 70] . Adenoviruses have been shown to be capable of interspecies transmission and establishment within a new host due to the close relatedness of certain bat and canine adenoviruses [19] . Even though bat adenoviruses could potentially be transmitted via the aerosolization of bat faecal material, their potential zoonotic risk to humans seems low [71] . The PCR assay selected to confirm Neoromicia adenovirus sequence diversity was based on a conserved region (260bp) of the DNA polymerase gene [37] . This region overlapped with a 860bp contig (BtAdV/NeoC52222/RSA) identified from the high throughput sequencing data, though few bat adenovirus sequences of greater than 400bp were available for comparison. PCR analysis identified adenovirus DNA in eight of the remaining pooled samples. These sequences represented three clades (Fig 6B) . The N. capensis sequences originating from three different provinces, and sampled over five years, grouped together and shared between 97.7-99.6% nucleotide identities. This clade was 78.7-79.8% identical to sequences in the mixed species clade of N. nana, N. zuluensis and N. cf. helios hosts from Limpopo province, which shared 98.8-100% nucleotide identity. Two of these sequences (BtAdV/NeoV13/LP/RSA/2010 and BtAdV/NeoV17-3/LP/RSA/2014) were identical, even though they were identified from bats collected four years apart in different locations of the Limpopo province. The polymerase contig BtAdV/NeoC52222/RSA, identified directly from the Neoromicia virome, shared lower similarities (64.7-65 .5%) to the other groups of Neoromicia adenovirus sequences.",

Bat-associated herpesviruses have been detected from all three subfamilies, with several that have yet to be classified [73, 74] . Herpesviruses are known to cause recurrent or latent infections that may later become reactivated within particular cell types. Though no bat herpesviruses have been linked to zoonotic infections, a gammaherpesvirus isolated from a Myotis cell line was shown capable of growth in human derived cell lines [73] . Evolutionary analysis of gammaherpesviruses originating from a number of host orders suggest that multiple host switching events and independent viral cospeciation of lineages may previously have occurred; with bats and primates acting a sources of genetic diversity [75] .",

BtCoVNeoromicia1787/LP/RSA/2013 was utilized as a lineage representative for these Neoromicia alphacoronaviruses in Fig 8 ( as the other sequences were of an insufficient length for comparison). The closest relatives to this lineage was a Nyctalus lysleri bat alphacoronavirus (BNM98-30/BGR/2008) from Bulgaria, as well as a clade containing the human Viral discovery using metagenomics from Neoromicia bats in South Africa coronavirus NL63 (HCoVNL63) and related Triaenops bat viruses from Kenya [36, 77, 78] . The Neoromicia and Nyctalus alphacoronaviruses shared between 75.5-79.2% nucleotide identities to HCoVNL63, which is somewhat lower than the similarities of the NL63-related Triaenops bat viruses within this gene region (76-84% nucleotide identity) (S7 Table) . Comparatively, Hipposideros bat coronaviruses identified in Ghana were suggested to have been possible early progenitors of the human alphacoronavirus HCoV229E [79] , and shared greater similarities of 87-92% nucleotide identity to HCoV229E. Further surveillance and sequence analysis of the alphacoronaviruses from N. capensis may identify whether they can be considered as potential recombinant progenitors that may have participated in the emergence of HCoVNL63 [78] .",

This virus shared 97.7% nucleotide identity to Neo-CoV/PML-PHE1 within the compared RdRp gene region. This second variant was detected four years later, confirming the circulation of MERS-related viruses within the host genus. The complete coding genome of BtCoVNeo5038 (30009bp) was sequenced by further amplicon sequencing from 11 amplicons with 1000x coverage on Illumina's MiSeq platform. The 11 coding regions were in the characteristic coronavirus order, and compared to other lineage C betacoronaviruses (S8 Table) . The overall genome similarities between BtCoVNeo5038 and its closest relative, NeoCoV/PML-PHE1, were 97.2% nucleotide identity and 98.5% amino acid similarity. The shared nucleotide identities of all genes were between 96-98.3% (98-99.5% amino acid similarities); with the gene sharing the lowest nucleotide similarity being the spike protein gene (96% nucleotide and 98.7% amino acid similarity). Due to similarities within the seven conserved ORFs required for species demarcation (97.7-100% amino acid similarity) [76] , BtCoVNeo5038 may also be assigned to the species, Middle East respiratory syndromerelated coronavirus.

However, it has also been suggested that the original progenitor viruses of MERS-CoV may have originated as a MERS-related coronavirus harboured by a vespertilionid bat [4, 5, 80] . The currently identified diversity of bat-borne MERS-related viruses, however, are not sufficiently similar (particularly within the spike protein) to human/camel strains of MERS-CoV to be considered as the possible progenitors. This would mirror the identification of similar SARS-related coronaviruses from Rhinolophus hosts. After 11 years of continued surveillance within Rhinolophus species, the WIV1 strain capable of utilizing the same binding receptor as human SARS-CoV was finally detected [7] . The finding would lead to the suggestion that through recombination of multiple SARS-related strains, certain SARS-related bat coronaviruses may have been capable of direct human infection [7] .",

The sequence-independent manner utilized by metagenomic high throughput sequencing methodologies enables detection of both known and unknown viral species that may not have been detected with conventional nucleic acid methods. Marked limitations of the metagenomic approach implemented here were highlighted by inadequate sequencing of several viral families, which could subsequently be detected with conventional PCR assays; such as the adenoviruses, herpesviruses and coronaviruses. In spite of the lack of coronavirus contigs produced from the metagenomic data, the complete coding genome of a MERS-related betacoronavirus was still recovered with additional amplicon sequencing. Since the experimental portion of the study was conducted, alternative methods have been suggested that may reduce these biases and improve sequencing results from nonclinical samples with low viral Viral discovery using metagenomics from Neoromicia bats in South Africa nucleic acid concentrations-such as utilization of the ScriptSeq library kit (Illumina) directly after extraction of RNA [66] .",

Follow up longitudinal studies can be implemented to confirm this finding and establish the total duration of the viral persistence. The Neoromicia adenovirus sequences shared high similarity to those identified in European bats, whereas the Neoromicia herpesviruses were much more diverse than previously identified bat-associated viruses. This observation may reflect differences in sampling efforts applied to each viral family. Further investigation of the identified viral families are required to sequence complete genes involved in receptor recognition and attachment to host cells. In the absence of viral isolates, this would allow functional assessment of the receptors utilized for cell entry, enable estimations of their potential to spread to new species, and assess the risks they pose to public or veterinary health. Lastly, the novel sequence data generated from the Neoromicia virome can be utilized in assay development for additional nucleic acid detection surveillance activities, to determine the prevalence rates of selected novel viruses.",

As a comparison, the Neoromicia hantavirus (Hantaviridae), Mouyassu\u00e9 virus from the Ivory Coast, shares only 32.9% nucleotide identity to the contig detected in this study",
