Recent studies demonstrated that PEDF displays cytoprotective activity in several cell types. However, it remains unknown whether PEDF is involved in glucocorticoid-induced osteoblast death. The aim of this study was to examine the role of PEDF in osteoblast survival in response to dexamethasone, an active glucocorticoid analogue, and explore the underlying mechanism. In the present study, dexamethasone (DEX) was used to induce MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblast apoptosis. PEDF mRNA and protein levels and cell apoptosis were determined respectively. Then PEDF receptor (PEDF-R)-and lysophosphatidic acid (LPA)-related signal transductions were assessed. Here we show that DEX down-regulates PEDF expression, which contributes to osteoblast apoptosis. As a result, exogenous recombinant PEDF (rPEDF) inhibited DEX-induced cell apoptosis. We confirmed that PEDF-R was expressed on MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblast membrane and could bind to PEDF which increased the level of LPA and activated the phosphorylation of Akt. Our results suggest that PEDF attenuated DEX-induced apoptosis in MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblasts through LPA-dependent Akt activation via PEDF-R.",

Previous studies found that GCs could inhibit bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell proliferation, promote adipogenic differentiation and induce osteoblast apoptosis [4] [5] [6] , thus breaking the balance between bone resorption and formation. The majority of GC effects depend greatly on the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). GR is involved in multiple signaling pathways and is critical for both cell survival and cell death [7, 8] . Evidence has shown that GR is widely expressed in many cell types, including osteoblasts and osteoclasts [7, 9] .

However, PEDF involvement in GC-induced osteoblast apoptosis and whether GCs affect PEDF expression in osteoblasts have not been reported. PEDF is a secreted glycoprotein of roughly 50 kDa, with 418 amino acids. Although first identified in cultured pigment epithelial cells from fetal human retinas, PEDF is widely expressed throughout the human body, with multiple biological functions [11, 12] . Furthermore, recent studies revealed that PEDF displays cytoprotective activity in several cell types such as granule cells, photoreceptor cells and cardiomyocytes [13] [14] [15] . In bone, PEDF induces the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and osteoblast precursor cells, which contributes to bone formation [16] . Broadhead et al. [17] reported that PEDF expression plays a key role in endochondral ossification, which is essential for bone growth and healing.",

Upon PEDF binding, PEDF receptor (PEDF-R) induces phospholipase A2, liberating lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and fatty acids that are involved in a variety of cellular activities [18, 21, 22] . The Akt pathway is able to integrate stimuli from a variety of signals initiated by hormone/growth factor signaling, and mechanical loading. Phospholipids and LPA have recently emerged as bioactive compounds that exert mitogenic effects and display cytoprotective activities through the stimulation of Akt phosphorylation in many cell types, including osteoblasts [23] .

MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblasts were exposed to a wide range of DEX concentrations for 24 h; in addition, 10\u00b45 mol/L DEX was assessed at different time points. According to CCK-8 (cell counting kit-8) assay ( Figure 1A ,B), cell death rates were increased with doses and prolonged DEX treatments, in agreement with data obtained for primary osteoblasts and other osteoblastic cell lines [5] . DEX treatment caused approximately 40%-50% cell death at 10\u00b45 mol/L for 24 h ( Figure 1A ,B); this concentration was used in subsequent experiments. Correspondingly, Western blot showed a stark elevation in caspase-3, which was markedly activated within 12 h in osteoblasts treated with DEX ( Figure 1D ). The levels of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), which also reflects apoptosis, were increased in a similar fashion after DEX treatment as shown ( Figure 1C ,D). No obvious difference was observed in caspase-3 activity at 36 h or more. These results indicated that DEX promoted MC3T3-E1 cell death by activating apoptosis-related signaling. pre-osteoblasts. MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblasts were exposed to DEX at different concentrations (10 \u22129 , 10 \u22128 , \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7, 10 \u22123 mol/L) for 24 h; in addition, cells were incubated with 10 \u22125 mol/L DEX for different times (0, 12, 24, 36, and 48 h).

In this experiment, ELISA analysis showed a significant reduction of LPA after treatment with DEX ( Figure 5A ). PEDF treatment could mitigate the DEX-induced LPA reduction, while PEDF-R siRNA attenuated this effect. Western blot was used to determine the effect of DEX on phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt). PEDF restrained p-Akt reduction that increased the ratio of pAkt to total Akt (tAkt), thereby activating the downstream protective molecules ( Figure 5B ). . PEDF-R mediated PEDF activates PI3K/Akt pathway by increasing LPA levels in MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblasts. MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblasts treated with or without rPEDF were exposed to 10 \u22125 M DEX for 24 h.

One of the most important lipolysis products is bioactive LPA, which could bind to its receptors (Gi protein-coupled LPA receptors) and operate as a second messenger that affects cell signaling. LPA is capable of activating the PI3K/Akt pathway and increasing Akt phosphorylation [23, 28] , which in turn inhibits pro-apoptotic molecules. We observed a change in LPA levels after rPEDF treatment under DEX conditions. The DEX-induced decrease in PEDF expression and lipolysis leads to reduced LPA amounts, which directly affect Akt phosphorylation; exogenous rPEDF increased the production of LPA via PEDF-R, and promoted cell survival. A recent study found that PEDF deficiency in mice results in increased total body fat [21, 29] , illustrating its systemic role as a negative regulator of adipogenesis. Since PEDF is implicated in lipid metabolism, it may enhance lipolysis to reduce DEX-induced adipogenesis, which in itself is a protective factor. Hence, there is enough data suggesting that PEDF can protect against DEX-induced MC3T3-E1 cell apoptosis and alters cell survival partly through LPA-mediated Akt activation. Meanwhile, osteoblasts undergo apoptosis due in part to PEDF level reduction.",

MSCs are sensitive to apoptosis with the long-term or high-dose application of DEX [30] . Simultaneously, PEDF is involved in bone remodeling as it affects osteoblastic and osteoclastic differentiation. Recent studies revealed that PEDF up-regulates osteoblastic genes that promote osteoblastic differentiation [31] . Besides, evidence has shown that PEDF is involved in MSC and osteoblast progenitor differentiation; meanwhile, suppression of PEDF leads to decreased alkaline phosphatase levels and mineral deposition [16] . Here, we assessed the relationship between DEX and PEDF, and found that PEDF expression was negatively correlated with DEX-induced MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblast apoptosis. These results revealed that PEDF displays pro-osteogenesis properties in both osteoblast sources and outcomes. Interestingly, PEDF is reported to impede osteoclastic differentiation by inducing the expression of osteoclast-repressive genes [31] . Akiyama et al. [32] found that osteoclast differentiation, RANKL-mediated (receptor activator for nuclear factor-\u03ba B ligand-mediated) survival and bone resorption are inhibited by PEDF. In addition, PEDF-derived peptide 34mer could trigger Wnt signaling, which plays an important role in bone formation and homoeostasis [33] . The existing research, however, suggests that PEDF contributes to osteogenesis and osteoblast survival, providing a potential and effective therapeutic strategy for DEX-induced osteoporosis or other bone-related diseases. Our results that dexamethasone suppresses PEDF expression will provide new insights into dexamethasone function and clinical application.",

So we speculate that the 44mer peptide has a similar cytoprotective function with the full-length PEDF in the process of GC-induced apoptosis. Compared to full-length PEDF, the 44mer peptide can be more stable and shows weaker immunogenicity. Therefore, we plan to further explore the role of PEDF-derived peptide 44mer, which will offer further possibility for clinical application.",

PEDF may be an important and indispensable factor in stabilizing the bone microenvironment and protecting against GC toxicity. As far as we know, this is the first study to show that GCs down-regulate PEDF expression, which contributes to osteoblast apoptosis. However, the detailed regulatory mechanisms and what happens to PEDF in osteoclasts under DEX treatment need further investigation. This is a primary study that provides a new understanding of the complex PEDF effects on pro-osteogenesis; further in vivo assays are planned to confirm these findings.",
