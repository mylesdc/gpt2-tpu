Macrophages recognize influenza A virus infection with their pattern recognition receptors, and are involved in the activation of proper innate immune response. Here, we have used high-throughput subcellular proteomics combined with bioinformatics to provide a global view of host cellular events that are activated in response to influenza A virus infection in human primary macrophages. We show that viral infection regulates the expression and/or subcellular localization of more than one thousand host proteins at early phases of infection. Our data reveals that there are dramatic changes in mitochondrial and nuclear proteomes in response to infection. We show that a rapid cytoplasmic leakage of lysosomal proteins, including cathepsins, followed by their secretion, contributes to inflammasome activation and apoptosis seen in the infected macrophages. Also, our results demonstrate that P2X 7 receptor and src tyrosine kinase activity are essential for inflammasome activation during influenza A virus infection. Finally, we show that influenza A virus infection is associated with robust secretion of different danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) suggesting an important role for DAMPs in host response to influenza A virus infection. In conclusion, our high-throughput quantitative proteomics study provides important new insight into host-response against influenza A virus infection in human primary macrophages.",

These viruses are responsible for the annual epidemics that cause severe illnesses in millions of people worldwide. Influenza A virus and secondary bacterial infections can cause lethal pneumonia and encephalopathy especially in elder people. Host defence against influenza A virus infection is initiated by the innate immune system. The principal effector cells involved in innate immunity are macrophages, and dendritic cells (DC) that kill microbes through phagocytosis, present antigens to T cells, and produce cytokines. These innate immune responses are essential for the development of later adaptive immune responses, which provide specific cell-mediated and humoral protection, and are often necessary for a complete clearance of infection.",

            "text": "In viral infections innate immune responses are initiated when viruses or their genetic material is recognized by cellular pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) of the innate immune system [1] . This recognition results in an interferon (IFN)-a/b-mediated antiviral response, as well as activation of pro-inflammatory response and programmed cell death, apoptosis, of infected cells. PRRs involved in activation of antiviral response include Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and Retinoic acid-inducible gene I-like receptors (RLRs) and the coordinated activation of TLRs and RLRs results in proper activation of antiviral response during influenza A virus infection [2, 3] . Influenza A virus infection of human macrophages also results in production of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1b and IL-18 [4, 5] . Both of these cytokines have to be cleaved by cysteine protease caspase-1 to generate the secreted, biologically active forms of these cytokines [6] . Caspase-1 is in turn activated in a cytosolic protein complex called inflammasome [7] . The inflammasomes consist of an adapter molecule called apoptosisassociated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (ASC) and a PRR that belongs to either the nucleotidebinding and oligomerization domain like receptors (NLRs) or the PYHIN receptor gene family. Caspase-1 activating structures include NLRP3, NOD2/NLRP1, NOD2/NLRP3, IPAF/NAIP5, and AIM2 inflammasomes [8, 9] . Recent studies in experimental mice models have shown a critical role of NLRP3 inflammasome in the host response against influenza A virus infection [10] [11] [12] . These studies highlight the importance of IL-1b and IL-18 as mediators of host response to influenza A virus infection. However, the exact mechanism of inflammasome activation during viral infection is not known.",

With modern mass spectrometry (MS) -based approaches it is possible to identify and quantify thousands of proteins from cellular samples, as illustrated by Luber et al. who studied subset-specific viral recognition in dendritic cells [14] . Most of the large scale quantitative proteomics experiments, however, have focused on studying changes in protein abundances in whole cell lysates or individual organelles [14, 15] . The use of subcellular proteomics provides a deeper insight into cellular events as protein abundancies can be studied on the level of different subcellular compartments and also protein translocations between different cell parts can be detected [16, 17] . Moreover, pathway and network analyses can provide mechanistic insights by subsequently linking the proteins found to be differentially regulated to the underlying cellular functions and other key players known to be involved in these events. Here, we have used quantitative subcellular proteomics combined with bioinformatics to provide a global view of host-pathogen-interactions during influenza A virus infection of human primary macrophages.

These viruses are responsible for the annual epidemics that cause severe illnesses in millions of people worldwide. The initial innate immune responses to influenza A viruses have to restrict virus spread before the adaptive immune responses fully develop. Macrophages are the key players of innate immune system and they have a central role in the activation of host response during viral infections. However, the host factors that are involved in the activation of innate immune response during influenza A virus infection are incompletely understood. Here, we have characterized in detail the nuclear, mitochondrial and cytoplasmic proteomes, as well as the secretome from influenza A virus-infected human primary macrophages to get a global view of host factors that are affected by the infection. Our approach allowed us to identify several novel host factors that contribute to innate immune system during influenza A virus infections. These include lysomal proteases cathepsins, P2X 7 receptor, src family tyrosine kinases as well as several dangerassociated molecular patterns.",

Influenza A virus infection of human macrophages clearly induced protein secretion already at 6 h postinfection, and more robust protein secretion was seen at 9 h and 12 h time-points ( Fig. 1C , Table S1 ). Our data shows that influenza A virus infection of macrophages activates both conventional as well as unconventional protein secretion [19] . Examples of the conventionally secreted proteins include e.g. C-C motif chemokine 3, C-C motif chemokine 24, complement C1q subcomponent subunit B, epididymal secretory protein E1, macrophage colony-stimulating factor 1, macrophage metalloelastase, matrix metalloproteinase-9, metalloproteinase inhibitor 2, and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1. The unconventionally secreted proteins include several danger-associated molecular pattern molecules (DAMPs) like amyloid beta A4 protein, annexins, galectins, heat shock proteins, high-mobility group box proteins (HMGBs), and S100 proteins (Table 1) . Enhanced secretion of amyloid beta A4 protein, galectin-3, HMGB1, and S100-A9 protein in response to influenza A virus infection was verified by Western blotting (Fig. S1D ). In addition to DAMPs, secretion of several other proteins known to be secreted through unconventional secretory pathway was enhanced. These include cystatins A and B, macrophage migration inhibitory factor, and thioredoxin. Interestingly, influenza A virus infection of macrophages also activated the secretion of Ras-related proteins Rab- 1A, Rab-2b, Rab-10, and Rab11, as well as several components of vacuolar ATPases (Table 1) . Furthermore, enhanced secretion of several lysosomal proteases, cathepsins, was seen in cell culture supernatants of influenza A virus-infected macrophages.",

Our proteome analysis showed a rapid increase in the amount of cathepsins in the cytoplasm as a result of virus infection. In addition, secretome analysis showed that there is a major increase in the secretion of cathepsins and their regulators in macrophages infected with influenza A virus. To characterize the role of cathepsins in influenza A virus-induced inflammasome activation we performed Western blot analysis which showed that mature 25 kDa cathepsin B and 34 kDa cathepsin D are secreted simultaneously with biologically active p10 form of caspase-1 in response to influenza A virus infection (Fig. 4A ). Next, macrophages were infected in the presence and absence of cathepsin B inhibitors, Ca-074-Me and z-FA-fmk, after which IL-18 secretion was analysed by ELISA. Both Ca-074-Me (Fig. 4B ) and z-FA-fmk (Fig. S3A ) almost completely abolished IL-18 secretion in response to influenza A virus (Udorn/72) infection. This result was confirmed by Western blot analysis of concentrated cell culture supernatants which showed that the appearance of biologically active form of IL-18, IL-18 p18, is abolished in macrophages that have been infected with influenza A virus in the presence of Ca-074-Me (Fig. 4C ). In accordance with these results, we did not detect any caspase-1 p10 in cell culture supernatants after Ca-074-Me treatment (Fig. 4C ). In addition, Ca-074-Me clearly inhibited IL-18 secretion in response to another influenza A H3N2 strain, Beijing 353/89 (Fig. S3B) .

To study the role of cathepsin B in influenza A virus-induced activation of apoptosis, macrophages were infected in the presence and absence of cathepsin B inhibitor, Ca-074-Me, and caspase-3 activation was analysed by Western blotting. Like caspase-1, caspase-3 is a latent zymogen, which is processed upon activation into smaller polypeptide chains: p17 and p12, which in turn form the bioactive enzyme. Influenza A virus (Udorn/72) infection clearly activated the formation of caspase-3 p17/p19 (Fig. 4D) . Furthermore, Ca-074-Me inhibited the formation caspase-3 p17/p19 in response to infuenza A viruses Udorn/72 (Fig. 4D) and Beijing 353/89 (Fig.  S3C ) confirming the role of cathepsins in the activation of apoptosis during infection.

NLPR3 was added to our protein interaction network since it has been shown to be essential for the activation of inflammatory response during influenza A virus infection. Protein interaction network showed that purinenergic P2X 7 receptor is directly linked to NLRP3. P2X 7 receptor has been shown to be involved in NLRP3 activation in response to extracellular ATP [21, 22] , and host tissue damage during influenza A virus infection may result in extracellular leakage of ATP. Therefore we studied the role P2X 7 receptor in virus-induced inflammasome activation. Specific inhibitor for P2X 7 receptor, AZ11645373, clearly diminished IL-18 secretion in infected macrophages (Fig. 5B ). In addition to IL-18, NLRP3 inflammasome regulates the secretion of IL-1b. We have previously shown that influenza A virus infection is not able to induce production of proIL-1b in human macrophages [23] . Therefore we stimulated macrophages with LPS for 18 h to activate proIL-1b production, after which the macrophages were infected with influenza A virus for 9 h in the presence and absence of AZ11645373. This P2X 7 receptor inhibitor almost completely abrogated influenza A virus-induced IL-1b secretion (Fig. 5C ). In addition to pharmacological inhibition, we used small interfering (si)RNA approach to study the role of P2X 7 receptor in influenza A virus-induced inflammasome activation. Human macrophages were treated with control siRNA and P2X 7 receptor specific siRNAs for 24 h after which the cells were left unstimulated or infected with influenza A virus for 9 h. Silencing of P2X 7 receptor clearly reduced influenza A virus-induced IL-18 secretion (Fig. 5D) and Western blot analysis confirmed that P2X 7 receptor protein expression was decreased in P2X 7 receptor siRNA-treated macrophages (Fig. 5E ). In conclusion, our results show that P2X7 receptor is essential for influenza A virus-induced inflammasome activation.",

The development of genome-wide screening techniques such as RNAi has resulted in the identification of hundreds of new host factors that are involved in influenza A virus replication in different cell lines [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] . The cellular responses to influenza infection as well as other respiratory viruses have also been studied using proteomics in human cell lines with both two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) based approach [34] [35] [36] and newer MS-based strategies [37] [38] [39] . These studies have shown that similar cellular pathways are activated in response to different viruses. However, these studies have also pointed out that the cellular responses to influenza infection are in part cell-type specific and more studies using human primary cells are needed to elucidate the host response in detail.",

Also, it requires a lot of manual work and is therefore not suitable for high-throughput studies. Here, we have used unbiased highthroughput subcellular proteomics approach to analyse the host response of human primary macrophages during influenza A virus infection in a global manner. We provide evidence that the expression and/or subcellular localization of more than one thousand host proteins is affected at the early phases of infection. Up-and downregulation of proteins in all subcellular fractions reflects the dynamic interplay between these compartments and highlights the importance of subcellular proteome characterization as many of these changes cannot be seen at total proteome level.",

It is more likely that they activate inflammasome indirectly by inducing changes in endogenous proteins that are recognized as danger signals. In addition to cathepsin activity, potassium efflux and ROS production are the common features associated with NLRP3 inflammasome activation. It was very recently shown that thioredoxin-interacting protein links oxidative stress to inflammasome activation [43] . Our proteomic data shows that there is re-localization of mitochondrial proteins to the cytoplasm already at 6 h after influenza A virus infection. These proteins contained several components of the inner mitochondrial membrane including proteins involved in electron transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation. The results suggest that there is a substantial change and/or damage in mitochondrial structure at early phases of influenza A virus infection which may contribute to reactive oxygen species production during infection. This is likely to contribute to the inflammasome activation and apoptosis seen in influenza A virus-infected macrophages. Our current results clearly show that src tyrosine kinase activity is essential for inflammasome activation in response to influenza A virus infection: src kinase specific inhibitors PP2 (Fig. 5 F and G) and src kinase inhibitor II (data not shown) abolished influenza A virusinduced secretion of IL-1b and IL-18. It has also been recently shown that src tyrosine kinase Lyn plays a critical role in the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome in response to malarial hemozoin [44] . Src tyrosine kinases are responsible for the regulation of ROS formation through NADPH oxidase complex [27] . Activation of src tyrosine kinases results in phosphorylation of its substrates Tks4 and Tks5. These proteins act as molecular organizers that specifically activate NADPH oxidases resulting in ROS formation [45] . In conclusion, our results demonstrate a novel link between src tyrosine kinase activity, ROS formation, and inflammasome activation during viral infections.",

Lysosomal proteases cathepsins are known to act in concert with caspases in apoptotic cell death [46] . Our current data shows that influenza A virus infection of human macrophages is associated with rapid cytoplasmic upregulation of cathepsins indicating lysosomal rupture upon infection.

These proteins contain signal peptides that direct their transport to the plasma membrane through the ER-Golgi pathway. In our experiments, many classically secreted proteins were detected in cell culture supernatants of macrophages in response to influenza A virus infection. In addition to classical protein secretion, activated immune cells secrete proteins lacking signal peptides through unconventional secretory pathway [47] . DAMPs are nuclear or cytosolic proteins with defined intracellular functions [48] . They are usually hidden in intact cells and released during tissue damage through unconventional protein secretion pathway. Our quantitative high-throughput secretome analysis revealed secretion of several DAMPs in response to influenza A virus infection. These included 50 kDa cleavage product of amyloid precursor protein, HMGBs, galectins, and S100 proteins. Amyloid precursor protein is processed by a-, band c-secretases to generate inflammatory amyloid b peptide [49] . Fibrillogenic amyloid b peptide 42 (Ab 42 ) is a known activator of NLRP3 inflammasome in migroglial cells [50] and it is involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease [51] . We were not able to control siRNA and P2X 7 receptor specific siRNAs for 24 h after which the cells were left unstimulated or infected with influenza A virus for 9 h. IL-18 secretion was analyzed from cell culture supernatants with IL-18 ELISA. E. P2X 7 receptor expression was analyzed by Western blotting with anti-P2X 7 specific Abs. F. Macrophages were infected with influenza A virus for 9 h in the presence and absence of PP2 (5 mM), after which the cell culture media was collected and analyzed with IL-18 ELISA. G. Macrophages were primed with LPS for 18 h, after which the macrophages were left untreated or treated with PP2 and infected with influenza A virus for 9 h. The cell culture supernatants were analyzed with IL-1b ELISA. doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1001340.g005 detect secretion of Ab 42 by ELISA in influenza A virus-infected macrophages (data not shown). However, the secretome data showed that amyloid precursor protein is expressed, processed, and secreted in response to influenza A virus infection. In addition, subcellular proteomics data demonstrates that nicastrin and preselinin, which are components of c-secretases are expressed in human macrophages. This finding suggests that b-amyloid protein and its processing machinery have a specific function in antiviral response.",

HMGBs operate upstream of cytoplasmic RLRs and endosomal TLRs and they are essential for nucleic acidinduced activation of innate immune response. In our experiments both HMGB1 and HMGB2 were detected in cell culture supernatants of influenza A virus-infected macrophages. These results suggest that HMGBs have an important role in the activation of innate immune response to influenza A virus infection. Our proteomics approach showed also increased secretion of galectin-3 in response to influenza A virus infection. This finding is especially interesting since galectins are known to bind extracellularly carbohydrate structures and the envelope of influenza A virus contains two glycoproteins, hemagglutinin and neuraminidase. Hemagglutinin is required for influenza A virus entry, and it can be speculated that the extracellular galectins restrict viral entry. It is easy to envision that secreted galectins may have also other functions in antiviral response since there is ample evidence about the role of galectins in innate immunity to bacterial and fungal infections [53] . Clearly, future studies are required to characterize the importance of galectins in viral infections.",
