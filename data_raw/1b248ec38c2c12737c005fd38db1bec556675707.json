            "text": "Vaccinia virus (VACV) is a large, cytoplasmic, double-stranded DNA virus that requires complex interactions with host proteins in order to replicate. To explore these interactions a functional high throughput small interfering RNA (siRNA) screen targeting 6719 druggable cellular genes was undertaken to identify host factors (HF) influencing the replication and spread of an eGFP-tagged VACV. The experimental design incorporated a low multiplicity of infection, thereby enhancing detection of cellular proteins involved in cell-to-cell spread of VACV. The screen revealed 153 pro-and 149 anti-viral HFs that strongly influenced VACV replication. These HFs were investigated further by comparisons with transcriptional profiling data sets and HFs identified in RNAi screens of other viruses. In addition, functional and pathway analysis of the entire screen was carried out to highlight cellular mechanisms involved in VACV replication. This revealed, as anticipated, that many pro-viral HFs are involved in translation of mRNA and, unexpectedly, suggested that a range of proteins involved in cellular transcriptional processes and several DNA repair pathways possess anti-viral activity. Multiple components of the AMPK complex were found to act as pro-viral HFs, while several septins, a group of highly conserved GTP binding proteins with a role in sequestering intracellular bacteria, were identified as strong anti-viral VACV HFs. This screen has identified novel and previously unexplored roles for cellular factors in poxvirus replication. This advancement in our understanding of the VACV life cycle provides a reliable knowledge base for the improvement of poxvirus-based vaccine vectors and development of anti-viral theraputics.",

It is the prototypical member of the orthopoxviridae genus of the Poxviridae family which includes Variola virus (the causative agent of smallpox), Monkeypox virus and Ectromelia virus. VACV was used as a vaccine in the successful global eradication of smallpox in the 20 th century and closely related attenuated strains such as Modified Vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) are now some of the most frequently used recombinant vaccine vectors against a variety of human and animal diseases including HIV, malaria and tuberculosis [1] . Understanding the VACV life cycle is therefore important since it provides the base for the development of efficient and safe novel vaccines.",

These were stored at 280uC until needed (maximum 48 h). On the day of transfection, plates were thawed and 10 ml transfection reagent (Dharmafect 1, Dharmacon) diluted in Hank's buffered saline solution (HBSS, Thermo-Fisher) was added to each well containing siRNA using a Multidrop 384 (ThermoFisher), to give a final transfection reagent concentration of 0.1%. Plates were incubated for 20 min at room temperature to allow formation of transfection complexes. During complex formation, low-passage (p20-22) HeLa cells (ECACC) from approximately 50% confluent flasks were washed in PBS and trypsinised in Trypsin-EDTA (Lonza) before diluting in phenol red-free, antibiotic-free transfection medium (DMEM/F-12 1:1 with 5% FCS, 15 mM Hepes and L-glu; Gibco). 3610 3 cells in a volume of 40 ml were added to each well using the Multidrop 384. Plates were incubated for 48 h at 37uC in a humidified incubator with 5% CO 2 before infection. To infect, media was removed from plates by inversion, and 15 ml media (DMEM +4.5 g/L Dglucose, L-glu and pyruvate with 2.5% FCS and penicillinstreptomycin) or 15 ml media containing VACV strain WR with eGFP tagged A5 protein [16] diluted to MOI 0.05, was added using the Multidrop 384. Plates were incubated at 37uC for 1 h before 50 ml of media was added to each well, the plates inverted to remove the media and virus, and a final volume of 50 ml of media added to the plates before they were returned to the incubator. After 48 h the plates were inverted to remove the media and 50 ml of 10% buffered formal saline added to fix the cells. Fluorescence levels were measured using a POLARstar OPTIMA plate reader (BMG Labtech). Data from eight replicates was used for analysis. Background intensity correction was carried out by subtracting the median value of uninfected wells and the data was normalised using the robust Z score method [17] , and corrected for the number of cells in each well. The correction for the number of cells in each well was carried out by estimating the linear correlation coefficient between the level of fluorescence (phenotype score) and the number of cells (toxicity score) using least squares optimization. This coefficient was used to linearly adjust the phenotype scores.",

This library targets genes that are considered potential candidates for therapeutics ( Figure 1a) . Briefly, SMARTpool siRNAs (a mix of 4 siRNAs per gene) targeting 6 719 genes were distributed into 384-well plates and reverse-transfected into HeLa cells. Cells were infected 48 h post-transfection at a low multiplicity of infection (MOI 0.05) with the VACV strain VACV-A5eGFP. After 48 h (thus allowing multiple complete virus replication cycles), eGFP fluorescence was quantified as a measure of infection and compared to controls in order to determine the effect of individual gene depletion on VACV replication. Two positive siRNA controls known to downregulate VACV-A5eGFP growth (targeting PRK-AB1 and eGFP), two negative controls (mock transfection and RSCF siRNA which is not processed by the RISC machinery) and two nonspecific siRNAs (targeting VP16 or VP11/12 from Herpes simplex virus type 1) were included in duplicate in each plate (Figure 1b) . To confirm that the measurement of virus-expressed fluorescence was a reliable marker of viral replication, fluorescence was correlated to virus-titre, as determined by standard plaque assay, over a range of time-points post-infection after treatment with control or inhibitory siRNAs (Figure 1c) . This resulted in a Pearson product moment correlation coefficient of 0.86, confirming that fluorescence was a reliable determinant of virus replication. The entire druggable screen was repeated four times in duplicate to generate a robust primary data set of eight replicates. Pairwise agreement comparing the levels of fluorescence across the eight replicates revealed good reproducibility (median Spearman's coefficient 0.55). One replicate of the VACVinfected cells was analysed by automated microscopy using an OPERA high content screening system and Acapella High Content Imaging and Analysis software to quantify the number of cells present in each well. A total of 403 siRNA pools (6% of the total) were associated with a significant reduction in cell number (Figure 1a) .

A negative z-score indicated a reduction in VACV replication and a positive z-score indicated an increase in VACV replication (Figure 1d ). The two positive controls (siRNA targeting PRKAB1 and eGFP) produced strongly negative z-scores as expected. The median level of fluorescence (z-score of 0) was very close to the level of fluorescence seen in wells transfected with the non-specific siRNA (negative control), indicating that roughly half of the siRNA pools caused an increase in fluorescence and half caused a decrease. A ''hit'' was defined as a siRNA pool which generated a z-score of $2 or #-2. Using these criteria, a hitlist of 302 HFs (4.5% of the total) was generated, consisting of 153 pro-viral HFs which inhibited replication upon depletion and 149 anti-viral HFs which increased replication upon depletion ( Table S2 in File S1).",

Only 30% of the anti-viral hits (7/24) were successfully validated in comparison to 69% of the pro-viral hits (24/35) and 54% of the siRNA pools with no effect in the primary screen (7/13). One potential reason for the lower validation rate of the anti-viral hits might be that the dynamic range of the virus replication assay is such that inhibitory effects are more easily demonstrated, as under normal replication conditions virtually all cells in the well became infected by 48 h post infection (data not shown) suggesting the system reached near saturation. To examine this further, the effect of selected siRNAs on traditional viral growth curves was tested and correlated with their perturbation of fluorescence in the primary screen. HeLa cells were transfected with each one of 6 siRNA SMARTpools (upregulatory MAP3K14, control VP16, and downregulatory TRIP, PPAP2A, VPS52 and CCT7) and infected with VACV-A5eGFP at an MOI of 0.05 after 48 h. Analysis of virus titre at 12 h intervals by plaque assay found the endpoint titres correlated very closely with the z-score obtained from the primary RNAi screen (Figure 2) , further validating the robustness of the primary screen. Notably, however, whilst the inhibitory siRNAs decreased the maximum virus titre by between 13-(CCT7) and 5-fold (VPS52) the siRNA treatment directed against a candidate antiviral HF (MAP3K14) only increased peak virus titre by 3-fold. Thus the response of the system is more suited to detecting inhibitory perturbation, with relatively reduced sensitivity for detection of individual anti-viral HFs.",

The methodology in the previously published VACV screens varied considerably; Mercer et al [32] measured the growth of a thymidine-kinase-deficient VACV (strain Western Reserve) after only 8 h of infection, thereby identifying cellular proteins involved in the initial stages of virus replication but excluding analysis of viral spread. They reported 188 pro-viral HF but no anti-viral HFs. A second screen by Sivan et al [38] used the VACV strain IHD-J (which has a point mutation that accelerates the release of progeny virions from the cell surface) to identify genes which influenced viral replication after 18 h of infection, thus measuring the entire replication cycle with emphasis on viral spread. They reported 576 pro-viral and 530 anti-viral HFs. The overlap between the hit lists reported by the three VACV RNAi studies (Mercer et al, Sivan et al, and this study) is depicted in Figure 3a and b and the HFs common to two studies are listed in Table S5 in File S1. The number of overlapping hits between two of the screens ranged from 3 to 13 and no HFs were common to all three VACV studies. A small number of common hits between siRNA screens of the same virus is a frequent finding [39, 40] and, given the variation in methodology between the three VACV screens (including viral strain, infection time, and data analysis), is not surprising. However, comparison of the enriched functions and pathways identified in each of the three VACV screens revealed marked similarities (discussed below), demonstrating the power of comparative screening approaches to identify significant cellular pathways involved in virus replication.",

It is located at both the cytoplasmic and the nuclear faces of the central channel of the nuclear pore complex (NPC) [48] , is involved in Rev-dependent RNA export during HIV infection [49] , and has been shown to play both proand anti-viral functions during influenza A virus infection [31, 50, 51] . NUP98 was a somewhat unexpected proviral hit in our screen since poxvirus replication and assembly occur in the cytoplasm. However the two VACV RNAi screens published recently also identified a number of nuclear pore proteins as proviral, with one screen demonstrating that knockdown of NUP62 strongly inhibited viral morphogenesis [38] . The number of nuclear pore proteins now identified as pro-viral HFs strongly suggests poxviruses require functional nuclear membrane transport for efficient replication.",

Three available expression profiling data sets (designated A, B and C, see Materials and Methods for sources) which used different cells, virus isolates and time points were compiled and compared. Correlation was mainly limited to intra-data set measurements (i.e. different time points or cell lines within a data set) with some examples of agreement between data sets A and C, both of which used HeLa cells. To test whether there was a general propensity of HFs to be differentially expressed in virus-infected cells the distribution of the 302 RNAi hits was compared to that of the whole RNAi screen in these three transcriptional profiling data sets. No significant tendency of proviral HFs to be up-regulated or anti-viral HFs to be downregulated was detected (data not shown). Subsequently the expression of individual HFs was examined using the transcriptional profiling data of the two HeLa-based studies (A and C). This revealed specific examples of HFs which are differentially expressed in virus-infected cells (Figure 4) . Four pro-viral HFs (RUNX1, eIF3C, HBEGF, and ADM) were significantly upregulated in VACV-infected HeLa cells (q,0.05), suggesting that VACV might promote expression of these proteins to assist viral replication and spread. RUNX1 is a subunit of the transcription factor CBF which regulates critical processes in both myeloid and lymphatic haematopoiesis. Chromosomal translocations and mutations of RUNX1 are among the most frequent genomic abnormalities in different types of leukaemia [57] . Furthermore, a genome-wide association study found a genetic polymorphism in RUNX1 to be associated with the serological response to VACV vaccination (Dryvax vaccine, Wyeth Laboratories) in African-Americans. This suggests that the RUNX1 polymorphism may influence replication and viral gene expression of the live-attenuated vaccine in vivo which causes differences in the strength of the adaptive immune response [58] , a hypothesis supported by our identification of RUNX1 as a pro-viral VACV HF.",

Translation was the most strongly enriched theme in all these analyses, particularly the eIF3 complex. Poxviruses are known to utilise the host translation machinery for production of viral proteins therefore the enrichment of translation as a pro-viral theme is a validation of the screening method.

            "text": "More interestingly, transcriptional initiation and general RNA polymerase II transcription factor activity were identified in the functional analysis of the RNAi screen as significantly overrepresented anti-viral GO-based gene sets (Figure 5b) . Sevin et al [38] also reported that interference with DNA-dependent RNA polymerase II pathways enhanced VACV spread. Our work identified individual anti-viral HFs involved in transcription such as MAZ (an inflammatory responsive transcription factor also known as SAF1), and the transcription factor E2F2. Inspection of individual confocal images taken at 48 h pi of cells depleted of these factors showed notably brighter accumulations of eGFPlabelled virus, in line with the positive z-scores from the overall primary screen (Figure 6a ). Orthopoxvirus infection results in a rapid shut down of cellular transcription, with a marked reduction in the amount of host mRNA present as early as 2 h post infection [25, 59, 60] . This effect is believed to result from cessation of host mRNA synthesis and degradation of cellular mRNA transcripts. The viral proteins involved in this shut-off of host cell transcription have not been identified, although D9 and D10 have been implicated [61, 62] . In contrast to viral translation which is dependent on host proteins, VACV encodes its own transcription enzymes so is largely unaffected by a general repression of cellular transcription [63] . Therefore VACV-induced downregulation of host transcription prevents the host cell from transcribing antiviral, pro-inflammatory gene programmes, such as the NF-kB cascade, while having a minimal negative effect on viral [21] and PIN [22] databases. All significantly overrepresented gene sets (-log 10 (q-value).0.1) are shown. Each row shows the ranks of genes from a particular gene set that were present in the RNAi screen. Each tick mark denotes the place of a particular gene from that gene set, placed at the appropriate position in the distribution. Genes were sorted from left to right from most pro-viral to most anti-viral. The red and blue colours of the ticks are used for visual contrast. A green diamond is used to denote the median rank of the genes in the set. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0098431.g005",

MSF/septin 9 co-purifies from cells with three other septin proteins (NEDD5/septin 2, CDC10/septin 7 and septin 11), suggesting they form a functional complex [64] . These were therefore grouped in the pathway analysis, resulting in a significant over representation (q = 0.1) (Figure 5c) . Consistent with this, depletion of NEDD5/septin 2, septin 7 and septin 11 all increased virus replication although not to the stringent cut-off used here to define a 'hit' (Figure 6b) . Deconvoluted siRNAs targeting septin 11 mRNA confirmed the enhancement of virus replication, although results with the other family members were more variable ( Table S4 in File S1). Septin 11 has also been identified as a proviral hit in a recently reported VACV siRNA screen [38] . Septins are conserved GTP-binding proteins which act as dynamic scaffolds for recruitment of other proteins. They are involved in actin and microtubule function, cytokinesis, cell movement and vesicle trafficking [65] . Interestingly, they can be recruited together with autophagic proteins to ''cage'' Shigella flexneri in the cytosol of infected cells, restricting bacterial dissemination [66] . The cage assembly is linked with actin polymerisation activity of S. flexneri, suggesting that a similar mechanism may be employed by the host cell to ''cage'' VACV virions (which activate actin polymerisation both early and late in the replication cycle [67, 68] ) and thus invoke an anti-viral effect.",

The PCNA-MutSa-MutLa-DNA complex (PCNA, MSH2, PMS2, and MLH1) and the BRCA1-associated genome surveillance complex (RFC4, BRCA1, BLM, RFC1, MSH2 and MLH1) both promoted virus replication when individual group members were downregulated (Figure 6c ). These pathways are both involved in DNA damage signalling and repair [69, 70] , a cellular process which is targeted by numerous viruses [71] . Specifically, DNA damage signalling pathways act as a host defence mechanism in poxvirus infection, detecting and responding to foreign poxviral DNA and inducing intrinsic apoptosis [72] . The identification of the PCNA and BRCA1 gene sets as strongly anti-poxviral HFs in the RNAi screen suggests they are a part of this, or a similar, defence mechanism.",

It is activated by a reduction in ATP which prompts phosphorylation of many target proteins, resulting in the activation of catabolic pathways and inhibition of anabolic pathways [73] . It has also been linked to regulation of the actin cytoskeleton [74] . AMPK is a heterotrimer comprising a catalytic a subunit and regulatory b and c subunits. In mammals each subunit has several isoforms (PRKAA1, PRKAA2, PRKAB1, PRKAB2, PRKAG1, PRKAG2, and PRKAG3) [73] . The druggable RNAi screen reported here screened all seven genes and identified three (PRKAA2, PRKAB1, and PRKAB2) as promoters of VACV replication whose depletion led to fewer and dimmer accumulations of cytoplasmic eGFP (Figure 6d ). This result is in broad agreement with a recently published RNAi screen of 440 cellular kinases and phosphatases in a nonpermissive Drosophila cell model of VACV infection [36] , which identified seven hits including three AMPK subunits.",

In addition, however, a range of novel host pathways and proteins were identified that influenced VACV infection, such as the DNA damage and repair pathways, the septin family of proteins, MAP2K3 and NUP98. As many of the genes targeted in this RNAi screen have a known drug inhibitor, this work yields a list of HFs that can potentially be targeted by novel therapeutics.",
