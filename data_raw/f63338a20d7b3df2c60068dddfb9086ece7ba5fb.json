To ameliorate the effects of future outbreaks as well as to prepare for biodefense, a process for the production of a recombinant protein vaccine candidate is under development. Previously, we reported the 5 L scale expression and purification of a promising recombinant SARS vaccine candidate, RBD219-N1, the 218-amino acid residue receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS coronavirus expressed in yeast-Pichia pastoris X-33. When adjuvanted with aluminum hydroxide, this protein elicited high neutralizing antibody titers and high RBD-specific antibody titers. However, the yield of RBD219-N1 (60 mg RBD219-N1 per liter of fermentation supernatant; 60 mg/L FS) still required improvement to reach our target of >100 mg/L FS. In this study, we optimized the 10 L scale production process and increased the fermentation yield 6-to 7-fold to 400 mg/ L FS with purification recovery >50%. A panel of characterization tests indicated that the process is reproducible and that the purified, tag-free RBD219-N1 protein has high purity and a well-defined This is an open access article under the CC BY license structure and is therefore a suitable candidate for production under current Good Manufacturing Practice and future phase-1 clinical trials.",

            "text": "In the past decade, several different antigens have been identified and developed as SARS vaccine candidates, including inactivated whole virus, the SARS S protein, and the receptorbinding domain (RBD) of the S protein. Initially, vaccines containing inactivated whole virus adjuvanted with Alhydrogel \u00ae were developed 1 ; however, eosinophilic pathology was observed in mice, likely due to antibody-dependent immune enhancement (ADE). 2, 3 Later, vaccines using the recombinant S protein of SARS-CoV were developed, 1 but the full-length S-protein still seemed to induce ADE. 4 As an alternative approach, the RBD of the S protein has been developed as a substitute for the full-length S protein. 5, 6 Recombinant RBD formulated with Freund's adjuvant and with Sigma adjuvant system \u00ae (monophosphoryl-lipid A and trehalose dicorynomycolate adjuvant) has been shown to elicit neutralizing antibodies and highly protective immunity in vaccinated animals while significantly reducing or eliminating ADE and other harmful inflammatory and immune responses. [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] However, these recombinant wild-type RBD proteins had only been expressed at small scale in Escherichia coli, insect cells (Sf9), and mammalian cells (293T, CHO-K1). 5, 7, 8, 11, 12 In addition, these wild-type proteins were either tagged with a hexahistidine sequence and purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography 7, 8, 12 or tagged with an Fc fragment and purified by protein A chromatography. 5, 11 Although tags simplify the purification process, they usually serve no purpose in the final product and may potentially cause unwanted immune responses and raise safety concerns. Thus, they are generally not considered desirable for use in human therapeutic proteins. ability to induce a stronger RBD-specific antibody response and a high level of neutralizing antibodies in immunized mice when adjuvanted with aluminum hydroxide. The designation N1 refers to the fact that the first amino acid (residue 318) was deleted to avoid glycosylation at the N-terminus. 14 However, the default production process used for RBD219-N1 still had several areas that could be improved or optimized before translating to a suitable pilot manufacturing scale. These included improving the fermentation yield and purification recovery, as the fermentation yield using the default process was only 60 mg RBD219-N1/L of fermentation supernatant (FS) and the purification process had not been optimized. In this study, we optimized the upstream process to generate a fermentation yield of approximately 400 mg RBD219-N1/L FS. The purification process was also optimized to a final recovery exceeding 50 percent. This final optimized production process was validated in 3 identical production runs, and an array of characterization procedures for the process indicated high reproducibility and robustness. Further characterization of the purified RBD219-N1 demonstrated that the protein was highly pure with well-defined secondary and tertiary structures. The process has since been transferred to a pilot manufacturing plant and a 60 L scale manufacture has been performed under current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP). The cGMP grade-purified RBD219-N1 (drug substance) is to be used in support of future phase-1 trials.",

Following the small-scale screening, 5-10 L fermentation runs were performed under different induction conditions, such as pH (6.0 and 6.5), temperature (24-30\u00b0C), carbon feeds (sorbitol co-feed), methanol flow rate, and fermentation media (basal salt media or low salt media 15 [LS; 4.55 g/L potassium sulfate, 3.73 g/L magnesium sulfate heptahydrate, 1.03 g/L potassium hydroxide, 0.23 g/L calcium sulfate dehydrate, 10.9 mL/L phosphoric acid {85%}, and 40 g/L glycerol]). The default fermentation procedure was described in the previous study 13 and used to generate a baseline to compare with the optimized fermentation procedure developed here. One milliliter of seed stock was inoculated into 500 mL buffered minimal glycerol medium, and the culture was incubated overnight at 30\u00b0 C with constant shaking at 250 rpm until an OD600 of \u223c10. Approximately 250 mL overnight culture was inoculated into 5 L sterile LS medium containing 3.5 mL/L PTM1 Trace Elements and 3.5 mL/L 0.02% D-Biotin. Fermentation was initiated and maintained at 30\u00b0 C and pH 5.0. Gas and agitation were adjusted to maintain the dissolved oxygen concentration at 30%. On exhaustion of glycerol during the batch phase (dissolved oxygen spike), the pH was ramped up to 6.5 using 14% ammonium hydroxide, and the temperature was lowered to 25\u00b0 C over 1 h. After the pH and temperature ramping, the methanol induction phase was initiated. Methanol was added from 1 mL/L/h to 11 mL/L/h over 6 h. After this methanol adaptation phase, the methanol feed was maintained at 11 mL/L/h for 18 h, elevated from 11 to 13 mL/L/h over 6 h and then maintained at 13 mL/L/h for 18 h. Finally, the methanol feed rate was further increased from 13 to 15 mL/L/h over 6 h and maintained at 15 mL/L/h until the end of fermentation (\u223c70 h of methanol induction). After fermentation, cells were removed from the culture by centrifugation at 7000 rpm for 30 min at 4\u00b0C using a Beckman Avanti J-26 XPI High-Speed Centrifuge equipped with a JLA 8.1000 rotor. After centrifugation, the wet cell weight was measured and the supernatant was used for further purification.",

Initially, bovine serum albumin (BSA) with known concentrations was used as the standard for quantitative analysis by densitometry but was eventually replaced with purified RBD219-N1 after it became available. After electrophoresis, the SDS-PAGE gels were stained with Coomassie Blue and scanned using a GE ImageScanner II with the Image Quant software version 8.1. After the concentration of RBD219-N1 in each in-process sample had been quantified, various volumes of in-process samples which contained approximately 3 \u03bcg RBD219-N1 were loaded on 4%-20% Tris glycine gels to determine the process purity using densitometry, as described previously. In these experiments, we observed that equal amounts of BSA and RBD219-N1, as determined by spectrophotometry, react differently with Coomassie Blue. In fact, RBD219-N1 appears to bind Coomassie 1.33 times less than BSA. Thus, we have used this conversion factor when appropriate (Supplementary Table S1 ). Finally, host cell protein (HCP) content in the in-process samples was analyzed using a slot blot assay as described previously with minor procedure changes. 16, 17 A log-log plot of HCP intensity versus known HCP concentration was graphed and the HCP concentration of the in-process samples was calculated using the linear regression from the plot.",

The final wet cell weight remained consistent (410 \u00b1 50 mg/mL), suggesting that culture growth was robust during independent fermentation runs with 2 different seed stocks. However, the yield of RBD219-N1 in the fermentation supernatant varied significantly depending on which seed stock was used. (We note that the yield of RBD219-N1 also varied for each fermentation run when comparing the quantification by densitometry with BSA standards vs. quantification by densitometry with purified RBD219-N1 standard; to account for this discrepancy, a conversion factor of 1.33 was used as addressed in the Materials and Methods section.) Before optimization, the fermentation yield using the default process and default seed stock was 60 mg RBD219-N1/L of FS. After the optimization of the seed stock, the default fermentation process yielded 95 mg RBD219-N1/L FS, a 1.6-fold increase compared with the default seed stock. Using the default seed stock with the optimized fermentation process, the yield also increased 1.5-fold to 93 mg RBD219-N1/L FS. Finally, combining the optimized seed stock with the optimized fermentation process, the yield increased significantly to 409 mg RBD219-N1/L FS, a more than 6-fold increase compared with the original yield.",

The HCP content was also analyzed using slot blot, a more sensitive method (Table 3b ). The low purity of the target protein (67% under nonreducing conditions or 53% under reducing conditions) in the FS as determinedby densitometry using purified RBD219-N1 (Fig. 1c) , was likely due to heavy contamination with host cell impurities and hyperglycosylated RBD (Figs.1a and 1b, lane 1) . To purify the target protein, the FS was first filtered through a 0.22 mm PES filter and then concentrated 3-to 4fold by tangential flow filtration (TFF; Figs.1a and 1b, lane 2) . At this first TFF step, the high recovery of 98% suggested that the loss of target protein was insignificant and that the purity of the concentrated target protein in the FS was unchanged. After the first TFF step, ammonium sulfate was added to the concentrated FS to adjust the salt concentration to 2 M. This concentrated FS was centrifuged, and the supernatant was loaded to a hydrophobic interaction chromatography Butyl HP column (HIC). In the HIC step, recovery was 67%, the purity of the RBD219-N1 in the HIC elution pool increased to 86% under nonreducing conditions and 84% under reducing conditions (Figs.1a and 1b, lane 3) , and 92% of HCPs were also removed. The eluted pool was further concentrated to reduce the loading volume by 20-fold using a second TFF step (post-HIC TFF). During this post-HIC TFF step (Figs. 1a and 1b, lane 4) , the recovery dropped from 67.0% to 60.3% without a change in purity. Finally, the Post-HIC TFF pool was loaded onto a SEC75 column (SEC) to remove hyperglycosylated proteins (Figs.1a and 1b, lane 5) . After the SEC run, the overall recovery was determined to be 52%, and the purity of the final product was approximately 99% under nonreducing and reducing conditions; the slot blot also indicated that 99.9988% of HCPs were removed, and the final purified product contained approximately 0.5 mg HCP/mg RBD219-N1.

            "text": "In preclinical testing, the recombinant RBD of the SARS-CoV S protein adjuvanted with Freund's adjuvant and with Sigma adjuvant system \u00ae has been proven as an effective and safe vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV infection. [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] 24 Evidence for efficacy and low immunopathology include the induction of high titers of neutralizing antibodies, the prevention of infection against viral challenge, and the minimization orablation of ADE. [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] However, all the previously reported studies used recombinant RBDs containing heterologous amino acids (either tagged with a hexahistidine sequence or fused to the Fc domain), mainly for ease of purification purposes. 5, 7, 8, 11, 12 The addition of hexahistidine or other tags in therapeutic proteins though is usually not favored for eventual advanced clinical development by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and should be avoided when feasible. Thus, we had engineered a tag-free RBD expressed in yeast (RBD219-N1) that when adjuvanted with aluminum hydroxide induced strong RBD-specific antibody responses and a high level of neutralizing antibodies in immunized mice. 13 To optimize the production process and improve yield and purity, improvements to clone selection and seed stock preparation, fermentation, and purification have been performed in this work. To optimize the seed stock, we first reselected the seed stock using increased antibiotic concentrations. The default fermentation process using this optimized seed stock showed a 1.6-fold increase compared with using the default seed stock. Likely, the increased antibiotic concentrations helped select for an increased copy number of the RBD219-N1 expressing plasmid, a process that had previously been shown to improve the expression levels of other recombinant proteins in yeast. [25] [26] [27] To optimize the production process, a series of 5-10 mL scale cultures was used to screen for the best induction temperature, pH, and the possible need for additives (e.g., detergents to disrupt aggregates). Following this, optimizations at the 5-10 L fermentation scale were performed to evaluate other parameters, such as different carbon feeds, methanol flow rate, and fermentation media. Through a change of the fermentation medium to LS 15 and minor adjustments to the induction pH (to 6.5) and the induction temperature (to 25\u00b0C), the overall fermentation yield was improved more than 6-fold.",

            "text": "With respect to the purification process, as the binding of the HIC column was low (<0.49 mg RBD219-N1/mL Butyl HP) in the default process, 13 we aimed to optimize binding of the target protein to the HIC column. To this extent, several parameters were investigated including resin type, salt choice for the binding buffer, and concentration of the fermentation supernatant loaded onto the column. During the optimization, Capto Butyl resin (particle size 75 \u03bcm) and Butyl HP resin (particle size 34 \u03bcm) were compared, and Butyl HP was chosen on account of its better resolution and better ability to remove impurities. Because the RBD219-N1 in the default process was the last protein eluted from the HIC column using an ammonium sulfate gradient, 2 environmentally more friendly salts with lower ionic strength, sodium sulfate and sodium chloride, were investigated. However, neither salt provided the same high binding affinity and resolution achieved with ammonium sulfate. Finally, the concentration of the sample before application to the column was optimized. Rather than diluting the fermentation supernatant with buffer containing a high concentration of ammonium sulfate as described previously, 13 we first concentrated the fermentation supernatant and then dissolved solid ammonium sulfate directly into the sample. This process increased the binding more than 9-fold, which reduced the required resin volume. However, to accommodate the high back pressure due to the smaller resin particle size and the higher viscosity of the more concentrated loading material, the flow rate had to be decreased from 100 to 50 cm/h with the bed height maintained at 11 \u00b1 2 cm. Finally, to meet the industry standard for technology transfer, gradient elution for the HIC process was converted to stepwise elution. Although SEC columns are not ideal for largescale processes, we decided to retain this step because it efficiently removed the remaining impurities. Intensive efforts were spent on the investigation of alternative purification schemes, including different capture, intermediate, or polishing steps (ion exchange, multimodel, etc.), but the recovery was low and the final product lacked sufficient purity.",

Although BSA has served as a common standard for several commercially available quantitative assays (e.g., the BCA assay) due to its high purity and easy availability, using a homologous standard is often preferred on account of protein-specific differential uptake of Coomassie Blue dye. 23 Depending on the protein, Coomassie Blue reacts differently with each protein, which may cause intensity difference, even for the same protein concentration. In our case, RBD219-N1 only stained 75 \u00b1 5% as efficient as BSA, leading to an underestimation of the protein concentration. The optimized quantitative densitometry assay was used to calculate the process recovery and the process yield. Typically, overall production yield of a recombinant protein relies on fermentation yield and purification recovery. Depending on the gene sequence and the size of the expressed protein, fermentation yield of a recombinant protein successfully expressed in yeast can vary dramatically ranging from 20 mg/L to 14.8 g/L, 26, 28, 29 and biophysical properties of the expressed protein determine the purification process and the recovery. For a 10-20 L scale production of subunit vaccine candidates expressed in yeast, the fermentation yield can range from 150 mg/L to 1 g/L with recovery of 31% to 55% and target protein purity of 97% to 99%. 18, 30, 31 The optimized production process for RBD219-N1 has consistently and reproducibly provided high yields during fermentation (\u223c400 mg RBD219-N1/L FS), with an overall process recovery more than 50% (final purification yield of 226 mg RBD/L FS) and protein purity of \u223c 99%, which suggests the production process is comparable to other subunit vaccine production processes at similar scale.",

Using silver-stained SDS-PAGE, trace amounts of low molecular weight degradation products or host cell proteins were observed, whereas dimers were observed on Western blot, likely stemming from intermolecular disulfide bonds between the remaining free cysteine of RBD219-N1. Although only trace amounts of nontarget proteins were observed, highly sensitive assays allow increased ability to monitor the integrity and purity of the product that will ensure the level of degradation and aggregation does not increase and cause stability issues. Surface hydrophobicity of RBD219-N1 was also studied using extrinsic fluorescence of Nile Red. It is noted that surface hydrophobicity of RBD219-N1 remained unchanged at pH 5.0-9.5; however, an increase of surface hydrophobicity was observed at pH 4.0, which suggested possible denaturation, thus exposure of hydrophobic sites. Furthermore, DLS experiments on samples at pH 4.0 and 5.0 also indicated protein aggregation. Negative diffusion interaction parameter measured by DLS showed the propensity of oligomer formation or aggregation for all the pH tested, indicating extra attention should be taken for its long-term stability. Collectively, the results obtained from extrinsic fluorescence and DLS experiments suggested RBD219-N1 was most likely stable at pH 6.5-9.5 but instable at pH 4.0 and 5.0, which indicates any formulation at lower pH (>pH 5.0) should be avoided.",
