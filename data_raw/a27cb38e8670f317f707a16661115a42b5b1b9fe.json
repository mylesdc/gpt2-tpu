The possible use of smallpox as a bioterrorism agent as well as the continuous occurrence of zoonotic pox virus infections document the relevance to deepen the understanding for virus host interactions. Since the permissiveness of pox infections is independent of hosts surface receptors, but correlates with the ability of the virus to infiltrate the antiviral host response, it directly depends on the hosts proteome set. In this report the proteome of HEK293 cells infected with Vaccinia Virus strain IHD-W was analyzed by 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis and MALDI-PSD-TOF MS in a bottom-up approach.",

The expression of more than 24 human proteins was modulated by the viral infection. Effects of UV-inactivated and infectious viruses on the hosts' proteome concerning energy metabolism and proteins associated with gene expression and protein-biosynthesis were quite similar. These effects might therefore be attributed to virus entry and virion proteins. However, the modulation of proteins involved in apoptosis was clearly correlated to infectious viruses.",

In this respect viral diseases are of particular concern, because advances in the field of antiviral drugs have lagged behind those regarding bactericidal drugs and antibiotics. It was shown by the emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) that new members of neglected virus families can cross into humans from unsuspected reservoirs, making rapid advances in our understanding of virushost dynamics necessary [2] . In this regard poxviruses are of particular importance. Despite the success of the WHO-led smallpox eradication programme, other related human-pathogenic poxviruses remain a considerable threat. In particular, the 2003 outbreak of human monkeypox virus in the United States of America pointed out the imminence posed by zoonotic pox infections originating from animal-borne viruses [3] . Moreover, an increasing number of human cowpox virus infections, especially affecting younger people lacking smallpox vaccination, have been reported in Europe in recent years [4] . In addition to the threat of zoonoses, the relevance of a deeper understanding of the interactions of poxviruses with their host cells is pointed out by considering the classification of smallpox as a category A bioterrorism agent by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), especially since no acceptable treatment is available and the immunity in the population is declining [5] .",

Since the permissiveness of orthopoxviruses is therefore dependent on the hosts proteome set, the identification of cellular proteins affected by the protein products of the so-called viral host-range genes with proteomic approaches will be a starting point for further functional protein analysis. The characterization of the Vaccinia Virus (VACV) virions' proteome has enlightened the protein equipment of the virus at the entry stage of infection [11] . Furthermore, virus-host dynamics have been analysed by yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) studies to identify interaction partners [12] .

The investigation of infection effects on the expression of the cellular proteome was carried out in the late phase of virus replication. An offline-coupling of two-dimensional sodium dodecylsulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionisation Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-ToF MS) was used in a bottom-up approach. In-gel trypsinated proteins from relevant spots of the 2-D gels are unambiguously identified via Mascot database search of the peptide mass fingerprint (PMF) recorded in positive ion reflectron mode of the MALDI-ToF MS. Identification rate was improved by obtaining additional sequence data of selected peptides in post source decay (PSD) mode, whereas a considerably advanced data quality was achieved by N-terminally derivatising the peptides on a ZipTip\u03bc-C18 solid phase support with 4-Sulfophenyl isothiocyanate (SPITC) prior to MS measurement.",

Purification of peptides was carried out with ZipTip\u03bc-C18 columns according to the principle of reversed phase chromatography. Generally, SPITC derivatization of peptides can be performed in solution prior to column binding as well as solid phase supported. Both sulfonation methods were modified compared to the literature with respect to signal intensity in order to enable protein identification with maximum sensitivity [15] [16] . Exemplarily, the resulting PMF spectra for in-solution trypsinated BSA has been compared with the solid phase supported approach concerning signal intensity, which is shown in Figure 2e /f. The signal to noise ratios (s/n) of m/z values used for identification were about 2 to 4 times higher for peptides derivatised on solid phase support than for the ones sulfonated in solution. The overall signal of PMF spectra in the mass range between 1000 and 2500 m/z is about 7 times larger for the standard derivatised on C18 columns. The improved s/n ratio and the increased signal intensity of the solid phase supported approach in PSD mode enlarges the coverage of the precursor ions' y-series and simplifies the automation of peak picking. The Mascot Score of the database search of ten accumulated PSD spectra was 176 for the solid phase supported approach and 139 for in solution sulfonation at a threshold value for significance of 33.

The difficulties of protein identification with MALDI-PSD-ToF MS spectra are low s/n ratios of fragments, incomplete sequence coverage and complex fragmentation patterns as a cause of random charge stabilisation. The protonation of peptides during the MALDI process is mediated by carboxyl groups of the matrix and mainly stabilised at primary amine groups of the N-termini and the Lysine residues. The stabilised charge induces different fragmentations of the same ion. The derivatization of peptides with SPITC binds a negatively charged sulfonic acid to the peptides' N-terminus [13] . This negative charge neutralises the protonation of C-terminal fragments which are no longer detectable in mass spectrometry. Primarily, the PSD spectra of SPITC-derivatised peptides show fragments of the y-series, whose appearance among the N-terminal fragments is promoted by the large electron density around the peptide bond. The derivatization with SPITC enables the detection of complete y-series with good s/n ratios and offers the elucidation of the peptides' primary sequence. The unambiguous mapping of peptides with completely known primary sequences to proteins registered in databases is remarkably simplified and is expressed in increased Mascot scores [14] . However, the application of SPITC derivatization for protein identification from complex mixtures is limited by the reduction of the peptides' signal intensities following N-terminal sulfonation. This degradation of sensitivity could be decreased by an optimization of the reaction conditions. For increased sensitivity the N-terminal sulfonation of peptides bound on C18 solid phase support is preferable compared to an in solution approach since signal intensity is increased and quality of PSD spectra is raised.",

Since the genome of VACV IHD-W is not available, the identification of viral proteins occurred via sequence homologies of the VACV strains Western Reserve and Copenhagen. Afterwards peptide sequences were derived from spectra of 13 spots representing proteins regulated in their expression, whose database search gained no result. Single-base substitutions among different VACV strains, which led to amino acid replacement, might have resulted in different peptide mass fingerprints. PSD spectra are in correlation to the confidence interval of the m/z values of the precursor ion. Therefore, protein identification via Mascot Search is disabled by mass shifts of precursor ions resulting from an amino acid replacement. De novo sequencing of viral proteins could not be assured because of the polyproteonality of 2D-gel spots. The unambiguously identified differences in the expression profile of HEK 293 cells resulting from VACV IHD-W infection are discussed in the following sections.",

The expression of fructosebisphosphate aldolase A (A-1), which acts as a central enzyme in the glycolysis by catalysing the retro-aldol cleavage of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate into dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glycerinaldehyde, is increased by both types of infection [15] . Also the enhanced expression of the enzyme malate dehydrogenase (A-2) is directly associated with a boost in the energy metabolism, which serves the viruses' need for energy for DNA replication. This enzyme is an integral part of the citric acid cycle by catalysing the oxidation of malate to fumarate [16] . The resulting reduction equivalent NADH/H + transfers electrons to the electron transport chain which builds up a proton gradient at the inner mitochondrial membrane, resulting in ATP-synthesis catalysed by the H + -transporting two-sector ATPase (A-3, A-4) [17] . A modification of the \u03b1-chain precursor of the H + -transporting two-sector ATPase (A-3, A-4), resulting in spot migration, is triggered by both types of infection and has been detected as well as an overexpression of the mtDNA stabilising ATPase family AAA domain containing 3A (A-6) protein, whose existence has just been evidenced at transcript level [18] . Another energy metabolism-related protein whose expression is up-regulated by the VACV IHD-W infection is the bsubunit of the electron transfer flavoprotein (A-5) which acts as a specific electron acceptor for several dehydrogenases, e. g. malate dehydrogenase (A-2), and transfers them to the respiratory chain [19] . All changes detected in the human proteome profile caused by the infection which are related to energy metabolism indicate an enhancement of the metabolic rate of the glycolysis as well as of the oxidative phosphorylation in order to fulfil the viruses' energy need for replication.",

This results in an altered expression profile of apoptosis-relevant genes caused by viral gene products. During VACV transcription double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is synthesised, since the virus possesses overlapping genes on both strands of its DNA. The presence of dsRNA activates the dsRNA-dependent serine/ threonine kinase (PKR) which phosphorylates the \u03b1-subunit of the translation initiation factor eIF-2 which is essential for protein biosynthesis. This phosphorylation inhibits the translation of mRNA and thereby induces apoptosis [30] [31] [32] [33] . An altered modification on the \u03b3-subunit of the translation initiation factor eIF-2 (B-1, B-2) caused by the infection was detected by a spot migration in the 2-DE gel the relevance of which has not yet been determined in the literature. The dsRNA-dependent PKR is usually inhibited by nucleophosmin 1 (C-7) which is ubiquitously expressed in human cells and translocates between nucleus and cytoplasm [34] . The downregulation of nucleophosmin 1 (C-7), which can not be detected in cells infected with active VACV IHD-W, suggests that it is a cellular response to the infection for the purpose of anti-viral defence. This immune response is undercut by the product of the VACV E3L gene, the putative double-stranded RNA binding protein (D-1) which binds dsRNA and inhibits apoptosis induction by preventing PKR from phosporylating the \u03b3-subunit of the translation initiation factor eIF-2 [35, 36] . The E3L gene product has been identified in HEK 293 cells infected with active VACV IHD-W, which is in correlation to proteome analysis of VACV virions that indicate that the putative double-stranded RNA binding protein (D-1) is not present in the virion but is expressed in the early replication phase.",

ZipTip\u03bc-C18 columns solid phase-supported SPITC derivatization is preferable compared to an in-solution approach, since s/n ratios as well as signal intensities are increased, and so the sensitivity for recording high quality PSD spectra is enhanced. Proteome analysis of VACV IHD-W-infected HEK293 cells in the late replication phase shows the upregulation of the energy metabolism and alteration of gene expression regulation. Further on the modulation of apoptosis which counteracts the cellular anti-viral response is demonstrated by the regulation of several proteins from different signalling pathways. Interestingly the effects of UV-inactivated viruses and infectious viruses on the hosts' proteome are quite similar. There is no difference between the identified alterations of the energy metabolism and just one differentially expressed protein associated with gene expression and protein biosynthesis (B-10). Therefore the up-regulation of the energy metabolism and alterations in the regulation of the cellular gene expression are results of virus entry and virions' proteins. However, the modulation of apoptosis is clearly affected by effects that correlate with infectious viruses. The absence of nucleophosmin in cells infected with infectious viruses, for example, may be the response on viral dsRNA resulting from transcription of viral DNA, as the competing apoptosis modulator putative double-stranded RNA binding protein (D-1) is not a part of the virion.",

The proteins were identified via offline-coupling of 2D-SDS-PAGE (Figure 3) in the pI range of 4-9 and the mass range of 10-250 kDa with MALDI-PSD ToF MS and are classified according to their physiological role in the dynamic proteome. The five protein classes are proteins relevant for energy metabolism (A), proteins associated with gene expression and protein biosynthesis (B), proteins relevant for apoptosis (C), viral proteins (D) and other proteins (E). Proteins of the same class are numbered consecutively. The positions of the proteins identified in the 2DE gel are shown in different apertures in Figure 3. The molecular weight and pI values of these proteins are compared with the theoretical values in the SwissProt database (",

Cells in one flask were infected with VACV IHD-W (ATCC-VR-1441\u2122) and in the other one with UV-inactivated VACV IHD-W with a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5. Cells in the third flask were cultured as a negative control. 1 h post infection the infection media (11.5 \u00d7 10 7 plaque forming units [PFU] in 10 ml culture media/flask) was exchanged for fresh 25 ml culture media. Proteomes of all three cell culture approaches were purified 9 h post infection by use of TRIzol \u00ae Reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
