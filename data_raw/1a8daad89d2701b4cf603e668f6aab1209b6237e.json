Emphysema among tobacco smokers often occurs in association with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a complex syndrome typified by airway narrowing and inflammation, and diagnosed by the presence of expiratory airflow obstruction on spirometric testing [1] [2] [3] [4] . Nonetheless, emphysema and COPD are by no means invariably concordant, and many patients severely afflicted by one of these lung abnormalities may have little or no evidence of the other [2] [3] [4] . In addition to directly attributable disability and premature deaths, smoking-associated lung diseases are also linked to many systemic abnormalities, including vasculopathies [5] , lung cancer [6] , renal dysfunction [7] , and osteoporosis [8] . The abnormal and often pathological bone demineralization that occurs in smokers is particularly notable for being highly related to the presence and severity of emphysema, and is independent of the co-existence or magnitude of COPD per se [8] .",

Volumes corresponding to two hundred and fifty (250) ng rGRP78 were concurrently added to multiple lanes of running gels (NuPage 4-12% Bis-Tris, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and electrophoresed. The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and blocked with 5% dry milk in TTBS (50 mM Tris HCl [pH 7.4], 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20). Membrane strips were separated by sectioning and each of these was individually incubated overnight at 4 o with a particular subject plasma specimen (@ 1:20 dilution). All of the laboratory investigators performing these assays (RAK, JX, AB) concurrently incubated multiple subject plasma specimens, each with one of the individual membrane strips available from gels (plus positive and negative controls), as well as molecular weight markers, and were completely oblivious to subject identities or disease manifestations. Pilot study had shown that 1:20 dilutions optimally distinguished emphysematous from normal populations, whereas more dilute specimens were too seldom positive in the disease subject specimens (and never positive among normal specimens). The strips were washed in TTBS, and then incubated for one hour with 1:8000 dilutions of chicken anti-human IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (Thermo Scientific, Rockfort, IL). After another washing, HRP was detected by addition of Super Signal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo Scientific), instantaneous exposure to radiographic film, and scored (positive or negative) by unanimous consensus of three investigators who were blinded to subject identities and clinical characteristics ( Figure S1 in File S1). The few equivocal specimens (n,5) were repeated until all blinded judges were in agreement.",

The biological plausibility of a particular autoimmune response is conditional on the presence of the corresponding autoantigen in the target organ(s), and GRP78 is highly expressed in lungs, especially in the disease specimens ( Figures 3A,3B ). HLA haplotypes are major (and often the strongest) known genetic determinants of autoimmune susceptibilities. Finding distinct HLA alleles are over-or under-represented (conferring predilection or protection, respectively) within a defined disease population is a hallmark of autoimmune disorders [16, 21] . DRB1*15 appears to ''protect'' smokers against the production of disease-associated anti-GRP78 autoantibodies. This result is the obverse of analogous studies in IPF patients, in whom DRB1*15 is over-represented among those with autoantibodies against heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), a stress response protein with considerable sequence homology to GRP78 [21] . These disparate findings are thus indicative of biologicallydistinct, antigen-and disease-specific autoimmune responses, rather than being a generalized epiphenomenon of ''lung disease''.",

T-cells are inert to anatomically accessible self-constituents in healthy subjects, whereas overt reactivity of these lymphocytes to a protein that is abundant in diseased organs ( Figures 3A,3B) is a ''Gold Standard'' of autoimmune disease [16, 19] . Antigen-(or autoantigen-) stimulated CD4 T-cells have protean and typically very injurious actions, including elaboration of numerous mediators that recruit and activate diverse leukocyte and somatic effector cells [21] . A finding of T-cell autoreactivity is very unlikely to be a benign epiphenomenon [16, 19] . Increased production of IFN-gamma in particular ( Figures 5C,5D ) is believed to be an important factor in the pathogenesis of smoking-associated lung disease [11] . Furthermore, the GRP78 reactivity of CD4 T-cells in emphysematous subjects cannot be simply attributable to global, nonspecific hyperactivity, since elastin split products (ESP) were inert (Figures 5A and 5C ). Although ESP was previously reported to be an autoantigen of emphysema [30] , we have been unable to replicate those findings, and similarly negative studies have been reported by other investigators [31] [32] [33] .",

The present studies show anti-GRP78 responses in smokers are manifest by activation of autoantigen-specific T-cells, a process that leads to numerous deleterious consequences [19] , and anti-GRP78 IgG autoantibodies directly exert pro-inflammatory effects. Even if these pathogenic actions are completely discounted, the multiple strong clinical-immunological associations here indicate assays for specific autoimmune responses may be useful to identify smokers who are most at-risk for these interrelated disorders. Nonetheless, these findings need additional corroboration and refinement before the adoption of autoimmune assays into the clinical management of smoking patients.",

Conversely, however, specific therapies that directly target pathological autoimmune processes, including autoantibody removal or interruption of autoantibody production per se, more often have clinical efficacy [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] . The most important ultimate result of the present study and related reports may be to draw attention to the potential for novel treatments, mechanisticallyfocused at critical stages of autoimmune cascades, to prevent or Figure 5 . CD4 T-cell autoreactivity to GRP78. A.) Addition of GRP78 to PBMNC cultures increased CD4 T-cell proliferation (BrdU uptake) relative to media controls (no added protein) (n = 47), unlike addition of elastin split products (ESP). P c denotes alpha level corrected for multiple comparisons. B.) GRP78-induced CD4 T-cell proliferation was greatest among cultures from smokers with emphysema (n = 34). Specific indices (SI) of proliferation were calculated as %CD4 T-cells incorporating BrdU in GRP78-supplemented cultures minus incorporation in concurrent media controls. C.) GRP78 also increased percentages of CD4 T-cells that produced IFN-gamma again, unlike effects of ESP. D.) IFN-gamma production was also greatest in the CD4 T-cells from the emphysematous smokers. Specific indices (SI) were calculated as %CD4 T-cells producing IFN-gamma production in GRP78-supplemented cultures minus that of concurrent controls. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0105066.g005",

Compared to normal lung (Left panel), emphysematous lungs (middle and right panels) demonstrated increased immunostaining in macrophages (yellow arrows) and alveolar epithelial cells (blue arrows). Magnification x100 left and middle panels, and magnification x400 in the right panel, n = 3. B.) GRP78 was also greater in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from emphysematous lungs compared to normal preparations. Lanes 1 and 8 are rGRP78 standards. Lanes 2-7 are BALF from individual emphysematous lung explants; lanes 9-14 are BALF from normal lung explants. All specimen lanes were loaded with equal amounts of BALF proteins. C.) Indirect immunofluorescent assays showed anti-GRP78 IgG isolated from patients bind to alveolar macrophages from normal lung explants (panel a), and osteoclasts derived from bone marrow (panel b).
