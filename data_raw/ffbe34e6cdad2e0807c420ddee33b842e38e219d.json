The amount of genetic data is growing faster than the rate at which it can be analyzed. Clustering techniques provide a viable solution for handling and analyzing such rapidly growing genetic data. Clustering algorithms partition sequences into different biologically meaningful groups, facilitating therefore the prediction of functions of genes [1] . When a new gene is assigned to a cluster, the biological function of this cluster can be attributed to this gene with high confidence. On the other hand, clustering gene sequences into groups may also help with analyzing evolutionary relationships among the sequences in a cluster [2] .",

This method chooses a short word length k, maps each sequence onto an n-dimensional vector according to its k-length tuple (also called k-tuple or kword) properties, and then assesses the similarity of any two vectors by measures such as Euclidean distance [15] , Mahalanobis distance [16] , Kullback-Leibler discrepancy [17] , cosine distance [18] or Pearson's correlation coefficient [19] . In recent years, several novel alignment-free measures [20, 21] have been designed for DNA sequences analysis. Yang et al.

Their tuple-based method determines the similarity of sequences by considering only tuple frequencies and ignoring the positional information within a sequence.",

            "text": "Major algorithms used in gene sequence clustering can be divided into two categories according to the result format: hierarchical clustering algorithms and partitional clustering algorithms [23] . Hierarchical clustering is widely used for detecting clusters in genomic data. It generates a set of partitions forming a cluster hierarchy. According to linkage criteria, there are three hierarchical clustering methods including single-linkage clustering (SL), complete-linkage clustering (CL) and averagelinkage clustering (AL) [24] . With SL, clusters may be merged together due to single sequences being close to each other, even though many of the sequences in each cluster may be very distant to each other [25] . CL tends to find compact clusters of approximately equal diameters [25] . With CL, all objects in a cluster are similar to each other. AL can be seen as an intermediate between single and complete linkage clustering, resulting in more homogeneous clusters than those obtained by the single-linkage method [26] . For instance, BlastClust [27] and GeneRage [28] employ single linkage clustering approach; SWORDS [29] is based on word frequencies as profiles to merge clusters hierarchically; and Uchiyama [30] use average linkage clustering algorithm to classify genes. Hierarchical approaches may yield fairly good results, but they require the similarity of all pairs of sequences and quickly arrive at a bottleneck in terms of computational time and memory usage for large-scale data sets [31] .",

Partitional clustering algorithms are simple and well-suited for clustering large datasets [32] . K-means (KM) [33, 34] is a commonly used method of partitional clustering methods. KM has a lower order of computational complexity and demands less physical memory than the hierarchical method. It is suitable for clustering large gene data. Some KM-based algorithms, such as those introduced by Wan et al. [33] , Kelarev et al. [34] , Tseng et al. [35] and Ashlock et al. [36] , have been developed to group DNA sequences. The major drawback of KM compared to hierarchical clustering algorithms is the lack of hierarchical relationships in its results. To remedy the problem, bisecting Kmeans (BKM), a hierarchical variation of KM, was proposed to build a tree of clusters in a top-down fashion by splitting the least homogeneous cluster into two more homogeneous ones. BKM can produce either a flat clustering or a hierarchical clustering by recursively applying KM. It has a linear complexity and is relatively efficient and scalable. Recent study [37] concluded that BKM outperforms KM and performs equally well or better than hierarchical methods when it partitions the dataset based on a homogeneity criteria. The bisecting approach is very attractive for genomic studies [38] .",

BlastClust [27] is a hierarchical clustering method based on BLAST scores as the measure of sequence similarity. BlastClust computes pairwise similarity of all sequences by BLAST alignment and then clusters sequences by the single linkage clustering method which produces clusters of linear topology. The performance of BlastClust is limited by the size of the input data. CD-HIT-EST [39] , a partitional approach, is also widely used to cluster DNA sequences. CD-HIT-EST uses an incremental clustering process and avoids the unnecessary alignments by a short word filtering mechanism, which detects similar sequences by counting the number of identical short words between them. The purpose of filters is to decide whether the identity between two sequences is above or below a threshold without aligning them, therefore speeding up the clustering process. Though CD-HIT-EST is based on alignment, it can avoid too many pairwise alignments by using a filter, thus it is faster than BlastClust, and can handle larger datasets.",

This is because DMk considers the occurrence, location and order relation of tuples in sequence and can capture more information in the sequence, while the k-tuple distance considers frequency alone and ignore the position of tuples in a sequence.

From Figure 2 and Additional file 1: Tables S3-S6, mBKM achieves better Fmeasures than other five clustering algorithms for the real number of clusters on all the data sets. Although the other clustering algorithms give slightly better results in terms of F-measure in some cases, mBKM performs better than the other clustering algorithms in terms of the average of the F-measures values (average values are shown in Additional file 1: Tables S3-S6 ). This result shows that on average, mBKM performs better than other clustering algorithms for a range of cluster numbers, in the vicinity of real number of clusters. It also implies that varying the number of clusters as input for these clustering algorithms does not affect the performance. Figure 3 shows the results of clustering algorithms with DMk. mBKM obtains the highest F-measure values among the six clustering algorithms at the real number of clusters. On average, mBKM achieves better results than the other clustering algorithms for DS2, DS3, and DS4.

The score density, -S parameter, varies between 10 and 90 with step size 10, and the alignment length, -L parameter, varies between 0.1 and 0.9 with step size 0.1. Other parameters are kept default. For CD-HIT-EST, because the sequence identity threshold, -c parameter, should be greater than or equal to 0.8 in the program, we vary -c parameter between 0.8 and 1 with step size 0.02, and set the word length as default value. The best results from different parameter combination are recorded. For mBKM with DMk, we set the size of k-tuple as 3 and use the real number of clusters as input. As BlastClust and CD-HIT-EST do not use the number of clusters as input, we choose the resulting class i, which has the max F(i,j) for cluster j, to calculate the F-measures.

Table 4 demonstrates that mBKM with DMk produces good results relative to each original cluster set in terms of F-measure.

BlastClust and CD-HIT-EST tend to give more clusters than the real numbers of classes, therefore, BlastClust and CD-HIT-EST give high precision and low recall value.

We use our method to verify the phylogenetic relationships of H1N1, and the result is included in Additional file 1. The clustering result using mBKM with DMk is shown in Figure 5(a) .

The experimental results show the method of combining mBKM with DMk is effective in classifying DNA sequences with similar biological characteristics and in discovering the underlying relationship among the sequences. In addition, DMk can achieve comparable or better accuracy than the frequency-based distance measure. Our proposed method can be applied to study gene families and it can also help with the prediction of novel genes. Furthermore, mBKM with DMk can generate cluster trees that are useful to understand the processes governing the gene evolution. In addition, our method may be extended for protein sequence analysis and metagenomics of identifying source organisms of metagenmic data. Our method has limitations too. For example, the method did not consider edge length, and has not address problems with long repeated sequences or long insertions. In future we will try to address these problems.",
