Here we identify ArfGAP with dual pleckstrin homology (PH) domains 2 (ADAP2) as a gene upregulated by type I IFN treatment in a STAT1-dependent manner. ADAP2 functions as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for Arf6 and binds to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PI(3,4,5)P 3 ) and PI(3,4)P 2 . We show that overexpression of ADAP2 suppresses dengue virus (DENV) and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) infection in an Arf6 GAP activity-dependent manner, while exerting no effect on coxsackievirus B (CVB) or Sendai virus (SeV) replication. We further show that ADAP2 expression induces macropinocytosis and that ADAP2 strongly associates with actin-enriched membrane ruffles and with Rab8a-and LAMP1-, but not EEA1-or Rab7-, positive vesicles. Utilizing two techniques-light-sensitive neutral red (NR)-containing DENV and fluorescence assays for virus internalization-we show that ADAP2 primarily restricts DENV infection at the stage of virion entry and/or intracellular trafficking and that incoming DENV and VSV particles associate with ADAP2 during their entry. Taken together, this study identifies ADAP2 as an ISG that exerts antiviral effects against RNA viruses by altering Arf6-mediated trafficking to disrupt viral entry.",

Some of the best-characterized ISGs that target viral entry belong to the interferon-inducible transmembrane protein (IFITM) family, which includes IFITM1, IFITM2, IFITM3, and IFITM5 (reviewed in [2, 3] ). IFITM family members exert broad antiviral effects against a diverse range of viruses including influenza A virus [4] , HIV [5] , dengue virus (DENV) [4] , and Ebola virus [6] . Although expressed at basal levels in many cell types, IFITM family members are induced by type I IFNs and may inhibit viral entry by direct alterations of cellular cholesterol homeostasis [7] , by alterations in the fusion between vesicular compartments that may favor a noninfectious entry pathway [8] , and/or by preventing fusion between viral and host-derived membranes while still permitting hemifusion [8, 9] . The targeting of viruses at the earliest stages of their infectious life cycles serves as a potent step at which ISGs can antagonize viral infections.",

            "text": "Viruses enter host cells through a variety of mechanisms. In some cases, viruses enter cells through similar means across multiple cell types, whereas in others, they utilize cell type-specific mechanisms for their entry. For example, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) exclusively utilizes a clathrin-mediated pathway for its entry [10, 11] , whereas the enterovirus coxsackievirus B (CVB) enters via a dynamin II GTPase-independent pathway in polarized intestinal cells [12] , but enters nonpolarized epithelial cells and polarized epithelial cells through a dynamin II-mediated pathway [13, 14] . Some viruses, such as Sendai virus (SeV) fuse directly at the host cell plasma membrane [15] . In the case of viruses that infect across diverse species, such as DENV that gains entry into both mosquito and human cells during its life cycle, viruses also exhibit species-specific entry mechanisms. In mosquito cells, DENV has been proposed to both enter via a clathrin-mediated pathway that requires delivery of incoming virions to a low pH endolysosomal compartment for fusion [16] , and possibly also by direct fusion at the plasma membrane [17] . In human cells, data support an uptake pathway for DENV that requires both clathrin coated pits and delivery of incoming virions to late endosomes [16, 18] . Cellular factors that restrict virus entry may thus exhibit virus and cell-type specificity depending on the mechanism by which the virus gains entry into the host cell and/or mediates its uncoating and/or fusion.",

Members of the ADP-ribosylation factor (Arf) family of Ras-related proteins are expressed in all eukaryotic cells and regulate both secretory pathway trafficking (as is the case for Arf1) as well as cortical actin rearrangements and endocytosis (as is the case for Arf6). Arf6 influences cell migration, polarization, endocytosis, and endosomal trafficking via its direct impact on both regulators of the actin cytoskeleton [19, 20] and the lipid membrane [21, 22] . Thus, the expression of regulators of Arf6 activity, such as Arf6 GEFs and GAPs, can induce pronounced effects on a multitude of cellular events converging on uptake from the plasma membrane and/or endosomal trafficking.",

Using this approach, we identified ArfGAP with dual pleckstrin homology (PH) domains 2 (ADAP2) as a gene upregulated by IFN\u03b2 exposure in a STAT1-dependent manner. ADAP2 (also known as centaurin-\u03b1 2 , CENTA2) is a phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PI(3,4,5)P 3 ) and PI(3,4)P 2 binding protein whose expression alters Arf6 membrane localization [23] [24] [25] . However, ADAP2 has not been fully characterized and relatively little is known regarding its role in endocytosis or endosomal trafficking. Here we show that expression of ADAP2 suppresses DENV and VSV infection in an Arf6 GAP activity-dependent manner, while exerting no effect on CVB or SeV replication. We further show that expression of ADAP2 induces pronounced effects on the actin cytoskeleton and that it directly associates with actin-enriched membrane ruffles, macropinosomes, and lysosomes. Utilizing two techniques-a light-sensitive neutral red (NR)-containing DENV and fluorescence assays for virus internalization--we show that ADAP2 primarily restricts DENV and VSV infection at the stage of virion entry or trafficking. Taken together, this study identifies an ISG that exerts its effects on DENV replication by altering Arf6-mediated trafficking to disrupt viral entry/trafficking.",

However, in some circumstances, internalized macropinosomes fuse directly with tubular lysosomes following their maturation [31] . To define the maturation process of ADAP2-containing macropinosomes, we assessed the localization of GFP-ADAP2 with markers of early endosomes (early endosome antigen-1 (EEA1)), late endosomes (Rab7), and lysosomes (LAMP1). We found that whereas ADAP2containing vesicles were excluded from EEA1-and Rab7-containing vesicles, they exhibited a strong association with LAMP1-containing vesicles in both fixed (Fig 5A-5D ) and living The Arf6 GAP activity of ADAP2 is required for its induction of macropinocytosis ADAP2 contains an Arf6 GAP domain and two PH domains. We next determined whether the Arf6 GAP activity of ADAP2 was required for its induction of macropinocytosis. To do this, we constructed ADAP2 mutants in which the entire Arf6 GAP domain was deleted (\u0394ARF GAP) or the Arf6 GAP activity was abrogated by mutagenesis (R53Q, a mutant described previously [23] ) (Schematic, Fig 6A) . Removal of the entire Arf6 GAP domain led to the appearance of largely immobile intracellular vesicles as analyzed by real-time fluorescence microscopy ( Fig 6B, S10 and S11 Movies) and inhibited the ADAP2-mediated enhancement of macropinocytosis ( Fig 6C) . In addition, an Arf6 GAP activity mutant of ADAP2 (R53Q) did not induce cytoplasmic vesicles and exhibited a strong association with the cell periphery ( Fig  6B , S12 Movie) and did not induce macropinocytosis ( Fig 6C) .",

Likewise, VSV also enters cells via a clathrinmediated pathway [10] and undergoes uncoating in early endosomes [32] . We found that expression of ADAP2 induced macropinocytosis through its Arf6 GAP activity, which was also required to restrict DENV and VSV replication. Given that DENV enters cells through a clathrin pathway, we next determined whether ADAP2 expression would alter clathrin-mediated endocytosis and/or DENV and VSV entry. We found that expression of wild-type ADAP2, but not R53Q ADAP2, altered the internalization of transferrin and prevented its perinuclear accumulation (S4A and S4B Fig), suggesting that it alters cargo internalizing via the clathrin pathway. To determine if ADAP2 restricts DENV infection at the stage of viral entry, we first generated neutral red (NR) containing DENV particles (DENV-NR). NR is an RNA-binding dye that has been used extensively in the field of picornavirus entry to identify inhibitors of virus entry [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] , but has not been used previously in the field of flavivirus entry. When viruses are propagated in the presence of NR, the dye associates with vRNA and renders the resulting NR-containing viral particles sensitive to light. Upon virus entry and RNA release, the NR dye diffuses away from the vRNA and replication continues in a light-insensitive manner. Thus, this method is a useful tool to establish the kinetics of viral entry and/or identify agents that inhibit and/or alter the release of vRNA. By propagating DENV in the presence of NR, we successfully generated light sensitive viral particles as confirmed by a greater than twolog drop in titer when fluorescent focus forming assays were performed under illuminated conditions (Fig 7A) .",

Unlike ADAP2, the expression of the related ADAP1 (also known as centaurin-\u03b1 1 ) is largely restricted to the brain [25, 40, 41] . Although ADAP2 and ADAP1 share~60% sequence identity and contain N-terminal ARF GAP domains and two PH domains, ADAP1 contains a nuclear localization signal and localizes primarily to the cytosol or nucleus whereas ADAP2 localizes predominantly to membrane ruffles. Sequence analysis of the promoter sequences of ADAP2 and ADAP1 revealed the presence of a conserved IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) in the promoter of ADAP2, but not in the promoter of ADAP1 (S5 Fig) . The induction of genes in response to type I IFNs is controlled by the presence of a conserved promoter sequence (GAAA(N)GAAA, where N is any nucleotide) termed the ISRE. Indeed, ADAP2 has been shown to be upregulated by IFN treatment in various human cells, such as primary hepatocytes [42] and PBMCs isolated from multiple sclerosis patients undergoing IFN treatments [43] . Taken together, our findings thus suggest that ADAP2 is specifically upregulated in response to type I IFN signaling, likely due to the presence of an ISRE.",

            "text": "Our data suggest that ADAP2 inhibits DENV and VSV replication at the stage of viral entry. DENV enters mammalian cells by a clathrin-mediated endocytic pathway that delivers incoming viral particles to Rab7 positive late endosomes [16, 18, 44] . Although a small portion (<20%) of viral particles undergo membrane fusion in Rab5 early endosomes or Rab5/Rab7 intermediate endosomes, the majority (>80%) of membrane fusion occurs in Rab7 late endosomal compartments [35] . Thus, the delivery of incoming DENV particles to a late endosomal compartment is required for efficient membrane fusion and perturbation of this pathway could dramatically impact subsequent viral replication. Similarly, VSV enters cells via a clathrindependent pathway and requires Rab5-mediated delivery to an endosomal compartment (with a pH of 6.2) to trigger G-protein-mediated fusion [11, 45, 46] , which is required to deliver particles into the host cell cytoplasm [32] . We show that expression of ADAP2 robustly induces macropinocytosis and that ADAP2-positive vesicles associate with Rab8a and the lysosomal marker LAMP1, but not Rab7 or Rab5. Our results therefore suggest that the induction of ADAP2 would serve to enhance macropinocytosis in cells exposed to type I IFN and that this would alter the trafficking of incoming DENV and VSV particles to preclude their delivery to Rab7 late endosomes. Moreover, the association of ADAP2-positive vesicles with LAMP1-positive compartments would serve to deliver any cargo, including viruses, contained within these vesicles to the degradative environment of lysosomes.",

            "text": "Similar to our findings with DENV, we found that expression of ADAP2 partially restricted VSV infection. In contrast, ADAP2 expression had no effect on CVB or SeV replication. Unlike both DENV and VSV, CVB enters nonpolarized cells via a clathrin-independent pathway and does not require specific delivery to endosomal compartments for uncoating [14] . In addition, SeV fusion occurs at the host cell surface and does not rely on specific delivery to endosomal compartments for its entry. Thus, the differential effects of ADAP2 on viruses that require delivery to an endosomal compartment (DENV and VSV) and those that do not (CVB, SeV) support a role for ADAP2 in the mislocalizing of incoming virions to non-endosomal compartments, thus preventing their uncoating/fusion. This is supported by our findings that ADAP2 expression also led to the mislocalization of transferrin, which is specifically internalized by a clathrin-mediated pathway and delivered to the endosomal network. Consistent with this, we also found that expression of wild-type or Q67L Rab8a and wild-type or Q111L Rab34, all of which induce macropinocytosis, restrict DENV infection (S6 Fig). We found that both the anti-DENV and VSV and macropinocytosis-inducing effects of ADAP2 required its Arf6 GAP activity. The cycling of Arf6 between GTP and GDP bound states is a primary determinant for its impact on actin cytoskeletal dynamics and endosomal recycling. For example, expression of a constitutively active Arf6 mutant (Q67L) induces the accumulation of clathrin cargo in intracellular endosomal compartments, likely due to alterations in endosomal fusion [47, 48] . In contrast, expression of a dominant inactive mutant (T157N) has no effect on intracellular accumulation of cargo, but instead exhibited overall lower levels of signal, presumably due to increases in endosomal recycling [49] . These data suggest that in cells expressing ADAP2, Arf6 is maintained in a GDP-bound state, leading to both increases in macropinocytosis and endosomal recycling. Collectively, the promotion of these pathways would induce dramatic alterations in the uptake and intracellular trafficking of viral particles. Consistent with this, we found that expression of wild-type Arf6 had no effect on DENV infection whereas expression of Q67L Arf6, which dramatically enhances vesicle invaginations from the plasma membrane in actin-coated vesicles [50] , potently restricted infection (S6 Fig). In some scenarios, the maintenance of Arf6 in a GDP bound state may serve in a proviral, or promicrobial, manner. Recently, several Arf GAP domain-containing molecules, including ADAP1, were shown to directly facilitate the uptake of Salmonella into host cell via their effects on the actin cytoskeleton [51] .",

In parallel, mocktreated 2fTGH and U3A were also included and were used to identify differentially expressed genes in IFN\u03b2-treated cells. Briefly, the quality of all RNA samples was confirmed using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) to ensure RNA integrity and quality. mRNA labeling was performed using a One-Color Low Input Quick Amp Labeling Kit (Agilent) and prepared for hybridization on SurePrint G3 Human Gene Expression 8x60K slides using the Gene Expression Hybridization Kit (both from Agilent). Slides were scanned using Agilent's SureScan Microarray Scanner System, and data extracted using Agilent's Feature Extraction Software (version 11.0.1.1). Microarray data were normalized using the cyclic loess normalization method [58] . The R package Limma (Linear Models for Microarray Data), which implements a moderated t-test, was used to identify differentially expressed mRNAs between mock-and IFN\u03b2 -treated samples [59] . Storey's q-value method [60] , as implemented in R package q-value, was used to calculate the adjusted p-values in order to control the false discovery rate.",
