Conventional field-effect-transistor (FET)-based techniques use solution-based processes, thus require antibody binding to the detection region of the FET prior to the supply of the analyte. With the method described here, virus-antibodybound particles are delivered to the FET during detection; therefore, neither a pre-treatment antibody binding step on the FET channel nor washing process for virus-antibody-binding are necessary. Our method is based on the concept that virus-antibody-bound particles are larger than the virus or antibody alone, and thus have larger charge numbers following aerosol charging. When these particles are charged by negative ions and electro-aerodynamically deposited on a substrate, there exists a location on the substrate where neither lone virus nor antibody particles land, and where only virus-antibody-bound particles are deposited. If this location coincides with the channel of the FET, the resulting variation in the current can be used to indicate the existence of a virus. By aerosolizing a mixed solution of the virus and the antibody, only the virus-antibody-bound particles were transported to the swCNT-FET, and the electric current in the swCNT-FET decreased to 30% of that measured with no deposited particles.",

Rapid, selective and sensitive detection of viruses is central to implementing an effective response to viral infections, such as through medication or quarantine. Established methods for viral analysis include plaque assays, immunological assays, transmission electron microscopy, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for viral nucleic acids 3,6,7 . These methods, however, cannot achieve rapid detection of a single virus; moreover, they often require a relatively high level of sample manipulation, which is inconvenient with infectious materials. Nevertheless, the ability to rapidly, directly and selectively detect individual virus particles would have a marked impact on healthcare by enabling diagnosis at the earliest stages of replication within a host system. Exposure to biological aerosols (bioaerosols), such as those from H1N1 influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) 8 , bird flu 9 and bioterrorism attacks 10 , has resulted in huge human and economic costs. Furthermore, the sustained growth in international travel increases the risk that an infectious disease may develop into a pandemic. These threats necessitate real-time bioaerosol sensing systems; however, development of such systems remains a challenge. Technologies including bioaerosol mass spectrometry (BAMS) 11 , surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) 12 and flow cytometry with fluorochrome 13 have been developed to detect bioaerosols. Fluorescence-based instruments, such as the ultraviolet aerodynamic particle sizer (UVAPS) 14,15 , BioTrak \u00ae 16 , and fluorescent microscopy with an inertial impactor 17 can optically measure concentrations of total and/or viable particles in real-time. However, these techniques are not capable of species-level discrimination and/or produce high false-positive rates 18 .

Following recent advances in technology, the importance of high-performance electronic devices has increased. FETs are one of the most important components of current semiconductor technology, and have been applied in diverse fields outside of microelectronics. Such cross-disciplinary developments in technology provide an exciting opportunity for environmental sensing applications. FETs have been successfully applied to the detection of biological species in liquids via translating virus binding events into electrical signals. Changes in the conductance of the channel of a FET due to selective binding of specific proteins or nucleic acid sequences at the device surface have been reported using purified samples [21] [22] [23] . In addition, the considerable progress that has been made in microfluidic channels has enabled the efficient transport of virus-laden liquids onto specific-antibody-coated FETs 20 .",

Our method is based on the concept that both a virus and an antibody are particles of finite sizes. To realize our technique, a solution containing a target virus and another solution containing a specific antibody for this virus ( Fig. 1B -a) must be prepared in advance, so that virus-antibody binding can occur ( Fig. 1B-b) . By atomizing the resulting mixture, the virus-antibody bound particles are aerosolized, as well as individual virus and antibody particles in the mixture solution ( Fig. 1B-c) . Water vapor and water droplets were removed by passing the aerosol flow through a diffusion dryer ( Fig. 1B-d) . The virus, antibody, and virus-antibody aerosols were electrically charged using a corona discharge (Fig. 1B-e) , after which they pass through a nozzle and then toward the substrate (Fig. 1B-f ). An external electric field is applied between the nozzle and substrate.

(1); we find W p = 14.1 mm for the virus, W p = 13.9 mm for the antibodies and W p = 17.4 mm for the virus-antibody bound particles. The deposition widths were measured using a digital camera (D80, Nikon, Japan). A black enclosure was installed near the deposition location to shield the region form external light. The measured deposition widths were 14.6 mm for the virus, 14.1 mm for the antibodies and 18 mm for the virus-antibody bound particles. Therefore, the measured data were in good agreement with the results of the calculations. Figure 5 also shows scanning electron microscope (SEM) images for four deposition spots. As shown in Fig. 5(a,b) , the virus and antibodies were deposited as single particles. Virus, antibodies and virus-antibody bound particles co-existed in Zone 1 (W p < 14.6 mm; see Additional experiments were carried out using antibodies specific for the H1N1 virus, and not for the target bacteriophage MS2 virus. Figure 6(a) shows the size distribution of the aerosolized antibodies for the H1N1 virus. The particles had a modal diameter of 11 nm and a total number concentration of 6.58 \u00d7 10 5 #/cm 3 . A solution containing the target bacteriophage MS2 virus and antibodies for the H1N1 virus was prepared and aerosolized, and the aerosolized particles were electro-aerodynamically deposited. The deposition width was 14.4 mm (Fig. 6(b) ), which is almost identical to that for the virus deposition shown in Fig. 5(a) . Figure 6 (c) shows an SEM image of deposition; single particles can be seen deposited on the substrate, and particle agglomeration was not observed. It follows that no change in the size of the particles due to binding between the target bacteriophage MS2 virus and the antibodies for H1N1 occurred. Figure 7 shows the source-drain current as a function of the gate voltage (i.e., I-V characteristics of the swCNT-FET) before and after the deposition of the virus-antibody bound particles. Figure 7 shows a dramatic decrease in the current following deposition of virus-antibody bound particles. When the number concentration ratio of virus to antibody was 1:0 or 0:1, the current did not change from that measured with no particle deposition (control value). However, when the ratios were 0.01:1, 0.05:1, and 0.1:1, the current decreased to 93%, 87%, and 46% of the control value, respectively, supporting that only virus-antibody bound particle can affect the current change. When the ratio further increased to 1:1 or 10:1, the current decreased to 30% of the control value on account of the higher number concentration of virus particles.",

A suspension of swCNTs was prepared by dispersing 5 mg of swCNTs (Hanwha, Korea) in 50 ml of 1,2-dichlorobenzene. To pattern the swCNT channel on a silicon dioxide wafer, an OTS self-assembled monolayer (SAM) technique was used. AZ5214 photoresist was patterned on the silicon oxide wafer using conventional photolithographic techniques. The wafer was then placed in a solution of OTS (1:500, v/v in hexane) for 5 min to form the OTS SAM on the wafer. The OTS-coated wafer was then dipped in acetone to remove the AZ5214 patterns, which resulted in an OTS-patterned wafer. The OTS-patterned wafer was then placed in the swCNT solution for 30 s, and rinsed using 1,2-dichlorobenzene. The swCNTs were then selectively absorbed onto the bare silicon dioxide regions, whereas the OTS SAM regions blocked the absorption of the swCNTs. Source and drain electrodes (Au/Pd, 30 nm/10 nm) were fabricated using conventional photolithography, thermal evaporation and lift-off. The source and drain electrodes were passivated using photoresist. Further details of swCNT-FETs can be found in Lee et al. 29 .",

The MS2 coat protein of bacteriophage is an RNA-binding protein that assembles into a pentameric structure to form the phage shell. The MS2 coat protein binds to a stem-loop structure in the viral RNA and facilitates packaging of RNA molecules into viral capsids. In addition, it represses synthesis of the viral replicase enzyme. The MS2 coat protein is widely used as an experimental model for the study of RNA-protein interactions that are involved in virus assembly. With the H1N1 antibodies, hybridoma clones were derived from hybridization of Sp2/0 myeloma cells with spleen cells form BALB/c mice immunized with purified influenza virus type A strain H1N1. Two antibody solutions were prepared: one from 10 ml of PBS and 120 \u03bc l of anti-enterobacteriophage MS2 coat protein stock, and the other from 2.5 ml of PBS and 195 \u03bc l of H1N1 antibody stock. The virus and antibody solutions were then mixed and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. Information. ' After the mixed solution was prepared, the particles were aerosolized using the following procedure. Compressed air was passed through a clean air supply consisting of an oil trap, a diffusion dryer, and a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter. The particle-free compressed air then entered a Collison-type atomizer (9302, TSI Inc., USA), containing the mixture. The aerosol flow rate was controlled using a rotameter. Dry, clean air flowed at 2 lpm, forming a high-velocity jet through an orifice in the atomizer. The pressure drop from this jet was used to draw the mixed solution up through a tube, which was then broken into droplets due to the high-velocity air jet. The resulting larger droplets impinged on an impactor, whereas the smaller droplets made no contact and formed an aerosol that exited through an outlet. The aerosolized mixed solution was passed through a diffusion dryer to remove water and a neutralizer (Soft X-ray charger 4530, HCT, Korea) to induce a Boltzmann charge distribution.",
