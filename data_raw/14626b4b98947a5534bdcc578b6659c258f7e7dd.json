We need to develop a new type vaccine based on RBDs. In this study, we expressed and purified recombinant proteins (named RBD-TcdA and RBD-TcdB) as vaccine candidates containing the RBDs of toxin A and toxin B, respectively, from the C. difficile reference strain VPI10463. The immunogenicity and protection of the vaccine candidates RBD-TcdA, RBD-TcdB, and RBD-TcdA/B was evaluated by ELISA and survival assays. The data indicated that mice immunized with all vaccine candidates displayed potent levels of RBD-specific serum IgG. Following intramuscular immunization of mice with RBD-TcdA and/or RBD-TcdB, these vaccine candidates triggered immune responses that protected mice compared to mice immunized with aluminum hydroxide alone. Taken together, the results of this study reveal that recombinant proteins containing RBDs of C. difficile toxins can be used for vaccine development. Additionally, we found that an RBD-TcdA/B vaccine can elicit a stronger humoral immune response and provide better immunoprotection than the univalent vaccines. This RBD vaccine candidate conferred significant protection against disease symptoms and death caused by toxins from a wild-type C. difficile strain.",

It has been on the legal surveillance list in many countries, including China, as a pathogen causing infectious disease [8, 9] . Besides the use of effective antibiotics and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), immunoprophylaxis is generally considered an effective and preferred control strategy [10, 11] . Toxin A and toxin B are major virulence determinants of this bacterium. Immunity to these two toxins provides protection by inhibiting the action of the toxins, which can effectively prevent serious illness caused by CDI [6, 12] . Toxin A is an enterotoxin and cytotoxin with very high toxicity; toxin B is a potent cytotoxin with a toxicity 100-1000 times as high as that of toxin A [13, 14] . In vaccine development, we search for vaccine candidates with high immunogenicity but low toxicity, so we needed to make changes to the toxins for the development of the new vaccine type. Both toxin A and toxin B are single-chain polypeptides consisting of a highly conserved N-terminal catalytic domain that can modify GTPases, a translocation domain, an autoproteolytic domain, and a receptor-binding domain (RBD) [15, 16] . The three-dimensional structures of the glucosyltransferase domain and portions of the RBD have been well defined. The only known native receptor of toxin A is the \u03b1Gal(1,3)\u03b2Gal (1, 4) \u03b2Glcgly can sequence, which is not found on human intestinal epithelial cells [16, 17] . Human receptors of toxin B have been identified [18] [19] [20] . Crystal structures of toxin fragments indicate that the toxin A RBD possesses seven carbohydrate binding sites [21] , and toxin B is predicted to have four sites [16] . Binding to receptors by RBDs is essential for the toxicity of C. difficile toxins A and B; inhibiting the binding can protect a host from illness caused by the toxins. Usually, the RBDs are known to be nontoxic and immunogenic, and RBDs were used in vaccine candidates against, among others, SARS Coronavirus [22] and C. botulinum [23] . In our study, we constructed recombinant proteins containing the full-length RBD from toxin A or toxin B (named RBD-TcdA and RBD-TcdB, respectively) of reference strain VPI10463 (ribotype RT087). We immunized mice with the recombinant RBD-TcdA and/or RBD-TcdB to test their immunogenicity and protective effect against toxins extracted from the wild-type strain American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) BAA-1870, which belongs to ribotype 027 (RT027).",

After overnight incubation at 4 \u2022 C, the plates were washed, blocked, and then incubated with serially diluted sera for 2 h at room temperature.

After 30 min of incubation at room temperature, the plates were washed, 100 \u00b5L of substrate solution was added to each well, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of 50 \u00b5L of 2 M sulfuric acid to each well. The absorbance of the developed color was measured at 450 nm (A450). The cut-off value for the assay was calculated as the mean specific OD plus standard deviation (SD) for 10 serum samples, assayed at a dilution of 1:40 from nonimmunized mice. The titer of each serum was calculated as the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution yielding a specific OD higher than the cut-off value. All assays were performed in triplicate and repeated three times. The neutralizing antibody detection was performed by MTT assay. Briefly, the heat-inactivated serum from immunized mice was serially diluted with DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum, mixed with an equal volume of crude toxins, i.e., 0.28 ng (50 \u00b5L) toxin A, or 0.36 ng (50 \u00b5L) toxin B, and incubated at 37 \u2022 C for 1 h.

Therefore, in our study, we tested the humoral immune responses through evaluating toxin-specific antibody titers. To evaluate humoral toxin-specific immune responses elicited by RBD-TcdA and RBD-TcdB, mice were vaccinated twice intramuscularly with 1 \u00b5g RBD-TcdA, RBD-TcdB, or RBD-TcdA/B. On the indicated days, serum samples were collected and evaluated by ELISA. The data indicate that all immunized mice displayed potent levels of RBD-specific serum IgG ( Figure 3A,B) . As expected, animals immunized with PBS displayed no antigen-specific responses (data not shown). The anti-RBD-TcdA and anti-RBD-TcdB antibody titers can be detected on day 7, and then increased quickly and maintained a high-level titer for a few days ( Figure 3A,B) . When we increased the immunization dose to 10 \u00b5g of RBD-TcdA, RBD-TcdB, or RBD-TcdA/B, we did not measure higher titers of IgG in comparison with groups immunized with lower doses (Figure 3C,D) . The presence of antibody subtypes (IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b, and IgG3) specific to vaccine candidates was determined by indirect ELISA. We found significant increases in absorbance for antigen-specific IgG1, IgG2a, and IgG2b ( Figure 3E,F) , but not IgG3, in the sera of immunized mice in comparison with controls. Next, we evaluated the neutralizing antibody levels. Sera from immunized mice neutralized a certain dose of crude toxins in our in vitro neutralization assay. The titers of neutralizing antibody induced by the RBD-TcdA/B vaccine were much higher than those of the two univalent vaccines (Table 1) .",

Since we used the toxins of wild-type ATCC BAA-1870 strain of C. difficile to challenge mice in this study, we needed to verify the similarities between the toxins of ATCC BAA-1870 and other hyper-virulent strains R20291 (Toxin A: Gene ID: 8470358; Toxin B: Gene ID: 8470357) and CD196 (Toxin A: Gene ID: 8466712; Toxin B: Gene ID: 8466711). The results show that genes of both toxins in the ATCC BAA-1870 strain are identical to those in the other two RT 027 strains, as published in GenBank. However, the RBDs amino acid sequences of toxins A and B of the ATCC BAA-1870 strain show 96.2% and 88.4% similarity with those of the reference strain VPI10463, respectively ( Figure S1 ). To study the protective effect of the recombinant proteins, C57BL/6 mice were immunized with 1 \u00b5g RBD-TcdA, RBD-TcdB, or RBD-TcdA/B and, after two immunizations, inoculated with crude toxins of ATCC BAA-1870. The results show that RBD-TcdA, RBD-TcdB, and RBD-TcdA/B can protect mice against 1 MLD of toxin or prolong their life ( Figure 4A ). When we increased the immunization dose to 10 \u00b5g, these three vaccines still protected mice against 1 MLD of crude toxins or prolonged their life ( Figure 4B ). There is no big difference between the effects of the two immunization doses when mice were challenged with 1 MLD. When mice were challenged with a dose of 2 MLD crude toxins, 80% of the mice immunized with RBD-TcdA/B survived. Of the mice immunized with RBD-TcdA, 50% survived, and in the RBD-TcdB-vaccinated group and the control group, there were no survivors. When mice were challenged with a dose of 3 MLD crude toxins, 60% of the mice immunized with 10 \u00b5g RBD-TcdA/B survived; only the group receiving 10 \u00b5g RBD-TcdA/B had survivors.

There are limited data on FMT for treatment of primary CDI, but FMT appears safe and effective for recurrent CDI [24] . Disease prevention is still an important approach that deserves exploration [25, 26] . As mentioned before, toxin A and toxin B are major virulence determinants of C. difficile. Binding to receptors by RBDs is essential for the toxicity, and blocking the binding sites can protect hosts from illness caused by toxins [2, 14] . Immunization with recombinant RBDs represents a promising method in vaccine development [22, 23] . A number of studies have demonstrated that antibodies induced by RBD-based vaccines can efficiently block the toxicity of bacterial or viral replication in tissue [27] . Several C. difficile vaccine candidates exist worldwide [27] [28] [29] . One vaccine for C. difficile was developed by Sanofi Pasteur [30] . They developed a bivalent candidate vaccine, a formalin-inactivated, highly purified preparation of toxins. Although a significant immune response is evoked, it remains quite difficult to develop this kind of vaccine, especially because it is difficult to obtain a highly pure natural toxin. Novavax developed a chimeric toxin receptor-binding domains vaccine, which induced protection against CDI [31] . The linker in chimeric vaccine may alter the structure of protein.",

It is a promising oral vaccine candidate against CD. As mentioned in this paper, they still need a long time to evaluate whether NTCD/NTCD_mTcd138 survived in animals after antibiotic treatment. Another strategy is developing a novel chimeric toxin vaccine, which retains major neutralizing epitopes from both toxins and confers complete protection [32] .

The ratio of IgG2a/IgG1 in all vaccine groups suggested that our vaccines elicited a Th2-type immune response. The principal role of the toxin-neutralizing circulating antibody in immunity against C. difficile has also been clearly demonstrated in animal models [27, 35, 36] . In this study, we identified and characterized efficacious toxin RBD-neutralizing antibodies against crude toxins. Sera from immunized mice neutralized a certain dose of crude toxins in an in vitro neutralization assay.

Delivery of crude toxins intraperitoneally is lethal in mice. However, systemic toxin is not indicative of a normal infection scenario [37] . Entry of the toxin into circulation is thought to be a possible cause [38] . Therefore, challenging immunized mice with intraperitoneal toxin represents a stringent method for this research. However, we will try to make spores of bacterium to establish the animal CDI model, which can develop Vaccines 2019, 7, 180 10 of 12 a wide range of disease symptoms in the near future. In order to evaluate the protection conferred by the vaccine candidate, the immunized mice were challenged with natural crude toxins extracted from the RT027 strain ATCC BAA-1870 [36] . Among the three vaccine candidates, the RBD-TcdA/B vaccine elicited the strongest humoral immune response and provided the greatest protection against toxins of C. difficile. The most important reason for this observation must be that the RBD-TcdA/B vaccine can induce the production of more types and higher levels of RBD-specific antibodies, which can block two toxin RBDs to inhibit the action of the toxins. Moreover, toxins can be used as adjuvant in several research models [39, 40] . In our study, we found that the anti-toxin A, but not anti-toxin B, neutralizing antibody titer induced by the RBD-TcdA/B vaccine was much higher than that induced by the single one. Toxin B is a potent cytotoxin with toxicity 100-1000 times as high as that of toxin A. Thus, we presume that RBD-TcdB functions as an adjuvant here. In this case, the RBD-TcdA/B vaccine can activate a broader spectrum of B-cell clones than the univalent vaccine, causing a difference in the protection level they offer against toxins. The protective data we got from the animal experiments will aid us further in the development of a safe and effective vaccine for human beings. C57BL/6 mice were also immunized with different doses to evaluate the relationship between the immunizing dose and the conferred protection. The results show that there is no statistically significant difference between the immunization effects of the two doses after mice were challenged with 1 MLD crude toxin. We need more work to address it and find the mechanism.",
