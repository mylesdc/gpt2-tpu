            "text": "Compared to the traditional methods, such as cell fractionation, electron microscopy and immunofluorescence assay, which only focus on the static observations, single particle tracking is a better choice, since it can provide the dynamic processes or short-lived events during virus invasion and infection in the live host cells directly and authentically 18, 19 . Furthermore, single particle tracking can provide important references for further virus infection mechanism research. For example, poliovirus (PV) was originally found to enter cells via clathrin-mediated endocytosis 20 . By using single particle tracking, it was further showed that PV released from the vesicles or tightly sealed membrane invaginations located within 100-200 nm of the plasma membrane highly efficiently and rapidly 21 . Therefore, considering the advantages of single particle tracking, it was adopted here to observe the PEDVs moving along the MTs in the live cells directly. However, it is worth noting that in order to track the PEDVs along the MTs, virus labeling is required, and various labeling methods have been designed including genetic engineering, physical incorporation, and bioconjugation. Genetic engineering can label viruses at a well-defined position by fusing fluorescent proteins (FPs) to certain domains of virus proteins or viral nucleic acids, however, this method has great challenges due to the complicated processes, technical barriers and even the inactivation of labeled viruses 22 . Physical incorporation usually utilizes lipophilic fluorescence reagents such as DiD, Rhodamine-18 and their analogues to enter into the lipid membrane of the envelope of viruses, but it is compromised for low specificity 13, 18, [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] . Bioconjugation labels the virus by using the chemical reaction between the chemical groups of viruses and fluorophores 30 while chemical modifications usually have a low efficiency and influence the activity of the viruses 31 . Therefore, optimized labeling tactic is still required for long time tracking of PEDV moving along the MTs in the live host cells.",

QDs were chosen since they are 10-100 times brighter and 100-1000 times more photostable than organic dyes and FPs, thus making them ideal for long-time tracking of viruses 32, 33 . Compared to modified viruses by utilizing the streptavidin-conjugated QDs 34 , which significantly increased the size of viruses 35 and decreased the infectivity of labeled viruses, our optimized labeling strategy less influenced the virus dynamics and hardly affected PEDV infectivity. With the optimized labeling technique, it is the first time, to our best knowledge, long time tracking of massive QD modified PEDVs along the MTs were successfully realized in real time, the statistical results show that PEDV had specific motion modes in different regions when they traveled along the MTs in the live Vero cells. Besides, small amount of PEDVs also experienced a return movement in live cells occasionally. Combining with the real time single particle tracking technique and the optimized labeling method, the dynamics of the PEDVs moving along the MTs were observed directly. In addition, with the quantitative analysis on trajectory, velocity and mean square displacement, both the motion velocity and motion mode of PEDVs were extracted, providing important references for further study on the PEDV infection mechanism, and the development of new vaccines or effective PED treatments.",

Next, the activity of modified viruses was evaluated via virus titer.

The results also demonstrated the reaction between QD-N 3 and the DBCO. Besides, in order to determine that the QD-N 3 modified viruses were specifically produced by the chemical bond formed between the QD-N 3 and the DBCO labeled viruses, a colocalization assay was used to evaluate the specific labeling of QD-N 3 to the viruses. As an example shown in Fig. 3(B) , 75.6% \u00b1 4.9% of the immunofluorescence signals were colocalized with QD signals, suggesting that most of the virions budding from the DBCO cultured cells could be modified with DBCO. Besides, 81.7% \u00b1 3.5% of the QD signals were colocalized with immunofluorescence signals while no QDs or colocalization signals were detected with wild-type viruses, illustrating that the QDs were adequate and specific for displaying the PEDVs with negligible interference from nonspecific binding. Therefore, the observed QDs signals were mostly from the labeled viruses, other than from the free QD-N 3 . Furthermore, the line profile of the enlarged region form Fig. 3(B) showed that nearly all the intensity peaks of the QD signals coincide the intensity peaks of the immunofluorescence signals as shown in Fig. 3(C) . Both the data in Fig. 3 (B, C) demonstrates that QDs colocalized with the viruses with high specificity. It is worth noting that the images shown in Fig. 3 were only representatives from 60 fields of views, and the data were statistically extracted from all the fields of view. between the virus and MTs: the near-cell membrane (CM) region 39 (within 1 \u03bcm of the cell membrane); the middle-cell cytoplasm (CC) region; the near-microtubule organizing center (MTOC) region (within 5 \u03bcm of the MTOC), which is a distinct region that is responsible for attaching and organizing the microtubules in living cells 40 and is also the site of microtubule nucleation 32, 41 . The fast or slow speed was defined by calculating the average speed from instantaneous velocities of 9 continuous frames. The threshold for fast or slow speed interval determination was defined as 75% of the peak value of the average velocity. If the average speed was under the threshold, we defined the movement as slow, otherwise we defined the movement as fast. Figure 4(A, B) list an example of single QD modified PEDV (red) moving along the EGFP-tagged MTs (green) (Video S1 and S2 in the Supplementary Information) . According to the real time tracking, it indicates that the PEDV dynamics in the CM, CC and MTOC regions were different. When the PEDV was first located at the CM region (Video S3 in the Supplementary Information), its velocity was relatively stable with an average speed of 0.03 \u03bcm/s in Fig. 4(C) , besides, the MSD was fitted by the restricted motion mode with D of 0.005 \u03bcm 2 /s (R 2 = 0.99). Then, when the PEDV moved to the CC region in Fig. 4(D) , its average speed was primarily maintained as the average speed of 0.05 \u03bcm/s similar to that in the CM region, while its motion was changed to the directional diffusion motion mode with D of 0.037 \u03bcm 2 /s (R 2 = 0.99). With the same directional diffusion motion mode with D of 0.009 \u03bcm 2 /s (R 2 = 0.99), the PEDV speed was next accelerated to the average speed of 0.08 \u03bcm/s. At last, the PEDV decelerated in the restricted motion mode with average speed of 0.05 \u03bcm/s and D of 0.00032 \u03bcm 2 /s (R 2 = 0.99), respectively. The analysis indicates that the PEDV experienced a slow-fast-slow process during the motion along the MTs within the CC region (Video S4 in the Supplementary Information) . Finally, when the PEDV reached the MTOC region, it also experienced a slow-fast-slow process as shown in Fig. 4 (E). The PEDV primarily kept relatively slow motion in the restricted motion mode with the average velocity and D of 0.06 \u03bcm/s and 0.014 \u03bcm 2 /s (R 2 = 0.98), respectively. Afterwards, it accelerated to 0.1 \u03bcm/s but still with the restricted motion mode with D of 0.008 \u03bcm 2 /s (R 2 = 0.95). At last, the PEDV decelerated to an average velocity of 0.06 \u03bcm/s but in the directional diffusion motion mode with D of 0.013 \u03bcm 2 /s (R 2 = 0.99) (Video S5 in the Supplementary Information) .",

            "text": "Besides the PEDV shown in Fig. 4 , most of the PEDVs (85%, 51/60 PEDVs in 20 cells), which are moving along MTs, also performed similar motions as relatively stable movements in the CM region and slow-fast-slow motion patterns in both CC and MTOC regions as shown in Fig. 5 ; besides, the motion modes presented in Fig. 5 were also the same as those in Fig. 4 . During the PEDV motion in the CM region, the average velocity of the PEDVs was ~0.05 \u03bcm/s and all in restricted motion mode as two represented examples listed in Fig. 5(A) . When the PEDV was in the CC or MTOC region, different PEDVs moved in diverse velocities, while they all followed a slow-fast-slow motion pattern with a directional-directional-restricted diffusion motion mode or a restricted-restricted-directional diffusion motion mode, respectively, as the two represented examples shown in Fig. 5(B, C) . In addition, return movements of small amount of PEDVs (15%, 9/60 PEDVs in 20 cells) were also observed in Vero cells as shown in Fig. 6(A, B) , both with the average velocity of ~0.04 \u03bcm/s (Videos S6 and S7 in the Supplementary Information) . However, because the percentage of the PEDVs showing return movements was small (15%), therefore most PEDVs (85%) invaded the Vero cells in the specific motions described in Figs 4 and 5. According to the real time tracking of PEDVs moving along the MTs in Vero cells, it shows that most PEDVs had specific infection motions as shown in the schematic diagram of Fig. 7 . First, in the CM region, PEDVs performed a restricted motion mode, which is similar to that of influenza virus (IV) 42 , pseudorabies virus (Prv) 43 and human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) 44 when entering the host cells. It is known that viruses exploit specific receptors to identify and infect target cells, however, these receptors are often rare or distributed in regions that are not readily accessible to incoming virions. Therefore, many viruses first bind to relatively non-specific attachment factors and migrate along the cell surface to locate specific receptor(s) 45 . Then, specific virus-receptor interactions activate signaling cascades, guiding the virus into endocytic pathways and/or triggering conformational changes in the virus envelope for entering the host cells. Therefore, entry is a rate-limiting step often in slow speed for viral infection 46 . Next, in the CC region, different from IV 25 and Prv 43 which showed the directional motion mode with no obvious changes in the speed, the movement of PEDVs was more diverse showing the directional-directional-restricted motion mode with slow-fast-slow speed pattern. During this period, viruses need to travel along cytoskeleton to reach a specific site for genome release after entering the cell, or travel inside endocytic or exocytic vesicles 8 . During viral transport in the cytoplasm viral proteins interact directly with dynein 47 or kinesin 48 motors. Since viruses widely exploit diverse cellular mechanisms for transport, the virus motion modes and the movement speeds may be more complicated during this period for PEDV. Finally, in the MTOC region, PEDVs also performed more diverse movement than that of IV by showing the restricted-restricted-directional motion mode, while IV showed either the restricted motion mode 49 ",

            "text": "In order to study the mechanisms of PEDV infection, this paper provided real time tracking of the PEDVs moving along the MTs in live host Vero cells combining with the optimized labeling method and the real time single particle tracking. To label the PEDVs, we introduced DSPE-PEG-DBCO to the viral envelope via virus propagation in the DSPE-PEG-DBCO cultured Vero cells. The DSPE-PEG-DBCO has little cytotoxicity to the Vero cells, moreover, this strategy does not affect the activity or production of the viruses. After labeled with QDs by copper-free click chemistry reaction specifically, these labeled viruses can be used for single virus tracking to analyze the dynamics of the PEDV infection. Using real time single particle tracking, the infection motions of 60 PEDVs along the MTs in the host Vero cells were recorded and analyzed. It shows that most PEDVs had specific motion along the MTs: in the CM region, PEDVs performed restricted motion mode with relatively stable speed; while in the CC and MTOC regions, the velocity of PEDVs both followed the slow-fast-slow pattern, but in different motion modes. Though return movements of small amount of PEDVs were also observed in Vero cells, most PEDVs still invaded the Vero cells along MTs in the specific motions. According to the optimized labeling method as well as the detailed analysis on the PEDV motion along the MTs via single particle tracking, it is believed that this work provides direct PEDV infection model, which proposes important references for further study on the PEDV infection mechanism, and promotes the development of new vaccines and effective PED treatments.
