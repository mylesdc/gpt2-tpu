However, a previously undescribed reaction of these compounds with alcohols in the presence of a base, leads to 1-alkoxy-1H-benzo-(Bt-OR) and 7-azabenzotriazoles (At-OR). Although BOP undergoes reactions with alcohols to furnish 1-alkoxy-1H-benzotriazoles, Bt-OTs proved to be superior. Both, primary and secondary alcohols undergo reaction under generally mild reaction conditions. Correspondingly, 1-alkoxy-1H-7-azabenzotriazoles were synthesized from At-OTs. Mechanistically, there are three pathways by which these peptide-coupling agents can react with alcohols. From 31 P{ 1 H}, [ 18 O]-labeling, and other chemical experiments, phosphonium and tosylate derivatives of alcohols seem to be intermediates. These then react with BtO \u2212 and AtO \u2212 produced in situ. In order to demonstrate broader utility, this novel reaction has been used to prepare a series of acyclic nucleoside-like compounds. Because BtO \u2212 is a nucleofuge, several Bt-OCH 2 Ar substrates have been evaluated in nucleophilic substitution reactions. Finally, the possible formation of Pd \u03c0-allyl complexes by departure of BtO \u2212 has been queried. Thus, alpha-allylation of three cyclic ketones was evaluated with 1-(cinnamyloxy)-1H-benzo[d][1,2,3]triazole, via in situ formation of pyrrolidine enamines and Pd catalysis.",

In that work, analysis of the reaction course by 31 P{ 1 H} NMR did not show the formation of a new phosphorus signal other than that for HMPA, which is a reaction byproduct. However, prior investigations by others [23, 24] and by us [25] [26] [27] have demonstrated the formation of phosphonium ions by the reaction of BOP with the oxygen atoms in amide linkages of purines and related heterocycles. In fact, related to these observations we have demonstrated the isolation and synthetic utility of a nucleoside phosphonium salt [28] . Thus, to us the reaction of oximes with BOP was an intriguing result, leading us to query whether a benzotriazolyl intermediate, rather than a phosphonium ion, was formed en route to the cyanide. This line of reasoning would then suggest that 1-alkoxy-1H-benzotriazoles may indeed be obtainable from the reactions of alcohols with BOP, and that different reaction pathways may be operative depending upon the nature of the nucleophile (Scheme 2). However, the formation of 1-alkoxy-1H-benzotriazoles by such an approach appeared implausible on the basis of prior observations, where no reaction of BOP with the free hydroxy groups of nucleosides was observed [23, 25] .",

Some notable results are as follows. Despite the leaving group ability of BtO \u2212 , elimination to styrene does not appear to be a significant problem in the reactions with the isomeric phenylethanols ( enhanced acidity of these protons in 1o or a reactive intermediate. Such a problem was not encountered in the reactions of other benzylic alcohols. Use of K 2 CO 3 in place of DBU did not ameliorate this problem encountered with 4-nitrobenzyl alcohol. However, use of slightly modified conditions resulted in the for-mation of the desired product 1o in good yield (see Supporting Information File 1 for details). Reaction of phenol with Bt-OTs resulted in the formation of the phenyl tosylate ( Table 2 , entry 16), indicating the potential use of this reagent as a tosylating agent for phenols. The outcome in the phenol reaction may be linked to the potential reaction pathway, an aspect that is described below.

In this context, N-allylbenzotriazole derivatives undergo reaction with preformed enamines, in the presence of Pd(OAc) 2 and PPh 3 [37] .

With these data in mind, we decided to evaluate a few reactions of cinnamyloxy benzotriazolyl derivative 1g.

What is notable about reagents such as HBTU and HATU is that they are commonly encountered in the guanidinium (N form) rather than the uronium (O form). Although the uronium form can be synthesized and is a more reactive species, it undergoes rapid isomerization to the guanidinium form in the presence of bases [40] .

Although reactions of alcohols proceeded with (benzotriazol-1-yloxy)tris(dimethylamino)phosphonium hexafluorophosphate (BOP) and DBU, Bt-OTs was a more effective reagent. Correspondingly, the 7-aza derivatives were synthesized from At-OTs. Methodologically, this one-step process allows for the direct conversion of alcohols to N-alkoxy benzo-and azabenzotriazoles, eliminating the necessity for alkyl halides or more cumbersome methods. Mechanistic studies indicate that reactions of alcohols with these peptide-coupling reagents, in the presence of a base, appear to proceed by formation of alcohol phosphonium derivatives (with BOP), or alcohol tosylates (with Bt-OTs), and not through direct displacement of the leaving group by attack at the N1 or by a S N 2'-type of process by reaction at the N3 of the triazolyl moiety. The mechanistic analyses were conducted by a combination of 31 This reaction also shows that Bt-OTs (and At-OTs) could serve as tosylating agents for phenols as well. Further, the utilities of this reaction, as well as some of the products have been explored. In this vein, acyclic nucleoside-like compounds containing benzo-and azabenzotriazole as a nucleobase surrogate have been synthesized. Because benzotriazole derivatives have potentially important pharmacological applications, we anticipate expansion of this chemistry in the future to a broader range of nucleoside-like entities for biological assays. The ability of BtO \u2212 to function as a nucleofuge, led us to explore its displacement. In this context, several 1-alkoxy-1H-benzotriazoles obtained from benzylic alcohols underwent substitution reaction with a range of nucleophiles, and a simple alkyl derivative also underwent reaction although the reaction was slightly incomplete. Finally, we have evaluated the departure of BtO \u2212 from an allylic position leading to a putative Pd \u03c0-allyl complex. In unoptimized preliminary results, Pd-catalyzed \u03b1-allylation of three cyclic ketones was accomplished with a cinnamyloxy benzotriazolyl derivative, through in situ formed pyrrolidine enamines. Overall, the potential scope of this new chemistry appears promising, ranging from the development of novel molecules with new applications, to synthetic methodology.

THF was distilled from LAH and then redistilled from Na prior to use. Ethyl acetate (EtOAc) and hexanes were distilled from CaSO 4 , commercial CH 2 Cl 2 was redistilled. Other commercially available compounds were used without further purification. 1 H NMR spectra were recorded at 500 MHz and are referenced to the residual protonated solvent resonance. 13 C NMR spectra were recorded at 125 MHz and are referenced to the solvent resonance. Chemical shifts (\u03b4) are reported in parts per million (ppm) and coupling constants (J) are in hertz (Hz). Standard abbreviations are used to designate resonance multiplicities.",

The mixture was diluted with EtOAc, washed with brine, and then with water. The organic layer was separated, dried over anhydrous Na 2 SO 4 , and evaporated under reduced pressure. Products were purified by chromatography on a silica gel column using a gradient of EtOAc in hexanes. The products from these reactions were identical to those produced from the reactions of Bt-OTs for which full characterization is provided.",

As shown in Scheme 3, we reasoned that exclusive reaction via pathway a should produce an unlabeled product, reaction via pathway b and/or c should result in the [ 18 O]-labeled product, and competing pathways should result in a mixture of labeled and unlabeled products.With this mechanistic rationale two reactions of BOP were conducted in parallel with PhCH 2 OH as well as PhCH 2 [ 18 O]H and DBU. The product yields from both reactions were nearly identical (ca 39%). High-resolution mass spectrometric analysis indicated that the ratio of the peak areas [M + 2] + /[M] + was 0.015 for products from both reactions. Pathway a alone can account for this result and it appears that no leakage occurs via pathways b and c. A comparable [ 18 O]-labeling experiment was conducted with Bt-OTs, where again no incorporation of the label was observed in the product, and the ratio of the peak areas [M + 2] + /[M] + was 0.014. These results showed that both reagents, BOP and Bt-OTs, appear to react via similar pathways, not involving direct reactions at either the N1 or N3 atom in the benzotriazole ring. In support of this inference, a reaction of Bt-OTs with allyl alcohol was conducted at \u221278 \u00b0C.

Generally, with lower boiling alcohols, Bt-OTs was the limiting reagent, whereas Bt-OTs was used in excess with higher boiling ones. Also, if initial experiments gave poorer results with a lower amount of an alcohol, then reactions were conducted with higher excesses of the alcohol. Specific experimental and workup details are provided under the individual compound headings.The compound was synthesized from Bt-OTs (1.16 g, 4.0 mmol), 1-phenylethanol (580 \u03bcL, 4.8 mmol), and DBU (720 \u03bcL, 4.8 mmol) in anhydrous THF (20 mL) over 24 h at room temperature. The volatiles were evaporated and the crude material was purified on a silica gel column using 6% EtOAc in hexanes as eluting solvent. Compound 1e was obtained as a white solid (0.282 g, 77% yield).
