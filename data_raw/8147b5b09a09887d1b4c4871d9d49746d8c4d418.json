            "text": "Due to the enormous capacity of Staphylococcus aureus to acquire antibiotic resistance, it becomes imperative to develop vaccines for decreasing the risk of its life-threatening infections. Peptidoglycan (PGN) is a conserved and major component of S. aureus cell wall. However, it has not been used as a vaccine candidate since it is a thymus-independent antigen. In this study, we synthesized a multiple antigenic peptide, named MAP27, which comprised four copies of a peptide that mimics the epitope of PGN. After immunization with MAP27 five times and boosting with heat-inactivated bacterium one time, anti-MAP27 serum bound directly to S. aureus or PGN. Immunization with MAP27 decreased the bacterial burden in organs of BALB/c mice and significantly prolonged their survival time after S. aureus lethal-challenge. The percentage of IFN-\u03b3 + CD3 + T cells and IL-17 + CD4 + T cells in spleen, as well as the levels of IFN-\u03b3, IL-17A/F and CCL3 in spleen and lung, significantly increased in the MAP27-immunized mice after infection. Moreover, in vitro incubation of heat-inactivated S. aureus with splenocytes isolated from MAP27-immunized mice stimulated the production of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-17A/F. Our findings demonstrated that MAP27, as a thymus-dependent antigen, is efficient at eliciting T cell-mediated responses to protect mice from S. aureus infection. This study sheds light on a possible strategy to design vaccines against S. aureus.",

            "text": "Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), one of the most common Gram-positive bacterium, causes a series of life-threatening diseases including sepsis, bacteremia and necrotizing pneumonia etc [1, 2] . In recent years, the treatment has become more and more difficult for infections caused by methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), strains that are resistant to almost all the commonly used antibiotics [3] . This fact urges pharmaceutical companies to develop new and effective prophylactic vaccines and immunotherapies in the battle against the bacterium. However, attempts at making S. aureus vaccines have so far been unsuccessful [4, 5] . This failure has been attributed partly to the feature of the bacterium, which exhibits diverse arrays of virulence factors among individual clinical isolates, and can change its surface antigen repertoire potentially in different infection states [5] . Thus, it would be wise to select a conserved antigen that is expressed on bacterium persistently and steadily as a vaccine candidate. The second obstacle for development of S. aureus vaccine is that the relationship between the bacterium and the immune system remains ambiguous. S. aureus can evade the host immune system by inhibiting phagocytic uptake and its killing activity [6, 7] . Moreover, the effect of antibody-mediated opsonization is controversial [4, 5, 8] . Recently, more and more reports indicate that T cellmediated immune responses, especially stimulating and secreting cytokines such as IL-17 or IFN-\u03b3, might play an important role in prevention of S. aureus infection [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] .",

            "text": "Peptidoglycan (PGN) , accounting for about 50 percent weight of the bacterium wall, is made of polymeric meshwork of glycan strands crosslinked by short peptides [18] . In bacterium, PGN maintains the cell shape and osmotic pressure of cytoplasm. Therefore, it is a crucial and conservative component of S. aureus. However, as a thymus-independent antigen (TI antigen) with weak immunogenicity, PGN is not considered as a rational vaccine candidate. Mimetic peptides, acting as a thymus-dependent antigen (TD antigen) with relatively stronger immunogenicity, have been used as a promising surrogate for carbohydrate to generate vaccines. Immunization with a peptide, mimicking a carbohydrate antigen of tumor cells or polysaccharide in bacterium, could augment tumor-specific cellular responses or induce protective antibody responses to bacterium [19, 20] . Recently, we successfully obtained a series of PGNmimicking peptides from phage peptide library by using an anti-PGN mAb as the target [21] . In this study, we synthesized a multiple antigenic peptide (MAP), named MAP27, which carried four copies of an identical peptide derived from the screening of the phage peptide library. Immunization with MAP27 decreased the bacterial burden in organs of the mice and significantly prolonged their survival time after S. aureus lethal-challenge. This protection is mainly correlated with the induction of IFN-\u03b3-and IL-17A-producing T cells by MAP27 immunization.",

All mice were maintained under specific-pathogen-free conditions in a clean room at the Institute for Animal Experimentation in Southern Medical University. They were kept on a 12:12 h light-dark cycle with food and water provided ad libitum. Animal experiments were carried out in strict accordance with national guidelines for animal welfare. To alleviate pains, all mice were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/ kg) via abdominal cavity before S. aureus infection. According with the principle of animal ethics, the humane euthanasia was performed. During the bacterial lethal challenge, mice were observed every 2 hours for the first 48 hours, and the survival was monitored for at least 7 days. Mice that became moribund (such as hunched back, ruffled fur and lethargy), the survivors at the endpoint of observation during S. aureus lethal challenge, and the mice infected with S. aureus for three days were sacrificed by CO 2 asphyxiation.",

Therefore, MAP has been used as an immunogen for developing experimental vaccines against various pathogens [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] . Based on this fact, we synthesized a MAP, named MAP27 using standard Fmoc chemistry. MAP27 contains four copies of SP27, with C-terminus of each peptide linked with the non-immunogenic, lysine-based dendritic scaffold (Fig 1D) . The predicted molecular weight of MAP27 is 7137.7, big enough for immunization according to our previous work [21] .

We also found that serum from MAP27-immunized mice weakly reacted with PGN after the fifth MAP immunization (Fig 2B, at the 1/200 dilution) . In contrast, antibodies to S. aureus were not detected in the same samples (data not shown). As shown in previous studies, boosting with natural antigens after immunization with peptide could significantly enhance the immune response [33, 34] . Therefore, we boosted all of the three groups of mice with heat-inactivated S. aureus for only one time. Anti-S. aureus IgG from MAP27-immunized mice could be detected with a dilution of 1/200. Conversely, the serum samples from either MAPctrl-immunized mice (P = 0.016) or blank control mice (P = 0.002) produced no detectable antibodies (Fig 2C) . These results indicate that S. aureus boosting specifically augmented the immune responses triggered by MAP27 immunization.",

This fact led us to speculate that the protection effect is possibly through the in vivo T cell-mediated response. To test this hypothesis, we examined T cell-derived cytokines in spleen and lung from the mice three days post infection. As expected, the levels of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-17A/ F, cytokines mainly secreted by T cells, were remarkably higher in MAP27-immunized mice than in MAPctrl-immunized mice and blank control mice (Fig 4) . CCL3, a chemokine that activates macrophages and neutrophils [35, 36] , as well as enhances IFN-\u03b3 production [37] , was also increased in MAP27-immunized mice (Fig 4) .

            "text": "To date, the failure to develop an effective vaccine against S. aureus is partly due to the high complexity of the numerous virulence factors that are expressed at different infection stages. Considering this, Lin and colleagues suggested that immunogens might not be restricted to microbial virulence factors, but any target antigen that effectively induces T cell immune responses could be selected [16] . Here, we used PGN, a conserved cell wall component of S. aureus as the target, and designed a de novo synthetic multiple antigenic peptide (MAP27) for mimicking a PGN epitope. The immunization outcome could be affected by various route of immunization. For example, vaccination of antigens via eyes [40, 41] or oral route [42, 43] has been shown to induce specific tolerance in BALB/c mice. In this study, we found that subcutaneous immunization, with peptides emulsified with Freund's adjuvant, effectively induced immune response and protected the mice against S. aureus systemic infection. It would be very interesting to test whether other routes of immunization, such as via mucosal immunization, could further enhance the protective effect.",

            "text": "As shown in Fig 2B, immunization with MAP27 alone could only weakly induce IgG to bind to PGN. This can be explained by the fact that the peptide only mimics a single epitope of PGN, and possibly the peptide mimicking is not completely identical to the natural antigen. Moreover, as an artificial antigen, MAP27 probably has weaker immunogenicity compared to most of the protein immunogens. Since previous findings have showed that boosting with natural antigen after peptide immunization could induce a robust recall response [33, 34] , we modified our immunization strategy by boosting the mice with heat-inactivated S. aureus after MAP immunization. Our results demonstrated that boosting with natural antigen improved the binding of the sera to the bacteria (Fig 2C) . In contrast, the same boosting step had no effect on the control groups (Figs 2C and 3A ). This result is consistent with the previous finding that vaccination with heat-killed S. aureus before infection does not affect bacterium outcome [44] .",

            "text": "Although the titer of sera against PGN or S. aureus is low, MAP27-immunization could still protect the mice from S.aureus systemic infection (Fig 3) . Previous studies have demonstrated that IL-17 and Th17 are critical for protection from S.aureus infection [9, 11, 14] . Moreover, IFN-\u03b3 is universally considered to improve the survival of staphylococcemia mice by activating marcrophages and neutrophils to kill bacteria [45] . M1-polarized macrophages stimulated with IFN-\u03b3 could also inhibit the formation of S. aureus biofilm [46] . Based on these facts, we hypothesized that the protection is possibly through the activation of T cell-mediated responses. Several evidences to support this hypothesis were presented in this study: 1) Levels of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-17A/F were significantly increased in the early stage of bloodstream infection (Fig 4) ; 2) Both IFN-\u03b3 + CD3 + CD4 + Th1 cells and IL-17 + CD3 + CD4 + Th17 cells significantly increased in MAP27-immunized mice after infection ( Fig 5) ; 3) Our in vitro assay showed that splenocytes from MAP27-immunized mice specifically recognized S. aureus and produced IFN-\u03b3 and IL-17 (Fig 7) . Interestingly, we found that IFN-\u03b3 + CD3 + CD4 -T cells also increased in MAP27-immunized mice post infection (Fig 5B and 5C ). We speculated that MAP27 immunization might induce different subsets of T cells to secrete IFN-\u03b3 post infection. For example, CD8 + T and \u03b3\u03b4 T cells have been reported to secrete IFN-\u03b3 and protect mice from S. aureus systemic infection [17, 47, 48] . Heat-inactivated S. aureus promoted Th1 and Th17 cell responses in the spleen of MAP27-immunized mice. Five days after the last booster with heat-inactivated bacteria, the splenocytes isolated from the mice (n = 5 mice per group) were cultured (2\u00d710 5 /well), and stimulated with 2\u00d710 4 CFU/well heated-inactivated S. aureus for 72 h. The concentrations of IL-2 (A), IFN-\u03b3 (B), IL-17A/F (C) and IL-4 (D) were measured by ELISA. The isolated splenocytes were also cultured at 4\u00d710 5 /well in pre-coated plates and stimulated with heat-inactivated S. aureus for 24 h. Frequency of IFN-\u03b3-producing (E) and IL-17Aproducing cells (F) was determined by ELISPOT. Cell numbers were shown in box and Whisker plots.
