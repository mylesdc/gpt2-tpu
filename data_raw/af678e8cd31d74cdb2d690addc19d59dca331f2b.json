Animal-tohuman transmission occurs upon exposure to rodent excreta and secretions, i.e. urine and saliva, and human-to-human transmission occurs via the bodily fluids of an infected person. To elucidate the seasonal drivers of LF epidemics, we employed a mathematical model to analyse the datasets of human infection, rodent population dynamics and climatological variations and capture the underlying transmission dynamics. The surveillance-based incidence data of human cases in Nigeria were explored, and moreover, a mathematical model was used for describing the transmission dynamics of LF in rodent populations. While quantifying the case fatality risk and the rate of exposure of humans to animals, we explicitly estimated the corresponding contact rate of humans with infected rodents, accounting for the seasonal population dynamics of rodents. Our findings reveal that seasonal migratory dynamics of rodents play a key role in regulating the cyclical pattern of LF epidemics. The estimated timing of high exposure of humans to animals coincides with the time shortly after the start of the dry season and can be associated with the breeding season of rodents in Nigeria.",

In this study, we provide quantitative analysis of external forcing of infection, as applied to Lassa haemorrhagic fever (LF), a widespread disease in West Africa.

Current viral hotspots are focused on West African countries, namely, Nigeria, Guinea, Benin, Sierra Leone and Liberia. The animal reservoir of the virus is Mastomys natalensis, also known as multimammate mouse, which is a rodent species that is widespread in the region. Although the main transmission route remains zoonotic, i.e. animal-to-human, contracting the virus through exposure to contaminated excreta or secretions from rodents [5] , another frequently reported route is human-to-human transmission, via contact exposure to the virus from the blood or bodily fluids of an infected person. The latter contributes to approximately 19% of all reported cases and is usually observed during nosocomial outbreaks [6] . Hence, the overall transmission pattern is primarily driven by environmental exposure to LF [3] rather than sustained human-to-human transmission chains, being different from Ebola virus disease [7] . Given the importance of the human-animal interface, we anticipate that environmental factors may be crucial driving forces contributing to the frequent recurrence of LF outbreaks.",

Because higher estimates of the CFR are likely due to underreporting and ascertainment bias, we are able to account for this observational matter and estimate an underreporting factor. Similarly to our recent work [11] , we assume that fatal cases are certainly reported in the surveillance system throughout the whole year, while less severe, non-lethal cases are likely to be missed. Such variation may especially be the case during low-risk periods, when LF infections are not frequently reported.",

The formulation resulted in two Poisson-and binomially distributed likelihood functions for describing the LF incidence and mortality, respectively (electronic supplementary material, appendix B). We identified two distinct periods of a year which were separately analysed owing to considerably different levels of observed transmission activity: (i) a low-risk period with a weekly exposure rate of 6.4 (CrI: 0-32.5; maximum-likelihood estimate (MLE): 9.6) lasting from week 9 (26 February to 4 March in 2018, CrI: 5 -13) to week 50 (10 December to 16 December in 2018; CrI: 47 -52), and (ii) the rest of the year, characterized by a higher risk of contracting the virus, with the average weekly exposure rate reaching 24.7 (CrI: 0-111.7; MLE: 38.1), which exceeded the low-risk period by approximately four times. The CFR was estimated at 4.9% (CrI: 0-54.4; MLE: 8.9%). If we assume the unbiased value of the CFR at 2%, the reporting coverage can be estimated to be as low as 40%.

During that period, the number of infected rodents was smaller than for the rest of the year. We therefore propose that a factor other than seasonal fluctuations in the number of infected rodents may play a role in driving LF seasonal epidemics.",

This was also confirmed by the start and end times of the high/low exposure periods, which approximately coincide with the start and the end of the rainy season (cf. figure 1b; electronic supplementary material, figure S4 ).

The relative risk of acquiring LF infection during the high-risk period was five times greater than during the rest of the year. In our search for a possible explanation, we identified that the rainfall pattern was negatively and highly correlated with LF incidence. The rainfall does not affect the transmissibility of the virus directly, but it is noteworthy that rodents migrate to within close proximity to human settlements to breed and hibernate during the dry season. This in turn leads to an increase in the contact rate of humans with rodents, and as a consequence, a higher probability of acquiring LF infection.",

The migration of rodents was notified as a main factor in another report [23] . Our findings confirm the importance of the combined effect of these two factors on the seasonality of LF epidemics and offer a quantitative estimation of their strength, which has never to our knowledge been done in the past. When the rainy season ends in November, the breeding season for rodents starts about two months later. At that time, newly born offspring and scarcity of food on the ground force mature rodents to approach humanoccupied areas. Consequently, this may lead to a rise in the contact frequency between humans and infected rodents. This high-exposure frequency persists until the rainy season starts again the following year, at which point the rodents migrate back to the ground and we observe the subsequent decline in human cases of LF. These findings highlight the importance of seasonal ecology of animal hosts in explaining the seasonality of LF epidemics. Similar findings have been reported for many other diseases, not only for those of an epizootic nature, e.g. [24, 25] , but also for insect-vectored plant diseases [26] . This points to rather general applicability of our approach that may frame the spillovers of other pathogens with two epizootic transmission routes. An important achievement of the present study was that we were able to offer quantitative estimates of the impact of the two risk factors, rainfall pattern and migration of rodents, on the exposure probability of humans to LF infection. This highlights the importance for preventive measures that aim to contain seasonal epidemics of LF to be specifically designed: (i) to control rodent populations and reduce the encounter frequency of rodents and humans, and (ii) to raise awareness among local residents. This can be envisioned as an eradication campaign, especially in rural areas with agronomic activities, and in public markets in urban areas, where rodents are frequently seen. Preventive measures may also include improved hygiene practices, hiding food from rodents during the night time, or designing educational campaigns that raise awareness of LF pathogenicity. The implementation of such programmes would be expected to lead to a decline in LF cases in the near future.",

An important estimate previously reported in the literature [6] indicated that ca 19% of all infections are attributed to the human-to-human transmission route, leading to the following requirement: h w /(h w \u00fe a w ) \u00bc r \u00bc 0.19. We can then express the total exposure rate e w solely through the exposure rate a w such that: e w \u00bc a w /(1 2 r). This expression was used in our framework to avoid a detailed modelling of the human-to-human transmission route. Owing to limited humanto-human transmission potential, we focused only on exposure to the virus through a contaminated environment. Qualitatively, it has been noted that the incidence of infections is likely to rise in the first two to three months of each calendar year. We accounted for this in our model by incorporating seasonal variations in the weekly exposure rate a wc as a function of the calendar week w c (1 w c 52).

To adjust for the differences in climatological profile between the two countries, we shifted the dynamics royalsocietypublishing.org/journal/rstb Phil. Trans. R. Soc. B 374: 20180268 fitted to the Tanzania data by a time lag equal to the difference between the starting times of the dry season in the two countries. Specifically, we defined this time lag by comparing historical rainfall averages for the time period 1901-2015 (electronic supplementary material, figure S4 ). We then implemented known measurements of the LF prevalence in rodents captured in Nigeria in the dry and rainy seasons separately, and we accounted for a non-zero probability of vertical transmission of the virus and its antibodies, as previously observed in rodents (see [16] for details).",
