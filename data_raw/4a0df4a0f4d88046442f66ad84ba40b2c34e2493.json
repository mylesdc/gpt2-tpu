            "text": "The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of renal epithelial cells (RTECs) has pivotal roles in the development of renal fibrosis. Although the interaction of lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA-1) on leukocytes and its ligand, intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), plays essential roles in most inflammatory reactions, its pathogenetic role in the EMT of RTECs remains to be clarified. In the present study, we investigated the effect of the interaction of LFA-1 on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and ICAM-1 on HK-2 cells after stimulation with TGF-b 1 on the EMT of RTECs. ICAM-1 was highly expressed in HK-2 cells. After TGF-b 1 stimulation, the chemokines CCL3 and CXCL12 increased on HK-2 cells. After co-culture of PBMCs and HK-2 cells pre-stimulated with TGF-b 1 (0.1 ng/ml) (HK-2-TGF-b 1 (0.1)), the expression of the active form of LFA-1 increased on PBMCs; however, total LFA-1 expression did not change. The expression of the active form of LFA-1 on PBMCs did not increase after co-culture with not CCL3 but CXCL12 knockdown HK-2-TGF-b 1 (0.1). The expression of epithelial cell junction markers (E-cadherin and occludin) further decreased and that of mesenchymal markers (vimentin and fibronectin) further increased in HK-2-TGF-b 1 (0.1) after co-culture with PBMCs for 24 hrs (HK-2-TGF-b 1 (0.1)-PBMCs). The phosphorylation of ERK 1/2 but not smad2 and smad3 increased in HK-2-TGF-b 1 (0.1)-PBMCs. The snail and slug signaling did not increase HK-2-TGF-b 1 (0.1)-PBMCs. Although the migration and invasion of HK-2 cells induced full EMT by a high dose (10.0 ng/ml) and long-term (72-96 hrs) TGF-b 1 stimulation increased, that of HK-2-TGF-b 1 (0.1)-PBMCs did not increase. These results suggested that HK-2 cells stimulated with TGF-b 1 induced conformational activation of LFA-1 on PBMCs by increased CXCL12. Then, the direct interaction of LFA-1 on PBMCs and ICAM-1 on HK-2 cells activated ERK1/2 signaling to accelerate the part of EMT of HK-2 cells induced by TGF-b 1.",

            "text": "Regardless of the underlying etiology, tubulointerstitial fibrosis is a common mechanism in the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) to end-stage renal disease [1, 2] . This progressive pathway involves interstitial infiltration by inflammatory mononuclear leukocytes [1, 3] . Integrin lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA-1: a L b 2 integrin) is the predominant integrin on leukocytes and an important molecule in firm adhesion and migration of leukocytes to inflammatory sites [4, 5] . LFA-1 also plays pivotal roles as a signal transduction molecule by binding its ligand, namely, intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) [6, 7] . Normally, LFA-1 is expressed in a low-affinity state for its ligand and, thus, cells do not make unnecessary adhesive contacts while in circulation [8, 9] . The affinity of LFA-1 for ICAM-1 is mediated by a conformational change of LFA-1 and they play essential roles in most inflammatory reactions [8, 9] . ICAM-1 has been reported to be expressed on renal tubular epithelial cells (RTECs) and the expression of ICAM-1 on RTECs was found to be associated with the infiltration of leukocytes in CKD [10, 11] . An experimental animal study showed that ICAM-1 was promptly up-regulated after renal injury and leukocyte infiltration subsequently occurred [12] . Kelly et al. reported that anti-ICAM-1 mAb mitigated leukocyte infiltration in tubulointerstitial space in an ischemic renal injury animal model [13] . Although these results suggested that ICAM-1 on RTECs and LFA-1 on leukocytes have some roles in the progression of renal diseases, the pathogenetic roles of their direct interaction in renal fibrosis remain unclear.",

HK-2 cells after stimulation of TGF-b 1 (0.1 ng/ml) for 24 hrs were co-cultured with PBMCs for a further 24 hrs (HK-2-TGF-b 1 (0.1)-PBMCs). Then, the changes of epithelial cell junction markers and mesenchymal markers on HK-2-TGF-b 1 (0.1)-PBMCs were investigated by real-time RT-PCR and western blotting analysis. HK-2 cells after stimulation of TGF-b 1 (0.1 ng/ml) without coculture with PBMCs (HK-2-TGF-b 1 (0.1)) and HK-2 cells without stimulation of TGF-b 1 co-cultured with PBMCs (HK-2-PBMCs) were investigated as control experiments. The results of real-time RT-PCR showed that the expression of epithelial cell junction markers (E-cadherin and occludin) further significantly decreased and that of mesenchymal markers (vimentin and fibronectin 1) further significantly increased in HK-2-TGF-b 1 (0.1)-PBMCs compared with those of controls. These EMT marker changes on HK-2-TGF-b 1 (0.1)-PBMCs were blocked by anti-LFA-1 mAb or anti-ICAM-1 mAb, whereas they were not blocked by isotype control mAb (Figure 4 ). Phase contrast microscopy analysis showed that HK-2-TGF-b 1 (0.1)-PBMCs changed more, morphologically, from a cobblestone-like monolayer to spindle-shaped fibroblast-like cells, than the controls. These morphological changes of HK-2-TGF-b 1 (0.1)-PBMCs were mitigated by anti-LFA-1 mAb or anti-ICAM-1 mAb, whereas they were not mitigated by isotype control mAb ( Figure The interaction of HK-2 cells pre-stimulated with TGF-b 1 and PBMCs up-regulated TGF-b 1 level in co-culture media To investigate whether pre-stimulation of HK-2 cells by TGFb 1 contributes to EMT or just induces the CXCL12 that activates LFA-1 on PBMCs, we employed a transwell co-culture system as described above. HK-2 cells without TGF-b 1 stimulation and PBMCs were co-cultured in a lower plate and HK-2 cells prestimulated by TGF-b 1 (10.0 ng/ml, 1.0 ng/ml and 0.1 ng/ml) were cultured in an upper insert. After 24 hrs of incubation, TGFb 1 concentrations in the media in the lower wells were determined by TGF-b 1 ELISA. The concentrations of TGF-b 1 in the coculture media of HK-2 cells and PBMCs in the lower wells were about threefold higher than those of HK-2 cells alone (Fig. 6 ).",

The decrease of expression level of epithelial cell junction markers and increase of expression level of mesenchymal markers on HK-2 cells after stimulation of TGF-b 1 were accelerated by co-culture with PBMCs. These EMT marker changes on HK-2 cells were mitigated by anti-LFA-1 mAb or anti-ICAM-1 mAb. These results demonstrated that the direct interaction of LFA-1 on PBMCs and ICAM-1 on HK-2 cells contributed to accelerate TGF-b 1 -induced EMT on HK-2 cells. HK-2 cells stimulated by TGF-b 1 induced conformational activation of LFA-1 on PBMCs; however, HK-2 cells without stimulation by TGF-b 1 or TGF-b 1 alone did not induce conformational activation of LFA-1 on PBMCs. The locally secreted chemokines can trigger integrin-dependent adhesion of circulating leukocytes that leads to infiltration [19, 20, 21, 22] . Several studies have characterized the expression pattern of chemokines in animal models of tubulointerstitial disease [23, 24, 25] . They demonstrated that various chemokines such as CCL2, CCL3, CCL4 and CCL5 are expressed only in the diseased compartment of the kidney and renal chemokine expression has been found to correlate with the leukocyte accumulation area and renal damage [23, 24, 25, 26] . On the basis of these findings, we investigated the regulation of the chemokines that may mediate LFA-1 activation of PBMCs on HK-2 cells by the stimulation of TGF-b 1 . CCL2 decreased on HK-2 cells by stimulation of TGF-b 1. This result was consistent with a previous study [27] . CCL3 and CXCL12 increased on HK-2 cells by TGF-b 1 stimulation. CCL21 did not change on HK-2 cells by TGF-b 1 stimulation. CCL3, CCL4, CCL17, CCL19, CCL20 and CCL22 were not detected on HK-2 cells either before or after TGF-b 1 stimulation. CCL3 and CXCL12 were reported to activate LFA-1 on both monocytes and lymphocytes [28, 29, 30, 31, 32] . In the present study, not CCL3 but CXCL 12 contributed to induction of the conformational activation of LFA-1 on PBMCs, because less AL57-positive cells were detected among PBMCs after co-culture with CXCL12 knockdown HK cells compared with those among Mock, CCL3 knockdown and control knockdown HK-2 cells pre-stimulated with TGF-b 1. Furthermore, the EMT marker changes of HK-2 cells pre-stimulated with TGFb 1 and morphological changes upon co-culture with PBMC were inhibited by CXCL12 knockdown on HK-2 cells (Figures S2 and  S3 ). These results suggested that CXCL12 was a key chemokine for EMT of RTECs that induced TGF-b 1 accelerated by PBMCs.",

            "text": "Since TGF-b 1 is up-regulated in the fibrotic kidney and is the main inducer of EMT in RTECs [17, 18] , we determined TGFb 1 concentration in the co-culture media of HK-2 cells and PBMCs with non-direct contacted culture with HK-2 cells pre-stimulated by TGF-b 1 using transwell plate to investigate whether prestimulation of HK-2 cells by TGF-b 1 contributes to EMT on RTECs or just induces the CXCL12 that activates LFA-1 on PBMCs. TGF-b 1 concentrations of the co-culture media of HK-2 cells and PBMCs were about threefold up-regulated compared with those of HK-2 cells without PBMCs. These results suggested that the pre-stimulation of HK-2 cells by TGF-b 1 contributes to increase not only chemokine production but also up-regulation of TGF-b 1 that induced EMT in RTECs upon the interaction of RTECs and PBMCs. We conducted real-time RT-PCR to detect the change of the TGF-b 1 mRNA in the HK-2 cells that underwent EMT and PBMCs in the lower plate separately at several time points after co-culture; however, we could not detect up-regulation of TGF-b 1 mRNA in both these HK-2 cells and PBMCs (data not shown). Although further study will be needed to investigate the regulation of TGF-b 1 on the interaction of LFA-1 on PBMCs and ICAM-1 on RTECs, the up-regulation of TGF-b 1 concentrations of the co-culture media of HK-2 cells and PBMCs also suggested In the EMT of RTECs, smad2 and smad3 were mainly mediated by TGF-b 1 [33] . In the present study, the phosphorylation of smad2 and smad3 was not detected in HK-2 cells by the stimulation of TGF-b 1 for 24 hrs before and after co-culture with PBMCs. This lack of phosphorylation of smad2 and smad3 is considered to be due to the low concentration of TGF-b 1 (0.1 ng/ ml) because phosphorylation of smad2 and smad3 on HK-2 cells was detected after stimulation with higher concentrations of TGFb 1 (10.0 ng/ml) for 24 hrs (data not shown). Xie et al. reported that the activation of ERK pathway was required for TGF-b 1induced EMT of RTECs [34] . Schramek et al. reported that longterm ERK1/2 activation was an important mechanism involved in the EMT of HK-2 cells [35, 36] . In addition to the role of ICAM-1 as an adhesion molecule, ICAM-1 also has roles as a signal HK-2 cells co-cultured with PBMCs for 24 hrs following TGF-b 1 (0.1 ng/ml) stimulation (D). HK-2 cells co-cultured with PBMCs with pre-incubated anti-LFA-1 mAb following TGF-b 1 (0.1 ng/ml) stimulation for 24 hrs (E). HK-2 cells pre-incubated with anti-ICAM-1 mAb co-cultured with PBMCs following TGF-b 1 (0.1 ng/ml) stimulation for 24 hrs (F). HK-2 cells pre-incubated with isotype control mAb co-cultured with PBMCs following TGF-b 1 (0.1 ng/ml) stimulation for 24 hrs (G). Magnification 1006. HK cells were co-cultured with PBMCs for 24 hrs following TGF-b 1 (0.1 ng/ml) stimulation for 24 hrs. Then, the changes of the epithelial markers (E-cadherin and occludin) and the mesenchymal markers (vimentin and fibronectin 1) on HK-2 cells (HK-2-TGF-b 1 (0.1)-PBMCs) were assessed by western blotting analysis (H). For blocking the interaction of LFA-1 and ICAM-1, before co-culture, PBMCs were pre-incubated with anti-LFA-1 mAb for 20 minutes (Anti-LFA-1 mAb ) or HK-2 cells were pre-incubated with anti-ICAM-1 for 20 minutes (Anti-ICAM-1 mAb) or isotype control mAb for 20 minutes (Isotype mAb). HK-2 cells without co-culture with PBMCs following TGF-b 1 (0.1 ng/ml) stimulation for 24 hrs (TGF-b 1 (0.1)) and HK-2 cells without stimulation of TGF-b 1 co-cultured with PBMCs (PBMCs) were investigated as control. One representative immunoblot is presented at the top of the graph. Values are expressed as mean 6 SEM of at least three experiments. *P,0.05. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0023267.g005 transduction molecule [37, 38, 39] . With the interaction of LFA-1 with ICAM-1 and the formation of ICAM-1 multimers within the cell membrane, signal transduction is initiated [40, 41] . ICAM-1 with associated proteins such as Grb2, SOS and Shc can lead to downstream activation of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway, including ERK1/2 [38, 42] . The ERK1/2 proteins were most commonly activated through ICAM-1 ligation [38, 40] . In the present study, phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was detected on HK-2 cells after stimulation of TGF-b 1 co-cultured with PBMCs. This phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was blocked by anti-LFA-1 mAb or anti-ICAM-1 mAb. These results suggested that ERK 1/2 may be activated through ICAM-1 on HK-2 cells by the interaction of ICAM-1 on HK-2 cells and LFA-1 on PBMCs. LFA-1 also acts as a signal transduction molecule when it binds ligands [7] . Although ICAM-1 expression still showed a high level in HK-2 cells by TGF-b 1 stimulation, its suppression by TGF-b 1 might be an inhibition factor for EMT of HK-2 cells by the interaction of ICAM-1 of HK-2 cells and LFA-1 of PBMCs. Further study will be needed to investigate the mechanism and significance of the regulation of ICAM-1 expression, the signaling pathway that affects EMT of HK-2 cells on PBMCs by the interaction of LFA-1 on PBMCs and ICAM-1 on HK-2 cells.",

A large proportion of the interstitial fibroblasts in fibrotic kidneys have been reported to originate from proximal tubular cells in an animal model [16] . Clinical studies utilizing human kidney biopsies also suggest that EMT plays a role in the pathogenesis of renal fibrosis [43, 44, 45] . Furthermore, EMT of RTECs was well correlated with declining renal function [43, 45] . The renal fibrosis also involved interstitial infiltration of inflammatory mononuclear leukocytes [3] . Thus, our finding suggested that inflammatory mononuclear leukocytes contributed to renal fibrosis by accelerating EMT of RTECs.",

CCL2 was down-regulated but CCL3 and CXCL12 were up-regulated on HK-2 cells by TGF-b 1 stimulation in a dose-dependent manner. CCL21 did not change on HK-2 cells by TGFb 1 stimulation.

HK-2 cells treated with TGF-b 1 (10.0 ng/ml) (HK-2-TGF-b 1 (10)) served as controls of TGF-b 1 -induced full EMT of HK-2 cells. Mock, HK-2-TGF-b 1 (0.1) and HK-2-PBMCs were investigated as control experiments. Although snail and slug signaling and a-SMA expression significantly increased in HK-2-TGF-b 1 (10) at 48 hrs, 72 hrs and 96 hrs, they did not increase in HK-2-TGF-b 1 (0.1)-PBMCs, HK-2-TGF-b 1 (0.1) and HK-2-PBMCs compared with those of Mock (Figure 8). Furthermore, we investigated the migration and invasion of HK-2-TGFb 1 (0.1)-PBMC. Although the migration of HK-2-TGF-b 1 (10) significantly increased at 72 hrs and 96 hrs with a transient decrease at 48 hrs, that of HK-2-TGF-b 1 (0.1)-PBMCs did not change compared with those of Mock, HK-2-TGF-b 1 (0.1) and HK-2-PBMCs at 72 hrs and 96 hrs with a transient decrease at 48 hrs (Figure 9A).

Although snail and slug signaling and a-SMA expression significantly increased in HK-2-TGF-b 1 (10), they did not increase in HK-2-TGF-b 1 (0.1)-PBMCs at 48 hrs, 72 hrs and 96 hrs, the same as HK-2-PBMCs and HK-2-TGF-b 1 (0.1). Furthermore, the migration of HK-2-TGF-b 1 (10) significantly increased at 72 hrs and 96 hrs with a transient decrease at 48 hrs; however, that of HK-2-TGF-b 1 (0.1)-PBMCs did not change compared with those of Mock, HK-2-TGF-b 1 (0.1) and HK-2-PBMCs at 72 hrs and 96 hrs with a transient decrease at 48 hrs. Although the invasion of HK-2-TGF-b 1 (10) also increased at 96 hrs with a transient decrease at 48 hrs, that of HK-2-TGFb 1 (0.1)-PBMC did not change compared with those of Mock, HK-2-TGF-b 1 (0.1) and HK-2-PBMCs at 48 hrs, 72 hrs and 96 hrs. These results suggested that TGF-b 1 (0.1) is not sufficient to induce EMT of RTECs and the interaction of LFA-1 of PBMCs and ICAM-1 of RTECs pre-stimulated with TGF-b 1 (0.1) contributed to the early part of EMT of RTECs. Taking these findings together, the low level of TGF-b 1 that could not induce EMT of RTECs by itself may contribute to EMT of RTECs by inducing the interaction of ICAM-1 of RTECs and LFA-1 on PBMCs, leading to activation of the signaling through ICAM-1 and self-sustained activation of TGF-b 1 on RTECs .",
