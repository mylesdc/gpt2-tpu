Less attention is given to why and how virus fitness results from the success of virus transmission. Virus transmission reflects the infection-shedding-transmission dynamics, and with it, the organ system involvement and other, macroscopic dimensions of the host environment. This study describes the transmission ecology of the world main livestock viruses, 36 in total, a mix of RNA, DNA and retroviruses. Following an iterative process, the viruses are virtually ranked in an outer-to inner-body fashion, by organ system, on ecological grounds. Also portrayed are the shifts in virus host tropism and virus genome. The synthesis of the findings reveals a predictive virus evolution framework, based on the outer-to inner-body changes in the interplay of host environment-transmission modes-organ system involvement-host cell infection cycle-virus genome. Outer-body viruses opportunistically respond to the variation in the external environment. For example, respiratory and enteric viruses tend to be associated with poultry and pig mass rearing. Ruminant and equine viruses tend to be more deep-rooted and host-specific, and also establish themselves in the vital inner-body systems. It is concluded that the framework may assist the study of new emerging viruses and pandemic risks.",

It has been proposed that transmissible viruses correlate with replication and virulence and that virus persistence instead permits a lower transmission rate [1] . This insight builds on earlier work suggesting that virus persistence may pave the way for virus-host symbiosis [2] . Viruses are considered essential agents within the roots and stems of the tree of life [3] . For example, RNA viruses in vertebrates tend to broadly follow the evolutionary history of their hosts that began in the ocean and extended for hundreds of millions of years [4] . The symbiotic virus-host relationships can take many forms, from antagonistic to mutualistic, and viruses, like other symbionts, lie on a continuum that can shift with environmental changes [5] .",

Virus transmission may be considered to present the backbone of virus ecology, determining the viruses selected for. Unfortunately, the current classification of animal viruses emphasizes the importance of virus genomic architecture and the host cell infection cycle [6] . Less attention is given to why and how virus fitness results from the virus transmission success. For example, an animal virus may become established in the upper respiratory tract and transmit via aerosols to the next host. An enteric virus features a fecal-oral cycle. A skin virus may transmit on the basis of touch. A virus colonizing the distal urogenital tract may transmit during sexual contact. Hence, an analysis of the virus transmission success requires a consideration of the overt clinical signs of infection, the gross pathology, the matching virus shedding profile, and of the ensuing modes of transmission.",

            "text": "The current analysis explores how the virus molecular world and the macroscopic dimensions of the host environment are intertwined, integral to one and the same virus transmission ecology. In vertebrate hosts the more vital organ systems are shielded off from external aggressors, small or large. It may be assumed that also the host immune defenses are structured to ensure that harmful viral pathogens remain confined to the outer-body environment, the epithelia. Epithelial viruses interface with the external environment and respond to the variation encountered here. Opposingly, infiltrative viruses establish in the inner-body environment and are expected to evolve towards a more intimate virus-host relationship. Given that the virus-host relationship changes with the position of the virus in the outer-to inner-body continuum the analysis focuses on the extent of virus host-body infiltration. The virus organ system tropism is assumed to evolve in harmony with the virus cell tropism. This may be inferred from the dichotomy in the release of viruses from epithelial cells. Apart from direct cell-to-cell transmission [7] , viruses may be released from the apical cell surface and so end-up in the outer-body environment. These viruses colonize mucosae and skin. In contrast, viruses released from the basolateral cell surface infiltrate underlying tissues. These viruses end-up in the lymph drainage, enter the blood circulation and so may infect any of the internal organs. Infiltration of and establishment in the inner-body environment may translate in additional, non-epithelial transmission modes. For example, virus establishment in the reproductive organs may translate in intrauterine or lactogenic transmission [8] . In birds, virus may be shed into yolk or albumen and so transmit vertically [9] . Virus circulation in the bloodstream may enable virus transmission via needles or arthropod vectors [10] .",

The variables comprise the extent of virus host-body infiltration, the length of the infection period, the infection severity level, and the virus environmental survival rate. The one-to-three infiltration score reflects the organ systems involvement in infection-transmission and concerns, respectively, virus transmission based on the involvement of the epithelia, transmission involving epithelia and internal organs, and transmission involving just internal organs. The score for the length of the infection period reflects, respectively, acute, acute plus persistent, and persistent infections. Likewise, the score for the infection severity level concerns a case fatality of less than one, one to ten, and above ten percent. The score for the virus environmental survival rate refers to the number of days that the virus remains infective outside the host-body, ranging from up to three, three to ten, to over ten days. With one exception, the variables did not increase or decrease in value together. Just the association between the extent of virus host-body infiltration and the length of the infection period was found to be monotonic. Spearman correlation yielded an R = 0.58 and p < 0.0005. It was thus found that viruses infiltrating internal organs either cause persistent infections or a combination of acute and persistent infections.

Alimentary tract viruses were found to transmit on the basis of a fecal-oral cycle, through direct contact, contamination of feed and water, or involving fomites, persons and vehicles. Viruses infecting both respiratory and alimentary tract featured a mix of these transmission modes. Mostly, these viruses caused rather severe infections. Among the skin viruses, the more infiltrative viruses affecting all layers of the skin caused slowly healing lesions. The transmission of these deep-rooted skin viruses was found to rely on abrasion or biting flies rather than on direct touch or on indirect contact, more typical for superficial skin lesions. Some of the epithelial viruses are shed in feces over a prolonged time period, also in the absence of clinical signs, and these infections were considered to feature a systemic component. Next, the epithelial herpesviruses establishing latently in peripheral nerves and ganglia were found to cause a recurrence or persistence of the mucosal and/or skin infection, including of the distal urogenital tract and external genitalia.",

Virus infiltration of also immune and circulatory systems may yield in-apparent, persistent infections, indicating low levels of pathogenicity and/or enhanced host tolerance. The division between virus and host may become blurred and given enough time the two may become one [22] .",

For example, an opportunistic, epithelial virus of wildlife origin is likely to be found circulating in livestock before becoming first detected in humans as host. This has been the case for influenza [23] , Henipah [24] and MERS corona viruses [25] . Further, the SARS corona virus infected civet cats raised as food animals before appearing in humans as host [26] . In contrast, more infiltrative viruses establish in the vital inner-body systems. Specialist viruses circulating in the bloodstream of non-human primates may directly jump to humans as host, as a result of complex ecological, socio-economic, demographic and other drivers. Examples comprise HIV-aids [27] , Chikungunya [28] , and Zika viruses [29] . Hence, knowing how species jumps differ for the different host ecologies may assist the study of pandemic risks.",

Likewise, the score for the infection severity level concerns a case fatality of less than one, one to ten, and above ten percent. The score for the virus environmental survival rate refers to the number of days that the virus remains infective outside the host body, ranging from up to three, three to ten, to over ten days.
