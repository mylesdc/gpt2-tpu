            "text": "Results: A total of 1298 cases were collected and analyzed. Symptoms and signs upon admission at TCM and WM hospitals were cough (99.3% vs. 98.6%), rales (84.8% vs. 75.0%), phlegm (83.3% vs. 49.1%), and fever (74.9% vs. 84.0%) in frequency. Patients admitted to WM hospitals had symptoms and signs for a longer period prior to admission than patients admitted to TCM hospitals. Testing to identify etiologic agents was performed in 1140 cases (88.4%). Intravenous antibiotics were administered in 99.3% (595/598) of cases in TCM hospitals and in 98.6% (699/700) of cases in WM hospitals. Besides, Chinese herbal extract injection was used more frequently in TCM hospitals (491 cases, 82.1%) than in WM hospitals (212 cases, 30.3%) (p < 0.01). At discharge, 818 cases (63.0%) were clinically cured, with a significant difference between the cure rates in TCM (87.6%) and WM hospitals (42.0%) (OR = 9.8, 95% confidence interval (CI): 7.3~12.9, p < 0.01). Pathogen and previous medical history were more likely associated with the disappearance of rales (OR = 7.2, 95% CI: 4.8~10.9). Adverse effects were not reported from the medical records. Conclusions: Intravenous use of antibiotics is highly prevalent in children with community-acquired pneumonia regardless of aetiology. There was difference between TCM and WM hospitals with regard to symptom profile and the use of antibiotics. Intravenous use of herbal injection was higher in TCM hospitals than in WM hospitals. Most of the cases were diagnosed based on clinical signs and symptoms without sufficient confirmation of aetiology. Audit of current practice is urgently needed to improve care.",

In terms of surveillance, pneumonia is not even listed as a national notifiable infectious disease [9] , though in 2003 after the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), \"pneumonia of unknown cause\" was required to be reported because airborne etiologic agents such as the SARS coronavirus and human avian influenza virus (H5N1) are extremely pathogenic and capable of quickly causing an epidemic [10] . Moreover, China's current health policy of \"integration of TCM and Western medicine\" need large-scale surveys comparing cases of childhood pneumonia at TCM and WM hospitals. Whether for guiding healthcare policy or for improving disease management and prevention, evaluating quality of care in paediatric pneumonia is of paramount importance. Through the ages, WM hospitals hold a principle status in public health. TCM hospitals are gradually into mass vision, although at most time as a complementary role. The two types of hospitals have advantages and disadvantages. Commonly, WM hospitals prefer to acute severe disease, and TCM hospitals prefer to chronic mild disease. To exploring specific difference on pneumonia therapy between two types of hospitals, this cross-sectional study was designed to investigate the distribution, diagnosis, treatment, and clinical outcome of childhood community-acquired pneumonia in China.",

Percentages of children with histories of eczema, asthma, or allergic rhinitis were 10.0%, 4.1%, and 4.3%, respectively. Bronchial pneumonia was a complication of all asthma cases. There were also cases of undiagnosed asthma among patients with recurrent pneumonia. This seems to concur with other authors' findings. For example, Ozdemir and colleagues [20] reported that 30.6% of pneumonia inpatients had histories of asthma. Youn and Lee [22] found that history of asthma might increase the risk of pneumonia caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Our study found that onset of childhood pneumonia is closely associated with medical history, in particular with respiratory or atopic conditions. Therefore, attention should be focused on such children and preventive measures applied such as immunization [23, 24] and educating families about avoiding contact with allergens and other triggers. Significant difference existed between TCM and WM hospitals in the presenting symptoms and signs at admission. The World Health Organization's (WHO) guideline on the management of childhood pneumonia [25] has been widely adopted in developing countries. The guideline suggests that cough and dyspnea present high sensitivity and specificity as main indicators for pediatric pneumonia diagnosis. However, in China dyspnea is rarely applied to diagnose mild pediatric pneumonia because though respiratory rate is increased, it is still within normal range, especially in very young children. Instead, cough and auscultatory findings are more commonly used. In our study, the prevalence of cough at admission was similar between TCM hospitals and The odds ratio of adjusted gender, age, pathogen, previous medical history. f The odds ratio confidence interval of adjusted gender, age, pathogen, previous medical history. g The P value of adjusted gender, age, pathogen, previous medical history. WM hospitals. These data are concordant with WHO data [25] . Although there was significant difference between the two types of hospitals regarding other symptoms and signs, a large proportion of children presented with fever and rales. Duration of symptoms and signs in children before admission in WM hospitals was markedly longer than in children in TCM hospitals. We suspect that the two types of hospitals differ in regard to criteria for admission (such as severity of disease), ability of the family to afford hospitalization, or bed availability. Further studies are required to explore relevant factors that influence hospital intake.",

Other authors [33] [34] [35] have reported that macrolides are more effective in shortening disease duration and reducing severity of M pneumoniae pneumonia compared with other antibiotics. Macrolides are also more effective for a wide range of bacterial pathogens [33, 35] , which might be one of the reasons that in our study this class of antibiotics was widely used. However, macrolide resistance is a serious worldwide problem [36] [37] [38] . Suzuki and colleagues [35] reported that of 96 cases of M pneumoniae pneumonia in Yamagata, Japan, 83.0% were identified as macrolide-resistant. Cephalosporins are widely used for treating childhood pneumonia in China. In fact, there has been inappropriate use and abuse of cephalosporins in China [39, 40] , where cephalosporins use was higher than Northern England (36% in 542 children [41] ). In cases of pneumonia caused by M pneumoniae, cephalosporins are ineffective. In our study, among 1298 cases, 576 patients (44.4%) received third generation cephalosporins and 300 patients (23.1%) received second generation cephalosporins. In general, selection of antibiotics in China has not been based on drug sensitivity testing but on clinician experience or medical insurance policy. With the promulgation by the Chinese Ministry of Health in August 2012 of regulations on the rational use of antibiotics [42] , it is hoped that arbitrary administration of antibiotics, especially for childhood pneumonia, will be curbed.",

According to literature review, most common adverse reactions of Chinese herbal injections were rash and pruritus, diarrhea, or vomiting [51] .

In our study, fewer patients in TCM hospitals than in WM hospitals were reported as having symptoms, such as cough and sputum, at discharge. Shorter hospital stay in TCM hospitals may also be attributed to lower emphasis on strict adherence to discharge guidelines.

Treatment is rendered based on the quantity, quality, and color of sputum.
