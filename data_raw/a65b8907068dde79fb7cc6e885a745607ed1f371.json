            "text": "Understanding immune responses elicited by vaccines, together with immune responses required for protection, is fundamental to designing effective vaccines and immunisation programs. This study examines the effects of the route of administration of a live attenuated vaccine on its interactions with, and stimulation of, the murine immune system as well as its ability to increase survival and provide protection from colonisation by a virulent challenge strain. We assess the effect of administration method using the murine model for typhoid, where animals are infected with S. Typhimurium. Mice were vaccinated either intravenously or orally with the same live attenuated S. Typhimurium strain and data were collected on vaccine strain growth, shedding and stimulation of antibodies and cytokines. Following vaccination, mice were challenged with a virulent strain of S. Typhimurium and the protection conferred by the different vaccination routes was measured in terms of challenge suppression and animal survival. The main difference in immune stimulation found in this study was the development of a secretory IgA response in orally-vaccinated mice, which was absent in IV vaccinated mice. While both strains showed similar protection in terms of challenge suppression in systemic organs (spleen and liver) as well as survival, they differed in terms of challenge suppression of virulent pathogens in gut-associated organs. This difference in gut colonisation presents important questions around the ability of vaccines to prevent shedding and transmission. These findings demonstrate that while protection conferred by two vaccines can appear to be the same, the mechanisms controlling the protection can differ and have important implications for infection dynamics within a population.",

The global burden of typhoid has been estimated at 21.7 million infections annually with 217,000 deaths [2] . While strategies for the control of typhoid are reliant primarily on improving sanitation in developing countries, the use of antibiotics and vaccines is becoming more common [3] . Development of resistance to currently available antibiotics has led to a push for increased vaccine usage [4, 5] . There are two vaccines currently on the market, first a live attenuated S. Typhi strain (Ty21a) that is administered orally, and secondly a Vi polysaccharide subunit vaccine administered parenterally. Both these vaccines are only partially effective with studies finding 16-96% efficacy at 3yrs post vaccination for orally administered vaccines and 55-72% at 1.4-3yrs for injectable vaccines [1, [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] .",

This system has been used extensively to identify appropriate live-attenuated strains for vaccine use [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] , and to investigate the immune response required for both primary and secondary protection [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] In order to understand the potential difference in the immune responses elicited by different vaccination methods, it is important to understand the natural route (oral) of infection, and how this differs when immunisation is performed intravenously or by other methods that bypass the gut.",

Here the bacteria cross the epithelial barrier of the gut, either by active uptake by M-cells located predominantly in the Peyer's patches (PP) [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] , or through enterocytes [46] . The bacteria then travel through the gut associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) to either the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN), or directly to the bloodstream by uptake into macrophages, polymorphonuclear phagocytes (PMNs) and dendritic cells (DCs) [32] . Alternatively, bacteria may be engulfed by CX 3 CR1 hi mononuclear phagocytes directly from the gut [47, 48] . Once inside macrophages, PMNs and DCs, the bacteria travel to the spleen and liver where the bacteria multiply, forming multiple focal lesions which in extreme cases develop in to granulomatous lesions [49] . Transmission of bacteria to new hosts results from large bacterial numbers in the caecum and colon, which are shed in the faeces. The method of colonisation of these organs is yet to be determined, with two alternative, or possibly concurrent, processes being the reseeding of the gut from bacterial populations in the gall bladder or mesenteric lymph nodes, or alternatively from resident populations established in the gut.",

A series of studies using T-cell deficient mice reveal increased bacterial growth, chronic infections and increased host death [53, 55] . This is also true of B-cells, where mice lacking B-cells (Ig\u03bc -/-) show reduced survival to virulent challenge post-vaccination [34] . It is not just T-cells and Bcells in isolation that generate protection, but also the interactions between these components that are important. B-cells are important for effective activation of Salmonella-specific T-cells, as CD4 + T-cells from B-cell deficient mice have a reduced ability to produce Th-1 type cytokines [36, 56] . The reverse is also true, with T-cell-deficient mice, which have impaired T-cell activation or lack proper T-cell/B-cell communication, produce little antibody despite functional B-cells [33, 57] . Irrespective of the route taken in generating immunity through vaccination, it is generally believed that the key components required for effective control of secondary virulent salmonella infections are Th-1 type cytokines, specifically TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, and IL-12 and Salmonella-specific antibodies [31, 38, 58] .",

This study demonstrates that administering the same vaccine via different routes can result in significant differences in immune stimulation. In the murine typhoid model, these differences did not impact survival from secondary infections. The most obvious difference in immune response detected in this study is in the induction of specific secretory IgA (SIgA) in orally, but not IV vaccinated mice. These results indicate that early gut interactions are important for production of secretory IgA. IV vaccinated mice that have minimal to no bacterial colonisation of the PP and MLN, also fail to generate a detectable secretory IgA response. This is consistent with studies showing that colonisation of the PP is required for the induction of a SIgA response [65] .",

Our data shows that oral vaccination resulted in a significant reduction in colonisation in gut-associated organs from a secondary challenge compared with IV vaccinated mice. In IV-vaccinated mice, the colonisation levels in these organs are comparable to unvaccinated mice. This effect might be due to SIgA as previous studies have shown that mice that have no secretory antibody response (pIgR -/-) are more susceptible to infections with virulent strains [68] , and also that infections with Salmonella strains that are unable to be bound by SIgA result in higher levels of colonisation in systemic organs than SIgA sensitive strains [69] . However, in a study by Uren et al., immunised pIgR -/mice show similar protection against secondary colonisation of the gut-associated organs as C57BL/6 mice, indicating that it is not SIgA alone that is responsible for the reduced gut colonisation [70] .",

Instead, interactions of orally administered bacteria with the immune system in the gut-associated organs and GALT (gut-associate lymphoid tissue), as occurs during oral vaccination, appears to lead to more rapid development of serum antibodies, with peak serum IgG levels reached up to 4 weeks faster (in half the time) by oral vaccination.",

This may be either a positive, as it helps to generate immunity in the population as a whole, or a negative, as it puts immunocompromised individuals at serious risk.
