            "text": "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a chronic liver disease found worldwide. The present study aimed to evaluate the mechanisms of inhibiting lipid accumulation in free fatty acid (FFA)-treated HepG2 cells caused by bark and fruit extracts of Toona sinensis (TSB and TSF). FFA induced lipid and triglyceride (TG) accumulation, which was attenuated by TSB and TSF. TSB and/or TSF promoted phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and acetyl-coA carboxylase and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha upregulation. Furthermore, TSB and TSF suppressed FFA-induced liver X receptor, sterol regulatory element-binding transcription protein 1, fatty acid synthase, and stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 protein expression. Moreover, TSB and/or TSF induced phosphorylation of Unc-51 like autophagy-activating kinase and microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 expressions. Therefore, TSB and TSF relieve lipid accumulation by attenuating lipogenic protein expression, activating the AMPK pathway, and upregulating the autophagic flux to enhance lipid metabolism. Moreover, TSB and TSF reduced TG contents, implying the therapeutic use of TSB and TSF in NAFLD. by specific transport proteins and undergoes \u03b2-oxidation [5] [6] [7] [8] . Hyperinsulinemia directly inhibits \u03b2-oxidation of FFA, promoting hepatic de novo lipid synthesis through upregulation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) and carbohydrate response element-binding protein [5] [6] [7] [8] .",

The whole plant can be used in herbal remedies, and its tender leaves have been used in dishes or sauces for several years [13] . Until now, hundreds of phytochemical compounds have been identified in T. sinensis, including polyphenols (phenolic acid, flavonoids, stilbene, and lignan), terpenoids, and sterols [14] . It was reported that aqueous extract of leaves of T. sinensis (TSL-1) exhibits many biological functions, such as antiviral [15,16], antibacterial [17], antidiabetic [18], anti-obesity [19], hepatoprotective [20, 21] , and anti-cancer [22] [23] [24] functions. However, little is known about other parts of T. sinensis. Our preliminary results demonstrated that, among the root, leaves, bark, and fruit of T. sinensis, the bark and fruit could block lipid accumulation in hepatocytes. It has been shown that a diet with T. sinensis leaves, root, or bark (TSB) enhances sperm quality and improves memory in senescence-accelerated prone-8 mice [25] . T. sinensis fruit (TSF) extract exhibits strong antioxidative effects and protects the kidney from diabetic nephropathy [26] . The present study investigated the molecular mechanism of the effects of TSB and TSF extracts on lipid accumulation using an in vitro cellular model.",

FFA was added to the cells for another 24 h. Oil Red O and Nile red staining confirmed that TSB and TSF reduced FFA-induced lipogenesis in a concentration-dependent manner ( Figure 3A -C). In the TSB-treated group, the lipid content was reduced by 11%, 23%, and 39% at levels of 100, 200, and 500 \uf06dg/mL when compared with those in the FFA group ( Figure 3A upper panel and 3B ). In the TSF-treated group, the lipid content was reduced by 15%, 26%, and 30% at levels of 100, 200, and 500 \uf06dg/mL when compared with those in the FFA group ( Figure 3A lower panel and 3C). Co-treatment with TSB and FFA, or TSF and FFA, did not affect the cells' survival rates ( Figure 3D and E), whereas palmitic acid (150 and 450 \uf06dM) alone showed cytotoxicity to HepG2 cells ( Figure 3F ). To further investigate the anti-lipogenic effects in FFA-treated HepG2 cells, the TG levels were examined under the same experimental conditions. As shown in Figure 4 , both TSB and TSF significantly inhibited TG expression in cells ( Figure 4A ,B). In renal carcinoma cells, 786-O was used as the negative control, while fenofibrate was the positive control. Data were quantified for three to twelve independent experiments and expressed as mean \u00b1 SD. # P < 0.05 compared with the control group (0 g/mL)). * P < 0.05 compared with the FFA group.

TSB and TSF have also been used in traditional medicine [13] . In this study, we found that both TSB and TSF extracts blocked the increase of intracellular TG levels and lipid droplets in FFA-treated hepatocytes. Fatty acids transported to the liver are esterified to TG or oxidised to produce energy [34] . However, an increase in TG level is harmful to hepatocytes [35] . The levels of TSB and TSF extracts used in the study were nontoxic to cells. Interestingly, TSB was even more effective than fenofibrate (a hypolipidaemic PPAR\u03b1 agonist). The anti-steatotic effects of TSB and TSF on NAFLD in an in vivo model are currently being examined.",

AMPK has various physiological functions, such as regulation of energy homeostasis, autophagy, cell polarity, and cell proliferation [12, 36] . Previously, AMPK was considered as a potential target in NAFLD treatment [12] , by activating downstream target protein PPARwhile inhibiting SREBP-1 through LXR [36, 37] . LXRs' lipogenic activity arises from upregulation of the master regulator SREBP-1c and induction of FASN, ACC and SCD1 [38, 39] . Our data are consistent with this finding. TSB and TSF extracts activated AMPK activity while inhibiting FASN, ACC, SCD1, and LXR expression and TG accumulation. Our data showed that inhibition of AMPK activity by compound C deteriorated lipogenesis, suggesting that activation of AMPK by TSB or TSF is indispensable for improving lipid accumulation in FFA-treated HepG2 cells.",

ULK1 is a mammalian homologue of Atg1, which is the most upstream component of the autophagy pathway [11] . As the autophagy-initiating kinase, ULK can be directly phosphorylated by AMPK at six different sites during nutrient deprivation [11, 40] . TSB and/or TSF extracts induced autophagic flux accompanied by ULK1 phosphorylation at Ser555. Accordingly, inhibition of autophagosome formation by chloroquine significantly increased lipid accumulation in FFA-treated HepG2 cells. These results imply that TSB or TSF regulated lipid metabolism through autophagic mechanism. Thus, the upstream key regulator, which includes mammalian target of rapamycin and Akt, will be examined further.",

The present study indicates that TSB and TSF extracts attenuated hepatocellular lipid accumulation and that gallic acid, quercetin, rutin, and toosendanin are active components of the anti-steatotic effects of T. sinensis extracts. It has been reported that gallic acid, quercetin, and rutin exhibited anti-steatotic effects on high-fat-diet-fed mice [43, 44] . Toosendanin, a triterpenoid extracted from Meliaceae plants, is also known as the major ingredient in Meliaceae fruit, which has been reported to possess antiadipogenic activity in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes [45] . Interestingly, toosendanin in the nanomolar range completely inhibited lipid accumulation, while other compounds attenuated lipid accumulation by only 5%-10%. We suggest that TSB and TSF extracts were complex, and all ingredients in the extracts contributed partly to attenuate lipid accumulation in hepatocytes. Therefore, polyphenol-rich TSB and/or TSF may be a safe and potential herbal remedy to prevent NAFLD.",
