            "text": "The spread of disease through a physical-contact network and the spread of information about the disease on a communication network are two intimately related dynamical processes. We investigate the asymmetrical interplay between the two types of spreading dynamics, each occurring on its own layer, by focusing on the two fundamental quantities underlying any spreading process: epidemic threshold and the final infection ratio. We find that an epidemic outbreak on the contact layer can induce an outbreak on the communication layer, and information spreading can effectively raise the epidemic threshold. When structural correlation exists between the two layers, the information threshold remains unchanged but the epidemic threshold can be enhanced, making the contact layer more resilient to epidemic outbreak. We develop a physical theory to understand the intricate interplay between the two types of spreading dynamics. E pidemic spreading 1-6 and information diffusion 7-10 are two fundamental types of dynamical processes on complex networks. While traditionally these processes have been studied independently, in real-world situations there is always coupling or interaction between them. For example, whether large-scale outbreak of a disease can actually occur depends on the spread of information about the disease. In particular, when the disease begins to spread initially, individuals can become aware of the occurrence of the disease in their neighborhoods and consequently take preventive measures to protect themselves. As a result, the extent of the disease spreading can be significantly reduced [11] [12] [13] . A recent example is the wide spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in China in 2003, where many people took simple but effective preventive measures (e.g., by wearing face masks or staying at home) after becoming aware of the disease, even before it has reached their neighborhoods 14 . To understand how information spreading can mitigate epidemic outbreaks, and more broadly, the interplay between the two types of spreading dynamics has led to a new direction of research in complex network science 15 .",

Due to information diffusion, in a well-mixed population, the size of the epidemic outbreak can be reduced markedly. However, the epidemic threshold can be enhanced only when the awareness is sufficiently strong so as to modify the key parameters associated with the spreading dynamics such as the infection and recovery rates. A reasonable setting to investigate the complicated interplay between epidemic spreading and information diffusion is to assume two interacting network layers of of identical set of nodes, one for each type of spreading dynamics. Due to the difference in the epidemic and information spreading processes, the connection patterns in the two layers can in general be quite distinct. For the special case where the two-layer overlay networks are highly correlated in the sense that they have completely overlapping links and high clustering coefficient, a locally spreading awareness triggered by the disease spreading can raise the threshold even when the parameters in the epidemic spreading dynamics remain unchanged 16, 17 . The situation where the two processes spread successively on overlay networks was studied with the finding that the outbreak of information diffusion can constrain the epidemic spreading process 18 . An analytical approach was developed to provide insights into the symmetric interplay between the two types of spreading dynamics on layered networks 19 . A model of competing epidemic spreading over completely overlapping networks was also proposed and investigated, revealing a coexistence regime in which both types of spreading can infect a substantial fraction of the network 20 .",

However, in reality, the two networks can differ significantly in their structures. For example, in a modern society, information is often transmitted through electronic communication networks such as telephones 29 and the Internet 30 , but disease spreading usually takes place on a physical contact network 31 . The whole complex system should then be modeled as a double-layer coupled network (overlay network or multiplex network) [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] , where each layer has a distinct internal structure and the interplay between between the two layers has diverse characteristics, such as inter-similarity 37 , multiple support dependence 38 , and inter degree-degree correlation 39 , etc. The second issue is that the effects of one type of spreading dynamics on another are typically asymmetric 21 , requiring a modification of the symmetric assumption used in a recent work 19 . For example, the spread of a disease can result in elevated crisis awareness and thus facilitate the spread of the information about the disease 17 , but the spread of the information promotes more people to take preventive measures and consequently suppresses the epidemic spreading 26 . The third issue concerns the timing of the two types of spreading dynamics because they usually occur simultaneously on their respective layers and affect each other dynamically during the same time period 19 .",

The purpose of this paper is to develop an asymmetrically interacting spreading-dynamics model to integrate the three issues so as to gain deep understanding into the intricate interplay between the epidemic and information spreading dynamics. When all three issues are taken into account simultaneously, we find that an epidemic outbreak on the contact layer can induce an outbreak on the communication layer, and information spreading can effectively raise the epidemic threshold, making the contact layer more resistant to disease spreading. When inter-layer correlation exists, the information threshold remains unchanged but the epidemic threshold can be enhanced, making the contact layer more resilient to epidemic outbreak. These results are established through analytic theory with extensive numerical support.",

In such a network, an individual (a node) not only connects with his/her friends on a physical contact layer (subnetwork), but also communicates with them through the (electronic) communication layer. The structures of the two layers can in general be quite different. For example, an indoor-type of individual has few friends in the real world but may have many friends in the cyber space, leading to a much higher degree in the communication layer than in the physical-contact layer. Generally, the degree-to-degree correlation between the two layers cannot be assumed to be strong. Our correlated network model of communication-contact layers is constructed, as follows. Two subnetworks A and B with the same node set are first generated independently, where A and B denote the communication and contact layers, respectively. Each layer possesses a distinct internal structure, as characterized by measures such as the mean degree and degree distribution. Then each node of layer A is matched one-to-one with that of layer B according to certain rules.",

The dynamics component in our model can be described, as follows. In the communication layer (layer A), the classic susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) epidemiological model 43 is used to describe the dissemination of information about the disease. In the SIR model, each node can be in one of the three states: (1) susceptible state (S) in which the individual has not received any information about the disease, (2) informed state(I), where the individual is aware of disease and is capable of transmitting the information to other individuals in the same layer, and (3) refractory state (R), in which the individual has received the information but is not willing to pass it on to other nodes. At each time step, the information can propagate from every informed node to all its neighboring nodes. If a neighbor is in the susceptible state, it will be informed with probability b A . At the same time, each informed node can enter the recovering phase with probability m A . Once an informed node is recovered, it will remain in this state for all subsequent time. A node in layer A will get the information about the disease once its counterpart node in layer B is infected. As a result, dissemination of the information over layer A is facilitated by disease transmission on layer B.",

As shown in Fig. 2(a) , x exhibits a maximum value at b Ac , which is the threshold value of the information spreading process. The simulations are further implemented using 30 different two-layer network realizations to obtain the average value of b Ac . The identical simulation setting is used for all subsequent numerical results, unless otherwise specified. Figure 2 (b) shows the information threshold b Ac as a function of the disease-transmission rate b B . Note that the statistical errors are not visible here (same for similar figures in the paper), as they are typically vanishingly small. We see that the behavior of the information threshold can be classified into two classes, as predicted by Eq. Figure 3 shows the effect of the information-transmission rate b A and the vaccination rate p on the epidemic threshold b Bc . From Fig. 3(a) , we see that the value of b Bc is not influenced by b A for b A # b Au < 0.06, whereas b Bc increases with b A . For p 5 0.5, the analytical results from Eq. (11) are consistent with the simulated results. However, deviations occur for larger values of p, e.g., p 5 0.9, because the effect of information spreading is over-emphasized in cases where the two types of spreading dynamics are treated successively but not simultaneously. The gap between the theoretical and simulated thresholds diminishes as the network size is increased, validating applicability of the analysis method that, strictly speaking, holds only in the thermodynamic limit 20 (see details in Supporting Information). Note that a giant residual cluster does not exist in layer B for p 5 0.9 and b A $ 0.49, ruling out epidemic outbreak. The phase diagram indicating the possible existence of a giant residual cluster [Eq. (S20) in Supporting Information] is shown in the inset of Fig. 3(a) , where in phase II, there is no such cluster. In Fig. 3(b) , a large value of p causes b Bc to increase for b A . b Au . We observe that, similar to Fig. 3(a) , for relatively large values of p, say p $ 0.8, the analytical prediction deviates from the numerical results.

From Fig. 4(a) , we see that the final recovered density R A for information increases with b A and b B rapidly for b A # b Au and b B # b Bu . Figure 4 (b) reveals that the recovered density R B for disease decreases with b A . We see that a large value of b A can prevent the outbreak of epidemic for small values of b B , as R B R 0 for b B 5 0.2 and b A $ 0.5 (the red solid line). From Fig. 4(c) , we see that, with the increase in b A , more nodes in layer B are vaccinated. It is interesting to note that the vaccinated density V B exhibits a maximum value if b A is not large. Figure 4 shows that the maximum value of V B is about 0.32, which occurs at b B < 0.20, for b A 5 0.2. Combining with Fig. 3(a) , we find that the corresponding point of the maximum value b B < 0.20 is close to b Bc < 0.16 for p 5 0.5. This is because the transmission of disease has the opposite effects on the vaccinations. For b B # b Bc , the newly infected nodes in layer B will facilitate information spreading in layer A, resulting in more vaccinated nodes. For b B . b Bc , the epidemic spreading will make a large number of nodes infected, reducing the number of nodes that are potentially to be vaccinated. For relatively large values of b A , information tends to spread much faster than the disease for b B # b Bc , e.g., h < 0.21 for b A 5 0.5, p 5 0.5, b Bc < 0.22, and h < 0.12 for b A 5 0.9, p 5 0.5, and b Bc < 0.23.

For example, in social networks, positive interlayer correlation is more common than negative correlation 54, 55 . That is, an ''important'' individual with a large number of links in one network layer (e.g., representing one type of social relations) tends to have many links in other types of network layers that reflect different kinds of social relations. Recent works have shown that inter-layer correlation can have a large impact on the percolation properties of multiplex networks 37, 39 . Here, we investigate how the correlation between the communication and contact layers affects the information and disease spreading dynamics. To be concrete, we focus on the effects of positive correlation on the two types of spreading dynamics. It is necessary to construct a two-layer correlated network with adjustable degree of inter-layer correlation. This can be accomplished by first generating a two-layer network with the maximal positive correlation, where each layer has the same structure as uncorrelated networks. Then, Nq pairs of counterpart nodes, in which q is the rematching probability, are rematched randomly, leading to a two-layer network with weaker inter-layer correlation. The inter-layer correlation after rematching is given by (see Methods)",

For SF-ER networks with fixed correlation coefficient, the mean-field rate equations of the double-layer system cannot be written down because the concrete expressions of the conditional probabilities P(k B jk A ) and P(k A jk B ) are no longer available. We investigate how the rematching probability q affects the outbreak thresholds in both the communication and epidemic layers. As shown in Fig. 5 , we compare the case of q 5 0.8 with that of q 5 0.0. From Fig. 5(a) , we see that q has little impact on the outbreak threshold b Ac of the communication layer [with further support in Fig. 6(a) , and analytic explanation using ER-ER correlated layered networks in Supporting Information]. We also see that the value of b Ac for ER-ER layered networks with the same mean degree is greater because of the homogeneity in the degree distribution of layer A. Figures 5(b) and 6(b) show that b Bc decreases with q or, equivalently, b Bc increases with m s . This is because stronger inter-layer correlation can increase the probability for nodes with large degrees in layer B to be vaccinated, thus effectively preventing the outbreak of epidemic [see also Eqs. (S38)-(S41) in Supporting Information]. Figure 7 shows the final densities of different populations, providing the consistent result that, with the increase (decrease) of q (m s ), the final densities R A and R B increase but the density V B decreases. For SF-SF networks, we obtain similar results (shown in Supporting Information).",

A mean-field based analysis and extensive computations reveal an intricate interdependence of two basic quantities characterizing the spreading dynamics on both layers: the outbreak thresholds and the final fractions of infected nodes. In particular, on the communication layer, the outbreak of the information about the disease can be triggered not only by its own spreading dynamics but also by the the epidemic outbreak on the counter-layer. In addition, high disease and information-transmission rates can enhance markedly the final density of the informed or refractory population. On the layer of physical contact, the epidemic threshold can be increased but only if information itself spreads through the communication layer at a high rate. The information spreading can greatly reduce the final refractory density for the disease through vaccination. While a rapid spread of information will prompt more nodes in the contact layer to consider immunization, the authenticity of the information source must be verified before administrating large-scale vaccination.",
