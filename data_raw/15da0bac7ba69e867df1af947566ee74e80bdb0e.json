For the first time, a natural recombination strain of a TGEV Anhui Hefei (AHHF) virus between the Purdue and the Miller clusters was isolated from the small intestine content of piglets in China. A phylogenetic tree based on a complete genome sequence placed the TGEV AHHF strain between the Purdue and the Miller clusters. The results of a computational analysis of recombination showed that the TGEV AHHF strain is a natural recombinant strain between these clusters. Two breakpoints located in the open reading frame 1a (ORF1a) and spike (S) genes were identified. The pathogenicity of the TGEV AHHF strain was evaluated in piglets, and the results show that TGEV AHHF is an enteric pathogenic strain. These results provide valuable information about the recombination and evolution of CoVs and will facilitate future investigations of the molecular pathogenesis of TGEV.",

[10] [11] [12] [13] [14] The genome of TGEV contains a leader sequence at the 5\u2032 end and a poly (A) tail at the 3\u2032 end, and it encodes four structural proteins, including spike (S), envelope (E) and membrane (M) proteins and a nucleoprotein (N), and five non-structural proteins, including replicases 1a (pp1a) and 1ab (pp1ab) and proteins 3a, 3b and 7.",

Viral complementary DNA (cDNA) was generated via reverse transcription using PrimeScript reverse transcriptase (TaKaRa, Dalian, China) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Primers were designed as shown in Supplementary Table  S1 . The 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of the viral genome were amplified using the SMART RACE cDNA Amplification Kit (Clontech, Mountain View, CA, USA). Each PCR amplicon was obtained via one-step RT-PCR. All PCR reactions were performed as follows: pre-denaturation for 5 min at 94\u00b0C; 30 cycles of denaturation for 30 s at 95\u00b0C, annealing for 30 s at 55\u00b0C, and extension for 2.5 min at 72\u00b0C; followed by a final 10-min total extension step at 72\u00b0C.

Breakpoints for potential recombination zones were found at two locations, the ORF1a gene (nt 4144-9918 [aa 1286-3210 in pp1a]) ( Figure 4B ) and the S gene (nt 21 065-23 212 [aa 222-938 in the S protein]) ( Figure 4C ). The major parent strain of the recombination located in the ORF1a gene was SC-Y, and the minor parent strain was H16 ( Figure 4B ). SC-Y of TGEV (accession No. DQ443743) was isolated from Sichuan Qionglai in China. 20 H16 of TGEV (accession No. FJ755618) 19 was isolated from Shanghai in China. Both SC-Y and H16 viruses show a strong pathogenicity in piglets. The major parent strain of the recombination located at the S gene was virulent Purdue, and the minor parent strain was attenuated H ( Figure 4C ). These results indicate that TGEV AHHF was the result of a natural recombination event between the Miller cluster and the Purdue cluster. Figure S1A) . Furthermore, at nucleotide positions 9993-10 052 (downstream of the 4144-9918 breakpoint), we found that the RNA structure of TGEV AHHF was similar to that of SC-Y (Supplementary Figure S1B) . This finding verified that the reorganization located at the S gene of TGEV AHHF Figure S1D) . This result also verified that the reorganization located at the S gene of TGEV AHHF was from the virulent Purdue and attenuated H strains.",

            "text": "Recombination occurs among CoVs, 35, 36 such as in PEDV 37,38 and canine CoV. 39 Mixed infections under field conditions give rise to recombination events, and a new swine CoV generated by the recombination of TGEV and PEDV was recently identified. 40 Regarding CoVs, homologous RNA recombination is one of the major 'powers' of genetic evolution and diversity. 41, 42 Under field conditions, mixed infections are required to give rise to recombination events. 43 Some TGEV viruses belonging to the Miller group have been found in China (attenuated H and TS), 14, 44 and Purdue strains, such as TGEV HX and SHXB, are also prevalent in China, 12, 13 providing increased opportunities for reorganization. The ORF1a and S genes are two important recombination sites (breakpoints). The breakpoint located in ORF1a has previously been found, for example, in human coronavirus OC43. 45 Recombination breakpoints have also been identified in the S gene, for example, in human coronavirus NL63. 46 In this study, two breakpoints, which are located in the ORF1a and S genes, were found, and will provide valuable information on CoV recombination and evolution.",
