Methods: Preschool children presenting for care or admission to a tertiary paediatric hospital during the 2008-2014 influenza seasons were tested for respiratory virus by polymerase chain reaction and culture. Parental surveys were used to determine the impact of infection on illness duration, medication use, absenteeism and health service utilisation. Multivariate regression analyses were used to assess the impact of influenza and to evaluate the association between influenza status and outcomes. Results: Among 1191 children assessed, 238 had influenza. Among children with influenza, 87.8% were administered antipyretics and 40.9% antibiotics. 28.6% had secondary complications. 65.4% of children missed school/day care, and 53.4% of parents missed work.

            "text": "Influenza is a major cause of respiratory illness in young children, 1 with those <5 years at greatest risk of disease. The rate of influenzaassociated hospitalisations in this age group exceeds that seen in the elderly. 2 Assessing the impact of influenza infection in young children is challenging as it co-circulates with other respiratory viruses, from which it is clinically indistinguishable without laboratory testing. 3, 4 It is well recognised that estimates of influenza morbidity and mortality are likely to be underestimated. 5 The majority of influenza-related disease in children is seen in outpatient settings. 1, 6 Despite lower severity, it is speculated that non-hospitalised influenza represents a greater burden overall. 6, 7 Influenza in children is associated with the frequent use of antipyretics, antibiotics, 6, 8, 9 and parental and child absenteeism. 6,10-14 Health care visits due to influenza illness have been previously estimated to cost the Australian health care system AU$115 million annually (2008) . 15 Indirect costs from parental absenteeism are thought to be the largest contributor to the economic impact of influenza in young children. 10, 14, 16 The impact of influenza in children has been well described in the Northern Hemisphere, 6, 10, 14, 17 yet impact in Australia remains unknown. To date, data on the impact of influenza have been limited to hospitalised children, 18, 19 single influenza seasons 16, [18] [19] [20] or studies with small numbers of influenza-positive children. 16, 20 In Australia, influenza vaccine is not included on the National Immunisation Program (NIP), except for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children for whom it was funded in 2015. 21 Western Australia (WA) introduced a free influenza programme for children Commencing in 2008, the WA Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness (WAIVE) study was established to assess vaccine effectiveness in young children 22, [24] [25] [26] and to assess the impact of influenza on young children and their families. We describe the impact of laboratoryproven influenza on the child, their family and health care services, and compare the impact of influenza with other respiratory viruses presenting as influenza-like illness (ILI).",

Influenza detection varied significantly between years (P < 0.001). The lowest proportion of influenza positivity was seen in 2011 (13.2%) and highest in 2014 (30.9%; Figure 2). Influenza A/H1, of which the majority was pandemic influenza A/H1N1-09, was the most commonly detected (n = 117; 49.2% of influenza-positive samples), followed by A/H3 (n = 72; 30.3%) and influenza B (n = 49 children; 20.6%, Figure 2). Only one child had more than one subtype of influenza isolated from the same sample (A/H1N1-09 and A/H3).

Co-infection was common, with 240 children (20.2%) having two viruses detected and 54 (4.6%) having three or more viruses detected.

As the employment status of parents was unknown, it was not possible to determine the proportion of working parents who were absent, but in families with two working parents, the social impact is likely to be greater than in families with one or no working parents. The duration of absence estimate is somewhat higher than in the existing literature, withestimates by Tsolia et al and Principi et al 14,17 being 1.3 days and 1.2 days.

In addition, these data demonstrate that influenza has a greater impact than other respiratory viruses causing ILI in terms of the use of antipyretic and decongestant/ cough medicines, the diagnosis of croup, the duration of the illness, the duration of absence from school/day care for the child and the duration of absence from work for the parent.Demonstrated preventative strategies, such as universal influenza immunisation in young children, are therefore likely to have a significant impact and should be examined as a priority for inclusion on the Australian immunisation schedule.
