In this paper we describe the first real-time syndromic surveillance system that conducts integrated spatio-temporal analysis of data from a national network of veterinary premises for the early detection of disease outbreaks in small animals. We illustrate the system's performance using data relating to gastrointestinal disease in dogs and cats. the data consist of approximately one million electronic health records for dogs and cats, collected from 458 UK veterinary premises between March 2014 and 2016. For this illustration, the system predicts the relative reporting rate of gastrointestinal disease amongst all presentations, and updates its predictions as new data accrue. The system was able to detect simulated outbreaks of varying spatial geometry, extent and severity. The system is flexible: it generates outcomes that are easily interpretable; the user can set their own outbreak detection thresholds. the system provides the foundation for prompt detection and control of health threats in companion animals.",

During the past decade, the emergence of new diseases 1 and the increasing threat of bio-terrorism have motivated the development of syndromic surveillance systems in public health focused on the early detection of health threats that require effective public health action 2,3 . Syndromic surveillance uses health-related data that precedes diagnosis. Although data of this kind are less specific than data from confirmed diagnoses they are typically more timely, which is an important consideration for real-time or near-real-time analysis and interpretation 4 . In veterinary medicine the development of systems for early health-event detection has followed a similar path to that previously taken in public health 5 . A recent inventory of current and planned European veterinary syndromic surveillance systems showed wide interest in European countries for syndromic surveillance, but also highlighted the novelty of this field 6 .",

This has produced a deficit in our understanding of the dynamics and burden of the full range of endemic/ emerging diseases in companion animals and leaves these populations susceptible to the emergence of health threats. Lack of disease surveillance also has implications for human health, as approximately 75 percent of new and emerging diseases are zoonotic 7 . However, as health records become digitised in veterinary practices they become more available for research 8 , providing an opportunity to improve companion animal syndromic surveillance in clinical settings and the possibility of linking this with human syndromic surveillance. Recently, electronic syndromic surveillance data on companion animals has become available in real-time on a national scale www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ without adjustment, on the grounds that multiple visits occurring within a short time period (e.g. within a few days) would likely indicate a more serious illness episode.",

Gastrointestinal disease accounted for 4.0% of all presentations, amongst which 91.5% were recorded between Monday and Friday. Amongst animals presenting for GI disease, there was not a notable gender bias; 48.5% of dog consultations and 50.6% of cat consultations with a recorded sex were female. Where the breed-status was identified, 84.9% of dog GI disease consultations and 17.2% of cat GI disease consultations were purebreds. In animals with a date of birth recorded within the range 0 to 25 years, 65.4% of dog GI disease consultations and 47.4% of cat GI disease consultations were under eight years. The age profile of dogs and cats presenting for GI disease at SAVSNET veterinary premises stratified by sex and breed-status is shown in Table 1 . Data for the two species were analysed separately.",

These samples are then used to compute predictive probabilities at given thresholds; a high predictive probability at a particular location and time gives an early warning of a possible disease outbreak. The system provides end-users (i.e. practising veterinary surgeons) decision-support tools for immediate analysis and easy interpretation of their data. As an example, we apply our model to small companion animal EHRs collected over two years by SAVSNET from a large network of UK veterinary premises.

This seems to have had little impact on GI disease, which remains one of the commonest reasons for presenting for veterinary care in the UK 9,10,12-15 , although precise data to confirm this has been lacking.

Data were collected electronically in near-real-time from volunteer veterinary premises or sites using a compatible version of the practice management system (PMS) namely RoboVet (VetSolutions, Edinburgh) and Teleos Systems Ltd (Birmingham). This study used data for dogs and cats collected over the period between 1 st March 2014 and 29 th February 2016. In our analysis we included data from an increasing number of premises as they enrolled in the RoboVet and Teleos systems. By 29 th February 2016 we had data from 216 practices (amounting to a total of 458 distinct premises) located in England, Wales and Scotland. The data were extracted from consultations where a booked appointment was made to see a veterinary surgeon or nurse, including out-of-hours consultations. Through the SAVSNET system a compulsory, single-question questionnaire is appended at the end of each consultation allowing the attending veterinary surgeon or nurse to categorise the main reason for the animal's presentation into syndromes (currently GI disease, respiratory disease, pruritus and renal disease) or other routine veterinary interventions (i.e., trauma, neoplasia, 'other sick' , vaccination, 'other healthy' or post-operative check-up). Specifically, the definition provided to participating veterinary surgeons to categorise the animal presentation as GI disease is that the main reason for the animal's presentation are signs including but not limited to diarrhoea, vomiting, weight loss and poor appetite. A full description of the SAVSNET data collection protocol has been described by S\u00e1nchez-Vizca\u00edno et al. 9 .

The text-based data for each owner's full postcode were automatically cleaned by applying mapping rules of typical misspellings (e.g. letter 'O' instead of zero). Any remaining records containing erroneous postcodes were discarded from our outbreak prediction as they could not be geocoded. Similarly, if the age of the animal was recorded outside the range 0 to 25 years then the record was excluded. SAVSNET records with missing data were removed before the analysis. If an animal attended a veterinary premise on more than one occasion during the study period we included all attendances outbreak Detection Modelling Rationale. As noted earlier, we define an outbreak as an unexplained spatially and temporally localised increase in the fraction of GI consultations amongst all consultations. The term \"unexplained\" refers to the fact that, for reasons that are well understood, some areas or times of year will experience higher fractions of GI consultations than others because of spatial variation in the local population susceptibility or temporal variation in the region-wide susceptibility to GI. We adjust for these known effects using measured explanatory variables, as described below in the section on explanatory variable selection. We then equate \"unexplained\" to \"stochastic\" and include this in our model as a latent, spatially and temporally correlated process S i,t , where i denotes premise and t denotes time, in days. By definition, the expected value of each S i,t is zero, and our goal is to determine where and when its actual value is materially greater than zero. Note that the natural pattern of GI consultations will always be subject to fluctuations in time and space that cannot be explained fully by measured variables. It follows that outbreak detection is not a statistical hypothesis-testing problem. Our approach acknowledges this by the fact that the actual value of S i,t will never be exactly zero. Our formal solution is therefore to calculate, for each premise i and day t, the predictive probability q (i.e. the probability conditional on all available data up to and including day t) that S i,t > l, where l is a user-specified threshold representing an effect large enough to be of practical concern. We then declare an outbreak affecting premise i if this probability exceeds q 0 , the required positive predictive value per premise, say q 0 = 0.95 or 0.99. As with any prediction problem using observational data, it is not possible simultaneously to control both the positive and negative predictive probabilities. prediction model. To accommodate the spatial and temporal correlations that would characterise an outbreak of GI disease, we use a spatio-temporal mixed effects regression model, and fit the model using Bayesian inference. We define our binary response variable Y j,it to take the value 1 if the j th consultation at the i th premise on day t is a GI disease presentation and 0 otherwise. Conditionally on an unobserved, spatio-temporally structured random effect S i,t , the Y j,i,t are distributed as mutually independent Bernoulli variables with probabilities p j,i,t defined by ",

In each time timeseries the solid black line is the predicted value of S i,t , shaded areas are pointwise 50%, 90% and 95% predictive intervals. As an aid to rapid interpretation, we use a traffic-light system: if the predictive probability, q, is above 0.99 (defined as 'very high') the light shows red, if above 0.9 ('high') orange, if above 0.8 (medium) yellow, otherwise ('low') green (no outbreak).

We use each scenario to generate a simulated set of consultations for February 2016, to which we fit our model using Eq. (1). To assess the capability of our model to detect outbreaks we then use the predictive distribution S i,t from which we compute summary statistics, including exceedence probabilities and times to detection. We set the positive predictive value of the system at q 0 = 0.9. We set values of the reporting threshold at l = 0, 0.3 and 0.6. Note that l = 0 corresponds to an observed pattern exactly equal to expectation and is analogous to, although formally different from, using statistical rather than clinical significance in hypothesis testing. We do not recommend using l = 0 in practice, but use it here only as a benchmark to compare the system's performance under different scenarios. In a genuine application, the threshold value l would be chosen to represent a clinically significant increase in reporting rate, and the positive predictive value q 0 to balance sensitivity against specificity. Note, in this context, that because S i,t is measured on the probit scale, the increase in the fraction of GI cases corresponding to a fixed increase in S i,t necessarily depends on the baseline fraction.

Recall that under Scheme 1 the outbreak affects only the central premise of each set. Also, the prediction algorithm exploits the estimated spatial correlation amongst the fractions of GI cases at different premises. As a consequence, the system is better able to detect an outbreak at a single premise when this premise does not have close 'outbreak-free' neighbours whose fractions of GI cases are as expected. In effect, the model smooths its predictions over a range corresponding to its estimated correlation range; Fig. 3 shows an example of this phenomenon. This explains why, under Scheme 1 (Fig. 1) , the system delivers a stronger detection signal for the sparse than for the dense set. Under Scheme 2 (Fig. 2) , the results for the sparse and dense sets are more similar. Also, because the outbreak affects more premises in the medium, and dense sets, their results show generally stronger detection signals than in Scheme 1, as indicated by the increased number of traffic-lights tending towards red in Fig. 2 compared with Fig. 1 .",

The last decade has seen a growth in the field of disease surveillance in companion animals, notably in the UK 9,26 and in the USA 27, 29 . However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first surveillance system that conducts integrated spatio-temporal analysis of data from a national network of veterinary practices so as to enable real-time detection of spatially and temporally localised changes in reporting rate patterns across the network. We have illustrated the applicability of our proposed surveillance system using gastrointestinal disease syndrome in dogs and cats as an example. The system is fed with electronic health records (EHRs) collected in real-time through SAVSNET from volunteer veterinary premises across the UK. We applied our system to 15 simulated GI disease outbreaks of varying spatial extent and severity, amongst which the system was able to detect 14 of the 15. Had these been real outbreaks, the proposed surveillance system would have triggered timely investigations, which ultimately would have aided control strategies. The system requires the user to specify a reporting threshold corresponding to an increase in case incidence (reporting rate) that would be considered large enough to be of practical importance. Given this reporting threshold, the system delivers the predictive probability, q, at each location (here, veterinary premise), that the threshold is currently exceeded. Declaring an outbreak when this probability is greater than a specified value q 0 is equivalent to fixing the positive predictive value of the system (per location, per day) at q 0 . Alternatively, reporting the actual value of q gives an indication of the strength of evidence for an outbreak. Increasing the value of the reporting threshold, l, necessarily reduces the value of q and consequently increases the average time to detection of an outbreak at a fixed value of q 0.",

            "text": "A critical component of a syndromic surveillance system is the application of optimal disease aberration detection methods. Most of the methods used in veterinary and public health surveillance systems are concerned with detecting disease-outbreaks and health-related threats in time rather than in space [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] . However, disease incidences vary naturally in both space and time. Thus, for example, these techniques may be late at detecting outbreaks that start locally when the surveillance region is large 39 . In contrast, our proposed method has the advantage of being able to directly incorporate data for each individual animal's consultation, including the date of the visit and the location of the pet's owner. In temporal aberration detection algorithms, explanatory variables such as seasonality and day-of-the-week effects would generally be incorporated, but most of these methods cannot easily include individual-level explanatory variables. www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Earlier spatio-temporal aberration detection methods have been introduced by Rogerson 40, 41 . However, these approaches lack measures of uncertainty associated with the identified clusters and are unable to account for covariate information. Also, they are based on an assessment of global pattern change throughout the Fig. 1 . and 2. The top and bottom rows relate to the density of the region, 'sparse' and 'dense' , respectively, and the left and right columns relate to simulation Schemes 1 and 2 respectively. The simulated probability of a case at the premise in the centre of each region is p 0 15 = . . To aid interpretation, we use the traffic-light system described in Fig. 1 caption, as such each coloured circle on the map is derived from the predicted distribution of S i,t at each corresponding premise. Panels (a,c) show when the central premise has neighbours who are not experiencing an outbreak it is less able to detect the outbreak, panel (c), when compared to a premise without neighbours, panel (a). If the neighbours also experience an outbreak the system is then better able to detect this outbreak at central premise, panel (d), compared with when the neighbours did not experience an outbreak, panel (c).",

The space-time permutation scan statistic uses only case numbers, with no need for population-at-risk data 39 and, in contrast to Rogerson's methods, does operate locally in both space and time. This method may therefore be suitable for setting up surveillance systems in the small animal sector where only case numbers are available. However, it does not acknowledge the uncertainty associated with any identified clusters, cannot easily incorporate continuous covariates, and can only detect outbreaks characterised by excess cases within a specified, regular shaped affected area, for example a circle or ellipse. Also, in our context the number of veterinary premises participating in SAVSNET can change over time due to the ongoing process of recruiting new premises and/or as a result of premises that could potentially stop being part of the project. This can lead to biased results if a space-time permutation model is used, as the method cannot distinguish an increase in cases due to a local population increase versus an increase in disease risk.",

Our surveillance system builds upon a similar epidemiological metric by modelling the spatio-temporal reporting rate of GI disease in dogs and cats as a proportion of all presentations. The two approaches use different inferential methods: the US study uses confidence intervals for recognising aberrant health events, whilst our approach uses predictive probabilities of exceeding policy-relevant thresholds. A more important difference is that we use a bespoke model that incorporates spatio-temporal covariance structure, with the aim of detecting outbreaks that are spatially and temporally localised without imposing any artificial assumptions on the geometrical shape of an outbreak or the extent of spatial correlation in disease incidence.",

However, the results derived from Shaffer et al. 28 demonstrated the stability and timely availability of test order data for companion animals and the potential of using these data as a basis for outbreak detection. In addition to EHRs from veterinary practices, SAVSNET also receives routine downloads of diagnostic test results from commercial diagnostic laboratories throughout the UK 9 .

Other methods must therefore be employed to approximate, for instance, an incidence rate ratio. Evidence suggests that in countries with developed pet industries, a high proportion of owned pet animals (pets who may approximate the target population) attend a veterinary surgeon 51, 52 . Therefore, although no single data source can detect all outbreaks that may occur in companion animal populations, EHRs of the kind that are extensively collected from veterinary practices (2019) 9:17738 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-53352-6 www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ in many developed countries may be the best available source to include in surveillance activities for increasing our capabilities to detect those outbreaks that result from both endemic and potential emerging pathogens.",

Hence, the data used in our system might not be representative of the source population (in our study defined as the overall veterinary-visiting population across the UK). For this reason, we aimed to develop a syndromic surveillance system to detect changes in the relative, rather than absolute, incidence of GI disease presentations in the small animal veterinary premises participating in SAVSNET. Nevertheless, the practices included in the current study were widely distributed around the UK and represented 8.5% of those practices that constituted the source population in 2009 51 . Thus, the number and geographical extent of SAVSNET-participating practices is such that changes in the relative risk of GI disease in this large network of premises can act as a proxy for changes in the level of GI disease in the wider source population.",

If the goal is to detect anomalous patterns of absolute incidence rather than relative risk, then provided that data are available to calculate any changes in the population base of each premise our approach can be modified accordingly, for example by using a Poisson log-linear version of our spatio-temporal mixed model rather than the current binomial probit-linear version.",
