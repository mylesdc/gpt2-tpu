            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is an economically devastating enteric disease in the swine industry. The virus infects pigs of all ages, but it cause severe clinical disease in neonatal suckling pigs with up to 100% mortality. Currently, available vaccines are not completely effective and feedback methods utilizing PEDV infected material has variable success in preventing reinfection. Comprehensive information on the levels and duration of effector/memory IgA and IgG antibody secreting B cell response in the intestines and lymphoid organs of PEDV-infected sows, and their association with specific antibody levels in clinical samples such as plasma, oral fluid, and feces is important. Therefore, our goal in this study was to quantify PEDV specific IgA and IgG B cell responses in sows at approximately 1 and 6 months post-infection in commercial swine herds, including parity one and higher sows. Our data indicated that evaluation of both PEDV specific IgA and IgG antibody levels in the plasma and oral fluid (but not feces) samples is beneficial in disease diagnosis. PEDV specific B cell response in the intestine and spleen of infected sows decline by 6 months, and this associates with specific antibody levels in the plasma and oral fluid samples; but the virus neutralization titers in plasma remains high beyond 6 months post-infection. In conclusion, in sows infected with PEDV the presence of effector/memory B cell response and strong virus neutralization titers in plasma up to 6 months postinfection, suggests their potential to protect sows from reinfection and provide maternal immunity to neonates, but challenge studies are required to confirm such responses. \u00a9 2015 Ouyang et al.

Other clinical signs of PED include vomiting and anorexia. PED is characterized by the mortality rate of 30-100% in neonates, and high morbidity but low mortality in weaned pigs [2] . Economic losses due to elevated mortality and decreased production by PEDV are significant in the US swine herds. PED virus (PEDV) is the causative agent of PED. PEDV was detected on multiple US swine farms in April of 2013 [1, 3] , and the virus has continued to spread through swine producing states at an alarming rate until the end of 2014. Over 45 779 PEDV tests have been conducted in the US between May 2013 and March 2014, and reported 4757 cases (~10%) positive in 27 states [4] .",

Moreover, information about levels and duration of PEDV herd immune status in sows is important to implicate appropriate control measures at verge of disease outbreaks. Therefore, it is critical to develop standardized isotype antibody targeted assays to determine the association of clinical samples data with PEDV specific B cell response at the intestines and lymphoid tissues of sows recovered from PED under field conditions. In this study we quantified both PEDV specific IgA and IgG antibody levels in the clinical samples (plasma, oral fluid, and feces) and associated that to the isotype specific B cell responses in the intestine and lymphoid tissues of PED infected sows in commercial breeding herds of two different parities (primiparous and multiparous).",

Population of PEDV specific IgA and IgG secreting cells (ASCs) present in every 0.5 million MNCs of ileum, MLN and spleen were enumerated by ELISPOT assay (Figure 6 ). To perform this assay, we used both PEDV whole virus-derived antigen containing fixed Vero cells plate and semi-purified PEDV antigen immunocaptured plate. Both the methods detected similar trend in the frequencies of both IgA and IgG ASCs in PEDV infected sow groups, but in fixed Vero cell antigen coated plates, a fivefold to tenfold higher numbers of ASCs were detected compared to the other, therefore fixed cell antigen plate data is shown here ( Figure 6 ). As expected we did not detect PEDV specific IgA and IgG ASCs in both uninfected primiparous and multiparous sows ( Figure 6 ). Overall, the population of PEDV specific IgA ASCs was greater than IgG ASCs in all three tissue derived MNCs ( Figure 6 ). In post 1 month PEDV-infected multiparous sows ileum MNCs, cultured for 6 days without any further antigenic stimulation, the number of virus-specific IgA ASCs (~200) were significantly greater compared to control uninfected and 6 months post PEDV-infected (10 ASCs) sows ( Figure 6A ); and a similar trend was present in stimulated ileum MNCs ( Figure 6B ). In contrast, the number of virus-specific IgG ASCs were too low (<5) in the ileum MNCs ( Figures 6G and H) . In MLN MNCs, the number of PEDV-specific IgA ASCs in multiparous sows at 1 and 6 months post PEDV-infection were significantly higher compared to uninfected control sows ( Figures 6C  and D) . In unstimulated MNCs of spleen, frequency of PEDV-specific IgA ASCs (~400) in all four PEDVinfected sow groups were significantly higher than that from uninfected control sows ( Figure 6E ); and only in PEDV-infected multiparous sows, a significant increase in IgA ASCs in viral antigen-stimulated MNCs was observed compared to uninfected animals ( Figure 6F ). However, significantly greater numbers of PEDV-specific IgG ASCs (~300) were present only in the PEDV whole virus-derived antigen stimulated MNCs from multiparous sows at 1 month post PEDV-infection in comparison to that of uninfected control sows ( Figure 6L) .

In an earlier study, PEDV whole virus antigen based ELISA was developed using the virus grown in Vero cells, and the viral antigen used in the assay was extracted using 0.2% Triton X-100 to analyze antibodies in 1024 field samples at the herd level [19] . Though we followed a similar method of growing the virus, but the ELISA antigen was extracted from freeze-thawed viral culture fluid subjected to 20% sucrose cushion ultracentrifugation, probably the cell debris still present in our antigen preparation would have contributed to the observed high background activity in IgG ELISA in plasma, which needs further investigation. PEDV S protein is a class I viral fusion protein [20] , and is cleaved by host-derived proteases when virus enters the susceptible cell [21] . The S protein contains B cell epitopes for induction of neutralizing antibodies [22] . The S protein-based ELISA was found to be sensitive to evaluate antibody response against PEDV in plasma and colostrum samples [23] [24] [25] [26] . In our study, in addition to whole virus antigen, both recombinant PEDV S and M protein based IgA and IgG ELISA was used to estimate the levels of antibody in plasma, oral fluid, and fecal samples of sows; and detected high levels of specific IgA response in infected sows' plasma followed by in oral fluid, but not in fecal samples. This suggests that PEDV specific antibodies in the fecal samples of infected sows disappear early (approximately 1-2 months) post-infection; in spite of the presence PEDV specific IgA and IgG ASCs in intestines and lymphoid organs at 6 months post-infection. We also noticed that PEDV specific IgA response in plasma (but not in oral fluid) remained high until 6 months. Furthermore, though we found comparable reactivity of PEDV whole virus derived antigen and S protein for detection of specific IgA antibodies, the antibody levels were twofold less in the S protein based ELISA (ODs at 1:200 dilution). Overall, our data suggested that for diagnosis purpose it is ideal to use both whole virus and S protein based IgA and IgG ELISA in herd oral fluid as well as in statistically acceptable number of plasma samples.

But the VN titers in plasma remained high in all the PEDV-infected sows, suggesting that infected sows could be resistant to reinfection beyond 6 months. However, the level of protection varies depending on extent of viral antigenic diversity, health status of sows, and secondary microbial infections. Due to lack of virus isolation from PEDV-infected sows, the genetic variability between the virus that infected sows and the virus used for ex vivo stimulation could not be analyzed, and thus we could not determine the levels of cross-protection to PEDV in sows.",

However, our study in sows suggested that systemic response in spleen is predominant over the response in intestines; the differences might be due to time frame of sampling and the age of the animals. Immunologically, the possible reason could be the migration of activated PEDV antigen-bearing dendritic cells to spleen, resulting in activation of na\u00efve B and T cells. Alternatively, the memory lymphocytes from the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues could migrate to spleen and bone marrow [33] . In summary, PEDV specific IgA and IgG B cells in infected sows were detectable at higher levels in ileum and spleen compared to that in MLN using both ELISPOT (total B cell response) and flow cytometry (detection of frequency of specific IgA and IgG B cell response) assays, with the later assay demonstrating a more robust result compared to the former in detecting antigen and isotype specific B cells. However, detection of antibody isotype specific B cell response with a memory phenotype marker in mucosal tissues will be highly beneficial to determine PEDV vaccine or infection induced memory in pigs.",
