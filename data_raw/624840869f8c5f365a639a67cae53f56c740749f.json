This concern has prompted the use of mathematical models to evaluate strategies to control disease spread, making these models invaluable tools to identify optimal intervention strategies. A particularly important quantity in infectious disease epidemiology is the basic reproduction number, R 0. Estimation of this quantity is crucial for effective control responses in the early phase of an epidemic. In our previous study, an approach for estimating the basic reproduction number in real time was developed. This approach uses case notification data and the structure of potential transmission contacts to accurately estimate R 0 from the limited amount of information available at the early stage of an outbreak. Based on this approach, we extend the existing methodology; the most recent method features intra-and inter-age groups contact heterogeneity. Given the number of newly reported cases at the early stage of the outbreak, with parsimony assumptions on removal distribution and infectivity profile of the diseases, experiments to estimate real time R 0 under different levels of intra-and inter-group contact heterogeneity using two age groups are presented. We show that the new method converges more quickly to the actual value of R 0 than the previous one, in particular when there is high-level intra-group and inter-group contact heterogeneity. With the age specific contact patterns, number of newly reported cases, removal distribution, and information about the PLOS ONE | natural history of the 2009 pandemic influenza in Hong Kong, we also use the extended model to estimate R 0 and age-specific R 0 .",

In the early phases of the epidemic, with limited information on the number of infections, policy makers tried to mitigate disease spread as best they could. Mathematical modeling of infectious disease has made increasing contributions to public health decisions [2] [3] [4] with the aim of estimating the basic reproduction number, R 0 [5] . R 0 is defined as the number of secondary cases generated by one infectious individual during his/her entire infection period in a totally susceptible population [6] . When R 0 is greater than one, there is a likelihood that the infection will to continue to spread; however if R 0 is less than one, then the infection will eventually die out. For this reason, estimating the basic reproduction number is paramount for assessing the effectiveness of different intervention strategies.",

In other words, each individual has an equal chance of infecting others in a population. However, the estimates of R 0 from models with this parsimonious assumption may differ greatly from models featuring heterogeneous contacts patterns, resulting in different epidemiological outcomes under the same intervention policies [7] . Studies have suggested that many infectious diseases exhibit heterogeneity in transmission efficiency in certain individuals (for example \"super-spreaders\" in SARS (2003)), or in specific groups of individuals that appear to account for most of the transmission (such as school age children in H1N1 influenza A (2009)) [8] [9] . To ensure that this heterogeneity is modeled, contact network models are used to explicitly capture patterns of disease transmission. Contact network models can also be used to compare the intervention strategies for different infectious diseases when epidemiological data are limited, as was the case with SARS in 2003 and H1N1 pandemic influenza virus in 2009 [5] [7] .",

            "text": "Contact network models characterize the contacts between individuals in a social setting that can potentially result in disease transmission. The contact patterns can vary between individuals in the population. We assume that there are N individuals in the population. Each individual is represented as a vertex, and an edge represents a pathway of possible infection transmission between two individuals. The number of contacts that an individual has is denoted by k., Also, the probability that a randomly chosen vertex has k contacts (k degrees) is denoted p k . Useful information can be derived from the distribution of number of contacts, known as the degree distribution. For instance, the first moment of degree distribution is the average number of nearest neighbours to a randomly selected individual z 1 , and the second moment is related to z 2 , the number of second-degree neighbours (i.e., neighbours of neighbours) of a randomly chosen individual. The excess degree z is defined as the number of edges emanating from an infected individual, excluding the edge that was the source of the focal infection; it is simply the ratio z 2 z 1 [10] . A continuous time approach to estimate ongoing basic reproduction number with threestate (susceptible, infected and removed) framework was previously described in [11] . Age structure was not explicitly included in this framework. The excess degree z 2 z 1 was assumed to be the same to every individual. We defined \u03bb as the transmission rate of an infected individual to a susceptible individual if the individual was not infected previously. Thus, T(t) = 1 \u2212 e \u2212\u03bbt is the probability that an individual transmits the disease to one of its neighbours by time t (since acquiring the infection). In the same manner, \u03bb r was defined as the removal rate of an infected individual given that the individual was not removed from the infectious state, previously.",

An overall degree distribution, a known R 0 or \u03bb r and the natural history of influenza are inputs of the network. We assume that the contact patterns of individuals would be similar to those seen in a typical day in the early phase of the epidemic. To evaluate which model can rapidly provide a better estimate of R 0 in the early phase of an epidemic of influenza, the same overall degree distribution which is the same as simulated data and the number of daily reported cases are inputs of both model A (without age structure) [5] and the proposed model B (with age structure). Ongoing estimate of R 0 from each model will be provided. We also apply model B to the real data as an illustrative example with 2 age groups: school aged children (<20 years old) as age group 1 and adults (20 years old or above) as age group 2 to estimate R 0 for the 2009 outbreak of H1N1pdm in Hong Kong [S1 Data]. From the start of May in 2009, patients who were admitted to public hospitals with acute respiratory illness were tested by (RT)-PCR. Information from each individual tested was entered into an information system (E-flu) managed by the Hong Kong Hospital Authority-a statutory body responsible for managing Hong Kong's public hospitals and their services to the community. The E-flu database generates incidence data on children and adults by the date of symptoms onset. This database was gathered as a part of a public health response and therefore not subject to any ethics approval.

For ease of illustration, only two age groups in the community are considered (adults and children), although the above equations could easily be generalized to situations where information about more refined age groups is available. With six different known values of R 0 and similar value for \u03bb r , we used computer simulations to generate incidence data for these two age groups under three levels of inter-group and within group heterogeneity in contact patterns.

To characterize this feature, we hypothesized 2 scenarios for 2 given values of R 0 as seen in Fig 1A-1C and Fig 1D-1F. Across Fig 1A-1C , we keep the degree distribution of individuals in the first age group unchanged (red bar chart in the sub-diagram) and shift the degree distribution of individuals in the second age group (blue bar chart in the sub-diagram) to the right, thereby increasing the inter-group heterogeneity of contacts. Model B shows a quick convergence to the true value of R 0 , while model A cannot accurately estimate R 0 , especially when inter-group heterogeneity in the contact network is high. This suggests that model B provides a better real-time estimate over model A whenever there is any level of inter-group contact heterogeneity.",

We run the simulations on each age group using three datasets where the contacts are uniformly distributed with a width of 3, 5, and 7 degrees respectively (Fig 1D-1F) . For incidence data with 3 degrees on each group, model B provides more accurate estimates of R 0 between day 30 and day 45 than model A (as in Fig 1D) . Under these conditions, about 50 to 100 cases are required for model B to converge on the true value of R 0 . For incidence data with 5 degrees and 7 degrees on each group, model B also gives an accurate estimate of R 0 as represented in Fig 1E and Fig 1F. In Fig 1F, the distance between degree distributions of the two age groups is shortened compared with Fig 1D. In other words, the inter-group contact heterogeneity in the two age groups decreases across Fig 1D-1F . This explains why the differences between the two estimates from both model A and model B are not significant in Fig 1F.

This shows that there is higher variation in the number of contacts in children than in adults. Fig 3 reveals that while the daily incidence of laboratory-confirmed cases of pH1N1 among adults in Hong Kong increased monotonically from April until the main peak in September 2009, the incidence in children presented an anomaly. The incidence data for children has a minor peak at the early stage of the epidemic between June and July. In real time, at the time when the minor peak formed, and without prior knowledge of how the epidemic would unfold afterwards, this anomaly might have been interpreted as a stand-alone peak, with an inclining segment between June 1 and 21 and a declining segment between June 21 and July 1 as shown in the inset figure in Fig 3. Interestingly, using the inclining segment with model B, the estimate of R 0 converges very quickly to 1.2 in early June (black line in Fig 3) . Since the declining segment destabilizes the early-stage R 0 estimator, the estimate after the minor peak fluctuates for a while until the epidemic curve begins to increase monotonically in July, when the estimator converges again to 1.12 between day 82 and day 102. The estimate of R 0 under model A converges to 1.21 in late August (Day 115), which is slightly higher than the estimate from model B. Estimates under both model A and B are similar to the estimate of the effective reproduction number between 1.1 and 1.2 that was proposed in summer of 2009 by [18] . The number of cases required for model B to converge to estimate R 0 of 1.2 and 1.12 up to Day 30 and 82 are 66 and~2200, respectively, which are about 5 to 10% of the total number of laboratory confirmed cases in the whole epidemic. Using the excess degree of children and adults, the age specific R 0 can be estimated for both children and adults. We showed that R 0 for children is higher than that for adults (1.28 versus 1.08), which is consistent with other studies (see [19] ). This implies that school-aged children likely contributed more infections than adults.",

By explicitly taking in account the age structure of a population, this study improves on a network-based formalism that was introduced previously for a non-age-stratified population in [11] . Our proposed age-structured model (model B) provides a reliable estimate of R 0 in the early stage of an epidemic, even in the presence of noise or dominant stochastic fluctuations and potentially biased numbers of newly reported cases during the early stochastic regime. Using the simulated data, our analytical justification shows that network structures featuring inter-age group contact heterogeneity helps us provide an ongoing estimate of R 0 before the epidemic reaches the exponential growth as in Fig 1. Even for the real data, our proposed model B can still provide estimates of R 0 in the early stage of epidemics as of Day 30. Although the first peak deviates from the estimate of R 0 , it quickly converges again on the final estimate two and half months before the second peak in mid-September. The ongoing estimate of R 0 provides important information for policy makers to take immediate action to control further disease spread.",

Thus, conducting a large-scale population-based survey on contact behaviour is suggested in every city. For densely populated cities like Hong Kong, contacts of individuals within and between different age groups may vary significantly. For this reason, a large scale population-based telephone survey in Hong Kong has recently been conducted to collect the contact histories of individuals at four different time points in a year, to examine the temporal changes of contacts, and generate unbiased estimates of contact between and among age groups [20] .While model A provides a reasonable estimate for R 0 in the general population as a whole, model B-which takes age structure into account-portrays a more refined picture of patterns of disease spread across different age groups, thus providing an age-specific estimate of R 0 . To better prepare for reemerging and emerging infectious diseases, the use of model B and further studies on the temporal change of contacts' behaviour in major metropolitan areas may help refine these estimates even further, and provide more accurate insight into future outbreaks of infectious diseases in the early phase.",

For example, we have not included the possibility of late reporting or underreporting of numbers of new cases in the early phases of an epidemic. The assumption that the number of reported cases accurately reflects the actual number of cases may not hold true in real situations since first, not all infected persons will seek medical attention; and second, there are strong biases for certain age groups (such as children) to seek medical attention even in a precautionary capacity. To our knowledge, this model is the first network-based modeling framework that includes heterogeneity in the estimation of R 0 . In this framework the confidence interval of R 0, is not constructed because the stochastic variables such as I r (t), R r (t), T r (t) used from Eqs (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) involves inherent uncertainties in arriving the estimator of R 0 in addition to the above extrinsic factors.",
