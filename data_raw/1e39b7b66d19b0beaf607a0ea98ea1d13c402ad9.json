The viral replicase proteins are the major components of the RTCs but the physical associations among these non-structural proteins (nsps) remain elusive. In this study, we investigated the potential interactions between PRRSV nsps by yeast two-hybrid (Y2H), bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) and pull-down assays. Our analyses revealed a complex network of interactions involving most of PRRSV nsps. Among them, nsp9 and nsp12 were identified as the hubs of the nsp interactome; transmembrane proteins nsp2 and nsp5 both interacted with nsp3, indicating that the three membrane-bound proteins might bind together to form the scaffold to support the association of RTCs with the intracellular membrane. The PRRSV nsp interactions identified in this study may provide valuable clues for future researches on the RTC formation and function.",

It is an enveloped virus encapsulating a positive-stranded RNA genome of about 15 kb. The genome contains at least 11 open reading frames Kappes and Faaberg, 2015; Li et al., 2015) . ORF1a and ORF1b at the 5 -proximal three quarters of the genome encode long polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab which are subsequently cleaved by viral proteases to generate functional non-structural proteins (nsps), and the rest 3 -proximal part of the genome consists of ORFs encoding viral structural proteins. A short alternative ORF that overlaps ORF1a in the +1/-2 frame was recently identified, and the ORF could be expressed to yield a transframe protein nsp2TF and a truncated nsp2 variant nsp2N by programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) mechanism .",

Hydrophobic nsp2, nsp3, and nsp5 containing predicted membrane-spanning domains are thought to be involved in membrane modification and formation of double membrane vesicles (DMVs), a typical structure induced by arterivirus infection. Nsp6 and nsp8 are short peptides containing only 16 and 45 amino acid residues, respectively, and their functions in virus infection remain unknown. With an internal cleavage site, nsp7 can be further cleaved into nsp7\u03b1 and nsp7\u03b2, however, only cleaved nsp7\u03b1 was detectable in PRRSV infected cells by western blot and radioimmunoprecipitation Chen et al., 2017) . The specific function of nsp7 is also unclear although structure-based reverse genetics studies have demonstrated that it plays an important role in arterivirus RNA synthesis (Manolaridis et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2013) .",

Studies have found that arterivirus nsp2 interacts with nsp3 and the expression of the two nsps induces the formation of structures similar to the infection-induced DMVs . PRRSV nsp1\u03b1, nsp1\u03b2 have also been reported to directly interact to nsp2 (Song et al., 2016) . Our previous study have identified the binding of nsp7\u03b1 to the viral RdRp (Chen et al., 2017) . By immunofluorescence analysis, nsp1\u03b2, nsp2, nsp4, nsp7\u03b1, nsp7\u03b2, and nsp8 have been observed to co-localize in distinct punctate foci in the perinuclear region of the cell, which is the site of viral RNA synthesis during the early stages of infection .

The different fusion partner and the relative position to the DNA strand may affect the folding and accessibility of the fusion proteins, which may result in the discrepancy in the interaction results for the nsps, respectively, acting as a bait or a prey.

Although a faint GST band as the control prey was sometimes observed to bind to the nickel magnetic beads (indicated by asterisks in Figures 3A,B) and cleaved GST was consistently detected in all the samples containing GST-nsp3/nsp5, the binding of GST-nsp3 to nsp9-his ( Figure 3A) and GST-nsp5 to His-nsp7\u03b1 ( Figure 3B ) was obvious. The interaction of GST-nsp5 to His-nsp7\u03b2 was not detected (Figure 3B) , probably due to the instability characteristics of nsp7\u03b2 that was previously reported and also observed in our studies.",

Recently, it was found that coexpression of nsp5 could result in the formation of more homogenous DMVs that were closer to what was observed upon EAV infection, suggesting that nsp5 played a regulatory role in modulating membrane curvature and DMV formation (van der Hoeven et al., 2016) . Belonging to the same family Arterivirus, PRRSV has similar gene structure and closely related to EAV. It is conceivable that PRRSV transmembrane proteins nsp2, nsp3, and nsp5 may also recognize each other and act as the same roles in the DMV formation. By Y2H and BiFC, we found that both nsp2 and nsp5 interacted with nsp3, and nsp3 could also interact itself, indicating that the three PRRSV transmembrane proteins might form a membrane-bound nsp2-nsp3(\u00d7n)-nsp5 scaffold to support the formation of RTC for the viral replication and transcription (a model is illustrated in Figure 5 ). This model is consistent with previous finding that EAV nsp3 plays a key role in the remodeling of intracellular membranes (Posthuma et al., 2008) . It is unclear if EAV nsp3 can also bind to itself, and further studies are needed to investigate whether PRRSV nsp3 is anchored on the intracellular membrane as a dimer or higher multimer.",

They also generate a nested set of subgenomic mRNAs by a unique mechanism of discontinuous minus-strand RNA template synthesis (Sawicki and Sawicki, 1995) . The relative abundance of the genomic and subgenomic RNAs is well controlled in the virus infection, and this is vital for efficient virus production (Nedialkova et al., 2010) . It is unclear how the RTC fine-tunes these various RNA synthesis processes. The association of specific replicase subunits with the RNA polymerase may regulate the balance between replication and transcription. EAV nsp1 has been identified as a \"transcription factor\" for the RdRp switch from continuous into discontinuous mode (Nedialkova et al., 2010) . Our interactome analyses detected the direct binding of nsp1\u03b1 to nsp9 by all the three assays, consisting with the previous observation that the N-terminal zinc finger domain of nsp1 was important for this function (Tijms et al., 2001; Nedialkova et al., 2010) . Mutations in other nsp1 domains were also found to strongly influence transcription (Tijms et al., 2001; Nedialkova et al., 2010) . We did not detect the interaction of nsp1\u03b2 to any nsps other than itself in Y2H screening, but nsp1\u03b2-nsp9 interaction was clearly observed by BiFC. It has been observed that nsp1\u03b1 and nsp1\u03b2 also directly interact with nsp2 by immunoprecipitation (Song et al., 2016) . Our Y2H assay showed negative results for these two pairs, which might be false negative results due to the relatively large sizes of the protein pairs, and further studies are needed to explore this.",

            "text": "Besides nsp9, the protein-protein interaction analyses also identified multiple interaction partners (nsp3, nsp5, nsp7\u03b1, nsp7\u03b2, nsp8, nsp9, nsp10, nsp11, and nsp12 itself) for nsp12, the structure and function of which is still unknown. Using high throughput proteomics, we have found that PRRSV nsp12 interacts with many cellular proteins with high probability (Dong et al., 2016) . Among the cellular proteins, HSP70 is recruited by nsp12 to maintain the protein's stability and benefit the viral replication. Another study have shown that nsp12 induces the phosphorylation of STAT1 at serine 727 and the expression of proinflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2 and IL-8 (Yu et al., 2013) . In a most recent report, nsp12 is documented to be able to induce the stabilization of karyopherin alpha6 which is required for the nuclear translocation of nsp1\u03b2 and the PRRSV replication (Yang et al., 2018) . These previous data have demonstrated the involvement of PRRSV nsp12 in the virus infection by modulating cellular factors. The identification of multiple interactions of nsp12 with viral nsps in this study suggests that nsp12, which probably exists as a homologous dimer or multimer by self-interaction, should also play an important role in the viral RNA synthesis process as a crucial component of the RTC.",
