            "text": "Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) is a porcine coronavirus. Lithium chloride (LiCl) has been found to be effective against several DNA viruses, such as Herpes simplex virus and vaccinia virus. Recently, we and others have reported the inhibitory effect of LiCl on avian infectious bronchitis coronavirus (IBV) infection, an RNA virus. In the current study, the action mechanism of LiCl on cell infection by TGEV was investigated. Plaque assays and 3-(4,5)-dimethylthiahiazo(-z-y1)-3,5di-phenyl tetrazoliumbromide (MTT) assays showed that the cell infection by TGEV was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner, when LiCl was added to virus-infected cells; the cell infection was not affected when either cells or viruses were pretreated with the drug. The inhibition of TGEV infection in vitro by LiCl was observed at different virus doses and with different cell lines. The inhibitory effect of LiCl against TGEV infection and transcription was confirmed by RT-PCR and realtime PCR targeting viral S and 3CL-protease genes. The time-of-addition effect of the drug on TGEV infection indicated that LiCl acted on the initial and late stage of TGEV infection. The production of virus was not detected at 36 h post-infection due to the drug treatment. Moreover, immunofluorescence (IF) and flow cytometry analyses based on staining of Annexin V and propidium iodide staining of nuclei indicated that early and late cell apoptosis induced by TGEV was inhibited efficiently. The ability of LiCl to inhibit apoptosis was investigated by IF analysis of caspase-3 expression. Our data indicate that LiCl inhibits TGEV infection by exerting an anti-apoptotic effect. The inhibitory effect of LiCl was also observed with porcine epidemic diarrhea coronavirus. Together with other reports concerning the inhibitory effect of lithium salts on IBV in cell culture, our results indicate that LiCl may be a potent agent against porcine and avian coronaviruses.",

            "text": "Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) belongs to the family Coronaviridae and is one of the most important causative agents of enteric infections in pigs. The infection is associated with high morbidity in animals of all ages and with high mortality rates (up to 100%) in seronegative suckling piglets [1] [2] [3] . TGEV is an enveloped virus with a positive-stranded RNA genome approximately 28.5-kb in size, and it consists of four structural proteins: the spike (S), the integral membrane (M) glycoprotein, and the nucleocapsid (N) protein [1, 4, 5] . About two-thirds of the entire RNA from the 59 end comprise open reading frames 1a and 1ab, which encode a number of nonstructural proteins including the replicase. The 39 third of the genome contains the genes encoding the structural and some nonstructural proteins (59-S-3a-3b-E-M-N-7-39) [6] . The glycoprotein S is primarily responsible for inducing neutralizing antibodies and for initiating infection [7] [8] [9] . The appearance of porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCoV), a respiratory mutant of TGEV has drastically decreased the risk of TGE in Europe, since neutralizing antibodies elicited by the avirulent PRCoV can provide cross-protection against TGEV infection [10] . In contrast, TGE prevalence is still reported and some TGEVs have been isolated in different parts of the world, e.g. in various geographical locations in China, implying that TGEV infection is still threatening pig industry [11] [12] [13] [14] .",

Generally, the SIgA in colostrum of sows vaccinated by virulent or attenuated vaccine can provide effective protection to suckling piglets; however, the potential dissemination and prevalence of infectious agent in piglets remains. In addition to enhancement of vaccine safety and efficacy, development of potential antivirals is a complementary approach in the future strategy for preventing TGEV infection. There are very limited reports concerning anti-TGEV drugs and lack of effective therapeutical treatment highlights the importance of identifying appropriate antivirals. Recently, Yang et al. (2007) used biochemical and virological methods to screen small-molecule compounds that inhibit TGEV replication. The authors found a series of benzothiazolium compounds that had inhibitory activity against TGEV 3CLpro, one of the main proteases for the replicase polyproteins in coronaviruses and these drugs exerted anti-TGEV activities in terms of viral protein synthesis and RNA replication in TGEV-infected ST cells [25] . More recently, LiCl was found to be effective in preventing infection by IBV, an avian coronavirus, in vitro [17, 18] . The findings regarding the inhibitory effect of LiCl on IBV are novel, because an inhibitory effect had been reported previously only on several DNA viruses.",

First, we used two approaches to analyze TGEV infection in two cell lines (porcine kidney cell line, PK-15 and swine testis cell line, ST). The inhibitory effect of LiCl was evident both when the virus was titrated by plaque assay and when the viability of the cells was determined by the MTT assay quantifying mitochondrial dehydrogenase activities. In addition to TGEV strain PUR46-MAD, a virulent TGEV isolate HBY was tested for its sensitivity to LiCl and was found also to be affected by this inhibitor (data not shown). At the same time, infection of different cell lines by PEDV, another porcine coronavirus and bovine rotavirus (PRV), a double-stranded RNA virus, were inhibited by LiCl effectively. These data show that inhibition by LiCl may be a general feature of some virus families, e.g. coronaviruses. In addition, we found that LiCl did not directly interact with or inactivate TGEV particles and was ineffective when pre-incubated with host cells. In contrast, it inhibited plaque formation of virusinfected cells. The results are consistent with the inhibitory effect of LiCl on IBV. We therefore confirm our hypothesis that the sensitivity of coronavirus to LiCl is a general feature of this virus family.",

Viral proteases play key roles in virus replication and have been identified as potential targets in the search for antiviral agents, e.g. for treatment of human immunodeficiency virus or hepatitis C virus infections [25] [26] [27] [28] . In our study, the conventional RT-PCR targeting the 3CLpro and a 59 leader sequence of 3a gene in conjunction with the partial TGEV S gene indicated that the effect of LiCl could be on RNA transcription and replication. For IBV and TGEV coronaviruses, it is also possible that LiCl inhibits RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, which are characteristic of positive and negativestranded RNA viruses [17] . To further address the action of LiCl on TGEV replication, the plaque formation and virus production were quantified using time-of-addition assays during the infection cycle of TGEV. Our results showed that LiCl inhibited TGEV infection effectively when added as late as 12 h after the virus inoculation, indicating that the inhibition of LiCl occurred during the whole viral replication after infection. In our study, we used different TGEV titers for cell infection and the inhibition of TGEV by LiCl in vitro was titer-independent, which implies that the drug also inhibits virus spread from cell to cell. The impact of LiCl on TGEV load evaluated by real-time PCR further confirmed its inhibition activity against TGEV.",

Interestingly, the effectiveness of Q7R against TGEV and PRCV (a respiratory variant of TGEV) was lower when compared to PEDV [29] . This finding might suggest that some coronaviruses differ in their susceptibility to the same drug. In our study, we show that coronaviruses TGEV and PEDV are equally sensitive to LiCl treatment; BRV, another RNA virus, showed a similar sensitivity to the inhibitor. Our findings suggest a consistent sensitivity of coronaviruses and some other RNA viruses to LiCl. TGEV is the first coronavirus documented to trigger apoptosis in infected cells [30] . Subsequently, infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) [31] , murine hepatitis virus (MHV) [32] , severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [33] , and equine coronavirus [34] were found to have similar apoptotic effects. In our study, we confirmed that TGEV infection induced the appearance of apoptotic cells as shown by immmunofluorescence analysis. The flow cytometry results showed that most apoptotic cells were at a stage of late apoptosis at 40 h post-infection; however, both early and late apoptosis of TGEV-infected cells was inhibited by LiCl efficiently. Caspase-3, a member of the aspartate-specific cysteinyl proteases or caspases has been identified as being a key mediator of apoptosis of mammalian cells [35] . In this study, the expression of caspase-3 was inhibited after addition of LiCl to TGEV-infected cells. PDTC, a known caspase inhibitor, was able to inhibit TGEV induced apoptosis [30] . Interestingly, we found that LiCl also had a potent inhibitory effect on TGEV-induced cell apoptosis. Apoptosis-associated caspase activation of TGEV and SARS-CoV has been reported [30, 33] . We therefore anticipate that LiCl may have protective effects on SARS-CoV induced infection and apoptosis. Taken together, the data indicate that LiCl may inhibit TGEV infection via exerting an anti-apoptotic effect mediated by caspase 3-related pathways.",
