USJCMSP initially concentrated on cholera, leprosy, parasitic diseases, tuberculosis, and viral diseases, with each of these areas forming a panel that included U.S. and Japanese scientists [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . This focus has evolved over time to reflect changing public health issues in the region and the current nine panels concentrate on 1) acute respiratory infections (ARI); 2) acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS); 3) cancer; 4) cholera and other bacterial enteric infections; 5) hepatitis; 6) mycobacterial diseases; 7) nutrition and metabolism; 8) parasitic diseases; and 9) viral diseases.

During these conferences, participants exchange information, ideas, and share current research on varying diseases of importance in the Asia-Pacific region, with the intent to foster research collaborations. Following the EID conference, the specific panels/board hold one-two-day meetings. The focus of the conference alternates yearly between viral diseases and bacterial and parasitic diseases. 2018 marked the 20th anniversary of this conference series. The 20th International Conference on EID in the Pacific Rim was held on 8-9 January, 2018 and was followed by panel/board meetings on January 10-11, 2018. The conference took place at the Coli Hotel in Shenzhen, People's Republic of China, and was locally hosted by the Shenzhen Third People's Hospital and the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) Institute of Microbiology. This report summarizes the presentations (including the latest progress and gaps from the various fields of research), discussion, and conclusions of the conference. presented a talk entitled \"Translating stem cell biology to understand gastrointestinal virus infection\" (Figure 1 ). She discussed the utilization of human intestinal enteroid (HIE) cultures as pre-clinical models to study the response of the intestinal epithelium to human gastrointestinal infections, such as rotavirus and norovirus. HIEs could lead to a better understanding of human host-pathogen interactions, including innate immune responses, and potentially to identifying and testing new drug therapies for the prevention and treatment of diarrheal diseases. b) Shimao-Takeda Lectureship-Dr. Takaji Wakita (National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Japan) presented a talk, \"Optimization of hepatitis C virus treatment and post-SVR syndrome\" (Figure 2 ). Dr. Wakita discussed the development of a method that combines cell culture data with a mathematical model and computer simulation to quantify the anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) efficacy of different drug concentrations and combinations in a preclinical setting. He reported that HCV treatment with direct-acting antivirals could achieve a sustained virologic response (SVR). However, a significant number of patients who achieve SVR developed hepatocellular carcinoma. Abnormal hepatocellular organelles in SVR patients indicate a persistent post-SVR syndrome. b) Shimao-Takeda Lectureship-Dr. Takaji Wakita (National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Japan) presented a talk, \"Optimization of hepatitis C virus treatment and post-SVR syndrome\" (Figure 2 ).

ZIKV is amplified much more frequently than other viruses through Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitos. Particularly in Africa, strains were seen to be transmitted much more efficiently by Aedes aegypti and there is no evidence that primates are intermediates of transmission. Several different topics were discussed about ZIKV including the association between ZIKV infection and microcephaly and Guillain-Barre syndrome, when and how ZIKV arrived in the Americas, and whether chikungunya and dengue virus infections can provide insight into ZIKV infection in the Americas. Several studies have failed to provide evidence of immune enhancement, although the question remains if dengue virus immunity affects ZIKV infection or vice versa. The evolution of urban transmission was also considered, with the emergence of different virus strains. V. Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF): The expansion of CCHF to Asia was reviewed. CCHFV is an orthonairovirus transmitted by the bite of the tick, Hyalomma marginatum. The incubation period of the infection is 2-7 days, and death occurs in 7-9 days. The re-assortment of genes among the CCHF viruses can lead to new strains and new diseases, with many countries reporting increased numbers of cases. This may be due to more infected ticks, amplification, migratory birds, or the live animal trade. Increased tick activity has been observed during the Eid festival, which coincides with backyard slaughter of animals, and an increase in human infection.",

Through an extensive clinical network of patients in China, randomized clinical trials are being conducted to study new treatment strategies for chronic HBV infection involving nucleotide analog reverse transcriptase inhibitors and peginterferon. An ongoing effort to prevent mother-child transmission of HBV through a short-term antiviral therapy with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate during late pregnancy, reported a significantly lower HBV transmission rate compared to the control group. This session also included a discussion of host factors related to hepatitis virus infection using a genome-wide association study (GWAS). A genetic analysis using GWAS, identified host factors for various human multifactorial diseases, as well as interferon (IFN) lambda for drug response, and HLA II genes for susceptibility to chronic HBV infection (CHB). Frequencies of HLA-DP risk alleles are high in Asian populations, whereas frequencies of HLA-DP protective alleles are high in European populations. These findings could explain the high incidence of CHB in Asian countries and suggest that host genetic factors are important to viral infections. Another talk outlined the genomic and epigenomic associations in HBV-related liver cancer using data obtained from whole genome bisulfate sequencing and whole genome sequencing. Clonal HBV integrations preferentially occurred in inactive chromatin regions; massive rearrangements were detected in the integrated HBV genome, and a negative correlation exists between HBV rearrangement number and total somatic mutation number. These observations could be useful for understanding the progression of HBV-related liver cancer. It was noted that liver cancer, including HCC and cholangiocarcinoma, is the second leading cause of cancer death (about 9.1% of total cancer deaths) with a significant burden in low-and middle-income countries in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Etiological factors associated with HCC include infection with HBV and exposure to high levels of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) in the diet. HCV-associated HCC is becoming the most rapidly rising solid tumor in the United States and Japan. The development of highly effective drugs that cure HCV infection is a major advance that, hopefully, will diminish the ",

The intent is that new or enhanced productive research collaborations will expand the knowledge and could lead to the prevention of infectious diseases and cancer. The program continues to evolve to engage more scientists from the region and specifically focuses on encouraging and fostering collaborations with young/early-stage career and female scientists from around the region. The 21st EID will convene in Hanoi, Vietnam from February 26-March 1, 2019. The local host was the Ministry of Health of Vietnam. The focus of the conference was on bacterial and parasitic diseases (for more information go to www.cvent.com/d/ytqb29). Furthermore, the program also continues to foster the research capacity of early-stage investigators and provide more opportunities for female investigators, through joint research call for proposals, funded by NIAID and AMED, on infectious diseases prevalent in Asian countries. The third round of joint collaborative research calls for proposals opened in October 2018, and the results will be announced in May 2019. In summary, the conference provided updates on the current status of infectious disease in the Pacific Rim region including information on new, emerging viruses like H7N9 avian influenza virus, SFTSV, CCHFV, and Zika, as well as pressing public health problems including hepatitis, dengue, and HIV.",

Estes (Baylor College of Medicine, U.S.A.) presented a talk entitled \"Translating stem cell biology to understand gastrointestinal virus infection\"(Figure 1). She discussed the utilization of human intestinal enteroid (HIE) cultures as pre-clinical models to study the response of the intestinal epithelium to human gastrointestinal infections, such as rotavirus and norovirus. HIEs could lead to a better understanding of human host-pathogen interactions, including innate immune responses, and potentially to identifying and testing new drug therapies for the prevention and treatment of diarrheal diseases.",

This further suggested the involvement of amino acid polymorphism at VP1-145 in cell-specific viral replication, in vivo fitness, and pathogenesis in EV71-infected individuals. IV.HIV-1: One talk presented that HIV-1 integrase (IN) is a key target of newly developed anti-retroviral drugs. High-resolution cryo-EM analysis demonstrated that IN assembles into a multimeric structure, up to 16 monomers in size, to form the intasome structure that mediates chromosomal integration. The resolution of the active site revealed the strand transfer inhibitor drug target, as well as potential new structural targets for next-generation IN inhibitors. Another talk reported that human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B57 and HLA-B27 haplotypes are associated with the control of HIV-1 viremia and disease progression in Caucasian and African populations, but are poorly represented in people of Japanese descent. The research team found that HLA-B52:01 and HLA-C12:02, found in approximately 20% of Japanese individuals, is associated with significantly lower HIV-1 viral loads and increased CD4 cell counts. In addition, the natural killer (NK) cell receptor, killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) 2DL2, may also contribute to the control of HIV-1 in Japanese individuals, suggesting both cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) and NK responses play an important role in controlling HIV disease progression.

Dr. Maureen Goodenow (Director of the NIH Office of AIDS Research, U.S.A.) opened the meeting with an overview of AIDS research funding at the NIH and emphasized the importance of basic research in support of clinical approaches for prevention, treatment, and cure of HIV/AIDS. Session 1 on the \"Clinical Impact of HIV in the Asia-Pacific Region\" featured reports of HIV/AIDS in Mongolia, Vietnam, and Thailand. Session 2 on \"HIV Molecular Virology\" featured talks focused on the cell and molecular biology of HIV. Session 3 on \"HIV, Host Cell, and Microbiome Interactions\" included presentations about host cell factors that impact HIV assembly, entry and immune responses, as well as a potential new source of latently infected cells in infected individuals. The final session titled \"Mucosal Immunology and Vaccine Responses\" included discussions of mucosal immunology, the intestinal virome, and immune control of herpesviruses. Other talks on viral diseases highlighted the commonality of viruses that, like HIV, target mucosal sites for transmission and replication and emphasized the importance of cross-disciplinary studies in viral pathogenesis and vaccine development. Discussions also focused on T-cell and NK cell responses to HIV and on strategies to perturb the lymphoid tissue architecture to flush out residual, latently infected T cells from follicular sanctuary sites. Partnering with the immunology board was particularly appreciated, as the focus on mucosal and intestinal immunology in other virologic diseases is highly relevant to HIV. Dr. Hiroshi Kiyono (University of Tokyo, Japan) from the immunology board concluded the panel meeting with a remembrance and a moment of silence to commemorate Dr. Bonnie Mathieson, who passed away on January 8th, 2018. Dr. Mathieson was a program official at NIAID and the OAR for over 40 years, touching the lives of countless research scientists around the globe. 3.2. Acute Respiratory Infections (ARI) Panel The ARI panel meeting took place on January 10th, 2018 and was chaired by Drs. Keigo Shibayama (National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Japan) and Florian Krammer (Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, U.S.A.), with secretariat Dr. Kristina T. Lu (NIAID, U.S.A.). The meeting sessions focused on 1) viral respiratory diseases, 2) respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), 3) Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), 4) coronavirus antiviral therapeutics, 5) transmission, pathogenesis, and immunity of influenza, and 6) influenza virus vaccines and inhibitors. The main objectives of the ARI panel meeting were to discuss recent research advances in viral acute respiratory infections and to establish collaborations and share resources amongst panel members and colleagues.",
