For example, Ectromelia virus, a natural pathogen of mice that causes mousepox, recently was recombined with interleukin-4 as part of an effort to develop a live virus immuno-contraceptive vaccine. Surprisingly, the recom-bined virus caused 60% mortality in 2 strains of mice, whereas the wild type virus caused no death [1] . A credible bioterrorism scenario might entail the release of such a recombined or chimeric virus tailored for maximum infectivity and pathogenicity but not readily detectable using our current \"state-of-the-art\" diagnostics (i.e., PCR and micro-array chips.) Accordingly, there is a need for methods that can identify unknown viral pathogens and which can reveal extensive genomic information. Such methods would not only prove useful for our defense against bioterrorism, but also would improve our capacities to identify and control outbreaks of naturally occurring pathogenic viruses.",

A recent example involved a case of fatal yellow fever (YF) in a traveler returning from Amazonas, Brazil in March, 2002 [3] . The otherwise healthy 47-year-old male developed fever, headache, pancytopenia, coagulopathy, renal and liver failure. Pan-cultures were negative, and a peripheral smear yielded no plasmodia. Serological tests (IgG, IgM) performed at the CDC were negative for YF, dengue, St. Louis encephalitis, and other agents, but serum specimens (unfortunately examined only post-mortem) were positive for YF viral RNA as measured by RT-PCR [3] . Subsequent attempts to isolate or culture the virus failed. This example highlights the superiority of PCR over other currently available methods. DNA chips that allow the simultaneous measurement of literally thousands of genes through hybridization are now being developed as the next-generation rapid diagnostic test for all known human pathogens [4] . However, both of these technologies rely on a relatively stable genome, and several human pathogens display a high mutation rate (e.g., HIV 2 \u00d7 10 -5 /base, 9 kB genome [5] ). Moreover, the ability to recombine \"non-pathogenic\" viruses in vitro introduces the potential not only for de novo pathogenicity but also for enhanced stealth. These considerations suggest that it may be impossible to design DNA micro-arrays which detect nucleic acids from all known and unknown viruses, including less obvious vehicles of bioterrorism such as adenovirus or rhinovirus recombined with a single gene for enhanced virulence. Accordingly, there is a great need for the development of techniques that enable the universal amplification of viral nucleic acids.",

            "text": "There are 2 strategies to amplify genetic sequences with PCR without prior knowledge of the precise sequences. The first strategy relies on the degenerate binding of arbitrarily chosen primers to sample multiple cDNAs or genomic DNA species during PCR (two related methods are known as differential display and RNA Arbitrarily Primed PCR [RAP-PCR] [6] [7] [8] ). The amplicons range in size from ~50-600 bp and overlap. RAP-PCR was recently used successfully to identify a novel human pneumovirus only after the virus had been cultured [9] . These techniques yield an amplicon \"fingerprint\" and are generally used to compare two populations of nucleic acids. Accordingly, the pneumovirus was identified by comparing infected cells with non-infected cells [9] . The other strategy is known as Sequence-Independent, Single-Primer Amplification (SISPA) and involves the directional ligation of a linker/adaptor oligonucleotide onto both ends of a target population of either DS DNA or DS cDNA (after reverse transcription from RNA) [10] . The PCR is accomplished with primers specific for the linked adaptor molecule. SISPA, followed by extensive immunoscreening, enabled the cloning of the Norwalk agent genome from stool and Hepatitis G virus from plasma [11] . Unfortunately, these techniques have not found great utility in the direct discovery or identification of novel viruses from human plasma or serum samples (unless accompanied by immunoscreening) because of the relatively high level of host genomic DNA. However, recent studies indicate that DNAse treatment of serum samples can degrade most of the host genomic DNA but not affect viral nucleic acids, which are protected by stable capsids [12] . The combination of DNAse treatment with SISPA was successfully used to identify and sequence in their entirety 2 novel parvoviruses from bovine serum [12] .",

Allander et al. recently found that subjecting bovine plasma to filtration (to remove cells) and DNAse treatment (to remove genomic DNA) was sufficient to separate viral nucleic acids from bovine nucleic acids and thus enable SISPA and cloning of novel viruses [12] . The mechanism for this effect is related to the relative sensitivity of free-host DNA to DNAse treatment and to the relative insensitivity of virus capsid-protected DNA to DNAse treatment. We have found that human plasma is replete with free DNA and RNA species and thus opted to examine the potential of DNAse and RNAse treatment to isolate viral nucleic acids. We inoculated human plasma with Adenovirus Type 17 and examined the effects of filtration, DNAse treatment and RNAse treatment on Adenovirus Type 17 DNA and on human \u03b2-actin genomic DNA and mRNA, using (RT)-PCR. In Figure 1 , we demonstrate that filtration, DNAse and RNAse treatment increases the efficiency of amplification of Adenovirus Type 17 DNA, whereas this combined treatment eliminates amplification of genomic \u03b2-actin (upper band) and \u03b2-actin cDNA (lower band). Although the addition of RNAse alone has little effect on the \u03b2-actin mRNA, the combination of DNAse and RNAse completely eliminates \u03b2-actin mRNA. We postulate that this finding may be related to the protection of RNA species by DNA:RNA hybrids. Nevertheless, these data demonstrate that we are able to remove host \u03b2-actin DNA and mRNA without degrading Adenovirus Type 17 DNA.",

We inoculated human plasma with the RNA virus Coxsackievirus A7 (CSV A7) and then filtered, treated with DNAse and RNAse, purified the remaining nucleic acids and conducted (RT)-PCR, using two commercially available reverse transcriptases (Omniscript and SuperScript II) and CSV A7 specific primers separated by either 200 bp or 1.4 Kb. We found that whereas Omniscript RT was more efficient at amplifying 200 bp cDNA species, SuperScript II RT was more efficient at amplifying 1.4 Kb fragments (Figure 5A ). Next, we used the 5'-VVVVVVVVAA-3' primers to random multiplex PCR amplify the cDNA and observed distinct albeit faint amplicons ( Figure 5B ). We cloned the amplification products and found that the amplified DNA products matched the sequence of the cloned RNA genomes as determined by BlastN alignment searches of the NCBI Non-Redundant database ( Figure 6 ). We were surprised that the cloned DNA from Coxsackievirus A7 aligned with the known sequence for Coxsackievirus A16 until we learned that the Coxsackievirus A7 strain had not been fully sequenced and is thus not in the NCBI Non-Redundant Database (search terms Coxsackievirus AND A7). Accordingly, we had amplified portions of the Coxsackievirus A7 genome that had not previously been sequenced (Figure 7) . We also inoculated human plasma with Respiratory Syncytial Virus B and were able to amplify and identify genomic RNA using the 5'-VVVVVVVVAA-3' primers (data not shown). However, the PCR amplification efficiency was poor in both RNA viruses relative to the DNA virus, AV17, and we suspect that this may be related to the efficiency of the reverse transcriptases or the stability of the RNA.",

RT-PCR of hundreds of infected clinical specimens, using primers specific for the novel virus, con-firmed the identification [13, 14] .

The rationale is, in part, that if an emerging or recombined pathogenic virus were intentionally released into a population, then the ability of physicians to detect the pathogen will be crucial for containment. A second and related application of this technique involves identification of previously undescribedbut naturally occurring -viruses in patients suffering with idiopathic disease states of possible viral etiology. A third application of these procedures may be in the screening of blood bank blood just for the presence of virus. Although the precise identification of the virus requires cloning and sequencing, the amplification pattern will provide an Most clinical laboratories that service emergency rooms and primary care clinics possess the ability to conduct RT-PCR for known viruses such as HIV, and the unmodified random multiplex (RT)-PCR method does not require any further technical expertise. In conclusion, the optimization and testing of the random multiplex (RT)-PCR technology should allow for the development of a universal virus detection assay that will vastly improve our collective defense against viral bioweapons and against emerging, heretofore unidentified natural viruses.",
