            "text": "We investigated the incidences and characteristics of pediatric traumatic injuries requiring emergency department visits, through a complementary approach using both nationwidesample and single-institutional data. Data for children (aged <15 years) identified with traumatic injuries during a 10-year period from the Korean National Health Insurance Sharing Service (n = 35,064 among 10,114,909 randomly sampled cases from the claim records of the National Health Insurance) and the authors' institute (n = 39,228) were retrospectively reviewed. The incidences and characteristics of the injuries were investigated using both datasets; additionally, detailed information regarding the injury environments was investigated using the single-institutional data. The findings were similar across both datasets. The incidence of injuries increased during the study period; the head was most commonly injured, whereas the trunk or proximal extremities were rarely injured; low-energy head injuries accounted for >50% of the cases in children aged <5 years, although the incidences of lowerextremity injuries and fractures increased in older children. Single-institutional data demonstrated that the proportion of indoor playground and trampoline-related injuries increased rapidly during the study period, and outdoor injuries and seasonal variation (with peak incidences in May and June) were more prominent in older children. Based on similarities between both datasets, the detailed results regarding pediatric traumatic injuries obtained from the singleinstitutional data could be generalized nationally with adequate external validity. To prevent traumatic injuries, it may be more effective to wear protective equipment covering the head and distal extremities rather than the trunk or proximal extremities; simple clothing, such as caps, could prevent many injuries in preschoolers. Among older children, safety guidelines for outdoor sports/leisure activities are needed. The increase in pediatric traumatic injuries may be partially explained by the increased availability of indoor playgrounds and installation of trampolines. Stricter adherence to the preventive guidelines is needed.",

These injuries occur in various places during various activities [2] and change in their patterns over time [3] [4] [5] [6] . For example, sports participation is promoted to increase physical activity among children in most developed countries [7, 8] , and participation in sports and leisure activities is increasing among this population [4, 5, 9] . By contrast, other activities in daily life, such as walking, tend to decrease [5, 6, 10] . Therefore, a comprehensive survey of pediatric traumatic injuries that is constantly updated is needed.",

The most common types of injury were open wounds and lacerations (Fig 1) . Pediatric trauma patients visited the ED 1.5-2-fold more frequently on holidays and weekends than on working days and weekdays (Table 2 ).

However, the incidences of pediatric traumatic injury in both datasets increased over time (Fig 2) . Therefore, the standardized NHISS data revealed more rapid increases than the unstandardized data. More effective preventive measures that are strictly adhered to are necessary to address the rapid growth in the incidence of pediatric traumatic injuries over the past 10 years. The more rapid increases in the incidences of injury after 2011 in the single-institutional data might be partially attributable to the opening of a pediatric emergency center in December 2010. The decreases in 2015 in both datasets may be attributable to the national recommendation to avoid ED visits where possible to suppress the outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome [20] .",

Among the surveyed variables, the proportions of indoor playgrounds and trampoline-related injuries increased rapidly (Fig 4) . The increased number of trampolines in many indoor playgrounds or trampoline parks could be a contributing factor [21] . Although trampolines are widely available in the US, the frequency of trampoline-related injuries has somewhat declined, as guidelines for their use have become broadly acknowledged [22] . However, the frequency of trampoline-related injuries has continued to increase in many other countries [23] [24] [25] . Thus, the national promotion of guidelines to prevent trampoline-related injuries, especially in public areas, is necessary. Fig 2. (A) Korean National Health Insurance Sharing Service (NHISS) data for the injury incidence rate per 1 million claim cases according to year. The incidence rate tended to increase during the 10-year study period (\u03b2 = 0.877, p = 0.001). The decrease in 2015 may be explained by the outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome, when there was an attempt to reduce emergency department visits to prevent the spread of the virus. (B) Single-institutional data for visiting patients by year. The number of injured patients tended to increase over the study period (\u03b2 = 0.933, p < 0.001) with more rapid changes occurring after 2010, which coincides with the opening of a pediatric emergency center in December of that year. (C) When the numbers of cases of single-institutional data were weighted for age and body part using the NHISS data, there was a greater increase in the single-institutional data. (D) NHISS data for the standardized injury incidence rate per 1 million claim cases by year. Although there appeared to be a greater increase in the single-institutional data in Fig 2C, the rate of increase in the NHISS data became more rapid after standardization to the population composition in 2006 (\u03b2 = 0.964, p < 0.001). Despite a decreased proportion of children aged 0-14 years, the injury incidence rate increased over time. Therefore, the rate of pediatric traumatic injuries may have increased more rapidly than assumed.",

The frequency of foot and ankle injuries was maintained consistently across the age groups, comprising 6%-8% of injuries in those aged 7 to approximately 12 years. Fracture was relatively common after the age of 5 years, and was the most common injury type in children aged >11 years ( Table 4 ). Considering that fractures affecting the lower extremities are often associated with sports or leisure activities [28, 29] , findings suggest that lower-extremity injuries become more common as children grow older because of increased participation in such activities. This assumption is supported by the finding that older children exhibited an increased rate of injuries outside the home ( Fig 3A) and a large increase in the frequency of injuries during May and June, which are suitable months for outdoor activities in authors' country because there are many holidays and the temperature is adequate (Fig 3B) . Although a diagnostic code of S53 was relatively common in children aged <5 years of age, S52 (which denotes a fracture of elbow or forearm) was relatively common in older children (Table 5) , probably as a result of increases in the supracondylar and lateral condylar humeral fractures in this age group [30] [31] [32] .",

This finding could indicate that pediatric injuries frequently occur in this period; however, it could also be a result of patients visiting the outpatient clinic rather than the ED during earlier periods (9 am to 5 pm) or be due to difficulties among parents in accessing healthcare facilities given the high proportion of young working couples in authors' country (http://www.index.go.kr/potal/main/EachDtlPageDetail. do?idx_cd=3037). These same interpretations could be used to explain the higher number of visits on holidays and weekends in both datasets (Table 2 ). More research is needed to determine the cause underlying the increased frequency of visits during the evening or on holidays; 3. (A) Place of injury by age. The home was the most common location where injury occurred in young children. As age increased, the injury rates outside the home also increased. (B) Monthly visit frequencies by age. The differences in the frequencies of emergency department visits by month became more apparent as age increased.

First, the medical environments for trauma differ by country; therefore, it is difficult to determine whether these data are generalizable outside of South Korea. Nevertheless, as the general lifestyle and medical environment become more similar globally [1] , results of the present study are likely to become applicable to many countries with similar socioeconomic conditions to ours. Second, although the NHISS and single-institutional data were similar in many aspects, it is necessary to recognize the possibility of selection bias caused by referrals of more severe cases to our institute, which is a tertiary referral hospital. Third, there may be limitations regarding the use of sample data. The sample cohort used in the present study were randomly selected and stratified data reflecting approximately 1 million claims records per year; therefore, the sample data may not reflect medical utilization among the total population, and further comprehensive studies may be needed.",

Based on the similarities between both datasets, the detailed results of the single-institutional data could be extended and applied nationally with adequate external validity. Despite the declining pediatric population, the incidence of pediatric traumatic injuries has increased, including the proportions of indoor playground and trampoline-related injuries. The increase of pediatric traumatic injuries may be partially a result of the increased availability of indoor playgrounds and installation of trampolines. Preventive guidelines have been published, but stricter adherences to their use would be needed. The most commonly injured body part was the head, followed by the upper extremities distal to the elbow (elbow to hand) and the lower extremities distal to the knee (knee to foot). Injuries of the trunk or proximal extremities such as the shoulders or hips were rare. To prevent traumatic injuries in children, it may be more effective to wear protective gear covering the head and extremities distal to the elbow or knee, rather than the trunk or proximal extremities. For preschoolers (aged <5 years), low-energy injuries of the head were most common; therefore, simple clothing such as caps could prevent many injuries in this age group. Among children aged \ufffd 5 years, the rates of lower-extremity injuries, fractures, and injuries occurring outside the home increased, and seasonal variation (peak incidence in May and June) became evident. Protective guidelines for outdoor sports and leisure activities are necessary for these children. Visits to the ED peaked between 7 and 10 pm, and on holidays and weekends. Policies to increase medical support for pediatric trauma in the ED during these periods should be considered. The present results could facilitate the establishment of preventive measures, such as educational programs, to improve the safety of children.",
