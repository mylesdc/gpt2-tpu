Therefore, the aims of this study were to identify lncRNAs in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and evaluate their transcriptomic regulation during ISA virus (ISAV) infection, an Orthomyxoviridae virus associated with high mortalities in salmonid aquaculture. Using next-generation sequencing, whole-transcriptome analysis of the Salmo salar response to ISAV infection was performed, identifying 5,636 putative lncRNAs with a mean length of 695 base pairs. The transcriptional modulation evidenced a similar number of differentially expressed lncRNAs in the gills (3,294), head-kidney (3,275), and liver (3,325) over the course of the infection. Moreover, analysis of a subset of these lncRNAs showed the following: (i) Most were similarly regulated in response to ISA virus infection; (ii) The transcript subsets were uniquely modulated in each tissue (gills, liver, and head-kidney); and (iii) A subset of lncRNAs were upregulated for each tissue and time analysed, indicating potential markers for ISAV infection. These findings represent the first discovery of widespread differential expression of lncRNAs in response to virus infection in non-model species, suggesting that lncRNAs could be involved in regulating the host response during ISAV infection.",

In contrast to protein coding genes, it is possible that the non-coding portion of the genome is related to organism complexity and crucial regulatory processes 3,4 . Traditionally, the regulatory functions of RNA were thought limited to roles as ribosomal, messenger, and transfer RNAs. However, ncRNAs have been classified as housekeeping RNAs, microRNAs, small interfering RNAs, PIWI-interacting RNAs, small ncRNAs (< 200 nucleotides [nt] in length), and long ncRNAs (lncRNAs, > 200 nt in length) 5 .",

This disease, listed by the World Organization for Animal Health, is caused by a negative sense, segmented, single-stranded RNA virus of the Orthomyxoviridae family 23 . This virus family historically consists of five genera (Influenza virus A, B, and C; Isavirus; and Thogotovirus) that differ in their host ranges and transmission routes 24 . Like other Orthomyxoviridae, ISAV mRNAs have capped, heterogeneous 5\u2032 -ends, and, due to a need for capped host nuclear RNAs as primers for mRNA synthesis, synthesis is inhibited by amanitin, a specific inhibitor of cellular RNA polymerase II 25 . The outcome of ISAV infection is determined by a complex interaction between the virus and host, which have been characterized by three, ordered waves of gene expression that produce immediate-early, delayed-early, and late responses, as well as replication of the viral genome 26,27 . However, the molecular mechanisms and transcriptional dynamics behind the host response to ISA infection are still unknown. Next-generation sequencing technologies facilitate rapid and cost-effective deep transcriptome studies in non-model species. Despite expanded data, surprisingly little remains known about how lncRNAs function, how many different types of lncRNAs exist, or even if most lncRNAs are biologically significant.",

To evaluate this, the transcriptomic responses of the gills, liver, and head-kidney of Atlantic salmon infected with the highly virulent HPR7b-ISAV strain were determined through whole RNA-Seq profiling. The results showed a widespread differentiation of lncRNAs in response to ISAV infection, suggesting that these transcripts are involved in regulating the host response to the virus. Moreover, lncRNAs accounted for approximately 5% of all expressed contig during infection. The results of this study contribute to a better understanding of ISAV pathogenesis and the interplay of lncRNAs with the immune response in Atlantic salmon.",

To investigate the regulation of lncRNAs during viral infection, a cohabitation challenge was used to infect S. salar with a highly virulent ISAV strain (HPR7b). According to Kaplan-Meier estimates of survival, the different survival rates between trojans and cohabitants were not significant in relation to the lifetime of the fish. Samples were taken at the beginning of the challenge (T0), before any mortalities; at 19 DPC (T1), with the first mortalities; at 23 DPC (T2); and at 30 DPC (T3), when the plateau phase began 26 . Whole-transcriptome analyses were performed on collected gills, liver, and head-kidney tissues using Illumina sequencing. Directional cDNA libraries were constructed by a MiSeq \u00ae Illumina sequencer, which profiled polyadenylated, coding, and noncoding transcripts, but not small RNAs 26, 27 . A large number of reads (193 million) were subjected to quality control filters for the random effects of single slide variability, leaving only transcripts that were either present or marginal in all RNA-Seq experiments. For the filtered reads, de novo assembly was performed, and 193,846 contigs were generated with an N50 value equal to 1,171 and effective mapped reads rate of 84.66%. These contigs were used as reference sequences for the identification of putative lncRNAs in Salmo salar (Fig. 1) . The difficulty to characterize the lncRNA landscape in salmon, lack of a robust lncRNA database and the low genome conservation among the fish consequence of the successive genome duplications in teleost, consequently required a several stage processing of the data with specific objectives. The first was removing the protein-coding transcripts (deleting transcripts that could encode known proteins). As a result, above 70 K contigs were annotated (E-value < 10 \u22125 ) that were discarded from further analysis. Secondly, a highly stringent filter was applied for contig coverage. This filter allows minimizing bias of the de novo assembly and discards contigs with low-coverage (12 k contigs with high coverage < 50 reads/pb).",

These observations suggest that lncRNAs are expressed in a temporal-specific manner. Meanwhile, mRNAs showed a temporal and tissue-specific modulation, novel lncRNAs expression increased during viral challenge. We observed a large number of reads mapped close to protein coding mRNAs (Fig. 3A ,B) in samples from virus-infected fish.

In regards to fish, most of the literature pertaining to lncRNAs is primarily focused on describing functional roles during ontogenetic development 39 . In the context of identifying novel mRNA-like lncRNAs, this study describes lncRNAs expression from diverse tissues in fish infected with ISAV. Next-generation high throughput sequencing technology was used to detect polyadenylated transcripts, which were then filtered through a computational analysis pipeline to identify putative, novel lncRNAs. To our knowledge, this is the first study using comprehensive deep-sequencing technology that clearly indicates the participation and correlation of lncRNAs in the fish response to viral infection.",

Our custom-designed work-flow filtered out a large portion of transcripts that could represent annotated protein coding transcripts or other non-coding RNA transcripts, such as small ncRNAs. The threshold of each lncRNA gave enrichment results that were highly dependent upon the cutoff used. Due to this, a more robust, threshold-independent method was used.

In consequence, 5,635 lncRNAs were identified for S. salar (cut-off < 30 amino acids), were classified as novel lncRNAs not previously reported in salmonids.

This finding is in agreement with previous results on monocytes challenged with bacterial lipopolysaccharide that drives changes in transcriptomic dynamics of lncRNAs suggesting an importance ofthese molecules during the defense response 42 . In this study, the rapid changes observed in lncRNAs during ISAV infection suggests that the abundance of lncRNAs is highly regulated. During the defense response of S. salar to ISA infection, a highly selective modulation of immune-like mRNAs is required 26 . Therefore, an intrinsic question is if the turn over rate of lncRNAs is regulated by a mechanism comparable to that regulating the stability of mRNAs during the defense response. Studies of lncRNAs in yeast 43 have shown that decapping is a crucial mechanism in regulating the stability of mRNAs, where this decapping promotes the rapid and robust induction of genes associated with galactose utilization. Thus, the regulatory mechanism of lncRNA performance may play an essential role in the transcription of mRNA during the defense response to pathogens.",

Alternatively, some of the downregulated lncR-NAs might be highly expressed in control tissues and later stages of infection to maintain homeostasis.

The relevance of host cell factors during ISAV replication has been previously identified, revealing the involvement of several antiviral networks in ISAV replication 26, 27 . This mechanism has been fully characterized in other Orthomyxoviridae, such as IAV 46, 47 .

HPR7b-ISAV infection triggered a wide range of host defense responses associated with significant differences in the magnitude of the transcriptomic response. As previously shown, HPR7b-ISAV infection is able to promote a strong, tissue-specific, antiviral response in antiviral genes Mx1, IRFa, and Viperin 26 . The present study sheds new light on lncRNAs that may be involved in host defense to ISAV infection. Specifically, seven lncRNAs were highly correlated with antiviral mRNA expression in all of the examined tissues, none of which have been described before. Among these lncRNAs, Ss_lncRNA_4968, Ss_lncRNA_575, and Ss_lncRNA_1421 were significantly upregulated after HPR7b-ISAV infection. The expression of Ss_lncRNA_2198 was highly correlated with ISAV-segment 7 replication in the liver and was positively correlated with GIG2. These results suggest that some lncRNAs might modulate the fish defense response during viral infection, in addition to highlighting the richness of this dataset for future analyses that could generate new hypotheses and understandings on ISA virus pathogenesis and lncRNA functions. To check the sequence conservation of the lncRNAs, we used the synteny block analysis by Ulitsky et al. 1 . The limited knowledge of lncRNAs sequence in fish restricted the success of this analysis, which displayed a low conservation across different mammalian species 1 .",

In addition, this study greatly expanded on the existing annotation of lncRNAs in fish and described significant regulation of 5,636 lncRNAs, most of which have not been previously described following ISA virus infection. Taking into consideration the limitations of the genomic information in S. salar (annotation, genomic and chromosome location, DNA scaffolds, etc), we classified the lncRNAs in intronic or promoter region, the results showed that most of the selected lncRNAs were intergenic and, in the case of Ss_lncRNA_4977 and Ss_lncRNA_574, were located tightly linked with innate immune response and antigen presentation genes. However to full characterization of lncRNAs further studies of its molecular basis are required. In agreement with the above in contributing to the general knowledge of lncRNA functions, we expect that this work will aid in experimentally characterising lncRNAs in non-model species. As the function of lncRNAs remains poorly understood in fish, our results become a useful resource for exploring the role of the non-protein coding transcriptome during viral infection. LncRNAs may represent a whole new class of innate immunity signaling molecules 50 , viral-dependent regulators, or even a new layer of gene expression regulation responsible for modulating host responses during viral infection. Similarly, lncRNAs may also represent a new potential class of biomarkers for infectious diseases. The similar differential regulation of lncRNAs in response to ISA virus infection indicates that lncRNA-based signature of virus infection may exist, suggesting additional diagnostic potential for fish infections. In particular, the mechanistic characterization of lncRNAs belonging to the viral response would have broad impacts in fields as fish immunology. Finally, in the near future, it is likely that detailed knowledge of lncRNA regulation and function will be necessary for fully understanding viral pathogenesis in fish.",

A strict E value of 1 \u00d7 10 \u22125 was used as threshold for the identification of unannotated sequences. Therefore, sequences with higher E-values were treated as unannotated transcripts and used for further analysis. Later, contigs with an average read coverage below 50 were also removed.",

Coding potential is a support vector machines-based classifying system that comprehensively scores transcript characteristics, including the presence and integrity of predicted ORFs, similarity to known protein sequences, and conservation of a single frame. The following three approaches were used to identify and discard transcripts that could encode for proteins: (i) The Coding Potential Assessment Tool was used to discriminate coding and noncoding transcripts from a large pool of candidates 28, 30 ; (ii) The transcripts with an ORF length of less than 30 amino acids (defined for lncRNA as < 200 base pairs) were chosen; and (iii) An NCBI conserved domain search was used to identify transcripts that could encode for protein-conserved domains. The remaining transcripts were mapped against the latest version of the S. salar genome (Acc. No. AGKD00000000.4), considering a mismatch cost = 2, insertion cost = 3, deletion cost = 3, length fraction = 0.8, and a similarity fraction = 0.8. The predicted lncRNAs were aligned against previously obtained datasets for Salmo salar. Likewise, the predicted lncRNAs were checked for matches to any protein coding isoforms (BLASTx). Those transcripts that had any match with protein coding isoforms were removed from further analyses.",

Expression values were estimated as RPKM and normalized against the total set, using state numbers in reads per 1000000. To identify lncRNAs highly regulated during ISAV infection in each tissue, the Z-test was used for statistical analysis 51 . This test counts data and compares single samples against one another. The Z-test is based on an approximation of binominal distribution by using normal distribution and taking proportions rather than raw counts into consideration. Additionally, p-values were false discovery rate-corrected. A Volcano plot was used to select and extract the most differentially expressed transcripts, with highly regulated transcripts being those with |fold changes| > 2 and p-values < 0.01, as compared to the control group (day 0).",

RT-qPCR was performed using the StepOnePlus \u2122 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Life Technologies, USA), and each assay was run in triplicate using the Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). Each reaction was conducted with a volume of 10 \u03bcL using the Maxima \u00ae SYBR Green/ROX qPCR Master Mix (Thermo Scientific, USA). Five putative housekeeping genes (Elongation factor 2-alpha (ELF-2), \u03b2-actin, GAPDH, 18 s rRNA, and S20) were statistically analyzed using the NormFinder algorithm to assess transcriptional expression stability. Through analysis, ELF-2 was selected for gene normalizations. Relative expression levels were determined by applying the \u0394\u0394Ct method, using ELF-2 as an endogenous control and for gene normalization.
