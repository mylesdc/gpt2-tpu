Nasopharyngeal specimens obtained at enrollment were first tested by single-reaction PCR for adenovirus, then further evaluated by a multiplex PCR assay for other respiratory viral pathogens. Symptoms over a 28-day period were collected. Results We enrolled 1536 individuals, among whom 43 (2\u00c18%) were positive for adenovirus. The median age of cases was 3\u00c14 years (range: 4 months to 41 years). Three were hospitalized. Species and serotype information was available for 33 (76\u00c17%) cases. Species C (n = 21) was the most common, followed by B3 (n = 9) and one each of E4a, D46, and A. Species C infections were more frequent in children (P < 0\u00c101). Half of the cases were positive for at least one other respiratory viral pathogen. Symptoms were generally mild and most commonly included cough (90%), fatigue (79%), rhinorrhea (74%), loss of appetite (71%), and sore throat (64%). Children with non-C adenovirus infection were more likely to report sore throat (P = 0\u00c105) and hoarseness (P = 0\u00c106) than those with species C infection.",

They have considerable antigenic diversity, with >54 unique serotypes having been described. 1 The severity of adenovirus-associated respiratory infections varies considerably: Adenovirus has been isolated from asymptomatic individuals 2 or largely associated with mild upper respiratory illness. 3 By contrast, adenovirus has been implicated in outbreaks of severe respiratory disease among military trainees, some with fatal outcomes. 4, 5 The heightened risk of adenovirus infection among military recruits stimulated the initial development, as well as the reintroduction, of an adenovirus vaccine specifically for these populations. Routine use of adenovirus vaccine at military training centers has led to significant declines in overall rates, as well as dramatic shifts in the etiologic burden, of febrile respiratory illness. 6, 7 Large-scale, population-based studies have described the various clinical manifestations of adenovirus infection and serotype-specific differences in severity at the time of clinical presentation. 8, 9 More recent studies of adenovirus-associated respiratory infections have been done; however, these were restricted to hospitalized children. 10 To our knowledge, few published studies of adenovirus-associated respiratory infection have utilized multiplex diagnostic assays, suggesting that while adenovirus may have been associated with illness, the influence of a coinfecting viral pathogen on symptom severity could not be ruled out. Herein we describe the burden and clinical characteristics of adenovirus-associated influenza-like illness among otherwise healthy children and adults at United States military hospitals from 2009 to 2014.",

Adenovirus detection and typing was done using the Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR system (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) using a laboratory-developed adenovirus real-time PCR assay that targets the penton region. This assay has been validated against a previously described, CAP-accredited PCR assay (Appendix 1). 12 Adenovirus-positive samples were subsequently tested by a multiplex diagnostic panel (Diatherix TEM-PCR; Diatherix Laboratories, Inc.; Huntsville, AL) that included primers for common viral respiratory pathogens, including adenovirus, influenza, parainfluenza, rhinovirus, coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, and Coxsackie virus.",

In general, symptom severity was greater for non-type C infections. Unfortunately, due to limited numbers of infections, these differences did not reach statistical significance. However, these findings are consistent with those of other studies that non-C adenovirus infections, specifically serotypes 7 and 14, can be associated with high morbidity and, in some cases, mortality. 14-16 Our B species infections were largely type B3 and generally mild. By contrast, severe cases of type B3 infection in otherwise healthy children have been previously described. 17 Multiple severe infections with a variety of B subtypes have also been described in military recruits, suggesting that the entire B subgroup may have a higher propensity for severe disease in children and young adults. 12 Underlying epidemiologic and virologic differences between adenovirus species likely accounts for the findings of our study. While a number of species B adenoviruses have been associated with severe respiratory disease outbreaks among otherwise healthy adults, 5,12 species C adenoviruses are encountered much earlier in life as common causes of acute respiratory infection among infants and young children. 18, 19 Moreover, species C adenovirus infections are persistent; periods of latent infection, viral reactivation, and prolonged shedding of species C adenoviruses have been described. 20 This phenomenon of asymptomatic persistent infection may explain the endemic nature of species C adenovirus infection and may also account for observed milder forms of disease due to frequent interaction with the human host.",

Therefore, the clinical course of adenovirus-associated infection described in our study population is similar to those of other upper respiratory viruses. 21, 22 Recruitment and enrollment in our observational study of influenza-like illness took place in outpatient clinics and inpatient settings of five major military treatment facilities in the United States. Children and spouses of military personnel are eligible to participate and comprised the majority of patients with adenovirus-associated respiratory infections. As a result, we were not able to accurately assess the burden of adenovirus infection among active duty military personnel, some of whom may have received adenovirus vaccine while in basic training. We did not collect information on participant's prior receipt of adenovirus vaccine. Moreover, the majority of our study sites are not proximal to military training centers where the populations at highest risk for severe respiratory disease due to adenovirus (i.e., military recruits) reside. 6, 7 There are several strengths to this study. First, in an otherwise healthy, majority outpatient population, we described the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of adenovirus-associated respiratory infections in the context of the overall burden of ILI. The low frequency of solely adenovirus infections, in the absence of underlying medical conditions, suggests the majority of adenovirus infections may be relatively mild in nature, and may not result in patients seeking medical care. Second, our cases stemmed from a multiyear, multisite protocol, thereby minimizing the impact of temporal and/or geographic differences in trends of disease. Third, we utilized a multiplex PCR assay to assess the prevalence of other viral respiratory pathogens. The prevalence of viral codetection was rather high, even among adult patients, and several fold higher than those reported among military recruits. 23 If these codetections do in fact ",

Because the adenovirus cases were identified from a larger population of patients, all of whom presented with a febrile, influenza-like illness, we were not able to enroll individuals who were PCR positive for adenovirus yet asymptomatic.

While adenovirus appears to be an infrequent cause of ILI that is relatively mild in nature, our case series investigation demonstrated the propensity for more severe symptoms with non-type C adenovirus infections. In addition, the observed high prevalence of viral codetection among those with adenovirus-associated illnesses underscores the importance of using multiplex diagnostic platforms, particularly when elucidating the etiology of respiratory illness and characterizing the severity of symptoms caused by particular pathogens.",

The validation for the real-time PCR assay was as follows: Among 100 samples tested (60 adenovirus, 40 influenza), the sensitivity was 100% and the specificity was 90\u00c12%.The original, conventional PCR assays were CAP-accredited and validated using viral culture as the gold standard. The first PCR assay was a universal primer set that targeted a 122-base pair region of the penton gene and had a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 94\u00c19% when compared to viral culture. The second PCR assay was specific to species B, C, and E and targeted the E1A gene. This assay had a sensitivity of 97\u00c19% and specificity of 94\u00c18% when compared to viral culture. Influenza detection during this time was also done using two laboratory-developed PCR assays. Both assays were universal primer sets that amplified the 93-and 239-base pair regions of the matrix gene, respectively.",
