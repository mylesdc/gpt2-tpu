Immune-mediated pulmonary damage is manifested clinically in a variety of ways depending on location and extent of injury. Thus, the antiviral immune response represents a balancing act between the elimination of virus and immune-mediated pulmonary injury. In this review, we highlight major components of the host response to acute viral infection and their role in contributing to mitigating respiratory damage. We also briefly describe common clinical manifestations of respiratory viral infection and morphological correlates. The continuing threat posed by pandemic influenza as well as the emergence of novel respiratory viruses also capable of producing severe acute lung injury such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and enterovirus D68, highlights the need for an understanding of the immune mechanisms that contribute to virus elimination and immunemediated injury.",

Cytopathology or death by starvation can also result from virus usurpation of host cellular machinery and metabolic processes [2] . Thus, death of infected cells caused directly by virus does play some role in lung pathology during infection.

PRRs that are important for detection of viruses include Toll-like receptors (TLRs), retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I), NOD-like receptors (NLRs), and other cytosolic virus sensors. Although these receptors are expressed in many types of cells, their activation in respiratory epithelial cells, typically among the first cell types to be infected, is critical in limiting virus spread and alerting the immune system to respond to the infection. Activation of PRRs in these cells by virus infection triggers production and release of type I and III interferons (IFNs) and other proinflammatory mediators (e.g., cytokines, chemokines, and antimicrobial peptides) which initiate the host innate and adaptive immune response. Thus, the degree of PRR activation throughout the respiratory tract ultimately influences the degree of immune cell recruitment and proinflammatory mediator release and subsequently, any immunopathology ensued.",

The type I IFN response can induce the expression of hundreds of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) which primarily serve to limit further virus spread and infection. However, type I IFNs can also directly activate immune cells (e.g., stimulating phagocytosis, dendritic cell maturation) as well as indirectly initiate immune responses (e.g., stimulating the production of chemokines and cytokines by respiratory cells). Intrinsic antiviral activity by type I IFNs includes impairing viral processes such as cell entry, replication, transcription, and translation [4] .

In contrast, influenza viruses generally do not infect human endothelium although some effectively replicate within avian endothelium [33] . Therefore, the degree to which endothelial cells contribute to respiratory pathogenesis depends in part on virus tropism and the direct cytopathic effects and cytokine signaling induced by a replicating virus (similar to virus-infected respiratory epithelium). Viruses that infect endothelium may induce more significant lung injury particularly to the alveolar epithelium as a result of increased vascular permeability, edema, and spatial proximity to alveolar cells.

Extravasation of immune cells into the lungs from the circulation (or alternatively resident pulmonary DC migration to the draining lymph nodes) is highly dependent on interactions between endothelium and leukocytes. Selectins and adhesion molecules requisite for extravasation are upregulated on endothelium in response to cytokines and growth factors secreted by respiratory epithelium and other neighboring cells [35] . Activated endothelium can also secrete proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as IL-6, MIG/CXCL9, IP-10/CXCL10, type I and type II IFNs, MCP-1/CCL2, and TNF-\u03b1 in response to a virus infection [35] . Inhibition of these processes in endothelial cells in an animal model of lethal influenza infection greatly improved survival [36] . Thus, endothelial cells can facilitate pulmonary injury by heightened leukocyte recruitment and cytokine secretion during a highly pathogenic virus infection. The extent of pulmonary tissue that is infected or damaged and the amounts of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines generated in response, influences the degree of endothelial activation. Ultimately, if uncontrolled or too extensive, these processes can be more damaging than beneficial by recruiting more immune cells that either injure the lungs directly or further propagate inflammation causing a Bcytokine storm.\u0124 owever, insufficient leukocyte recruitment or cytokine production can leave the host susceptible to the virus.",

During homeostasis, alveolar macrophages regularly encounter innocuous antigens. To prevent inappropriate inflammatory responses to these benign antigens, the lung environment maintains alveolar macrophages in a suppressive state. Negative regulation of alveolar macrophages is accomplished through expression of IL-10, alphaV/beta6 integrin, GM-CSF, CD200 receptor, and pulmonary surfactants by alveolar epithelium [37] . Upon respiratory virus infection, the environment of the alveolar sac quickly changes, and expression of the negative regulators declines. This change in the lung environment coupled with detection of viral antigens and exposure to proinflammatory mediators enables alveolar macrophages to adopt a proinflammatory phenotype, which assists in initiating the host immune response and viral clearance. While the mechanism of protection remains unclear, a growing body of evidence has demonstrated that alveolar macrophages are essential during respiratory viral infection. For example, during RSV infection, they are responsible for early cytokine and IFN production that orchestrates the initial antiviral response [38] .",

Neutrophils can suppress T cell responses through the production of suppressive factors such as inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and arginase 1. In other cases, neutrophils may promote T cell responses through the secretion of IFN-\u03b3 or Ag presentation [40, 45] . The mechanisms that neutrophils utilize to support adaptive immune responses during respiratory viral infections and the impact that these activities have on viral clearance, injury and recovery will need to be investigated further.",

The role of ILC (other than NK cells) during respiratory virus infection is unclear although ILC2 have been reported to facilitate repair after lung injury [46] . NK cells respond to viral infection within a few days producing significant amounts of IFN-\u03b3, killing virus-infected cells, and supporting the adaptive immune response. NK cells are uniquely equipped with a diverse set of receptors that enable them to distinguish normal cells (via inhibitory receptors) from virus-infected or transformed cells (via activating receptors). Activating receptors can recognize viral or tumor antigens-allowing the NK cells to eliminate both infected and tumor cells. In response to chemokines, additional NK cells are recruited within a few days (following neutrophil recruitment but prior to the arrival of effector T cells) and facilitate the transition from the initial, potent inflammatory responses to the more specific adaptive response [47] .",

NK cells kill infected cells by releasing cytotoxic granules, engaging death receptors, or utilizing antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC)-a process in which antibodies bind viral proteins expressed on the surface of infected cells marking them for elimination [47, 48] . All of these cytotoxic processes promote viral clearance and limit viral spread. However, viruses such as some strains of influenza virus have adapted mechanisms to activate inhibitory receptor signaling, preventing NKmediated killing [47] . Additionally, despite inefficient viral replication within NK cells, infection of NK cells by some respiratory viruses can induce apoptosis limiting the numbers of NK cells and thus, early cytotoxic functions to control viral dissemination [39] . Depletion of pulmonary NK cells impairs viral clearance and subsequently, leads to more severe disease [47, 49] . NK cells also augment CTL (cytotoxic T lymphocyte) activity through IFN-\u03b3 production [49, 50] . In some viral infections such as RSV, robust production of IFN-\u03b3 by NK cells may contribute to lung injury [51] . Therefore, the type of virus and inoculating dose may influence whether NK cells contribute to lung pathology or not. Finally, NK cells have recently been shown to secrete IL-22 which promotes tissue repair mechanisms [52] . Overall, NK cells appear to primarily have a beneficial role during respiratory viral infection by clearing virus, promoting the CTL response, and facilitating tissue repair. [53] . The best-characterized and most studied subset of NKTs in the context of viral infections is invariant NKT (iNKT) cells which express a semivariant TCR that recognizes lipid molecules-most likely endogenous self lipids during viral infection since viruses lack exogenous lipid antigens. Cytokines may also activate iNKTs during respiratory viral infection. iNKTs support effector responses but also limit the degree of lung injury by regulating other immune responses and virus-mediated sequelae. iNKTs support CTL and NK responses through cytokine production and promoting the licensing, cross-priming and maturation of DCs, and limiting the immunosuppressive activity of virally induced myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) [53, 54] . iNKTs limit inflammation-mediated damage by regulating inflammatory monocyte activity and promote repair processes during the recovery phase through the secretion of IL-22 [54] . Mice deficient in iNKTs suffer from more severe disease in response to RSV or influenza virus infection [54] . iNKT cells exhibit multi-faceted roles in modulating the immune response to viral pathogens and appear to be mostly beneficial in limiting lung injury during acute infection.",

DCs activate T cells, secrete various cytokines and chemokines, and promote protective adaptive immunity. Some DC subsets preferentially reside in either lymphoid or non-lymphoid tissue; while other subsets can migrate between these tissues. Under normal, non-inflamed conditions, respiratory DC populations can be found below and within conducting airway epithelium as well as in the lower airways within the walls of alveoli [59] . Thus, they are strategically positioned to sample antigens throughout the upper and lower respiratory tract. In mice, resident pulmonary DCs include conventional CD11b+ DCs and CD103+ DCs as well as plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) [59] . Human pulmonary DC populations similarly include pDCs and two subsets of myeloid DCs that functionally resemble the CD11b+ (CD1+ DCs) and CD103+ (CD141+/CLEC 9A DCs) subsets found in mice [39] . In response to infection, some CD103+ and CD11b+ DCs acquire viral antigens and migrate to the draining lymph nodes (DLN) activating adaptive immune responses while other DCs remain in the lungs promoting local immune responses [59, 60] . Nonresident monocytederived DCs (mo-DCs) also accumulate in the lungs as inflammatory monocytes migrate into the lungs and differentiate into either macrophages or DCs. DCs can be activated directly by virus through PRRs and indirectly by proinflammatory chemokines and cytokines released by respiratory epithelium and other resident immune cells [59] .",

Although pDCs can transport viral antigens from the lungs to the DLN, pDCs are poor stimulators of na\u00efve T cell activation and differentiation due to low expression of costimulatory molecules [59, 61] . Thus, pDCs may be dispensable during certain respiratory viral infections. In response to RSV infection, however, pDCs may suppress inflammation and promote viral clearance, protecting against severe lung injury [62] . The precise functions of pDCs during respiratory viral infections warrant further study to understand how different subsets of pDCs in response to different viruses contribute to viral clearance, modulation of the immune response, and lung injury.",

They can also further propagate an inflammatory response through the production of CXCL10/IP-10 and CCL2/MCP-1, recruiting more inflammatory monocytes to the lungs. During a recall response, mo-DCs may activate cytotoxic responses of memory CD8 T cells and NK cells through cytokine production, enabling swift and efficient pathogen clearance [60] . Elevated numbers of mo-DCs that express CCR2 (chemokine receptor for CCL2) or produce high amounts of TNF-\u03b1 and NO are associated with greater morbidity and mortality in response to viral infection [11, 59, 60] . While blocking mo-DC activity or deficiency in CCR2 improves survival and mitigates severe lung pathology in experimental virus infection, complete depletion of mo-DCs leads to uncontrolled virus spread and more severe disease [11, 59] .

However, a defect in the CD8+ T cell response and viral clearance may also occur when the CCR2+ population is completely eliminated. An attenuated rather than complete deletion of the inflammatory monocyte response has been shown to allow effective viral clearance while limiting inflammatory and immune-mediated damage to the lungs [11, 63] .

Antibodies can bind to viral proteins expressed on the surface of infected cells, triggering the complement cascade and antibody-mediated cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC)-processes that ultimately eliminate infected cells.

However, when CD4 T cells are adoptively transferred into SCID (severe combined immunodeficiency) mice that lack functional T and B cells, CD4 T cells are no longer sufficient for protection, and depletion of CD4 T cells during SARS-CoV infection coincided with a reduction in antibody production [64] . During infection, T FH cells promote the formation of germinal centers in secondary lymphoid tissues where virus-specific B cells mature, proliferate, undergo antibody class switching, and differentiate into either antibody-producing plasma cells or longterm memory cells. T FH cell numbers have been shown to correlate with the production of influenza-specific IgG and IgM antibodies after vaccination in healthy young adults [65] .",

Each year influenza vaccines are administered in order to enrich circulating neutralizing antibodies specific to that year's predicted strains. This strategy has been substantiated by data demonstrating that rhinovirus and influenza-neutralizing antibodies in the serum, prior to infection, correlate with disease protection [66] . Similarly, a neutralizing antibody response to the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV has also been shown to be completely protective for a susceptible host although antibody titers are relatively short lived [67] . One of the disadvantages to a vaccine that primarily elicits an antibody response, though, is the lack of a protective, cell-mediated immune response which is particularly important in the context of viral infections.",

SARS-CoV are relatively new pulmonary viruses whose pathogeneses are still being elucidated; however, research indicates that CD8 T cells are essential for virus clearance. Adoptive transfer of SARS-CoV-activated T cells into SCID mice enhanced survival and reduced pulmonary virus titers [68] . Thus, the elimination of virus-infected cells through cell-mediated immunity is important to completely resolve infection. The primary function of CD8 T cells during respiratory viral infections is the elimination of virus-infected cells by inducing apoptosis through a variety of mechanisms. CD8 T cells engage death receptors such as FAS expressed by virus-infected cells and release perforin and granzymes which create pores in the cell membrane and initiate apoptotic pathways, respectively.",

Furthermore, virus-specific CD8 T cells in RAG1 knockout mice exacerbate lung injury and accelerate mortality [69] . During experimental RSV infection, depletion of both CD4 and CD8 T cells enabled continued virus replication, but no illness was evident [70] . Ultimately, the adaptive immune response is required for resolution of infection and confers longterm protection from future encounters with the virus, preventing future disease; however, the adaptive immune response is also very potent and if extensive, can cause sufficient respiratory damage to impair pulmonary function.",

Among respiratory viruses, influenza viruses, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV are commonly capable of spreading into the bronchi and bronchioles in otherwise healthy individuals. However, in infants and young children, RSV frequently infects small conducting airways and is a leading cause of pediatric hospitalization worldwide [74] .

However, because of the progressively decreasing diameter of LRT conducting airways, inflammation and injury in this compartment-e.g., desquamation of airway epithelial cells in response to RSV or airway epithelial cell hyperplasia during influenza infection-results in more severe compromise of respiratory function. The absence of ciliated epithelial cells in the LRT limits the expulsion of mucus, proteinaceous fluid, bacteria, and cellular fragments from these airways. This is compounded by enhanced epithelial mucus secretion, vasculature leak, edema, mucosal inflammation, and epithelial sloughing. The influx of inflammatory cells in response to signals from infected epithelium and tissue resident innate immune cells increases edema, vascular congestion, and tissue swelling further limiting air passage through smaller airways. The buildup of edematous fluid, mucus and fibrin plugs in small bronchi and bronchioles can restrict airflow to terminal airways further preventing efficient gas exchange. Increased pressure within the blood vessels leaks more fluid into the airspaces. As all these factors build up in the already restricted bronchi and bronchioles, they begin to clot and form plugs that prevent gas exchange. This manifests clinically as wheezing and shortness of breath. In serious cases, this can lead to difficulty in breathing which requires oxygen therapy. Typically with supportive care, bronchitis and bronchiolitis will resolve in a few days without lasting effects.",

The terminal airways are the site of gas exchange and make up the majority of the airway surface of the lung. During infection, loss of tight junctions, vasculature leak, buildup of edematous fluid and fibrin in the alveolar airspaces can result in necrosis of the alveolar cells and hyaline membrane formation. If severe, these changes can lead to diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), manifested clinically as ARDS and respiratory failure. Inflammatory processes and immune responses as described previously compromise the function and properties of terminal airways and terminal airway epithelial cells in a fashion analogous to that of conducting airways. Furthermore, a loss of surface tension and surfactant resulting in alveolar collapse represent additional threats to pulmonary function in the terminal airways. The terminal airways of survivors of acute viral pneumonia can result in alteration of pulmonary elasticity due to organization of inflammatory processes during the resolution phase which may have lasting consequences and put the host at risk for superinfections [72, 73, 75] .
