This yielded 394 patients (197 viral and 197 bacterial) . Additionally we anticipated that roughly 15% of the patients will have an indeterminate source of infection, 10% would be excluded for technical reasons and 10% will be healthy or non-infectious controls. Taken together, the study required the recruitment of at least 607 patients. This requirement was fulfilled because 1002 patients were recruited.",

The process was terminated when the increase in performance on the training set was no longer statistically significant (P>0.05). Both processes converged to the same final set of three proteins. To integrate the protein levels into a single score, we examined multiple computational models. Their performances were not significantly different (P>0.1 Supplementary Materials). We chose to a Multinomial Logistic Regression (MLR) model because it provides a probabilistic interpretation by assigning a likelihood score to a patient's diagnosis [4] . The signature uses this property to flag patients whose probability of bacterial infection is intermediate: between 0.35 and 0.55. We use the term 'marginal immune response' to describe these patients because their profile borders between bacterial and viral host-responses.",
