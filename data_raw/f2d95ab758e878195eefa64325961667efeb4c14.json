            "text": "Current efforts to develop Zika virus (ZIKV) subunit vaccines have been focused on premembrane (prM) and envelope (E) proteins, but the role of NS1 in ZIKV-specific immune response and protection is poorly understood. Here, we develop an attenuated recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV)-based vaccine expressing ZIKV prM-E-NS1 as a polyprotein. This vectored vaccine candidate is attenuated in mice, where a single immunization induces ZIKV-specific antibody and T cell immune responses that provide protection against ZIKV challenge. Co-expression of prM, E, and NS1 induces significantly higher levels of Th2 and Th17 cytokine responses than prM-E. In addition, NS1 alone is capable of conferring partial protection against ZIKV infection in mice even though it does not induce neutralizing antibodies. These results demonstrate that attenuated rVSV co-expressing prM, E, and NS1 is a promising vaccine candidate for protection against ZIKV infection and highlights an important role for NS1 in ZIKV-specific cellular immune responses.",

Sporadic outbreaks of ZIKV have since been reported in Africa and Asia 4 . Historically, people infected with Zika virus have no or mild symptoms including fever, rash, muscle pain, red eyes, headache, and conjunctivitis 4, 5 . However, in 2015 a ZIKV pandemic began in South America, Central America, the Caribbean, and the USA, suddenly becoming a global public health issue 5 . Importantly, ZIKV from these recent outbreaks can cause Congenital Zika Syndrome (including microcephaly), Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, and other severe neurological disorders 6, 7 . ZIKV is primarily transmitted through the bite of an infected Aedes species mosquito although other transmission modes such as sexual, blood transfusion, and maternal-fetal are also possible [8] [9] [10] . Currently, there is no FDAapproved vaccine or antiviral drug for ZIKV.",

The ZIKV genome encodes a single polyprotein that is cleaved posttranslationally into three structural proteins (capsid, premembrane, and envelope) and seven nonstructural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5) 11, 12 . The E protein is a type II fusion protein which mediates cellular attachment and membrane fusion, and is the target for most neutralizing antibodies (Abs). Flavivirus prM protein typically associates with E to form heterodimers and is important for proper folding of E [13] [14] [15] [16] . Co-expression of prM and E of several flaviviruses including ZIKV results in the secretion of virus-like particles (VLPs) termed recombinant subviral particles [17] [18] [19] . The prM protein is an integral part of both virions and subviral particles, and undergoes a cleavage event during virus maturation 20 . Therefore, prM and E proteins have been the primary targets for the rational design of subunit and recombinant flavivirus vaccines. However, the NS1 protein of several flaviviruses has been shown to confer protection against flavivirus infection in animal models in the absence of detectable neutralizing antibody [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] . Whether immunization with the ZIKV NS1 protein has similar protective capabilities is currently unknown.",

Antigens are highly expressed in both cell culture and animals by VSV, enabling the generation of strong systemic immune responses 35, 37 . In response to the sudden outbreaks of Ebola virus in Africa in 2013, a VSV-based Ebola virus vaccine was tested in human clinical trials [38] [39] [40] [41] . In general, VSV is safe in humans although high doses of VSV can cause side effects in some people including joint and muscle pain [39] [40] [41] . Importantly, the VSV-based Ebola virus vaccine was shown to be highly efficacious in protecting against Ebola virus infection in humans [39] [40] [41] . During preparation of this manuscript, Betancourt et al., reported that maternal antibody derived from female C57BL/6 mice inoculated with VSV expressing prM-E can protect offspring from lethal ZIKV infection 42 .

A 54 kDa full-length E protein was detected in cells infected with rVSV-prM-E and rVSV-prM-E-NS1 but not with rVSV-E (Fig. 1a, b) . The NS1 protein was only detected in rVSV-prM-E-NS1 infected cells (Fig. 1c) , as expected. A smaller E protein was detected in cells expressing the truncated E protein, consistent with the shorter C-terminal domain (Fig. 1a) . Quantitative analysis of three independent experiments showed that rVSVs co-expressing prM with E or E truncations had approximately five times greater E protein expression compared to rVSVs expressing E or E truncations without prM. Western blot of cell culture supernatants showed that all rVSVs co-expressing prM and E/E truncations released enough E/E truncation proteins into the supernatant to be easily detectable without the need for concentration ( Supplementary Fig. 3A, B) . The expression of prM followed by truncated E likely results in the secretion of soluble E. NS1 protein was also secreted into cell culture medium (Supplementary Fig. 3C ). However, no E/E truncation was detectable in cell medium from rVSVs expressing E/E truncations alone ( Supplementary Fig. 3A, B) . Next, we compared the expression level of E/E truncations with or without anchor C signal peptide by VSV vector. As shown in Fig. 1d , rVSV constructs with anchor C had more abundant expression of E/E truncations compared to ZIKV VLPs were negatively stained with 1% ammonium molybdate and visualized by a transmission electron microscope. rVSV-prM-E crude indicates a mixture of ZIKV VLPs and VSV virions from supernatant harvested from BSRT7 cells infected by rVSV-prM-E. ZIKV VLPs were further purified from rVSV-prM-E or rVSV-prM-E-NS1-infected cells. No VLPs were found in rVSV-E. ZIKV Cambodian strain was grown in Vero cells, purified, and used as a control. The yellow arrow indicates a VSV particle; white arrows indicate ZIKV VLPs; and yellow stars indicate ZIKV virions. g Kinetics of ZIKV-specific ELISA antibody induced by rVSV expressing ZIKV antigens. Groups of five female BALB/c mice were inoculated intranasally with a single dose (10 6 PFU) of rVSV or rVSV expressing ZIKV antigens. For DNA vaccine, mice were immunized intramuscularly with 50 \u00b5g of pCI-prM-E, and boosted with same dose two weeks later. Serum samples were collected weekly and analyzed by ELISA for ZIKV-specific serum IgG Ab. Data are expressed as the geometric mean titers (GMT) of five mice \u00b1 standard deviation. Western blots shown are the representatives of three independent experiments rVSV constructs without anchor C. E truncations were also detected in the supernatants of rVSV constructs with anchor C (Supplementary Fig. 3D ). However, full-length E protein was still not detectable by rVSV-aE, even though the anchor has been fused with E ( Supplementary Fig. 3D ). Thus, co-expression of anchor C and prM with the E/E truncations significantly increased their E expression and/or stability. These results also indicate that the prM, E, and NS1 proteins were proteolytically cleaved from the polyprotein and secreted into cell culture supernatants.",

BALB/c mice were inoculated intranasally with a single dose (10 6 PFU) of each recombinant virus. The DNA vaccine was used as a control. Briefly, mice were intramuscularly injected with 50 \u00b5g of pCI-prM-E and were boosted with same dose of pCI-prM-E two weeks later. Mice infected with rVSV exhibited severe clinical signs, including ataxia, hyperexcitability, and paralysis. At 7 days post-inoculation, two of the five mice were dead, and the remaining three mice were dead at day 10 post-inoculation. However, rVSVs expressing ZIKV antigens showed various degrees of attenuation. Mice inoculated with these recombinant viruses had mild clinical signs (such as a ruffled coat) and experienced body weight losses for 1 week, but started to gain weight by 10 days (Supplementary Fig. 6 ). Overall, rVSVs co-expressing prM and E/E truncation mutants were more attenuated in mice than rVSV expressing E/E truncation alone. For example, rVSV-prM-E and rVSV-prM-E414 had significantly less body weight loss compared to rVSV-E (P = 0.021, t-test) and rVSV-E414 (P = 0.045, t-test) respectively at day 7 post-inoculation. Recombinant rVSV-prM-E-NS1 was the most attenuated virus ( Supplementary Fig. 6 ). Mice inoculated with this virus experienced little or no weight loss and did not display any other clinical signs. This experiment demonstrated that rVSV expressing ZIKV antigens, particularly rVSV-prM-E-NS1, were significantly attenuated in mice compared to the parental rVSV.",

At 1 week post-inoculation, most (3 or 4 out of 5) mice inoculated with rVSV co-expressing prM-E/E truncation mutants had high levels of serum IgG against ZIKV E protein. At week 2 postinoculation, all mice in these groups had developed IgG Ab. Ab titers further increased and remained at a high level through week 5. In contrast, none of the mice vaccinated with rVSV expressing E/E truncation mutants without prM had detectable ZIKVspecific antibody by week 1. The same was true for rVSV-prM-E-NS1. At week 2, Ab was observed in these groups and increased through week 5. However, the Ab titers in these groups were significantly lower than those of the viruses co-expressing prM-E/ E truncation mutants (P < 0.05, t-test). Ab was not detectable in the DNA vaccine group until week 5, despite the fact that these mice had been given two doses (at week 0 and 2). The Ab detected in the DNA vaccine group at week 5 post-immunization was also lower than that induced by the rVSV-prM-E/E truncations. These results demonstrate that a single-dose inoculation of mice with rVSV co-expressing prM-E/E truncations triggered high levels of serum antibody response as early as 1-2 weeks post-inoculation.",

We previously showed that a single point mutation (G1670A) in the S-Adenosyl methionine (SAM) binding site in the MTase region of the large (L) polymerase protein resulted in a recombinant virus (rVSV-G1670A) that was defective in mRNA cap guanine-N-7 methylation but not ribose 2\u2032-O methylation 45 . Compared to rVSV, this recombinant virus was highly attenuated in cell culture as well as in mice 45, 46 . The G1670A mutation was introduced into VSV backbone to generate rVSV-G1670A-E, rVSV-G1670A-aE, rVSV-G1670A-prM-E, and rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-NS1, respectively ( Supplementary  Fig. 7A ). The plaque diameters of rVSV-G1670A-E, rVSV-G1670A-aE, rVSV-G1670A-prM-E, and rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-NS1 were 1.64 \u00b1 0.08, 1.68 \u00b1 0.10, 1.73 \u00b1 0.11, and 0.85 \u00b1 0.12 mm respectively, significantly smaller than the recombinant viruses derived from the wild-type VSV backbone (Compare Supplementary Fig. 7B, Fig. 1b) . Single-step replication curves showed that VSV-G1670A-E, VSV-G1670A-aE, and rVSV-G1670A-prM-E had replication kinetics similar to rVSV-G1670A, whereas rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-NS1 had a significant delay (P = 5.82 \u00d7 10 9 and 0.0021 at time points 12 and 24 h respectively, t-test) (Fig. 2a) . At 24 h post-infection, the expression of E can be ranked rVSV-G1670A-prM-E > rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-NS1 > rVSV-G1670A-aE (Fig. 2b) . No E protein expression was detected from rVSV-G1670A or rVSV-G1670A-E, but NS1 protein expression was detected from rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-NS1 (Fig. 2b) . In a kinetic experiment, E protein expression was maximal from rVSV-G1670A-aE and rVSV-G1670A-prM-E at 12 and 36 h respectively, but was delayed in rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-NS1infected cells (Fig. 2c) . Similarly, E and NS1 proteins were secreted into cell culture medium in virus-infected cells (Fig. 2d , e, and Supplementary Fig. 8 ). Compared to the parental rVSV vector, E protein expression was delayed from the rVSV-G1670A vector (Fig. 2d , compare upper and lower panels), suggesting that the rVSV-G1670A vector was more attenuated. These results demonstrated that ZIKV E and NS1 proteins were highly expressed by MTase-defective rVSV.",

These results indicate that co-expression of NS1 enhances IFN-\u03b3, but inhibits production of TNF-\u03b1 by T helper cells. Th2 cells produce an array of cytokines, which support the production of Abs more likely to protect against extracellular pathogens such as viruses. Interleukin 21, the signature product of follicular T helper cells (Tfh) and IL-17A the product of Th17 cells facilitate antibody production and affinity maturation. Both rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-NS1 and rVSV-G1670A-prM-E induced a similar level of CD4 + IL-4 + , a Th2 cytokine (P > 0.05, t-test) in spleen cells after in vitro restimulation with ZIKV E protein (Fig. 3c) . However, rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-NS1 induced significantly higher CD4 + IL-5 + and CD4 + IL-10 + , the other two Th2 cytokines (P < 0.05, t-test). Interestingly, rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-NS1 also induced a significantly higher Th17 response (CD4 + IL-17A + ) than rVSV-G1670A-prM-E (P < 0.001, t-test) (Fig. 3d ). In addition, ZIKV E-specific Tfh cells (CD4 + IL-21 + ) were produced at similar levels in rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-NS1 and rVSV-G1670A-prM-E inoculated mice (P > 0.05, t-test) (Fig. 3e) . These results demonstrated that mtdVSV-based vaccines triggered ZIKV-specific T cell responses and that co-expression of NS1 enhances Th2 and Th17 responses. In addition, the fact that coexpression of NS1 enhances IFN-\u03b3 suggests that NS1 modulated the Th1 response (Fig. 3b) . Collectively, our results suggest that the presence of NS1 leads to a more balanced response including Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells.",

DNA vaccine (pCI-prM-E) was used as a control and was given intramuscularly twice (at week 0 and 2). Similar to the previous observation shown in Fig. 2f , rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-NS1 was the most attenuated virus, experiencing no weight losses ( Supplementary Fig. 9 ). All other recombinant viruses showed 9-15% weight loss at early time points but weights were recovered at day 14 ( Supplementary Fig. 9 ). Previously, it was shown that the administration of anti-IFNAR1 antibody can render BALB/c mice more susceptible to infection of a mouse-adapted African ZIKV strain (Dakar 41519) 18 . Similarly, we passively transferred 1.8 mg of a blocking antibody, anti-IFNAR1, to each mouse 24 h prior to intravenous challenge with the ZIKV Cambodian strain. After ZIKV challenge, mice were monitored for 4 weeks. Unexpectedly, no significant weight loss or clinical symptoms were observed in any group including the unvaccinated but challenged controls ( Supplementary Fig. 10 ).",

For the unvaccinated challenged controls, the peak of viremia was observed at day 3, declined by days 7 and 10, and cleared by day 14 (Fig. 4a) . This was consistent with previous observations that ZIKV only causes transient viremia in BALB/c mice 17, 30 . Similarly, mice in the rVSV-G1670A and rVSV-G1670A-E groups developed viremia, shedding an average of 3.7 logs of ZIKV PFU equivalent RNA/ml in blood samples collected at day 3 post-challenge (Fig. 4a) . In contrast, viremia in most mice vaccinated with rVSV-G1670A-prM-E, rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-NS1, and pCI-prM-E groups were under the detection limit at day 3 (3 and 4 mice in rVSV-G1670A-prM-E and rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-NS1 had near detection limit level of viremia, respectively, and 1 mice in pCI-prM-E group had a high level of viremia) (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. 11 ). In addition, viremia was under detection limit from days 7 to 24 in these groups (Fig. 4a) . Collectively, these data show that a single dose vaccination of mtdVSV-based vaccines provides protection against ZIKV-induced viremia in BALB/c mice. To determine whether VSV was persistent in the vaccinated mice, brain tissues were collected at the termination of the study for detection of VSV. No infectious VSV was detected by plaque assay in any brain tissues in any group. However, 4-5 log VSV RNAs were detected in the brains of the rVSV-G1670A, rVSV-G1670A-E, and rVSV-G1670A-prM-E groups (Fig. 4b) . In contrast, nearly no VSV RNA was detected in the rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-NS1 group (Fig. 4b) . Therefore, rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-NS1 is the most attenuated of these viruses.",

Recombinant rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-NS1 and rVSV-G1670A-aE had no body weight loss whereas rVSV-G1670A-prM-E had approximately 4.2% body weight loss at day 7 ( Supplementary Fig. 12) . High E-specific antibodies were observed in all animals vaccinated with rVSV-G1670A-prM-E or rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-NS1 at day 28 and further increased at day 35 post-vaccination (Fig. 4c ). Only 1 out of 5 animals vaccinated with rVSV-G1670A-aE developed Especific antibodies from day 7 to 28, and all animals developed Especific antibodies at day 35 (Fig. 4c ). NS1-specific antibodies were only detected in rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-NS1 group (Fig. 4d) . Upon ZIKV challenge, mice did not exhibit body weight loss ( Supplementary Fig. 13 ). Mice vaccinated with rVSV-G1670A-prM-E and rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-NS1 were protected from viremia at days 3 ( mtdVSV-based vaccine provides complete protection in A129 mice. Finally, we assessed the protective effect of mtdVSV-based ZIKV vaccines in A129 mice which lack the type-I interferon receptor (IFNAR). These mice have been shown to be highly permissive for both ZIKV 47, 48 and VSV infection 49, 50 . In fact, A129 mice are so susceptible to wild-type VSV infection that a dose of 50 PFU is lethal 50 . To reduce side effects, an intramuscular route was used for VSV vaccination. Since mtdVSV-based vaccines were significantly attenuated, we chose a dose of 10 5 PFU for vaccination which was 2000 times higher than the wildtype VSV lethal dose. Briefly, A129 mice were immunized intramuscularly with rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-NS1, rVSV-G1670A-prM-E, or rVSV-prM-E-NS1, and the safety and antibody response were monitored. We found that rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-NS1 was completely attenuated in A129 mice, exhibiting no body weight losses or any abnormal reactions (Fig. 5a) . However, rVSV-prM-E-NS1, which lacks the VSV attenuating mutation, was virulent in A129 mice, causing 2 deaths at day 7, and morbidity by day 10 that required termination of the others. Mice immunized with rVSV-G1670A-prM-E lost 20% of their weight but recovered and remained healthy. As shown in Fig. 5b -g, all mice in rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-NS1 and rVSV-G1670A-prM-E groups developed high levels of antibody, detected by ELISA (Fig. 5b, c) and by neutralization assay (Fig. 5d , e) as early as week 1 post-vaccination. Ab titers remained high at week 3 (Fig. 5c, e) . In addition, high levels of NS1-specific Ab were detected at weeks 1 and 3 in the rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-NS1 group (Fig. 5f, g) . At week 4 post-immunization, each group was intraperitoneally challenged with 10 5 PFU of the ZIKV Cambodian strain. Mice in the control, unvaccinated challenged group (immunized with the . 6a) and had severe body weight loss (Fig. 6b) . Because of the severity of disease in the pCI control group, these mice were terminated at day 7. In contrast, mice vaccinated with either rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-NS1 or rVSV-G1670A-prM-E did not exhibit any weight loss (Fig. 6b) or ZIKV associated clinical symptoms (Fig. 6a) . ZIKV viremia was measured at days 3 and 7 post-challenge by real-time RT-PCR (Fig. 7a, b ). An average of 5.8 log PFU equivalents of ZIKV was detected in the pCI control group at day 3. Low ZIKV PFU equivalents were detected at day 3 in the rVSV-G1670A-prM-E group but none in the rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-NS1 group. At day 7, high levels of ZIKV were detected in the blood of the pCI control group, whereas no or very low ZIKV was found in rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-NS1 and rVSV-G1670A-prM-E groups. Similarly, high levels of ZIKV were detected in the brain, uterus, lung, and spleen of the pCI control group whereas under or near detection limit level of ZIKV RNA was found in these organs in the rVSV-G1670A-prM-E and rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-NS1 groups (Fig. 7c-f ). In addition, histologic analysis of brain tissues showed that rVSV-G1670A-prM-E and rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-NS1 had completely protected the mice from ZIKV-induced encephalitis (Fig. 7g) . In contrast, severe encephalitis characterized by neuronal necrosis, gliosis, neuronal satellitosis and neuronophagia with lymphocytic perivascular cuffing was found in the control group (Fig. 7g) . The brain tissues were used for the detection of VSV RNA. It was found that VSV RNA was not detectable or near the detection limit in A129 mice vaccinated with rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-NS1 whereas After challenge, blood samples were collected at the indicated time until day 24 and the presence of ZIKV RNA was quantitated by real-time RT-PCR and calculated to PFU equivalent RNA/ml. Data were expressed as GMT of 10 mice \u00b1 standard deviation. b Quantification of VSV RNA in BALB/c mice. Brains were harvested at the termination of the study.

Significance was calculated using t-test. N.S. indicates not significant approximately 6 log of VSV RNA were detected in rVSV-G1670A-prM-E group (Fig. 5h) , suggesting that rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-NS1 was significantly more attenuated than rVSV-G1670A-prM-E. These data demonstrate that a single low dose of mtdVSV-based vaccines provides complete protection against ZIKV challenge in A129 mice.",

Both pCI-prM-E and pCI-NS1 expressed their intended proteins, E and NS1, in transfected 293T cells (Supplementary Fig. 14) . A129 mice were vaccinated intramuscularly with pCI-prM-E or pCI-NS1, and boosted with the same plasmid two weeks later.

In addition, we showed for the first time that NS1 protein modulates ZIKV-specific T cell immune responses and that NS1 alone conferred partial protection against ZIKV-induced viremia in BALB/c mice and lethal ZIKV challenge in A129 mice in the absence of a neutralizing antibody response.

            "text": "Although it was recently reported that rVSV with mutated matrix protein expressing prM-E was capable of generating maternal antibody that can protect offspring from ZIKV infection 42 , it is not known whether immunized animals can be directly protected from ZIKV challenge. In our study, we systematically screened the immunogenicity of rVSVs expressing a variety of ZIKV antigens including E, E truncations, aE, aE truncations, prM-E, prM-E truncations, prM-E-NS1, and NS1. To our knowledge, this is first time to utilize co-expression of NS1 with prM-E as potential antigens in vectored ZIKV vaccine candidates. In addition, we used viral MTase as a novel approach to attenuate VSV for delivering ZIKV vaccine. We demonstrated that a single immunization (IN or IM) with mtdVSV-based vaccine triggered high levels of ZIKV-specific Ab and T cell immune responses and provided complete protection against ZIKV challenges in both BALB/c and highly sensitive A129 mice. In contrast, DNA vaccine requires high doses and multiple booster vaccination, and antibody was undetectable in both BALB/c and A129 mice at early time points (Figs. 1, 5 , and Supplementary Table 1 ). Our results suggest that the efficacy of this VSV-based vaccine is much higher than a DNA vaccine. A VSV-based vaccine offers many other advantages, including genetic stability, expression of multiple antigens, low cost, simplicity of production, multiple routes of administration, and ease of manipulation. During the Ebola virus outbreaks in Africa in 2013-2016, VSV-based vaccine (rVSV-EBOV) was successfully used in humans and was found to be safe and efficacious [38] [39] [40] [41] . In addition, several other VSV-based vaccine candidates and oncolytic agents are being tested in human clinical trials. It is likely that more analysis of the safety and efficacy of VSV as a vector in humans will be forthcoming soon, which will facilitate the use of VSV-based vaccines in mass vaccination in the future. We found that ZIKV NS1 alone can induce partial protection against ZIKV challenge. In BALB/c mice, both rVSV-G1670A-NS1 and pCI-NS1 provided substantial protection against viremia in the absence of neutralizing antibody. Overall, the protective efficacy of mtdVSV-based NS1 vaccine (rVSV-G1670A-NS1) was higher than the DNA vaccine (pCI-NS1) approach. The partial protection of pCI-NS1 against lethal ZIKV challenge was also observed in A129 mice. Overall, the disease severity, viremia, and virus burden in pCI-NS1 vaccinated group were significantly lower than the pCI control group in A129 mice (P < 0.05), t-test (Figs. 6, 7) . The flavivirus NS1 is a nonstructural glycoprotein that is essential for viral replication and immune evasion. Previously, it was shown that immunization with purified NS1 and recombinant NS1 or passive administration of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against NS1 can protect mice against lethal infection by WNV, JEV, DENV, and YFV 23, 25, 44, 59, 60 . In addition, vaccination with DENV1, DENV3, or DENV4 NS1 provided substantial cross protection against a heterologous DENV2 lethal challenge 3 study did not evaluate the efficacy of MVA-ZIKV-NS1 in A129 mice which is more highly sensitive to ZIKV infection. The finding that NS1 conferred partial protection against ZIKV infection highlights an alternative strategy to design ZIKV vaccine. Current efforts on development of ZIKV subunit vaccines have been exclusively focused on prM and E proteins which rely on generating high levels of neutralizing Ab. However, it has been reported that anti-flavivirus Abs are cross-reactive with other species of flavivirus which may facilitate ZIKV infection through the antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) mechanism 62-64 . Since NS1 is absent in the virion, Ab against NS1 will not neutralize ZIKV, but it may provide an alternative antigen for vaccine development because it avoids the potential risk of disease enhancement [65] [66] [67] .",

The expression of E protein from prM-E-NS1 constructs (both rVSV and rVSV-G1670A vector) was delayed compared to the prM-E constructs, which was probably due to the difference in size of the polyprotein and proteolytic cleavage of the polyprotein. Importantly, rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-NS1 induced significantly higher Th2 cytokines (CD4 + IL-5 + and CD4 + IL-10 + ) and Th17 response (CD4 + IL-17A + ) than rVSV-G1670A-prM-E (P < 0.05, t-test). This suggests that co-expression of NS1 regulated ZIKV-specific T cell immune response which is critical for virus clearance 68, 69 . Another advantage of rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-NS1 is that it triggered a high level of NS1 antibody which may contribute to protection, perhaps through Fc receptor dependent mechanism. In fact, the viremia in rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-NS1 was statistically lower than rVSV-G1670A-prM-E (P = 0.0236, t-test) at day 3 post-challenge in A129 mice (Fig. 7a) , suggesting that rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-NS1 may have a greater protective efficacy. Either the higher T cell immune response or the NS1 Ab could contribute to the enhanced protection against ZIKV infection.",

In this study, we utilized MTase as a novel approach to attenuate VSV, since mRNA cap methylation will diminish viral protein translation which in turn would diminish viral replication 45, 46, 70 . We chose rVSV carrying a single point mutation in the SAM binding site (rVSV-G1670A) as a backbone which was specifically defective in G-N-7 but not 2\u2032-O methylation 45 . If necessary, we can choose mutations (such as K1651A and D1762A) in MTase active site lacking both G-N-7 and 2\u2032-O methylation, which will further enhance the safety of the VSV vector 46, 70 . We showed that recombinant rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-NS1 and rVSV-G1670A-prM-E were significantly more attenuated in mice than wild type expressing the same ZIKV genes. Particularly, a dose of 10 5 PFU of rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-NS1 was completely attenuated in A129 mice whereas rVSV-prM-E-NS1 still caused mortality.

CRL-3216) were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). BSRT7 cells (kindly provided by Sean Whelan), which stably express T7 RNA polymerase, are clones of BHK-21 cells. All cell lines were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% FBS. ZIKV Cambodian strain (FSS13025) was provided by the World Reference Center for Emerging Viruses and Arboviruses (University of Texas Medical Branch), propagated in Vero cells, and titrated using a standard plaque assay 71 . Plasmids encoding VSV N (pN), P (pP), and L (pL) genes, and an infectious cDNA clone of the viral genome, pVSV1(+), were generous gifts from Gail Wertz 72 . Plasmid pVSV1(+) GxxL, which contains SmaI and XhoI at the G and L gene junction, was kindly provided by Sean Whelan. The full-length envelope (E) gene (from amino acids 1-504) and E truncation mutants [E404 (amino acids 1-404); E414 (amino acid 1-414), and E415 (amino acid 1-415)] lacking the predicted stem-transmembrane domain (TM) were amplified from an infectious cDNA clone of ZIKV Cambodian strain (GenBank accession no. MH158236) by high fidelity PCR. These DNA fragments were digested with SmaI and XhoI and cloned into pVSV(+)GxxL at the same sites. The resulting plasmids were designated pVSV(+)-E, pVSV(+)-E404, pVSV(+)-E414, and pVSV(+)-E415. Using the same strategy, the anchor C (signal peptide) with E, E404, E414, and E415 were cloned into pVSV(+)GxxL at SmaI and XhoI sites resulted in construction of pVSV(+)-aE, pVSV(+)-aE404, pVSV (+)-aE414, and pVSV(+)-aE415 respectively. In addition, the anchor Cpremembrane-envelope (prM-E), and anchor C-prM-E truncation mutants (prM-E404, prM-E414, and prM-E415), and anchor C-premembrane-envelopenonstructural protein 1 (prM-E-NS1) genes were cloned into pVSV(+)GxxL at SmaI and XhoI sites. The resulting plasmids were designated pVSV(+)-prM-E, pVSV(+)-prM-E404, pVSV(+)-prM-E414, pVSV(+)-prM-E,415, and pVSV (+)-prM-E-NS1. Similarly, the anchor C-NS1 gene (amino acids 1-352) was cloned into pVSV(+)GxxL at the SmaI and XhoI sites, and the resultant plasmid was named pVSV(+)-NS1. To further attenuate the VSV vector, we took advantage of a point mutation, G1670A, in the large (L) polymerase protein, which rendered a recombinant virus that is specifically defective in mRNA cap G-N-7, but not 2\u2032-O methylation. Using site-directed mutagenesis, G1670A mutation was introduced into pVSV(+)-E, pVSV(+)-aE, pVSV(+)-prM-E, pVSV(+)-prM-E-NS1, and pVSV(+)-NS1 which resulted in the construction of pVSV(+)-G1670A-E, pVSV (+)-G1670A-aE, pVSV(+)-G1670A-prM-E, pVSV(+)-G1670A-prM-E-NS1, and pVSV(+)-G1670A-NS1 respectively. To prepare DNA vaccine plasmids, the anchor C-prM-E and anchor C-NS1 genes were cloned into pCI vector (Promega) which resulted in the construction of pCI-prM-E and pCI-NS1 respectively. All of the constructs were confirmed by sequencing.",

All mice were housed within ULAR facilities of The Ohio State University under approved Institutional Laboratory Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) guidelines (protocol no. 2009A0160). Each inoculation group was separately housed in rodent cages under biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) conditions. Experiment 1: determine whether VSV constructs are immunogenic in BALB/c mice. Sixty 4 to 6-week-old specific-pathogen-free female BALB/c mice (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) were randomly divided into 12 groups (5 mice per group). Mice in group 1 were inoculated with parental rVSV (with no insertion). Mice in groups 2-10 were inoculated with nine different rVSVs expressing ZIKV antigens (rVSV-E404, rVSV-E414, rVSV-E415, rVSV-E, rVSV-prM-E404, rVSV-prM-E414, rVSV-prM-E415, rVSV-prM-E, and rVSV-prM-E-NS1). Mice in group 11 were inoculated with DMEM and served as uninfected controls (the normal control). Mice in group 12 were immunized with DNA vaccine pCI-prM-E. For VSV, each mouse was inoculated intranasally at a dose of 1 \u00d7 10 6 PFU in a volume of 50 \u00b5l. For DNA vaccine, mice were immunized intramuscularly with 50 \u00b5g of pCI-prM-E, and boosted with same dose two weeks later. After inoculation, the animals were evaluated twice every day for mortality and the presence of any symptoms of VSV infection. The severity of clinical signs associated with VSV infection was scored based on the following criteria: grade 3 (severe) was characterized by ruffled fur, hyperexcitability, tremors, circling, and paralysis; grade 2 (moderate) was characterized by ruffled fur with neurological symptoms such as circling; grade 1 (mild) was characterized by ruffled fur but no neurological symptoms; grade 0 was defined as no symptoms. The body weight of each mouse was monitored every three days. Blood samples were collected from each mouse weekly by bleeding facial vein, and serum was isolated for antibody detection. At week 5 post-inoculation, all mice were euthanized. Experiment 2: determine antibody and T cell immune responses triggered by mtdVSV in BALB/c mice. Thirty 6-week-old SPF female BALB/c mice (Charles River Laboratories) were randomly divided into six groups (5 mice per group). Mice in group 1 were inoculated with DMEM and served as unimmunized controls (normal control). Mice in groups 2-6 were immunized with rVSV, rVSV-G1670A, rVSV-G1670A-E, rVSV-G1670A-prM-E, and rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-NS1. All mice were immunized intranasally at a dose of 1 \u00d7 10 6 PFU per mouse. After immunization, the animals were evaluated daily for body weight, mortality, and the presence of any symptoms of VSV infection. Blood samples were collected from each mouse weekly by bleeding facial vein, and serum was isolated for antibody detection. At week 5 post-inoculation, all mice were euthanized, and whole blood and spleens were isolated from each mouse for a T cell assay. Experiment 3: determine whether mtdVSV vaccine can protect BALB/c mice against viremia until day 24 after ZIKV challenge. Seventy 4-week-old SPF BALB/c mice (Charles River Laboratories) were randomly divided into 7 groups (10 per group, 5 female and 5 male). Mice in groups 1-5 were immunized with DMEM, rVSV-G1670A, rVSV-G1670A-E, rVSV-G1670A-prM-E, or rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-NS1. Mice in group 6 were immunized with DNA vaccine. Mice in group 7 were served as normal control (immunized with DMEM and unchallenged). For VSV, mice were inoculated intranasally at a dose of 1 \u00d7 10 6 PFU per mouse. For DNA vaccine, mice were immunized intramuscularly with 50 \u00b5g of pCI-prM-E, and boosted with same dose 2 weeks later. After immunization, the presence of any VSV symptom induced by mtdVSV-based ZIKV vaccine candidates was evaluated twice a day. At week 5 post-immunization, mice in groups 1-6 were challenged intravenously with ZIKV Cambodian strain at a dose of 1 \u00d7 10 6 PFU per mouse. At 24 h prior to ZIKV challenge, mice were intraperitoneally administered 1.8 mg of anti-IFNAR1 (Leinco Technologies, Fenton, MO) blocking antibody. After challenge, the animals were evaluated twice daily for mortality and the presence of any symptoms of ZIKV infection. The body weight for each mouse was monitored daily. At day 24 post-challenge, all mice from each group were euthanized. The blood, brain, lungs, liver, and spleen from each mouse were collected for virus quantification and histologic evaluation. Experiment 4: determine whether mtdVSV vaccine can protect BALB/c mice against viremia until day 7 post-challenge. Mice (6-week-old) in groups 1-5 were immunized with saline, rVSV-G1670A, rVSV-G1670A-aE, rVSV-G1670A-prM-E, or rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-NS1. The mice in group 6 served as a normal control (unimmunized unchallenged). The experimental procedure was identical to Experiment 3 except the mice were euthanized at day 7 after challenge with ZIKV Cambodian strain. Experiment 5: determine whether mtdVSV vaccine and DNA vaccine can protect A129 mice against ZIKV challenge. Thirty five 6-week-old female A129 mice (Jackson Laboratories) were randomly divided into 7 groups (5 per group). Mice in groups 1-3 were immunized intramuscularly with pCI, pCI-prM-E, or pCI-NS1 at a dose of 50 \u00b5g DNA per mouse. Two weeks later, mice in groups 1-3 were boosted intramuscularly with the same plasmid at the same dose. Mice in groups 4-6 were administered intramuscularly using a single dose (1 \u00d7 10 5 PFU per mouse) of rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-NS1, rVSV-prM-E-NS1, or rVSV-G1670A-prM-E. Mice in group 7 were served as unvaccinated unchallenged control. After immunization, mice were evaluated every three days for body weight. The safety of mtdVSV-based ZIKV vaccine candidates was evaluated twice a day. Blood samples were collected at week 1 and 3 from each mouse for detection of antibody. At week 4 post-immunization, mice in groups 1-6 were intraperitoneally challenged with ZIKV Cambodian strain at a dose of 1 \u00d7 10 5 PFU per mouse. After challenge, the animals were evaluated twice every day for mortality and the presence of any symptoms of ZIKV infection. The severity of clinical disease was scored based the following criteria: 1 = heathy; 2 = mild; 3 = moderate; and 4 = severe, and early removal is required. The body weight for each mouse was monitored daily. Blood was collected at days 3 and 7 for the detection of viremia. At day 7 post-challenge, all mice from each group were euthanized, and brain, lungs, uterus/ovary, and spleen from each mouse were collected for virus quantification and histologic evaluation. Experiment 6: determine whether NS1 alone can protect BALB/c mice against viremia. Twenty five 4-week-old female BALB/c mice were randomly divided into 5 groups (5 per group). Mice in groups 1-5 were immunized with DMEM, pCI, pCI-NS1, rVSV-G1670A-NS1, or rVSV-G1670A-prM-E. For VSV, mice were inoculated intranasally at a dose of 1 \u00d7 10 6 PFU per mouse. For DNA vaccine, mice were immunized intramuscularly with 50 \u00b5g of plasmid, and boosted with same dose two weeks later. At week 4 post-immunization, mice in groups 2-6 were intravenously challenged with ZIKV Cambodian strain at a dose of 1 \u00d7 10 6 PFU per mouse. At 24 h prior to ZIKV challenge, mice were intraperitoneally administered 1.8 mg of anti-IFNAR1 (Leinco Technologies) blocking antibody. At days 3 and 7 post-challenge, blood was collected from each mouse for detection of viremia by real-time RT-PCR. Experiment 7: validate the safety and immunogenicity of rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-NS1 in A129 mice. There were three groups in this study. Mice in group 1 were immunized intramuscularly with a single dose (1 \u00d7 10 5 PFU per mouse) of rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-NS1. Mice in groups 2 and 3 were served as unimmunized challenged control and normal control (unimmunized unchallenged). Blood was collected from each mouse weekly for antibody detection. At week 4, mice in groups 1 and 2 were intraperitoneally challenged with ZIKV Cambodian strain at a dose of 1 \u00d7 10 5 PFU per mouse. After challenge, mice were monitored for body weight changes and viremia every 1 or 3 days for 21 days.",

Organs were weighed and homogenized using a bead-beater apparatus (MagNA Lyser, Roche). The total RNA was extracted from tissue samples and blood by using TRIzol Reagent (Life technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Reverse transcription (RT) was conducted using a primer (5\u2032-CTCGTCTCTTCTTCTCCTTCCTAGCATTGA-3\u2032) targeting the capsid (C) gene of ZIKV and the Superscript III transcriptase kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The RT products were then used to perform real-time PCR using primers specifically targeting the E gene of ZIKV (forward, 5\u2032-CATCAGGATGGTCT TGGCGATTCTAGC-3\u2032; reverse, 5\u2032-CTCGTCTCTTCTTCTCCTTCCTAGCATT GA-3\u2032) in a StepOne real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). A standard curve was generated using a serial dilution of ZIKV RNA extracted from known PFU titer of infectious virus. Amplification cycles used were 2 min at 50\u00b0C, 10 min at 95\u00b0C, and 40 cycles of 15 s at 95\u00b0C and 1 min at 60\u00b0C. The threshold for detection of fluorescence above the background was set within the exponential phase of the amplification curves. For each assay, 10-fold dilutions of standard viral RNA were generated, and negative-control samples and double-distilled water (ddH 2 O) were included in each assay. Viral burden is expressed on a log10 scale as viral RNA equivalents per gram or per milliliter. Similarly, total RNA from brain tissues was used for quantification of VSV RNA using primers annealing to the VSV L gene and shown as RNA copies per gram, using a plasmid encoding VSV genome as a standard curve.",
