            "text": "Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major global health problem. Currently-available therapies are ineffective in curing chronic HBV infection. HBV and its satellite hepatitis D virus (HDV) infect hepatocytes via binding of the preS1 domain of its large envelope protein to sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP). Here, we developed novel human monoclonal antibodies that block the engagement of preS1 with NTCP and neutralize HBV and HDV with high potency. One antibody, 2H5-A14, functions at picomolar level and exhibited neutralization-activitymediated prophylactic effects. It also acts therapeutically by eliciting antibody-Fc-dependent immunological effector functions that impose durable suppression of viral infection in HBV-infected mice, resulting in reductions in the levels of the small envelope antigen and viral DNA, with no emergence of escape mutants. Our results illustrate a novel antibody-Fc-dependent approach for HBV treatment and suggest 2H5-A14 as a novel clinical candidate for HBV prevention and treatment of chronic HBV infection.",

Despite the fact that there is an effective prophylactic HBV vaccine, 240 million people are chronically infected. HBV carriers are at high risk of developing severe liver diseases ranging from chronic hepatic insufficiency to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (World Health Organization, 2016; Schweitzer et al., 2015) . Current therapies are inadequate for treating chronic HBV infection. For example, the immune-modulatory interferon alpha therapies have a curative effect in a small portion of patients; nucleos(t)ide analog (NUC) therapies can suppress viral replication but hardly achieve sustained virological control after treatment withdrawal and are non-curative (Lok et al., 2016) . An additional problem involves co-infection with Hepatitis D virus (HDV), which is a satellite virus that propagates only in the presence of HBV. Approximately 15 million of HBV carriers are co-infected with HDV, which accelerates disease progression and exacerbates disease severity. No effective therapies are currently available for HBV patients co-infected with HDV, and there are no anti-viral therapies that specifically target HDV (Rizzetto, 2015; Hughes et al., 2011; Thomas et al., 2015) .",

For example, just as with cancer cells, virus-infected cells can be eliminated by antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and phagocytosis (ADCP) through interaction of the Fc (fragment crystallizable domain) of an antibody with its cognate Fcg receptors (FcgRs) expressed on immune cells. Therefore, although the results from other immune-based therapies in treating HBV have so far been disappointing , novel nAb-based immunotherapy may represent a new modality for curing chronic HBV infection.",

One of the lead nAbs, 2H5, showed strong neutralizing ability against both HDV and HBV. We used crystallographic studies to identify the 2H5 epitope, and sequence analysis predicted that this epitope is highly conserved in eight of the ten HBV genotypes. Neutralization-oriented optimization of the lead nAb by antibody engineering resulted in a more potent anti-preS1 nAb, 2H5-A14, with picomolar neutralizing activity against the major epidemic genotypes of HBV (B, C, and D) . Importantly, 2H5-A14 demonstrated ADCC activity through natural killer (NK) cells and through macrophages, and ADCP activity through macrophages in vitro. In animal studies, the prophylactic use of 2H5-A14 resulted in full protection of humanized mice from HDV and HBV infection. Moreover, 2H5-A14 greatly reduced HBV infection in a treatment mouse model. Studies with 2H5-A14 Fc mutant in the animals revealed that Fc-mediated immune effector functions are largely responsible for the therapeutic effect of 2H5-A14.",

By employing HepG2-hNTCP cell-based in vitro HBV infection systems , we identified six nAbs that were effective in neutralizaling HBV, but each differed in its potency ( Figure 1A) . Epitope mapping by direct binding and competition ELISA assays showed that these nAbs recognized four unique epitopes, represented by #71, 2H5, m1Q (mge) in the presence of the tested Abs. The secreted HBeAg and HBsAg levels in sample supernatants were measured at 7 days post infection (dpi). The HBV neutralization activity is here presented as the percentage of inhibition of secreted HBeAg and HBsAg, which was calculated by normalizing the 'infection only' reading to 0% inhibition. (B) Neutralization of HDV infection in HepG2-hNTCP cells by 2H5 and m1Q. The cells were infected with 500 mge of HDV in the presence of the test nAbs or matched isotype control Ab. At dpi 7, HDV delta antigens were stained with FITC-conjugated mAb, 4G5; the cell nuclei were stained with DAPI.

Carbon atoms are colored in cyan for VH of 2H5, magenta for VL of 2H5 and yellow for the preS1 peptide. Oxygen atoms are colored in red and nitrogen atoms are colored in blue. (D) Interaction between 2H5 and preS1. 2H5 is shown in ribbon and the preS1 epitope and selected CDR side chains are shown in sticks. This view is perpendicular to panel C. Dotted lines denote hydrogen bonds. (E) Surface view of the peptide binding pocket of 2H5. Same color-coding and orientation as panel D. (F) 2H5 protected hNTCP-Tg mice from HDV infection. Human NTCP-Tg homozygotes (C57BL/6 background) were IP administered 2H5 (20 mg/kg; n = 5) or PBS control (n = 2) at 8 days after birth. One hour later, each mouse was challenged with 1.47 \u00c2 10 10 genome equivalents (GE) of HDV. The mice were sacrificed at dpi 6. HDV total RNA titers (on the left Y-axis) and hNTCP transgene expression (on the right Y-axis) in liver tissues were measured by qPCR. The horizontal dotted line indicates the reliable Figure 1 continued on next page and #15, respectively (Figure 1-figure supplements 1 and 2A-C). The neutralization potency of these nAbs correlated with the location of their epitopes in relation to the receptor binding site (RBS) in preS1. The epitopes of 2H5 and m1Q are more closer to the C-terminus of RBS, and showed more potent neutralization activity compared to the other two nAbs, including #71, with its epitope close to the N-terminus of RBS that only recognizes non-myristoylated preS1 peptides, and #15, with its epitope distant from the C-terminus of RBS, although all four of these nAbs had similar preS1 binding activity. 2H5 and m1Q were also able to neutralize HDV infection in HepG2-hNTCP cells ( Figure 1B ). As 2H5 was slightly more potent in neutralizing HBV and HDV than m1Q, we selected 2H5 for further characterization and optimization.",

In the complex structure, residues 20-27 of the 59C peptide showing well-ordered electron density were modeled. The 8-residue peptide adopts a U-shaped conformation and is situated in a pocket formed by five complementarity-determining-region (CDR) loops from both the variable heavy (VH) and light chains (VL) of 2H5 ( Figure 1C -E).

All of the eight modeled residues except Gly 24 of preS1 interact directly with 2H5. On the buried surface of preS1, which is mainly involved in heavy chain interaction, the Asp 20 residue has an electrostatic interaction with Arg 55 in the HCDR2 loop. Additionally, Arg 59 of the HCDR2 loop forms a hydrogen bond with the main-chain carbonyl oxygen of Ala 22 from preS1.

Using this model, prophylactic administration of 2H5 IgG1 (1 hr before HDV viral challenge) resulted in a more than one log reduction of the viral titer in mouse livers as compared to untreated controls ( Figure 1F ). Nevertheless, 2H5 treatment was not able to completely block HDV infection in mouse livers, even at a 20 mg/kg dose. Thus, increasing the neutralization activity of 2H5 while preserving its conserved epitope were needed to yield a potent and broadly-neutralizing antibody with improved in vivo efficacy.",

            "text": "To this end, we employed various antibody engineering approaches including chain shuffling, structure-guided design, and CDR-focused mutagenesis. The VH chain shuffling approach was most fruitful in identifying improved anti-preS1 nAbs. VH chain shuffling by fixing the variable light (VL) chain of 2H5 and pairing it with a repertoire of naturally-occurring variable heavy (VH) genes (~1\u00c210 10 ) led to the identification of 16 Abs with higher binding affinity. HBV and HDV neutralizing assays were then performed to rank the neutralizing ability of these 16 Abs relative to that of 2H5 ( 2H5-A14 is a potent and broadly-neutralizing nAb against HBV infection that acts by blocking the binding of preS1 with the HBV receptor NTCP Competition ELISA assays showed that 2H5-A14 had almost the same peptide competition pattern as did 2H5, and mutation of G24R of preS1 did not affect 2H5-A14 binding activity, indicating that 2H5-A14 targets the same epitope as does 2H5 (Figure 2-figure supplement 4) . This epitope is in close proximity to, but does not overlap, the receptor NTCP-binding site of preS1 (Figure 1-figure supplement 1). To test whether the neutralization activity of 2H5-A14 can be attributed to competition with preS1 for binding with NTCP, we used a stable HepG2-hNTCP cell clone that expresses a high level of hNTCP and supports the binding of a fluorescent-labeled preS1 peptide. An immunofluorescence staining assay showed that 2H5-A14 inhibited the binding of FITC-labeled preS1 to HepG2-hNTCP cells in a dose-dependent manner, whereas an isotype-matched control Ab did not ( Figure 2A ). This result indicates that the neutralization mechanism of 2H5-A14 likely involves blocking of viral entry by interfering with the binding of NTCP and preS1, probably owing to steric hindrance at or near the preS1 receptor binding site.",

HBV has 10 known genotypes, all of which differ from each other by at least 8% at DNA sequence level (Sunbul, 2014) . Genotypes B, C, and D represent the major epidemic genotypes, and 2H5-A14 potently neutralized all three of these genotypes ( Figure 2B ). We also compared the potency of 2H5-A14 to other agents known to block HBV entry, including commercial HBIG (Hepatitis B Immune Globulin), KR127 (a humanized preS1 mouse mAb [Chi et al., 2007] ), and two prototype peptides of Myrcludex-B (Bogomolov et al., 2016) (an NTCP-binding preS1-derived synthetic myristoylated lipopeptide): m47-D (genotype D) and m47 (genotype C). Assays using a HepG2-hNTCP cell-based HBV infection system showed that 2H5-A14 had more than 1000-fold stronger neutralization activity than did HBIG against infection with recombinant HBV ( Figure 2C ) and HDV ( Figure 2D ), as well as against infection with six HBV primary isolates derived from HBV-infected patients (genotype C) ( HBV than did KR127, and 50-fold stronger anti-HBV activity than did either m47-D or m47 ( Figure 2C ). Consistently, in a primary human hepatocyte (PHHs) infection system, 2H5-A14 showed similar neutralization potency against a clinical viral isolate from an HBV-infected patient (genotype B) ( Figure 2E ). We examined variations in the epitope-forming amino acid sequences among HBV genotypes to assess the breadth of the neutralization activity of 2H5-A14 against HBV. In addition to the aforementioned variability at position 24 of preS1, position 22 also exhibited heterogeneity; genotypes F and H had leucine at this position while all other genotypes had alanine (Figure 1-figure supplement 1). Analysis using the HBVdb database revealed that this leucine mutation is present at a very low frequency (about 3.75%) among all reported HBV sequences (total 7407 sequences) (Hayer et al., 2013) , and is almost completely limited to genotypes F and H (Figure 2-figure supplement 5B). ELISA binding assays showed that 2H5-A14 bound weakly to a preS1 peptide variant containing the epitope-forming sequnces of both the F and H genotypes of HBV (Figure 2-figure supplement 5C), suggesting that 2H5-A14 likely has limited efficacy against these rare genotypes. Even so, our sequence analysis showed that the epitope 2H5-A14 is highly conserved and our neutralization assay results clearly showed that 2H5-A14 neutralizes the three major epidemic genotypes of HBV with remarkable potency. Given this, it is reasonable to extrapolate that 2H5-A14 can likely neutralize the vast majority (>95%) of HBV virus strains.",

Chimeric livers generated by transplanting human hepatocytes into Fah -/-Rag2 -/-/IL2rg -/-(FRG) triple knock-out mice ('hFRG mice') are known to be highly susceptible to HBV infection (Strom et al., 2010; Bissig et al., 2010a; Azuma et al., 2007) . We tested the in vivo efficacy of 2H5-A14 in neutralizing viral challenge both before (prophylactically) and after (therapeutically) administration of patient-derived viruses to these chimeric mice. The hFRG mice used in this were IP administered 2H5-A14, HBIG, or matched isotype control Ab at the indicated concentrations at 9 days after birth. One hour later, each mouse was challenged with 1 \u00c2 10 10 GE of HDV and was then sacrificed on post infection day 6. The liver tissues were collected from each mouse. HDV total RNA levels and the edited NTCP gene expression were measured by qPCR. The data were presented similarly as in Figure 1F . (B) Schematic diagram illustrating HBV challenging, bleeding and antibody administration schedules in the mouse study. Five animals were used in each group. Recipient hFRG mice were challenged with 1 \u00c2 10 9 GE HBV (Genotype B) on day 0. A single dose of 15 mg/kg 2H5-A14 was IP administered one day before viral challenge (prophylaxis), or biweekly doses of 20 mg/kg 2H5-A14 were IP administered starting from day 5 to day 21 after the challenge (therapeutic). HBIG (40 IU/kg) treatment was used as a control. experiment had high level of humanization with an average human serum albumin level of about 10 mg/mL. This experiment also included virus infection only (Vehicle Ctrl.) and HBIG control group. All of the treatments began at five dpi and lasted until 21 dpi ( Figure 3B ). Secreted HBsAg, as well as HBV DNA, and RNA levels ('virological markers') were measured periodically from serum samples. HBV rapidly and robustly replicated in the hFRG mice ( Figure 3C ). In the infection-only control group, the serum HBV DNA and RNA levels reached about 1 \u00c2 10 11 and 1 \u00c2 10 10 copies/mL, respectively, and HBsAg level exceeded 1 \u00c2 10 5 IU/mL. A single administration of 2H5-A14 (15 mg/ kg) one day prior to HBV challenge completely protected mice from HBV infection, as indicated by the levels of all of the virological markers in serum samples. Therapeutically, biweekly 2H5-A14 treatment (20 mg/kg) greatly reduced all of the virological markers in sera as compared to infection-only control and to the HBIG treatment groups. Remarkably, by the end of the experiment (37 dpi), 2H5-A14 treatment resulted in three log reductions in the HBV DNA and RNA levels relative to the two control groups ( Figure 3C ). In addition, human albumin levels and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activities in mouse serum samples were monitored throughout the study period. There were no significant differences between 2H5-A14 treated group and other groups including vehicle control, 2H5-A14 prophylaxis and HBIG control groups (Figure 3-figure supplement 1). Liver tissues collected at the end of the experiment were used for immunohistochemical staining (IHC) of HBsAg and HBcAg, Southern blotting of viral DNA and cccDNA, and Northern blotting of viral RNA. Consistent with our sera-based measurements, liver tissues from 2H5-A14 prophylaxis group animals had no detectable HBsAg and HBcAg or HBV DNA, cccDNA, or RNA; while both the infection vehicle control and HBIG treatment groups had strong signals for these markers; liver tissues from 2H5-A14 treatment had greatly reduced HBsAg and HBcAg, and had almost undetectable levels of HBV DNA and RNA ( Figure 3D and ",

Two stable CHO cell lines expressing either the wild type (WT) epitope or a mutant epitope of 2H5-A14 were established: CHO-59C cells expressing a recombinant single-transmembrane protein (WT preS1 fused with the transmembrane domain of VAMP2, vesicle-associated membrane proteins), to which 2H5-A14 efficiently binds, was used as the target cell line; CHO-59C-mut cells carrying a D20A mutation in preS1 that abolishes 2H5-A14 binding was used as the control cell line (Figure 4-figure supplement 1A) . 2H5-A14 but not an isotype-matched control antibody treatment resulted in a dose-dependent cytotoxic effect against CHO-59C cells; no such effect was observed for the CHO-59C-mut control cells, demonstrating that NK cell-mediated ADCC requires the presence of the 2H5-A14 epitope on target cells ( Figure 4A ).",

As expected, the 2H5-A14-DANA variant could still bind to CHO-59C cells and preS1 peptides, and neutralize HBV infection to the same extent as 2H5-A14 (Figure 4-figure supplement 1A-C), but could not bind to Fc receptors as revealed by FACS binding assays using NK92-MI hCD16 cells and SPR analysis (Biacore) using soluble human and mouse FcgRs (Figure 4 -figure supplement 1D and Figure 4-figure supplement 2) . Consistently, the 2H5-A14-DANA variant could not induce ADCC activity ( Figure 4A ). Using the same ADCC assay, we also demonstrated that 2H5-A14, but not the 2H5-A14-DANA variant, caused ADCC against HBV-infected cells. The HepG2-hNTCP cells infected by HBV were specifically killed by NK cells, whereas the HepG2-hNTCP cells uninfected by HBV were spared from NK cell killing ( Figure 4B ). We next examined if 2H5-A14 can mediate ADCC and ADCP via macrophages. When fully differentiated human macrophages were mixed with target cells (293F-59C, see materials and methods) expressing the 2H5-A14 epitope on their surface, both ADCP and ADCC were observed following treatment with wild type 2H5-A14 but not with the 2H5-A14-DANA variant ( Figure 4C, Figure 4 figure supplement 3A). FACS analysis confirmed that 2H5-A14 and 2H5-A14-DANA bound to these target cells to a similar extent (Figure 4-figure supplement 3B ). When the target cells were expressing a mutant epitope (293F-59C-mut), no specific ADCC and ADCP were observed ( Figure 4C ). Similar results were obtained using mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) as effector cells (Figure 4-figure supplement 3C). Taken together, the results of these in vitro assays suggest that 2H5-A14 can kill target cells via Fc-FgR interaction-dependent effector functions such as ADCC and ADCP.",

            "text": "To assess whether the effector functions of 2H5-A14 contribute to its in vivo efficacy, we compared the anti-viral activities of 2H5-A14 and 2H5-A14-DANA in the aforementioned HDV and HBV infection mouse models. The Fc of 2H5-A14 is from the human IgG1 isotype, which is able to engage mouse FcgRs on mouse effector cells (Figure 4-figure supplement 2) (Overdijk et al., 2012) . In the Ntcp gene-edited homozygous FVB mice, 2H5-A14-DANA and 2H5-A14 showed similar prophylactic efficacy: both offered complete protection from HDV infection at a 5 mg/kg dose ( Figure 5A ). This result suggests that Fab-mediated neutralization, rather than the Fc-mediated effector function, is primarily responsible for preventing viral infection. This mouse model only supports transientlyacute HDV infection and is thus only suitable to assess prophylactic efficacy. We therefore used the hFRG mouse model, which supports sustained HBV infection, to determine if the therapeutic effect of 2H5-A14 requires Fc-FgR interaction-dependent effector functions. hFRG mice with a medium level of humanization (an average human serum albumin level of about 3 mg/mL) were challenged with HBV on day 0. At 33 dpi, nine mice with similar level of stably-established HBV infection were divided into three groups and treated with 2H5-A14 (5 mg/kg), 2H5-A14-DANA (5 mg/kg), or PBS (vehicle control). Treatment was administered twice weekly for a total of 4 weeks ( Figure 5B ). Blood was collected periodically for monitoring virological markers, including DNA titer and the HBsAg level until the end of the experiment (89 dpi). The HBV DNA titer and the HBsAg level increased over time in the control group, with an average DNA titer of~2.0\u00c210 9 /mL and an average HBsAg level of~3\u00c210 6 IU/mL at 89 dpi. In the 2H5-A14-DANA group, the average HBV DNA titer and the HBsAg levels were~3.8\u00c210 8 /mL and~4.0\u00c210 4 IU/mL, respectively, at 89 dpi. In contrast, compared to the control group, the 2H5-A14 treatment group had an about 200-fold reduction in DNA titer (~1.0\u00c210 7 /mL) and a~40000 fold reduction in the HBsAg level (~70 IU/mL) at 89 dpi. Importantly, in contrast to control PBS or 2H5-A14-DANA, treatment with 2H5-A14 resulted in reductions in both HBV DNA titer and HBsAg levels over time, starting from the beginning of the treatment and continuing through the treatment window and 3 weeks after treatment withdrawal, with only a slight The experiment was performed similarly to that described in Figure 3A . Both 2H5-A14 and Fc mutant 2H5-A14-DANA were tested at 5 mg/kg. The copy numbers shown in the Y-axes are from 20 ng of total liver RNA for each sample. (B) Schematic diagram illustrating HBV challenge, bleeding and antibody treatment schedules in the mouse study. Figure 5 continued on next page rebound at the end of the experiment (4 weeks after treatment withdrawal) ( Figure 5C ). These results showed that 2H5-A14 treatment not only efficiently suppressed the spread of HBV in mice, but could also gradually reduce the extent of an established HBV infection over time. In contrast, 2H5-A14-DANA was able to suppress the spread of HBV as compared to the control group, but it did not reduce the extent of an established HBV infection: the levels of HBV DNA and HBsAg at all tested time points after the treatment were all higher than those at the starting point of treatment. Note that both 2H5-A14 and 2H5-A14-DANA treated mice had comparable serum antibody concentrations at all time points tested ( Figure 5D ) and had comparable human albumin levels both before viral challenge and at 80 dpi ( Figure 5-figure supplement 1A) . Liver tissues collected at the end of the experiment were used for IHC staining of HBsAg and Southern blotting of viral DNA and cccDNA. Consistent with our sera-based measurements, liver tissues from 2H5-A14-treated but not 2H5-A14-DANA-treated mice had greatly reduced levels of HBsAg (IHC assay) comparing to the control mice ( Figure 5E and Figure 5-figure supplement 1B) . No significant histopathological changes related to the treatment were observed. Southern blotting showed that the HBV total DNA and cccDNA were undetectable for the 2H5-A14-treatment group, whereas strong total DNA and cccDNA signals were observed for the 2H5-A14-DANA and control groups ( Figure 5F ). Quantification of the cccDNA level in the liver tissues by qPCR further independently confirmed that 2H5-A14-treated mice indeed had much lower cccDNA copy numbers than the other two groups ( Figure 5G ). These results demonstrate the potent in vivo anti-viral effect of 2H5-A14. Moreover, the comparison of the effects of 2H5-A14 and 2H5-A14-DANA treatments side by side clearly proves that the anti-viral effect of 2H5-A14 results only in part from Fab-mediated neutralization, while the Fc-dependent effector functions of 2H5-A14 are particularly critical in conferring its overall therapeutic effect.",

Recipient hFRG mice were challenged with HBV viruses (genotype D) at 2 \u00c2 10 9 GE. Twice weekly treatment with PBS, 2H5-A14 (5 mg/kg), or 2H5-A14-DANA (5 mg/kg) began at 33 dpi and lasted for 4 weeks. (C) HBV DNA titers and HBsAg levels in serum. Blood samples were collected at the indicated time points for measuring HBV DNA titers and/or HBsAg levels. (D) Antibody concentrations. The antibody concentrations in serum samples were measured by ELISA using antibody standards with known concentrations. Note, for dpi 40 and dpi 54, the blood samples were collected at three days after Ab administration; for dpi 60, the blood samples were collected 1 hr after Ab administration. The horizontal dotted lines indicate the lowest detection limits; the vertical dotted lines and the grey-shaded areas indicate the treatment window (C-D). (E) IHC staining of human cytokeratin-18 (hCK18) and HBsAg in serial sections of liver tissues from sacrificed hFRG mice at the end of the experiment (dpi 89). Intrahepatic HBsAg was detected by a specific anti-HBsAg mouse mAb, followed by HRP-anti-mouse secondary Ab and stained brown using DAB substrate, nuclei were stained blue by Hematoxylin. Human hepatocytes in consecutive tissue sections were visualized by staining with a human-specific hCK18 mAb and DAB substrate in blue violet, nuclei were stained with Nuclear Fast Red. Each image shown represents the staining result for one mouse of each group. (F) Southern blot analysis of intrahepatic viral DNA. Total HBV DNA was extracted from mouse liver tissues at dpi 89. The extracted DNA samples were analyzed by Southern blotting with an [a-32P] dCTP-labeled full-length HBV DNA probe. DNA samples prepared from normal mouse livers were used as a negative control. 100 pg each of 3.2 kb, 2.1 kb, and 1.7 kb HBV DNA fragments were used as DNA markers. rcDNA (relaxed circular DNA), cccDNA, and ssDNA (single-strand DNA) intermediates are labeled. (G) qPCR quantification of intrahepatic viral cccDNA level. 500 ng of total DNA prepared from the liver tissues collected at dpi 89 was digested by PSAD and 1/10 of the digested samples were used to quantify HBV cccDNA by qPCR using specific primers (see Materials and methods). The hNTCP gene copy numbers, which represent the amount of human hepatocytes in the liver tissues of chimeric mice, were used to normalize the cccDNA level in the human hepatocytes for each sample. The cccDNA copy number shown in the Y-axis is the relative value normalized to 1000 copies of hNTCP gene in~50 ng total DNA samples. Each square represents one mouse. The horizontal dotted line indicates the reliable detection limit. aforementioned studies in hFRG mice. Few random mutations were observed within the L genes in both mouse studies, and it appeared that more mutations were in the 2H5-A14 treatment group than that in the control group, but no mutation was specifically associated with 2H5-A14 treatment and no mutations were found within the antibody's epitope ( Figure 5-figure supplement 2) . Although we cannot completely rule out the possibility that 2H5-A14 treatment may induce escape mutants, these results indicate that the epitope of 2H5-A14, a receptor-binding proximal and highly conservative region centered by Phe 23 , is likely unsusceptible to escape mutation.",

However, neither the vaccine nor HBIG are effective in treating persistent HBV infection (Tsuge et al., 2016) . A previous study reported that a combination of two monoclonal nAbs against HBsAg (HepeX-B) only exhibited short-term anti-viral effects in animal models and an early phase I human study (Eren et al., 2000; Neumann et al., 2010) . A humanized anti-HBsAg nAb was recently shown to have longer anti-viral effects in mouse models mainly through clearance of the Ab-HBsAg immune complexes by phagocytosis . High levels of circulating HBsAg-containing non-infectious subviral particles are commonly present in the blood of chronicallyinfected HBV patients (Seeger et al., 2007) . It has been assumed that HBsAg can act as a decoy that prevents anti-HBsAg nAbs from effective targeting of infectious virions and infected cells, the formation of circulating immune complexes that may lead to immune complex disease also remains a potential risk. Compared to the HBsAg, the L protein is much less abundant in circulation and preferentially present on infectious HBV particles (Seeger et al., 2007) . Moreover it is now known that the preS1 domain of the L protein is responsible for receptor NTCP binding (Yan et al., 2012) .",

However, neither these nor any other anti-preS1 nAbs have been tested as a treatment against established HBV infection and no mechanistic studies have been conducted with these nAbs. BX-182 is an HBV subtype-specific nAb owing to sequence variations in its epitope (residues 6-10 of preS1, SVPNP).

Consistent with this in vitro potency, it is extremely effective in protecting mice from de novo HDV and HBV infection. Remarkably, 2H5-A14 demonstrated impressive therapeutic efficacy against HBV infection in two independent mouse studies using liver-humanized hFRG mice. At present, there is no immune-competent small animal model that supports natural and long-lasting HBV infection. Although the hFRG mice are immunodeficient (Azuma et al., 2007) , this model recapitulates the complete life cycle of HBV and is a valuable model for evaluating the efficacy of an antibody against HBV infection in vivo. Our initial animal study in hFRG mice with high-level of humanized chimeric liver was ended at 37 days due to the rampant viral propagation in the untreated control group, which had an adverse effect on the general health of these mice. The second study had slower viral propagation rates (likely due to the medium-level of liver humanization and/or the relatively lower propagation rate of the challenging virus) and lasted for 89 days, allowing us to assess the antiviral effect of 2H5-A14 over a longer period. Monitoring infection during this longer experimental period revealed a marked reduction of the extent of an established HBV infection in 2H5-A14-treated mice.",

            "text": "Mechanistically, we found that viral neutralization by 2H5-A14 is the dominant mechanism contributing to the protection of mice from HDV infection. In contrast, in addition to protecting hepatocytes from viral entry, Fc-mediated effector functions contribute substantially to the overall antiviral effect of 2H5-A14 against HBV infection in hFRG mice. Our experiments in the hFRG model revealed that wildtype 2H5-A14, but not the Fc-DANA mutant of 2H5-A14 (a variant incapable of mediating antibody-dependent effector functions), elicited remarkable anti-viral effects against an established HBV infection. hFRG mice lack T and B lymphocytes, and NK cells. NK cells are generally considered to be the main effector cells in mediating ADCC to induce apoptosis in target cells . The observed effector functions in hFRG model thus cannot be attributed to NK cells but to the remaining immune effector cells in these mice; for example FcgR-expressing macrophages or other meloid cells (e.g. neutraphils) that are capable of killing infected hepatocytes by ADCC and/or ADCP or antibody-dependent scretion of antiviral cytokines or by direct clearance of the antibodyopsonized viruses via phagocytosis. Considering that primary hepatocytes and HBV-infected hepatocytes may be resistant to CDC (Halme et al., 2009; Koch et al., 2005; Liu et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2013) , and 2H5-A14 lacked complement C1q binding activity and CDC activity in vitro, CDC is unlikely involved in the anti-viral effect of 2H5-A14 in the HBV-infected hFRG mice. Macrophages have previosuly been shown to be the major effector cells invovled in anti-tumor activity of several mAbs in mice (Clynes et al., 2000; Hamaguchi et al., 2006; Minard-Colin et al., 2008) . Macrophages exert their cytotoxic functions via diverse mechanisms such as ADCC, ADCP, etc. (Braster et al., 2014) . Neutrophils have also been reported to be involved in the anti-tumor efficacy of two mAbs in tumor models in mice (Siders et al., 2010; Golay et al., 2013) . It will be interesting to identify which immune effector cells are involved in mediating the in vivo antiviral effect of 2H5-A14 in future studies. The cells involved could be identified via the selective depletion of macropahges (van Rooijen and Hendrikx, 2010) or neutraphils (Daley et al., 2008) using specific reagents targeting each of them in hFRG mice.",

During chronic HBV infection, it appears that NK cells have impaired secretion of antiviral cytokines (e.g. IFN-g) yet are able to maintain their cytotoxicity (Maini and Peppa, 2013; Sun et al., 2015; Shabani et al., 2014) . The proportion of FcgR-expressing NK cells in liver (27-75% of total NK cells in liver) is lower than that in blood (Burt et al., 2009) . Nontheless, given that they retain their cytotoxicity, these FcgR-expressing NK cells can be assumed to have ADCC activity. Hepatic macropahges include both infiltrating macrophages and liver-resident macrophages (Kupffer cells, accounting for 80-90% of all tissue macrophages in entire body [Jenne and Kubes, 2013] ). The roles of these cells in HBV infection appear to be complicated (Ju and Tacke, 2016) . Similar to human tumor-associated macrophages, hepatic macropahges likely retain antibody-dependent effector fuctions via their expressed FcgRs (Herter et al., 2014; Grugan et al., 2012) . Future human clinical trials will allow us to determine if, as we found in hFRG mice, 2H5-A14 elicits its Fc-dependent effect functions via activating immune cells in liver to exert its anti-viral effect.",

            "text": "Two aspects of the anti-HBV effect of 2H5-A14 are worth noting. First, 2H5-A14 treatment resulted in substantial decreases in HBsAg levels in the blood of HBV-infected hFRG mice over time. Serological HBsAg reduction, and eventually HBsAg loss, is considered as a critical step toward a 'functional cure'. Current NUCs therapy rarely reduces HBsAg level in CHB patients. 2H5-A14 specifically targets preS1 but not the vast majority of HBsAg particles, therefore, in contrast to nAbs targeting HBsAg, the decline of HBsAg by 2H5-A14 cannot be attributed to the Ab-mediated clearance of HBsAg from the blood, but to a gradual reduction of established HBV infection. Second, 2H5-A14 treatment at least effectively suppressed cccDNA accumation and more likely reduced cccDNA in liver tissues. Due to techniqucal difficulties, we cannot quantify the intrahepatic cccDNA when treatment began, however the continuing reduction of the levels of DNA titers and HBsAg levels after treatment clearly demonstrates that 2H5-A14 does reduce the extent of an established HBV infection. Our data showed that 2H5-A14 can mediate immune effector cells to kill HBV-infected cells in vitro via ADCC and ADCP, although more evdience is needed, it is conceivable to speculate that the clearance of cccDNA-carrying infected cells or decrease their in vivo half-lives by Fc-dependent effector functions via FcgR engagement, including cytotolytic and/or noncytolytic mechanisms, may have contributed to the anti-HBV effect of 2H5-A14 in a manner beyond Fab-mediated blockage of new infections. It will be interesting to further determine the detailed mechanism of the antiviral effect of 2H5-A14, in particular the relative contribution of cytolytic versus noncytolytic effects in this process.",

            "text": "In summary, we identified six anti-preS1 human nAbs from a phage library and then improved the lead hit into 2H5-A14, a high-affinity and broad-spectrum nAb that is extremely potent in vitro and in vivo against both HDV and HBV. 2H5-A14 inhibits NTCP binding by recognizing a structurallydefined and highly-conserved epitope located in close proximity to the RBS of preS1. 2H5-A14 is also capable of triggering epitope-specific and Fc-dependent effector functions. Importantly, the effector functions contribute substantially to the anti-viral effect of 2H5-A14 against HBV infection in vivo. These results for the first time demonstrate a nAb targeting the RBS adjacent region on preS1 can exert anti-HBV effect through Fc-dependent effector functions by engaging FcgRs, pointing toward a novel antibody-Fc-dependent strategy for HBV treatment.",

NC36b, a peptide comprised of residues 4-36 of the pre-S1 domain of the HBV L protein with a biotin modification at its C-terminus. m47b, a lipopeptide comprised of amino acids 2-48 of the pre-S1 domain with a biotin modification at the C-terminus and a myristoylation modification at the N-terminus. A human non-immune scFv (single-chain fragment of variable domain: VH-linker-VL) antibody library (1.1 \u00c2 10 10 ) constructed from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 93 healthy donors was used for selection against the synthesized NC36b or m47b preS1 peptides. Briefly, the peptides were captured on streptavidin-conjugated magnetic M-280 Dynabeads (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA) and then incubated with 5 \u00c2 10 12 phage-scFv particles prepared from the library. For each peptide, two rounds of selection were performed. To recover high-affinity binders from the magnetic beads and to increase the diversity of the recovered phage-scFvs, two elution methods were used: peptide competition elution and conventional basic triethanolamine solution elution. Subsequently, a total of about 2000 single clones were randomly picked and rescued to produce phage-scFvs in the bacterial culture supernatant. These clones were screened for specific binding to NC36b and/or m47b by ELISA. More than 90% of the clones screened were positive for one or both peptides. Clones that bound to NC36b and/or m47b with an optical density at 450 nm >1.0 were selected for further antibody gene sequencing. The genes of the variable heavy chain (VH) and light chain (VL) of the selected clones were sequenced. A total of 109 clones with unique sequences were identified. These clones were either produced as purified phage-scFv particles or converted to full-length human IgG1s and then analyzed for binding to the preS1 peptides by ELISA again, and evaluated in HBV and/or HDV neutralization assays. At the end, top six clones were selected based on their binding and HBV/HDV neutralization activities.",

Construction of CHO-59C cell line: An expression plasmid was first constructed by inserting the preS1-59C coding DNA into the C-terminal (CT) extracellular domain of the VAMP2 gene that encodes a single-pass type IV transmembrane protein. The NT of VAMP2 is on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. Its CT extracellular domain only contains two amino acids. The 59C was added to the CT end of VAMP2; there was a 12aa long linker between 59C and VAMP2. The expression plasmid was then transfected into CHO cells, followed by FACS sorting of 2H5-A14-staining positive populations to obtain the stable cell line, CHO-59C. The CHO-59C-mut (D20A mutant in preS1-59C) stable cell line was similarly established and was used as a negative control cell line in the ADCC or ADCP assays.

The rest eight mice were euthanized at dpi 89, and the liver tissues were harvested. One portion of the liver tissues was frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately upon harvest to be used for analysis of HBV viral DNA. The remaining portion of the liver sample was fixed with 4% PFA in neutral PBS and paraffin-embedded for IHC analysis of HBsAg.",

Subsequent differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) experiments with the four nAbs revealed good thermostability of 2H5-A14. It is noteworthy that the major amino acid sequence differences of the four nAbs and 2H5 are in their HCDR3 loops, particularly 2H5-A14 only differs from 2H5-31 and 2H5-A21 in its HCDR3(Figure 2-figure supplement 3).",
