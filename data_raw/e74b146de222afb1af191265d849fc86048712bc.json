The derivatives are obtained in moderate to excellent yield by onepot three-component reaction of an isatin, malononitrile/ethylcyanoacetate, and 2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxane-4,6-dione in absolute ethanol under conventional heating and microwave irradiation. The catalyst was recovered by filtration from the reaction mixture and reused during five consecutive runs without any apparent loss of activity for the same reaction. The mild reaction conditions and recyclability of the catalyst make it environmentally benign synthetic procedure.",

The overall process involves the Knoevenagel condensation of Meldrum's acid with 1Hindole-2,3-dione followed by \"in situ\" Michael addition of malononitrile/ethyl cyanoacetate in single operation to give spiro(indole-pyranodioxine) derivatives similar to the earlier reports [24, 25] reaction of 3-carboethoxycyanomethylene-2H-indol-2-ones with cyclic ketones under classical conditions (Scheme 1). The process described here offers rapid facile one-pot synthesis of spiroindole derivatives using easily recyclable ZnO nanoparticles. This process is cost effective and hence ecofriendly as it is one-pot synthesis with easy workup and does not require harsh reagents. The process developed by us requires less quantity of catalyst (30 mg) for carrying out the catalytic reaction, thus decreasing the amount of effluent to considerable level.",

Therefore, 30 mg of ZnO nanoparticles was The Scientific World Journal sufficient to push the reaction forward, and further increasing of the amount of ZnO nanoparticles did not increase the yields (Table 3) . Reusability is one of the most important properties of this catalyst. To study the recyclability of the catalyst, the ZnO nanoparticles were used for the same reaction repeatedly and the change in their catalytic activity was studied. The relation between the number of cycles of the reaction and the catalytic activity in terms of yield of product is presented in Figure 1 . The catalyst recovered by filtration from the reaction mixture after dilution with ethyl acetate was reused as such for subsequent experiments under similar conditions. The catalyst retained optimum activity till five cycles after which drop in yield was observed (Figure 1) .",
