            "text": "Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. The lack of tumor specificity remains a major drawback for effective chemotherapies and results in dose-limiting toxicities. However, a ligand-mediated drug delivery system should be able to render chemotherapy more specific to tumor cells and less toxic to normal tissues. In this study, we isolated a novel peptide ligand from a phage-displayed peptide library that bound to non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines. The targeting phage bound to several NSCLC cell lines but not to normal cells. Both the targeting phage and the synthetic peptide recognized the surgical specimens of NSCLC with a positive rate of 75% (27 of 36 specimens). In severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice bearing NSCLC xenografts, the targeting phage specifically bound to tumor masses. The tumor homing ability of the targeting phage was inhibited by the cognate synthetic peptide, but not by a control or a WTY-mutated peptide. When the targeting peptide was coupled to liposomes carrying doxorubicin or vinorelbine, the therapeutic index of the chemotherapeutic agents and the survival rates of mice with human lung cancer xenografts markedly increased. Furthermore, the targeting liposomes increased drug accumulation in tumor tissues by 5.7fold compared with free drugs and enhanced cancer cell apoptosis resulting from a higher concentration of bioavailable doxorubicin. The current study suggests that this tumor-specific peptide may be used to create chemotherapies specifically targeting tumor cells in the treatment of NSCLC and to design targeted gene transfer vectors or it may be used one in the diagnosis of this malignancy.",

            "text": "Lung cancer is one of the most commonly diagnosed malignancies in developed countries and is a growing problem in developing countries [1] . There are two major types of lung cancer: non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC). NSCLC makes up approximately 80% of all lung cancer cases [2] and has a limited response rate to current chemotherapeutic agents, with tumor shrinkage in only 20% of patients and a two-year survival rate between 10% and 16% [3] . One major reason for this unsatisfactory outcome of chemotherapy is compromised drug delivery to the lung cancer tissues due to high interstitial fluid pressures (IFP) within the tumor [4] . Systemically administered chemotherapy cannot be adequately delivered into solid tumors because of the immature vasculature with abnormal architecture [5] and leaky, heterogeneous vessel walls [6] as well as the high IFP within tumor tissues [7, 8] . Furthermore, a lack of tumor specificity allows anti-cancer drugs to distribute indiscriminately to normal organs and tissues. Thus, cancer cells are exposed to a lower concentration of the drug than normal cells [9] , resulting in not only decreased effectiveness but also increased toxicity. Therefore, it is important to develop a strategy to enhance the amount of drugs delivered to tumor tissues in a targeted way while sparing normal tissues.",

Compared with conventionally administered chemotherapeutic agents, lipid-or polymer-based nano-medicine drug delivery systems have the advantage of improving the pharmacological and therapeutic properties of cytotoxic drugs [11] . Most smallmolecule chemotherapeutic agents have a large volume of distribution on intravenous administration [12] and a narrow therapeutic window due to serious toxicity to normal tissues. By encapsulating drugs in nano-particles such as liposomes, scientists can significantly reduce the volume of distribution and increase the concentration of active drug within the tumor [13] . PEGylated liposomal doxorubicin (with brand names of Doxil in the US and Caelyx in Europe) [14] has been shown to significantly improve the therapeutic index of doxorubicin both in preclinical [15] [16] [17] and clinical studies [18] [19] [20] [21] .

After five rounds of affinity selection (biopanning) with CL1-5, cells increased the titer of phage by 40-fold (Fig. 1A) . Enriched phages from the third to the fifth biopanning rounds were randomly selected. We then sequenced the phage clones with higher CL1-5binding activities. Using the Genetics Computer Group (GCG) software analysis, we found that these selected phages (PC3-1, PC4-1, PC4-5, PC5-2 and PC5-4) displayed the consensus motif, tryptophan (W)-threonine (T)/tyrosine (Y)-tyrosine (Y) ( Table 1) . Interestingly, the phage PC5-2 appeared in the third (PC3-1), fourth (PC4-1) and fifth (PC5-2) biopanning rounds. During the biopanning rounds, the frequency of PC5-2 increased from 20% (1/5) in the third cycle to 90% (27/30) in the fifth cycle (Table 1) . We chose to focus on the novel peptide displayed by PC5-2, TDSILRSYDWTY, for further study. In vitro phage display screening for peptides that bind to NSCLC. (A) A phage-displayed random peptide library was used to select phages that bind to the NSCLC cell line CL1-5. (B) Visualization of PC5-2 binding to CL1-5 and PC13 lung cancer cells (arrowheads) with immunohistochemical staining. The control phage did not bind to CL1-5 cells. Scale bar: 10 mm. (C) The FITC-labeled peptide SP5-2 bound to five NSCLC cell lines but not to NPC-TW01 cells as detected by immunofluorescent staining. Scale bar: 10 mm. (D) Representative photomicrographs of tumor sections from surgical specimens of human lung cancer were detected using both PC5-2 (a, arrowhead) and biotinylated SP5-2 (c, arrowhead), respectively. In comparison, the control phage or biotinylated control peptide could not bind to these surgical specimens (b and d). PC5-2 was competitively inhibited by the synthetic peptide SP5-2 (e).

Like PC5-2, the tumor-homing ability of PC5-4 was also competitively inhibited by SP5-2 ( Fig. S4 and Text S2), suggesting that these two phages may bind through this motif to the same target molecule on the plasma membrane of lung cancer cells. We proposed that these three amino acid residues might play a crucial role in homing to tumor tissues. To test this hypothesis, we changed these three amino acid residues in SP5-2 (TDSILR-SYDWTY) to GGG in a mutant peptide, MP5-2 (TDSILR-SYDGGG). Although the tumor-homing ability of PC5-2 had been markedly inhibited by the peptide SP5-2, this competitive inhibition was lost in MP5-2, which contains the GGG residue instead of the WTY residues in SP5-2 (Fig. 2B) . These data indicate that the WTY residues were important for the binding ability of SP5-2 to NSCLC cells.",

Specifically, we found a phage clone PC5-2 that made up 90% of the selected phages binding to CL1-5 cells after five rounds of biopanning (Table 1) . Immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry assays confirmed that PC5-2 bound to NSCLC cell surface. The same binding results were observed in the cognate synthetic peptide SP5-2, which replaced PC5-2 ( Fig. 1 and Figs. S1, S2, S3). These experiments supported that this targeting peptide can specifically bind to the cell surface of NSCLC cell lines. In vivo experiments also consolidated the homing ability of the peptide. The expression of the SP5-2 peptide (TDSILR-SYDWTY) guides the phage to accumulate in NSCLC xenografts but not in normal organs (Fig. 2) . The binding activity of PC5-2 to tumor tissues was inhibited by the synthetic peptide SP5-2 (Fig. 2B) , indicating that PC5-2 interacted with NSCLC cells by its displayed peptide and not by another part of the phage particle. That the mutated synthetic peptide, MP5-2, did not inhibit the PC5-2 binding demonstrated the importance of the WTY motif in the binding activity (Fig. 2B) . Moreover, this phenomenon was observed in immunohistochemical staining of surgical specimens from human lung cancer (Fig. 1D e and f) , in animal models for ligand-targeted chemotherapy (Fig. 3A) and in tumor localization of doxorubicin delivered by SP5-2-conjugated targeting liposomes (Figs. 4 and 5A) .",

However, the efficacy of doxorubicin in the treatment of NSCLC remains unsatisfactory with a response rate of 15% [42] . This is in part a result of suboptimal doses within the tumor due to indiscriminate drug distribution throughout the body and severe toxicity to normal tissues and organs. Liposomal encapsulation with a targeting ligand may be an effective strategy to deliver the drug directly to tumor cells. Our data revealed that this peptide markedly increased the therapeutic efficacy of liposomal chemotherapies and resulted in higher survival rates in mice with human lung cancer xenografts, and produced limited side effects on the animals (Fig. 3) . This peptide increased the therapeutic index of not only doxorubicin but also of vinorelbine, a vinca alkaloid used to treat advanced NSCLC [3] . Furthermore, we observed decreased vessel density and substantially increased cell apoptosis in tumor tissues after the targeting liposome treatment (Figs. 5B and S6). This ligand-mediated liposomal formulation is potentially superior to conventional anti-cancer therapy for NSCLC.",

These results echo other similar investigations [43, 44] . With prolonged presence of liposomes in circulation, more doxorubicin was taken up by tumor cells than conventional doxorubicin administration (Fig. 4) ; this finding was further confirmed in fluorescence signaling of doxorubicin in tumor tissues (Fig. 5A) . This passive targeting phenomenon of non-ligand conjugated liposomes is called the ''enhanced permeability and retention effect'' [45, 46] . In our study, the doxorubicin concentration in the LD-treated group was three times that of the (Table S2) . However, the tumors in the SP5-2-LD group had even higher doxorubicin concentration that was 1.9-and 2.1fold higher than those in the LD and MP5-2-LD groups (Table  S2 ). The bioavailable drug in the nuclei of cancer cells in the SP5-2-LD was also 2.6-and 2.4-fold higher than those in the LD and MP5-2-LD groups (Table S2 ). These results indicated that this peptide directly delivered the chemotherapeutic drug to intended targets. Enhancement of drug accumulation in tumor tissues correlated with the increased therapeutic efficacy (Figs. 3, 4 and 5) . The peptide-functionalized liposomes were found to have important clinical potential in a targeted drug delivery system. In order to for them to be used clinically, however, a final targeting liposome construct will need to be selected after each component, i.e. peptide ligands, conjugation methodologies, and liposomal drugs, have been optimized.",

Linking SP5-2 to liposomes containing doxorubicin and vinorelbine increased the therapeutic efficacy and survival rates in mice with human NSCLC xenografts because of enhanced tumor apoptosis and decreased tumor angiogenesis. Quantitation and visualization of doxorubicin levels also showed increased drug concentration in tumor tissues in this formulation, highlighting the enhancement in both the delivery and penetration of doxorubicin into the tumor. Our results indicate that the SP5-2 tumor targeting peptide may be used as imaging probes of NSCLC and targeting ligands for liposomal delivery systems to increase the efficacy of chemotherapy for NSCLC.",
