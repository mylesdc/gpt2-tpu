Five HAdV types among three species, including HAdV-3 (species HAdV-B), HAdV-4 (species HAdV-E), HAdV-7 (species HAdV-B), HAdV-55 (species HAdV-B), and an undefined HAdV type (species HAdV-C) were identified. The comparison results of the penton base, hexon, and fiber gene sequences of the Beijing HAdV-3, HAdV-4, HAdV-7, and HAdV-55 strains in this study and those from the GenBank database indicated significant spatial and temporal conservation and stability of sequences within the genome; however, the phylogenetic relationship indicated that both strain BJ04 and strain BJ09 isolated in 2012 and 2013, respectively, may have recombined between HAdV-1 genome and HAdV-2 genome within species HAdV-C, indicating intraspecies recombination.",

In the penton base sequences, strain BJ04 and BJ09 were close to the corresponding sequences of the HAdV-1 strains in the GenBank database, and exhibited less similarity with the HAdV-2 prototype strain recorded in the GenBank database (Fig. 2a) . And from the nucleotide sequence alignment based on the penton base gene (Fig. 2b) , strains BJ04 and BJ09 are a little more like HAdV-1 sequences, due to HAdV-2 sequences having a 9-nt deletion from nt 1099 to nt 1107. In the hexon gene and fiber gene, the sequences of strain BJ04 and strain BJ09 clustered with that of HAdV-2 ( Fig. 2c and 2d) .

Genomics and bioinformatics data indicate that HAdV-55 (earlier name HAdV-11a) is an emergent respiratory pathogen due to recombination between HAdV-11 and HAdV-14 [13, 14] . As a newly identified acute respiratory disease pathogen, HAdV-55-associated outbreaks were reported to have occurred in military camps of Singapore and Turkey in 2005 [27] , and in a senior high school in the Shaanxi province of China in 2006 [13] . Since 2008, this pathogen has been isolated from cases of respiratory infection and community-acquired pneumonia among adults in Beijing, Hebei, Shandong, Chongqing, and Gansu provinces of China [28] [29] [30] ; it was also isolated among military trainees in Hebei province of China in 2012 [30] . This may raise a serious public health concern, because HAdV-55 has the potential to spread and cause severe epidemics in China, and it may become a major etiological agent causing pneumonia among the Chinese population. In this study, two patients who were affected with HAdV-55 also appeared to have relatively severe symptoms (clinical diagnosis was pneumonia), highlighting the significance of HAdV-55 as being an increasing cause of respiratory illness especially pneumonia. Therefore, efforts should be focused on a HAdV-55 vaccine because of its stable genome. In addition, the genome stability of these HAdVs is also a desired property in the application of these viruses as gene delivery vectors.",

Recombination is a well-known feature in HAdV genetics and is one of the most important factors driving the evolution of HAdVs [31] . In this study, the phylogenetic analysis indicated that strain BJ04 and strain BJ09 may have recombined between HAdV-1 genome (penton base gene) and HAdV-2 genome (hexon and fiber genes) within species HAdV-C, which are intraspecies recombination events. Intraspecies recombinations have already been identified in many emergent HAdV pathogens, which were subsequently identified as novel type HAdVs, such as HAdV-53 to 68 [13, 31, 32] . In this study, strains BJ04 and BJ09 were identified as intraspecies recombinants, and this recombination pattern (P1H2F2) has not yet been found in elsewhere, which indicated that it may also be a novel HAdV type. Although the two patients affected with this undefined type HAdV appeared to have only mild symptoms (clinical diagnosis was upper respiratory tract infection), the pathogenicity remains unclear and the virus has the potential to cause serious symptoms because of its infection of children below 1-year old. Further studies on the whole genomic sequence and virulence determination including a comparison of the growth kinetics and cytopathology of the recombinant virus and the two parental strains (HAdV-1 and HAdV-2) will be required to elucidate the characteristics of this novel HAdV type.",

            "text": "2013, 4617 cases of respiratory infections were identified by the surveillance project; 45 were identified as adenovirus-positive. After virus isolation, 21 adenovirus isolates were obtained from sporadic and outbreak cases of respiratory infection: 2 cases from 2011, 2 cases from 2012, and 17 cases from 2013 (Table 2). Penton base, hexon, and fiber genes from virus isolates were successfully amplified. By the phylogenetic analysis of 21 Beijing HAdV strains and 22 HAdV type strains representing 7 species, three species (species HAdV-B, HAdV-C, and HAdV-E) were identified, including HAdV-3 (species HAdV-B; 10 strains: 1 in 2011, 1 in 2012, and 8 in 2013), HAdV-4 (species HAdV-E; 1 strain in 2013), HAdV-7 (species HAdV-B; 6 strains: 1 in 2011 and 5 in 2013), HAdV-55 (species HAdV-B; 2 strains in 2013), and a undefined HAdV type with HAdV-1 (accession number: AF534906) like penton base gene and HAdV-2 (accession number: AC_000007) like hexon gene and fiber gene (species HAdV-C; 2 strains: 1 in 2012 and 1 in 2013) were identified(Fig. 1).Based on the nucleotide alignments of their penton base, hexon, and fiber gene sequences, the HAdV-3, HAdV-4, HAdV-7, and HAdV-55 strains, isolated in Beijing during 2011-2013 were more conserved, with nearly 100% nucleotide identity to the corresponding type of HAdV. In penton base, hexon, and fiber genes, the identities between HAdV-7 strains from 2011 and 2013 were about 99.9%-100% with 0-3 nt substitutions, and HAdV-3 strains from 2011 to 2013 also had the highest sequence similarity (99.8-100%, 0-3 nt substitutions). While strain BJ04 (isolated in 2012) and BJ09 (isolated in 2013) that belong to the undefined HAdV type showed high identities in penton base gene (99.7%, 5 nt substitutions) and fiber gene (99.9%, 2 nt substitutions), but shared only 98.9% nucleotide sequence identity with 33 nt substitutions in hexon gene, indicating slight variation. According to the chronological distribution of the viruses, 9 representative HAdV strains [HAdV-3 (3), HAdV-4 (1), HAdV-7 (2), HAdV-55 (1), and the undefined HAdV type (2)] were selected to deposit in the GenBank nucleotide sequence database (penton base: KP270906-KP270914; hexon: KM458622-KM458630; fiber: KP270915-KP270923), and also for further analysis (",
