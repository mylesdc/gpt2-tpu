Although entry of ecotropic murine leukemia virus (E-MLV) requires host cell endocytosis, the involvement of endocytosis in cell fusion is unclear. By fluorescent microscopic analysis of the fusion-from-within, we found that fragments of target cells are internalized into Env-expressing cells. Treatment of the Env-expressing cells with an endocytosis inhibitor more significantly inhibited the cell fusion than that of the target cells, indicating that endocytosis in Env-expressing cells is required for the cell fusion. The endocytosis inhibitor also attenuated the fusion-from-without. Electron microscopic analysis suggested that the membrane fusion resulting in fusion-from-within initiates in endocytic membrane dents. This study shows that two types of the viral cell fusion both require endocytosis, and provides the cascade of fusion-from-within.",

Interestingly, syncytiotrophoblasts are formed by endogenous retroviral envelope (Env) proteins called syncytins (Malassin\u00e9 et al., 2005 (Malassin\u00e9 et al., , 2007 . Membrane fusion mechanism in retroviral entry has been well studied. However, cell-cell fusion mechanism by retroviral Env proteins is less characterized. Pathology of many placental abnormalities including eclampsia remains to be elucidated. Some of these disorders may be induced by impaired syncytiotrophoblast formation. Therefore, it is important to resolve cell-cell fusion mechanism induced by the Env protein for identification of placental diseases caused by impaired syncytin functions and for development of new therapeutic approaches against such diseases. Here, we challenged to elucidate the mechanism of cell-cell fusion by Env proteins of ecotropic murine leukemia virus (E-MLV) and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1).",

The E-MLV R-Env or HIV-1 Env expression plasmid was transfected to HEK293T cells together with a GFP expression plasmid. TE671 cells expressing the E-MLV receptor (TE671mCAT1) were stained with the cell tracker orange, and co-cultured with the transfected cells. Interestingly, many small orange dots under green background were observed in fused cells induced by the E-MLV R-Env (Figure 1A upper panel) and the HIV-1 Env (Figure 1A lower panel) . Relatively large orange signals represent unfused cells on syncytia. When 293T cells were transfected with the non-fusogenic R peptide-containing Env expression plasmid together with the GFP expression plasmid, and co-cultured with the cell tracker orange-stained TE671/mCAT1 cells, such orange dots were not detected in the GFP-expressing cells (Figure 1B upper panel) . Similarly, when the R-Env-transfected 293T cells were co-cultured with unstained TE671mCAT1 cells and cell tracker orange-stained TE671 cells, small orange dots were not observed in green fused syncytia ( Figure 1B middle and lower panels). When unsusceptible orange cells were located near fused cells, the syncytia were not enlarged. These results show that the small orange dots are specifically generated in fused cells. These observation suggested three possibilities; (i) small fragments derived from the target cells are internalized into the Env-expressing cells, (ii) the target cells are fragmented after enclosing the whole target cells by the Env-expressing cells like phagocytosis, or (iii) after the cell fusion, the target cell cytoplasm are not mixed with the Env-expressing cell cytoplasm in the fused cells, and are fragmented.",

Because the cell tracker orange is a low molecular size compound and more rapidly diffuses than the GFP protein, the third possibility is also unlikely. Thus, the first possibility is most likely, and the small orange dots might represent intracellular vesicles such as endosomes/lysosomes. To assess the hypothesis, the E-MLV R-Env was transfected to HEK293T cells together with a Cterminally GFP tagged CD63 (CD63-GFP) expression plasmid, since CD63 is specifically localized to late endosomes and lysosomes (Pols and Klumperman, 2009) . Target cells were stained with the cell tracker orange, and co-cultured with the Env plus CD63-GFP-expressing cells 1-2 days after the transfection. We found that almost all of small orange dots in fused cells were co-located with CD63-GFP signals (Figure 2A) . This result indicated that parts of the target cells were encapsulated into late endosomes/lysosomes of the Env-expressing cells during the cell fusion, and strongly supported the first possibility.",

Second, the cell color of the target cells was changed from orange to yellow, indicating that cytoplasm is mixed resulted from the membrane fusion. Third, those cells were merged to form a symcytium. Due to low resolution of the time-lapse fluorescence microscope, orange dots were not observed in fused cells. Additionally, the time-lapse imaging showed that ruffling structures of cell membranes bound each other, and cell-fusion occurred ( Figure 2C) .

Syncytium formation induced by the E-MLV R-Env (Figure 3A left panel) or by the HIV-1 Env (Figure 3A right panel) was more efficiently inhibited when the Env-expressing cells were treated than when the target cells were treated, showing that the syncytium formation requires endocytosis, cathepsin B, and endosome acidification in the Envexpressing cells. Because the treatment with each inhibitor did not affect cell viability (Figure 3B) , the suppression of cell fusion by the inhibitors should not result from unexpected effects of the inhibitors. Additionally, when the E-MLV R-Env (Figure 3C left panel) or HIV-1 Env (Figure 3C right panel) expression plasmid was transfected to HEK293T cells together with a dominant negative mutant of dynamin, cell-cell fusion was inhibited. These results suggest that endocytosis in the Env-expressing cells are required for the cell-cell fusion. Unfortunately, the target cells stably expressing the dynamin dominant negative mutant were not obtained. When the target cells were transiently transfection with the dynamin mutant, syncytium formation was not affected due to the mutant expression in only several % of transfected cells. Thus, the impact of dynamin mutant expressed in target cells on the cell-cell fusion could not be analyzed.",

To know how endocytosis is involved in the cell fusion, electron microscopic observation at the cell-cell contact area was performed. It was observed that small parts of a cell were invaginated into another cell at the cell-cell contact area like endocytosis (Figures 4A,B) . Two types of fused membrane were observed by the electron microscopy; (i) a relatively wide area of plasma membrane at the cell-cell contact region disappeared by membrane fusion (Figure 4C , red box), and (ii) a small membrane region at a tip of a membrane dent disappeared by membrane fusion (Figure 5 upper panel) . Because in the former type of fused membrane, relatively wide membrane area always disappeared, it was thought that their fusion pores were already enlarged. In contrast, the fusion pores observed in the membrane dents were smaller and not enlarged yet, suggesting that the fusion pores in the membrane dents are nascent and newly formed. These results suggested that the membrane fusion starts at membrane dents.",

These compartments should be derived from plasma membrane remaining between the membrane fusion sites when more than two membrane fusions occurred at a cell-cell contact area. Thus, membrane fusions should occur at gaps of the long and narrow compartments ( Figure 4D, red arrows) . Interestingly, a round vesicle was observed at a gap of long and narrow compartments (Figure 5 lower panel) . It was thought that the vesicle is formed by membrane fusion at the root of invaginating membrane, which results in cytoplasm mixing. This result also supported the conclusion that the membrane fusion starts at the membrane dent. Such intracellular vesicles were not observed at many of the nicks of the long and narrow compartments ( Figure 4D) . The nicks without vesicles might be formed by the membrane fusion at a tip of a membrane dent mentioned above (Figure 5 upper panel). Thus, it was suggested that the membrane fusion at a tip of a membrane dent more preferentially occurs than that at a root.",

Vesicles containing the target cell cytoplasm (orange) remain in the fused cell. Fourth, cells are merged completely to form a syncytium.

Because dynamin is involved in pinching endosomes off and does not affect the membrane dent formation, dynasore can inhibit the membrane fusion at a root of membrane dent, but not that at a tip. The membrane fusion at a root of membrane dent might be induced by dynamin-mediated scission of both the target and Env-expressing cell membranes. The membrane fusion at a tip of membrane dent might result from activation of the Env fusogenicity by acidification of spaces between target and Env-expressing cells. Our study cannot exclude the possibility that the membrane fusion resulting in cell-cell fusion occurs other places than membrane dents. It was difficult to find the membrane dents with fusion pores, suggesting that the nascent fusion pore is unstable and easily enlarged.
