However, their histories illustrate the three keys for effective detection and control of disease: clinical identification, laboratory detection, and public response. In diseases where all elements of this three-step framework were in place, the time from initial observation to appropriate public response tended to occur quickly. For example, in late November 2002, an atypical pneumonia that ultimately came to be known as severe acute respiratory syndrome made its appearance in China and a few other countries in East Asia. Once the World Health Organization was notified in February 2003 1 , a massive coordinated response was deployed. The causative agent was identified within two weeks 2 and the disease was halted by effective quarantine in 42 days 3 .",

The central piece of these three pillars is laboratory detection, which requires a good laboratory workforce and networks. In keeping with this central role, workforce and laboratory network development were the twin goals of the three-day Africa Centres for Disease Control (CDC) workshop held in Addis Ababa from 27 to 29 March 2017.",

Briefly, Dr Pascale Ondoa presented the LABNET scorecard 4 , which measures laboratory network preparedness, maturity, and adherence to regulations. Dr Brian Wood presented a report on a video-conferencing technology that trains primary care providers on how to treat complex diseases -the 'Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes (ECHO)' model 5 . Dr Rebecca Martin shared the experience of establishing the East African Public Health Laboratory Network. Mr Adjane Kossivi Koura shared the impressive work of RESAOLAB, which has over 700 laboratories in its laboratorystrengthening network spread over seven west African countries 6 , and Dr Naima El Mdaghri talked about laboratory networks in North Africa.",

The close networking of the RISLNETs with national players will help to drive regionally appropriate plans for AMR, pandemic preparedness, and rapid response, among others. \u00df The second outcome of this meeting is the establishment of the Africa CDC Anti-Microbial Resistance and Surveillance Network (Africa CDC AMRSNET). The goal would be to standardise the approach to AMR. The Africa CDC AMRSNET will work closely with WHO's GLASS. Africa CDC AMRSNET will strive to achieve quality data across the region, establish mentorship programmes, and centres of excellence to drive AMR work. \u00df The third outcome of this meeting is to highlight and improve the role of the private sector laboratories in supporting public health work in Africa. The private sector is well equipped to extend the reach and capacity of the public health role that Africa CDC is serving in the community. The most important thing for me is: 'is the African patient being served?' \u2022 Professor Alash'le Abimiku (Chair of the Board, African Society for Laboratory Medicine) \u00df I am hoping that Africa CDC will use the wide array of best practices and resources that have been highlighted during this meeting to improve what it does as far as disease surveillance, prevention, control of outbreaks, laboratory workforce development, etc. Knowledge of the tools and possibilities out there will help Africa CDC to advocate more appropriately, based on a true understanding of the opportunities and challenges on the ground. \u00df Secondly, I am hoping for better harmonisation of policies and programmes across borders. Even though this might require modification of what individuals and institutions are doing, this work is critical because we as Africans will have more political traction globally as a collective voice rather than singly. A good example of such collaboration is how we utilise the three to four biosafety level 4 laboratories in the continent. If we all work together within our respective regions we can take advantage of existing infrastructure rather than building from scratch. We all need the mindset that harmonisation, networking, and collaboration are value-added. \u00df The Africa CDC has an incredible leader that is taking the advantage of this meeting to bring the best minds and ideas to the table. The success of the regional collaborating centres will depend largely on their ability to continue to think in this open-minded, proactive, and inclusive way.",

The rest of the morning talks were examples of best practices from various African regions. Dr Tenaw Andualem discussed the AMR Control Strategy in Ethiopia, with emphasis on the key role that engaging the media plays in public education, Dr Kone Louis Penali shared the AMR Update and Control Strategy from C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Dr Mohamed Genedy presented the AMR Update and Control Strategy in Egypt, and Dr Ondoa shared a talk from the CDC's Senegal regional collaborating centre titled 'What Can a Framework for Surveillance Laboratory Networks for Antimicrobial Resistance in Five Regions of Africa Look Like? Role of Africa CDC Regional Collaborating Centres'. The afternoon breakout sessions were also on the topic of AMR and were guided conversations focused on various aspects of establishing AMR surveillance, intervention and control, including the role of private and international partners. All groups returned with clear recommendations on the role Africa CDC could play in AMR going forward.",

While there were many excellent ideas that came out of the breakout sessions suggesting various ways forward for the Africa CDC, what struck me was the abundance of positive examples from various regions of Africa. These examples from the private and public sector are already effective in the region, and have in some cases been sustained for decades. Success is inevitable if the Africa CDC serves as the custodian of these success models. The African Journal of Laboratory Medicine encourages submissions that highlight these examples of best practices.",
