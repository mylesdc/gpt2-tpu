Upper respiratory tract infections are more common in the autumn/winter in Europe and North America, and during the rainy season in tropical countries. 2 Children are prone to developing RTIs because their immune system has yet to fully mature. [3] [4] [5] Increased exposure to viral infections during day care attendance, as well as other social and environmental factors, can increase the risk of RTI. 4 The respiratory system is a primary target for key air pollutants, which can increase the risk of acute and recurrent RTIs. 6 Most of these pollutants disrupt local mucosal innate immunity mechanisms, leading to bacterial colonisation, impaired killing and increased allergen permeability.",

Owing to the high morbidity, mortality and healthcare costs, effective prevention and treatment of RTIs are a high priority worldwide. 7, 8 Treatment is focused on symptom relief, such as antihistamines and decongestants for nasal congestion 9 and antitussives for cough. 10, 11 Although antibiotics are only indicated in a minority of patients, they are often unnecessarily prescribed for viral infections against which they have no effect. A recent US report highlighted that ~30% of outpatient, oral antibiotic prescriptions were inappropriately written. 12 Antibiotic misuse has led to the emergence of resistant bacteria, meaning that higher doses and more advanced generations of drugs are required, and at present, some infected patients cannot be treated adequately. 13 Owing to the current unmet need for effective, alternative conservative therapies, efforts are being refocused towards preventative strategies including 5 behavioural intervention; avoidance of environmental risk factors such as passive smoking 14 and highly polluted city areas; vaccination, such as active targeted immunisation; targeted medical intervention; non-specific immunostimulation or immunomodulation (eg bacterial lysates) [15] [16] [17] [18] ; nutrition, including vitamins (eg C or D) and microelements; and regular physical activity ( Table 1) . Parents of children with recurrent RTIs may also discuss \"immune-stimulating\" therapies that they have seen advertised, such as herbal (eg Echinacea) and homoeopathic remedies, and animalderived products (eg cod liver oil and thymus extracts). 5 Owing to significant heterogeneity and a lack of high-quality clinical evidence supporting many of these therapies, 19 here we reviewed existing immunity-targeted therapies available for ENT infections in children, with an emphasis on non-specific immunomodulation administered together with the standard of care. which is not only based on an increase in non-specific immunoglobulin A response against pathogens at mucosal surfaces, but also on activation of mucosal dendritic cells by pattern recognition receptor-dependent signalling. 26 In this review, we want to highlight emerging, evidence-based approaches for conservative management of the most common recurrent and chronic URTIs in children, with an emphasis on the role of immunomodulation.

Secondly, in a 90-day trial with the oral probiotic Streptococcus salivarius K12, all 30 children who completed the study had a significant reduction in streptococcal pharyngeal infection episodes (more than 90%) compared with the previous year, as well as a significant decrease in the incidence (80%) of oral viral infections 58 ; no difference was observed in the control group. Similar results were observed in an earlier study. 59 Finally, in a study of 160 children aged 5-14 years with pharyngotonsillitis, ribosomal immunotherapy led to a significant improvement in both specific immunity and non-specific immunity and may therefore be effective in the prophylaxis of recurrent pharyngotonsillitis. 605 | OTITIS MED IA5.1 | EpidemiologyAcute OM (AOM) is a viral or bacterial infection of the middle ear and is the most common childhood infection for which antibiotics are prescribed in the USA.12,61 Recurrent AOM is typically defined as at least three episodes in a 6-month period, or four or more episodes in a 12-month period including at least one episode in the preceding 6 months.62 There are a number of risk factors for AOM recurrence, including the winter season, male gender and passive smoking.",

In a Cochrane review evaluating zinc and the common cold, which included 18 randomised controlled trials and 1781 children and adults, it was concluded that zinc could shorten episode duration in children and also be used as a preventative measure 99 ; further research should focus on the effect of zinc in patients at a greater risk of developing complications after a common cold. A recent metaanalysis of 25 randomised controlled trials (including 11 321 children and adults) found that vitamin D supplementation significantly reduced the risk of acute RTIs, with the available evidence assessed as being high quality. 100 Although a large number of randomised controlled trials have been performed assessing Echinacea and the common cold, 101 the weakness of trial methods and differences in interventions make it difficult to draw conclusions about its effectiveness in children.
