For this purpose, we have formulated and analysed a metapopulation model in which the individuals in each subpopulation are organised into a scalefree contact network. The long-distance travellers between the subpopulations will temporarily change the network structure of the destination subpopulation through the \"merging effects (MEs), \" which indicates that the travellers will be regarded as either connected components or isolated nodes in the contact network. The results show that the presence of the MEs has constantly accelerated the transmission of the diseases and aggravated the outbreaks compared to the scenario in which the diversity of the long-distance travel types is arbitrarily discarded. Sensitivity analyses show that these results are relatively constant regarding a wide range variation of several model parameters. Our study has highlighted several important causes which could significantly affect the spatiotemporal disease dynamics neglected by the present studies.",

            "text": "Modelling the spatial disease dynamics has long been a research priority because of its potential in facilitating the development of mitigation strategies responding to the increasing threat of an influenza pandemic [1, 2] . The largescale spatiotemporal spreading of diseases transmitted person to person via droplets or direct contact in real population is ultimately denominated by the population interaction which could be described by a social contact network and by interplay with the virus itself [3, 4] . Networks have provided a unified way to think about the daily interaction between individuals, are especially helpful when each individual is in direct contact with only a small proportion of the population [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] , and thus have been powerful tools for understanding the transmission of infection in the population due to either social contact or sexual contact. Several types of classical networks have been frequently used in epidemiological literatures, which are random networks [10] , lattices [11] , small world networks [12] , spatial networks [13] and scalefree networks [14] . Recently, researchers have incorporated demogeographic information into the contact network and integrated it with metapopulation model based on human mobility data [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] to pursue a better understanding of the role of real population structure and human mobility in the large-scale transmission of the diseases. The long-distance travel, which is the primary driving factor for the intersubpopulation pervasion of the contagion [20, 22] , has been explored a lot. However, when evaluating the risk of infection for long-distance travellers, present studies have arbitrarily neglected the travel types and assumed all the infectious individuals in targeted population will lead to equivalent risk to the travellers, which results in an underestimation of the risk.",

Several network models could be candidate contact networks with each leading to different epidemic dynamics. Alternatively, we could incorporate more realistic data into the construction of the contact network with synthetic population generated from the demogeographic information and then organised into different types of groups which are believed to be significant to the transmission of the diseases, such as household group and workgroup [24] . The workplaces have been reported to obey a power law distribution for the number of employees in most countries [15, 25] , so do the degree distributions of Portland's social networks [26] . Therefore in our model the individuals in each subpopulation are organised into a scale-free contact network [27, 28] .",

This simplification actually implies that homogeneous mixing assumption is made when quantifying the risk of infection for long-distance travellers; see Figure 1 (b). We have introduced the MEs into our model to investigate the influences of the travel types. Consider a susceptible from 2 who makes VFR or business travel to the epidemic area ( 1 ); then will enter into a specific group in 1 , denoted by 1 , as shown in Figure 1 (c). In this case, will be more likely infected by individual 2 than other infectives in 1 . Besides, owing to the higher transmission rate within groups, will also suffer from a higher risk of infection. When returns back, it may bring the risk of infection to 2 . Another situation which may put susceptibles in 2 into risk of infection is that an exposed or infectious individual travels to 2 . As shown in Figure 1 (d), infective makes VFR travel to 2 . Instead of leading to an equivalent risk of infection to every individual in 2 , this VFR travel will put individuals in 1 into a higher risk of infection than other susceptibles. This higher risk will then be transferred to community 2 through the overlapping individual . Thus the transitivity of the risk will contribute to the dissemination and transmission of the epidemics.",

If is a business or VFR traveller, the MEs say that it will merge into the contact network of the destination subpopulation, for example, 1 . The MEs take effects in the following two steps: first, randomly selects a node V from the contact network of 1 ; then all nodes \u2208 (V) and V itself will be added to ( ).

The infectious curves in Figure 4 (b) will peak earlier and higher with larger , which leads to the same conclusion. To quantify the accelerating effect, here we introduce the concept of the \"first passage time (FPT). \" Define the (0 < < 1) first passage time of the percentage of individuals in class as the first time step when the percentage of individuals in Class is less than or equal to , denoted by FPT 100 % . Figure 4(c) shows the variation of FPT 50% of the susceptibles of the two populations with different . The increase of has decreased the FPT 50% , indicating a more rapid decrease in the susceptibles. The FPT 100 % is a partial measurement which only involves the information from a single point. A more comprehensive measurement is the susceptible steps analogous to person years or person months which are widely used when performing certain types of prospective studies-studies following a large group of people over time. The person years or person months measurement takes into account both the number of people in the study and the amount of time each person spends in the study. Define the susceptible steps (SSteps) as the aggregate normalised susceptibles over the concerned time period as follows (for the continuous scenario, we could simply change the summation into the integration):",

A higher travel rate implies that there are more daily long-distance travellers between these interconnected subpopulations. Figure 5 shows the sensitivity analyses for ranging from 0.0001 to 0.001. We could find that the increase of the travel rate has accelerated the spatial pervasion of the epidemics, while it also leads to a higher escape rate (see Figures 5(a) and 5(c) ). The return rate will affect the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases in two ways. First, the return rate has an effect on the individual mobility between the interconnected subpopulations. A higher return rate implies that more individuals will return back to their resident subpopulations and thus refers to a higher human mobility. On the other hand, a higher return rate means that the duration of the longdistance travel (with mean duration 1/ ) will be much shorter and thus will decrease the probability of being infected and of infecting the others. So the aggregate influence of the return rate is uncertain, which is verified by Figure 6 .",
