The currently used live-attenuated vaccines have the tendency to mutate and/or recombine with circulating field strains resulting in the emergence of vaccine-derived variant viruses. In order to circumvent these issues, and to develop a vaccine that is more relevant to Egypt and its neighboring countries, a recombinant avirulent Newcastle disease virus (rNDV) strain LaSota was constructed to express the codon-optimized S glycoprotein of the Egyptian IBV variant strain IBV/Ck/EG/ CU/4/2014 belonging to GI-23 lineage, that is prevalent in Egypt and in the Middle East. A wild type and two modified versions of the IBV S protein were expressed individually by rNDV. A high level of S protein expression was detected in vitro by Western blot and immunofluorescence analyses. All rNDV-vectored IBV vaccine candidates were genetically stable, slightly attenuated and showed growth patterns comparable to that of parental rLaSota virus. Single-dose vaccination of 1-day-old SPF White Leghorn chicks with the rNDVs expressing IBV S protein provided significant protection against clinical disease after IBV challenge but did not show reduction in tracheal viral shedding. Single-dose vaccination also provided complete protection against virulent NDV challenge. However, prime-boost vaccination using rNDV expressing the wild type IBV S protein provided better protection, after IBV challenge, against clinical signs and significantly reduced tracheal viral shedding. These results indicate that the NDV-vectored IBV vaccines are promising bivalent vaccine candidates to control both infectious bronchitis and Newcastle disease in Egypt.",

The Open Access *Correspondence: ssamal@umd.edu 1 Virginia-Maryland Regional College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA Full list of author information is available at the end of the article S1 subunit is the most variable subunit that harbors the major neutralizing epitopes [8, 9] and the receptor binding domain (RBD) responsible for viral attachment and tissue tropism [5] . The S2 subunit is the most conserved subunit and is involved in mediating membrane fusion and viral entry [5] . The S2 protein also contains minor neutralizing epitopes and contributes to the avidity of S1 protein [10] . It has been shown that a tyrosine motif located in the cytoplasmic tail of the S protein is responsible for the intracellular retention [11] . This tyrosine residue is essential for productive virus infection [12] . However, the role of this tyrosine residue on induction of protective immune response by IBV S protein has not been studied.",

In the first recombinant, rLaSota/wt.S, the full chicken-codon-optimized sequence of the IBV S gene without any modification was inserted. In the second recombinant, rLaSota/S(Y1145A) + Fct 12 , the tyrosine residue present at position 1145 of the IBV S protein was mutated to Alanine (Y1145A) by PCR mutagenesis and the modified S gene was fused to the last 12 amino acids of NDV fusion (F) protein cytoplasmic domain using overlap PCR. In the third recombinant, rLaSota/ S\u0394ct + Fct 12 , the cytoplasmic tail of the IBV S gene was replaced by the last 12 amino acids of NDV fusion protein using fusion PCR technique. All the three forms of the IBV S gene were inserted as an independent transcription cassette flanked by the gene-start (GS) and gene-end (GE) sequences of the NDV and the \"rule of six\" was ensured in the final length of the recombinant NDV genome for efficient replication [42] . Briefly, the codonoptimized IBV S gene-preceded with GE, intergenic sequence (IGS), GS and Kozak sequences, and flanked by PmeI sites-was synthesized and cloned in pUC57 (pUC57-CO.S) by GenScript \u00ae (Additional file 1A). To construct rLaSota/wt.S, pUC57-CO.S was digested with PmeI (NEB), and the released insert was gel purified and ligated into full-length rLaSota clone which was predigested by PmeI and dephosphorylated by thermostable shrimp alkaline phosphatase (TSAP) (Promega). To construct rLaSota/S(Y1145A) + Fct 12 , primer sets (1 and 2) and (3 and 4) were used to induce the \"Y1145Amutation\" and add the last 12 aa of NDV F protein using pUC57-CO.S as template ( Table 1 ).

The fused PCR product was then digested by SmaI and StuI (NEB), and ligated into pUC57-CO.S which was predigested by SmaI and by StuI, its sequence is naturally present downstream to the S gene, to create pUC57-CO.S(Y1145A) + Fct 12 (Additional file 1B). To construct rLaSota/S\u0394ct + Fct 12 , primer set (1 and 5) was used to replace the cytoplasmic tail of IBV S protein by the last 12 aa of NDV F protein using pUC57-CO.S as template. The PCR product was then digested by SmaI and StuI and ligated into pUC57-CO.S which is predigested by SmaI and StuI to create pUC57-CO.S\u0394ct + Fct 12 (Additional file 1C).

Virus titers of the collected supernatant samples were determined by tissue culture infective dose 50% (TCID 50 ) titration assay. Briefly, dilutions from 10 \u22121 to 10 \u22128 of each sample were inoculated on to DF-1 cell monolayers in 96-well plates. Four replicate wells were used for each dilution. After 1 h of adsorption, cell monolayers were overlaid with DMEM containing 2% FBS and 10% normal allantoic fluid and incubated in 5% CO 2 incubator at 37 \u00b0C for 6 days. The TCID 50 was calculated according to Reed and Muench method [44] . To check the genetic stability, the three recombinant viruses were passaged 5 times in ECE and the presence of the different forms of the S gene was then checked by RT-PCR using OneTaq \u00ae One-Step RT-PCR Kit (New England Biolabs \u00ae , Inc) and DNA sequencing using BigDye \u00ae Terminator v3.1 cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, USA) in ABI 3130\u00d7l genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems).",

A live-attenuated vaccine belonging to GI-23 lineage may provide better protection against prevalent field strains, but development of a new live-attenuated vaccine is expensive and time consuming. Furthermore, a live-attenuated vaccine may revert to virulence, contributing to creation of new variant viruses [27] .

Although the three IBV vaccine candidates significantly reduced the severity of the clinical signs, they did not show reduction in tracheal viral shedding, which is another important criterion for determining the efficacy of an IBV vaccine. This result indicates that the immune responses elicited by single immunization may not be high enough to stop the virus shedding from the respiratory tract. It should be noted that IBV is a highly infectious and a fast replicating virus [49] . Therefore, it will require a high level of high affinity neutralizing antibodies and cell mediated immune response to completely block IBV replication in the respiratory tract, which is not achievable by live-attenuated IBV vaccine. Our results are in agreement with previous reports that rNDV expressing S protein prevent disease but do not stop virus shedding [40] . Another possible explanation is that the 1-day-old chicks may have immature immune system that could not have elicited a robust protective immune response after single immunization. It has been shown that vaccination of SPF chicks by IBV vaccines at day 1 of age, and to a lesser extent at day 7 of age, provided a poorly protective IBV specific immune responses, while vaccination at day 14 of age and older provided better protection against IBV challenge [50] .",

This could be because the IBV S protein in case of rLaSota/wt.S elicited more effective cell mediated immune response, which is crucial for clearance of the IBV from the respiratory tract [1, [51] [52] [53] [54] and also it has been reported that the humoral antibody titer does not correlate with the resistance to respiratory infection [1, 55, 56] . Another possible explanation is that the modifications done in the S protein of IBV in rLaSota/S(Y1145A) + Fct 12 and in LaSota/ S\u0394ct + Fct 12 could have changed the conformation of the IBV S protein and/or rendered loss of critical T cell epitopes necessary for effective blocking of IBV infection.

Furthermore, NDV-vectored IBV vaccine will protect both IBV and NDV. This vaccine will also benefit countries neighboring to Egypt, where antigenically similar IBV strains are prevalent.
