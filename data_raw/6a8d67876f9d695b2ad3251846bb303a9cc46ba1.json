[4] [5] [6] While the H5N1 outbreak illustrated rapid notification from the animal to human health sectors, the situation raised important questions about detection and reporting of potential human infections with avian influenza from hospitals. The existing IDSR and influenza surveillance systems in theory contributed to routine counting of SARI, ILI, and atypical respiratory cases; however, neither system reliably notified the MOH of suspected outbreaks in a timely way, despite specific instructions to do so within IDSR. During the H5N1 outbreak, it was unclear whether Yaound\u00e9 health facilities would recognize potential human infections with avian influenza, and if they did, whether the MOH would be alerted rapidly to initiate control measures. To improve timely detection and immediate notification of suspected outbreaks, the MOH, with support from the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), implemented an event-based surveillance (EBS) program focused on detection of unusual respiratory events in Yaound\u00e9.",

The participants included health facility focal points and clinicians and were taught by DLMEP, CPC, and LNSP representatives who had participated in the national-level training of trainers. The second course was focused on signal detection and reporting, and everyone received posters describing the four signals.

First, EBS does not require clinicians to follow a specific case definition, but rather encourages medical professionals to draw upon their clinical training and experience to recognize that something is unusual or unexpected. The signals in EBS are designed for clinicians to recognize patterns and unusual trends, in contrast to traditional surveillance case definitions, which are based on disease-specific identification (",

This entailed traveling to the healthcare facility to interview the clinician and patient to determine if the situation represented a threat to public health.Laboratory testing is not an essential component of EBS verification; however, the pilot had the capacity to include it. While at the healthcare facility, CPC/LNSP would collect nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal (NP/OP) specimens. Specimens were taken from all people involved in the signal. Following verification, if CPC/LNSP determined the situation as a public health threat, the signal was categorized as an event. After specimens were collected, all samples were immediately transported by portable cooler to the Virology Laboratory at CPC and analyzed according to a pre-defined algorithm. Specimens were first tested for influenza A/B viruses using in-house real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assays. Influenza-positive specimens underwent additional subtyping. Influenza-negative specimens were tested with a multiplex platform, the Fast Track Diagnostic 33 (FTD33; Fast Track Diagnostics, Luxembourg), a commercial rRT-PCR testing kit capable of detecting 21 respiratory viruses and 12 bacteria. Patients with negative test results underwent additional pathogen detection if the clinical circumstances warranted further investigation. To strengthen diagnostic capacity in preparation for EBS, as well as for general public health preparedness, CPC participated in an advanced training on rRT-PCR diagnostic techniques and the use of multiplex platforms hosted by CDC in July 2016 in Atlanta, Georgia. The FTD kits were provided free of cost through the International Reagent Resource (https ://www.inter natio nalre agent resou rce.org/).",

            "text": "This finding is consistent with EBS systems where triage and verification take place at healthcare facilities, such as in Ethiopia where 64% of EBS reports from health centers were verified and found to be true events.13 In Ratnayake et al, where community EBS was implemented for detection of Ebola virus disease, approximately 2% of signal alerts corresponded to a patient who met the case definition of suspected, probable or confirmed case.11 In our study, a large proportion of the reported signals were determined to be events, however, because clinicians and health facility staff are trained in health and medicine, their judgment of what constitutes a signal and when to report may represent an early type of filtering, reducing background noise.The implementation of EBS in health facility, however, was not without challenges. The pilot had an initial investment cost, including the cost of trainings, posters, phones, and phone credits as well as in-kind contribution of laboratory reagents from CDC. Additionally, after the pilot launch, signals were routinely detected and reported by the health facilities for the first 5 weeks. There was a drop in reporting after the initial weeks, which improved again following a DLMEP refresher training. A pattern of waning clinician engagement was observed, likely because of competing clinical demands and responsibilities. This illustrated that the relationship between health facilities and the public health system can be delicate, but that supportive supervision and feedback from the MOH can help to improve motivation. A reliance on supportive supervision for improved performance is noted in other surveillance systems.23,24 Fostering hospital engagement and relationships contributes to continued reporting and program sustainability. Another challenge experienced in EBS implementation was one of physical infrastructure. Telephone landlines are not commonplace in Cameroon, therefore the health facility staff lacked a reliable and free mechanism for reporting. Since 2010, the WHO has instituted a system of float telephones throughout the public health structure in Cameroon that are free of charge to users 25 ; however, these were not always available in pilot health facilities for the purpose of EBS. While this EBS pilot program provided mobile telephones and phone credit, this may be problematic on a larger scale since the MOH is not able to equip all health facilities within the country with a cellular telephone and phone credit. Lastly, during the pilot, both CPC and LNSP provided an important service in conducting triage and verification of reported signals. This role is typically the responsibility of public health epidemiologists, not laboratorians. However, in the context of this pilot and with limited public health human resources at DLMEP, both of these laboratories provided their services. Ultimately, EBS is most sustainable when it can be integrated into existing public health communication structures.Based on the experience gained from this pilot, DLMEP is scaling up EBS in health facilities in multiple regions throughout the country and plans to formally integrate EBS reporting into Cameroon's IDSR platform. Event-based surveillance is an essential capacity for a country to rapidly identify and appropriately respond to public health events. Event-based surveillance systems can be tailored to the specific needs of a country: designed broadly to detect all hazards, or with a particular focus, such as respiratory diseases in this pilot surveillance program.",
