For the time varying import rate, the parameters of the classic (SIR) epidemic model [1] are tuned such that its peak incidence of 4 infectious people per 100,000 per day occurs at around the 200th day. The amplitude of the epidemic import rate is set such that the total number of imports over 365 days is the same as in the case of a constant import rate. B shows the predicted disease incidence. Progression of the outbreak is similar in both cases once there are enough infectious individuals in the population. The shape of the import rate function has little impact on outbreak progression once widespread local transmission occurs.",
