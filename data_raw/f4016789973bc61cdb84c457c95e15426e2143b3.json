Among those, 2 cases suggested a causative role of HSV-1 as the sole agent causing pneumonitis that proved clinically responsive to antiviral treatment. In the remaining 4 cases HSV-1 appeared as a bystander of bacterial infection. Maintenance therapy with leflunomide, which inhibits HSV-1 assembly in vitro, was associated with a milder course of pneumonitis in one patient. Detection of HSV-1 was associated with stronger immunosuppressive regimens and vasculitic disease.",

HSV-1 pneumonitis is comparatively well investigated in critically ill patients under mechanical ventilation, where ~90% show an oropharyngeal reactivation of the virus within the first 10 days [5] . In a number of retro-and prospective studies in this setting presence of cytology-proven HSV-1 pneumonitis was shown to have a poorer outcome, but antiviral treatment was not beneficial [6] [7] [8] [9] . Immunosuppressed patients with malignancies, organ transplants, and cytotoxic treatments for various reasons are the other large, though extremely heterogeneous, group of patients that have been described to develop HSV-1 pneumonitis. Data on the disease in these subjects is more scarce and mainly consists of anecdotal accounts [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . Only one retrospective study of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) microbiology/virology results from renal transplant patients is available and, very recently, a retrospective study on HSV-1 pneumonitis in patients with solid tumors was published representing the first systematic approaches in the field [17, 18] . In view of lack of data, it was the goal of the present study to investigate the potential significance of HSV-1 pneumonitis in patients under a maintenance regimen of ambulatory immunosuppression. We therefore retrospectively analyzed admissions for pneumonia/pneumonitis in a comparatively large cohort of outpatients with rheumatoid, vasculitic and connective tissue autoimmune disease over a period of 8 years.",

Acute life-threatening respiratory failure associated with the detection of HSV-1 in the lower respiratory tract was a rare, but significant finding. Based on our findings, diagnostic virological workup in this particular patient cohort should include HSV-1 before starting, but without delaying treatment. In an area of controversy [19, 28] , we provide further evidence that immunocompromised patients may develop a condition that is most accurately described as HSV-1 pneumonitis and that appears amenable to treatment.",
