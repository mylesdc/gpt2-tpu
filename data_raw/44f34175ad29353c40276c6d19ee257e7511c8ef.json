            "text": "Background: Encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) can cause myocarditis, respiratory failure, reproductive failure, and sudden death in pre-weaned piglets, which has been isolated in China. EMCV VP1 protein was one of the most important structural proteins and played an important role in the protective immunity. In this study, 10 monoclonal antibodies (McAbs) against EMCV VP1 were screened and identified. Results: Epitope mapping results indicated that McAbs (6E11, 7A7, 7C9) specifically recognized the linear epitopes V(2)ENAEK (7), McAbs (1D1, 2A2, 5A1, 5A11, 5G1) recognized the epitope F(19)VAQPVY(25), and McAbs 1G8 and 3A9 recognized P(42)IGAFTVK(49). Protein sequence alignment of VP1 with 16 EMCV isolates indicated that the epitope F(19)VAQPVY (25) was conserved in all the reference strains. The epitopes P(42)IGAFTVK(49) and V(2)ENAEK (7) only had 1 or 2 variable amino acid among the reference strains. The 3D model analysis results showed that these epitopes presented as spheres were shown within the context of the complete particle. Conclusions: In this study, ten McAbs against EMCV VP1 were developed and three B-cells epitopes (2-7aa, 19-25aa and 42-49aa) were defined in VP1. All the results herein will promote the future investigations into the function of VP1 of EMCV and development of diagnostic methods of EMCV.",

Rodents are considered to be natural hosts of EMCV and are thought to be the primary reservoir and disseminators of the virus. Out of all domestic animals, pigs are the most susceptible to EMCV infection, which can cause severe economic losses on pig production due to high mortality in piglets as a result of respiratory failure [2, 9, 10] and in sows as a result of myocarditis and reproductive failure [11] [12] [13] .",

The ORF encodes for a polyprotein that comprises both non-structural and structural elements divided into three primary precursor molecules, namely P1, P2 and P3, encoding for 11 distinct proteins. The structural proteins VP4, VP2, VP3 and VP1 make up the viral capsid and are encoded in the P1 region towards the 5\u2032-end of the genome. The viral capsid proteins, in their capacity to interact with cellular receptors, are crucial for this entry step and may be considered to be factors that can modulate EMCV virulence [1] . The three major capsid proteins, VP1, VP2 and VP3 that constitute the external virion shell of picornaviruses, are considered to play a pivotal role in viral infection and host recognition [16] . Among them, VP1 is one of the most antigenic and can stimulate the organism to produce neutralization antibody [17, 18] .",

The criteria were judged as follows: the OD 450 of the positive control should be more than 1.0, the OD 450 of the negative controls should be lower than 0.2. The results were expressed as the ratio of OD 450 produced by the samples compared to the negative control. Samples, giving a ratio value higher than 2.1, were considered to be positive.",
