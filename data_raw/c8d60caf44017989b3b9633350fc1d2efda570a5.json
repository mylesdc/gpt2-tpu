Despite the nuisances they induce and their potential role as a zoonotic reservoir, knowledge on urban rat populations remains scarce. The main purpose of this study was to characterize an urban brown rat population from Chanteraines park (Hauts-de-Seine, France), with regards to haematology, population genetics, immunogenic diversity, resistance to anticoagulant rodenticides, and community of parasites. Haematological parameters were measured. Population genetics was investigated using 13 unlinked microsatellite loci. Immunogenic diversity was assessed for Mhc-Drb. Frequency of the Y139F mutation (conferring resistance to rodenticides) and two linked microsatellites were studied, concurrently with the presence of anticoagulant residues in the liver. Combination of microscopy and molecular methods were used PLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.",

Eighty-six rats were caught. The first haematological data for a wild urban R. norvegicus population was reported. Genetic results suggested high genetic diversity and connectivity between Chanteraines rats and surrounding population(s). We found a high prevalence (55.8%) of the mutation Y139F and presence of rodenticide residues in 47.7% of the sampled individuals. The parasite species richness was high (16). Seven potential zoonotic pathogens were identified, together with a surprisingly high diversity of Leptospira species (4). Chanteraines rat population is not closed, allowing gene flow and making eradication programs challenging, particularly because rodenticide resistance is highly prevalent. Parasitological results showed that co-infection is more a rule than an exception. Furthermore, the presence of several potential zoonotic pathogens, of which four Leptospira species, in this urban rat population raised its role in the maintenance and spread of these pathogens. Our findings should stimulate future discussions about the development of a long-term rat-control management program in Chanteraines urban park.",

They carry zoonotic agents including Leptospira sp., Rickettsia typhi, Yersinia pestis, Salmonella sp., and Seoul hantavirus among others [8] . Several characteristics make this synanthropic muridae an ideal candidate for maintaining and transmitting zoonotic pathogens: they live in close proximity to humans [2, 6] , they have a huge breeding potential [1] , and may live in dense populations [9] that enhances inter-individual contacts [10] . Substantial amounts of time and money are spent yearly to control rat populations. In Western countries, control of commensal rodents relies heavily on the use of anticoagulant rodenticides (antivitamin-K, AVK). Anticoagulant rodenticides were first introduced in the 1950s but resistance rapidly appeared in rat populations [11] and more effective AVK compounds, called \"second-generation\" anticoagulants, were developed during the 1970s and 1980s. The main mechanism of resistance to AVK in the brown rat is associated with mutations within the gene coding for the vitamin K 2,3-epoxide reductase enzyme (VKOR), located on chromosome 1 in brown rats [12] .",

Urban brown rats seem to show a strong site fidelity [14] with a relatively small home range. The axial dispersal distance of rats seldom exceeds 45-62 meters on ground [14, 18] , probably three to four times more within the sewer system [19] .

Manufrance live-traps (280x100x100 mm) were used, baited with a mixture of peanut butter, oat flakes, and sardine oil [25] . Traps were set in two sites: North (site 1) and South (site 2) (Fig 1) . Distance between the centroid of the two sites was approximately 700 m. Traps were spaced 20 m apart whenever possible given physical constraints of the landscape (Fig 1) . Geographic coordinates for each trap location were reported from a GPS device (Garmin eTrex1, precision 3-7 m). Since rat sightings were often reported during daytime hours, two trapping periods were organized, i.e. a night-time and a daytime session, covering all 24 hours of the day. Traps were checked twice daily, 07.00-11.00 (rats caught at night) and 18.00-21.00 (rats caught in the daytime), and baited as necessary. For each day and night of trapping, we recorded for each site the number of traps set, rats trapped, and traps sprung (e.g., traps sprung or damaged by people, trapping of non-target species).",

Peripheral blood smears were done for later examination.

If the number of helminths was < 30 per host, then all helminths present were individually identified, a subsample was used if the helminth count was > 30 per host. Nematode species identification referred to Ribas et al. [46] , del Rosario Robles et al. [47] , Durette-Desset [48] , Hugot and Quentin [49] , and Anderson et al. [50] . Cestode identification used Casanova et al. [51] , Makarikov and Tkach [52] , Gardner [53] , and Khalil et al. [54] . Trematode identification relied on to Pojmanska [55] for specimens assigned to the genus Brachylaima",

We found significantly higher levels of relatedness (p < 0.05) between geographically closer individuals. Relatedness values were systematically higher for females than for males for each distance interval considered (Fig 4) .

The best-fitted submodel 1 for Leptospira occurrence retained the single variable WBC count and the risk factor analysis showed that a WBC count ! 9.2 was significantly associated with a lower risk of Leptospira infection (Table 2) .",

This hypothesis is Table 2 . Model 1 results. Adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for pathogen occurrence in R. norvegicus from Chanteraines park calculated using the best-fitted general linear model identified using a stepwise backward selection on the Akaike Information Criterion. Genetics, community of parasites, and rodenticide resistance in an urban brown rat population supported by the high degree of LD between microsatellite loci and a relatively high genetic diversity (H e = 0.628 \u00b1 0.069). Increased linkage disequilibrium can originate from a recent mixing of individuals from several subpopulations that have different allele frequencies, a spatial structuring into several subpopulations, or a bottleneck event [80] . Based on genetic analyses, there was no evidence of a recent bottleneck or substructuring into several subpopulations in our sample. Accordingly, we suggest that LD may have been caused by a recent colonization of the park by genetically differentiated subpopulations followed by high mixing of individuals from these populations. As noted in Slatkin et al. [80] , the mixing of individuals from different subpopulations that have different allele frequencies creates LD and the decay of LD under recombination alone can be greatly retarded. High genetic diversity was unexpected considering the small area of study, the strong site fidelity, the aggregation of related individuals, and the small dispersion range typical of urban R. norvegicus [14, 81] . The genetic diversity of the Chanteraines population was nevertheless similar to what has been described in urban rat populations from Baltimore, USA (H e = 0.658-0.780) [14] and Salvador, Brazil (0.57-0.72) [15] . There was an excess of heterozygotes (negative F IS values in 9 out of 13 microsatellite markers) indicating probable outbreeding [82] . Furthermore, four first-generation migrants were detected, all males, most likely coming from outside Chanteraines park. Fine spatial-scale analysis of the genetic relatedness showed that the population was spatially structured in small demes of related females. These data indicated differential dispersal behavior between sexes, with females dispersing less than males at smaller distances (< 30 m). This strongly suggests a male-biased dispersal and female philopatry, in accordance with other genetic [14, 15] and ecological studies [83, 84] on brown rats.",

The low polymorphism observed at Mhc-Drb may imply lower resistance to pathogens [85, 86] and may relate to the high parasite diversity and burden in this rat population. We lack comparison data on other urban brown rat populations, however Rattus sp. from Southeast Asia, the area of origin of Rattus sp. [2] , had a much higher genetic diversity in Drb genes and microsatellite loci [30, 87] . Reduction in neutral (microsatellite loci) and adaptive (MHC loci) genetic diversity may originate from bottleneck events. It can also derive from one or several successive founder events (i.e. when a small number of individuals found a new population in a new area) and can occur in fragmented, small, isolated populations (such as urban populations which typically live in a fragmented habitat [88] ) where substantial genetic drift induces reduced genetic diversity [85, 89] .",

Warfarin and flocoumafen are not marketed in France and, as expected, no residues of these molecules were detected. AVK concentrations were widely variable, from 2 ng.g -1 , the lower limit quantifiable by the method, to 1,425.3 ng.g -1 . Most rats (30/41, i.e.73.2%) presented a total AVK residue liver concentration below the threshold of 100 ng.g -1 , considered as the lowest estimate for a no-effect concentration on blood coagulation in susceptible rats. Because second generation AVK can persist several months in rat liver [90] , high frequency of hepatic AVK residues can most likely be explained by a past exposure to rodenticides. Only three rats showed liver residue concentration > 100 ng.g -1 , which is capable of inducing a toxicological effect. Two Y139F/Y139F homozygous rats presented a difethialone concentration of 1,425.3 and 580 ng.g -1 . One heterozygous rat Y139F /-presented a brodifacoum liver concentration of 472.1 ng. g -1 .

Syphacia muris is primarily a rat-to-rat transmitted species [93] whereas H. spumosa is a parasite of rats, mice, and occasionally hedgehogs [94] . Similarities in the life cycles and transmission routes of these helminths can lead to their cooccurrence in the same host. For both species, infestation occurs through oral ingestion of infective embryonated eggs. However, H. spumosa is more typically a soil-transmitted helminth species (eggs are excreted in the feces) whereas female oxyurid nematode S. muris deposit its eggs on the perianal region of the host [95, 96] . Even though common factors may drive co-infestation by both species, our models did not show analogous risk factors of occurrence of these two helminths. These findings may reflect that other epidemiological factors influence the infection patterns of the two worms.",

The field work was conducted by rodent experts, and different baits were tested. However, despite these efforts, the number of captured rats was low. Rats in the Chanteraines park were known to be abundant and many visitors reported rat sightings during the day time. Administrative and financial constraints did limit the time dedicated to field work (the park was closed to the public during 12 days). Prebaiting could have enhanced the trap success but the trapping period was considered too short to include a prebaiting phase. Indeed, rats show neophobic behavior, particularly with unexpected objects [6] . However, if this avoidance is often overcome within a few days when resources are scarce [66, 103] , aversion to new food can be exacerbated when resources are abundant [81] . Rats in Chanteraines had access to food provided ad libitum to the zoo animals and/or refuse left by visitors. This may explain why rats did not explore the food sources in the traps and thus our low trap success.",

The severity of the diseases induced in humans and the risk levels of contamination are pathogendependent. A regular surveillance of rodent populations is essential to predict future disease prevalence and to identify emerging rodent-borne diseases. Moreover, some rat-borne parasites can be transmitted to the zoo animals and to domestic dogs (e.g., Leptospira sp.), and are therefore of veterinary concern. Rat abundance was lower in site 2 than in site 1 which may induce spatial heterogeneity in the risk of pathogen spill-over events. Trap success was higher during the day versus night, confirming visitor reports of daylight rat sighting, but surprisingly contradicting observations on R. norvegicus, considered as a nocturnal species mostly active at dusk and dawn [6] . Daytime rat activity increases the probability of encounter, and therefore the probability of direct disease transmission between rats and humans (or domestic animals), which represents an uncommon epidemiological situation [6] .",

Each method has advantages and disadvantages and a site-specific assessment should be made before implementing a rodent management program. Knowledge on rat biology, ecology, and genetic structure constitute an important foundation for developing an effective rat-control action [105] , in particular for the development of an ecologically-based rodent management program [106] .
