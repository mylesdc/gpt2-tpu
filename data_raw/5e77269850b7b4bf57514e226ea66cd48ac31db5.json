            "text": "The recognition of sialic acids by two strains of minute virus of mice (MVM), MVMp (prototype) and MVMi (immunosuppressive), is an essential requirement for successful infection. To understand the potential for recognition of different modifications of sialic acid by MVM, three types of capsids, virus-like particles, wild type empty (no DNA) capsids, and DNA packaged virions, were screened on a sialylated glycan microarray (SGM). Both viruses demonstrated a preference for binding to 9-O-methylated sialic acid derivatives, while MVMp showed additional binding to 9-O-acetylated and 9-Olactoylated sialic acid derivatives, indicating recognition differences. The glycans recognized contained a type-2 Galb1-4GlcNAc motif (Neu5Aca2-3Galb1-4GlcNAc or 39SIA-LN) and were biantennary complex-type N-glycans with the exception of one. To correlate the recognition of the 39SIA-LN glycan motif as well as the biantennary structures to their natural expression in cell lines permissive for MVMp, MVMi, or both strains, the N-and O-glycans, and polar glycolipids present in three cell lines used for in vitro studies, A9 fibroblasts, EL4 T lymphocytes, and the SV40 transformed NB324K cells, were analyzed by MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry. The cells showed an abundance of the sialylated glycan motifs recognized by the viruses in the SGM and previous glycan microarrays supporting their role in cellular recognition by MVM. Significantly, the NB324K showed fucosylation at the non-reducing end of their biantennary glycans, suggesting that recognition of these cells is possibly mediated by the Lewis X motif as in 39SIA-Le X identified in a previous glycan microarray screen.",

            "text": "Viruses serve as robust genome delivery vehicles evolved to utilize an array of intricate strategies for successful infection of target host organisms. The key initial step is virus attachment to cell surface receptors, followed by internalization into the cytosol, targeting, and release of the viral genome to the replication compartment. Proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids constitute receptors for many enveloped and non-enveloped viruses. Some serve as 'attachment factors' that concentrate virus on the cell surface and stimulate it to bind to secondary receptors or coreceptors that guide virus entry into cells. Glycans (complex carbohydrates) are the major constituents of the cell surface and may be conjugated to proteins or membrane lipid head groups to form glycoproteins and glycolipids, respectively, or are present as glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains attached within proteoglycans. The variability of the glycan structures between different species and between tissues in the same species as well as their exposed position at the cell surface makes these glycoconjugates excellent targets for virus attachment [1] . For most viruses that utilize glycan receptors, the binding is mediated by electrostatic interaction between the viral attachment protein and negatively charged sialic acid (SIA)-containing glycan determinants or sulfated portions of glycosaminoglycans. The virus recognition motif can be spike glycoproteins displayed on the lipid bilayer of enveloped viruses, or specific features, such as protrusions or depressions, conformed on the assembled capsid surface of non-enveloped viruses. The motif may be composed of a single protein or assembly of several proteins. The diverse interactions that occur between the viral pathogen and host, especially the recognition of cell surface receptors determines host specificity and tissue tropism. The pathway of entry into the cell and subsequent interactions influence the pathogenic outcome of infection.",

Bovine adeno-associated virus and human parvovirus B19 use gangliosides, adeno-associated virus serotype 1 (AAV1), AAV4, AAV5, AAV6, bovine parvovirus, H-1 parvovirus, porcine parvovirus, and minute virus of mice (MVM) use SIA, AAV2 and AAV3b use heparan sulfate proteoglycan, and AAV9 utilizes terminal galactose as a receptor [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . Sialic acid commonly occurs at the non-reducing termini of glycans linked within glycoconjugates and comprises a family of structurally diverse monosaccharides derived from neuraminic acid, a nine-carbon sugar. More than 50 natural analogues result from modifications to the SIA backbone [21] . In general, the C-5 position is either N-acetylated (N-acetylneuraminic acid; Neu5Ac), N-glycolylated (N-glycolylneuraminic acid; Neu5Gc) or hydroxylated (deaminoneuraminic acid; KDN). The hydroxyl groups on SIA can be free, esterified (acetylated, lactoylated, sulfated, phosphorylated), or etherified (methylated), leading to increased chemical diversity [22] .",

            "text": "Two strains of MVM, the prototype strain (MVMp) and the immunosuppressive strain (MVMi), serve as models for understanding the role of parvovirus capsid-SIA receptor interaction in infection. Previous studies, in which pretreatment of fibroblasts with neuraminidase or proteinase K abolished MVM infection showed that SIA-containing glycoprotein(s) are required for cellular recognition [7, 23] . This requirement was further confirmed by glycan microarray screening [24] . Nam et al. [24] showed that both MVM viruses specifically recognize a2-3 sialylated glycans with a type-2 Galb1-4GlcNAc motif (39SIA-LN) and a Lewis X Galb1-4(Fuca1-3)GlcNAc motif (39SIA-Le x ) with MVMi showing expanded recognition of multisialylated glycans with terminal a2-8 linkages. The two viruses share 97% sequence identity in the capsid viral protein (VP) amino acid sequence and are serologically indistinguishable. MVMp was originally isolated from a murine adenovirus stock and replicates efficiently in mouse fibroblasts such as the A9 cell line, whereas MVMi, which was recovered from an EL4 T-cell lymphoma, replicates in mouse T lymphocytes and hematopoietic precursors [25] . The viruses are reciprocally restricted for growth in each other's cell type. Cell binding assays show that both strains bind to and enter the restricted cell, but there is a block prior to replicative form DNA replication likely due to a block in uncoating which is dictated by the VP sequence [26] [27] [28] . Both viruses are however oncotropic and display oncolytic activity in vitro, and are both able to infect the transformed human cell line NB324K (SV40 transformed human newborn kidney fibroblast cells), suggesting that the restricting environment is eliminated in tumor cells. In vivo, following intranasal inoculation into newborn mice, MVMi is pathogenic and replicates in endothelia, neuroblasts [29] , and hematopoietic stem cells. In adult Severe Combined Immunodeficient (SCID) mice MVMi causes acute leucopenia [30] , while MVMp infection is asymptomatic [31] . The 39SIA-Le X motif, a known tumor cell marker [32, 33] , has been proposed as the mediator of transformed cell recognition by the MVM viruses and the interaction with the multisialylated a2-8 glycans, found in brain glycoproteins [34] , the mediator of MVMi's neurotropism.",

All the viruses bound to glycans with the 9-O-methyl SIA derivative with the MVMp viruses showing additional recognition of 9-O-acetyl and 9-O-lactoyl SIA derivatives. Both MVM strains also recognized biantennary glycans with terminal 39SIA-LN motifs. The data verified that the surface properties of VLPs are indistinguishable from those of wild type empty capsids and virions, and validates their use in lieu of infectious virions to study MVM interactions with host cell surface glycan receptors. Glycan profiling of cells reciprocally restrictive for MVMi and MVMp (A9 fibroblasts and EL4 T lymphocytes, respectively) or permissive for both viruses (NB324K), identified glycan compositions consistent with those recognized by the MVM capsids in the SGM and previous glycan microarrays [24, 35] . These observations indicate a potential role for the glycans identified by these solid-phase binding assays in cellular infection by the MVM viruses.",

Seventy-seven sialylated structures were generated incorporating 16 different terminal SIAs on 4 different underlying structures that were tagged with a fluorescent linker (Table S1 ). Each glycan was quantified based on its fluorescence and printed on NHS-activated glass slides in replicates of n = 4 to generate the SGM. The printed slides were washed and blocked with 50 mM ethanolamine in 0.1 M Tris-HCl buffer (pH 9.0) for 1 h, and prior to screening the slides were rehydrated for 5 minutes in TSM buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 0.2 mM CaCl 2 , and 0.2 mM MgCl 2 ). The virus samples were diluted with Binding Buffer (TSM buffer plus 1% BSA and 0.05% Tween 20) to give a final volume of 70-100 ml (0.05 mg/ml), which was added to the slide and incubated at RT for 1 h. The slides were then washed with Wash Buffer (TSM buffer plus 0.05% Tween 20), and an anti-MVM capsid antibody (Tatt-2; polyclonal from rabbit) was added at a dilution of 1:5,000. The slides were washed again with Wash buffer and incubated with Cy5-labeled-goat anti-rabbit IgG at 5 mg/ml. The slides were scanned with a Perkin Elmer ProScanarray microarray scanner equipped with 4 lasers and for Cy5 fluorescence, the wavelengths 649 nm (Excitation) and 670 nm (Emission) were used. The scanned images were analyzed with the ScanArray Express software to determine the average relative fluorescence units (RFU) and standard deviation (S.D) of the four replicates. In the output plot, the y-axis represents the average RFU and the x-axis represents 77 sialylated glycans and seven controls (LNnT, NA2, Man5, LNT, lactose, fetuin, and biotin, see abbreviations below), corresponding to chart ID 1-84. To analyze the results, all glycans were ranked according to their signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio by dividing the mean RFU from four replicates by the mean background generated in the control wells lacking sialylated glycans. Variation within the 4 replicates was assessed as the coefficient of variation (%CV), which was calculated as 100 6 S.D/Mean. Any value with a %CV of .30, was considered unacceptable as reported in Song et al. [40] .",

The recognition of similar glycans by full and empty capsids of each particular strain indicates that the encapsidation of DNA by the full capsids followed by its maturation, i.e. cleavage of VP2 to give VP3 [43] , does not affect its receptor binding ability compared to empty capsids, consistent with previous observations.

In addition, this hydrophobic methyl group is specifically preferred at position C-9 and not at C-8. This novel recognition is interesting, but its potential role in MVM infection is not known because this is a synthetic derivative that has not yet been observed in nature. Also, docking of a 3D model of a SIA glycan methylated at C-9 or C-8 of the glycerol side group into the MVMp SIA binding site localized to the icosahedral 2-fold region [23] did not provide any clues to this differential specificity (data not shown). The C-8 or C-9 of Neu5Ac in the MVMp-VLP-SIA complex structure is not in close proximity to any capsid surface amino acid residues that might affect the glycan binding interaction because the glycerol group points outward from the binding pocket (data not shown). MVMp and MVMi bound to the only Neu5Aca2-3 non-derivatized biantennary glycan on the SGM (SGM 48, Table S1 ). Thus while the signal was weak compared to the Neu5Ac methylated derivatives, recognition of SGM 48 suggests a strong preference for its structure which is consistent with the previous glycan array screenings [24, 35] . Significantly, this is consistent with the structures (based only on composition) observed in the cells that are permissive to MVM infections as determined by glycan profiling (Figure 4) .",

Significantly, SIA 9-O-acetylation is up-regulated (e.g., 9-O-acetylated GD3) in human melanoma cells [49] . The enveloped viruses bovine coronavirus (BCoV) and influenza c virus require 9-O-acetylated SIA containing receptor for a successful infection. These viruses possess an 9-O-acetyl esterase activity that promotes escape of virion progeny [50] . Thus it is possible that MVMp can also recognize and utilize this SIA derivative for the infection of cancer cells. The MVMp viruses also bound to the 9-O-lactoylated Neu5Ac derivative (SGM 60), which are present in serum glycoproteins [51] . A role for this interaction in MVMp infection is not obvious at this time. These additional MVMp interactions suggest that the surface properties of the MVMp capsid allows for the binding of SIA derivatives that are not recognized by the MVMi capsid and that the type of substitutions at position C-9 of the SIA dictated this extended recognition. However, despite the clustering of MVMp/MVMi amino acid differences at the 2-fold axis of the capsid [44] and based on the MVM-SIA complex structures currently available ( [23] , and unpublished data), the C-9 position of SIA derivatives is not involved in any capsid interactions, as discussed above. Thus a potential role for these recognition differences in dictating the MVMp and MVMi tissue tropism is not immediately evident and requires further study.",

The restricted infection of A9 cells by MVMi is thus likely not controlled by this glycan interaction. Previous experiments have shown that a SIA containing glycoprotein (and not glycolipid) is utilized as a receptor for MVM infection [7, 23] , but the glycan array utilized by Nam et al. [24] did not differentiate the origin of the GT3. Several recent studies have shown that a2-8 multisialylated glycans, especially GT3 and GD3, are present on glycoproteins in the mouse brain [34, [52] [53] [54] . Thus it is possible that MVMi viruses utilize an a2-8 multisialylated glycoprotein for infection in neuronal cells. Multisialylated glycoproteins with a2-8 linkages, such as Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule (NCAM), MCAM (melanoma cell adhesion molecule), and CD166 (or Activated Leukocyte Cell Adhesion Molecule (ALCAM)), are commonly found expressed on the neuronal cells and could serve as receptors for MVMi on these cells [53, 55] . A profiling of a mouse derived neuronal cell line would aid in validating the abundance of and the possibility that MVMi utilizes a2-8 linked glycans for neuronal cell infection.",

This similarity in glycan profile thus fails to explain the differences in tropism for these cells between these MVM viruses based on differential cell surface glycan receptor recognition. These observations support previous claims that the determinant of differential cell and tissue tropism for MVMp and MVMi is post cell entry [26, 28, 36, 58, 59] . These previous reports identified amino acids at and surrounding the depression at icosahedral 2-fold axes of the capsid, which differ between the viruses, as playing a crucial role in dictating these differences. The site reported for the MVMp-SIA interaction is a pocket flanking the 2-fold axis [23] . The observed similarity in glycan recognition by the two viruses suggests that the critical glycan interacting residue(s) is conserved. It is possible to envisage a scenario in which, following the initial capsid interaction with a cell surface glycan, an MVM strain specific interaction with a cellular host factor present only in the permissive cell line, initiates downstream events required for infection. These post entry interactions could also be under the control of similar glycan(s) on host cell specific glycoprotein receptors yet to be identified. These possibilities remain to be verified.",

The binding profile for VLPs, empty, and full particles was similar on the SGM which validates the use of VLPs in lieu of infectious virions for structural and biochemical studies that examine receptor interactions. Future directions include structural studies of the MVM virus complexed with the glycans identified in microarrays to elucidate the capsidreceptor interactions that likely dictate the similarities and differences observed for MVMp and MVMi. The glycomic profiling data correlates with the glycans that were recognized by the MVM viruses in a previous glycan screening and those identified in the current SGM, such as glycans with SIA-LN motif, SIA-Le x motif, the a2,8 multisialylated glycans, and the biantennary glycans. The abundance and variability of SIA containing glycans on these cell surfaces, makes them suitable receptors for numerous interactions, as exemplified by the large number of viruses, such as MVM, for which this interaction is essential for infection.
