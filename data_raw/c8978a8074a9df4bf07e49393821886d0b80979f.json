Further study is needed to understand the epidemiology of HMPV in the American Indian population. * Some patients had multiple underlying conditions. \u2020 Chronic lung disease included asthma, reactive airway disease, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or emphysema, or the requirement for home oxygen combined with other lung conditions such as chronic respiratory failure or pulmonary hypertension. \u00a7 Chronic heart disease included congestive heart failure, diastolic heart failure, coronary artery disease, aortic stenosis, and arrhythmias. Reports of isolated hypertension were not included. \u00b6 Immunocompromised patients included those with an immune deficiency, such as hypogammaglobulinemia, or those taking immunosuppressive medications. ** Includes continuous positive airway pressure or bilevel positive airway pressure.",
