This has been attributed to the ability of PRRSV to influence the induction of cytokine responses. In this study, we investigated the cytokine transcriptional profiles in different compartments of the mediastinal lymph node of pigs infected with three genotype 1 PRRSV strains of differing pathogenicity: the low virulence prototype Lelystad virus (LV), and UK field strain 215-06 and the highly virulent subtype 3 SU1-Bel isolate from Belarus. We have used a combination of laser capture micro-dissection (LCM) followed by real time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and immunohistochemical (IHC) detection of immune cell markers (CD3, CD79a and MAC387) and RT-qPCR quantification of PRRSV and cytokine transcripts. Compared to mock infected pigs, we found a significant downregulation of TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b1 in follicular and interfollicular areas of the mediastinal lymph node from 3 days post-infection (dpi) in animals infected with all three strains. This was accompanied by a transient B cell depletion and T cell and macrophage infiltration in the follicles together with T cell depletion in the interfollicular areas.

The main target of PRRSV are alveolar and other tissue macrophages, and to a lesser extent, monocytes and dendritic cells [13] . Absent or weak interferon alpha (IFN-\u03b1) secretion [14] and a consequent weak and delayed cell-mediated immune response with low levels of IFN-\u03b3 has been described following PRRSV infection [15, 16] . Pigs infected with PRRSV have also shown a delayed production of neutralizing antibodies [17] . PRRSV replication has been reported in lymphoid organs [18, 19] however studies have also shown a lack of homogeneity in proinflammatory cytokine responses [20] [21] [22] . This suggests a role for this tissue in the pathogenesis of PRRS but also highlights the need for comparative in vivo studies using PRRSV-1 strains which differ in their virulence. The porcine lymph node (LN) has a dense medulla, where T cells are predominant and which lacks sinuses and cords. The LN cortex is divided into two differentiated areas the follicles (F) and interfollicular (IF) areas. The F is a B cell rich area that also contains follicular dendritic cells (fDC) and CD4 + T helper cells that collaborate in antigen presentation to B cells and subsequent antibody production. The IF area is rich in T cells [21, 22] . It has been proposed that the immunopathogenesis of porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2) infection is associated with follicular changes in lymph nodes [23] , and it is suggested that this could also be the case for PRRSV infection.",

Each group was housed in separate rooms, which allowed the free airflow from the outside, and were allowed to acclimatise for 14 days prior to the experiment. Measures were taken to prevent cross-contamination between groups, including the change of clothes and equipment between each room. At seven weeks of age, 3 groups of piglets were inoculated intranasally with 1.5 mL of complete Roswell Park Memorial Institute medium supplemented with 10% FBS (cRPMI) containing 10 5 50% tissue-culture infective dose (TCID 50 ) of PRRSV-1 strain (LV, 215-06 and SU1-Bel, respectively).

In the present study the highest PRRSV RNA levels were detected in the IF area of Med-LN, which suggest that PRRSV was entering from the apical and medial lung lobes [32] to the Med-LN via draining lymphatics vessels. We have previously shown that for all PRRSV infected groups, the virus load in serum showed a peak at 7 dpi decreasing until 28 dpi, whereas in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) the virus persisted until 35 dpi [10] . Interestingly, despite its enhanced virulence the levels of virus in both circulation and BALF were lowest in SU1-Bel infected animals. In contrast, in the present analysis we have detected the higher levels for SU1-Bel in Med-LN compared with the subtype 1 strains, which suggest that this PRRSV-1 subtype 3 strainmay infect LN resident/transient cell populations more efficiently and this could be linked to the higher pathogenicity of this strain. In support of this data, the PRRSV N protein has been detected by IHC mainly in the cytoplasm of macrophages of the Med-LN of infected pigs from on 3, 7 and 35 dpi, with highest levels of immunolabelled cells found in SU1-Bel infected animals [43] . The use of LMD in the present study, enabled for the first time the measurement of PRRSV-1 RNA within different Med-LN compartments. The results showed the presence of PRRSV in the F of the Med-LN at 35 dpi albeit at low levels, according with a previous report that described the detection of infectious PRRSV in lymphoid tissues for several months [39] . We hypothesize that PRRSV may interact with fDC in secondary lymph organs, such as the Med-LN, and this could impair fDC presentation of PRRSV antigens to B cells, which could contribute to the lack of production of neutralizing antibodies detected in this [10] and other PRRSV infection studies. PRRSV presence in follicles of Med-LN and the non-neutralizing Ab secretion at 35 dpi suggest a role of fDC in the immunopathogenesis of PRRSV.",

The immune cell depletion in lymphoid tissues has recently been associated to apoptotic cell death indirectly induced in bystander cells by PRRSV infected cells [46] . We showed a T cell increase in the F, mostly at 7 dpi, that could be related to the migration of CD4 + helper T cells to the F area to assist the induction of B cell responses. During this study the macrophage population increased in the Med-LN, especially for the SU1-Bel group, which indicates that the SU1-Bel strain induces a higher inflammatory response in the lung than the other PRRSV-1 strains tested, in accordance with previous reports [9, 11] .",

            "text": "Production of type I IFNs (IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2) is critical to activation of the innate immune response against viral infection, as well as regulation of the induction of the adaptive immune response [47, 48] . We detected either no changes or lower IFN-\u03b1 transcript levels for all PRRSV inoculated groups, most noticeably at 7 dpi, which likely plays a role in delaying the onset of an effective innate immune Table 3 Correlations between 215-06 RNA and the gene expression of TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, SOCS1, IL-23p19, IL-10  and TGF-\u03b2   IFN-\u03b1  IFN-\u03b3  IL-23  SOCS1  IL- response [14, 49] . We showed that PRRSV can reduce the transcription of TNF-\u03b1 which would also impair innate immune response and to delay the adaptive immune responses [50, 51] . Interestingly, the IFN-\u03b1 and TNF-\u03b1 gene expression were positively correlated in LV infected pigs, both LV and SU1-Bel RNA levels were negatively correlated with the IFN-\u03b1 gene expression, and SU1-Bel RNA levels were negatively correlated with the TNF-\u03b1 gene expression. These results suggest that PRRSV downregulates these cytokine gene inductions at the site of infection, in agreement with previous studies [52] . These results also support the hypothesis that PRRSV-1 subtype 3 strains have developed the most efficient strategies to avoid the host immune responses among the PRRSV-1 genotype viruses. The upregulation of IFN-\u03b3 expression at 7 dpi is evidence of a delayed adaptive immune response in all PRRSV inoculated groups, as it has been previously described [53, 54] . During this study a positive correlation between IFN-\u03b3 gene expression and PRRSV LV and 215-06 strains suggests that PRRSV-1 subtype 1 induction of IFN-\u03b3 expression depends directly on the presence of virus. It has been described that SOCS proteins are a pivotal regulator in both innate and adaptive immune responses [55] . Specifically SOCS1 acts as a negative regulator of IFN-\u03b3 signaling, inhibiting the activation of STAT1 and thereby the expression of IFN-\u03b3 mediated genes [56] . SOCS1 induction in PRRSV vaccinated/infected pigs has been described [57, 58] , which suggests SOCS1 expression in infected cells may be a mechanism to evade the host immune response. Nevertheless, the positively correlation of SOCS1 and IFN-\u03b3 gene expression in the LV group could be a result of its negative feedback control system. Additional in vitro experiments may be used to elucidate the proposed SOCS1 induction by PRRSV during the initial phase of virus infection. The IL-23 protein is an IL-12p40-IL-23p19 heterodimer that is secreted by antigen presenting cells such as macrophages and DCs. This cytokine is necessary for the differentiation and survival of Th17 cells, which can induce a pro-inflammatory reaction and the secretion of TGF-\u03b2 [59] . In this study we did not detect IL-12p40 transcripts; this could be explained by the transcription kinetics of this cytokine being earlier or later compared with the tissue sample collection points. The IL-23p19 is a limiting factor to produce a biologically active IL-23 protein, as IL-23p19 is not secreted in the absence of the IL-12p40 chain [60] and the IL-23p19 induction Table 4 Correlations between SU1-Bel RNA and the gene expression of TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, SOCS1, IL-23p19, IL-10  and TGF-\u03b2   IFN-\u03b1  IFN-\u03b3  IL-23  SOCS1  IL- is typically lower than that of IL-12p40 [61] . In the present study, IL-23p19 was upregulated from 7 dpi, and this was statistically significant at 35 dpi in the F for all PRRSV groups, which suggest that PRRSV may modulate the cytokine environment to drive the differentiation of Th17 as opposed to antiviral Th1 cells. The IL-10 transcription levels showed considerable variation between PRRSV strains as previously described [62] . Therefore, this study supports the idea that the induction of IL-10 as a mechanism to delay the host immune response is not a common strategy among the PRRSV-1 genotype. The TGF-\u03b2 gene expression was either unaffected or downregulated in agreement with previous findings [63] , and this may explain why a positive correlation between TGF-\u03b2 and other cytokines were detected in this study.",

We have also provide further evidence that PRRSV-1 strains avoid the innate immune response in infected pigs through the downregulation of IFN-\u03b1 and TNF-\u03b1 in F and IF areas of Med-LN, and inducing a T and B cell depletion in the cortex of Med-LN.",
