            "text": "Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) causes respiratory diseases in humans and has a high mortality rate. During infection, MERS-CoV regulates several host cellular processes including antiviral response genes. In order to determine if the nucleocapsid protein of MERS-CoV (MERS-N) plays a role in viral-host interactions, a murine monoclonal antibody was generated so as to allow detection of the protein in infected cells as well as in overexpression system. Then, MERS-N was stably overexpressed in A549 cells, and a PCR array containing 84 genes was used to screen for genes transcriptionally regulated by it. Several up-regulated antiviral genes, namely TNF, IL6, IL8, and CXCL10, were selected for independent validation in transiently transfected 293FT cells. Out of these, the overexpression of MERS-N was found to up-regulate CXCL10 at both transcriptional and translational levels. Interestingly, CXCL10 has been reported to be up-regulated in MERS-CoV infected airway epithelial cells and lung fibroblast cells, as well as monocyte-derived macrophages and dendritic cells. High secretions and persistent increase of CXCL10 in MERS-CoV patients have been also associated with severity of disease. To our knowledge, this is the first report showing that the MERS-N protein is one of the contributing factors for CXCL10 up-regulation during infection. In addition, our results showed that a fragment consisting of residues 196-413 in MERS-N is sufficient to up-regulate CXCL10, while the N-terminal domain and serine-arginine (SR)-rich motif of MERS-N do not play a role in this up-regulation.",

Interferon treatment has been reported to effectively subdue MERS-CoV replication [16] ; however, like any successful viral infection, MERS-CoV has developed mechanisms to evade or dampen the activity of the host immune responses. Studies have demonstrated that MERS-CoV infection shows a delayed but marked induction of proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines [17] . In the present study, we aim to determine if the MERS-N protein is involved in regulating host antiviral response to infection. We showed that the MERS-N protein could contribute to the regulation of several host antiviral response genes including CXCL10. Importantly, up-regulation of CXCL10 has been reported in MERS patients [18, 19] as well as MERS-CoV infected cells [3, 17, 20] . To our knowledge, this is the first time that MERS-N has been shown to be one of the contributing factors for CXCL10 up-regulation during infection and this suggests that MERS-N may contribute to viral pathogenesis.",

            "text": "MERS-CoV has broad tissue tropism including lower airway, intestinal tract, liver, kidney, neuronal, monocyte, and T-lymphocyte cells [5, 22] . Upon infection by MERS-CoV, cytokine/chemokine regulations have been reported in airway epithelial cells and lung fibroblast cells [17] as well as monocyte-derived macrophages and dendritic cells [3, 20, 23 ]. In the present study, we showed that the overexpression of MERS-N protein in A549 (lung) and 293FT (kidney) up-regulated TNF, IL6, IL8, and CXCL10 on the transcriptional levels, suggesting that MERS-N protein may be able to regulate multiple antiviral genes in different tissues. On the protein level, the overexpression of MERS-N protein in 293FT also increased the secretion of CXCL10, albeit at low levels, but not TNF, IL6, and IL8. It is not clear that why the secretion of CXCL10 was low despite a robust up-regulation on mRNA levels by approximately 10-fold in MERS-N expressing cells, but one possible reason could be the low efficiency of cytokine/chemokine secretion from 293FT cells. Similarly, the overexpression of MERS-N protein in A549 cells also led to transcriptional and translational up-regulation of CXCL10. As MERS-CoV has been reported to infect immune cells, further studies could be performed to study the effects of MERS-N on the expression of antiviral genes in different types of immune cells.",

            "text": "CXCL10 is a cytokine belonging to the CXC chemokine family and binds to the CXCR3 receptor to induce chemotaxis, apoptosis, cell growth, and angiostasis. Expression levels of CXCL10 have been associated with inflammatory diseases including infectious diseases, immune dysfunction, and tumor development [19, 24] . High expressions of CXCL10 have been reported in individuals infected with pathogens including viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites [24] . CXCL10 regulation has been reported in MERS patients [18, 19] as well as MERS-CoV infected cells [3, 17, 20] . Our results suggest that the MERS-N protein is one of the contributing factors for CXCL10 up-regulation during infection. In addition, a fragment of MERS-N consisting of residues 196-413 is sufficient to up-regulate CXCL10. Future works will focus on identifying the exact motif in MERS-N that is contributing to the up-regulation of CXCL10, and delineating the relative contribution of MERS-N and different viral proteins to this up-regulation which may have implication for viral pathogenesis.
