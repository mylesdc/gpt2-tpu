The development of well characterized animal models of HTNV and PUUV infection is critical for the evaluation and the potential licensure of HFRS vaccines and therapeutics. In this study we present three animal models of HTNV infection (hamster, ferret and marmoset), and two animal models of PUUV infection (hamster, ferret). Infection of hamsters with a~3 times the infectious dose 99% (ID 99 ) of HTNV by the intramuscular and~1 ID 99 of HTNV by the intranasal route leads to a persistent asymptomatic infection, characterized by sporadic viremia and high levels of viral genome in the lung, brain and kidney. In contrast, infection of hamsters with~2 ID 99 of PUUV by the intramuscular or~1 ID 99 of PUUV by the intranasal route leads to seroconversion with no detectable viremia, and a transient detection of viral genome. Infection of ferrets with a high dose of either HTNV or PUUV by the intramuscular route leads to seroconversion and gradual weight loss, though kidney function remained unimpaired and serum viremia and viral dissemination to organs was not detected. In marmosets a 1,000 PFU HTNV intramuscular challenge led to robust seroconversion and neutralizing antibody production. Similarly to the ferret model of HTNV infection, no renal impairment, serum viremia or viral dissemination to organs was detected in marmosets. This is the first report of hantavirus infection in ferrets and marmosets.",

Andes virus (ANDV), an HPS-causing hantavirus, causes lethal disease in immunocompetent hamsters [6] , while numerous other HPS-causing hantaviruses including Sin Nombre Virus (SNV) and Choclo virus cause lethal disease in hamsters immunosuppressed with dexamethasone and cyclophosphamide [7, 8] . In contrast to HPS-causing hantaviruses, exposure of hamsters to HFRS-causing hantaviruses such as HTNV, PUUV, Dobrava (DOBV) and Seoul (SEOV) leads to asymptomatic infection, despite viral dissemination, even when immunosuppressed (Hooper Lab, unpublished data) [8] [9] [10] [11] . In these studies hamsters were exposed to high doses of HTNV and PUUV, far exceeding the infectious dose 99% (ID 99 ) for the virus. Development and characterization of a uniformly infective, low-dose challenge model, enhances the hamster model's usefulness in vaccine and therapeutic testing. In this report we present a low-dose hamster infection model for both HTNV and PUUV infected animals.",

In addition, they have recently been described as a disease model of two hemorrhagic fever viruses, Bundibugyo virus and Ebola virus [16, 17] , supporting viral replication without prior adaptation. Most hantavirusrelated human disease occurs by aerosolized transmission of the virus from the excreta or secreta of infected rodents [18, 19] , a model of viral infection for which the ferret is well suited. In this study we demonstrate that ferrets are capable of being infected by high titers of HTNV and PUUV, though aside from gradual weight loss infected animals exhibit no clinical symptoms or impaired renal function.",

However, the macaques' large size and cost limits their usefulness in therapeutic studies, especially when test article availability is limited, as is often the case in passive transfer studies. The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is becoming more popular for infectious disease studies. Its genetic similarity to humans, cost, relative safety, and small size make it an attractive alternative to traditional non-human primate species [21] . Marmosets have been used as a disease model for other viral agents including Dengue virus [22] , Hepatitis C virus [23] , influenza virus [24] , Lassa fever virus [25] , orthopox viruses [26] [27] [28] , Rift Valley Fever virus [29] , Eastern Equine Encephalitis virus [30] , and filoviruses [31] . In this study we demonstrate that exposure of marmosets to HTNV leads to asymptomatic infection characterized by high levels of neutralizing antibodies. This is the first report of hantavirus infection in marmosets.",

In human ANDV infected patients with ANDV antigen positive urine, samples had to be cultured in Vero E6 cells for between 16-22 days post infection before infectious virus was detected [44] . Patients infected with HFRS hantaviruses exhibit leukocytosis and thrombocytopenia during infection [45, 46] . At every time point post infection, EDTA-treated whole blood from HTNV and PUUV exposed hamsters was evaluated to determine if changes in white blood cell count or platelets occurred. No changes were observed (S4 Fig). To further characterize disease, tissue sections from HTNV i.m. infected hamsters were analyzed by IHC and H&E to assess viral localization and any pathologic changes (S5 Fig). No significant histopathological findings were noted in the kidney or brain. Splenic follicular lymphoid hyperplasia and hepatic extramedullary hematopoiesis in the liver were each noted in three hamsters. Both are seen in animals from later time points in the study (days 17-28) and likely represent a reaction to HTNV infection, though other unidentified antigenic stimuli cannot be ruled out. Five hamsters between days 4 and 17 post infection exhibited a minimal to mild inflammation of the pericardium, characterized by a mixed lymphoplasmacytic histiocytic and neutrophilic infiltrate. Occasional macrophages in the inflammatory infiltrate within the pericardium are immunopositive suggesting a possible association with HTNV; however, no evidence of cardiac tissue injury is associated with the presence of HTNV antigen. Beginning on Day 4 post infection 66% (12/18) hamsters exhibit minimal (likely subclinical) respiratory lesions consisting of interstitial neutrophilic and histiocytic infiltrates in the lungs, with 44% (8/18) also exhibiting minimal amounts of alveolar edema. An additional hamster had minimal alveolar edema but not pulmonary infiltrates. Such findings suggest a response to antigenic stimulus and the presence of immunopositive endothelial cells, pneumocytes and alveolar macrophages suggest a response to HTNV infection.",

            "text": "No published studies detail if ferrets are susceptible to hantavirus infection. To examine this, four ferrets were exposed to either 2,000 PFU HTNV or PUUV K27 i.n. No seroconversion occurred within 35 days post infection. The same animals were re-exposed to either 200,000 PFU HTNV, 94,000 PFU PUUV Beaumont (a human PUUV isolate) or 164,000 PFU PUUV Seloignes (a vole PUUV isolate) by i.m. Prior to the re-exposure one of the seronegative ferrets in the HTNV group was removed for health concerns (rapid weight loss) unrelated to the study, and it's cage mate was subsequently removed for behavioral health reasons before the completion of the study. Data from those two ferrets are not shown. As soon as three days post infection ferrets began to lose weight with HTNV infected ferrets losing between 5-12% of peak body weight as did PUUV infected ferrets (Fig 5A-5C ). By Day 35 post infection all animals had developed antibodies against all strains of the virus as measured by N-ELISA assay (Fig 5D-5F ). Neutralizing antibody development began as early as Day 14 post infection and all ferrets developed neutralizing antibodies by Day 28 post infection (Fig 5G-5L) . EDTA The organs of infected ferrets were analyzed for viral load by RT-PCR and for the presence of infectious virus by plaque assay. The lung, liver, spleen, intestine and urine of HTNV infected ferrets were negative for viral genome, with small amounts (<2 log 10 ) detected in the heart and spleen of a single animal (S7B Fig). The heart, lung, kidney, intestine and urine of PUUV infected ferrets were negative for viral genome, though small amounts were detected in the liver (2/4) and spleen (1/4) of PUUV infected ferrets (S7C and S7D Fig) . Viral genome was spiked into the assay to confirm that the lack of signal was not due to the presence of inhibitors. All organs except for the intestine (4/6) had no inhibition of RT-PCR product. Similarly, no infectious virus was found in the organ of any ferret by plaque assay, despite spiked-in virus exhibiting no significant inhibition (S9 Fig). To confirm that immunosuppression of uninfected ferrets did not result in rapid weight loss, four healthy ferrets were immunosuppressed with a loading dose of 30 mg/kg Cyp followed by 10 mg/kg Cyp maintenance doses every other day (S10A Fig). Five days post immunosuppression ferrets exhibited rapid weight loss, fever, and lethargy due to secondary infection (S10B & S10C Fig) . Immunosupression was discontinued and 5 mg/kg enrofloxicin (a broad spectrum antibiotic) was given twice daily for a week. During this time, ferrets began to gain weight and their fever diminished. On Day 11 immunosupression resumed for two doses with prophylactic enrofloxicin given once daily. Even with prophylactic antibiotics two ferrets spiked fevers within a few days post the second round of immunosuppressive treatment, though they did not lose weight (S10B & S10C Fig) . Based on these results the rapid weight loss and clinical signs observed upon immunosuppression of HTNV and PUUV infected ferrets was most likely due to secondary infection. Due to the inability to completely manage secondary infection with prophylactic antibiotic treatment, no further immunosuppression studies were carried out in ferrets.",

All three animals seroconverted by Day 21 post infection (Fig 8A and 8B ) despite displaying no clinical signs of illness. Neutralizing antibody production began around the same time, and was robust by Day 30 post infection (14, 557 by PsVNA 50 and 10,240-20,480 by PRNT 50 ) (Fig 8C and 8D ). Due to low volumes of blood drawn at each time point serum viremia could not be examined for each individual animal, however a pool of sera from all three animals was evaluated at each time point post infection. Low levels of serum viremia were detected between days 14 and 28 post infection by RT-PCR ( Fig 8G) . As with the ferret infection model of HFRS-causing hantavirus, no renal injury as measured by changes noted in blood urea nitrogen or serum creatinine were observed over the course of infection, nor were changes in any of the other serum parameters monitored (S16 Fig). Animals were euthanized on Day 30 post infection to examine organs for viral dissemination. No infectious virus or viral genome was detected in the heart, lung, liver, spleen, kidney, intestine or brain (S17 and S18 Figs). Lymphoid hyperplasia was noted in all three animals by histology, though the location and intensity varied between the spleen, various lymph nodes and gut associated lymphoid tissue. Such hyperplasia is indicative of a response to antigenic stimulation and was most likely caused by the viral challenge. Mild to moderate congestion Three HFRS-associated hantavirus infection models was also seen in the lungs of each marmoset; however, this was an acute change and was most likely associated with terminal anesthesia and euthanasia. No other significant histological lesions were noted in any of the three animals (S19 Fig).

Additionally, the ability of passively administered neutralizing antibodies has been evaluated in the high-dose hamster model of HTNV and PUUV and in PUUV challenged cynomolgus macaques PUUV [50, 51] . Both of these models have limitations; the size of the macaque requires large quantities of passive transfer material, and the high dose of the hamster model, with challenge doses of~650 ID 99 , could require prohibitively large volumes of test article to neutralize the high initial dose. Suckling mice, which present with a disseminated disease not reminiscent of HFRS, have been used to evaluate HTNV therapeutics as well [52] [53] [54] [55] . In this paper we present three adult animal models of HFRS-causing hantavirus infection than can be used for future evaluation of therapeutics, biologics and vaccines.",

Also similar is that the challenge dose of ANDV required to infect/kill 50% of hamsters by the i.n. or intragastric route is~10-30 fold higher [56] . Previous reports also demonstrate that PUUV is capable of infecting hamsters by the intragastric route, with an ID 50 of >10,000, making it a much less effective route of infection [57] . Despite similarities in their ID 50 's, the ID 99 's of HTNV and PUUV greatly diverge, with~200 times less HTNV required to infect hamsters via the i.m. route, and~2 fold less required to infect via the i.n. route ( Table 1 ). The lower ID 99 doses, coupled with viral persistence in HTNV infected animals as opposed to viral clearance (Fig 3) , suggest that HTNV is more infectious than PUUV in the hamster. The mechanism for this difference between these closely related hantaviruses remains unknown.",

Asymptomatic infection of hamsters with SNV repeatedly passaged through hamsters has a similar organ distribution [58] . The organ distribution of both those viruses is similar to the low dose HTNV hamster model, with two notable exceptions. First, the HTNV model has low, transient levels of virus in the liver and hardly any virus in the spleen (Figs 3 and 4) . This dissimilarity between the models led us to confirm the lack of virus in the spleen was not due to the presence of inhibitors by spiking either infectious virus or viral RNA into samples prior to evaluation (S2 Fig). Second, in the ANDV model, the presence of virus was determined by plaque assay, indicating the virus was infectious and replication competent. In the HTNV low dose hamster model, while there is detection of high levels of viral genome (and in the case of the HTNV i.m. model, by pathology) by RT-PCR, recovery of infectious virus is sporadic, typically occurring at low levels, in only a few hamsters per time point (Figs 3 and 4 , Table 1 ). The discrepancy between RT-PCR/pathology and plaque assay is notable. The hamsters in this study were not perfused, and given the appearance of neutralizing antibodies as early as day XX post infection, the presence of these antibodies could be impairing out ability to recover live virus via the plaque assay. It is also possible that viral packaging is somehow impaired in the hamster, leading to a larger amounts of nucleocapsid protein and viral genome than live virus. Further studies need to be undertaken to elucidate.",

In comparison to the hamster, the ferret is far more resistant to HTNV and PUUV infection. Exposure of ferrets to 2,000 PFU i.n. (greater than the ID 99 for both viruses in hamsters), failed to result in a productive infection and seroconversion. Instead i.m. challenge doses of~100,000-200,000 PFU were needed (Fig 5) . Initially ferrets were exposed to PUUV K27, a commonly used laboratory isolate that has been in cell culture for over 15 years. Repeated passaging of hantavirus is known to cause mutations [63] [64] [65] . In contrast PUUV Beaumont and Seloignes are relatively recent isolates, with no more than 3 passages in cell culture post isolation. These strains were used for all subsequent experiments to maximize the likelihood of PUUV to cause disease by eliminating possible attenuation of the laboratory strain of the virus. Despite the high challenge dose and use of recent isolates, no elevation in white blood cells was observed over the course of the experiment, no pathology or organ burden was detected at the conclusion of the experiment, and the N-ELISA specific OD sum, PRNT 50 , and PsVNA 50 titers remained low (Figs 6 and 8 and S9 Fig) . This outcome is almost identical to that of Marburg and Ravn virus infection in ferrets, where the development of neutralizing antibody titers was the only sign that productive infection occurred [66] . Previous experiments in hamsters, have demonstrated that 2x10 5 PFU of gamma-irradiated ANDV and SNV are not sufficient to cause seroconversion, and neither is 1x10 4 gamma-irradiated PFU PUUV [6, 57] . Thus the seroconversion observed in ferrets, though low, is not likely to be due to a reaction to the large quantity of antigen administered, but to a productive infection.",

Acute kidney injury and vision disturbances including blurred vision, myopic shift, and lens thickening, while pulmonary involvement including pleural effusion and vascular congestion, and renal failure occurred less frequently [47, [71] [72] [73] [74] . Given the lack of high neutralizing antibody titers, which could have aided in viral clearance, the lack of viral genome in any of the ferret organs examined is rather surprising (S6, S7, S11 and S12 Figs). Furthermore, the lack of viral antigen and pathology in the organs tested suggest either a transient infection cleared prior to Day 35 post infection, levels of virus so low as to be undetectable by the tests used, or a viral reservoir outside of the organs tested.",

However, no prolonged signs of clinical kidney failure were observed: blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels did not dramatically increase over the five week study period. Only one animal exhibited proteinuria (day 35), and two exhibited hematuria (one on Day 4, and one on Day 21) (Fig 7) .

The ferret's large mass, even as an adolescent, makes the amount of test article needed also prohibitively large. The large challenge dose required for infection could potentially obscure the protective effect of drugs of vaccines, due to the overwhelming amount of virus administered. Moreover, although the animals are infected the resultant neutralizing antibody titers are small, resulting in potential sensitivity issues with the model. Husbandry and handling of the animals under ABSL-3 procedures is also substantially more difficult than hamsters, and they lack the genetic similarity to humans that marmosets possess.",

Marmosets represent an attractive model for testing vaccines and therapeutics against HFRS-causing hantaviruses due to genetic similarities to humans and small size. Also, the model has a simple read-out of infection, i.e. robust antibody production as measured by N-ELISA and PsVNA, making the determination of protection by vaccine or passive transfer material, straightforward. Further optimization of the model, namely to determine the ID 99 , could prove important as a 1,000 PFU challenge dose could be excessively high and prohibit therapeutic effects of candidate medical countermeasures.",

Like the ferret, no significant pathological abnormalities were noted, and no signs of renal failure were observed (S16 and S19 Figs). Serum chemistry values do not differ from the normal range with the exception of albumin, total bilirubin, and amylase. While these values fell outside the normal range, they did not change over the course of infection indicating the problem may lie in the reference values used. The Piccolo general chemistry panel used to evaluate the parameters is optimized for human testing, and therefore may be less than optimal for evaluating the marmoset, especially those parameters. Additionally, no infectious virus or viral genome was recovered from any organ at Day 30 post infection [79, 80] . This is not surprising, given the high levels of neutralizing antibodies present as early as 21 days post infection (Fig 8) . Unlike the ferret, however, marmosets develop exceptionally high neutralizing antibody titers (10,240-20,480 by PRNT 50 and 14,866-221,557 by PsVNA 50 ), and display low-level serum viremia between two and four weeks post infection (Fig 8) . The serum viremia is significantly lower than in hamsters infected with HTNV, where some animals displayed RT-PCR titers of >7log 10 , and in hamsters infected with ANDV, where infectious virus titers prior to death are > 6log 10 [41].",

These models, especially the hamster model and marmoset model, will be useful for evaluating medical countermeasures with the potential to induce sterile immunity. The marmosets should be particularly useful for the evaluation of passively transferred protective human antibodies because of the relative genetic similarities between species in the Order Primates, and the small size of marmosets, allowing testing with smaller volumes of material than would be required for larger species such as macaques. . Heart, lung, liver, spleen, kidney, and intestine were collected and assayed by plaque assay for the presence of infectious virus (A). To confirm lack of virus recovered was not due to inhibitors, virus was spiked into serial dilutions of organ homogenate to confirm no inhibitor was present (B).
