Previously, we established a human DPP4 transgenic (hDPP4-Tg) mouse model in which we studied complement overactivation-induced immunopathogenesis. Here, to better understand the pathogenesis of MERS-CoV, we studied the role of pyroptosis in THP-1 cells and hDPP4 Tg mice with MERS-CoV infection. We found that MERS-CoV infection induced pyroptosis and over-activation of complement in human macrophages. The hDPP4-Tg mice infected with MERS-CoV overexpressed caspase-1 in the spleen and showed high IL-1\u03b2 levels in serum, suggesting that pyroptosis occurred after infection. However, when the C5a-C5aR1 axis was blocked by an anti-C5aR1 antibody (Ab), expression of caspase-1 and IL-1\u03b2 fell. These data indicate that MERS-CoV infection induces overactivation of complement, which may contribute to pyroptosis and inflammation. Pyroptosis and inflammation were suppressed by inhibiting C5aR1. These results will further our understanding of the pathogenesis of MERS-CoV infection.",

Activation of caspase-1 relies on assembly of inflammasome complexes, which contain NLRP1b, NLRC4, NLRP3, and AIM2. Different inflammasomes are activated by different pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) or danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) via particular pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). The best-characterized inflammasome is the NLRP3 inflammasome, which responds to a variety of bacterial, viral, and fungal agents [5, 6] , DAMPs (e.g., ATP, monosodium urate crystals, and amyloid-\u03b2 aggregates) [7, 8] , and even environmental and industrial particles such as silica and asbestos [9] . The NLRP3 inflammasome comprises the NLRP3 scaffold, the ASC (PYCARD) adaptor, and pro-caspase-1. The activated NLRP3 inflammasome promotes transformation of pro-caspase-1 to its active form, which proteolytically cleaves gasdermin D, pro-IL-1\u03b2, and pro-IL-18 to yield their bioactive forms. The N-terminal domain of cleaved gasdermin D perforates the cell membrane, resulting in osmotic lysis [10] , whereas mature IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 act as proinflammatory cytokines [11] .",

Complement is activated via three pathways: the classical, lectin, and alternative pathways. During the process of activation, an enzyme named C3 convertase cleaves C3 to C3a and C3b, which are recruited to the C3 convertase to form the C5 convertase. C5 convertase catalyzes cleavage of C5 to C5a and C5b to initiate the terminal complement pathway, resulting in formation of the membrane attack complex, which has pore-forming properties. During this process, two split products, C3a and C5a (known as anaphylatoxins), promote inflammation or serve as chemoattractants by engaging their cognate receptors [14, 15] .",

To evaluate the response of macrophages to MERS-CoV infection, we inoculated THP-1 monocytic cells and THP-1 differentiated macrophages with MERS-CoV or RPMI 1640 medium (sham-infection). We then examined expression of NLRP3, pro-caspase-1, and pro-IL-1\u03b2 24 h later by RT-qPCR. As shown in Figure 1 , MERS-CoV infection induced relatively higher expression of pro-caspase-1 ( Figure 1A ) and pro-IL-1\u03b2 ( Figure 1B ), but not NLRP3 ( Figure 1C ), in both THP-1 monocytes and macrophages.

Here, we used an anti-C5aR1 Ab to block the C5a-C5aR1 axis. The antibody was administered at the same time as MERS-CoV infection. We then measured expression of caspase-1 in the spleen and IL-1\u03b2 in the lung and serum. Compared with the PBS-treated group, mice receiving the anti-C5aR1 Ab expressed less caspase-1 in the spleen at Day 7 post-MERS-CoV infection ( Figure 5A ). Although there was no significant difference between the two groups with respect to pro-IL-1\u03b2 mRNA expression ( Figure  5B ), serum levels of IL-1\u03b2 were lower in the anti-C5aR1 Ab-treated group than in the PBS-treated group at Day 1 ( Figure 5C ) and Day 3 [16] post-MERS-CoV infection. These results suggest that complement inhibition decreased the expression of pyroptosis indicators, IL-1\u03b2 and caspase-1, in mice infected with MERS-CoV. ",
