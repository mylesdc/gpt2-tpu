We propose to randomize 80 critically ill adults with a moderate to high index of suspicion for H1N1 infection who require mechanical ventilation and have received antiviral therapy for \u2264 72 hours. Site investigators, research coordinators and clinical pharmacists will be blinded to treatment assignment. Only research pharmacy staff will be aware of treatment assignment. We propose several approaches to informed consent including a priori consent from the substitute decision maker (SDM), waived and deferred consent. The primary outcome of the CHAT trial is the proportion of eligible patients enrolled in the study. Secondary outcomes will evaluate adherence to medication administration regimens, the proportion of primary and secondary endpoints collected, the number of patients receiving open-label statins, consent withdrawals and the effect of approved consent models on recruitment rates.",

Seasonal influenza is responsible for more than 50,000 deaths per year in the United States [2] . The capacity of the influenza virus to mutate and spread from animals to humans has resulted in intermittent pandemics. The 1918 pandemic was the largest in recent history and caused between 40 and 50 million deaths worldwide [3] . Smaller pandemics in 1957 and 1968 were associated with mortality spikes but their effects were mild at the population level [4] . Experts believe further pandemics will certainly occur, but are uncertain about when. Several years ago, the avian H5N1 influenza virus threatened to be the vector of the next pandemic. While highly virulent when transmitted from infected chickens to humans, the absence of human-to-human transmission resulted in a small number of cases worldwide [5] .",

Originating in Mexico, the strain proved highly infectious and was spread by person-to-person contact with a predilection for younger hosts. While early epidemiologic data suggested that although H1N1 was highly infectious, it was less virulent [7, 8] than anticipated with a case fatality rate of approximately 0.5% of infected individuals. For the majority of infected individuals, symptoms were mild and selflimited; however, a small percentage of infected individuals developed profound respiratory failure requiring extraordinary means of oxygenation support including high frequency oscillation (HFO) ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) [9] . Caring for the most severely ill patients during a pandemic results in an increased need for intensive care unit (ICU) resources and strains available personnel and equipment.

Their utility in treating severe pandemic H1N1 influenza may be compromised by widespread use and emergence of viral resistance [10, 11] , limited supplies, policies regarding treatment strategies, and cost and availability, especially in developing countries [12] . Human and animal data suggest that the course of influenza may be favorably influenced by certain agents not classically considered as treatments for influenza [13] [14] [15] [16] that are comparatively inexpensive and readily available.

Multiple observational studies have suggested that statins may be of benefit in patients with a variety of severe infections [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] by exerting an effect in attenuating inflammation [23, 24] . The mechanism of this activity is uncertain but may involve their ability to restrict cholesterol availability in cell membranes of the innate immune system. Cholesterol is a key component of lipid rafts, membrane-associated microdomains that support cell signaling in response to exogenous inflammatory stimuli. Raft disruption may attenuate the cellular response to inflammatory stimuli [25, 26] .",

The combination of a statin and caffeine inhibits viral replication and attenuates lung injury in murine influenza models [29] . Population-based studies suggest that statins are associated with reduced inflammatory morbidity in critically ill patients receiving them [20] and reduced mortality in patients with influenza and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients [30] . Reviewing 3,921 hospitalized patients with laboratory confirmed influenza, of whom 1,019 were receiving a statin at the time of admission, Vandermeer and colleagues found that statin use was independently associated with a reduced risk of death (adjusted OR = 0.34, 95% CI: 0.16-0.70) in a multivariable logistic regression model [31] . The benefits of statins appear to be best established in patients receiving them prior to the onset of infection. Cohort studies report conflicting results on the ability of statins to attenuate organ dysfunction with Schmidt and colleagues finding that statins reduce mortality in critically ill patients with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome [32] and Kor et al reporting that statin use was not beneficial in resolving organ dysfunction [33] .",

As a result, it exhibits fewer drug-drug interactions, and serum concentrations are not affected by CYP2D6 gene polymorphism. Adverse events seen with rosuvastatin are generally mild and may include muscle symptoms, however, myopathy and rhabdomyolysis occur infrequently in patients taking 40 mg/day or less. As with other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, a dose-related increase in liver transaminases and creatinine kinase (CK) has been observed in small numbers of patients taking rosuvastatin. The overall occurrence of clinically significant transaminase increases is low (< 1%) and similar across rosuvastatin doses ranging from 5 mg/day to 40 mg/day [35] . Patients with severe liver disease may have increased exposure to rosuvastatin [35] .",

Early reports supported that aboriginal populations in Canada and Australia, obese individuals and women, especially pregnant women, appear to have a predilection for severe disease. Unlike the pandemic of 1918, the availability today of antiviral agents, antibiotics for secondary infection, and ICU supportive care interventions holds promise that the majority of patients with severe illness can be saved. The burden of severe H1N1 disease falls prominently on the ICU [8, 38] .

Second, the scope and duration of the pandemic is unknown and unpredictable. Third, the mitigating effects of large-scale vaccination programs and changes in H1N1 infectivity resulting from virus mutation are unknown. Fourth, the practicalities of conducting clinical research during a pandemic are unknown. For example, research personnel may be seconded to provide clinical care, pharmacists may face challenges in dispensing drug and placebo, REBs may not permit alternative consent models and it may be difficult to obtain consent from patients who may lack decision-making capacity and families, who may be unwell themselves, unable to visit the hospital or requested to stay away during the pandemic. Finally, faced with the clinical imperative of treating gravely ill and previously well, young patients, clinicians may opt to use open label treatment rather than permit enrolment into a blinded RCT. Because we believe that it is important to develop the capacity to initiate RCTs under pandemic conditions and to test study procedures prior to implementing a large scale RCT, we propose to conduct a multi-centre pilot trial to assess the feasibility of our clinical protocol and study procedures.",
