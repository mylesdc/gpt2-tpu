Since no specific therapy is available thus far, there is an urgent need for the discovery of agents capable of inhibiting its viral replication and deleterious effects. Chloroquine is widely used as an antimalarial drug, anti-inflammatory agent, and it also shows antiviral activity against several viruses. Here we show that chloroquine exhibits antiviral activity against ZIKV in Vero cells, human brain microvascular endothelial cells, human neural stem cells, and mouse neurospheres. We demonstrate that chloroquine reduces the number of ZIKV-infected cells in vitro, and inhibits virus production and cell death promoted by ZIKV infection without cytotoxic effects. In addition, chloroquine treatment partially reveres morphological changes induced by ZIKV infection in mouse neurospheres.",

Zika virus was first isolated from a sentinel monkey in the Zika forest in Uganda in 1947 [1] . Since then, ZIKV has been isolated from humans and mosquitoes throughout Africa and Southeast Asian countries. Phylogenetic analysis of the nonstructural protein 5 encoding region has disclosed three ZIKV lineages: East African,",

Human brain microvascular endothelial cells (hBMEC) were a kind gift from Dr. Julio Scharfstein (Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil), and hBMEC isolation was performed as previously described [25] . These cells were cultured in DMEM High Glucose supplemented with 20% FBS. The C6/36 cell line is derived from Aedes albopictus. C6/36 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) were grown in Leibovitz L-15 medium (GIBCO) supplemented with 2.95 g/L tryptose phosphate broth (Sigma Aldrich, Boston, MA, USA), 2 mM glutamine (GIBCO), 0.075% sodium bicarbonate (GIBCO), 1X non-essential amino acids (GIBCO) and 5% FBS. Neural stem cells (NSCs) were derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). iPSCs were provided by the Biobank of iPSCs of the Brazilian Ministry of Health (CONEP B-027 # 25000.111598/2014-04). According to the supplier, fibroblasts were reprogrammed using the protocol developed by Paulsen et al. [26] , and transduced with the CytoTune-iPS Sendai kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). iPSCs presented a normal karyotype and the expression of pluripotency markers. These cells were cultured with E8 culture media (GIBCO) on a Matrigel (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) coated surface. iPSC colonies were manually passaged every 5-7 days until they reached 70%-80% confluence and were maintained at 37 \u2022 C in humidified air with 5% CO 2 . To produce NSCs, human iPSCs were exposed to the serum-free neural induction medium (GIBCO), containing Neurobasal medium (GIBCO) and the pluripotent stem cell neural induction supplement (GIBCO), according to the manufacturer's protocol [27] . Briefly, the medium was changed every other day until day 7, when initial NSCs are split and grown on neural expansion medium (Advanced DMEM/F12 and neurobasal medium (1:1) with neural induction supplement; GIBCO). NSCs were used after four passages in neural expansion media. Mouse central nervous system (CNS) cells were harvested from Swiss mouse embryos at embryo day 14 (E14) and grown for 72 h as free floating neurospheres in neurobasal culture media (GIBCO) supplemented with 1X B27 (GIBCO).",

To evaluate which step of the viral cycle was susceptible to inhibition, chloroquine was added to Vero cells at different time points post-infection with ZIKV MR766. The supernatant was collected 30 h post-infection and virus production was evaluated by relative quantification of viral RNA over the untreated control by RT-qPCR. Virus titers were also determined by plaque assay in Vero cells. Incubation of Vero cells with chloroquine at 0 h post-infection had a greater impact on the production of ZIKV particles, decreasing viral RNA 64-fold over the controls ( Figure 3A ). The addition of chloroquine from 30 min to 12 h post-infection was able to reduce virus release 9-20 fold over untreated, infected-cells. However, chloroquine added at 24 h post-infection had only a minor effect on viral production ( Figure 3A) . These results were confirmed by quantification of ZIKV infectious particles released after chloroquine treatment ( Figure 3B ).

The Zika virus disease is in general mild, but the recent positive correlation between infection, congenital malformations, and neurological damage in adults has intensified the need for therapeutic approaches. Prophylactic treatments for women intending to get pregnant in epidemic areas and travelers going to affected countries would represent relevant tools to reduce ZIKV transmission and avoid the spread of the disease by travelers. Moreover, a drug that blocks placental transfer of the virus could decrease the chance of vertical transmission in viremic pregnant women as was shown for HIV-infected pregnant women treated with antiretroviral therapy [36] .",

            "text": "Here we demonstrated that chloroquine decreases the number of ZIKV-infected cells and protected cells from ZIKV infection as measured by cell viability at non-cytotoxic concentrations (Figures 1, 4 and 5) . The EC50 or concentration of chloroquine that protected 50% of the cells from ZIKV infection assessed by cell viability, was 9.82-14.2 \u00b5M depending on the cell model and the CC50 ranged from 94.95 to 134.54 \u00b5M ( Table 1) . The values of EC50 obtained for ZIKV MR766 are lower than those obtained for DENV inhibition (~25 \u00b5M) and HIV inhibition (100 \u00b5M) [20, 22] . Furthermore, we observed similar ZIKV inhibitory effects of chloroquine when tested on different ZIKV lineage infections (Figures 2 and 5) , supporting the idea that chloroquine could help to manage recent infections caused by Asian ZIKV lineage. Although chloroquine has shown antiviral activity against a large spectrum of viruses in vitro, few clinical studies have been performed to evaluate chloroquine effects on patients with viral infections. Two clinical trial studies of chloroquine have been conducted to assess chloroquine treatment in patients infected with DENV [37, 38] . One of the trials evaluated the benefits of chloroquine treatment for 3 days in patients infected with DENV and showed no reduction in the duration or intensity of DENV viremia or nonstructural 1 protein (NS1) antigenemia clearance [37] . However, a trend towards a reduction in the number of dengue hemorrhagic fever cases was noticed in the chloroquine-treated group [37] . A more recent clinical trial of chloroquine administration to DENV-infected patients, also for 3 days, showed that 60% of the patients in the chloroquine-treated group reported feeling less pain and showed improvement in the performance of daily chores during treatment [38] . Moreover, the symptoms returned after medication withdrawal. However, chloroquine treatment did not reduce the duration and intensity of the fever or duration of the disease [38] . The antiviral effect of chloroquine may be insufficient to produce a decrease in viral load or improvement of the disease progression when chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine is used in monotherapy. However, chloroquine may produce a significant antiflaviviral effect when used in combination therapies, as recently shown in a clinical trial of hydroxychloroquine plus ribavirin and interferon alpha in individuals infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) [39] . In regard to the potential antiviral therapeutic combinations for Zika, a freshly published screening of drugs already approved for other clinical indications has resulted in the identification of more than 20 candidate drugs [40] . Of note, one of these is mefloquine, a compound related to chloroquine. In terms of safety for pregnant women, however, mefloquine is included in the B category, i.e., a drug for which the animal reproduction studies have failed to demonstrate a risk to the fetus and there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Be that as it may, the aforementioned study corroborates our results using chloroquine, and provides new anti-ZIKV drugs that could be tested in combination with chloroquine.",

Chloroquine was also effective in decreasing virus release, although less pronouncedly and not statistically significant, when added after the early stages of virus infection (from 0.5 to 24 h post-infection), suggesting that later stages of the ZIKV replication cycle might also be affected (Figure 3) .",

            "text": "Recent studies showed that neural stem cells are highly permissive for ZIKV infection and one of the mechanisms proposed for the cause of microcephaly would be the depletion of the stem cell pool induced by ZIKV [10, 11, 55] . Our data showed that chloroquine inhibits the infection of human neural stem cells ( Figure 5 ). Using the mouse neurospheres model to study neural stem cell differentiation into neurons, another process that might be disturbed in microcephaly, we observed that chloroquine inhibited the infection of neuronal progenitors and partially protected the ability of these cells to extend neurites ( Figure 6 ). The protective effect of chloroquine on stem cells and committed progenitors is potentially a groundbreaking feature of this compound, as it would be prescribed to women at childbearing age that are traveling to affected countries and women planning pregnancy in endemic areas. This would decrease the chances of infection and thus fetal damage, especially to the developing brain.",

Titers are expressed as plaque forming units (PFU) per milliliter. The dashed line represents no reduction in RNA levels; (E) Cell viability of uninfected cells treated with increasing concentrations of chloroquine was evaluated by fluorescence measurement at 560/590 nm after viability dye incubation; (F) Protection against ZIKV infection was evaluated through cell viability in ZIKV-infected Vero cells treated with chloroquine for 5 days. Data are represented as mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) \u00b1 standard deviation (SD) from two to four independent experiments.
