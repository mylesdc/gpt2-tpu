I. tinctoria hairy root line V was found to be the most efficient line and was further confirmed by the PCR amplification of rolB, rolC and aux1 genes. Culture parameters of ITHRCs were optimized by Box-Behnken design (BBD), and eight bioactive FL constituents (rutin, neohesperidin, buddleoside, liquiritigenin, quercetin, isorhamnetin, kaempferol and isoliquiritigenin) were quali-quantitatively determined by LC-MS/MS. Under optimal conditions, the total FL accumulation of ITHRCs (24 day-old) achieved was 438.10 \u03bcg/g dry weight (DW), which exhibited significant superiority as against that of 2 year-old field grown roots (341.73 \u03bcg/g DW). Additionally, in vitro antioxidant assays demonstrated that ITHRCs extracts exhibited better antioxidant activities with lower IC 50 values (0.41 and 0.39, mg/mL) as compared to those of field grown roots (0.56 and 0.48, mg/mL). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report describing FL production and antioxidant activities from ITHRCs.",

Alkaloids, phenylpropanoids and terpenoids are recognized as the principle active ingredients of Radix isatidis [5] . Among them, alkaloids always attract much attention, and are validated to be responsible for various bioactivities [6] . Nevertheless, phenylpropanoids mainly comprised of flavonoids (FL) have been identified as anti-inflammatory and antiviral constituents, and also are involved in the major drug actions of Radix isatidis [3, 7] . In this context, the interest and market demand of FL from Radix isatidis is increasing more and more.",

            "text": "Due to the unreliability on harvest of phytochemicals from natural resources and the complexity in producing natural products through chemical synthesis, one has to look for an environment friendly and renewable production system to fulfill the need of food and pharmaceutical industries. Plant cell culture technology emerging as an attractive alternative system, can continuously provide high-value ingredients independent of geographical, climatic or environmental variations and constraints [8, 9] . Over the past years, plant cell suspension cultures for the production of secondary metabolites have been hampered by several limitations, such as low yields of desired compounds, expensive culturing process, application of phytohormones, heterogeneous cell types, lack of storage tissue, and products easily degraded by the enzymes released in the media [9, 10] . One way around this problem has been the development of specialized differentiated or plant organ cultures instead of cell suspension cultures, best exemplified by Agrobacterium rhizogenes-based hairy root cultures (HRCs). HRCs induced by the infection of wounded plant tissues with A. rhizogenes bearing the root-inducing (Ri) plasmid, possess comparable biosynthetic capacity of secondary metabolites to native plant roots with advantages of fast growth rates independent of phytohormones, genetic and biochemical stability, long-term preservation, and sizable biomass production [11] . More importantly, HRCs often accumulate phytochemicals at a higher level as against undifferentiated cell suspension cultures [12] . Herein, it is believed that the transformation of I. tinctoria by A. rhizogenes could result in hairy root lines with the potential to biosynthesize FL for research or food, agricultural and pharmaceutical applications.",

Afterwards, the culture conditions of I. tinctoria HRCs (ITHRCs) were optimized systematically for the efficient production of FL, which may provide valuable data for industrial scale-up applications in bioreactors. Subsequently, eight FL constituents from ITHRCs including rutin (RUT), neohesperidin (NEO), buddleoside (BUD), liquiritigenin (LIQ), quercetin (QUE), isorhamnetin (ISR), kaempferol (KAE) and isoliquiritigenin (ISL) were quali-quantitatively determined by LC-MS/MS. Moreover, considering that antioxidant activities of FL are of great interest in food, cosmetic and pharmaceutical fields, antioxidant capacities of ITHRCs extracts were also evaluated. Furthermore, the predominance of ITHRCs was eventually summarized as against I. tinctoria field grown roots (ITFGRs). In light of the presented results, ITHRCs may offer a promising and continuous product platform for naturally-derived, high quality and valuable nutraceuticals. ",

In order to obtain the optimal biomass production and FL accumulation during the culture process, BBD was applied to survey effects of four independent key variables (culture temperature 20-30\u00b0C, sucrose concentration 2-4%, inoculum size 0.4-1% and harvest time 18-30 days) on dependent variables (biomass DW and TFL content). The inoculum size was calculated based on the fresh weight of hairy roots. The regression analysis was carried out to evaluate the response function as a quadratic polynomial:",

Generally, different derived hairy root lines often exhibit considerable variation in biomass and metabolite production owing to the site uncertainty of T-DNA integration into the host plant genome [18, 19] . Therefore, selection of the high-productive hairy root line is extremely important in this work. Accordingly, eight candidate lines (ITHRL I-VIII) with vigorously growing phenotype were evaluated by comparing their performance of biomass production and FL accumulation. As shown in Fig. 1A , B, ITHRL III, V and VII were categorized as high-productive lines in terms of biomass DW (11.41-11.97 g/L) and FL content (310.83-382.71 \u03bcg/g DW) as compared to the others. However, ITHRL V exhibited the most intensive ability of FL biosynthesis among them. Consequently, ITHRL V was demonstrated to be the optimal hairy root line used for the subsequent work. Moreover, the cultivation of ITHRL V on MS/2 solid medium and its prolific growth in MS/2 liquid medium are shown in Fig. 1C , D, respectively.",

In detail, the rolB and rolC genes (located at the Ri TL-DNA segment) and the aux1 gene (located at the Ri TR-DNA segment), were diagnostic for T-DNA integration into the host genome of ITHRL V. Additionally, the virD gene (located outside the Ri T-DNA segment) was used to verify the complete absence of A. rhizogenes in ITHRL V.

Generally, a suitable type of culture medium was beneficial for cell/organ growth and metabolite biosynthesis [19] .

Moreover, sugars acting as both energy sources and signaling molecules always affect the growth and metabolism of plant cell/organ cultures [21] . As shown in Fig. 3C , D, sucrose was found to be the suitable carbon source for root growth and FL biosynthesis. Furthermore, it is reported that the initial pH of culture medium can significantly affect nutrient uptake as well as enzymatic and hormonal activities in plant cell/organ cultures [22] . As exhibited in Fig. 3E , F, the initial pH at 5.8 gave the maximum values of biomass DW and TFL content. Additionally, the number of experiments necessary for optimizing culture conditions can be reduced by following statistical experimental design due to the tedious process. Herein, the remaining key parameters including culture temperature, sucrose concentration, inoculum size and harvest time were optimized by BBD. The experimental design matrix and the relevant data are illustrated in S2 Table. Fitting the mathematical model ANOVA results of the quadratic models are presented in S4 Table. The highly significant levels of the models (P < 0.0001), not significant \"lack of fit\" (P > 0.05) and desirable determination coefficients (R 2 ! 0.9754) suggested that both the built mathematical models were precise and applicable.

Generally, the growth and metabolism of hairy roots were enhanced with increasing temperature, while high temperature (25-30\u00b0C) would cause an irreversible damage of some related proteins or enzymes in plant cells/organs [23] , thus resulting in the decrease in biomass DW and TFL content. Additionally, sucrose concentration around 3.0% favored the biomass production and TFL accumulation at a given temperature. It is known that sucrose has dual roles as carbon source and osmotic agent in plant cells/ organs cultures [19] . Generally, more consumption of sucrose would benefit root growth and metabolite biosynthesis. However, the osmolality of culture medium under high sucrose concentration (3.0-4.0%) could cause the loss of cell viability by the dehydration and promote the diffusion of phytochemicals from root tissues into the liquid medium, thus leading to the low biomass DW and TFL content. As presented in Fig. 4B , D, biomass DW and TFL content increased obviously with the extension of inoculum size from 0.4% to 0.8% at a fixed harvest time, but decreased significantly afterward being ascribed to the limitation of nutrients, oxygen levels and volume of culture flasks [24] . Furthermore, at a given inoculum size, biomass DW and TFL content increased with raising time initially but decreased gradually beyond 25 days owing to the depletion of medium nutrients and the liquid mass-transfer limitations [25] .",

            "text": "By the aid of the above mathematical models, the optimal conditions for biomass DW and TFL content in ITHRCs were calculated as follows: culture temperature 24.71\u00b0C, sucrose concentration 3.06%, inoculum size 0.75% and harvest time 23.74 days. Considering the actual operation, temperature and time were modified to 24.7\u00b0C and 24 days, respectively. To validate the reliability of these predictive parameters, six sequential experiments adopting ITHRL V were performed under the above optimized conditions. The optimal values of biomass DW (12.53 \u00b1 0.26 g/L) and TFL content (438.10 \u00b1 3.46 \u03bcg/g DW) were very close to those (12.41 g/L and 429.66 \u03bcg/g DW) forecasted by the theoretical models. Consequently, the culture conditions achieved by BBD were reliable and practical. (Fig. 5A) . Likewise, the mass spectra fragmentation patterns of NEO, BUD, LIQ, QUE, ISR, KAE and ISL are exhibited in Fig. 5B -H, respectively. All information of mass spectra of these compounds was consistent with the reported data [26, 27] as well as that of standard compounds, which confirmed that the established ITHRCs could indeed produce the eight FL constituents. Additionally, the precursor/product ion combinations of these target analytes with the highest intensity were chosen for the quantification via LC-MS/MS analysis with SRM mode. The relevant operating parameters are optimized and shown in S3 3 .77 \u00b1 0.36, \u03bcg/g DW, correspondingly). Overall, ITHRCs accumulated up to 1.28 times more TFL (438.10 \u00b1 3.46 \u03bcg/g DW) than that of ITFGRs (341.73 \u00b1 4.85 \u03bcg/g DW), confirming that the T-DNA of A. rhizogenes played an important role in boosting the production of FL in ITHRCs. Evidently, T-DNA associated with rol genes in the host genome of HRCs are thought to induce and enhance the biosynthesis of plant secondary metabolites by turning on the transcription of defense genes [14, 28, 29] . It can be inferred that rolB and rolC genes existed in ITHRCs (Fig. 2 ) are likely to be stimulators for the activation of secondary metabolism to improve FL biosynthesis.",

Due to the presence of phenolic hydroxyls, RUT, NEO, BUD, LIQ, QUE, ISR, KAE and ISL were the primarily antioxidant contributors of I.tinctoria, which can act as the hydrogen/electron donors to neutralize peroxyl free radicals. In this study, ITHRCs extracts exhibited better antioxidant activities than ITFGRs, which can be partly explained by the higher level of TFL as against ITFGRs. However, one essential difference of traditional Chinese herbal medicines from the synthetic drugs is that their therapeutic effects are due to the joint contribution of multi-components, not only a few ones. Possible synergistic effects of the multiple constituents in ITHRCs extracts should be also taken into considerations. Overall, the antioxidant activity screening results are indicative of the potential of ITHRCs as ",

This study provided a high-productive ITHRCs (24 day-old) that is capable of biosynthesizing FL in higher yield and quality as against that of 2 year-old field grown roots. Moreover, the proposed system exhibits several potential superiorities as follows: firstly, the uniform quality of products harvested anywhere under the strictly controlled conditions; secondly, the green and sustainable production system irrespective of climate/ecology-related and agrochemical problems; thirdly, the scalable production of products in bioreactor for the commercial purposes.",
