The high prevalence of HIV-1 subtype C in southern Africa necessitates the development of cheap, effective vaccines. One means of production is the use of plants, for which a number of different techniques have been successfully developed. HIV-1 Pr55Gag is a promising HIV-1 vaccine candidate: we compared the expression of this and a truncated Gag (p17/p24) and the p24 capsid subunit in Nicotiana spp. using transgenic plants and transient expression via Agrobacterium tumefaciens and recombinant tobamovirus vectors. We also investigated the influence of subcellular localisation of recombinant protein to the chloroplast and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) on protein yield. We partially purified a selected vaccine candidate and tested its stimulation of a humoral and cellular immune response in mice.",

Chloroplast targeted protein levels were highest in transient and transgenic expression of p24 and p17/p24. The transiently-expressed p17/p24 was not immunogenic in mice as a homologous vaccine, but it significantly boosted a humoral and T cell immune response primed by a gag DNA vaccine, pTHGagC.",

There are numerous vaccine initiatives currently in progress globally [2] , but the number of different subtypes of HIV-1 prevalent in different geographic areas has complicated the prospects for a universal HIV-1 vaccine. HIV-1 subtype C is the predominant HIV in southern Africa; therefore, South African isolates of this subtype have been used in the development of candidate DNA and other virally-and bacterially-vectored and subunit vaccines for South Africa under the auspices of the South African AIDS Vaccine Initiative (SAAVI) [3] [4] [5] . Because of the extent of HIV-1 infection in southern Africa, any immunisation programme will require enormous quantities of vaccine. DNA vaccines are expensive to manufacture, as are recombinant viral and subunit vaccines produced via cell culture. This makes the proposition costly and possibly unfeasible, particularly for the poorer developing countries where HIV infection is prevalent. There is therefore a strong need to develop vaccine expression systems which have the potential to produce vaccines at low cost for these countries.",

Expression hosts include crop plants such as Nicotiana tabacum (tobacco) and other Nicotiana spp., alfalfa, rice, wheat, potato and soybeans, amongst a number of others. Different expression systems include transient viral vector expression [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] , Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transient expression [16] [17] [18] , and the generation of stable transgenic plants [19] [20] [21] or cultured plant cells [22] expressing the protein of interest. The majority of plant-produced recombinant proteins have been produced by transgenic plants, and in many cases, transplastomic plants [23] . However, transient expression is a viable alternative: the short production cycle coupled with codon optimisation, suitable promoters and the help of silencing suppressors such as plant virus-derived p19 and NSs [18] means that it can be scaled up to produce high protein yields in a very short time [7] .",

However, poor expression levels in transgenic plants and the complex regulatory problems surrounding plantproduced vaccines are the major challenges [27] . Moreover, reports of inadvertent mixing into the food chain of pharmaceutical proteins from transgenic plants in the USA [28] have put transient plant expression into the spotlight as a bona fide production strategy in its own right.",

A few studies have also been carried out using the Tat protein [47, 48] . Zhang et al. [49, 50] showed that HIV-1 p24 could be expressed as a fusion protein with tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) capsid protein in tomatoes. However, the inserted p24 open reading frame (ORF) was not stably maintained. The same researchers subsequently generated stable transgenic N. tabacum expressing the same HIV-1 p24 protein at levels of 0.35% of total soluble protein (TSP) [26] . More recently, P\u00e9rez-Filgueira [50] et al. showed that a recombinant tobacco mosaic virus (TMV)-derived vector expressing subtype C HIV-1 p24 in N. benthamiana yielded levels of 100 mg per kg fresh leaf weight. Furthermore, immunisation of rabbits using purified recombinant p24 induced a humoral response in inoculated rabbits that was strong and specific to p24. However, there are no studies reported to date on the expression of HIV-1 Pr55Gag or p17 in plants, and HIV-1 p24 is not seen by many as a good vaccine candidate. While its expression in plants has not been investigated, recombinant HIV-1 p17/ 24 fusion protein has successfully been produced in insect cells via recombinant baculovirus [41] for mapping domains involved in VLP formation.",

We investigated the usefulness of codon optimisation and of targeting recombinant proteins to the ER and chloroplasts as a means of improving yields, and investigated whether transient expression via recombinant tobamoviruses or Agrobacterium tumefaciens produced better yields than the Agrobacterium-engineered transgenic system.

Expressed protein levels from all three versions of the p24 gene (Nicotiana spp.- and human codon-optimised and wild type) were significantly higher (100 to 10000 times greater) than the p24 levels obtained with gag, ranging from 167 to 17350 \u03bcg p24/kg fresh leaf wt. Although plant-optimised np24 expression levels were the highest, with wtp24 expressed protein levels being about 1.2 times and hp24 expressed protein levels being at least 10 times less, p24 levels varied considerably within the specific version tested. Despite the low levels of recombinant protein expression, samples of crude plant sap from N. benthamiana infected with the pBSGngag recombinant TMV RNA that were immunotrapped with HIV-1 p17 antiserum and viewed under the electron microscope, showed the presence of VLPs approximately 110 to 120 nm in diameter (data not shown). These were very similar in shape and size to baculovirus-produced Pr55Gag VLPs [30] . Plants infected with rTMV expressing p24 did not produce any particles (not shown). Given the very low yield of the Pr55Gag protein, however, these preliminary results were not followed up.",

Part of our objective in this study was to investigate the feasibility of expressing the same gene in plants via recombinant TMV as a cheaper means of making VLPs. While a plant codon-optimised version of the gene produced a Pr55Gag protein which apparently formed recognisable VLPs (data not shown), the yield of protein was extremely low. We investigated whether yield could be improved by truncation or differential localisation of the protein, and showed that sequences downstream of the p24 ORF negatively affected expression, given that either p24 or p17/24 proteins were expressed relatively well, both in transient and transgenic expression systems. Interestingly, while expression of the gag-derived genes used here did benefit from plant codon optimisation, unlike our group's earlier experience with Human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16) L1 protein expression [52] , as in that work we found that determination of best intracellular locale for transient protein accumulation was strictly empirical. Thus, while Pr55Gag accumulated similarly poorly in all locations, and p24 accumulated negligibly in cytoplasm and significantly better in both the ER and chloroplasts, p17/p24 yield was similar in cytoplasm and ER and 20-fold better in chloroplasts. Transgenic expression presented a different picture: cytoplasmic targeting of Pr55Gag resulted in regeneration failure, indicating toxicity; ER-targeted p24 did not accumulate well, although chloroplast targeting was equivalent to transient expression, and p17/p24 again accumulated best in chloroplasts, but to 20-fold lower levels than in transient studies.",

As several studies have indicated enhanced immune responses can be achieved by heterologous prime-boost inoculation regimens, we chose to investigate the immune response of p17/p24 alone and its ability to boost an immune response to a DNA vaccine pTHGagC that is known to prime an immune response of mice, which can be effectively boosted by Pr55Gag VLPs [30] . Indeed, the substantial boost by leaf protein containing p17/p24 protein of Gag-specific cellular and humoral immune responses induced by the DNA vaccine pTHGagC suggests that HIV proteins produced in plants may be very valuable for expanding immune responses after the immune system has been primed. While both CD8+ and CD4+ vaccine-specific T cells have a protective role, CD4+ T cells are potentially important for the induction and maintenance of CD8 memory cells and stimulation of B cells for antibody production [53] [54] [55] . We found the increase in Gagspecific CD4+ T cells induced by the boost with p17/p24 protein is associated with a substantial increase in the Gag-specific humoral responses and a progression in an IgG1 to IgG2a isotype switch. Even though we did not measure Gag-specific Th1-Th2 responses, the IgG isotypes suggest our prime-boost inoculation regimen induces a mixed Th1-Th2 response with low doses of p17/p24 inducing more of a Th1 response, which changes to a greater Th2 type response when higher doses of p17/ p24 are used. Although the inoculation with p17/p24 protein alone was not immunogenic in mice, we may find if we use a higher dose with homologous boosts or adjuvant, that a Gag-specific immune response is induced. Results obtained using a classic western blot strip assay for HIV antibodies also showed a clear boosting of the DNAinduced response, apparently to a greater degree than obtained by DNA prime-DNA boost (see Figure 6 ).",

Additionally, the short production cycle can reduce costs considerably compared to the equivalent transgenic case. The use of post-transcriptional silencing suppressors such as p19 and NSs [18] , as well as increased protein stability after targeting proteins to cellular organelles, can further enhance the expression level.

Using transit peptide tags might therefore overcome the limitations of using transplastomics, which include product insolubility, a lack of post-translational modifications, less established chloroplast transformation protocols and biosafety concerns of the horizontal transfer of transgenes from chloroplasts of transplastomics to bacteria under lab conditions [58] .",

The ngag version was also cloned into pBSG1057 to yield pBSGngag. A wild type p24 ORF (wtp24) derived by PCR from wtgag as well as Nicotiana spp. and human codon-optimised versions np24 and hp24 were cloned into pBSG1057 at the same restriction enzyme sites to yield the clones pBSGwtp24, pBSGnp24 and pBSGhp24. Recombinant viral RNA was transcribed from the clones using the RiboMAX\u2122 Large Scale RNA Production System (T7) (Promega, Madison). The RNA was rub-inoculated onto leaves of N. benthamiana plants with gloved hands and a pinch of Celite (Merck, Germany). Plants were grown at 22\u00b0C under a 16 h/8 h light/ dark cycle, monitored daily for TMV symptoms and leaves sampled at 3 to 10 days post inoculation (dpi) to test for Gag or p24 expression. Samples for electron microscopy for the detection of Gag VLPs were prepared using crude plant sap -plants were crushed in a minimal volume of 1 \u00d7 PBS and the filtered extract clarified by centrifugationfrom N. benthamiana plants infected with pBSGwtgag and pBSGngag RNA (10 dpi). Twenty microlitre amounts were immunotrapped onto carbon-coated copper grids (200 mesh) coated with HIV-1 p17 antiserum (ARP431, NIBSC). These were stained with 2% uranyl acetate and viewed under a Zeiss S1109 transmission electron microscope. Baculovirus-produced Gag VLPs were produced as previously described [30] for comparison.",
