This number represents about 50%-60% of the local population of new cancer patients who will need radiotherapy during the treatment of their illness 1,6 . Radiation for oncologic emergencies is quick and effective in alleviating symptoms caused by cancer progression. The success rate (at least partial symptom control) is approximately 70%-80% 7, 8 . The data extracted in the present study demonstrate that 1.6% of the entire annual patient population seen at the occ required radiation treatment on an urgent basis over a weekend or holiday 2 . That result was expected because, of patients treated with radiation, only a very small population present with oncologic emergencies 8 , and of those emergency patients, only 1 or 2 on average are treated over a weekend. When the total patient cohort of 161 in this study was averaged over the 2-year study period, the result was slightly more than 1 patient treated each weekend. The overall number of cases treated with emergency intent on a weekend or holiday was not compared with the total number of emergency cases managed either during working hours or on weekday evenings, because these data were inaccessible. Consequently, it is difficult to ascertain if, relative to other patterns of care in this realm 5 , more referrals were seen over the weekend than during the week. Whether the number of referrals for emergency treatment escalated on Friday as compared with other weekdays-as has been documented in past studies 9 -was also not conclusive. However, over the 2-year period, we observed very few instances in which patients were not treated on weekends, suggesting that, although radiotherapy emergencies remain rare, they are indeed common enough to warrant sufficient resource allocation to maintain an appropriate standard of care for urgent symptomatic cancer patients.",

Accelerated, continuous fractionation with 7-day-perweek courses has been studied and shown to provide excellent tumour control, particularly in head-andneck cases 10 . However, in the management of palliative patients, considerably fewer data are available on the suitability of weekend treatments and acceptable standards of care. A recent study into patterns of care demonstrated that the top three reasons for administering radiation urgently were myelocompression from spinal metastases, svco, and intracranial pressure from brain metastases 5 . These appear also to be the most common emergency conditions across other series 7 , and the data from the present study show similar correlation. It is well recognized that spinal cord compression and svco remain classified as \"emergency\" conditions, as does tumour obstruction or bleeding 11, 12 . These conditions are all documented within the cco guidelines-a situation that generally suggests that the intent for treatment in the present study complies with cco policy 1 . The occ departmental policy is different from that of cco: the department is bound by looser guidelines, without clear objectives for treatment on weekends and holidays. An example would be the statement \"when a delay in radiotherapy might compromise treatment outcome\" 2 . With that statement in the policy, some radiation oncologists could justify treating an impending cord compression over the weekend if they feel it may compromise outcome; other oncologists may not feel the same way. The retrospective nature of the study made it difficult to determine from case records the exact intent for treatment in these more \"grey\" areas, and thus, became a limitation of the research. Certainly, treatment intent would be easier to document prospectively, because patterns of practice and adherence to policy can be clarified up front.",

But a difficulty remains: In the absence of published literature or practice guidelines to suggest the policies that should be followed, the decision to treat becomes a subjective one-at the discretion of the radiation oncologist. The notion of an \"emergency condition\" will definitely vary from one radiation oncologist to another. Aside from the top three, some of the indications for treatment are difficult to justify even with the small, but meaningful, percentage of patients who are prescribed treatment over a weekend when such prescription was unnecessary. Discrepancies will invariably arise between doctors in decision-making about emergency treatments-such as those relating to an impending spinal cord compression or to painful metastases with no neurologic or organ compromise, or even to new brain metastases in patients who are relatively asymptomatic and are controlled with medical management such as corticosteroids. Additionally, as seen in Figure 1 , close to 20% of patients received treatment for more than 1 site over a weekend. Perhaps the need to expedite treatment for one urgent site allowed a second site that may not have been as great an emergency to be treated simultaneously-a situation that occurred in some of the cases in the present study. Along the same lines, it was unclear whether some treatments were delivered to inpatients over the weekend so as to expedite their discharge from hospital, as covered in the original occ policy. This information was very difficult to obtain, and again, the decision would be quite subjective and not necessarily documented.",

The occ was classified as a level 0 facility, where no probable or suspected sars cases were reported. However, the affiliated hospital, Sunnybrook and Women's College Health Sciences Centre, was rated as a category 2 facility 14 . Surprisingly, the patterns of care for prescribed emergency radiotherapy over weekends and hospital holidays remained unaffected based on the data tracked over the study period. Anecdotally, its was expected that, because the occ was identified at level 0, physicians would prescribe weekend radiotherapy with little hesitation, given that most patients (who were outpatients) could receive radiotherapy treatment without risk of exposure to sars. In fact, it might have been expected that the referral rate would decline, because the occ could not accept any patients transported from a facility with a status greater than level 1. The data did not reflect a decline; a similar pattern of care was documented over the entire 2-year study period (Table i) .",

These conditions would include malignant spinal cord compression, symptomatic brain metastases after initiation of medical therapy in patients who are unsuitable for surgery, superior vena cava obstruction (complicated by cardiovascular or respiratory compromise), acute airway obstruction, uncontrolled tumour hemorrhage, or neurologic compromise 1 . Including the degree of symptom severity as measured by standardized questionnaires agreeable to the oncologists would also be useful. Collaborating with other radiation oncology centres in Ontario and Canada to document their patterns of care in the treatment of oncologic emergencies would certainly be ideal. Such collaboration would allow for improvement on the small number of cases currently analyzed and would initiate a more formal process, developing into practice guidelines in the future, to improve the standard of care for all patients who require emergency radiotherapy for their symptomatic illness.",

However, there may be a place for revision and standardization of these policies to improve overall care for this small but important population of patients.",
