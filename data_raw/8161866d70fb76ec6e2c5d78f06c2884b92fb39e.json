HPIV also retains its infectivity on inanimate objects for up to 10 hours 10 and its incubation period as found in volunteer studies was estimated at 3-6 days 11 .

Specimens were kept at 4 \u00b0C for a maximum of 24 h and then aliquoted and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until further processing. RNA was extracted and viral nucleic acid was detected as described previously [17] [18] [19] . The studies were approved by the Scientific and Ethical Committee of the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, the Institutional Review Boards of Children's Hospital 1 and 2 and the Oxford University Tropical Research Ethical Committee under the approval numbers 44.08 for the inpatient and 31.08 for the outpatient study. Written informed consent was obtained from parents or legal guardians of all children enrolled in the study. PCR Amplification and Sequencing. Complementary DNA (cDNA) was prepared from HPIV-positive samples as previously described 20 and shipped to Duke-NUS for PCR amplification and Sanger sequencing. For sequencing, HPIV-positive samples were further amplified in a hemi-nested PCR approach with newly designed species-specific primers targeting overlapping regions of the viral genome (Table S2) . Briefly, the first-round PCR was conducted in 5 or 6 separate reactions and amplified an 'outer' PCR product of about ~3 kb collectively covering the entire genome of HPIV (~15 kb for HPIV1-3, ~17 kb for HPIV4). These initial PCR products were further amplified in a second-round PCR yielding 2 separate overlapping 'inner' products of 1.5-1.8 kb. Amplicons were gel-purified and sequenced with PCR primers. If required, PCRs and sequencing reactions using additional primers were performed to achieve full genome coverage. Low quality reads were manually curated, primer sequences were removed and contigs were assembled in Geneious version 7.0 21 . Nucleotide alignments of the HN gene of all HPIV species and whole genome sequences of HPIV3 were created using MAFFT 22 . Phylogenetic Analysis. All available HN gene sequences of the 4 HPIV species were downloaded from the NIAID Virus Pathogen Database and Analysis Resource (ViPR) 23 and annotated with sample collection date and country. Temporal phylogenies of individual HPIV species were inferred in BEAST v1.8.3 24 using a strict clock, the HKY85 substitution model, and a constant coalescent tree prior. MCMC chains were run for 100 million steps with sampling every 10,000 generations. Run convergence was confirmed in Tracer v1.6 after 10% burn-in removal 25 . Maximum clade credibility (MCC) trees were generated using Tree Annotator v1.7 26 . The phylogeny of HPIV3 was further inferred from available whole-genome sequences. All phylogenetic trees were visualized using of migration in and out of Viet Nam were inferred using an asymmetric substitution model with the Bayesian Stochastic Search Variable Selection (BSSVS) option. Two independent runs of 100 million generations were combined using LogCombiner v1.8.3 after removal of appropriate burn-in and the mean migration rates were extracted from the combined log file.",

Proportions of demographic and clinical variables were compared between HPIV species with a Chi-squared test with Yates' correction. The clinical diagnosis at presentation and follow-up were classified as upper respiratory infection (rhinitis, rhinopharyngitis or laryngitis) or bronchiolitis/ pneumonia or any lower respiratory infection (either bronchitis, croup, bronchiolitis or pneumonia). A p-value of <0.05 was considered significant. All statistical analyses were performed on GraphPad Prism 5.0d for Mac software (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, California USA).",

Results indicated that HPIV1 has been circulating in humans since the 1940's, with time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) estimated as 1948 (95% highest posterior density (HPD): 1944-1952) ( Table 2 ). Since the mid-1990s, HPIV1 has diverged into two distinct monophyletic lineages (clades 1 and 2) that co-circulate worldwide. All Vietnamese viruses sequenced within this study clustered in clade 2 along with viruses from Argentina, Japan and USA (Fig. 1A) . Limited genetic data is available for HPIV2 and HPIV4 and this may influence the estimation of dates and these results must therefore be interpreted with caution. The mean TMRCA for HPIV2 was estimated as 1896 (95% HPD: 1850-1925). HPIV2 also diverged into two clades with clade 1 viruses predominant in the 1980s until they were superseded by clade 2 viruses during the early 2000s (Fig. 1B) . All Vietnamese HPIV2 viruses sequenced from this study, as well as all sequences obtained after the year 2000 from Asia, belong to clade 2. The mean TMRCA of the HPIV4 viruses was estimated at 1955 (95% HPD: 1938-1968), while the TMRCAs for HPIV4A and HPIV4B were estimated as 1989 (95% HPD: 1981-1994) and 1994 (1989) (1990) (1991) (1992) (1993) (1994) (1995) (1996) (1997) (1998) , respectively.

HPIV3 has also diverged into two major monophyletic clades (clades 1 and 2 in Fig. 2) . In marked contrast to other HPIVs, the HPIV3 phylogeny exhibits more extensive lineage diversification in the 2000s, with some indication of continuous genetic drift, indicated by a ladder-like phylogeny 27 , that is more evident within the clade 1 than clade 2 ( Fig. 2A) . Viral lineage turnover is also present, whereby older virus strains become extinct and are replaced by newer strains. Clade 1 viruses also demonstrated greater diversification of multiple independent lineages and inter-continental mixing of the viruses than clade 2 viruses. Our results also show that the HPIV3 infections in Viet Nam during 2009-2010 resulted from at least five independent virus introductions that are highlighted as clades V1-V5 in Fig. 2A . The viruses detected in Viet Nam were generally closely related to viruses from East Asia, although clades comprised viruses from diverse geographic areas (for examples see Fig. 2B and C). In clades V2 and V4 there is one cluster each of HPIV3 viruses from Viet Nam that were detected over a period of 14-15 months, suggesting sustained endemic circulation. The mean TMRCA of clade V4 was estimated as 2005 (95% HPD: [2004] [2005] [2006] suggesting that these viruses may have been circulating in Viet Nam for at least 5 years. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that this may be due to inadequate global sampling and sequencing of HPIV3 viruses. We also reconstructed the HPIV3 phylogeny using 24 newly generated whole genomes and 138 publicly available genomes. The whole-genome HPIV3 phylogeny was largely congruent with the HN phylogeny, showing multiple clades of viruses that circulate globally (Supplementary Fig. 1) .",

Characteristic clinical features could not be attributed to a specific HPIV species. Among outpatients, all four HPIV species predominately manifested with ALRI (bronchitis, bronchiolitis, pneumonia). This is remarkable in the case of HPIV4, which was previously known to cause mild clinical illness 28 infection with all HPIV species at initial consultation, with only incomplete resolution of symptoms at follow-up, is an indication of high disease severity in this cohort. In the inpatient cohort, which in contrast to the outpatient cohort used clinically manifesting ALRI as an inclusion criterion, two cases of HPIV3 infection resulted in admission to the intensive care unit, possibly indicating enhanced pathogenicity of HPIV3 over the other species as suggested previously 1, 4, 29 , although the episode duration was similar for all HPIV species. All HPIV species have been detected in diverse geographical regions and several circulation patterns have been suggested 30, 31 . In our study, viral co-detections were common among samples positive for all HPIV species. Our rate of viral co-infections of 41% is within previous reports and highlights the importance for screening for several viral pathogens simultaneously 32 . Rhino-/Enteroviruses were most commonly found in combination with HPIV, possibly due to longer duration of shedding with the former and/or frequent orofecal transmission in paediatric patients 33 . Notably, co-detection of bocavirus was found among all HPIV species and in both cohorts. Furthermore, the complete absence of influenza virus co-infection in both cohorts is remarkable. Human adenovirus, human respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, seasonal coronaviruses, and human parechovirus were only incidentally detected in combination with HPIV. The concurrent detection of HPIV3 and HPIV4 occurred in nine instances in the outpatient cohort, suggesting this combination to be rather common. HPIVs are usually detected throughout the year, but enhanced epidemic transmission probably occurs during the colder months of the year. Fry et al. described an interaction of HPIV1 and HPIV3 detections in the US 30 . In our study, we found co-detection of HPIVs year-round, however, no distinct peak was observed. This is likely due to the study design as the original studies among in-and out-patients were conducted over a limited time span.",

Two groups of HPIV1 co-circulate globally but only restricted diversity was detected in this study. Viet Nam viruses belong to clade 2 and are most closely related to virus sequences from Argentina, Japan and USA. In contrast, HPIV3 sequences from Viet Nam belonged to multiple clades and grouped with viruses from diverse geographical regions. Multiple introductions of HPIV3 into Viet Nam were observed in 2009 and 2010, and in two cases these may have resulted in sustained endemic transmission, while clades comprised of viruses from different geographical areas suggests frequent transmission between those areas. In addition, phylogeographic analysis indicated that Viet Nam was a net importer of HPIV3 diversity. While other viruses such as influenza A/H3N2 viruses and RSV circulate globally [35] [36] [37] [38] , this has not been demonstrated for HPIV, but is a probable scenario. However, the current lack of sequence data, particularly from large population centres, renders it difficult to draw firm conclusions on the transmission of these viruses at any temporal or spatial scale without additional sampling from diverse geographical regions.
