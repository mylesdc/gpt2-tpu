However, it is not clear whether upregulation of the ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis prevents LPS-induced injury in pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMVECs) by inhibiting the MAPKs/NF-kB pathways. Primary cultured rat PMVECs were transduced with lentiviral-borne Ace2 or shRNA-Ace2, and then treated or not with Mas receptor blocker (A779) before exposure to LPS. LPS stimulation resulted in the higher levels of AngII, Ang-(1-7), cytokine secretion, and apoptosis rates, and the lower ACE2/ACE ratio. Ace2 reversed the ACE2/ACE imbalance and increased Ang-(1-7) levels, thus reducing LPS-induced apoptosis and inflammation, while inhibition of Ace2 reversed all these effects. A779 abolished these protective effects of Ace2. LPS treatment was associated with activation of the ERK, p38, JNK, and NF-kB pathways, which were aggravated by A779. Pretreatment with A779 prevented the Ace2-induced blockade of p38, JNK, and NF-kB phosphorylation. However, only JNK inhibitor markedly reduced apoptosis and cytokine secretion in PMVECs with Ace2 deletion and A779 pretreatment. These results suggest that the ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis has a crucial role in preventing LPS-induced apoptosis and inflammation of PMVECs, by inhibiting the JNK/NF-kB pathways.",

Abnormal activation of the RAS is involved in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular, renal, and lung diseases 5-7 . Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2, a homologue of ACE, is a recently discovered component of the RAS 8 . In contrast to ACE which converts angiotensin (Ang) I (AngI) to generate AngII, ACE2 reduces the generation of AngII by catalyzing the conversion of AngII to Ang-(1-7), which attenuates the vasoconstrictive, proliferative, and inflammatory effects of AngII. Hence, ACE2 has a pertinent role in the anti-inflammatory RAS-ACE2-Ang-(1-7) axis, as it counteracts the pro-inflammatory effects of the ACE-AngII axis 9,10 .",

Therefore, the protective effect of ACE2 on LPS-induced PMVEC injury may be via regulation of the ACE2/ACE/AngII/Ang-(1-7)/Mas receptor.

            "text": "The activation of MAPKs pathways has a key role in progression to acute lung injury but has not been fully elucidated in PMVECs after exposure to LPS 15, 16 . In the present study, we found that ACE2 overexpression significantly blocked LPS-induced activation of the p38 and JNK pathways, which was strikingly prevented by administration of the Mas receptor blocker. This suggests that ACE2 is protective against LPS-induced apoptosis of PMVECs and inflammation, perhaps through the Ang-(1-7)/Mas pathway to modulate p38 and JNK phosphorylation. On the other hand, shRNA-ACE2 enhanced LPS-induced ERK phosphorylation but had no influence on p38 and JNK phosphorylation, whereas LPS-mediated increased ERK phosphorylation was not affected by ACE2 overexpression in cells pretreated with the Mas receptor blocker. These results suggest that inhibited ACE2 aggravated LPS-induced PMVEC apoptosis and inflammation mainly through the AngII/AT1 pathway to enhance ERK phosphorylation. In fact, activation of p38 MAPK and ERK is associated with TNF-a-induced increase of permeability in pulmonary endothelial cells, and the proliferation and survival of lung endothelial cells to maintain endothelial monolayer integrity may be by way of activating p38 MAPK 39 . Bleomycin induces cell apoptosis through the JNK phosphorylation pathway in alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) 40 . In addition, ACE2 regulates the balance of AngII/ Ang(1-7) to inhibit apoptosis of alveolar epithelial cells through blockade of JNK phosphorylation 41 .",

In fact, NF-kB binds to IkBa in the cytoplasm, but once dissociated from IkBa, NF-kB is activated and translocates into the nucleus to upregulate transcription of several inflammatory genes 45, 46 . The NF-kB cascade is pivotal to the intracellular signaling pathway involved in apoptosis and the inflammatory response, and activation of NF-kB is central to the regulation of pulmonary inflammation and involved in the pathogenesis of ARDS [42] [43] [44] . LPS-induced lung injury is associated with activation of MAPKs and NF-kB signaling pathways 47 ; the inhibition of ERK or p38 protects against LPS-induced lung injury by inhibiting the NF-kB pathway 28, 48 .

Our findings imply that ACE2 may be applied to improve LPS-induced lung injury via regulation of the ACE2/ACE/AngII/Ang-(1-7)/Mas receptor, by inhibiting the JNK/NF-kB signaling pathway, and that upregulation of the ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis and inhibition of JNK/NF-kB activation may be an effective therapeutic strategy against ARDS in clinic.",
