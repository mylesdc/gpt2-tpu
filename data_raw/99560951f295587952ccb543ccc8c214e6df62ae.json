            "text": "To estimate the frequency, molecular epidemiological and clinical associations of infection with the newly described species C variants of human rhinoviruses (HRV), 3243 diagnostic respiratory samples referred for diagnostic testing in Edinburgh were screened using a VP4-encoding region-based selective polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for HRV-C along with parallel PCR testing for 13 other respiratory viruses. HRV-C was the third most frequently detected behind respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and adenovirus, with 141 infection episodes detected among 1885 subjects over 13 months (7.5%). Infections predominantly targeted the very young (median age 6-12 months; 80% of infections in those ,2 years), occurred throughout the year but with peak incidence in early winter months. HRV-C was detected significantly more frequently among subjects with lower (LRT) and upper respiratory tract (URT) disease than controls without respiratory symptoms; HRV-C mono-infections were the second most frequently detected virus (behind RSV) in both disease presentations (6.9% and 7.8% of all cases respectively). HRV variants were classified by VP4/VP2 sequencing into 39 genotypically defined types, increasing the current total worldwide to 60. Through sequence comparisons of the 59untranslated region (59UTR), the majority grouped with species A (n = 96; 68%, described as HRV-Ca), the remainder forming a phylogenetically distinct 59UTR group (HRV-Cc). Multiple and bidirectional recombination events between HRV-Ca and HRV-Cc variants and with HRV species A represents the most parsimonious explanation for their interspersed phylogeny relationships in the VP4/VP2encoding region. No difference in age distribution, seasonality or disease associations was identified between HRV-Ca and HRV-Cc variants. HRV-C-infected subjects showed markedly reduced detection frequencies of RSV and other respiratory viruses, providing evidence for a major interfering effect of HRV-C on susceptibility to other respiratory virus infections. HRV-C's disease associations, its prevalence and evidence for interfering effects on other respiratory viruses mandates incorporation of rhinoviruses into future diagnostic virology screening.",

Their genome organisation and structure are typical for picornaviruses, possessing a 7200 base single stranded RNA genome and a non-enveloped virion of approximately 30 nm in diameter. Human rhinoviruses were originally classifiable into two species, A and B with likely distinct evolutionary separate origins within the Enterovirus genus. However, they both share a primary tropism for the respiratory tract and species B and most species A variants use the intracellular adhesion molecule-1 receptor for entry [2] . Being acid-labile, HRVs do not colonise the gut, and are most commonly transmitted by the respiratory-salivary route, both by person-to-person contact and airborne transmission. In temperate countries, infections occur primarily in two peaks, the first between April and May and the second between September and October [3, 4] .",

            "text": "HRVs show remarkable genetic and antigenic heterogeneity, with 74 and 25 serotypes being classified by cross-neutralisation assays in species A and B viruses respectively. Although species C variants have not yet been isolated or cultured in vitro and therefore cannot be formally assigned into separate serotypes, existing sequence data reveals perhaps even greater genetic heterogeneity than found within HRV-A and HRV-B. The large number of distinct genetic lineages identifiable by sequence comparisons in the VP4/VP2 gene region may thus correspond to different serotypes of HRV-C [13, 18, 19] . Furthermore, sequence divergence in VP1 and other external regions of the capsid is actually greater than between different HRV-A or -B serotypes, implying the existence of major antigenic differences that influence immunological cross-protection in this newly discovered species. An additional aspect of HRV-C genetic diversity that has caused confusion in previous attempts at HRV species identification and typing is the occurrence of recombination between HRV-A and HRV-A in the 59 untranslated region (59UTR). While species A and B rhinoviruses have phylogenetically distinct sequences in this region, those from the majority of HRV-C variants resemble those of species A [19] [20] [21] , while the remainder form a phylogenetically separate group distinct from HRV-A and HRV-B and other enterovirus species. Initial data however shows no differences in clinical presentations between HRV-C variants with A and C 59UTR-like sequences (described as HRV-Ca and HRV-Cc respectively [19] ; this nomenclature will be followed in the current study).",

Non-selective amplification of all HRV (and HEV) species using previously developed 59UTRbased PCR methods would have identified an extremely large number of non-HRV-C positive samples that would preclude effective screening using pools. To overcome this, we modified the VP4/VP2-encoding region PCR previously used for genetic characterisation and (sero)type identification of HRV to enable selective amplification of HRV-C. The inner antisense primer was repositioned to a more variable position in the VP4 gene between species A, B and C sequences to enable selective hybridisation and strand extension of HRV-C sequences. The sensitivity and specificity of the selective PCR was evaluated using samples previously identified as HRV-A, -B and -C variants in a previous study [18] . All 26 species C samples were positive, along with 1 from 63 species A and 1 from 8 species B samples in the assay (sensitivity 100%; 98% specificity). Since all positive samples were to be sequenced in the more variable VP4/VP2-encoding region, this minor degree of non-specificity would not influence our identification of HRV-C positive samples for the study.",

Through genetic comparisons of the VP4/VP2-encoding region, HRV-C infections were found to be almost invariably acute/resolving with no evidence for persistence among multiply sampled individuals with the single exception of an immunocompromised child with AML. Where re-infection did occur, it was invariably by another HRV-C type, consistent with the hypothesis that species C types that have been assigned on the basis of VP4/VP2 gene sequence divergence, might nevertheless be antigenically distinct and capable of infection in those exposed previously to heterologous types. These findings are consistent with previous observations for a 10-21 day period of virus shedding of HRV in immunocompetent individuals [23] [24] [25] [26] .

We do not know and likely cannot reconstruct the actual evolutionary steps that created the complex phylogeny relationships in this genomic region, or the nature of the ancestors of currently circulating species A and C rhinoviruses. Nevertheless the most parsimonious explanation for the scattering of HRV-Cc and HRV-Ca variants in the VP4/VP2 tree is a series of recombination events early in the diversification of the ancestor of HRV-C into the current large number of types that now exist. Had there been only one recombination event between species A and C, the descendants of the original recombinant (with its more recent evolutionary origin relative to rhinoviruses circulating at that time) would be expected to have remained more closely related to each other (monophyletic) in both 59UTR and VP4/VP2 gene regions (and elsewhere in the genome). This is clearly not the case in the VP4/VP2 gene region (Fig. 1 ) or in the 59UTR; published HRV-Ca variants (those of complete genome sequences and from China) fall into at least two separate groups in the latter region [19] . The occurrence of multiple recombination events is consistent with recent observations for differences in the recombination breakpoints between different HRV-Ca and HRV-Cc variants [19] .",

However, a variant in the current study differed in 59UTR group from other members of the same type (the HRV-Ca strain R3856/ 07 clustered with HRV-Cc variants). Although these anomalous results have been verified by independent re-extraction and reamplification of the sample and other members of the clades into which it grouped, it remains formally possible that the study subject was co-infected with two different rhinovirus variants. PCR assays using 59UTR and VP4/VP2 gene primers may have amplified a different (species A-like) 59UTR sequence from that possessed by the species C virus sequenced in the VP4 gene. Notwithstanding this, another recent (intra-typic) recombination event could be inferred between a cluster of closely related HRV-Cc variants from the current study and several published HRV-Ca sequences from China that are of the same species C type (Fig. 1) . Given this evidence for frequent and likely ongoing recombination, it remains difficult to explain why there are no known species A rhinovirus recombinants with species C 59UTR sequences; perhaps ongoing recombination events are restricted to those between HRV-Ca and HRV-Cc.",

Whether inter-species recombination in rhinovirus species C (or indeed among enteroviruses) confers an evolutionary advantage remains unclear. Observations for its (likely) multiple occurrence in species C and the absence of species A rhinoviruses with group C 59UTR sequences suggests that possession of group A 59UTR may be advantageous.

The large number of HRV-C infection episodes detected over this period allowed a number of relatively robust conclusions to be drawn. Firstly, the study identifies young children and infants as the main target group for HRV-C infection among predominantly hospitalised individuals, with an age profile comparable to that of RSV. For both viruses, over 80% of infections were observed in those less than 2 years of age (Fig. 3) , higher than in AdV (77%), influenza A virus (44%) and other respiratory viruses (63%). The targeting of very young children was comparable to that observed for HRV species A (80%; [18] ) and in previous investigations of all three HRV species [13, 14, 29, 30] . HRV-C similarly resembled other rhinovirus species in its seasonal distribution (Fig. 2) , circulating throughout the year as reported for other rhinoviruses [3, 13, 25, 29, 31] . It did not however show the typically higher incidence in autumn found in other rhinoviruses (and human enteroviruses), and actually showed higher infection frequencies in winter months. However, a longer study period would be required to discount the effect of year-on-year fluctuations in the incidence of species C.",

The frequent detection of HRV-C mono-infection in a substantial proportion of subjects presenting with LRTIs and URTIs (Fig. 4) is concordant with recent PCR-based studies [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] 29, 33, 34] that demonstrate a numerically significant role for HRV-C and other rhinovirus species in severe respiratory disease requiring hospitalisation in children and exacerbation of asthma. Detection frequencies of 7-8% for HRV-C in subjects with URTIs or LRTIs was significantly higher than in those presenting without respiratory disease in the current study (3.7%), although this approximate two-fold difference in frequency was less than observed between these categories for RSV and hMPV (4-and 6.5-fold), parainfluenza viruses (5-fold), but greater than for adenoviruses and coronaviruses (1.5-and 1.8-fold) and other viruses (HBoV/HPeV; equal frequencies). To our knowledge, there is no published information on the rate of asymptomatic infections with species C rhinoviruses in hospitalised patients or in the general community. However, total HRV detection frequencies determined by PCR have produced highly variable results (2-61%; reviewed in [27] ), although averaging to 15% [35] . Taking this latter average estimate, and assuming that species C variants constitute a quarter or a third of all HRV detections (as previously found in a subset of the current study population; [18] ), then the 4%-5% predicted prevalence matches closely to that of the control group in the current study. The increased frequency in the LRTI and URTI groups is therefore consistent with its proposed aetiological role in respiratory disease among the predominantly hospitalised study subjects in the current study. Further prospectively collected information on disease severity and symptoms, along with viral load information on study subjects and controls are, however, required to further substantiate the findings reported here.",

This allowed a detailed investigation of frequencies of virus co-infections among subjects presenting with respiratory illnesses and potential interactions (positive and negative) between them. The most striking observation was the evidence for interference of RSV and other respiratory viruses (except adenovirus) by HRV-C. For example, the 10.7% detection frequency of RSV among single-infected individuals was markedly reduced among those co-infected with HRV-C (2.4%). A comparable reduction was observed in the ''other virus'' category (predominantly parainfluenza and coronaviruses with a 3.5-fold difference). RSV showed a more modest effect on detection frequencies in this latter category (less than two-fold reduction). The further observation that the presence of RSV or other viruses did not conversely influence HRV-C detection frequencies is consistent with HRV-C interfering with susceptibility to infection with other RNA viruses rather than the opposite. Negative interactions in detection frequency and viral loads comparable to those observed between these RNA virus groups have been previously described between different pairs of respiratory viruses, and report significant interfering effects of HRV (all species) on RSV and a range of other RNA viruses [36, 37] . In contrast to the latter study, we additionally found positive interactions, with significantly higher detection frequencies of RSV and other RNA viruses in AdV-positive samples.",

            "text": "Interpreting the mechanisms underlying these observations of virus interference is complex. One unknown factor in this and previous studies that may significantly contribute to the outcome of a virus/virus interaction is the order of acquisition of infections. For example, it has been hypothesised that the strong interferon (IFN) response in the respiratory tract induced by HRV infection may create an environment hostile to infection with other viruses, such as RSV [36] . Even though RSV, through expression of NS-1, can prevent IFN induction on infection of a cell [38] , this countermeasure may be largely ineffective in a respiratory tract already induced into an antiviral state by prior infection with HRV-C. If, however, RSV infected the respiratory tract first, then this would have no effect on the subsequent susceptibility of the individual to HRV. The rapid and highly cytopathic replication cycle of rhinoviruses (and enteroviruses) that seems designed to infect and escape from cells before IFN-mediated responses become effective, may indeed have a more general interfering effect on more sensitive RNA (and DNA viruses) that infect the respiratory tract. Like RSV, successful colonisation of the respiratory tract by coronaviruses, influenza and parainfluenza viruses is dependent on a wide variety of evolved mechanisms to evade intracellular defences [39, 40] that are ineffective in presensitised cells induced by IFN into an antiviral state.",

AdVs express a plethora of evasion molecules that substantially influences both the intracellular environment of the cell it infects and also has a broader paracrine effect on cytokine production in the respiratory tract and induction of local immunity [41] . The frequent long term persistence of AdV infections suggests that a more permissive environment for infection and replication by other viruses may exist in the respiratory tract of AdV-infected individual, and underlie the increased detection frequencies of HRV-C, RSV and other respiratory viruses in coinfected subjects (Fig. 5) .",

            "text": "In summary, this study provides evidence for the substantial clinical impact of HRV species C infections in young children, their associations with respiratory disease and interfering effects on susceptibility to other virus infections. Future studies should illuminate the extent to which these observations are specific to species C and which are shared with other rhinoviruses. The recent surge of interest in rhinoviruses following the unexpected discovery of species C will undoubtedly contribute to a major reappraisal of the roles of all three species in paediatric respiratory disease. [18] . Samples comprised predominantly nasopharyngeal or tracheal aspirates or swabs (n = 1771), throat swabs (n = 619) and bronchoalveolar lavages (n = 155), and were routinely screened for the following respiratory viruses by PCR: adenovirus (AdV), influenza A and B, parainfluenza virus types 1-3 (PIV1-3) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) using previously described assays [42, 43] . Samples were further tested for human bocavirus (HBoV), human parechovirus (HPeV) [44] , human metapneumovirus (hMPV) [45] and coronaviruses HKU1, OC43, 229E and NL63 (Gaunt et al., manuscript in preparation). All but 94 (2.9%) of the tested samples were referred from hospital inpatients or from Accident and Emergency Departments. Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) were identified in subjects presenting with the following symptoms or diagnoses: bronchiolitis, chest infections, pneumonia, respiratory failure, shortness of breath, apnoea and wheeze; upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) with coryza, sore throat, tonsillitis and tracheitis. Cough was also classified as an URTI symptom, although we acknowledge its additional potential association with lower respiratory tract disease that leads to some potential misclassification of disease categories in the absence of other respiratory symptoms. Subjects with no relevant respiratory symptoms included the referral categories of vomiting, diarrhoea, trauma and elective cardiac surgery.",

Reverse transcription of RNA extracted from individual samples or pools of ten with random hexamers used the RT system (Promega, United Kingdom) as described previously [44] . Amplification of the HRV-C VP4/VP2-encoding region used previously described primers and reaction conditions [18] , with a repositioned antisense inner primer (ATA GTR ATT TGY TTD AGC CTA TCD GAV A; 59 base at position 888 numbered here and elsewhere according to the HRV species B reference sequence NC_001490) for selective amplification of HRV-C (see Results). Underlined bases were designed to mismatch species A or B (or both) sequences while being conserved within species C. Positive samples were subsequently amplified with the four original VP4/VP2 gene primers [18] and the amplicon directly sequenced. Sequences generated from this study were edited and aligned with published sequences using the Simmonics sequence editor v1.7 ([46] , http://www.virus-evolution.org). Published sequences included the 9 complete genome sequences of HRV-C available on GenBank and all species C VP4(/VP2) gene sequences available on GenBank in August 2009. HRV-C types were putatively assigned by phylogenetic analysis and uncorrected pairwise distance measurements using the previously proposed 10% divergence threshold [18] . Phylogenetic trees were constructed by neighbour joining from 100 samplings of maximum-compositelikelihood (MCL) distances using the MEGA 4.0 software package [47] with pairwise deletion for missing data. VP4/VP2 sequences generated in this study have been assigned GenBank accession numbers GU294336-GU294480.",
