Equine endothelial cells (EECs) were infected with the virulent Bucyrus strain (VBS) of EAV and expression of IFN-was measured at mRNA and protein levels by quantitative real-time RT-PCR and IFN bioassay using vesicular stomatitis virus expressing the green fluorescence protein (VSV-GFP), respectively. Quantitative RT-PCR results showed that IFN-mRNA levels in EECs infected with EAV VBS were not increased compared to those in mock-infected cells. Consistent with quantitative RT-PCR, Sendai virus-(SeV-) induced type I IFN production was inhibited by EAV infection. Using an IFN-promoter-luciferase reporter assay, we subsequently demonstrated that EAV nsps 1, 2, and 11 had the capability to inhibit type I IFN activation. Of these three nsps, nsp1 exhibited the strongest inhibitory effect. Taken together, these data demonstrate that EAV has the ability to suppress the type I IFN production in EECs and nsp1 may play a critical role to subvert the equine innate immune response.",

            "text": "Equine arteritis virus (EAV) is the causative agent of equine viral arteritis, a respiratory and reproductive disease of horses [1, 2] . EAV is a small enveloped virus with a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome of \u223c12.7 kb. It belongs to the family Arteriviridae (genus Arterivirus, order Nidovirales), which also includes porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV), and lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV) of mice [3] [4] [5] . The EAV genome includes at least ten known functional open reading frames (ORFs 1a, 1b, 2a, 2b, 3, 4, 5a, 5b, 6, and 7) [5] [6] [7] . ORFs 1a and 1b are located at the 5 -proximal three-quarters of the genome and are translated to produce replicase polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab (1,727 and 3,175 amino acids, resp.). Translation of ORF1b depends on a \u22121 ribosomal frameshift located just before termination of ORF1a translation [8] . The two replicase precursor polyproteins are cleaved by three ORF1a-encoded proteases that reside in nsp1, nsp2, and nsp4, yielding at least 13 end-products, namely, nonstructural proteins (nsps) 1 to 12, including a recently described nsp7 and 7 [5, 9, 10] . The remaining eight ORFs (2a, 2b, and 3, 4, 5a, 5b, and 6-7) are located in the 3 quarter of the genome and encode the structural proteins (E, GP2, GP3, GP4, ORF5a protein, GP5, M, and N, resp.) of the virus [5, 6, 11-13].",

            "text": "Type I interferon (IFN-/ ) is a key component of the host innate immune response to viral infection [14] . Recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) in double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) by intracellular receptors, such as retinoic acid inducible gene I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated antigen 5 (MDA-5) [15] , activates protein signaling cascades that result in the activation of transcription factors, including interferon regulatory factor-3 (IRF-3) and nuclear factor-B (NF-B) [14] . The IFNpromoter contains positive regulatory domains (PRDs), including the binding sites for different transcription factors, IRF-3 (PRDs I and III) and NF-B (PRD II). Activation of these transcription factors triggers the formation of enhanceosomes in the cell nucleus and induces the expression of IFN-/ [14, 16] . Both IRF-3 and NF-B activation are mediated by mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS) protein, which functions downstream of RIG-I and MDA-5 and upstream of the I B kinase (IKK) complex and TANKbinding kinase-1 (TBK1) [17] [18] [19] [20] . Among the various factors involved in type I IFN production, IRF-3 plays a critical role. IRF-3 is expressed in most cell types and resides in the cytoplasm in an inactive form. When stimulated, IRF-3 becomes phosphorylated and undergoes conformational changes, resulting in dimerization with the exposure of nuclear localization signal. In the nucleus, IRF-3 recruits coactivator CBP/p300 and forms a complex to bind IRF-3 responsive elements (PRDs I and III) of the IFN-promoter [14] . In addition to IRF-3, NF-B is also a critical regulator of host innate and adaptive immunity. It plays an important role in the regulation of cell proliferation as well as cell survival. Many viruses have evolved strategies to counteract key elements of the IFN response and prevent development of an antiviral response in the host [14] . Through evolution, viruses can either activate or inhibit the NF-B pathway in order to replicate in host cells. Viruses such as African swine fever virus and influenza A virus block NF-B activation to counteract the host innate immune response [21, 22] . In contrast, viruses such as hepatitis C virus, reovirus, and herpes simplex virus have developed mechanisms to directly activate NF-B to support production of progeny viruses and intracellular spreading [23] [24] [25] .",

Recently, van Kasteren et al. [33] reported that the EAV PLP2 has deubiquitylation function which suppresses RIG-I to control innate immune signaling in EAV-infected cells [34, 35] . In all these studies, the investigators have used recombinant proteins (e.g., nsp2 protein of EAV) and a specific immune suppression mechanism. However, the effect of the whole virus and involvement of other EAV proteins in the suppression of host cell immune responses are largely unknown. To elucidate the molecular mechanism of EAV involved in host immune suppression, the objective of this study was to investigate the effect of EAV on type I IFN production and to further identify the specific viral proteins responsible for the suppression of IFNactivity.

HeLa cells (NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, Germantown, MD) were propagated in minimum essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS in a humidified incubator with 5% CO 2 at 37 \u2218 C. MDBK (ATCC CCL-22) cells were grown in Eagle's minimum essential medium with 10% ferritin-supplemented bovine calf serum (HyClone Laboratories, Inc., Logan, UT) and 100 U/ g per mL penicillinstreptomycin (Gibco, Carlsbad, CA). The virulent Bucyrus strain of EAV (EAV VBS, horse passage 15 pleural fluid; ATCC VR-796, Manassas, VA) was passaged once in EECs to obtain high-titered working stocks for the present study using the method described previously [37] . Sendai virus, the Cantell strain (SeV; ATCC VR-907, Manassas, VA), was propagated in embryonated chicken eggs. The virus titer was determined by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay using chicken red blood cells as described previously [38] .

Equine pulmonary endothelial cells (EECs) were infected with EAV VBS at an m.o.i. of 5 for 8 h, followed by infection with SeV for 3 or 6 hpi. SeV-alone-infected cells were used as positive control for type I IFN induction and mock-infected cells were used as negative control. As shown in Figure 1 (a), IFN-mRNA was barely detected in cells infected with EAV alone, whereas SeV infection induced a strong expression, approximately 190-200-fold increase of IFN-mRNA expression level in comparison to that of mock-infected cells at 3 or 6 hpi. In contrast, SeV-induced IFN-mRNA expression, at both 3 and 6 hpi, was significantly suppressed in cells previously infected with EAV. In parallel with the quantitative measurement of IFN-mRNA, EAV-induced suppression of IFN production was confirmed by IFN bioassay using VSV-GFP, since VSV is IFN sensitive and presence of IFN-/ blocks VSV replication. EECs were either infected with EAV or SeV alone or infected with both EAV and SeV. Mock-infected cells were used as negative control. Subsequently, MDBK cells were incubated with two-fold serial dilutions of virus-inactivated cell culture supernatant and then infected with VSV-GFP. The VSV infectivity was determined by monitoring the level of GFP expression. As shown in Figure 1(b) , VSV-GFP replicated well in cell culture supernatant from mock-infected cells, while VSV replication was effectively inhibited in those MDBK cells that were preincubated with supernatant from SeVinfected EECs. No VSV-GFP replication was observed up to a dilution of 1 : 32 of the culture supernatant from SeV-infected cells. In contrast, VSV-GFP replication was not inhibited in MDBK cells that were preincubated with cell culture supernatant from EECs infected with EAV alone. Consistent with quantitative RT-PCR results, SeV-induced type I IFN production was significantly inhibited by EAV exposure since VSV-GFP replication was detected at a lower level compared to that from EECs only infected with SeV. Taken together, the data suggest that EAV has an ability to suppress the induction of IFN in infected cells.",

Each of the 12 nspencoding regions from the genome of EAV VBS was cloned individually into a mammalian expression vector, pCAGGS [40] . The expression of recombinant proteins in the plasmid DNA transfected cells was verified by immunofluorescence assay (Figure 2(a) ). To determine whether these nsps have an effect on IFN-activation, we used an IFN-promoterluciferase reporter assay. HEK293T cells were cotransfected with individual nsp-expressing plasmid and the luciferase reporter plasmid (p125-Luc) along with a Renilla luciferase expression plasmid (pRL-SV40) for normalizing purpose of sample expression levels. As a positive control, pCAGGS-NS1 plasmid expressing swine influenza virus NS1 (sw-ns1) gene was used to cotransfect the cells with the reporter plasmid, since sw-ns1 is a known IFN antagonist [52] . At 24 h after transfection, cells were infected with SeV to induce luciferase production. The IFN-promoter-luciferase reporter assay result is presented in Figure 2 (b). As we expected, the expression of sw-ns1 significantly inhibited IFN-promoter-driven luciferase expression. In contrast, a strong reporter signal was observed in cells transfected with empty pCAGGS plasmid after infection with SeV. IFNpromoter activation by SeV infection was suppressed to various degrees by expression of several EAV nsps, among which nsp1, nsp2, and nsp11 showed strong inhibition of IFN-promoter-driven luciferase expression. In particular, nsp1 exhibited the strongest inhibitory effect, followed by nsp11 and nsp2. The results suggest that several EAV nsps are capable of suppressing IFN-promoter activation.",

Since MDA-5 or RIG-I is associated with the MAVS complex, cells were cotransfected with a plasmid expressing RIG-I, MDA-5, or MAVS protein, a plasmid expressing EAV nsp1, the plasmid pRL-SV40, and the p55-CIB-Luc reporter plasmid.

Therefore, we further tested the effect of EAV nsp1 on TRIF-and IKKmediated IFN-induction. The results showed that nsp1 had the ability to suppress TBK1-and IKK -mediated reporter gene expression (Figures 4(d) and 4(e) ).

For example, Ebola, Nipah, and SARS-CoV encode multiple viral proteins capable of inhibiting interferon activity, suggesting important roles for these proteins in pathogenesis and disease outcome [55] [56] [57] [58] . In this study, we investigated whether EAV has the ability to interfere with the host innate immune response, in particular, type I IFN production. Our results demonstrated that EAV infection in EECs significantly inhibited type I IFN production at both mRNA and protein levels, whereas infection with SeV stimulated a high level of type I IFN production. Furthermore, EAV infection significantly inhibited SeV-induced type I IFN production as well. Based on IFN-promoter-luciferase reporter assay results, three EAV nonstructural proteins, nsp1, nsp2, and nsp11, were identified as potential IFN antagonists. Previous studies reported that EAV nsp2-encoded papain-like proteinase (PLP2) is capable of inhibiting Ub-and ISG15-dependent innate immune responses [34, 35, 59] . The EAV nsp11 encodes NendoU endoribonuclease [60] , which is highly cytotoxic upon its in vitro expression. In PRRSV, the homologous nsp11 was proposed to be an IFN antagonist [26, 31, 61] . However, whether this effect is due to the cytosolic version of the enzyme targeting on the overall RNA population of the cell or the specific suppression of IFN production needs to be determined in the future. It could be possible that the three potential immune antagonists of EAV, nsp1, nsp2, and nsp11, target different parts of the host cellular immune system and their synergistic effect during the course of infection could be able to shut down the host cell innate immune response completely. This may explain why the induction of interferon and some immunomodulatory cytokines are inhibited during in vivo EAV infection [62] .",

            "text": "Further analysis revealed that EAV nsp1 inhibited two key signaling pathways for IFN-activation, the IRF-3-and NF-B-dependent signaling pathways. In our study, EAV nsp1 blocked each signaling step upstream of IRF-3 or NF-B activation, suggesting that EAV nsp1 acts downstream of all those tested steps in both signaling pathways. Immunofluorescence microscopy analysis further showed that nsp1 did not have much effect on the nuclear accumulation of IRF-3 and NF-B. Therefore, we postulated that EAV nsp1 might have an effect on the IFN-promoter inside the nucleus. Previous studies have shown that PRRSV nsp1 / modulates type I IFN response by blocking dsRNA-induced IRF-3 activation and IFN promoter activities, but IRF-3 phosphorylation and its nuclear translocation occur normally in the presence of the nsp1 / [51] . Recent study reported that PRRSV nsp1 blocks the IRF-3 activation by degrading the CREB (cyclic AMP response element binding)-binding protein (CBP) and subsequently inhibiting formation of enhanceosomes in the nucleus [51, 63] . EAV nsp1 was reported to be largely nuclear located, similar to PRRSV nsp1 [68] , suggesting that it may have an effect on the formation of the transcription enhanceosome on the IFN-promoter inside the nucleus. However, PRRSV nsp1 does not degrade CBP or interrupt the formation of enhanceosome [68] . Thus, EAV nsp1 may have a unique function in modulating the IFN production in the nucleus. The EAV nsp1 does not contain the traditional nuclear localization signal [68] , which suggests that nsp1 might be bound with cellular protein(s) and shuttled into the nucleus. Further studies are required to map the exact point(s) on the IFN induction pathway at which EAV nsp1 acts. It will be interesting to determine the requirement for nuclear localization of the EAV nsp1 that relates to its interferon antagonist function.",
