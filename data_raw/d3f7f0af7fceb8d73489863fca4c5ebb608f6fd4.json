The membrane (M) protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is highly abundant during viral infections and is a critical element for viral assembly. Nucleotide substitution in the viral genome occurs frequently during SARS-CoV infection. In the current study, we analyzed the M gene sequences derived from 15 SARS-CoV isolates and uncovered six nucleotide substitutions among these isolates. Interestingly, these nucleotide substitutions are all located at the 5' half of the M gene. Based on this information and previous reports, we created two novel siRNAs targeting two unexploited and well conserved regions in the M gene. The effects of these two siRNAs were tested by semi-quantitative RT-PCR and EGFP-M fusion gene expression. The results demonstrated that both siRNAs effectively and specifically blocked the targeted gene expression. Real time quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) revealed that siRNA targeting the 3' half of the M gene (si-M2) induced more potent inhibition than that targeting the 5' half (si-M1). Both si-M1 and si-M2 significantly downregulated M gene mediated upregulation of interferon \uf062 expression. Thus, our results indicate that SARS-CoV M gene specific siRNA might function in a sequence-dependent manner.",

A better siRNA should be designed to target the conserved region of the targeted gene. Therefore, we compared the M genes derived from 15 isolates of SARS-CoV. These isolates were Tor2 (AY274119), BJ02 (AY278487), HZS2-FB (AY394987), ZJ01 (AY297028), Sin2748 (AY283797), ShanghaiQXC1 (AY463059), CUHK-AG01 (AY345986), PUMC01 (AY350750), JDM (AY394988), GZ-B (AY394978), TC1 (AY338174), GZ-C (AY394979), ZS-C (AY95003), LC1 (AY394998.1) and HKU-39849 (AY278491). Sequence alignment revealed that there were six nucleotide substitutions in the M genes among these isolates ( Figure 1 ). Interestingly, all six nucleotide substitutions (nt80, 189, 203, 256, 339 and 356) are located within the 5' half (first 360nt) of M gene (total 666nt), indicating that higher mutations are associated with the 5' portion of the M gene. Previously, a number of M gene siRNAs based on random selection have been reported [14, 16, 18] . Considering the nucleotide substitutions in M gene as well as the previous reports, we chose two unexploited regions that were well conserved in the M genes among the 15 isolates of SARS-CoV. One targeting site was at +221\uf07e+242nt and the other at +466\uf07e+486nt relative to the 5' ATG initiation codon ( Figure 1 ).",

M gene was also fused with the EGFP gene to make the pEGFP-M construct. The effect of siRNA on M gene expression was monitored by both RT-PCR and EGFP expression. Figure 3a demonstrated a significant reduction in M gene expression as the ratio of M to si-M1 reaching 1:8. Quantitation of the band intensity revealed about a 2\uf07e3 fold reduction in M mRNAs as co-transfecting with higher doses of si-M1 ( Figure 3b ). Moreover, a marked inhibition on EGFP-M, but not EGFP expression was observed when administrated with higher doses of si-M1 ( Figure 3c ). The specificity of si-M1 on M gene expression was further confirmed by using a non-specific siRNA, si-IL17RE, as a negative control. Higher doses of si-M1 but not si-IL-17RE effectively inhibited EGFP-M gene expression (Figure 3d ). Flow cytometric analysis indicates that the intensity of EGFP-M gene expression was significantly inhibited by si-M1 but not si-IL17RE as the delivered dose increased ( Figure 3e ). Similarly, si-M2 which targeted at the 3' half of M gene also dramatically inhibited M mRNAs by about 7\uf07e8 fold when the molar ratio of si-M2:M was increased to 8:1 (Figures 4a and 4b) . si-M2 mediated EGFP gene inhibition was also markedly induced when a higher dose of si-M2 was co-transfected with EGFP-M fusion gene but not with EGFP gene (Figure 4c ).",

Our data shows that the M protein was not present in the soluble fraction, but can be readily detected in cell pellets, indicating that M protein has the propensity to self-aggregate. SARS-CoV M genes were derived from 15 different viral isolates and it was found that nucleotide substitutions were exclusively located at the 5' half of the M gene (the first 360 nt). Two novel and conserved siRNA target sites were identified and tested. Both siRNAs (si-M1 and si-M2) could effectively inhibit M gene expression post-transcriptionally and functioned in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, si-M2 targeting the 3' half of the M gene produced more potent inhibition than that of si-M1 that recognized a conserved sequence at the 5' half of the M gene. This observation is consistent with a previous report described by Qin et al. [15] . The less inhibitory effect induced by si-M1 was correlated with a higher chance of mutation in the targeted region nearby (such as nt203 and nt256). Moreover, our study indicates that both si-M1 and si-M2 were able to functionally counteract the M gene-mediated INF\uf062 production. This study indicates that siRNA mediated M gene inhibition might be determined by the sequence content presented at or around the targeted site.",
