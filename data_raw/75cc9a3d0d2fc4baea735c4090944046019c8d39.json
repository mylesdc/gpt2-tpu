''Eda'' was inserted between P1 and P19 residues of hfurin 98-112 peptide, derived from the primary cleavage site of furin's own prodomain. The resulting hexadecapeptide derivative inhibited furin in vitro with IC 50 ,40 nM when measured against the fluorogenic substrate Boc-RVRR-MCA. It also inhibited furin-mediated cleavage of a fluorogenic peptide derived from hSARS-CoV spike protein with IC 50 ,193 nM. Additionally it also blocked furin-processing of growth factors proPDGF-A, B and VEGF-C that are linked to tumor genesis and cancer. Circular dichroism study showed that this inhibitor displayed a predominantly beta-turn structure while western blots confirmed its ability to protect furin protein from self degradation.",

            "text": "Furin is a crucial member of Ca +2 -dependent mammalian subtilases collectively known as Proprotein Convertases (PCs) or Proprotein Convertase Subtilisin/Kexins (PCSKs). This membrane bound type 1 protease is responsible for tissue-specific endoproteolytic cleavage of a large variety of inactive protein precursors at the general sequence motif (K/R)-(X)n-(R) Q (where n = 0, 2, 4 or 6 and X is usually any amino acid other than Cys), leading to functionally active secretory proteins and polypeptides [1] [2] [3] . Among the known furin substrates are the precursors of hormones, neuropeptides, growth factors, adhesion molecules, receptors, surface proteins, viral glycoproteins and bacterial toxins [2] . Based on above findings and accumulated studies in the literature, furin has been strongly linked to tumorgenesis, hormonal diseases, neurological dementia and a variety of infectious diseases caused by ebola, avian, Hong Kong, HIV, human SARS corona viruses as well as bacterial pathogenesis due to anthrax toxin, aerolysin etc [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . Owing to these results, this enzyme is considered as a potential prognostic factor for several diseases. Therefore many researchers including us became interested in the development of potent and specific furin inhibitors that may possess important biochemical, clinical and therapeutic applications. Until now, several macromolecules and small compound furin inhibitors have been reported in the literature [reviewed in 10, 11] . While all macromolecule furin inhibitors are of protein types either endogenous or biologically engineered, the small molecule inhibitors are largely synthetic peptide, peptidomimetic or fully non-peptide compounds [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] . Owing to increased stability, enhanced bioavailability, improved drug like property and easy accessibility by synthetic means, small molecule inhibitors are always preferred over proteins for therapeutic use [28] . Among the various inhibitor design strategies so far reported, the prodomain approach attracted most attention because of its effectiveness, versatility and sometimes enhanced selectivity [18, 26] . Besides this approach, incorporation of noncleavable pseudo peptide bond [29] or unnatural amino acid [30] at P1-P19 site of a potent peptide substrate based on prodomain or physiological protein sequence has also been used successfully to design inhibitors of PC enzymes. Based on somewhat similar idea, herein, we report for the first time, a new and innovative strategy for the design of a potent furin inhibitor. Our approach was primarily based on a specially constructed unnatural amino acid called ''Eda or enediynyl amino acid'' and its incorporation at the cleavage site of prodomain sequence of furin whose primary role is to regulate the protease activity by providing proper folding after binding. We show that incorporation of this highly reactive betaturn inducing aromatic ''Eda'' moiety at the scissile P1-P19 amide bond of a prodomain peptide of human furin led to a potent furininhibitor with inhibition constant K i and IC 50 in low nM ranges. For many years, enediynes and their derivatives were known to bind and cleave DNA especially of cancer cells through their oxidative actions. This occurred via in situ generation of bisradicals by Bergman cyclo-aromatization reaction [31] . The ease of this cyclization depends on the nature and structure of enediynes [32] [33] [34] [35] . Thus cyclic diynes of 8-10 member size as well as aza-enediynes have been shown to efficiently undergo Bergman cyclization under the induction of light, metal ions or elevated temperature due to their low activation barrier [reviewed in 32] . Due to this unique ability to cyclize and produce reactive bis-radicals, several enediyne derivatives have been designed as reactive species especially for DNA degradation [36] [37] [38] [39] . So far several enediynes of both synthetic and fungal metabolite origins have been shown to display strong antitumor activity [31, 40] . Subsequently a few of these compounds have been approved as anti-cancer drugs. In a recent study Jones et al. examined the viability of proteins as targets of thermally and photo-activated enediyne derivatives and confirmed at the molecular level. They have shown that specifically designed enediyne derivatives can degrade proteins under suitable conditions [41] [42] [43] . Based on this observation, we hypothesize that such functional derivatives may also interact with catalytically active proteins such as protease like furin and thereby regulate its enzymatic and functional activity. For efficient binding with the target enzyme furin, we propose that such above moiety must carry a furin recognition peptide sequence. Thus we prepared a novel enediynyl peptide using a combination of organic and peptide chemistry and demonstrated its potent furin inhibitory activity both in vitro and cellular models. We first described the synthesis of Fmoc-protected ''Eda'' and then incorporated it into a furin substrate namely hfurin 98-112 peptide at its furin cleavage site. The biochemical study showing anti-furin activity of this peptide analog towards a fluorogenic peptide substrate as well as physiological precursor proteins such as growth factors proPDGF-A, B and proVEGF-C are described in the present study.",

            "text": "Most aromatic enediyne compounds are chemically highly reactive and can easily generate upon heating reactive bis-radical species via Bergman cyclo-aromatization reaction [31, 32] . It is a possibility that these reactive intermediates may then react with one or more of the catalytic amino acid residues His, Ser or Asp of PC-enzymes leading to chemical modifications of latter. This notion is supported by several studies involving interactions of amino acids either free or within protein sequences [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] . Based on this rationale we proposed that such types of molecules may therefore inhibit the protease activities of these enzymes. To test this hypothesis, we first synthesized several aromatic enediyne derivatives [44] and examined in vitro their effects on proteolytic activities of three key members of PC-family enzymes namely furin, PC5 and PC7. In vitro enzyme assay of PCs against Boc-RVRR-MCA substrate (50 mM) , in the absence and presence of various synthetic aromatic enediyne compounds ( Fig. 1 ) indicated weak to modest inhibitory activities of these compounds. Among the PCs examined, the most potent inhibitory activity was noted against PC7 for compound AB-2 which displayed an IC 50 value of 8.5 mM. For furin, the highest inhibitory activity was also noted with AB-2 with IC 50 value of 10.5 mM. Except for minor protease activating effect of AB-3 towards PC7, all other enediyne compounds exhibited inhibitory effects towards furin, PC5 and PC7 with IC 50 values ranging from 8.5 to 160 mM depending on the nature of the enzyme and the enediyne compound used. This is the first report of PC-inhibitory activity of an enediyne compound. This finding prompted us to the idea of incorporating an enediyne function within a peptide sequence which may enhance the potency and selectivity of furin inhibition. To accomplish this, we designed and synthesized an enediynyl amino acid (Eda) derivative with its amino terminal protected by Fmoc (9H-fluoren-9ylmethoxy carbonyl) group so that it can be directly used in solid phase peptide synthesis.",

It is likely that such a peptide analog will be sensitive to changes in pH, metal ion concentrations and other environmental conditions such as UV light [32] that may lead to the formation of a cyclic derivative (IIa) (Fig. 2B) via Bergman cyclo-aromatization reaction. Such chemical transformation and modification may induce protease inhibitory activity to the peptide derivative. Peptide (II) was synthesized by HATU/ DIEA (Diisopropyl ethyl amine) mediated solid phase Fmoc chemistry [18, 26] and purified by RP-HPLC (Fig. 4A , upper panel) using a C 18 semipreparative column. The peak eluting at Rt = 26.5 min was collected and analyzed by a second HPLC-run on an analytical C 18 column when it exhibited a single peak at nearly identical retention time showing its high degree of purity (Fig. 4A, lower panel) . The identity of the peptide was further confirmed by SELDI-tof mass spectrometry which displayed a peak at m/z = 2111 in consistent with its calculated molecular weight (MW = 2110) (Fig. 4B ). The second peak observed at m/z = 2128 may be due to the formation of an oxidized form of II, since it is ,16 mass unit higher than the molecular ion. However other explanation may also exist.",

The progress curve assay (Fig. 5A ), indicated that 125 nM of (II) was able to block furin activity almost completely against the above substrate (20 mM). As measured by the slope (s) of each curve shown within parenthesis in the graph, this effect was found to be concentration-dependent. The measured IC 50 value was found to be ,70 nM. Furthermore, Dixon plots based on stoptime assay at three different substrate concentrations 10, 20 and 40 mM, (Fig. 5B ) indicated an inhibition constant (K i ) of 39.6 nM for furin inhibition by (II). The pattern of the graph also confirmed the competitive nature of inhibition suggesting the binding of Eda-peptide with the catalytic domain of furin. Using another substrate namely the intramolecularly quenched fluorogenic peptide (Abz-AEQDRNTR 761 QEVFAQ-Tyx-A), where Abz = 2-amino benzoic acid, Tyx = 3-nitro tyrosine) derived human SARS corona virus spike protein [8] , we noted that (II) blocked its processing with measured IC 50 value being ,193612 nM (Fig. 5C ). [48] and the 83-mer synthetic full length prodomain protein of hfurin [49] . Like these two inhibitors, our Eda-peptide was also able to block efficiently the cleavage of 22 kDa pro-PDGF-A to 14 kDa mature PDGF-A ( Fig. 6 , upper panel). This was reflected by the strong appearance of 22 kDa proPDGF-A band which was completely absent in the control experiment done in parallel without the presence of any inhibitor. In addition Fig. 6 (lower panel, right) showed by western blot using VEGF-C antibody, the effect of furin-Eda-peptide (50 mM) on furin-mediated processing of proVEGF-C in CHO cells. The effect was compared in parallel with that done with the known furin inhibitor dec-RVRR-cmk. The figure illustrated that like dec-RVRR-cmk, 50 mM of furin-Eda peptide was able to block significantly the cleavage of 50 kDa proVEGF-C to 28 kDa mature VEGF-C, confirming its furin inhibitory activity under ex vivo condition.",

We therefore postulate that the observed inhibition of furin activity by furin-Eda-peptide may be mediated by the cyclic (IIa) rather than the acyclic (II) form. Our postulate is based on the speculation that the potency of binding will be increased upon cyclo-aromatization reaction due to increased p-stacking interaction. Further work using proton NMR spectroscopy would be necessary to provide more convincing evidence for the above hypothesis [51] . However owing to above proposition, docking studies were performed between various domains of furin particularly its P-domain and the cyclized furin-Eda-peptide (IIa) using autodock program. The results were shown in Figs. 10A and 10B (expanded) which revealed an efficient docking and potent interaction with the C-terminal segment of furin within the residues 487 AQAR----------ANNY 560 . A more detail investigation revealed strong H-bond interactions among several residues within the domain (Val 548 ---------Glu-Ala 557 ) and the cyclized furin-Eda peptide (Fig. 10B , enlarged portion). In fact our docking results identified a small segment 548 VLEIENT-SEA 557 that interacts best with the cyclized Eda peptide (IIa). No significant interactions were noticed with the acyclic furin-Edapeptide (II) suggesting the possibility that (IIa) might be the species responsible for interaction with furin as indicated above and this may ultimately lead to inhibition of furin activity which is composed of crucial catalytic residues D 153 , H 194 , and S 368 as well as the oxyanion N 295 .",

The spectra showed that the peptide exists mostly in beta-sheet and random structures with very little helix content (,10%) under all pH conditions (5.5-8.0) tested. There were slight changes in CD profile particularly at 200-205 nm area following changes in pH condition. This may possibly due to partial transformation of sheet structure to random or turn structure. Addition of fluorinated alcohol such as TFE (a helix promoting solvent) led to the formation of significant helical structure at the expense of its sheet structure (Fig. 11B) .

            "text": "In addition to above, our study for the first time showed that an enedynyl peptide can inhibit the protease activity of a PC enzyme such as furin. However while this manuscript is under review, the inhibition of chymotrypsin by an enediynyl peptide was reported in the literature [53] . Thus here we revealed that incorporating an enediynyl ''Eda'' function -a highly reactive and beta turn inducing amino acid [44] at the junction of P1-P19 residues of a furin substrate derived from its prodomain primary catalytic site, led to a highly potent furin inhibitor. Other properly designed unnatural amino acids may also be incorporated instead of ''Eda'' to design other furin inhibitors. In the present design as our first choice, the prodomain sequence comprising (98-110) amino acid residues of human preprofurin was selected as the substrate. The significance of prodomain as well as its removal and or degradation during furin activation have been well documented in the past [2, 3, 5] and more recently in [54] . The presented data based on progress curve, Dixon plot and sigmoidal graph (Fig. 5) all indicated that furin-Eda-peptide (II) is a strong inhibitor of Proprotein Convertase furin. Furthermore the data confirmed the competitive nature of inhibition which was also supported by CD and fluorescence studies. The data also suggested that the furin inhibition by Eda-peptide is independent of the nature of the substrate used -be it a small peptide or a physiological protein. In fact (II) inhibited furin cleavages of hSARS coV peptide [55] as well as physiological protein substrates such as growth factor precursers. Although in the present study ''Eda'' was introduced between P1/P19 amino acids, it will be more logical to replace or substitute P19 residue by ''Eda'' which is expected to lead to even more potent and/or selective inhibitor of furin. Besides, other peptides substrates of furin derived from the processing site of its physiological proproteins can be employed to validate this new hypothesis of ours for protease inhibitor design. These aspects are currently being investigated in the laboratory.",

            "text": "Our studies involving cell lines expressing furin and its physiological substrates proPDGF-A, proVEGF-C and proPDGF-B indicated that Eda-peptide when added exogenously into the culture media during cell growth can efficiently block furin-mediated processing of above substrates leading to their bioactive mature forms in a concentration dependent manner. In most cases the effects with our furin-Eda peptide were comparable to those observed with the known furin inhibitors a1-Pdx [50] and Dec-RVRR-cmk [48] . In other cases the effects were slightly less pronounced but still significant. Thus for example western blot results showed that 50 mM of Eda-peptide blocked furin-mediated processing of proVEGF-C to mature VEGF-C to a similar extent compared to that obtained with 10 mM Dec-RVRR-cmk (Fig. 6) . Similar observation was also noted for proPDGF-A processing. However, the Eda peptide was found to be more effective in blocking the cleavage of proPDGF-B. In fact, both Eda-peptide and a1-Pdx suppressed the cleavage of proPDGF-B to its mature form almost with identical efficiency (Fig. 7) . Thus both in vitro and ex vivo studies involving small peptide as well as natural protein substrates confirmed the potent anti-furin activity of Eda-peptide (II). The observed K i and IC 50 values for Eda-peptide as measured against Boc-RVRR-MCA were found to be higher than that observed with bioengineered protein a1-Pdx [50] but were still in low nM range. Our studies confirmed that Eda-peptide can block furin cleavage of fluorogenic peptides as well as physiologically relevant proteins proPDGF-A, B and proVEGF-C. Proteolytic activation of these growth factor precursor proteins has been linked to tumor growth and progression as shown by the high level of expression of their mature forms in cancer cells compared to normal ones [7, [56] [57] [58] . Thus above research findings suggested that our Eda-peptide may play an important role in tumor suppression and intervention via the blockade of maturation by furin of precursor growth factor proteins. More potent and selective furin inhibitors based on ''Eda'' may be developed by choosing more efficient furin recognition sequences based on its known substrates.",

The complete catalytic domain of furin (108-438) is defined as the sequence segment beginning at the mature N-terminus and ending at the residue equivalent to the C-terminus of thermitase [61] . The above binding may lead to a significant change in conformation and folding pattern of furin catalytic structure leading to its loss of protease activity. No other docking could be noticeable between the Eda-peptide (cyclic or acyclic form) and any domain of furin. Thus, it is more likely that Eda-peptide upon Bergman cyclization may be a more effective inhibitor of furin although such conclusion would require further studies with the two purified forms of furin-Eda peptide and NMR Spectra. Moreover, in order to further expand the present study and examine the efficacy of Eda-peptide approach as a general method for inhibitor design for any protease including furin, other peptide sequences need to be examined. Moreover further studies in future using additional cell lines and animal models will shed more light on the mechanism of furin inhibition by Eda-peptide.",

In brief, the synthesis was accomplished first by Pd (0)-mediated Sonogashira coupling of 1, 2-dibromo benzene with 4-pentynoic acid benzhydryl ester in presence of cuprous bromide in dry triethylamine under refluxing condition for 4 h in an inert atmosphere. After aqueous work up, the crude oily residue was purified by column chromatography using silica gel 60 (eluted with petroleum ether: Ethyl acetate = 30:1) to afford the eneyne ester [5-(2-Bromo-phenyl)-pent-4-ynoic acid benzhydryl ester]. A second round of Sonogashira coupling of eneyne ester with 3-butyne-1-ol and subsequent purification yielded the enediyne hydroxyl ester [5-[2-(4-Hydroxy-but-1-ynyl)-phenyl]pent-4-ynoicacid benzhydryl ester]. Thus enediyne hydroxyl ester obtained was converted to methyl toluene sulphonate or mesylate and was subsequently reacted with sodium azide in dry DMF to furnish the corresponding enediyne azido ester [5-[2-(4-Azido-but-1-ynyl)-phenyl]-pent-4-ynoic acid benzhydryl ester]. The azido functionality was then reduced to amine on treatment with triphenyl phosphine and H 2 O in THF. The amine [5-[2-(4-Amino-but-1-ynyl)-phenyl]-pent-4-ynoic acid benzhydryl ester] was protected with Fmoc by reaction with Fmoc-chloride under basic condition in methanol to afford Fmoc-NH-Eda-benzhydryl ester which was then subjected to deprotection by TFA/anisole in Figure 6 .
