            "text": "Background: Phylogenetic analysis is now an important tool in the study of viral outbreaks. It can reconstruct epidemic history when surveillance epidemiology data are sparse, and can indicate transmission linkages among infections that may not otherwise be evident. However, a remaining challenge is to develop an analytical framework that can test hypotheses about the effect of environmental variables on pathogen spatial spread. Recent phylogeographic approaches can reconstruct the history of virus dispersal from sampled viral genomes and infer the locations of ancestral infections. Such methods provide a unique source of spatio-temporal information, and are exploited here. Results: We present and apply a new statistical framework that combines genomic and geographic data to test the impact of environmental variables on the mode and tempo of pathogen dispersal during emerging epidemics. First, the spatial history of an emerging pathogen is estimated using standard phylogeographic methods. The inferred dispersal path for each phylogenetic lineage is then assigned a \"weight\" using environmental data (e.g. altitude, land cover). Next, tests measure the association between each environmental variable and lineage movement. A randomisation procedure is used to assess statistical confidence and we validate this approach using simulated data. We apply our new framework to a set of gene sequences from an epidemic of rabies virus in North American raccoons. We test the impact of six different environmental variables on this epidemic and demonstrate that elevation is associated with a slower rabies spread in a natural population. Conclusion: This study shows that it is possible to integrate genomic and environmental data in order to test hypotheses concerning the mode and tempo of virus dispersal during emerging epidemics.",

The application of evolutionary concepts to epidemiological surveillance and outbreak control has been transformed in recent years by the increasing availability of viral genome sequences, the growth in computer processing power, and the development of sophisticated analytical methods (e.g. [6] ). Information gleaned from genetic data has the potential to identify factors that influence the spread and evolution of viral diseases. An evolutionary approach to epidemiology provides several benefits when combined with traditional methods, as it allows reconstruction of epidemic transmission history from a small number of pathogens sampled shortly after the discovery of an outbreak, the estimation of migration histories, and the inference of transmission links among cases that may not be evident using data on spatio-temporal incidence alone.",

Specifically, phylogeographic and statistical studies of virus genomes sampled through space and time can answer questions relating to the geographic dissemination of epidemics e.g. [4, 10] and numerous methods are available to infer patterns of spatial spread from genetic data, e.g. [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] .

This method co-estimates both the virus phylogeny and the locations of unsampled common ancestors, thereby producing a full spatial dispersal history of the sampled infections. This history includes an estimate of the location of epidemic origin and of the velocity, direction and heterogeneity of spatial spread. The method has been used in several studies to reconstruct the spatial spread of pathogenic viruses, including crop diseases, dengue virus, West Nile virus and avian influenza viruses [16] [17] [18] . However, while this method can place phylogenies in a geographical context, it does not explicitly incorporate environmental differences across the geographic landscape within which transmission occurs. Such heterogeneity may have a significant effect on spatial dissemination, especially for outbreaks in natural animal and plant populations e.g. [19] [20] [21] .",

This is the \"phylogeographic GLM\" approach [22, 23] that estimates rates of lineage movement among a fixed number of discrete locations, and in doing so parameterises each among-location rate as a linear function of one or more predictor variables. The coefficients of the linear model are then co-estimated with the amonglocation rates, the phylogeny, and other parameters, using Bayesian Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) inference. However, this framework is only currently applicable to discretised spatial locations and is more suited to hypotheses concerning human mobility among population centres via transportation hubs, such as airports [23, 24] and is less suitable for hypotheses concerning the dissemination of animal and plant pathogens throughout natural landscapes. Further, it is computationally demanding because predictor variables are assessed whilst sampling phylogenies using a Bayesian MCMC algorithm. There is therefore a need for complementary approaches.",

This framework uses spatial information obtained from phylogeography to study the impact of environmental variables on epidemic dispersal in continuous space. Our method differs from previous approaches in that it explicitly separates the task of testing correlates of lineage dispersal from the task of inferring the history of movement from genetic data. This separation has two benefits. First, it allows large numbers of environmental variables to be assessed without the need for phylogenetic MCMC sampling. Second, it increases flexibility, because it can be applied to any dispersal history, irrespective of the specific phylogeographic method or software package that was used to infer that history. We illustrate our framework by applying it to a wellcharacterised viral outbreak, the spread of rabies in raccoons across the north-east of the USA over approximately thirty years (hereafter referred as the raccoon rabies epidemic). This data set has been analysed using previous phylogeographic methods [15, 25] , thus enabling direct comparison with the results obtained here.",

Such trees are generated by the continuous phylogeography method implemented in BEAST [15] , but it is important to note that our method is applicable phylogenies from any source that are annotated with dates and locations in the same way (Fig. 1a) . The velocity, distance and duration of spatial movement along each branch in each tree are extracted and represented by a vector. (ii) In a second, optional, step, the spatio-temporal data extracted in step (i) is used to calculate summary statistics of spatial spread, such as the velocity of the epidemic wavefront. (iii)Each of the vectors obtained in step (i) is assigned a \"weight\" score, which is calculated using a raster that defines the spatial heterogeneity of a specified environmental variable (e.g. elevation, human population density, land cover, etc.). We have implemented three different models of spatial movement (hereafter called \"path models\") to compute the \"weight\" allocated to each phylogeny branch for a given environmental raster. (a) The \"straight-line path\" model, which assumes that movement is in a straight-line between the start and end locations of each branch. (b) The \"least-cost path\" model, which uses a least-cost algorithm [26] to determine the route taken between the start and end points. (c) The \"random walk path\" model, which uses circuit theory [27] to accommodate uncertainty in the route taken. Note that for models (b) and (c), each environmental raster must be considered twice, once as a conductance factor (i.e. it facilitates movement) and once as a resistance factor (i.e. it impedes movement). (iv) The correlation between the duration of each phylogeny branch and its \"weight\" (see step iii) is then estimated. Correlations are repeated for each environmental raster, and for each of the three path models described above. (v) Finally, the statistical significance of these correlations is tested using a null model. To generate this null model, we implement a simple randomisation procedure: phylogenetic node positions are randomised within the study area, under the constraint that branch lengths, tree topology and root position are unchanged (see Fig. 1b ).",

At present, such trees are mostly likely to be generated using the phylogeographic models implemented in BEAST [15] , but our framework can be applied to phylogenies from any source that have been annotated in the same way. In order to extract the spatio-temporal information in the input trees, each phylogeny branch in each tree is summarised as a vector defined by its start and end location, and its start and end dates.

For example, if an environmental raster is treated as a resistance factor then raster cells with low values will be more permeable to dispersal and those with high values will correspond to poor dispersal habitat or to movement barriers [27] . When there is no prior information about whether a given variable will facilitate or impede lineage movement, it is prudent to consider it twice, once as a potential conductance factor, and once as a potential resistance factor. By default, we use the environmental values as resistance or conductance values. Log-transformed and/or standardised values may be necessary if the current univariate approach is in future extended to a multivariate one (see Conclusion). Note, when all cells in a raster are identically-valued (i.e. there is no spatial variation in the environmental factor) then the total \"weight\" for any path is simply proportional to its geographic distance. A special case exists when all cells have values equal to 1, which we here define as the \"null raster\".",

A separate regression is performed for each environmental factor of interest. The absolute strength of the regression can be measured using its coefficient of determination (R 2 ). Specifically, we use the statistic D = (R 2 env -R 2 null ), where R 2 env is the R 2 obtained when branch durations are regressed against weights defined by the environmental raster, and R 2 null is the R 2 obtained when branch durations are regressed against weights defined by the null raster (i.e. when only the spatial distance of each movement event is considered). All environmental raster cell values are increased by 1 (except for cells with no data) to enable a direct comparison of R 2 env and R 2 null . D is therefore a correlation measure relative to a null hypothesis and represents the degree to which the regression is strengthened when spatial variation in the environmental variable is taken into account.",

Furthermore, this randomisation procedure is not applied to the entire raster but to a subset of it defined by the minimum convex hull around a set of locations. The set of locations comprises the start and end positions of each branch in the spatiotemporallyreferenced input phylogenies. During the randomisation, if a randomised branch position falls outside the area defined by this convex hull, the algorithm randomises its position again until it does not fall outside this area. By constraining permutation within this convex hull we are, in effect, using the data to inform the relevant study area. In contrast, the square raster inputted by the user may be of arbitrary size and orientation. Without this constraint, randomised phylogenies will fall in areas with different environmental values, potentially leading to type I errors.",

These statistics include the epidemic wavefront and patristic distances through time (Figs. 3a and b) , and parameters that describe dispersal velocities and diffusion coefficients (Figs. 3c and d) . The epidemic wavefront plot (Fig. 3a) shows that the spatial extent of the raccoon rabies epidemic increased at a relatively constant rate until around 1990. The patristic distance (i.e. the distance summed along tree branches) at this time is greater (> 1,000 km) than the spatial distance (750-800 km). The difference between these two measures is to be expected, because the patristic distance includes movements in all directions, including those back towards the epidemic origin (Fig. 3b) . Hence dispersal was diffusive in nature and did not always follow the shortest or most direct path from epidemic origin to epidemic wavefront. Kernel density graphs of the mean lineage velocity (Fig. 3c) and phylogenetic diffusion coefficient (Fig. 3d ) indicate significant variation in these parameters among lineages. The estimated mean lineage velocity was~37 km/ year (Fig. 3c) , similar to that reported for dengue virus in Vietnam (6-38 km/year [17] ) but substantially smaller than that of the West Nile virus epidemic in North America (1,500 km/year [18] ). These statistics are helpful in quantifying the spatial dynamics of an epidemic and can also be used to compare different outbreaks. Some, but not all, of them are implemented in the software package SPREAD [31] . We hope that future work will lead to the development and implementation of further summary statistics. ",

            "text": "Next, we used our framework to measure and test the correlation of various environmental variables with the movement of rabies virus lineages (see Steps 3-5 in Methods). We explored rasters that represent six different environmental variables, specifically (i) cropland land cover, (ii) forest land cover, (iii) savanna land cover, (iv) elevation, (v) human population density and (vi) inaccessibility to major cities. For illustrative purposes, we first present the results based on only one tree (from the posterior phylogeny distribution estimated by BEAST). We later show how the framework can be extended to incorporate phylogenetic uncertainty, by analysing multiple input trees. The purpose of the analysis is to calculate a test statistic, D, for each environmental variable, E. The statistic D represents the degree to which the correlation between the duration and \"weight\" of each lineage is strengthened when spatial heterogeneity in E is taken into account (see in Methods for details). Formally, D = R 2 env -R 2 null , where R 2 env is the coefficient of determination obtained when branch durations are regressed against branch weights calculated using raster E, and R 2 null is the coefficient of determination obtained when branch durations are regressed against branch weights defined by a null raster with no spatial variation (i.e. a raster whose cells all have value 1). If D \u2264 0, then the environmental variable E does not explain variation in branch duration better than geographic distance alone. However, if D is strongly positive, then the values of E are strongly associated with branches that move more rapidly or more slowly than average. Figure 4 displays the linear regressions between branch durations and branch weights for a rabies virus phylogeny randomly chosen from the posterior tree distribution. Regressions are shown for \"weights\" calculated using the null raster (Fig. 4a) and for \"weights\" calculated using the elevation raster, when elevation is treated as a factor that impedes movement (Fig. 4b) . Results are shown for each of the three path models (straight-line, least-cost, and random walk models). In this example, there is comparatively little difference among path for the random walk model). Thus while geographic distance alone explains a small part of among-lineage variation in velocity (i.e. R 2 null ), this variation is better explained when the geographic elevation of the path taken by each lineage is taken into account (i.e. R 2 env ). Table 2 reports D values for other environmental variables when applied to the same single phylogeny as that used in Fig. 4 .",

This generates, for each combination of environmental variable and path model, a distribution of 100 D values. The randomisation procedure is then applied to each D value, precisely as outlined above. This results in 100 p-values for each raster/ path model combination. We therefore report the percentage of trees which give rise to p-values < 0.05 (Table 2) ; this can be interpreted as the posterior probability of observing a significant correlation between lineage movements and the environmental variable.

In Fig. 5a the distributions were calculated using the \"elevation\" raster (as a resistance factor) and in Fig. 5b they were calculated using the \"forests\" raster (as a conductance factor). In both cases the least-cost path model was used. In Fig. 5a , the empirical distribution is greater than the randomisation replicates, indicating that the environmental variable in question explains viral lineage movement, whereas in Fig. 5b there is no noticeable difference between the empirical and null D values. Table 2 can be grouped into three categories: (i) rasters that have little or no association with lineage movement (i.e. p < 0.05 for less than 5 % of trees), (ii) rasters for which there is weak evidence that they affect lineage movement (i.e. p < 0.05 for more than 5 % but less than 50 % of trees), and (iii) rasters for which there relatively stronger evidence that the environmental variable is associated with slower or faster movements (i.e. p < 0.05 for more than 50 % of trees). The \"forests\" and \"savannas\" rasters fall within the first category, whilst \"croplands\" (as a resistance factor) and \"human population density\" (as a conductance factor) belong to the second category. Only the \"elevation\" raster (as a resistance factor) clearly belongs to the third category. The importance of the \"inaccessibility\" raster (as a resistance factor) is less clear and is sensitive to the path model chosen. For both the \"elevation\" and \"inaccessibility\" rasters, the fraction of trees with p < 0.05 is smaller under the straight-line path model than under the other two path models. This may reflect the over-simplified nature of the straight-line model, which permits biologically unrealistic scenarios, such as paths that traverse large water bodies.",

Therefore for these two approaches the fraction of significant results should equal the critical value of the test.

Simulation approaches (iii) and (iv) generates data sets under the alternate hypothesis, i.e. branch duration is equal or influenced by the environmental raster. The null hypothesis was almost always rejected (at p < 0.05) when the test was applied to data generated using approaches (iii) or (iv), indicating that the test has reasonable statistical power in the context of this data set.

The raccoon rabies data set explored here was chosen for illustrative purposes and our results strongly support the notion that increasing elevation is associated with slower movements of this virus. This result is biologically plausible and the impact of elevation on the dissemination of raccoon rabies was previously addressed by Biek et al. [25] . Their analysis used spatial kriging to compute annual contours from the date of the first reported case of each county and the contours were coloured according to temporal periods identified by phylogenetic molecular clock analysis. Fig. 5 Empirical distributions of the D statistic (in grey), calculated from 100 trees sampled using Bayesian MCMC inference. These are compared with five replicates of the null distribution of D generated by the randomisation procedure (red lines). In (a) the distributions were calculated using the \"elevation\" raster (as a resistance factor) and in (b) they were calculated using the \"forests\" raster (as a conductance factor). In both cases the least-cost path model was used. For visual clarity, discrete histograms were converted into density curves using a Gaussian smoothing kernel They then visually compared the resulting contours overlaid on an elevation map, enabling them to posit that mountain ranges likely formed a barrier to raccoon movement. We intend to explore the application of our new method to other viral outbreaks in future work. We have implemented three path models in our analytical framework. Although the straight-line path model is perhaps overly simplistic, the appropriateness of one model over another will depend on the locomotive behaviour of the pathogen's host species (and of its insect vector, if it has one). In the case of the raccoon rabies epidemic, we had no prior assumption about which path model might be most appropriate and therefore we decided to test them all. In other instances, there may be good reasons to choose a priori one path model over another. For instance, one might chose the least-cost path model over random walk path model in some cases, for example viruses carried by migratory birds; i.e. the leastcost model may be more appropriate when host-species intentionally reach specific locations by avoiding nonsuitable landscape areas.",

            "text": "Currently, our analytical framework does not allow for the analysis of environmental variables, such as temperature or humidity, that vary notably over the course of the epidemic under investigation. The assumption of constant values is unlikely to be unrealistic for the environmental variables investigated here, although some variation has undoubtedly occurred in human population density. The extension of our approach to time-varying environments is theoretically feasible, but poses significant technical and practical problems, specifically (i) the acquisition of a series of environmental rasters that represents change in the variable concerned at a sufficiently precise temporal resolution, and (ii) generalisation of the least-cost and random-walk path models to three rather than two dimensions, with the third dimension corresponding to rasters that represent different points in time. A second improvement for future work would be to allow the co-analysis of several environmental factors in a multivariate framework. Such a framework would require correlation statistics, for example those based on a generalised linear model (GLM), as in [22] .",
