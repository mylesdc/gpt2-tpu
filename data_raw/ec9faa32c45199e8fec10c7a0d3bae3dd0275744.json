Common hospital-acquired infections like influenza require a discerning ability to distinguish between viral isolates to accurately identify patient transmission chains. We assessed whether influenza hemagglutinin sequence phylogenies can be used to enrich epidemiological data when investigating the extent of nosocomial transmission over a four-month period within a paediatric Hospital in Cape Town South Africa. Possible transmission chains/channels were initially determined through basic patient admission data combined with Maximum likelihood and time-scaled Bayesian phylogenetic analyses. These analyses suggested that most instances of potential hospital-acquired infections resulted from multiple introductions of Influenza A into the hospital, which included instances where virus hemagglutinin sequences were identical between different patients. Furthermore, a general inability to establish epidemiological transmission linkage of patients/viral isolates implied that identified isolates could have originated from asymptomatic hospital patients, visitors or hospital staff. In contrast, a traditional epidemiological investigation that used no viral phylogenetic analyses, based on patient co-admission into specific wards during a particular time-frame, suggested that multiple hospital acquired infection instances may have stemmed from a limited number of identifiable index viral isolates/patients.

The close proximity of patients, visitors and healthcare workers (HCWs) to one another, virus shedding during asymptomatic periods, low vaccination compliance (by both HCWs and the general public) as well as virus persistence in respiratory secretions and fomites can all contribute to the spread of the virus and lead to nosocomial outbreaks [2, [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . Limiting nosocomial transmissions in hospitals is particularly important as besides increasing the duration and costs of hospitalization, they can increase morbidity and mortality, particularly in high-risk elderly, infant, seriously ill, and immunocompromised patients [2, 3, 13] .",

Here we assess whether an influenza sequence phylogenetic analysis could, by enriching basic epidemiological data, assist with investigating transmission chains and the frequency of nosocomial transmission within Red Cross War Memorial Childrens Hospital (RXH) in Cape Town South Africa. Over a 4-month period, influenza A positive patient samples from various wards in the hospital were obtained and partial influenza hemagglutinin sequences were generated for each patient. Possible transmission chain/channels were determined through a combination of basic patient admission data and the analysis of Maximum likelihood and time-scaled Bayesian phylogenetic trees, to identify potentially epidemiologically linked transmission chains. The inclusion of a time-scaled phylogenetic analysis allowed us to estimate times to most recent common ancestors of epidemiologically and phylogenetically linked samples with statistical support to evaluate the likelihood of phylogenetically related infections sharing a common transmission source.",

RXH is the largest tertiary paediatric hospital in South Africa and manages approximately 260 000 patient visits per year. Most of its patients are from poor communities, a third of which are less than one year old. Although > 98% of patients are referred to the hospital from the Western Cape region of South Africa, referrals from the rest of South Africa are also common as a result of the unique and high level of paediatric care available at the hospital. For the period spanning 1 April to 31 July 2011, a total of eighteen samples were obtained. Fourteen were confirmed Influenza A, pandemic H1N1 (H1N1pdm) positive RNA samples from pediatric patients admitted to RXH, which formed the focus of our study. A further four samples, served as geographic controls and were obtained from three other hospitals within the same region during the same time period; 1 from Groote Schuur Hospital (GRS), 1 from 2-Military Hospital (2MIL) and 2 from Somerset Hospital (SOM). Clinical history and hospital admission dates were abstracted from hospital records of the RXH patients from whom virus samples were obtained. This study was approved by the University of Cape Town Human Research Ethics Committee (UCT research ethics number: 305/2012). To ensure patient anonymity, study samples were unlinked by being issued with a study identification number. For the purpose of this investigation the transmission case definitions were as follows: (1) a suspected hospitalacquired influenza infection (HAI) case was defined as an influenza PCR positive individual who did not present to the hospital with respiratory symptoms or was confirmed to be influenza negative by laboratory testing within three days of admission ( Fig 1) ; and (2) a suspected community-acquired infection (CAI) case was defined as a patient with laboratory-confirmed Influenza A (H1N1pdm) at or within three days of admission.",

Similar to the ML phylogenetic analysis, putative HAI transmission clusters were inferred if two or more sequences clustered with 0.95 or higher posterior probability support.

While it is also plausible that patients 1.1 a and 1.1 c acquired their infections either directly or indirectly from a hospital source, due to the brief time lapse between of their diagnoses/symptoms relative to when patient 1.1b was admitted it is questionable whether these patients acquired their viruses from patient 1.1 b.",

All patients whose viral isolates feature in cluster 3 (bootstrap supported) were admitted to RXH within a 43 day span of one another (19 May -1 July) and were confirmed to be H1N1pdm positive by laboratory testing within 25 days of one another. Viral isolates 3.1 and 3.2 are most likely to represent locally circulating CAIs as they tested positive for influenza A within 2 days of admission. Isolate 3.3, is the only sample to conform to our chosen criteria for a HAI in this cluster, testing H1N1pdm positive at 18 days post admission. The possibility does exist that patient 3.3 acquired their infection indirectly from patient 3.2 (the two patients were not housed in the same ward). The time-scaled phylogenetic analysis (Figs 1 and 3 ) may support this notion as it estimated that the virus isolates in patients 3.2 and 3.3, despite varying in sequence, may have shared a hospital ancestor between 18 April and 5 June (mean = 19 May) (Figs 1 and 3) , the upper limit of which coincides with the co-hospitalisation of patients 3.2 and 3.3. In spite of this, due to time constraints, it is still highly unlikely that viral transmission occurred between these patients as the time-frame is an insufficient incubation period for infection symptoms. As indicated, insufficient bootstrap ML support precluded the sequence derived from patient 3.4 from cluster 3. Time-scaled phylogenetic analysis further confirmed that it is highly unlikely that 3.3 and 3.4 shared a common hospital ancestor since the 95% credibility interval of the tMRCA excluded the admission dates of both patients.

This assumption of direct infection instance relatedness would be based on co-admission of patients to the same ward within a specific time-frame. This could incorrectly suggest transmission linkage between patients that were infected with viruses with MRCAs that excluded all possibility of a direct intra-hospital transmission chains. Incorrectly assuming transmission linkages between such patients, would lead to an underestimation of the number of times that influenza had been independently introduced into the hospital. While our sequence data suggests that there were at least four and potentially as many as ten independent H1N1pdm introductions into RXH between 26 March 2011 and 15 June 2011 due to no identifiable linkage between the HAI instances. The value of sequence data is thus highlighted by our ability to test the plausibility of assumed transmission pathways and attempt to more accurately enumerate the number of possible HAI and CAI transmission events.",

Furthermore, temporally-scaled phylogenetic analysis suggested that most instances of potential HAI in RXH-including instances where virus HA sequences were identical between different cases-likely resulted from independent introductions of Influenza A viruses into the hospital. Our inability to establish epidemiological transmission linkage of cases/viral isolates could be attributed to limited sampling in RXH during the study period which could imply that the viruses we detected originated in either asymptomatic hospital patients, visitors, or hospital staff. Transmission from asymptomatic patients is serious in the context of South Africa's high HIV prevalence. While studies have demonstrated that HIV-infection status alone in adults does not increase risk of Influenza infection, evidence suggests that prolonged Influenza shedding periods (> 1 week) can be observed in patients exhibiting non-HIV related immunosuppression [62, 63] . Such prolonged influenza positivity was exhibited in patient 1.1 Phylogeny as a Utility to Observe Influenza Nosocomial Transmission a, who remained influenza PCR positive for 15 days. In-spite of this, none of the RXH patients were HIV positive during the course of this study and thus could not account for prolonged ILI and possible influenza shedding in patient 1.1 a.",

The genetic distance between the 2011 Southern hemisphere H1N1 vaccine strain (A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)-like virus) and virus isolates derived from our patients (all of which were influenza A(H1N1) pdm09 positive) showed a mean similarity genetic distance of 0.975 (range 0.966-0.985) for the HA region analysed. It is also noted that the vast majority of influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 viruses characterized by the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System during the flu season in question were antigenically related to the above-mentioned influenza A(H1N1)pdm09-like virus included in the 2011 Southern hemisphere vaccine [61] .",

In a bid to increase flu vaccination compliance some health-care institutions have provided HCWs with a voluntary, free immunization program [13, 64] . In these instances, increased rates of HCW vaccination in health care facilities has been associated with a significant reduction in the rate of nosocomial influenza infections amongst patients and staff [13, 56, [64] [65] [66] .",

The epidemiological observations excluded five of the 14 RXH patients of which two were potential HAIs. Patients 1.1 c and 2.1 b developed infection symptoms within the RXH ICU at nine and 17 days post hospital admission, respectively. Influenza PCR-based testing was unable to determine whether they acquired the infection within this ward. However, access to this information would not have aided our ability to establish virus transmission linkage. Furthermore, the identification of HAI sources may ultimately require exhaustive longitudinal sampling and screening of hospital staff, visitors and patients, including review of patient records and collection of other epidemiological data on questionnaires throughout the duration of a single influenza season. Such a large-scale study would also likely benefit from analyses of larger sequence fragments (possibly even multiple full genome sequences from individual patients at each sampling time-point), which would provide greater analytical power with respect to resolving clusters within phylogenetic trees for the identification and characterization of likely virus transmission chains within the hospital setting.
