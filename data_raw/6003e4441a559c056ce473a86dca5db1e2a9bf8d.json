Liquid chromatographytandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was successfully used to identify the viruses as the segmented dsRNA orthoreovirus. Phylogenetic analysis of the Lopburi orthoreovirus whole-genomes revealed relationships with the well-characterised PRVs Pulau (segment L1), Cangyuan (segments L2, M3 and S3), Melaka (segments L3 and M2), Kampar (segments M1 and S2) and Sikamat (segments S1 and S4) of Southeast Asia and China with nucleotide sequence identities of 93.5-98.9%. RT-PCR showed that PRV was detected in 10.9% (6/55) and HEV was detected in 25.5% (14/55) of the monkey faecal samples. Conclusions: PRV was isolated from monkey faeces for the first time in Thailand via viral culture and LC-MS/MS. The genetic diversity of the virus genome segments suggested a re-assortment within the PRV species group. The overall findings emphasise that monkey faeces can be sources of zoonotic viruses, including PRV and HEV, and suggest the need for active virus surveillance in areas of human and monkey co-habitation to prevent and control emerging zoonotic diseases in the future.",

Reoviridae is a large family of non-enveloped, icosahedral, segmented dsRNA viruses that infect a wide range of hosts, i.e. fungi, plants, insects, molluscs, fish, reptiles, birds and mammals, including humans [3] . Orthoreovirus, which contains 10 genome segments (three large, three medium and four small segments), consists of five species: mammalian orthoreovirus (MRV), avian orthoreovirus (ARV), PRV [formerly known as Nelson Bay orthoreovirus (NBV)], baboon orthoreovirus and reptilian orthoreovirus [4, 5] . Of these, MRV is the only species that does not exert a syncytial cytopathic effect (CPE) in cell culture; therefore, it is called a non-fusogenic orthoreovirus. MRV is the prototypic orthoreovirus that causes diseases in mammals, including humans and monkeys [3] . The first isolation of PRV occurred in 1970 from a grey-headed flying fox (Pteropus poliocephalus) in Nelson Bay, Australia [6] . Its characteristics are intermediate between MRV and ARV, in which it is a fusogenic orthoreovirus that infects mammals but does not kill chicken embryos [3] . It is therefore called a mammalian fusogenic orthoreovirus. Later, other PRVs were isolated from bats and humans. Pulau virus, the second member of the NBV species group, was isolated in 1999 from pooled urine samples of the fruit bat Pteropus hypomelanus in Tioman Island, Malaysia [7] . Bat-associated Melaka and Kampar orthoreoviruses with genome sequences related to NBV were isolated in 2006 in Malaysia from patients with acute respiratory disease. The reports of these two viruses suggested the ability of PRV to cause disease in humans and evidenced its human-to-human transmission potential [8, 9] . Subsequently, new strains of PRV were consecutively isolated from humans and bats, including patients with respiratory tract infection from Hong Kong [10, 11] , Japan [12] and Malaysia [5] and bats from China [13, 14] , Italy [15] and, most recently, the Philippines [16] . It must be noted that the infected patients from Hong Kong and Japan had histories of travel to Indonesia, and the PRV-positive bats in Italy were also imported from Indonesia. Thus far, excluding NBV, which originated from Australia, PRV has only been isolated in Southeast Asia (Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines) and China.",

Mass spectrometry (MS), peptide mass fingerprinting and protein profiling via time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOF MS) have been applied in studies of both human and plant viruses such as poliovirus, rhinovirus, tobacco mosaic virus and brome mosaic virus [17] [18] [19] . However, the use of peptide mass fingerprinting to identify unknown viruses is restricted by limitations of viral peptide mass fingerprint databases and the capability of TOF MS to identify small amounts of viral peptides when disturbed by mammalian proteins from cell culture. To overcome these limitations, protein separation techniques such as gel electrophoresis and liquid chromatography (LC) in combination with MS are applied. MS, in particular tandem MS (MS/MS), is a sensitive method for analysing protein mixtures [20] . Two-dimensional (2D) electrophoresis in combination with high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) was used to identify an uncharacterised virus in an experimentally infected tobacco plant protein extract [21] .",

HEV is a food-and water-borne, non-enveloped, positive-sense RNA virus of the Hepeviridae family. The virus causes diseases ranging from acute self-limiting illnesses to fulminant hepatitis in humans [22] . In Thailand, sporadic cases of HEV infection have been reported. Nationwide HEV sero-surveillance revealed an HEV seroprevalence rate of 3-26% in Thai provinces [23] . Focussing on Lopburi Province, 37% of people in a surveyed population were anti-HEV IgG positive, with positivity associated with pork consumption and the presence of swine farms in the area [24] . HEV is the only hepatitis virus that exhibits a zoonotic potential, with pigs as a primary reservoir [22] . In addition, HEV has been detected in wild boars, wild deer, mongooses, rabbits, rats and goats in various countries in Asia and Europe [22, 25, 26] . Non-human primates (NHPs) have been demonstrated to be experimentally infected by HEV and to secrete the virus. Although it has been suggested that monkeys serve as an asymptomatic reservoir of HEV [27] , the prevalence of HEV in wild monkeys in Thailand has not yet been elucidated.",

Published nucleotide sequences that exhibited the highest percent identities to sequences of the isolated virus are presented in Table 4 . The identities with the reference sequences were 93.5-98.9% in all 10 segments. Re-assortments within the species group were observed in the Lopburi orthoreovirus genome. Segment L1 of the Lopburi virus is most identical to that of the bat-origin Pulau Considering the nucleotide and protein sequence identities among the PRV sequences subjected to analysis, Table 5 presents the percent identities for each genome segment. The most conserved genome segment was S2 encoding a major inner capsid protein (96.3-100% amino acid identity). The most variable genome segment was S1, which contains three coding regions, p10 (membrane fusion protein), p17 and sigma C (cell attachment protein). The nucleotide sequence identities for these regions were 65.9-100%, 54.7-100% and 47.6-100%, respectively, and the amino acid sequence identities were 69.4-100%, 44.5-100% and 36.4-100%, respectively.

Despite efforts to avoid close contact with animals, the potential for contact with animal faeces excreted into the environment remains. Four species of macaques reside in Lopburi Province, long-tailed or cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis), rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta), pig-tailed macaques (Macaca nemestrina) and stump-tailed macaques (Macaca arctoides), with long-tailed macaques being a major species. In this study, two unknown viruses were isolated from monkey faeces. The isolates demonstrated a syncytial CPE on A549 and Vero cells. Primers specific for viruses possibly found in monkey fluids and faeces such as herpesviruses and enteric viruses, including enterovirus, norovirus, rotavirus, enteric adenovirus and astrovirus, were used in PCR and RT-PCR for the isolated viruses, but negative results were obtained. Subsequently, mass spectrometry was applied, and the viruses were successfully identified as PRVs named Lopburi01 and Lopburi02. Previously, 2D gel electrophoresis for protein separation and HPLC-MS/MS was used to identify an unknown virus from a plant extract [21] . In this study, we demonstrated that a simple SDS-PAGE for protein size separation followed by LC-MS/MS of trypsin-digested peptides and protein database searching can also be used to identify unknown culturable viruses. Furthermore, on performing RT-PCR for all monkey samples available, PRV was detected in 10.9% (6 of 55) of the faecal samples collected from different sites in the Mueng District of Lopburi Province. The analysis of the mitochondrial 12S rRNA gene in the monkey stool DNA confirmed that the host species from which the Lopburi orthoreoviruses were isolated was M. fascicularis.",

Phylogenetic analysis of the isolates indicated that Lopburi01 and Lopburi02 are the same virus with sequence identities of \u226599.7% in all genome segments. Of the 10 segments of orthoreovirus genomes, all but S1 contain one ORF encoding a structural or non-structural protein. S1 is polycistronic, as it can encode 1-3 proteins depending on the orthoreovirus species [3] . S1 of PRV is tricistronic with three overlapping ORFs, and it encodes p10 (membrane fusion protein), p17 and sigma C (cell attachment protein). Among these segments, S1 exhibits the greatest variability [14, 16] . In our analysis, the nucleotide and amino acid sequence identities were 47.6% and 36.4%, respectively. Furthermore, considering differences in the topology patterns of the phylogenetic trees, it can be suggested that genetic re-assortment occurred among orthoreovirus species. The Lopburi orthoreoviruses contain genome sequences related to those of the Pulau (L1), Kampar (M1 and S2), Melaka (L3 and M2) and Sikamat (S1 and S4) viruses of Malaysia and the Cangyuan virus (L2, M3 and S3) of South China with sequence identities of 93.5-98.9%. It can be speculated that a geographical hindrance may have played a role in the re-assortment, as the orthoreovirus from Thailand is more similar to viruses from Malaysia and China than to those from the Philippines (Samal and Talikud viruses), which is separated from Thailand by the Pacific Ocean.",

These findings emphasise that PRV is a bat-borne zoonotic virus that has high potential to cause cross-species infection in humans.",

Thailand is home to 139 different bat species, including fruit bats and flying foxes of the genera Pteropus, Rousettus and Eonycteris [30, 31] , from which PRVs were isolated [6, 7, [13] [14] [15] [16] . Fruit bats visit human areas to feed on fruit trees; in this case, the areas occupied by humans, monkeys and bats may overlap. In addition to PRV, the bats were infected with other [30, 31] . Therefore, even if the detection of PRV in monkey faeces was due to contamination by bat excreta, the possibility of monkey faeces as an indirect source of zoonotic diseases cannot be eliminated. However, by analysis of the mitochondrial 12S rRNA gene, bat DNA was not detected in the faecal samples in this study, thus ruling out the contamination of the monkey samples with bat faeces.",

It was reported that NHPs such as macaques and chimpanzees can be experimentally infected by four serotypes of HEV, serotypes 1 and 2 found in humans and serotypes 3 and 4 found in humans and swine [32, 33] . A productive infection with seroconversion and viral shedding in faeces was demonstrated in cynomolgus macaques without clinical symptoms, indicating that the infected NHPs can serve as asymptomatic carriers of HEV [27] . In total, 25% of the faecal samples collected in this study were HEV RNA-positive, suggesting that monkeys in the wild could be reservoirs for HEV. Unfortunately, the HEV genotypes could not be identified because the short RT-PCR product (85 bp) was not suitable for genotype analysis. However, the detection of HEV RNA with a high detection rate in monkey faeces, even higher than that reported in pigs, the primary reservoir [34] [35] [36] , can be used as a preliminary information that warrants a further investigation to conclude that monkey faeces are a source of HEV.",

The reaction condition was 95\u00b0C for 2 min followed by 30 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 30 s, 50\u00b0C for 30 s and 72\u00b0C for 30 s and a final extension at 72\u00b0C for 10 min. The RT-PCR and semi-nested PCR product sizes were 661 and 276 bp, respectively. PCR products were resolved by gel electrophoresis in 1.5% agarose gels and observed under a UV transilluminator.",

Similar data were obtained for the Lopburi01 isolate. b A549 and Vero cells were infected with the Lopburi01 and Lopburi02 viruses at MOI of 0.5 for 24 h. Viral growth curves were obtained by titration of the virus culture supernatants collected at 0, 6, 12, and 24 h. The result is a representative of 2 independent experiments orthoreovirus of Malaysia. Segments L2, M3 and S3 are closely related to those of the bat-origin Cangyuan orthoreovirus of China. Segments L3 and M2 are related to those of the human-origin Melaka orthoreovirus of Malaysia. Segments M1 and S2 are closely related to those of the human-origin Kampar orthoreovirus of Malaysia. Segments S1 and S4 are closely related to those of the human-origin Sikamat orthoreovirus of Malaysia.Phylogenetic trees constructed using the maximum likelihood method are shown inFig. 6 (L1, L2 and L3),Fig. 7 (M1, M2 and M3) andFig. 8 (S1, S2, S3 and S4). The completed nucleotide sequences of the Lopburi01 and Lopburi02 viruses were compared with those of other PRV retrieved from the public database. Phylogenetic tree analysis demonstrated that the Lopburi orthoreoviruses are closely related to the Cangyuan, Melaka, Kampar and Sikamat orthoreoviruses that were identified in 2006-2012 in China and Malaysia. The newly identified Lopburi viruses most strongly resemble the Cangyuan virus with five segments (L1, L2, M3, S3 and S4) clustered together.
