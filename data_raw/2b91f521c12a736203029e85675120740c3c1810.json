            "text": "In terms of its highly pathogenic nature, there remains a significant need to further define the immune pathology of SARScoronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection, as well as identify correlates of immunity to help develop vaccines for severe coronaviral infections. Here we use a SARS-CoV infection-reinfection ferret model and a functional genomics approach to gain insight into SARS immunopathogenesis and to identify correlates of immune protection during SARS-CoV-challenge in ferrets previously infected with SARS-CoV or immunized with a SARS virus vaccine. We identified gene expression signatures in the lungs of ferrets associated with primary immune responses to SARS-CoV infection and in ferrets that received an identical second inoculum. Acute SARS-CoV infection prompted coordinated innate immune responses that were dominated by antiviral IFN response gene (IRG) expression. Reinfected ferrets, however, lacked the integrated expression of IRGs that was prevalent during acute infection. The expression of specific IRGs was also absent upon challenge in ferrets immunized with an inactivated, Al(OH) 3 -adjuvanted whole virus SARS vaccine candidate that protected them against SARS-CoV infection in the lungs. Lack of IFN-mediated immune enhancement in infected ferrets that were previously inoculated with, or vaccinated against, SARS-CoV revealed 9 IRG correlates of protective immunity. This data provides insight into the molecular pathogenesis of SARS-CoV and SARS-like-CoV infections and is an important resource for the development of CoV antiviral therapeutics and vaccines.

            "text": "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) disease hit the world in late 2002 and in 4 months swiftly spread to 29 countries infecting over 8,000 people and killing over 700 [1] . The etiological agent of SARS disease was determined to be of the coronavirus (CoV) family; the largest family of single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genomes known [1] . The overall mortality rate of SARS corona virus (SARS-CoV) infection was ,10% but this rate was 50% in patients over 65. Prior to the emergence of the SARS virus, coronaviruses were known to cause mild upperrespiratory tract diseases in humans. In contrast, SARS-CoV infection caused severe disease in the lower respiratory tract disease with symptoms ranging from flu-like and viral pneumonia to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and fatal outcome [2] [3] [4] [5] . The virus emerged from the Guangdong Province in China where it crossed to humans from a zoonotic reservoir. The most established theory puts horseshoe bats as the ultimate reservoir for the SARS-CoV and implicates palm civets as the intermediate species that passed the virus to humans [1] . Aggressive public health intervention strategies are credited with successfully minimizing the SARS-CoV infection range, although it is uncertain if these same public health strategies would sufficiently contain a future SARS-CoV or SARS-like-CoV outbreak due to virus evolution. Importantly, coronaviruses have a propensity toward frequent host-shifting events and over the past 30 years there have been many CoV cross-species transmission incidents giving rise to new animal and human CoV -based diseases. Coronaviruses infect a broad range of species lending further chance for recombination events and the advent of new CoV species. Moreover, coronaviruses can change cell type, tissue and host species barriers with ease [6, 7] . Typically, the spike (S) protein of coronaviruses determines the host infectivity and the organization of the SARS-CoV S protein shows significant similarity with other aggressive class I viral fusion proteins: influenza virus HA, HIV-1 Env, Simian virus 5, and Ebola virus Gp2 [1] . The promiscuity of coronaviruses coupled with the tendency for mutations to occur gives reason for concern that another CoV outbreak is likely and highlights the need for continuous viral surveillance and forward development of CoV vaccination strategies and therapeutics.",

            "text": "Although entry of SARS-CoV into mammalian cells has been determined to be facilitated by the angiotensin-1 converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) molecule [8] , the mechanisms by which the virus evades host immune responses causing generalized inflammation, increasing viral burden, and severe lung pathology still remain a significant scientific problem. Previous studies have shown substantial problems with potential CoV vaccines where the vaccines cause disease exacerbation opposed to initiating immunological protection [9, 10] . Recently, several groups have described the immunologic response during SARS-CoV infection [11] and some have investigated the use of a mouse adapted SARS-CoV in the mouse model [12] [13] [14] [15] . The mouse-adapted SARS-CoV (MA15) is a valuable animal model for investigating the immune response and possible therapeutic and prophylactic strategies for SARS-CoV disease. Although the model helped to elucidate immune-pathological events during SARS-CoV infection and protection [12] [13] [14] [15] , the caveat of this model is that it is based on an adapted virus and not a wild-type SARS-CoV that has naturally occurred in nature and cause disease in humans and animals. Although death is not observed in our wt TOR2 SARS-CoV ferret model, there are still several advantages where the use of both models is perhaps of equal importance as results from the mouse model compliment findings from the ferret model and vice versa. Specifically, use of the ferret model provides several benefits. As mentioned above, ferrets are susceptible to wild-type SARS-CoV infection from strains isolated from humans [16, 17] . Furthermore, when infected with respiratory viruses including the SARS-CoV ferrets display many of the symptoms and pathological features as seen in infected humans as ferrets and humans have similar lung physiology [18] [19] [20] [21] . Quantitative clinical signs displayed by ferrets include a rise in core body temperature (fever), nasal discharge (sneezing and runny nose) and weight loss [16] .",

Neutralizing antibody titers fell slightly to 720U on Day 30 (day of reinfection). Increases in neutralizing antibodies directly correlated with decreased viral burden in the lung (Figure 2 ). At four weeks post-infection, animals in group C were reinfected with SARS-CoV and a second spike in neutralizing antibodies (1300U) above levels seen during the infection phase was observed within a week. Neutralizing antibody titers remained elevated for approximately two weeks, then diminished to 400U by the end of the study (day 58). The boost in antibody titer may have contributed to the lower viral burden observed during the reinfection phase (Days 32 to 58). This second peak in neutralizing antibody titres was coincident with restricted viral replication ( Figure 2 ). Neutralizing antibodies were not detected in the mock-infection control group. The TOR2 strain of SARS-CoV replicated well in the upper respiratory tract (data not shown) and lung within the first week post-infection. Significant viral titers above background were detected in lung, ranging from one to three log above background. Peak viral titers were observed between 3 to 6 DPI in the lung ( Figure 2 ). Viral titers post reinfection (Days 30 to 58) were generally restricted below 2 log values ( Figure 2 ). Furthermore we investigated the lung histopathology following SARS-CoV infection and following SARS-CoV infection-reinfection ( Figure 3 ). Ferret lung sections were obtained from multiple lung lobes at 7 d post primary infection or 7 d post secondary infection and stained by hematoxylin and eosin. Primary SARS-CoV infection produced inflammation and the appearance of lung immune cells primarily surrounding small-to-medium bronchial airways at 7 days following challenge (Figure 3 B) . Ferrets that received infection-reinfection were largely protected from lung histopathology (Figure 3 C) . Taken together the ferret mounted an effective immune response to the reinfection with SARS-CoV, with increased neutralizing antibody titre, restricted virus replication, diminished clinical symptoms and less lung pathology in comparison to the initial infection of the naive host.",

Three ferrets at each time point were profiled and gene expression signatures associated with pulmonary immunopathology during SARS were identified using an Extraction and Analysis of Differential Gene Expression (EDGE) differential time course microarray analysis [25] on the SARS-CoV infected ferret lung samples. A heat map overview containing 3454 genes identified as significantly differentially expressed across all time points and classified by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) into three clusters of functionally related genes ( Figure 4) ; an IL-6/complement, an IRG, and an adaptive immune gene cluster. The two innate immune gene clusters, IL-6 signaling/complement and IRG cluster, were strongly expressed in ferret lung tissue from 2-14 DPI with SARS-CoV relative to the mock primary infection group. Conversely, an adaptive immune response gene cluster enriched with genes involved in antigen processing and presentation was highly expressed in the lungs of SARS-CoV infected ferrets after 14 DPI. SARS-CoV titres increased in the lungs prior to the initial peak in neutralizing antibody titers at 14 DPI and then bordered on the limit of detection ( Figure 2 ). Upon reinfection with SARS-CoV, the ferrets at 29 DPI did not increase gene expression despite an anamnestic response in neutralizing antibodies at 3 DPR ( Figure 1) . We analyzed the three clusters of functionally related innate immune genes in more detail below.",

            "text": "Our above analysis of the gene expression profiles during SARS-CoV infection and reinfection showed a decrease in IRG expression during SARS-CoV-reinfection compared to primary infection. We next went on to further analyse the expression profiles of SARS infection compared to reinfection using the DAVID bioinformatic tool [26] was used to perform functional classification in differentially expressed genes. During SARS-CoV primary ferret infection, a robust increase in the number of up-and down-regulated genes on day 2 after infection occurred. By day 5 the differential gene expression had decreased markedly although it is still moderate levels and on day 7, the gene expression was found to be close to baseline. During reinfection, a moderate increase in gene expression occurred which was maintained for a longer period of time ( Table 1) . Next, we analyzed the pathway activation profiles on 2 DPI compared to 2 DPR, which corresponded to peak immune activity during both infections ( Table 2) . On 2 DPI, the gene expression patterns showed strong activation of inflammationrelated genes, activation of MAPK, JAK-STAT and Wnt signaling pathways ( Table 2) . Together, these pathways participate in leukocyte activation and migration to infection sites. Interestingly, among the upregulated genes on 2DPR, lysosomal degradation was the only among the KEGG pathways to be significantly enriched (Fisher's exact test's p = 1.6E28); this scenario is suggestive of the presence of relevant phagocytosismediated immunity but without triggering a significant inflammatory response. Taken together, these results suggest that there are differential gene expression profiles corresponding to SARS infection compared to reinfection that may reflect protective host immune responses. Neutralizing antibody levels in serum were determined as outlined in the materials and methods section. Inverse neutralization titre is represented on the y-axis vs. day of study on the x-axis. Note that ferrets were infected on study day 1 and reinfected ferrets were also innoculated on study day 30. Mock infected animals received an intranasal instillation of serum-free media on study day 1 and had undetectable titres. Values shown represent group mean of 3-4 ferrets per group, and error bars show standard deviation. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0045842.g001",

Of the 3717 significantly altered genes resulting from this combined time course analysis, 42 were identified as IRGs by IPA ( Figure 6A ), many of which had also been identified in the infection-reinfection experiment ( Table 3) . When we applied a two-fold mean difference biological filter between the three groups at each time point, however, it was found that 8 of the 42 IRGs were downregulated at least two-fold at 2 or 7 DPC in ferrets previously immunized with SARS FCP-A relative to the mockvaccinated group ( Figure 6B ). These 8 IRGs, included: ISG15 (QRT-PCR shown in Figure S1 ), CCL2, IFI44, and PSMB8 discussed above; GPX1 (an antioxidant enzyme), and PSME1 and 2 (roles in MHC class I antigen processing, see Table 3 for full gene names); and myxovirus resistance 1 (MX1, a potent antiviral). Interestingly, the temporal expression patterns of 4 IRGs (ISG15, IFI44, PSME2 and CCL2) were similar amongst the SARS-CoV infection-reinfection experiments (50 IRGs) and this list of 8 IRGs from the adjuvanted vaccine-challenge experiments ( Figure 6C) .

Furthermore, due to the evolutionary and promiscuous nature of the SARS-CoV and other coronaviruses there is a current need to develop vaccination and therapeutic strategies for humans and mammals. Our time course analysis of differential gene expression in the lungs of SARS-CoV infected and SARS-CoV reinfected ferrets identified three key clusters of functionally related genes. Early (2-14 DPI) expression of IL-6 signaling/ complement and IFN response genes followed immediately (14 DPI) by antigen processing and presentation gene expression correlated with peak SARS-CoV titres in the lungs and peak neutralizing antibody titers, respectively. Reinfecting the ferrets with SARS-CoV did not reinitiate the same organized expression of antiviral innate immune response genes; however adaptive immunity in the form of SARS-specific antibody production quickly appeared at 3 DPR. These correlations suggested that a period of IFN-driven innate antiviral responses mediates acute SARS-CoV infection, after which specific adaptive immune responses confer protection. These findings are specifically imperative to the understanding of SARS-CoV and SARS-like-CoV infections and provide a comprehensive baseline for the development of CoV antiviral therapeutics and vaccines tailored to account for the specific IFN responses and subsequent antibody production.",

            "text": "A protective role for complement in SARS-CoV pathogenesis has been proposed [31] ; however, the extent to which complement is involved in SARS-CoV infection is unknown. In this study we found that certain complement system genes were significantly upregulated during the first 2 weeks post infection. CFB is key to the alternative complement cascade and is cleaved into Ba and Bb (UNIPROT). The Bb serine protease combines with C3b to generate the C3 convertase. C1q is the first target recognition protein of the classical complement cascade and is an important link between innate and adaptive immunity [32] . C1 complex activity is regulated by C1NH which forms a complex with C1r, C1s, and MASP proteases. We have previously shown that C1NH is upregulated in SARS-CoV infected patients prior to either recovery or progression to severe disease [33] . C4 is cleaved by activated C1 to produce C4b, an essential component of the C3 and C5 convertases of the classical pathway (UNIPROT). FCN1 initiates the lectin complement cascade via MASP zymogens, e.g. MASP1, which in turn cleave C4 [34] . Interestingly, the complement signaling regulators, C1NH and CR1, were also upregulated at 2 DPI. IL-6 has been shown to be induced in human bronchial epithelial cells following SARS-CoV infection in vitro and in vivo as well as associated with hyper-immune activation during SARS-CoV infection [14, 35, 36] . We found that the expression of IL-6 and IL-6 signaling-associated genes were increased in ferret lungs for a longer period of time than complement genes (2 DPI to 7 DPI). IL-6-regulated genes are mainly induced by IL-6/IL6 receptor signaling via JAK2:STAT3 and the RAS/ MAP/NF-IL6 pathway [37] . IL-6 gene expression is also partially dependent on NF-kB which is activated by NFKBIA (I-kBa) degradation [38] . Since IL-6 signaling can drive further IL-6 expression via the RAS/MAP kinase cascade and NF-IL6 activation [37] our results suggest that potentially self-sustaining acute phase responses occur during early SARS-CoV infection and not after reinfection.",

CCL2 protein expression has been associated with early inflammatory host responses during murine SARS-CoV infection [47] . We previously demonstrated that high levels of CXCL10 protein were present in plasma from SARS-CoV infected patients during early illness and quickly returned to baseline levels in those patients that quickly recovered [33, 48] . In severe cases of SARS-CoV infection, however, CXCL10 levels remained significantly elevated for the duration of the patient's infection. Interestingly, ISG15 was the only known IRG that was significantly increased following reinfection. ISG15 is an antiviral ubiquitin-like modifier that conjugates with JAK1 and STAT1 after type I IFN stimulation [49] . Also, antiviral ISG15 derivatives have been shown to be preferred substrates for the deubiquitinating activity of the SARS-CoV papain-like protease [50] . ISG15 is expressed by a wide variety of lymphoid cells and tissues. ISG15 and its targets may therefore represent unique innate immunity correlates that are not influenced by tissue viral loads, but that may participate in the IFN-mediated transition from innate to adaptive immunity.",

Although, it is important to mention the lack of upregulation following second infection may be due to the low virus replication levels after secondary infection. The presence of a low immune stimulation in the reinfection group is probably associated with the marginal viral replication. Also, the analysis of the gene expression profiles is suggestive of a scenario with very limited immune stimulation and without prominent participation of suppressor genes.",

Our microarray analysis on SARS-CoV challenged ferret lungs with or without previous immunization using an Al(OH) 3 -adjuvanted, inactivated whole virus SARS-CoV vaccine candidate revealed the downregulation of 8 IRGs. Moreover, four IRGs (ISG15, IFI44, PSME2 and CCL2) were expressed in common between the SARS-CoV infection-reinfection experiments and these 8 IRGs. The select abrogated expression of IRGs in SARS FCP-A vaccinated, SARS-CoV challenged ferrets reflect the infection-reinfection results demonstrating lack of IRG induction upon reinfection. The expression of these genes early in the natural course of infection suggested IRGs to be indicative of an early stage in SARS-CoV disease, but neither reinfection nor SARS vaccination-challenge provided evidence for IRGs as biomarkers of immune responses that are capable of suppressing SARS-CoV challenge. Importantly, the focus of this study was on the gene expression and protein analysis would be a valuable addition to future experiments. Furthermore, when we measured SARS-CoV viral RNA levels in SARS-CoV challenged mock-, SARS FCP-, and SARS FCP-A-vaccinated ferrets lungs by PCR, all mock-vaccinated ferrets were PCR-positive for SARS-CoV at 7 DPI, one SARS FCP-vaccinated ferret was positive at each of 2 and 7 DPI, and no SARS FCP-A-vaccinated ferrets were PCRpositive for SARS-CoV at any time.",

More recently, formalin-inactivated whole-virus [24] and adenovirus-based [22, 23] SARS-CoV vaccine candidates have shown promise in reducing pneumonia during SARS-CoV challenge in ferrets. Interestingly, immune enhancement was not seen in mice vaccinated with Al(OH)3-adjuvanted or non- Table 3 . Expression of selected significantly changed genes over time in SARS-CoV infected-reinfected ferret lungs. adjuvanted inactivated SARS-CoV whole virus candidate vaccines [30] . Furthermore, vaccine strategies for coronaviruses in an aged mouse model have also been investigated and found that wild type VRP (Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus replicon particle) vaccines protected animals from challenge [15] . Here, IFNmediated immune enhancement was not noted in our ferret SARS-CoV infection-reinfection model and we have previously reported that increased neutralizing antibody titers after SARS-CoV reinfection is a correlate of immune protection [51] . One caveat, due to the large nature of our study, was the absence of an Alum control only group and it would be important in the future to investigate the genes regulated by Alum treatment alone. Taken together, this study has given insight into the molecular events following SARS-CoV infection as well as identified an imperative signature for immunological protection against SARS-CoV in both a reinfection and vaccination model. Specifically, the ferret model of SARS-CoV infection showed a two step temporal paradigm of host immune responses in the lung. SARS-CoV infection in the ferrets was characterized by an early innate immune response (robust IFN and chemokine gene expression) followed by adaptive immunity likely eliciting localized anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and protective immune responses. Likewise, the lack of repeat robust innate immune responses in ferrets when reinfected with SARS-CoV suggested that the postreinfection gene signatures may reveal immune correlates related to successful immunization that may be applied to future use of the ferret model of SARS infection in vaccination strategies. Thus, the identified IRGs have the potential to be inverse correlates of immunity against acute SARS-CoV infection versus reinfection, or SARS-CoV vaccination versus challenge. This dataset serves as a resource in human SARS-CoV vaccine candidate trials for modeling vaccine efficacy in populations at risk for severe outcome.",

All analyses were performed in triplicate. Group means represent data from 3 ferrets. DPI, days postinfection. DPR, days post-reinfection. DPC, days post-challenge. Error bars represent standard error. * p = 0.002 (Student's t-test) difference from the mock, ** non-significant difference from the mock. (TIF)",
