Currently, there are no vaccines or therapeutic drugs clinically approved for treatments of ZIKV infection, however. And the drugs used for treating ZIKV in pregnant women require a higher safety profile. Here, we identified an anti-asthmatic drug, montelukast, which is of safety profile for pregnant women and exhibited antiviral efficacy against ZIKV infection in vitro and in vivo. And we showed that montelukast could disrupt the integrity of the virions to release the viral genomic RNA, hence irreversibly inhibiting viral infectivity. In consideration of the neuro-protective activity that montelukast possessed, which was previously reported, it is promising that montelukast could be used for patients with ZIKV infection, particularly for pregnant women.",

The infection of ZIKV has aroused global awareness only in recent years because of some severe neurological complications such as Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (Brasil et al., 2016; Peixoto et al., 2019) and congenital Zika syndrome (Baud et al., 2017; Gurung et al., 2019) , which consists of many clinical manifestations including intracranial calcification (ICC) and cerebellar hypoplasia (de Fatima Vasco Aragao et al., 2016; Oliveira Melo et al., 2016; Cui et al., 2017) , and is remarkably typified by microcephaly found both in humans and in animal models (Cui et al., 2017) , although symptoms of majority of infection with ZIKV are mild or asymptomatic. In addition, infection with ZIKV leads to impaired human spermatozoa production demonstrated by decreased sperm count in the early stage of ZIKV infection (Joguet et al., 2017) . And even 1 year after ZIKV infection, abnormal spermogram results could still be observed (Avelino-Silva et al., 2018) .",

            "text": "Since the local outbreak in Brazil and quick spread to other countries in 2015, the effort for seeking inhibitors suitable for treatment of ZIKV is ongoing till now. Targeting different stage of ZIKV life cycle, some inhibitors have been discovered . The first step of ZIKV infection is its attachment to the host cell membrane. A peptide derived from the stem region of E protein of ZIKV blocked the binding of virions to cells via its interaction with E proteins to disrupt the integrity of the viral membrane (Yu et al., 2017) . Erythromycin estolate was also found to effectively inhibit ZIKV infection by disrupting the integrity of the viral membrane . ZINC33683341 and curcumin also inhibit infection of ZIKV by disturbing the interaction between virions and cells (Delvecchio et al., 2016; Fernando et al., 2016; Li et al., 2017b; Mounce et al., 2017) . Nanchangmycin, one of the antibiotics against gram-positive bacteria, inhibited ZIKV infection through blocking clathrinmediated endocytosis (Rausch et al., 2017) . A natural oxysterol, 25-hydroxycholesterol also inhibited ZIKV infection probably owing to the obstruction of the membrane fusion mediated by E protein (Li et al., 2017a) . Some inhibitors can interfere with the viral RNA replication to break off the viral life cycle. For example, 7-deaza-2 -C-acetylene-adenosine (NITD008), an adenosine analog, inhibited ZIKV and DENV replications in a dose-dependent manner in vitro by terminating viral RNA synthesis and protected mice from ZIKV infection (Yin et al., 2009; Deng et al., 2016a) . Emricasan, a pan-caspase inhibitor, held back the increase in caspase-3 activity induced by ZIKV infection and protected neural progenitors (Xu et al., 2016) . By screening about 100 Food and Drug Administration (FDA)approved pregnancy category B drugs, we identified montelukast, an anti-asthmatic drug. The antiviral activities of montelukast against ZIKV and other two flaviviruses, DENV and YFV, in vitro were evaluated. Montelukast also exhibited protective efficacy against ZIKV vertical transmission and lethal challenge. The underlying mechanisms for infectivity inhibition of flaviviruses caused by montelukast were investigated as well in this study.",

BHK-21 cells were infected with mixture of ZIKV strain SZ01 and drugs at the final concentration of 10 \u00b5M. When the ZIKVinduced cytopathic effect (CPE) of BHK-21 cells was obvious, CCK-8, a highly water-soluble non-radioactive reagent like XTT, allowing sensitive colorimetric assays for the determination of cell viability, was used to detect the antiviral activity of drugs. Montelukast, showing more than 80% inhibition of ZIKV infection, was selected for further study. To confirm the antiviral activity of montelukast, whose chemical structure is shown in Figure 1A , against ZIKV infection, plaque reduction assay was employed in two different cell types, BHK-21 and Vero E6. First, we tested the antiviral efficacy of montelukast against infection of ZIKV strain SZ01. It showed that montelukast inhibited ZIKV strain SZ01 infection in a dose-dependent manner with a similar IC50 value of 1.14 \u00b1 0.19 \u00b5M in BHK-21 cells ( Figure 1B and Table 2 ) and 1.35 \u00b1 0.17 \u00b5M in Vero E6 cells ( Figure 1E and Table 2 ). It is known that ZIKV is classified into two distinct phylogenetic lineages, the African and the Asian lineages; and there are intrinsic differences in the pathogenicity and virulence between these two lineages of ZIKV (Simonin et al., 2017) . We then further tested if montelukast could block infection by different ZIKV strains from Asian and African lineages. As shown in Figure 1 , besides ZIKV strain SZ01 (Asian lineage), montelukast also potently inhibited infection of ZIKV strain MR766 (African lineage) and FLR (Asian lineage) with IC50 values of 1.39 \u00b1 0.13 and 1.29 \u00b1 0.23 \u00b5M in BHK-21 cells (Figures 1C,D and Table 2 ) and of 1.23 \u00b1 0.16 and 1.88 \u00b1 0.36 \u00b5M in Vero E6 cells (Figures 1F,G and Table 2) , respectively, which indicated that montelukast was effective in blocking infection of two lineages of ZIKV strains isolated from rhesus monkeys or patients in divergent regions. Furthermore, the antiviral activity of montelukast against ZIKV strain SZ01 infection All experiments were carried out in triplicate, and the error bars stand for standard deviation (SD).

However, little is known about its potential mechanism of the antiviral activity against ZIKV, DENV, and YFV. In order to determine at which stage of the viral life cycle the montelukast executed antiviral function, we first investigated the influence of the time of addition on plaque formation in BHK-21 cells. The montelukast was added with virus simultaneously (time 0) or at different time points after viral infection. At 16 hpi, the supernatant was discarded, and the cells were then washed to perform the plaque assay for evaluating inhibitory effects of montelukast at different time points. As shown in Figure 4A , simultaneous addition of montelukast and ZIKV to BHK-21 cells (time 0) maximally decreased the plaque numbers. With time lapsed from 1 to 4 h, the inhibitory activity of montelukast gradually decreased. The inhibitory effect on plaque formation was barely observed if montelukast was added 8 hpi, indicating that montelukast hardly suppressed flavivirus RNA replication in the late stage. It was confirmed by the assay of viral RNA replication ( Figure 4D ) where montelukast and NITD008, an adenosine nucleoside inhibitor targeting the stage of flavivirus RNA replication (Yin et al., 2009; Deng et al., 2016a) , were both added 4 hpi. The patterns of the time of addition experiment and assay of viral RNA replication were similar for DENV-2 (Figures 4B,E) and YFV 17D (Figures 4C,F) , suggesting that montelukast inhibited flavivirus infection at the early stage. As the early stage of virus infection consists of processes including viral attachment and internalization, the effect of montelukast on the virus adsorption or internalization was evaluated separately as previously described (Talarico et al., 2005; Talarico and Damonte, 2007) to ascertain the particular The 50% cytotoxicity concentration (CC50) is presented as means \u00b1 SD (standard deviation).",

As shown in Figure 5A , the montelukast blocked ZIKV attachment as the amount of cell-bound virus particles highly decreased in the presence of montelukast to a comparable extent caused by curcumin, a known inhibitor that suppressed ZIKV attachment to the cell (Mounce et al., 2017) . The inhibitory effect of montelukast on the subsequent step, that is, virus internalization, was next analyzed. After virus adsorption on ice, the unbound virus was removed, and the montelukast was subsequently added to the cell culture. The temperature was immediately shifted to 37 \u2022 C to initiate virus penetration, and plaque assay was performed thereafter. The chloroquine phosphate, a known inhibitor blocking virus internalization, was included as control. It showed that montelukast has little effect on the internalization of ZIKV ( Figure 5D ). The patterns of effect of montelukast on adsorption or internalization of DENV-2 (Figures 5B,E) and YFV 17D (Figures 5C,F) were similar to those of ZIKV. Overall, these results indicated that the antiviral action of montelukast mainly took place at the adsorption step in the early stage of virus life cycle.",

            "text": "Montelukast, one of the leukotriene receptor antagonists, is the most prescribed cysteinyl leukotriene 1 (CysLT1) antagonist safely used in asthmatic patients for many years (Hoxha et al., 2017) . It is interesting that montelukast exhibited potential antiviral efficacy against ZIKV in vitro and in vivo. Montelukast not only inhibited infections of several types of flaviviruses, including ZIKV of Asian and African lineages, DENV-2, and YFV 17D, in two kinds of cells, but also protected A129 mice from lethal ZIKV challenge and blocked vertical transmission of ZIKV in pregnant mice. The inhibition of ZIKV infectivity by montelukast is irreversible probably owing to the disruption of the integrity of ZIKV virions and the release of ZIKV genomic RNA. It should be noted that the concentration needed to cause 50% degradation of the genome was a little bit higher than the concentration required to yield 50% reduction in infectivity, which was also reported in the studies from others (Lok et al., 2012; Yu et al., 2017) . Just as mentioned in their study, this might be caused by the use of more viruses in the genome degradation assay or by some virions having only partial genomes released to be still protected from degradation and to be likely non-infectious. Interestingly, montelukast has no effect on the genomic RNA release of EV71, an unenveloped RNA virus (Supplementary Figure S3A , and Supplementary  Figures S3B-E show the amplicons of ZIKV SZ01, DENV-2, YFV 17D and EV71 that were resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis). Besides, montelukast also exhibited an antiviral activity against VSV-GFP (Supplementary Figure S2) , which is an enveloped non-flavivirus, suggesting that the montelukast probably targeted to the lipid membrane of the viral shell, not to the envelope protein of the virus. On the other hand, the proven pharmacological action of montelukast could favor its antiviral effect as concomitant effects. Leukotrienes are important in mediating the vascular leakage caused by DENV infection-induced mast cell activation, leading to increased vascular permeability, which may result in hemorrhage within internal organs and leakage of plasma into the tissues, the distinctive features of dengue shock syndrome (DSS) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) (Ahmad et al., 2018) . Montelukast, the leukotriene receptor antagonist, could reduce the vascular permeability and restore the vascular integrity to prevent vascular leakage and hemorrhaging (St John, 2013; St John et al., 2013) . Hence, it is possible that the modulation of inflammation by montelukast would contribute to the in vivo anti-ZIKV effects. Certainly, other putative mechanisms underlying the antiviral action of montelukast, such as the blockage of binding of ZIKV E protein to its cell receptor, cannot be totally excluded. However, the receptor utilized by ZIKV is still controversial (Govero et al., 2016; Nowakowski et al., 2016; Retallack et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2018) ; therefore, more investigations will be needed in the following research.",

            "text": "The major sequela caused by congenital ZIKV infection is microcephaly, which is evidenced in humans and animal models (Tang et al., 2016; Cui et al., 2017) , and pregnant women are the direct victims of the ZIKV infection of fetus, making it vitally important that the treatment for pregnant women infection by ZIKV should be very cautious. Luckily, montelukast is classified as category B in the FDA pregnancy category and has been successfully used for treatment of pregnant women with asthma (Bakhireva et al., 2007; Cavero-Carbonell et al., 2017) . Animal studies showed no adverse effects on embryo and fetal development at oral doses up to 400 mg/kg/day in rats or up to 100 mg/kg/day in rabbits, as described in the product information of montelukast (trade name Singulair R ) produced by Merck Sharp & Dohme, Ltd. With the combination of the fact that montelukast blocked vertical transmission of ZIKV in pregnant mice and its safety profile for pregnant women, it is promising that montelukast could be used for treatment of pregnant women infected with ZIKV. And more surprising and exciting to us is that montelukast displayed neuro-protective activity in several animal models. Montelukast may improve the fiber connectivity and long-term functional recovery after brain ischemia caused by stroke, enhancing recruitment and maturation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (Gelosa et al., 2019) , and may ameliorate amyloid\u03b2-induced memory impairment via inhibition of neuroinflammation and apoptosis in mice (Lai et al., 2014) . Moreover, treatment of old animals with montelukast reduces neuro-inflammation, elevates hippocampal neurogenesis, and improves learning and memory (Marschallinger et al., 2015) . The montelukast-mediated restoration of cognitive function correlates with the increased neurogenesis. In consideration of the role of neuro-inflammation played in the occurrence and development of microcephaly induced by ZIKV infection, it is hoped that montelukast may be used for relief from neuro-inflammation.",
