The causal organism is a protozoan parasite of genus Plasmodium which spreads to the human host by the bite of hitherto infected female Anopheles mosquito. In the course of biting, a salivary protein of Anopheles helps in blood feeding behavior and having the ability to elicit the host immune response. This study represents a series of immunoinformatics approaches to design multi-epitope subunit vaccine using Anopheles mosquito salivary proteins. Designed subunit vaccine was evaluated for its immunogenicity, allergenicity and physiochemical parameters. To enhance the stability of vaccine protein, disulfide engineering was performed in a region of high mobility. Codon adaptation and in silico cloning was also performed to ensure the higher expression of designed subunit vaccine in E. coli K12 expression system. Finally, molecular docking and simulation study was performed for the vaccine protein and TLR-4 receptor, to determine the binding free energy and complex stability. Moreover, the designed subunit vaccine was found to induce anti-salivary immunity which may have the ability to prevent the entry of Plasmodium sporozoites into the human host.",

As per the World Health Organization (WHO) latest estimate, almost 212 million cases of malaria along with 42,900 deaths were reported in December 2016 among 91 countries, worldwide 3 . The high risk of developing malarial infection among a population group depends upon the several factors including the presence of children under the age of 5 years 4 , a patient with HIV co-infection 4 , pregnant woman 4 , mobile population 4,5 , and travelers 6 . The causal organism of malaria is a protozoan parasite belongs to the genus Plasmodium and it spreads by the bite of hitherto infected female Anopheles mosquito 7 . There are mainly four species of Plasmodium namely P. falciparum, P. ovale, P. malariae and P. vivax that are responsible for the disastrous diseased condition among human being. Recently, P. knowlesi was considered as the fifth species with the ability to cause human malaria infection in Southeast Asian countries mainly Malaysia 8 . If we talk about the severity of infection and distribution of disease, P. falciparum is the most severe form of a parasite than other leads to most of the deaths whereas P. vivax is the most widely distributed human parasite outside the sub-Saharan region of Africa and cause huge morbidity. The life cycle of malaria parasite consisting of four stages namely liver stage, blood stage, and transmission stage in human being while the last one is mosquito stage and keeping in mind the end goal to destroy the ailment, each stage ought to be considered for treatment 9 . Artemisinin combination therapy is the first-line treatment for P. falciparum infection in the region where chloroquine resistance has been evolved.

Therefore, in this study, we applied a novel immunoinformatics approach to design multi-epitope based subunit vaccine that may prevent the disease by maintaining the host hemostasis by the inhibition of anticoagulant and anti-inflammatory proteins present in mosquito saliva. It will also inhibit the entry of parasite within the host body by a similar mechanism. Apart from this, if any way parasite enters into the host body, vaccine candidate will stop the salivary protein-mediated induction of parasitic growth.",

A. stephensi transmit the malarial infection by injecting various Plasmodium species to the human host typically via bites. Salivary gland of mosquitos implement various functions for the survival of the vector and complement their feeding behavior by producing a large array of a biochemically active molecule that has immunomodulatory, anti-coagulant and anti-inflammatory properties that disable the host hemostatic response for successful blood feeding 13, 14 . Salivary proteins are antigenic and immunogenic in nature which helps the infectivity of parasite 14, 15 . D7 protein and salivary apyrase are two different salivary proteins that help in binding, and inhibition of the platelets aggregation, respectively. Salivary peroxidase helps in heme binding and peroxidase activity while Putative TIL domain polypeptide functions as trypsin inhibitor 16 . Recently, it was reported that hamadarin is a 16 kDa protein present in Anopheles stephensi saliva which inhibits the activation of plasma contact system 17 and ultimately blood coagulation. Another protein from Anopheles gambie saliva namely gSG6 plays essential blood feeding 18, 19 . Recently, Vijay S. et al. reported that salivary proteins might be utilized to develop novel antimalarial control strategies via innate immune protection against malaria 16 . These proteins could likewise evoke a host IgG response in natural conditions 20, 21 .

The antigenicity score obtained for this vaccine construct is comparable with the antigenicity of subunit vaccine reported elsewhere 24 . Allergy is an overreaction by our immune system to the previously encountered, ordinarily harmless substance that results in sneezing, wheezing, skin rash, and swelling of the mucous membrane 35 . Allergenicity of predicted vaccine construct was determined using AllerTOP online server and found that the vaccine protein is nonallergic in nature and safe for the human use 23,35 . Physiochemical properties assessment. The physiochemical properties of vaccine construct were characterized by using ProtParam server and evaluated for seven parameters. The molecular weight of vaccine protein was found to be 58 kDa which will favor the antigenicity of the vaccine construct 23 . The theoretical pI was found to be 5.61 showing its slightly acidic nature while the total numbers of negative and positive charge residues were 48 and 40, respectively 24 . The estimated half-life in mammalian reticulocytes was 4.4 hours, in vitro; while 20 and 10 hours in yeast and E. coli, in vivo. The extinction coefficient was found to be 119530 M-1 cm-1, at 280 nm measured in water, assuming that all cysteine residues are reduced. The score obtained for instability index was 29.56, showing the stable nature of vaccine construct. The value of the aliphatic index and Grand average of hydropathicity (GRAVY) was 71.24 and \u22120.276, respectively. The estimated value of aliphatic index represents the thermostable nature of designed subunit vaccine because higher the value of aliphatic index, greater will be the thermo stability 24 . While, negative value of GRAVY for the input subunit vaccine represents the hydrophilic nature of vaccine 24 . Conclusively, the designed vaccine is immunogenic, thermostable and hydrophilic in nature.",

Lack of effective vaccine and emergence of resistance against artemisinin created a disastrous condition among the people living in the endemic zone. Therefore, it's the need of time to search for the new options to tackle this severe problem. The vector for malaria is the Anopheles stephensi in the Indian subcontinent leads to the transfer of malaria parasite. Literature survey reveals that salivary proteins of Anopheles mosquito not only supports the pathogenesis but are also immunogenic in nature. Therefore, this study was designed to reach a step ahead in the path of vaccine development. We used the primary amino acid sequence of Anopheles mosquito salivary protein to design a subunit vaccine construct. The constructed vaccine has CTL, HTL and BCL epitopes of varying length. It has antigenic properties in the absence of allergenic properties. It was stable and having a good binding affinity for the TLR-4 receptor. Collectively, this study applied a series of immunoinformatics tools in a sequential manner to find an effective vaccine that may fight against the malaria infection. However, this study needs experimental validation to prove this computational work. The experimental work may include the synthesis of designed subunit vaccine followed by the in vitro and in vivo analysis to determine the immunogenicity and safety concern of the same.",

In other words subunit vaccine must contain both CTL and HTL epitopes along with suitable linkers. Keeping in mind the end goal to effectively activate both innate and adaptive immune response, subunit vaccine must consist of a strong immunostimulatory adjuvant. In the previous decades, there is a huge headway in the adjuvant engineering, for instance, Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists have made its contribution as a part of peptide-based subunit vaccine as a functional option for present-day immunotherapy 45 . Recently, Junqueira et al. have shown that CpGs oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG ODNs) and Glycoinositolphospholipids (GIPL) gotten from Trypanosome cruzi having the ability to activate TLR-4 and TLR9 leads to actuate potent pro-inflammatory reaction 46 . Secondly, proteo-glycolipid complex (P8GLC) derived from Leishmania parasite has shown its affinity for the TLR-4 receptor and recognized as ligand 47 . Moreover, TLRs having the capability to recognize the Plasmodium ligands, for example, Plasmodium falciparum primes the human TLR-4 response towards high proinflammatory cytokine profile 48 . Shanmugam A. et at. has reported that synthetic TLR-4 agonist namely RS-09 (Sequence: APPHALS) can be used as a novel class of adjuvant 49 , therefore, it was added as an adjuvant and linked with epitopes (CTL and HTL) by using EAAAK linker 50 . Linkers assume an imperative part in simulating the vaccine construct to work as an independent immunogen and producing higher antibody titer than that of single immunogen 51 . Total three linkers namely EAAAK, AAY, and GPGPG, were used to construct the final vaccine. AAY and GPGPG linkers were added at the intra-epitope position to link the CTL and HTL epitopes, respectively. B-cell epitope prediction. B lymphocytes, a type of white blood cells, are the key player of humoral immunity by antibody production. The identification of B-cell epitopes is an essential part in vaccine designing. BCPREDS server was used to predict the linear B-cell epitopes of 20 amino acids long. The amino acid sequence of final vaccine construct was used as an input sequence in plain format followed by the selection of fixed length epitope prediction method and length of the epitope. BCPREDS (default method) was selected as the prediction method for the epitope of 20 amino acids long 52 . The specificity threshold was set to be by default at 75% to get the result in a user-friendly format.

The protein-protein docked complex output of ClusPro was used as an input to perform the molecular dynamics simulation using Gromacs v5.1.5. Initially, the crystal water of complex was removed followed by the topology generation using a GROMOS9643a1 force field. In the next step, protein complex was centered in a cubic boundary box and filled by water molecule using simple point charge (SPC) water model and chloride ion was used for the charge neutralization of complex. Moreover, energy minimization followed by canonical equilibration (NVT ensemble) and isothermal-isobaric (NPT ensemble) was performed for a time duration of 100 ps. Finally, molecular dynamics simulation was executed for the time duration of 10ns 59 . The root mean square deviation (RMDS) for backbone and root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) for side chain was determined.",
