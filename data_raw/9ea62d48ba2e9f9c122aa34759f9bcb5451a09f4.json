Based on a large dataset of simulated weekly surveillance time series, we performed a systematic assessment of 21 statistical algorithms, 19 implemented in the R package surveillance and two other methods. We estimated false positive rate (FPR), probability of detection (POD), probability of detection during the first week, sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive values and F 1 -measure for each detection method. Then, to identify the factors associated with these performance measures, we ran multivariate Poisson regression models adjusted for the characteristics of the simulated time series (trend, seasonality, dispersion, outbreak sizes, etc.). The FPR ranged from 0.7% to 59.9% and the POD from 43.3% to 88.7%. Some methods had a very high specificity, up to 99.4%, but a low sensitivity. Methods with a high sensitivity (up to 79.5%) had a low specificity. All methods had a high negative predictive value, over 94%, while positive predictive values ranged from 6.5% to 68.4%. Multivariate Poisson regression models showed that performance measures were strongly influenced by the characteristics of time series. Past or current outbreak size and duration strongly influenced detection performances.",

One of the objectives of health surveillance is outbreak detection, which is crucial to enabling rapid investigation and implementation of control measures [2] . The threat of bioterrorism has stimulated interest in improving health surveillance systems for early detection of outbreaks [3, 4] reemergence of infectious diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome due to New Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012 [5] or Ebola in West Africa in 2014 [6] . Nowadays, a large number of surveillance systems are computer-supported. The computer support and statistical alarms are intended to improve outbreak detection for traditional or syndromic surveillance [7, 8] . These systems routinely monitor a large amount of data, recorded as time series of counts in a given geographic area for a given population. They produce statistical alarms that need to be confirmed by an epidemiologist, who determines if further investigation is needed. One limitation of these detection systems is an occasional lack of specificity, leading to false alarms that can overwhelm the epidemiologist with verification tasks [9, 10] . It is thus important to implement statistical methods that offer a good balance between sensitivity and specificity in order to detect a large majority of outbreaks without generating too many false positive alarms.",

The main statistical approaches have been reviewed by Shmueli et al. [11] and Unkel et al. [12] . By restricting these reviews to the methods that allow temporal detection of outbreaks without integrating the spatial distribution of cases, the general principle is to identify a time interval in which the observed number of cases of an event under surveillance (i.e. the number of reported cases) is significantly higher than expected. This identification is mainly based on a two-step process: First, an expected number of cases of the event of interest for the current time unit (generally a week or a day) is estimated and then compared to the observed value by a statistical test. A statistical alarm is triggered if the observed value is significantly different from the expected value. The main difference between statistical methods lies in how the expected value is estimated, which is most often done using statistical process control or regression techniques or combination of both [12] .",

Monitoring a large number of polymorphic time series requires flexible statistical methods to deal with several well-known characteristics observed in time series: the frequency and variance of the number of cases, secular trend and one or more seasonality terms [14] . Even if some authors proposed to classify time series into a small number of categories and sought suitable algorithms for each category, in this automated and prospective framework, statistical methods cannot easily be fine tuned by choosing the most appropriate parameters adapted to each time series in an operational way, as explained by Farrington et al.

Some authors have proposed a systematic assessment of the performances of certain methods in order to choose one reference algorithm [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . They assessed these methods on a real dataset [16, 21] , a simulated dataset [18-20, 22, 23] or on real time series for which simulated outbreaks were added [24, 25] . Simulating data offers the advantage of knowing the exact occurrence of the simulated outbreaks and their characteristics (amplitude, etc.). For example, Lotze et al. developed a simulated dataset of time series and outbreak signatures [26] . In the same way, Noufaily et al. [9] proposed a thorough simulation study to improve the Farrington algorithm [15] . Guillou et al. [27] compared the performance of their own algorithm to that of the improved Farrington, using the same simulated dataset. This dataset was also used by Salmon et al. to assess their method [28] .",

Note that while of the algorithm test statistics are based on the likelihood of single-week observations independent of recent ones, CuSUMs are not, and they may be important for applications where detection of gradual events rather than one-week spikes is especially critical. The OutbreakP method had the lowest specificity without having a better POD or POD1week than the first two groups. Finally, a third group consists of the other methods that had good specificity (over 0.9) but a lower sensitivity, POD and POD1week than the first two groups. All 21 methods presented a high negative predictive value, greater than 94%. The PPV of OutbreakP is very low (6.5%), while the Periodic Negative Binomial GLM method had the highest PPV (68.4%).",

Evaluation and comparison of statistical methods for early temporal detection of outbreaks \u2022 Adjusted FPR ratios decreased when the amplitude and duration (driven by k 1 in Eq (1)) of past outbreaks increased. It is indeed more difficult to detect an outbreak when past outbreaks have occurred, especially when these outbreaks are large and when the method does not under-weight their influence to estimate the expected number of cases. Adjusted FPR ratio was 2.75 times higher for time series with a secular trend than for the others. As we simulated time series with a non-negative trend (\u03b2 ! 0 in Eq (1)), it was expected that FPR would decrease with a trend, especially for methods which do not integrate a trend in the estimation of the expected number of cases. In the same way, annual seasonality-and biannual seasonality to an even greater extent-and overdispersion increased FPR. We observed a nonlinear relation between FPR and baseline frequency: FPR ratio increased from the lowest frequencies to 12 cases per week, then decreased for the highest frequencies, with no clear explanation. Only periodic negative binomial GLM presented a FPR lower than improved Farrington FPR (FPR ratio = 0.71). Adjusted FPR ratios of OutbreakP and all CUSUM variants were higher than 40.

We also simulated a high diversity of outbreaks in terms of amplitude and duration. In our opinion, this simulated dataset presents a high representativeness of real weekly surveillance data. To extend our results to daily surveillance data, it should be necessary to perform a similar study with daily surveillance data. These characteristics of the simulated dataset enabled us to propose simple intrinsic performance indicator estimations such as FPR and POD and sensitivity and specificity to compare the performance of the evaluated methods. Furthermore, this allows us to compare our results to other studies based on the same dataset. Negative predictive value and positive predictive value are proposed as operational indicators for decision making when an alarm is triggered, or not triggered, by an algorithm. A benefit of the addition of outbreaks to the baseline weeks is that outlier removal strategies considered by many authors may be objectively tested and evaluated. One limitation in the simulation process was the fact that only increasing secular trends were used. Increasing secular trends would facilitate outbreak detection, while decreasing trends would hamper it. Furthermore, our study was designed based on weekly surveillance, while syndromic surveillance systems are most often daily systems. In daily surveillance time series, other seasonalities such as the \"day of the week\" effect need to be taken into account, which is not the case in our study.",

In a pragmatic approach, it seems very difficult to adapt the tuning parameters of these methods for every time series. In France, public health agencies, such as the French National Public Health Agency (Sant\u00e9 publique France), the French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health Safety (Anses) and the French Armed Forces Center for Epidemiology and Public Health (CESPA) have deployed computer-supported outbreak detection systems in traditional or syndromic surveillance contexts [42] [43] [44] [45] . They monitor a broad range of time series on a daily or weekly basis without, however, having rigorously evaluated the algorithms implemented. In the same way, the performance of the methods varied according to different baseline profiles depending on trend, seasonality, baseline frequency and overdispersion. Even if similar meta-models were already proposed by Buckeridge et al. for example [40] , an original approach was to compare performance indicators adjusted for these parameters in a regression model. As expected, the adjusted performance of the 21 methods was penalized by increasing amplitude and duration in past outbreaks and by annual or biannual seasonality. Conversely, performance was better for increasing amplitude and duration in current outbreaks to be detected. More generally, the methods' performance was highly dependent on simulation tuning parameters.",

False positive rate (FPR) and probability of detection (POD) were proposed by Noufaily et al. [9] . We proposed an observation-based sensitivity measure and an event based sensitivity (POD). The concept of sensitivity based on alerting in each observation period is not applicable in some applications because signals of interest are intermittent and multimodal and may even be interpreted as multiple events. Many of the algorithms are based on the likelihood of single-week observations independent of recent ones, but CUSUMs are not, and the large sensitivity advantage in the CUSUMs methods, diminished for POD and POD1week, may be a result of the way the outbreak effects are modeled. By contrast, the implementation of the POD measure is uniformly applicable. Public health response to an outbreak depends on its early detection. In the POD definition, an outbreak was considered to be detected even if the first statistical alarm was issued during its last week. With the aim of estimating early detection performance, we also proposed POD during the first week, which cannot be considered alone, because even if it is done belatedly, an outbreak needs to be detected by the methods.
