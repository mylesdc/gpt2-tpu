            "text": "Background: Assessment of the adverse effects of oral health problems on oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) is essential to ensure the well-being of children. The Early Childhood Oral Health Impact Scale (ECOHIS) is an instrument that was designed to assess caregivers' perceptions of OHRQoL in preschool children. Although it has been translated into many languages, it has yet to be validated in Arabic. Therefore, this study aimed to translate this questionnaire to Arabic (A-ECOHIS) and test its psychometric properties. Methods: Questionnaire responses from three samples of caregivers of preschool children \u2264 6 years of age were collected: (i) community-based (n = 422), from preschools selected as a stratified random sample; (ii) clinic-based, from those seeking pediatric dental care at a university clinic (n = 246); and (iii) a test-retest sample (n = 68), a clinic-based group of caregivers who completed questionnaires twice about siblings who were not receiving dental care. Children received a dental examination to assess their decayed, missed, filled teeth (dmft) scores. Convergent validity was evaluated by assessing the A-ECOHIS scores in relation to the response to a global question. Discriminant validity was evaluated by comparing the scores of children with varying levels of oral disease. Internal consistency was assessed by calculating Cronbach's alpha, and the test-retest reliability was assessed using intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs). Results: The A-ECOHIS scores of the questionnaire sections and the global oral health rating were significantly correlated; Spearman correlation coefficients were, r = 0.55, P \u2264 0.01 (overall score), r = 0.54, P \u2264 0.01 (child section), and r = 0.51, P \u2264 0.01 (family section). The mean A-ECOHIS scores were also statistically significantly higher in children with higher dmft scores compared with lower dmft, and in the clinic-based sample compared with the community sample. The Cronbach's alpha value of the the child, family sections and overall questionnaire were, 0.80, 0.78, and 0.85, respectively. The intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) of A-ECOHIS was 0.86. Conclusion: The A-ECOHIS performed well on all psychometric tests to which it was applied. Thus, it is a valid and reliable instrument that can be used in Arabic-speaking caregivers of preschoolers aged 2 to 6 years.",

These problems include temporary teething discomfort, trauma to the teeth and supporting structures, and early childhood caries [2] . Caries, despite recent preventive regimes and advanced early diagnosis methods, remains a prevalent childhood disease around the world. In fact, dental caries is the most common chronic disease in children [3] . In the US, 1 in every 4 children between 2 and 5 years of age has had caries in the primary teeth [4] . The prevalence of caries is also high in most Arabi countries including Saudi Arabia [5, 6] . In Saudi Arabia, the prevalence of caries was estimated to be 73% [7] , and a meta-analysis by Khan et al. found a mean decayed, missing, filled teeth (dmft) score due to caries of 5.38 in primary dentition [8] .",

The mean A-ECOHIS scores for subjects with a dmft score of zero in the child section, family section and total score were 4.2 \u00b1 4.2, 2.1 \u00b1 2.7, and 6.3 \u00b1 6.2, respectively, whereas they were 4.7 \u00b1 4.3, 2.2 \u00b1 2.9, and 6.6 \u00b1 5.9, respectively, among participants with a dmft score of 1-5. Among subjects with a dmft above 5, the A-ECOHIS scores were 7.8 \u00b1 5.0, 3.6 \u00b1 3.0 and 11.2 \u00b1 7.1, respectively.",

Evaluating and describing these influences can aid dentists in assessing children's oral health needs [11, 24, 25, 30, 37] , providing better oral health care services [11, 24, 26, 31] , and improving the oral health outcomes of children [11, 22] . Although assessment of OHRQoL is well established in adults following several decades of use, its application in children is relatively new and less understood. Prior to Pahel et al's development of ECOHIS [22] , the first documented child-specific OHRQoL scale was presented by Jokovic et al. in 2002 to assess the impact of oral conditions on QoL in children 11 to 14 years of age [38] . Proper translation and validation are important for cross-cultural adaptation of QoL questionnaires [24] [25] [26] 39] and also enable comparisons between different countries using the same measurement instrument [24-26, 31, 40] . The ECOHIS questionnaire has so far been translated into French [23] , Chinese [25] , Farsi [30] , Turkish [31] , Brazilian Portuguese [24, 27] , Spanish [26] , Lithuanian [29] , and Malay [28] . In this study, the ECO-HIS was translated into the Arabic language, and its psychometric properties were tested. Pain was the most frequently reported negative impact measure in the child section in both of our samples, and was common in other studies [22-25, 27, 28] . However, in the Turkish [31] and Lithuanian [29] studies, difficulty in eating and irritability, respectively, were most commonly reported. Similar to some studies [23-25, 29, 31] , caregivers feeling upset was the most frequently reported item in the family section in this study. Taking time off work [22] and feeling guilty [27, 28] were the most commonly reported family impacts in three other studies. Although treatment at the clinic from which our sample was recruited is provided free of charge, about a third of our clinic-based caregivers reported a financial impact, which could have been attributed to other expenses incurred, such as transportation costs or missing work.",

Unexpectedly, caregivers who reported good general oral health had slightly higher A-ECOHIS scores than did those who reported it to be fair. This could have been due to the subjectivity of the options, especially in two consecutive categories. Overall, there was a significant correlation between the global question and each of the total, child and family A-ECOHIS scores, as reported in other validation studies [22-24, 30, 31] . The Spearman correlation coefficient that we calculated for the total A-ECOHIS score with the global question was higher than that reported in the French study (\u22120.20) [23] , but not the Turkish (0.68) [31] or Lithuanian (0.72) [29] studies.",

The total A-ECOHIS score and those of each section of the questionnaire were significantly higher among children with higher dmft scores compared with those with lower scores. The clinic sample, which we hypothesized would have a poorer oral health status than the community (school) sample, had significantly higher A-ECOHIS scores on all sections of the scale, as observed in other studies [23, 30] . This also indicated that caregivers are able to respond accurately regarding their child's OHRQoL based on the child's visible oral health condition [22, 42, 43] . The A-ECOHIS child and family section scores in this study were significantly correlated, suggesting that the scale is related to the concept it is intended to measure [22, 31] , with a correlation coefficient that was within the same range as some reports (0.54 -0.68) [23, 24, 29, 31] , but higher than that of the ECOHIS development study (0.36) [22] . The inter-item correlations observed in this study also fell within the range of correlations observed in other studies (0.005 to 0.8) [23, [28] [29] [30] [31] .",

Missing responses in this study of the A-ECOHIS were infrequent, ranging from 0.2 to 5.5% in the community sample and not exceeding 2.8% in the clinic sample, which is less than what was reported previously [41] . This is a good indication of the comprehensibility and relevance of the A-ECOHIS items [23] . Adding \"don't know\" options to questionnaires helps subjects answer questions thereby avoiding missing data [23] . Nevertheless, some of our respondents left some questions blank. The highest percentages of missing values were in the \"financial impact\" (5.5%) and \"taking time off work\" (4.7%) questions. It is possible that some of the caregivers were mothers unemployed outside of the home who did not have a full picture of the spouse's work status or the family's financial situation. Additionally, respondents may have felt embarrassed by or unwilling to expose their financial difficulties. Indeed, only a small percentage of subjects reported not having enough money, although it seems reasonable to assume that most of the patients who choose to visit the free clinics of King Abdulaziz University are financially insecure. The \"don't know\" responses did not exceed 0.2% of the community-based sample and ranged from 0.8 to 2.1% of the clinic-based sample. This was much lower than the response rate for \"don't know\" in the original study [22] , and the French [23] and the Brazilian [24] validation studies.",
