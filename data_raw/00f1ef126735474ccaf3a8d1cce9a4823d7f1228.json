The synthesis of sulfonyl derivatives of p-methylaminophenol were carried out by reaction of the electrogenerated p-methylquinoneimine with sulfinic acids. Various types of mono (MSP), bis (BSP) and tris (TSP) sulfonyl p-methyl aminophenols were obtained by changing the electrode potential, in one pot under green conditions. The mono sulfonyl-p-(methylamino)phenol derivatives (MSP) were assessed for their in vitro antibacterial activity against the gram positive (Staphylococcus aureus) and gram negative (Escherichia coli) strains. It was found that the tested compounds were more active against Staphylococcus aureus than Escherichia coli. We also found that the antimicrobial activity of MSP derivatives to vary in the order MSP 4 (R = CH 3 ) > MSP 1 (R = p-tolyl) \u2248 MSP 2 (R = phenyl) > MSP 3 (R = p-ClC 6 H 4 ). Moreover, the observed homogeneous rate constants (k obs ) of the reaction of p-methyl quinoneimine with sulfinic acids were estimated in various pH values, based on the EC and ECEC mechanisms, by comparing the simulated cyclic voltammograms with the experimental ones.",

To overcome to this problem, a number of organic and metal catalyst systems has been examined 1-6 . However, they have the disadvantages of safety problems and heavy metal pollution. Organic electrochemical synthesis provides a powerful strategy for the synthesis of organic compounds in both laboratory and industry scale 7-13 . In this method, the electrons are considered as clean reagents, so that this method can be considered as a green technique. Another important feature of this method, which is used in this work, is its selectivity towards synthesis of products. This unique feature arises from the fact that, the different active intermediates can be provided just by changing the electrode potential 7-13 .",

It is also known that, the aminophenols containing a sulphone group in addition to activity against flu A and simple herpes have excellent activity against the HIV infection 19 . On the other hand, it is found that, diphenylsulfone compounds exhibited antibacterial activity 20 .

So, the synthesis of these type of compounds by a simple method without the above discussed disadvantages using a green and controllable strategy is the main object of this paper. Figure 1a shows the cyclic voltammogram (CV) of p-methylaminophenol (MAP) in aqueous phosphate buffer (c = 0.2 M, pH = 2.0). It includes a well-defined anodic (A 1 )/cathodic (C 1 ) peak couple at E 1/2 = 0.44 V versus Ag/ AgCl. These peaks (A 1 and C 1 ) are attributed to two-electron oxidation of MAP to p-methylquinoneimine (MQI) and vice versa, respectively. Under these conditions, I pC1 /I pA1 is near to one, which can be regarded as a criterion for the consistency of electrogenerated MQI under the experimental conditions. Figure 1b shows the CV of MAP in the presence of benzensulfinic acid (BS) under the same conditions as Fig. 1a . Comparison of CVs 1a and 1b shows three important differences: (i) the I pC1 /I pA1 is near to one in Fig. 1a , but is about 0.06 in Fig. 1b , (ii) contrary to Fig. 1b shows two couples of peaks (A 1 /C 1 and A 2 /C 2 ), (iii) E pA1 in Fig. 1b is less positive than that of Fig. 1a . In addition, our data show that two factors: (i) potential scan rate and (ii) BS concentration are effective in the peak current ratio (I pC1 /I pA1 ) of MAP in the presence of BS, so that it decreases with increasing BS concentration and decreasing the potential scan rate.",

The addition of sulfone nucleophile to MSP ox 1-4 followed by aromatization, converts MSP ox 1-4 into bis sulfonyl-p-(methylamino)phenol derivatives (BSP1-4). Since the oxidation of BSP1-4 is more difficult than the oxidation of MSP1-4 and MAP (Fig. 5 ), its oxidation was stopped due to the presence of the two electron-withdrawing sulfonyl groups as well as the insolubility of BSP1-4 in the electrolysis medium. A remarkable finding in this study is related to the role of methanesulfinic acid (MS) as a nucleophile. Despite several attempts to synthesize BSP4, no bis sulfonyl derivative has been isolated and unexpectedly a tris sulfonyl compound, TSP, which is a new sulphonamide molecule was obtained via the oxidation of BSP4 and attack of MS to electrogenerated BSP ox 4. The oxidation of BSP4 at 0.55 V vs. Ag/AgCl, can be related to the lower electron-withdrawing ability of the methyl-sulfony group compared with aryl-sulfony groups that causes the oxidation potentials of bis and tris sulfonyl compounds do not have any significant differences. In addition, higher nucleophilicity and lower steric effect of MS compared with aryl-sulfone nucleophiles and more solubility of the MQI is a bis-Michael acceptor (ortho and meta of the phenolic group) and can be attacked by the sulfone nucleophiles from two sites to yield two isomers (for example, 4-(methylamino)-m-(methylsulfonyl)phenol and 4-(methylamino)-o-(methylsulfonyl) phenoltypes). However, the comparison of simulated 1 H NMR 35 for the possible compounds and experimental 1 H NMR of the final product (See SI), confirms synthesis of ortho derivative. The protonation of the amino group in MAP at pH = 2.0, makes the ortho position in MQI more reactive than meta position for the addition reaction.",

Our data shows that, k obs is strongly dependent to pH so that, it increases with decreasing pH value. The protonation of the nitrogen atom in MQI, makes it more reactive toward the addition reaction and is responsible for increasing k obs . In addition, the results displays that, k obs is also dependent directly to the electron donating ability of the nucleophile, so that, it varies in the order methanesulfinic acid > p-toluenesulfinic acid > banzenesulfinic acid > p-chlorosulfinic acid (Fig. 8 ).",

Firstly, in this method, a variety of products could be formed just by changing the applied potential. In this work, the synthesis of some mono and bis (or tris) sulfonyl compounds were carried out by electrochemical oxidation of MAP in the presence of arylsulfinic acids only with changing the applied potential from 0.40 to 0.55 V vs. Ag/AgCl. Secondly, this method proceeds in a single step, in ambient conditions, without dealing with strong acids/base, organic solvent and catalysis, under green and mild conditions with high atom economy.",

The working electrode used in the voltammetry experiments was a glassy carbon disc (1.8 mm 2 area) and platinum wire was used as counter electrode. The working electrode used in controlled-potential coulometry and synthesis was an assembly of three ordinary soft carbon plates (20 mm length, 10 mm width and 40 mm height), and large stainless steel cylinder (25 cm 2 area) constituted the counter electrode. The working electrode potentials were measured versus Ag/AgCl (all electrodes from AZAR electrode). The electrochemical synthesis was performed under controlled-potential condition in a simple cell equipped with a magnetic stirrer. More details are described in our previous paper 36 .",

The simulation was carried out assuming semi-infinite one-dimensional diffusion and planar electrode geometry. The experimental parameters entered for digital simulation consisted of the following: (i) the transfer coefficient (\u03b1) was assumed to be 0.5. (ii) The formal potentials were obtained experimentally as the midpoint potential between the anodic and cathodic peaks (E mid ). (iii) Analytical concentration of MAP, E start , E switch , E end and temperature = 25 \u00b0C. All these parameters were kept constant throughout the fitting of the digitally simulated voltammogram to the experimental data. Electrochemical oxidation of MAP was examined by digital simulation in the pH range 1-6. The simulation was performed based on the proposed EC and ECEC mechanisms (for simplifying, the proton transfers processes are not included). In these mechanisms, E is electrochemical oxidation of MAP to MAP OX , and C is the addition reaction that happens after the electrooxidation process. In these mechanisms, the peak current ratio (I pC /I pA1 ) is a criterion for the chemical reaction rate between MAP OX and sulfinic ion nucleophiles.",
