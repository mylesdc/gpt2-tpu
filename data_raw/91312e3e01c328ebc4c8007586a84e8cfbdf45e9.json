They also demonstrate a degree of evolutionary divergence within SHFV that is roughly equivalent to the degree of divergence between other arterivirus species. The presence of two such highly divergent SHFV variants co-infecting a single individual represents a degree of within-host viral diversity that exceeds what has previously been reported for any arterivirus. These results expand our knowledge of the natural history and diversity of the arteriviruses and underscore the importance of wild primates as reservoirs for novel pathogens.",

Since then, sporadic epidemics have occurred in macaques, likely as a result of contact with, or iatrogenic transmission from, infected but asymptomatic captive African monkeys [2, 3, 4] . Viruses related to SHFV have not yet been found to infect humans, but the clinical manifestations of SHFV resemble those of other primate-associated hemorrhagic fever viruses significant for human health (e.g. Ebola, Marburg, Yellow fever), making SHFV of interest with respect to emerging infectious disease surveillance and biodefense [4, 5] . Although asymptomatic SHFV infections in captive patas monkeys (Erythrocebus patas), vervet monkeys (Cercopithecus aethiops), and baboons (Papio sp.) suggest that such species could be natural SHFV reservoirs [2, 3] , the virus has never, to our knowledge, been found in a primate in the wild.",

            "text": "SHFV is in the family Arteriviridae, which also contains equine arteritis virus (EAV), lactate dehydrogenase elevating virus of mice (LDV), and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) [6] . Similar to the other arteriviruses, SHFV has a positive-sense RNA genome approximately 15 kb in length, consisting of a short 59 untranslated region, two large open reading frames (ORFs 1a and 1b) encoding the replicase plus various nonstructural proteins, a number of smaller downstream ORFs encoding structural proteins, and a short 39 untranslated region [7] . However, SHFV is unusual compared to the other arteriviruses in that it contains three additional ORFs (2a, 2b, and 3) immediately downstream of the replicase-encoding ORFs, perhaps as the result of a gene duplication event [8] . As of the time of this writing, only one full SHFV genome was available in GenBank (accession number NC_003092), representing prototype strain LVR 42-0/M6941, which was isolated on MA-104 cells from a moribund rhesus macaque during the original SHFV outbreak in 1964 [9] . Because the genome organization of SHFV was determined from this single strain, and because this sequence was generated from an isolate obtained from a macaque after growth in cells derived from embryonic rhesus macaque kidney tissue, it is unclear whether the unusual 39 genomic architecture of SHFV is typical or whether it might be an artifact of passage in a non-natural host or in cultured cells.",

On February 5, 2010, a wild adult male red colobus in Kibale was captured as part of a larger study of primate ecology, health, and conservation. The animal was anesthetized with a combination of Ketamine (5.6 mg/kg) and Xylazine (1.7 mg/kg) administered intramuscularly using a variable-pressure air rifle (Pneudart, Inc, Williamsport, PA, USA). Blood was drawn from the femoral vein into an evacuated plasma collection tube (Becton, Dickinson and Company, Inc, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and kept cool until processing. The animal was given a reversal agent (Atipamezole, 0.6 mg/kg), and released after recovery back to its social group without incident. Blood was separated using centrifugation in a field laboratory and frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen for storage and transport to the United States. Samples were shipped in an IATA-approved dry shipper to the USA for further analysis at the Wisconsin National Primate Research Center.",

To determine the phylogenetic relationships of newly discovered SHFV variants to known arteriviruses, nucleotide sequences of homologous ORFs in SHFV, EAV, LDV, and PRRSV (1a, 1b, 2a, 2b, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, with reference to the EAV genome) were compiled from the literature, with strains chosen from available full-length genome sequences to represent the known within-species diversity of each virus. Non-overlapping coding regions were aligned using a codon-guided version of the MAFFT method [13] with poorly aligned sites removed using the Gblocks alignment cleaning method [15] implemented in the computer program TranslatorX [16] . Phylogenetic analyses were then conducted on concatenated, non-overlapping regions of aligned, cleaned ORFs, using first and second codon positions only, to avoid error associated with third-codon position saturation. Phylogenetic trees were constructed using the maximum likelihood method implemented in the computer program PAUP* 4.0 [17] . The substitution model used in the analysis was estimated using jModelTest [18] and was of the form GTR+I+C with the following parameters: nucleotide frequencies of A = 0.2386; C = 0.2413; G = 0.2633; T = 0.2568; substitution rates of AC = 2.5732, AG = 2.7382, AT = 1.4815, CG = 1.6751, CT = 2.1065, and GT = 1; I (proportion of invariant sites) = 0.1330; and C (gamma distribution of among-site rate variation) = 2.144, with 4 rate categories. Robustness of phylogenetic groupings was assessed in PAUP* using 1000 bootstrap replicates of the data [19] .

De novo assembly of singleton non-host reads resulted in a 15.5 kb contiguous sequence (contig) that aligned to the SHFV type strain LVR 42-0/M6941 (GenBank accession number NC_003092.1). A reference assembly against the 15.5 kb contig yielded 35,120 sequence reads with full coverage across the entire contig. Two additional contigs with lengths of 13 kb and 1.9 kb also aligned to the SHFV genome but were highly divergent from the initial 15.5 kb contig. The positions of these additional aligned contigs relative to the SHFV genome suggested that the two fragments might belong to the same viral variant. Using one step RT-PCR and 39 RACE, respectively, we were able to fill the gap between these two contigs and extend the 39 end of the contig to complete the terminal open reading frame (ORF9), yielding a new complete contig of 15.2 kb. A reference assembly against this 15.2 kb contig yielded 1,068 sequence reads with full coverage across the entire contig. Initial alignments indicated that both contigs covered all ORFs of the SHFV type strain and extended partially into the 39 and 59 untranslated regions. The 15.5 kb and the 15.2 kb contigs were designated SHFV-krc1 and SHFV-krc2, respectively, to indicate their origins in Kibale red colobus and to reflect nomenclature previously used to describe novel simian retroviruses in this same population of red colobus [20] .",

We caution, however, that phylogenetic diversity within the other arteriviruses may be underestimated due to small numbers of currently available full genome sequences. For example, divergent EAV strains have been documented [23, 24] but, at the time of this writing, full genomes of such EAV isolates were not available. Unfortunately, our attempts to align the available hypervariable partial ORF5 sequences of these divergent EAV strains with homologous regions from other arteriviruses failed due to low sequence similarity.

Kibale red colobus may simply harbor a very diverse population of SHFV variants. However, it is also possible that SHFV-krc1 or SHFV-krc2 may have been transmitted to this animal from another species. For example, red colobus in Kibale form polyspecific associations with other primates, most frequently with red-tailed guenons (Cercopithecus ascanius) but also with black-andwhite colobus (Colobus guereza), blue monkeys (Cercopithecus mitis), and grey-cheeked mangabeys (Lophocebus albigena) [25] .

The combination of random hexamer-primed reverse transcription and double-stranded cDNA synthesis used in this study obviated the need for PCR amplification to generate suitable amounts of DNA for pyrosequencing libraries. This method also prevented the potential introduction of amplification-induced error and template bias associated with whole genome amplification [26] . Despite marked divergence from each other and from type strain LVR 42-0/M694, SHFV-krc1 and SHFV-krc2 share the same 39 genomic architecture as the type strain, consisting of additional ORFs 2a, 2b, and 3, which are not present in the other arteriviruses ( Figure 1 ). Because our methods did not involve tissue culture, which can introduce genetic anomalies as viruses replicate in, and potentially adapt to, cells or cell lines derived from non-natural host species, we conclude that the unique 39 genomic architecture of SHFV in comparison to the other arteriviruses is authentic and characteristic of SHFV. Future studies of isolated viruses should help clarify the stability of SHFV in cell culture and should facilitate investigations of biological differences among SHFV variants, including their ability to be detected by available serologic diagnostics tests [27] . Finally, our results have implications for primate health and conservation. The animal sampled was apparently healthy at the time of capture and, as of the time of this writing, continues to behave normally within its social group. Preliminary data (unpublished) indicate that this particular animal is also infected with the recently discovered simian immunodeficiency virus SIVkrc [20] , and that other apparently healthy red colobus in the same location are infected with SHFV-krc. This evidence supports the idea that wild primates can harbor SHFV subclinically, although long-term field observations of infected and uninfected animals will be required to detect any negative effects of infection and co-infection with other viruses on host fitness. Nevertheless, our findings underscore that wild primates can be reservoirs for unknown pathogens of potential concern for global health, and that extreme care should therefore be taken when introducing primates into new environments. Indeed, we suggest that direct pyrosequencing or other similar technologies for broad viral screening might prove useful in settings such as zoos, primate colonies, sanctuaries, and primate reintroduction programs where asymptomatic carriers of novel viral pathogens might come into contact with clinically susceptible hosts.
