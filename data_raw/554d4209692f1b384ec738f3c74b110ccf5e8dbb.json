Here, using quantitative phosphoproteomics, we reveal the unique phosphoproteome dynamics that occur in the host cell within minutes of influenza A virus (IAV) infection. We uncover cellular kinases required for the observed signaling pattern and find that inhibition of selected candidates, such as the G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2), leads to decreased IAV replication. As GRK2 has emerged as drug target in heart disease, we focus on its role in IAV infection and show that it is required for viral uncoating. Replication of seasonal and pandemic IAVs is severely decreased by specific GRK2 inhibitors in primary human airway cultures and in mice. Our study reveals the IAV-induced changes to the cellular phosphoproteome and identifies GRK2 as crucial node of the kinase network that enables IAV replication.",

Cellular factors involved in viral replication have been proposed to be attractive targets for antiviral development [1] [2] [3] .

Coordinated early activation of signaling pathways has been shown to be important for viral entry [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] and identification of key kinases involved in this process could contribute to the development of new antivirals. Binding of IAV particles, by interaction of the viral hemagglutinin (HA) to exposed sialylated proteins on epithelial cells 14 , has been proposed to induce the formation of lipid raft-based signaling platforms, in which receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or c-Met, are activated 6 . Clustering of activated RTKs leads to their internalization in endocytic vesicles, in which the viral particles could be engulfed 15 . Downstream of this initial RTK-signaling, early activation of the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) has been shown to promote IAV endocytosis [5] [6] [7] and, together with the extracellular signal-regulated kinase ERK1/2, to enhance the activity of the vacuolar-type H + -ATPases (vATPases) 8, 16 , which are essential for endosomal acidification leading to viral fusion [17] [18] [19] . Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) has been proposed to establish a link between this PI3K activation and the cytoskeleton reorganization required for viral endosomal trafficking 9 and the activation of protein kinase C (PKC) has been shown to play a role in IAV trafficking through late endosomes 10, 11 . More recently, Ca 2+ signaling has also been implicated in both, clathrin-dependent and clathrin-independent IAV entry mechanisms via an intricate associated regulatory network 12 .",

We observed strong activation of EGFR at 5 and 15 min post infection (p.i.), and therefore selected these time points for our analysis (Supplementary Figure 1a ). For accurate quantification of phosphorylation dynamics, we performed five biological replicates in A549 cells subjected to triple isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) 20 , from which the peptides phosphorylated at serine or threonine residues were enriched, and identified and quantified by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) (Fig. 1a) . We used IAV A/WSN/33 grown in embryonated chicken eggs for our analysis to avoid contributions from cytokines, such as interferons, as these act mostly in a species-specific manner. In addition, we also performed a proteomic analysis for chicken proteins present in the virus stock and the allantoic fluid from mock-infected eggs that we used for our mock condition (Supplementary Data 1). We did not detect any chicken protein that was at least 2-fold more abundant compared to the mock, allowing us to attribute differences in phosphorylation to virus infection. We were able to detect >3000 different phosphosites per experimental condition, from around 2400 phosphopeptides belonging to about 1300 proteins (Supplementary Figure 1b, raw data in Supplementary Data 2) . As expected, the vast majority of the detected phosphosites were phospho-serine and -threonine modifications, and only few phospho-tyrosines. A total of 70% of the phosphosites were detected in more than one biological replicate with a good correlation between them (Supplementary Figure 1c, d) . Quantitative analysis performed using MaxQuant 21 revealed changes in phosphorylation of an important subset of phosphopeptides within minutes of virus addition, while the absolute peptide abundance, quantified from total extract digests, remained mostly unaltered. Using a cutoff value of 1.5-fold change (FC) compared to mock infected samples, 213 phosphosites were found to be differentially phosphorylated 5 min post-inoculation (Fig. 1b) , 133 of which were dephosphorylated and 80 showing an increase in phosphorylation. 15 min after the addition of virus, changes in phosphorylation were more pronounced, with 375 sites being differentially phosphorylated (Fig. 1c) , 257 dephosphorylated and 118 showing an increase in phosphorylation. These data reveal that different cellular signaling pathways are activated within minutes of IAV infection, possibly induced by virus binding to the cell surface.",

Proteins with a described function in MAPK signaling (adj. p value = 2.29e \u221208 (hypergeometric test)), endocytosis (adj. p value = 1.13e \u221206 (hypergeometric test)) and regulation of the actin cytoskeleton (adj. p value = 5.79e \u221206 (hypergeometric test)) were overrepresented among the proteins phosphorylated in response to infection. As these cellular functions are known to be required for IAV entry, this result validates our experimental approach [5] [6] [7] [8] 16, [23] [24] [25] [26] . Furthermore, proteins related to focal adhesions and tight junctions (adj. p value = 6.47e \u221203 (hypergeometric test)), thus far not described to be involved in the early stages of IAV infection, were found to be significantly enriched. Among them, integrins (ITGB4), actin-binding proteins such as parvins (PARVA) and filamins (FLNB), proteins related to actinmembrane attachment (PXN, EPB41L1, VAPA) and different cytoskeleton components (TLN1), which were not previously associated with viral entry, were phosphorylated within minutes of infection. We also generated a network to analyze how the differentially phosphorylated proteins are interconnected within the different pathways and identified a clear cross-talk between them (Fig. 1e) .",

            "text": "Kinase profiling reveals IAV-responsive kinases. As our main goal was to reveal novel drug targets for IAV, we next focused on the kinases activated in response to infection. To this aim, we developed a bioinformatics pipeline to identify cellular kinases that could be responsible for the phosphorylation of the IAVresponsive phosphosites in our data set. Our approach centres on the kinase predictions obtained from the Group-based Prediction System 3.0 (GPS 3.0) 27-29 including a redefined high stringency cutoff (see Methods and Supplementary Figure 2) . GPS 3.0 ranks the likelihood that a particular kinase or kinase family phosphorylates a given residue considering the amino acids surrounding the phosphorylation site. Putative kinases for the hyperphosphorylated sites at both 5 and 15 min post-infection (log 2 FC \u2265 0.5) were identified and the distribution of the top predicted IAV-responsive kinases was compared against the background of the kinases predicted for the total population of identified phosphopeptides (Fig. 2a) . Putative substrates for mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (MAP2K1/MEK1), MAP kinase-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 2 (MNK2, p value = 0.043 (Fisher's exact test)) and RP6KB1 (p value = 0.023 (Fisher's exact test)) were the top hits among the hyperphosphorylated peptides 5 min after IAV binding. Predicted substrates for cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1), CDK5 and polo-like kinase 2 (PLK2, p value = 0.003 (Fisher's exact test)) are significantly phosphorylated 15 min after the addition of the virus. Interestingly, G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2), p21 (RAC1) activated kinase 1 (PAK1), Rho-associated coiled- coil containing protein kinase 1 (ROCK1, p value = 0.003 (Fisher's exact test)) and unc-51 like kinase 3 (ULK3, p value = 0.002 (Fisher's exact test)) are predicted to be activated at both time-points analyzed. Some of these kinases, like MAPKs or MNKs (MAPK/ERK signaling) 7, 8, 16 , ROCK1 12,23 , or PAK1 13, 30 , have already been implicated in viral entry, and thus validate our analysis. However, we also revealed CDKs, GRK2 and ULK3 as novel kinases activated in early steps of IAV replication. Next, the amino acids adjacent to the hyperphosphorylated positions at 5 and at 15 min post-infection (log 2 FC \u2265 0.5) were analyzed to identify conserved sequences that could be linked to the recognition motifs for the predicted kinases. We identified four sequences enriched among the IAV-responsive phosphopeptides (Fig. 2b) . A proline (P) in position +1 is particularly overrepresented (39%) among the putative targets for CDKs and MAPK. In agreement with these results, this motif is part of the optimal recognition sequences proposed for CDKs and for ERK and MAPK families 31 , whose activation has been shown to be required for IAV entry [6] [7] [8] 16 . An arginine (R) in position \u22123 is also enriched among the IAV-responsive phosphopeptides (18%), especially among putative targets for PAK1, ROCK1 and RP6KB1. This particular feature is part of the optimal recognition sequence predicted for PKCs, PKA or ROCK1 31 , and these kinases have been linked to IAV entry into cells 10 Fig. 2 Kinase activation profiling reveals IAV-responsive kinases as potential drug targets. a Top kinases predicted to be involved in the differential phosphorylation of proteins at 5 and/or 15 min post IAV-infection are shown in color (light orange: predicted to be activated at 5 min p.i., red: predicted to be activated at 15 min p.i.; dark red: predicted to be activated at both time points) in the context of all cellular kinases (s significantly enriched hit, t trend towards significance, * top predicted kinase for which enrichment calculation is not possible, see Methods and Supplementary Fig. 3) . b Over-represented sequences in IAV-responsive peptides are shown and linked with numbers to the kinases identified in (a). c Effect of inhibitors against the identified IAVresponsive kinases on the replication of a Renilla-encoding virus. The efficiency of viral replication was determined by luminescence measurement (RLUs) in live cells every 2 h. The dotted line represents a 10-fold difference in viral replication with regard to DMSO-treated cells. Error bars represent standard deviation from three replicates a glutamic acid (E) in position +3 (22%) or a serine (S) in position +2 (16%) are likewise associated with IAV-responsive phosphosites among putative targets of PLK2, RP6KB1 or GRK2 in our analysis.",

Next, we evaluated whether viral replication could be reduced by targeting the in silico-identified IAV-responsive kinases with small molecular weight compound inhibitors (Fig. 2c) . We tested the effect of specific PAK1 (IPA-3), ROCK1 (Y-27632) and GRK2 (Methyl 5-[2-(5-nitro-2-furyl)vinyl]-2-furoate, GRK2i) 32 inhibitors on the replication of a luciferase-encoding reporter IAV. Together with ULK3, these are the kinases predicted to be activated by IAV at both time-points that were analyzed (Fig. 2a) . As inhibitors for ULK3 are not commercially available, ULK3 was excluded from the analysis. We also included a CDK inhibitor (AT7519) 33 because CDKs are key cellular kinases that have not been linked to early steps of IAV infection. Given that the MAPK pathway has been broadly implicated in viral entry [6] [7] [8] 16 and is among the top hits in our pathway enrichment analysis (Fig. 1d) , a specific ERK inhibitor (Ulixertinib) 34 was also included as positive control. Cytotoxicity of the different compounds in A549 cells was determined (Supplementary Figure 3a) and concentrations without deleterious effects were used for further experiments. As expected, the ERK inhibitor efficiently blocked virus replication in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2c ). PAK1 inhibition partially reduced viral replication, which is consistent with a previous report on the role of PAK1 in IAV infection 13 . We could not observe a significant effect upon ROCK1 targeting in our experimental system but both the CDK and GRK2 inhibitors efficiently blocked viral replication, confirming the prediction of our kinase activation profiling (Fig. 2c ). In these cases, the inhibition of viral replication was clearly observed at 4 h post-infection (hpi), suggesting that, as predicted by our phosphoproteomic data, both CDKs and GRK2 are required for an early step in the viral replication cycle.",

(Fig. 3a) . Each of the siRNAs reduced viral titers by 10-100fold, further supporting the role of GRK2 as a host factor required for IAV infection. Next, we performed similar experiments in siRNA-treated A549 cells using the human IAV strain A/Udorn/72 (H3N2) (Fig. 3b ) or the highly pathogenic avian strain A/FPV/Dobson/34 (H7N7) (Fig. 3c ). GRK2 depletion also inhibited replication of these viruses. Finally, to discard a cell-line-specific requirement, we also transfected siRNAs targeting GRK2 and the above described controls into MRC5 or Wi38 human lung fibroblasts, which were subsequently infected with A/WSN/33 (Supplementary Figure 3d , e). Although the virus was not able to replicate as efficiently as in A549 cells, depletion of GRK2 significantly impaired viral replication in both cell lines.",

As GRK2 was one of the top hits predicted to be responsible for the observed IAV-induced phosphorylation signature, we hypothesized that GRK2 was activated by IAV. Previous reports showed that differential phosphorylation regulates GRK2 activity [35] [36] [37] [38] and we thus speculated that the phosphorylation status of GRK2 would change in response to IAV infection. However, we had not detected phosphopeptides derived from GRK2 in our proteomic analysis, possibly suggesting activation of GRK2 by tyrosine phosphorylation. In order to assess the phosphorylation status of GRK2 in response to IAV we employed phosphate affinity polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 39 . This method makes use of a compound that binds to phosphate groups and thereby specifically slows the migration of phosphorylated proteins during gel electrophoresis, which enables visualization of differentially phosphorylated forms of a given protein. As EGF had been reported to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of GRK2, we validated the method by transfecting A549 cells with constructs encoding GRK2 and EGFR, treated cells with epidermal growth factor (EGF) for 5 or 15 min and performed phosphate affinity polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 35 . As control, we treated the lysates with lambda protein phosphatase (LPP). When cells were stimulated with EGF, we observed a stronger signal for the phosphorylated version of GRK2, which was not present when the samples had been treated with LPP ( Fig. 3d) . Importantly, we also observed the appearance of the phosphorylated form of GRK2 upon IAV infection ( Fig. 3e ) confirming our hypothesis that GRK2 is phosphorylated within minutes of infection.",

The translocation of GRK2 was also observed when using a purified stock of IAV (Supplementary Figure 3g) , allowing us to attribute GRK2 activation to viral particles and ruling out contributions from other allantoic fluid components.

From our results thus far, we hypothesized that the kinase activity of GRK2 is required for early steps of the viral replication cycle.

Addition of the compound together with the virus inoculum efficiently reduced the replication of a Renilla luciferase-encoding reporter IAV. Adding the inhibitor at 2 or 4 hpi reduced viral replication less efficiently, while addition of the inhibitor at later time points did not affect the progression of the infection. Furthermore, addition of the compound only during virus binding or during the first 1-3 h of infection, followed by a washing step and the replacement by inhibitor-free medium, was sufficient to block the replication of the reporter virus (Fig. 4b) .",

Addition of the inhibitor during the first 3 h of infection was sufficient to reduce viral production by more than 1000-fold, confirming the requirement for GRK2 activity during the early steps of the viral cycle. Next, we evaluated the amount of viral nucleoprotein (NP) within the cell nucleus 3 hpi as a direct measurement of the early infection progression. A549 cells were pre-treated for 1 h with GRK2i, subsequently infected with A/ WSN/33 at a high multiplicity of infection (MOI = 5 PFU/cell) for 3 h in the presence of the inhibitor and analyzed by confocal microscopy (Fig. 4d) . In control-treated cells, NP was clearly detected in the nucleus as a consequence of ongoing viral replication. However, both GRK2i and BafA1, which was used as positive control, efficiently blocked nuclear NP accumulation. cycloheximide in order to detect only incoming viral ribonucleoproteins (vRNPs), the nuclear accumulation of NP was severely impaired in the presence of GRK2i (Fig. 4e) , suggesting that the activity of the kinase is required before or during the nuclear import of parental vRNPs. We then tested whether GRK2 was required for virus internalization or endosomal trafficking. A549 cells were pretreated for 1 h with GRK2i or equivalent amounts of the solvent dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), prior to infection with A/WSN/33 for 30 min at an MOI = 25 PFU/cell. To quantify the amount of virions in early endosomes, we performed confocal immunofluorescence analysis of NP and the early endosome antigen 1 (EEA1) and measured the percentage of co-localization using Imaris software 40, 41 . No significant differences in co-localization of internalized virions with EEA1 were observed in cells treated with the inhibitor (Supplementary Figure 4b) , suggesting that GRK2 is not required for binding, internalization or early endosomal trafficking. Next, we characterized whether GRK2 function was necessary for efficient viral fusion. To do this, we generated IAV virus-like particles (VLPs) that contain HA and NA from the A/WSN/33 strain and harbor a beta-lactamase reporter protein fused to the influenza matrix protein-1 (BlaM1) 42 . Upon fusion of viral and endosomal membranes, BlaM1 gains access to the cytoplasm, where it cleaves the fluorogenic substrate CCF-2, which then shifts to a shorter fluorescent emission wavelength that can be detected by flow cytometry. Although GRK2 impairment can efficiently block nuclear accumulation of NP in MDCK cells 3 hpi at non-toxic concentrations of GRKi (Supplementary Figure 4c, d) , no differences in viral fusion were detected in the presence of the inhibitor (Supplementary Figure 4e) .",

We therefore evaluated the antiviral activity of both GRK2 inhibitors in primary human bronchial epithelial cells differentiated into pseudostratified human airway epithelial (HAE) cultures under \"air-liquid-interface\" (ALI) conditions 47 . Fully differentiated HAE cultures from different donors were pre-treated with inhibitors for 1 h and subsequently infected with human IAV strains A/Netherlands/602/2009 (pdmH1N1), A/Brisbane/59/07 (H1N1), A/HongKong/68 (H3N2) or A/Brisbane/10/07 (H3N2) for 4 h in the presence of the inhibitors (Fig. 5b ). Both compounds blocked nuclear accumulation of NP efficiently for all virus strains, with paroxetine being more potent. We then infected HAE cultures with the different strains of IAV and collected supernatants 16 and 24 hpi to quantify virus production by plaque assay (Fig. 5c-f ). Paroxetine reduced virus titers by 100 to 1000-fold for all strains tested, confirming that blocking GRK2 activity could be used to limit IAV infection in human lung epithelia. Finally, we tested whether chemical inhibition of GRK2 could reduce viral replication and severity of infection in mice. As no data were available for the stability and bioavailability of GRKi in vivo, we selected paroxetine, which had been used in mice before, for our experiments 46 . 9 week old C57BL/6 J mice were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 5 mg/kg paroxetine or an equivalent amount of solvent. At 24 h post treatment, mice were challenged with 10 PFU of a mouse-adapted A/Netherlands/602/2009 (pdmH1N1) or inoculated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) via the intranasal route. Paroxetine or solvent treatment was repeated on the day of infection and on days 1 (d1) and d2 post infection (pi). For one group of mice, weight loss and survival were monitored but no significant changes were observed between the paroxetine-treated group and the solvent control group (Supplementary Figure 6b, c) . For a second group of mice, virus titers on d2 and d4 pi were determined from snout and lung homogenates to track the progression of the infection in the upper (URT) and lower respiratory tract (LRT) (Fig. 5g, h) . No significant differences were observed in virus titers from d2 pi. However, paroxetine treatment decreased virus titers significantly in both organs on d4 pi. In summary, our results show that inhibition of GRK2 led to strongly reduced viral titers in primary human airway cultures and also limited viral replication in a mouse model. However, GRK2 inhibition could not protect mice from weight loss or death in a lethal challenge model. While further in vivo studies using more potent GRK2 inhibitors will be needed to fully assess the potential of GRK2 inhibition as therapeutic option, our results establish GRK2 as novel drug target candidate for influenza.",

Even though our approach was limited to the identification of phospho-serine and -threonine containing peptides and did not include phospho-tyrosines, we uncovered >200 infection-induced changes in the phosphorylation status of cellular proteins within minutes of virus addition.

            "text": "As our main goal was to uncover novel drug targets for influenza, we focused on the identification of kinases that could be responsible for the observed changes in phosphorylation. A similar analysis for phosphatases would be equally interesting but thus far, bioinformatic tools for phosphatase prediction are less well developed. We found GRK2, ULK3, ROCK1 and PAK1 predicted to be involved in phosphorylation events identified at both time points analyzed. While a role for ROCK1 and PAK1 in IAV entry has been proposed before 12, 13, 30 , GRK2 and ULK3 have not been implicated in influenza virus infections yet. ULK3 can interact with the ESCRTIII complex and functions in cytokinetic abscission. Specifically, ULK3 is required for delaying cell division if the chromosomes have not segregated yet 49 . With regard to viruses, ULK3 was found to be upregulated in cytomegalovirus infection but the functional relevance of this observation is unclear 50 . To our knowledge, no specific inhibitors of ULK3 have been developed yet and thus, the suitability of ULK3 as potential drug target for influenza is currently limited. In contrast, GRK2 is the target of intense research efforts. This kinase is best known for its role in G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling, where GRK2 is recruited to the receptor upon activation, phosphorylates the GPCR, which in turn leads to binding of beta-arrestin to the receptor. This impairs downstream signaling and thereby leads to rapid desensitization. Furthermore, beta-arrestin binding also triggers receptor internalization and subsequent lysosomal degradation 51 . Increased levels of GRK2 are therefore associated with a reduction in GPCR signaling and this is particularly well documented for betaadrenergic receptor signaling in heart tissue, where increased levels of GRK2 are linked with impaired cardiac contractility 51, 52 . Hence, GRK2 has emerged as promising drug target in heart disease and inhibitor development is under way 53, 54 , which could eventually enable drug repurposing for the treatment of influenza virus infections.",

As described above, beta-arrestin is the best-studied substrate of GRK2 but we did not detect any phosphopeptides derived from beta-arrestin in our proteomic analysis. Furthermore, data from a meta-analysis of several genome-wide RNAi screens for required host factors of IAV 48 suggest that beta-arrestin is not a required host factor for IAV, and therefore most likely does not mediate the proviral function of GRK2. Of note, GRK2 was recently described as key stimulator of histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) 36 , which in turn has been proposed to be recruited to viral fusion sites and enable efficient uncoating in a complex mechanism involving the aggresome processing machinery 43 . However, GRK2-mediated phosphorylation of HDAC6 has been shown to stimulate its \u03b1-tubulin deacetylase activity, which is not required for viral uncoating. In addition, no HDAC6-derived phosphopeptide was detected in our analysis suggesting that GRK2 does not exert its proviral role through HDAC6. As we also did not observe any changes in the phosphorylation status of the viral proteins M1, M2 and NP in the presence of a GRK2 inhibitor, we speculate that GRK2 supports the viral uncoating process by phosphorylating non-canonical cellular targets. Further characterization of the interplay between GRK2, the components of the aggresome system and the cellular cytoskeleton will help to reveal the molecular mechanism of IAV uncoating.",

            "text": "MaxQuant analysis. Data acquired on the Orbitrap Fusion were analyzed with MaxQuant v1.5.0.30 23 , searching a target-decoy database consisting of human (88,708 forward Uniprot entries) and influenza A virus (A/WSN/33, 9 forward Uniprot entries) sequences. As an additional control, a database containing chicken sequences (43, 340 forward Uniprot entries) was used for the identification of IAVinduced chicken proteins in our egg-grown stock. To identify contaminant proteins, the internal contaminant database of MaxQuant was used. Search parameters were: Cysteine carbamidomethylation as fixed modification, protein N-terminal acetylation and methionine oxidation and phosphorylation of serine, threonine and tyrosine as variable modifications; SILAC labeling (Arg10, Lys8, Arg6, Lys4) as heavy labels; enzyme trypsin/P; two missed cleavages were allowed; and a minimum of seven amino acids per identified peptide were required. The precursor ion mass tolerance was set to 7 ppm, and the fragment mass tolerance was set to 20 p.p.m. Peptide identifications were accepted until less than 1% of the reverse hits were retained in the list. The protein false discovery rate (FDR) was set to 1%. For each phosphopeptide in the data set, the median of the MaxQuant ratios for the different replicates was calculated and the data from both TiO 2 and Ti-IMAC based approaches were combined for further analysis. Kinase prediction. The kinase prediction is derived from high stringency scores calculated using the Group-based Prediction System 3.0 (GPS 3.0, http://gps. biocuckoo.org/online.php) [27] [28] [29] , which ranks the likelihood that a particular kinase or kinase family phosphorylates a given residue considering the amino acids surrounding the phosphorylation site. All predictions for the experimentally detected phosphorylation sites were ranked based on the difference between the site threshold and the site prediction score (Supplementary Figure 7) . In order to determine the selection parameters we would use, given that more than one kinase may be responsible for the phosphorylation of a given protein at a given position, we first worked on a subset of entries from Phospho.ELM (v.9.0, April 2015, http:// phospho.elm.eu.org/dataset.html). Briefly, we downloaded all abstracts (n = 1690) associated with all kinase-phosphosite pairs (rentrez 1.0.4) and selected those reported in the context of viral infection (n = 160 unique sites on 51 unique proteins, representing substrates of 12 major kinase groups, Supplementary Figure 2a) . We subsequently ran GPS 3.0 on the full sequences of these proteins and checked for conditions that allowed us to retrieve as many true positives per phosphosite Pi from all predictions for Pi (Supplementary Figure 2b , c) using the most stringent (2% false positive rate for serine/threonine kinases and 4% for tyrosine kinases) prediction threshold. The top five predictions in terms of the GPS-calculated score, which indicates the similarity of a detected phosphosite to a phosphosite in the gold standard Phospho.ELM; or the derived parameter Delta, defined as the difference between the GPS-calculated score and the GPS-provided cutoff per position, were found to include 70% of the true positives in this scenario and was chosen as the cutoff for the kinase-phosphosite pairs that we report. Top predicted kinases for the differentially phosphorylated sites at both 5 and 15 min post infection (log 2 FC \u2265 0.5) were considered as IAV-responsive kinases. The distribution of the top predicted kinases was then compared against the background of the total detected peptide population and enriched hits were identified. To determine if the enrichment for a particular kinase is significant, we performed a 1000-fold random selection of peptides from all peptides detected in our assay, where the number of peptides sampled per randomization is equal to the size of the hyperphosphorylated peptides at 5 or 15 min post infection (log 2 FC > 0.5 wrt mock). We subsequently compared the frequencies at which a top kinase is predicted for detected versus randomized conditions using Fisher's exact test. For a subset of the top predicted kinases (CDK1, CDK5, GRK2 and MAP2K1), significant enrichment cannot be established, given that their higher and more variable scores (\u00b5 CDK5,GRK2,CDK1,MAP2K1 = 17.34 + 5.33, \u00b5 other = 7.03 + 1.33) ensure their inclusion in the top calls for any phosphosite for which these kinases are predicted (Supplementary Figure 2c) . Others, including PAK1 and CBK1, tend towards enrichment (p value < 0.1 (Fisher's exact test) ) and, consequently, we cannot exclude their potential contribution to viral replication and included them in our analysis.
