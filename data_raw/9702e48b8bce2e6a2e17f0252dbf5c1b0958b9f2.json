            "text": "The study included 123 children divided into five groups according to infection agent and treatment protocol: Group I included those with MP infection without documented viral infection, treated with only macrolides; Group II included those with MP infection without documented viral infection, treated with a combination of macrolides and methylprednisolone; Group III included those with MP infection and documented viral infection, treated with only macrolides; Group IV included those with viral pneumonia without documented MP infection; Group V was the control group composed of admitted children without MP or a documented viral infection. These five groups were further subdivided into Groups A (including Groups I, III, IV, and V) and B (Group II) according to the responses to macrolide treatment. Concentrations of cytokines interleukin 6, interleukin 17, interleukin 18, and tumor necrosis factor\u03b1, and lactate dehydrogenase, and ferritin of all children were evaluated, and these levels were compared among the groups. Statistical comparisons were made using Kruskal Wallis test and Mann-Whitney U test. Results: Serum lactate dehydrogenase, interleukin 18, and ferritin concentrations were significantly higher in Group II than in Groups I, III, IV, and V and were significantly higher in Group B than in Group A. When the serum lactate dehydrogenase concentration was 350 IU/L or higher, the sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing refractory MP pneumonia were 73 and 80%, respectively. When the interleukin 18 level was 360 pg/mL or higher, the sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing refractory MP pneumonia were 93 and 70%, respectively. When the ferritin level was 230 pg/mL or higher, the sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing refractory MP pneumonia were 67 and 67%, respectively. Conclusion: These results suggest that serum lactate dehydrogenase, interleukin 18, and ferritin constitute the critical combination of biomarkers useful for predicting refractory MP pneumonia in children at hospital admission.",

            "text": "Pneumonia caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) is usually a benign, self-limited disease that can be treated effectively with macrolides. However, in some pediatric cases, it may develop into a severe, life-threatening infection, resistant to conventional macrolide treatment. [1, 2] Refractory MP pneumonia is characterized by prolonged fever accompanied by deteriorating radiological findings; it does not respond to appropriate macrolide therapy. Glucocorticoid may be effective and well tolerated these cases. [3] [4] [5] In MP pneumonia, the host's cell-mediated immunity plays a key role in the development of pulmonary lesions. Studies of immunocompromised hosts suggest that T cells play a role in the pathogenesis of mycoplasma infection. This is further supported by an apparent correlation between the development of a delayed hypersensitivity skin reaction to MP infection and the severity of disease. [6, 7] In some cases of MP pneumonia, an active host immune response promoting the release of cytokines and a T-helper (Th)-1-mediated immune response may contribute to severe pulmonary injury. Furthermore, MP pneumonia may be related to mononuclear cell infiltration into the airway, which is mainly composed of CD4+ T cells, contributing to substantial amplification of the immune response and subsequent injury to the lung parenchyma. [8] [9] [10] Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is an oxidoreductase that catalyzes the interconversion of pyruvate and lactate with concomitant interconversion of NADH and NAD+. It is occasionally termed as hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase, as it also catalyzes the oxidation of hydroxybutyrate. This cytoplasmic enzyme is present in all major organs, including the brain, kidneys, liver, myocardium, and lungs. When cell lysis occurs or cell membranes are damaged, LDH is released into the extracellular space. Therefore, LDH levels can be used as a surrogate marker for tissue breakdown. Previous studies have shown that serum LDH levels are increased in patients with refractory MP pneumonia, including children requiring steroid therapy. [5, [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] We propose that LDH can be used as an initial indicator of refractory MP pneumonia, although further studies are necessary to confirm the usefulness of serum LDH level as an indicator of severity and the need for steroid therapy in MP pneumonia.",

            "text": "Th17 cells play a potent proinflammatory role in the immune system by producing the signature cytokine interleukin 17 (IL-17) and, to a lesser extent, other inflammation mediators including interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1). In addition to their effector function in the defense against extracellular pathogens, Th17 cells promote many inflammatory conditions, including several lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In mice inoculated with live MP, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid increases both IL-17 concentration and neutrophil counts. Similarly, IL-17-linked signal activation has been observed in patients with MP pneumonia who showed significantly higher levels of serum IL-17 than those with streptococcal pneumonia. Since IL-17 has been found to play a role in the transition from innate immunity to adaptive immunity, these observations lead to the hypothesis that some components of the MP extract induce IL-17, which in turn causes the excessive inflammatory cell reactions observed in MP pneumonia patients. [14] [15] [16] [17] Interleukin 18 (IL-18) is a proinflammatory cytokine that promotes Th1 cytokine responses. Recent studies have revealed elevated levels of serum IL-18 in children with MP pneumonia; the levels rose during the acute phase of the infection. [18, 19] Ferritin is induced by activated macrophages, which produce TNF-\u03b1. In the early stages of infection, phagocytic cells are stimulated to synthetize and release cytokines, which in turn stimulate the synthesis of ferritin. Increased serum levels of ferritin exert an immunosuppressive effect through the inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation. Excess ferritin also reflects increased levels of TNF-\u03b1, an important apoptotic factor, and of cytotoxic markers such as aspartate aminotransferase, LDH, and creatine kinase, which can indicate increased apoptosis. [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] The mechanisms underlying the effect of steroids on MP pneumonia remain unknown. The rapid improvement of clinical symptoms and pulmonary lesions following steroid administration suggests that an increase in the related active cytokines and the resultant immunological dysregulation may play a crucial role. Recent evidence indicates that a pathogenesis similar to that of MP is responsible for the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome and multi-organ failure in severe viral infections such as severe acute respiratory syndrome. [15, 16] These viral diseases share some common laboratory findings, such as high serum levels of ferritin and LDH, similar to those we observed in patients with refractory MP pneumonia. [15] [16] [17] [18] 20] Accumulated evidence has shown that high-dose corticosteroids are effective in patients with MP infections. Combination therapy with macrolides and systemic steroids is more effective in reducing MP-induced pulmonary inflammation than use of either agent alone. These data lend support to clinical observations in a murine model that showed the addition of systemic steroids to antimicrobials may aid in the treatment of severe MP infections. The specific and comparative effects of treatment with macrolides, systemic steroids, or their combination in patients with MP respiratory tract infections have not been fully investigated, and the effects of systemic steroids on infection-induced airway inflammation and airway function are not completely understood, particularly as they relate to infectious asthma. [14-16, 20, 21] It remains to be investigated whether refractory and common MP pneumonia differ in their responses to macrolides. Therefore, the present study aims to investigate the cytokines related to each response mechanism and to identify the initial biomarkers that may distinguish common and refractory MP pneumonia at hospital admission.",

Rather than using the classic particle agglutination test, an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Vircell, Granada, Spain) was used to identify MP as the causative organism of pneumonia. The antigen, composed of an extract of inactivated MP, was bound to the solid phase and incubated with diluted patient serum samples that blocked the IgG antibodies while the specific IgM proteins were bound to the antigen. After washing to eliminate unreacted proteins, samples were incubated with a conjugate consisting of anti-human IgM monoclonal antibodies and peroxidase. Conjugates that did not react were eliminated, and a peroxidase substrate was added. The blue color that developed was proportional to the concentration of specific antibodies present in the test serum. The results were expressed as an index (ratio between the optical density of the test sample and that of the cut-off value) that could be used as a quantitative measure, as it was proportional to the amount of specific IgM present. The test serum was considered positive when the ratio was > 1.1.",

After 72 h, the patients were checked for reduction of fever, cough, and crackles on the lung, as well as improvement of radiological findings. If there was no improvement, the patient was considered to have refractory MP pneumonia. Although there is no exact definition of refractory MP pneumonia at present, guidelines and some studies define refractory MP pneumonia as no improvement in clinical and laboratory findings after 7 days of macrolides treatment. [22] The detection of treatment failure of antibiotics is mostly based on objective clinical criteria, but also on the less well-defined subjective decisions of the treating physicians. Assessment of response should be performed early enough to allow successful rescue therapy, but not too early, to allow evidence of clinical response. The time to an antibiotic response depends on the site of infection, the pathogen and the patient's immunological status, and different symptoms and signs may require different time points for evaluation, but usually 48 to 72 h were need for proper treatment. Therefore, there was defined 72 h as a standard of diagnosing refractory MP pneumonia in this study.

            "text": "MP infections occur annually worldwide; a recent MP epidemic occurred in 2015. The infections typically begin to spread during the autumn and remain for several months. The MP infection starts with the adherence of the bacteria to a host cell, which triggers the diseaserelated symptoms. The cytokines affected by the host immune response further contribute to the symptoms. The first-line antibiotic therapy for MP pneumonia is macrolide antibiotics. However, the number of pediatric patients with macrolide-refractory MP pneumonia increased noticeably in Korea when MP pneumonia was prevalent in 2015. Defining refractory MP is difficult, because few studies about the disease have been published. Although many studies are now underway, consensus about the treatment protocol for refractory MP has yet to be reached.",
