            "text": "Viruses that generate capped RNA lacking 29O methylation on the first ribose are severely affected by the antiviral activity of Type I interferons. We used proteome-wide affinity purification coupled to mass spectrometry to identify human and mouse proteins specifically binding to capped RNA with different methylation states. This analysis, complemented with functional validation experiments, revealed that IFIT1 is the sole interferon-induced protein displaying higher affinity for unmethylated than for methylated capped RNA. IFIT1 tethers a species-specific protein complex consisting of other IFITs to RNA. Pulsed stable isotope labelling with amino acids in cell culture coupled to mass spectrometry as well as in vitro competition assays indicate that IFIT1 sequesters 29O-unmethylated capped RNA and thereby impairs binding of eukaryotic translation initiation factors to 29O-unmethylated RNA template, which results in inhibition of translation. The specificity of IFIT1 for 29O-unmethylated RNA serves as potent antiviral mechanism against viruses lacking 29O-methyltransferase activity and at the same time allows unperturbed progression of the antiviral program in infected cells.",

            "text": "Effective control of viral infection by host organisms requires sensing of pathogens and activation of appropriate defence mechanisms [1] [2] [3] . One component commonly sensed by the host is viral genetic material, whether DNA delivered to the cytoplasm through viral infection or viral RNA bearing motifs not commonly found on eukaryotic RNAs [4, 5] . Most cellular cytoplasmic RNAs are single-stranded, and bear a 59monophosphate (rRNAs and tRNAs), or an N7 methylated guanosine cap (mRNAs) linked via a 59-to-59 triphosphate bridge to the first base. In higher eukaryotes, mRNA is further methylated at the 29O position of the first ribose [6, 7] . Viruses, in contrast, can form long double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and generate RNAs bearing 59triphosphosphates (PPP-RNA) or RNAs lacking methylation [8] [9] [10] . All these distinct features of viral as opposed to cellular RNAs have been shown to activate the innate immune system and elicit synthesis of antiviral cytokines including Type I interferons (IFN-a/b), which ultimately restrict virus growth [11] [12] [13] [14] . Among the proteins that sense viral RNA and are linked to IFN-a/b synthesis are retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (Mda-5), which form the family of RIG-like receptors (RLRs) [5] . A further set of host proteins appears to bind virus-derived RNAs to directly inhibit virus production [8] . Several of these proteins are highly expressed upon stimulation of cells with cytokines like IFN-a/ b and their antiviral effects become apparent only after binding to virus-derived nucleic acid. Prominent examples for such proteins are dsRNA binding proteins such as dsRNA-activated protein kinase R and 29-59 oligoadenylate synthetase, and proteins that bind PPP-RNA, like interferon-induced proteins with tetratricopeptide repeats (IFIT) 1 and -5 [3, 15, 16] . Little is known about the repertoire of cellular proteins that recognise unmethylated cap structures, although replication of viruses with inactive RNA 29O methyltransferase is strongly inhibited by IFN-a/b in vitro and in vivo [11, 15] . Some of this antiviral activity has been genetically linked to Ifit1 and -2 in mice [17] [18] [19] . Here, we used an unbiased mass-spectrometrybased approach to identify cellular proteins that bind to 59 unmethylated and methylated capped RNA, and explored their contribution to antiviral host responses.",

            "text": "To identify proteins that interact with 59 capped RNA we used a proteomics approach based on affinity purification and mass spectrometry (AP-MS) [16] . RNA bearing terminal 59 hydroxyl (OH-RNA), 59 triphosphate (PPP-RNA), an unmethylated cap (CAP-RNA), a guanosine-N7 methylated cap (CAP0-RNA), or a guanosine-N7 methylated cap and a ribose-29O methylated first nucleotide (CAP1-RNA) was coupled to agarose beads. The beads were then incubated with lysates of na\u00efve HeLa cells or HeLa cells treated with IFN-a to increase the abundance of antiviral proteins (Fig. 1a, Fig. S1 ). By employing liquid-chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) followed by quantitative interaction proteomics analysis, we identified 528 proteins that interacted with unmodified or RNA-coated beads (Fig. S2a , Table  S1 ). While a large number of proteins were equally well represented in the bound fractions obtained with all RNAs (Fig.  S2a) , 68 proteins were found to be significantly enriched in samples recovered with 59modified RNA compared to OH-RNA (Fig. S2b ). As expected, the PPP-RNA binding proteins RIG-I (DDX-58), the IFIT1, -2, -3 complex and IFIT5 were enriched in PPP-RNA affinity purifications of IFN-a-treated HeLa cell lysate (Fig. 1b) , validating the approach and confirming previous data [16] . Using unmethylated CAP-RNA as bait, we significantly enriched for proteins known to associate with cellular capped RNA (12 of 16 proteins) (Fig. 1c, Fig. S2b , Table S1 ). However, an important feature of cellular mRNAs is methylation on the N7 position of the guanosine cap and the ribose-29O position of the first nucleotide (CAP1). N7 methylation is known to increase the affinity of the cap structure for proteins such as EIF4E and other cap-binding proteins [6, 7] . A methylation-dependent increase in protein binding was also evident in our AP-MS analysis when unmethylated CAP-RNA and methylated CAP1-RNA were used as baits (16 vs. 27 identified proteins), as the latter captured a higher number of significantly enriched proteins and, overall, these were enriched to a greater degree, as measured by label-free quantification ( Fig. 1c-d , Table S1 ). Notably, we identified IFIT1, -2 and -3 among the uncharacterised CAP-RNA binding proteins, suggesting that the IFIT complex binds to RNA in a capdependent manner (Fig. 1c) . IFIT5, which shows 57.2% aminoacid sequence identity and 75.6% similarity to IFIT1 and has recently been shown to form a tight binding pocket that specifically accommodates PPP-RNA [20] , was not detected in fractions that bound capped RNA. When we compared our AP-MS dataset with transcriptome data of interferon-stimulated cells [21] , IFITs were the only interferon-induced proteins found to be specifically enriched in CAP-RNA purifications, suggesting a predominant role of IFITs in innate immune responses directed against CAP-RNA (Fig. 1c, Fig. S2b ). To analyse whether the set of proteins that binds to 59modified RNA is conserved in other species, we performed the same AP-MS analysis on lysates of na\u00efve and IFN-a-treated mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) (Fig. S3a , b, Table S2) . Surprisingly, although PPP-RNA specifically enriched for Ifit1, the abundance of Ifit2 and Ifit3 was not increased (Fig. 1e ). Instead we found enrichment of Ifit1c (also known as Gm14446), an uncharacterised IFIT protein that is strongly induced by IFN-a/b or virus infection (Fig. S4) , suggesting that the architecture of the murine IFIT complex differs from that of its human counterpart. Significant enrichment for Ifit1 and Ifit1c could also be achieved with unmethylated CAP-RNA, but not with methylated CAP1-RNA, despite the fact that the latter bait captured more proteins with higher enrichment scores (Fig. 1f, g) . We concluded from these analyses that, in both human and mouse, the IFIT complex is the only IFN-induced component that shows significant affinity for capped RNA.",

Remarkably, only human and murine IFIT1 were detected when CAP-RNA was used as bait (Fig. 2a, b) , suggesting that IFIT1 mediates binding of the IFIT complex to CAP-RNA. Consistent with the MS analysis, IFIT5 exclusively bound to PPP-RNA but not to CAP-RNA. To exclude contribution of cellular factors to the interaction between IFIT1 and CAP-RNA we used recombinant human IFIT proteins for RNA precipitations which confirmed a direct interaction of IFIT1 with capped RNA (Fig. 2c) . A structure-based modelling approach using IFIT5 [20] as template suggested that the RNA-binding cavity of IFIT1 is ,700 \u00c5 3 larger than that of IFIT5 (Fig. S5 ) -implying that IFIT1 has slightly different RNA-binding properties. However, a lysine at position 151 and an arginine at position 255 of IFIT1, two residues involved in binding the terminal 59 triphosphate group on PPP-RNA by IFIT5 and IFIT1 [20] , were also required for binding of IFIT1 to capped RNA (Fig. 2d) , indicating an overall similar mode of binding.",

Viruses unable to methylate their RNA at the 29O position of the cap and viruses generating uncapped RNA with 59 triphosphate groups are inhibited by an antiviral complex of different IFIT proteins. How IFIT proteins restrict viruses lacking 29O methylation at the RNA cap remained unclear. We used a mass spectrometry-based approach to identify proteins binding to capped RNA with different methylation states. We found that IFIT1 directly binds to capped RNA and that this binding was dependent on the methylation state of the cap. Having identified IFIT1 as being central for recognition of 29O-unmethylated viral RNA we further examined the mode of action of IFITs in vitro and in vivo. Our experiments clearly show that the antiviral mechanism of IFIT1 is based on sequestration of viral RNA lacking cap 29O methylation, thereby selectively preventing translation of viral RNA. Our data establish IFIT1 as a general sensor for RNA 59 end structures and provide an important missing link in our understanding of the antiviral activity of IFIT proteins. ) was coupled to streptavidin beads, and incubated with lysates obtained from cells that had been left untreated or treated with 1000 U/ml IFN-a for 16 h.

The most notable exceptions were IFITs and the cellular 29O-methyltransferase FTSJD2, both of which clearly favoured CAP-RNA (Fig. 3a , Fig. S2c and Fig. 1 c, d and f, g). We confirmed the MS data by a series of RNA precipitations followed by western blotting for endogenous proteins. Proteins associating to RNA in a 59 independent manner, such as ILF3, precipitated similarly well regardless of the RNA used (Fig. 3b) . Cap N7 methylation increased the association of EIF4E to RNA and methylation of the 29O position did not impair precipitation efficiency. In accordance with the MS results, IFIT1 bound well to unmethylated CAP-RNA and CAP0-RNA (N7 methylated cap) but revealed reduced binding to CAP1-RNA (N7 methylated cap and 29O methylated first ribos).",

The unmethylated CAP-RNA bait captured more human or murine IFIT1 than either of the methylated RNAs (Fig. 3c) . Furthermore, the analysis suggested that N7 methylation on the cap and 29O methylation of the first ribose both contributed to the reduced binding of IFIT1 to RNA. Similarly, the precipitation efficiency of recombinant human and murine IFIT1 was reduced when capped in vitro transcribed RNAs were enzymatically methylated at the N7 and 29O position (Fig. 3d ) or when chemically synthesised RNAs with the same modifications were used (Fig. 3e) . This was in contrast to EIF4E that showed prominent binding when CAP0-or CAP1-RNA was used (Fig. 3d , e). Collectively, these data suggest that human and murine IFIT1 have the capability to directly sense the methylation state of capped RNA.",

            "text": "Having established that IFIT1 binds directly to capped RNA and that methylation on the 29O position of the first ribose markedly reduces binding, we tested the impact of IFIT1 on virus replication. Probably as a result of evolutionary pressure, most viruses that infect higher eukaryotes have evolved mechanisms to generate RNA that is methylated on both the N7 position of the guanosine cap and the 29O position of the first ribose [9] . We therefore used wild-type human coronavirus (HCoV) 229E (229E-WT), which generates CAP1-RNA, and a mutant variant that has a single amino acid substitution (D129A) in the viral 29O methyltransferase that is part of non-structural protein 16 (229E-DA), and consequently only produces CAP0-RNA [11] . IFN-atreated HeLa cells infected with the 229E-DA mutant expressed significantly reduced levels of viral RNA and protein relative to those exposed to 229E-WT (Fig. 4a, b) . Moreover, this effect was strictly dependent on IFIT1, since the two viruses replicated equally well in HeLa cells treated with siRNA against IFIT1 (Fig. 4a, b) . Similar effects were observed in an analogous mouse model. Thus, when IFN-a treated macrophages (MWs) from C57BL/6 (Ifit +/+ ) mice were infected with a wild-type murine coronavirus (mouse hepatitis virus strain A59; MHV-WT) and a mutant strain carrying the equivalent amino acid substitution (D130A) in its 29O methyltransferase [11, 17] (MHV-DA), the latter produced 100-fold less viral RNA and comparably reduced levels of viral protein (Fig. 4c, d) . In contrast, when Ifit1-deficient MWs were infected, no significant virus-dependent differences were observed, again pointing to a critical role for Ifit1 in restricting replication of MHV-DA. Note that the presence of Ifit1 itself did not increase IFN-a/b production (Fig. S6) , suggesting a direct antiviral effect of Ifit1. We next assessed the impact of Ifit1 on virus growth in vivo. MHV-WT grew to high titres in the spleens of infected Ifit1 +/+ mice, whereas no viral replication could be detected upon infection with MHV-DA (Fig. 4e ). In agreement with the in vitro data, growth of MHV-DA was partially restored in Ifit1-deficient animals. These data suggest that IFIT1 has a central role in restraining the growth of 29O methyltransferase-deficient coronaviruses in vitro and in vivo, which is compatible with the greater affinity of IFIT1 for non-29O-methylated RNA cap structures. The data further imply that this role is conserved in mouse and human.",

The presence of a 59 cap regulates mRNA export from the nucleus, protects RNAs from degradation and is necessary for efficient translation [7, 22] . An involvement of IFIT1 in nuclear-cytoplasmic transport is unlikely, given the exclusively cytoplasmic localisation of IFIT proteins and their negative effect on coronaviruses, which replicate in the cytoplasm. We therefore measured the stability of the RNAs generated by MHV-WT or MHV-DA in MWs that had been stimulated with IFN-a. Since MHV-WT replicates significantly better than the mutant virus, we blocked virus replication by adding cycloheximide (CHX) shortly after infecting MWs with the two viruses (Fig. 5a ). CHX inhibits de novo synthesis of the viral polymerase, a prerequisite for transcription of viral RNA and thereby allows to normalise for viral transcripts in coronavirus infected cells. The abundance of viral transcripts 4 h and 8 h after infection was indistinguishable in CHX treated cells infected with MHV-WT and MHV-DA ( Fig. 5b) , suggesting that 29O methylation of the first ribose does not affect the stability of the viral RNA within the timeframe of this experiment.",

To assess the global impact of Ifit1 on the translation machinery, we used pulsed stable isotope labelling in cell culture (SILAC) [23] . In pulsed SILAC, unlabelled cells are transferred to SILAC growth medium containing 13 C-and 15 N-labelled arginine (Arg10) and lysine (Lys8). Newly synthesized proteins incorporate the heavy label and pre-existing proteins remain in the light form, which allows to measure relative changes in the translation of individual proteins, regardless of the absolute amount of RNA present. We pulsed Ifit1 +/+ and Ifit1 2/2 MWs infected for 5K h with either MHV-WT or MHV-DA for 2 h with SILAC medium (Fig. 5c ) and analysed infected cells by whole-proteome shotgun LC-MS/MS. We could reliably quantify 721 proteins in terms of heavy/light ratios in all three biological replicates tested. Heavy/ light ratios of cellular proteins were comparable in Ifit1 +/+ and Ifit1 2/2 MWs, irrespective of the virus used for infection (Fig. 5d , boxes), suggesting that neither the presence of Ifit1 nor infection with MHV-DA affected the overall rate of translation in the cells. The expression profiles of individual proteins known to be important in innate immune responses against viruses, such as the pattern recognition receptor RIG-I (DDX58), signalling molecules (STAT1, -2, -3), interferon-induced proteins (Ifi205b, Ifi35, Gvin1) and components of the major histocompatibility complex (H2-K1, H2-D1, Cd74), were similar in both cell types infected with either virus (Fig. S7) . However, translation of viral nucleocapsid and membrane proteins was selectively reduced in Ifit1 +/+ MWs infected with MHV-DA ( Fig. 5d and Fig. S7 ).",

(e) Binding of recombinant His-tagged hIFIT1 and EIF4E to chemically synthesized, biotinylated RNA oligomers. Synthetic triphosphorylated RNAs with (CAP1) or without (CAP0) 29O-methyl group on the first ribose were capped in vitro using recombinant vaccinia virus capping enzyme (see Materials and Methods). As control we used a synthetic RNA harbouring a 59 hydroxyl group (OH). Synthetic RNAs were coupled to beads, incubated with recombinant proteins and bound proteins detected by western blotting. Input shows 1/10 th of the amount incubated with beads. doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1003663.g003 methylated cap structures [7, 22] . Therefore, we tested whether IFIT1 could compete with EIF4E for binding to RNA template. We coupled limiting amounts of unmethylated CAP-RNA, N7methylated CAP0-RNA and fully methylated CAP1-RNA to beads and tested whether the binding ability of recombinant EIF4E is altered by the presence of recombinant IFIT1. When we used CAP-RNA or CAP0-RNA, EIF4E binding to the beads was reduced by addition of IFIT1, suggesting that the two proteins compete for the RNA target (Fig. 6a) . In contrast, when methylated CAP1-RNA was used the amount of EIF4E recovered was not affected by the presence of IFIT1. Competition between Eif4e and Ifit1 for capped RNA was also seen when total lysates of IFN-a-stimulated MEFs were used as inputs for experiments. Unmethylated CAP-RNA captured considerably more Eif4e from lysates of IFN-a treated Ifit1 2/2 MEFs than from lysates of Ifit1 +/+ MEFs (Fig. 6b) . This difference disappeared when methylated CAP1-RNA was used as bait (Fig. 6b) . We therefore conclude that IFIT1 competes with cellular translation initiation factors for mRNA, thereby selectively regulating translation based on the 59 methylation status of the RNA templates present (Fig. 6c ).",

            "text": "We previously identified IFIT1 as a nucleic acid-binding protein that recognises the 59triphosphosphate present on genomes and transcripts of most negative-strand RNA viruses [16] . Here we show that, in addition, IFIT1 binds mRNAs that lack 29O methylation on the first ribose, such as those produced by RNA viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm and are deficient in RNA cap-specific ribose-29-O methyltransferase activity. This suggests that IFIT1 has a unique ability to recognize 59 RNA modifications that are present on viral nucleic acids. Co-purification experiments with human IFIT proteins clearly show formation of a multiprotein complex comprising IFIT1, -2 and -3. Overexpression of single IFIT proteins, including IFIT1, only marginally affects viral growth [16, 17] , suggesting that the cooperative action of IFIT proteins is required for full antiviral action. This is supported by loss-of-function experiments in cell culture and in vivo that show a requirement for Ifit2, which by itself does not bind CAP-RNA, to restrict viruses lacking 29O methyltransferase activity [17, 18] . IFIT2 is known to bind to components of the cytoskeleton [24] , which could allow intracellular trafficking of the IFIT complex to its sites of action. While some IFITs possess conserved biological activities in different species, e.g. human and murine IFIT1 which bind to PPP-RNA and unmethylated CAP-RNA, others appear to have evolved in a species-specific manner. We showed here that the yet uncharacterised murine interferon-induced Ifit1c binds to RNA-coated beads in an Ifit1-dependent manner, and we therefore propose that a corresponding Ifit complex with a different protein composition exists in mice.",

In this context it is of interest to note that crystallographic analysis indicates that PPP-RNA binding to IFIT5, which shows high similarity to IFIT1, occurs in a fashion that is reminiscent of CAP-RNA binding by cap-binding proteins, in that the first two nucleotides are stacked by an aromatic phenylalanine [20] . However, the higher affinity of IFIT1 for unmethylated relative to fully methylated capped RNA is unusual among cellular Figure 6 . Competition between IFIT1 and translation factor EIF4E for mRNA templates. (a) Recovery of recombinant human EIF4E based on RNA affinity binding in the presence or absence of IFIT1. Streptavidin beads were coupled to 250 ng of the indicated RNA and mixed with 5 mg of recombinant His-tagged hIFIT1 and/or His-tagged EIF4E, as indicated. Bound proteins were analysed by western blotting with antibodies directed against the His-tag. (b) As in (a), except that RNA-coated beads were incubated with lysates of interferon-treated Ifit1 +/+ and Ifit1 2/2 mouse embryo fibroblasts. Bound proteins were analysed by western blotting with antibodies directed against murine Eif4e and mIfit1. (c) Proposed model for IFIT1mediated translational inhibition of 29O-unmethylated viral RNA. Capped and 29O-methylated cellular and viral RNA is bound by EIF4E to initiate translation. Viral mRNA lacking 29O methylation at the first ribose is recognized by IFIT1 which prevents binding of cellular factors required for efficient translation. The model is based on data presented here and elsewhere [16, 17, 19, 20] . doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1003663.g006 proteins since 59 methylation has so far been reported to increase the affinity of cellular proteins for RNA [7] , a notion clearly supported by our RNA AP-MS data. Like its specific antiviral activity, this property of IFIT1 may only become apparent during infections with viruses that produce non-methylated RNA 59 ends [25, 26] . We propose that IFIT1 acts as a molecular switch that allows selective translation based on the 59 methylation state of the mRNA. The phenomenon of translational control by IFIT1 based on its differential affinity for the capped RNA is reminiscent of the 4E homologous protein (4EHP) in Drosophila and mice, which has been found to control translation by competing with EIF4E for the RNA cap structure, thereby regulating development-specific gene expression [27, 28] . Similarly, in our hands, IFIT1 does not associate directly with the translation machinery ( [16] and data not shown), which again suggests that it perturbs translation through sequestration of viral RNA. Such a model is consistent with the high expression levels of IFIT proteins resulting from infections with viruses or treatment with IFN-a/b.",

            "text": "Rather than mediating general inhibition of translation, IFIT1 shows high selectivity for mRNAs that lack 59 methylation. This is supported by pulsed SILAC experiments showing specific, IFIT1dependent inhibition of translation of capped RNAs lacking 29O methylation at the first ribose, such as those generated by MHV and HCoV mutants expressing inactive 29O methyltransferase. Lower eukaryotes and viruses that infect them lack 29O methylated CAP RNA [29] [30] [31] , and the latter should be susceptible to the antiviral activity of IFITs. Consequently, the IFIT defence system is likely to contribute to a species barrier that puts selective pressure on viruses to generate 59 methylated RNA. Our data provide a mechanistic rationale for why most viruses make considerable effort and dedicate part of their coding capacity to produce genomic and subgenomic RNAs with 59-terminal ends that perfectly mimic those of cellular mRNAs, including fully methylated 59-cap structures [9, [31] [32] [33] . Other viruses have evolved specific mechanisms to hide their uncapped/unmethylated 59 ends, for example, by covalent binding of viral proteins to the 59 end of viral RNAs and use of alternative strategies for translation initiation, thereby escaping IFIT1-based surveillance, which is centred on RNA 59 end structures. Despite these viral strategies to generate host-like mRNAs, IFIT1 remains active against viruses that generate 59 triphosphate RNA, most likely through translation-independent mechanisms. The ability of IFIT1 to target viral RNAs selectively allows the cell to specifically fight virus infections while pursuing an antiviral program aimed at destroying the intruding pathogen.",

For western blot analysis we used horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-coupled antibodies specific for actin (Santa Cruz; sc-47778), the His-tag (Santa Cruz; sc-8036) or the c-Myctag (Roche; 1667149), and HRP-coupled secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch). All cell lines used (293T, HeLa, Vero-E6, Huh7, L929, 17Clone1, and Ifit1 +/+ and Ifit1 2/2 mouse embryonic fibroblasts) were described previously [11, 16] , and were maintained in DMEM (PAA Laboratories) containing 10% fetal calf serum (PAA Laboratories) and antibiotics (100 U/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin). DMEM medium containing antibiotics, 10 mM L-glutamine, 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum (PAA Laboratories) and 84 mg/L 13 C 6 15 N 4 L-arginine and 146 mg/L 13 C 6 15 N 2 lysine (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) was used for SILAC experiments. Murine bone marrow-derived macrophages were generated in vitro by cultivating bone marrow from mouse femur and tibia in DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 5% (v/v) horse serum, 10 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 10 mM L-glutamine and 20% (v/v) L929 cell-conditioned medium (containing macrophage colony-stimulating factor) for 6 days. Reagents for transfection with plasmid DNA (Nanofectin) or siRNA duplexes (siRNA Prime) were obtained from PAA Laboratories.

In each case, one representative experiment of three is shown, with means 6SD after normalization to the TATA-binding protein (TBP) mRNA. (b) Heatmap of selected proteins identified in RNA affinity purifications from cell lysates of Ifit1 +/+ and Ifit1 2/2 MEFs. The plot shows the means of log-transformed label-free quantitation protein intensities in rainbow colours (see colour scale). (c) Alignment of murine and human IFIT proteins using ClustalW. (d) Matrix showing amino acid similarity (based on ClustalW alignment) of all murine and human IFIT proteins. Percent similarity is indicated as color coded from white to red, and the exact similarity is shown within each element of the matrix. (TIF) Figure S5 Comparison of the RNA binding cavities of IFIT5 and IFIT1. Sections of surface representations of the solvent-accessible surfaces of IFIT5 (top) and IFIT1 (bottom) are shown, with PPP-RNA bound as in IFIT5 (stick representation, superimposed on IFIT1), and the corresponding cavity volumes V calculated as described in Materials and Methods. In our calcuations, the main RNA-binding cavity in IFIT5 has volume of 11881 \u00c5 3 . The calculated volume of the corresponding cavity of the modelled IFIT1, at 12627 \u00c5 3 , is about 700 \u00c5 3 larger. (TIF) Figure S6 Induction of interferon-b in wild-type and Ifit1-deficient mouse cells. Interferon-stimulated bone marrow-derived macrophages (MWs) from C57/BL6 (Ifit1 +/+ ) or Ifit1deficient (Ifit1 2/2 ) mice were left untreated, or infected with wildtype MHV (WT), 29O-methyltransferase-deficient MHV (DA), or Sendai virus (SeV). Twelve hours later total RNA was harvested and analysed by quantitative RT-PCR for interferon b (IFN-b) mRNA. Data from three independent experiments showing fold change relative to untreated cells (mean 6SD) after normalization to the TATA-binding protein (TBP) mRNA. (TIF) Figure S7 Translation profiles of individual proteins in MHV-infected macrophages. Translation profiles based on pulsed SILAC of macrophages from C75/BL6 (Ifit1 +/+ ) and Ifit1deficient (Ifit1 2/2 ) mice infected with wild-type MHV (WT) or 29O methyltransferase-deficient MHV (DA) as shown in Fig. 5 . The profile plot shows normalized LFQ intensities of heavy proteins, representing a total number of 451 proteins labelled during the 2 h pulse period. Data show average LFQ intensities from three independent replicates. Selected profiles are coloured and represent MHV proteins and cellular proteins involved in immune responses. (TIF) ",

(a) Schematic overview of synthesis of the biotinylated RNA used in this study. 59 triphosphorylated (PPP-) 7SK-antisense RNA obtained by in vitro transcription with SP6 polymerase was modified enzymatically at the 59 end by incubating with alkaline phosphatase (AP) to remove 59 phosphates (OH-RNA), with recombinant Vaccinia virus capping enzyme (VCE) to produce unmethylated capped RNA (CAP-RNA), with VCE in the presence of S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) to generate N7-methylated capped RNA (CAP0-RNA), or with VCE and recombinant Vaccinia virus 29O methyltransferase (VP39) in the presence of SAM to generate N7-methylated capped RNA methylated at the 29O position of the first ribose (CAP1-RNA) [43],[44]. (b) Agarose gel image showing 200 ng of in vitro transcribed, biotinylated RNA following the enzymatic treatments depicted in (a). (c) Evaluation of the N7-and 29O-methylation efficiency of recombinant Vaccinia virus enzymes. Capped RNAs produced as in (a) were incubated either with VCE or VP39 in the presence of 3 H-labeled SAM, and the incorporation efficiency was measured by scintillation counting. 3 H-labeled methyl groups were transferred from SAM only if the RNA had not previously been methylated (N7-methylation of CAP-RNA, and 29O methylation of CAP0-RNA), showing that methylation of RNA by both VCE and VP39 was maximally efficient. (TIF) Figure S2 RNA affinity purifications from HeLa cell lysates. (a) Heatmap of all proteins identified in RNA affinity purifications from HeLa cell lysates. Hierarchical clustering of proteins was performed on logarithmic LFQ protein intensities using Euclidean distances. The colour code represents LFQ intensities in rainbow colours (see colour scale). (b) Heatmap showing hierarchical clustering (Euclidean distances) of interactors that were significantly enriched (see Materials and Methods) in fractions bound by at least one RNA with a modified 59 end structure (compared to OH-RNA). The plot shows means of Zscore transformed logarithmic LFQ intensities. Blue colours indicate Z-score ,0, red colours indicate Z-score .0, white indicates Z-score = 0. The saturation threshold is set at -2.25 and +2.25. Asterisks indicate the IFIT complex. (c) Volcano plots showing enrichment (ratio of LFQ protein intensities; x-axis) and p-values (t-test; y-axis) of CAP1-RNA to CAP-RNA. Data are from three independent affinity purifications. Significantly enriched interactors (see Materials and Methods) are separated from background proteins (blue dots) by a hyperbolic curve (dotted line). Among the significant interactors, IFIT proteins and FTSJD2 (red) are highlighted. (TIF) Figure S3 RNA affinity purifications from lysates of mouse embryo fibroblasts. (a-b) As in Fig. S2, but showing proteins identified in RNA affinity purifications from mouse embryo fibroblasts. In (b) the saturation threshold is set at 21. 5 and +1. 5. The asterisk indicates the Ifit complex. (TIF) Figure S4 Characterisation of the murine IFIT complex.",
