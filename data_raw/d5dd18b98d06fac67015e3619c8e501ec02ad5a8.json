            "text": "Cynomolgus macaques are common across South East Asian countries including Thailand. The National Primate Research Center of Thailand, Chulalongkorn University (NPRCT-CU) captures wild-borne cynomolgus macaque for research use. Limited information is available on the enteric viruses and possible zoonotic infections into or from cynomolgus macaques. We characterized and compare the fecal virome of two populations; healthy wild-originated captive cynomolgus macaques (n = 43) reared in NPRCT-CU and healthy wild cynomolgus macaques (n = 35). Over 90% of recognized viral sequence reads amplified from feces were from bacterial viruses. Viruses from seven families of mammalian viruses were also detected (Parvoviridae, Anelloviridae, Picornaviridae, Adenoviridae, Papillomaviridae, Herpesviridae, and Caliciviridae). The genomes of a member of a new picornavirus genus we named Mafapivirus, a primate chapparvovirus, and a circular Rep-encoding single-strand (CRESS) DNA virus were also characterized. Higher abundance of CRESS DNA viruses of unknown tropism and invertebrate-tropic ambidensovirus were detected in wild versus captive macaques likely reflecting dietary differences. Short term rearing in captivity did not have a pronounced effect on the diversity of mammalian viruses of wild cynomolgus macaques. This study is the first report of the fecal virome of cynomolgus macaques, non-human primates frequently used in biomedical research and vaccination studies.",

Viromes characterized from animals and human are comprised of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic viruses [2] . Commensal bacteriophages, which make up the major fraction of the fecal virome, can modulate the microbial community in the host body and influence host immunity [2] [3] [4] [5] . Although typically a smaller fraction of the enteric virome, mammalian viruses may cause diseases such as diarrhea resulting in malnutrition and dehydration [6] . Deep sequencing of wild animal fecal viromes also unveiled many eukaryotic viruses whose pathogenicity, if any, remain mostly unknown [7] [8] [9] [10] . In the past, emergences of human infectious diseases have been initiated by zoonotic viruses originating from bats, rodents, salt solution (HBSS), 1% (w/v) of bovine serum albumin, 15 \u00b5g/mL of amphotericin B, 100 U/mL of penicillin G, and 50 \u00b5g/mL of streptomycin. The samples were processed within 12 h of collection. The experimental protocol of this study was approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the NPRCT-CU (Protocol Review No. 1775005; 28 Sep 2017).",

The sequences were then quality trimmed and trimmed for adaptor and primer sequences by using VecScreen [34] . After that, the reads were de novo assembled by EnsembleAssembler [35] . Assembled contigs and all singlet reads were aligned to in-house viral protein database (collected from ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/refseq/release/viral/, Oct. 20, 2017) using BLASTx (version 2.2.7) using E-value cutoff of 0.01 to identify highly divergent viral sequences. The significant hits to viruses were then aligned to an in-house non-virus-non-redundant (NVNR) universal proteome database using DIAMOND [36] . Matches with more significant E-values to NVNR than to the viral database were removed to eliminate false viral hits. The genome coverage of the target viruses was further analyzed by Geneious R7.0.6 software (Biomatters, Auckland, New Zealand).",

In addition, the conserved ATP walker binding loop motif was found in NS1. Based on a recent study of chapparvovirus [50] , we identified three alternative splicings of viral RNA. Both NS1 and VP1 transcripts are expected to be spliced onto a 5 UTR region RNA. In addition, we also found an additional small predicted NS2 transcript located within NS1 ORF but lacking a start codon indicating that splicing is required for translation. A putative upstream NS2 exon near 5 end of genome matched with the recently reported NS2 sequences of mouse kidney parvovirus (YP009553676) [51] and simian parvo-like virus 1 (APC23171). These are key characteristics indicating that mafachaviruses 1A and 1B are members of type I exogenous amniote chapparvoviruses [50, 51] . The mafachavirus NS1 protein is most closely related to partial NS1 sequence of simian parvo-like virus 2 with 91% amino acid identity (Figure S4.) . However, simian parvo-like virus 2 partial genome submitted to GenBank (KT961661) lacked VP1 sequences [52] . Therefore, this is the first reported simian chapparvovirus genome with complete ORFs. The VP1 of mafachavirus sequenced here was distantly related to that of porcine parvovirus 7 with 54% amino acid identity. The ICTV guideline suggested that parvoviruses within a species should have >85% amino acid NS1 identity while different species within the same genus should have >30% identity amino acid identity of NS1. Following these guidelines, we purpose the species name of this virus as Mafachavirus 1 (MN312221) since pairwise NS1 similarities showed maximum amino acid identity of 46.6% when compared with porcine parvovirus 7 (Table S2. ). The phylogenetic relationship of this novel chapparvovirus was also investigated using VP1 and NS1 proteins. The VP1 phylogenetic trees showed that porcine parvovirus 7 is the closest relative of mafachavirus 1A and 1B ( Figure 5B ).

For the NS1 tree, the novel virus clustered with that of the complete NS1 of simian parvo-like virus 3 from Macaca mulatta in the US [52] . This indicated that the chapparvovirus we named mafachavirus in long-tailed macaque is closely related to chapparvovirus partial genomes originally reported from US captive rhesus macaques (simian parvo-like virus 1/KT961662, simian parvo-like virus 2/KT961661, parvo-like virus 3/KT961660) [52] .",

Overall seven families of eukaryotic viruses were identified. We detected anelloviruses at the highest frequency in the captive monkeys testing sero-negative for herpes B virus (34.8%) which is also the youngest group of animals. Anellovirus was detected in only three herpes B sero-positive captive (15.8%) and a single herpes B positive wild animal (2.85%). Increased anellovirus viral loads have been associated with reduced levels of host immunocompetence. [63] [64] [65] [66] Other mammalian viruses from five families (Parvoviridae, Picornaviridae, Adenoviridae, Papillomaviridae, and Herpesviridae) detected in captive herpes B sero-negative were not detected in older captive herpes B sero-positive animals. The significantly younger age of the herpes negative versus positive captive animals may also account for their higher rates of enteric viral infections [67] .",

Mafachavirus is the sister taxa to porcine parvovirus 7 detected in swine populations from several countries including China and Korea [75] [76] [77] [78] . Reads from another parvovirus were also detected that were distantly related to porcine parvovirus 5 and 6 in the copiparvovirus genus reported in pig lung [76, 79] that may represent a novel macaque copiparvoviruses.

The CRESS viruses detected in feces are highly divergent from those that have been recently classified. CRESS DNA virus has been identified from feces of human and numerous mammals including rhesus macaque and birds and in most environmental virome studies. [52, 53, 80, 81] The only CRESS-DNA viruses which have been shown to replicate in mammals are members of the Circoviridae family infecting pigs, dogs, and other mammals [82] [83] [84] . The non-Circoviridae CRESS-DNA genomes found here are therefore of unknown tropism. The common detection of such genomes in fecal samples indicates that these viruses may be ingested rather than replicate in mammalian cells or may even replicate in gut parasites such as protozoa and nematodes [85] . The higher levels of CRESS-DNA read in wild versus captive macaques may reflect difference in their diet or prevalence of co-infecting parasites. The more common detection of densovirus DNA in feces of wild macaques may also reflect a greater consumption of insects by wild versus captive macaques. It is known that when fruits are unavailable for the generally frugivorous cynomolgus monkeys their diet will expand to include insects, leaves, seeds, mushrooms, invertebrates, and bird eggs [86] . Because samples were collected in the fruitless dry season, the densoviruses in wild macaque feces may be infecting consumed insects or insect contaminating other foods. The levels of densovirus DNA in feces may therefore reflect macaque habitats and diet.",

Three genomes of novel viruses were characterized. Despite the viromes of wild cynomolgus macaques showing higher abundance of CRESS DNA viruses and densoviruses than those of captive animals the distribution of clearly mammalian viruses did not differ between these populations. Retention of a diverse mixture of enteric viruses after short term captivity therefore indicate that wild cynomolgus macaques reared in captivity for one year show no reduction in the complexity of their mammalian fecal virome. Virome analyses of feces from rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) born in captivity in US primate centers [52, 87, 88] also show the presence of numerous enteric viruses mimicking the situation in their wild counterparts [89] .",
