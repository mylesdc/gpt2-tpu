            "text": "In the recent years, it has been demonstrated that the biological activity of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) is mediated through the release of paracrine factors. Many of these factors are released into exosomes, which are small membranous vesicles that participate in cell-cell communication. Exosomes from MSCs are thought to have similar functions to MSCs such as repairing and regeneration of damaged tissue, but little is known about the immunomodulatory effect of these vesicles. Based on an extensive bibliography where the immunomodulatory capacity of MSCs has been demonstrated, here we hypothesized that released exosomes from MSCs may have an immunomodulatory role on the differentiation, activation and function of different lymphocyte subsets. According to this hypothesis, in vitro experiments were performed to characterize the immunomodulatory effect of human adipose MSCs derived exosomes (exo-hASCs) on in vitro stimulated T cells. The phenotypic characterization of cytotoxic and helperT cells (activation and differentiation markers) together with functional assays (proliferation and IFN-\u03b3 production) demonstrated that exo-hASCs exerted an inhibitory effect in the differentiation and activation of T cells as well as a reduced T cell proliferation and IFN-\u03b3 release on in vitro stimulated cells. In summary, here we demonstrate that MSCs-derived exosomes are a cell-derived product that could be considered as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of inflammation-related diseases.",

Our results showed that, at day 6, the percentage of intracellular IFN-\u03b3 was reduced when PBLs were cultured with exosomes, in comparison to positive control, in both T cell subsets. However, this reduction was only statistically significant on gated CD4 + T cells (Figure 5) .

At day 6, in vitro stimulated PBLs were analyzed for CD45RA and CCR7 on CD8 + and CD4 + T cell subsets. Two different exo-hASCs at 16 \u00b5g/10 6 cells from different donors were used in these experiments (Exos#1 and Exos#2). The figure shows representative histograms from the three different experiments. Percentage of positive cells is shown in each histogram.",

At day six, PBLs were collected and T-lymphocytes subsets were stained with anti-CD3, anti-CD4, and anti-CD8. Fluorescence profiles of CFSE-labeled cells allowed us to identify eight divisions.
