However, to date, the evolutionary mechanisms that govern CoV strain persistence in human populations have not been fully understood. In this study, we characterized the evolution of the major antigen-spike (S) gene in the most prevalent human coronavirus (HCoV) OC43 using phylogenetic and phylodynamic analysis. Among the five known HCoV-OC43 genotypes (A to E), higher substitution rates and dN/dS values as well as more positive selection sites were detected in the S gene of genotype D, corresponding to the most dominant HCoV epidemic in recent years. Further analysis showed that the majority of substitutions were located in the S1 subunit. Among them, seven positive selection sites were chronologically traced in the temporal evolution routes of genotype D, and six were located around the critical sugar binding region in the N-terminal domain (NTD) of S protein, an important sugar binding domain of CoV. These findings suggest that the genetic drift of the S gene may play an important role in genotype persistence in human populations, providing insights into the mechanisms of HCoV-OC43 adaptive evolution.",

For instance, the feline CoV (FCoV) type II, a member of \u03b1 -CoV, might be generated by a double recombination between FCoV type I and canine CoV 4 . Interestingly, porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus, bovine CoV (BCoV) and HCoV-OC43 of \u00df-CoV are thought to have evolved from the same common ancestor 5 . During evolution, high frequencies of homologous RNA recombination and gene mutations are considered the main forces that push CoVs to adapt to specific hosts. Such events can lead to emergence of new strains or genotypes within a certain species, and even to new species, causing epidemic or zoonotic outbreaks that continuously threaten human health 2,3 . This phenomenon is exemplified by the recent emergence of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV 6,7 .

The spike (S) protein of CoVs protruding on the surface of virions is the major antigenic protein for inducing neutralizing antibodies. However, it is in turn under the highest selection pressure among the viral proteins 1, 8 . S proteins are often cleaved into S1 and S2 subunits to achieve receptor binding and membrane fusion, respectively 1 . The S1 subunit is composed of two distinct domains, the N-terminal domain (NTD) and the C-terminal domain (CTD), which play important roles in receptor binding 1 . The NTD is responsible for sugar receptor binding in some CoVs, such as BCoV and HCoV-OC43, or for protein receptor binding in murine hepatitis virus 1, [9] [10] [11] . The CTD functions as the protein receptor binding domains (RBD) for most of the CoVs 1 . The S1 subunits of all CoV genera have similar topological structure, preserved sugar-binding functions, but different receptors-binding functions, which suggest that subtly adaptive mutations occur in functional domains during evolution of CoVs 12, 13 . Similar adaptive amino acids mutations around the receptor-binding region have also been found in norovirus, contributing to its epidemic in humans 14 . Investigation on the evolutionary insights of the S gene, particularly the functional domains, is imperative for understanding the evolution of CoVs and for tracing spillover events and ecological niches.",

To verify the epidemic history of OC43 genotypes over the study period, the relative effective viral population size over time was inferred by analyzing the genetic diversity of the S gene using the Bayesian skyline model. Only the strains obtained from clinical samples containing the full length S, RdRp, and N genes retrieved from PubMed (http:// www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) and GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) for the years 2003 to 2012 were used (see Supplementary Table S1 on line). A varying population size profile was observed (Fig. 1) . The overall plot of OC43 (including genotypes B, C, D and E) showed two large bottlenecks. The first was found between 2006 and 2007, showing a decrease in relative genetic diversity in 2006, followed by an increase in 2007. The second was found between 2008 and 2009, with a transient decrease before 2008, followed by an increase in relative genetic diversity coinciding with a temporal epidemic in population size. Genotype B exhibited a transient increase in 2004, then followed a steady but slowly increased relative genetic diversity, corresponding to global increases in its detection 17 . Genotype D showed a decreased genetic diversity before 2007, then an increase after 2009, consistent with its dominant epidemic from 2007 to 2012 17 . Genotype C and E both exhibited a short and steady relative genetic diversity during the study period. The history of the relative genetic diversity obtained here corresponds to global epidemic data, indicating that the relative genetic diversity measured by the S gene generally reflects the HCoV-OC43 dynamic in population size. The relative genetic diversity of genotype D corresponded to the two bottlenecks of OC43, indicating that genotype D accounts for much of the genetic diversity of OC43 and is the predominant genotype.",

Genotypes B and D, which have high genetic variability contained more selections sites than that of C and E genotypes. The possible link between the positive selection sites and the genetic variability of genotypes should be evaluated in the future studies. The evaluation of relative genetic diversity, substitution rate, dN/dS value, and positive selection sites further showed that genotype D had a significant influence on the relative genetic diversity of OC43 and that its S gene evolved towards heterogeneity. More positive selection sites were also found in the S1 subunit of genotype D. Amino acid substitutions in the surface proteins are considered an important adaption strategy for the persistence of a virus to evade host immune pressure 8, 18 . Although the neutralizing epitopes have not been identified, the substitutions identified in the S1 subunit of OC43 in this study are predicted to be in the antigenicity region (data not shown), which may allow viruses to escape host neutralizing antibodies [19] [20] [21] [22] . Collectively, these findings suggest that genetic drift may play an important role in maintaining the spread of genotype D in the human population. Whether the genetic variations affect the related antigenic phenotype will need to be confirmed by antigen analysis using S genes with such mutants.",

The residues at positions 33, 90, 93, 120, 184, 195, and 521 were positive selection sites, with six (33, 90, 93, 120, 184 and 195) located in NTD, and one (521) in the predicted RBD. All but one strain (5445/07) identified after 2007 contained the mutation of Y521H. All the strains identified after 2008 contained the mutation K90L. The mutations L195S and Y521H were found in strains identified between 2008 and 2011, but not in those of 2012. Other mutations, including N33D, T93K, D120H and K184N, were found in several strains. The chronologically traced positive sites might be associated with the ladder-like MCC phylogeny of the virus, indicating the key role of aa substitutions in the population dynamics of the virus",
