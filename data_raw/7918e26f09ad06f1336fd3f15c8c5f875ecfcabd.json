Understanding community ILI can shed light on the full burden of influenza. Furthermore, primary care clinics, a common setting for outpatient ILI surveillance, may not adequately capture cases who could seek care in other settings, such as emergency departments or urgent care clinics. In addition, systems that focus on medically attended ILI may have other biases (eg, access to care) and delays associated with care seeking that may affect sensitivity of testing and may not reflect influenza and other respiratory virus activity in the broader community. [3] [4] [5] A comparison between community surveillance and outpatient medically attended ILI surveillance systems could help to determine how well medically attended surveillance systems reflect respiratory viral activity in the community.",

The Mobile Surveillance for Acute Respiratory Infections and Influenza-Like Illness in the Community (MoSAIC) Study is one recent prospective household-based cohort study established in 2012, in a neighborhood in New York City to obtain community-level incidence of influenza and other respiratory viruses. 8 In 2009, New York City, along with other participating sites, began the Influenza Incidence Surveillance Project (IISP). IISP is designed to determine the incidence of medically attended ILI and the proportion of ILI attributable to influenza and other respiratory diseases using provider estimates of patient populations. 10 Using these two systems in the single geographic region of New York City, we sought to compare symptoms as well as the frequency, proportion, and seasonal distribution of respiratory pathogens associated with ILI between individuals with medically attended ILI and broader community-level ILI across three influenza seasons to better understand how current ILI surveillance in medical clinics reflects activity seen at the community level.",

The cohort consists of approximately 250 households and is a primarily Latino population. Demographic information is collected upon enrollment. Households receive twice-weekly text messages, asking if anyone has runny nose, congestion, sore throat, cough, body aches, or fever and report either \"yes\" or \"no.\" Home visits are performed by research staff to obtain a nasal swab from any participants meeting the ARI criteria (2 symptoms including fever, runny nose/congestion, sore throat, cough, and/or myalgia) with symptoms lasting < 5 days and who are still symptomatic. The ARI criteria for infants (less than 12 months of age) also include runny nose/congestion alone. Respiratory swabs are analyzed in a research laboratory using a BioFire FilmArray multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay (BioFire Diagnostics LLC, Salt Lake City, UT) detecting influenza A virus (H1, H1N1pdm09, and H3), influenza B virus, adenovirus, coronaviruses (229E, HKU1, NL63, and OC43), enteroviruses/rhinoviruses, human metapneumovirus (HMPV), human parainfluenza viruses (HPIV) types 1-4, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), Chlamydia pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Bordetella pertussis. Further information on symptoms and care-seeking behaviors is collected by interview at illness end.",

While state-to-state variation in influenza activity is seen in the United States in national surveillance data, there have been limited studies on small-scale geographic variations in respiratory pathogen circulation. However, local variation in RSV epidemics and lower respiratory illness clustering have been described previously. [14] [15] [16] A possible disadvantage of community surveillance is that the intensive cohort study used in MoSAIC with in-person specimen collection and monthly home visits would likely be cost prohibitive on a broader scale. Further efforts to reduce costs could include relying on automated text messaging or email with follow-up and self-swabbing, which may allow community surveillance to be used more broadly. 17,18",

Our objective was to compare the pathogens detected within the context of ILI between the two systems rather than the full burden of all pathogens. Data on vaccination were incomplete in both IISP and MoSAIC, limiting our ability to control for vaccination in the analysis. In addition, we did not take possible household clustering into account among MoSAIC participants who were living in the same residence.",

While the timing of influenza and other virus detections were captured equally well in community and outpatient surveillance, the proportions of viruses detected varied between the community and outpatient clinics. There may be local geographic and/or social mixing differences affecting incidence of circulating viruses at a very local level and outpatient surveillance across more clinics may better reflect viral circulation in the larger community.

Symptoms reported in MoSAIC and IISP populations were compared using a set of log-binomial regression models adjusted for age to estimate the relative risk of individual symptoms among persons with ILI reported through community-level surveillance compared with medical provider surveillance. A second set of ageadjusted log-binomial regression models was used to estimate the relative prevalence of individual pathogens detected in persons with ILI through MoSAIC compared to IISP. Due to incomplete data, vaccination was not adjusted for. A subset analysis was performed comparing MoSAIC participants who sought care to IISP participants.

Forty percent of MoSAIC participants with ILI sought care for their illness.

Significant differences were also observed when comparing only the medically attended illnesses in MoSAIC with the IISP population. There may be several possible reasons for this finding including differences in the surveillance system methods, differences in the population demographics, household clustering, or potentially limited geographic variation in the circulation of the viruses detected. The two surveillance populations differ in that the MoSAIC population is mostly publicly insured and Latino and, while IISP does not collect demographic information on participants, they are primarily private practices and may be more likely to have commercially insured patients. Care seeking is both less frequent and less timely among persons without insurance and also varies with demographics such as age, or education.4,8,13 Clinics may have a higher proportion of persons with underlying illnesses as compared with the general community. Also, the three contributing clinics in IISP likely have patients from several neighborhoods across the city while MoSAIC recruits from a single neighborhood.",
