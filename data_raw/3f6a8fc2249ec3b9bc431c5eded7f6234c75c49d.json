Different patterns of contact support different epidemic dynamics, potentially affecting the efficacy of control measures such as contact tracing, which aims to identify and isolate nodes with infectious contacts. We used stochastic simulations to investigate the effects of mixing patterns on epidemic dynamics and contact-tracing efficacy. For uncontrolled epidemics, outbreaks occur at lower infection rates for more assortatively mixed networks, with faster initial epidemic growth rate and shorter epidemic duration than for disassortatively mixed networks. Contact tracing performs better for assortative mixing where epidemic size is large and tracing rate low, but it performs better for disassortative mixing at higher contact rates. For assortatively mixed networks, disease spreads first to highly connected nodes, but this is balanced by contact tracing quickly identifying these same nodes. The converse is true for disassortative mixing, where both disease and tracing are less likely to target highly connected nodes. For small epidemics, contact tracing is more effective on disassortative networks due to the greater resilience of assortative networks to link removal. Multi-step contact tracing is more effective than single-step tracing for assortative mixing, but this effect is smaller for disassortatively mixed networks.",

Contact tracing was successful in the 2003 SARS epidemic (Lipsitch et al. 2003) , but unsuccessful in the 2001 FMD epidemic in the UK (Ferguson et al. 2001; Keeling et al. 2001; Kao 2003) . For simple unstructured populations, contact tracing has been modelled using a combination of branching process analysis complemented by stochastic simulation models (M\u00fcller et al. 2000) . However, in more highly structured contact networks, the properties of the network markedly influence the efficacy of contact tracing. For example, contact tracing is more effective on clustered networks than on random networks (Eames & Keeling 2003; Kiss et al. 2005) , and on scale-free networks a higher tracing effort is needed to control an epidemic than on random Poisson networks .",

            "text": "In this paper, we examine the impact of departure from the common assumption of proportionate (random) mixing upon the efficacy of contact tracing. Proportionate mixing assumes that the probability of any two nodes being connected is proportional to the product of their number of contacts. This is unlikely in many cases where 'like attaches to like, assortatively mixed' (e.g. STI transmission; Anderson et al. 1990; Catania et al. 1992) or where 'opposites attract, disassortatively mixed' (e.g. livestock trading among farms and markets in the UK ; correlation properties of the Internet (Pastor-Satorras et al. 2001) ). The empirical evidence and importance of connectivity correlations have led to numerous network-and differential equation-based models (Bogu\u00f1\u00e1 et al. 2003a; Newman 2003a; Barth\u00e9lemy et al. 2005) . Many of these models focus on the effect of connectivity correlations on the epidemic threshold, initial growth rate and hierarchical spread. For example, it has been shown that epidemics on networks characterized by high node degree variance grow rapidly, and in the limiting case of infinite variance, instantaneously, independently of the mixing pattern (Bogu\u00f1\u00e1 et al. 2003b) . The initial growth of the epidemic changes from exponential to power law if non-random mixing is combined with small-world properties, with the powerlaw exponent determined by the average node distance on the network ( Vazquez 2006) . While in the limit of infinite populations, the implications of preferential mixing for disease invasion are well known, here we focus on disease control and consider the efficacy of contact tracing for different mixing patterns. For networks that are poorly characterized, the efficacy of contact tracing is difficult to determine without exact knowledge of the underlying contact network, i.e. who is connected to whom? By analysing disease transmission on theoretical networks with different mixing patterns, we aim to identify the implications of non-random mixing for epidemic dynamics and control strategies.",

Following Newman (2003a), a value of gZ2.5 is used for the power-law exponent. The network analysis that illustrates the effect of preferential mixing is performed for KZ100. For this value of K, the average number of connections per node in the networks is hkiz1.7. To explore a range of parameter values that support meaningful epidemics (i.e. where the epidemic is large enough to be of a significant public health concern), hki must be sufficiently large to allow for a range of new infections in the first generation well above 1. Therefore, the networks are generated by only accepting nodes with kR3 (see Kiss et al. 2006b ). Moreno et al. (2003) proposed a numerical method for epidemic models that can account for connectivity correlations. While this method works without explicitly generating the network, it offers less flexibility when considering disassortatively mixed networks. Here, we use epidemic simulations on networks with NZ10 000 nodes and consider values of rZK0.2, K0.10, K0.05 for disassortatively mixed networks and rZ0.05, 0.10, 0.2 for assortatively mixed networks. The limits are chosen as the values over which the algorithm appears to be robust (M. E. J. Newman 2006, personal communication) ; this range of r values is sufficient to give marked differences in the epidemic threshold for the transmission rate, number of nodes traced, final epidemic size and to illustrate important trends in contact-tracing efficacy. A further check on the mixing pattern is illustrated in the electronic supplementary material by a plot of the average connectivity of a neighbour as a function of node connectivity for different values of r.",

Therefore, for low link density, a larger GC size is found than for either disassortatively mixed or random networks. Link density within the GC is higher than in the network as a whole. In contrast, in disassortatively mixed networks at low link density, the links are more dispersed, forming many isolated components of small size (figure 3). As link density increases, the probability that a link with one node in the GC will only connect to another node already in the GC also increases; this is a finite size effect that is exacerbated by assortative mixing since high-degree nodes are relatively few. Thus, at higher link densities, assortatively mixed networks have a smaller GC size compared with disassortatively mixed networks, as in the latter, added links are more likely to result in smaller components being absorbed into the GC (figure 2).

The value of R 0 can be estimated as the lead eigenvalue of the next-generation matrix CZ(c ij ) (Diekmann & Heesterbeek 2000) , and, in this case, it can be approximated by the product of the contact matrix and the per-link probability of transmission c ij ZT p M ij . A non-zero entry M ij Z1 denotes that an infectious node j can transmit the infection to a susceptible node i; the magnitude of c ij is given by the per-link transmission probability T p .

In contrast, on disassortatively mixed networks, disease spread is slower, but contact tracing is also less efficient. Contact tracing can be viewed as an exploration of the local network structure (Cohen et al. 2003) , and thus we would expect its efficacy to depend on the mixing patterns of the network. This is investigated by varying 4, while keeping d fixed. For comparison purposes, we contrast the cases where R(N) is the same on both assortatively and disassortatively mixed networks, but possibly with differing transmission rates, later concentrating on the unique transmission rate that results in the same R(N) on both networks.",

First, transmission rates are chosen such that R(N)z0.73 on both networks (tZ0.125 and 0.175 on disassortatively and assortatively mixed networks, respectively; figure 6a ) and, second, the transmission rates are the same (tZ0.0528) with R(N)z0.225 on both networks (figure 6b).

            "text": "In figure 6a , if F%0.61, R(N) is smaller on assortatively mixed networks. Contact tracing on assortatively mixed networks removes nodes of higher degree (figure 5b) than on disassortatively mixed networks. For small F values, the final epidemic size is still high and the population of highly connected nodes is depleted well before the epidemic ends, as shown by the crossover between the average degree of newly infected nodes on the two network types (figure 5b). Over the epidemic, susceptible nodes are on average of lower degree and are more difficult to reach. On disassortatively mixed networks, the depletion of highly connected nodes is less marked and epidemics persist, with disease spread alternating between highly and less well-connected nodes producing an average degree of newly infected nodes which is more even in time (figure 5b). In the latter stages of the epidemic, on disassortatively mixed networks, highly connected nodes are not completely depleted and can become infected. Thus, on the assortatively mixed networks, the epidemic ends earlier with a smaller final epidemic size. On assortatively mixed networks, when global depletion of susceptible nodes is important, contact tracing acts to enhance the early depletion of nodes of high degree (figure 5b). At higher tracing probability, the proportion of nodes removed through contact tracing (figure 6a) decreases with increasing tracing probability. This is indicative of effective control with a limited proportion of nodes becoming infectious and, hence, fewer targets for tracing. In the regime of more effective control (FR0.61), the epidemics die out early on and susceptible depletion becomes less important. This is illustrated in figure 7 , showing that the depletion of susceptibles is only found at low F values. This is also reflected in the very rapid reduction of R g (i.e. average reproduction ratio in generation g defined as the ratio between the number of nodes infected in consecutive generations) below 1 when F is high. This is a more general effect corroborated by examining contacttracing efficacy in a different parameter regime. In figure 6b , the scenario where tZ0.0528 on both networks is considered. For this value of t and in the absence of tracing, the final epidemic size is the same on both networks (R(N)z0.225). Here, the final epidemic size is similar to the point at which contact tracing starts to perform better on disassortatively mixed networks in figure 6a. In this case, for all F values, contact tracing always performs better on disassortatively mixed networks. The behaviour in this regime can be explained by interpreting contact tracing as a mechanism acting to reduce the effective transmission probability T p past the first generation of infection. Contact tracing achieves this by shortening the average infectious period of traced nodes. In figure 4 , lower transmission probabilities correspond to lower values of the transmission rate t. While we do not have exact analytic relationships between the implications of reducing the transmission probability through the different routes, the effect of contact tracing can be approximated by following the trend of the final epidemic size (figure 4) as the transmission probability decreases. The steeper curve of the final epidemic size on disassortatively mixed networks suggests that a small decrease in the transmission probability has a more marked effect on final epidemic size than on assortatively mixed networks. This effect is especially dominant since in the absence of tracing the same R(N) is observed on both networks. This supports the higher contact-tracing efficacy observed on disassortatively mixed networks.",

For both network types (figure 8), there are considerable differences between the final epidemic sizes for single-and multiple-step contact tracing at high tracing rates, particularly for assortatively mixed networks (figure 8b). In multiple-step tracing, a triggering node can generate other triggering nodes, potentially creating a cascade of triggering nodes throughout the infected portion of the network. This leads to tracing a higher number of infectious nodes and reducing the number of links that successfully transmit the disease. For high tracing rates, the epidemics are short-lived, and, on assortatively mixed networks, as a result of the faster initial epidemic growth rate, the extra proportion of untraced infectious nodes in the case of single-step tracing generates a higher number of infections and hence there is a marked difference between single-and multistep tracing. In figure 8 , the faster decrease in the proportion of traced nodes with increasing tracing probability indicates earlier and more effective control in the case of multiple-step contact tracing compared with the single-step case.",

On assortatively mixed networks, the epidemic spread is faster and the disease typically spreads to nodes with high degree. This is counterbalanced by contact tracing that removes infectious nodes with high degree. On disassortatively mixed networks, the epidemic spread is slower; however, owing to the connectivity pattern, contact tracing also alternates between removing poorly and highly connected nodes and therefore is comparably less effective. The higher average degree of traced nodes is a reflection of the average degree of nodes becoming infected earlier on in the epidemic when highly connected nodes are more abundant. This combined with the depletion of highly connected nodes, accentuated by finite size effects, leads to producing a higher average degree of traced nodes when compared with the average degree of infected nodes.",

The efficacy of contact tracing in this case is determined by the more resilient nature of the assortatively mixed networks to the removal of potentially infectious links through tracing.

For more marked differences in the mixing pattern, we expect similar qualitative conclusions with possibly more significant quantitative differences. For the models presented above, differences in contact-tracing efficacy were investigated for various parameter values in addition to those presented. The results agreed qualitatively across the range of parameter values studied. However, further investigation is needed to determine the relative contributions of the different determinants of contact-tracing efficacy. The model presented here does not incorporate time or resource constraints for contact tracing. The implementation of epidemic control strategies often involves qualified personnel and costly or time-consuming diagnostic tests. Although contact tracing performs comparably well on both network types, the faster time course of the epidemic on assortatively mixed networks is more likely to stretch resources in real situations, since it requires a greater and more timely concentration of resources.",

These results would suggest that it is difficult to exploit network structure to achieve better control via tracing. This may seem somewhat surprising, as previous studies have shown that control strategies such as acquaintance sampling (Cohen et al. 2003 ) that is based on the local exploration of the population contact structure provide an efficient epidemic control strategy, compared with random removal of nodes. However, such studies considered only networks that are randomly mixed and compare random removal with targeted removal (a form of contact tracing). Here, however, we compare targeted removal but where the networks themselves differ. Like the disease itself, contact tracing exploits the local network structure and, for assortatively mixed networks, identifies and removes early the highly connected nodes. This beneficial effect, however, is counterbalanced by the fast initial disease spread to such highly important nodes. Therefore, in the present case, the properties of the network can at the same time enhance disease spread and also increase control efficacy, highlighting the non-trivial interactions between the network structure and the dynamics on networks, showing that added attention is needed when evaluating the efficacy of epidemic control strategies.",
