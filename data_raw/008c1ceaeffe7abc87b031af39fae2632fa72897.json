The query protein sequence is dissected into overlapping short sequence segments. Ten different physicochemical features describe each amino acid; therefore nine residues long segment is represented as a point in a 90 dimensional space. The database of sequence segments with confirmed by experiments post-translational modification sites are used for training a set of ANNs.",

            "text": "Post-translational modification (PTM) is the chemical modification of a protein after its translation. During protein synthesis, a protein is build using twenty different amino acids, yet after translation a post-translational modification of amino acids can be observed by attaching to them other biochemical functional groups such as acetate, phosphate, various lipids and carbohydrates, by changing the chemical nature of an amino acid, or by making structural changes, like the formation of disulfide bridges. In the advent of massive (complex and time-consuming) sequencing experiments, the availability of whole proteomes requires accurate computational techniques for investigation of protein modification sites for the high-throughput scale. To address these needs we propose here our improved technique to identify PTM sites by using artificial neural network, trained on proteins from the current version of Swiss-Prot database [1] and Phospho.ELM dataset [2, 3] .",

The currently available PTM prediction tools can be categorized into four major groups based on the used types of classification schemes. The first category includes general PTM related resources like ELM [4] that perform rapid regular expression pattern search in order to predict Eukaryotic Linear Motifs (ELMs) in protein sequences. Another web service, namely PROSITE [5] predicts many types of PTMs based on the consensus of sequence patterns. Consensus based approaches combine several signature recognition methods to scan a given query protein sequence against observed protein signatures. The Scansite tool [6] predicts kinase-specific and signal transduction relevant motifs. The conserved sequence motifs represent footprints of important biochemical properties or biological functions performed by those proteins. GPS approach predicts kinase-specific phosphorylation sites from protein primary sequences for 71 different PK groups by family-based phosphorylation scoring technique [7, 8] . The PHOSITE [9] algorithm for prediction of phosphorylation sites is based on casebased sequence analysis to obtain predictions with constant specificity and sensitivity.",

In another work, the prediction of Lysine acytelation sites is done using SVM [21] based classifiers. PredPhospho [22] is another SVM based system that attempts to predict phosphorylation sites and the type of kinase that acts at each site. Our previously developed web-server AutoMotifServer (AMS) [23] for prediction of post-translational modification sites in protein sequences, also uses SVM classifier with both linear and polynomial kernels. This software is available freely at http://ams2.bioinfo.pl/. KinasePhos 2.0 [24] is another web server for identifying protein kinase-specific phosphorylation sites based on 9 amino acid long sequences and coupling patterns. There are several options provided in this prediction program, including three different levels of specificity: 90%, 95% and 100%.

The PPSP predicted the plausible phosphorylation sites accurately for approximately 70 PK (Protein Kinase) groups. For our tests we choose the PPSP_balanced model that seems to provide the best overall performance for all types of protein families. In the important work of Wan et al.

They compiled and evaluated their technique on four unbiased phosphorylation site datasets, namely the four major protein kinase families: CDK, CK2, PKA and PKC.

The consensus build by those three ANNs for each type of PTM gives an additional advantage in comparison to the previously reported ANN based PTM prediction models. In our previous publications on AMS [23, 30] , the SVM based classification model failed to classify several PTM types with limited number of positive samples.

Therefore, we partially ran the experiments with the old version of the dataset. However in the case of Phospho.ELM, the complete experimentation is done, together with the new version of the Swiss Prot dataset. Significant differences in the performance of differently optimized neural networks (for different PTM types) are observed, yet the AMS 3.0 tool integrates those heterogeneous classification schemes and it is able to boost the precision and recall values independent of a PTM type in comparison. Performances of AMS3 are also evaluated on four kinase families CDK, CK2, PKA and PKC and compared with the aforementioned predictor systems. We could observe that the performance of the current technique is comparable with the best among the rest. However, there are cases when the current technique fails to beat all other predictors. As shown in Figure 3 , for the best AUC value for kinase type PKC, Meta Predictor outperforms AMS3. Similarly, in case of kinase type CK2, AMS3 comes third, below NetPhosK and PPSP.

Secondly, the choice and design of the MLP base classifier. Despite popular choice of SVM in binary classification problems, we have got better accuracy with MLP by exhaustively tuning variety of learning parameters and experimented on a wide range of hidden neuron variations. The prudent choice of train/test ratios in positive and negative samples and the novel idea of optimizing respective networks separately on peak AUC/Recall/Precision values, also boosted the overall performance preserving the generality of the tool. The current technique is very fast in comparison to our previously developed SVM based version of the server. As mentioned earlier, the average prediction time for 100 short amino acid sequences is estimated at around 25 ms on a standard desktop computer. In a nutshell, the MLP based pattern classifier, with independent recall/precision/AUC optimized networks, along with an effective feature descriptor is found to be more suitable to the massive prediction of post-translational modifications for whole proteomes. The availability of the precompiled, standalone version allows for high-throughput screening of large sequence datasets, the main problem that the scientific proteome community is now considering heavily.",

Different features are considered based on their previously proven characteristics for the prediction of side chain interaction sites and secondary structure information. More specifically, features based on different side-chain interaction parameters like side-chain volume/hydrophobicity values; some typical amino acid attributes like hydration number, transfer free energy; information value for accessibility, surface tension, molecular weight etc.; and different secondary structure prediction parameters are considered for the selection of the optimum feature subset used here. We initially chose 15 different amino acid features (as shown in Table 1 ) from the AAindex database. Different combinations of those features descriptors are heuristically evaluated on sample train/ test datasets of different representative PTM types (Phospho-PKA, Phospho-PKC, Phospho-autocatalysis and Phospho-CDC2). After exhaustive trial and error, ten different features are found that generate optimal recognition performance on the test datasets under consideration. Table 1 shows the list of accepted/rejected feature descriptors considered in the procedure. Possible reasons behind rejection of some apparently significant features (like ARGP820101, WARP780101 etc.) may be redundancy, or high correlation between the feature values. In other word, the rejected features failed to provide complementary/additional information to the existing feature set. The final list of accepted feature descriptors constitute a 90 dimensional feature vector for evaluation of recognition performances using an MLP based classifier on the benchmarking datasets for different PTM types under consideration. The chosen set of features can therefore be used as the best proven attributes related to post transactional modifications in amino acid sequences.

The classification results are generated along with a probabilistic confidence measure for such decision. More specifically, the designed neural network model generates a confidence measure C ij (0 \u2264 C ij \u2264 1) for the i th query sequence in the j th class (in this experiment, either positive or negative). This confidence measure is estimated as the normalized responses (R j ) of respective output neurons in the output layer of the MLP. Such that, for an i th sequence:",

The MLP used for the present work requires supervised training. During training of an MLP weights or strengths of neuron-to-neuron connections, also called synapses, are iteratively tuned so that the MLP can respond appropriately to all training data and also to other data, not considered at the time of training.

This method randomly splits the dataset into training and test (validation) data. For each such split, the classifier learns to the training data, and predictive accuracy is assessed using the test data. The results are then averaged over multiple such splits. For most of the PTM types, the training and test samples for positive instances are populated in the ratio of 4:1 from all available positive samples. The number of negative samples for each type of PTM is chosen to be significantly larger than the positive samples for both the train and test datasets (the ratio of positive, negative samples is maintained as 1:5 in most cases). Random sub-sampling produces better error estimates than a single train-and-test split. The advantage of this method (over k-fold cross validation) is that the proportion of the training/validation split is not dependent on the number of iterations (folds). In the current work we have performed three random splits in the positive/negative datasets for each PTM. This is done so to eliminate possible bias during the training procedure in any given train/test dataset combination. The neural network for each PTM type is trained separately for the best possible AUC, the recall and precision values on the three randomly chosen independent test datasets. Each of these experiments, for any PTM type, is repeated at least 10 times by varying number of neurons in the hidden layer of the network. More specifically, the experiment is conducted with variation of the number of hidden neurons starting from 2 up to 20 in steps of 2. The optimum networks, giving high AUC, recall and precision values with low error rates, are saved for further consideration.",

LOOCV is usually very expensive from computational point of view because of the large number of times the training process is repeated.
