However, the extensive applications of GTs in glycosides formation are limited due to their requirements of expensive nucleotide diphosphate (NDP)-sugars or NDP as the substrates. Here, in an effort to characterize flexible GTs for glycodiversification of natural products, we isolated a cDNA, designated as OcUGT1 from Ornithogalum caudatum, which encoded a flavonoid GT that was able to catalyze the trans-glycosylation reactions, allowing the formation of glycosides without the additions of NDP-sugars or NDP. In addition, OcUGT1 was observed to exhibit additional five types of functions, including classical sugar transfer reaction and three reversible reactions namely NDP-sugar synthesis, sugars exchange and aglycons exchange reactions, as well as enzymatic hydrolysis reaction, suggesting OcUGT1 displays both glycosyltransferase and glycosidase activities. Expression profiles revealed that the expression of OcUGT1 was development-dependent and affected by environmental factors. The unusual multifunctionality of OcUGT1 broadens the applicability of OcUGT1, thereby generating diverse carbohydrate-containing structures.",

The enzyme-based glycosylations are mainly performed by two types of carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes), glycosyltransferases (GTs, EC 2.4.x.y) and glycosidases (glycoside hydrolases; EC 3.2.x.y) 2 . Glycosidases are naturally hydrolytic enzymes that normally cleave glycosidic bonds 3 . However, glycosidase-assisted glycosylations are able to be achieved by trans-glycosylation reactions under certain controlled conditions 4 . The majority of glycosylation reactions in nature are performed in GT-catalyzed fashion, in which the carbohydrate moieties from activated NDP-sugars are transferred to acceptor molecules 5 . Also, GT-catalyzed glycosylations were accomplished by running the GT reactions in reverse 6 . New glycosides can be generated by reversible sugar or aglycon exchange reactions catalyzed by GTs with the addition of excess of NDP 6,7 . It is therefore obvious that GTs are generally perceived as bidirectional biocatalysts used in glycosylation of small molecules 1, 8, 9 . Yet, despite the validated potential of GTs in glycosides production, the extensive applications of GTs in industry remained limited due to the requirement of expensive NDP-sugars or NDP in GT-catalyzed forward or reversible reactions. Here, we report that a flavonoid GT, designated as OcUGT1, catalyzes the trans-glycosylation reactions, allowing the formation of glycosides without the additions of NDP-sugars or NDP. Specifically, in a screen of novel biocatalysts for flavonoid glycosylations from medicinal plant Ornithogalum caudatum, we found a multifunctional flavonoid GT OcUGT1 exhibiting at least six types of functions, including classical sugar transfer reaction and three reversible reactions namely NDP-sugar synthesis, sugars exchange and aglycons exchange reactions, as well as glycosidase specific hydrolysis and trans-glycosylation reactions. These evidences indicated that OcUGT1 shows",

Unigene 26797 was thus retrieved from the transcriptome database for further investigation due to its high identity with UDP-glucose-dependent flavonoid glucosyltransferase. ORF Finder analysis revealed that unigene 26797 is 1926 bp long and contains a full-length open reading frame (ORF) of 1440 bp encoding a putative protein of 379 amino acids. Moreover, unigene 26797 consisted of a partial 5\u2032-UTR (untranslated region) of 126 bp and 3\u2032-UTR of 360 bp. The ORF sequence of unigene 26797 was tentatively designated OcUGT1. cDNA isolation and sequence analysis of OcUGT1. To validate the authenticity of unigene 26797, a nested PCR assay was applied to isolate OcUGT1 from O. caudatum mRNA using gene-specific primers (Supplementary Table S1 ). An expected band with ca. 1.4 kb was generated and then inserted to pEASY \u00ae -Blunt to yield pEASY-OcUGT1 for sequencing (Supplementary Table S2 ). Sequence analysis showed its identity with the assembled unigene 26797, suggesting this sequence is a bona fide gene in O. caudatum genome. The sequence of unigene 26797 was then deposited in the GenBank database under accession number of MF621962. After sequence verification, comparison of predicted amino acid sequence of OcUGT1 with that of other GTs revealed identities of 57% with Crocus sativus UDP-glucose-dependent flavonoid glucosyltransferase (AIF79773.1), 56% with Musa acuminata subsp. malaccensis scopoletin glucosyltransferase-like (XP_009410978.1) and 55% with Elaeis guineensis scopoletin glucosyltransferase-like (XP_010925717.1).

The GenBank accession numbers of the sequences used in the phylogenetic analysis are listed in Supplementary Figure S1B. As shown in Supplementary Figure S1B , the GTs used in this study can be divided into two clades, flavonoid GTs and steroid GTs. Moreover, the flavonoid GTs were further grouped into three clusters. The first cluster contained flavonoid 3-O-glycosyltransferase (3-O-GT), the second cluster consisted of flavonoid 5-O-glycosyltransfrerase (5-O-GT) and the third group harbored flavonoid 7-O-glycosyltransferase (7-O-GT). OcUGT1 was grouped into the third cluster, displaying predicted 7-O-GT activity.

Chrysin (2) having two hydroxyl groups locating at the C-7 and C-5 positions was therefore used as the flavonoid substrate to test the glycosylation activity of OcUGT1 firstly. After incubation of chrysin (2) with the purified OcUGT1 protein for 2 h at 50 \u00b0C with a continue shaking, a new peak (marked with 2a) was present but in contrast, the control showed no any conversion of chrysin (2), indicating the newly formed peak is a catalytic product of OcUGT1 (Supplementary result section I). The newly formed product was then analyzed by electrospray ionization-time of flight-mass spectrometry (ESI-TOF-MS) method. The ESI-MS spectrum of compound 2a showed [M + HCOOH-H] \u2212 peak at m/z 461.07, suggesting the molecular mass of this compound was 416, which was consistent with the introduction of a glucosyl group to the parent skeleton (Supplementary result section I). To further confirm the exact structure, 2 mg of this monoglucosylated chrysin was collected using HPLC and then used for NMR analysis. The metabolite was assigned to chrysin 7-glucoside (2a) based on 1 H-and 13 C-NMR spectra data (Supplementary result section I). The kinetic studies of OcUGT1-catalyzed glycosylation of chrysin (2) and UDP-Glc were then carried out. As shown in Supplementary Figure S3 , the pH and temperature optimum were determined to pH 8 and 50 \u00b0C. The glycosylations of other substrates were thus performed under the optimal pH and temperature afterwards. Moreover, metal cations were observed to inhibit OcUGT1-catalyzed glycosylation reactions (Supplementary Figure S3C) . The K m and V max values for chrysin (2) were 0.1506 \u00b1 0.0139 mM and 0.2789 \u00b1 0.0073 mM/h, respectively. The data clearly showed that OcUGT1 Figures S4-13 and Tables S1-2 (Supplementary result section II). The formation of seven glucosides (1a-1g) indicated that in addition to the C-7 hydroxyl group, OcUGT1 was able to attach sugar to C-3\u2032 and C-4\u2032 hydroxyl groups of flavonoids, but not attack the hydroxyl group at C-5 position, consistent with the catalytic behavior towards chrysin (2) . The catalytic results of OcUGT1 towards genistein (6) (Supplementary result section III) and daidzein (7) (Supplementary result section IV) further attested the catalytic preference of C-4\u2032 and C-7 positions. Under the action of OcUGT1, both genistein (6) and daidzein (7) were glycosylated to yield a 4\u2032-monoglucoside and a 7-monoglucoside, respectively (Supplementary result sections III and IV).",

No exact structural identification of the diglucoside 4c was carried out due to its trace amount (Supplementary result section VI). However, considering the attack preference of OcUGT1 towards the hydroxyl groups at C-2\u2032 and C-3 positions of 2\u2032-hydroxyflavonol (4), the compound 4c was reasonably deduced to be 2\u2032-hydroxyflavonol 3,2\u2032-diglucoside (4c). The GTs targeting C-2\u2032 position of flavonoids had never been documented 10 . OcUGT1 was therefore regarded as the first GT glycosylating C-2\u2032 position Supplementary Table S3. of flavonoids. Overall, OcUGT1 was able to attach sugars to C-2\u2032, C-3\u2032, C-4\u2032, C-6 and C-7 positions of flavones.

The reversibility of GT-catalyzed glycosylations was attested previously 6 . It has been well accepted that GTs can catalyze three reversible reactions, namely NDP-sugar synthesis, sugar exchange and aglycon exchange 6 .

As shown in Fig. 5 , when p-Nitrophenyl-\u03b2-D-glucopyranoside (pNP-\u03b2-Glc, 17) and UDP (19) were incubated with OcUGT1, the glucosyl group from pNP-\u03b2-Glc (17) was transferred to UDP (19) , thereby forming UDP-Glc (20) under the action of OcUGT1 (Fig. 5) . On the other hand, if no OcUGT1 was mixed with pNP-\u03b2-Glc (17) and UDP (19) , no any new peaks were produced (Fig. 5e) .

Besides monoglycosides (1a-1c), OcUGT1 converted luteolin (1) into di-glycosides (1d-1f) and a tri-glycoside (1 g), suggesting OcUGT1 had the ability to accept glycosylated metabolites for further sugar attachments. To probe this notion, seven luteolin glucosides (1a-1g) were applied as the substrate of OcUGT1 to react with UDP-Glc in phosphate buffer (10 mM, pH 8.0) at 50 \u00b0C for 2 h. As expected, each mono-glucoside (1a, 1b or 1c) was further glycosylated to form two di-glucosides and one tri-glucoside, while all of the three di-glucosides (1d-1f) were further glycosylated to yield the tri-glycoside 1 g (Supplementary  result section XII) . Surprisingly, in addition to glycosylation, we observed OcUGT1 could catalyze two other reactions, namely hydrolysis and trans-glycosylation reactions. As shown in Supplementary result section XII, the luteolin tri-glucoside 1 g was hydrolyzed to generate two di-glucosides 1d and 1e. Likewise, di-glucoside 1d could be hydrolyzed to produce mono-glucoside 1a, while another di-glucoside 1 f was hydrolyzed to form a mono-glucoside 1b. Moreover, OcUGT1 was found to display trans-glycosylation activity. The glycosyl residue at position 4\u2032 of 1b was transferred to position 3\u2032 or O7 by intra-molecular trans-glycosylation, thereby forming luteolin 3\u2032-O-glucoside (1a) or luteolin 7-O-glucoside (1c). Likewise, OcUGT1-catalyzed trans-glycosylation from 1c to 1b or from 1d to 1e was also observable (Supplementary result section XII).

It was generally accepted that glycosidases possessed at least two types of trans-glycosylation actions, namely intra-molecular 34 and intermolecular trans-glycosylation 35 . The intermolecular trans-glycosylation activity of OcUGT1 was thus firstly investigated using chrysin-7-O-glucoside (2a) as sugar donor and 7-hydroxyflavone (5) as the acceptor. As shown in Fig. 9 , OcUGT1 catalyzed an intermolecular trans-glycosylation reaction by transferring a glycosyl moiety from chrysin-7-glucoside (2a) to the acceptor 7-hydroxyflavone (5), thereby forming two new products chrysin (2) and 7-hydroxyflavone 7-O-glucoside (5a) (Fig. 9) . The effects of pH, temperature and metal ions on trans-glycosylation activity of OcUGT1 toward chrysin-7-O-glucoside (2a) were studied. As shown in Supplementary Figure S3 , OcUGT1 exhibited substantial activity at temperatures from 0 to 70 \u00b0C and displayed the highest activity at 37 \u00b0C. OcUGT1 showed a wide pH tolerance and was optimally active at pH 6.0. EDTA, Ca 2+ or Li + had a significantly stimulatory effect on transglycosylation activity. On the other hand, when 5 mM Mn 2+ , Mg 2+ , Zn 2+ , Co 2+ or Cu 2+ were included in reaction mixtures, the inhibitory action on OcUGT1 activity was observable (Supplementary Figure S3) . Moreover, OcUGT1 displayed catalytic versatility, catalyzing intermolecular trans-glycosylations from oNP-\u03b2-Glc (16) to 6-hydroxyflavone (3), from pNP-\u03b2-Glc(17) to 6-hydroxyflavone(3), from chrysin-7-glucoside (2a) to 6-hydroxyflavone (3), from genistein-4\u2032-glucoside (6a) to 7-hydroxyflavone (5) or from genistein-7-glucoside (6b) to 7-hydroxyflavone (5) (Supplementary result section XII) . Surprisingly, in verifying the intermolecular trans-glycosylation from genistein-7-glucoside (6b) to 7-hydroxyflavone (5), we observed the intramolecular trans-glycosylation of genistein-7-glucoside (6b). As illustrated in Supplementary result section XII, the glucosyl group at position O7 of genistein-7-glucoside (6b) was transferred to position 4\u2032, generating genistein-4\u2032-glucoside (6a). It was therefore obvious that there were three metabolites, 6, 6b and 5a, in the reaction mixtures (Supplementary result section XII).

As shown in Supplementary Figure S4 , transcripts of OcUGT1 were detected in all tissues tested. OcUGT1 was most expressed in bulbs followed by flowers, alabastrums, bulblets, roots, sterile bulbs and leaves. The transcripts in bulbs were approximately 10-fold higher than that in leaves of O. caudatum (Supplementary Figure S4) . The bulblet is a small bulb. The transcripts of OcUGT1 in bulbs and bulblets varied differentially, suggesting the in vivo expression of OcUGT1 was development-dependent (Supplementary Figure S4) . Sterile bulbs are bulbs cultivated in sterile environment. Significant variation in mRNA expression of OcUGT1 was observed between bulbs and sterile bulbs, providing a clue that the expression of OcUGT1 was highly affected by environmental factors (Supplementary Figure S4) .",

This notion was further verified by the glycosylation of luteolin (1) (Fig. 3), a flavonoid with multiple hydroxyl groups including a free 7-OH. The conversion of luteolin (1) showed seven newly formed metabolites 1a-1g (Fig. 3). The ESI-MS spectrum of compounds 1a-1c showed [M-H] \u2212 peak at m/z 447.1 (\u2206m/z of 162), indicating mono-glycosylated products (Supplementary result section II).

The minor product 1 g showed a [M + HCOOH] \u2212 value of 817.4 (Supplementary result section II), thus suggesting tri-glycosylation (\u2206m/z of 486).

Besides flavonoids, OcUGT1 glycosylated other compounds, such as emodin (10) (Supplementary result section VIII), resveratrol (11) (Supplementary result section IX), magnolol (12) (Supplementary result section X) and testosterone (13) (Supplementary result section XI), suggesting the acceptor promiscuity of OcUGT1(Fig. 2). The percentage yields of OcUGT1 towards the 13 compounds were thus calculated(Fig. 2B). As shown inFig. 2B, OcUGT1 had the highest glycosylation efficiency for 2 and 13, approaching 90%(Fig. 2B).Besides the diversity of sugar acceptors, OcUGT1 displayed sugar donor promiscuity. As shown inFig. 4, luteolin(1)was xylosylated to form four luteolin derivatives, including three monoxylosylated (1h-1j, each with [M \u2212 H] \u2212 = 417.2) and one dixylosylated metabolites (1k, [M \u2212 H] \u2212 = 549.3) (Supplementary result section II).
