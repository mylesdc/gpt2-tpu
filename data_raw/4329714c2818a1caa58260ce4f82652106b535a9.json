Actual measurement and analysis were carried out on microbial contamination in central air conditioning system at a venue in Dalian, China. Illumina miseq method was used and three fungal samples of two units were analysed by high throughput sequencing. Results showed that the predominant fungus in air conditioning unit A and B were Candida spp. and Cladosporium spp., and two fungus were further used in the hygrothermal response experiment. Based on the data of Cladosporium in hygrothermal response experiment, this paper used the logistic equation and the Gompertz equation to fit the growth predictive model of Cladosporium genera in different temperature and relative humidity conditions, and the square root model was fitted based on the two environmental factors. In addition, the models were carried on the analysis to verify the accuracy and feasibility of the established model equation.",

            "text": "With the large-scale use of central air conditioning system and the improvement of people's living standard, more and more attention has been paid to the increasingly serious problem of indoor air pollution. Studies showed that air handing unit is an important source of microorganisms for indoor biological pollution, and some microorganisms tend to stay in the dust of air conditioning units with the appropriate temperature and humidity environment. The microorganisms grow and then enter the indoor space through the air, resulting in the destruction of indoor air quality [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) conducted a study of 529 buildings, and the research results showed that among the sources of indoor air pollution, central air-conditioning system pollution accounted for 53% 9 . Summary of measurement by Professor Fanger showed that air-conditioning systems accounted for 42% in the indoor pollution sources 10 . Based on the supervision and inspection of air conditioning and ventilation system in the public places of China's 30 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions by China Academy of Building Research and the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, it was found that more than 90% of the central air conditioning systems could not meet China's national sanitary standard 11 . Thus, air conditioning system should eliminate negative impact caused by its own, on this basis, it may relate to positive effect of the ventilation. In recent years, H1N1, SARS and other popular virus spread [12] [13] , and some researches showed that the hygienic, reasonable air conditioning systems were important to reduce damage [14] [15] . Therefore, microbial pollution in central air conditioning system has become a critical topic in the field of indoor air pollution. Studies showed that the filter, cooling coil, humidifier, and cooling tower in central air-conditioning system were easy to microbial breeding [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . In this study, a venue in Dalian was selected as the research object. As the working condition of the air conditioning system was down, the environment parameters were measured, and microorganisms existing on the wind pipe, filtering net, surface cooler, and condensate water, on the floor and in the air were collected. Besides, according to the tested microbial density and the identified genome sequence of collected microorganisms, the hygrothermal response experiment of dominant fungal was detected, and the fitting analysis was carried out based on the prediction model, followed by a series of statistical analysis. The aim of the present study was to clarify characteristics of the microorganisms in air conditioning systems, and the study would be helpful for policymakers and HVAC engineers to develop the appropriate strategies and to conduct the bacteria and fungi characteristic assessments in HVAC system.",

Two measured units were all air system, which only had a coarse efficiency filter, and the unit is also provided with a heater, cooler and fan etc. Both units are the primary return air system and the filters are removable types. The running time of the air conditioning system is from May to October, and the daily operation period is 08:00-21:00. All components are cleaned every two years.

At the same temperature, with the increase of relative humidity, Gompertz model fitting effect is better; the model is well fitted at the temperature of 25 \u00b0C and the fitting effect is better than 20 \u00b0C and 30 \u00b0C temperature conditions. The fitting of Logistic model to the growth of the fungus is better than that of the Gompertz model. The two models are tested by the deviation factor B f and the accuracy factor A f in the mathematical model test. Staphylococcus xylosus were studied by Mcmeekin 45 . They found that when T min is fixed, for each \u03d5 , the relationship between growth rate and temperature can be described by using the square root model. The combined effects of these two variables can be expressed by the modified equation (3):",

(3) Within the experimental temperature and relative humidity, with the increase of relative humidity or temperature, the colony growth of the same strain showed an increasing trend. For the prediction model of the fungus growth, the study found that the overall fitting effect of Logistic model is better, and R 2 values were greater than 0.97. Logistic model for the Cladosporium spp. growth was better than Gompertz model. At the same time, considering the influence of temperature and relative humidity, the square root model can well predict the growth of Cladosporium spp. It provides a theoretical basis for the growth of fungi in the air conditioning system under the hygrothermal environment conditions.",
