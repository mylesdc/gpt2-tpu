            "text": "Mass media reports can induce individual behaviour change during a disease outbreak, which has been found to be useful as it reduces the force of infection. We propose a compartmental model by including a new compartment of the intensity of the media reports, which extends existing models by considering a novel media function, which is dependent both on the number of infected individuals and on the intensity of mass media. The existence and stability of the equilibria are analyzed and an optimal control problem of minimizing the total number of cases and total cost is considered, using reduction or enhancement in the media reporting rate as the control. With the help of Pontryagin's Maximum Principle, we obtain the optimal media reporting intensity. Through parameterization of the model with the 2009 A/H1N1 influenza outbreak data in the 8th Hospital of Xi'an in Shaanxi Province of China, we obtain the basic reproduction number for the formulated model with two particular media functions. The optimal media reporting intensity obtained here indicates that during the early stage of an epidemic we should quickly enhance media reporting intensity, and keep it at a maximum level until it can finally weaken when epidemic cases have decreased significantly. Numerical simulations show that media impact reduces the number of cases during an epidemic, but that the number of cases is further mitigated under the optimal reporting intensity. Sensitivity analysis implies that the outbreak severity is more sensitive to the weight \u03b1 1 (weight of media effect sensitive to infected individuals) than weight \u03b1 2 (weight of media effect sensitive to media items).",

News reports have the potential to modify a community's knowledge of emerging infectious diseases, and affect people's attitudes and behaviours during infectious disease outbreaks [1, 2] . People informed by media reports can take precautions ranging from washing hands, wearing protective masks to avoiding social PLOS contact with infected individuals, to reduce their susceptibility. Informed infective individuals will also take measures to protect themselves from being exposed to others to reduce infectivity. It has been shown that behaviour change during infectious disease outbreaks can curb the effects of infectious diseases in populations [3] .",

A number of studies have employed mathematical models to assess the impact of media reports on emerging infectious disease prevention and control [4, 5, [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] . Recently, Greenhalgh et al. [19] presented a brief and nice commentary on the literature related to awareness and their effects on the dynamics of diseases. In summary, it has been found that there are three main methods being used to incorporate behaviour change in mathematical models due to awareness of disease. In the first method, the incidence rate of the disease is reduced by some factors that depend on the numbers of infected individuals, hospitalized individuals or exposed individuals, due to education about preventative knowledge of the disease through media coverage. The common choice of the reduction factors is a saturated [4, 6, 31, 32] or exponential [20, 24, 27] growth function. For example, Liu et al. [27] incorporated an exponential decreasing factor \u03b2 0 = \u03b2e \u2212a 1 E\u2212a 2 I\u2212a 3 H into the transmission coefficient (with exposed (E), infectious (I), hospitalized (H)) to illustrate the possible mechanism for multiple outbreaks of SARS due to the psychological impact. Cui et al. [32] used the general nonlinear incidence function \u03bc 1 \u2212 \u03bc 2 f(I) to represent the media and education impact on the spread of the infectious disease. In [5] , the authors focused on simple endemic models by modelling the contact rate as a function of the available information on the present and the past disease prevalence.",

However, the relationship between mass media and disease spread can be more complex than these models portray. On one hand, media reporting influences the public awareness of the disease and affects the effectiveness of prevention measures. On the other hand, the severity of the disease has an impact on the degree of mass media reporting. We've known that, in the first and third methods, media impact is modelled through the inclusion of a \"media function\", which is proportional to the number of infected individuals and/or the level of media reports, to reduce the incidence rate through increased protective behaviour. However, it remains unclear as to whether awareness of the number of infections, or the awareness of media reports best modify individual behaviour during an infectious disease outbreak.

The model can be recognized as the combination of the first method and the third method of modelling. In our model, we formulate the novel media function f(I, M, \u03b1 1 , \u03b1 2 ) with \u03b1 i (i = 1, 2) denoting the weight of infected individuals and media reports, and examine their effects on disease spread. Further, we investigate an optimal control problem in order to seek the optimal reporting intensity of information to minimize the number of infected individuals (and costs). We parameterize the proposed model on the basis of the 2009 A/H1N1 data in Shaanxi province of China, and estimate the basic reproduction number and other unknown parameters. A sensitivity analysis is conducted to identify model parameters that most affect the peak magnitude of the epidemic, as well as the total number of infections over the entire epidemic.",

Results are presented in Table 2 and shown in Fig 2. When different periods are considered, the reproduction number varies from 1.8715 to 2.0463. The results indicate that, for each period we consider, the model with both f 1 and f 2 can fit the observed data well. Note that we have chosen to consider the model fits using data from the 3rd to 21st of September in the analysis below. This is done to ensure that we estimate R 0 during the exponential growth phase of the outbreak [33] . Table 1 . This figure shows that the number of infected individuals is greatly reduced when media impact is considered. For example, the peak magnitude is reduced from 2091 to 1225 (1189) when we use the media function f 1 (f 2 ), giving a reduction of 41.4% (43.1%). The total number of infected individuals over one year is also reduced, from 87974 to 74391 (73370). It also follows from Fig 3 that there is no obvious difference on the epidemic prevalence for system (1) with media function f 1 or function f 2 , though the number of media items looks very different for the different media functions, which may be attributed to the small numbers of media items and the small value of the weight of media effects sensitive to the media reports.

With increases in \u03b1 1 or \u03b1 2 , both the peak magnitude of the number of infected individuals and the total number of infections over a year decrease greatly, indicating that the media effect reduces outbreak severity. To identify key parameters that influence the disease infection dynamics, we use Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) and partial rank correlation coefficients (PRCCs) to examine the dependence of the peak magnitude and total number of infections on corresponding model parameters. It follows from Figs 6 and 7 that, despite the fact that the baseline value of the transmission rate \u03b2 and the recovery rate \u03b3 are the most sensitive parameters to the peak magnitude and the total number of infections, parameters related to the media coverage \u03b1 1 , \u03b1 2 , \u03c1, \u03b4 can also significantly affect the results. In particular, increases in the weight of infective cases \u03b1 1 and media reports \u03b1 2 in the media function will significantly Optimal media reporting intensity on mitigating spread of an emerging infectious disease reduce the peak magnitude and total number infections.

Here, we fix the parameter values as listed in Table 1 and employ the Forward-Backward Sweep method. It follows from Fig 9(A) that the optimal control is to continuously strengthen/increase the media reports at the beginning of an epidemic, when the disease starts to spread. A maximum level should then be maintained in times surrounding the peak number of infections, and then it should be slowly weakened as the infection reduces in the population. It is clear that the optimal control is similar for the two different media functions f 1 and f 2 , Optimal media reporting intensity on mitigating spread of an emerging infectious disease however, the optimal media reporting intensity for system (4) with media function f 2 is stronger than that for system (4) with media function f 1 (i.e., u \ufffd 2 > u \ufffd 1 ). Figs 9(B) and 10 show the optimal epidemic curves under the optimal reporting intensity. These figures indicate that the optimal control significantly reduces the peak magnitude and total number of infected individuals. They also show that the peak magnitude appears earlier in time for both media functions f 1 and f 2 . Comparing Fig 3 to Fig 9(B) and Fig 10(A) , we see that, while simply having media reports during an epidemic can greatly reduce the severity of an epidemic, it is further mitigated under the optimal reporting intensity. Moreover, in such a scenario, a stronger media report intensity u \ufffd 2 for media function f 2 gives rise to a greater reduction in peak magnitude and the total number of infected individuals than the media report intensity u \ufffd 1 .",

We found that the basic reproduction number may be underestimated if the media impact is not considered. We also illustrated that the peak magnitude of the endemic would greatly decrease when the mass media function is considered, which has also been demonstrated in [26] . Sensitivity analysis indicated that the severity of the disease outbreak is sensitive to the parameters associated with the media impact (the reporting rate \u03c1, media waning rate \u03b4, weight of media effect sensitive to infected individuals \u03b1 1 , and weight of the media effect sensitive to media items \u03b1 2 ) besides the epidemiological parameters (like transmission rate \u03b2 and Optimal media reporting intensity on mitigating spread of an emerging infectious disease the recovery rate \u03b3). In particular, the outbreak severity is more sensitive to the weight \u03b1 1 than weight \u03b1 2 (shown in Figs 5-7) , indicating that more response to the number of infected individuals will lead to greater reductions in the peak magnitude and the total number of infections.",
