            "text": "Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) is highly immunogenic and able to stimulate both innate and adaptive immune responses. However, its ability to induce adverse effects has held back the use of VSV as a potential vaccine vector. In this study we developed VSV-\u0394P, a safe yet potent replication-defective recombinant VSV in which the phosphoprotein (P) gene was deleted. VSV-\u0394P replicated only in supporting cells expressing P (BHK-P cells) and at levels more than 2 logs lower than VSV. In vivo studies indicated that the moderate replication of VSV-\u0394P in vitro was associated with the attenuation of this virus in the mouse model, whereas mice intracranially injected with VSV succumbed to neurotoxicity. Furthermore, we constructed VSV and VSV-\u0394P expressing a variety of antigens including hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) from Newcastle disease virus (NDV), hemagglutinin (HA) from either a 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza virus (pdm/09) or the avian H7N9. VSV and VSV-\u0394P incorporated the foreign antigens on their surface resulting in induction of robust neutralizing antibody, serum IgG, and hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) titers against their corresponding viruses. These results indicated that VSV with P gene deletion was attenuated in vitro and in vivo, and possibly expressed the foreign antigen on its surface. Therefore, the P gene-deletion strategy may offer a potentially useful and safer approach for attenuating negative-sense RNA viruses which use phosphoprotein as a cofactor for viral replication.",

            "text": "Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) belongs to the family Rhabdoviridae in the genus Vesiculovirus. VSV is an enveloped, bullet-shaped virus with a negative, single-stranded, 11,161-bp RNA genome encoding 5 proteins: nucleocapsid (N), phosphoprotein (P), matrix protein (M), glycoprotein (G) and large RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L) [1, 2] . Infectious VSV can be efficiently recovered by a reverse genetics approach that utilizes multiple plasmids expressing VSV genes [3, 4] . Since the development of the VSV infectious clone, VSV has been considered a vaccine vector candidate due to its inability to undergo genetic recombination and genetic reassortment, and the absence of transforming properties. Furthermore, recombinant VSV can accommodate large or multiple foreign gene inserts in its genome, and has been used to express a variety of viral antigens [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . These recombinants elicit strong humoral and cell-mediated immune responses upon use as vaccines and also mediate protection against their own virus challenge in mice and non-human primates. Along with the ability to generate robust immune responses, VSV naturally infects at mucosal surfaces, enabling the use of intranasal immunization to induce both mucosal and systemic immunity [11] .",

            "text": "Based on the neurological effects, research objectives have shifted towards developing VSV with decreased virulence for use as a human vaccine vector [7, 8, [21] [22] [23] [24] . These attenuated VSV can undergo a single or multiple rounds of infection and viral transcription, however, possibly inducing neurotoxicity. We have therefore developed a novel strategy to eliminate viral transcription and strongly reduce the risk of VSV neurotoxicity by deleting the P gene in the VSV genome (VSV-\u0394P). This P gene is known to encode an essential cofactor responsible for an active polymerase complex. Deletion of the P gene should completely abrogate transcription of VSV in infected normal cells while allowing for host immune response activation, leading to a safer yet equally effective vaccine compared to wild-type VSV. We have been able to show that VSV-\u0394P replicated strictly in supporting cells and caused no neurovirulence in mice. More importantly, we demonstrate that VSV-\u0394P expressing hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) from Newcastle disease virus (NDV) or hemagglutinin (HA) from a 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza virus (pdm/09) or the avian H7N9 were able to incorporate HN or HA on their surface. Moreover, mice immunized with these recombinant viruses generated robust immune responses similar to their replication-competent counterparts.",

The P gene fragment was removed and the rest of the VSV genome was self-ligated. pVSV-\u0394P was constructed by inserting the mCherry gene from pmCherry-C1 (Clontech, USA) into XhoI and NheI sites. Similarly, pVSV-\u0394P-HN, pVSV-\u0394P-HA1 and pVSV-\u0394P-HA7 were generated by insertion of HN (amplified from NDV strain LaSota), pdm/09 H1 HA (amplified from A/Nonthaburi/102/2009 RNA) and H7 HA (synthesized by Bio Basic Inc, Canada, based on A/Shanghai/02/2013 (H7N9) HA), respectively. For construction of pVSV-HN, pVSV-HA1 and pVSV-HA7, HN, H1 or H7 HA genes were inserted into the original pVSV-XN2 at the same position. All VSVs were then recovered based on the method described previously [3, 28] . Bulk amplification of plaque-purified VSVs were subsequently performed by infecting either BHK-21 cells with VSVs or BHK-P cells with VSV-\u0394Ps at an MOI of 0.01 for 24 h.

They showed that VSV with the P gene deletion could not be propagated in normal BHK-21 cells, except by co-propagation of VSV-\u0394P with VSV-\u0394G or VSV-\u0394L. The VSV-\u0394P work was only briefly explored, and the characteristics of the virus, such as growth kinetics and titers or immune induction in vivo, were not described despite the very promising nature of its attenuation. The most important aspect of attenuation by P gene deletion is the impact on viral transcription. While P is a structural protein, our data revealed no mCherry expression by VSV-\u0394P-mCherry in BHK-21 cells even 48 hours after infection, suggesting that the P molecule packaged in each viral particle is insufficient for driving any appreciable level of protein expression. No sign of neuropathogenesis in mice intracranially injected with VSV-\u0394P was observed either, due to restriction of VSV-\u0394P replication to P-expressing cells. While we presume that no viral replication occurred in mice brain tissue, virus replication in such brain tissue needs to be further examined. Overall, VSV-\u0394P appears to be replication-deficient both in vitro and in vivo.",

Similarly, the combination of methionine 51 deletion in the M gene and G CT-truncation yielded a titer of 5\u00d710 3 pfu/ml in a type I IFN-signaling-competent cell line [23] . Although no neurotoxicity was found in VSV-treated immune-competent mice, these viruses still possess an intrinsic ability to replicate.

In contrast, cells permanently expressing M have not been reported, presumably due to the association of M with some of the cytopathic effects of VSV infection, such as microtubule disassembly leading to cell rounding [35] . Similarly, as G is capable of mediating cell-cell fusion [36] , cell lines stably and constitutively expressing G are simply not viable.

This difference was expected, as levels of P expression in the cell line were likely lower compared to the amount of P generated during wild-type virus infection. In addition, to function as a polymerase cofactor for viral RNA replication and transcription, P needs to be in phosphorylated form [38] . However, P in BHK-P cells might not be properly phosphorylated, and therefore may be less efficient in supporting VSV-\u0394P replication. It may be possible to improve VSV-\u0394P yields with strategies such as using stronger promoters, codon optimization or expressing phosphomimetic P. Nevertheless, VSV-\u0394P yielded from BHK-P cells was comparable to that from the inducible G stable cell line, where VSV-\u0394G expressing CD4 or CC4 was generated at titers in the range of 0.5\u00d710 6 to 1.0\u00d710 6 pfu/ml [37] . In Vitro and In Vivo Attenuation of VSV by Phosphoprotein Deletion VSV-\u0394P was shown to express H1 HA on the viral surface by Western blot analysis. However, we could not observe the hemagglutination activity of VSV-\u0394P-HA (data not shown). We speculate that red blood cell binding may require the presence of both HA and NA, as NA has been shown to remove oligosaccharides adjacent to the HA receptor-binding pocket, thereby facilitating the binding between HA and sialic acid [39] . This was also observed in a previous study using VSV expressing HA of WSN influenza virus, where the virus was not able to bind red blood cells unless the cells used to generate the virus were treated with NA [40] . The observation that our VSV-HN and VSV-\u0394P-HN viruses, which possess both hemagglutinin and neuraminidase function, exhibited hemagglutination activity strongly supports this theory.",
