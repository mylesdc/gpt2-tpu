Of the control animals that eventually converted to a case, 24 the mean health score as controls was 1.3 \u00b1 1.01, which was similar to the mean of all controls 25 (P = 0.35). The mean health scores of the male cases was 6.52 \u00b1 1.37, which was similar to the 26 health scores for female cases (6.6 \u00b1 1.34, P = 0.27). In contrast, the mean health score of the 27 male controls was lower (1.06 \u00b1 0.82,) than for the female controls (1.2 \u00b1 0.8, P = 0.0035). 28 The mean age of the CA Holstein BRDC cases at diagnosis was 46.4 \u00b1 8.5 days, which was very 29 similar to that of the controls (47.9 \u00b1 8.5 days). The mean age of the cases and controls at 30 sampling differed (P = 0.0001) for the CA calves. The mean age of the male cases was 45.9 \u00b1 8.0 31 days, which differed (P = 0.03) from the mean age of the female cases (47.1 \u00b1 9.1). Among 32 controls, the mean age of males (47.9 \u00b1 8.4 days) did not differ (P = 0.96) from females (47.8 \u00b1 33 8.7 days). Likewise, there was no difference (P = 0.10) in the proportion of cases among males 34 (48.37%) and females (52.18%). 35 All of the NM calves were recorded as being anatomically female and were housed in one of 36 three calf raising facilities. Samples were collected at three calf raising programs that received 37 calves from multiple dairy farms. The first calf raising facility received calves from 7,000 of their 38 own dairy cows raised at three nearby locations. These calves were housed in California-style 39 hutches facing to the south on a gradual slope to facilitate drainage. In the winter the hutch 40 tops were lowered and the bottoms boarded up to help protect the calves from the wind. 41 Calves were watered and assessed three times per day and fed twice a day with heated milk 42 The second NM calf raising facility was similar in that calves originated from 13,000 cows from 3 48 dairies. These calves received a gallon of colostrum via esophageal tube and were intranasally 49 vaccinated against IBR as well as PI3, with vitamin B12 and Penicillin administration upon 50 arrival. Calves were housed in bungalow-style hutches made of wood that faced south on a 51 slope and had a small wire panel yard attached to the hutch. Calves were watered twice a day 52 and assessed once a day. Calves were fed a mixture of hospital milk and milk replacer. At 30 53 days of age calves were vaccinated with a modified live culture of Pasteurella haemolytica and 54 Pasteurella multocida, and at 45 and 70 days of age calves received a modified live vaccine for 55 IBR, BVD types I and II, PI3 and BRSV. Calves we4re weaned at 70 days of age. 56 The third NM calf raising facility received calves from a single 3000 cow dairy. Calves were 57 housed in plastic hutches, each with a wire yard attached to it. Hutches were not set on a slope 58 and were oriented east during the summer months and south during the winter months. Calves 59 were given 1 gallon of colostrum within the first hour of birth, and 2 quarts of colostrum were 60 given the following morning and afternoon. Calves were fed and watered twice a day. Milk, 61 consisting of pasteurized fresh milk and milk replacer, was heated and fed to the calves twice a 62 day. Calf health was assessed twice a day . The vaccination protocol for this facility included an   63  intranasal modified live vaccine for IBR and PI3 the week the calves were received, a modified   64   live vaccine for IBR, BVD types I & II, BRSV, Chauvoei-Septicum-Novyi-Sordelli-Perfringens Types C &D bacterin was administered at week 67 7. Calves were weaned at 80 days of age. 68 The mean health scores of the control heifers in NM were 1.7 \u00b1 0.9, and 8.3 \u00b1 1.5 for the cases. 69 The mean health score for controls (that ultimately converted to cases) at the tim87)e of 70 selection was 1.6 \u00b1 1.2, as compared to mean scores of 8.1 \u00b1 1.5 after conversion and 71 reclassification to case status. Mean health score for the CA and NM controls differed (P = 72 0.001), as did the mean health score for the cases (P < 0.0001), which was due to higher scores 73 in NM (Supplementary Table 1 ). The proportion of control calves that converted to cases was 74 not different (P = 0.61) between CA and NM. The mean age for calves diagnosed as a BRDC case 75 was 53.5 \u00b1 13.0 days, which did not differ (P = 0.7) from the mean age of the matched controls 76 when sampled (53.1 \u00b1 11.6 days). The mean age at which the calves were sampled was 77 different between the California and New Mexico populations for both cases and controls (P < 78 0.0001). 79 The combined California and New Mexico population consisted of 2,763 Holstein calves; 1,505 80 females and 1,258 males, which included 1,384 controls and 1,379 cases. The mean health 81 score for controls and cases was 1.3 \u00b1 0.9 and 7.1 \u00b1 1.6, respectively. The mean case and mean 82 control health scores for the combined population differed from the California (P < 0.0001) and There was also no effect (P > 0.05) when month of sampling was included in the GBLUP 225 analyses. However, when season was included in the GBLUP model, a nominally significant 226 effect of season for CA was detected (P = 0.02), with no similar effect observed for NM or the 227 combined population (P > 0.05). When further evaluated, the effect of season for CA was 228 determined to be due to the difference in the mean age of animals across the seasons. In the winter. By including season in the GBLUP model, some of the age differences were removed, 231 resulting in a significant result even though the effect was due to age. Therefore, the correct 232 analytical model was to include age (and sex) in the additive model, but not an effect for season 233 of sampling (Supplementary Table 3 Note on Supplemental Q-Q and P-P Plots: The trend observed in the Q-Q and/or P-P plots whereby the 315 expected -log10 P-values are larger than the observed was determined to be an issue related to the 316 Holstein breed and/or the samples utilized. Briefly, LD pruning prior to GWAA mitigates this trend, 317 which has never been observed during any of our ongoing QTL GWAA for beef cattle (i.e., multiple 318 breeds, thousands of samples) using the same methods employed in this study. Unfortunately, very few 319 Q-Q / P-P plots exist in the literure for U.S. Holstein cattle, and because we genotyped and analyzed \u2265 320 2,596 holstein calves, we are confident that this result will be replicated. Finally, the trend whereby the 321 expected -log10 P-values are larger than the observed -log10 P-values is less noticeable when using a 322 PCA-based approach to stratification control during a GWAA because, given the number of components 323 used, these PCA methods are not as exhaustive at correcting for stratification, as is the genomic 324 relationship matrix.",

The mean age of the combined cases and controls 84 differed (P = 0.01) between the ages of the cases and controls in the combined population. most common organisms detected in the cases were Mycoplasma spp. (64.6% in CA, 89 57.4% in NM), and Pasturella multocida (36.3% in CA, 61%in NM). These two organisms were 90 also the most frequently detected in the controls. Mycoplasma spp. was detected in 57.1% of 91 controls in CA and 48.7% of controls in NM, whereas Pasturella multocida was detected in 92 23.6% and 54.8% of controls in CA and NM, respectively. Mycoplasma spp. were the most 93 common organism detected in the combined CA and NM population for both cases (62.6%) and 94 controls (54.8%), followed by Pasturella multocida, with 43% of cases and 32% of controls 95 identified as being diagnostically positive for this organism. 96 The proportions of the remaining pathogens detected in each population were dissimilar 97 among cases and controls. All detected pathogens were found to be present as commensal 98 organisms (at some level) among the controls, with the exception of bovine viral diarrhea virus 99 and bovine herpes viruses 1 & 2, which were either not detected in the cases (bovine herpes 100 virus) or were detected in only very few individuals (bovine viral diarrhea virus). The odds ratio, 101 computed as the odds of BRDC given the presence of a pathogen in the combined CA and NM 102 population, ranged from 1.4 for Mycoplasma spp., to 4.9 for Histophilus somni. The relatively 103 small number of calves for which H. somni was detected may have resulted in an inflation of the 104 odds ratio. The mean odds ratio for all seven detected pathogens was 2.5. Aerobic Bacteria and Mycoplasma Culture and qPCR 106 For the CA samples, aerobic bacterial cultures were performed by plating the transport media 107 (Brucella broth) from the mid nasal and deep pharyngeal swabs onto sheep blood agar and 108 chocolate agar for 48 hours at 37 o C. Initial typing of organisms was based on colony 109 morphology, and subsequently confirmed with biochemical testing. Mycoplasma spp. were 110 cultured in an enrichment broth for 48 hours, plated on modified Hayflick media, and grown in 111 a CO 2 incubator at 37 o C for 7 days. Mycoplasma species were identified based on colony 112 morphology and confirmed with digitonin and Diene's Stain. Quantitative PCR for respiratory 113 pathogens was set up to identify bovine herpes virus-1 (BHV-1) [82], BVDV [83], BRSV [84]NM samples, deep pharyngeal swabs were placed in a 10% glycerol Brucella 117 broth transport media and kept on ice and transported to the Bacteriology Section at 118 Washington Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory. Swabs were used to inoculate the glycerol 119 media in Columbia Blood Agar (CBA) plates and Columbia Selective Agar (CSA, selective medium 120 used for the isolation of Pasteurella, Mannheimia, Bibersteinia, and Histophilus spp). 121 Mycoplasma broth was also inoculated by pouring in the glycerol media. CBA, CSA and 122 mycoplasma broth were incubated at 35 \u02daC in CO 2 . CBA and CSA were observed for two days, 123 growing colonies that phenotypically indicated the presence of members of the Pasteurellaceae 124 family, Streptococcus spp with alpha haemolysis, Trueperella pyogenes and others. Non-fermenter Gram-negative rods were isolating in CBA and MacConkey agar and incubated of incubation the mycoplasma broth was sub-cultured in mycoplasma 128 plates with a Dacron swab, and a digitonin disk was placed into the agar surface. Mycoplasma 129 plates were incubated for 48 -72 hours at 35\u02daC in CO 2 . After incubation, the inhibition zone 130 around the digitonin disk was measured and Diene's stain was performed. If the inhibition zone 131 was \u2265 15mm and the Diane's stain showed the classical mycoplasma colony morphology, the 132 microorganism was identified as Mycoplasma spp. The mycoplasma broth was sent to PCR EIGENSTRAT analyses, quality control filtering for the 2014 California calves for the 136 EIGENSTRAT [72] analysis resulted in the removal of animals with a genotyping call rate < 95% 137 (n=46). In addition, 5 animals were identified as Klinefelter XXY calves and 3 calves possessed a 138 phenotypic gender that differed from that predicted by their genotypes, resulting in their 139 removal from the study. The mean genotype call rate for the remaining 1,958 calves (1,225 140 males and 733 females from the California population) was 99.3%. Of the 739 New Mexico 141 calves, 2 calves were identified as putative Klinefelter calves and removed, and 2 were removed 142 due to gender differences between their reported phenotypes and genotypes. Forty-seven 143 animals were removed for possessing a genotype call rate less than 95% leaving 344 cases and 144 348 controls with a mean genotype call rate of 99.4%. Quality control filtering of SNPs for the 145 EIGENSTRAT analysis was performed individually for each population, and removed any regression analyses, all dairy calf genotypes (CA + NM) and diagnostic data were combined 151 into a single file for quality control analyses and filtering. Calves possessing an overall genotype 152 call rate < 0.90 were removed. Thereafter, we filtered SNPs with MAF < 0.001, a call rate < 153 0.85, and/or those that deviated from Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (Fisher's exact HWE P < 1 x 154 10 -100 ). Calves with gender, birthdate, and/or other disparities were also removed. The 155 potential for male gender disparities were initially predicted by X chromosome heterozygosity > 156 0.02. Calves exhibiting overt evidence of Klinefelter's syndrome or technical problems, as 157 evidenced by extensive X chromosome heterozygosity and high Y chromosome SNP call rates (> 158 0.50), were subsequently removed. However, two NM calves originally recorded as males 159 following field observations produced evidence for X chromosome heterozygosity > 0.02. While 160 both calves produced Y chromosome genotypes, they possessed less X chromosome 161 heterozygosity than 99.9% (n = 704) of all phenotypically unambiguous NM females (n = 705), 162 suggesting that this result may be due to missassemblies of the X chromosome, 163 expansions/duplications, or other unknown anomolies. We conducted EMMAX-GRM and FvR 164 analyses treating these two calves alternately as both male and female for comparison. At the 165 conclusion of our quality control analyses, 2,682 Holstein calves (n = 1,975 CA; n = 707 NM) and 166 651,637 SNPs remained for BRDC case-control GWAA using EMMAX and FvR regression. The final ratio of cases to controls was nearly 1potential population stratification that may lead to spurious GWAS results, principal 170 component analyses (PCA) (i.e., see SupplementaryFigures 1 and 2), quantile-quantile (Q-Q)Supplementary Figure 3) and probability-probability (P-P)(Supplementary Figures 4 and 5) 172 plots were used. In addition, genomic inflation factors were calculated to evaluate population 173 stratification in each of the individual and the combined populations. The PCA for EIGENSTRAT 174 was conducted using a reduced number of SNPs (185,481 SNPs for California, 201,552 SNPs for 175 New Mexico and 187,609 SNPs for the combined data sets) which were obtained using the LD 176 pruning procedure implemented in PLINK [85]. This reduction in SNPs decreased the level of LD 177 between SNPs and reduced the squared correlation between SNPs to r 2 < 0.75. The PCA and 178 genomic inflation factors were computed using EIGENSOFT [72]. The Q-Q plots were created in 179 R where the expected P-value (for each SNP) was compared to the observed P-value on a GBLUP analyses [70], quality control filtering of SNPs was also performed jointly for 182 both the CA and NM populations. All SNPs with MAF < 0.001, with a call rate < 0.85, or that 183 deviated from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium with a statistic of \uf063 2 1 > 100 (P < 1.52 x 10 -23 ) were 184 removed. These edits left a total of 654,044 SNPs for both the California and New Mexico 185 calves. Animals were filtered if they possessed a genotype call rate < 0.90, had an mean 186 autosomal heterozygosity > 0.40, or were detected to be putative Kleinfelter calves via having a 187 non-paX (pseudo-autosomomal) chromosome heterozygosity > 0.03 and a Y chromosome SNP call rate > 0.50. These filters left a total of 2,703 animals of which 1,239 were male and 1to evaluating the effects of age, gender, and the proportion of males and females in 194 the case-control groups, we also evaluated season and month to determine if either had an 195 effect on the loci identified as being associated with BRDC susceptibility. As it is well known that 196 the prevalence of BRDC is affected by season, the study was purposely designed to eliminate 197 any seasonal effects by equally sampling cases and controls within each month/season. This 198 eliminates the potential confounding effect of differences in prevalence. However, the loci 199 identified as being associated with BRDC susceptibility may be altered if the pathogens that 200 elicit BRDC differ by season or month. This was tested for with EIGENSTRAT where month or 201 season was coded as a categorical covariate and then the top 2000 SNP markers were 202 compared to the analyses which did not include month or season. When comparing the overlap 203 of the top 2000 SNP in the EIGENSTRAT analysis that didn't include season and the analyses 204 that did, the concordance of the SNPs was 95.7% for CA, 90.5% for NM and 97% for the 205 combined population. The same comparison for month the animal was sampled demonstrated 206 that 89.6% of the CA, 90.6% of the NM and 94.1% of the combined population SNPs were 207 shared between the analyses. 208 The potential effect of season and month on the GWAA results was also directly evaluated 209 within the EMMAX-GRM and FvR approaches. The inclusion of month and season within an 210 additive EMMAX-GRM model produced results that were highly concordant with a model that 211 included only sex and age. Specifically, 96%-99% of the top 2000 SNPs were shared when 212 season or month was either included or excluded in the EMMAX-GRM analyses for the CA, NM 213 and combined populations. Moreover, all of the same top 30 SNPs (Supplementary Table 2) 214 were identified as being associated with BRDC susceptibility regardless of whether season or 215 month were included or excluded in the EMMAX-GRM model for all study populations. 216 Inclusion of month or season also did not impact the pseudo-heritability estimates for CA, NM, 217 or the combined cohort. Similarly, inclusion of season or month also had little impact on the 218 FvR results, with the same top 30 SNPs identified as being associated with BRDC susceptibility 219 Supplementary",
