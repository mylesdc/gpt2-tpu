Efficient recoding usually requires an RNA pseudoknot located several nucleotides downstream from the recoding site. To assess the strategic importance of the recoding pseudoknots, we have carried out a large scale genome-wide analysis in which we used an in-house developed program to detect all possible H-type pseudoknots within the genomic mRNAs of 81 animal viruses. Pseudoknots are detected downstream from \u223c85% of the recoding sites, including many previously unknown pseudoknots. \u223c78% of the recoding pseudoknots are the most stable pseudoknot within the viral genomes. However, they are not as strong as some designed pseudoknots that exhibit roadblocking effect on the translating ribosome. Strong roadblocking pseudoknots are not detected within the viral genomes. These results indicate that the decoding pseudoknots have evolved to possess optimal stability for efficient recoding. We also found that the sequence at the gag-pol frameshift junction of HIV1 harbors potential elaborated pseudoknots encompassing the frameshift site. A novel mechanism is proposed for possible involvement of the elaborated pseudoknots in the HIV1 PRF event.",

In \u22121 frameshifting, only a defined percentage of the translating ribosomes shifts to the \u22121 reading frame and translates the downstream gene. This percentage is referred to as the frameshifting efficiency, which dictates the molar ratio of viral structural and enzymatic proteins, encoded by the gag and pol gene, respectively. For efficient \u22121 frameshifting to happen, two cis-acting elements programmed in the overlapping region of the mRNA are often required to signal the translating ribosomes to shift backward by one nucleotide. The first element is a heptanucleotide stretch termed \"slippery sequence\" with a typical composition of X XXY YYZ (XXX and YYY: a stretch of three identical nucleotides; the triplets indicate the 0 reading frame).

A secondary signal called \"stimulator\" is usually required in the form of an RNA structure downstream from the frameshift site, separated by a spacer region (typically 6-9 nucleotides in length). In some cases, the stimulator is a conventional stem-loop structure, but most often it is a pseudoknot, which is a structural motif of RNA formed when a stretch of nucleotides within a loop region in a secondary structure basepairs with residues outside that loop [8] [9] [10] (Figure 1 ). The indispensable role of a downstream pseudoknot in efficient \u22121 frameshifting has been established in a large number of RNA viruses including members from the retroviridae family, coronaviridae family (such as SARS CoV), totiviridae family, and Luteoviridae family [5, [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . Although a 3 RNA structure is utilized as a frameshift stimulator in most cases, absence of such a structure has also been reported in efficient frameshifting such as in the case of Semliki Forest virus [19] . The involvement of RNA pseudoknots in stop codon readthrough has also been established. In the gag-pol junction region of Moloney murine leukemia virus (Mo-MuLV), a pseudoknot located several nucleotides 3 to the UAG termination codon of the gag gene was found to be required [20, 21] . Strong similarities between the sequences in the gagpol region of MuLV and the other viruses of the readthrough retrovirus group imply that the other readthrough retroviruses may use a similar pseudoknot structure to stimulate the stop codon readthrough as well [22, 23] .",

In the MMTV pseudoknot, L3 consists of an unpaired adenosine that is intercalated between the two stems S1 and S2 thereby inducing a bent conformation of the pseudoknot. In the SRV-1 pseudoknot, L3 is absent, and the two stems S1 and S2 stack coaxially to form a quasicontinuous helix. The luteoviral pseudoknots are small and compact (with only 4-5 basepairs in S1 and 3 basepairs in S2). Extensive S1-L2 and S2-L1 interactions are present in all of the luteoviral pseudoknots. Overall, the available structures do not share common structural feature(s) other than the fact that they all adopt the general pseudoknotted topology. These results indicate that the frameshift stimulating ability of a pseudoknot is not dependent on its specific or unique structural feature(s). Several lines of evidence suggest that the thermodynamic stability and mechanical strength of a frameshift stimulating pseudoknot to resist unwinding by the helicase activity of the ribosome may correlate more strongly with frameshift stimulation.",

In a low resolution (\u223c16\u00c5) structure, obtained by cryoelectron microscopy, of mammalian 80S ribosome in complex with the infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) pp1a/pp1b pseudoknot frameshift signal, as well as eEF2 occupying the A-site and a tRNA occupying the P-site [35] , it is found that the paused pseudoknot is stuck at the entrance of the mRNA tunnel of the ribosome, and the D-helix of the P-site tRNA bends heavily toward the 3 direction (compared to a structure with nonframeshift stimulating stem-loop RNA). The opposing forces placed by translocation and the wedged pseudoknot may create local tension on the mRNA, which can be relaxed by frameshifting. The superior ability of pseudoknots to pause ribosomes is presumably due to the unique pseudoknotted topology. The presence of stem2 greatly limits the rotational freedom of stem1, making the pseudoknots harder to unwind by the translating ribosomes than simple stem-loop structures with comparable thermodynamic stability [36] .",

The requirement for extra energy input may explain why the pseudoknot is more resistant to unfolding by optical tweezers (presumably by ribosomes as well). The mechanical strength of pseudoknots was further correlated with the frameshift stimulating ability of the pseudoknots [37, 38] . By extrapolating the data, it was proposed that pseudoknots with certain mechanical strength would be able to stimulate \u22121 frameshifting of 100% efficiency, and pseudoknots with even higher mechanical strength would stall the ribosomes completely like a roadblock (with or without frameshifting), leading to translation termination [38] .",

By investigating a number of designed pseudoknots with varied numbers of basepairs in the stems, it was shown that the strongest pseudoknots (as predicted) only induced limited frameshifting, as judged by the amount of full-length frameshifted products. However, analysis of the pulse labeled proteins revealed that a significant fraction of the ribosomes did shift frames but failed to pass the pseudoknot structures to continue translation; the strength of the pseudoknots correlated not only with the fraction of frameshifted ribosomes but also the roadblocking effect. Based on these observations, it was proposed that the optimal frameshifting efficiency would be produced when a balance of the two effects is achieved. According to this hypothesis, the naturally occurring frameshift stimulating pseudoknots should have optimal mechanical strength to cause the right amount of translating ribosomes to shift frames but should not be too strong in order to ensure that the ribosomes are not stalled permanently. It is also implied that strong pseudoknots that exhibit a roadblocking effect should not be present in the coding regions of mRNAs.",

The putative frameshift stimulator pseudoknot in human astrovirus as shown in the Recode database has three mismatched pairs in a row within a five-basepair stem2, which explains why it is not detected by our program.

The involvement of the LV and LDV pseudoknots in efficient frameshifting was established [44, 45] . The pseudoknots in EAV, LV, LDV, and PRRSV are comparable to each other in terms of the lengths of the spacer region, S1, S2, L1, and L3, and the calculated stem free energies. The lengths of L2 are more varied. The length of L2 in EAV (68 nt) is substantially longer than those in other viruses of this family. Interestingly, we find that this L2 sequence harbours a potential pseudoknot with 31 nt (Figure 2 ). This pseudoknot seems very credible because it is very similar to the structurally well characterized T2 bacteriophage gene 32 mRNA autoregulatory pseudoknot [46] and the SRV-1 gagpro frameshift stimulating pseudoknot [24, 25] . Moreover, this potential pseudoknot, when placed in an \"up-side-down\" orientation, stacks just right on top of the stem1 of the frameshifting pseudoknot. Stacking of the four stem regions of the two pseudoknots creates a quasi-continuous double helix of 28 basepairs in length. The slippery sequence in EAV (G UUA AAC) is somewhat deviated from the consensus slippery sequence of X XXY YYZ found in most other viruses. Whether the elaborate arrangement of pseudoknots in EAV plays any role in regulating frameshifting efficiency, and if it does, whether it is related to the \"atypical\" slippery sequence, await further investigations. All of the frameshift stimulating pseudoknots in EAV, LV, LDV, and PRRSV rank first among all of the potential pseudoknots identified within the fulllength genomic RNAs.",

The two alpharetroviruses Avian leukosis virus (ALV) and Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) have very similar sequences at the gag-pol frameshift junction and both have a pseudoknot. The pseudoknot in RSV as a frameshift stimulator has been established [51] . The ALV and RSV pseudoknots contain a very long L3 (52 nt) which is much longer than those in most other known frameshift stimulator pseudoknots. Due to the unusual length of L3 (not within the default range), the ALV and RSV frameshift stimulator pseudoknots initially were not detected. They were detected after we increased the upper limit for L3 to 60 nt. Both pseudoknots ranked 1st among all possible pseudoknots within the viral genomes. The RSV and ALV pseudoknots as shown in Table 1 leave only one nucleotide in the spacer, which is too short to position the slippery sequence at the active site of the ribosome while leaving the pseudoknot at the entrance of the mRNA tunnel based on model building studies [13, 52] .

Using the default ranges for stems and loops, potential pseudoknots were detected downstream from the gag-pro frameshift site in all viruses but BLV (not shown). However, credibility of the detected pseudoknots is questionable due to the lack of appropriate spacer between the slippery sequence and the pseudoknot. In view of the fact that the previously reported stem-loop structures seem to be conserved in all four viruses, we increased the upper limit for L2 to 85 nt and performed another search. Interestingly, potential pseudoknots with decent stability were detected downstream from the gag-pro frameshift site in all four viruses (shown in Table 1 ); moreover, the detected pseudoknots are all formed by basepairing of a stretch of nucleotides in the loop of the previously reported stem-loop structure with a complimentary sequence 61-83 nt downstream.",

In many of these viruses, a frameshift or readthrough stimulator pseudoknot was verified or predicted previously (as documented in the Recode database). All but one of these pseudoknots were detected by our program. The missed case is in human astrovirus, in which the predicted framshift stimulator pseudoknot by the Recode database is very weak. Importantly, our approach of pseudoknot detection was not restricted to a limited sequence window downstream from the known frameshift or readthrough recoding sites. Instead, the program detects all possible pseudoknots within the fulllength viral genomic mRNAs. The effectiveness and reliability of our approach are proven by the fact that almost all of the previously documented frameshift or readthrough stimulator pseudoknots are detected. Interestingly, we also detected quite a number of putative frameshift stimulator pseudoknots that were not known before. Overall, potential pseudoknots were detected downstream from most (\u223c90%) of the established or putative frameshift or readthrough sites (the gag-pro and pro-pol sites in the same virus are counted as two different sites). Some of these detected pseudoknots may not actually exist. However, the high percentage of possible pseudoknots detected downstream from the strategically important frameshift or readthrough sites still overwhelmingly proves that pseudoknots are the most common stimulators for efficient \u22121 ribosomal frameshifting and readthrough.",

            "text": "Since all possible pseudoknots within the full-length viral genomic mRNAs are detected in a blind search, the results from this study provide a new way to assess the significance and uniqueness of the frameshift or readthrough stimulator pseudoknots in an unbiased manner. As shown in Table 1 , in \u223c78% of the viruses, the pseudoknot detected downstream from the frameshift or readthrough site rank 1st or 2nd among all possible pseudoknots within the genome. The pseudoknot with the lowest free energy (\u221248.7 kcal/mol) in Table 1 is found in Lelystad virus. The detected pseudoknot downstream from the pro-pol framshift site in HTLV-I/STLV-I ( Figure 2 , not listed in Table 1 ) has an even lower free energy of \u221254.2 kcal/mol. This pseudoknot is the most stable pseudoknot among all the possible pseudoknots (regardless of locations of the pseudoknots within the viral genomes) detected in this study. In comparison, the artificial strong pseudoknots that can act as ribosomal roadblocks described in a previous study [40] has a calculated free energy of \u221273.9 kcal/mol (22 bp in S1 and 6 bp in S2). Apparently, the frameshift or readthrough stimulator pseudoknots in a lot of viruses have evolved to become the most stable pseudoknot within the viral genomic mRNAs; but at the same time they are not too strong. These pseudoknots seem to have optimal stability to stimulate the right amount of frameshifting and readthrough and subsequently be unfolded by the translating ribosomes. In other viruses in which the detected frameshift or readthrough stimulator pseudoknot ranks lower or no pseudoknot is detected downstream from the frameshift site, the most stable potential pseudoknots all have a calculated free energy value higher than the putative pro-pol framshift stimulator pseudoknot in HTLV-I/STLV-I. These results clearly show that the viral genomic mRNAs do not contain ultra-stable \"roadblocking\" pseudoknots that would significantly stall ribosomes and might induce no-go decay of the mRNAs [40, 62] . It was noticed previously that many naturally occurring pseudoknots (not limited to frameshift and readthrough stimulating pseudoknots) belonged to a structurally related pseudoknot family known as CPK-1, standing for common pseudoknot motif 1 [46, 61] . A typical CPK-1 pseudoknot has a S2 of 6-7 base pairs and a very short L1 of 1-2 nucleotides; L3 is absent therefore the two helical stems S1 and S2 can stack to form a quasicontinuous helix. An inspection of the detected frameshift or readthrough stimulator pseudoknots reveals that more than 40% of these pseudoknots conform to the CPK-1 family ( Table 1 ). The alternative tandem pseudoknots (Figure 3 . Not listed in Table 1 ) in HIV1 and the elaborated pseudoknot in EAV (Figure 2 ) also conform to the CPK-1 family. Interestingly, it was found that the founding member of the CPK-1 family, a pseudoknot in gene 32 mRNA of bacteriophage T2 whose natural biological function is translational autoregulation, was unable to serve as a frameshift stimulator [63] . Most likely, the common features defined by the CPK-1 motif may primarily serve a structural role for maintaining a stable and compact pseudoknotted scaffold upon which diverse biological functions can build on, presumably mainly by the more variable parts of the pseudoknots, including S1 & L2, and possible interactions between them.",

This theory provides a very good explanation for the frequent utilization of CPK-1 type pseudoknots in various viruses. It is clear that while a large number of detected pseudoknots conform to the CPK-1 family, the lengths and compositions of S1 and L2 of these pseudoknots show a fair degree of variations, especially when viruses from different groups are compared. Moreover, additional features could be added to the \"basic\" CPK-1 pseudoknot fold (such as seen in the EAV, HCV229E and SARS pseudoknots) which would make the pseudoknots even more versatile in fine-tuning the frameshifting.",

Intriguingly, another pseudoknot that contains the slippery sequence is detected. This pseudoknot can stack on top of the pseudoknot immediately downstream from the slippery sequence. Given such an elaborated arrangement of tandem pseudoknots (both belonging to the CPK-1 family) and another mutually excluded pseudoknot at the HIV-1 gag-pol frameshift junction, we asked ourselves this question: can we come up with a reasonable hypothesis about the PRF mechanisms in this case that would explain the possible involvement of these pseudoknots?",

Let us assume that the tandem pseudoknots are present at the gag-pol frameshift junction (due to its lower free energy compared to the alternative pseudoknot). These pseudoknots can significantly slow down the translating ribosome when the pseudoknots are being unwound by the ribosome. When the ribosome scans through the unwound mRNA sequence and is approaching the slippery sequence, the top pseudoknot is fully unwound and the stem1 of the bottom pseudoknot should also be disrupted. Stem2 of the bottom pseudoknot remains intact. The six basepairs of this stem2 are actually the same as the first six basepairs in stem1 of the mutually excluded pseudoknot ( Figure 3 ). Now that the tandem pseudoknots are unwound, the alternative pseudoknot can form rapidly (because a large portion of its stem1 is already in place). The newly formed pseudoknot, with an optimal spacer from the slippery sequence, jams the entrance of the mRNA tunnel of the ribosome. This novel mechanism of PRF elegantly explains the results from our bioinformatic study and is consistent with current paradigm of PRF mechanism. Equilibrium of relevant alternative RNA structures has been shown to play a functional role in the regulation of read-through efficiency in murine leukaemia virus, suggesting a general involvement of equilibrium-based mechanism in translational recoding [72] .

Second, the frameshift or readthrough stimulating pseudoknots in most viruses are among the most stable pseudoknots within the viral genomic mRNAs. The stabilities of these pseudoknots have been fine-tuned during evolution to be optimal for the decoding events. Third, pseudoknots of the CPK-1 family occur most frequently. The favorable CPK-1 scaffold can accommodate significant variations (especially in the stem1 and loop2 regions) which are presumably important for the fine-tuning of framshift or readthrough stimulating ability of the pseudoknots. Fourth, some HIV1 viruses may utilize a novel mechanism that involves three pseudoknots to regulate the frameshift efficiency at the gag-pol junction. Results from this study also prove the usefulness of our pseudoknotdetecting program.
