            "text": "The entry of enveloped animal viruses into target cells occurs via fusion of the viral membrane with a cellular membrane. Penetrenes are viral membrane proteins that mediate penetration into the host cell. The penetrenes of enveloped animal viruses can be divided on the basis of common structural motifs into at least three classes. Orthomyxoviruses, retroviruses, paramyxoviruses, arenaviruses, and coronaviruses encode class I penetrenes [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] , which are also known as class I viral fusion proteins or \u03b1-penetrenes. Class I penetrenes contain a \"fusion peptide,\" a cluster of hydrophobic and aromatic amino acids located at or near the amino terminus, an amino terminal helix (N-helix, HR1), a carboxyl terminal helix (C-helix, HR2), usually an aromatic amino acid (aa) rich pre-membrane domain and a carboxyl terminal anchor [1, 7, 2, 8, 9] . Envelope glycoprotein (E) and envelope glycoprotein E1 encoded respectively by members of the Flavivirus genus of the Flaviviridae and the Alphavirus genus of the Togaviridae are class II penetrenes (\u03b2-penetrenes) [10] [11] [12] . Class II penetrenes possess three domains (I-III) comprised mostly of antiparallel \u03b2 sheets, a membrane proximal \u03b1helical stem domain and a carboxyl terminal anchor. The fusion loops of class II penetrenes are internal and located in domain II. Members of the two other Flaviviridae genuses, Hepaciviruses and Pestiviruses, appear on the basis of proteomics computational analyses to encode truncated class II penetrenes [13] . Proteomics computational analyses suggest that the carboxyl terminal glycoproteins (Gc) of bunyaviruses, and similar proteins of tenuiviruses and a group of Caenorhabditis elegans retroviruses, are also class II penetrenes [14] . Additional evidence that bunyavirus Gc are class II penetrenes has been provided [15, 16] .",

The entry glycoprotein (G) of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), a rhabdovirus, contains a fusion domain comprised of \u03b2 sheets, other \u03b2 sheet domains, an extended \u03b1-helical domain, a membrane proximal \u03b1-helical stem domain and a carboxyl terminal anchor [17, 18] . On the basis of sequence similarity it is likely that G of other members of the Rhabdoviridae are also class III penetrenes. Although larger, glycoprotein B (gB) of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and by sequence similarity gB of other herpesviruses, were unexpectedly demonstrated to share several structural features with VSV G [19] . The extended \u03b1-helices in the post-fusion forms of G and gB are involved in trimerization, as is well documented for \u03b1-helices in the postfusion structures of class I penetrenes. The fusion domains of rhabdovirus G and herpesvirus gB are very similar structurally to the fusion domains of class II penetrenes [17] [18] [19] [20] . Therefore, class III penetrenes may share a common progenitor(s) with members of other penetrene classes.",

NPV are further subdivided into group I and II. Baculoviruses encode two distinct penetrenes [21, 22] . Entry proteins of group I NPV are all approximately 64 kilodalton glycoproteins (GP64), and are referred to collectively as GP64 superfamily proteins [23] . Group II NPV and GV encode entry proteins referred to as fusion proteins (F) [22, 24] . Group I NPV often encode both GP64 and F homologues, although in these viruses F is nonfunctional. Autographa california multiple NPV (AcMNPV) lacking GP64 can be pseudotyped by the F protein of Spodoptera exigua MNPV [25] , suggesting that F of group II NPVs and GV can serve as a functional analog of GP64. However, GP64 cannot serve as an analog of F [26] . Baculovirus F are class I penetrenes. Structural similarities exist between baculovirus F, the envelope glycoproteins of insect retroviruses (errantoviruses), the envelope glycoprotein of the gypsy retrotransposon of Drosophila mela-nogaster and other class I penetrenes [24] . Like other class I penetrenes, baculovirus F is present in virions as a homotrimer and synthesized as a precursor (F 0 ), which is subsequently cleaved by furin-like proteases into subunits F 1 and F 2 [27, 28] . Prior studies have not revealed structural relationships between baculovirus GP64 proteins and other penetrenes.",

The genome of THOV comprises six segments of single-stranded, negative-sense RNA. The fourth largest RNA segment of THOV encodes a glycoprotein (GP) that has significant similarity with corresponding proteins of Dhori, Araguari, and Batken viruses and other thogotoviruses. Thogotovirus GP do not share significant sequence similarities with the class I penetrenes, hemagglutinin 2 (HA2) or hemagglutinin-esterase 2 (HE2), encoded by members of the three influenza virus genuses (types A, B and C) of the Othomyxoviridae or the fusion (F) protein or HE2 encoded by members of the Isavirus genus, the fifth orthomyxovirus genus [29] . However, thogotovirus GP share significant sequence similarity with baculovirus GP64, and are included in the GP64 superfamily [30, 31] . Here, we present the results of proteomics computational analyses that suggest that GP64 superfamily members are class III penetrenes.",

Application of PHD to VSV G, a prototypic class III penetrene [17] , reveals that predicted secondary structures ( Fig. 1 , \u03b1-helix and \u03b2-sheets depicted with dashed lines) closely correspond to the structures determined by X-ray crystallography (colored cones and arrows, accuracy; 77.5%). The PHD algorithm predicts that there is an extended \u03b1-helix in THOV GP (aa 284-338; blue cone) and AcMNPV GP64 (aa 284-340). With the exception of this extended \u03b1helix, the ectodomains of the GP64 superfamily proteins are comprised mostly of \u03b2-sheets (colored arrows). Another domain readily identifiable with computational tools in THOV GP and AcMNPV GP64 is the carboxyl terminal transmembrane anchor. TMpred, an algorithm that identifies possible transmembrane helices, assigns significant scores (> 500 is statistically significant) to THOV GP aa 471-491 (score: 2428) and AcMNPV GP64 aa 470-490 (3030), which suggests that these sequences represent the transmembrane anchors (violet cones).

The fusion domains of class II and III penetrenes have a highly similar structure. Therefore, a class III domain nomenclature is used here that can apply to both rhabdovirus G and herpesvirus gB and assigns domain II (IV in the VSV G nomenclature of Roche et al. [17] , I in the HSV-1 gB nomenclature of Heldwein et al. [19] ) as the class III fusion domain as in class II penetrenes. In addition to minor adjustments in the ends of domains, the current class III penetrene numbering also combines two interacting domains into domain III (I + II in Roche's VSV G nomenclature, III + IV in Heldwein's HSV-1 gB nomenclature). The fusion domains of all class II or III penetrenes contain 1 or 2 prominent fusion loops, which give significant scores on the WWIHS [34] . Sequences with positive WWIHS have a high potential to interface with or disrupt lipid membranes, and therefore are key features of viral penetrenes. Another feature of the fusion domains of class II and III penetrenes is the presence of several dicysteine bonds, which appear to stabilize the overall domain architecture. Regions in THOV GP (aa and AcMNPV GP64 (aa 49-186) with 6 or 8 cysteine residues, plus 1 or 2 sequences with positive WWIHS scores (Fig. 1 , red letters) are likely to represent the fusion domains.",

To further investigate the relationship of isavirus F 1 to the class I penetrenes of other orthomyxoviruses sequence comparisons and molecular modeling were conducted. While the alignment we report here is somewhat different than that proposed previously [29] , it is also consistent with the designation of ISAV F 1 as a class I penetrene (Fig. 4) . ISAV F 1 is shorter in overall length than HA2 of either influenza A or B viruses or HE2 of influenza C viruses, but comparable in length to certain class I penetrenes, such as glycoprotein 2 of Ebola virus. PHD reveals the presence of an extended \u03b1-helical domain that corresponds to the N-helix of influenza A and B viruses. The N-helix of influenza A and B virus HA2 features a leucine zipper, which is involved in trimerization. Other similarities include the presence of a conserved cluster of three cysteine residues (ISAV F aa 382-390) and an aromatic pre-anchor domain (aa 414-421). Of note is the location of the C-helix in ISAV F 1 . In comparison to most other class I penetrenes, the Chelices of influenza viruses in HE2 or HA2 are shorter and located more distally from the C-terminus. A sequence termed the leash is located between the C-helix and the aromatic domain. The formation of the post-fusion configuration of influenza A, B and C virus HA2 or HE2 is best described by a leash-in-grove mechanism, rather than by a six-helix bundle mechanism as in most other class I pen- etrenes [42] . The location of the C-helix in ISAV F 1 suggests that this penetrene shares a common progenitor with HA or HE of influenza A, B and C viruses, and mediates fusion/penetration by a leash-in-grove mechanism.",

            "text": "Proteomics computational analyses suggest that GP64 superfamily proteins are class III penetrenes. Each of the major features common to class III fusion proteins are present in THOV GP and AcMNPV GP64, including internal fusion loops, an extended \u03b1-helical domain, a stem domain and a carboxyl terminal transmembrane domain. These features are located collinearly with these features in VSV G, a prototypic class III penetrene [17, 18] . On the basis of sequence similarities among the GP64 superfamily members it is likely that all are class III penetrenes. Previous studies have suggested a role for the putative extended \u03b1-helix and the leucine zipper motif in GP64 mediated fusion/entry, but did not assign GP64 to any penetrene class [40, 43] . Our results do not corroborate the previous conclusion [43] that a 6 aa sequence (AcM-NPV aa 209-214 in Fig. 1 ) may be the GP64 fusion peptide. Structural models, which include feasible cysteine linkage maps, could be established for THOV GP and AcMNPV GP64. The fusion domains of THOV GP and AcMNPV GP64 appear to be stabilized by cysteine bonds and to contain one or more loops with positive WWIHS scores, features that are characteristic of the fusion domains of both class II and III penetrenes. Glycosylation sites in THOV GP and AcMNPV GP64 appear in similar model locations to the two glycosylation sites of VSV G. Whether or not the secondary and tertiary folding of GP64 superfamily members conform to the domain structure of class III penetrenes will require x-ray crystallographic or other physical structural determinations.",

Therefore, it is likely that there is a common post-fusion (low pH) configuration of class III penetrenes, and that GP64 superfamily members have a post-fusion structure similar to VSV G. In contrast, the prefusion configurations of class I, II and II penetrenes are highly variable. The virion configuration of VSV G is homotrimer arranged in a tripod shape with the fusion domains corresponding to the legs of the tripod [18] .

Current models suggest that low pH may permit reversible bending of VSV G at \"hinge\" regions flanking domain I elevating the fusion loop(s) for insertion into the host membrane [18] . Additional rearrangements of VSV G involve a rotation around the hinge, unfolding of \u03b1-helix A 0 and formation of helix C, interactions of the stem with domains I-III, and formation of higher multimers of the trimers. The order in which these steps occur has not been established. These changes in VSV G are hypothesized to drive deformation of the viral and target membranes. Complete cell membrane:virion membrane fusion follows, allowing entry of the ribonucleoprotein containing the viral genomic RNA. It is likely that GP64 superfamily members follow a mechanism of fusion similar to rhabdovirus G. In the case of HSV-1 gB there may be differences in the rearrangements due to size and cysteine bonding patterns of this class III penetrene [19, 20] . Rearrangements involving a hinge region also occur in class II penetrenes during entry [11, 12, 44] . A mechanism involving rearrangement of functional domains has also been proposed for class I penetrenes [44] as well as the penetrenes of non-enveloped viruses [45] . In the case of influenza A virus HA2, the prototypic class I penetrene, the rearrangement results in formation of a trimer of the N-helices stabilized by an internal leucine zipper [42] . The leash sequence interacts with the external groove of the N-helix trimer. For other class I penetrenes the rearrange brings together the N-and C-helices into a six-helix bundle [46] . The F protein of isaviruses appears to utilize a leash-in-the groove mechanism of membrane fusion.",

While convergence to common structures is possible, penetrenes of enveloped viruses may have evolved from a limited number of common progenitors. Support for this hypothesis comes from the remarkable similarities in the post-fusion structures of the penetrenes in each class, even though the proteins differ dramatically in aa sequence.

One particular lineage then also acquired GP64, which we suggest are class III penetrenes, after the split into the two distinct groups of NVP and GV. Baculoviruses have large DNA genomes, and mechanisms of genetic exchange are distinct for those of RNA viruses. In contrast, the G gene appears to have been present in the common ancestor of all members of the Rhabdoviridae. The similarities detected between GP64 superfamily members and rhabdovirus G are consistent with divergent evolution from a common progenitor, but sequence similarities are insufficient to establish a phylogenic relationship. It is unlikely that there are any recent common ancesters of rhabdoviruses and baculoviruses, and that the class III penetrenes of these viruses were acquired by independent genetic events. The gB of herpesviruses of birds, mammals and reptiles have a high degree of conservation, and are likely to all represent class III penetrenes [19] . A gB-like progenitor probably was present in the common ancestor of these herpesviruses. Other viral glycoproteins (gC, gD, gH/gL) are involved in herpesvirus fusion and entry [50] . These additional entry proteins are differentially distributed among members of the Herpesviridae, and it is likely that they were acquired after acquisition of gB by the herpesvirus progenitor. Herpesvirus gB is nearly twice as long as VSV G or GP64 superfamily proteins. Assuming that the structure of gB is not an extreme example of convergence to a class III penetrene structure, it appears to have undergone extensive insertions of sequences from a common class III progenitor. Alternatively, the class III progenitor could have been a longer protein that deleted sequences prior to independent acquisitions by rhabdoviruses, thogotoviruses or baculoviruses.",
