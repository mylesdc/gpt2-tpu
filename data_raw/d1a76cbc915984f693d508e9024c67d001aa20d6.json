            "text": "Background: There has been increasing debate surrounding mask and respirator interventions to control respiratory infection transmission in both healthcare and community settings. As decision makers are considering the recommendations they should evaluate how to provide the most efficient protection strategies with minimum costs. The aim of this review is to identify and evaluate the existing economic evaluation literature in this area and to offer advice on how future evaluations on this topic should be conducted. Methods: We searched the Scopus database for all literature on economic evaluation of mask or respirator use to control respiratory infection transmission. Reference lists from the identified studies were also manually searched. Seven studies met our inclusion criteria from the initial 806 studies identified by the search strategy and our manual search. Results: Five studies considered interventions for seasonal and/or pandemic influenza, with one also considering SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome). The other two studies focussed on tuberculosis transmission control interventions. The settings and methodologies of the studies varied greatly. No low-middle income settings were identified. Only one of the reviewed studies cited clinical evidence to inform their mask/respirator intervention effectiveness parameters. Mask and respirator interventions were generally reported by the study authors to be cost saving or cost-effective when compared to no intervention or other control measures, however the evaluations had important limitations. Conclusions: Given the large cost differential between masks and respirators, there is a need for more comprehensive economic evaluations to compare the relative costs and benefits of these interventions in situations and settings where alternative options are potentially applicable. There are at present insufficient well conducted cost-effectiveness studies to inform decision-makers on the value for money of alternative mask/respirator options.",

The use of a respirator at all times is also advised for HCWs caring for patients with suspected infectious tuberculosis [3, 4] . These measures are important to protect HCWs as well as to reduce the spread of respiratory infections within hospitals. This can help to reduce both the costs associated with HCW absenteeism and the costs of nosocomial infections.",

For other diseases such as pandemic influenza, reliance on vaccines for protection is not always possible due to time delays in vaccine development, manufacturing and distribution [5] .

Many countries' guidelines recommend fit testing and training sessions for respirator use, but contain limited descriptions of what this should entail [7] . Fit testing can be qualitative or quantitative, with the latter being more expensive and adding a substantial cost to respirator use but not to mask use, which does not require fit testing [10] .",

For this reason, these terms (influenza OR tuberculosis) were used in addition to the generic terms related to infection and transmission, i.e. they did not prevent the identification of articles focused on other infectious respiratory diseases. The final search strategy contained publications until the 1st of August 2014, and used the search terms (as keyword, title or abstract): 'facemask*' (or 'mask*' or 'respirator' or 'N95' or 'non$pharm*' or '{personal protect*}') AND 'economic*' (or 'cost*') AND 'infect*' (or 'transmi*' or 'influenza' or 'tuberculosis').",

From this process, 112 full text articles were considered potentially relevant and their full texts were further reviewed for eligibility. Of these, only six were confirmed to be economic evaluations of mask or respirator infection control interventions. One additional study by Dan et al. [12] was identified from the reference list of a systematic review [13] . These were the main studies used in our qualitative synthesis. Four other costing studies [15] [16] [17] [18] have been published but these examined the cost of the intervention only and were not classified as full economic evaluations (i.e. they did not examine the health impacts or the cost savings from prevented illness). Data from the included studies was independently extracted intro a spread sheet by SM and this was reviewed by ATN. Disagreements were resolved by discussion between these authors.",

Two of the pandemic influenza studies evaluating combinations of interventions in the community concluded that mask/respirator interventions were cost saving in a pandemic setting [11, 22] . The first estimated substantial net savings if 10 % of the population had worn N95 respirators during influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, assuming an effectiveness of 20 % [11] . The second estimated that surgical mask use at 60 % compliance would yield savings of $US100-250 million, far exceeding the estimated intervention cost of $US20 million [20] . The influenza modelling studies by Jones and Adida [22] focused on demonstrating the feasibility of the methods rather than reporting key economic results. The influenza study by Chen and Liao [21] calculated a cost per individual to implement control measures, but limited the inclusion of costs to intervention and outpatient treatments costs.",

            "text": "Of the five influenza studies, Tracht et al. [11] was the only study that attempted to utilise clinical efficacy data. They obtained this from a randomised trial in a university residence setting [26] that found a significant decrease (35-51 %) in influenza-like illness if hand hygiene and medical masks were used together compared to a control, but no difference for medical mask use alone. Tracht et al. [11] uses this result to estimate N95 respirator use provides a 50 % decrease in susceptibility to influenza A(H1N1)pdm09. This may not be robust as the clinical trial measured different outcomes (i.e. influenzalike illness, not influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 cases) and it assumes there is no difference between the efficacy of medical masks and N95 respirators based on the findings of Loeb et al. [27] , although other trials have found evidence that there is a difference [28] . The study by Jones and Adida [22] derived efficacy estimates from the assigned protective factor (APF) measure for N95 respirators released by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health [29] . The APF is estimated from laboratory testing completed by this organisation, including laboratory testing of the quantitative measure of fit when the respirators are fit tested to ensure a protective seal around the wearer's face. Cahill et al. [20] also used efficacy estimates from laboratory investigation data [30] . These estimates may have limited applicability to measuring real-world effectiveness [31] . Dan et al. [12] estimated baseline intervention effectiveness rates of 50, 80 and 90 % as protective equipment (including masks) and isolation precautions were increased. They did not cite data to support these estimates, however a 5 % failure rate where transmission still occurs despite the use of protective equipment and isolation measures, was obtained from a hospital simulation study [32] . Chen and Liao [21] applied a relative efficacy estimate of masks in combination with other control measures which was developed in a previous modelling study that did not cite supporting data for efficacy input assumptions [33] . Other than Tracht et al. [11] , none of the analyses used intervention effectiveness estimates from clinical trials such as the mask/respirator randomised trials that have been published to date on interventions in community and healthcare settings [26] [27] [28] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] .",

The seven evaluations identified have limited utility to advise decision makers on the value for money that masks and respirators offer compared with other health spending choices. This is due to the reporting of results in the form of intermediate outcomes (e.g. case prevented) and the analysis of combinations of masks/ respirators with other protection measures in evaluations [12, 21, 22] . There was also limited inclusion of clinical data to inform the effectiveness estimates and the impact of intervention compliance in the identified studies. Compliance has major implications for a mask/respirator intervention targeting HCWs [9] . For example, obtaining high adherence in HCWs has not been feasible in some high-income countries such as Australia [41] . Variation in HCW mask/respirator compliance has been observed between countries, such as the lower rates seen in UK hospitals compared to Hong Kong and Singapore during influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 [42] . Mask/respirator adherence is primarily driven by perceived susceptibility to the infectious disease threats present [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] .",

However, there is a growing body of research in this area. An initial systematic review on the topic reported pooled efficacy measures from case control studies for N95 respirators and medical masks of 91 and 68 % respectively for the prevention of respiratory viruses [49] . A weakness of this initial review was that the case control studies included in the metaanalysis focused exclusively on SARS [50] . As a consequence, it should not be assumed that the conclusions of this meta-analysis are necessarily true for influenza or other respiratory infections [51] .",

This trial contained only 446 HCWs and may have been underpowered to detect a difference between the arms [28] . Two larger trials not included in this review have been published [28, 36] . One of these by Macintyre et al. [28] , involving 1669 HCWs, found significantly greater protective efficacy for continuous N95 use when compared to continuous medical mask use, but no evidence that selective N95 use was superior to continuous medical mask use for the prevention of clinical respiratory illness [28] .",

In some cases this may not be possible, for example, it is not appropriate to extrapolate clinical trial results for respiratory viruses to tuberculosis and for ethical reasons, randomised trial data cannot be collected on the effectiveness of a respirator intervention in HCWs for tuberculosis prevention. While the use of other types of efficacy data applied in the studies identified by this review have limitations, the results of the studies may still have validity.
