First, PrimerExplorer doesn't support IUPAC characters other than \"ATCG\" in the input sequence, which are often used in MSA representations, because it was not built to handle MSA representations. Second, PrimerExplorer only runs in Windows operating systems, in a specific web browser. Third, PrimerExplorer cannot design signatures with loop primers, as discussed in Nagamine et al. [4] in a single execution, instead requiring two serial executions, which can prevent more optimal primer combinations from being identified. And fourth, Primer-Explorer is less suited for high throughput analysis since it is limited to a single execution process on a computer, accepts only up to 2,000 bp sequences, and outputs only HTML.",

We have not screened these in the laboratory, but they represent conserved and unique signatures that we believe would make sensitive and specific detection assays, similar to some of the assays in Iwamoto et al. [9] . A pre-computed MSA of all 25 completed Mycobacterium tuberculosis genomes available was used as input, including known drug-resistant genomes, and non-unique regions were masked out so only unique sequence is used for signature design. Operationally, LAVA has fulfilled our needs, but there are several components that are worthy of further attention. This discussion explores aspects of LAVA's design and operation that we believe will improve or augment LAVA's performance the most. LAVA currently excludes dimerization checks during primer selection, which would contribute to the relative scores of signature candidates. This would have been accomplished using the UNAFold [10] libraries to analyze inter-oligo interactions, and primer self-annealing. This is currently omitted because in some instances, the increase in required processing time to analyze primer combinations was unacceptable. Predicting inter-oligo hybridization is still a serious concern with regards to LAMP signature design, so we separately perform dimerization analysis on the finished signature candidates, and avoid using candidates with high dimerization potential. We will include dimerization checks as part of the native signature design when possible.",

The first is limiting the number of primer candidates that Primer3 can identify in each execution. This can be accomplished by narrowing the acceptable range of primer design parameters such as length and melting temperature. Primer3 output can also be limited by explicitly setting a maximum number of primers for Pri-mer3 to generate. The second option is to set stricter primer overlap limits. Stringent overlap limits may make it possible to perform the comprehensive dimerization checks discussed above within reasonable processing times.",

In general, calculations based on a \"TTTT\" linker sequence predict a slight increase in sensitivity in many of the likely hybridization configurations, because of a slightly longer and more stable base pairing at the 5' end of the hybridization. However, in one instance, this linker greatly increased predicted primer self-hybridization because of an unfortunate co-incidence of self-similar sequence. The chance of this being a problem increases if the number of consecutive identical bases in the designed primers cannot be limited. Improper choice of linker sequence can also increase predicted primer dimerization. A more contextaware linker design should yield better results than always using a single linker sequence. One day, we hope LAVA will suggest the most appropriate linker sequence, or omission of the linker, for each designed signature, to help support desired assay behavior. One potential approach is to design linkers that are the least complimentary to the loop regions adjacent to the F1 region in the LAMP dumbbell structures as possible. Another potential approach is to design linker-free primers like Poon et al [11] , which is currently the default behavior of LAVA.",

The fundamental difference in approach for designing primers with degeneracy, is that primers are enumerated based on all the sequences of the MSA, instead of based on only the first sequence. Our proof of concept requires different internal representations of sub-sequence MSAs, but is built using the existing Oli-goEnumerator and PrimerAnalyzer interfaces.",
