It is a vaccine-preventable disease that annually affects 5%-10% of the population globally. 1 It causes approximately 1 million influenza-associated hospitalizations among children younger than 5 years and 500 000 deaths among all age groups. 2, 3 The wide spectrum of clinical presentation and outcomes of influenza 4 and the low care seeking level with ill-defined symptoms that are often treated empirically without respiratory sampling make it difficult to estimate the true burden of influenza. 5 However, it is very important to document the clinical burden of influenza in order to reveal the pattern of severe illness, and to guide public health policies and justify the costly investment in the seasonal influenza vaccination, 6 and to assess influenza vaccine impact 7 which remains the key preventive intervention for influenza-related hospitalizations and deaths.",

The country has an area of 309 500 square kilometers and is composed of varying topographic features: valleys and desert account for 82 percent of the land mass; mountain ranges, 15 percent; and the coastal plain, 3 percent. The weather is a hot dry interior, humid coastal strip, and a mountainous southern region with seasonal (May-September) monsoon rainfall. 11 Oman is divided into eleven governorates/ provinces with total 60 wilayats. The Sultanate of Oman has a total population of 4 588 683 with about 45.9% expatriates. 12 Oman is considered a high-income country according to the World Bank list of economies. 13 In Oman, a computerized online system named \"Nabdh Al Shifa\" is established and has direct access to patient records and generating data from the 11 regional hospitals. The reports are generated through software (COGNOS) in response to input of International Classifications of Disease (ICD-10 code). The ICD-10 codes/J course is related to respiratory diseases and ICD-10 codes (J09-J18) are corresponding to patients hospitalized with pneumonia or influenza which are the WHO proxies for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI). 14 The objective of this study was to estimate the incidence of influenza-associated hospitalizations and in-hospital death in Oman.",

For example, our results showed that very young children (<1 year) were most commonly hospitalized as a result of influenza. A meta-analysis study 2 estimated the global burden of influenza in young children reported that highest incidence of influenza episodes, influenza-associated acute lower respiratory infections, and influenza-associated severe aLRI occurred in the first year of life. Another study estimated the incidence of influenza-associated hospitalizations using the same tool as in our study in 5 countries of Central America showed the highest distribution of influenza-associated hospitalization in children aged <5 years. 5 Death rates calculated in this study were lower than those estimated for deaths from pneumonia associated with influenza in This study has some limitations.

It peaked in November-December 2012 and 2013, in February-March 2014, and in 2015, it had 2 peaks in February-March and November-December. Nationwide, a total of 17 141 respiratory samples were tested (2862 were positive for influenza -average influenza positivity percentage: 17%). Influenza positivity for the whole study period ranged between 5.9% in diagnosed infants <1 year and 29.9% in patients aged 5<15 years. Also, influenza annual positivity rate showed difference between years with the highest rates of total positivity in 2015 (20.6%) and the lowest in 2013 (6.4%) (Table 1). The incidence of influenza-associated hospitalization in the study period was 20.6 (95% CI: 19.9-21.3) per 100 000 population; it ranged between 7.3 (95% CI: 6.4-8.1) per 100 000 population in 2013 and 27.5 (95% CI: 25.9-29.1) per 100 000 population in 2015. The highest annual incidence of influenza-associated hospitalization was found among infants <1 year of age in all years of the study except in 2014, where the highest incidence rate occurred among those aged \u226565 years. Cumulative incidence of influenza-associated hospitalization calculated for all the study period (2012-2015) among those <1 year was 121.3 (95% CI: 108.4-134.3) per 100 000; this was about 24 folds greater than the lowest incidence calculated among those 15<50 years: 5.3 (95% CI: 4.9-5.8) per 100 000 (Table 1); People aged \u226565 years had the highest annual incidence of influenza-associated in-hospital death in all the study years and ranged between 11.3 (95% CI: 7.5-15.1) in 2015 and 39.5 (95% CI: , and it peaked in November in 2015.

For example, rates in different studies were generated using different case definitions, age grouping, surveillance,durations, seasons, and analytical methods. Moreover, similar studies in the neighboring Eastern Mediterranean countries are very few. Also, different influenza immunization policies in different countries may affect the outcome of these estimations. The estimated annual incidence rate of influenza-associated hospitalization across all age groups between 2012 and 2015 (ranged 7.3-27.5 per 100 000 person) and this is much higher than a previous study in Oman 15 based on a sentinel sites surveillance between 2008 and 2013 that estimated the annual incidence rate across all age groups from 0.5 to 15.4 cases per 100 000 person. On the other hand, the overall estimated rate of influenzaassociated hospitalization in this study (20.6 per 100 000 person 95% CI: 19.9-21.3) is much lower than the burden of influenza in one of the Egyptian Districts 16 in 2013 where the overall incidence of influenza virus-associated SARI during the study period was estimated to be 44 cases per 100 000 person-years (95% CI: 39-48).",
