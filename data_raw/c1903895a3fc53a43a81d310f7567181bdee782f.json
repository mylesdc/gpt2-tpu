The in vitro anti-proliferative potential of the synthesized compounds 4a-o and 7a-e was examined against HT-29 (colon), ZR-75 (breast) and A549 (lung) human cancer cell lines. Compounds 7b, 7d and 7e were the most active congeners against the tested human cancer cell lines with average IC 50 values of 4.77, 3.39 and 2.37 \u03bcM, respectively, as compared with the reference isatin-based drug, sunitinib, which exhibited an average IC 50 value of 8.11 \u03bcM. Compound 7e was selected for further pharmacological evaluation in order to gain insight into its possible mechanism of action. It increased caspase 3/7 activity by 2.4-and 1.85-fold between 4 and 8 h of treatment, respectively, at 10 \u03bcM and it caused a decrease in the percentage of cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle with a corresponding increase in the S-phase. In addition, compound 7e increased phosphorylated tyrosine (p-Tyr) levels nearly two-fold with an apparent IC 50 value of 3.8 \u03bcM. The 7e-loaded PLGA microspheres were prepared using a modified emulsion-solvent diffusion method. The average encapsulation efficiency of the 7e-loaded PLGA microspheres was 85% \u00b1 1.3. While, the in vitro release profile of the 7e-loaded microspheres was characterized by slow and continuous release of compound 7e during 21 days and the release curve was fitted to zero order kinetics. Incorporation of 7e into PLGA microspheres improved its in vitro anti-proliferative activity toward the human cancer cell line A549 after 120 h incubation period with an IC 50 value less than 0.8 \u03bcM.",

In spite of precluding many of its causative risk factors, cancer still gives rise to about 550,000 deaths in the world every year and is the second leading cause of death next to heart disease [2] . The currently available cancer therapies usually suffer from poor selectivity between normal and invaded cells, with serious side effects and the development of drug resistance [3] . Therefore, the continued search to identify novel antitumor compounds bestowed with low toxicity and minimum side effects remains critically important.",

Various 3-substituted isatins have been utilized as anticancer drugs or drug surrogates. Example of this class of isatin derivatives is sunitinib (1, SU11248, Sutent TM , Pfizer, Inc., Fig 1) which was clinically approved in 2006 and is used now as the standard first-line treatment for the management of gastrointestinal stromal cancers and renal cell carcinoma due to its multi-targeting tyrosine kinase inhibiting activity [8] . Nintedanib (2, Fig 1) is another potential anticancer agent of this class that possesses triple angiokinase inhibiting activity toward vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFRs),platelet-derived growth factor receptors(PDGFRs) and fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs) [9] . Semaxanib (3, Fig 1) was developed as a new anticancer candidate with multiple tyrosinekinase receptor inhibitor activity with GI 50 values of less than 10 nM against 46 out of 53 NCI cell lines, but it has been discontinued in clinical trials owing to its dangerous side effects [10, 11] .",

Generally, it occurs through desorption of surface-bound drug, diffusion of the drug through the polymeric matrix and erosion of the polymer particles. In vitro 7e release was assessed in phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing a surfactant to simulate the physiological milieu and maintain sink conditions. Samples were incubated at 37\u02daC, and the amount of 7e was determined using a UV spectrophotometer. Fig 12 shows the release profile of raw 7e powder and the prepared 7e-PLGA microspheres. Linear prolonged 7e release rates from the microspheres were observed for 21 days without an initial burst release (Fig 12) . On the other hand, the release of compound 7e from the raw powder was faster than its release from the microspheres, as 65% of 7e was released after 5 days. This uncontrolled burst release of compound 7e from raw powder could result in too high local concentration which could lead to severe local tissue injure and hamper appropriate delivery to the target.",

            "text": "It can be seen that 7e-loaded microspheres exhibited biphasic drug release kinetics [34, 43] with an initial release up to 6% after 48 h and 27% after six days followed by cumulative release of 90% after 20 days. No initial burst release was observed, suggesting low 7e density at the surface of the microspheres and hence the homogenous distribution of 7e within the microspheres. The high polymer concentration led to the formation of a dense polymer matrix structure in the microspheres and no pores as observed in the SEM images, which resulted in a significant decrease in the initial burst release from the microspheres. The kinetics of 7e release from microspheres was close to the zero order model. The correlation coefficient (r 2 ) was 0.9884 and the release curve was fitted to zero order kinetics. This release pattern was due to diffusion and degradation of the microspheres. Fig 12 shows the initial slow release of 7e from microspheres, which could be attributed to the hydrophobicity of 7e. Moreover, the interaction of the hydrophobic 7e molecule with the polymer matrix via hydrophobic binding forces might cause a trapping of the drug inside the particles and, therefore, slower release. The rate of 7e release from the loaded microspheres gradually increased, as 10% release was observed after three days (Fig 12) .This was probably due to the diffusion of the drug, which was present at the surface of the microspheres. Thereafter, constant release was observed, which may have been due to 7e diffusion and matrix Synthesis and anticancer activity of certain hydrazonoindolin-2-ones erosion mechanisms of the biodegradable PLGA polymer. Slow drug release from microspheres maybe due high encapsulation of the drug with low swelling of polymer in the release medium, leading to slow diffusion of the drug particles from polymeric matrices. Furthermore, the degradation of PLGA 50:50 is slow. Therefore, the release of 7e from microspheres may depend on drug diffusion, the PLGA surface and bulk erosion or swelling [34] .Conclusively, compound 7e was slowly and continuously released from the PLGA microspheres with no obvious burst release. This behavior is consistent with a previous study using PLGA microspheres for sustained drug release [44] and with several anticancer drugs incorporated into microspheres [33, 40, [45] [46] [47] . This formula was used for further studies on the human lung cancer cell line A549. Cell viability assay. The human lung cancer A549 cell line was incubated with various concentrations (0.8, 1.6, 3.13, 6.25, 12.5, 25 and 50 \u03bcM) of both free 7e and 7e-loaded microspheres to evaluate the anti-proliferative activity by assessing their effect on cell viability. Unloaded PLGA microspheres (lacking compound 7e) were coincubated with the same cell line to show that tumor growth was not inhibited due to the PLGA microspheres alone.",

After 24 h of incubation time, no cytotoxicity was observed at low concentrations (0.8 and 1.6 \u03bcM), while after 72 h, only a 30% reduction in cell viability could be seen at 1.6 \u03bcM. Moreover, at 3.1 \u03bcM, 20 and 70% reductions in the cell viability were noted after 24 h and 72 h of incubation, Synthesis and anticancer activity of certain hydrazonoindolin-2-ones respectively, and almost total inhibition was observed after 120 h of incubation. A remarkable reduction in cell viability was observed at 6.25 \u03bcM = after 24 h of incubation and was maintained for 120 h of incubation. Therefore, the cytotoxicity effect of free 7e needs higher concentrations to obtain minimal to no growth of the human lung cancer cell lineA549. Synthesis and anticancer activity of certain hydrazonoindolin-2-ones Fig 13B illustrates the obtained results when 7e-loaded microspheres were incubated with the human lung cancer cell lineA549for incubation periods and concentrations similar to that of the free 7e. There was no cytotoxicity observed at 0.8 \u03bcM after 24 h of incubation, but at 1.6, 3.13 and 6.25 \u03bcM, 30, 40 and 50% reductions in cell viability were observed, respectively. After 72 h of incubation, cell viability was decreased to 10, 7 and 5%, respectively, for the same concentrations. This assay demonstrated that entrapped 7e was more effective in arresting cell growth as compared with free 7e. The enhanced cytotoxicity of 7e-loaded microspheres was observed with increasing incubation time in a concentration dependent manner. Therefore, the decrease in percentage cell viability was not immediate but rather gradual and continuous due to the polymer that allowed for slow release of 7e from microspheres and hence its gradual cytotoxic effect. The extended activity of 7e from 7e-loaded microspheres might be explained by the fact that they can be adsorbed onto the cell membrane, generating a drug concentration Synthesis and anticancer activity of certain hydrazonoindolin-2-ones gradient near the cell surface that could favor 7e to penetrate into the cell. Furthermore, the cell can phagocytize 7e-loaded microspheres, allowing 7e to be released inside the cytoplasm, thus contributing to a sustained 7e concentration [48] .",

The most active congeners in the preliminary in vitro anti-proliferative screening, compounds 7b, 7d and 7e, showed average IC 50 values of 4.77, 3.39 and 2.37 \u03bcM, respectively, as compared with the reference drug sunitinib which exhibited an average IC 50 value of 8.11 \u03bcM towards the tested human cancer cell lines. Compound 7e was selected for deeper pharmacological testing to gain insight into its possible in vitro anti-proliferative mechanism of action. It increased caspase activity by 2.4-and 1.85-fold between 4 and 8 h of treatment, respectively, at 10 \u03bcM. Moreover, compound 7e decreased the percentage of cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle with a corresponding increase in the S-phase. The increase in S-phase cells without a concomitant G2/M phase fraction may indicate a very rapid onset of apoptosis. In addition, compound 7eincreased p-Tyr levels by nearly two-fold with an apparent IC 50 value of 3.8 \u03bcM, which is consistent with its growth inhibitory IC 50 value. Compound 7e was incorporated into biodegradable PLGA microspheres to improve its in vitro anti-proliferative activity.
