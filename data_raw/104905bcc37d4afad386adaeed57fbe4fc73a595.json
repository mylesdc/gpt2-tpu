            "text": "For many infectious disease processes such as emerging zoonoses and vaccine-preventable diseases, 0vR 0 v1 and infections occur as self-limited stuttering transmission chains. A mechanistic understanding of transmission is essential for characterizing the risk of emerging diseases and monitoring spatio-temporal dynamics. Thus methods for inferring R 0 and the degree of heterogeneity in transmission from stuttering chain data have important applications in disease surveillance and management. Previous researchers have used chain size distributions to infer R 0 , but estimation of the degree of individual-level variation in infectiousness (as quantified by the dispersion parameter, k) has typically required contact tracing data. Utilizing branching process theory along with a negative binomial offspring distribution, we demonstrate how maximum likelihood estimation can be applied to chain size data to infer both R 0 and the dispersion parameter that characterizes heterogeneity. While the maximum likelihood value for R 0 is a simple function of the average chain size, the associated confidence intervals are dependent on the inferred degree of transmission heterogeneity. As demonstrated for monkeypox data from the Democratic Republic of Congo, this impacts when a statistically significant change in R 0 is detectable. In addition, by allowing for superspreading events, inference of k shifts the threshold above which a transmission chain should be considered anomalously large for a given value of R 0 (thus reducing the probability of false alarms about pathogen adaptation). Our analysis of monkeypox also clarifies the various ways that imperfect observation can impact inference of transmission parameters, and highlights the need to quantitatively evaluate whether observation is likely to significantly bias results.",

            "text": "There are many circumstances in infectious disease epidemiology where transmission among hosts occurs, but is too weak to support endemic or epidemic spread. In these instances, disease is introduced from an external source and subsequent secondary transmission is characterized by 'stuttering chains' of transmission which inevitably go extinct. This regime can be defined formally in terms of the basic reproductive number, R 0 , which describes the expected number of secondary cases caused by a typical infected individual. Stuttering chains occur when R 0 in the focal population is non-zero but less than the threshold value of one that enables sustained spread (i.e. 0vR 0 v1). Transmission is therefore subcritical, and epidemics cannot occur. However there are many settings where such transmission dynamics are important. A major set of examples comes from stage III zoonoses, such as monkeypox virus, Nipah virus, and H5N1 avian influenza and H7N7 influenza [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . Because most human diseases originate as zoonoses, there is significant public health motivation to monitor stage III zoonoses [7] [8] [9] [10] . Subcritical transmission is also associated with the emergence of drug-resistant bacterial infections in some healthcare settings, such as hospital-acquired MRSA [11] . In addition, stuttering chains characterize the dynamics of infectious diseases that are on the brink of eradication, such as smallpox in the 1960s and 1970s [12] and polio now [13, 14] . Furthermore, stuttering chains are seen with measles and other vaccine preventable diseases when they are re-introduced to a region after local elimination [15] [16] [17] .",

            "text": "A top priority in all of these settings is to quantify transmission, in order to determine the risk that the pathogen could emerge and become established in the human population of concern. This could occur due to demographic or biological changes that increase transmission, such as declining vaccine coverage [15] or pathogen adaptation [18] [19] [20] . Yet a recent review of transmission models for zoonotic infection identified a marked shortage of models that address the dynamics of zoonoses exhibiting stuttering chain transmission [4] . One major cause of this gap is that highresolution data describing individual-level disease transmission are rare. The introduction events that trigger the stuttering chains are sporadic, and the transient nature of stuttering chains makes them difficult to track closely. Furthermore, contact tracing is logistically challenging because it requires rapid response surveillance teams and techniques for differentiating specific routes of disease transmission. In contrast, the total size of a transmission chain (i.e. the total number of cases infected) is much easier to obtain, since it does not require detailed contact tracing and can be assessed retrospectively based on case histories or serology. Accordingly, the most common data sets for stuttering pathogens are chain size distributions, which describe the number of cases arising from each of many separate introductions. Such data can be used to make estimates of R 0 (or the 'effective reproductive number' in the presence of vaccination; for simplicity we will use the term R 0 for all settings) [2, 15, [21] [22] [23] . This strategy has been applied successfully, particularly in the context of vaccinepreventable diseases, but one important simplification is that these analyses typically have not allowed for an unknown degree of heterogeneity in disease transmission among individual cases. This is an important omission, because individual variation in infectiousness is substantial for many infections [24] and can cause significant skews in the chain size distribution [25] . Thus it may be expected to affect conclusions about chain size distributions. For example, failure to account for superspreading events caused by highly infectious individuals can trigger false alarms in systems designed to detect anomalously large chains [2, 19] .",

Also it has sometimes led to internal inconsistencies within previous analyses, as for example when an R 0 estimate predicated on the assumption that k?? was used to obtain estimates of kv1 [24] .

Monkeypox is an important case study for these methods, because recent reports indicate that its incidence has increased 20-fold since the eradication of smallpox in the late 1970s [28] , raising the urgent question of whether the virus has become more transmissible among humans. Meanwhile, challenging logistics make the collection of follow-up data difficult and resource-intensive. Fortunately, surveillance data from the 1980s data set is unique in its detail and it allows us to demonstrate how chain size data yields results that are consistent with harder-toobtain contact tracing data. This suggests that future monitoring of R 0 can be achieved by monitoring chain size data by itself. We demonstrate that accurate knowledge of the dispersion parameter is important for reliably determining when an apparent change in transmissibility is statistically significant. In addition, our focus on chain size distributions permits us to determine quantitative thresholds for chain sizes that can be used during surveillance to decide if a particular transmission chain is unusually large and likely to indicate an abrupt increase in R 0 . Such indications can facilitate targeted, cost-effective implementation of control measures. Lastly, we consider the real-world difficulties that can arise in obtaining transmission chain data, including the possibility that cases remain unobserved and the complications of overlapping transmission chains. We present a summary of when such observation errors can interfere significantly with reliable inference of transmission parameters.",

Such pathogens would go extinct if they were confined to humans, but they persist because of continual introduction from an external reservoir (such as animals, for the zoonotic diseases mentioned above). They are important to study because they pose a risk of emerging if they become more transmissible, or conversely to monitor the success of efforts to locally eliminate a pathogen by vaccination. A crucial challenge for these 'stuttering' pathogens is to quantify their transmissibility, in terms of the intensity and heterogeneity of disease transmission by infected individuals. In this paper, we use monkeypox as an example to show how these transmission properties can be estimated from commonly available data describing the size of observed stuttering chains. These results make it easier to monitor diseases that pose a risk of emerging (or re-emerging) as self-sustaining human pathogens, or to decide whether a seemingly large chain may signal a worrisome change in transmissibility.",

For instance, total incidence data on its own is not sufficient to infer human-tohuman transmissibility for subcritical infections, because the contribution of spillover cases is unspecified. However, chain size and contact tracing data can be used to infer R 0 . In fact, for our negative binomial model of disease transmission, the ML estimate of R 0 is identical when the likelihood is based on either chain size data only, chain size data coupled with knowledge of the transmission generation when the chain went extinct, or complete contact tracing data (see methods). This shows that for the purpose of estimating R 0 , chain size data can be equivalent to contact tracing data. However these theoretical observations must be placed in proper context as contact tracing is often valuable for many other reasons, such as helping to ensure data quality and minimizing unobserved cases.",

For instance, the observed 20-fold rise in incidence of human monkeypox [28] might be explained by an increased R 0 in the human population or by an increase in animal-to-human transmission. Since a relatively low incidence limits the data available for monkeypox (and many other subcritical diseases), it is helpful to determine how the type and quantity of data impacts the [26, 27] . The two confidence regions are based on the same set of data. The chain size analysis is based on the number of cases in isolated outbreaks of monkeypox, whereas the contact tracing data are based on the number of transmission events caused by each case. The black cross hairs indicate the previously reported 90% confidence intervals for monkeypox transmission parameters based on the first generation of transmission in this data set [R 0~0 :32(0:22{0:40), k~0:58(0:32{3:57)] [24] . B) Model predictions for the chain size distribution based on three different values of k, including the ML value of k that is based on contact tracing data. A subset of the chain size data consisting of only those chains having exactly one identified primary infection is shown for comparison to model predictions. When the two-parameter ML value for the contact tracing data is compared to the likelihoods of the k~1 and k?? models, the DAIC scores for the latter models are 4. 3 ability to detect a specific change in R 0 . Utilizing the results of R 0 and k inference for monkeypox in the 1980s, we can ascertain how the power to detect a statistically significant change in R 0 varies with the size of the data set and the magnitude of the change in R 0 (figure 2A). As expected, the more data that are available, the more statistical power there is to detect a change in R 0 . The sensitivity of chain size analysis for detecting a change in R 0 is almost identical to that of contact tracing analysis (when allowing k to be a free parameter in both analyses). This suggests that when faced with a trade-off, monitoring of R 0 is enhanced more by obtaining additional data on chain sizes (provided the sizes are accurately assessed) than by obtaining detailed contact tracing on a subset of available data. Equally as important as detecting a change in R 0 is knowing when there may be an inaccurate report of a change. In the case of monkeypox, we find that assuming an incorrect level of transmission heterogeneity in a chain size analysis can lead to over-confident detection of a change in R 0 relative to the 1980s data. This is because under-estimating the degree of transmission heterogeneity leads to inappropriately narrow confidence intervals for the estimated R 0 . Over-confident detection of a change in R 0 is most worrisome when two data sets simulated using identical parameters give rise to distinct estimates of R 0 more often than expected (table 2) . This over-confidence arising from incorrect assumptions about k can also lead to a lack of specificity for detecting a change in R 0 in simulated data sets, when inference based on letting k be a free parameter is used as the gold standard (figure 2B). While it could initially appear preferable that incorrect k values can lead to greater probabilities of detecting changes in R 0 , this trades off against the higher rate of false positive detections and a general loss of statistical integrity (e.g. the coverage of confidence intervals will not match the nominal levels).",

In these situations, an alternative approach to detecting a change in R 0 is to determine the size of the largest chain that would be expected by chance (for some arbitrary threshold in the cumulative probability distribution) [2] . The size cutoff for what is then considered an anomalously large chain depends on the values of both R 0 and k (figure 3). As the assumed value of k decreases, the chain size that is considered anomalously large will rise because superspreading events become more frequent. If chain size probabilities are calculated using traditional assumptions of k~1 or k??, then too many false alarms may be raised concerning the number of chains that are perceived to be anomalously large, particularly for pathogens that exhibit significant transmission heterogeneity. The determination of a chain size cutoff also depends on whether the detection of large chains is based on individual reports versus the investigation of the largest chains in a collection of surveillance data (compare figures 3A and 3B).",

A) Applying maximum likelihood estimation to simulated data shows the sensitivity of chain size analysis and contact tracing analysis for detecting a change in R 0 . Results show the probability of detecting a significant change between the monkeypox data from the 1980s and a simulated data set with k~0:33 (equal to the ML value for the 1980s data) and R 0 specified along the x-axis. Statistical significance was determined by setting a 95% confidence threshold on the likelihood ratio test (details provided in methods section). Curves represent different values for the number of simulated chains, N. Results are depicted for inference from detailed contact tracing data (dashed line) or more readily available chain size data (solid line). B) The specificity for detecting a statistically significant change in R 0 (as compared to 1980s monkeypox contact tracing data) is shown when various values of k are assumed during chain size analysis (as applied to the same chain size data simulated for panel A). The specificity is defined as the probability that a change is not detected for an assumed value of k conditioned on our gold standard for a lack of change (e.g. a change is not detected when k is allowed to be a free parameter during inference).

The former is a measure of accuracy and is potentially correctable, while the latter is representative of imprecision inherent in stochastic processes and is uncorrectable. The bias of ML inference of R 0 (figure 4C) is due to discrepancy between the observed and predicted average chain size. The bias is always negative due to the non-linearity of equation 12, which makes R 0 inference more sensitive to underestimates of the average chain size than to overestimates. The amplification of bias seen with decreasing k arises because greater transmission heterogeneity tends to produce chains that are either very small or very large, thus accentuating the influence of Jensen's inequality on equation 12. Similarly, the magnitude of the bias increases for small N As detailed in the methods section, a statistical difference was determined by using the likelihood ratio test to compare two transmission models. The first model assigns separate values of R 0 to the 1980s monkeypox data and the simulated data, while the second model assigns a single R 0 to both data sets. Both models assign a single value of k to both data sets. Since the second model is nested in the first, statistical significance was determined by setting a 95% confidence threshold on the likelihood ratio test.

            "text": "Transmission heterogeneity can also be reliably inferred from chain size distributions. Assessing inference of transmission heterogeneity is complicated by the inverse relationship between k and the variance of the offspring distribution. Thus we measure the error of k estimation in relation to 1 k (equation 16) . This emulates earlier work on ML estimation of k, both as a general biostatistical problem and from contact tracing data [29, 30] . In broad terms, the error of estimating k from chain size data (a k ) decreases as R 0 and N increase (figures 5A and 5B). This is explained by there being more observed transmission events that provide information on transmission patterns. Meanwhile, the error tends to increase with decreasing k. This is likely due to a need for relatively large sample sizes to observe the rare superspreading events that are characteristic of low k values [29] . Some caution is needed in interpreting this trend because our error metric of 1 k increases as heterogeneity increases. However it is unlikely that this trend is an artifact of our chosen metric because it is also seen when other error metrics are used, such as the difference between the inferred and true coefficient of variation (data not shown). The cutoff for a chain sizes that are considered anomalously large was determined by when the cumulative chain size probability exceed the cumulative distribution threshold for R 0~: 30 (ML value for 1980s monkeypox data) and k as indicated in the Because of the non-intuitive relationship between a k and confidence intervals for k, we have illustrated the performance of k inference for four specific choices of R 0 and N (figures 5C-5F). These plots reinforce the trends seen in panels A and B. In particular, narrower and more consistent confidence intervals for large N and large R 0 support the conclusion that this region of parameter space allows the most precise and accurate inference of k. The confidence intervals are also narrower for smaller k. However, this does not accurately reflect the uncertainty in the degree of transmission heterogeneity because small changes in small values of k can significantly change the offspring distribution's coefficient of variation. In contrast, the more rugged curves for ML inference when kw1 should be interpreted with consideration of the offspring distribution changing minimally for higher values of k. Despite the inherent difficulties of inferring low values of k, the ML approach appears robust because there is no discernible bias of the ML estimate of k and the median confidence intervals consistently include the true values of k.",

This coverage probability is consistent with the expected value of 90%. The one exception was for k~0:5, Nv20 and R 0 v0:5 when the coverage probability rose as high as 98%. This occurred because confidence intervals got wider for these small data sets, and not because R 0 inference was more precise. The coverage probabilities for confidence intervals of k estimates show similar concordance. As with the R 0 estimates, when R 0 and N are both low, the coverage probability for k tended to be higher than the nominal level of 90%. It was also too high when k approached higher values, but this is likely due to the boundary effects when k??.

No surveillance system is perfect and some cases will be missed. However the mechanisms underlying imperfect observation can alter R 0 estimation in different ways [2] .

In particular, the assumption that transmission can be described by independent and identical draws from a negative binomial offspring distribution is a simplification of some forms of transmission heterogeneity. For example, if heterogeneity is driven largely by population structure, such that susceptibility and infectiousness are correlated, then the relation between R 0 and heterogeneity can differ from what is represented in our model [35] . Specific scenarios that can give rise to such correlations include the existence of clustered pockets of susceptible individuals, impacts of coinfection or immunosuppressive conditions, or transmission heterogeneity that arises chiefly from variation in contact rates rather than variation in the amount of virus shed [36] [37] [38] . This issue is especially relevant for preventable diseases such as measles, because large outbreaks in developed countries are often associated with particular communities in which vaccine refusal is common [16, 39] . Local depletion of susceptible individuals, which can even occur within a household, can also impact the estimation of R 0 and k. By diminishing the possibility of large outbreaks, the depletion of a susceptible population is likely to decrease estimates of R 0 and increase estimates of k. We hope that our use of a likelihood function that combines R 0 and transmission heterogeneity will facilitate future work that addresses these modeling challenges in a self-consistent manner.",

Our findings can assist future surveillance planning by drawing attention to the utility of chain size data when contact tracing data are too difficult to obtain. We have shown that both R 0 and the degree of transmission heterogeneity can be inferred from chain size data, and have demonstrated that chain size data can give equivalent power to contact tracing data when deciding if R 0 has changed over time. In fact, even knowledge of the largest chain size alone can be helpful for monitoring change in R 0 , provided that the degree of transmission heterogeneity has been reliably measured. Conversely, we have demonstrated that inaccurate assumptions about transmission heterogeneity can lead to errors in R 0 estimates and possible false alarms about increased transmission. We have also found that inference can be accomplished when transmission chains are entangled into infection clusters, provided that the number of primary infections in each cluster is known. For the particular case of human monkeypox, our findings support previous analyses that have identified substantial transmission heterogeneity, but conclude that endemic spread would only be possible if there is significant demographic change or viral adaptation to enable greater human-to-human transmissibility. Since a mechanistic understanding of transmission dynamics is important for quantifying the risk of emerging diseases and predicting the impact of control interventions, we hope our findings will assist in providing robust epidemiological assessments for relevant public health decisionmaking.",

Contact tracing and subsequent analysis by epidemiological teams classified each identified cases as a primary case, arising from animal-to-human transmission, or a secondary case, arising from human-to-human transmission. The data set consists of 125 infection clusters [26, 27] . Most clusters contained just one primary case and thus constituted a single transmission chain.

Our baseline inference of transmission parameters is based on considering all the possible ways this cluster data can be separated into individual transmission chains. To explore the specific impact of entangled transmission chains on the inference of transmission parameters, we also investigated the impact of three approaches of using the cluster size data to assign an explicit chain size distribution (table 4). In the 'simple cluster analysis' approach, we treat all clusters as though they were a complete stuttering chain and ignore the complications of multiple primary infections. The other two approaches use different algorithms to divide the clusters that have multiple primary infections into constituent chains. In our 'homogeneous assignment' distribution, clusters were divided as evenly as possible. For example, a cluster of total size four with two co-primary cases is tabulated as two chains of size two. Meanwhile, our 'heterogeneous assignment' distribution maximized the number of isolated case counts when disentangling clusters. For this distribution, a cluster of size four with two co-primaries is tabulated as a chain of size one and a chain of size three.",

Consistent with this prior analysis, we find that R 0 inference can be achieved using just the generation-of-extinction distribution in a ML framework, but that the chain size distribution produces a more precise R 0 estimate for a given number of chains in the data set (simulation-based results not shown).

A) Applying maximum likelihood estimation to simulated data shows the sensitivity of chain size analysis and contact tracing analysis for detecting a change in R 0 . Results show the probability of detecting a significant change between the monkeypox data from the 1980s and a simulated data set with k~0:33 (equal to the ML value for the 1980s data) and R 0 specified along the x-axis. Statistical significance was determined by setting a 95% confidence threshold on the likelihood ratio test (details provided in methods section). Curves represent different values for the number of simulated chains, N. Results are depicted for inference from detailed contact tracing data (dashed line) or more readily available chain size data (solid line). B) The specificity for detecting a statistically significant change in R 0 (as compared to 1980s monkeypox contact tracing data) is shown when various values of k are assumed during chain size analysis (as applied to the same chain size data simulated for panel A). The specificity is defined as the probability that a change is not detected for an assumed value of k conditioned on our gold standard for a lack of change (e.g. a change is not detected when k is allowed to be a free parameter during inference). The solid line corresponds to N~500 chains and the dashed line to N~100. doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002993.g002",

B) Same as panel A except that k~0:5 for all simulations and now the number of simulated chains varies. C) Summary of how well k inference works when R 0~0 :3 and N~100. The dashed black line represents a perfect match between the true and inferred k values. The magenta line shows the median value of ML inference of k. The dashed blue lines show the median values of the upper and lower limits of the 90% confidence intervals for k. For visualization purposes and because kw10 is essentially a Poisson distribution, the upper confidence intervals were bounded at k~10. The green line shows the median estimate for k inference based solely on the first and second moments of the simulated data,k k h (equation 7). All curves were determined from the results of one thousand simulations for logarithmically distributed values of the true k.
