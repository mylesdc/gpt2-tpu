All New Zealanders are assigned a unique health identifier allowing tracking of healthcare utilization over time and confidential record linkage to multiple databases including hospitalization and surveillance data. Additionally, patients are registered with primary care providers who maintain highly computerized records with detailed demography, immunization status and clinical information. The NZ population is well characterized in terms of demographic structure, particularly by ethnicity and socio-economic status. Indigenous Maori and Pacific peoples (collectively about 20% of the population) appear particularly vulnerable to influenza and other respiratory infections. 3, 7 In In this article, we describe the objectives and study designs of SHIVERS.

However, the evidence to support valid and precise estimates of influenza disease burden globally remains weak with low quality, partly due to the short duration of studies and the heterogeneity of study settings and methods (statistical modelling, active versus passive case findings, virological versus clinical detection). [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] In addition, there is scarce information on sero-epidemiologic investigation of seasonal influenza at a population level. Serology can detect both symptomatic and asymptomatic infections, thus estimating the true incidence of influenza infection. This parameter cannot be determined by either disease surveillance programmes or detection of virologically confirmed cases as they would vastly underestimate influenza incidence and overestimate severity. [15] [16] [17] [18] SHIVERS allows calculation of rates of infection and different clinical presentations in the same population at the same time for an accurate picture of the relative severity of influenza infection in the population and vulnerable subpopulations at four levels: (a) severe hospitalized disease; (b) moderate disease requiring a general practice visit; (c) mild disease not requiring a general practice visit; (d) incidence of infection (symptomatic and asymptomatic).",

[34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] SHIVERS is providing robust and timely estimations of the protective effect of seasonal influenza vaccine in the prevention of hospitalizations and general practice consultations for laboratory-confirmed influenza using case test-negative control methods. 40, 41 Immune response An individual's immune response to influenza infection can vary depending on many factors (e.g. age, underlying conditions and ethnicity). Clinical observation during the 2009 pandemic indicated that the unexpected low morbidity and mortality rates in the elderly were in part due to their crossreactive immunity. 3, 42, 43 There are knowledge gaps regarding each component of adaptive immune responses in determining an individual's risk of acquiring influenza virus infection and the severity of the resulting disease: antihemagglutinin (HA) antibodies, antineuraminidase (NA) antibodies, isotypes of responding antibodies, influenza-specific CD4+, CD8+ T cells, surface markers and key cytokines. 44, 45 Additionally, there are scarce data on the correlation of cellular immunologic and neuraminidase targeted antibody responses in individuals with serologically (anti-HA antibodies) defined influenza infection. 46, 47 By interconnecting the epidemiological and immune studies in severe and moderate disease cases and high-risk subgroups (e.g. Pacific and Maori ethnic groups) and individuals with serologically defined influenza infection, SHIVERS will facilitate our understanding of host immune responses that determine an individual's risk of acquiring influenza infection or developing severe disease.",

Elderly people have a significantly higher risk of influenza-associated death compared with non-elderly people. 48 Additionally, the 2009 pandemic in NZ revealed that the risk of hospitalization and death was markedly higher for Maori and Pacific people, and those from the most deprived socioeconomic groups. 3, 42, 49 However, it is not clear whether these sociodemographic factors are independent risk factors for influenza. Furthermore, some chronic health conditions (high body mass index, asthma and pregnancy) have been shown to increase the risk of having a poor outcome from influenza infection. [50] [51] [52] [53] In NZ, household crowding has been identified as a risk factor for transmission of meningococcal disease, 54 rheumatic fever 55 and tuberculosis 56 and may also be contributing to higher rates of influenza for some populations. The household setting (crowding, housing conditions) may influence transmission of influenza, but these effects remain poorly understood. 57-59 SHIVERS will provide a multifaceted understanding of influenza risk that considers organism, host and environmental factors and opportunities for intervention. This comprehensive and quantitative approach will include detailed consideration of the independent contributions of host ethnicity, socioeconomic position, chronic illness status, obesity, household environment exposures and infecting virus.",

They interviewed these patients by applying the World Health Organization (WHO) interim SARI case definition: 'an acute respiratory illness with a history of fever or measured fever of \u226538\u00b0C, and cough, and onset within the past 7 days, and requiring inpatient hospitalization'. 61 Since 2013, the WHO final SARI case definition has been used with onset changed from '7 days' to '10 days'. The patients were differentiated into SARI cases (those who met the SARI case definition) and non-SARI patients (those with ARI who did not meet the SARI case definition). A case report form captured information on demography, history of presenting illness, comorbidities, influenza vaccination history, disease outcome and risk factors. 60 If a patient met the SARI case definition, a respiratory specimen (nasopharyngeal swab or aspirate) was collected and tested simultaneously for influenza and other respiratory viruses by real-time reverse transcription (RT) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques: influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus types 1-3, adenovirus and human metapneumovirus ( Figure 3) . 60 A systematic sample of about 50% of non-SARI patients were also interviewed and provided a respiratory sample, in addition to those from whom a specimen was collected for clinical purposes.

GP/PN documented the components of the case definition that were present and recorded patients who met the ILI case definition in an advanced electronic form designed for the practice management system (PMS). Patient information already captured in the PMS was automatically retrieved, including demography, comorbidities, vaccination history and regular medication list. Further data were captured by interviewing ILI patients regarding influenza vaccination obtained elsewhere, pregnancy and a clinician's judgement of obesity.",

Our innovative study design interconnecting multiple objectives, in addition to exploiting NZ's unique healthcare structure, will maximize efficiency and study power.

These specimens only consisted of a small proportion (9%) of total specimens; thus, the cost of testing was minimal (manuscript in preparation). This result was shared with the WHO global influenza programme.

            "text": "Firstly, the disease burden of severe influenza is estimated from the hospital surveillance platform. It measured population-based incidence for SARI-associated influenza hospitalizations including ICU admissions and in-hospital deaths as it provided reliable numerators and denominators, thus without a need for additional healthcare utilization surveys. [68] [69] [70] [71] Our first-year findings (30 April 2012 to 28 April 2013) showed that the SARI-associated influenza hospitalization rate was substantial with the overall adjusted annual incidence of 54/ 100 000 persons (manuscript in preparation). This rate was similar to US data on influenza-associated hospitalizations during 1979-2001, with an average annual incidence of 36\u00c18/ 100 000. 12 The very young (0-4 years) and elderly (\u226565 years) had the highest SARI-associated influenza hospitalization rates, consistent with trends identified in international literature, particularly those from developed countries with temperate climates. 10, [72] [73] [74] [75] A high rate of influenza-related hospitalizations and low vaccine uptake (6%) in young children (6 months to 4 years) from SHIVERS led the NZ government to change vaccination policy by extending free influenza vaccination to those in this age group who have been hospitalized or have a history of significant respiratory illness. 76 SARI surveillance is likely to underestimate the true burden of severe influenza resulting in hospitalization. Some patients will present with non-respiratory symptoms or respiratory disease that does not meet the SARI case definition, or stay briefly in emergency department. 63, 66 SHIVERS has begun to address this gap; a pilot study in 2012 testing persons with respiratory disease who did not meet the SARI case definition showed that a small proportion (6%) of non-SARI patients were positive for influenza viruses, compared with 18% of SARI cases (manuscript in preparation). Future work to expand the case definition to all acute hospital admissions in a sample of very young children will further expand our knowledge of the burden of influenza in this important group potentially protected by maternal immunization. Additionally, SARI and associated influenza cases will be linked to the hospital discharge data to determine the accuracy and validity of the discharge data by determining proportions of the principal discharge diagnosis code categories that are SARI and influenza cases. This will help inform modelling studies of ICD-coded data and help provide some validation of these with laboratory-confirmed data. SARI surveillance is also likely to grossly undercount the actual number of influenza-associated deaths because only a minority of influenza-related SARI deaths are correctly diagnosed, tested and recorded as such. Additional influenza deaths resulting from secondary bacterial infections and exacerbation of pre-existing chronic conditions and atypical clinical presentations are not captured. 77 This limitation presents a challenge in accurately measuring influenzarelated mortality. Future work on statistical modelling may allow for indirect estimation of 'excess' mortality attributable to influenza in those broad categories such as pneumonia, respiratory or circulatory deaths during influenza seasons. 78 Secondly, the disease burden of moderate influenza is estimated using data from SHIVERS ILI surveillance. Our findings from the 2013 season (29 April to 29 September) showed that the ILI-associated influenza consultation rate was about 14 times higher than SARI-associated influenza hospitalization rate (manuscript in preparation). Additionally, ILI-associated influenza consultations and SARI-associated influenza hospitalizations showed contrasting socio-demographic patterns: higher rates of ILI-associated influenza consultations were shown in preschoolers (aged 1-4 years), school-age children and adults (<65 years), those of Asian ethnicity and those from least deprived socio-economic status (SES) groups. This was a different picture from SARI surveillance where SARI-associated influenza hospitalizations were more frequent in the very young (under 1 year), the elderly, M aori and Pacific peoples and those from most deprived SES groups. 79 These results provided insights into the interplay between healthcare access opportunities and related health-seeking behaviours and the differential effect of the predominant strains on various age groups.",

For example, both ILI-and SARI-associated RSV incidences were similarhigh rates for very young (<1 year and 1-4 years) followed by elderly (\u226565 years). This presented a very different agespecific incidence profile from that of influenza (indicated above).

The data in 2013 showed moderate effectiveness of influenza vaccine against medically attended and hospitalized influenza in NZ with 56% (95% CI 34,70) against influenza presenting to general practice and 52% (95% CI 32,66) protection against laboratory-confirmed influenza hospitalization. 41 Immune responses SHIVERS surveillance platforms also provided sera and whole-blood samples during acute and convalescent phases of infection to study humoral and cellular immune responses from a subset of severe (N = 39) and moderate (N = 29) influenza cases in 2013. With these samples, and using a combination of serological and immunological assays, we were able to (a) estimate the relative contribution of early adaptive and cellular immune responses to disease severity; (b) identify differences in the immune profiles between these diseases groups; and (c) identify immunological correlates of disease severity in subpopulations. Data acquired so far indicate that SARI cases may experience a more robust immunologic response during infection (i.e. greater increases in HA-and NA-specific antibody titres as well as magnitude of T-cell response). The ability to parse out immunological differences between severe and moderate influenza cases in this pilot cohort highlights the value of adding the active immunology study to the SHIVERS platforms.",

Moreover, the data elements on a range of disease severities collected in the same population at the same time will generate epidemiologic parameters that maybe broadly generalizable and translatable to similar developed, southern and northern temperate countries worldwide. This will help enormously to better understand more basic surveillance data and to extrapolate those data in models to plan and predict influenza behaviour, generate burden estimates, model the impact of seasonal influenza vaccination to support more global use and better prepare for the next pandemic.",
