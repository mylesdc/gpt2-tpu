Ethyl acetate (EtOAc) and chloroform extracts inhibited in vitro neuraminidase (NA) enzymatic activity and viral replication more than methanol (MeOH) extract. EtOAc extract demonstrated NA inhibition IC 50 values ranging from 73.16 to 487.40 g/mL and plaque reduction IC 50 values ranging from 23.7 to 27.4 g/mL. Chloroform extract showed antiviral activities with plaque reduction IC 50 values ranging from 14.16 to 41.49 g/mL Time-ofaddition assay indicated that EtOAc and chloroform extracts also significantly inhibited virus yields after infection. HPLC analysis demonstrated that baicalin was dominant in the MeOH extract; baicalein and chrysin were rich in the EtOAc and chloroform extracts. Molecular simulation revealed baicalein hydrogen bonding with Glu277 as well as hydrophobic and Van der Waals interactions with Ile222, Arg224, Ser246, and Tyr347 in NA1 active sites of NA1. Baicalein inhibited in vitro replication of influenza A viruses pandemic 2009 H1N1 (IC 50 = 0.018 M) and seasonal 2007 H1N1 using plaque reduction assays. A combination of lowdose baicalein with other anti-influenza agents could be applicable for development of alternative remedies treating influenza A virus infection.",

            "text": "Influenza A virus, a member of the Orthomyxoviridae family, is an enveloped virus containing eight segmented, negativesense, single-stranded RNAs [1, 2] . The viral genome encodes 10 proteins, for example, hemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA), M1, M2, nonstructural protein 1 (NS1), NP, and RNP. HA, NA, and M2 locate on the outer side of a viral envelope and M1 on the inner side. Of these envelope proteins, HA contains the receptor-binding site, being responsible for virus fusion and infectivity [3] . NA digests sialic acid on the cell surface, resulting in release of virus particles and spread of the virus. M2 ion channel modulates the acidic pH of the endosome, allowing the acidification of the internal virion core as well as causing release of vRNP into cell cytoplasm. Envelope proteins (HA, NA, and M2) play key roles in viral infectivity, making them prime targets for prophylaxis and therapeutic anti-influenza A virus drugs. Still, oseltamivirresistant and amantadine-resistant variants emerge and are identified in several countries [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] , creating a need to develop new anti-influenza compounds.",

A 2009 reassortment (pandemic 2009 H1N1) of avian, swine, and human influenza A viruses caused global outbreak, first human pandemic of its kind in the 21st century [12, 13] . Pandemic 2009 H1N1 rapidly spread worldwide, infecting 1 to 3 billion people from April 2009 to August 2010. Its virus replicates in mucosal epithelial cells of upper and lower airways, lung pneumocytes, alveolar macrophages, mucous glands, and lymph nodes, causing pathology similar to 1918 H1N1 and H5N1 viruses [14, 15] . Oseltamivir-resistant pandemic 2009 H1N1 isolates with H275Y mutation in NA were identified in 2010 [16] ; drug-resistant pandemic 2009 H1N1 variants increased worldwide [17] . Importantly, a novel avian-origin influenza A (H7N9) virus causes an outbreak with severe and fatal respiratory diseases in China in 2013 [18] , becoming global public health concerns, such that new therapies and vaccines against influenza infection become urgent.",

Baicalin and baicalein inhibit viral replication of parainfluenza [24] , influenza A [25] , hepatitis B [26] , HIV-1 [27] , and SARS coronavirus [28] . Wogonin inhibits hepatitis B surface antigen secretion while reducing HBV-DNA level in vitro, as confirmed by the animal model infected with duck hepatitis B virus [29] . Apigenin also inhibits in vitro replication of influenza and adenoviruses [30] . In our laboratory, S. baicalensis water extract shows inhibitory effects on in vitro enzymatic activity of influenza A virus NA. This study further probes antiviral activity of ethyl acetate (EtOAc), methanol (MeOH), and chloroform extracts against influenza A virus subtypes like pandemic 2009 H1N1 and seasonal influenza A viruses H1N1 and H3N2. In addition, molecular simulation and in vitro assays indicated flavonoids of S. baicalensis, such as baicalein and baicalin, as potentials of NA inhibitory agents.

We scored our models using two scoring functions, LigScore and DockScore, and in addition, Tamiflu was used as a positive control in this docking experiment. The results showed that the S. baicalensis flavonoids, especially baicalin and baicalein, bond well to NA1, NA2, and NA9, with the high affinity based on higher score values using LigScore2 Dreiding and DockScore programs ( Table 4 ). As shown in Table 4 and Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 5 Interaction of baicalin with NA1 showed five hydrogen bonds between baicalin and Glu119, Arg152, Arg156, and Glu277 as well as Van der Waals interactions between the ligand and Glu119, Val149, Arg152, Arg156, Trp178, Ser179, Arg224, Glu227, Arg371, Tyr347, and Ile427 in Pocket I and III of NA1 (Figure 4 (b) and Table 4 ). As to the simulation of apigenin or chrysin with NA1 (Figures 4(c) and 4(d) ), hydrogen bonds and Van der Waals interactions were present between the ligand and the residues in Pocket I and III of NA1. These interactions showed baicalein directly interacting with the hydrophobic pocket (Pocket II) formed by highly conserved residues of NA, but baicalin, apigenin, or chrysin hydrogen bonding with the charge residues in Pocket III of NA1. The results indicated these four flavonoids directly interacting with NA1 active-site residues; baicalein showed the unique interaction with NA1, particularly via hydrophobic interactions with Ile222, Arg224, and Ser246.",

Using LigScore2 Dreiding and DockScore elucidated molecular interactions between flavonoids and NA active sites such as hydrogen bonding, Van der Waals, lipophilic, and polar attractive/repulsive interactions. Ranking the docking scores of flavonoids by LigScore2 Dreiding and DockScore was baicalin > baicalein > apigenin > chrysin (Table 3) . Table 4 and Figure 4 revealed, these four flavonoids binding with NA active sites, consisting of catalytic sites (Arg118, Asp151, Arg152, Arg224, Glu276, Arg292, Arg371, and Tyr406 in N2 numbering) and substrate binding and framework sites (Glu119, Arg156, Trp178, Ser179, Asp/Asn198, Ile222, Glu227, His274, Glu277, Asn294, and Glu425) [34] . Molecular modeling of baicalin/NA1 complex showed five hydrogen bonds between the ligand and Glu119, Arg152, Arg156, and Glu277 as well as Van der Waals interactions between the ligand and Glu119, Val149, Arg152, Arg156, Trp178, Ser179, Arg224, Glu227, Arg371, Tyr347, and Ile427. Meanwhile, molecular interaction between baicalein and NA1 had one hydrogen bond between the ligand and Glu277 as well as hydrophobic and Van der Waals interactions between the ligand and Ile222, Arg224, Ser246, Glu277, and Tyr347. The difference in the interactions of baicalein and baicalin with NA1 could correlate with more hydrophilic characters of baicalin with three hydroxyl groups and Dglucopyranosiduronic acid compared to baicalein. The reason could be responsible for the correlations between docking scoring and the antiviral activities of these four flavonoids in NA enzymatic inhibition and plaque reduction assays (Tables  5 and 6 ), in which the order of inhibitory efficacy and antiviral activity was baicalein > baicalin > apigenin > chrysin. The results suggested that the hydrophobic interaction of potential inhibitors with the highly conserved Pocket II (Ile222, Arg224, and Ser246) of NA1 provides the alternative approach to treat the NA inhibitor-resistant mutants such as His274Tyr, Glu119Val, and Arg292Lys mutation in NA1, NA2, and NA9.",

Baicalin also had potent anti-influenza A virus activities with IC 50 ranging from 2.55 to 5.84 M. Apigenin and chrysin displayed moderate inhibitory effects against influenza A variants. In time-ofaddition assay, postinfection treatment with these flavonoids had more potent inhibitory effect on virus yield compared to simultaneous treatment, linking with their NA inhibition activity and reduction of virus release into cultured supernatant. Baicalein exhibited a broad spectrum of antiviral activities, for example, dengue [35] , influenza A H5N1 [36] , Sendai [24] , and human cytomegalovirus [37] . Baicalein inhibited NA activity of influenza A H5N1 and Sendai viruses [24, 36] , echoing our finding NA inhibition by baicalein on pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza A virus plus another four variants. Likewise, baicalein suppressed IL-6 and IL-8 production in H5N1-infected human monocyte-derived macrophages [36] . Aside from baicalein, baicalin manifested antiviral activity against influenza A/FM1/1/47 (H1N1) [25] , HIV-1 [38] , SARS coronavirus [26] , and herpes simplex virus type 1 [39] . Baicalein inhibited Env protein-mediated fusion with chemokine receptors and CD4 during HIV-1 entry process [38] . Although the literature survey and our results indicated baicalein and baicalin exhibiting the potent anti-influenza and anti-inflammatory activities, both had low therapeutic index. A combination of baicalein with ribavirin demonstrated synergistic effects on inhibiting in vitro and in vivo replication of influenza A virus [40] . A combined treatment of baicalein/baicalin with other active agents could reduce cytotoxicity with lowering dosage of baicalein/baicalin and prove the anti-influenza potency.",

To screen inhibitory effects of S. baicalensis extracts on NA enzymatic activity, fluorometric activity assay of NA with MUNANA substrate indicated NA enzymatic activity of pandemic 2009 and seasonal 2007 H1N1 influenza A viruses by virus titer-dependent manner (Figure 1). Meanwhile, pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza A virus exhibited greater NA activity than seasonal 2007 H1N1 influenza A virus. Subsequently, MeOH, EtOAc, and chloroform extracts of S. baicalensis were prepared to test their inhibitory effects on NA activity of five variants: pandemic 2009 H1N1, seasonal 2007 H1N1, 2009 H1N1, 2009 H3N2, and PR8 H1N1 influenza A viruses (Table 1). EtOAc and chloroform extract inhibited NA enzymatic activity of these variants more potently than MeOH extract. Ranking IC 50 value of EtOAc extract on inhibiting NA activity of the variants from lowest to highest saw seasonal 2007 H1N1 (73.16 g/mL), 2009 H1N1 (176.57 g/mL), 2009 H3N2 (306.96 g/mL), pandemic 2009 H1N1 (388.98 g/mL), and PR8 H1N1 influenza A viruses (487.40 g/mL)(Table 1). Therefore, S. baicalensis extracts as NA inhibitors further examined inhibitory effect on replication of influenza A viruses.3.2. Inhibition of Influenza A Virus Replication by S. baicalensisExtracts. Cytotoxicity of S. baicalensis extract to MDCK cells was examined by MTT assay(Table 2); these extracts proved less toxic (CC 50 \u2265 800 g/mL) as available for in vitro activity against influenza A viruses. Plaque inhibition assay indicated S. baicalensis extracts concentration dependently inhibiting replication of pandemic 2009 H1N1 and seasonal 2007 H1N1 influenza A viruses (Table 2). IC 50 values against seasonal 2007 H1N1 influenza A virus were 23.7 g/mL for EtOAc extract and 41.5 g/mL for chloroform extract; IC 50 values against pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza A virus were 27.4 g/mL for EtOAc extract and 14.2 g/mL for chloroform extract, respectively, and therapeutic indexes above 30 against Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine",
