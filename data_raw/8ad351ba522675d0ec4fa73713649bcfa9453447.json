We aim to investigate whether survival had improved in the setting of recent advances in intensive care unit (ICU) management. We conducted a retrospective analysis of acute respiratory failure patients with H1N1 influenza pneumonia in 2016 and 2009 respectively at two tertiary referral hospitals in Korea. A total of 28 patients were treated in 2016, and 34 in 2009. There was no significant difference in SOFA scores on ICU admission day. In-hospital mortality was significantly lower in patients of 2016 compared to those of 2009 (18% vs. 44% P = 0.028). By multivariable analyses, the treatment year 2016 was associated with a greater likelihood of survival. Compared to the patients treated in 2009, those treated in 2016 were one seventh as likely to die after adjusting for other clinical variables (hazard ratio for mortality, 0.15; 95% confidence interval. 0.03-0.63, P = 0.010). Improved survival in patients who underwent extracorporeal membrane oxygenation treatment (in-hospital mortality, 17% vs. 60%, P = 0.242) and decreased tidal volumes during mechanical ventilation (median 5.4 mL/kg vs. median 9.2 mL/kg, P = 0.018) were observed in",

We used SOFA score to assess severity of patients because Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score were not appropriate in patients transferred from outside hospitals on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support. SOFA score was assessed upon admission. Data about treatment in the ICU were also extracted, including antiviral agents, antibiotics, corticosteroids, MV settings (fraction of inspired oxygen [FiO 2 ], positive end-expiratory pressure [PEEP], inspiratory pressure, and tidal volume for predicted body weight), neuromuscular blocking agents, prone position, nitric oxide, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), and ECMO. The predicted body weight was calculated using the following equations: predicted body weight (kilograms) for men = 50 + (0. [8] .

ECMO was used for 21% (n = 6) of patients in 2016 and for 15% (n = 5) of those in 2009 (P = 0.523). Four of the six patients treated with ECMO in 2016 had been transferred from outside hospitals on ECMO support. In-hospital mortality was significantly lower in patients treated in 2016 compared to those treated in 2009 (18% versus 44%, P = 0.028). There was no significant difference in length of stays in the ICU and hospital between the two years ( Table 2 ). As shown in Fig 1, the cumulative survival rate was significantly higher in acute respiratory failure patients with H1N1 in 2016 compared to those in 2009. Patients in 2016 were one seventh as likely to die after adjusting for other clinical variables (hazard ratio [HR], 0.15; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.03-0.63, P = 0.010). Additionally, age (HR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.01-1.10, P = 0.028), current or previous solid organ malignancy (HR, 0.17; 95% CI, 0.04-0.81, P = 0.025), and prone positioning (HR, 7.52; 95% CI, 1.37-41.40, P = 0.020) were significantly associated with mortality (Table 3) .",

This improved survival might be related to advances in ICU management. Regarding MV parameters, tidal volumes were lower in H1N1 patients of the 2016 influenza season compared to those of the 2009 influenza, despite no statistical significance. This may imply that intensivists have more tendency to recognize ARDS in a timely manner and adhere to low tidal volumes, which may influence improved survival in this study [17] . In this study, prone positioning seemed to be associated with increased mortality in patients with H1N1 acute respiratory failure. However, it might have resulted from the phenomenon that prone positioning had been implemented to patients suffering from severe hypoxia, who were in the worst clinical settings. In addition, prone positioning showed decreased 28-day and 90-day mortality and increased ventilator-free days in patients with severe ARDS [18] . Thus, we should be cautious in interpreting the results.",

            "text": "After the H1N1 pandemic, several institutions reported observational data suggesting ECMO increased survival in severe H1N1 pneumonia [13, 19] . The reports were consistent with our finding that the proportion of patients receiving ECMO treatment increased from 15% (in 2009) to 21% (in 2016). In addition, in-hospital mortality of those who received ECMO was lower in 2016 (17%) than in 2009 (60%), although there was no significant association between improved survival and ECMO in a Cox proportional hazard model. In H1N1 ARDS, high tidal volumes (> 9 mL/kg for predicted body weight) and time of deoxygenation (Pao 2 < 70 mm Hg) longer than 6 hours were associated with high mortality [20, 21] . In this study, it was notable that tidal volumes for predicted body weight were significantly lower in patients receiving ECMO in 2016 than in those in 2009, which might explain the improved survival. Thus, prompt initiation of ECMO treatment should be considered when refractory hypoxia is not relieved by conventional treatment in severe H1N1 pneumonia. In this study, CRRT was more frequently used with acute kidney injury in 2009 than in 2016. However, CRRT in acute kidney injury was not associated with decreased in-hospital mortality. Our findings were aligned with previous studies, which reported early renal replacement therapy initiation strategy was not associated with severe acute kidney injury and septic shock or ARDS [22] . Also, other observational study revealed that long-term risk of major cardiovascular events in ICU survivors was more common in those who had received renal replacement therapy than in those who had not received renal replacement therapy [23] . However, since the study population who received CRRT in our study was small and there are no relevant studies which evaluated the role of CRRT in H1N1 patients with AKI, further studies are needed to confirm the role of CRRT in the treatment outcomes in this population.",

The 2015 outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus in Korea is one such example [24] . However, unfortunately treatment outcomes in patients with severe viral pneumonia during a pandemic period are reportedly poor without definitive treatment modalities [5] [6] [7] . From this perspective, our study provides valuable data suggesting that advances in routine ICU management may improve treatment outcomes in such viral infections. Thus, investment and effort to improve ICU care are crucial to improving treatment outcomes in patients with a severe viral infection. Our study has several limitations. First, it was a retrospective study conducted at two referral centers in Korea. Second, the sample size was too small. Patients in 2016 were more likely to receive lower tidal volumes than those in 2009 and treatment outcomes in patients who received ECMO in 2016 were better than those in 2009. However, these factors were not statistically significant probably due to the small sample size. Though it was not proven in this study, prompt ECMO and lung-protective ventilation may have led to advances in ICU management that have resulted in improved survival. Third, its small sample size made our study prone to selection bias. Multivariable analysis might not be enough to remove selection bias. Thus, future studies with larger study populations are needed to investigate specific treatment modalities to improve survival in acute respiratory failure patients with H1N1 pneumonia.",
