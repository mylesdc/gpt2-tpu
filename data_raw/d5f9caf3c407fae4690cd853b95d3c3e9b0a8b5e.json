Methods: A stratified random sample (n = 50) was derived from tertiary A, tertiary B, and tertiary C hospitals in Shandong Province, and was surveyed by questionnaire.

Factor analysis identified four key factors from eight domains which appear to reflect the overall level of disaster resilience. These were hospital safety, disaster management mechanisms, disaster resources and disaster medical care capability. The survey demonstrated that in regard to hospital safety, 93% had syndromic surveillance systems for infectious diseases and 68% had evaluated their safety standards. In regard to disaster management mechanisms, all had general plans, while only 20% had specific plans for individual hazards. 49% had a public communication protocol and 43.9% attended the local coordination meetings. In regard to disaster resources, 75.6% and 87.5% stockpiled emergency drugs and materials respectively, while less than a third (30%) had a signed Memorandum of Understanding with other hospitals to share these resources. Finally in regard to medical care, 66% could dispatch an on-site medical rescue team, but only 5% had a 'portable hospital' function and 36.6% and 12% of the hospitals could surge their beds and staff capacity respectively. The average beds surge capacity within 1 day was 13%.",

Adequate progress can only be achieved by integrating local, provincial, and national systems [3] . Health systems are essential to enhance disaster resilience, and therefore planning at all levels should include health care facilities, such as tertiary hospitals, primary health care facilities, public health departments, and emergency medical services [4] . Within regional health systems, tertiary hospitals are the key component, as they are the main providers of health care during disasters. They also provide leadership during response phase of a disaster, and represent a critical linkage for disaster management for the whole system.",

Moreover, standardised or consistent methods for describing and measuring hospital resilience or relevant comprehensive ability are lacking [17] . Understanding the status of hospital disaster resilience is the first step in planning to enhance effective emergency response of hospitals. This article aims to explore the current status of disaster resilience in tertiary hospitals in Shandong Province. It has four objectives: (1) to identify the current status of tertiary hospitals' ability to cope with disasters in the Province; (2) offer references for similar studies; (3) to test the construct validity and the utility of an emerging framework as a basis for understanding and measuring hospital disaster resilience; and (4) to identify any variability in hospital disaster resilience in Shandong Province using this framework, in order to inform a more cohesive approach to health authorities and hospital managers.",

This framework of hospital resilience provides a starting point for integrating these key components of hospital resilience together into a comprehensive disaster management framework (including prevention, preparedness, responsiveness, and recovery and adaptation phases). It also seeks to make an achievable goal of improving hospital pre-disaster strength (robustness) and promoting rapidity of response and recovery.

Comparing its results, it was found that the percentage of most similar indicators in our study is reasonable higher, such as the percentages of: syndromic surveillance systems, single-hazard disaster plans, public and mass media communication protocol, stockpiles of emergency resources, and training programs and drills. Thus, to some extent, it was validated the representativeness of the sample in this study to reflect the status of the province. Additionally, it was found that hospital disaster preparedness in Shandong province is close to Beijing (the capital city), and it is above the average level of preparedness in China, due to economic factors and other factors [13] . It is expected that hospital disaster ability in many other parts of China may lag well behind that of Shandong province. Thus, understanding the status of hospital disaster resilience in this province can be used as the first step in planning effective hospital resilience.",

However, in the Province of China, less than half of the responding hospitals had signed contracts with drug-supplies, and less than one third had signed MOUs with other hospitals to share resources and staff. Also less than half had attended the local coordinating meeting, and only one fifth had attended community-wide drills.

However, there is still insufficiency of on-site medical rescue, especially a lack of \"portability\" of critical care service (i.e., patient transport and bringing care to the patient). These two models of on-site rescue still need to be further developed, as they are scalable, mobile and can surge medical care service significantly even after catastrophic disasters [28] . Additionally, medical care capability requires significant surge capacity during disasters, with a critical feature of hospital staffed beds [4] . In US, most hospitals had plans and flexible procedures for surging staffed beds [27] . Also it has been surveyed that in the hospitals of Kentucky, the surge capacity equal to 27% of licensed beds [29] . However, in this study, only less than one fourth of responding hospitals had a wide variety of flexible procedures for surging their beds and emergency staff. The surge capacity within 24 hours is 12.52% of fixed beds, which is relatively low.",

As a relatively larger percentage of tertiary A hospitals replied to the survey than the tertiary B and tertiary C hospitals. Although two reminders were sent to the hospital coordinators, there were still 9 hospitals who failed to attend the survey. The follow-up telephones demonstrated that they could not assign the responsible staff to fill the survey, or they are lack of relevant data. Thus it is very possible that the 41 participating hospitals may have relatively good backgrounds of disaster rescue than other 9 nonparticipation hospitals. Also, we suspect that the participating hospitals are better prepared in terms of disaster management than the non-participating hospitals. Secondly, due to the sample size (n = 41), it was possible that not all the significant difference of the mean score of each domain was tested statistically between different hospital categories (as illustrated in Table 1 ). Despite the limitation, the sample accounted for 52.1% of total hospitals that the study targeted, and did get a response rate over 80%. Thirdly, as the findings are self-reported by the respondents there may be a bias in their reporting. While the inclusion of official documents from Provincial Health Bureaus may have encouraged respondents to complete survey, this may have also been interpreted as an official assessment, thus leading some hospital representatives to overestimate their capability. Fourthly, due to ethical issues, the surveyed hospitals have to be anonymous which impedes comparison with their actual levels of preparedness. Finally, the study was undertaken only in one Province of China. And due to the limitation of funding and investigation time, stratified sampling was used in this study rather than investigating all the tertiary hospitals.",

Clearly, more progress is still needed to improve hospital disaster resilience, especially the focus of community-wide disaster cooperation, on-site medical rescue, and hospital patient care surging capacity.
