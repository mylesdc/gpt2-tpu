The participants were evaluated for the development of any acute respiratory tract infections by investigators blinded to the 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations. The incidence of infection in participants with different concentrations of vitamin D was determined. One hundred ninety-five (98.5%) of the enrolled participants completed the study. Light skin pigmentation, lean body mass, and supplementation with vitamin D were found to correlate with higher concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D. Concentrations of 38 ng/ml or more were associated with a significant (p,0.0001) two-fold reduction in the risk of developing acute respiratory tract infections and with a marked reduction in the percentages of days ill.",

The findings of the present study provide direction for and call for future interventional studies examining the efficacy of vitamin D supplementation in reducing the incidence and severity of specific viral infections, including influenza, in the general population and in subpopulations with lower 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations, such as pregnant women, dark skinned individuals, and the obese.",

The participants with the higher concentrations of vitamin D were more likely to have variables that were known from the literature and our non-linear model to be associated with higher vitamin D concentrations: lighter skin pigmentation and ingestion of vitamin D, the latter of which also explained the seemingly apparent difference in the high and low vitamin D groups based on gender. Only 24/85 (28.2%) of men were on vitamin D supplements, and only 4/85 (4.7%) took 1000 IU or more daily; the numbers for the women in the study were 55/113 (48.7%) and 26/113 (23.0%), respectively.",

Indeed, for the group $38 ng/ml for the entire study period, the incidence of infection was 2.7 times lower (p = 0.0150). The percentage of days ill in the $38 ng/ml group compared to the ,38 ng/ml group was 4.9 times lower; however, a precise multiple could not be determined, as proper analysis required knowledge of the exact range of illness duration in the higher group, and, as discussed below, that could not be determined due to the small number of infections (3) in that group. Obviously, unless the duration of illness in the group with the higher 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations was longer than in the other group, the 2.7 fold reduction in incidence would have to reduce the percentages of days ill by at least that factor in the higher group.",

The 18 participants who were able to maintain 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration $38 ng/ml for the entire study all had light skin pigmentation, and 72.2% were on vitamin D supplementation. The data suggested that there is a non-linear response in dose of vitamin D to serum concentration, which may be related to suggestions of increased metabolism of the vitamin in individuals with higher serum vitamin D concentrations [38] . The study also found an inverse relationship between body mass index and the serum concentration of the vitamin, consistent with a higher volume of distribution in individuals with a higher body mass index due to the high fat solubility of the vitamin.",

In addition, careful intervention studies would be required to evaluate any potential therapeutic effects of vitamin D in the course of established infections of any type. Our data suggest that there is a threshold above which progressively higher concentrations of vitamin D do not result in further benefit in reducing the incidence of viral infections of the respiratory tract.
