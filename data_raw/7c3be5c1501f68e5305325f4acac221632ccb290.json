            "text": "Introduction: Respiratory viruses are increasingly recognized as significant etiologies of pneumonia among hospitalized patients. Advanced technologies using multiplex molecular assays and polymerase-chain reaction increase the ability to identify viral pathogens and may ultimately impact antibacterial use. Method: This was a single-center retrospective cohort study to evaluate the impact of antibacterials in viral pneumonia on clinical outcomes and subsequent multidrug-resistant organism (MDRO) infections/colonization. Patients admitted from March 2013 to November 2014 with positive respiratory viral panels (RVP) and radiographic findings of pneumonia were included. Patients transferred from an outside hospital or not still hospitalized 72 hours after the RVP report date were excluded. Patients were categorized based on exposure to systemic antibacterials: less than 3 days representing short-course therapy and 3 to 10 days being long-course therapy. Results: A total of 174 patients (long-course, n = 67; short-course, n = 28; mixed bacterial-viral infection, n = 79) were included with most being immunocompromised (56.3 %) with active malignancy the primary etiology (69.4 %). Rhinovirus/Enterovirus (23 %), Influenza (19 %), and Parainfluenza (15.5 %) were the viruses most commonly identified. A total of 13 different systemic antibacterials were used as empiric therapy in the 95 patients with pure viral infection for a total of 466 days-of-therapy. Vancomycin (50.7 %), cefepime (40.3 %), azithromycin (40.3 %), meropenem (23.9 %), and linezolid (20.9 %) were most frequently used. In-hospital mortality did not differ between patients with viral pneumonia in the short-course and long-course groups. Subsequent infection/colonization with a MDRO was more frequent in the long-course group compared to the short-course group (53.2 vs 21.1 %; P = 0.027). Conclusion: This study found that long-course antibacterial use in the setting of viral pneumonia had no impact on clinical outcomes but increased the incidence of subsequent MDRO infection/colonization.",

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza viruses, rhinoviruses, and adenoviruses have also been linked to bacterial coinfections in humans [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . Animal studies have suggested synergism between bacterial pathogens and other respiratory viruses [19, 20] .

Our findings of similar clinical outcomes between patients with pure viral pneumonia who received long-course antibacterials after virus recognition and those who did not may suggest opportunity for de-escalation of empiric antibacterial therapy when viral pneumonia is identified. A previous randomized controlled trial by Oosterheert et al. [26] evaluated implementation of real-time PCR rapid diagnostics for respiratory pathogen identification. They found increased diagnostic yield with the assay but no difference in antibiotic use, and hypothesized that reluctance to change treatment based on testing results may have inhibited cost-effectiveness from being demonstrated. In our study, systemic antibacterials were discontinued following identification of a respiratory virus by RVP for several patients; however, whether virus identification directly led to discontinuation of antibacterials cannot be determined. The willingness of prescribers to de-escalate and stop antibacterials in this setting may suggest increased recognition of the role of viral pathogens in pneumonia. Additionally, the expanded panel of viruses detected may have factored into how results were perceived, as prescribers may have been more likely to attribute pneumonia to newly detectable viruses such as human metapneumovirus. However, it is not possible to definitively determine the rationale for stopping antibacterial therapy.",

In a cohort of hospitalized adult patients, Shiley et al. [37] found that significantly more patients who continued to receive antibacterials after diagnosis of a viral respiratory tract infection developed C. difficile infection. One patient in our study who was treated with long-course antibacterials after identification of a respiratory virus also developed C. difficile infection. Strategies to best limit the use of unneeded antibacterials are important to curtail against the growing issues of C. difficile and resistance, and may be aided by de-escalation approaches using enhanced viral diagnostic technologies.",

            "text": "Limitations of this study should be noted. First, this was a small retrospective cohort study of patients at a single institution and may not be representative of all settings. It is important to note that BJH is a regional specialty referral hospital and not a community hospital. This accounts for the case mix with a high prevalence of immunosuppressed patients and the low prevalence of narrow spectrum empiric antibiotic utilization. The small number of patients meeting inclusion criteria did not allow for definitive conclusions to be made regarding group comparison as a lack of statistically significant differences being found could be due to the lack of sample size. Second, patients were determined to have viral pneumonia based on virus identification and radiographic findings but other markers of illness, such as white blood cell count and fever, were not considered and the retrospective nature of the study did not allow evaluation of what drove continuation of antibacterials in some patients but not others. Moreover, we did not attempt to identify risk factors associated with pure viral pneumonia. Third, although coinfecting bacterial pathogens were not identified in patients with pure viral pneumonia, it is impossible to prove that they were not present. Receipt of antibacterials prior to obtaining bacterial cultures could have limited the diagnostic yield of bacterial cultures in some cases and yield from bacterial cultures is not perfect. Finally, all of the viral pneumonia cases occurred in a 20-month period. Viral epidemiology during this time may not be representative of all seasons. Influenza H1N1 p2009 was the primary influenza virus identified in our study (85 %). Incidence rates of bacterial coinfection and coinfecting organisms may differ from year to year and from virus type to virus type, which may hinder application of de-escalation strategies using the results of this study.",

            "text": "It is not possible to directly link the development of subsequent MDRO infections/colonization and C. difficile infection seen in our study to the continued empiric antibacterials administered. All of the patients included in the cohort received antibacterials at some point during their index hospitalization and infection control measures were not directly assessed in these patients. Additionally, hospitalization itself probably increases the risk of these patients being colonized with MDROs. Use of cephalosporins and vancomycin, two of the most commonly administered empiric agents in our study, have been implicated as increasing the prevalence of VRE, the most commonly identified subsequent MDRO in this study [38, 39] . Decreasing exposure to broad-spectrum antibacterials such as third-generation and fourth-generation cephalosporins and vancomycin would be expected to lessen the incidence of VRE and other MDROs as was seen in this study, but the risk of development and transmission of resistance in the hospital cannot be completely eliminated. Antibacterials are extraordinarily important in the treatment of many hospitalized patients and their use is often warranted. Decreasing unnecessary use may help curb acquirement of resistant organism in healthcare settings but even appropriate use can lead to the development of resistance. Only through multifaceted efforts of infection control and antimicrobial stewardship can the spread of MDROs between patients, clinicians, workers, and visitors be diminished.",

            "text": "This study highlights the potential benefits of improved diagnostics for respiratory viruses, primarily the potential for decreased antibacterial exposure and thus decreased selective pressure for resistant bacterial isolates. Antibacterial exposure applies selective pressure and promotes colonization/infection by resistant organisms including MRSA and VRE [40, 41] . Halting this process is essential to maintain effective therapeutic options in the future and may be aided by discontinuation of antibacterials in cases of viral pneumonia. In our study, patients with viral pneumonia exposed to long-course antibacterials had more occurrences of subsequent infection or colonization with MDRO isolates. In contrast, the number of patients with subsequent MDRO infection or colonization was not different between groups although this may be due to the small number of patients in each group. No differences in clinical outcomes, including in-hospital mortality and readmission rates, were observed between patient groups. In the setting of viral pneumonia and no coinfecting bacterial pathogens, discontinuation of antibacterials is reasonable in many if not most cases, and may allow for decreased overall antibacterial use. Enhanced diagnostic technologies can potentially be incorporated into antimicrobial stewardship practices to allow for de-escalation of unnecessary antibacterials. These findings warrant further investigation to determine the applicability of an antibacterial deescalation approach in the setting of viral pneumonia.",
