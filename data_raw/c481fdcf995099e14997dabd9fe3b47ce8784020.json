HH patients are not always on hepatology wards, which may complicate its recognition. To the best of our knowledge, there has been no report of HH in patients infected with A(H7N9) or any other type of avian influenza virus. However, the overall in-hospital mortality rate of HH can be as high as 45%-72% due to accompanying multiple organ failure (MOF). [10] [11] [12] [13] Because of this high mortality rate, early diagnosis and treatment of HH are necessary to ensure a good outcome. 11 From March 2013 to February 2015, 112 patients with A(H7N9) infection were admitted to the ICU of the First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine which represents the largest single-centre cohort of patients with A(H7N9) infection worldwide.",

Due to the progression of the infiltrates and consolidation ( Figure 4B and 4C), the patient was placed on a kidney, heart, etc. 5, 9, 15, 16 According to early reports, the occurrence of liver injury in A(H7N9) patients was relatively frequent. 5, 15 Our study is not only in agreement with these reports, but it also indicated a higher frequency of liver impairment during the hospital day (n 5 51, 45.5%) than on admission (n 5 27, 24.1%) (P , 0.001). However, severe liver impairment (ALT . 20-fold the ULN) was rare (n 5 2, 1.8%). The distinct difference between the extent of elevated ALT between HH patients and non-HH patients with liver impairment indicated that HH could be differentiated from other types of liver injury by means of a sharp elevation in the ALT level. The majority of A(H7N9)-infected patients are treated with antiviral medications, antibiotics and steroids, which are potentially hepatotoxic. [17] [18] [19] [20] There are also reports of liver impairment induced by respiratory viruses, such as severe adult respiratory syndrome coronary virus (SARS-CoV). 17 Hence, it is meaningful to identify the cause of liver injury, especially in cases of severe liver impairment. HH is a common cause of acute liver injury in the ICU setting and is characterized by an abrupt and massive increase in aminotransferase activity secondary to anoxic centrilobular liver necrosis. 7, 8 In other words, it is the clinical syndrome underlying hepatic necrosis homogeneously distributed around the central veins. Centrilobular liver necrosis without inflammation was found in this study, which is consistent with the typical histological changes of HH ( Figure 3A and 3B) . 7, 21 The pathologic features differed from those of SARS-CoV-associated viral hepatitis, in which hepatocyte ballooning and lobular lymphocytic infiltration are commonly found. 17 The negative results of RT-PCR testing of post-mortem liver tissue excluded A(H7N9)-related viral hepatitis. In addition, the peak LDH activities of 3001 and 2879 U/L in these patients were notable (Figures 2A and 5A ). These may be useful for differentiation of HH from viral hepatitis. 22 According to previous reports, the occurrence of HH requires a pre-existing condition that chronically compromises oxygen supply to the liver, together with an acute event that further decreases hepatic oxygen supply. 10, 13 Severe A(H7N9) infection will lead to respiratory failure, and respiratory failure will in turn induce a sudden decrease in oxygen supply to the liver. 9 The presence of a chronic disease that reduces baseline oxygen supply to the liver is an indicator of HH risk in A(H7N9) patients. In case 1, coronary artery disease that chronically reduced blood flow, and hence oxygen supply, to the liver was found in both HH cases. In case 2, chronic pulmonary dysfunction decreased blood oxygen saturation, which led to an insufficient baseline oxygen supply to the liver. In addition, temporary left ventricular failure and respiratory failure decreased the oxygen supply to the liver. Temporary left ventricular failure was suspected due to myocarditis. The CK, TNI and ECG results supported this speculation. In another temporary left ventricular failure patient with A(H7N9) infection, typical myocarditis histological changes, such as cluster lymphocyte infiltration, were found in post-mortem heart tissue. Cardiac dysfunction was confirmed on cardiogram by the decrease in LVEF to 42% and 37.5% in the two patients on admission. In case 1, the detection of dilated intrahepatic veins by abdominal ultrasound ( Figure 1B) and a prolonged history of coronary disease with two intracoronary stent implantation procedures suggested chronic right ventricular failure. During hospitalization, these two patients required persistent intravenous norepinephrine transfusion to maintain diastolic blood pressure. This clearly indicated circulatory failure, which would also reduce oxygen supply to the liver. The reduction in oxygen supply caused by respiratory failure was ameliorated in the ICU. The peak ALT and AST levels occurred on the day of admission or the following day in this study, which is in accordance with the report of Raurich et al. 12 Ours is the largest centre for the treatment of A(H7N9) patients in the world. A(H7N9) patients in our ICU represent ,20% (112/571) of the total number of patients confirmed infected with A(H7N9) according to the latest report by the WHO. 2 The prevalence of HH in ICU patients with A(H7N9) infection in our centre is 1.8%. The incidence of HH in ICU patients varies from 0.9% to 11.9%. 7 Most studies have reported a prevalence of 1%-2%. This is in agreement with our findings, which suggest that patients with A(H7N9) infection in the ICU setting have a similar prevalence of HH to that of those with other aetiologies.",

However, the relatively low prevalence of HH (2 HH cases vs. 110 non-HH cases) makes it difficult to reach a conclusion regarding the contribution of a cytokine storm to the pathogenesis of A(H7N9) infection in HH. A large-scale study of A(H7N9)infected patients should be performed to determine the contribution of a cytokine storm to HH and the correlation between them.",

The typical pathological change of HH, centrilobular necrosis of the liver, was confirmed. A(H7N9)related viral hepatitis was excluded based on negative real-time RT-PCR for viral genes in liver tissue. A lower LVEF accompanying underlying chronic heart disease and abrupt elevation of serum ALT levels at the time of admission in patients with A(H7N9) infection suggest the need for identification and treatment of HH. 8 H7N9 influenza-infected patients with chronic heart disease accompanying acute heart failure are at elevated risk of severe liver damage. Lan-Juan Li and colleagues at Zhejiang University in Hangzhou studied 112 patients admitted to intensive care with H7N9 influenza over 2 years, two of whom had hypoxic hepatitis, a type of acute severe liver injury caused by reduced oxygen supply to the liver. The results indicated a combination of pre-existing heart conditions and sudden decreasing of left ventricular ejection fraction in the two patients, combined with the respiratory failure caused by H7N9, reduced oxygen supply to the liver, which caused hereditary hemochromatosis. The researchers suggest that H7N9 patients with a history of heart disease and acute left heart failure on admission should be carefully checked for liver damage.",
