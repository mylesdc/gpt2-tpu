        "title": "impaired production of immune mediators in dengue virus type 2-infected mononuclear cells of adults with end stage renal disease-infected mononuclear cells at 6 h, 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h post-infection. We found in the ESRD group significantly higher GM-CSF and IL-2 levels at 6 h post-infection. However, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p40, TNF-\u03b1, MCP-1, and MIP-1b levels were found significantly lower than in the control group. At 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h post-infection, significantly lower levels of IL-1Ra, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p40, TNF-\u03b1, MCP-1, and MIP-1b were detected in ESRD group. Concentration of VEGF at 24 h and 48 h, and of GM-CSF at 48 h and 72 h were also found to be lower in ESRD group than in control group. Compared with controls, the viral load Ct values were significantly lower in ESRD group at 6 h and 24 h post-infection No significant difference in viral load Ct values between two groups was found at 48 h and 72 h post-infection. Our study discloses that the expression of immune mediators of dengue-infected mononuclear cells is impaired in ESRD patients",

            "text": "During the 1950's and 1960's, dengue was generally considered to be a pediatric disease 8, 9 . However, in recent decades, advancing age has been reported to be a risk factor for patients with severe dengue, as the comorbidities associated with ageing pose a substantial risk for mortality in elderly patients [10] [11] [12] . Chronic kidney disease has been implicated in the development of severe dengue [13] [14] [15] [16] . Thein et al., in a study of 108 patients with dengue, reported that renal disorder increased odds of death in adults 17 . Kuo et al. reported that patients with chronic kidney disease had a higher mortality rate than those without chronic kidney disease 13 . In a study of 304 adults with dengue, chronic renal disease was found to be a risk factor that contributes to the development of acute kidney injury, which is associated with high morbidity and mortality of the affected patients 18 . Wong et al. found that end stage renal disease (ESRD) is a risk factor for acute respiratory failure in dengue affected adults 19 . ESRD is also an important clinical predictor of gastrointestinal bleeding in adult patients with dengue 20 . In fact, patients with ESRD are more susceptible to infections (such as bacterial sepsis) with poor clinical outcomes compared with the general population 21 . In spite of ESRD being an increasingly common disease, there is lack of enough data on the immune pathogenesis in ESRD patients affected by dengue. Thus, thorough investigation is urgently required for the better understanding of immune responses in dengue-affected ESRD patients. In the present study, we aim to explore the sequential immunological reactions and viral load in vitro by investigating dengue virus-infected mononuclear cells of adults with ESRD, which would eventually make it possible to target interventions for an improved treatment plan for dengue infection.",

At 6 h post-infection, IL-2 and GM-CSF were detected at higher concentrations, but there was a significant reduction of stimulated mononuclear cell production of IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p40, TNF-\u03b1, MCP-1, and MIP-1b in ESRD without diabetes group than in control group. At 24 h, 48 h and 72 h post-infection, the levels of IL-1Ra, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p40, TNF-\u03b1, MCP-1, and MIP-1b were still low in ESRD without diabetes group than in the control group. In addition, significantly lower concentration of VEGF was observed at 48 h post-infection in ESRD without diabetes group in comparison to controls. ",

However, most of the previously published research on dengue immune pathogenesis involved a general population rather than a population with a specific underlying disease such as ESRD 30 . In the present study, eleven immune mediators and viral load Ct values were measured in DENV2-infected mononuclear cells of adults with ESRD, and in healthy participants. Uremic itself presents a complex multidimensional inflammatory condition 31 . Previous studies have shown that T lymphocytes from ESRD patients are dysregulated and the plasma IL-18, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1 and C-reactive protein concentrations were significantly higher in ESRD patients than those pre-dialysis controls 31 . In our series, apart from high levels of GM-CSF and IL-2 that were observed at 6 h post-infection, impaired production of immune mediators was observed at a later stage post-infection in the ESRD group. This finding is potentially valuable for understanding of the basis of immunopathology reactions and provides new insight in the management of ESRD patients with dengue virus infection.",

GM-CSF plays an important role in mediating the innate immune response that stimulates stem cells to produce granulocytes and facilitates development of the immune system to fight against infections 32 . GM-CSF has been reported to increase significantly in patients with severe dengue as compared mild dengue 33 . IL-2 is an important pro-inflammatory cytokine in determining the activation of T-helper 1 response to stimulate cell-mediated immunity 34 . Kurane et al. in a study of 69 children showed that the level of IL-2 was highest one day before defervescence in patients with dengue hemorrhagic fever 35 . Although GM-CSF and IL-2 were expressed in higher concentrations at 6 h post-infection in ESRD group, the production of a large number of pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines as well as chemokines, including IL-8, IL-12p40, TNF-\u03b1, MCP-1, MIP-1b, and IL-10 was markedly decreased.

This change is most likely due to effects of biological mediators as a consequence of complex interactions between dengue virus and host innate and adaptive immune responses 4,5,7 . For example, increased levels of TNF-\u03b1 and soluble TNF-\u03b1 receptors as well as VEGF have been www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ reported in dengue hemorrhagic fever cases 36, 37 . IL-10, having anti-inflammatory properties counter-regulates the cascade of pro-inflammatory cytokines and it has been reported to correlate with disease severity 38 Remarkable, the results of the present study showed a significant impairment of IL-1Ra, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p40, TNF-\u03b1, MCP-1, and MIP-1b expression at 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h post-infection.

Impaired cytokines/chemokines expression also has been found in ESRD without diabetes group as well. Our results have been somewhat inconsistent with the reported overwhelming immune activation that is associated with dengue disease severity 5, 7 ; however, our findings clearly reflect the impairment of immune responses in vitro study of DENV2-infected mononuclear cells in ESRD patients. Uremia per se can also alter the immune system in ESRD patients 39 . The complete blood count is not performed in our series. Previous studies, however, have shown that monocytes and monocyte-derived dendritic cells of ESRD patients have impaired endocytosis and maturation 40 . Lisowska et al. reported that ESRD patients have lower percentages of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, as well as B cells in peripheral blood 41 . In fact, several factors influence immunity in ESRD patients, such as uremic toxin, malnutrition, chronic inflammation, and therapeutic dialysis [39] [40] [41] [42] . In this regard, our findings and previous reports indicate that ESRD patients have immune dysregulation with impaired expression of immune mediators in case of dengue virus infection.",

The leukocyte-derived growth and chemotactic factors are demonstrated by granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and IL-8, whereas the monocyte and macrophage chemotactic factors are demonstrated by monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) and macrophage inflammatory protein-1b (MIP-1b).
