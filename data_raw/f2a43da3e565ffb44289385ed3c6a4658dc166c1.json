            "text": "Cytokine expression patterns of T cells can be regulated by pre-commitment to stable effector phenotypes, further modification of moderately stable phenotypes, and quantitative changes in cytokine production in response to acute signals. We showed previously that the epidermal growth factor family member Amphiregulin is expressed by T cell receptor-activated mouse CD4 T cells, particularly Th2 cells, and helps eliminate helminth infection. Here we report a detailed analysis of the regulation of Amphiregulin expression by human T cell subsets. Signaling through the T cell receptor induced Amphiregulin expression by most or all T cell subsets in human peripheral blood, including naive and memory CD4 and CD8 T cells, Th1 and Th2 in vitro T cell lines, and subsets of memory CD4 T cells expressing several different chemokine receptors and cytokines. In these different T cell types, Amphiregulin synthesis was inhibited by an antagonist of protein kinase A, a downstream component of the cAMP signaling pathway, and enhanced by ligands that increased cAMP or directly activated protein kinase A. Prostaglandin E2 and adenosine, natural ligands that stimulate adenylyl cyclase activity, also enhanced Amphiregulin synthesis while reducing synthesis of most other cytokines. Thus, in contrast to mouse T cells, Amphiregulin synthesis by human T cells is regulated more by acute signals than precommitment of T cells to a particular cytokine pattern. This may be appropriate for a cytokine more involved in repair than attack functions during most inflammatory responses.",

Th1 cells predominantly produce interferon-c (IFNc) and protect against intracellular pathogens; Th2 cells produce interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5 and IL-13 and help to eliminate extracellular parasites; Th17 cells produce IL-17a and IL-17f and are crucial in fighting against extracellular bacteria and fungi; whereas induced T regulatory cells (iTreg) produce IL-10 and Transforming Growth Factor b (TGFb), and suppress T and B cell effector responses.",

Cytokines and other soluble mediators in the lymph node and inflamed tissue can further affect the cytokine expression profile of effector CD4 T cells [3] , in some cases by changing the differentiation status of the effector CD4 T cells. Primed precursor CD4 T (Thpp) cells, that produce mainly IL-2 and chemokines when stimulated, remain uncommitted with respect to their effector cytokine pattern and can later differentiate into either Th1 or Th2 cells [4] [5] [6] . Suppressive Treg cells, expressing the forkhead transcription factor Foxp3, can lose the expression of Foxp3 and acquire the ability to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines during autoimmunity [7] . Th17 cells can acquire the ability to produce IFNc in Th1 polarizing conditions [8, 9] . Adoptively transferred IL-4-producing Th2 effector cells can produce IFNc during viral challenge infections [10] . Th9 cells develop from Th2 populations in the presence of TGFb [11, 12] and T follicular helper (Tfh) cells may represent a further differentiation step from several of the other subsets [13] .",

Like other EGF members, AR is expressed as a transmembrane precursor protein and released by proteolytic cleavage [21, 22] . Soluble AR binds to EGF receptors and promotes proliferation and differentiation of epithelial cells, fibroblasts and keratinocytes [23] [24] [25] . AR-deficient mice [26] showed slower kinetics of clearance [27] of the helminth parasite, Trichuris muris, that is cleared most effectively by Th2-biased responses. AR production is also induced in human mast cells by IgE cross-linking [28, 29] , in human eosinophils by IL-5 [30] , and in human basophils by IL-3 [31] . Thus AR is induced by activation of at least four cell types contributing to Type 2 inflammation, suggesting a role for AR during an allergic immune response. In addition, production of AR by immune cells is potentially important for tissue remodeling and repair [21, 26] during and after damaging immune responses.",

We examined the regulation of AR synthesis by human T cells, and found that in contrast to mice, many subsets of human T cells, including CD4 and CD8, naive and memory, Th1 and Th2, all express AR in response to TCR stimulation. Factors that elevate cAMP levels synergized with TCR stimulation to enhance AR expression, while inhibiting expression of most inflammatory cytokines. Thus in human T cells, AR production is regulated strongly by the environmental context during stimulation, but not restricted to particular precommitted effector subsets of T cells.",

Although naive CD4 T cells are relatively homogeneous, the memory population includes a wide range of differentiated effector subsets. As AR is expressed selectively by mouse Th2 cells, we examined whether AR production by human CD4 memory T cells was preferentially associated with expression of a particular cytokine or surface marker pattern. Th1-and Th2-biased human CD4 T cell populations were induced by stimulation of sorted naive human CD4 T cells with an allogeneic B cell line in Th1-or Th2-biasing cytokine conditions.

To determine whether AR expression was associated positively or negatively with subset-specific cytokines, the frequencies of cells expressing AR plus each of the other cytokines were measured from the ICS results. These values were then compared with the double-producing frequencies predicted for random association of each cytokine pair, by multiplying the individual frequencies for each cytokine. Figure 5B shows that AR was expressed in association with TNFa, IL-2, IFNc, IL-4 and IL-17 at slightly higher frequencies than predicted by random association. Similarly, TNFa and IL-2 showed positive associations with all other cytokines. In contrast, the subset-specific cytokines IFNc, IL-4 and IL-17 showed mostly negative associations between each other, as expected. These results were confirmed at the RNA level by sorting SEB-stimulated human PBMC according to surface AR expression. Both AR+ and AR-memory CD4 T cell populations expressed similar levels of IL-4 and IFNc as measured by RT-PCR ( Figure 5C ).

Chemokine receptors expressed selectively by T cell subsets lead to different homing and chemotactic properties. Expression patterns of chemokine receptors are partly but not entirely related to cytokine commitment patterns [36] [37] [38] [39] . Additional surface markers, including CD27 and the homing receptor CD62L are also expressed heterogeneously on human CD4 T cells. We therefore examined AR expression within subsets of memory CD4 T cells defined by the expression of these proteins. AR was produced at approximately similar frequencies by CD4 T cells positive or negative for the chemokine receptors CCR4, CCR7, CXCR3 and CXCR5, as well as CD62L and CD27 ( Figure 6 ). However, expression of the activation-induced protein CD69 was strongly correlated with AR expression, as seen in previous figures.

AR expression was significantly up-regulated by cAMP-elevating agents in both resting and anti-CD3 stimulated human PBMC populations enriched for human T cells [40] . However, in that study the negatively-selected T cell population would also have contained basophils, and we have shown that basophils express AR rapidly in response to IL-3 and cAMP agonist ( [31] and unpublished data). Thus anti-CD3 stimulation of the CD4 T cell + basophil population could have induced IL-3 production by T cells, indirectly resulting in AR production by basophils.

Our results suggest that AR is not a specific product of certain pre-committed effector subsets of human CD4 T cells, but instead is regulated mainly by additional signals present during T cell activation, particularly signals influencing the cAMP signaling pathway. The lack of precommitment suggests that, in contrast to the memory of effector functions carried by T cells committed to Th1, Th2, Th17 etc phenotypes, the amount of AR produced in a particular immune response is regulated by the local environment during that response, but is less influenced by previous immune priming.

During an immune response, initial immune attack mechanisms that destroy the pathogen are superseded at later times by suppression that reduces immunopathology, and tissue repair that restores normal structure and function. T lymphocytes are major cellular contributors to all three phases, and are thought to play a role in repair by producing HB-EGF and bFGF [33] . AR and HB-EGF, as members of the EGF family, promote the proliferation of fibroblasts, epithelial cells, and smooth muscle cells, which are major cell types repaired or remodeled at local tissue sites during an inflammatory response. Tissues with chronic inflammation show extensive cell proliferation, tissue thickening and reduced elasticity. Regulation of the balance between attack and repair cytokines produced by T cells is thus crucial to the successful outcome of the response. . TCR and cAMP synergize to induce AR production in human CD4 T cells. Purified CD4 T cells were incubated with or without TCR stimulation (anti-CD3/CD28 beads) and the cAMP agonist. (A) AR and HB-EGF mRNA expression was measured by RT-PCR. (B) The concentrations of AR in the supernatant and cell lysates were measured by ELISA. (C) Enriched CD45RA+CD45RO-(na\u00efve) and CD45RA-CD45RO+ (memory) CD4 T cells were treated with medium alone, or anti-CD3/CD28 beads in the presence or absence of cAMP agonist (1 , 1000 mM) . The concentration of AR in the supernatant at 24 hours was measured by ELISA. (D) Purified CD4 T cells were treated with medium alone, or anti-CD3/CD28 beads in the presence or absence of the cAMP-modifying agents shown. RNA was extracted at 4 hours, and AR mRNA was measured by RT-PCR. The concentration of AR in the 24-hour supernatant was measured by ELISA. (E) PBMC were treated with anti-CD3+ anti-CD28 antibodies in the presence or absence of cAMP agonist or antagonist for 8 hours. CD4 T cells were purified by cell sorting and RNA was extracted.
