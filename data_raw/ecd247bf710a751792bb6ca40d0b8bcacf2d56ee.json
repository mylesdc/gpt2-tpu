While direct measurement of beat frequency from high-speed video recordings is the most accurate and reproducible technique it is extremely time consuming. The aim of this study was to develop a freely available automated method of ciliary beat frequency analysis from digital video (AVI) files that runs on open-source software (ImageJ) coupled to Microsoft Excel, and to validate this by comparison to the direct measuring high-speed video recordings of respiratory and ependymal cilia. These models allowed comparison to cilia beating between 3 and 52 Hz.",

This process is known as mucociliary clearance (MCC). In the brain, ependymal cilia beat at a frequency of around 40 Hz, moving cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) close to the ventricular wall. Many factors, including inherited ciliary defects in primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), temperature, pH, viscosity and exposure to bacterial and viral pathogens have been shown affect ciliary function [2] [3] [4] [5] . Recent studies have shown that assessment of both ciliary beat pattern and frequency are essential as cilia may beat in a dyskinetic fashion while maintaining their normal beat frequency [5] [6] [7] . The most accurate method for determining ciliary beat frequency, particularly at high beat frequencies is by directly timing a given number of individual ciliary beat cycles from slow-motion playback of high-speed video files [7] . However, this is extremely time consuming and automated methods designed to rapidly measure beat frequency from high-speed video recordings are needed [8] [9] [10] .",

            "text": "Early automated methods, including the laser lightscattering spectroscopy, photodiode and photomultiplier methods were developed to calculate ciliary beat frequency (CBF) based on changes in light intensity around beating cilia under the microscope [11] [12] [13] . More recently, a number of bespoke image analysis software programs have been developed to automatically compute CBF from video files captured using video microscopy [8] [9] [10] . This software computes changes in pixel intensity over time (as shown in Figure 1A ) to Hertz using fast Fourier transformation (FFT), a function that has been used frequently for this application [14, 15] . However, the studies that describe this software lack two important elements: comparison of their results to the direct measurement of ciliary beat frequency from slow-motion video replay of cilia, and the measurement cilia that beat at very high frequencies [8, 9] . This is important as some phenotypes of PCD display respiratory cilia that beat at frequencies above 16 Hz and brain ependymal cilia beat at frequencies higher than 36 Hz. In this paper, we describe software that was validated by comparing results to those obtained by direct measurement of high-speed video recordings of cilia. The program also runs using open-source software. To evaluate a wide range of ciliary beat frequencies we studied both human respiratory cilia and ependymal cilia from the rat brain. Respiratory cilia usually beat at less than 16 Hz [7] and brain cilia usually beat at over 36 Hz. To obtain CBF measurements above 16 Hz, we slowed the frequency at which ependymal cilia beat by adding the pneumococcal toxin pneumolysin, which we have previously shown to reduce ependymal CBF [4] . The ciliaFA program has been made freely available and may be downloaded in Additional file 1.",

The complex number is translated using the Excel function '=IMABS(range)' and the dominant frequency within the range is then established using the function '=MAX(range)'. The CBF is determined by multiplying the row number by the frequency resolution (FR) (frame rate of recording/number of frames), which we named the 'FFT Mag'. In order to more accurately predict the CBF, we averaged the sum of the FFT Mag of the peaks flanking the maximum (see Figure 1B) .",

As opposed to previous studies we validated the software by comparing the results to frequencies obtained using the most accurate method for CBF calculation, directly counting individual ciliary beat cycles during slow-motion playback. Our data showed that the software was validated for use over a wide range of ciliary beat frequencies up to 52 Hz. Table 1 shows that the limits of agreement between the two methods were within the same range as the natural variation that exists between two different observers. Furthermore, the Bland-Altman limits of agreement for human respiratory cilia between the ciliaFA and direct counting methods were very low. Previous software programs validated their results using indirect, less accurate methods, including the early automated photometry method [9] . Previous studies reported limits of agreement ranging from \u22121.0 to 1.39 Hz [9] , -2.75 to 5.15 Hz [7] and from \u22123.89 to 3.39 Hz [8] compared to digital high-speed methods. In our system the image capture instrument is not connected to the software, so analysis performed once the experiment is completed. This allows the software to batch process groups of images using the same settings and thus reducing operator input. This study has clearly demonstrated that ciliaFA is reliable system to analyze CBF. In addition to the accurate measurement of ciliary beat frequency the ciliaFA system has a number of advantages. It has high throughput capabilities allowing significant time savings when processing large datasets, it reduces operator error due to selection bias, and it accurately reports static cilia. The latter is a significant advantage as immotile cilia may not be visible to the observer in multilayered cell cultures. Furthermore, by focusing on particular ciliated areas, ciliaFA can report changes and reductions in ciliary beat frequency.",

We have used the ciliaFA software to examine AVI files of different lengths, captured at different frame rates (data not shown). We found that videos captured using high-speed video cameras that capture at rates at least 120 frames per second with a length of 128 frames (to give a frequency resolution of 0.94) will give valid data. These settings capture an appropriate number of ciliary beat cycles to accurately average the CBF; the lower the frequency resolution (that is, the more frames captured), the greater the accuracy of CBF. To allow the videos to be used for beat pattern analysis high-speed video cameras that capture at rates exceeding 250 frames per second should be used. The ciliaFA software has the capability to crop frames from large files to speed up the calculation of frequency without reducing the frequency resolution. For high-frequency analysis, we recommend that the microscope bulb is connected to a stable power source of at least 110 volt AC/60 Hz; lower voltages may cause the bulb to flicker within the CBF range and this will enhance background noise. We also recommend that the image is not subject to downstream processing, such as enhanced pixel gain, as this will also enhance background noise.",
