            "text": "African swine fever (ASF), erysipelas and many other infectious and parasitic diseases have seriously compromised the future of pig industry in the Western Highlands of Cameroon. Since implementation of biosecurity measures (BM) is known to reduce the risk of disease transmission, the objective of this study was to describe the pig farming management system as well as the biosecurity practices on pig farms in the Western Highlands of Cameroon. Therefore, 97 farms were investigated using a face-to-face interview-based questionnaire. Biosecurity practices were divided in three components: isolation, traffic control and sanitation. The results revealed that the majority of farms were extensive (73.22%), farrow-to-finish farms (59.79%) and essentially raising crossed-bred (72.75%). The most practiced BM regarding 'isolation' were as follows: maintenance of the minimum distance between farms (56.06%) and dispatching of animals of same age in the same room (97.16%); for 'traffic control', the measures included the following: assignment of specific tools and equipment (96.86%) to a specific piggery; concerning 'sanitation', daily cleaning (97.06%), as well as using disinfectants (89.13%) were mostly implemented. The measures less implemented for 'isolation' included fencing (11.83%), compliance with the all-in all-out principle (10.11%), use of specific clothing (6.03%) and quarantine (7.69%); for 'traffic control', the less adopted measures comprised visitor hands washed before animal handling (11.65%), respect of linear flow principle (13.52%). Concerning 'sanitation', these measures included functional footbath (29.90%), processing of drinking water (27.84%) and cleanout (18.14%). The biosecurity level was low, intermediate and high for 73.71, 21.55 and 4.73% of farms, respectively. This low level suggests that ASF and other diseases are likely to remain endemic. The most important measures of concern and to improve are as follows: not feeding kitchen waste to pigs; keeping other livestock species away from pigs; fencing pig barn; keeping newly arrived animals in quarantine, not exchanging boars; not selling sick animals.",

            "text": "Though the country is the largest pig producer in Central Africa (MINEPIA, 2009) , the demand is not satisfied due to a number of constraints including poor technical inputs in the production system (untrained personnel, old, defective, and worn equipment, inappropriate building among other), poor feeding (low standard feed and lack of feed supplement) and poor health (MINEPIA, 2009 ). Among the disease challenges, African swine fever (ASF) and erysipelas alone are responsible for heavy losses due to outbreaks that occur almost every year in Cameroon (MINEPIA, 2009) . Other infectious diseases reported to occur include hog cholera, porcine encephalomyelitis, Aujeszky's disease, enteritis, transmissible gastroenteritis, porcine encephalomyelitis, erysipelas, dysentery, pasteurellosis, tuberculosis and salmonellosis (MINEPIA, 2009 (Kouam, Ngueguim & Kantzoura, 2018) are not the least, causing considerable economic losses due to reduced weight gain, litter size, poor growth rates, visceral organ condemnation at slaughter and deaths (Kauffman, 1996; Pitman, 2010; Stewart & Hale, 1988 ). Thus, one of the important measures to increase pig productivity should be in the area of disease control. Due to the large number of diseases in pigs, implementation of biosecurity measures (BM) in pig production is of paramount importance. For instance, the prevalence of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome and Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae has been associated with the level of biosecurity at farm level (Austin, Weigek, Hungerford, & Biehl, 1993; Lambert, Arsenault, Polkak, & D'Allaire, 2012) . Reversely, several pig diseases (intestinal and miscellaneous diseases) have been successfully controlled through the respect of biosecurity practices in some countries (Wallgren, 2009) .",

            "text": "Nowadays, the implementation of BM is regarded as a powerful tool in the control of diseases on the farm; its main advantage is the potential to keep pathogens off the farm and to prevent pathogens from spreading to other farms. Biosecurity can be defined as a set of management practices or measures to prevent introduction and spread of pathogens within and between farms (Fasina, Lazarus, Spencer, Makinde, & Bastos, 2012; Gueye, 2008; Gunn, Heffernan, Hall, McLeod, & Hovi, 2008) . In pig production specifically, biosecurity is defined as 'the implementation of measures that reduce the risk of introduction and spread of disease agents; it requires the adoption of a set of attitudes and behaviours by people to reduce risk in all activities involving domestic, captive/exotic and wild animals and their products' (FAO/ OIE/ World bank, 2010). BM are divided into three components: isolation, traffic control and sanitation (Cardona & Kuney, 2001; FAO/ OIE/ World bank, 2010) . Isolation can be regarded as measures related to physical barriers (fence, showers or footbath) and distance between farms in order to limit contacts between infected animals and contaminated objects with diseasefree farms (FAO, 2008) . Traffic control can be considered as the restriction of feedstuff, human, equipment and animal movement onto the farm (FAO, 2008) . Sanitation refers to the cleaning and disinfection of animal housing, people material and equipment (Cardona & Kuney, 2001) .",

The all-in/all-out principle was followed In fact, this principle was shown to break the infectious cycle of pathogens from one production round to another (Clark, Freeman, Scheidt, & Knox, 1991) . Similarly, there was a poor implementation of quarantine area (7.69%). This might be explained by the fact that the vast majority of farmers have not been trained in pig farming and in biosecurity practices. Also, only 6.03% of farmers used farmspecific clothes and boots, which is very risky as humans can act as mechanical vectors of disease to pigs. In this case, transmission may occur through leftovers of urine and faeces from infected animals on footwear and clothing as has been proven through experiments for several germs, among which E. coli (Amass et al., 2003) and classical swine fever virus (Ribbens, Dewulf, Koenen, Maes, & Kruif, 2007) . A vast majority of farmers (97.16%) kept animals of same age-group in the same unit (piglets, growers and adults separated and kept in different units). This is a good measure that reduces the risk of infections spread. Another good measure is the fact that most employees did not raise pigs at home; this result is probably explained by the fact that most farms (80.10%) had family members as the main work force.",

In a few farms (11.65%), visitors washed their hands before touching an animal; again, this finding is consistent with the low number of farms under semi-intensive and intensive husbandry system where the biosecurity level has been reported to be higher than in extensive system (FAO/OIE/Work Bank, 2010); the fact that only this percentage of farms adopted this measure is a serious biosecurity flaw in the area. In general, production tools and equipment were specific for a piggery, which is in line with the fact that these tools and equipment were exchanged among farms only by a very limited number of farmers. However, the protective effect of these measures was jeopardized by the habit to exchange boars among 31.96% of farms for reproduction purposes. It is well established that introduction of new genetic materials (semen) or animals from different source herds increases the risk of disease introduction into the pig farm (Hege, Zimmermann, Scheidegger, & St\u00e4rk, 2002; Lo Fo Wong, 2004; Pritchard et al., 2005) . Exchange of animals among farms is one of the most rapid ways for disease dissemination because an animal may apparently look healthy while it is a chronic, As a whole, the biosecurity level on farms in the study area was low, with up to 73.71% of farms having an adoption rate equal or less than 25.00%. The low biosecurity level is probably related to the fact that the majority of farms operated under extensive system. Our finding is in accordance with the FAO/OIE/Work Bank (2010) observations. Considering the three components of biosecurity, the highest percentage of farms with an adoption rate of BM equal or more than 75.00% was not greater than 10.00%, with the 'traffic control' component enjoying the first position (9.70%), followed by the 'isolation' (4.70%) component and finally the 'sanitation' component occupying the last position (2.97%). This low level of biosecurity observed for all the components suggests that farmers do not have any understanding of biosecurity principles in pig farming, and that steps (training and sensitization) should be taken to fill the gap.",

The low implementation level of BM suggests that farmers still have a long way to go and that government officials should handle the issue of biosecurity in pig farming sectors very seriously. With these alarming results, it is not surprising that ASF has become endemic in pig production areas of the country and is still causing a tremendous harm to the pig industry. Parasitic diseases as well as diarrhoea have also become an important health constraint in pig production probably as a result of the very poor biosecurity level on the farms. The most important measures of concern and to improve are; not feeding kitchen waste to pigs; keeping other livestock species away from pigs; fencing pig barns; keeping newly arrived animals in quarantine, not exchanging boars; not selling sick animals. Other countries with similar husbandry systems might probably face the same flaw in biosecurity practices. Future works will focus on the relationship between biosecurity and production performance, incidence of different diseases and culling rates in the area.",

Most farms were farrow-to-finish farms (59.79%) while farrower and grower-finisher farms almost shared the same proportion (22.67 and 17.53%, respectively). The most frequently used breed was crossed breed F I G U R E 1 Map of the West Region of Cameroon showing Menoua Division (72.75%).

Having other animal species on the farm was almost a standard as 91.92% of farms also kept domestic animals (small ruminants, fowl, dog, cats and cavies among others). Just 10.11% of farms adhered to the all-in all-out principle (all the animals that enter the farms are also removed at the same time to avoid contact between two different batches of animals). Use of specific coveralls and boots as well as quarantine of new animals was applied by 6.03 and 7.69% of farmers. The vast majority (97.16%) of farmers dispatched up pigs in lodges based on their age (the following age group: piglets [2-6 months], growers [6-9 months], and adults > 9 months were separated from each other) and 13.67% of employees also reared pigs at home. Measures concerning the 'isolation' component are detailed inTable 2a.Practices concerning traffic control are shown inTable 2b. A few farms (13.52%) had piggeries built according to the 'linear flow' principle while 76.29% of workers were assigned to a specific building.",

            "text": "asymptomatic carrier of pathogens. Once introduced into a farm, such an animal becomes the transmission source of diseases to na\u00efve animals. For instance, pigs with the chronic form of ASF can live several months(FAO, 2011); as long as they live, they will continue to be a hazard for pig farms because the virus is likely to be shed via their secretions and excretions. Therefore, the widespread habit of boars exchange observed among farmers is of major concern. The recurrent outbreaks of the so-called 'red diseases' (this expression is used in Cameroon to designate these common diseases of pigs that clinically exhibit skin red colour) in Cameroon might be maintained through this devastating practice. Exchange of boars without prior assurance about the disease-free status of both the boars and the sows should be strongly avoided. An alternative solution for reproduction could be the vulgarization of the artificial insemination technique, which is already practiced on some limited number of farms in the country.The 'sanitation' component appeared to be closely linked to the production system. Footbaths were available in only 29.90% of farms, which can be explained by the small number of farms under semi-intensive and intensive system. Footbath is essential for disinfection of footwear and should be renewed on a regular basis. This level is low and in disagreement with the findings (58.00%) obtained byAnne, Isabelle, and Mai (2010). Though footbaths appear of little effectiveness against ASF due to the fact that the boots are not the only wears that may carry virus, they may reduce the risk of transmission if they are correctly used. Use of disinfectant and daily cleaning was implemented in the large majority of farms, suggesting that most farmers understand the need to keep the farms cleaned and disease-free. Also, most producers had the slurry draining system functional on their farm confirming their good disposition to protect their farms from diseases. The cleanout was adopted only in 18.14% of farms. This poor adoption level should be due to the fact that most farms under extensive system do not follow the all-in all-out principle, such that animals are always present on the farm.",
