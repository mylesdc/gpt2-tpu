            "text": "Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) became a global human health threat since its first documentation in humans in 2012. An efficient vaccine for the prophylaxis of humans in hotspots of the infection (e.g., Saudi Arabia) is necessary but no commercial vaccines are yet approved. In this study, a chimeric DNA construct was designed to encode an influenza A/H1N1 NA protein which is flanking immunogenic amino acids (aa) 736-761 of MERS-CoV spike protein. Using the generated chimeric construct, a novel recombinant vaccine strain against pandemic influenza A virus (H1N1pdm09) and MERS-CoV was generated (chimeric bivalent 5 + 3). The chimeric bivalent 5 + 3 vaccine strain comprises a recombinant PR8-based vaccine, expressing the PB1, HA, and chimeric NA of pandemic 2009 H1N1. Interestingly, an increase in replication efficiency of the generated vaccine strain was observed when compared to the PR8-based 5 + 3 H1N1pdm09 vaccine strain that lacks the MERS-CoV spike peptide insert. In BALB/c mice, the inactivated chimeric bivalent vaccine induced potent and specific neutralizing antibodies against MERS-CoV and H1N1pdm09. This novel approach succeeded in developing a recombinant influenza virus with potential use as a bivalent vaccine against H1N1pdm09 and MERS-CoV. This approach provides a basis for the future development of chimeric influenza-based vaccines against MERS-CoV and other viruses.

For instance, one study has engineered a recombinant human adenoviral vector to encoding the full S protein or the S1 domain protein of HCoV-EMC/2012 isolate. Both adeno-based vaccines were evaluated in BALB/c mice and found to induce T-cell responses and neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) against MERS-CoV [3] [4] [5] . Similarly, a recombinant modified vaccinia virus expressing the full S protein was developed. This vaccinia-based vaccine was evaluated against MERS-CoV in Ad5-hDPP4-transduced BALB/c mice and showed significant induction of humoral and cell-mediated immunity and nAbs [6, 7] . In addition, using Ad5-hDPP4-transduced BALB/c mice immunized with Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus replicon particles containing S protein resulted in a reduction of viral titers to nearly undetectable levels by 1 day post infection (pi) and increased nAbs [8] . Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) expressing spike gene of MERS-CoV induced immunological T-cell response and virus neutralization in rhesus monkeys against VSV and MERS-CoV with a single immunization [9] .",

The reverse genetic system to generate the chimeric bivalent virus is illustrated in Figure 1B .

The development of an effective bivalent vaccine against influenza and MERS-CoV infections is urgently required especially in the areas where both viruses are co-circulating. Thus, designing novel strategies to prevent MERS-CoV and influenza infections is in demand. A previous study showed that aa 736-761 of the MERS-CoV spike epitope elicit robust neutralizing activities and block viral infection [15] . Herein, we developed a novel recombinant bivalent vaccine against H1N1pdm09 and MERS-CoV using rescued influenza virus carrying the short immunogenic peptide 736-761 of the S protein in the NA gene. The short peptide of MERS-CoV was inserted at position 48 aa in the NA-stalk domain of influenza A/H1N1. This unique site was selected based on the distinct natural deletion in the corresponding neuraminidase subtype (N1) of H5N1 isolates in Egypt since 2006 [16, 17] . For safety reasons, we preferred to test the NA of H1N1 instead of H5N1 as a shuttle for the MERS-CoV spike immunogenic epitope.",

At week 4, an apparent decline in antibody levels of specific immune response was observed. This is likely related to a traditional phenomenon, namely self-limitation or resolution, in which the neutralizing antibodies titer is decreased following the booster immunization as a response to the administrated antigens [24, 25] . Several studies showed that the protective efficacy of MERS-CoV vaccines positively correlates with the evoked neutralizing antibody titers in the serum of vaccinated animals [26, 27] .

Briefly, the day before transfection, 293T/MDCK-II cells were co-cultured in a ratio of 3/1 then incubated at 37 \u2022 C, 5% CO 2 . On the day of transfection, 8 \u00b5g of the eight desired DNA plasmids (1 \u00b5g per plasmid) was mixed with Trans-IT2020 (Mirus, Madison, WI, USA) (2 \u00b5L per 1 \u00b5g plasmid) and 184 \u00b5L of Opti-MEM reduced serum medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and incubated for 45 min at room temperature. Afterwards, a volume of 800 \u00b5L of Opti-MEM medium was added to the mixture. The mixture was added drop wise to 293T/MDCK-II cells then incubated at 37 \u2022 C, 5% CO 2 for 6 h. The transfection mixture was replaced with 1 mL Opti-MEM containing 1% antibiotic-antimycotic mixture, and 0.4% bovine serum albumin, and the cells were incubated overnight at 37 \u2022 C,5 % CO 2 . Subsequently, an additional 1 mL Opti-MEM containing Pen/Strep, 0.2% bovine serum albumin (BSA), and 2 \u00b5g L-1-Tosylamide-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-treated trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MI, USA) was added and the cells were further incubated for 48 h. The culture supernatants were harvested and clarified by low-speed centrifugation. Then, we injected the supernatant into the 10-day-old specific-pathogen-free (SPF) embryonated chicken eggs and MDCK-II cells. Standard hemagglutination test (HA) was used to detect the recombinant viruses in the allantoic fluid of embryonated chicken eggs and MDCK-II cells harvest. Recombinant viruses were harvested and propagated in SPF embryonated chicken eggs for three passages. The NA genes of the generated rescued viruses were amplified and sequenced to test stability of the inserted short peptide.",
