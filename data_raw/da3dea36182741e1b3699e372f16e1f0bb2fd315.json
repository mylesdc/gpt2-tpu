Predicted results of 7 tested strains against Con H3 by AntigenCO 6 . *\"I\" means sequence identities of v-region and \"P\" means sequence positives of v-region in BLAST. For example, \"I90\" means under the condition of \"True positive\" defined as sequence similarity over 90% for identities in v-region. The threshold of ROC was set as the point most close to (0, 1) a AUC value means the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, range from 0 to 1. host, we take the 28 complexes from mice for further examine. The correlation between epitope compositional difference and the V-region sequence similarity was increased to 0.8725 (antibody positive similarity) and 0.8666 (antibody identity similarity), as being shown in Supplementary   Fig. 10 . The high correlation above suggests the feasibility of using V-region sequence similarity of antibodies as a measurement of antigenicity similarity. However, we also noted that the same conformational epitope of lysozyme may induce quite different V-region antibodies from different immune host. For instance, the sequence identify score of V-region is only 75% between human antibody (2EIZ) and mice antibody (1XGP) to the same lysozyme epitope. This seems to indicate that it is more meaningful to adopt V-region sequence similarity of antibodies as a measurement of antigenicity similarity in the case of same immune host.",

Then, the AUC (Area Under the Curve) value of the ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve, true positive rate, accuracy, and balanced accuracy were calculated (Supplementary Table 9 ). Different resolutions of the spin-image and the searching granularity of neighbouring residues were also scanned to identify an optimized parameter combination to balance the computational time and the accuracy (Supplementary Table 10 Fig. 11) ,",

All 309 unique epitopes were clustered according to the CE-BLAST similarity score as shown in Supplementary Fig. 12B . Further analyses revealed that lysozyme epitopes are the most abundant, with 40 structures, and that HIV gp120 epitopes are the second most abundant, with 23 structures. Interestingly, several sub-clusters were identified for both the lysozyme epitopes and the gp120 epitopes in Supplementary Fig. 12B , indicating mutated, overlapping or unique epitopes. Supplementary Fig. 12C illustrates the performance of CE-BLAST on the lysozyme family, with an AUC value above 0.92, an accuracy value above 0.85, and a balanced accuracy value above 0.92 under different V-region similarity cut-off values. The results for gp120 can be found in Supplementary Fig. 14 . According to background data from the PDB, a similarity score over 0.7 is empirically derived to select highly similar epitopes, a score below 0.6 indicates different epitopes, and a score in between these two values often indicates similar or partially overlapping epitopes.",

Using the lysozyme epitope 1J1O_Y (PDB id: 1J1O; Chain Y) as a random query, the similar epitopes are ranked according to similarity score in Supplementary Table 11 , together with their sequence similarity for the V-region of the corresponding antibodies. The top 8 epitope structures are actually the same epitope, followed by 6 highly similar epitopes with one or two residue deletions, then by 2 partially overlapping epitopes (Supplementary Table 12 ). Similar results were observed for the gp120 epitopes (Supplementary Table 13 ). As displayed, the CE-BLAST score agrees well with the sequence difference of the V region in the corresponding antibodies. The above results suggest the outstanding performance of CE-BLAST both in a large testing dataset across antigen class and in a specific class of antigen mutants. All of the 559 epitope structures derived from immune complexes in the PDB have been combined into a built-in epitope database for the user to search against in CE-BLAST. ",

The PDB ID and corresponding chain information can be found in Supplementary Table 8. The preferable standard of antigenicity similarity would be derived from a series of antibody or antiserum cross-reactivity data such as HI assays for influenza virus. Due to the data scarcity of the cross-reactivity between antigens in immune complexes, we used the sequence similarity of the variable (V) regions of the corresponding antibodies as a measurement of antigenicity similarity between epitopes. To check its qualification as a quantifier of antigenicity similarity, the sequence similarity of the (V) regions of antibodies were examined in correlation with the variance of epitope compositions. Lysozyme was chosen as an example under test since it is the largest protein family in our dataset. There are total 40 lysozyme-antibody complexes in PDB. The size of lysozyme epitopes is on average of 26\u00b14. The Pearson correlation coefficient between epitope compositional difference and V-region similarity of corresponding antibodies can reach 0.7346 (identities). From the literature recording, antibodies are derived from different immune host such as mice (28 complexes), camelus, gallus and human. Considering the V-sequence bias of different immune",

When setting the true positive cut-off as 100% V-region identity, CE-BLAST can give an overall AUC value above 0.95; when using 98% V-region identity as the cut-off, CE-BLAST gives an AUC value of 0.96, indicating the outstanding ability of CE-BLAST to compare epitope similarities. Considering the potential bias caused by the unbalanced dataset, random sampling was performed under different parameter combinations with the same number of positive and negative samples. CE-BLAST achieved an AUC value of over 0.978 under all cut-offs of 98% positive/identities or 100% positive/identities (Supplementary",

The \"Con H3\" nucleotide sequences were chemically synthesized by Shanghai Generay Biotech Co, Ltd and then constructed onto the DNA vaccine vector pVKD1.0 from VacDiagn Biotechnology (Suzhou, China), resulting the DNA vaccine pVKD1.0-CON H3. Then DNA vaccines were prepared by endo-free plasmid Giga kit (QIAGEN) for subsequent animal immunization.",

Specific pathogen free (SPF) female 6-8 week old BALB/c mice (Shanghai Slaccas, China) were administered intramuscularly (i.m.) DNA vaccines three times at the interval of two weeks. Two weeks after the final inoculation of vaccines, mice were sacrificed and serum were harvested and used in the subsequent neutralization assay.Meanwhile, five additional SPF female 6-8 week old BALB/c mice (Shanghai Slaccas, China)were administrated above vaccine regimen. Two weeks after the last immunization, mice were sacrificed and splenocytes were collected to fuse with SP2/0-Ag14 myeloma cell lines.Hybridomas were screened with the pseudovirus based neutralization assays. Antibodies were purified by HiTrap Protein G HP columns (GE Healthcare, NJ) from supernatants of positive hybridomas.",
