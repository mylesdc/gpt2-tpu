In this report, comprised of 2 large connected sets of data, SKP2 and its association with BECN1 is examined for their roles in regulating autophagy. The authors identify how SKP2 effects BECN1 levels via ubiquitination and how inhibition of SKP2 by either siRNA or inhibitory compounds effect BECN1 and autophagy. The report then presents data on the role of autophagy and MERS-CoV where live virus and individual MERS-CoV proteins are shown to effect autophagy flux. The large amount of data is technically impressive however significant questions arose on this review.",

First, how much 3-MA was used? Specificity of its inhibition diminishes at higher concentrations above 10uM. The data presented show that 3-MA is not working in this assay, as there is no decrease in long-term protein degradation observed unlike siSKP2 which shows an increase in long-term protein levels when knocked down. Why should 3-MA not show an increase in this experiment? This is the same result in Figure 4D where 3-MA has no effect on protein levels. This is not discussed in the text. Figure 4 , there are several controls missing in the figure. First, there are no toxicity controls showing that the range of each inhibitor used is below significant cell toxicity levels. Secondly, the control in 4D using HBSS as an inducer of autophagy is not shown. Please show experimental evidence that in this experiment HBSS induces autophagy. Third, in 4E, BECN1 levels increase with all drugs; however LC3B increases with only 2 of them, and there doesn't seem to be a change in P62. There should be some correlation between these results but there is no consistency.",

            "text": "6. As MERS-CoV infection and proteins are considered for their role in autophagy, there are several conflicting results. First, the figure numbering does not match the text. Secondly, in Figure 5E , for the WCE blot it is not clear how you can observe both SNAP29 and STX17 in the same blot where it does not show up in the IP blots. Shouldn't they be in the same complex since they are crosslinked so they show as 1 band? The order of 5F and G should be reversed. And 5F is not clear. I assume it is a quantitation of 5G, however it does not match the data in 5G. The relationship between ATG14 monomeric and oligomeric forms and autophagy is not made clear. Are there published data showing oliogomeric ATG14 actively inhibits autophagosome to lysosome fusion, or simply that it fails to promote fusion? Also, if MERS is inhibiting oligomerization, I would expect there to be an increase in monomer, which is not seen. Does total ATG14 amount change? Please clarify. figure S3 is also confusing. First, the cropped cells in S3E do not line up, please clean up the cropping. Secondly, there does not seem to be an increase yellow staining and a correlated decrease in red staining in the single cell shown in each panel. This example cell does not correlate with F. Third, the mutant viruses with either 4b or 5 deleted are great, however does the 4b deletion virus still contain the entire 4a coding region or was is 4a ORF effected when 4b was deleted? The oligos are in the methods section but no explanation in the text to the sites of the deletion. There are also no growth curves showing the 2 deletion viruses compared to WT virus. Do they grow equally well in the experiments or are they attenuated in their growth under control conditions? Fourth, the virus output that is examined in K is only looking at mRNA with no statistically significant different noted however it is stated in the text that the SKP2i inhibitor effects MERS growth. The K panel seems to be missing data. And the correlation should be with virus titer not mRNA since the autophagy effect would be expected to be on virus egress not transcription?",

They nicely demonstrated that SKP2 targets BECN1, an autophagy protein which is involved in autophagosome formation and maturation in two different complexes. SKP2 executes K48-ubiquination at K402 of BECN1, allowing its proteosomal degradation. Activity of SKP2 is negatively controlled by FKBP51, which regulates SKP2 phosphorylation. Pharmacological and genetic inhibition of SKP2 leads to autophagy activation, with increased BECN1 levels, and increased interaction between lysosomal and autophagy SNARE proteins. They identified and studied a pharmacological compound, SMIP004, which strongly inhibits SKP2. The results presented her are novel, technically sound and contribute to a better understanding of autophagy regulation.",

MERS-CoV is a human betacoronavirus responsible of a severe viral respiratory disease, first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012. A third of reported patients with MERS have died and no antiviral treatment is currently available. They first demonstrated that MERS CoV blocks autophagy, in particular the fusion between autophagosome and lysosome, using several reliable autophagy monitoring experiments. They identified three nonstructural viral proteins which can recapitulate the block of the autophagic flux observed during viral infection. They constructed recombinant viruses deleted for these genes but unfortunately poorly characterized their phenotype.",

Unfortunately, they only evaluated viral genome production by RT-PCR at two different times post infection. Virus titers were not determined by plaque assay or TCID50 and no growth kinetics are presented, as expected for this kind of studies. Because a similar inhibition was observed with other compounds which interact with BECN1 and stimulate autophagy, they conclude that SMIP004 acts by stabilizing BECN1. They also tested FDA approved compounds reported to inhibit SKP2 and identified for several of them an antiviral activity against MERS-CoV. They conclude from this part of the work that inhibition of SKP2 leads to an important restriction of MERS CoV multiplication and represents an interesting therapeutic approach. This second part is quite interesting but suffers from speculative interpretations and lack of data from the literature. Some important experiments regarding the mechanism of antiviral activity of SMIP004 are missing and should be added to support their interpretation of the data.",

Indeed, the presence of DMVs during Mouse Hepatitis virus infection (another betacoronavirus) has been reported in 2002 in the reference 17 cited by the authors. However, a more recent study, Regiorri et al demonstrated that DMVs are coated with the nonlipidated form of LC3 (LC3-I) and that LC3-II the autophagic marker and autophagy have no role on viral production. This was confirmed in the journal Autophagy by Zhao et al who demonstrated that MHV replication does not require Atg5. Therefore, it is established that autophagy has no role on MHV replication. However, it has been reported that autophagy negatively regulates TGEV replication (Sci Rep 2016). But another study reported a proviral role of autophagy on TGEV (Oncotarget 2016). Indeed, TGEV infection induces mitophagy to promote cell survival and possibly viral infection.",

A decrease of BECN1 expression is not sufficient to conclude this, when in parallel they observed an increase of the total number of autophagic vesicles during infection compared to control cells ( Fig S3F) .

Growth kinetics of the different viruses showing viral titers (pfu/ml) at different times need to be added instead of measuring an inhibitory effect of the deletion ( fig 6B) . More importantly, the authors did not report that in two previous independent studies (ref 44 of this article and Almazan et al, Mbio, 2013), construction of equivalent mutant MERS-CoV (no expression of orf5 or orf4ab) led to different results. Indeed, recombinant viruses lacking orf5 expression replicated to high titers (44). Similarly, Almazan et al observed that virus titers, cpe and plaque morphology of MERS-delta5 are similar to that of parental virus. In the case of MERS-delta4ab the viral titer was only 10 fold lower at 72hpi. How the authors explain this discrepancy? This can be related to an improper way to quantify viral production. Usually viral titers are determined by plaque assay (pfu/ml) in growth kinetics at different times of infection. In this study, they use RT-PCR in supernatant to detect viral genome but this experiment does not measure viral infectivity. However, no quantification of LC3-II/LC3-I is available and the expression level of LC3-I seems important compared to other WB of the article.",

            "text": "Reviewer #3: Remarks to the Author: Autophagy is a cellular homeostatic pathway that can mediate degradation of obsolete organelles, misfolded proteins and other cargo like viral components. Being a destructive process, autophagy has to be tightly controlled. Indeed, intricate signalling pathways regulate both induction and flux rates of autophagy. Recent reports have highlighted the impact of autophagy on many cellular processes and its role as an anti-viral mechanism. Gassen et al had previously identified FKBP51 as a beclin-binding protein, which mediates induction of autophagy (Gassen et al, 2014&2015). Continuing their work on autophagy, they elaborate on the mechanism. FKBP51 is assembling an autophagy-promoting complex, which deactivates/dephosphorylates the E3 ligase SKP2. Inactivated SKP2 no longer mediates K48-linked polyubiquitination of beclin-1 thereby stabilizing its protein levels and promoting autophagy. Furthermore, the authors characterise the interplay between autophagy and MERS-CoV. While infection inhibits autophagic flux via several viral proteins, exogenous activation of autophagy by pharmacological inhibition of SKP2 combats MERS-CoV infection. Experiments characterising autophagy are conducted in a convincing way and the data supports the claims of the authors. The paper by Gassen et al features an elegant exploration of the complicated mechanism of FKBP51 and links SKP2 to beclin-1. They manage to assemble puzzle pieces from previously published studies about the regulation of SKP2 (e.g. Rodier et al, 2008 and others) complemented by their own data to suggest assembly of a multi-protein complex that regulates stability of beclin-1. Finally, this study provides novel data on how to combat viral infections (here MERS-CoV) using insights gained from understanding the molecular mechanism of autophagy induction and virus-autophagy interplay. However, occasionally it feels like there are two (interesting) separate stories existing side-by-side (Mechanism of FKBP51/SKP2, Interplay between autophagy and MERS-CoV), which need to be tied together more tightly. A few specific issues need to be addressed as well: Major: 1. Treatment with drugs can have multiple effects on viral replication. Therefore, even though all used drugs presumably target a similar pathway, it has to be made sure that autophagy is responsible for viral attenuation. The authors should conduct experiments in which autophagy is induced (e.g. by mentioned drugs), but the effects of this induction are blocked. For example, can the growth attenuation be rescued if autophagic turnover is blocked by chloroquine, or LC3B conjugation inhibited by ATG5 KO/KD? Furthermore, the chosen drugs used to inhibit SKP2 (even though it is backed up by literature) need direct evidence that SKP2-dependent beclin-1 ubiquitination is reduced. 2. The interesting data on MERS-CoV prompts the question, how do other viruses, which are known to be sensitive towards autophagy, react towards inhibition of SKP2. Experiments exploring the effect of the drugs on e.g. Sindbis Virus or HIV-1 replication should clarify that issue and would complement the MERS-CoV data and make it less focused on treating a single virus with a system potentially applicable for other viral pathogens. 3. Fig. 2C : To show that SKP2 is the E3 ligase which ubiquitinates beclin-1, the authors should include a SKP2 E3-ligase null mutant and monitor beclin-1 levels/degradation. The effect observed in Fig. 2C -F should be rescued by MG132 treatment, to prove its proteasome dependent degradation. 4. Fig. 3 : A few additional details have to be clarified: Is Beclin-1 K402R resistant towards degradation induced by either PHLPPi treatment or SKP2 overexpression? Since AKT1 is involved in the cascade, does pharmacological inhibition of AKT1 lead to stabilization of beclin-1? Minor: 1. The abstract needs rephrasing to emphasise the achievements of this paper in a more cohesive and appealing way. The current abstract undersells the story. 2. The title of the paper could be shortened to sound less convoluted. 3. Writing of the results section (first part) might need improvement to make it more accessible. Furthermore, mechanistic details could be presented more cohesively to focus on the achievements of the paper. 4. Please add size markers to all the western blots. 5. Fig. 1 B: Stabilization of beclin-1 levels by MG132 has to be compared to NH4Cl treatment, to rule out turnover by autophagy. 6. Fig. 2A ,B: It would be interesting to see the whole Western Blots (especially for USP18 and USP36, including the input). 7. Fig. 2C ,D: Since SKP2 is regulated by phosphorylation. It would be curious to see how phosphomimetic and phospho-null mutants of SKP2 would impact beclin-1 stability. 8. Fig. 3 I: Please show one exemplary western blot of a protein degraded by autophagy. 9. Fig. 4 E: Please add a quantification for the western blots as shown in the figure. 10. Fig. 5D and E: Both figure panels could be moved to the supplements, as the effect observed is only marginal and other data presented is stronger. 11. Fig. 6A : While interesting, the sketch could be moved to the supplements. 12. Fig. 6G : Could be moved to the supplements 13. Fig. 6E : While manual counting is certainly being used a lot, these assays could be alternatively quantified using flow cytometry to get data, which might be less biased by manual observation. 14.

In order to directly show that virus production (on request of reviewer 2 we are avoiding the word \"propagation\", because this refers to spreading from cell to cell which we do not show directly) is affected we determined the reduction of plaque forming units/ml in parallel to virus RNA copies per ml. Based on this comment and comments from the other reviewers, we performed new experiments and now display the fold difference (log10 scale) of the RNA analysis (genome equivalents, GE) and the plaque forming units, as well as the raw data of the genome equivalents in the new Figures 9B and S9A -C. Figure S9A shows the unprocessed data of the detected genome equivalents per ml, which are in good agreement with the GE data of the first submission. Clearly, the RNA analysis and the determination of the pfus revealed the same pattern of activity, indicating that both assays are valid to investigate the influence of autophagy inducers on MERS-CoV replication/growth. We chose to examine the role of autophagy on MERS-CoV growth in multi-cycle replication assays in order to identify meaningful effects that reflect physiological conditions. Only a few MERS-CoV particles are necessary to establish an infection in the respiratory tract. All assays were, therefore, performed with a low MOI. Importantly, we used two different time points (e.g. 24 and 48 hours post infection) to account for effects during the exponential growth of the virus (24 hours) and the plateau of virus production (48 hours). Comment 3. The control protein for Figure 2 is TRAF6 to show that there is no effect on BECN1 protein levels via an additional ubiquitination protein. However TRAF6 is not included in the pulse chase experiments in Figure 2E and F. It should be shown as a comparison to vector alone.",

All these data are consistent with an inhibitory effect of SKP2 on autophagy regulated by a phosphorylation cascade involving FKBP51, PHLPP and AKT1.",

Third, the mutant viruses with either 4b or 5 deleted are great, however does the 4b deletion virus still contain the entire 4a coding region or was is 4a ORF effected when 4b was deleted? The oligos are in the methods section but no explanation in the text to the sites of the deletion. There are also no growth curves showing the 2 deletion viruses compared to WT virus. Do they grow equally well in the experiments or are they attenuated in their growth under control conditions? Fourth, the virus output that is examined in K is only looking at mRNA with no statistically significant different noted however it is stated in the text that the SKP2i inhibitor effects MERS growth. The K panel seems to be missing data. And the correlation should be with virus titer not mRNA since the autophagy effect would be expected to be on virus egress not transcription?\"",

SKP2 executes K48-ubiquination at K402 of BECN1, allowing its proteosomal degradation. Activity of SKP2 is negatively controlled by FKBP51, which regulates SKP2 phosphorylation. Pharmacological and genetic inhibition of SKP2 leads to autophagy activation, with increased BECN1 levels, and increased interaction between lysosomal and autophagy SNARE proteins.

Unfortunately, they only evaluated viral genome production by RT-PCR at two different times post infection. Virus titers were not determined by plaque assay or TCID50 and no growth kinetics are presented, as expected for this kind of studies. Because a similar inhibition was observed with other compounds which interact with BECN1 and stimulate autophagy, they conclude that SMIP004 acts by stabilizing BECN1. They also tested FDA approved compounds reported to inhibit SKP2 and identified for several of them an antiviral activity against MERS-CoV. They conclude from this part of the work that inhibition of SKP2 leads to an important restriction of MERS CoV multiplication and represents an interesting therapeutic approach. This second part is quite interesting but suffers from speculative interpretations and lack of data from the literature. Some important experiments regarding the mechanism of antiviral activity of SMIP004 are missing and should be added to support their interpretation of the data. In conclusion, this article reports totally new and important data on both autophagy regulation by SKP2 and on interaction between MERS-CoV and autophagy and a possible antiviral role of autophagy, which can be used as an innovative therapeutic approach.\"",

These compounds, in contrast to SKP2i, do not change the levels of BECN1, but increase autophagy by redirecting BECN1 function towards the autophagy pathway, which we confirmed in VeroB4 cells (Fig. S7B-D,G) . Enhanced autophagy was indicated by the increase of LC3B-II/I (Fig. S7E,G) and the reduction of P62 (Fig. S7F-G) . This was paralleled by inhibition of MERS-CoV replication by up to 60-fold in the case of the BECN1-peptide (TAT-B) (Fig. S7H) and 10-fold in the case of ABT-737 at 48 h p.i. (Fig. S7I) .

Continuing their work on autophagy, they elaborate on the mechanism. FKBP51 is assembling an autophagy-promoting complex, which deactivates/dephosphorylates the E3 ligase SKP2. Inactivated SKP2 no longer mediates K48-linked polyubiquitination of beclin-1 thereby stabilizing its protein levels and promoting autophagy. Furthermore, the authors characterise the interplay between autophagy and MERS-CoV. While infection inhibits autophagic flux via several viral proteins, exogenous activation of autophagy by pharmacological inhibition of SKP2 combats MERS-CoV infection. Experiments characterising autophagy are conducted in a convincing way and the data supports the claims of the authors. The paper by Gassen et al features an elegant exploration of the complicated mechanism of FKBP51 and links SKP2 to beclin-1. They manage to assemble puzzle pieces from previously published studies about the regulation of SKP2 (e.g. Rodier et al, 2008 and others) complemented by their own data to suggest assembly of a multi-protein complex that regulates stability of beclin-1. Finally, this study provides novel data on how to combat viral infections (here MERS-CoV) using insights gained from understanding the molecular mechanism of autophagy induction and virus-autophagy interplay. However, occasionally it feels like there are two (interesting) separate stories existing side-byside (Mechanism of FKBP51/SKP2, Interplay between autophagy and MERS-CoV), which need to be tied together more tightly.",

Combined with the other reviewers' comments, and in line with this comment, we tried to make sure that the core of our findings comes across, which is a novel pathway for the induction of autophagy. The potential usefulness of compounds addressing this pathway in fighting MERS-CoV infection serves more as an example of possible applications. Whether or not MERS-CoV has evolved mechanisms to tone down autophagy probably is less relevant in this context, but it is a question that naturally comes up and this is why we explored this also. The abstract now focusses more on the novel pathway leading to autophagy induction: \"Beclin1 (BECN1) is a key regulator of autophagy. We here identified S-phase kinase-associated protein 2 (SKP2) as E3 ligase that executes lysine-48-linked polyubiquitination of BECN1, thus promoting its proteasomal degradation. FK506 binding protein 51 associates with and stabilizes BECN1 by scaffolding the assembly of a hetero-complex involving PHLPP, AKT1, SKP2 and BECN1 that limits phosphorylation and thus activity of SKP2. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of SKP2 decreases BECN1 ubiquitination, decreases BECN1 degradation and enhances autophagic flux. Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is an emerging and lethal human respiratory virus for which no specific treatment is available. We found that MERS-CoV multiplication results in reduced BECN1 levels and blocks the fusion of autophagosomes and lysosomes. Inhibitors of SKP2 not only enhanced autophagy but also reduced the replication of MERS-CoV up to 28,000-fold. The SKP2-BECN1 link constitutes a novel target for host-directed antiviral drugs and possibly other autophagy-sensitive conditions.\"",

The report then presents an entirely separate story, on the role of autophagy and MERS-CoV including live virus and how individual MERS-CoV proteins are shown to effect autophagy flux. It is unclear why these 2 stories are combined into this large of a paper and it diminishes the goal of making a clear and organized manuscript. The first story on SKP2 and Beclin1 are clear and direct while the second story on MERS-CoV and how it effects and is affected by autophagic machinery is still unfinished with data that is discordant with the text descriptions of it.\"",

We realized that there was a mistake in the column coloring for DMSO in Figure 9B which may have caused confusion. We apologize for this and corrected the colors. The DMSO black column (left) and gray column (right) were switched. In addition, we would like to emphasize that one has to compare all gray columns (24 hours post infection) and all black columns (48 hours post infection) separately. In Figure 9B the DMSO control was set to 1 for both time points and cannot directly be related to Figure S9A which shows the raw data in log scale. As growth differences are difficult to identify on a log scale we decided to show fold-change in relation to the DMSO control in Figure 9B . Since the presentation of the fold differences in Figures 9B and S9B are mathematical derivatives of the raw data displayed in Figures S9A and S9C The reviewer is completely right by saying that a direct comparison between GE/ml ( Figure S9A ) and PFU/ml (Figures S9C) shows some minor discrepancies for some of the compounds. This may be explained by interference of the respective compounds with the production of infectious viral particles which may subsequently influence the GE/ml to PFU/ml ratio. Mechanistic details of these minor discrepancies were not addressed and would be beyond the scope of this paper.",

The authors have now added in the data showing TRAF6 ectopically expressed in this experiment. The text states, as well as the graph of the western blots, that TRAF6 ectopically expressed in the cells does not effect Beclin 1 levels. However the western blots associated with Figure 2E clearly show a stabilizing effect on Beclin1 protein levels, which does not correlate with the graph shown in Figure 2F . There does not seem to be a way to connect the western blot data with that graphed in Figure 2F . The data suggests that the ectopic expression of SKP2 shows beclin1 degradation at the same level as expression of TRAF6. This is not what is shown in the western blots. It is unclear how the graph could be made from the data provided in the figure.\"",

Our rationale was to preserve an equal number of subgenomic mRNAs. E. coli GS1783 cells (kindly provided by K. Tischer and K.

In a second step, the kanamycin selection marker was excised by an inducible in vivo I-SceI cleavage and the second Red recombination event. Rescue and stock production of the recombinant viruses were performed as described elsewhere 84 .\"To the question whether these truncated viruses grow equally well:Figure S4E,F shows virus growth of the 3 different recombinant viruses in Vero B4 wt and ATG5 KO cells. ATG5 KO cell experiments were performed in response to the request of reviewers #2 and #3 and are included here to not overly expand the number of figures and panels.

It looks like Nature Communications does not have graphical abstracts; we will check with the editors. \"Page 5: Please add a short sentence with the reasoning why only 'SKP2, USP18 and USP36 have the potential to influence K48-linked' etc.\"The rationale at the beginning of our study was to focus on USPs and E3 ligases that were found in an interaction assay with FKBP51, the results of which were kindly made available to us by Susan Lindquist. TRAF6 was included as a control, because it is an E3 ligase and FKBP51 interactor, but does not perform K48-linked polyubiquitination (K63 instead, Sci. Signal. 3, ra42 (2010)).The section now reads (end of page 6): \"Based on the results of an FKBP51 mammalian-2-hybrid interaction screen 38 , we first verified the association of FKBP51 with the USPs 18 and 36, and with the E3 ligase SKP2 by immunoprecipitation in HEK293 cells (Fig. 2A). TRAF6 that is known as an E3 ligase of BECN1 39 and interactor of FKBP51 40 served as a control. Of these FKBP51 inter-actors, SKP2, USP18 and USP36 have the potential to influence K48-linked poly-ubiquitination of BECN1. Co-immunoprecipitations of BECN1 in HEK293 cells revealed association with SKP2 only(Fig. 2B), which has not been described as an E3 ligase of BECN1 before. However, inhibition of SKP2 has been previously linked to induction of autophagy41,42  .\"Minor comment 19: \"Page 11: mRFP does not resist degradation in the lysosome. It is merely not inactivated by low pH like GFP.\"for other betacoronaviruses 53 . MERS-CoV p4b has phosphodiesterase function inhibiting the activation of RNAse L, which itself can activate autophagy 69 . MERS-CoV p5 is located in the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment 56 and was shown to inhibit IFN-beta induction 70 , which may constitute another link to autophagy 71 .Deletion of p4b or p5 resulted in reduced MERS-CoV growth. These results differ from previous observations, which may be related to different cell lines and cDNA clone construction strategies72,73  . In addition, we used a very low MOI and a type I IFN-deficient cell line (VeroB4), which allows to determine minor growth differences. Interestingly, the absence of p4b and p5 during MERS-CoV replication resulted in lower LC3B levels compared to MERS-CoV wildtype-infected but also to the mockinfected control cells. This points to a more complex interaction between virus replication and autophagy; p4b and p5 may counteract a response of the host to viral infection, but the functional relevance of their link to autophagy requires further investigation. Apparently, several CoV proteins collaborate to reprogram the membrane traffic in the cell for DMV formation serving as compartments of viral genome replication and transcription20,27,74  . Since autophagy is tightly linked to intracellular membrane traffic and turnover, it appears possible that MERS-CoV blocks autophagy not only to evade degradation but also to improve membrane availability.\"",

We agree that mechanistic details on MERS-CoV intervention of the autophagic flux would be favorable.

Therefore we think that this kind of studies should be dealt with separately at a later time point.

While the phosphomimetic SKP2 S72D/S75D mutant destabilized Beclin1 like WT SKP2, the phopsho-null mutant S72A had no effect. These data are now included as figure 4B,C:Reviewer #1: Remarks to the Author: The extensive revisions in this manuscript add to the already large datasets that was included in the original version. The amount of data in this new version clearly separates between 2 stories. The authors identify how SKP2 effects BECN1 levels via ubiquitination and how inhibition of SKP2 by either siRNA or inhibitory compounds effect BECN1 and autophagy. The report then presents an entirely separate story, on the role of autophagy and MERS-CoV including live virus and how individual MERS-CoV proteins are shown to effect autophagy flux. It is unclear why these 2 stories are combined into this large of a paper and it diminishes the goal of making a clear and organized manuscript. The first story on SKP2 and Beclin1 are clear and direct while the second story on MERS-CoV and how it effects and is affected by autophagic machinery is still unfinished with data that is discordant with the text descriptions of it.In response to my initial comments:1. The addition of the raw fold changes and PFU/ml are helpful in determining the effects of autophagy on MERS-CoV replication however the RNA and PFU levels do not correlate with each other. In the added figures of Figure 9B and the supplementary figures associated with it, the fold changes and raw PFU and genome numbers do not correlate with increases and decreases going in opposite directions. There is also no quantitation of significance in these figures making it difficult to interpret as described in the text. 2. In Figures 7, 8 and 9 and the supplementary data associated with the figures, especially supplementary figure 9, there are no significance values for many of the experiments. Does this suggest that the findings are not significant when not calculated? The text claims significant differences however that is not evident in the calculations of the figures. 3. The newly added TRAF6 control data requested in Figure 2 does not correlate with the graph presented. An initial concern for this figure is that ectopic TRAF6 was not included in the pulse chase experiments in Figure 2E and F. The authors have now added in the data showing TRAF6 ectopically expressed in this experiment. The text states, as well as the graph of the western blots, that TRAF6 ectopically expressed in the cells does not effect Beclin 1 levels. However the western blots associated with Figure 2E clearly show a stabilizing effect on Beclin1 protein levels, which does not correlate with the graph shown in Figure 2F . There does not seem to be a way to connect the western blot data with that graphed in Figure 2F . The data suggests that the ectopic expression of SKP2 shows beclin1 degradation at the same level as expression of TRAF6. This is not what is shown in the western blots. It is unclear how the graph could be made from the data provided in the figure. 4. The addition of Figure S2D in response to the question of whether the use of HBSS and BafA1 are inducing autophagic flux as expected is warranted. However again the quantification of the western blot and the images of the western blot are not the same. The graph suggests that the LC3II/I ratio is the same for HBSS and BafA1 treatment however the western blot does not show that same correlation. It is clear in the western blot provided that the 2 sets of data are not equal. While the western blot does show reduction of LC3II in HBSS treatment suggesting autophagic flux, the data do not correlate between the graph and the blot shown.Reviewer #2: Remarks to the Author: The authors had greatly strengthened the manuscript by performing further assays to corroborate their findings and they moderated their conclusions based on reviewer's suggestions.
