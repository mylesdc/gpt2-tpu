Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is the most challenging threat to the swine industry worldwide. Currently, commercially available vaccines are ineffective for controlling porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) in pigs. Therefore, a pharmacological intervention may represent an alternative control measure for PRRSV infection. Hence, the present study evaluated the effects of DiNap on the replication of VR2332 (a prototype strain of type 2 PRRSV). Initially, in vitro antiviral assays against VR2332 were performed in MARC-145 cells and porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs). Following this, a pilot study was conducted in a pig model to demonstrate the effects of DiNap following VR2332 infection. DiNap inhibited VR2332 replication in both cell lines in a dose-dependent manner, and viral growth was completely suppressed at concentrations \u22650.06 mM, without significant cytotoxicity. Consistent with these findings, in the pig study, DiNap also reduced viral loads in the serum and lungs and enhanced the weight gain of pigs following VR2332 infection, as indicated by comparison of the DiNap-treated groups to the untreated control (NC) group. In addition, DiNap-treated pigs had fewer gross and microscopic lesions in their lungs than NC pigs. Notably, virus transmission was also delayed by approximately 1 week in uninfected contact pigs within the same group after treatment with DiNap. Taken together, these results suggest that DiNap has potential anti-PRRSV activity and could be useful as a prophylactic or post-exposure treatment drug to control PRRSV infection in pigs.",

            "text": "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is the most economically important infectious disease for the swine industry worldwide. PRRS is characterized by reproductive failure in sows and respiratory disease in pigs of all ages [1, 2] . The annual loss associated with PRRS is approximately 664 million USD, as estimated by swine producers in the United States [3] . PRRS virus (PRRSV) is a member of the Arteriviridae virus family in the order Nidovirales, along with equine arteritis virus (EAV), murine lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV), and simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV) [4, 5] . PRRSV is a small, enveloped virus with a single-stranded, nonsegmented, positive-sense RNA genome that is approximately 15 kb in length [5, 6] . The genome of PRRSV encodes at least ten open reading frames (ORFs) called ORF1a, ORF1b, ORF2a, ORF2b, ORF3, ORF4, ORF5a, ORF5, ORF6, and ORF7 [7, 8] . PRRSVs used to be grouped into European (type 1) and North American (type 2) genotypes, but currently classified as two species, betaarterivirus suid 1 and betaarterivirus suid 2, respectively. There is substantial genetic and antigenic variation among PRRSV strains, even within the same virus species [9, 10] . Since the first emergence of PRRS more than two decades ago, numerous efforts have been made to develop an effective control measure for this challenging disease. Currently, vaccination is the primary control method, and is widely used to control PRRS in pigs. However, the use of commercial vaccines with either modified live virus (MLV) or killed virus is inadequate to control PRRSV infection [11] because of the highly divergent PRRSV strains in the field. Antiviral therapeutics could be an alternative or additional control measure to combat these viral infections when a successful vaccine that matches the circulating virus is not available. Therefore, pharmacological intervention might be a suitable and useful control strategy for PRRS. Many previous studies reported that a variety of natural compounds had been proven to exert antiviral activity against a number of viruses, such as equine herpesvirus 1 (EHV-1) [12] , hepatitis B virus [13] , human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) [14] , and respiratory infections including the common cold [15] and PRRSV [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] . However, no such effective drugs are commercially available to prevent PRRSV infection. Chalcones (1,3-diaryl-2-propen-1-ones), which constitute a key class of natural products belonging to the Flavonoid family [30] [31] [32] [33] , were previously reported to have a wide range of biological activities, such as antiviral, antibacterial, antifungal, immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, antitumor, insect antifeedant, and antimutagenic activities [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] . Thus, the present study aimed to evaluate the antiviral effects of DiNap [(E)-1-(2-hydroxy-4,6-dimethoxyphenyl)-3-(naphthalen-1-yl)prop-2-en-1-one], a synthetic analog of the chalcone flavokawain, on PRRSV replication in cell culture systems. A study was then carried out in a pig model to demonstrate the inhibitory effects of DiNap on PRRSV infection.",

DiNap reduced VR2332 replication in both cell lines in a dose-dependent manner ( Figure 1 ). In MARC-145 cells, VR2332 replication was decreased by approximately 10-or 1000-fold in the presence of DiNap at concentrations of 0.02 or 0.04 mM, respectively. Viral growth was completely suppressed at a 0.06 mM concentration of DiNap, while the lowest concentration (0.01 mM) did not exert a significant effect on viral replication ( Figure 1A ). In addition, DiNap did not show significant toxicity in MARC-145 cells, even at a concentration of 0.06 mM at up to 48 h post treatment (hpt) ( Figure 1C ). Consistent with the results obtained in MARC-145 cells, in PAMs, DiNap also reduced VR2332 replication by approximately 10-or 100-fold in the presence of the 0.02 or 0.04 mM concentrations; the highest concentration (0.06 mM) caused the complete suppression of VR2332 replication, while 0.01 mM DiNap was not effective ( Figure 1B) . Similarly, DiNap did not cause significant toxicity in PAMs, even at concentrations of 0.06 mM at up to 48 hpt ( Figure 1D ). a prototype PRRSV, was evaluated at five different concentrations (0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.04, and 0.06 mM) in MARC-145 cells (A) and porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) (B) by measuring progeny virus production over time. Both types of cells were prepared in 6-well cell culture plates, and the cell monolayers were pretreated for 2 h before infection with growth medium containing DiNap. Then, the cells were inoculated with VR2332 at an MOI of 0.01 and incubated for 1 additional hour. The cell monolayers were replenished with growth medium containing the same concentrations of DiNap and incubated for 4 additional days under the same culture conditions. An MTT [3(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] assay was also conducted on both cell lines to assess the cytotoxicity of DiNap in MARC-145 cells (C) and PAMs (D) at the same concentrations described above. The cytotoxicity data are expressed as the relative cell viability. Asterisks indicate significant differences (* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.001) in viral replication between groups.",

DiNap, a synthetic analog of the chalcone flavokawain, was evaluated in this study for its potential antiviral activity against PRRSV infection in cell culture systems and in a pig model. Chemically, DiNap is a synthetic analog of flavokawain, containing a chalcone scaffold of 1,3-diaryl-2-propen-1-one. DiNap has a 2-hydroxy-4,6-dimethoxybenzene moiety at the C1 position of 2-propene-1-one, which is a common structural feature of the naturally occurring compounds flavokawain A, B, and C. DiNap also contains a naphthalenyl moiety at the C3 position of 2-propene-1-one, which has been found in several antiviral agents [41, 42] . In addition, chalcones, the main pharmacophore of DiNap, have been reported to show a wide spectrum of biological activities, including antiviral [43] , antioxidative [44] , and anti-inflammatory activities [45] . These previous studies are further supported by the results presented in the current study. DiNap effectively suppressed VR2332 replication in MARC-145 cells and PAMs at concentrations ranging from 0.02 to 0.06 mM, without showing significant cytotoxicity, even at up to 48 hpt. It is worth noting that the highest concentration of DiNap (0.06 mM) used in this study completely suppressed VR2332 replication in both cell lines (Figure 1) . Although approximately 20% cell death was observed when DiNap was added at 0.06 mM, no significant side effects or toxicity were observed after treatment in pigs.",

Consistent with these findings, the pigs treated with DiNap also had fewer lesions (gross and microscopic) in their lungs than the control pigs ( Figure 5 ), suggesting that DiNap exerted significant effects on PRRSV infection. More importantly, two injections of DiNap were able to delay virus transmission by approximately 1 week with direct contact between the infected (virus challenged) and uninfected (not virus challenged) pigs in both treatment groups (groups 2 and 3). However, the virus was easily transmitted between the infected and uninfected pigs in the untreated control group (group 1), indicating that DiNap could be useful as a prophylactic or postexposure treatment agent in cases of PRRSV infection. Because DiNap was produced in limited quantities on a laboratory scale, the antiviral effect of DiNap was only preliminarily evaluated with a small number of pigs in the current study.

Then, qRT-PCR (TaqMan) and ELISA were used to confirm that the pigs were negative for PRRSV. On day 0, one pig (1, 4, and 7 in groups 1, 2,and 3, respectively) in each group was challenged with VR2332 at a titer of 10 3 /mL TCID 50 (2 mL/pig) through the intranasal (IN) route, and the challenged pigs were then maintained in their groups to observe the transmission of the virus to the unchallenged contact pigs. On the same day, all 3 pigs in group 2 and group 3 were injected with 0.32 mM (0.04 mM/kg body weight) and 1.6 mM (0.2 mM/kg body weight) DiNap prepared in 2 mL of DMSO behind the base of each ear intramuscularly (IM), respectively. All 3 pigs in group 1 constituted the nontreated challenged control (NC) group. The treatment with DiNap was repeated with the same concentrations at 3 dpc. After this, the pigs were observed daily for clinical signs up to 28 dpc. The pigs were weighed at 0 (before challenge) and 28 dpc. Serum samples were collected at 0 (before challenge), 7, 14, 21, and 28 dpc for virological and serological assays. At the end of 28 dpc, all pigs were euthanized, and the results of pathological examinations, including the presence of gross lung lesions, were recorded by an expert pathologist based on the standard scoring system, as described previously [57] . In addition, lung tissue samples were collected in 10% neutral buffered formalin for the examination of microscopic changes. Furthermore, additional lung tissue samples were collected and stored at \u221280 \u2022 C until analysis. Viral loads were quantified in the serum and lung tissue samples. The animal experiment protocols were approved by the Chonbuk National University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (approval number: 2012-0025).",
