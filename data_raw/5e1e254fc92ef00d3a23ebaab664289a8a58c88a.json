However, few studies have compared different reassortant combinations in pseudoparticle systems, or compared entry kinetics of native viruses and their pseudotyped analogs. Here, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-based pseudovirions displaying distinct influenza virus envelope proteins were tested for fusion activity. We produced VSV pseudotypes containing the prototypical X-31 (H3) HA, either alone or with strain-matched or mismatched N2 NAs. We performed single-particle fusion assays using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy to compare hemifusion kinetics among these pairings. Results illustrate that matching pseudoparticles behaved very similarly to native virus. Pseudoparticles harboring mismatched HA-NA pairings fuse at significantly slower rates than native virus, and NA-lacking pseudoparticles exhibiting the slowest fusion rates. Relative viral membrane HA density of matching pseudoparticles was higher than in mismatching or NA-lacking pseudoparticles. An equivalent trend of HA expression level on cell membranes of HA/NA co-transfected cells was observed and intracellular trafficking of HA was affected by NA co-expression. Overall, we show that specific influenza HA-NA combinations can profoundly affect the critical role played by HA during entry, which may factor into viral fitness and the emergence of new pandemic influenza viruses.",

The SLB contained a mixture of zwitterionic lipids, cholesterol, total ganglioside extract (TGE), and Oregon green DHPE 19, 21 . TGE contains glycolipids that possess sialic acid groups necessary for influenza binding. Oregon green DHPE is a pH-sensitive fluorophore embedded in the SLB that drastically decreases in emission intensity when exposed to an acidic solution, marking the time when HA-activating acidification occurs in the microfluidic channel. The fluidity of SLBs was confirmed by using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) performed prior to the fusion assay. Membrane fluidity of SLBs can affect the hemifusion kinetics and is thus a crucial parameter to control when comparing the rate of fusion between assays 17, 21 . The average diffusion coefficient for three samples was determined to be 0.847 \u00b1 0.03 \u03bc m 2 /s which corresponds to the value measured in a previous study 21 .",

            "text": "HA-mediated membrane fusion is a multistep reaction that begins with hemifusion (the merging of the outermost leaflets of the host and viral membranes). Hemifusion commences when hemagglutinin is exposed to an acidic solution, which triggers major conformational changes of the viral envelope protein. Pseudovirions were treated with TPCK-trypsin for 15 min at 37 \u00b0C in order to cleave the precursor HA 0 into HA 1 and HA 2 , which is an essential activating step for successful membrane fusion to occur 13 . To track the fusion reaction and its intermediate steps, viral membranes were labeled with quenched amount of octadecyl rhodamine B chloride (R18). Upon membrane hemifusion, the membrane dye that originated in the viral envelope spreads into the SLB and dequenches as the fluorophores diffuse radially away from the hemifusion site, an event that is easily detected by a CCD camera (Fig. 3, bottom) . Fusion experiments were carried out within a channel for 3-4 min at a data collection rate of 10 frames/s. The hemifusion lag time is defined as the interval of time between the pH drop and hemifusion for each individual virion. Within the field of view, hemifusion is marked by individual dequenching events. The lag time distributions are fit to the cumulative gamma distribution: where k H is the hemifusion or pore formation rate constant, t is lag time, and N is an additional fit parameter reporting the number of rate-limiting steps. In the context of fusion kinetics, N is often correlated to the number of HA trimers that must act concertedly to initiate fusion 19 , but is mathematically defined as the number of steps in the pathway. The gamma distribution is appropriate here, as fusion events occur stochastically and independently of each other. Each fusion event is a multistep process, with each step in the process being described by a Poisson process. The gamma distribution is a convolution of multistep Poisson processes. We characterized the hemifusion behavior of native influenza X-31, native-matching pseudoparticles (H3 X-31 / N2 X-31 ), human:human mismatching pseudoparticles (H3 X-31 /N2 MS96 ), human:avian mismatching pseudoparticles (H3 X-31 /N2 Japan ), and HA only pseudoparticles (H3 X-31 ) over a range of initiation pHs. Figure 4 illustrates hemifusion rates by showing the cumulative gamma distribution data at the upper and lower limits of HA conformational change activation, pH 4.5 and pH 5.1, respectively. At pH 4.5 and 5.1, the rate of hemifusion of native influenza X-31 and matching pseudoparticles (H3 X-31 /N2 X-31 ) are similar and are distinctively faster than that of other pseudoviruses, including the HA only pseudoparticles (H3 X-31 ).",

The hemifusion rate constants of matching pseudoparticles (H3 X-31 /N2 X-31 ) and native influenza X-31 are similar at all initiation pHs. The hemifusion kinetics of native influenza viruses is strongly dependent on pH as well as matching pseudoparticles (H3 X-31 /N2 X-31 ). The rate of hemifusion increases almost linearly from pH 5.3 to 4.7 and reaches a plateau at the \"fastest\" fusion pH. It is not evident from the data shown in Fig. 5 that mismatching pseudotyped particles (H3 X-31 /N2 MS96 ) exhibits the same dependence on pH. While the maximum rate of fusion of mismatching pseudovirions (H3 X-31 /N2 MS96 ) also occurs at pH 4.7, the error associated with the parameter falls within the rate constant values associated with adjacent pHs, thus it can be concluded that the hemifusion kinetics of mismatching pseudotyped particle (H3 X-31 /N2 MS96 ) is triggered by acidification but rate independent of triggering pH. pH independent influenza fusion rate is not unprecedented, as we also observed a similar flat trend for a clinical isolate, A/Brisbane/2007/H3N2 17 .",

At high, physiological pH values, N values for influenza virus X-31 and matching pseudovirions (H3 X-31 /N2 X-31 ) are found to be approximately 3, while the N values of human:human mismatching pseudovirions (H3 X-31 /N2 Japan ) vary between 1.5 to 3. A few possible interpretations of this variation include a change in the number of HA contributing to bending the membrane over this range, but this is hard to rationalize with our understanding of the fusion process. It may reflect that other processes are dominating the kinetics in this regime, but it also seems at odds with what we know about hemifusion, that there would be such oscillations among rate limiting steps within this range. What seems most likely to us is considering that N is an exponential fit parameter; it gives rise to an inherent sensitivity in data fluctuations and thus produces a wider range of output values. Considering that the authentic X-31 does not have such variation in its fits for N, we may attribute these fluctuations as resulting from variations among the particles themselves: the HA incorporation in VSV pseudotypes are lower than the authentic influenza X-31, or that the morphology of the rhabdoviral pseudovirions are bullet-shaped compared to the spherical morphology of authentic X-31. For human:avian mismatching pseudotyped particles (H3 X-31 /N2 MS96 ) and HA-only pseudopaticles (H3 X-31 ), N is consistently closer to unity as a function of pH. These findings suggest that only one HA trimer may be needed for mismatching pseudotyped particle fusion. However, since hemifusion is a multi-step process, an N value equal to 1 more likely indicates that another process less dependent on viral particle properties, e.g. the merging of membranes, may occur so slowly that kinetics are dominated by this single step, thus resulting in a gamma distribution where N = 1 22 .",

The internal VSV matrix protein (M protein, ~37 kDa) was used to normalize band intensities of HA. The three hemagglutinin bands include one uncleaved HA (HA 0 ) at 75 kDa and the cleaved HA (HA 1 and HA 2 ) at 50 kDa and 25 kDa, respectively (Fig. 6 ). HA 1 bands were normalized to corresponding VSV M bands to calculate the cleaved proportion of HA protein in different samples. The normalized bands were normalized again to the HA 1 bands of HA only pseudoparticles (H3 X-31 ) so the values could be compared between different HA-NA combinations. HA band intensities of human:avian mismatching pseudoparticles (H3 X-31 /N2 MS96 ) and human:human mismatching pseudoparticles (H3 X-31 /N2 Japan ) are ~45% and ~20% lower than X-31 matching pseudoparticles (H3 X-31 /N2 X-31 ), respectively. Considering that a successful viral fusion event may require at least three HA trimers, a lower density of HA trimers on mismatching pseudoparticles may explain the slower fusion rate we have measured.",

The data demonstrates the hemifusion kinetics of NADNA-treated influenza virus and non-treated virus are similar at pH 4.0 and pH 5.1, and there were no significant differences on viral binding either. The hemifusion rate constant of NA inhibitor treated virus is 0.24 s \u22121 with a value of 2.5 for N at pH 4, and 0.06 and 1.9 at pH 5.1. That NADNA does not affect hemifusion kinetics of the virus follows the conclusions of Ohuchi et al.'s work 29 , where they also found that NA inhibitors do not impact either binding or fusion; however, they suggest that NA function does impact endocytosis, and in this way, impacts \"entry\". Since the SPT assay presented here isolates binding and fusion processes from endocytosis, our results corroborate Ohuchi et al.'s observations and reinforces our conclusion that differences in expression level (HA/NA) balance among particles is important for the fusion process.",

While it is well known that mutations and the reassortment of gene segments generates this diversity, understanding the consequences of different combinations of viral genes, particularly those encoding HA and NA still awaits further elucidation. Some studies have shown that a functional balance of HA and NA is required for virus replication 30 and that insufficient NA enzymatic activity leads to the formation of virus aggregates on egress 31 . Here, we have investigated how incorporation of different NAs affect the fusion function of the HA protein and provide more evidence for a potential role for NA during entry and glycoprotein transport. Using a VSV-based viral pseudotyping approach we were able to specifically study the interplay between HA and NA. This system allowed us to study the co-incorporation of H3 HA and N2 NA of the prototypical strain X-31 and to switch N2 NAs of different strains. We produced four different types of influenza pseudoparticles: pseudoparticles containing HA only (H3 X-31 ), X-31 HA and NA matching pseudoparticles (H3 X-31 /N2 X-31 ), and to model N2 NA gene reassortment, human:human mismatching pseudoparticles (H3 X-31 /N2 Japan ) and human:avian mismatching pseudoparticles (H3 X-31 /N2 MS96 ). Particles that incorporated both X-31 HA and NA displayed distinctly faster fusion kinetics than those harboring HA only. Further, we show that the X-31 matching pseudoparticles (H3 X-31 /N2 X-31 ) exhibit similar hemifusion kinetics than native influenza X-31. Other combinations of particles display different kinetics from the native particles.",

However, the degree of NA incorporation by Western blot showed that the densities were similar for the three different NAs in the pseudoparticles. These results are also supported by the immunofluorescence microscopy assay that shows that HA trafficking varies considerably depending on which NA is co-expressed in transfected BHK-21 cells, leading to differential HA expression on cell plasma membranes, whereas NA expression does not seem as affected. These analyses demonstrate that NA does not act directly on HA function but rather has an indirect effect by modulating the trafficking and incorporation of HA into pseudotyped viral particles. Our work shows that switching NAs of the same subtype (N2) can have profound effect on fusion kinetics mediated by the HA protein. This study suggests that HA-NA combinations form pairs of varying compatibility that can ultimately impact HA fusogenicity. In summary, we show that influenza X-31 H3 HA requires its matching neuraminidase to maximize the HA packaging density on VSV pseudoparticles, and the matching pseudoparticles exhibit similar hemifusion kinetics as influenza X-31 by single virion fusion assay.",

All Western blots were visualized and analyzed using a Chemidoc XRS+ system with Image Lab image capture software (BioRad). TheImage Lab software was used to quantify intensities of bands using low sensitivity setting. The software detects the bands by the signal contrast between band and background. We note that all bands have only been adjusted in contrast and brightness in the Image Lab software. The software shows the original signal intensities of the bands.",

Microfluidic devices were formed using polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) in a molding process. The silicon mold was coated with chlorotrimethylsilane (Sigma-Aldrich) via vapor deposition to facilitate the release of cured PDMS. A 10:1 (elastomer:crosslinker) mixture of Sylgard 184 (Dow Corning) was mixed and degassed to remove bubbles before pouring on the silicon mold. The PDMS then was crosslinked in the oven for 3 h at 80 \u00b0C. Both the piranha cleaned glass cover slip and the microfluidic device were assembled by oxygen plasma bonding. They were first treated with oxygen plasma using a Harrick Plasma Cleaner (Model # PDC-32G, Ithaca, NY) at a pressure of 750 millitorr on the \"high\" setting for 15 s. The two pieces were then pressed together gently to form a tight bond and annealing was performed at 80 \u00b0C for 15 min.",

To heal defects in membranes, a 5% dilute solution of liposomes was drawn into the microchannel at 10 \u03bc L/min for 5 min. Before loading virus-containing solutions, channels were rinsed again with GPMV buffer at 100 \u03bc L/min for 2 min. TIRF microscope configuration. Single-particle fusion assays were operated using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM) with an inverted Zeiss Axio Observer.Z1 with an \u03b1 Plan-Apochromat 100\u00d7 oil immersion objective with a numerical aperture (NA) of 1.46. Index-matching immersion oil (Carl Zeiss, Inc.) was added to the glass coverslip of the microfluidic device and the objective. Two lasers with 561 nm and 488 nm excitation wavelengths were used to simultaneously excite red and green fluorophores under this setting. The Laser TIRF 3 slider (Carl Zeiss, Inc.) was used to control the angles of incidence in the optical pathway. Exceeding the critical angle (~62\u00b0) generates total internal reflection due to the difference in refractive indices of the two different substances (glass and aqueous buffer), and further creates an evanescent wave that penetrates about 100 nm into the aqueous buffer. Because virion binding and fusion occurs within a ~100 nm thick region, the evanescent wave can excite fluorophores near the membrane and eliminate the background noise from viruses floating in the bulk aqueous phase.
