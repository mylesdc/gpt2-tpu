Nitric oxide (NO), as an important signaling molecule, has antiviral activity on some viruses. To date, there is little information on the role of NO during PCV2 infection. Results: We used indirect fluorescence assay (IFA), TCID 50 , real-time RT-qPCR and western blot assay to reveal the role of NO in restricting PCV2 replication. PCV2 replication was inhibited by a form of NO, NO \u2022 , whereas PCV2 was not susceptible to another form of NO, NO + . Conclusion: Our findings indicate that the form of NO \u2022 has a potential role in the fight against PCV2 infection.",

            "text": "Porcine circovirus (PCV) is a small, non-enveloped virus with a circular, single-stranded DNA genome, belonging to the family Circoviridae, genus Circovirus [1] . Three genotypes of PCV are known to us, including PCV1, PCV2 and PCV3 [2] . PCV1 is non-pathogenic to pigs, PCV3 is characterized by PDNS, reproductive failure, as well as cardiac and multisystemic inflammation, PCV2 is pathogenic as the agent of porcine circovirus associated disease (PCVAD), which is a globally emerging disease with a huge impact on swine-producing countries [3, 4] . Post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS), the first recognized PCVAD in Canada in 1991 [5] , appears in growing pigs at the age of 5 to 18 weeks characterized by clinical signs of progressive weight loss, fever, enlarged lymph nodes, respiratory distress, and, occasionally, jaundice and diarrhea [6] . Common measures taken to prevent and control PCVAD were considered as follows: management improvement, control of co-infections, control of breeding and semen quality, improvement of herd nutrition, serum therapy and vaccination [7] . To our knowledge, no effective antiviral therapy has been adopted to control PCV2 infection in clinical settings.",

            "text": "NO is a short-lived and reactive free radical that is chemically able to diffuse within biological systems. In mammalian cells, the production of NO is catalyzed by a family of NO synthases (NOSs), which facilitate the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-dependent reaction of L-arginine with O 2 , to yield NO and L-citrulline [8] . Besides, NO-generating compounds, such as sodium nitroprusside (SNP), S-nitroso-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP), S-nitrosoglutathion (GNSO) and so on, can also release NO. It has been reported that SNP alone provides NO + as the major form of NO in culture media while SNP in the presence of ascorbate generates mostly the reduced form of NO, NO \u2022 [9] . The antiviral activity of NO activity has been demonstrated against a variety of viruses including Marek's disease virus, astrovirus, dengue virus type 2, herpes simplex virus type 1 and Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . Our previous study show that NO-generating compound GSNO suppresses PCV2 infection in vitro and in vivo [15] , and the other studies also confirmed that PCV2 replication could be suppressed by L-arginine in vivo [15, 16] . As L-arginine is the natural precursor of NO [17] , whether the inhibition of PCV2 induced by L-arginine is associated with NO, it remains unknown to us.",

Another report revealed that PCV2 deployed PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) and glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) for its enhanced replication in PK-15 cells [19] . A recent study found that G0/G1 cell cycle arrest induced by PCV2 may provide favorable conditions for viral protein expression and progeny production [20] . Meanwhile, enhancement of PCV2 replication induced by LPS, IFN-\u03b1/IFN-\u03b3 and concanavalin A was demonstrated [21] [22] [23] , whereas Cytotoxicity of SNP, VC and SNP plus VC on PK-15 cells tested by MTT assay. After incubation with the drugs for 72 h, MTT was added into each well. The cells were cultured for another 4 h and 200 \u03bcl DMSO was added into each well for dissolving formazan, then A570 of the samples were determined with a microplate reader (Sunrise, TECAN Co., Swiss). Relative viability was calculated according to the equation: Relative viability (%) = A570 of the drug-treated sample/A570 of the untreated sample \u00d7 100. Data shown were means \u00b1 SD from three independent experiments. Statistical significance was indicated in relation to the untreated control group: *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 Fig. 2 Kinetics of NO production in culture supernatant of PK-15 cells. When 80% confluent monolayers formed, NAP, SNP, VC and SNP plus VC were added into 96-well cell culture plates, four wells for each treatment, and nontreated cells served as the control. Supernatant from each sample was collected at different time points, then NO levels were quantitated by Griess reaction with a microplate reader at 540 nm and compared to a standard curve made from sodium nitrite. Data were presented as means \u00b1 SD from three independent experiments (**P < 0.01 vs the untreated control group, #P < 0.05 vs SNP-treated group) decreased PCV2 replication mediated by L-arginine, matrine and selenium was confirmed in vitro and/or in vivo [15, 24, 25] . Although the antiviral activity of NO has been proved by much research work, regulation of PCV2 replication induced by NO remains unknown to us. In this study, treatment of infected cells with NO \u2022 generated from SNP plus VC resulted in suppression of the growth of PCV2 while treatment with NO + generated from SNP alone had no effect. Our data implied that the inhibitory effect of NO on PCV2 replication was induced by the radical form of NO \u2022 , not NO + . Interestingly, A previous report revealed that NO \u2022 released from SNP plus ascorbate could delay and block rabies replication in neuroblastoma cells, while viral replication was not influenced by NO + generated from SNP alone, and this data was similar to our study [26] . The mechanisms involved in the antiviral properties of NO were partially confirmed in previous studies, indicating that NO played an important role in regulation of viral protease [27] , innate immunity of the host [11] , as well as viral protein and nucleic acid synthesis [28] . For PCV2, we found that NO generated from SNP plus VC inhibited synthesis of infectious virions by reducing the number of viral infected cells and by downregulation of viral titers and viral DNA copies.",

When monolayers reached about 50% in each well in 24-well cell culture plates, the cells were incubated with NAP or SNP or VC or SNP plus VC for 6 h, four wells for each treatment. After washing, the cells were infected with PCV2 (1 MOI), and then cultured with the drugs for another 72 h. Nontreated cells served as mock, and the infected-cells without drug treatment were infected control. As for IFA (a), the cells in different groups were washed with PBS, then fixed with cold methanol, and all stained for PCV2. Since FITC-Fluorescence could be observed in PCV2-infected cells, the appearance of PCV2-positive cells was judged by FITC staining intensity, examined under a fluorescence microscope (Olympus, Japan). In addition, supernatant from each well was collected for determination of NO production (b), meanwhile, the cells in each sample were also gathered for assay of relative infected cells (c), virus titers (d), virus DNA copies (e) and virus Cap expression. NO levels were quantitated by Griess reaction. Relative infected cells were determined by flow cytometry, calculated as a percentage of infected control. Virus titers were detected by IFA, evaluated by Reed-Muench method. Virus DNA copies were measured by qPCR. virus Cap expression was determined by western blot assay. Data were presented as means \u00b1 SD from three independent experiments (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 vs infected control) at 37\u00b0C in an atmosphere of 5% CO 2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Sigma, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (GIBCO, USA) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin antibiotics (Sangon, China).

The cells were cultured for another 4 h and 200 \u03bcl DMSO was added into each well for dissolving formazan, then A570 of the samples were determined with a microplate reader (Sunrise, TECAN Co., Swiss). Relative viability was calculated according to the equation: Relative viability (%) = A570 of the drug-treated sample/A570 of the untreated sample \u00d7 100. Data shown were means \u00b1 SD from three independent experiments. Statistical significance was indicated in relation to the untreated control group: *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01",
