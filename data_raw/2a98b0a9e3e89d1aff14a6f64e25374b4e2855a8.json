Generally a researcher will provide as input a gene region conserved throughout the taxa that the assay is being designed to detect. The software then provides possible primer/probe sets. The researcher chooses a representative signature. If there are single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the chosen conserved region, a signature with consensus primers and probes is often chosen. Next a BLAST [2] search is performed to ensure that the primers are not hitting other targets. Finally the signature is verified in vitro with laboratory strains.",

However, in addition to better design strategies, methods for automated signature evaluation are needed.

These databases were designed to contain only whole genomes and whole segments from segmented genomes.

TaqSim uses BLAST searches to find sequences that match both forward and reverse primers and probe. To be reported as a \"hit\" the primers and probe must match in the required orientations relative to one another and the primers must be in sufficiently close proximity. The forward/reverse primers may fall on either the plus or minus strand, so long as the orientation relative to one another is appropriate. There may not be mismatches at the 3' end of either primer. For each hit TaqSim calculates the primer and probe melting temperatures as bound to the candidate hit sequence (accounting for mismatches) based on reaction conditions (reagent concentrations and hybridization temperature), and returns sequences predicted to be amplified. Instead of replicating the various exact reaction conditions reported in each paper, very lenient settings were applied in all cases, essentially removing the screen for primer/probe vs. candidate hit Tm by setting this threshold to 0\u00b0K, and instead checking for specificity by requiring that hits have fewer than 3 mismatches per primer or probe.",

MSC begins by removing non-unique regions from consideration as primers or probes from each of the target sequences relative to a database of nontarget bacterial and viral sequences. The remaining unique regions of each target sequence are mined for all or many candidate signatures, without regard for conservation among other targets, yet satisfying user specifications for primer and probe length, T m , GC%, avoidance of long homopolymer runs, and amplicon length. All candidate signatures are compared to all targets and clustered by the subset of targets they are predicted to detect. Signatures within a given cluster are equivalent, in that they are predicted to detect the same subset of targets, so by clustering we reduce the redundancy and size of the problem to finding a small set of signatures that detect all targets. Nevertheless, finding the optimal solution of the fewest clusters to detect all targets is an NP complete problem, so for large data sets we use a greedy algorithm to find a small number of clusters that together should pick up all targets. In the supplementary table, we often provide more than one alternative signature to detect a given equivalence group of genomes to serve as a backup should a signature perform poorly in laboratory testing. Some of the signatures may have mismatches to some of their intended targets, although these mismatches are not predicted to reduce the T m of primer/probe hybridizing to target below typical TaqMan reaction conditions. None of these computationally predicted signatures have been screened in the laboratory, as this is beyond the scope of this paper. ",

Even more than 4 genomes are needed for particularly diverse organisms. Thus, older signatures may not perform as well as newly developed signatures from the most up-to-date sequence data. A future study of interest would be a longitudinal look at how these rates continue to change over time as additional sequences become available.
