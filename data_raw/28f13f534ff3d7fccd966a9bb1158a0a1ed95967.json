Due to lack of vaccine and unavailability of effective therapy, the prevention of HCV infection has been a great challenge, especially in China, which is the largest developing country and owns one-fifths of the world's population. The population of China had approached 1.35 billion at the end of 2011 [4] . Although the prevalence of HCV infection had been lower in China after mid-1990s and the overall prevalence of anti-HCV was less than 1% in recent years [5, 6] , the huge size of China population makes the absolute number of people infected with HCV enormous.",

Shunquan Wu et al used spatial technique to work on the prevalence of HCV infection in Fujian province, and found that the HCV infection did have a relationship with spatial factors and the cluster of disease [11] . Apart from this study, the HCV infections in some provinces were more serious than other surrounding provinces, which might attribute to poor economy, inadequate primary health infrastructure, or inappropriate treatments [1] . In addition, HCV infection shares the same transmission routes with HIV infection, which had been already observed cluster of disease in studies [12, 13] . Especially for the intravenous drug users (IDUs), the prevalence of co-infection of HIV and HCV are high [14] , and the HIV epidemics have association with geographic factors [15] .",

After being checked, confirmed case reports were saved in the web-based system. The procedure of reporting HCV case through CISDCP is consistent around the whole country.
