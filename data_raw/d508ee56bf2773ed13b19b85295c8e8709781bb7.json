            "text": "In March 2003, the health care system in Toronto, Canada, was confronted with an outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), a highly contagious and severe atypical pneumonia. [1] [2] [3] The infection control measures employed in response to this crisis were extraordinary and unprecedented. Actions to control SARS in the Greater Toronto Area included the closure of four hospitals, the cancellation of all non-emergency surgical services, an almost complete curtailment of inter-hospital patient transfers, and the postponement of most hospital-based outpatient clinics. [4, 5] Moreover, access to physicians, hospital laboratories, imaging studies, and other hightechnology services was limited by infection control procedures. [5] The effect of these measures on access to health care was underscored by media reports of inappropriate delays for cancer therapy and the inability to perform urgent surgeries, sometimes resulting in death. [6] [7] [8] [9] The effects of widespread limitations of access to medical services have been studied from different perspectives. Studies of influenza outbreaks from the early 20 th century provide insight into healthcare restrictions and are applicable to the SARS experience because both are contagious respiratory illnesses with high mortality rates that are largely controlled through isolation procedures. Previous work has documented increased cardiovascular and other non-influenza related deaths during influenza outbreaks. [10] [11] [12] However, these increases were likely related to the effects of the infection itself rather than limited access to care. [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] Studies of diminished health care access due to withdrawal of medical services during physicians' strikes have documented significant alterations in health service utilization, intermediate outcomes, and various health-related processes of care. [18] [19] [20] However, no rigorous study has examined the effects of physician job action on overall population mortality. [21] While there is little debate regarding the necessity of a concerted response to control the SARS outbreak, the delivery of health care to the general population was clearly reduced. Evidence suggests that in Toronto more essential services were less affected than services for lowacuity conditions. [5] An important question is whether sharply curtailed access to health care had an impact on population mortality due to causes other than SARS. This issue will be highly relevant in the event of a future infectious disease emergency, such as a recurrence of SARS, a highly virulent influenza epidemic, avian flu, the emergence of a new infectious organism, or a bioterrorist attack with an agent such as smallpox. We therefore sought to determine if the infection control measures undertaken during the 2003 SARS outbreak in Toronto were associated with a change in overall population mortality.",

She died at home but spread the virus to her family members, who initiated the outbreak when they were admitted to hospital. However, since our intent was to estimate the effect of the public health containment measures on the overall population, we defined the period of the SARS outbreak as beginning on March 27, 2003 (the 13 th week of the year). [4] On this date, the province of Ontario declared a state of emergency and issued special directives to all hospitals in the Greater Toronto Area (City of Toronto, York Region, Durham Region, Peel Region, Halton Region, and Simcoe County) instructing them to curtail inter-hospital transfers, elective surgery, and outpatient services. [22] As a result, health care utilization in the Greater Toronto Area decreased significantly. [5] Inpatient procedures such as abdominal aortic aneurysm repairs, cholecystectomies, and joint replacement surgeries decreased by 24-55%. Cardiac surgeries and percutaneous coronary interventions decreased by about 40%. Outpatient procedures such as breast biopsies, chemotherapy infusions, and vasectomies decreased by 16-93%. Outpatient diagnostic tests such as MRI and CT scans decreased by 34-51%. Outpatient physician visits decreased by 16% overall, and emergency department visits decreased by 25%. In contrast, medical care in the area of Ontario outside of the Greater Toronto Area had increased infection control measures but comparatively little restriction of clinical services. We defined the end of the SARS outbreak as July 2, 2003 (the 27 th week of the year), because this was the date that the World Health Organization removed Toronto from its list of SARS-affected areas.",

The containment strategy did result in dramatic decreases in nonurgent inpatient and outpatient procedures and surgeries, outpatient diagnostic tests, and overall physician visits. [5] Although overall emergency department visits declined substantially during the SARS outbreak, this decline apparently reflected significant reductions in the volume of patients with low-acuity complaints. [5, 26] Hospitalizations in Toronto during this period were 12% lower than expected, representing a relatively modest decrease. [27] Studies conducted in other jurisdictions suggest that the changes in health care delivery and care-seeking behavior associated with the SARS outbreak may have had negative health effects. In Taiwan, use of ambulatory care fell by 24%, inpatient care decreased by 35%, and childbirths shifted from larger medical centers to less well-equipped district hospitals and clinics. [28, 29] In Hong Kong, the number of individuals diagnosed with active tuberculosis decreased significantly during the outbreak, suggesting that the population's avoidance of medical care led to delays in diagnosis. [30] On the other hand, another study conducted in Hong Kong found that the proportion of positive samples for influenza and respiratory viruses other than SARS decreased significantly during the SARS outbreak, a change that the investigators attributed to the population's heightened attention to respiratory hygiene.

The establishment of data capture and reporting systems in advance of such an event would provide decision-makers with timely information on possible increases in morbidity and mortality attributable to impaired health care access, in addition to data on the direct effects of the outbreak itself.

First, our study was designed to detect increases in short-term mortality that would constitute an immediate health challenge, but not longer-term effects. Although such delayed consequences are not implausible, they would be difficult to identify and attribute to impaired access to care during the SARS outbreak. Second, our study did not consider outcomes such as health status, quality of life, or other measures of morbidity that may have been affected by SARS-related infection control measures. Instead, we focused on mortality, an outcome that is both readily measured and of unquestioned importance. Future studies are needed to assess the effects of extraordinary infection control measures on morbidity. Third, we chose a clinically plausible lag of four weeks before the onset of change in mortality rates for our interrupted time-series analysis. The selection of a different lag period might have resulted in slightly different findings, although our results were corroborated by the Poisson regression analysis. Finally, this study examines a \"natural experiment\" in which restrictions on health care services were not applied uniformly, instantaneously, or in a randomized manner. Nonetheless, our use of a control group consisting of the population of Ontario outside the Greater Toronto Area, which was not affected by severe restrictions on access to hospital-based care, serves to minimize this potential bias.",

In the situation of a widespread disease outbreak, health care decision-makers understandably concentrate upon the immediate threat of the infectious disease. The SARS experience in Toronto suggests that the preservation of the delivery of health care for other urgent conditions is equally important. This con-cept is particularly relevant because future infectious disease outbreaks, such as avian influenza or a bioterrorist attack, could limit access to health care resources to a much greater extent than did the SARS outbreak. Further research is needed to examine the possible effects of such events on cause-specific mortality rates and on health outcomes other than mortality.",
