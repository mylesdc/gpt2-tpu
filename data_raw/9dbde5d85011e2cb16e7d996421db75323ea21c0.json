The phylogenetic trees based on the S1, M and N genes exhibited considerably different topology and the CK/CH/LSC/99I-type isolates were the predominant IBVs based on the phylogenetic analysis of S1 gene. Results of entropy of amino acid sequences revealed that the S1 gene had the largest variation; the M gene had less variation than the N gene. Positive selections were detected in not only S1 but also M and N gene proteins. In addition, five S1 gene recombinants between vaccine strain 4/91 and CK/CH/LSC/99I-type field isolate were confirmed. In conclusion, multiple IBV genotypes co-circulated; genetic diversity and positive selections existed in S1, M and N genes; 4/91 vaccine recombinants emerged in China. Our results show that field IBVs in China are continuing to evolve and",

The S glycoprotein is post-translationally cleaved into S1 and S2 subunits and S1 is the most divergent region, which carries conformationally-dependent virus-neutralizing and serotype-specific epitopes [4, 5] . The N protein located in the capsid of the virion is involved in RNA replication, assembly and carries group-specific antigenic determinants [6] and has high immunogenicity, readily inducing antibodies and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte immunity in chickens [7] . S1 and N genes have been used most frequently to determine the relatedness of emerging strains of IBV [5, 8] . The M protein is a structural membrane protein and plays an important role in the viral assembly process and particularly is indispensable for many biological functions including viral core stability. Interactions of M and E proteins are important for virus budding and formation of virus-like particles, which are involved in mucosal immunity [9] .",

Therefore, it is extremely critical to identify the prevalence of IBVs and genetic characteristics of circulating strains in a region or a country in order to develop effective vaccines for the control of the disease. Outbreaks of IB have been occurring frequently in China in spite of intensive vaccinations for many years [15, 17, [20] [21] [22] . IB is still a major problem in Guangxi province [15, 17] , which is located in southern China and produces a total of 700 million birds per year and ranks third in China [23] . It is very important to know the genetic characteristics of prevalent strains of IBVs in this region. We previously reported the genotype diversity of Guangxi IBV isolates based on the hypervariable region I (HVR I) of S1 gene [15] , but the available comprehensive genetic information of circulating IBV strains in this region was limited. Therefore, in the present study we performed the analysis of the phylogenetic tree, of the entropy of the amino acid sequences, of positive selection as well as of computational recombination based on the sequencing results of the viral structural protein genes S1, M and N in order to provide molecular epidemiology information of IBV and to lay a good foundation for the control of IB in the field.",

In our study, CK/CH/LSC/99I-type, tl/CH/LDT3/03-type, 4/91-type, Taiwan-type and Mass-type were identified, which suggested that multiple genotypes of IBVs were co-circulating in Guangxi province. Eleven out of 23 isolates sharing 76.8-77.9% S1 gene amino acid sequence similarity with the vaccine strain H120 belonged to CK/CH/LSC/99I-type. However, the prevalent genotype in this region was CK/CH/LSC/99I-type not the LX4-type, which was different from other reports that LX4-type was the dominant genotype in China [20, 22] , indicating IBV strains within this region are unique and distinct.",

A gene which undergoes positive selection promoted by natural selection usually has highly important functions [29] . Some investigators reported positive selection wasn't detected in the spike protein of IBVs although they differed markedly in the sequence of the spike protein [26, 30] . However, other investigators showed different results. Positive selection was detected in the spike protein of IBV California-type viruses, for which no vaccine exists but was not detected in Massachusetts-and Connecticut-types where attenuated live vaccines are routinely used [11] . Another report showed that positive selection was found in the S1 protein of variants isolated from layer-type birds but was not found in variants isolated from broilers, even though a high number of mutations was significantly associated with broiler-type chickens [25] . Positively selected sites in the nucleocapsid protein of the Taiwan IBV and their effects on RNA-binding activity were reported recently [31] . Previous reports on SARS-CoV indicated that positive selection on S protein was changeable in different epidemic groups and positive selection on replicase of SARS-CoV was detected only in human patients, not in any proteins of bat SARS-like-CoV [29] . We found positive selection was observed on S1 protein of 4/91-type and CK/CH/LSC/99I-type strains, M protein of CK/CH/LSC/99I-type and BJ-type strains, N protein of CK/CH/LSC/99I-type and LX4-type strains. Thus, not only S1 protein but also M and N proteins experienced positive selection during the IBV epidemics. The variation of positive selection of S, M and N proteins among different groups may explain why these field variants escape immune pressure and may provide valuable evidence that these three structural proteins may be critical for virus evolution. It is the first time to analyze the positive selection of S1, M and N genes of IBVs.",

High scoring amino acid positions may correlate with structurally or functionally important residues [33] . The greater the entropy is, the higher variation frequency of amino acid sites is. An entropy value bigger than 0.4 indicated the corresponding amino acid site was not conserved [34] . A Shannon entropy analysis of immunoglobulin and T cell receptor revealed that the T cell receptor is significantly more diverse than immunoglobulin-suggesting T cell receptor has new complementarity determining regions, which represent a larger antigen combining site, additional combining sites, or an evolutionary strategy to avoid inappropriate interaction with other molecules [35] . A recent study used the Shannon entropy and relative entropy to measure the diversity of amino acid site of H3 HA between the 1992-1993 season and the 2009-2010 season and showed that the rate of evolution increases with the virus diversity in the current season and the Shannon entropy of the sequence in the current season predicts relative entropy between sequences in the current season and those in the next season [32] . According to our results, the average entropy of amino acid sequences, the percentages of entropy bigger than 0.4 and the number of amino acid sites with high entropy of S1 gene are biggest, and those of N gene were bigger than M gene. Thus, these observations revealed that amino acid sequences of S1 gene had the largest variation; the M gene had less variation than the N gene. To our knowledge, it is the first time to analyze the entropy of S1, M and N gene amino acid sequences. The variation of amino acids will have an important effect on the biological function and evolution of viruses. Hence, observing the biological function of the amino acid residues with higher entropy and identifying the positively selected sites among IBVs will be further studied.",

Besides the Mass-type vaccine, 4/91-type live vaccines are also commonly used in China including during the breeding period [39] , even without official authorization. Our finding provides another evidence that 4/91 vaccine strains are contributing to the emergence of variants in the field in China. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the vaccine licensing system before introduction of exotic IBV strains. We should continued 49/1-type recombinants surveillance in China. The pathogenicity of 4/91-derived recombinants should be assessed in further studies.",

The nucleotide sequences of S1, M and N genes have been submitted to GenBank database and assigned accession numbers (Supplementary Table S2 ). The nucleotide and the deduced amino acid sequences alignments were generated using the ClustalW Multiple Alignment method of BioEdit version 7.0.9.0 and compared with those of 42 reference IBV strains retrieved from the GenBank database with the accession numbers listed in in supplementary material (Supplementary Table S3 ). Phylogenetic trees were constructed based on the amino acid sequences of S1, M and N genes with the Neighbor-joining method (Jones-Taylor-Thornton (JTT) model) and Maximum-likelihood method (JTT model) using MEGA 5.05 version. The bootstrap values were determined from 1000 replicates of the original data.",

A large entropy means the amino acid in the given position is prone to be substituted.

In addition, codon-based tests of positive selection (Z-test, MEGA5) were used to estimate the numbers of non-synonymous and synonymous substitutions per site (dN/dS ratio) within the S1, M and N proteins in order to understand whether these proteins are submit to positive selection.4.6.

The highest acceptable P value was 0.05 and the detection of recombination events was applied between sequences sharing 0 and 100% identity. Seven algorithms in RDP 4.14, including RDP, GENECONV, BootScan, MaxChi, Chimaera, SiScan and 3Seq were used to confirm the recombination events. Two phylogenetic trees, which were constructed from the portion of the alignment between the inferred breakpoints and the remainder of the alignment were made and compared to assess recombination events further. Recombination events and recombination breakpoints were further confirmed by Similarity plot and BootScan analyses using the SimPlot program (version 3.5.1.).",
