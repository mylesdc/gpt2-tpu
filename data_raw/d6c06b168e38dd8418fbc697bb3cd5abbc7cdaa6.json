            "text": "Sepsis is a life-threatening condition caused by an immune response triggered by infection, and highly elevated cytokine/chemokine levels in the blood play crucial roles in the progression of sepsis. Serum exosomes are nanovesicles that have multiple biological functions, playing roles in antigen presentation, intercellular signal communication, inflammatory response and immune surveillance. However, the biological functions and related molecular bases remain to be elucidated. In this study, we investigated the profiles of cytokines/chemokines harbored in the exosomes of septic mice and explored the mechanisms of immunomodulation on T cells treated with exosomes harvested from septic mice. Blood cytokines/chemokines existed in both the soluble form and in the insoluble exosomal form; the profiles of the cytokines/chemokines in these two forms displayed different dynamics in the blood of mice challenged with LPS. Exosomes from septic mice induced the differentiation of Th1/Th2 cells, which was blocked by specific antibodies targeting IL-12 and IL-4. In addition, these exosomes significantly augmented the proliferation and migration of T lymphocytes. Furthermore, preadministration of exosomes by intravenous injection restrained the inflammatory response, attenuated lung and liver tissue damage, and prolonged the survival of cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) mice. Our results indicate that exosomes enriched with cytokines/chemokines play critical roles in T cell differentiation, proliferation and chemotaxis during the sepsis process and have a protective effect on cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) mice. Thus, these findings not only strengthen our understanding of the role of sepsis via exosomes but also provide potential targets for therapeutic applications.",

With the development of sepsis, proinflammatory cytokine levels in the blood are significantly elevated (1) (2) (3) (4) , and Bone (5) noted that \"cytokine storm\" mortality remains elevated for a long period after a septic episode is resolved. During sepsis, high levels of proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines are circulating, and immune responses, including the activation, proliferation and differentiation of T cells, play critical roles in the regulation of sepsis (5, 6) . CD4 + Th cells are the most important lymphocyte subset influencing innate and adaptive immune cells via cytokines and cell-to-cell interactions (7) . Th1 cells are induced by IL-12 and IFN-\u03b3 in response to viral, bacterial and protozoan intracellular infections, and Th2 cells activated by IL-4 are important for the clearance of helminth infections (8, 9) .",

The production of exosomes can be spontaneously secreted depending on the cell type (14, 15) or induced by various stimuli (16) . The biochemical composition of exosomes is variable depending on their cell origin (17) , and exosomes have been shown to play key roles in regulating immune responses. The major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-peptide complexes and antigens carried in exosomes are crucial for initiating and amplifying the immune response (18, 19) , and determining whether circulating cytokines are released in a controlled manner as a compensatory mechanism in response to a stress signal is important. Konadu et al. (20) reported that HIV-infected and viremic individuals exhibited elevated levels of plasma cytokines, and most cytokines were colocalized with exosomes derived from mouse serum. Twenty-one cytokines and chemokines are markedly enriched in HIV-positive exosomes to negatively control and induce the expression of CD38 on CD4 + /CD8 + T cells. The stimulation of RAW 264.7 cells by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) leads to increased exosomal chemokine and RNA levels and is thus involved in the regulation of inflammation (21) . In this study, we isolated exosomes from the sera of septic mice, quantified their cytokine levels and assessed their immunomodulatory effect on lymphocytes to confirm our hypothesis that cytokines can be transferred among cells in septic mouse serum via an exosome secretion mechanism.

The supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 12,000 \u00d7 g at 4 \u2022 C for 45 min to remove small cellular debris.

(A) The Th1 response was augmented by exosomes harvested from septic mouse serum. Lymphocytes were purified from the spleens of C57BL/6 mice and incubated with LPS (1 \u00b5g/ml) or exosomes (Exo-0 or Exo-24, 10 \u00b5g/ml) for 72 h. Flow cytometry analysis was performed to determine the percentage of Th1 cells by quantitating the ratio of IFN-\u03b3-expressing cells to CD4 + T cells. Lymphocytes stimulated with LPS for 72 h (LPS group) were used as a positive control. Data are presented as the mean \u00b1 SD (n = 4), *P < 0.05 vs. the control group; # P < 0.05 vs. the Exo-0 group. (B) The Th2 response was augmented by exosomes harvested from septic mouse serum. Splenic lymphocytes were acquired as described above. After incubation with LPS, Exo-0 or Exo-24 for 72 h, the percentage of Th2 cells was quantitated by the ratio of IL-4-expressing cells to CD4 + T cells by flow cytometry. Lymphocytes stimulated with LPS for 72 h (LPS group) were used as a positive control. Data are presented as the mean \u00b1 SD (n = 4), *P < 0.05 vs. the control group; # P < 0.05 vs. the Exo-0 group.

Purified T cells from splenic lymphocytes of C57BL/6 mice were incubated with exosomes (Exo-0 or Exo-24, 10 \u00b5g/ml) for 72 h.

But we failed to detect any significant difference of the number of exosomes from septic mice in comparison with the control (Supplementary Figure 5) . The proteins in exosomes reportedly vary among different cell types (32, 33) , and in the progression of sepsis, inflammatory cytokines/chemokines are released by various types of immune cells, such as T cells, B cells and macrophages. Cytokines/chemokines in both the soluble and exosomal forms reflect the complicated integration of the bioactivities of all immune cells. However, the two forms of serum cytokines/chemokines displayed different dynamics during the development of sepsis. Most of the soluble cytokines/chemokines, including TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, IL-2, IL-6, IL-12, IL-15, IL-17, IL-10, CCL5, CXCL9, and CXCL10, in the sera of septic mice showed increased levels, which peaked at 2-12 h, whereas most of the cytokines/chemokines in the exosomes showed delayed peak expression at 12-24 h after sepsis modeling. Growth factors, such as VEGF, also showed varying dynamics between the soluble and exosomal forms in the sera of septic mice. Together, these results suggest that most cytokines/chemokines exist in both the soluble form and the exosome form but display different dynamics during the development of sepsis.",

We performed a blocking assay with neutralizing Abs specifically targeting mouse IL-12 ( Figure 3C ) or IL-4 ( Figure 3D) , revealing that the differentiation of T cells was promoted by the IL-12 and IL-4 cytokines, which were associated with exosomes harvested from septic mice.
