In this study, we developed a novel primer/probe set that can be employed to simultaneously detect pan-H5 HPAI and two clades, 2.3.2.1 and 2.3.4.4, of H5Nx viruses using reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). The sensitivity and specificity of these primer sets and probes were confirmed with a number of different subtypes of influenza virus and the H5-HA gene plasmid DNA. In particular, the multiplex RT-qPCR assay was successfully applied to the simultaneous detection of H5 HPAI and different virus clades in clinical field samples from a poultry farm. Therefore, this multiplex assay and a novel detection primer set and probes will be useful for the laboratory diagnosis and epidemiological field studies of different circulating H5 HPAI virus clades in poultry and migratory wild birds.",

Except for influenza H17 and H18 viruses that originated from bats, the waterfowl are known as a primordial reservoir for all subtypes of IAV [1, 2] . Unlike human influenza viruses, avian influenza (AI) viruses are classified into two pathotypes-low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) and HPAI-based on the pathogenicity in chickens and molecular determinants of the multibasic cleavage site motif in the hemagglutinin (HA) protein [3, 4] . During the circulation of HPAI virus subtypes H5Nx and H7Nx in poultry, they proved to be highly pathogenic with mortality of up to 100%. Sporadically, the H5N1 HPAI viruses cross the species barrier into humans. According to the WHO report [5] , different subtypes of H5 HPAI viruses pose a substantial threat to global health with high mortality rate and huge economic burden to poultry farms.",

Among these methods, RT-qPCR has been implemented in most reference diagnostics laboratories for the detection and characterization of IAVs. These diagnostic techniques were developed and used for subtyping or sequencing of novel viruses. However, due to the continuous circulation of H5Nx HPAI and other virus clades in avian species, it is very difficult to control viral transmission in poultry [3] . To effectively control and rapidly diagnose suspected infection on poultry farms, it is important to develop a rapid diagnostic assay for the simultaneous detection of different H5 HPAI viruses [20] .",

            "text": "Despite many efforts to control the spread of H5 HPAI viruses [27] in poultry, such as development of a vaccine and diagnostic systems [28] , viruses evolved and infected wild birds and domestic poultry. In particular, to effectively monitor and control H5Nx HPAI virus transmission, a number of diagnostic techniques, including virus isolation and conventional RT-qPCR, have been reported [29] . Virus isolation is the gold standard for influenza virus diagnosis, but it is time-consuming, expensive, and not suitable for discrimination of multiple HPAI viruses. The conventional RT-qPCR assay is well-known and useful for molecular detection of influenza viruses such as influenza virus subtyping and positive detection using matrix gene detection [30] . In particular, this method detects the fluorescence signal of a positive sample in real time due to using of the target-specific probe/primers, resulting in high sensitivity and specificity. Therefore, the RT-qPCR assay could be widely used as molecular diagnostic technology in clinical fields. To detect H5 HPAI virus and difference of H5 HPAI clade viruses in clinical samples, a multiplex RT-qPCR assay has been developed using several pairs of primers and probes [29, 31, 32] . However, some drawbacks are the reduced specificity and sensitivity of the target gene amplification due to the nonspecific interaction among primers and probes in the same reaction [32] .",

Our one-step multiplex RT-qPCR assay was successfully employed to amplify viruses and IAV-positive field samples using novel primers/probes for the simultaneous detection of pan-H5 HPAI and two clades without cross-reactivity. To enhance the specificity of target detection, we designed a new single primer set and each probe for the conserved sequences of H5 HPAI. After testing the IAV-positive clinical field samples, 51 were H5 HPAI positive and the cycle threshold values of these positive samples ranged from around 20 to 24. Moreover, all H5 HPAI-positive samples were sequenced, and the results were verified by GenBank BLAST processing. Interestingly, the limit of detection of pan-H5 HPAI and clades in the singleplex and multiplex RT-qPCR assays was the same when our new single primer set and each probe combination was used.",

Among several new clades, two clades of H5 HPAI virus, 2.3.4.4 and 2.3.2.1, have been recently prevalent and dominant in Asia such as China [23], South Korea [24], and Vietnam [25]. In particular, 2.3.4.4 clade of H5 virus has spread to China and neighboring countries, such as South Korea",
