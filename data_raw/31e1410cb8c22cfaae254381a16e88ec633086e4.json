Such intrinsic defenses have the ability to detect the pathogen, and either directly block a component of the pathogen's life cycles and / or signal to the innate and adaptive immune system to further control the infection. In certain cases, these intrinsic restriction factors recognise non-self pathogenassocated molecular patterns, such as lipids, proteins and nucleic acids, from a broad range of pathogens through pathogen recognition receptors. This ability allows the host to detect bacterial, viral, fungal and protozoan pathogens [1] . For example, Toll-like receptor 4 alone is able to detect Gram-negative bacteria, fungi, trypanosomes and surface proteins on several viruses [2] . Alternatively, other restriction factors, particularly those that target viruses, appear to have a more reduced range of pathogens that they can block, as is the case for many interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) [3] . However, restriction factors that work in defined cellular locations against a common pathogen feature of infection may also have broad anti-influenza properties.",

Since the discovery of IFITM3's antiviral role, the number of viruses restricted by the IFITM family has expanded considerably [5, [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . This has led to the generation of hypotheses about how the IFITM family achieves restriction; namely through preventing the fusion of viral and cellular membranes [15, 16] .",

Typhimurium) is an intracellular bacteria that enters cells through phagocytosis or by a bacterial-triggered entry mechanism and replicates within endosomal-like structures known as Salmonella-containing vacuoles [30] . In contrast, Citrobacter rodentium (C. rodentium) is a noninvasive, Gram-negative bacterium used to model enteropathogenic and enterohaemorrhagic E. coli infections of the gut [31, 32] , and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) is an intracellular respiratory bacterium that replicates primarily within macrophages and dendritic cells, before forming latent granulomas in the infected organs [33] , and is the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB). We found no evidence for control of M. tuberculosis bacterial growth in murine lungs, despite the fact that the pathogen triggers a type I IFN response [34] , which subsequently up-regulates Ifitm3 expression. Further, a recent study implicated a SNP (rs3888188) in the promoter of IFITM3 with susceptibility to TB [21] , wherein the minority rs3888188-G allele was significantly overrepresented in patients with TB compared to healthy controls in a Han Chinese population. We found no evidence in our murine model that the ablation of Ifitm3 expression impacted on M. tuberculosis infection. However, it should be noted that we only assayed for initial infection and colonisation of the lungs and that the long term dormancy characteristic of human TB is not observed in the mouse model. Furthermore, these differences may have arisen due to our challenge strain differing from that used in the human study; therefore inducing different gene expression signatures.",

Furthermore, eight SNPs in the IFN receptor, IFNAR1, have been associated with the development of cerebral malaria in children; a finding that is corroborated in Ifnar -/-mice, which also do not develop cerebral malaria [37] . IFITM3, along with several other ISGs, are significantly up-regulated in patients that have become infected with P. falciparum [20] . It was shown that deletion of several of these ISGs, including Tbk1 and the double knockout of Irf3 and Irf7 prevented mice from developing lethal ECM [20, 36] . Our work shows IFITM3 is not an ISG involved in the pathogenesis of experimental cerebral malaria. However, we saw that Ifitm3 was important in the control of RSV infection, leading to more severe disease in Ifitm3 -/-mice, as assessed by weight loss, viral load and a dysregulated immune response. Although these trends were seen with influenza virus infection of Ifitm3 -/-mice, the phenotype seen in the RSV challenge is not as striking [6, 38] . This may be due to the response to the different viruses and the genetic background of the mice (C57BL/6 Taconic), which we [39] and others [40] have shown is influential in RSV disease severity.",

Strikingly, RSV infects cells through the plasma membrane and does not require the endosomal pathway. RSV enters airway epithelial cells via F protein binding of nucleolin, which is situated in cholesterol rich microdomains / lipid rafts [47, 48] . RSV is proposed to bind to nucleolin via its F protein, which initiates hemifusion of the RSV envelope with the cell membrane [48] ; thus delivering the viral content directly into the cytoplasm without the need for endosomes.",

Ifitm3, however, is primarily distributed intracellularly on endosomal membranes [50] . Of the Ifitm family members, Ifitm1 is primarily localised to the cell surface [15] : the site of RSV-cell fusion. Therefore Ifitm1, which is functional in the Ifitm3 -/-mice [6] , may provide the strongest block to RSV infection. Previous studies have shown a degree of overlap of function between IFITM1, -2 and -3, with certain IFITMs having specificity for restricting particular viruses [7, 8] . Importantly, IFITM1, -2 and -3 interact and may function co-operatively [15] , possibly with IFITM3 potentiating an IFITM1 restriction of RSV. Indeed, Ifitm1 has been shown to be up-regulated during RSV infection [51] .",
