            "text": "Extracts of Echinacea species have been used traditionally in North America for the control of symptoms of colds, influenza, and other diseases, and some of them have become very popular as \"herbal medicines\". Recent studies have revealed that preparations derived from certain species and plant parts, but not all of them, possess potent antiviral activities, at non-cytotoxic concentrations, particularly against membrane-containing viruses. Thus all strains of human and avian influenza viruses tested (including a Tamiflu-resistant strain), as well as herpes simplex virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and rhinoviruses, were very sensitive to a standardized Echinacea purpurea preparation. In mechanistic studies the influenza virus-specific hemagglutinin and neuraminidase were inhibited. In addition some extracts displayed anti-inflammatory activity in virus-infected cells, and numerous other effects on the expression of cellular genes. Multiple components, either discrete compounds or mixtures, appeared to be responsible for the various antiviral activities.",

            "text": "Acute respiratory infections in humans are usually ascribed to one or more of a group of well known viruses, including more than 100 rhinoviruses (\"common cold\" viruses), influenza viruses A and B, parainfluenza viruses, corona viruses, respiratory syncytial virus, and certain adenoviruses [1] [2] [3] [4] . In addition the recent application of more sensitive molecular detection techniques has revealed the presence of other viruses, such as metapneumoviruses and bocaviruses, which might also be involved in the generation of respiratory symptoms. However we do not know if these newly recognized viruses are really pathogenic, or are simply \"passengers\" that eluded previous diagnostic techniques. Nevertheless various families of viruses, with different structures and replication schemes, and consequently bearing different potential molecular targets, are clearly involved in respiratory symptoms, as indicated in Table 1 . Among the possible targets are: (i) the virion itself; (ii) cellular attachment or entry; (iii) one or more of the many stages in virus replication and development, particularly those that involve virus-specific enzymes; (iv) egress of progeny virus from infected cells. However the variety of replication schemes indicated in Table 1 reduces the chances that a single antiviral drug could target many of these viruses [3, 5] . In addition, in the majority of respiratory infections specific virus information is lacking; consequently it is difficult to conceive of a single therapeutic agent or regimen that could control the \"causative agent\". Nevertheless, in spite of this limitation, considerable time and money has been spent trying to find the \"silver bullet\" for specific virus \"infections\", so far without much success [6] . Another problem with the specific target approach, especially in the case of compounds directed at specific viral genes or their products, is the inevitable emergence of virus resistant mutants and their subsequent spread through the community and environment. The conventional answer to this problem has been the suggestion that two or more antiviral drugs, with distinct molecular targets, be used in combination, notwithstanding the likely increase in undesirable side-effects. A logical alternative approach is the use of a non-toxic agent that has the capacity to inhibit many different respiratory viruses simultaneously, and recent evidence indicates that certain herbal extracts might fulfill this requirement [5, 7, 8] .",

In some cases symptoms may spread to include the lower respiratory tract and lungs, and result in bronchitis, bronchiolitis, or pneumonia [1, 8, 9] . However the symptoms may not be a direct result of virus replication, which in many cases is minimal in airway tissues [10] , but rather an indirect consequence of virus-induced inflammatory responses [5, 11] .",

Other molecules such as kinins are released and are probably responsible for some of the early symptoms. Phagocytic cells and various types of inflammatory cell may then be attracted to the site of infection. In addition the redox balance of the cells may be adversely affected, either by the virus infection itself or as a consequence of the pro-inflammatory response [14] .",

[16] ). The other species have received less attention. However, a problem with commercial Echinacea extracts in general (and in common with many other herbal products) is their inadequate characterization and standardization. Consequently different commercial sources, derived from different species and plant parts, and with resulting distinctive chemical compositions, may show different combinations of bio-activities, or in some cases relatively little bioactivity [17] . The result of this is that research studies, and especially clinical studies, have yielded inconsistent results. It is also important to ensure that any antiviral activity detected in a herbal preparation is really significant, that is to say, the extract should be able to inactivate a substantial amount of virus at a practical non-cytotoxic dosage, and therefore the assay techniques should reflect this requirement.",

Assays were designed to test virucidal activity or viral growth inhibition, and they also incorporated exposure to light in case photosensitizers were involved (these are often found as bioactive constituents of medicinal plants, ref. 21) . The results are summarized in Table 3 . Many of the extracts showed significant but relatively weak activity, although the hexane root extract of E. purpurea and the ethanol inflorescence extract of E. sanguinea were more substantial. Pure cichoric acid was also moderately active, and could therefore contribute to the activity of certain extracts. Weak or no activity [20] Vimalanathan et al. (Table 3 , ref. [22] ) evaluated different solvent fractions of E. purpurea aerial parts for activity against several viruses, in the presence and absence of light during the reactions. Aqueous extracts were active against herpes simplex virus and influenza virus, but these activities were not dependent on light exposure. In contrast the ethyl acetate fraction of the ethanol extract contained impressive activity against both viruses and which was due to a photosentizer. No activity against rhinovirus was detected. A polysaccharide-enriched fraction was also tested and found to contain only a relatively weak activity. Data are summarized in the form of MICs (minimum inhibitory concentrations) in Table 4 . Similar studies were carried out to compare root extracts from E. purpurea, E. angustifolia and E. pallida (23) . The aqueous fraction of E. purpurea roots, which was almost devoid of caffeic acid derivatives and alkylamides, showed impressive activity against HSV and influenza virus ( Table 4) . The E. angustifolia root extract contained moderate activity against all three viruses (HSV, influenza, and rhinovirus) in the ethyl acetate fraction, but no activity in the aqueous extracts. In contrast, E. pallida root extracts were devoid of antiviral activity.",

In recent tests we found that an ethanol extract of E. angustifolia aerial parts was as active against HSV as a corresponding E. purpurea extract (unpublished observations), thus indicating that there may be similar antiviral compounds in aerial part extracts of all three common Echinacea species (E. purpurea, E. angustifolia, and E. pallida).

[25] ). However only live infectious viruses were able to do this, for infection by equivalent doses of ultraviolet-inactivated viruses failed to elicit the responses. This suggests that the virus may have to enter the cells and undergo some degree of gene expression in order to stimulate the cytokine expression or secretion. It is also interesting that viruses such as adenoviruses, which are not vulnerable to direct attack by Echinacea, but could nevertheless stimulate cytokine secretion, were still susceptible to cytokine reversal. In an attempt to correlate immune modulatory effects with specific classes of Echinacea components, various chemically characterized extracts and fractions, derived from three common species of Echinacea, were evaluated for their possible inhibitory effects on the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8 (CXCL-8) by human bronchial epithelial cells infected with rhinovirus type 14. All of the E. purpurea fractions, comprising aqueous or ethanol extracts of roots, leaves and stems, but to a lesser degree flowers, strongly inhibited the secretion of both cytokines [32] . These results suggest that different compounds, or combinations, were responsible for antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects.",

[33] described changes in levels of expression (in terms of mRNAs and proteins) of several cytokine genes in human blood samples taken at different times after treatment with a commercial blended Echinacea product, and Brovelli et al. [34] found that the expression of several cytokine genes in cultured human monocytes was influenced by the nature of the Echinacea preparation (stage of development and plant part used), presumably a reflection of their different chemical compositions. Altamirano-Dimas et al. [35] analyzed gene expression in human bronchial cells by means of DNA microarrays, following treatment by one of two E. purpurea preparations, a polysaccharide rich aqueous extract and an alkylamide-rich ethanol extract, with or without infection by rhinovirus type 14. Both extracts influenced the expression of many genes, including cytokine genes, although the pattern of expression was different for the two extracts. In addition the virus induced numerous changes, mostly increases in expression, and the extracts tended to decrease (i.e. restore to normal levels) these expression levels. Further analysis of the effects revealed that some of the changes in cytokine expression were interconnected through a specific transcription factor, C/EBPb (CAAT/enhancer-binding protein b). Since Sharma et al. [31] had shown that numerous transcription factors were affected by E. purpurea extract in this same cell-virus system, it is tempting to conclude that many gene expression effects of Echinacea extracts could be due to changes in expression or activation status of multiple transcription factors. This in turn could be brought about by interaction with surface receptors or intracellular modulators.",
