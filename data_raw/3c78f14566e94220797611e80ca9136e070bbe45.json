            "text": "Mutations in PITX2 have been implicated in several genetic disorders, particularly Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome. In order to determine the most reliable bioinformatics tools to assess the likely pathogenicity of PITX2 variants, the results of bioinformatics predictions were compared to the impact of variants on PITX2 structure and function. The MutPred, Provean, and PMUT bioinformatic tools were found to have the highest performance in predicting the pathogenicity effects of all 18 characterized missense variants in PITX2, all with sensitivity and specificity >93%. Applying these three programs to assess the likely pathogenicity of 13 previously uncharacterized PITX2 missense variants predicted 12/13 variants as deleterious, except A30V which was predicted as benign variant for all programs. Molecular modeling of the PITX2 homoedomain predicts that of the 31 known PITX2 variants, L54Q, F58L, V83F, V83L, W86C, W86S, and R91P alter PITX2's structure. In contrast, the remaining 24 variants are not predicted to change PITX2's structure. The results of molecular modeling, performed on all the PITX2 missense mutations located in the homeodomain, were compared with the findings of eight protein stability programs. CUPSAT was found to be the most reliable in predicting the effect of missense mutations on PITX2 stability. Our results showed that for PITX2, and likely other members of this homeodomain transcription factor family, MutPred, Provean, PMUT, molecular modeling, and CUPSAT can reliably be used to predict PITX2 missense variants pathogenicity.",

            "text": "Identifying new disease-associated variants is becoming increasingly important for genetic testing and it is leading to a significant change in the scale and sensitivity of molecular genetic analysis [14] . One of the most frequent approaches for detecting novel variants in target genes is using direct gene sequencing. However, due to increasing number of newly identified missense variants, it is often difficult to interpret the pathogenicity of these variants as not all the mutations alter protein function, and the ones that do may also have different functional impacts in disease [15, 16] . Thus, prior to detailed analyses, novel variants cannot be easily classified as either deleterious or neutral, because of their unknown functional and phenotypic consequences. Therefore, further research should be conducted to validate the genetic diagnosis when a novel missense variant is discovered. Preferably, in vitro characterization of novel variants should be undertaken; however, due to facility limitation, it is often not practicable to experimentally verify the impact of large number of mutations on protein function [17] . Another robust approach to substantiate the pathogenicity is using animal models by generating the homologous mutation that recapitulates the human phenotype; but, similar to in vitro studies, these are time-consuming, labor-intensive, difficult and expensive, making this approach unfeasible to experimentally determine the pathogenicity effects of all novel identified variants [18] . To circumvent the above mentioned limitations and to provide fast and efficient methods for predicting the functional effect of nonsynonymous variants on protein stability, structure, and function, several computational tools have been developed [19] [20] [21] .",

The structural effect of mutational changes can be examined in silico on the basis of three-dimensional structure, multiple alignments of homologous sequences, and molecular dynamics [22] [23] [24] .

DUET calculation is based on complementary data regarding the mutation including secondary structure [67] and a pharmacophore vector [68] . SDM, a computational method, has been demonstrated as the most appropriate method to use along with many other programs. SDM assesses the amino acid substitution occurring at specific structural environment that are tolerated within the family of homologous proteins of defined three dimensional structures and change them into substitution probability tables [69] . mCSM relies on graph-based signature concept and predicts not only the effect of single-point mutations on protein stability, but also protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid binding [70] . I-Mutant3.0 is a neural-network-based web server that predicts automatically protein stability changes upon single point protein mutations based on either protein sequence or protein structure. I-Mutant3.0 can predict the severity effect of a mutation on the stability of the folded protein [71] . MUpro is a set of machine learning programs that accurately calculates protein stability alterations based on primary sequence information particularly where the tertiary structure is unrevealed, overcoming a major restriction of previous methods which are based on the tertiary structure [72] . iPTREE-STAB is a web service and mainly provides two function modules of services including discriminating the stability of a protein upon single amino acid substitutions and predicting their numerical stability values [73] . CUPSAT uses protein environment specific mean force potentials (through solvent accessibility and secondary structure specificity) to analyse and predict protein stability changes upon point mutations [74] . iStable, a combined predictor, was designed by using sequence information and prediction data from various element predictors. iStable is available with two different input types: structural and sequential [75] .

In this context, the current study investigated the combination of experimental findings, molecular modeling, in silico mutation prediction programs, and stability prediction software to assess the pathogenicity of PITX2 missense variants. In silico methods that correctly identify deleterious variants do not always inevitably work well for benign predictions. The methods determined by this study to be preferred for analyses of PITX2 variants were those best able to distinguish both pathogenic and benign variants, thus yielding the highest accuracy. Our results showed that MutPred, Provean, and PMUT tools were the most accurate in predicting pathogenicity of PITX2 missense variants (Fig 2) . The sensitivity and specificity of these three tools in recognizing PITX2 disease-causing variants were over 93%, indicating the strong performance of these programs in identifying as pathogenic only PITX2 variants with significant functional defects. After these three tools, REVEL showed highest sensitivity and specificity, 94.44% and 87.50%, respectively. SIFT showed good sensitivity (72.22%) but low specificity (43.75%). PolyPhen-2, MutationTaster and PANTHER-PSEP, FATHMM, and Align GV-GD demonstrated > 83% sensitivity, but, they were unable to identify the benign polymorphisms, showing the specificity of 37.50%, 6.25%, 43.75%, 6.25%, and 6.25%, respectively. The predictive value of nsSNPAnalayzer was similar to that of SIFT program, with sensitivity and specificity of 66.67% and 43.75%, respectively. Our results showed, therefore, that Computational analysis of PITX2 mutations MutPred, Provean, and PMUT can be utilized with high confidence to test whether or not a PITX2 missense variant is likely to be deleterious. Interestingly, MutPred was the only in silico program that ranked in the top three programs in identifying both pathogenic and benign PITX2 and FOXC1 variants [27] . A likely explanation for MutPred's high ranking is that it evaluates the most factors in making assessments. However, since the number of variants available for testing in this study were small, a larger dataset would confirm that our results are reproducible and generally applicable.",

The stability state of a protein is key factor in its proper functionality. In fact, up to 80% of Mendelian disease-causing mutations in protein coding regions are predicted to be caused by altering protein stability [99] . In recent years, due to the availability of high-throughput array-based genotyping methods [100] and next generation sequencing platforms [101, 102] , a large number of SNPs has been reported. However, the association of missense variants with protein stability has often been difficult to predict.

We thus first used molecular modelling analyses to assess and compared the total energy difference between native and mutated modeled structure of PITX2 proteins. The results predicted that while most PITX2 variants did not dramatically affect the protein tertiary structure, seven variants (L54Q, F58L, V83F, V83L, W86C, W86S, and R91P) altered the total energy level in comparison with the native structure, suggesting that these amino acid substitutions changed the structure of the PITX2 protein. Molecular modeling of the PITX2 homeodomain predicted that these variants impair the required energy to maintain the proper folding of helix 1-3 and cause global destabilization of the structure of PITX2. These seven amino acids are either invariant (e.g., W86) or highly conserved in the approximately 300 homeobox proteins analyzed, consistent with a pivotal role of these residues in the homeodomain [103] [104] [105] . These seven amino acids are tightly packed hydrophobic amino acids responsible for holding helices of the PITX2 homeodomain together, supporting our molecular modeling predicting that mutations of these amino acids disrupt PITX2 structure. For F58L, V83F, and V83L, the native wild-type residues and the introduced mutant residues differ in size, probably causing loss of hydrophobic interactions in the core of the protein, particularly involving helix 1-3. For L54Q, W86C, W86S, and R91P, the wild-type residues and the mutant residues are different in both size and charge, likely disturb the local structure of protein thereby altering protein structure and function. Residues V83, W86, and R91 are located within the third helix which is specifically responsible for binding with the major groove of the DNA [106] . Thus, the prediction that these mutations impair the capacity of this helix to interact with DNA is consistent with this knowledge and with previous functional characterizations that showed reduced DNA-binding capacities of the V83L and R91P mutant PITX2 proteins [5, 107] . Consistent with bioinformatics predictions of deleterious affects of mutation of W86, mutations of the neighboring amino acids (R84W and K88E) have been shown to decrease the ability of the mutant proteins to interact with DNA [39, 108] .",

Molecular modeling of L54Q is consistent with the Computational analysis of PITX2 mutations suggestion that mutations in these highly-conserved residues in helix 1 of the homeodomain might disturb the DNA-protein binding affinity. Our prediction is supported by the fact that changing the leucine to a glutamine (L54Q) disrupts DNA-protein complex, indicating the necessity of leucine at position 54 for PITX2 binding ability [109] . Thus, consistent with our recent studies on FOXC1 protein [110] , the results of molecular modeling of PITX2 are strongly consistent with the functional characterization of PITX2 missense variants. The results from our molecular modeling analysis were also compared to the predictions of eight stability predictor methods (DUET, SDM, mCSM, I-mutant3.0, MUpro, iPTREE-STAB, CUPSAT, and iStable). Based on our analyses, it appears that CUPSAT performs the best of the seven methods evaluated here in predicting the effect of missense mutations on PITX2 protein stability, with SDM, DUET, mCSM, and I-Mutant3.0, performing weaker, consistent with the results of previous studies [111, 112] .

Our results showed that MutPred, Provean, PMUT, molecular modeling, and CUPSAT are reliable methods to assess PITX family missense variants in the absence of laboratory experiments. However, for our analyses, it must be noted that we used sixteen SNPs as non-pathogenetic control variants to investigate the performance of prediction programs. Although we considered SNPs with a population frequency of >0.05% as benign, we cannot formally exclude that these SNPs might have un-documented pathogenic effects on PITX2. In addition, while the prediction methods used in this study are not gene-specific, generalization of the performance of these programs to other human genes may be inappropriate without additional study. When assessing the pathogenicity of missense variants, it is necessary to be cautious on depending merely on in silico programs without wetlab experiments. According to standards and guidelines for the interpretation of sequence variants: a joint consensus recommendation of the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) and the Association for Molecular Pathology, in silico predictions only serve as one supporting factor, whereas functional tests are frequently needed to assess the pathogenicity of missense variants. In particular, as per clinical guidelines for the interpretation of single substitution variants, the output of computational tools should be interpreted in the light of functional studies results, population frequency data and segregation in affected families.
