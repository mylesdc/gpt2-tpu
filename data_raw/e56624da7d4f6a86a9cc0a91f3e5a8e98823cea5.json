As a model system for viral entry and anti-retroviral approaches, avian sarcoma/leukosis virus (ASLV, including the A-J ten subgroups) has been studied intensively and many milestone discoveries have been achieved based on work with ASLV. Here, we used a DF1 cell line expressed viral receptor-binding protein to efficiently identify chicken Annexin A2 (chANXA2) as a novel receptor for retrovirus ALV-J (avian leukosis virus subgroup J). Our data demonstrate that antibodies or siRNA to chANXA2 significantly inhibited ALV-J infection and replication, and over-expression of chANXA2 permitted the entry of ALV-J into its non-permissible cells. Our findings have not only identified chANXA2 as a novel biomarker for anti-ALV-J, but also demonstrated that cell lines with the expression of viral receptor-binding protein could be as efficient tools for isolating functional receptors to identify novel anti-viral targets.",

Thus, viral cell receptors not only determine the viral tropism, but also provide host targets for antiviral strategies. For example, the multiple identified cell receptors and co-receptors for HIV (e.g., CD4, CCR5, and CXCR4) are clarifying the molecular details of HIV entry and creating efficient approaches for AIDS interventions [4] [5] [6] [7] . And the sialic acid analogues that mimic the influenza virus receptors have been shown clinical effects against influenza infection 8 . The receptor for SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, has also been reported as a potential therapeutic target for SARS-CoV 9,10 . As a model system for viral entry, avian sarcoma/leukosis virus (ASLV, including A-J ten subgroups) has been studied intensively, and several important receptors for ASLV entry have been identified by traditional methods [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . Because saturation of the viral cell receptors of susceptible cells via the expression of viral receptorbinding protein can block the corresponding viral infection [16] [17] [18] , such virus-resistant cells might be efficient tools for the isolation of the functional receptors for viral entry and novel anti-viral biomarkers. To test this possibility, we used an ALV-J-resistant cell line (pcDNA-env_DF1) that expresses ALV-J Env in the ALV-J-susceptible cell line DF1 as a tool for isolating novel receptors for ALV-J. Through this approach, we identified chicken Annexin A2 (chANXA2) as a novel ALV-J receptor.",

Silver staining for SDS-PAGE of the immunoprecipitation revealed several different bands in the lysate that was immunoprecipitated with ALV-J-specific mAb JE-9 and not with the control antibody (Fig. 1A) .

To test whether chANXA2 serves as a functional receptor for ALV-J infection, we used antibodies against chANXA2 to perform blocking assays to evaluate the effects of chANXA2 on ALV-J infection in DF1 cells. Our results revealed that the viral infection/replication of ALV-J was significantly inhibited in groups that had been treated with anti-ANXA2. As shown in Fig. 2A , there was little visible immunofluorescence in the cells that were treated with 50 or 25 mg/ml of the antibody against chANXA2 in the IFA. Moreover, only a few positive cells were found among the cells that were treated with 5 mg/ml of antibody against ANXA2. In contrast, many positive cells were found among the cells that were treated with the control IgG and among the untreated cells. Consistent with the IFA results, the viral titres of the cells that were treated with 50 and 25 mg/ml of antibody against chANXA2 were approximately 50-fold and 10-fold less, respectively, than those of the cells that were treated with the control IgG (Fig. 2B) . The inhibitory effect on ALV-J infection/ replication conferred by the antibody against ANXA2 was also confirmed by western blot (Fig. 2C) . As a viral control, we also performed a blocking assay for ALV-A infection in the DF1 cells. As described in Fig. 2D , the p27 expression levels of ALV-A in the groups that were treated with the antibody against chANXA2 were similar to those of the mock group, which indicates that the antibody against ANXA2 could not inhibit ALV-A infection/replication in DF1 cells. These data clearly demonstrate that blocking chANXA2 with a specific antibody can effectively and specially inhibit the infection/replication of ALV-J.",

To extend our finding and investigate whether the over-expression of the chANXA2 protein in ALV-J non-permissible cells could induce susceptibility to ALV-J infection, the replication of ALV-J in the 293T cells transfected with chANXA2 was analysed by IFA and real-time PCR. Real-time PCR revealed that the relative expression of the ALV-J envelope gene was increased in the chANXA2-transfected 293T cells at 72 h postinfection (Fig. 4A ). However, the 293T cells that were transfected with chANXA2 exhibited no visible specific fluorescence with the JE9 antibody to ALV-J Env. These data indicate that ALV-J could enter the 293T cells that were over-expressing chANXA2, but the viral replication of the ALV-J was restricted in the transfected 293T cells. To further confirm this finding, we also transfected chANXA2 into goose embryo fibroblast (GEF) cells in which the ALV-J could not grow. After 48 h, the transfected GEFs were infected with ALV-J. The GEF cells were maintained in DMEM medium for 2 days. Next, the mixture of GEF cells and supernatants were inoculated into fresh DF1 cells. Interestingly, as shown in Fig. 4B , virus was recovered from the GEF cells transfected with chANXA2, but no virus was obtained from the GEF cells that were transfected with the control plasmid. Together, these data demonstrate that the over-expression of chANXA2 in 293T or GEF cells can support ALV-J entry into these ALV-J non-permissible cells.",

The traditional methods for identifying viral receptors mainly depend on the expression and purification of the viral binding proteins [11] [12] [13] [14] . In this study, we reported the first isolation and identification of chANXA2 as a novel functional receptor for ALV-J entry by using an ALV-J-resistant cell line without the procedure of viral protein purification. And the isolation of chANXA2 as ALV-J Env binding protein was further confirmed in this study by using fusion protein SUJ-rIgGFc, which had used in the traditional method for ALV receptor isolation. And the interaction between ALV-J Env and chANXA2 was confirmed using Co-IP. Our findings highlight that virus-resistant cell lines that are constructed through the expression of viral receptor-binding protein in susceptible cells can be widely used as an efficient tool for the isolation of functional receptors for viral entry and novel anti-viral targets.",

To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of the inhibition of ALV-J infection by antibodies against one of the host's protein, which highlights the fact that chANXA2 can serve as a novel functional receptor for ALV-J entry and provide a host marker for anti-ALV-J strategies. In 2006, chNHE1 was identified by Ning et al as a receptor for ALV-J infection 14 , and Kucerova et al also recently demonstrated that a single amino-acid substitution of W38 in chNHE1 abrogates ALV-J infection 21 . However, no data have yet shown that antibodies to chNHE1 can block or inhibit ALV-J infection so far. In present study, we did not rule out the fact that chNHE1 is a receptor for ALV-J infection, but we did identify chANXA2 as a novel receptor for ALV-J infection. However, the potential interaction between chNHE1 and chANXA2 need to be investigated. Either chNHE1 requires chANXA2 or chANXA2 requires chNHE1 when they as ALV-J receptors need to be further tested. The over-expression of chANXA2 could permit the entry of ALV-J into ALV-J non-permissible cells further supports the conclusion of chANXA2 as a novel functional receptor for ALV-J infection.",

It has been reported that ANXA2 can link HCMV to a phospholipid membrane and enhance virus-membrane fusion and is a receptor for respiratory syncytial virus 25, 26 . More recently, ANXA2 was also reported to play critical roles in the viral entry/replication of human papillomavirus type 16, enterovirus 71 and hepatitis C virus [27] [28] [29] [30] . Furthermore, ANXA2 plays a cell typedependent role in regulating HIV infectivity 29 . These previous reports regarding ANXA2 indicate that, because ALV-J Env binding protein was isolated using an ALV-J resistant cell line in the present study, ANXA2 might also play vital roles in ALV-J infection. The roles of ANXA2 as viral receptor or in viral infectivity reported may relate with its endo-and exocytotic pathways. However, the mechanism of these novel functions of ANXA2 need to be further eluci- dated. Further studies will also shed light on the roles of chANXA2 in myelomas and haemangiomas induced by ALV-J infection 31 .",
