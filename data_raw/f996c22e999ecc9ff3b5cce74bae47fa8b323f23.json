We previously reported that co-ligation of leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor-B1 (LILRB1) by antibody-opsonized DENV led to recruitment of SH2 domain-containing phosphatase-1 (SHP-1) to dephosphorylate spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) and reduce interferon stimulated gene induction. Here, we show that LILRB1 also signals through SHP-1 to attenuate the otherwise rapid acidification for lysosomal enzyme activation following Fc\u03b3R-mediated uptake of DENV. Reduced or slower trafficking of antibody-opsonized DENV to lytic phagolysosomal compartments, demonstrates how co-ligation of LILRB1 also permits DENV to overcome a cellautonomous immune response, enhancing intracellular survival of DENV. Our findings provide insights on how antiviral drugs that modify phagosome acidification should be used for viruses such as DENV.",

The risk of severe disease is augmented when dengue virus (DENV) is opsonized with non-or sub-neutralizing levels of antibodies that ligate Fc-gamma receptors (Fc\u03b3 Rs) for enhanced entry and replication in monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells. This phenomenon, termed antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), engenders the elevated viraemia and vascular leakage that is characteristic of severe dengue.

Activated Syk controls a number of pathways, including actin remodelling necessary for phagocytosis 5 and STAT-1-dependent interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) induction independent of interferon receptor signaling 4 . Induction of ISGs would create an intracellular environment unfavorable for enhanced DENV replication.

While both subclones supported similar levels of DENV uptake and infection under DENV only conditions, infection under ADE conditions led to significantly higher DENV-2 titres in THP-1.2S compared to THP-1.2R. The difference in susceptibility to ADE was due to higher levels of LILRB1 expression on THP-1.2S. Antibody-opsonized DENV co-ligated LILRB1 to down-regulate activating Fc\u03b3 R-mediated signaling, reducing induction of ISGs for enhanced DENV replication in THP-1.2S 6 .

Importantly, the peak in viral RNA recovery using both methods of isolation corresponded to fractions of similar density, reinforcing the reproducibility of this assay (Fig. 1B) .

The modal size of DiD-particles was 2 to 3 fold larger than modal size of nanoparticles detected under light scatter mode (Fig. 1C, Supplementary Fig. S1 ). Importantly, the majority of DiD-particles were detected in fraction 3 in both DENV only and ADE infection (Fig. 1C) , consistent with the bulk of viral RNA being recovered from fraction 3 (Fig. 1A) . The modal size of 274 nm and 246 nm for DiD-particles isolated following DENV only and ADE infection, respectively, also suggests the possibility that DENV is contained within endosomal vesicles (Fig. 1C ).",

This suggests that at 2 hours post-infection, DENV is compartmentalized in late endosomes or lysosomes following uptake into the host cell. The enrichment of endosomal markers in isolated fractions relative to whole cell lysate is further validation that purification of DENV endocytic vesicles can be performed on a step sucrose gradient ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ).

To test if Syk activity affects DENV phagosome acidification, a hallmark of phagosome maturation, we labeled DENV with both pH-sensitive pHrodo dye, and pH-insensitive Alexa Fluor 488 (AF488) dye to track intracellular DENV. Since acidification of the subcellular environment increases fluorescence intensity of pHrodo but not AF488, the ratio of fluorescence intensity between pHrodo and AF488 served as a semi-quantitative measure of phagosome acidification. This approach was previously used to assess phagosome acidification during infection with bacteria that was simultaneously labelled with pHrodo and a pH-insensitive fluorescent probe 19, 20 . Only batches of DENV that showed at least 70% of co-labelling with pHrodo and AF488 ( Supplementary Fig. S2 ) were used for subsequent experiments. To test if pHrodo/AF488-labeled DENV would be sensitive to changes in phagosome acidification, we infected Vero cells pre-treated with different concentrations of chloroquine (CQ). As pH of intracellular compartments increased with concentration of CQ used, fluorescence intensity of pHrodo decreased and we observed reduced overlap of pHrodo and E protein ( Supplementary Fig. S2 ). This indicates that pHrodo/AF488-labeled DENV is sensitive to changes in pH and can be used to examine semi-quantitatively differences in phagosome acidification.",

That DENV is destined for phagolysosomal degradation following Fc\u03b3 R-mediated uptake during ADE, is consistent with previous findings that phagosomes containing antibody-opsonized beads matured faster into phagolysosomes, compared to uncoated beads 24 . Furthermore, both Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and Helicobacter pylori opsonized with IgG resulted in more rapid phagosome maturation and were more efficiently destroyed than non-opsonized bacterial particles 25, 26 . The findings of our study add to this body of knowledge. During ADE, antibody-opsonized DENV co-ligates the ITIM-bearing LILRB1, which signals through SHP-1 to dephosphorylate Syk. Reduced Syk signaling not only results in suppressed ISG induction 6 , it also downregulates phagosome acidification, permitting DENV to escape lysosomal degradation. SHP-1 is thought to inhibit phagosome acidification by acting on membrane fusion during phagosome trafficking 19 . Defects in phagosome acidification have also been observed in SHP-1 deficient mouse macrophages 27 . Our findings thus agree with recent studies that have demonstrated increased viral fusion during ADE, which leads to enhanced production of infectious DENV titres 28 .",

Although CQ and NH 4 Cl treatment-related increase in viral RNA replication is more abundantly secreted as immature DENVs, these could nonetheless be detrimental in patients experiencing secondary dengue infections, which formed the majority of the trial subjects 32 . Prior DENV infection in such patients would likely have produced abundant cross-reactive anti-prM antibodies 22 , which would bind immature DENV particles to enable entry into Fc\u03b3 R-bearing cells where subsequent furin activity renders them infectious 23 .",

(E) Western blot showing higher levels of active CatD (34 kDa) in fraction 3 of THP-1.2R compared to THP-1.2S, in cells that were infected under DENV only or ADE conditions, or uninfected control cells.
