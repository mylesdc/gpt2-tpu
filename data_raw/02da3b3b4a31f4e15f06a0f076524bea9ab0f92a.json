The anti-HCV activity of the flavonoid quercetin (2) could partly be attributed to it being a structural mimic of DKAs. In order to delineate the structural features required for the inhibitory effect and improve the anti-HCV potency, two novel types of quercetin analogues, 7-O-arylmethylquercetins and quercetin-3-O-benzoic acid esters, were designed, synthesized and evaluated for their anti-HCV properties in cell-based assays. Among the 38 newly synthesized compounds, 7-O-substituted derivative 3i and 3-O-substituted derivative 4f were found to be the most active in the corresponding series (EC50 = 3.8 \u03bcM and 9.0 \u03bc\u039c, respectively). Docking studies suggested that the quercetin analogues are capable of establishing key coordination with the two magnesium ions as well as interactions with residues at the active site of HCV NS5B.",

A protective vaccine is not yet available and the previous standard of care (SOC) , which is pegylated-interferon, combined with ribavirin, is often difficult to tolerate and results in a sustained viral response (SVR) in only 50% of patients infected with the predominant genotype 1 [2, 3] . Recent advances in the development of direct acting antivirals (DAAs) have significantly improved SVR in patients, providing a new hope for cure in infected patients. Three NS3/4A protease inhibitors were approved by FDA for the treatment of genotype 1 hepatitis C, and in late 2013, sofosbuvir, a first-in-class NS5B polymerase inhibitor, was launched and became a cornerstone of recommended HCV therapy against almost all HCV genotypes [4] [5] [6] [7] . However, due to the potential of drug resistant strains [8] and the high price of the new HCV drugs [9] , the development of novel anti-HCV agents is still an urgent necessity.",

            "text": "Quercetin (2, Figure 2 ) is a naturally occurring flavonoid with various biological activities such as antioxidant, antiviral, anticancer, antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties; hence, quercetin and its derivatives have potential as drug development leads [15] . As a part of our studies on anti-HCV agents, quercetin was identified as an HCV inhibitor with moderate antiviral activity (EC50 = 19.8 \u03bcM) [16] . Furthermore, it had been reported that quercetin could inhibit HCV RdRp at low micromolar concentration (83.7% inhibition at the concentration of 20 \u03bcM in an enzyme assay) [17] . We reasoned that the adjacent carbonyl and hydroxyl groups on A and C rings of quercetin make it a perfect DKAs mimic to chelate the two metal ions. In consideration of the structures of 1a and 1b (Figure 1 ), introduction of a 2-cyano benzyl ether group at the aromatic meta-position relative to the chelating moieties was shown to significantly improve the antiviral activity. Thus, we anticipated that substituents of quercetin at the 7-O position (7-O-arylmethyl quercetins 3, Figure 2 ) would mimic the meta-substituted DKA 1b and enhance the anti-HCV activities. Herein, we report the design and synthesis of novel 7-O-arylmethyl quercetin derivatives with various aromatic substituents and the evaluation of their anti-HCV activities. Moreover, it can be hypothesized that another introduced carbonyl group at 3-position of quercetin, together with the adjacent carbonyl and hydroxyl group, would be capable of chelating the two metal ions. Hence, this paper also described a series of novel quercetin-3-O-benzoic acid esters (compounds 4, Figure 2 ) in an attempt to investigate whether the introduction of another carbonyl group at 3-position would result in an improved anti-HCV activity. In addition, several quercetin derivatives with different aliphatic groups substituted at the 3-position were also synthesized for further SAR investigations. ",

            "text": "The inhibition of HCV by all synthesized quercetin derivatives was evaluated following a previously reported procedure [16] . All newly synthesized compounds were tested in authentic HCV infection/replication system in the human hepatoma cell lines Huh7.5.1 using mycophenolic acid [21] (MPA) as control compound. The cytotoxicity effect of the test compounds was also evaluated in the same cell line by MTT method. Antiviral effect and cytotoxicity effect were summarized as EC50 and CC50 respectively, as well as the selective index (SI) which is the ratio of CC50 to EC50. The stability of quercetin-3-O-ester compounds were also tested in the same buffer as the antiviral activity assay at 37 \u00b0C and the hydrolysate was measured by HPLC. Only trace quercetin as hydrolyzate was monitored over 72 h which demonstrated that quercetin-3-O-ester derivatives were stable under the biological evaluation conditions. As clearly shown in Table 1 , all 7-O-substituted quercetin derivatives 3a-3s exhibited potent anti-HCV activities with EC50 values ranging from 3.8 \u03bcM to 8.7 \u03bcM. Among these compounds, 3''-Cl substituted derivatives possessed the highest activities (for 3i, EC50 = 3.8 \u03bcM) and a decent selectivity ratio (for 3i, SI = 7.2). These results tend to indicate the importance of introducing an aromatic group at 7-O position. Substituents of quercetin at the 7-O position may mimic the meta-substituents of DKA 1b and thus enhance the anti-HCV activities. It should be noted that all the 7-O-substituted analogues evaluated in this study were found in a narrow range of inhibition activity. This high level of tolerance will be discussed in the following section. To examine the effects of the additional carbonyl group at the 3-position, 3-O-substituted quercetin derivatives were designed by adding substituted aroyl groups. All the substituted benzoic acid esters 4a-4o exhibited similar or better anti-HCV activities in cell-based assays as compared to the lead compound quercetin (Table 2) . Among these compounds, 3''-F substituted derivative (4f) showed more than a two-fold increase in potency over quercetin (EC50 of 9.0 \u03bcM for 4f versus 19.7 \u03bcM for 2). In order to study the significance of the coordination between the additional carbonyl group and the magnesium ions, we synthesized several compounds 12a-12d in which the carbonyl group at 3-O position was replaced by aliphatic groups of various lengths. It is not surprising that a decrease in potency was observed for these analogues, mainly because the aliphatic substituents at the 3-position, especially when they are bulky, could not coordinate to the magnesium ions. The maintenance of anti-HCV activities for quercetin-3-O-benzoic acid-ester derivatives instead of the 3-O-aliphatic substituents revealed that the introduction of an electronegative carbonyl group at 3-O position could enhance the chelation ability between the inhibitor and metal ions, which contribute to the binding affinity in a similar way as the 3-hydroxyl group.",

Initially, the lead compound quercetin 2 was docked into NS5B active site after the removal of the original UTP. As depicted in Figure 3a , 3-, 4-, and 5-O derivatives of quercetin chelate to the two magnesium ions (2.1 \u00c5-2.7 \u00c5) together with four conserved key residues (Asp 220, Thr221, Asp318, Asp319) and two water molecules in the active site to form a double-octahedral center. The three acidic residues (Asp220, Asp318, Asp319) were found to be indispensable to the polymerase-catalyzed nucleotidyl transfer reaction [22] . The 3'-hydroxyl in B ring of quercetin forms a hydrogen bond (1.6 \u00c5) with the side chain of Asp225, the same residue that is hydrogen bonded to the 2'-hydroxyl group of UTP. This binding mode is in accordance with our previous results [16] that kaempferol (lacking a 3'-hydroxyl as compared to quercetin, 51.9% inhibition at 50 \u03bcM) and isorhamnetin (with 3'-hydroxy methylated, 47.3% inhibition at 50 \u03bcM) are less potent against HCV than quercetin (EC50 = 19.8 \u03bcM).

However, due to the relatively large size of the hydrophobic pocket around Phe193, modification of 7-O phenyl group did not give a noticeable gain of activity. As to the 3-O-substituted analogue 4f, the carbonyl group at 3-position interacts with one magnesium ion with a distance of 2.6 \u00c5, the same distance as that in quercetin-NS5B system (Figure 3a,c) .

Following our recent report which evidenced the anti-HCV potential of the DKAs mimic quercetin (2), efforts were continued in order to delineate the structural features required for the inhibitory effect and improve the anti-HCV potency. Accordingly, two novel quercetin analogues, 7-O-arylmethylquercetin derivatives and quercetin-3-O-benzoic acid ester derivatives, were synthesized and evaluated for anti-HCV activities. Experimental and modeling results highlighted the importance of introducing an aromatic group at 7-O position, which is exemplified by compound 3i, where a 3-chlorobenzyl substitution at quercetin 7-O position confers low micromolar inhibitory activity (EC50 = 3.8 \u03bcM) and a decent selectivity ratio (SI = 7.2). Moreover, the electronegative carbonyl groups at quercetin 3-O position may maintain the coordination with the magnesium ions and more importantly, introduce other interactions with the surrounding residues and thus enhance the anti-HCV activities, which is manifested by compound 4f (EC50 = 9.0 \u03bcM and SI > 5.6). Docking studies suggested that the quercetin structures are capable of establishing key coordination with the two magnesium ions as well as interactions with residues at the active site of HCV RdRp. These results demonstrated the feasibility and potential of modifications on quercetin scaffold and provided a promising fundamental to optimize the structures of flavonoids to obtain potent anti-HCV agents.",
