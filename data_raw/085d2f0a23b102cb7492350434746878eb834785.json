Others have found a higher phage abundance in a patient with severe COPD when compared with one patients with moderate COPD and healthy controls, DNA sequencing, in line with the hypothesis of a state of dysbiosis that increases with disease progression [27] . In COPD patients, viral infections have been suggested to trigger bacterial overgrowth and infections [42, 43] , demonstrating the significance of viral-bacterial interactions.

This study demonstrates good performance of our mNGS protocol, in line with other studies [37, 38, 47, 48] and seems to overcome some of the current thresholds for implementation in clinical diagnostics.",
