We assessed the risk factors associated with severity in confirmed cases and fatality in severe cases by multivariate analysis. One hundred and three (89.6%) of 115 patients presented with multiple organ dysfunction, and 22 (19.1%) of 115 proceeded to the stage of life threatening multiple organ failure. Of the 115 patients, 14 fatalities (12.2%) were reported. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the independent predictors of risk for severity were: albumin \u226430 g/l (OR, 8.09; 95% CI, 2.58-25.32), APTT \u2265 66 seconds (OR, 14.28; 95% CI, 3.28-62.24), sodium \u2264130 mmol/l (OR, 5.44; 95% CI, 1.38-21.40), and presence of neurological manifestations (OR, 7.70; 95% CI, 1.91-31.12).

The disease was first identified as the severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) in Central and Northeast China in 2008 [2] . SFTS has an average 12% case fatality rate and even 30% in some areas. Reports that have referred to clinical symptoms of SFTSV infection are either case reports or brief reports, and the detailed clinical features of cases with SFTS virus (SFTSV) infection have not been well described. Several studies have described the factors associated with death in SFTSV patients. However, previously published works assessed risk factors for death by univariate analysis, and the risk factors for severity among SFTS patients and fatality among severe SFTS patients remain to be determined.",

Among the 105 SFTS patients who had IgM and IgG tested, the median interval between onset and positive result in the initial SFTSV IgM test was 8.0 days (range, 4-14 days). A total of 32 SFTS patients had a positive result for IgG antibody in the acute phase sera, and the median interval between onset and positive result was 12.0 days (range, 8-14 days).",

The laboratory findings for patients at hospital admission are shown in Table 4 (see Appendix S1 for normal values obtained from laboratory tests in adults). Differences in laboratory characteristics during the course of illness between severe and non-severe cases of SFTSV infection in confirmed cases and between fatal and non-fatal cases of SFTSV infection in severe cases are shown in Table 5 and 6, respectively. Thrombocytopenia (thrombocyte count, <150,000/mm 3 ) was the most common abnormality, and 52 (45.2%) of 115 cases were severe (thrombocyte count, <50,000/mm 3 ). Leukopenia (leukocyte count, <4,000/mm 3 ) was observed in 73 (63.5%) of 115 patients, including 8 (7.0%) of 115 patients with decreased absolute neutrophil count (granulocyte count, <500/mm 3 ) and 88 (76.5%) of 115 patients with lymphopenia (lymphocyte count, <1,500/mm 3 ). Patients with leukopenia at admission all presented with varying degrees of thrombocytopenia. Thrombocytopenia was seen in 108 (93.9%) patients during the illness course. Additional laboratory tests were performed between days 1 and 5 of hospitalization for 34 hospitalized patients with a normal or elevated leukocyte count, and 21 (61.8%) of 34 patients were shown to have leukopenia. In the present study, a total of 94 (81.7%) of 115 patients showed leukopenia during the illness course. Among 6 patients who underwent bone marrow aspiration, 2 patients were diagnosed with aplastic anemia, 2 patients with decreased proliferation and the remaining 2 patients with reactive hyperplasia.

Most of these cases were living in hill areas, and ticks were commonly found in most patients' home and work environments [22] . It has been confirmed that SFTSV can be transmitted to humans by tick bites, contact with blood from SFTS patients, and personal contact [23, 24] . In endemic areas, SFTS occurs most frequently in the summer and autumn seasons, which are suitable for tick activity and consistent with the increasing outdoor activities that increase the risk for exposure to ticks [25] . To date, the true incubation period of the virus has not been established definitively. It has been reported that the incubation period for transmission through tick bite in most SFTS patients ranges from 5 days to 2 weeks [23] . In the present study, the median incubation period for transmission through tick bite in the 7 patients who had a definite history of tick bite was 5 days. However, the delay between the tick bite and the onset of symptoms in 3 of these 7 patients ranged from 2 to 3 weeks, which suggests that the incubation for transmission through tick bite of SFTSV infection may be longer. There were no family cluster or person-to-person transmission of infections by SFTSV reported in this study, so we know little about the incubation of SFTSV infection through person-to-person transmission.",

The elevated markers of liver damage, such as ALT, AST and LDH were observed in majority of the 115 patients, with AST levels typically higher than ALT levels, and were especially pronounced among patients with severe disease. We found that markers of liver damage, such as ALT and AST, were associated with poor prognosis, which is similar to Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) [27, 28] . In this study, AST levels were disproportionately higher than ALT levels in SFTS patients, which were dramatically higher (2-6.2 times higher) in fatal than in non-fatal cases. Some of patients with elevated markers of liver damage had complications, such as pancreatitis, renal insufficiency, rhabdomyolysis [18] , sepsis and shock. This suggests that elevated AST/ALT ratio is not only associated with liver damage, but also with damage to other tissues, such as muscle, kidney, and pancreas, which could be a direct result of virus infection (and injury) and/or an indirect consequence of cell necrosis [29] .",

Due to not all patients with disturbance of consciousness having had a CSF count performed and repeat CSF examination was not performed for patients with negative results on CSF examination, encephalitis was probably underestimated. Evidence of encephalitis was not found in 19 (82.6%) of 23 patients with CNS manifestation, so these cases may have been due to toxic-metabolic encephalopathy, but further workup would be necessary to completely rule out encephalitis. Abnormal findings of MRI images in the 4 patients with encephalitis were consistent with acute inflammation, and CSF features were also more consistent with acute viral encephalitis. Marked elevation of CK level was observed in patients with limb tremor. The only patient with acute kidney failure and limb tremor was associated with rhabdomyolysis. The significant difference in CK level in patients with and without limb tremor suggests that muscle injury associated with SFTSV infection may also play a role in limb tremor, as well as central or peripheral neurologic involvement, renal or hepatic involvement.",

SFTSV also has played a direct role in these fatalities [19, 31] . However, these results were assessed by univariate analysis. To the best of our knowledge, no study has reported the risk factors associated with severity in SFTS patients. With a multivariate logistic regression model to control confounding and estimate the direct effects of several possible causal risk factors, we found that hypoalbuminemia, prolonged APTT, hyponatremia, and presence of neurological manifestations were significantly associated with severity in SFTS patients. Among patients with severe SFTS, high serum AST levels, pronounced coagulation disturbances, similar to the previous study, were also associated with fatality, but Cox proportional hazards model showed that the presence of ALI/ARDS and DIC were independent predictors of fatality among patients with severe SFTS.",

Patients with severe disease also had lower platelet counts than those with non-severe disease in the confirmed cases (p<0.001). DIC score was ascertained among patients with severe disease, 15 of which were diagnosed with DIC. DIC has previously been shown to be more prominent in patients with fatal CCHF [32] . DIC was also an independent prognostic factor among patients with severe SFTS. The coagulation disturbances may be secondary to endothelial damage, DIC, or decreased production of coagulation factors due to acute hepatic damage, which is similar to other viral hemorrhagic fevers such as CCHF [3] . Nearly one third of patients had renal function impairment, most of which was mild. Electrolyte abnormalities were commonly observed. Hyponatremia is considered the most prominent change in serum electrolytes in Hantavirus infection, but is rarely serious [33, 34] . Acute or symptomatic hyponatremia can lead to significant rates of morbidity and mortality [35, 36] . We found that moderate hyponatremia was an independent risk factor for severity in SFTS patients. It has been reported that extremely low (<0.8 mmol/l) concentration of calcium ions is an independent predictor of mortality in critical illness [37] . Hypocalcemia was more serious in fatal than nonfatal cases. In this study, the corrected total serum calcium, not ionized calcium, was investigated. Total serum calcium levels are not reliable, therefore, we can't assess the association between prognosis and serum calcium. Seven of 11 patients with changes in consciousness had a normal CSF cell count, which suggested other causes, such as electrolyte or other metabolic disturbance may be associated with neurological manifestations.",

Due to the retrospective nature of our study, the efficacy of ribavirin in the treatment of SFTS is not clear. Adverse effect associated with ribavirin was also observed. Corticosteroids increase the risk of developing critical disease from viral infections. The use of corticosteroids for the treatment is controversial in SFTS patients with ALI/ARDS. Host immune responses play an important role in determining the severity and clinical outcome in patients with infection by SFTSV [3, 30] . Corticosteroids can suppress the cytokine storm. We hoped that the progression of pulmonary disease would be stopped by corticosteroids, which was proved in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome [39] . There was no control group, so we can't determine whether SFTS patients with ALI/ARDS can benefit for administration with corticosteroids.

There are no pathognomonic cluster of signs and symptoms that indicate SFTSV infection, but surely after reviewing the manifestations of these patients, a more helpful conclusion about the possible manifestations of SFTSV infection in hospitalized patients can be achieved. This would be a useful contribution for clinicians who might suspect, test, report SFTSV infection and assess SFTSV infection in future cases. In the clinical assessment of any case of SFTS, findings relating to prognosis, including hypoalbuminemia, prolonged APTT, hyponatremia and presence of neurological manifestations, DIC and ALI/ARDS, need to be taken into account by clinicians.

Prominent flushing of the head, neck, and upper chest was rarely observed in patients with SFTSV infection, which is different from hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome. Hemorrhagic signs are observed in SFTS patients. Most patients with hemorrhagic signs showed microscopic hematuria, fecal occult blood, occult blood in their vomitus and petechiae. Severe hemorrhagic signs, such as gastrointestinal bleeding, macroscopic hematuria and hematoma, are commonly observed in patients with DIC and aplastic anemia due to SFTSV infection, which was responsible for 3 deaths in the present study.Factors related to death from SFTSV infection have previously been assessed in only a few studies[2,3,19]. Zhang et al. reported that the fatal outcome was associated with age, high serum AST levels, pronounced coagulation disturbances, and high levels of acute phase proteins among 49 cases of SFTS[3]. Xu et al. have found that elderly patients and those with underlying diseases, neurological manifestations, coagulopathy, or hyponatremia tend to have a poor outcome",
