Similarly, it is widely agreed that risks to participants must be minimized and proportionate to any potential clinical benefits for them and/or the social value of the research [4] . Yet, the Zika challenge studies reveal unresolved questions about upper-risk limits in research with competent consenting adults, and the value of research that could justify exposing them to significant risks [5] . The answer to these questions will shape the conduct of clinical research in future disease outbreaks and requires global ethical debate.

Moreover, there has been a clear push to share not just research but data. This revolution is occurring on all levels, from digitizing primary field or clinical data, to sharing genomic sequence or experimental data, to developing standards for compiling and disseminating epidemiological data from local health departments up to the World Health Organization.

In June 2016, the US Food and Drug Administration approved sofosbuvir/velpatasvir as the first oral, single-tablet, pan-genotypic cure, based on the findings of ASTRAL-1 through -4 that were, in part, carried out in Hong Kong [7] . However, to reach the utilitarian ideal of \"the greatest good for the greatest number,\" there would need to be a third breakthrough in action research on access to medicines. Overcoming the heterogeneity of country health systems and associated hurdles to ensuring that such cures reach the 55 million East Asian chronic hepatitis C carriers will be as challenging as handling the highly heterogeneous viral genotypes, subtypes, and quasispecies during drug development.",

Although influenza vaccines are updated to keep abreast of this rapidly mutating virus, the virus continues to be unpredictable with newly circulating strains evading strain specificity, leading to vaccine failure. An international team led by Yoshi Kawaoka at the Universities of Tokyo and Wisconsin [8] reported a strategy that may potentially allow us to keep one step ahead of the virus. Using random mutagenesis of the viral hemagglutinin together with human immune sera to mimic in vitro the immune selection pressure that occurs in nature, they were able to anticipate which way the virus was likely to evolve, thereby assisting seasonal vaccine strain selection. Separately, Poon and colleagues examined within-host virus genetic diversity when influenza is transmitted in Hong Kong households and demonstrated that multiple virus strains are cotransmitted in the community [9] . The future antigenic drift variants were found to cocirculate as a minor virus population years before they finally emerge as an epidemic strain. Thus, the vaccine virus candidate of tomorrow is hiding as a minor variant within the influenza strains circulating today; and we now have the means to look for them.",

While there has long been a safe and highly effective live-attenuated vaccine against yellow fever, the global emergency stockpile had already been depleted twice by the Angola outbreak since December 2015. The epidemic has by now spread to neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo and elsewhere.

            "text": "Diversity promotes innovation. We know from scientific studies that heterogeneous teams outperform homogeneous ones [11] . Moreover, with diverse, complex health challenges facing us, we need all minds at the table. At the National Institutes of Health (NIH), I am leading efforts to embrace diversity as an opportunity, rather than a problem. I see four diversity challenges that we as a biomedical society need to meet in order to reach our research goals and to improve health for the rich tapestry of people and cultures that is modern America. First, we must look at workforce diversity using a scientific lens-and second, we must insist that all our efforts are informed by data. Which programs and strategies work, and in what contexts? How can successful approaches be shared? Third, we must accept the fact that science is a human endeavor that is affected by sociocultural factors. Often, these influences, like bias, are unintentional. Yet they can make and break careers, and individuals from under-represented groups, including women, are especially vulnerable. Finally, we need to ensure that workforce diversity is sustainable, pointing to the need to engage the private sector and to focus on all environments where scientists make important contributions.",

I make a conscientious choice to remain confident, even at the risk of violating social norms that some may consider \"overconfident\" coming from a woman. Second, be an astute observer and listener. Any environment has its own unique culture, so be ready to adjust, adapt, and tailor the way you communicate. Be aware of stereotypes, as they might pertain to you, but don't let them get in your way. Accomplishing this has a lot more to do with humor and grace than dominance and heavy-handedness! Recognize that it's critical to invite others to play their part in mentoring, diversity efforts, and community service; these activities are not just the responsibility of women and other underrepresented groups. Finally, be who you want to be, and don't feel like you need to explain why. People from all backgrounds are well-suited not only to careers in clinical, community, and implementation science but also to cutting-edge basic and applied research across all fields including neuroscience, basic-science discovery, and in leading the frontiers of research in medicine and surgery.",

However, to accomplish this goal, the NIH must improve its performance over an earlier, unsuccessful commitment to include minorities in clinical and biomedical research, the 1993 Congressionally mandated NIH Revitalization Act. The poor implementation and lack of enforcement of the NIH Revitalization Act has led to worsened health outcomes among patients and, as a result, greater racial/ethnic health disparities. African American patients, and by proxy their family members, are more likely than Whites to be incorrectly diagnosed as having a serious heart disease, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, because the diagnostic clinical studies underlying the test for this life-threatening heart condition did not include enough African Americans as healthy controls [12] . Similarly, the widely successful heart drug clopidogrel (Plavix) was developed mostly among Whites yet was successfully marketed in Hawaii, a Pacific Island, despite being ineffective for 45% of Asians and 77% of Pacific Islanders [13] . On the other hand, clinical studies that embrace the ethos of the NIH Revitalization Act ultimately benefit all people. The discovery of PCSK9 missense mutations in African Americans with unusually low LDL cholesterol allowed for the development of a new class of drugs that have revolutionized cholesterol therapy regardless of race/ethnicity [14] .",
