            "text": "Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) (genus Phlebovirus, family Bunyaviridae) is a negative-stranded RNA virus with a tripartite genome. RVFV is transmitted by mosquitoes and causes fever and severe hemorrhagic illness among humans, and fever and high rates of abortions in livestock. A nonstructural RVFV NSs protein inhibits the transcription of host mRNAs, including interferon-b mRNA, and is a major virulence factor. The present study explored a novel function of the RVFV NSs protein by testing the replication of RVFV lacking the NSs gene in the presence of actinomycin D (ActD) or a-amanitin, both of which served as a surrogate of the host mRNA synthesis suppression function of the NSs. In the presence of the hosttranscriptional inhibitors, the replication of RVFV lacking the NSs protein, but not that carrying NSs, induced doublestranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR)-mediated eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF)2a phosphorylation, leading to the suppression of host and viral protein translation. RVFV NSs promoted post-transcriptional downregulation of PKR early in the course of the infection and suppressed the phosphorylated eIF2a accumulation. These data suggested that a combination of RVFV replication and NSs-induced host transcriptional suppression induces PKR-mediated eIF2a phosphorylation, while the NSs facilitates efficient viral translation by downregulating PKR and inhibiting PKR-mediated eIF2a phosphorylation. Thus, the two distinct functions of the NSs, i.e., the suppression of host transcription, including that of type I interferon mRNAs, and the downregulation of PKR, work together to prevent host innate antiviral functions, allowing efficient replication and survival of RVFV in infected mammalian hosts.",

In endemic areas, RVFV naturally circulates among mosquitoes and ruminants, such as sheep, goat and cattle [7] . RVFV infection in adult ruminants causes febrile illness and a high rate of abortions, while some newborn animals less than 1-2 weeks of age develop an acute infection which results in higher mortality rates than those in adults [8] . Humans infected with RVFV usually develop an acute febrile myalgic syndrome; however, a small percentage of patients have a lethal illness that results in hepatic damage, hemorrhagic fever-like illness, encephalitis and/or retinal vasculitis [8] .",

RVFV, which belongs to the genus Phlebovirus, family Bunyaviridae, is a negative-stranded RNA virus carrying a single-stranded, tripartite RNA genome composed of S, M and L segments [14] . The S segment encodes N and NSs genes and uses an ambi-sense strategy to express the N and NSs proteins in infected cells; N mRNA encoding N protein is transcribed from the viral-sense (negative-sense) S segment, while NSs mRNA encoding NSs protein is transcribed from the antiviral-sense (positive-sense) S segment. Monocistronic M mRNA and L mRNA are transcribed from the viral-sense M and L segments, respectively. M mRNA has one large open-reading frame (ORF) which encodes the nonstructural NSm protein, a 78-kDa glycoprotein and two major viral structural glycoproteins, Gn and Gc [15, 16] . L mRNA encodes L protein, a viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Both N and L proteins are required for viral RNA synthesis, while Gn and Gc function as envelope proteins [14] . NSm and NSs, both nonstructural proteins, are dispensable for viral replication in cell cultures [17, 18, 19, 20] , but are involved in viral pathogenesis [21, 22, 23] .",

A naturally occurring RVFV mutant Clone 13, which lacks approximately 70% of the NSs gene [20] , is highly attenuated in mouse, and, when reassortant viruses between wt RVFV and Clone 13 were characterized, the NSs was revealed as a major determinant of viral virulence in the mouse model [21] . The NSs localizes in the nucleus and cytoplasm in both RVFV-infected cells and NSs-expressing cells; further, the nuclear NSs, but not the cytoplasmic NSs, forms a unique filamentous structure [24] . The NSs suppresses the transcription of host mRNAs by interacting with the p44 subunit of TFIIH, an essential transcriptional factor for cellular RNA polymerase II [25] . Furthermore, the RVFV NSs binds to Sin3A-Associated Protein 30 (SAP30), which is important for maintaining the repressor complex containing histone deacetylase 3 on the interferon (IFN)-b promoter, and suppresses the IFN-b promoter activation early in infection [26] . Accordingly, the NSs protein in the nucleus of infected cells most probably exerts these host transcriptional-suppressive activities, including that of IFN production inhibition, and contributes to viral virulence [21] . In contrast, the biological function of cytoplasmic NSs is largely unknown. RVFV NSs expression promotes RVFV minigenome RNA synthesis driven by N and L protein in expression studies [27] . Because RNA synthesis of bunyaviruses occurs in the cytoplasm, NSs protein in cytoplasm may promote the minigenome RNA synthesis by unknown mechanism.",

Thus, to secure efficient RVFV replication, the NSs protein, in turn, alters this putative, virally unfriendly cellular environment to one that supports efficient viral replication. To test this possibility, we examined the replication of RVFV lacking the NSs gene, a mutant which was generated by employing a reverse genetics system [19] , in the presence of a host transcription inhibitor, e.g., actinomycin D (ActD) or a-amanitin; these drugs were selected because they mimicked the host transcriptional suppressive activities of the NSs. Consistent with our supposition, RVFV lacking the NSs, but not RVFV, failed to replicate efficiently in ActD-treated cells. We noted that double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-dependent protein kinase (PKR)-mediated eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF)2a phosphorylation suppressed the translation of RVFV lacking NSs in the presence of ActD. Further studies uncovered that RVFV NSs promoted PKR downregulation as early as 4 hours post-infection, and prevented eIF2a phosphorylation, which secured efficient viral translation. We speculate that this novel function of RVFV is important for counteracting the antiviral activities of PKR and allowing efficient virus replication and survival in infected hosts.",

VeroE6 cells were mock-infected or independently infected with MP-12, rMP12-rLuc and rMP12-C13type, the latter of which lacks approximately 70% of the NSs ORF ( Figure 1A) , at an moi of 3. Cells were radiolabelled with [ 35 S] Methionine/Cysteine from 15 to 16 h.p.i. Cell extracts were prepared at 16 h.p.i., and the samples were applied to SDS-PAGE ( Figure 1C , top panel). In the absence of ActD, the host protein synthesis of rMP12-rLuc-infected cells ( Figure 1C , lane 5) and rMP12-C13type-infected cells ( Figure 1C , lane 7) was more efficient than that of MP-12-infected cells ( Figure 1C , lane 3). It is possible that NSs-mediated transcriptional suppression that occurred only in MP-12-infected cells, but not in cells infected with viruses lacking NSs, caused a reduction of host mRNA abundance, leading to the less efficient translation of host mRNAs in MP-12-infected cells. Efficient N protein synthesis occurred in cells infected with all three viruses in the absence of ActD, a finding which was consistent with our previous studies [19] , while for some unknown reasons the accumulation of N proteins of rMP12-rLuc and rMP12-C13type was slightly higher than that of MP-12. ActD treatment resulted in a strong inhibition of both host proteins and N protein synthesis in rMP12-rLuc-infected cells ( Figure 1C , lane 6) and rMP12-C13type-infected cells ( Figure 1C , lane 8). In contrast, ActD treatment did not inhibit N protein translation in MP-12-infected cells; rather, it moderately inhibited host protein synthesis in MP-12-infected cells ( Figure 1C, lane 4) .

A major RVFV virulence factor, NSs, disables host cell mRNA synthesis. Here we describe our new evidence that showed NSs working in a second way; in addition to inhibiting host cell transcription, NSs kept translation active in infected cells. It is well-established that activated protein kinase PKR phosphorylates a translation factor, eIF2a, and then this phosphorylated eIF2a suppresses translation. We found that NSs decreased PKR abundance and prevented eIF2a phosphorylation in infected cells, allowing efficient viral translation and replication. In contrast, when cells were infected with an RVFV mutant lacking NSs in the presence of transcriptional inhibitors that mimic the transcription inhibition function of NSs, the PKR reduction did not occur and phoshorylated eIF2a was accumulated, resulting in the inhibition of virus gene expression and replication. Thus, NSs functions in two ways to help RVFV replicate in mammalian hosts: its newly identified PKR downregulation function secures efficient viral translation, and its host transcription inhibition function suppresses the expression of host innate antiviral functions.",

After virus adsorption, infected cells were mock-transfected or independently transfected with in vitro-synthesized RNA transcripts encoding chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT), MP-12 NSs, or wt RVFV ZH501 NSs. Then, the cells were mock-treated or treated with ActD. Analysis of rLuc activities at 16 h.p.i. demonstrated that NSs expression had little effect on rLuc activities in the absence of ActD (Figure 2A ). In the presence of ActD, rLuc activities were clearly higher in the cells transfected with MP-12 NSs RNA transcripts or ZH501 NSs RNA transcripts than in those transfected with CAT RNA transcripts or in the mocktransfected samples (Figure 2A ). In NSs RNA-transfected cells, similar levels of rMP-12-rLuc titers were observed in both the ActD-treated and mock-treated samples, whereas the rMP12-rLuc virus titers in mock-transfected cells and CAT RNA-transfected cells were significantly lower in the presence of ActD compared to the ActD-untreated cells ( Figure 2B ). Western blot analysis showed that NSs proteins were indeed expressed in the cells transfected with RNA transcripts encoding MP-12 NSs or wt RVFV ZH501 NSs ( Figure 2C , lanes 3, 4, 7, and 8). Also NSs protein expression increased the accumulation of rMP12-rLuc N protein in the presence of ActD ( Figure 2C, lanes 7 and 8) . These data demonstrated that NSs exerted efficient rMP12-rLuc replication in the presence of ActD. We noted that ActD treatment modestly reduced the accumulation of the CAT protein ( Figure 2C, lane 6) . Probably large amounts of CAT RNA transcripts that were introduced into the cells partly overcame the translational suppressive effects that were induced by the combination of rMP-12-rLuc replication and ActD treatment.",

Because ActD treatment at 5 mg/ml inhibits the transcription mediated by RNA polymerases I, II and III [28] , we expected a reduction in the abundance of cellular mRNAs, tRNAs, and ribosomal RNAs, leading to reduced abundances of polysomes. ActD treatment indeed resulted in a reduced abundance of polysomes, whereas it did not substantially alter the polysome pattern, a finding which suggested to us that ActD treatment did not abolish translational activities. To test the translational competence of the cells treated with transcriptional inhibitors, we transfected 293 cells with in vitro-synthesized RNA transcripts encoding rLuc gene. Cells were mock-treated or treated with ActD or a-amanitin, an RNA polymerase II inhibitor [29] . The rLuc activities at 16 h post-transfection were slightly increased in the cells treated with ActD or a-amanitin ( Figure S1B ), demonstrating active host translation activities in the presence of either ActD or a-amanitin. These data led to the suggestion that by combining the replication of RVFV lacking the NSs and treatment of ActD, a cellular condition that is unfavorable for translation could be induced and that NSs expression somehow altered the cellular environment from one that was translationally inactive to one translationally active.",

Coinfection of MP-12 resulted in the reduction of both rLuc activities ( Figure 3A ) and the amounts of rLuc mRNA ( Figure 3B , lane 4) in the absence of ActD.

We also noted that MP-12 coinfection did not reduce the abundance of the viral-sense rMP-12-rLuc S segment in the presence of ActD, and yet it caused the reduction of rLuc mRNA abundance ( Figure 3B , lane 9), which we believe implies that NSs expression and ActD treatment generated a cellular environment that was more favorable for rMP-12-rLuc RNA replication than for transcription.",

The eIF2a is a component of eIF2, which binds to GTP and Met-tRNA to deliver the Met-tRNA to the start codon in capped mRNA, forming a 43S pre-initiation complex [32] . Upon the binding of the 60S ribosomal subunits to the 43S preinitiation complex, eIF2-GDP is released from the ribosome and undergoes a GTP exchange reaction catalyzed by binding with eIF2B, and the resultant eIF2-GTP is recycled for the next round of translation initiation. The phosphorylated eIF2a binds to eIF2B with a high affinity and prevents eIF2B to be used for the subsequent eIF2-GDP-to-eIF2-GTP exchange reaction, leading to the suppression of translation initiation. Hence, the phosphorylation status of eIF2a plays a critical role in translational control [32] .",

When we analyzed the level of eIF2a phosphorylation in VeroE6 cells infected with rMP12-rLuc in the absence of transcription inhibitor, we found low levels of eIF2a phosphorylation from 8 to 24 h.p.i. and an efficient accumulation of N protein at 8 h.p.i. and onward ( Figure 4A -4C). In contrast, when we treated rMP12-rLuc-infected cells with ActD or aamanitin, either compound induced an efficient accumulation of phosphorylated eIF2a from 8 to 16 h.p.i., with a concomitant poor N protein accumulation ( Figure 4A -4C) and virus replication suppression ( Figure 4D ). The mechanism of reduction in the abundance of the phosphorylated eIF2a at 24 h.p.i. in the presence of ActD or a-amanitin ( Figure 4 , lanes 13 and 19) is unknown. When we treated rMP12-rLuc-infected cells with different concentrations of ActD or a-amanitin, we found that the inhibition of phosphorylated eIF2a accumulation was dependent on the concentrations used ( Figure S2 ). Also a strong correlation was seen between an increase in eIF2a phosphorylation and the decrease in both N protein accumulation and infectious virus production ( Figure S2 ). In contrast, no significant accumulation of phosphorylated eIF2a occurred in MP-12infected VeroE6 cells in the presence of ActD ( Figure 4A -4C). As expected, ActD treatment had little effect on MP-12 replication ( Figure 4D ). These data strongly suggested that the presence of highly phosphorylated eIF2a levels suppressed the translation of viral mRNAs, leading to inefficient virus production, and that the NSs protein somehow suppressed eIF2a phosphorylation, and facilitated efficient viral mRNA translation under the conditions of host transcriptional shutoff.",

VeroE6 cells, either infected with rMP12-rLuc or mockinfected, received the pan-caspase-inhibitor, benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-DL-Asp(OMe) fluoromethylketone (Z-VADfmk), in the presence of ActD or a-amanitin ( Figure S3 ). Judging from the resulting inhibition of cleaved caspase-3 accumulation in these cells, the Z-VADfmk treatment indeed inhibited apoptosis, whereas it had little effect on the eIF2a phosphorylation status and infectious virus yield. These data suggested to us that the accumulation of phosphorylated eIF2a in cells supporting rMP12-rLuc replication in the presence of ActD or a-amanitin was caspase-independent.",

To determine the role of PKR in the accumulation of phosphorylated eIF2a in rMP12-rLuc-infected cells treated with ActD or aamanitin, we generated a recombinant MP-12, rMP12-PKRDE7, which expresses a dominant-negative form of PKR, PKRDE7 [36] carrying the N-terminal Flag epitope tag, in place of the NSs ( Figure 5A ). If the replication of MP-12 lacking the NSs gene in cells subjected to host transcriptional suppression activates PKR, which in turn phosphorylates eIF2a, then the virally-encoded PKRDE7 in rMP12-PKRDE7-infected cells would interfere with the PKR function, resulting in the inhibition of PKR-mediated eIF2a phosphorylation and thereby leading to efficient viral translation and virus production. VeroE6 cells were mock-infected or independently infected with rMP12-rLuc, rMP12-PKRDE7 and MP-12 at an moi of 3. After the removal of the inocula, cells were treated with ActD or a-amanitin, and cell extracts were harvested at 16 h.p.i. As expected, rMP12-rLuc replication in the presence of ActD or a-amanitin induced eIF2a phosphorylation, resulted in reduced virus replication ( Figure 5B -5D). In contrast, efficient N protein accumulation and efficient virus replication, with no significant accumulation of phosphorylated eIF2a occurred in both MP-12-infected cells and rMP12-PKRDE7infected cells in the presence of ActD-or a-amanitin ( Figure 5B -5D). This finding strongly suggested that PKR is important for eIF2a phosphorylation in cells infected with the RVFV lacking the NSs in the presence of transcription inhibitors.",

Lysates were prepared at 16 h.p.i. or 16 h post-transfection, and incubated with poly I:C beads (dsRNA) or poly (C) beads (ssRNA). Then the dsRNA-bound complexes were analyzed by a Western blot in which we used an anti-Flag antibody or anti-NSs antibody ( Figure 6B ). As expected, dsRNA bound to PKRDE7 [36] , whereas it poorly bound to the NSs from rMP12-NSs-Flaginfected cells and that from the NSs-expressing cells ( Figure 6B ), which suggested that NSs did not suppress PKR activation by its binding to dsRNA.",

Cell lysates were harvested at 16 h.p.i., and PKR was immunoprecipitated by anti-human PKR antibody, and the PKR bound to the protein A beads was subjected to an immunoprecipitation (IP)-kinase assay by using [c-32 P]ATP. We used 293 cells for this assay, because anti-human PKR antibody efficiently immunoprecipitated human PKR in 293 cells, but not non-human primate PKR in VeroE6 cells (data not shown). PKR is induced by IFN-a/b treatment [38] and the abundance of PKR could affect the results of the IP-kinase assay. We suspected that replication of MP-12 mutants lacking NSs may induce IFN-b production, leading to PKR induction [38] , whereas ActD treatment prevented the IFN-b production [39] . Indeed, IFN-b mRNA accumulation occurred at 8 h.p.i. in rMP-12-rLucinfected cells in the absence of ActD, but not in the presence of ActD ( Figure 6C ), a finding which suggested that ActD treatment inhibited the transcriptional induction of PKR which was induced by the type I IFN in infected 293 cells. We noted an efficient accumulation of rMP12-rLuc N mRNA at 8 h.p.i. in the presence of ActD ( Figure 6C ). Because rMP-12-rLuc replication in the presence of ActD did not induce an accumulation of phosphorylated eIF2a early in the course of the infection ( Figure 4A ), this efficient rMP12-rLuc replication probably occurred prior to 8 h.p.i. in the presence of ActD. As shown in Figure 6D , immunoprecipitated PKR from rMP12-rLuc-Flag-infected cells was phosphorylated both in the presence and absence of ActD, which led us to suggest that rMP12-rLuc-Flag replication activated PKR. In contrast, PKR phosphorylation did not occur in mockinfected cells or cells infected with rMP12-NSs-Flag or rMP12-PKRDE7 ( Figure 6D ). Most probably, a dominant-negative PKRDE7 suppressed PKR activation and prevented PKR phosphorylation [36] . To determine why we failed to detect the presence of PKR autophosporylation in rMP12-NSs-Flag-infected cells, we examined the amounts of the immunoprecipitated PKR in these samples ( Figure 6D, bottom) . Strikingly, substantial reductions in the abundance of cytoplasmic PKR occurred only in the cells supporting rMP12-NSs-Flag replication both in the presence and absence of ActD.",

To this end, 293 cells were mock-infected, infected with MP-12, or transfected with in vitro-synthesized RNA transcripts encoding NSs. Then cells were incubated with 100 mg/ ml of puromycin to completely shut off cellular translation or puromycin untreated, and cell extracts were harvested at 16 h.p.i. or post-transfection. As expected, puromycin treatment completely abolished the synthesis of N and NSs proteins in MP-12-infected cells ( Figure 7D, lane 4) and that of NSs in cells transfected with the RNA transcripts encoding NSs ( Figure 7D, lane 6) . We found that treatment of 293 cells with puromycin for 16 h decreased the abundance of PKR only slightly ( Figure 7D, lane 2) . Accordingly, it is highly unlikely that putative NSs-induced translational We next performed pulse-chase experiments to know whether NSs expression promoted PKR degradation. Because immunoprecipitation experiments using various anti-PKR antibodies failed to convincingly demonstrate a radiolabelled endogenous PKR signal from extracts of 293 cells (data not shown), we examined the effect of NSs expression on the stability of an expressed mutant PKR, PKRK296R, lacking kinase activity [40] and carrying a Nterminal myc tag; expression of wild-type PKR was not used due to its strong host translation suppression effects (data not shown). 293 cells were mock-transfected or transfected with pcDNA3.1-Myc-PKRK296R, a plasmid encoding PKRK296R under cytomegalovirus promoter and radiolabelled with [ 35 S] methionine/cycteine between 14 and 16 h post-DNA transfection.

It was evident that the treatment of MP-12-infected cells with those proteasome inhibitors suppressed NSs-induced PKR downregulation ( Figure 7F, lanes 5 and 6) , suggesting that NSs promoted PKR downregulation by the degradation through the proteasome pathway.",

In the absence of proteasome inhibitor, a substantial reduction of PKR abundance occurred as early as 4 h.p.i., where the abundance of NSs ( Figure 7G , lane 2) was not as great as that at 8 h.p.i. (Figure 7G , lane 4). In the presence of MG132, the abundance of PKR decreased only slightly, and NSs accumulation was also somewhat less efficient. A similar trend for less efficient NSs accumulation in the presence of proteasome inhibitors was also shown in the data for Figure 7F . Our observation of less efficient NSs accumulation in MG132-treated cells was consistent with the report that MG132 induces eIF2a phosphorylation through GCN2 activation and translational suppression [42] . The abundance of NSs in MG132treated cells at 8 h.p.i. and that in untreated cells at 4 h.p.i. was similar, and yet PKR abundance in the former cells was clearly higher than that in the latter cells. Taken together, these data strongly suggested that RVFV NSs promoted PKR degradation through the proteasome-dependent pathway.",

The NSs protein was essential for efficient virus replication in the presence of ActD or a-amanitin. We found that the replication of RVFV lacking the NSs gene in the presence of a transcription inhibitor induced an accumulation of phosphorylated eIF2a, The accumulation of phosphorylated eIF2a in the presence of transcriptional inhibitors, did not occur in VeroE6 cells that were infected with RVFV expressing a dominant-negative form of PKR (PKRDE7) and in MEF cells lacking functional PKR ( Figure 5 ). These findings suggested to us that PKR played a major role in increasing phosphorylated eIF2a; however, it is currently unclear whether other kinases, such as PERK or GCN2, have a possible role in eIF2a phosphorylation in rMP-12-rLuc-infected cells in the presence of transcriptional inhibitors. The endogenous PKRmediated eIF2a phosphorylation suppressed translation of the RVFV lacking the NSs gene, resulting in poor virus replication. Our data further suggested that the NSs promoted PKR degradation most probably through a proteasome-dependent pathway and prevented eIF2a phosphorylation, leading to efficient viral translation.

            "text": "The past studies [25, 26, 45] and the data shown in this study illustrate that two distinct biological activities of the RVFV NSs protein worked together to secure efficient RVFV replication. Namely, nuclear NSs protein inhibits transcription of host mRNAs, including the IFN mRNAs; this activity is critical for efficient RVFV replication in IFN-competent systems [25, 45] . However, a combination of RVFV replication and NSs-mediated host mRNA transcriptional suppression possibly induces PKR activation and subsequent eIF2a phosphorylation as a combination of RVFV replication and ActD or a-amanitin treatment induced it. The NSs protein, in turn, promotes PKR downregulation as early as 4 h.p.i., and prevents eIF2a phosphorylation to secure the translation of viral mRNAs and efficient virus replication. We think that both of these two NSs functions are tightly related and protect efficient viral replication by suppressing host antiviral responses. In RVFV-infected cells, the NSs establishes general transcriptional suppression at a later stage of infection (after 8 h.p.i.) [25] , while NSs also suppresses specific IFN-b mRNA transcription at early stages of infection (about 3 h.p.i.) by maintaining repressor complex including SAP30 on IFN-b promoter [26, 45] . PKR downregulation early in infection is probably important for maintaining efficient viral translation in combination with the suppression of host IFN responses.",

            "text": "We suspect that the NSs-mediated PKR downregulation activity is important for RVFV replication and survival in infected mammalian hosts. RVFV-infection in rhesus monkeys showed that type I IFN is detectable around 1 day post-infection in both clinically ill surviving monkeys and lethally infected monkeys, and one dead monkey even kept high titer of IFN (120 to 480 U/ml) from 1 day post-infection [46] . In fact, the best correlation with outcome was early detection of IFN and not necessarily the height of the response. NSs suppresses IFN-b mRNA transcription early in the course of infection in cultured cells [26, 45] . Our present data suggest that the early downregulation of PKR in RVFVinfected cells might contribute to the inhibition of type I IFN induction, because PKR is known to serve as a pathogenrecognition receptor [47] . Furthermore, some of the host pathogen-recognition receptors, e.g., toll-like receptors 3 and 7, in uninfected cells located near the RVFV-infected cells, recognize virus-specific signals, e.g., viral RNAs in the virus particles or viral dsRNAs in the cell debris from infected cells, leading to type I IFN production. Because the transcriptional promoter of the PKR gene contains an IFN-stimulated response element, and IFN stimulation induces PKR mRNA transcription [38] , PKR abundance is likely increased in many uninfected cells of infected animals; RVFV needs to replicate in such cells to survive in infected hosts. The reduction in PKR abundance occurred as early as 4 h.p.i. ( Figure 7G ) and the NSs protein is produced very early in RVFV infection [48] . Immediate NSs synthesis and subsequent NSsinduced PKR downregulation in the cells, some of which have increased PKR abundance, could rapidly disarm the PKRmediated, antiviral functions and contribute to RVFV replication and survival in animal hosts.",

The increased amounts of phosphorylated eIF2a clearly correlated with the concentration of ActD or a-amanitin in rMP12-rLuc-infected cells ( Figure S2 ). In contrast, rMP12-rLuc replication in the absence of transcriptional suppressor induced only low levels of eIF2a phosphorylation (Figure 4 ). Yet, the phosphorylation of PKR occurred in cells supporting the replication of RVFV lacking NSs both in the absence and presence of ActD ( Figure 6D ).

            "text": "Several different mechanisms are conceivable for the accumulation of phosphorylated eIF2a in rMP12-rLuc-infected in cells treated with ActD or a-amanitin (Figure 4 ). One possible mechanism relates to the eIF2a dephosphorylation step. Phosphorylation of eIF2a at Serine 51 induces a rapid synthesis of activating transcription factor (ATF)-4 mRNA, which can be translated in the presence of phosphorylated eIF2a [49] . Expressed ATF4 then induces GADD34 mRNA transcription [50] and GADD34 protein interacts with type 1 protein serine/ threonine phosphatase, PP1, and this complex dephosphorylates eIF2a to resume the cellular translation [51] . rMP12-rLuc replication in transcriptionally active cells probably induced PKR activation and eIF2a phosphorylation, the latter of which then induced GADD34 upregulation and subsequent eIF2a dephosphorylation allowing efficient viral translation. rMP12-rLuc replication in cells treated with ActD induced PKR activation, the extent of which was similar to that of infected, ActD-untreated cells ( Figure 6D ), whereas the transcription inhibitors would prevent GADD34 upregulation and subsequent eIF2a dephosphorylation, causing an accumulation of phosphorylated eIF2a, which inhibited viral translation. Other possible mechanisms relate to the failure to suppress the PKR function. Cells infected with adenovirus, human immunodeficiency virus-1, or herpes simplex virus undergo a dramatic increase in the abundance of Alu RNA, which carries a repetitive element of ,300-nt in length that is transcribed by RNA polymerase III [52, 53, 54, 55] . Alu RNA forms a stable complex with PKR, and antagonizes the PKR activation [56] . If rMP12-rLuc replication induces Alu RNA accumulation to prevent PKR activation, then the drug-induced transcriptional suppression would inhibit Alu RNA accumulation, preventing Alu RNA-mediated PKR inactivation. Another possibility is that rMP12-rLuc replication transcriptionally induces host mRNAs, and some of their gene products have PKR inhibition activities. An example of this possibility is that influenza virus replication induces P58 IPK , an inhibitor of PKR [57] . ActD or a-amanitin treatment suppresses the expression of the putative PKR inhibitor, resulting in an accumulation of phosphorylated eIF2a. Alternatively, transcriptional suppression may result in reduced amounts of ribosomal proteins, such as L18, which binds to PKR and inhibits PKR activation [58, 59] . These possibilities are not mutually exclusive, and the combination of these possibilities may contribute to the accumulation of phosphorylated eIF2a in the cells supporting replication of RVFV lacking the NSs in the presence of ActD or aamanitin.",

In contrast to poliovirus, only RVFV NSs protein was probably required for PKR downregu-lation since the downregulation of PKR occurred as early as 4 h.p.i. in RVFV-infected cells ( Figure 7G ), whereas phosphorylated eIF2a accumulation occurred around 8 h.p.i. in rMP-12-rLuc-infected cells in the presence of ActD (Figure 4 ).

The NSs-induced PKR downregulation occurred as early as 4 h.p.i. of MP-12 ( Figure 7G ). We also demonstrated the presence of PKR mRNA in NSs-expressing cells ( Figure 7C ) and that ActD treatment had little effect on the NSs-induced PKR downregulation ( Figure 7B ). We failed to detect PKR at 16 h.p.i. of MP-12infected 293 cells, and yet we easily detected the PKR after a 16 hlong incubation of 293 cells with puromycin ( Figure 7D ). Accordingly, the putative NSs-induced translational inhibition was not a main reason for the reduction in the abundance of PKR. Furthermore, pulse-chase experiments showed that NSs expression reduced the abundance of radiolabelled myc-tagged PKR ( Figure 7E ).

Because NSs induced PKR degradation in ActD-treated cells and ActD treatment completely inhibited the IFN-c mRNA accumulation ( Figure 6C ), it is highly unlikely that IFN-c was involved in the NSs-induced PKR downregulation. PKC activation also potentially induces PKR downregulation [41] . Treatment of MP-12-infected cells with a PKC inhibitor, G\u00d6 6983, did not inhibit NSs-mediated PKR downregulation ( Figure 7D ), which implied that PKC was not involved in it. Experiments using a proteasome inhibitor suggested that the NSs promoted PKR degradation through a proteasome pathway ( Figure 7F ). MG132 can induce GCN activation and translational suppression [42] . In fact, treatment of MP-12infected cells with MG132 and lactacystin moderately reduced the accumulation of NSs ( Figure 7F and 7G) . Accordingly, a possibility still exists that the MG132-induced moderate translational inhibition affected the NSs-induced PKR degradation in MG132-treated cells. For example, if the NSs-induced PKR downregulation requires an unstable host protein, then the MG132-induced moderate translational suppression would prevent accumulation of this putative host protein, resulting in inhibition of the NSs-induced PKR downregulation. Obviously further studies are required to elucidate the mechanism of PKR downregulation mediated by RVFV NSs.",

Data are expressed as mean+/2standard deviation of three independent experiments. (C) Vero cells were mock-infected or independently infected with MP-12, rMP12-rLuc, and rMP12-C13type as described above. Cells were radiolabelled with [ 35 S] labelled Methionine/Cysteine between 15 h.p.i. and 16 h.p.i. Cell extracts were prepared at 16 h.p.i. and applied to SDS-PAGE (top panel). Intensities of signals in three separate areas (area 1, 2, and 3), which were determined by densitometric analysis, are shown at the bottom of the top panel. Signal intensities of the mock-infected cells were used as the scale to measure the others and were considered as 100%. The intensities of RVFV N proteins were also shown at the bottom of the top panel (N). The signal intensity of N protein in MP-12-infected cells in the absence of ActD was represented as 100%.

Cells were immediately treated with 5 mg/ml of ActD (Act) or 50 mg/ml of a-amanitin (Ama), or were untreated. Cell extracts were prepared at 16 h.p.i. for (Figure 5E, bottom panel). These data were consistent with a notion that PKR triggered the accumulation of phosphorylated eIF2a in cells infected with the MP-12 lacking the NSs, under the conditions of cellular transcriptional suppression, and the NSs protein interfered with the PKR-mediated eIF2a phosphorylation (Figure 5B-5D).",

In the right panel, 293 cells were transfected with in vitro-synthesized RNA transcripts encoding RVFV MP-12 NSs. At 16 h.p.i. or 16 h post-transfection, cytoplasmic lysates (L) were incubated with poly C (pC) beads or poly I:C (pIC) beads. The dsRNA binding activity of the NSs was analyzed as described in Materials and Methods. Proteins bound to beads were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-Flag antibody (left panel) or anti-NSs antibody (right panel). Asterisk (*) represents the NSs. (C) 293 cells were infected with rMP12-rLuc or MP-12 at an moi of 3. After infection, cells were mock-treated(2) or immediately treated with ActD (+) at 5 mg/ml. Total RNA was harvested at 8 h.p.i., and accumulations of IFN-b mRNA, antiviral-sense S segment RNA, N mRNA, and GAPDH mRNA were analyzed by Northern blot.

Total RNA was harvested at 8 h post-transfection, and analyzed by real-time PCR. The relative abundance of PKR mRNA of each sample was calculated by the DDC T method based on the abundance of 18S ribosomal RNA. The data shown in the graph (mean+/2standard deviation) were obtained from three independent experiments. The p value was determined by Student's ttest (*: p,0.05). (D) 293 cells were mock-infected (Mock) or infected with MP-12 at an moi of 3 or transfected with in vitro-synthesized RNA transcripts encoding NSs.
