The status of the heart failure patients were checked before and after CRT. Biochemical (ACE and sACE2 activity, ACE concentration) and echocardiographic parameters (EF, left ventricular enddiastolic (EDD) and end-systolic diameter (ESD) and dP/dt) were measured. sACE2 activity negatively correlated with EF and positively with ESD and EDD in all patient's populations, while it was independent in the healthy cohort. sACE2 activity was already increased in the hypertensive group, where signs for imminent heart failure (slightly decreased EF and barely increased NT-proBNP levels) were detected. sACE2 activities further increased in patients with definitive heart failure (EF, 50%), while sACE2 activities decreased with the improvement of the heart failure after CRT (reverse remodeling). Serum angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) concentrations were lower in the diseased populations, but did not show a strong correlation with the echocardiographic parameters.",

Ang-(1-7) is a biologically active metabolite of the RAS acting through the G-proteincoupled Mas receptor [4] . Ang-(1-7) is capable of reducing myocardial oxidative stress and pathological remodeling [5] . Mas receptor can hetero-oligomerize with AT1R acting as a physiological antagonist of AngII [6] .",

It was suggested that myocardial sACE2 gene expression is increased in patients with left ventricular dysfunction [20] and TACE is also upregulated in HF [9] .

It leads to secondary cardiomyopathy, coronary artery disease, stroke, peripheral artery disease, chronic nephropathy, neuropathy and many other severe pathologies and ultimately increases mortality. Interestingly, most of the cases (up to 95%) do not have identifiable cause (essential hypertension). It is important to note, that there are effective treatments for hypertension, making it a relatively easily manageable disease, but there is no cure for it, which is probably related to the issue, that the very also determined with respect of the New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class of the patients before (HF -CRT before, panel D) and after CRT (HF -CRT after, panel E).

In addition, individual values for the patients after CRT (HF -CRT after) are also shown (panels cause of the disease is not known.

            "text": "Here we found for the first time that serum ACE2 activities are increased in hypertensive patients (without apparent heart failure, ejection fraction .50%) compared to healthy individuals. Nonetheless, these hypertensive patients already had a barely decreased ejection fraction compared to the healthy population and also featured slightly elevated NT-proBNP levels, suggesting that this population is at imminent heart failure. At this stage of the disease serum ACE2 activity was already elevated although it did not correlate with NT-proBNP levels. It appears therefore, that serum ACE2 activity is another biomarker of imminent heart failure in hypertension. Importantly, sACE2 may also be related to the cause of the disease. It can regulate (decrease) local angiotensin B-D). Serum ACE2 activities were plotted as a function of ejection fraction (EF, panel B), end systolic diameter (ESD, panel C) and end diastolic diameter (EDD, panel D). Plots were fitted by linear regression and the goodness of fits is indicated by the 'r' values, while the correlations are represented by the 'P' values. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0087845.g004 II levels, affecting vascular diameter (vascular smooth muscle located angiotensin receptors) and sympathetic tone (neuronal angiotensin receptors). It may also contribute to the synthesis of angiotensin peptides which may activate the Mas receptor, believed to be beneficial in hypertension. This hypothesis is supported by recent findings suggesting that serum ACE is a ratelimiting step in RAAS: endogenous inhibitors [31] , such as serum albumin [32] effectively (.90%) inhibit circulating ACE activity in human.",

Modulation of sACE2 activity in the nervous system (overexpression) also attenuated hypertension [12] indicating a possibly protective role of sACE2 in hypertension. Genetic inactivation of sACE2 was again found to be a negative regulator of the RAS in blood pressure control [11] [13] [14] . Moreover, genetic association studies have shown a strong association of sACE2 polymorphisms to hypertension in different human populations [5] [16] [17] , although without reference to the actual effect of these polymorphisms on the circulating ACE2 activity.

In particular, improving EF after CRT correlated negatively with serum ACE2 activities ( Figure 4A and 4B), improvement of cardiac morphological parameters correlated positively with sACE2 activities (ESD, Figure 4C and EDD, Figure 4D ).",

In particular, soluble ACE concentration was lower before pacemaker implantation than in the healthy individuals and in patients with hypertension with preserved ejection fraction and it increased in parallel with the improvement of cardiac function ( Figure 6B ). In spite of increased soluble ACE concentrations soluble ACE activity did not change in the diseased populations ( Figure 6A ) suggesting effective therapeutical inhibition of ACE, besides to the recently shown stabilizing effect of serum albumin on ACE activity [30] . Regression analyses of ACE concentration with EF, ESD and EDD before and after CRT groups did not show any correlation in spite to the promising correlation between soluble ACE concentration and cardiovascular disease ( Figure 6C-6H) . Moreover, although ACE expression was lower in patients with heart failure before CRT, this general relationship disappeared after Figure 6 . Serum ACE activity and concentration in patients with normal systolic left ventricular function and in patients with systolic heart failure. Serum ACE activity (panel A) and ACE concentration (panel B) were measured in healthy people (n = 45, filled bar), in patients with preserved ejection fraction (hypertensive, n = 40, grey bar) and in patients with severe heart failure before (HF -CRT before) and after cardiac resynchronization therapy (HF -CRT after, n = 65, open bars). Statistical analyses of biochemical measurements was performed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Newman-Keuls test for multiple comparisons between groups. Bars represent mean 6 S.E.M. Significant differences are labeled by asterisks (* P,0.01 and ** P,0.001). Values for the individual patients were also plotted. Serum ACE concentration is showed as a function of the ejection fraction (EF, panels C and D), end systolic diameter (ESD, panels E and F) and end diastolic diameter (EDD, panels G and H). Plots were fitted by linear regression. Values for the goodness of the fits (r) and for the level of correlations (P) are also indicated. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0087845.g006",

Mca-APK(Dnp) was incubated with a single test human serum sample for 120 min in the presence of 0-3 mM sACE2 inhibitor DX600, as detailed in the methods. DX600 completely inhibited Mca-APK(Dnp) hydrolysis in a concentration dependent manner in accordance with its inhibitory activity on sACE2. (TIFF) Figure 7 . Hypothetic model for RAS regulation in heart failure. Angiotensin I (AngI) is being converted to angiotensin II (AngII) by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). AngII is further metabolized to angiotensin 1-7 (Ang-(1-7)) by sACE2. AngII binds to and activate the type 1 AngII receptors (AT1R), while Ang-(1-7) binds to and activate the Mas receptor. Levels of tissue located and soluble forms of these enzymes determine local levels of angiotensin peptides. We hypothesize that a significant redistribution of tissue and soluble ACE and ACE2 occurs in human heart failure which changes are reversible upon improvement of the cardiac function. In particular, sACE2 limits AngII levels under healthy conditions, resulting in a low level of ATR1 stimulation and high Mas receptor stimulation, a condition which is beneficial in cardiovascular physiology. However, ACE2 is probably re-distributed in imminent or definitive heart failure. As a result, its activity increases in the circulating blood, but decreases in the tissues. This result in higher local Ang II levels, higher AT1R stimulation and lower Mas receptor activation. These latter features being characteristic to heart failure. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0087845.g007",
