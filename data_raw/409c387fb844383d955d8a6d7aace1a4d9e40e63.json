Serological and virological studies have shown evidence of MERS-CoV infection in camels in the Middle East, as well as in East, North and West Africa [2] [3] [4] [5] and in Central Asia [6] . In spite of MERS-CoV being enzootic in camels in Africa, zoonotic MERS has not been reported from the African continent. Our recent genetic and phenotypic analysis of MERS-CoV from camels in West (Burkina Faso, Nigeria) Africa has shown that West African viruses were phylogenetically and phenotypically distinct from those associated with human disease in the Arabian Peninsula [7] , raising the possibility that virus strain differences may be associated with differences in zoonotic potential.",

However, there is a paucity of serological data on MERS-CoV infection in people occupationally exposed to camels in Africa, a knowledge gap identified as a priority research question at a Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations-World Organisation for Animal Health-World Health Organization (FAO-OIE-WHO) Global Technical Meeting on MERS in September 2017 [1] . A previous study in Egypt in 2013 showed no serologic evidence of MERS-CoV among 179 serum samples from humans working in two camel abattoirs [3] . None of 760 people with household exposure to seropositive camels in Kenya in 2013 had evidence of MERS-CoV antibody [9] . Another study in Kenya in 2013-14 of 1,122 people (not with necessarily high exposure to camels) found two sera with low and inconclusive levels of neutralising antibody to MERS-CoV [10] . It remains important to carry out more sero-epidemiological studies on humans with occupational exposure to infected camels to understand whether or not zoonotic transmission is taking place in Africa. We therefore investigated for serological evidence of MERS-CoV infection of humans occupationally exposed to infected dromedary camels in an abattoir in Kano, Nigeria.",

In addition to occupational exposure to camels in the slaughtering process, of the 50 workers in the abattoir with no occupational exposure to camels or camel meat (Table) 15 reported frequent drinking of fresh camel milk, 10 drank fresh camel urine and 10 used camel urine as medicine. The complete absence of MERS-CoV antibodies in workers is striking. Although the serological assays were carried out using the spike protein of the prototype MERS-CoV strain EMC, we have shown that MERS-CoV from diverse parts of Africa, including Nigeria/NS004/2015, do not differ antigenically from the prototype MERS-CoV EMC strain [7] . Thus antigenic diversity is unlikely to explain the lack of seropositivity observed in camel-exposed individuals in Nigeria. The MERS-spike protein pseudoparticle neutralisation assay has comparable sensitivity to plaque neutralisation tests in detecting antibody in humans infected with MERS-CoV [14] .",

            "text": "MERS-CoV seroprevalence in persons with occupational exposure to camels in the Arabian Peninsula was significantly higher than in the general population; five (3.6%) of 140 workers occupationally exposed to camels in Saudi Arabia investigated in 2013-14 and two of five camel slaughterers in a central animal market in Qatar tested in 2014 were MERS-CoV seropositive [8, 15] . Two of 22 camel barn workers at a camel race track in Qatar were seropositive [15] . In our study, of 261 workers exposed to camels in the abattoir in Kano, Nigeria, none were seropositive. This seropositivity rate is significantly lower than that of the camel abattoir workers in Saudi Arabia (p = 0.0049, Fisher's exact test) and that of the camel barn workers at a race track in Qatar (p = 0.0058). The finding of only negative test results in 113 camel slaughterers in this study yields a significantly different rate of seropositivity than that in camel slaughterers in an animal market in Qatar (p = 0.0014). Our results are concordant with that of a study in Kenya, East Africa, where there was no evidence of antibody in serum of 760 people with household or occupational exposure to MERS-CoV seropositive camels [9] . Another study of the general population from Kenya, found evidence of neutralising MERS-CoV antibody at very low antibody titre in two of 1,122 sera (0.18%) [10] , comparable with a general population seroprevalence of 0.15% of sera from Saudi Arabia [8] . But it is unclear if these low antibody titres reflect actual infection with MERS-CoV. MERS-CoV from West Africa, including Nigeria, were genetically and phenotypically distinct from those in East Africa [7] and thus zoonotic potential of viruses from Nigeria may be different from those in Kenya. Overall, these data may suggest that the risk of MERS infection from exposure to infected camels may be lower in some African countries.",

In a cohort of patients with RT-PCR confirmed MERS in the South Korean outbreak in 2015 who were serologically followed up for one year, four of the six patients who had mild disease (i.e. did not require supplemental oxygen or mechanical ventilation) were negative by S1 ELISA, two were positive by plaque reduction neutralisation test (PRNT)90 (titre 1:10) and of these two only one was positive by ppNT (titre of 10) [16] . Although designated as having mild disease, with one exception, these patients, had chest infiltrates on X-ray, indicating lung parenchymal pathology. In another cohort of South Korean MERS patients, none of three persons with asymptomatic infection and only six of 10 patients with symptomatic disease without pneumonia seroconverted, whereas most patients with severe pneumonia did seroconvert [17] . Therefore it is possible that camel exposed individuals who get asymptomatic or mild infections may not seroconvert. Even in those who do develop detectable antibody, waning antibody titres may lead to negative serological results. Thus sero-epidemiological studies may well underestimate the true extent of MERS-CoV infection in humans. A recent study showed that virus-specific CD8 + T-cell responses were detected in mild or asymptomatic patients with MERS-CoV infection, even in the absence of serologic responses [18] . T-cell responses and their specificity for MERS-CoV should also be investigated in future studies for identifying evidence of zoonotic MERS-CoV infection in high risk groups.",
