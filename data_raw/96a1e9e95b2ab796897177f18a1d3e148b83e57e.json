            "text": "An acute outbreak of porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV) infection in piglets, characterized with neurological symptoms, vomiting, diarrhea, and wasting, occurred in China. Coronavirus-like particles were observed in the homogenized tissue suspensions of the brain of dead piglets by electron microscopy, and a wild PHEV strain was isolated, characterized, and designated as PHEV-CC14. Histopathologic examinations of the dead piglets showed characteristics of nonsuppurative encephalitis, and some neurons in the cerebral cortex were degenerated and necrotic, and neuronophagia. Similarly, mice inoculated with PHEV-CC14 were found to have central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction, with symptoms of depression, arched waists, standing and vellicating front claws. Furthmore, PHEV-positive labeling of neurons in cortices of dead piglets and infected mice supported the viral infections of the nervous system. Then, the major structural genes of PHEV-CC14 were sequenced and phylogenetically analyzed, and the strain shared 95%-99.2% nt identity with the other PHEV strains available in GenBank. Phylogenetic analysis clearly proved that the wild strain clustered into a subclass with a HEV-JT06 strain. These findings suggested that the virus had a strong tropism for CNS, in this way, inducing nonsuppurative encephalitis as the cause of death in piglets. Simultaneously, the predicted risk of widespread transmission showed a certain variation among the PHEV strains currently circulating around the world. Above all, the information presented in this study can not only provide good reference for the experimental diagnosis of PHEV infection for pig breeding, but also promote its new effective vaccine development.

Many infected piglets characterized with vomiting and nerve symptoms, and some cases were accompanied by screaming or diarrhea; all of the piglets with clinical symptoms died finally. In this paper, the diagnosis was made on the basis of pathologic features, immunohistochemistry, microbiological detection, and RT-PCR.

At the time of the outbreak, these pigs had not been immunized with any PHEV vaccines; the total proportion of deaths in piglets that had not been weaned was 46.7% (140 dead piglets). The collected samples were tested for PHEV using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) targeting the HE gene, as well as for other viruses that cause similar clinical symptoms among swine, including porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), and pseudorabies virus (PRV). All experiments on piglets research were performed in accordance with Animal Welfare Ethical Committee of Jilin University guidelines and regulations (permission number 2012-CVM-12). The involved RT-PCR primers were designed based on the most conserved segment of their genomes (Table 1) , and subsequently validated by BLAST (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST) with sequences from GenBank. The original samples were diluted 10-fold with phosphatebuffered saline (PBS) and were centrifuged at 3,000\u00d7 g at 4 \u2022 C for 10 min. The supernatant was filtered through a 0.22-\u00b5m syringe filter, and was used as inoculums for BALB/c mice or for virus isolation in Neuro-2a cell culture.",

Therewith, the corresponding nucleotides and deduced amino acid sequences of the PHEV-CC14 strain were compared with the homologous sequences of PHEVs. The results showed that the PHEV-CC14 strain shared 95%-99.2% nt identities with the other PHEV strains available in GenBank. The structural genes of the PHEV-CC14 strain had the greatest nucleotide sequence similarity (99.2%) to the HEV-JT06 strain (GenBank: ED919227.1), and it shared 99% with HEV 67N (GenBank: AY078417.1).

The clinical signs consisted of vomiting, twitching, wasting, and diarrhea were observed in suckling piglets. The histologic autopsy showed that there were pinpoint petechiae in the kidneys, thinning of the intestinal wall, and hemorrhage in the brain. Due to the great similarity between PHEV and pseudorabies virus (PRV) infection in piglets, it was difficult to distinguish them only by clinical and autopsy symptoms. Therefore, PRV and PHEV were first detected by PCR and RT-PCR, respectively, and the test results showed that PRV was negative, and PHEV was positive, thus excluding PRV infection. At the same time, no sow abortions or stillbirth phenomena were found in the pigs, also supporting the above results. Immunohistochemical staining results further confirmed PHEV infection in the brains of the dead piglets. Vomiting and neurological symptoms are common in piglets infected with PHEV, but the symptom of diarrhea is relatively rare. Because the outbreak was characterized by vomiting and diarrhea, some other viral infections with similar clinical symptoms have been reported in pigs, including PEDV, TGEV and DPCoV (Ma et al., 2015; Song, Moon & Kang, 2015; Tanaka et al., 2015) .",

PHEV has a typical neural tropism, and it invades the central nervous system via the peripheral nervous system (Hirano et al., 2004; Lafaille et al., 2015; Lee et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2014) . Previous studies have shown that the virus successfully killed 1-to 8-weekold mice readily by different routes, and viral antigen was detected in both peripheral nerves and the CNS (Hirano et al., 2001; Hirano et al., 1995; Hirano et al., 2006) . In this paper, three-week-old BALB/c mice were chosen for inoculation with PHEV-CC14 by the intranasal route, and the results of the experiment confirmed that PHEV-CC14 had strong pathogenicity to mice. Viral titers of PHEV-CC14 or HEV 67N were determined by TCID 50 , and the growth curve showed that there was no significant difference in replication or proliferation between them. To characterize the virus isolates, the complete structural genes were sequenced and analyzed, and the phylogenetic relationships among the coronavirus strains were determined. Phylogenetic trees showed that the wild type and HEV-JT06 shared the highest homology, and that identified with HEV 67N was 99%. These findings suggested that PHEV strains currently circulating in China are closely related. Notably, the PHEV strain JT06 isolated from Jilin province, China, in 2006 was most closely related to the emerging PHEV-CC14 strains, suggesting that they could be derived from a similar ancestral strain. Furthermore, we performed sequence alignment and homology analysis between PHEV-CC14 and other coronaviruses, which including MHV, BCoV, HCoV-OC43 and Bat CoV, and we found it shared up to 91% homology with HCoV-OC43 (GenBank: KF530085) (Gonzalez et al., 2003; Li, 2015; Snijder, Horzinek & Spaan, 1993) . This finding suggested that, although PHEV infection in humans has not been reported currently, there is a definite potential threat to human health.",

            "text": "According to the deduced amino acids of the PHEV-CC14 strains, genetic evolution and variation analyses were performed. It was found that the broad variation occurred in the encoded structural proteins and functional region. There were five major structural proteins of PHEV, HE, S, E, M and N proteins, encoded from 5 UTR to 3 UTR (Vijgen et al., 2006; Weiss & Navas-Martin, 2005) . Sequence analyses of the five structural proteins of the PHEV-CC14 field isolate suggested that PHEV has remained more genetically stable in the E, M and N proteins (Schultze et al., 1990; Vieler et al., 1995) . The HE proteins of some coronaviruses are involved in the release of virions from the host cell, and it has been shown to have acetylesterase activity and to function as a receptor-destroying enzyme, which might be related to the early adsorption of coronavirus (Schultze et al., 1991) . Compared with HEV 67N, there were two amino acids (S12G, T114I) in the HE protein of PHEV-CC14 that were meaningful mutations, while six amino acid variations were observed (S12G, S15G, K49N, T114I, V116A, L161F) when blasted with the IAF-404 strain. We hypothesize that the amino acid variation of the HE protein might have a certain effect on replication and virulence, but it was difficult to explain the differences in virulence among the pigs, based on the amino acid changes. In addition, there were some variations of the amino acids in the S protein, which plays vital roles in viral entry, cell-to-cell spread, and the determination of tissue tropism (Dong et al., 2015; Lu, Wang & Gao, 2015) . Therefore, the differences in virulence of PHEV strains might be caused by multiple factors, and the variation of the whole genome has resulted in changes in their antigenic differences.",
