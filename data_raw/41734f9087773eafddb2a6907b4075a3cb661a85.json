In China, eight IIDs are listed as notifiable infectious diseases, including cholera, poliomyelitis, dysentery, typhoid and paratyphoid (TAP), viral Hepatitis A, viral Hepatitis E, hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) and other infectious diarrhoeal diseases (OIDDs). The aim of the study is to analyse the spatio-temporal distribution of IIDs from 2006 to 2016. Methods: Data on the incidence of IIDs from 2006 to 2016 were collected from the public health science data centre issued by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. This study applied seasonal decomposition analysis, spatial autocorrelation analysis and space-time scan analysis. Plots and maps were constructed to visualize the spatio-temporal distribution of IIDs.",

The incidence of OIID remained steady. Summer is the season with the greatest number of cases of different IIDs. Regarding the spatial distribution, approximately all p values for the global Moran's I from 2006 to 2016 were less than 0.05, indicating that the incidences of the epidemics were unevenly distributed throughout the country. The high-risk areas for HFMD and OIDD were located in the Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan (BTT) region and south China. The high-risk areas for TAP were located in some parts of southwest China. A higher incidence rates for dysentery and Hepatitis A were observed in the BTT region and some west provincial units. The high-risk areas for Hepatitis E were the BTT region and the Yangtze River Delta area.",

HFMD and OIDD exhibited high incidence rates, which reflected the negligence of Class C diseases by the government. At the same time, the incidence rate of Hepatitis E gradually surpassed Hepatitis A. The authorities should pay more attention to Class C diseases and Hepatitis E. Regardless of the various distribution patterns of IIDs, disease-specific, location-specific, and disease-combined interventions should be established.",

The main symptoms of intestinal infectious diseases include nausea, vomiting, fever, headache, limb pain, abdominal pain, loss of appetite, systemic poisoning, diarrhoea, and other gastrointestinal symptoms, which may lead to death if not treated promptly. IIDs have posed public health threats and resulted in severe social and economic burdens due to the high incidence and morbidity rates, particularly in young children [1] [2] [3] . Several large, severe global disease outbreaks have been associated with IIDs, such as the outbreaks of HFMD in east and southeast Asia in the early twenty-first century [4] , the constantly high burden of cholera that persists in many African countries, and the cholera outbreaks with active cholera transmission in many sub-Saharan African countries [5] . According to the sustainable development goals (SDG), we should combat hepatitis, water-borne diseases and other communicable diseases. IIDs represent a significant obstacle to achieving SDG [6] .",

Global Moran's I measures the general spatial autocorrelation and the spatial distribution of research object. Local Moran's I reflects the local spatial autocorrelation and the cluster regions. In the present study, spatial autocorrelation was applied to analyse the IIDs. Global Moran's I shows the overall cluster level and distribution of IIDs; local Moran's I reveals the specific cluster regions and cluster categories and the hotspots of IIDs [24] .",

According to the incidence rates recorded from 2006 to 2016, the temporal trends differed. Regarding the absolute incidence of cases, the incidence of HFMD was higher than the other IIDs, and it gradually became a wide-spread disease, which is consistent with the results from the study by Zhang [30] . Then, dysentery and OIDD were less severe diseases. Hepatitis A, Hepatitis E and TAP were the least severe diseases, according to the incidence rates. Regarding the trend, the incidence rates of HFMD and Hepatitis E showed a distinct increasing trend, consistent with the results from the study by Zhu. As the epidemic of Hepatitis A was controlled, the percentage of Hepatitis E cases among patients with viral hepatitis and among patients with IIDs has increased. The mortality rate of Hepatitis E has increased among infectious diseases [31] . The trend in the incidence of OIDD was almost unchangeable. Dysentery and TAP displayed obvious decreasing trends. The analysis of dysentery filled the research gap in the study by Xie et al., which showed a decreasing trend in the incidence of dysentery from 2005 to 2010 [32] . The results for TAP were similar to the findings reported by Liu [33] , which showed a decreasing trend. The improvement in sanitation facilities and the reduction in food and water pollution likely contributed to the decreasing trend in the incidence rates of these diseases. Hepatitis A exhibited a slight increasing trend in the first 2 years, followed by a decreasing trend. This result was similar to the findings reported by Zhu [19] . In conclusion, class B diseases were prevented with high efficiency. Class C diseases experienced a higher incidence rate and gradually increasing trend. Regarding the seasonal changes, the incidence of HFMD and dysentery peaked in the summer, Hepatitis E exhibited a high-incidence season in spring, OIDD peaked in summer and a smaller peak in autumn, the peak incidence of Hepatitis A occurred in summer and spring, and a distinct peak for TAP was not observed. Previous studies have revealed an association between the IIDs and seasons [16, [34] [35] [36] [37] . The occurrence of intestinal infectious diseases is related to climatic factors, such as the sunshine duration, temperature and humidity, as well as the quality of food and drinking water [38] . Due to the high temperature and humidity in summer, which are conducive to bacterial reproduction, food and water are easily contaminated. At the same time, the human immune system is relatively weak due to higher bodily exertion in summer. In conclusion, summer is the season with the highest incidence rates for IIDs and should receive closer attention.",

The former two sites are developed areas with extensive urbanization, which attract larger mobile populations characterized by low immune systems, poor living environments and living conditions, and poor health and knowledge of epidemic prevention measures. The hot spots for HFMD, OIDD, dysentery and Hepatitis E are located in the BTT region and Yangtze River Delta [39] . South China is located closer to the equator with a subtropical monsoon and tropical monsoon climate, which are characterized by high humidity, temperature, rainfall, and wind speed. IIDs are strongly correlated with the climatic character of south China [40] , which is a high-risk area for HFMD, OIDD, and TAP. The high-risk areas for TAP were located in southwest China (Yunnan, Guizhou, and Guangxi), which are also the most likely cluster areas and HH cluster areas. The main reasons are that southwest China borders Southeast Asia (Vietnam, Laos, and Myanmar), which has a high-risk population due to low sanitation. Moreover, the population of southwest China has a medical history of TAP and very poor climatic, geographical (Karst landform) and sanitation conditions.",

First, the study performed a comprehensive analysis of IIDs, including the temporal and spatial analyses of all reported intestinal diseases in China, to provide a complete picture of IIDs to other countries. Second, the visualization of diseases represented a convenient method to show the distribution of diseases. However, this study had some limitations. We were unable to obtain more sophisticated results for the provincial units in China than were obtained for the county unit. Regional discrepancies were also observed among provinces. Furthermore, additional studies that explore the temporal and spatial distributions in smaller region units are needed.",

Higher incidence rates of IIDs were observed from May to October, which is the season with a climate characterized by heavy rain, high temperature, and high humidity. The climate zone is associated with the incidence. The highrisk areas for IIDs were detected in part of the border region, the south region and the region with better economic development.Based on the results of our temporal and spatial analysis of IIDs, we identified the high-risk periods and cluster regions for the studied diseases. HFMD and OIDD exhibited high incidence rates, reflecting the negligence of the government in monitoring Class C diseases. At the same time, the incidence rate of Hepatitis E gradually surpassed that of Hepatitis A. The authorities should closely monitor Class C diseases and Hepatitis E. Notable epidemiological trends were observed among different provinces. An effective response requires the implementation of a series of coherent and coordinated measures, which should be specific for the diseases that are endemic to a particular area.
