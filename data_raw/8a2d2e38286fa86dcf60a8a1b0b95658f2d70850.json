A common family of such methods derives from the innovatory application of a periodic regression model on pneumonia and influenza mortality data, presented by R.E. Serfling in 1963 [5] . The general principle of this type of method is the use of long-term historical data for estimating expected values for future time-dependent upper thresholds of the relevant distribution, to which the actual observations made are subsequently compared [5, 6] . Alternative sets of statistical methods that use the same general principle, but require input of relatively few recent historical data have also been proposed, yielding favorable results [7, 8] . Such statistical methods belong to the broader classes of time-series, regression and industrial quality control methods. Cumulative sum (CUSUM) statistics of the latter class, are nowadays widely used in biomedical research [7, 8, 9] and constitute one of the components of the Early Aberration and Reporting System (EARS) that is used for syndromic surveillance by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [9] .",

Briefly, on each house visit they filled a specially designed form with data for the chief complaint of the patient, present illness, past medical and surgical history, physical examination, overall clinical assessment, likely diagnosis and management plan. They also filed the primary diagnosis into prespecified diagnostic categories (including upper or lower RTIs). As a general rule, lower RTIs were considered those affecting the respiratory tract below the level of the vocal cords. The operational characteristics of SOS Doctors including the methodology used for the collection and archiving of clinical data as well as the main characteristics of the patient population they serve have been described previously in detail [10] .

K is usually defined as the intermediate value between the in-control process mean and the out-of-control process target mean. In the context of this analysis, the in-control process is represented by the normal observations (non-epidemic), while the out-of-control process is represented by the epidemic observations. An alarm is raised by the method if the value of the CUSUM exceeds a pre-specified value h. The parameter h, measured in standard deviations, is referred to as the standardized decision value for the CUSUM and represents the threshold of the method. The selection of appropriate values for the above-mentioned parameters (k, h) for a CUSUM procedure takes into account the in-control (average run length) ARL of the in-control process [18, 19, 20] . The ARL is a measure of the time interval between false alarms, therefore it is analogous to a Type I error. In order to understand the comparability of (k, h) parameters it should be mentioned that for a fixed k value, increasing the h value would generally result in lower sensitivity and higher specificity results (and vice-versa). The same applies for k, for a fixed h value [15] . For the purposes of this study we tested two sets of values: a) (k, h) = (0.5, 5), which is a commonly used set for a CUSUM procedure [18, 19, 20, 21] , and b) (k, h) = (0.75, 1.53). The first set corresponds to an ARL of 930 weeks. For the second set of values, k was selected for the CUSUM to detect shifts of D = 2k = 1.5s, and h was calculated with respect to a specific ARL approximately representing the desired Type I error rate a = 0.10 (as in the simple regression method). Hence, this ARL was selected to be 45, roughly one tenth of the total 467 observations. The h value, given k and ARL, was computed as 1.53. As in the simple regression model described above, we assigned values for m between 4-6 (weeks).",

This is frequently the case in developing countries. As exemplified by the recent H1N1 pandemic, epidemics can emerge in areas with a relatively low level of public health surveillance [24] . The simple regression and CUSUM models we evaluated in this study appear to perform reasonably well in detecting the onset of an outbreak at week t, with the only prerequisite being the availability of prior relevant data for a non-epidemic period of only 4-6 weeks duration to be used as the comparator. The selection of the 4-6 week running period was rather arbitrary. We believe that the comparison of the index week t with a shortest period would lead to non-significant findings; a longer period might also include data from prior outbreaks which would also be inappropriate for the comparison. Data for house-call visits performed by a network of medical specialists affiliated to a private company, such as SOS Doctors in Athens, Greece, can have several advantages for use for syndromic surveillance purposes [10, 25] . The data we evaluated are ordinarily collected in a real-time manner by the private company for own purposes. Therefore, no additional costs are entailed for the collection of this type of data. House-call visits refer directly to the community, where outbreaks of viral infections first occur. Visits are done on an emergency basis, when the patient feels mostly in need for a physician, and, supposedly, clinical manifestations are more obvious. In contrast, disease surveillance data collected by visits to sentinel providers may selectively refer to patients that can go by themselves or be transferred to the ambulatory office of the providers at a time that this is feasible [25] .",

Another issue is the accessibility of the patients to other types of emergency healthcare services, which can be limited for patients with physical or mental disabilities. Depending on the operational activity of the private network of physicians, the data for house call visits can refer to a large number of patients. Minor deviations from the epidemic threshold can then be marked by statistical significance, leading to prompt detection of outbreaks and timely effectuation of the appropriate public health measures [26, 27] .

We analyzed both upper and lower RTIs, so that our findings would not be affected from bias by potential misclassifications. Still, the upper RTIs might more clearly be associated with community outbreak of viral illnesses than lower RTIs. Accordingly, the models we used for short-term recognition of community outbreaks of respiratory tract infection performed better for upper RTIs. Instead of daily values, we selected to analyze weekly-averaged values for RTIs to minimize the likelihood for high auto-correlation or variability between successive observations. We also chose to analyze the proportion of the visits for upper or lower RTIs to the total house call visits, instead of the absolute counts of RTIs, to minimize the effect of various factors, such as seasonal variation in morbidity, meteorological conditions, vacation periods, or strikes in the public healthcare sector, which could influence the demand for private house-call visits [3, 10] .",

Results for the types of statistical analysis we performed have absolute dependence on parameter input. Parameters need to be robustly calibrated in order to achieve a desired balance in the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity, keeping in mind the consequences of false alarms and the benefits of true alarms [20] . Unfortunately, optimal calibrations prove to be database-dependent. This concept applies to both the reference standard, and to the alert-generating methods application procedures. For example, decrease in specificity for the alertgenerating methods we evaluated might have resulted from earlier identification of an outbreak than the reference standard method.",

This could also constitute a shortcoming of the CUSUM methodology compared to the substantially simpler in principle simple regression methodology when executing prospective analysis. Determination of the best-fit CUSUM model for a specific data set would require the evaluation of long-term historical data which might not be available. Finally, we did not evaluate the simple regression and CUSUM models prospectively. We analyzed a large data-set of historical data as the reference standard for characterization of the outbreaks. Future studies aiming to prospectively evaluate data from house call visits for the detection of outbreaks of respiratory infections could use data from official sentinel surveillance networks, if available, as the reference standard [25] . We can only assume the performance of the models used for the detection of outbreaks after the outbreak has begun. The models might continue generating an alert for the phase of the outbreak that the number of cases steadily increases, whereas alert generation might cease once the outbreak peaks and in the phase that the number of cases decline.",

Both methods we evaluated (simple regression and CUSUM, respectively) performed reasonably well, in this regard, showing excellent sensitivity and very good specificity, when compared to a reference standard classification that used long-term historical data. A CUSUM model with a specific set of parameters appeared to be the best-fit one. The determination of the optimal set of parameters may, however, be database-specific, and it could require the evaluation of long historical time-series. Simple regression models could be elected if long-term historical data are lacking. Additional studies are needed in order to validate the performance of the above models in the prospective detection of the onset of RTI outbreaks on the basis of data for house call visits.",

For upper and lower RTIs, 83/ 467 (17.8%) and 74/467 (15.8%) of the respective observations were classified as aberrations by the reference standard procedure.

Marginally best results were obtained for the parameter selection of m = 5 weeks. As with simple regression, CUSUM methods altogether seemed to perform somewhat better for the upper RTIs compared to the lower RTIs. By comparing the simple regression and the CUSUM models on the basis of performance, the CUSUM model with m = 5 and (k, h) = (0.75, 1.53) was superior for both upper and lower RTIs. The methods computed thresholds and executed comparisons only for the subset of observations, for which the previous m-week intervals contained zero aberrant observations (as classified by the reference standard procedure). Including this rule omitted a total number of 158, 178, 195 (34.1%, 38.5%, 42.3%) possible method ''runs'' for upper RTIs and 147,164, 179 (31.7%, 35.5%, 38.8%) for lower RTIs.",
