However, the precise mechanism by which the RdRP maintains its optimal fidelity level remains largely elusive. By solving 2.1-2.5\u00c5 resolution crystal structures of the classical swine fever virus (CSFV) NS5B, an RdRP with a unique naturally fused N-terminal domain (NTD), we identified high-resolution intramolecular interactions between the NTD and the RdRP palm domain. In order to dissect possible regulatory functions of NTD, we designed mutations at residues Y471 and E472 to perturb key interactions at the NTD-RdRP interface. When crystallized, some of these NS5B interface mutants maintained the interface, while the others adopted an 'open' conformation that no longer retained the intra-molecular interactions. Data from multiple in vitro RdRP assays indicated that the perturbation of the NTD-RdRP interactions clearly reduced the fidelity level of the RNA synthesis, while the processivity of the NS5B elongation complex was not affected. Collectively, our work demonstrates an explicit and unique mode of polymerase fidelity modulation and provides a vivid example of co-evolution in multi-domain enzymes.",

Optimal fidelity levels of processive polymerase synthesis, in some cases coupled to proofreading and/or repairing processes carried out by polymerase itself or other machineries (1) (2) (3) (4) , are critical for nearly all forms of life. The RNA viruses are a large and unique group of species whose genetic information are solely carried in the form of RNA, and the related genome replication process is dependent on the virally encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) and typically not assisted by proofreading mechanisms (5, 6) . Well known as quasi-species, the RNA viruses undergo relatively rapid evolution and exist as populations bearing genome-wide distributed mutations (7) (8) (9) . It was proposed that the RNA viruses live with a narrow but optimal range of replication error frequency, as higher error rates may lead to distinction of the species and lower error rates may fail to overcome selection pressure (10) . As primary machineries that contribute to the replication error of the RNA viruses, viral RdRPs are unique systems for understanding how optimal fidelity is achieved.",

Seven catalytic motifs A-G surround the active site with A-E in the most conserved palm and F/G in the fingers (14) (15) (16) . The encirclement created by the interactions between the finger tips and thumb makes the distinction from other right-hand polymerases such as the klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I, the bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase and the human immunodeficiency virus 1 reverse transcriptase (HIV-1 RT) (17) (18) (19) . Accordingly, the fingers-thumb interactions in the RdRP may restrict large-scale fingers domain conformational changes typically seen in other polymerases (20) (21) (22) . Indeed, relative local rearrangement in the palm domain is responsible for the active site closure in viral RdRP nucleotide addition cycle (23) . This rearrangement primarily involves coordinated backbone movement of motifs A and D and key side chain rotamer changes within motifs A, B and F (23) (24) (25) (26) .",

To date, fidelity variants both in the levels of the RdRP and the full-length virus have been identified through approaches including RdRP structure-based rational mutation design and virus fidelity variant screening (28) (29) (30) (31) (32) (33) . Somewhat unexpectedly, the variation/mutation sites have been found widely distributed in the RdRP core, not limited to the aforementioned catalytic motifs or key residues known to participate in active site closure. Some of the mutations were believed to modulate fidelity through indirect interactions with or longrange transmission to the active site (34, 35) . It was suggested that the mutations in the RdRP palm domain, where the majority of the conformational changes occur during the active site closure, had greater impact on fidelity than those in the fingers domain had (31) . However, the precise mechanism by which each mutation/variation modulates fidelity and whether and how fidelity can be directionally controlled by engineering for purposes including attenuated vaccine development remain poorly understood (36, 37) .",

Compared to the RdRPs of other Flaviviridae representatives such as the NS5 of the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and dengue virus (DENV) in the Flavivirus genus and the NS5B of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) of the Hepacivirus genus, the pestivirus NS5B contains a unique \u223c90-residue N-terminal domain (NTD) that does not have notable sequence homology to any other viral or host proteins. Previous determined pestivirus NS5B crystal structures (of bovine viral diarrhea virus, or BVDV) do not include the NTD (38, 39) , and show a global architecture similar to the RdRP module of HCV NS5B and flavivirus NS5 (11, 40, 41) . A very recent work reported an NTDcontaining CSFV (Eystrup strain) NS5B crystal structure of moderate resolution (3.0\u00c5), revealing the overall fold and the intra-molecular interactions between the NTD and the RdRP module (42) . Functional studies have implied that the NTD contributes to the polymerase activity (42) (43) (44) , but the precise mechanism of how the NTD regulates polymerase catalysis remains elusive.",

Crystallographic and enzymatic characterizations of CSFV NS5B and its NTD-RdRP interface mutants further demonstrated that NTD contributed to the optimal fidelity of the RdRP, defining a unique mechanism of fidelity modulation. Likely a consequence of co-evolution of the NTD and the RdRP, the two parts of pestivirus NS5B with distinct origins have worked coordinately and created a unique mode of intra-molecular fidelity modulation.",

For radioactive labeling, [\u2423-32 P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was supplied with ATP/UTP (300 M each) for the G:U mis assays and with ATP/UTP/CTP (300 M each) for the C:U mis assays. For the G:U mis and C:U mis assays, experiments were either performed in a time course format (typically seven time points) for representative NS5B constructs or with two representative time points for all constructs. The snG:U mis assays were performed in a two-step format. In the first step, the reaction proceeded for 45 min in the presence of ATP/UTP (300 M each), the mixture was then centrifuged at 14 549 g and the supernatant was removed, and the precipitate containing the NS5B elongation complex (EC) was washed twice with a reaction buffer (20 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris (pH 7.0), 5 mM MgCl 2 , 5 mM DTT). In the second step, the UMP misincorporation reaction was conducted at 30 \u2022 C at various UTP concentrations in the range between 50 and 1600 M. Reaction was quenched at various time points. The radioactive RNA products in the G:U mis and C:U mis assays were visualized by a Cyclone Plus Storage Phosphor System (PerminElmer Life Sciences) and regular products in the snG:U mis assays were visualized by Stains-All staining. Band intensity quantification was performed using ImageJ (https://imagej.nih.gov/ij). To estimate the single-nucleotide misincorporation rate (r mis ) corresponding to the conversion from 9-mer to 10-mer in the snG:U mis assays, the values representing the fraction of 10-mer intensity (f) at all time points (t) was fitted to a single exponential rise equation: f = offset + amplitude [1 -exp(-r mis \u00d7 t)], where offset is related the portion of 10-mer contributed by minimum amount of G:U mis prior to the addition of UTP and the amplitude is related to the possibility of a 9-mer that eventually failed to extend to an 10-mer. The snG:C assays assessing the P9 to P10 conversion rate and the stability assays were performed in a two-step format as in the snG:U assays and with the first step identical to the snG:U mis assays. In the second step of the snG:C assays, the precipitate was resuspended with the regular reaction buffer or reaction buffer with NaCl concentration elevated to 200 mM. The snG:C incorporation was quenched immediate (0 min) following the manual mixing of CTP (for a final concentration of 300 M) or after 1 min. In the second step of the stability assays, the precipitate was resuspended with a high salt buffer (200/500 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris (pH 7.0), 5 mM MgCl 2 , 5 mM DTT), and incubated at 37 \u2022 C for 0 to 7 days. Following the incubation, CTP was supplied at 300 M final concentration and the reaction proceeded for 1 min at 30 \u2022 C. After subtracting the intensity of the P10 misincorporation product from the first step, the intensity fraction of P10 among the total amount of P9 and P10 ([P10 int -P10 m,int ]/[P9 int + P10 int -P10 m,int ]) was used to estimate the fraction of the NS5B EC survived the incubation.",

            "text": "In order to investigate the function of the NTD of CSFV NS5B, we first made an NS5B construct comprising residues 1-694 with only the C-terminal hydrophobic region removed. For description purpose, we herein named this construct as the wild-type (WT). This construct was soluble and capable in GG dinucleotide driven RNA synthesis using a template RNA sequence derived from the RdRP assays established in the HCV NS5B and the JEV NS5 (53,58) ( Figure 1B and C). This type of assays, although not identical to the de novo initiation assays, have been typically used to assess de novo mode RNA synthesis by viral RdRPs and are different from the assays using longer oligonucleotides as primers. Using a 30-mer RNA template (T30), we compared the RdRP activity both in the presence and absence of the dinucleotide primer (P2), and found that in the latter case the overall activity was low and sequences of the dominant products were not faithfully directed by the template sequence (Supplementary Figure S1 ). Hence, we decided to use the P2-based assays as primary approaches for the in vitro characterization of NS5B. When T30 and P2 were used to generate the T30/P2 RNA substrate, a 9-mer product (P9) was expected when ATP and UTP were provided as the only NTP substrates ( Figure 1B) . Deletion of the NTD ( Figure 1A , construct N-91) from the WT backbone did not apparently affect the P9 product level ( Figure 1C , compare lanes 2 and 3). In contrast, deletion of residue 673-694 (Figure 1A , construct C-672) in the C-terminal tail resulted in apparent reduction of product level ( Figure 1C , compare lanes 2 and 4). In order to precisely determine which region within residues 673-694 is critical for de novo synthesis, incremental C-terminal truncations ( Figure 1D , seven constructs from C-674 to C-689) were made on the WT backbone. The results indicated that residues 681-694 are not essential, as residue removal in this region did not apparently affect product level ( Figure 1D , compare lanes 7-9 to lane 6). Further truncations beyond residue 681 led to apparent reduction of product level ( Figure 1D , compare lanes 10-13 to lane 6), suggesting that the N-terminal half (residues 665-680) of the C-terminal tail is likely required for optimal de novo synthesis. Very interestingly, the removal of NTD resulted in obvious higher level of a 10-mer misincorporation product (P10 m ) ( Figure 1C , compare lanes 2 and 3), indicating that it likely plays important roles in controlling RdRP fidelity. In the following sections, crystallography and enzymology were utilized to dissect the structure and function of NTD. All NS5B constructs used in following polymerase assays A schematic diagram of the de novo-mode RdRP assays. Construct T30/P2 was used as the RNA substrate. When ATP and UTP were supplied as the only NTP substrates, the template-strand T30 directed a 7-nucleotide (grey) extension of the dinucleotide primer P2 (black) to produce a 9-mer product (P9). The 10-mer product was generated through a G:U mis event. (C and D) Comparison of the de novo RdRP activity for the WT NS5B and its N-/C-terminal truncated forms. The oval-shaped band below the 8-nt marker (M) is the bromphenol blue mixed with the marker sample. Note that the 8-nt marker was chemically synthesized and bearing hydroxyl groups at the 5 -end, and therefore migrated slower than the 9-nt product bearing a 5 -phosphate.

The structure of the WT was solved at 2.5\u00c5 resolution in space group P4 3 2 1 2 by molecular replacement using a BVDV NS5B structure comprising residues 91-672 as the search model (39) ( Table 1 ).

These three structures, each containing one NS5B molecule in the crystallographic asymmetric unit, are highly similar with root mean square deviation (RMSD) values of 0.4-0.6 A between the WT and two C-terminal truncation mutants for all superimposable \u2423-carbon atoms with 99% coverage of the resolved residues in the structure of the WT.

For some of the constructs, the tips of the ring finger (residues 257-291) and the looplike priming element insertion (residues 571-586) are disordered. The RdRP core of CSFV NS5B is structurally consistent with the BVDV structures, with an RMSD value of 1.5\u00c5 (92% coverage) between the BVDV NS5B N438 duplication mutant structure and the CSFV C-682 structure (39) . Aside from global structural difference brought by small-scale rigid body movement between the RdRP domains, the most notable difference is the conformation of the ring finger. Different from the observations in the WT BVDV (38) , full-length JEV (41), HCV (59) and the recently reported CSFV RdRP structures (42) that have a canonical fold optimal for NTP entry and binding, the CSFV NS5B ring finger bent toward the pinky finger, partially occupying the template RNA binding channel ( Figure 1F ). Although this conformation is likely not compatible with de novo initiation, normal activity of the WT and C-682 observed in the polymerase assays suggests that the canonical conformation also exist in solution and may be in equilibrium with the observed bent conformation observed in the crystal structures ( Figure 1C and D) .",

These structures together reveal that the NTD adopts a globular \u2423/\u2424 fold with an \u2423-\u2424-\u2423-\u2424-\u2424-\u2423 pattern (Figure 2) . We were not able to identify any known structural domain highly homologous to NTD using the DALI server (60) . Taking the consideration that sequence homology of NTD also has not been reported beyond pestiviruses, NTD therefore represents a highly unique viral RdRP fusion partner that may play important regulatory roles to the RdRP function. The NTD interacts with the palm of the RdRP core intra-molecularly with a mixture of hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding interactions ( Figure 3A and B) . These interactions mainly involve NTD residues 22-29 and 54-57 and the RdRP core residues 179-182 and 467-472 in the vicinity of motifs A and D, occluding \u223c1280\u00c5 2 of solvent accessible surface area ( Figure 3B ). Lying in the heart of this NTD-RdRP interface, are two adjacent RdRP residues Y471 and E472. The aromatic ring of Y471 side chain is wrapped around by NTD resides 23-27 through hydrophobic interactions and its phenyl hydroxyl group forms a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl oxygen of C25 backbone, while the carboxyl group of the E472 side chain forms two hydrogen bonds with backbone amide nitrogen atoms of residues M56 and G57 and its two-carbon aliphatic side chain region interacts with P27 and V57 through hydrophobic interactions ( Figure 3B ). The intra-molecular NTD interactions with the RdRP palm that controls the active site closure, together with the observation of the NTD deletion mutant N-91 exhibited higher level of misincorporation in the de novo RNA synthesis, suggesting a unique mode of fidelity modulation. The NTD-RdRP interface is different from the two types of the methyltransferase (MTase)-RdRP interface first identified in the NS5 of JEV and DENV serotype 3 (DENV3) that occlude relatively large surface areas (1500-1600\u00c5 2 ) (41, 61) . Firstly, the flavirus MTase interacts with the RdRP fingers domain, while the pestivirus NTD interacts with the RdRP palm. Secondly, the nature of the interface interactions is different, with the JEV-interface featuring a conserved hydrophobic core, the DENV3-interface being primarily polar, and the CSFV-interface having a mixture of interactions as mentioned above.",

Crystallization screenings were performed for all the NTD containing mutant constructs and four of them were successfully crystallized with one construct crystallized under two different conditions (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S1 ). Among these five structures, three of them (Y471A and two forms of C-672 Y471A) maintain the WT conformation with the NTD-RdRP intra-molecular interface maintained. The other two structures, obtained using the C-672 construct bearing the Y471A-E472A double mutation (C-672 AA) and the C-672 construct with the E472A single mutation (C-672 E472A), were solved in a space group different from those of the WT, C-682 and C-672 structures (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S1 ) ( Figure 3D ). Very interestingly, the C-672 AA and C-672 E472A adopt a drastically different global conformation with the NTD-RdRP interface no longer maintained (C-672 AA structure shown in Figure 3D ). The NTD-RdRP intra-molecular interactions are fully disrupted, and the NTD is rather involved in a non-intensive three-way interaction involving two symmetry-related neighboring NS5B molecules in the crystal lattice. These structural data together suggest that the selection of Y471-E472 mutation sites is valid in perturbing the NTD-RdRP interface, but the interface may not necessarily be fully disrupted by some of the mutations.",

When ATP and UTP were provided as the only NTP substrates, the 9-mer product (P9) was expected based on correct NMP incorporation. The slow accumulation of the 10-mer product (P10 m ) was derived from a G:U mis event (see Material and Methods), since providing UTP but not ATP as the only substrate to the P9-containing complex led to slow accumulation of 10mer (Supplementary Figure S2) . We therefore used molar fraction of G:U mis -derived P10 m among the total amount of P9 and P10 m (mismatch fraction) to assess the fidelity of NS5B ( Figure 4A ). In a time course reaction, WT NS5B exhibited low level of misincorporation with the mismatch fraction gradually increasing over time and reached about 0.25 at the 180-min time point. When the NTD was absent (constructs N-91 and N-91 AA) or alanine mutations were simultaneously introduced at residues 471 and 472 (construct AA), NS5B consistently exhibited higher level of misincorporation than the WT did, with mismatch fractions around 0.5 at the 180-min time point. When an alanine mutation was introduced at residue E481 that is also on the RdRP surface but does not participate in the NTD-RdRP intra-molecular interactions ( Figure 3A and C), the misincorporation level is comparable to that of the WT (Figure 4A ). 60-min and 180-min were chosen as representative time points for a comparison also including single-point alanine mutants (Y471A, E472A, and the N-91 form mutants) ( Figure 4B and Supplementary Figure S3A ). Consistent with the observation in the time course experiments, ev-ery mutant either lacking the NTD or bearing mutation(s) at residues Y471 and E472 showed much higher level of misincorporation than the WT did. The effect of E472A mutation was highly consistent with AA mutation ( Figure 4B and Supplementary Figure S3A Since polymerase misincorporation level can be affected by the type of misincorporation and the sequence context of the misincorporation site, we established the second type of regular NTP misincorporation assays using the same T30/P2 construct for a more adequate assessment of the RdRP fidelity modulation brought by the NTD. When ATP, UTP and CTP were provided as the only NTP substrates, NS5B was expected to synthesize a 10-mer product (P10) through correct NMP incorporation. A 13-mer was also observed primarily derived from a C:U mis (See Material and Methods) followed by two correct UMP incorporation events, while only a minority of the 13-mer may arise from a cytosine-directed AMP misincorporation (C:A mis ) or cytosine-directed CMP misincorporation (C:C mis ) (Figure 4C and Supplementary Figure S2C and D) . For simplicity, here we use C:U mis , the major misincorporation event, to describe these misincorporation assays. Similar to the observation in the G:U mis assays, the AA mutant exhibited much higher misincorporation level than the WT did in the time course experiments (Figure 4C ). At the 180-min time point, the AA mutant had a mismatch fraction \u223c0.7 (de- Figure 1A .",

In order to assess the misincorporation solely occurred in the elongation phase and to find out whether processivity, another key polymerase property, was affected by the NTD-RdRP interface mutations, we first needed to explicitly assess whether the P9-containg complex has entered the elongation phase. As fast catalytic rate and high stability are the two hallmarks of a polymerase elongation complex (EC), we tested P9 to P10 single nucleotide extension (corresponding to the guanosine-directed CMP incorporation, or G:C) rate and the P9-containing complex stability of the WT NS5B (Figure 5) . The single-nucleotide G:C (snG:C) assays was designed in a two-step format. In the first step ATP and UTP were supplied to generate the P9 containing complex, and CMP incorporation was initiated after the removal of the originally supplied ATP/UTP ( Figure 5A ). Immediately after the manual addition of CTP (corresponding to '0 min'), P9 to P10 conversion was complete, under two different NaCl concentrations tested ( Figure 5B, lanes 2 and 4) , suggesting that the catalytic rate of this single nucleotide addition is much faster than the P9 and P10 accumulation ob-served in the G:U mis and C:U mis assays. To test the stability of the P9-containing complex, we used NaCl and/or heparin as the challenging agent in the stability assays. When NaCl concentration was at least 100 mM, the P2-driven P9 formation with ATP/UTP was not detected (Supplementary Figure S4A and B). In contrast, the majority of the P9-containing complex survived long-time NaCl challenge at 200 mM or 500 mM concentration in the stability assays ( Figure 5C-E) . After a 1-day NaCl challenge, \u223c85% of the P9 can be rapidly converted to P10 when CTP was supplied, while after a 7-day challenge still \u223c54% of the P9 can be converted. When 100 g/ml heparin or 100 g/ml combined with 500 mM NaCl was supplied for the challenge, similar results were obtained (Supplementary Figure S4C -E). These data together suggest that the P9-containing complex is highly stable and can rapidly elongate and therefore can be considered as an EC.",

Similar to the P9 to P10 conversion assays, the snG:U mis assays was designed in a twostep format ( Figure 6A ). The UMP misincorporation reactions converting P9 to P10 m were performed at 30 \u2022 C under a series of UTP concentrations after the removal of the originally supplied ATP/UTP ( Figure 6A and B, step 2). When UTP was supplied at very high concentrations (e.g. 1200 and 1600 M), an inhibitory effect was observed for both NS5B constructs ( Figure 6C ). Therefore the misincorporation rates (rate mis ) measured under these concentrations were not used in the Michaelis-Menten curve fitting routines. The k mis value of the AA mutant is about 3.2fold of that of the WT (1.16 h \u22121 versus 0.36 h \u22121 ), while the K M app values for WT and AA mutant are very much consistent (524 M versus 513 M) ( Figure 6C ). These data together suggest that the fidelity modulation by NTD is likely not through initial NTP binding but related to sub-sequent events leading to active site closure and the phosphoryl transfer reaction. This is consistent with the structural observation that NTD interacts with the RdRP palm in the vicinity of the active site closure-modulating motifs A and D but not the motif F containing ring finger involved in NTP binding.",

            "text": "The current work unravels the functional relationship between the pestivirus NS5B NTD and its natural fusion partner RdRP. As a small and unique globular domain, the NTD is connected to the RdRP through a flexible fiveresidue linker that could allow global NS5B conformational switching leading to disengagement of NTD and RdRP, as suggested by the two crystallographic conformational states identified in this study. Very interestingly, the intramolecular interactions between the NTD and RdRP appear to have important roles in maintaining the RdRP fidelity at relatively high level. Structurally, the fidelity modulation by NTD likely achieved through its close proximity, in the closed conformation, to motifs A and D that are the only regions undergoing backbone movement during the RdRP active site closure ( Figure 3A and B) (23) . When the NTD-RdRP intra-molecular interactions were perturbed or absent, the RdRP fidelity was apparently impaired as suggested by data from all tested types of in vitro misincorporation assays. The pestivirus NS5B therefore represents a unique RdRP that may modulate its fidelity level through the interaction from a naturally fused domain. Although NTD-RdRP disengagement, a situation mimicked by the crystallographic open conformation state in a crystal lattice or the N-91 construct in solution, results in fidelity reduction, engaged NTD-RdRP with perturbation from point mutations can achieve similar level of fidelity reduction. As suggested by the two open conformation crystal structures (C-672 AA and C-672 E472A), the NTD-RdRP disengagement might occur in solution. In order to find out which conformational state is dominant in solution, we performed gel filtration chromatography and trypsin proteolysis analyses for the WT and representative mutants. In the chromatography analysis, the crystallographic open conformation C-672 AA and the C-672, or the AA mutant and the WT, had consistent retention volumes (Supplementary Figure S5A-C) . In the trypsin proteolysis analysis, the WT and AA mutant had largely consistent proteolytic profiles (Supplementary Figure S5D and E) . If compared to WT, the N-91 mutant obviously had characteristic proteolytic products, presumably related to the exposed RdRP palm surface due to the absence of the NTD (Supplementary Figure S5F ). By carefully comparing the proteolytic profiles at representative time points for all three constructs, the AA mutant also produced a few proteolytic products that either had obviously different amount from the WT or were con-sistent with the characteristic products of the N-91. These observations suggest that though the closed conformation is dominant for the AA mutant in solution, the open conformation AA mutant likely exists in solution as a minor fraction. We propose that the pestivirus NS5B achieve its optimal fidelity level through the maintenance of native NTD-RdRP intra-molecular interactions. Alteration of these interactions, either by naturally occurring or engineered mutations or through NTD interactions with viral and host factors, can result in a change in fidelity level.",

However, these studies focused on the overall de novo synthesis activities and the conclusions drawn by these studies have not been Figure 7 . Mn 2+ and the starting template sequence affected the overall synthesis activities of NS5B and the effect brought by NTD deletion. (A) Reaction flow-charts and product designations of the P2-based assays and the de novo (P2-free) assays both using T30 as the template. (B) Assessment of the impact on the NS5B synthesis by Mn 2+ and the NTD deletion. In the P2-based assays the primary product was a 10-mer mismatch product (P10 m ) instead of the 9-mer correct product (P9) when ATP and UTP were supplied and 1 mM Mn 2+ was supplemented. Longer products (solid triangle in the top left gel) likely derived from Mn 2+ -induced misincorporation were also evident. The WT and N-91 read through the template T30 (indicated by band intensity enhancement at the migration position of the template and the solid triangle in the top right gel) in the de novo assays when ATP, UTP and GTP were supplied and 1 mM Mn 2+ was supplemented. (C) The reaction flow-chart and product designations of the de novo assays using a 20-nt template (T20) with a different starting template sequence from the T30. (D) Assessment of the WT and N-91 synthesis using the T20-based assays. The WT and N-91 had very low activities under Mn 2+ -free condition if compared to data of the T30-based assays. When 1 mM Mn 2+ was supplemented, both the WT and N-91 read through (indicated by the solid triangles) the template T20 with ATP, UTP and GTP supplied. The reactions with ATP, UTP, GTP and 3 -deoxy-CTP (3dCTP) supplied were designed to largely inhibit the read-through activity and to allow a comparison of the synthesis levels of the WT and N-91 in the presence of Mn 2+ . In panels A and C, the starting trinucleotides of the T30 and T20 RNA are underlined for comparison. consistent. In a BVDV study using a 21-nt self-priming prohibited template derived from the 3 -terminal sequence of the viral minus strand RNA (starting template sequence: CAU), NS5B constructs with the N-terminal 38 and 81 residues deleted had 23% and 52% of de novo synthesis activities of the WT level with 1 mM Mn 2+ present in the assay buffer (44) . In a CSFV study using a long template derived from viral sequences (length and sequence sense not specified), NS5B constructs with the N-terminal 35 and 62 residues deleted had about 85% and 10% of the de novo synthesis activities of the WT level (62) . In the recent CSFV study reporting the NTD-containing crystal structure, a 19nt template very similar to the BVDV study (self-priming prohibited; starting template sequence: CAU) was used and an NS5B construct with the N-terminal 89 residues deleted produced 19% WT-level 19-mer products with 1 mM Mn 2+ present in the assay buffer (42) . However, a 20-mer likely arose from Mn 2+ -induced activities was the dominant product in this study. Since Mn 2+ is known to facilitate the viral RdRP initiation and misincorporation (63) and the start-ing template sequence may also affect the initiation level, we performed comparative analysis of our T30/P2-based assays, the de novo (P2-free) T30 assays, and a type of de novo assays using a 20-nt template (T20) with a different starting sequence (CUU versus CCU in T30), using either our Mn 2+ free assay condition or with 1 mM Mn 2+ supplemented (Figure 7) . In every assay type tested, the presence of Mn 2+ resulted in obviously enhanced overall activities and pronounced misincorporation activities (Figure 7 , compare lanes 2-4, 12-14, 42-45, 52-55 with lanes 5-7, 15-17, 46-49, 56-59) . For the two P2-free assays with different starting template sequence under Mn 2+ -free conditions, the overall synthesis activities were very different. While the T30-based assays had moderate amount of products (Figure 7B, lanes 12 and 32) , the product level of the T20-based assays was very low and barely detectable even under 900 mM initiating GTP concentration (Figure 7, lanes 42 and  52) . We compared the activities of the WT and the N-91 and found that the N-91 had a 54-164% of the WT-level activities, no matter which assay types were tested or whether the Mn 2+ was used. Collectively, these data confirmed that the Mn 2+ and the starting template sequence can affect both the overall activity level and the effect brought by the NTD deletion. When Mn 2+ was present, we did not observe obvious evidence of fidelity difference between the WT and the N-91. It is probable that in these assays and in the Mn 2+based assays in the literature, the fidelity effect brought by the NTD deletion identified in our P2-based Mn 2+ -free assays can be masked by the presence of Mn 2+ . Our data, in particular the data of the snG:U assays that specifically showed the fidelity modulation by the NTD-RdRP interface perturbation in the elongation phase ( Figure 6 ), provide unambiguous evidence for the linkage between the NTD and the RdRP fidelity.",

The Picornaviridae RdRP (e.g. poliovirus 3D pol ) and the HCV NS5B represent the least complicated RdRP without fused domains beyond the RdRP core (11, 12) . The pestivirus NS5B represents RdRPs that have a small-size (\u223c100 residues) fused domain, while the flavivirus RdRP (e.g. JEV NS5) and the Coronaviridae RdRP (namely nsp12) represent RdRPs that have a medium-size (\u223c300-400 residues) fused domain/region (41, 64) . The Bunyavirilaes RdRP (namely L protein) represents RdRPs that have several fused domains/functional regions (65) , while the Orthomyxoviridae RdRP complex (PA-PB1-PB2) represents RdRPs that function with intensive structural folding with other proteins (66) . The diversity in RdRP global organization and its functional coupling to its fusion/folding partner(s) likely reflect the diversity in evolutionary origin of the viruses and virus-host co-evolution. Based on the best of our knowledge, the pestivirus NTD neither has high sequence homology nor high structural homology with proteins in any other systems. However, two structural implications likely support the evolutionary relationship between the pestivirus NS5B and the flavivirus NS5. As the first implication, the structures of the RdRP NE of pestiviruses and flaviviruses are highly analogous, although the NE sequences of the two virus genera are not obviously related (41) . To date, no NE-like structures have been identified beyond these two viral genera. In amino acid sequence, pestivirus and flavivirus NEs are also similarly connecting the RdRP core and an N-terminal region: the NTD in pestivirus or the MTase in flavivirus. Although about three times the size of the pestivirus NTD, the MTase is also a single-domain module and also adopts an \u2423/\u2424 fold with a seven-strand \u2424-sheet flanked by several \u2423-helices (67). Although quite speculative, the pestiviurs NTD and the flavivirus MTase might come from the same origin and have achieved its current function through divergent evolution.",
