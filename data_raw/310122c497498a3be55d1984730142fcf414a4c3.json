It has been used for the prevention and treatment of virus-related respiratory diseases such as influenza virus infection. BLG contains some antiviral compounds, but few evidence-based clinical studies have been conducted to assess its efficacy against influenza. We assessed the effects of BLG (including efficacy and safety) on the treatment of seasonal influenza in an evidence-based clinical trial. Methods/Design: We conducted a randomized, double-blinded, oseltamivir-and placebo-controlled, parallel-design clinical trial. A total of 177 subjects are going to be recruited after satisfying the criteria: (i) 18 to 65 years of age; (ii) illness onset within 36 h; (3) axillary temperature \u226538.0\u00b0C; and (iv) positive influenza (type A/B) virus test. Subjects will be assigned randomly into three groups in equal proportions: oseltamivir treatment, BLG granule treatment, and placebo treatment. Each group receives 5-day treatment and is followed up 1, 3, 5, 7 and 21 days later. Symptoms and patient compliance are recorded, and virus/serum viral antibodies tested. We will use the primary outcome, secondary outcome, and safety indicators to evaluate the efficacy and safety of BLG granules in the treatment of seasonal influenza. Discussion: We have described the first clinical trial for treatment using a single herb against influenza A and B viruses in China. We will hold a large-scale clinical trial to comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness and safety of BLG against influenza infection based on the results of this pilot study. And this clinical trial will serve as an example for the study of other traditional herbal medicines in evidence-based clinical trials.",

Moreover, overuse of these medicines has been found to result in drug-resistant strains [8] . Up to 2003, M2-resistant variants had even spread to countries where these drugs are used infrequently [9] . Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 has demonstrated resistance to amantadine and rimantadine [10, 11] . Our previous study suggested that clinical isolates of H1N1 and H3N2 developed amantadine resistance at 93.1% and 100%, respectively, in Guangzhou, China [12] . NA inhibitors, in comparison with M2 ion channel blockers, are more commonly used but they (i) can also cause respiratory side effects and even death (for example, oseltamivir [13] ) owing to intensive use and (ii) have a higher barrier for resistance if overused. A survey from 1999 and 2007 showed a very low level (<1%) of resistance to oseltamivir [10, 14] , but a survey between 2008 and 2009 reported the resistance to be \u226590% [15] [16] [17] [18] . Resistance to zanamivir has been (albeit rarely) reported among immunodeficient patients [19, 20] . Whether such antiviral agents can be used to address influenza epidemics is not clear. Furthermore, the true effectiveness of oseltamivir treatment against influenza is controversial [21] .",

In this study, the baseline data, MITT analyses and main indicators for treatment are employed in PP analyses, but the conclusion from MITT analyses is also evaluated. When undertaking PP analyses, if there are missing data, the last observation carried forward (LOCF) approach will be adopted to complete the dataset. For laboratory data, adverse events and side effects, we will use SA analyses, and the SAP will be the denominator for the prevalence of adverse reactions.",
