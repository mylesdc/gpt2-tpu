            "text": "Honey bees (Apis mellifera) play a critical role in global food production as pollinators of numerous crops. Recently, honey bee populations in the United States, Canada, and Europe have suffered an unexplained increase in annual losses due to a phenomenon known as Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD). Epidemiological analysis of CCD is confounded by a relative dearth of bee pathogen field studies. To identify what constitutes an abnormal pathophysiological condition in a honey bee colony, it is critical to have characterized the spectrum of exogenous infectious agents in healthy hives over time. We conducted a prospective study of a large scale migratory bee keeping operation using high-frequency sampling paired with comprehensive molecular detection methods, including a custom microarray, qPCR, and ultra deep sequencing. We established seasonal incidence and abundance of known viruses, Nosema sp., Crithidia mellificae, and bacteria. Ultra deep sequence analysis further identified four novel RNA viruses, two of which were the most abundant observed components of the honey bee microbiome (,10 11 viruses per honey bee). Our results demonstrate episodic viral incidence and distinct pathogen patterns between summer and winter time-points. Peak infection of common honey bee viruses and Nosema occurred in the summer, whereas levels of the trypanosomatid Crithidia mellificae and Lake Sinai virus 2, a novel virus, peaked in January.",

Honey bees are essential pollinators of agriculturally important crops including apples, almonds, alfalfa, and citrus. Current agricultural practices, such as large-scale monocultures, demand a seasonal abundance of honey bees in geographic locations incapable of maintaining sufficient pollinator populations year-round. Migratory beekeeping operations fulfill this need. For example, each February in the Central Valley of California 1.3 million honey bee colonies (,50% of the U.S. honey bee population) are required for almond pollination [3, 4, 5] . Pollination of this and other U.S. crops is valued at ,$15 billion annually [5] .",

            "text": "Several DNA viruses that infect honey bees have also been described [19] . Viral infections in bees can remain asymptomatic, or cause deformities, paralysis and/or death [19, 20] . Symptoms associated with specific viruses include wing deformities (DWV), hairless, dark, shiny bees (CBPV), swollen yellow larva and/or dark-brown larva carcasses in the cells of worker-bees (SBV) or queen-bees (BQCV), however accurate diagnosis requires molecular biology techniques as asymptomatic bees frequently test positive for one or more viruses [19, 21, 22, 23] . In addition to viral infections, honey bees are also readily parasitized by the microsporidia Nosema [19, 24] . Historically U.S. honey bees were predominantly infected by Nosema apis, but recently Nosema ceranae infections dominate [24, 25] . The effects of Nosema infection on individual bee and colony health are unclear [24, 26] . Some reports suggest infections decrease longevity and may lead to collapse [27, 28, 29] , but since Nosema is widespread and often detected in healthy colonies its role in colony health requires further investigation [10, 26, 30] . Another fungal pathogen Ascophaera apis, the causative agent of Chalkbrood disease, kills infected larvae, but does not typically cause colony loss [31, 32] . Bacterial pathogens of honey bees include Paenibacillus larvae and Melissococcus plutonius, the causative agents of American and European Foulbrood disease [33, 34, 35, 36] . In addition to microbial infections, mite infestation (Ararapis woodi, Tropilaelaps sp., and Varroa destructor) also weakens and kills honey bee colonies [37, 38] . Introduction of V. destructor mites, which feed on the hemolymph of developing honey bees and transmit viruses (DWV, KBV, IAPV), in the late 1980s was devastating to the U.S. honey bee population [39, 40, 41] . Notably, the restricted genetic diversity of the U.S. honey bee population may make it particularly susceptible to catastrophic and episodic losses [42, 43] .",

Specifically, the APM was designed to detect virtually all known microbial parasites of insects. Endpoint PCR provided sensitive detection while qPCR documented abundance of select pathogens. Ultra deep sequencing facilitated the discovery of novel and highly divergent microbes.

This DNA microarray includes oligonucleotides representing every arthropod-infecting virus with published nucleic acid sequence in the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses database as of November 2008 [52, 53] . Design principles used for APM oligonucleotides (70-mers) were based on previous pan-viral microarrays using ArrayOligoSelector (AOS) [54] . In addition, non-viral pathogens including, Nosema (microsporidia), Crithidia (trypanosomatid), Varroa (mite), Tropilaelaps (mite) and Acarapis (tracheal mite) as well as Paenibacillus larvae and Melissococcus plutonius bacterial species [53] were represented on the microarray (Table 1 ). This new diagnostic tool is composed of 1536 oligonucleotides, including viral, non-viral and positive control targets (Table 1 ). Array analysis is performed computationally using e-predict [54, 55] . The sensitivity of the APM was estimated to be 1.9610 5 viral genome copies (1 pg Drosophila C virus in vitro transcribed genomic RNA) in an A. mellifera RNA (1 mg) background (see Materials and Methods). Array specificity was confirmed by performing pathogen-specific PCRs in conjunction with nucleic acid sequencing. Test samples included honey bees from managed and feral colonies, Vespula sp. (yellow jackets), and Bombus sp. (bumble bees) (Table S1) . A sample from a collapsed colony in Montana tested positive for the highest number of viruses (BQCV, DWV, KBV, IAPV) and documented the array's ability to simultaneously detect multiple pathogens. Analysis of symptomatic honey bees, such as hairless, shiny bees and bees with deformed wings, confirmed the presence CBPV and DWV, respectively [56, 57] . Likewise, analysis of Varroa destructor RNA validated the array's ability to detect mites and their associated viruses (DWV). Interestingly, pathogens normally associated with honey bees, DWV and ABPV, were also detected in a yellow jacket sample (Vespula sp.) obtained near a hive entrance from which the honey bees also tested positive for ABPV and DWV. We used the APM to detect several pathogens (BQCV, DWV, SBV and Nosema) in CCD-affected colony samples from an Oklahoma based migratory beekeeping operation (Feb. 2009). In total we detected and sequence confirmed ten previously characterized honey bee pathogens using the array including: CBPV, IAPV, DWV, ABPV, BQCV, SBV, KBV, Nosema apis, N. ceranae and Varroa destructor.",

APM monitoring revealed that approximately half of the colonies in April and May were Nosema positive ( Figure 2A) . Notably, nearly every colony was infected during a surge in August and September. In order to determine which Nosema species was responsible for infections, each hive was analyzed at a single timepoint per month by species specific PCR. In April and May, N.apis was predominant whereas in June, July, and October through December, N. ceranae was exclusively detected ( Figure 2B ). During the highest incidence of Nosema (August-September), 75% of all colonies were infected with Nosema ceranae and less than 25% with Nosema apis, most of which were co-infected with N. ceranae. Quantitative-PCR data from pooled monthly samples confirmed that Nosema ceranae was prevalent throughout the time-course and peaked in August ( Figure 2C ). While seasonal variation may play a role, an anti-fungal (Fumagillan) was used to abrogate Nosema infection [58] and may be responsible for the observed decrease in Nosema abundance from November to January ( Figure 2 ). Viruses. The APM readily detected common honey bee viruses in samples collected throughout the time-course. In total, we report 69 virus incidences in 63 of 431 total samples ( Figure 3 ). Overall virus incidence was sporadic, which we attribute to cycles of acute infection in predominantly healthy monitor colonies. The majority of infections occurred during July, August, and September when the monitor colonies were in South Dakota. The most prevalent virus infections observed during our 10-month study were SBV, BQCV and ABPV; however the frequencies of specific viruses were insufficient for statistical tests regarding pathogen association (see Materials and Methods). Other viruses including DWV, IAPV, and KBV were infrequently detected in the latter half of our time-course. A total of six double virus infections were observed, frequently involving ABPV or SBV. There were only two cases in which the same virus (BQCV) was detected in consecutive time points from a particular monitor colony ( Figure 3A Hives #4 and #6). Typically a single virus was detected in multiple colonies at a given time-point and these infections did not persist. For example, there were waves of SBV infection in April and January and of BQCV in July and early August ( Figure 3A ). qPCR analysis of pooled monthly samples confirmed and extended APM findings. BQCV, SBV and ABPV levels peaked in mid-summer to early fall at 6.6610 9 -8610 10 genome copies per bee ( Figure 4 and Figure S1 ), consistent with previously characterized levels of these viruses [57, 59, 60] .",

The recovered sequence aligned with 83% nucleotide and 89% amino acid identity to the canonical ALPV genome over the RdRp gene. The two viruses shared 97% nucleotide homology along 171 nt of the IRES. The high sequence similarity between this new isolate and canonical ALPV makes it unclear whether this is a novel species or a new strain of ALPV. Regardless, ALPV has not previously been reported in association with honey bees. We propose the designation ALPV strain Brookings (after the SD county from which the virus was isolated). Specific PCR primers were designed for the Brookings strain and used to analyze additional time-course samples, resulting in detections on thirty distinct occasions, including in Mississippi, South Dakota and California. Incidence peaked in May, when 7 out of 20 hives were infected, whereas maximum abundance occurred in August albeit at a relatively low level, 4.42610 4 copies per 100 ng of RNA sample (approximately 2.21610 7 copies per bee), as compared to previously characterized honey bee viruses (Figures 3 and 4) . Frequent detection of ALPV strain Brookings throughout the time-course from multiple geographic locations suggests that this virus is not simply a ''passenger'' obtained from forage (nectar and pollen) shared with other insects.

Both the individual reads and our initial contigs were further assembled and extended using the complete data set (see Materials and Methods). Two separate contig sequences (,5.5 kb each) were generated by de novo assembly. Both contigs were confirmed by specific PCR and Sanger sequencing. The first contig represents a novel RNA virus that we designate Lake Sinai virus (LSV1) (HQ871931), after Lake Sinai in Brookings County, South Dakota. The second contig also represented a related, yet divergent (71% nt identity), RNA virus which we designated Lake Sinai virus 2 (LSV2) (HQ888865). The 59 end of LSV1 was determined by RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends). The 59 end of the LSV2 assembly was within 57 nt of the LSV1 RACE results [18, 57] . The 39 ends of both viruses were refractory to traditional RACE methods and attempts at 59 RACE on the negative strand were also unsuccessful. Denaturing gel electrophoresis coupled with Northern bot analysis using three distinct LSV-specific probes indicated that only the monopartite genome and no subgenomic RNA species were present ( Figure S4 ). Both LSV genomes display similarities to the RNA1 molecule of chronic bee paralysis virus (CBPV) with predicted open reading frames (ORFs) of similar size and arrangement with the notable exception that LSV1 and 2 ORFs are contained on a single RNA rather than in the bipartite configuration of CBPV [18, 57] (Figures 5B and Figure S4 ). LSV1 and 2 possess the Orf1 gene, which is of unknown function, with predicted products (of 847 and 846 aa) previously unique to CBPV (853 aa). The Orf1 genes of LSV1 and CBPV share minimal (18%) amino acid identity. All three viruses encode an RdRp that partially overlaps and exists in a frame shift with respect to Orf1 [18] . Both LSVs possess a triple stop codon within 10 residues of the end of the Orf1 gene whereas CBPV has two adjacent stop codons. The RdRp genes are considerably more conserved with 80% identity between the two LSV strains and 25% amino acid identity between them and CBPV. Both LSV RdRp genes have the DxSRFD and SG amino acid motifs in the NTP binding pocket (residues 375-380 and 436-437 in LSV1) conserved between the families Nodaviridae,Tombusviridae and CBPV. An amino acid phylogeny of the Nodavirales superfamily RdRp places the LSV strains on the same branch as CBPV, and separated from the larger Nodavirus and Tombusvirus families ( Figure 5A ).",

We sequenced PCR amplicons from two individual (September 2009 Hive # 7 and October 2009 Hive # 10) and one pooled-monthly (December 2009) samples and determined that the phorid rRNA sequences from our time-course shared 99% similarity to honey bee-parasitizing phorids captured in San Francisco.

            "text": "Nosema infection was prevalent in our 20 monitor colonies. N. ceranae was the predominant species. N. apis was detected in individual colony samples in April (Mississippi) and May (South Dakota), but was undetectable in pooled monthly samples, indicating relatively low levels. N. ceranae abundance peaked in early-spring and late-summer. Lower N. ceranae levels from November to January likely reflects antifungal (Fumagillan) treatments applied in the fall, but may also represent natural seasonal variation [58] . In comparison, another U.S.-based (Mississippi, Arkansas) study, which calculated Nosema levels using qPCR of genomic DNA calibrated to spore counts, also reported overall dominance by N. ceranae, but higher Nosema levels in November 2008 as compared to March 2009 [79] . Nosema spore count data from non-CCD and CCD-affected colonies in California and Florida was not significantly different and approximately 50% of the colonies assayed were infected [10] . Data from European studies indicate varying prevalence of N. apis and N. ceranae [25, 29, 80, 81] . For example, a retrospective analysis of honey bee samples from Spain, Switzerland, France and Germany indicated peak levels of Nosema (presumably N. apis) in early spring and mid-winter from 1999 to 2002, whereas from 2003 to 2005 Nosema incidences remained relatively high throughout the year, a result the authors attribute to increased prominence of N. ceranae associated with recent increased bee losses [29] . In contrast, a recent (2005-2009) time-course study in Germany demonstrated greater Nosema incidence in the spring, detected N. apis more frequently than N. ceranae, and found no correlation between colony loss and Nosema infection [80] . Variable Nosema species prevalence and abundance at both the apiary and individual colony level indicate that standardized, molecular biology-based monitoring of large sample cohorts is required in order to understand the dynamics of Nosema infection, which are likely influenced by multiple factors including host genetic variation, climate, exposure levels, and treatment regimes [79, 82] . Recently, higher levels of Nosema bombi were detected in North American bumble bee species experiencing population decline [83] . Although, like CCD, the causes of bumble bee decline are complex and not fully characterized, this report underscores the importance of further characterizing the epidemiology and pathogenicity of Nosema.",

The most prevalent, previously characterized viruses in our study were BQCV, ABPV and SBV. The peak incidence of BQCV (25%) occurred in July, whereas ABPV (6.3%) and SBV (12.5%) peaked in August. Summer peak virus incidence was also reported in a PCR based honey bee virus (BQCV, ABPV, and SBV) survey of 36 geographically distributed apiaries in France (BQCV, ABPV, DWV, SBV, CBPV, KBV) [78] , a qPCR time-course study of 15 colonies in England (BQCV and ABPV) [60] , and an unpublished East-coast U.S. based survey (BQCV) [19] .

Peak incidences of these organisms in the spring and late summer are likely attributable to increased brood rearing [19, 78, 87] and foraging during these seasons [88] . Increased brood rearing during the summer, results in a greater number of bees capable of transmitting pathogens to other members of the colony living in very close proximity [19] . Honey bee viruses are transmitted vertically via infected queens and horizontally via the oral-fecal route or through the exoskeleton [19, 21] . Foraging activity also increases pathogen exposure [88] and may also stress the bees so that inapparent infections reach detectable levels. Although other sources of stress, such as transportation and poor nutrition, are hypothesized to increase pathogen levels [10] , these factors were minimal during the summer when the monitor colonies were stably situated in South Dakota foraging on diverse pollen and nectar sources, including alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), sweet clover (Melilotus spp.) and a variety of other flowering plants in June with increasing availability of corn (Zea mays ssp.) and soybean (Glycine max) pollen later in the summer. Notably, these colonies were part of a typically managed commercial beekeeping operation and therefore received nutritional supplements, protein paddies and sugar syrup throughout the year (Materials and Methods). Adequate monitor colony nutrition may have played an important role in the rapid virus clearance observed in our study. Although further experimental validation is needed, recent work examining the effects of nutrition on DWV titer in caged-bee studies demonstrated that viral titer was reduced by pollen and protein supplementation [89] . In addition, anti-mite and antimicrobial treatments in the spring and late-fall may have accounted for the lower pathogen levels at those times of year and in turn for the relatively high levels during the summer (Materials and Methods). We did not observe either increased incidence or abundance of any of the microbes and viruses monitored in our study after long distance transport.",

            "text": "Although several monitor colonies were lost (n = 3; one unfertile (drone laying) queen, two queen-less colonies) and many (n = 8) had fewer than 6 frames of bees in February 2010, none exhibited CCD characteristics and none of the numerous viruses and microbes we surveyed correlated with the weak colonies. Interestingly, our sample cohort had very few incidences of IAPV and DWV. IAPV, a virus that has received much attention due to its correlation with CCD-affected samples in an early study [9] , although not in a subsequent expanded study [10] , was detected in our monitor hives in December. The colonies in our study cleared or reduced IAPV infection to levels below detection within one week, indicative of a mild infection (Figure 3 ). IAPV infection has been shown to cause paralysis and death in mini-colony and cage studies [14, 90] , although its role in CCD is unclear [10, 91, 92] . Likewise, DWV incidence in our time-course samples was very low (0.7%) and presumably cleared rapidly. In contrast, a French timecourse documented increased DWV incidence throughout the year (spring 56%, summer 66%, autumn 85%) [78] and two U.S. studies also report high DWV incidence [19, 76] . Our results are not indicative of poor DWV detection by the array or our sampling strategy, since DWV was detected in both entrance and interior samples from other colonies. In addition, DWV-specific PCR of pooled monthly time-course samples was negative ( Figure  S3 ). Therefore negligible DWV in our monitor colonies may be attributed to low exposure and/or good colony health. A thorough one-year investigation of virus (ABPV, BQCV, DWV) and V. destructor in England found a correlation between DWV copy number and over-winter colony loss [60] . Lack of DWV in our monitor colonies is consistent with low Varroa destructor incidence, since mites are known to transmit DWV [39, 93, 94] . Low incidence of both DWV and V. destructor in our study may be partially attributed to our analysis of entrance samples, which consist of actively foraging and/or guarding adult bees. Since Varroa mites parasitize larva they are more readily detected in larva and young bee samples as well as hive bottom boards. More significantly, monitor colonies received miticide treatments in order to reduce V. destructor burden.",

            "text": "Deep sequencing analysis revealed the presence of four novel viruses (ALPV-Brookings, BSRV, LSV1 and LSV2), illustrating the power of deep short read sequencing and de novo assembly for virus discovery. Significantly, LSV2 was the most abundant single component of the honey bee microbiome in our study, and it is likely that the reason this virus has previous gone undetected is the fact that the Lake Sinai viruses are extremely divergent from all known insect viruses in both amino acid identity and genome organization. The non-structural genes of LSV are most closely related to CBPV, a known pathogen of honey bees [57] , as well as other members of the Nodavirales. However, the capsid gene and monopartite genome structure resemble tetraviruses and together position this virus closer to species such as the Providence virus, which similarly has a monopartite genome, a Nodavirales-like polymerase and a tetravirus-like capsid. Since the presence of viral nucleic acid does not necessarily indicate infection, as pollen pellets of infected and non-infected workers are known to harbor honey bee viruses [88] , we confirmed the presence of the replicative forms of LSV1 and 2 in time-course samples. The enormous magnitude of LSV throughout the time-course also suggests that these are bona fide honey bee viruses. LSV2 was the most abundant virus in our study and exhibited a unique seasonality. It is intriguing that peak LSV2 copy number per bee occurred in April (,3.6610 11 ) and January (,7.1610 11 ) since colonies typically collapse during the winter months. In contrast, LSV1 copy number peaked in July, similarly to the previously described honey bee viruses monitored in our study. Frequent detections of both ALPV-Brookings and BSRV (,15% incidence in the time-course) by PCR screen in different geographic regions argues against simple carryover from other insects during foraging, but does not rule out potential re-infection from stored pollen (bee bread) [88] . Research to determine the potential pathogenicity of these four new viruses in honey bees is underway. There are a number of previously identified honey bee viruses described on the basis of serology and electron microscopy (Bee virus X [95] , Bee virus Y [96] Arkansas bee virus [97] and Berkeley bee virus [98] for which no nucleic acid sequence information is available in public databases. Without such data we cannot preclude the possibility that these previously described viruses overlap with our novel viruses, however we were not able to gain access to any nucleic acid or serological reagent to address the question directly. Regardless, the nucleic acid sequences of the viruses reported herein are attached to publically accessible records in the form of GenBank accessions (LSV1 -HQ871931, LSV2 -HQ888865, ALPV Strain Brookings -Q871932 and BSRV -JF423195-8), such that any future viral samples may be directly compared, or if historical samples can be found and analyzed, they too can be compared.",

To date, there are only a few reports of C. mellificae infection of honey bees in the literature including early work describing the first isolation and culture of this organism in 1967 from Australian honey bees [67] . This work tested the effect of feeding C. mellificae to honey bees and demonstrated similar mortality rates in infected and uninfected bees [67] . More recently, similar trypanosomatid prevalence and loads were reported in CCD-affected colonies and healthy controls [9, 10] .

The confinement of Spiroplasma infection to a two-month window demonstrates the value of time-course sampling as opposed to single-collection screens. The development of high throughput platforms, such as the APM, will facilitate monitoring of exogenous agents in order to better understand their effect on honey bee health and survival. Our discovery and genomic characterization of four new viruses will facilitate future monitoring. Temporal characterization of these and the other microbes described herein offers a more complete view of the possible microbe-microbe and microbe-environment interactions. Further studies examining any subtle or combinatorial effects of these novel microbes are required to understand their role in colony health. Increased analysis of prospectively collected samples is essential to address the hypothesis that either one or more viruses and/or microbes cause CCD. To our knowledge, this is the first U.S. honey bee pathogen monitoring study to report both comprehensive pathogen incidence and relative abundance of specific pathogens over time. Results from our molecular analysis pipeline (APM, PCR, qPCR, ultra deep sequencing) provide a basis for future epidemiologic studies aimed at determining the causes of CCD. . Honey bees colonies were periodically supplemented with sugar syrup and protein supplement. In April (1 gallon) and October (2 gallons) bees were fed 50% (weight/volume) sucrose; in November all colonies received 3 gallons of a 1:1 mixture of high fructose corn syrup-55 (HFCS-55, 55% fructose, 42% glucose) and sucrose syrup. Additional sugar syrup was given to colonies based on colony weight (,80 lbs -3 gallons, 80-90 lbs -2 gallons., 90-100 lbs -none). This operation experienced an average 18% colony loss from November 2009 to February 2010. Colonies with younger queens (#2 years old) experienced 11% loss, whereas colonies with older queens experience 21% loss.",

Briefly, an adapter-linked random nonamer (59GTTTCCCACTGGAGGATANNNNNNNNN) was used to prime the reverse transcription reaction using SuperScript II (Invitrogen). The same oligo is used for two rounds of secondstrand synthesis with Sequenase (USB) in order to produce adapter-flanked sequences from both RNA and DNA starting material. One-quarter of the random priming reaction is used in a 50 mLTaq PCR reaction for 25 cycles with a single primer (59GTTTCCCACTGGAGGATA). One-tenth of the amplified material was further amplified for 10-20 cycles with a Cy3-linked primer (59Cy3 -GTTTCCCACTGGAGGATA). Samples were purified with the Zymo DNA Clean and Concentrator (Zymo) and resuspended in a buffer of 36 SSC, 50 mM HEPES and 0.5% SDS, and hybridized on the APM overnight at 65uC. Arrays were washed and scanned with an Axon 4000A scanner. Samples were analyzed manually and scored as positive for a pathogen if at least three unique oligonucleotides hybridized with at least five times background intensity. Arrays were further analyzed by a second unbiased method using the E-Predict algorithm [54, 55] , wherein all virus genomes were computationally hybridized to the array oligos and array results are compared to expected binding profiles. The top 5 unique oligos were removed and the algorithm reiterated twice in order to improve detection of low titer target(s) during a co-infection. Known honey bee pathogens were called positive if they exceeded a similarity score of 0.001 and were the highest ranked call in any iteration. In the event of a disagreement between the two analysis methods, a specific PCR reaction was performed, using material from the first PCR step, to resolve the call.",

Equivalent amounts of RNA (10 mg) from each hive sample (monitor hives [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] were pooled according to the month in which they were collected (April 2009 to January 2010). Pooled RNA was further purified using Qiagen RNAeasy columns, including on column DNase Treatment (Qiagen). cDNA synthesis reactions were performed with SuperScriptIII (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's instructions. In brief, RNA from each pooled sample (5 mg), random hexamer (1.25 mg) and dNTPs (0.5 mM each) were combined in a 50 mL reaction volume, incubated at 65uC (5 min), cooled on ice (1 min) and subsequently combined with 50 mL of 26 First-Strand Buffer containing SSIII (1000 U), DTT (5 mM), and RNaseOUT (200 U). Reverse transcription reactions were incubated for 12 hours at 42uC followed by inactivation of the reaction (70uC, 15 min). qPCR was performed in triplicate wells using 2 mL of cDNA as template in 20 ml reactions composed of HotStartTaq 26 Mastermix (Denville), 16 SYBR Green (Invitrogen), MgCl 2 (3 mM), and forward and reverse primers (600 nM each) (Table S2 ) on a LightCycler480 (Roche). The qPCR thermo-profile consisted of a single preincubation 95uC (10 min), 35 cycles of 95uC (30 s), 60uC (30 s), and 72uC (30 s). No RT control reactions using pooled RNA as the template for qPCR were performed in triplicate on each plate. Target qPCR amplicons were cloned into pGEM-T (Promega) or TOPO CR 2.1 (Invitrogen) vectors and sequence verified. Plasmid standards, containing from 10 9 to 10 2 copies per reaction, were used as qPCR templates to assess primer efficiency and generate the pathogen-specific standard curves used to quantify the viral genome or rRNA copy number. The linear standard equations generated by plotting the crossing point (Cp) versus the log 10 of the initial plasmid copy number for each primer set were as follows: (Figure 4 ). Values obtained from the no RT control reactions, all below the detection limit of the assays, were subtracted from the total pathogen copy number for each month. An estimate of the number of viral genomes per bee can be obtained by multiplying the reported qPCR copy number values by 500. This estimate is based on the following: typical RNA yield was approximately 50 mg per bee, each qPCR reaction was performed on cDNA generated from 100 ng RNA, therefore each well represents 1/500 th of an individual bee. We choose to represent the raw data, since each monthly-pooled sample was composed of variable bee numbers due to differential sampling frequency each month. In addition, qPCR with a host primer set, Apis m. Rpl8, was performed using 1 mL cDNA template on each qPCR plate to ensure consistency and cDNA quality. qPCR products were analyzed by melting point analysis and 2% agarose gel electrophoresis ( Figure S1 ).",

PCR was performed using 2 mL of exonuclease I treated cDNA template in 25 ml reactions containing 10 pmol each of a tag-specific forward primer (TAGS) and an LSV-specific reverse primer using the following cycling conditions: 95uC for 5 min; 95uC for 30 s, 58uC for 30 s, 72uC for 30 s, 35 cycles; final elongation 72uC for 4 min, hold at 4uC. In addition to amplification and detection of the LSV replicative form using tagged-negative strand primed cDNA template and TAGS forward and LSVU-R1717 PCR primers, negative and positive controls were performed ( Figure S5 -labeled (1) ). Negative controls included utilizing unprimed RT reaction as a template for PCR amplification using TAGS forward and LSVU-R1717 primers (labeled (2)), LSV tagged negative-strand primed cDNA template in PCR reaction in which only the LSVU-R1717 primer was added in order to ensure that all of the unincorporated RT primer was digested with exonuclease I and thus not involved in priming the PCR reaction (labeled (5)), and no template PCR using LSV qPCR primer sets (labeled (6)). Positive controls included using random hexamer primed cDNA as template for PCR amplification using LSV1 or LSV2 -specific forward primer and LSVU-R-1717 (labeled (3)) and random hexamer primed cDNA amplified using LSV-specific qPCR primer sets (labeled (6)). PCR products were analyzed using agarose (2%) gel electrophoresis ( Figure S5 ).",

The remaining nucleic acid was treated with Turbo DNase (Ambion) and column purified (Zymo) before being split into thirds. One third was enriched for mRNAs with dT-linked Dynabeads (Invitrogen). RNA from this fraction and from a second unenriched fraction were primed for RT and secondstrand synthesis with an adapter linked oligo as above using oligo SolCommonN (59CGCTCTTCCGATCTNNNNNN). The third fraction of RNA was primed with an anchored oligo dT and subjected to two rounds of second strand synthesis with SolCommonN. Half of the initial material was amplified with primer SolCommon (59CGCTCTTCCGATCT) with KlenTaq (Sigma) at an annealing temperature of 37uC for 20 cycles.
