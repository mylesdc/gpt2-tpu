            "text": "Newcastle disease virus (NDV) causes severe infectious disease in poultry and selectively kills tumor cells, by inducing apoptosis and cytokines secretion. In this report, we study the mechanisms underlying NDV-induced apoptosis by investigating the unfolded protein response (UPR). We found that NDV infection activated all three branches of the UPR signaling (PERK-eIF2\u03b1, ATF6, and IRE1\u03b1) and triggered apoptosis, in avian cells (DF-1 and CEF) and in various human cancer cell types (HeLa, Cal27, HN13, A549, H1299, Huh7, and HepG2). Interestingly, the suppression of either apoptosis or UPR led to impaired NDV proliferation. Meanwhile, the inhibition of UPR by 4-PBA protected cells from NDV-induced apoptosis. Further study revealed that activation of PERK-eIF2\u03b1 induced the expression of transcription factor CHOP, which subsequently promoted apoptosis by downregulating BCL-2/MCL-1, promoting JNK signaling and suppressing AKT signaling. In parallel, IRE1\u03b1 mediated the splicing of XBP1 mRNA and resulted in the translation and nuclear translocation of XBP1s, thereby promoting the transcription of ER chaperones and components of ERassociated degradation (ERAD). Furthermore, IRE1\u03b1 promoted apoptosis and cytokines secretion via the activation of JNK signaling. Knock down and overexpression studies showed that CHOP, IRE1\u03b1, XBP1, and JNK supported efficient virus proliferation. Our study demonstrates that the induction of eIF2\u03b1-CHOP-BCL-2/JNK and IRE1\u03b1-XBP1/JNK signaling cascades promote apoptosis and cytokines secretion, and these signaling cascades support NDV proliferation.",

            "text": "The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) plays an important role in regulating protein synthesis/processing, lipid synthesis, and calcium homeostasis 1 . During virus infection, many viral proteins are synthesized by ER-associated ribosome and transported into the ER lumen for proper folding or posttranslational modification. This leads to an overwhelming load of unfolded or misfolded proteins in the ER lumen. The chaperone Bip then binds to these unfolded/misfolded proteins and releases the ER stress sensors PERK, ATF6, and IRE1\u03b1, triggering unfolded protein response (UPR). PERK is activated by autophosphorylation and in turn phosphorylates eIF2\u03b1 on Ser51 2,3 . Phospho-eIF2\u03b1 has increased affinity to the eIF2\u03b2 subunit and prevents the regeneration of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) in the ternary complex eIF2-GTP-Met tRNAi, thus halting the initiation of protein translation 4 . However, ATF4 mRNA is preferentially translated and promotes the transcription of genes important for cellular remediation or apoptosis, including CHOP 5 . Another eIF2\u03b1 kinase, PKR, also elicits eIF2\u03b1-ATF4-CHOP signaling in response to virus infection [6] [7] [8] . ATF6 dissociates from Bip and moves to the Golgi apparatus, where it is cleaved into N-terminal fragment ATF6-N and subsequently translocated to the nucleus as an active transcription factor, triggering the transcription of protein chaperones and components of ER-associated degradation (ERAD) [9] [10] [11] . The IRE1\u03b1-XBP1 branch is the most evolutionarily conserved in Eukarya 12 . After dissociating from Bip, IRE1\u03b1 undergoes homooligomerization and autophosphorylation, obtaining both kinase and endoribonuclease activity 13 . This endoribonuclease leads to unconventional enzymatic splicing of XBP1u mRNA into XBP1s by removing the 26-nucleotide intron. The spliced mRNA is then translated into transcription factor XBP1s, controlling the expression of the ER quality control genes and components of ERAD 11, [13] [14] [15] . IRE1\u03b1 also degrades ER-associated mRNAs to attenuate protein load in the ER lumen 16 .",

            "text": "If ER homeostasis cannot be restored, UPR drives the damaged or infected cells to apoptosis 17 . Apoptosis is triggered by either intrinsic signaling or extrinsic death ligands. The intrinsic pathway is under the control of the BCL-2 protein family 18 . Pro-survival guardian proteins (BCL-2, MCL-1, and BCL-xL) inhibit apoptosis through binding and sequestering pro-apoptotic activators (BID, BIM, PUMA, and NOXA) or effectors (BAX and BAK). When enough activators have been stimulated by cytotoxic stresses, BAX is released from pro-survival guardian proteins and oligomerizes to form pores on the mitochondrial outer membrane, thereby releasing cytochrome c and activating caspase 9 [19] [20] [21] . Under persistent ER stress, the induction of CHOP may promote cell apoptosis by regulating the expression of BCL-2, TRB3, death receptor 5, ERO1\u03b1, and GADD34, and perturbing the cellular redox state [22] [23] [24] . IRE1\u03b1 may promote apoptosis through interacting with TRAF2 and ASK1, in turn activating pro-apoptotic JNK 25 . Prolonged UPR is also an inflammatory nidus and may elicit a defensive innate immune response against the invading pathogen. Activation of IRE1\u03b1-JNK leads to the increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines 26 . NF-\u043aB is activated by IRE1\u03b1-TRAF2 mediated I\u03baB phosphorylation and degradation 27 . In another way, when protein translation is halted by PERK-eIF2\u03b1 signaling, the ratio of NF-\u043aB to I\u043aB is increased, and NF-\u043aB is then released and activated 28, 29 .",

These infected cells were then subjected to apoptosis analysis. The noncancerous human embryonic kidney cells, 293T, were infected as a control cell type. Due to space limitations, we presented the results from HeLa cells in Figs. 1-8 and the results for other cell lines in supplementary figures. As expected, at 20 h.p.i., increased number of TUNEL positive cells was observed in HeLa (Fig. 1a) , as well as in CEF, DF-1, Cal27, HN13, A549, H1299, Huh7, and HepG2 cells (Fig. S1A ); only few TUNEL positive cells were observed in 293T cells (Fig. S1A) . Annexin V/PI staining confirmed that NDV indeed induced functional apoptosis in chicken and human cancer cells, but not in 293T cells (Fig. 1b, Fig.  S1B ). Immunoblotting showed that in HeLa, Cal27, HN13, A549, and H1299 cells, both major biochemical markers of apoptosis, caspase-3 and PARP, were cleaved into smaller fragments in an infection time-dependent manner; in Huh7 and HepG2 cells, weak cleavage of PARP appeared at 24 h.p.i.; no cleavage of both biochemical markers was observed in 293T cells ( Fig. 1c and  Fig. S1C ). Due to unavailabilbty antibodies, chicken cells were not included in the immunoblotting analysis. These observations suggest that NDV infection triggers functional apoptosis in chicken cells and many human cancer cell types, but not in non-cancerous 293T cells.",

            "text": "We next set up to adress if the UPR is involved in NDVinduced apoptosis. First, we examined the three branches of UPR in NDV-infected cells. As shown in Fig. 2a and Fig. S2 , at late infection time points. Interestingly, the fulllength PERK (PERK-FL) was cleaved into a 110-kDa Nterminal fragment (PERK-N) in HeLa, Cal27, HN13, A549, and H1299, but not in Huh7, HepG2, and 293T cells. The cleavage site of PERK was mapped to Thr980 (data not shown). In the mock-infected group, there was basal level of phospho-PERK, probably due to the removal of serum in the culture medium ( Fig. 2a and Fig. S2 ). The phospho-PERK was clear observed in NDVinfected Hela cells at 16 and 20 h.p.i. (Fig. 2a) , however, in other cancer cell lines, the level of phospho-PERK in NDV-infected cells was lower than or comparable to that in mock-infected cells, probably due to the cleavage of PERK-FL or other unknown mechanisms (Fig. S2) . Meanwhile, phospho-eIF2\u03b1 was gradually increased at late infection time points in HeLa cells (Fig. 2a) , and in HN13, A549, Huh7, HepG2, and 293T cells (Fig. S2) . The failure to observe the increase of phospho-eIF2\u03b1 in NDVinfected Cal27 and H1299 cells might be attributed to the high basal level of phospho-eIF2\u03b1 in mock-infected cells. These results demonstrate that NDV infection induces the phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 in various cancer cells; however, the cleavage of PERK may attenuate the activation of PERK-eIF2\u03b1 branch. Meanwhile, NDV infection greatly stimulated the phosphorylation of IRE1\u03b1 in HeLa (Fig. 2a) , Cal27, HN13, A549, H1299, Huh7, and HepG2 cells, but not in 293T cells (Fig. S2) . The level of full-length ATF6 (ATF6-FL) was gradually decreased at late infection time in HeLa (Fig. 2a) , Cal27, A549, H1299, Huh7, and 293T, but not in HN13 and HepG2 (Fig. S2 ). Although we failed to detect the cleavage band of ATF6, the nuclear translocation of ATF6 was indeed observed in NDVinfected HeLa cells (Fig. 2b) . These results demonstrate that NDV infection triggers the eIF2\u03b1, IRE1\u03b1, and ATF6 signaling in most cancer cell types studies. We next evaluated the role of UPR in apoptosis and virus proliferation, by utilizing a chemical chaperone 4-PBA to attenuate ER stress 39 . In HeLa cells receiving both 4-PBA and NDV, the level of phospho-eIF2\u03b1 was reduced by 0.7-fold; interestingly, both phospho-IRE1\u03b1 and total IRE1\u03b1 were increased, whereas the cleavage of ATF6-FL was not affected, compared to those cells receiving NDV only (Fig. 2c) . Thus, 4-PBA only suppressed the phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 in NDV-infected cells. Further study showed that 4-PBA treatment decreased the cleavage of PARP and produced less TUNNEL positive cells (Fig. 2c,  d) , accompany with lower expression of NP and less release of progeny virus (Fig. 2e) . Thus, alleviation of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation by 4-PBA may protect cells from death and is not favorable for virus proliferation.",

The expression of XBP1s was also detected in NDV-infected Cal27, HN12, A549, H1299, Huh7, HepG2, and 293T cells (Fig. S2) . Immunofluorescence showed that XBP1 was translocated to the nucleus in response to NDV infection (Fig. 6c) .

The intensities of XBP1s, PARP-C, NP bands were determined, shown as fold change of 4\u00b58c (+:\u2212). e, f IRE1\u03b1 mediates XBP1 splicing. HeLa cells were transfected with sic or siIRE1\u03b1 for 36 h (e), or transfected with plasmid pCMV or pCMV-IRE1\u03b1 for 24 h (f), followed with NDV infection. The cells were harvested at 20 h.p.i. and analyzed with western blot by using XBP1 antibody. The intensities of XBP1s bands were determined and normalized to \u03b2-actin, and shown as fold change of siIRE1\u03b1:sic, or IRE1\u03b1:pCMV. Results are representative of three independent experiments. UPR or apoptosis is not favorable for efficient NDV proliferation. Indeed, to facilitate shedding and dissemination of progeny viruses, some viruses take advantage by initiating apoptosis 49 . Apoptosis may help NDV release by killing the infected cells, promote virus spread to neighbor cells by avoiding stimulation of anti-viral innate immune responses or inflammation in un-infected neighbor cells, thereby quickly establishing acute infection.",

            "text": "The full understanding of the involvement of these UPR branches in NDV replication process appears to be complicated. In addition to helping NDV spread to neighbor cells by triggering apoptosis, the global translation shut off caused by PERK/PKR-eIF2\u03b1 signaling may allow the translational machinery hacked by virus and translate the viral proteins preferentially. Alternatively, the expression of ER quality control proteins, which are controlled by IRE1\u03b1-XBP1 pathway, promotes virus replication by enhancing the viral proteins modification, folding, and trafficking. Another possibility is that XBP1s stimulates the phospholipid biosynthesis and ER expansion 64 , providing the lipid that is necessary for the enveloped virus particle assembly. Activation of JNK by UPR not only contributes to apoptosis, but also initiates inflammation by promoting the transcription of cytokines. The secretion of cytokines may attract the phagocyte to engulf the infected-apoptotic cells. In all, this study provides comprehensive insights into the mechanisms of UPR induced apoptosis and cytokinesecretion during NDV infection. Fig. 6e , f were analyzed with western blot to check the phospho-JNK and JNK.
