For non-vvIBDV lineage, a decrease in Ne\u03c4 from its emergence to early '80s was observed, with a subsequent maintenance in the Ne\u03c4, suggesting stability in the diversity of this population. On the contrary, an abrupt increase in Ne\u03c4 from the emergence of vvIBDV lineage (approximately in 1986) to 1993 was observed (Fig 5) , which proves an epidemic behaviour of this viral population during this period. Subsequently, a mild increase in Ne\u03c4 was observed until year 2001 followed by a maintenance until 2011, suggesting a stability in diversity of this population.

The polygenic nature of IBDV pathogenicity, in particular the clear role of both segments (A and B) in vvIBDV's pathogenesis [17, 58] , has shown that the characterization of IBDV strains based on both genome segments is essential to understand the epidemiological behavior of this viral agent. Nonetheless, the complete sequencing of both segments is impractical in routine practice in diagnostic laboratories. In addition, utilizing the full genome for molecular epidemiology studies would result in costly computational analyses, which would be also unfeasible [59] . Evaluation of a Phylogenetic Marker Based on Genomic Segment B of IBDV Therefore, the use of phylogenetic markers for molecular epidemiology studies of IBDV is a useful and needful approach. In the present study, a novel phylogenetic marker (B-marker) included into segment B of IBDV's genome is proposed. The initial selection of B-marker was based on two main aspects: length of the fragment and location. Being the B-marker less than 500bp (430bp) of length, this fragment can be easily obtained and sequenced in laboratories with limited resources. Likewise, the size of the B-marker facilitates the computational analyses, avoiding delayed results generated by large size fragments (Reviewed in: [24] ). In addition, B-marker is framed between Nterminal domain and partial F domain of VP1 [30] . The N-terminal domain of IBDV VP1 folds into a mixed \u03b1/\u03b2 structure. This domain has been associated with the protein priming process and interacts with the fingers and thumb domains [60] . The F domain has been linked to the nucleotide recognition and binding process as well as to the RNA template binding mechanism [30] . Other domains such as domain D, starting from residue 252 (end of B-marker) are involved in structural integrity, and C-terminal domain is highly conserved not only among IBDV strains but also for all members of Birnaviridae family [30] . Thus, the structural domains in which B-marker is framed have a functional role in VP1 more than structural constrains; therefore, this region could be more influenced by evolutionary changes than possible negative selective restrictions. The reliability of this B-marker to conduct feasible molecular epidemiology studies involving both genome segments of IBDV was also evaluated. Furthermore, the global phylodynamic of the IBDV strains was studied based on the consistency of the results obtained for this Bmarker. In this context, the genetic diversity of the Cuban IBDV strains was also analyzed. Besides, the current work revealed the presence of a novel IBDV natural reassortant between segment A from vvIBDV strains and segment B from non-vvIBDV strains in Cuban IBDV population.",

When a dataset is saturated, phylogenetic reconstruction may be misled by homoplasious signal [23] , which is evidenced by no further increase in transitions observed despite increasing genetic distance, indicating that multiple substitutions at nucleotide positions have occurred. The gradual increase of transitions/transversions observed with respect to genetic distance for B-marker suggests a lack of saturation for this selected region. Correspondingly, Xia's test supported the same outcome. Xia's test is based on the ratio of observed entropy to the entropy of full substitution saturation defined as the index of substitution saturation (I SS ). If this value is not significantly smaller than the critical I SS (I SSC ) (value at which the sequences start to fail to recover the correct tree), the sequences have experienced severe substitution saturation and should not be used for phylogenetic reconstruction [23] . From the results obtained for B-marker we can infer that this region does not experience substitution saturation and can be used for phylogenetic studies.",

Taking into account that most commercially available conventional live IBDV vaccines are based on classical virulent strains (Reviewed in [69] ), the use of vaccine strains with similar genetic background to the field strains could have subjected IBDV's population to repeated bottleneck effects leading to a loss of fitness through a process of natural selection [70, 71] .",

Thus, IBDV strains with this new genetic background had the possibility to express the potential advantages of their large quasispecies cloud making expedite their establishment and spreading around the world, especially during the first years of their emergence. The maintenance in genetic diversity of segment B for this lineage, suggesting stability in diversity of this population during 2001-2011, could be associated to the application of more strict control measures for these emergent strains during this period. In fact, novel vaccines were developed to be more effective against vvIBDV strains, such as subunit vaccines, genetically engineered live IBDV vaccines, DNA vaccines and others [69] . However, different factors including reversion to virulence of the vaccine strains [69] , non-sufficient induction of protective immune response [72] as well the intrinsic property of IBDV to evolve quickly, have made the task of controlling IBD by vaccination even more challenging.",

Thenceforth, vvIBDV strains have been kept antigenically and genetically homogeneous, spreading to most of the countries (with the exception of Australia) at least for two decades. However, the recent isolation of vvIBDV strains with rare natural segment-B-reassorted [25, 26] have evidenced a possible change in the genetic structure and stability of vvIBDV strains. Thereby, Ingrao et al. [73] suggested that it is probably only a matter of time until vvIBDVs are replaced by an emerging strain with new antigenic or pathotypic properties. In fact, He et al.

On the other hand, the application of different types of vaccines that did not fully protect chickens against infection by vvIBDV strains could have induced a \"selective noise\" with greater chance for beneficial mutations to accumulate. This \"selective noise\" allows occasional slips from the first lightest mutational loads (originated by the immune response of the host induced by the vaccination) towards an increase of the weight of mutational loads (given by the quasispecies cloud) (Reviewed in [76] ) with a consequent increase in the substitution rate.",

Therefore, comparisons of amino acid replacements based on this pattern were performed among all Cuban sequences included in the present work (S2 Fig). Thus, the pattern of the triplet amino acids TDN (145-147) present in vvIBDV strains was found in the Cuban field strains BF26Hab97, 61/98Hab98, 69/98Hab98, 135/00Hol100, BF11Hab00, 45/02Hab02, BF29Hab04, BF31Hab04, BF14Cie08, BF16Hab08, BF19Hab09, BF24Hab11 and BF25Hab11 (S2 Fig). The pattern of the triplet amino acids NEG (145-147) present in non-vvIBDV strains was found in the Cuban vaccine strain and the field strain 117/96Pir (S2 Fig). The field strain BF3Hab97 showed a unique pattern SDS (145-147) for this triplet amino acids (S2 Fig). Regarding amino acid of position 242, the Cuban field strains BF3Hab97, BF26Hab97, 61/98Hab98, 69/98Hab98, 135/00Hol100, BF11Hab00, 45/ 02Hab02, BF29Hab04, BF31Hab04, BF14Cie08, BF16Hab08, BF19Hab09 and BF25Hab11 showed the signature 242E present in vvIBDV strains (S2 Fig), while the Cuban vaccine strain and the field strains 117/96Pir and BF24Hab11 showed the signature 242D present in non-vvIBDV strains (S2 Fig).",
