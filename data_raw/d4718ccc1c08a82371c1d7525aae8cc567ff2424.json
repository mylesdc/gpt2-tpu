Chinese microblogs in 2012 regarding 42 infectious diseases were obtained through a keyword search in the Weiboscope database. Qualitative content analysis was performed for the posts pertinent to each keyword of the day of the year with the highest daily count. Similar posts were grouped and coded. We identified five categories of information that increased microblog traffic pertaining to infectious diseases: news of an outbreak or a case; health education / information; alternative health information / Traditional Chinese Medicine; commercial advertisement / entertainment; and social issues. News unrelated to the specified infectious diseases also led to elevated microblog traffic. Our study showcases the diverse contexts from which increased social media traffic occur. Our results will facilitate better health communication as causes underlying increased social media traffic are revealed.",

Weibo users discuss a variety of social issues, including post-disaster management and politics [17, 18, 19] . The Chinese health authorities also use Weibo as a communication tool [20] . Recently, scientists began analyzing Weibo data in light of its implications in public health. For example, Weibo users' reactions to a self-presented suicide attempt [21] and to the outbreaks of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and avian influenza A(H7N9) merited our attention [22] .

Initially, a list of about 350,000 indexed microbloggers was generated by systematically searching the Sina Weibo user population using the Sina Weibo Application Programming Interface (API) (Fig 1) . The users were selected based on an inclusion criterion of having 1,000 followers or more when the project began data collection in 2011. The rationale for our high-follower-count samples was two-fold. First, social media users with high follower count are more influential than those with fewer followers and usually attract disproportionately large public attention [15] . Second, this criterion can exclude the spam accounts that are very common among Chinese social media [26] .",

We then obtained a time series of aggregated daily counts of Weibo posts containing a specified keyword for each disease. We selected the day of the year with the largest number of posts pertinent to each disease and, using an online platform that we developed, obtained the content of the Chinese posts that were generated on that day. If there were two peaks of equal magnitude, we obtained the content of both. We obtained the microblog content of the whole year of 2012 for typhus (n = 14) and leishmaniasis (n = 24), given their small numbers. Three co-authors manually read the retrieved microblog content, grouped them by topics (e.g. sharing the same piece of news), performed preliminary coding, and counted them. A representative post was selected for each group. They manually searched online and identified the relevant news, events or information that triggered the elevated microblog traffic. Afterwards, the first author manually performed quality check by selecting the microblog posts of about one-third of the list of diseases and performed the grouping himself. He revised the groupings if necessary. He reviewed all the groupings and preliminary coding of the microblog contents and their representative posts, for emerging themes to develop the following coding scheme.

One example was a petition to end discrimination against hepatitis B virus (HBV) carriers, addressed to the Chinese People's Congress and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (Fig 2; Table 3 ). A civil rights advocate who was also an HBV carrier used Weibo to contact delegates and asked if they would submit the proposal on behalf of the China's 100 million HBV carriers (see S1 File for details).",

We identified 5 categories, namely, news of an outbreak or a case, health education / information, alternative health information (or Traditional Chinese Medicine), commercial advertisement / entertainment, and social issues. Identification of these categories of triggers for Chinese microbloggers' responses is important for digital health communications in two ways. First, digital epidemiologists use time series of search query data or social media data to predict trends of infectious diseases, such as influenza [5, 32] . These prediction analyses rely on keywords or their combinations to identify the relevant search query data or Twitter tweets. The underlying assumption is that an increase in disease incidence would motivate people to search online for health information or to share their experiences online via social media. Content analysis of social media posts enables researchers to go beyond keyword to fully understand the contents of the posts and the contexts from which they were generated. Our analysis highlights the fact that social media trends of disease-specific keywords could reflect people's online reaction to a variety of events and information, of which many are not related to any actual outbreak. Our study paves the way for future studies that can investigate the predictive value of similar news, events or information.",

Examples such as the news of an alleged cover-up of a hepatitis C outbreak or the conflict associated with testing for sexually transmitted diseases, leading to the peaks of microblog posts that we observed, revealed a mistrust of government institutions and the medical profession at large.

Furthermore, our dataset is comprised of the 350,000 users who had 1,000 followers or more. Of these 350,000 users, 5000 were Chinese dissident writers, journalists and scholars, and another 38,000 were users with an authenticated (also known as VIP) status with more than 10,000 followers, as discussed in the original study [18] . While our sample constituted less than 1% of all registered users of Sina Weibo, this sampling strategy allowed us to avoid many spam accounts [15] . The Weibo universe is highly heterogeneous. A random sampling study found that over 50% of Sina Weibo users have never posted anything, whereas 80% of the original posts were created by 5% of the users [15] . Hence, our sample represents the most influential Chinese microbloggers who contributed a majority of Weibo contents and drew the most attention as far as reposts and comments were concerned [15] . Nonetheless, our findings may not be generalizable to samples obtained through other sampling strategies.
