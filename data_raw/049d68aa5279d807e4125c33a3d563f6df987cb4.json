To evaluate the roles of inflammatory mediators in acute exacerbation, the concentrations of high mobility group protein B1 (HMGB1), a chief mediator of acute lung injury, and 18 inflammatory cytokines were measured in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, serially sampled from seven IPF patients after the onset of acute exacerbation. HMGB1 gradually increased in the alveolar fluid after the onset of acute exacerbation, in positive correlation with monocytes chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), a potent fibrogenic mediator. In the lung tissues of eight IPF patients autopsied after acute exacerbation, intense cytoplasmic staining for HMGB1 was observed in the alveolar epithelial cells in alveolar capillary augmented lesions, where the capillary endothelial cells remarkably reduced the expression of thrombomodulin, an intrinsic antagonist of HMGB1. These results suggest pathogenic roles for HMGB1 and MCP-1 in the late phase of acute exacerbation of IPF.",

In the pathologic findings in the lungs of IPF patients afflicted with acute exacerbation, diffuse alveolar damage, which is consistent with the findings observed after acute lung injury from various causes [2] , is the most characteristic underlying usual interstitial pneumonia.

HMGB1 is released passively during cellular necrosis by almost all cells which have a nucleus and signals to neighboring cells in the case of ongoing damage [5] . However, HMGB1 also is secreted actively by immune cells such as monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells [4, 10, 11] . The receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) was the first receptor demonstrated to bind HMGB1 [12] , and HMGB1 signaling through RAGE was found to promote chemotaxis and the production of cytokines in a process that involves the activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) [13, 14] . Nevertheless, the contribution of HMGB1 in the pathogenesis of acute exacerbation of IPF has not been determined yet.",

The alveolar capillaries were decreased in fibrotic lesions, but increased in nonfibrotic alveolar septa around the fibrotic lesions, where VEGF and IL-8, potent angiogenic factors, were augmented [15] . Since VEGF is also a potent inducer of vascular permeability [16] , these capillary dense lesions in nonfibrotic alveolar septa are considered to be leaky, and thus susceptible to the alveolar infiltration triggered by inflammatory mediators in acute lung injury [17] . We are also interested in thrombomodulin, an endothelial anticoagulant cofactor, which is highly expressed in alveolar capillaries in normal control lungs but less so in IPF lungs [15] . This is because the N-terminal domain of thrombomodulin binds HMGB1 so as to prevent its interaction with RAGE and thus suppresses the induction of proinflammatory events [18] .",

            "text": "This is the first report of a persistent elevation of HMGB1 and MCP-1 after the onset of acute exacerbation in the lungs of patients with IPF. Both of these mediators were produced by alveolar macrophages and alveolar type II epithelial cells distributed in the capillary-increased alveolar lesions in which the capillary endothelial cells exhibited reduced expression of thrombomodulin, an intrinsic antagonist of HMGB1 [18] . The gradual increase of HMGB1 in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid after the onset of acute exacerbation suggests several plausible roles in the pathogenesis of acute exacerbation of IPF. One of the roles of HMGB1 is as a late mediator of acute exacerbation, because the concentration of HMGB1 was low at the initial onset of acute exacerbation. Although no virulent organisms or viruses were detected in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluids examined in this study, all of these patients had flu-like symptoms a few days before the onset of acute exacerbation, which can cause a triggerlike effect of fulminating inflammation similar to acute lung injury. The gradual increase of HMGB1 in the epithelial lining fluids in the lungs after the initial onset of lung injury was also reported in both experimental and clinical acute lung injury [6] . Although HMGB1 can be released by macrophages in response to viral infection [23] , the gradual increase of HMGB1 observed in this study is considered to be induced by passive release from necrotic alveolar type II epithelial cells [5] and by active secretion from alveolar macrophages in response to TNF\u03b1, IL-1, IFN\u03b3, and oxidative stress without proved molecular mechanisms [24] [25] [26] . This is because HMGB1 increased in the absence of virulent virus and because the cytoplasmic staining of HMGB1 was significantly increased in these cells after acute exacerbation. In contrast to the role promoting severe inflammation, HMGB1 has been reported to promote tissue repair and regeneration [27] . Importantly, HMGB1 induces the migration of stem cells toward inflamed regions to promote repair and regeneration [28] . For example, in smooth muscle cells, HMGB1 induces proliferation and rapid changes in cellular architecture, resulting in cell migration [29, 30] . Interestingly, many of these restorative effects are mediated through the same receptors (e.g., RAGE) that mediate the proinflammatory properties of the molecule [29] . Considering a recent report that the loss of RAGE contributes to pulmonary fibrosis [31] , the increase of HMGB1 in alveolar fluids itself may induce fibrogenesis through other HMGB1 receptors, such as the Toll-like family of receptors (TLRs), TLR4, TLR2, or TLR9 [32, 33] . The gradual increase of MCP-1 in positive correlation with HMGB1 in alveolar fluids after acute exacerbation may also contribute to fibroproliferation [34, 35] , which is thought to be involved in the regenerative effects of HMGB1. Of course, we cannot deny at this point the plausibility that treatment, including steroid therapy, for these patients in the hospital after the onset of acute exacerbation might affect the gradual increase of HMGB1. In addition, the correlation of the concentration of HMGB1 and/or MCP-1 in BALF with the disease severity of acute exacerbation of IPF has been left for expectations.",

These capillary augmented lesions in IPF patients are susceptible to acute lung injury, not only because these capillaries reduce the ability to antagonize HMGB1 but also because VEGF, which is elevated (augmented) in these lesions [15] , loosens the tight junctions of endothelial cells so as to induce leakage [36, 37] .
