Three hundred and fifty-six respondents (51.2%) reported their experience of caring for H1N1 patients. Despite the fact that 88.5% of all respondents ultimately finished an H1N1 training program, only 41.9% admitted that they had the knowledge of 2009 H1N1 influenza. A total of 572 respondents (82.3%) expressed willingness to care for H1N1 patients. Independent variables associated with increasing likelihood to care for patients in the logistic regression analysis were physicians or nurses rather than other professionals (odds ratio 4.056 and 3.235, p = 0.002 and 0.007, respectively), knowledge training prior to patient care (odds ratio 1.531, p = 0.044), and the confidence to know how to protect themselves and their patients (odds ratio 2.109, p = 0.001).",

            "text": "The novel 2009 influenza A (H1N1) attacked almost all countries since March 2009, which resulted in a severe global healthcare problem leading to the declaration of the first phase 6 global influenza pandemic by the World Health Organization on June 11, 2009. Although the clinical manifestation remains mild to moderate for the initial 3 to 6 days [1] [2] [3] , about 25% of patients experience rapid deterioration, leading to intensive care unit (ICU) admission within 1 day after hospitalization [1] . Based on a model simulating the potential impact of H1N1 influenza pandemic in the United States, Presanis and colleagues found that an autumn-winter pandemic wave of H1N1 with comparable severity per case could lead to approximately 40,000 -140,000 ICU admissions (13 -46 per 100,000 population) [4] . Moreover, Zilberberg et al estimated that 46 million people would contract the infection, resulting in 2.7 million hospitalizations, with 331,587 episodes of acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, equivalent to an increase in the volume of mechanical ventilation of 23% to 45% over the current use [5] . Although the above estimates of the potential numbers of critically ill patients were crude at best, both suggested that, during the influenza pandemic, healthcare workers (HCWs) in ICUs should be prepared to provide critical care support for an excessive volume of critically ill patients over the course of several months. Therefore, it was strongly recommended by the Task Force for Mass Critical Care that, during a disaster, \"hospitals with ICUs should plan and prepare to provide emergency mass critical care every day of the response for a total critically ill patients census at least triple usual ICU capacity\" [6] .",

However, our study suggested that this might not be the case.

In comparison, previous studies found that significantly fewer HCWs might commit to work in the event of a transmissible disease outbreak. However, it should be pointed out that these studies were carried out among general HCWs rather than critical care clinicians. For example, in a survey of 303 employees at 3 health departments in Maryland from March to July 2005, 163 (53.8%) indicated they would likely report to work in the event of an influenza pandemic [7] . Moreover, Syrett and colleagues reported that even fewer HCWs (18%) in University of Rochester Medical Center committed to work in the hypothetical setting of a transmissible infectious agent with only unproven, experimental prophylaxis or treatment [8] . Both the present study and Daugherty's study found that significantly more critical care clinicians reported willingness to work during an influenza pandemic [10] . Similarly, Martinese et al found that, in comparison with the general HCWs, staff working in emergency and acute medical wards directly responsible for the care of influenza patients were more likely to report for duty [9] . The reason for such a significant difference between critical care clinicians and general HCWs remains to be elucidated, but could be related to the perception of the importance of their roles in response to a public health crisis [7, 9] .",

All these data suggested that implementation of an educational intervention might result in better preparedness of critical care HCWs for an H1N1 influenza pandemic. This conclusion was also supported by studies which showed that education programs might lead to higher compliance to infection control measures such as hand hygiene [20] , and more importantly, the reduction of multi-resistant bacteria in hospital settings [21] . Other studies had suggested that the implementation of appropriate education and protective measures improved willingness to work [8, 22] , although investigators did not have the chance to test this hypothesis during the H1N1 influenza pandemic. We reported that only half of all respondents received vaccination for 2009 H1N1 influenza. This finding was consistent with previous studies suggesting that HCWs were reluctant to vaccinate themselves [23, 24] and their children [25] . These studies also demonstrated that, like our results, the major reason for refusing the pandemic vaccine was safety concerns, especially when people believed that the vaccine went through an accelerated approval procedure [23, 25, 26] . Other reasons included concerns about efficacy, and the belief \"that H1N1 is a mild disease\" [25, 26] . These studies also suggested that the willingness to accept the pandemic H1N1 influenza vaccine might be improved by promotion of vaccination for seasonal influenza, and recognition of the role of HCWs in the transmission of influenza to patients and even family members [26] .",

However, the high response rate (89.9%) indicated that the study sample represented the actual hospital staff in participating ICUs. Such a high response rate was achieved through the great effort of contact persons in individual ICUs, such as personal distribution of the survey questionnaire to all ICU staffs, and encouraging all potential respondents to complete the questionnaire and return it before the deadline. Second, our study was conducted in 21 tertiary hospitals, possibly limiting generalization of findings to other hospitals. Nevertheless, local healthcare authorities in China required that all severe cases of H1N1 influenza should be transferred to tertiary hospitals. As a result, this study was conducted in hospital settings where most severe cases of H1N1 influenza were likely to be treated. Last, previous studies suggested that self-reported practice might not represent the actual practice [27] . We might deduce that the actual compliance to infection control measures would be even lower.",
