Using the Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV) as a model RNA virus, we show here that ISG20 interferes with viral replication by decreasing protein synthesis in the absence of RNA degradation. Importantly, we demonstrate that ISG20 exerts a translational control over a large panel of non-self RNA substrates including those originating from transfected DNA, while sparing endogenous transcripts. This activity correlates with the protein's ability to localize in cytoplasmic processing bodies. Finally, these functions are conserved in the ISG20 murine ortholog, whose genetic ablation results in mice with increased susceptibility to viral infection. Overall, our results posit ISG20 as an important defense factor able to discriminate the self/non-self origins of the RNA through translation modulation.",

The prevailing mechanism of inhibition described for ISG20 indicates that this enzyme is capable of directly degrading viral RNA in the absence of apparent sequence specificity. This mode of action has been however challenged by recent studies that revealed that ISG20 could target specific structures on the hepatitis B virus, as well as by others that suggested inhibition in the absence of viral RNA degradation. We now demonstrate that ISG20 interferes with viral replication not by degrading viral RNA, but PLOS Pathogens | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.Project CMIRA Cooperation of the Region RHONE-ALPES AUVERGNE. RM and CJ have the label by impairing its translation. This mechanism of translational control targets all RNAs originated from ectopically introduced genetic material (through viral infection or transient transfection) that we define here collectively as non-self, independently from their viral/non-viral origins. However, ISG20 bears no effect on the translation of endogenous mRNAs transcripts, suggesting that ISG20 can discriminate between the cell's own genetic material (self) and foreign one. By taking profit of their mode of replication through integration, or EBV-like episomal maintenance certain pathogens seemingly escape ISG20 by what can be defined as self-mimicry. Lastly, this mechanism of action is conserved in the ISG20 murine ortholog, whose genetic ablation results in mice with increased susceptibility to viral infection. Overall, our study reveals a novel role of ISG20 as a translational modulator of foreign genetic material playing important functions during viral infection in vivo.",

            "text": "ISG20 was identified in 1997 by the Mechti laboratory as a type-I interferon-induced protein associated to promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies and then to Nucleoli and Cajal bodies [1] [2] [3] . The protein belongs to the DnaQ-like (or DEDD, for Asp-Glu-Asp-Asp) 3'-5' exonuclease superfamily that includes several enzymes with DNA or RNA specificities. Members of this superfamily share three conserved exonuclease motifs (Exo I, II and III) that surround the protein's active site and contain the four DEDD residues important for metal ions chelation [4, 5] . ISG20 exhibits RNA, but no apparent DNA exonuclease activities [3, 6] and this property has been associated with inhibition of a broad range of RNA viruses such as Flaviviridae (Yellow Fever, West Nile, Dengue, Hepatitis C and Bovine Viral Diarrhea viruses), Picornaviridae (Hepatitis A virus), Togaviridae (Sindbis, Chikungunya and Venezuelan equine encephalitis viruses), Rhabdoviridae (Vesicular Stomatitis virus, VSV), Orthomyxoviridae (Influenza virus), Retroviridae (Human Immunodeficiency Type 1 virus), Hepadnaviridae (Hepatitis B virus) and more recently several Bunyaviridae [3, [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] , although certain RNA viruses do resist ISG20 as human Coronavirus and Phleboviruses [10, 17] . Direct viral RNA degradation by ISG20 has been proposed as the main mechanism of viral inhibition based on two main evidences: its potent exonuclease functions in vitro and the loss of antiviral effects observed upon the mutation of DEDD residues in the protein's catalytic site, which constitute at present the only ISG20 mutants described in the literature. However, a number of studies have observed viral inhibition by ISG20 in the absence of viral RNA degradation [10, 11] , raising the possibility that alternative mechanisms may be at play.",

Using VSV as a model for highly replicative RNA viruses, we show here that ISG20 decreases translation from a broad spectrum of viral as well as non-viral mRNAs, as long as they are ectopically expressed. While this mechanism of discrimination relies on an intact catalytic core, it takes place in the absence of target mRNA degradation and correlates with the ability of ISG20 to localize in cytoplasmic processing bodies (P bodies). The properties of human ISG20 are also conserved in its murine orthologue and through the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated generation of isg20 knockout mice, we provide clear evidence that ISG20 plays an important role in the modulation of virus replication in vivo. Overall, our study reveals a novel role for ISG20 as a translational modulator capable of discriminating self from non-self mRNAs, offering novel perspectives on strategies of viral control and an appropriate animal model in which to test them.",

ISG20 was then expressed at levels comparable to those observed in primary monocyte-derived macrophages and dendritic cells stimulated with IFN\u03b1, not only to keep within physiologically relevant boundaries, but also because we noted that higher expression levels of ISG20 were cytotoxic in established cell lines (S1A and S1B Fig). As such, all subsequent experiments were carried out at non-cytotoxic levels of ISG20 expression. Under these conditions, WT ISG20 inhibited VSV spread in the different cell lines tested, in contrast to a catalytically inactive ISG20 mutant (Fig 1A, M1 , that corresponds to the already described . However, when HeLa cells were examined closely, we noted only a moderate reduction in the levels of viral-coded GFP RNA in ISG20-expressing cells in contrast to the drastic decrease in the amount of accumulated viral proteins by WB (Fig 1B, in this recombinant virus, gfp behaves as an additional transcriptional viral unit inserted between the M and the G genes, [18] ). This was not due to loss of the RNA exonuclease abilities of ISG20, as these were readily measurable when ISG20 was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates and incubated with different exogenously-provided substrates (single or double stranded RNAs, as well as DNA:RNA hybrids, although not DNAs as expected [6] , S4A and S4B Fig) . This lack of specificity was not present in cells however, given that the ectopic expression of ISG20 did not lead to the indiscriminate degradation of cellular RNAs (ribosomal as well as small nucleolar RNAs previously shown to be associated to ISG20 [2] ), nor of an Hepatitis C virus (HCV)-derived Luciferase reporter mRNA produced in vitro and then transfected into cells (S4C and S4D Fig) , suggesting that in cells the RNase activity of ISG20 is tightly controlled.",

The gray boxes indicate schematically the position of the three Exo domains of ISG20. The color code is used throughout the figure and refers to the antiviral activities of the indicated mutant: purple = lost; yellow = preserved. D) Dox-inducible ISG20 stable Jurkat T cells expressing the different mutants were obtained and infected with VSV, as specified above at an MOI of 0.001. The graph presents typical replication curves obtained out of three independent experiments. E) HEK293T cells were ectopically transfected with DNAs coding for ISG20 mutants and TREX1, used here as an additional reporter of ISG20 activity on ectopic gene expression. Cells were then metabolically labelled for one hour with 35 S Met/Cys prior to cell lysis. A fraction of the soluble lysate was loaded to appreciate global translational effects (input), while the rest was used for immunoprecipitations with anti-flag antibodies specific for tagged ISG20 and TREX1 proteins. Samples were then loaded onto an SDS-PAGE gel for phosphor imager analysis. The graph presents Means and SEM of three to five independent experiments. \ufffd ; p\ufffd0.05 between the indicated mutant and control, according to a Student t test. F) Correlation between antiviral and translation inhibitory properties of individual ISG20 mutants. The ability of these mutants to inhibit translation from ectopically expressed genes was assessed either directly by 35 S metabolic labeling, or by WB (Fig 2E and S7B Fig, using TREX1 or GFP as examples of exogenous genes, respectively). Under these conditions, the M2 and M5 mutants behaved as WT and strongly reduced the rate of protein synthesis from the exogenous reporter genes, while in contrast the M3, M4 and M2-1 mutants behaved as the catalytically inactive M1-ISG20 and did not significantly affect protein translation, highlighting a near perfect correlation between antiviral abilities and translation inhibition of non-self material ( Fig  2F) . With the exception of the catalytically inactive M1, all mutants exhibited robust RNase activities in vitro (S7C and S7D Fig) . Interestingly, two of the three mutations that altered the properties of ISG20 were spatially close and exposed at the surface of the crystal structure of ISG20 [5] , potentially defining a region that may be involved either directly or indirectly in the regulation of the protein's functions (S7E Fig). Self mimicry allows the escape of target genes' mRNAs from the effects of ISG20 VSV infection and ectopic DNA or RNA transfection do not bear much in common apart from the fact that both represent artificial injections into the cell of non-self genetic material from without. To determine whether ISG20 could be an IFN-induced mechanism of defense acting at the translational level, we determined the effects of ISG20 on exogenous expression cassettes that mimicked cellular host genes. To this end, retroviral-mediated gene transduction was used to stably integrate into the host genome the identical CMV-GFP expression cassette used in Fig 2A. After a three weeks selection, cells were transiently transfected with WT ISG20, lysed and analyzed by WB (Fig 3A) . In this case, ISG20 did not modify the amount of produced GFP, indicating that, when expressed from the cell's genome, the GFP-coding mRNA is ISG20-resistant and suggesting that cellular mRNAs mimicry (meant here as the ability to behave as, or similarly to, cellular genes) could constitute an escape mechanism from ISG20. Some DNA viruses as the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV, Herpesviridae) can be stably maintained in an extrachromosomal latent form in the nucleus of target cells (referred to as episomes) using the cellular DNA machinery for their duplication and segregation into dividing cells. Although both transiently transfected DNA and the EBV genome are extrachromosomal, only the latter presents a chromatin status identical to the host genome [19, 20] . To determine whether this, rather than integration per se, could be a determining factor in the susceptibility to ISG20, HEK293T cells bearing stable EBV-GFP episomes were transiently transfected with DNAs coding for WT ISG20, in addition to a control plasmid coding for HIV-1 Gag (that served as a control for non-self genetic material within the same cells, Fig 3A) . Upon cell lysis and WB analysis, ISG20 did not affect the amount of GFP expressed from the EBV genome, whereas it did affect the amount of Gag. To further strengthen this point, the effect of ISG20 on EBV infection was determined in Hone-1 cells upon the reactivation of the viral lytic cycle with TPA/BA (Fig 3B) [21]. ISG20 did not affect the production of several EBV proteins that typically initiate its lytic cycle indicating that EBV mRNAs were, as cellular ones, largely resistant to the action of ISG20. Also, ISG20 did not modify the extent of EBV infection, when virion particles produced under these conditions were used to challenge Raji cells (S8 Fig) .",

ISG20 exerted similar inhibitory effects on both intron and intronless constructs and it did not appreciably modify the distribution of target mRNAs in cytoplasm and nucleus, overall suggesting that ISG20 does not affect the nucleo-cytoplasmic transport of mRNAs. Lastly, ISG20 could not be detected in crude ribosomal fractions, indicating a lack of stable association with ribosomes (S9C Fig). A series of constructs was used to determine whether ISG20 affected translation initiation by comparing more specifically its effects on cap-dependent versus internal ribosomal entry site (IRES)-translation (Fig 3C, through the use of bicistronic vectors), as well as its effects on RNAs with different 5' untranslated regions (5' UTRs) that require or not eIF factors to initiate translation (Fig 3D) . Gene mimicry of self through integration into the host genome, or EBV-mediated episomal maintenance, allows escape from ISG20 translational targeting. A) HEK293T cells were first stably transduced with a retroviralbased vector bearing a CMV-GFP expression cassette and then transiently transfected with an ISG20-expressing DNA vector. Cells were analyzed forty-eight hours after by WB. Similarly, HEK293T cells carrying a stable EBV-GFP episomal genome were transiently transfected with DNAs coding for ISG20 and HIV-1 Gag, used here as a reporter of the activity of ISG20 on ectopic expression. B) Hone-1 cells that bear a stable latent episomal EBV genome were transfected with ISG20 prior to stimulation with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) and butyric acid (BA) that reactivates the life cycle of EBV via a PKC-dependent mechanism. Cells were lysed twenty-four hours later and analyzed by WB for the indicated EBV proteins. Panels present typical results obtained. C) HEK293T cells were transfected with ISG20 along with the indicated bicistronic DNA vectors. The first cistron bears the 5'UTR of the cellular gene globin (Glo). The second cistron is under the control of several IRESes derived from the cellular gene myc (Myc), polyomavirus (PV), or the encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV). mRNA levels have been normalized to controls (no ISG20 condition) and luciferase activities are reported after mRNA normalization. D) Translationcompetent mRNA generated in vitro were transfected in ISG20 expressing cells, prior to cell lysis one hour afterwards and analyses by RT-qPCR or luciferase assays. The 5'UTRs of these mRNAs varied with respect to the requirement of specific eIFs and were derived from the cellular gene myc (Myc), the cricket paralysis virus (CrPV) and VSV.

Under these conditions, ISG20 was able to inhibit translation of target RNAs containing either the 5' UTR of c-Myc, that requires the complete set of eIFs, or of the cricket paralysis virus (CrPV) that requires none in the absence of mRNA degradation. We noted that in the case of direct mRNA transfection the extent of ISG20 inhibition was lower than in the case of DNA transfections, but we believe this is mainly due to the shorter time frame elapsing between transfection and luciferase assay (one hour, as opposed to overnight).

            "text": "When expressed in two clonal mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cell lines, ISG20 has been recently described to drive type I interferon responses resulting in the expression of different interferon-sensitive genes among which the interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 1 (IFIT1) [11] . IFIT1 recognizes viral uncapped RNAs (often defined as non-self, although the definition used in our study includes more broadly all foreign genetic elements) and has been extensively associated to translation inhibition [23-26], this work raised the possibility that ISG20 could inhibit translation indirectly via the induction of IFIT1. To address this possibility, we analyzed IFIT1 expression in both ectopically transfected HEK293T cells, as well as in stable HEK293T and U937 cells, a myeloid cell line highly sensitive to IFN (Fig 4A) . When HEK293T cells were ectopically transfected with increasing amounts of ISG20-coding DNAs, IFIT1 remained undetectable unless IFN\u03b1 was provided (1.000 U/ml). Similarly, ISG20 induction by doxycycline in stable HEK293T and U937 cells did not induce a concomitant IFIT1 production, indicating that ISG20 does not induce IFIT1 expression under the experimental conditions used here. To more generally appreciate whether ISG20 induced an IFN program, we measured the levels of type-I IFNs potentially secreted upon induction of ISG20 in the supernatants of U937 cells that are more responsive to IFN stimulation than HEK293T. To this end, ISG20 expression was induced via doxycycline in stable U937 cells and 24 hours later supernatants were harvested and incubated with reporter HEK293T cells bearing an integrated expression cassette responsive to type I interferons (6-16:Luc). Reporter cells were then lysed twenty-four hours after and luciferase measured. The levels of type-I IFN measured via this assay remained below the threshold of detection (30 U/mL, in our hands), indicating the absence of major IFN up-regulation following ISG20 induction (Fig 4B) .",

To determine whether this was the case, we employed a commonly used technique to reveal protein association to nuclear bodies. Cells were transiently transfected in duplicate with ISG20 (transfection rates \ufffd80%) and while one sample was immediately fixed, the other was previously treated with detergent prior to fixation to reveal proteins strongly associated to In parallel, IFIT1 expression levels were analyzed by WB in HEK293T and U937 stable-ISG20 cells stimulated for twenty-four hours with different concentrations of doxycycline, or with IFN\u03b12 (1.000 U/ml). B) To measure the possible presence of IFN subtypes in the supernatant of cells expressing ISG20, U937 cells that express the most readily detectable levels of IFIT1 were stimulated as indicated and the supernatant was then transferred to reporter cells expressing Luciferase under the control of the IFN-inducible 6-16 promoter. Luciferase production from reporter cells was then determined twenty-four hours later. The linearity and limit of detection of the assay (30 U/mL in our hands) are routinely determined with external dilutions of IFN. C) HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with plasmids coding for either ISG20 or IFIT1 along with a GFP-coding plasmid followed by WB analysis. The graph present results obtained from 2 independent experiments, while the WB panels display representative results obtained from 3 independent experiments.",

Under these conditions, WT ISG20 was present in 70% of P bodies in double-positive cells, a proportion similar to the functional ISG20 M2 and M5 mutants (62% and 64%, respectively). In contrast, the proportion of ISG20 present in P bodies dropped substantially in all the non-functional mutants examined (M1, M3 and M4, with rates of 12%, 22% and 19%, respectively). Thus, these results indicate ISG20 co-localizes with P bodies. A) HEK293T ISG20-expressing cells were analyzed by confocal microscopy along with two markers of P bodies, TNRC6A and DDX6 in the presence or absence of a one-hour incubation with 100 \u03bcg/ml of Puromycin that induces a translational stress known to increase the number of cells expressing P bodies as well as the number of P bodies on a per cell basis [45] . Control cells not expressing ISG20 are shown only as a zoomed overlay, while the complete panel are presented in S12B Fig. The graph presents the proportion of cells exhibiting detectable P bodies in the presence or absence of puromycin and/or ISG20. B) The different ISG20 mutants were similarly analyzed by confocal microscopy with the exception that an HA-tagged, destabilized form of TNRC6A was also concomitantly expressed by transfection to increase the extent of P bodies accumulation. Representative pictures and distributions (out of >100 cells per condition/mutant in two to three independent experiments) are shown.

Isg20-/-mice were viable and displayed the expected Mendelian frequency. When animals were challenged intraperitoneally with VSV, the survival rates of isg20-/-mice were severely compromised with respect to age-and sex-matched control groups (Fig 7B) , indicating that ISG20 plays an important controlling role during viral containment in vivo. The higher replicative capacity of VSV was evident in different organs and correlated with higher infiltration of inflammatory cells as observed upon hematoxylin and eosin staining (Fig 7C and 7D , lung sections). As expected, peritoneal macrophages (PEM) isolated from isg20-/-mice exhibited an increased susceptibility to infection (Fig 7E, in both percentage of infected cells as well as in their MFI), thus confirming a primary role for ISG20 in intracellular innate defenses. Overall, these results indicate that ISG20 is an important contributor of viral replication control in vivo, corroborating similar results obtained in a previously published animal model [11] .",

The antiviral properties of ISG20 are not linked to its ability to directly degrade viral RNA, but rather to its capacity to interfere with the process of translation. This mechanism of translational regulation targets and is able to distinguish viral RNAs as well as RNA originated from ectopically transfected DNA (that we globally refer to as non-self, for mRNAs originated from non-self genetic elements) from cellular mRNAs (or self) that are instead resistant to ISG20, under the experimental conditions used here. Finally, we determine that resistance to ISG20 can be achieved via integration into the host genome, or through EBV-like maintenance in stable episomes through what can be defined as self mimicry.",

            "text": "ISG20 is a potent and non-specific RNA exonuclease in vitro and this property had long been hypothesized to underpin a broad mechanism of inhibition via the direct degradation of the RNA genome of a large spectrum of RNA viruses, albeit not all [2, 3, [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . However, a few studies failed to observe a decline in viral RNA levels in the presence of ISG20 [10, 11] and evidence of direct binding of target RNAs to ISG20 in cells is lacking. The data presented in our study also argue against overt degradation of viral RNA and point instead to an interference with the process of translation that not only targets viral RNAs, but more generally distinguishes mRNAs according to their self/non-self origins (according to the broader definition used in this study). Despite the fact that the catalytically inactive mutant M1 loses both its exonuclease and translation inhibition activities, whether the former is required for translation inhibition remains unclear. Indeed, mutations in the DEDD residues may potentially exert multiple effects on the protein functions in addition to inhibiting its RNase activity and the in vitro assays used in the field (as well as in this study) do not seem to recapitulate the stringency of action of ISG20 in cells. It is important to note that although our results do not support a mechanism based on the direct degradation of target mRNAs by ISG20, they do not exclude that its exonuclease activity may be turned against a cellular RNA component, itself involved in translation. Rather, we favor this hypothesis in which ISG20 may attack ribosomal RNAs or small nucleolar RNAs that are required for ribosomal RNA methylation, possibly affecting the ribosomes' behavior. Given that cellular RNAs continue to be translated, this implies that ISG20 may affect some, but not all ribosomes. We do not know whether this occurs here, however recent genome-wide studies have clearly highlighted that ribosomes are not only heterogeneous in composition, but also in function [30-33], so that it is possible that the activity of ISG20 is directed only against a specific subset of ribosomes.",

Notable differences exist however with the mechanism described here, as STING seems to act on the phase of translation initiation, thus sparing mRNAs that require no initiation factors (such as CrPV) [34], while on the contrary ISG20 targets also these mRNAs, strongly pointing in this case to a mechanism of regulation at a step other than translation initiation.",

            "text": "A previous study also suggested that ISG20 could interfere with viral translation in the absence of target RNA degradation [11] . In this study however, this inhibition was linked to the ability of ISG20 to induce IFN when expressed in MEF cell lines and more specifically the Interferon-Protein with Tetratricopeptide repeats 1 protein (IFIT1, [11] ), a known translational modulator that impairs uncapped RNAs [25, 35, 36]. However, we have failed to obtain evidence of IFN and of IFIT1 upregulation in our experimental system and since IFIT1 cannot target the translation of mRNAs expressed from plasmid DNAs its involvement in the ISG20-mediated inhibition we describe here is unlikely. Furthermore, if ISG20 expression resulted in the direct upregulation of an IFN program, ISG20 would be expected to inhibit far more viruses than currently reported. It is therefore possible that this aspect of the biology of ISG20 can be observed solely under very particular conditions. If translation initiation does not seem to be the main step affected by ISG20, our results highlight a tight correlation between the ability of the different ISG20 mutants to inhibit translation and their localization in P bodies, which is in line with the key role of these cytoplasmic structures in translational silencing and which would suggest RNA re-routing by ISG20. P bodies are involved in numerous aspects of RNA metabolism and although initially described as sites of RNA degradation [37], their functions have been further complexified by studies indicating their role in RNA storage as well as in RNA translational repression in the absence of RNA degradation [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] . Thus, the results we have obtained at this stage support the hypothesis that P bodies play an instrumental role in the action of ISG20. However, it remains possible that these structures form as a consequence of the translational block itself [43] [44] [45] , so that additional work will be required to firmly establish the functional role of these structures during ISG20-mediated translation inhibition.",

Specific co-or post-transcriptional modifications themselves linked to the chromatin status (as for example, N 6 -methyladenosine, m 6 A, reviewed in [46, 47] ) are known to modulate different steps of mRNA biology and it is possible that a major difference between genetic elements embedded in the host chromatin and the others resides in the identity of marks deposited on the mRNA. Lack of such signals may expose the mRNA to ISG20 and to its translational regulation, providing an interesting level of regulation of foreign elements. An alternative and non-mutually exclusive hypothesis may be that the levels -and not the identity-of post-transcriptional modifications may be lower in elements that are either present in high number of copies or that are expressed at high levels, simply because the system is overrun, thus exposing the RNA to the action of ISG20. This hypothesis is also of interest and may be viewed as a basic threshold control mechanism of transcription/translation that is automatically turned on when genetic elements that replicate (or transcribe/translate) rapidly at high levels, as is the case during viral infection or following ectopic DNA transfection.",

In this respect, integration into the host genome or latent episomal maintenance may constitute a self mimicry defense strategy used by certain viruses, as we have shown here for EBV, to escape ISG20 surveillance. From a more general perspective, it will be of high interest to determine the extent of the translational control activity of ISG20 on viruses such as retroviruses, retroelements, as well as more broadly on different DNA viral families.",

Given that the effects of IFN on translation are not absolute and vary according to the cell type, the fact that ISG20 targets a step downstream translation initiation is of high interest, because it suggests the existence of a second layer of translational control in which ISG20 would target RNAs that have escaped the eIF2 \u03b1 -block.

A and B) HEK293T cells transiently transfected in 10 cm plates with ISG20 coding DNA were lysed and ISG20 immunoprecipitated via anti-flag antibodies conjugated to agarose beads. After washing, beads bound material was incubated with the indicated nucleic acids (1 \u03bcg), prior to loading on agarose gels and densitometry quantification. Nucleic acids were as follows: ssRNA, in vitro transcribed single-stranded RNA, length of approximatively 1700 nucleotides; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA, oligonucleotide of 76 nucleotides; dsDNA, double stranded pcDNA3 plasmid (Invitrogen) linearized with PstI; poly I:C and yeast tRNAs, self-explicatory. In B, the indicated RNA and DNA forms were generated as described in the Methods section. C) HEK293T cells transiently transfected as above were directly lysed and the amount of small nuclear RNAs (U1, U2, U3 and U6) or of total RNA was evaluated by RT-qPCR and agarose migration, respectively. D) As in C but cells were also transfected with 200 ng of in vitro transcribed mRNA containing the 5' UTR of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) and bearing the Firefly luciferase. Upon cell lysis the amount of transfected HCV-Luc mRNA was determined by RT-qPCR. A schematic representation of the RNA target and the position of the PCR amplicon is provided. The graphs present Means and SEM of independent experiments (n = 2 to 3 depending on target for B; n = 3 for C; n = 4 for D). The panels present typical results obtained. \ufffd , p\ufffd 0.05, following a Student t test. HEK293T cells transiently transfected with ISG20 and GFP coding plasmids (as in Fig 2B) were analyzed by WB twenty-four hours afterwards. To better appreciate the linearity and magnitude of the defect in GFP accumulation by WB, the control sample was serially diluted. C) As above, but cells were analyzed by flow cytometry to appreciate the decrease in the percentage of GFP-positive cells (displayed in the panels), as well as their MFI. D) HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with a fixed dose of GFP reporter and increasing concentrations of ISG20 followed by cell analysis by WB (from 1:1 to 1:8). E) HEK293T cells were transfected with DNAs coding for indicated proteins using either Calcium phosphate or lipofectaminebased DNA transfection, prior to WB analysis. reporter. The amount of GFP reporter was then determined by densitometry after WB. C) The different ISG20 mutants were immunoprecipitated from transfected HEK293T cells and incubated with a single-stranded RNA oligo (R20). Upon migration on an agarose gel, the amount of intact RNAs were measured by densitometry. D) Correlative analysis between the RNAse and antiviral properties of individual ISG20 mutants. The graph present Means and SEM of four individual experiments (two for panel B). \ufffd , p\ufffd 0.05 following a Student t test. E) Spatial positioning of the indicated mutations on the crystal structure of ISG20. (TIF) S8 Fig. ISG20 does not affect the production of infectious virion particles of EBV. Hone cells containing a latent EBV genome bearing GFP were transfected with ISG20 and EBV reactivated from latency upon TPA/BA treatment as in the legend to Fig 2D. To determine whether ISG20 could affect the translation of the plethora of virion products required for the production of infectious virion particles, supernatants were syringe-filtered and virion infectivity was measured after challenge of target Raji cells and flow cytometry analysis three days later. (TIF) S9 Fig. ISG20 does not influence nucleocytoplasmic RNA transport and is not detectably associated to ribosomes. A) HEK293T cells were cotransfected with ISG20 along with two constructs coding for a Firefly luciferase reporter expressed from a globin promoter and containing or not an intron, prior to cell lysis and luciferase measurement. B) HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with ISG20 and GFP-coding plasmids and subsequently lysed to obtain nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions. Upon normalization of the two fractions by volume, samples were analyzed by WB and RT-qPCR (GFP). The distribution of two small nuclear RNAs known to be enriched in the nucleus (U1 and U3 by RT-qPCR) was also included as control for fractionation. C) HEK293T cells transfected with ISG20 were lysed, the ribosomal fraction purified, followed by WB analysis. The graphs present data obtained from two (Luc) and five (PCRs) independent experiments and panels present typical results. \ufffd , p\ufffd 0.05, following a Student t test. (TIF) S10 Fig. The catalytically inactive M1-ISG20 mutant is devoid of translation inhibition activity. HEK293T cells were transfected with the indicated reporters along with WT or M1-ISG20 mutant prior to cell lysis and luciferase assay measurement. The graph presents data obtained from two and four independent experiments. Glo, globin; PV, polyomavirus; Myc, c-Myc. The nomenclature 1 st and 2 nd refers to the position of the cistron in bicistronic vectors. (TIF) S11 Fig. ISG20 and IFIT1 inhibit VSV infection. HEK293T cells transfected with plasmids coding the above-mentioned proteins were challenged twenty-four hours afterwards with VSV-GFP at an MOI of 0.01 prior to flow cytometry analyses twenty four hours later. The graph presents results obtained with three independent experiments. \ufffd , p\ufffd 0.05, following a Student t test between control cells and the indicated condition. (TIF) S12 Fig. ISG20 displays a weak association to nuclear bodies and does not modify the extent of P bodies formation in the cell. A) HEK293T cells were transiently transfected in duplicate with plasmids coding ISG20 (routine transfection rates \ufffd80%). Twenty-four hours afterwards, one aliquot was immediately fixed while the second was first permeabilized with detergent prior to fixation. Both were then similarly processed and analyzed by confocal microscopy using antibodies specific for ISG20 (Flag), as well as for the nuclear speckles marker SC35. This procedure is commonly used to study nuclear bodies and associated proteins that resist detergent extraction prior to fixation. Representative pictures and relative distributions are show here (>80 cells scored per condition). B) Control cells were analyzed by confocal microscopy with the endogenous P bodies markers TNRC6A and DDX6 (ISG20-expressing cells and a portion of the overlay of control cells depicted here are presented in Fig  5A) .
