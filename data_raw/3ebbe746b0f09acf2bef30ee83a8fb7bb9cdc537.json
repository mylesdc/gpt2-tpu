            "text": "Artificial microRNA (amiRNA)-mediated inhibition of viral replication has recently gained importance as a strategy for antiviral therapy. In this study, we evaluated the benefit of using the amiRNA vector against Japanese encephalitis virus ( JEV). We designed three single amiRNA sequences against the consensus sequence of 3\u00a2 untranslated region (3\u00a2UTR) of JEV and tested their efficacy against cell culture-grown JEV Vellore strain (P20778) in neuronal cells. The binding ability of three amiRNAs on 3\u00a2UTR region was tested in vitro in HEK293T cells using a JEV 3\u00a2UTR tagged with luciferase reporter vector. Transient transfection of amiRNAs was nontoxic to cells as evident from the MTT assay and caused minimal induction in interferonstimulated gene expression. Furthermore, our result suggested that transient expression of two amiRNAs (amiRNA #1 and amiRNA #2) significantly reduced intracellular viral RNA and nonstructural 1 (NS1) protein, as well as diminished infectious viral particle release up to 95% in the culture supernatant as evident from viral plaque reduction assay. Overall, our results indicated that RNA interference based on amiRNAs targeting viral conserved regions at 3\u00a2UTR was a useful approach for improvements of nucleic acid inhibitors against JEV.",

            "text": "R NA interference (RNAi) based on artificial micro-RNA (amiRNA)-mediated inhibition of the target gene has evidenced to be an essential tool for antiviral therapy. The amiRNAs are small RNA molecules that are expressed under the backbone of endogenous cellular miRNAs and act as more efficient inhibitors of cellular genes [1] . The amiRNAs express through RNA polymerase II. Like miRNAs, amiRNAs binds to the targeted mRNA in a sequence-specific manner leading to direct mRNA degradation or translational inhibition. Ideally, amiRNA-expressing vectors provide unique benefits in designing antiviral therapy as it is less toxic than regular shRNA vector [2] [3] [4] . Owing to the specificity and efficiency of gene silencing, it was increasingly investigated whether amiRNAs targeted to the viral genome can control viral replication in infected cells. So far, the amiRNA-mediated antiviral approach has found to be useful for many viruses, including adenoviruses, rabies virus, dengue virus, chikungunya, and porcine reproductive and respiratory virus. In all the cases, it has been shown to be an efficient inhibitor of virus replication with minimal or no cytotoxicity [5] [6] [7] [8] .",

The 3\u00a2UTR has been shown to be necessary for viral replication and immune modulation. This region consists of elements that are essential for genome cyclization, resulting in the initiation of RNA synthesis [15] . In addition to the critical role 3\u00a2UTR plays on RNA synthesis, the stem-loop structure of 3\u00a2UTR is also responsible for the generation of subgenomic flavivirus RNA (sfRNA). This sfRNA helps the virus evade host immune response, thereby affecting viral pathogenesis. Therefore, to inhibit the viral replication, we designed amiRNAs against JEV 3\u00a2UTR and tested against cell culture-grown JEV strain. Our results suggested that targeting JEV 3\u00a2UTR by specific amiRNAs could be useful to reduce viral replication in the neuronal cells.",

We lysed the cells at 48 hpi for western blot (WB) analysis, and culture supernatant was used for plaque reduction analysis. Compared to control amiRNAs-lacZ and amiRNA #5, cells expressing amiRNA #2 exhibited a marked reduction in JEV RNA and NS1 protein expression as observed by quantitative real time-PCR (qRT-PCR) and WB at 48 hpi (Fig. 4A, B) . Transfection of other amiRNAs showed the moderate effect on viral replication. Plaque assay was performed to quantify the infectious particles released into the culture supernatant. Compared to control, transfection of amiRNA #2 significantly reduced virus release in the culture supernatant (>95%). With other amiRNAs, a 20%-50% reduction was evident. JEV titer in amiRNA #1-, amiRNA #2-, and amiRNA #5-treated cells was 3.4 \u00b7 10 6 , 1.2 \u00b7 10 6 , and 2.8 \u00b7 10 7 pfu/mL, respectively, at 48 hpi, compared to 6.4 \u00b7 10 7 pfu/mL in virus amiRNA-lacZ, respectively (Fig. 4C) . We also performed indirect immunofluorescence assay using amiRNA. Compared to control or amiRNA #5, cells transfected with amiRNA #2 showed a significant inhibitory effect. Our data revealed that cells with strong GFP exhibited less viral NS1 expression and cells expressing less GFP exhibited enhanced viral replication, as evidenced by NS1 staining in amiRNA #2transfected cells (Fig. 5) . In this study, we examined the effect of vector-delivered amiRNA on JEV replication in neuronal cells. We have provided evidence that amiRNA-based RNAi could efficiently inhibit JEV replication in neuronal cells. This is the first report to successfully apply vector-delivered amiRNA targeted against the consensus sequence of JEV 3\u00a2UTR in inhibition of JEV replication.

Not only high rate mutation but also the presence of the blood-brain barrier raises significant concern in delivering the therapeutics in the brain. Several studies reported previously adopted a siRNA-based approach to inhibit JEV replication. However, synthetic dsRNA cannot pass the blood-brain barrier efficiently. An alternative method for the delivery of RNAi into the central nervous system (CNS) is required. In our study, we have used the polymerase-II-promoterdriven plasmid vector that can produce amiRNA targeted against JEV 3\u00a2UTR [17] . This type of vector exhibited unique benefits in designing antiviral therapy as it provides comparatively less toxic RNAi molecules inside the cells. The effective amiRNAs can also be integrated into viral vectors, such as lentivirus, adenovirus, or adeno-associated virus, for delivery into the CNS [18] . Another way amiRNAs can also be delivered is by using naturally occurring small vesicles called exosomes. This exosome release from most of the cells may be engineered for delivering to specific tissues or organs [19, 20] .",

Color images available online at www .liebertpub.com/nat regions (5\u00a2 and 3\u00a2 UTR) display exceptional sequence conservation, as these regions play critical roles in translation and RNA replication initiation [21] . Taking advantage of this fact, we designed our amiRNA sequences from the conserved 3\u00a2UTR region. The amiRNA #2 seed sequences are highly conserved against all the virulent strains of different genotypes. We checked the RNAi activity of amiRNAs against Vellore strain (P20778). Due to the conservation nature of the seed sequence across the genotypes, we believe that amiRNA #2 will also be able to inhibit other viral strains of different genotypes efficiently. We did not find the significant inhibitory effect of amiRNA #5 even though the sequence cloned correctly and amiRNA #5 expressed in the cells. This may be because there is nucleotide mismatch between Vellore strain and the rest of the viral strain in the seed sequence region (Fig. 3C ). This result further emphasizes the importance of complete seed match sequence, while designing the amiR-NAs. Also, we concluded that the antiviral activity of amiRNA #2 was sequence specific as it did not induce an additional ISG response compared to control.",
