Non-human primates (NHP) remain the gold standard for modeling filovirus disease, but they are not conducive to screening large numbers of experimental compounds and should only be used to test the most promising candidates. Therefore, other smaller animal models are a valuable asset. We have recently developed a guinea-pig adapted SUDV virus that is lethal in guinea pigs. In our current study, we show that ferrets are susceptible to wild-type SUDV, providing a small animal model to directly study clinical isolates, screen experimental anti-SUDV compounds and potentially study viral transmission.",

Historically, Ebola virus (EBOV; Zaire ebolavirus species) has been the most common and deadly of the filoviruses. Therefore, the research community has largely focused on the development of EBOV animal models, tools, vaccines and therapeutics and has been successful in producing several compounds that have reached the late stages of clinical trials [1] [2] . In light of this success, it is now possible to extend further research towards the discovery of pan-filovirus vaccines and therapeutics. However, animal models that are susceptible to all ebolaviruses species will need to be established first in order to directly evaluate whether pan-filovirus vaccines and therapeutics provide cross-protection.",

Yet due to ethical, cost and space restraints that accompany NHP studies, smaller animal models such as mice or guinea pigs are typically the first choice for initial filovirus drug, vaccine and pathogenesis studies. Although wild-type filoviruses do not cause significant disease in adult, immunocompetent rodents, these viruses have been adapted to rodents so that virulence and lethality are observed [3] [4] [5] . Even though these rodent models do not reproduce all hallmark clinical signs of filovirus disease, their relative ease-ofuse and low cost make them attractive first options for evaluating anti-viral prophylactics and therapeutics.",

SUDV is endemic in South Sudan and the Republic of Uganda and is highly lethal to humans with an average case fatality rate of 53%. The 2000-2001 SUDV outbreak in Uganda was the second largest filovirus outbreak to date, and resulted in 224 deaths in 425 total cases www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget/ Oncotarget, 2017, Vol. 8, (No. 28), pp: 46262-46272 Research Paper www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget (CFR of 53%) [6] . Unlike EBOV, there is a comparative lack of experimental medical countermeasures against SUDV, and animal models for SUDV are just beginning to emerge. In 2014, it was shown that AG129 (alpha/beta/ gamma interferon receptor knockout) mice are susceptible to wild-type SUDV infections [7] . In addition, we recently characterized a guinea pig-adapted variant, which was uniformly lethal to guinea pigs [5] .",

Our stock virus was originally isolated from acute-phase blood of a patient during the 1976 outbreak in Sudan, and then passaged once in guinea pigs, and twice in Vero E6 cells. Its sequence after these passaging steps did not change in comparison to the original patient sample. In addition, the sequence of virus recovered from the ferrets at time of death was not different from the clinical isolate or the input virus, indicating that the virus did not adapt and was, in fact, \"wild-type\". On days 0, 2, 4, 6 postinfection as well as on the day of euthanasia (days 7-9), a clinical assessment was performed where blood samples were taken for a complete blood count with differential, a quantification of serum biochemistry parameters, coagulation factors, and viremia.",

Signs of illness were observed beginning on day 4, and include decreased activity and food and water intake. Respiration rate was increased, and there was a notable absence of urine in severely ill animals. Diarrhea was observed early after the onset of illness but dry/no feces were more prevalent in the animals during advanced SUDV disease. A fever was observed beginning at day 4 post infection ( Figure 1B ) and a 10-20% decrease in weight between days 6 and 9 ( Figure 1C ). Viremia was detectable by TCID 50 by day 6 in both groups ( Figure 1D ) and by RT-qPCR by day 4 (Supplementary Figure 3A) . While similar peak titers were reached by TCID 50 , the intranasal group trended towards slightly higher genome copies than the intramuscular group at later timepoints such as days 7-9; however, this difference did not reach statistical significance.",

The presence of thrombin and fibrinogen in the blood is generally indicative of coagulation and results from the activity of either an intrinsic or extrinsic coagulation pathway. To assay for thrombin, plasma samples from each ferret were spiked with a known amount of thrombin that activated blood clotting in about 21s in control (pre-infection) samples; faster clotting times in endpoint samples indicated that additional thrombin was present ( Figure 3A ). In order to measure fibrinogen levels, a standard curve was produced using control plasma samples containing serial dilutions of known amounts of fibrinogen; the clotting time was then measured in ferret samples and fibrinogen levels were calculated based on the standard curve ( Figure 3B ). All ferrets had 2-4 fold higher levels of fibrinogen at time of death compared to pre-infection. The measurement of activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) determined the activity of the intrinsic coagulation pathway (factors XII, XI, IX, VIII, X, V, II and I) ( Figure 3C ); the ratio displayed in our results indicates that the activity in the ferret plasma samples was elevated compared to the manufacturer's control plasma sample. Prothrombin www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget time % (PT%) indicates the percentage of normal activity in our ferret samples compared to a manufacturer's control plasma sample and correlates with the involvement of the extrinsic coagulation pathway (factors II, V, VII, and X); this value was decreased in both IN and IM groups at time of death ( Figure 3D ).",

Our study demonstrates that both IM and IN routes of SUDV inoculation lead to viremia, systemic organ infection and dysfunction, viral shedding, and a similar time to death. This is evidenced by the following indicators: 1) increase in viremia and organ viral loads, which is indicative of uncontrolled virus replication and spread; 2) decrease in WBC and LYM counts, which is indicative of compromised immunity; and 3) increases in fibrinogen, APTT, TT, and decreases in PLT and PT%, which is indicative of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy. While the overall kinetics of the viral infection was similar between the two groups, viral loads were consistently higher in the IN infected animals and appeared earlier in the nasal and oral swabs as well as the lung tissue.",

However, the ferret model also provides several major advantages. Of particular value is the ability to use clinical isolates without the need for prior adaptation [8] [13] [14] . All three ebolaviruses tested in another study [13] and the SUDV species used in our current study were highly infectious and uniformly lethal, which has not been previously possible without adaptation except in non-human primates. Our study also adds several valuable and unique aspects to the characterization of SUDV-infected ferrets. For example, we compared two different common routes of infection. IN represents a mucosal infection, which is thought to be the most common natural infection route among people, whereas IM inoculation is similar to a needle-stick injury in the lab. Interestingly, our data demonstrated that the rate and spread of virus is very similar in both routes of infection with the exception that nasal, oral and lung tissues replicated the virus to approximately 10-fold higher titers. We also included novel data regarding viral shedding from mucosal tissues that demonstrated that ferrets may hold promise for future transmission studies, which currently rely solely on the use of nonhuman primates. Although we did not directly test transmission in this study, we observed high levels of oral and nasal viral shedding suggesting that ferrets may readily transmit to other ferrets via these routes. The ability to study ebolavirus transmission without the use of nonhuman primates would be highly beneficial both in terms of cost, feasibility and ethics approval. Overall, the development of a ferret model for ebolaviruses provides a useful intermediate animal model that may be able to bridge rodent and nonhuman primate studies, as well as provide a new means of studying viral transmission and testing vaccines and therapeutics.",
