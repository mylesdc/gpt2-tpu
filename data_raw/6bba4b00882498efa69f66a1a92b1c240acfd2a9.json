            "text": "Pigs are often colonized by more than one bacterial and/or viral species during respiratory tract infections. This phenomenon is known as the porcine respiratory disease complex (PRDC). Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (App) and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) are pathogens that are frequently involved in PRDC. The main objective of this project was to study the in vitro interactions between these two pathogens and the host cells in the context of mixed infections. To fulfill this objective, PRRSV permissive cell lines such as MARC-145, SJPL, and porcine alveolar macrophages (PAM) were used. A pre-infection with PRRSV was performed at 0.5 multiplicity of infection (MOI) followed by an infection with App at 10 MOI. Bacterial adherence and cell death were compared. Results showed that PRRSV preinfection did not affect bacterial adherence to the cells. PRRSV and App co-infection produced an additive cytotoxicity effect. Interestingly, a pre-infection of SJPL and PAM cells with App blocked completely PRRSV infection. Incubation of SJPL and PAM cells with an App cell-free culture supernatant is also sufficient to significantly block PRRSV infection. This antiviral activity is not due to LPS but rather by small molecular weight, heat-resistant App metabolites (,1 kDa). The antiviral activity was also observed in SJPL cells infected with swine influenza virus but to a much lower extent compared to PRRSV. More importantly, the PRRSV antiviral activity of App was also seen with PAM, the cells targeted by the virus in vivo during infection in pigs. The antiviral activity might be due, at least in part, to the production of interferon c. The use of in vitro experimental models to study viral and bacterial co-infections will lead to a better understanding of the interactions between pathogens and their host cells, and could allow the development of novel prophylactic and therapeutic tools.",

            "text": "Respiratory disease in pigs is common in modern pork production worldwide and is often referred to as porcine respiratory disease complex (PRDC) [1] . PRDC is polymicrobial in nature, and occurs following infections with various combinations of primary and secondary respiratory pathogens. There are a variety of viral and bacterial pathogens commonly associated with PRDC including porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (App) [1] . Both are considered pathogens of major importance or relevance for the pig industry [1] . Furthermore, bacterial-viral co-infections can exacerbate the pathogenicity of respiratory pig diseases [1] . For example, co-infections with Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae and swine influenza virus (SIV) exhibited more severe clinical disease [2] , PRRSV and Streptococcus suis co-infection experiments confirmed that PRRSV predisposes pigs to S. suis infection and bacteremia [3] and increases the virulence of PRRSV in pigs [4] , M. hyopneumoniae infection increases effectiveness of PRRSV infection and lesions [5] , and PRRSV infection was able to accelerate Haemophilus parasuis infection and loads [6] . Those studies on coinfections principally looked at the macroscopic lesions and at the clinical signs. Only a few recent studies are investigating more closely the direct interactions and mechanisms involved between the pathogens. As an example, Qiao and collaborators showed that PRRSV and bacterial endotoxin (LPS) act in synergy to amplify the inflammatory response of infected macrophages [7] . Thus, it is crucial to develop new in vitro models to investigate in more details the mechanistic and the interactions involved in polymicrobial infections.",

            "text": "Auger et al. 2009 [20] have previously published that SJPL cell death induced by App occurs through necrosis and not apoptosis. Consequently, based on this previous report, only a cytotoxicity experiment was performed in order to verify if PRRSV infection increases the cytotoxicity of App. Moreover, this assay was done to confirm that inactivation of the toxins ApxI and ApxII in the mutant AppDapxIDapxIIC reduces cell death seen with Appwt strain. Thus, LDH cytotoxicity assays to detect cell death were performed on cells infected with PRRSV for 72 hours and then co-infected with Appwt strain or AppDapxIDapxIIC. As shown in Figure 2 , the cytotoxic activity of Appwt was higher in both cell lines after 2 hours of incubation, around 36% in SJPL cells ( Figure 2A ) and around 14% in MARC-145 cells ( Figure 2C ) compared to the one of AppDapxIDapxIIC mutant after 6 hours of incubation, which was less than 15% in SJPL cells ( Figure 2B ) and around 7% in MARC-145 cells ( Figure 2D ). As expected, the AppDapxIDapxIIC mutant is markedly less cytotoxic than the parental strain Appwt. Thus, AppDapxIDapxIIC mutant allows much longer incubation periods with cells and facilitate in vitro observation. Furthermore, coinfection with PRRSV and AppDapxIDapxIIC increased SJPL and MARC-145 cells death compared to App single infection ( Figure 2B and D, respectively), showing an additive cytotoxicity effect of PRRSV and AppDapxIDapxIIC. Because of its markedly reduced cytotoxicity, the AppDapxIDapxIIC was used for all the subsequent experiments.",

MARC-145 cell line was used to compare results obtained with SJPL cell line since MARC-145 cells are the most common cells used during in vitro PRRSV studies. Interestingly, results were different between the two cell lines. In PRRSV infected MARC-145 cells, only a small reduction of cells expressing the PRRSV N protein was observed following a co-infection with AppDapxIDapxIIC ( Figure 3G ). Thus, SJPL cells were qualitatively more responsive to the App antiviral affect than MARC-145 cells. Moreover, since SJPL cells were recently shown to be from monkey origin [21] and not from swine as first described [22] , evaluation of the antiviral activity of App was tested in a porcine relevant cell model, the PAM cells. Co-infection with AppDapxIDapxIIC and PRRSV in PAM cells also presented total absence of PRRSV N protein detection ( Figure 3L ), as in SJPL cells ( Figure 3B ), suggesting that AppDapxIDapxIIC can also inhibits PRRSV in PRRSV's in vivo porcine target cells, the porcine alveolar macrophages. Incubation with UV-inactivated AppDapxI-DapxIIC bacteria after PRRSV infection allowed the detection of N proteins of PRRSV by IFA in all cell types ( Figure 3C , 3H and 3M) showing that UV-inactivated bacteria were not able to block PRRSV infection. Interestingly, the bacteria-free culture supernatant of AppDapxIDapxIIC also effectively blocked PRRSV infection in SJPL and PAM cells ( Figure 3D and 3N, respectively). A weak inhibition was observed in MARC-145 cells ( Figure 3I ). pH did not vary between all the tested conditions, being stable at around 7.360.1. The active metabolites present in the culture supernatant did not seem to be App LPS ( Figure 3E , 3J and 3O) nor peptidoglycan fragments (assayed with NOD1 or NOD2 ligands) ( Figure S1D and S1F, respectively). Dilutions of AppDapxIDapxIIC supernatant showed a dose-dependent effect on PRRSV's detection by IFA. A 1:2 dilution resulted in twice as much PRRSV N protein when observed with IFA (data not shown). The loss of antiviral activity of AppDapxIDapxIIC supernatant was observed with 1:10, 1:20 and 1:40 dilutions.",

            "text": "PRRSV titers were measured to confirm IFA observations and to quantify the inhibitory effect of AppDapxIDapxIIC on PRRSV infection. SJPL, MARC-145 and PAM cells were infected or treated as described previously. In SJPL cells after 72 hours post PRRSV infection, viral titer obtained was 6.25 log10 TCID 50 /ml ( Figure 4A ), in MARC-145 cells, was 7.6 log10 TCID 50 /ml ( Figure 4B ) and in PAM cells, 6.0 log10 TCID 50 /ml ( Figure 4C ). Co-infection with AppDDapxIDapxIIC or treatment with its culture supernatant blocked completely PRRSV replication (P,0.01) in SJPL cells ( Figure 4A ). But in MARC-145 cells, their antiviral effect on PRRSV replication was markedly less efficient. More specifically, in MARC-145 cells, PRRSV titers were 4.9 log10 TCID 50 /ml (which correspond to a 751 fold decrease compared to PRRSV non-treated infected cell) and 6.5 log10 TCID 50 /ml (which correspond to a 19 fold decrease compared to PRRSV non-treated infected cell) for AppDapxIDapxIIC (P,0.01) and its cell-free culture supernatant (P,0.05) treated cells, respectively ( Figure 4B ). In PAM cells, results obtained with PRRSV's titration showed that live AppDapxIDapxIIC completely blocked PRRSV replication (P,0.001) and that its culture supernatant significantly inhibits PRRSV infection in PAM, reducing its amount of infectious virions to 2.9 log10 TCID 50 /ml (P,0.001 compared to PRRSV infection at 10 6 TCID50/mL) which correspond to a 1250 fold decrease ( Figure 4C ). Stimulation of the cells with App purified LPS or co-infection with UV inactivated bacteria did not have any effect on PRRSV titer in all cell types ( Figure 4A , 4B and 4C). Those results confirm the IFA data obtained previously. In addition, it is important to note that inhibition in PAM is total with live AppDapxIDapxIIC as observed previously in SJPL cells and below PRRSV inoculum when treated with AppDapxIDapxIIC cell culture supernatant. Thus, those results indicate that AppDapxI-DapxIIC antiviral effect against PRRSV can be observed not only in SJPL cells but also in porcine alveolar macrophages. Fractionation of the cell culture supernatant of AppDapxIDapxIIC indicated that the ihnibitory effect on PRRSV infection is mediated by small App metabolite(s) weighting ,1 kDa ( Figure 5C ). The same results were obtained with all small fractions tested, ,3 ( Figure S2D ), 10 (data not shown) and 50 kDa ( Figure S2F ). Additionally, treatment at 56uC for 30 min of these low molecular weight App metabolite(s) did not inactivate their ihnibitory effect on PRRSV infection and/or replication in SJPL cells, showing that those App antiviral metabolites are heatresistant (data not shown).",

Overall, 50% of the viruses tested that are able to replicate in SJPL cells (excluding PRRSV) were inhibited by were infected with or without PRRSV at an MOI of 0.5 during 72 hours, and then cells were co-infected with App (for 1 or 2 hours) (A and C, respectively) or with AppDapxIDapxIIC (for 4, 5 and 6 hours) (B and D, respectively) at an MOI of 10.

Treatment with AppDapxICDapxIIC supernantant alone induced a significant increase of IFNb mRNA compared to mock infected cells, but co-treated cells did not showed a significant increase compared to mock infected cells. PRRSV infection in SJPL cells did not modulate IFNc mRNA levels. However, treatment with AppDapxICDapxIIC supernantant alone or as co-treatment significantly increased IFNc mRNA compared to mock infected SJPL cells.",

However, coinfection with PRRSV and AppDapxIDapxIIC did not result in a significant increase of cell death when compared to PRRSV infection alone, supporting that AppDapxIDapxIIC is less (if not) toxic to eukaryotic cells and that cytotoxicity is mainly caused by PRRSV in co-infected cells.

Subsequently, other results showed that the antiviral activity was also present in the bacterial supernatant and was not due to App purified LPS, nor NOD ligands, but probably to low molecular weight metabolites of ,1 kDa. Inhibition of PRRSV replication by AppDapxIDapxIIC is not generated by contact between bacterial and eukaryotic host cell, since it was also observed with App cell culture supernatant; thus without the presence of App bacterial cells. Furthermore, this antiviral effect is not only observed in SJPL cells but also in the PRRSV natural host target cells, i.e. PAM. This suggests that the antiviral action of AppDapxIDapxIIC can be efficient in different cell species and types. Viral inhibition in PAM cells was complete in presence of the bacteria AppDapxIDapxIIC and was partial when treated with its cell culture supernatant. Other combinations of [19] . In this previous report, we demonstrated that SJPL and MARC-145 cells do not have the same division rate and that the development of the cytopathic effect (CPE) induced by PRRSV in SJPL cells was delayed compared to MARC-145 cells. Furthermore, the cytokine profiles after PRRSV infection were different between the two cell lines. These results suggested that PRRSV infection could be different in each. Thus, the difference in PRRSV infection between both cell lines could explain the difference observed for the AppDapxIDap-xIIC supernatant antiviral activity.",

Results of this study showed that there is no modulation of IFNa mRNA levels. IFNb mRNA levels were increased in PRRSV and in AppDapxIDapxIIC supernatant alone but no significant increase was observed in the PRRSV + AppDapxIDapxIIC supernatant condition when compared to mock infected cells. Thus, the impaired IFNb expression following co-treatment might be due to PRRSV replication which might block IFN production induced by AppDapxIDapxIIC supernatant. Additionally, those results demonstrate that since PRRSV can inhibit type I IFN induction and signalling [31] [32] [33] [34] , antiviral activity induced by AppDapxIDapxIIC supernatant may not rely on its ability to induce IFNb.

This study might lead to the development of a new treatment against PRRSV derived from App cell culture supernatant. However, more investigations are needed to identify and/or purify the target metabolite(s) secreted by App before generating a possible new antiviral molecule against PRRSV. Moreover, since we have demonstrated that the antiviral effect of the metabolite(s) secreted from App is not only specific to PRRSV, but also effective against other RNA viruses, this antiviral activity might as well lead to a new antiviral treatment. For example, molecules such as Ribavirin, which is currently used against human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [50, 51] and hepatitis C infection [52] , was initially demonstrated to have a broad antiviral activity against animal viruses [53] . This study might therefore allow the development of a new antiviral molecule against PRRSV, but also against other viruses such as influenza.",
