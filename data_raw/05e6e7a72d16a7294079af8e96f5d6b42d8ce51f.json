            "text": "year, methodologies for rapid and on-site detection of influenza viruses are urgently needed. LAMP is the most commonly used nucleic acid isothermal amplification technology suitable for on-site use. However, for multiplex LAMP, differentiation of the amplicons derived from multiple targets is still challengeable currently. Here we developed a multiplex RT-LAMP assay for simultaneous amplification of three prominent subtypes of influenza viruses (A/H5, A/H7 and 2009A/H1). The amplicons were further identified by cascade invasive reaction and nanoparticle hybridization in separate target-specific detection tubes (referred to as mRT-LAMP-IRNH). The analytic sensitivities of the assay are 10 copies of RNA for all the three HA subtypes, and the specificity reached 100%. Clinical specimen analysis showed this assay had a combined sensitivity and specificity of 98.1% and 100%, respectively. Overall, the mRT-LAMP-IRNH assay can be used as a cost-saving method that utilizes a simple instrument to detect A/H5, A/H7, and 2009A/H1 influenza viruses, especially in resource-limited settings.",

However, it requires bulky and expensive equipments, as well as highly skilled technicians, which make these methods not suitable for use in resource limited regions or for field use. Recently, researches have focused on the development of isothermal amplification methods for pathogen detection. As the reaction is conducted under isothermal conditions, it can be carried out with a simple water bath so that a thermal cycler is not required 16 . As the most commonly used isothermal amplification method at present, loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method is rapid and sensitive for amplification of DNA at a constant temperature of 60-65 \u00b0C 17, 18 . Besides targeting DNA templates, LAMP can also be used to amplify RNA template by the use of reverse transcriptase together with DNA polymerase, so-called reverse transcriptase LAMP (RT-LAMP). RT-LAMP methods have been developed to detect various RNA pathogens including influenza viruses [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] .",

At the commencement of this study, we used a real-time turbidimeter enabling observation of primer kinetics to determine the optimal primer sequences, primer concentrations, incubation temperature, as well as incubation time of the multiplex RT-LAMP reaction. The results showed that the optimal multiplex RT-LAMP reaction was obtained with primer sequences shown in Table 1 and the primer concentrations described in Materials and Methods. At 63 \u00b0C, the best amplification efficiency was observed for all the three HA subtypes (A/H5, A/H7 and 2009A/H1), and thus 63 \u00b0C was considered to be optimal temperature for the multiplex RT-LAMP reaction (data not shown). According to the amplification curves obtained by real-time turbidimeter, 50 min was selected as the optimal incubation time. In mRT-LAMP-IRNH, the multiplex RT-LAMP amplicons were further identified by cascade invasive reaction and nanoparticle hybridization in separate target-specific detection tubes. A schematic of the principles of cascade invasive reaction and gold nanoparticle hybridization is shown in Fig. 1 . In the positive reaction, the cleaved hairpin probe cannot trigger the aggregation of AuNPs, leading to a red color of the reaction. Conversely, in the negative reaction, the intact hairpin probe leads to the aggregation of AuNPs, and then the reaction mixture becomes colorless (Fig. 1) . Analytical sensitivity of the mRT-LAMP-IRNH. The analytical sensitivity of the mRT-LAMP-IRNH assay was determined by testing ten-fold serial dilutions of viral RNA transcripts (ranging from 10 4 to10 0 RNA copies) on two separate days. After 50 min of amplification, diluted RT-LAMP products were added into the invasive reaction mixture to perform cascade invasive reactions for each target, then the AuNPs were added for hybridization. The detection limits for all the three HA genes (A/H5, A/H7 and 2009A/H1) were 10 1 copies of synthetic RNA by presenting red color in the reaction tubes as shown in Fig. 2a -c. Identical results were obtained on both days indicating that the mRT-LAMP-IRNH assay was both robust and reproducible.",

The main drawbacks of virus culture are that it can only detect live viruses and requires more time and higher biosecurity. Immunological methods for testing influenza viruses have low skill requirements, but poor sensitivity and specificity. Recently, many molecular diagnostic approaches such as single or multiplex RT-PCR (including real-time RT-PCR) have been developed for subtyping influenza viruses. However, these methods require expensive thermal cycling equipments. Currently, rapid, reliable and affordable point-of-care tests for influenza virus detection are urgently needed, especially in resource limited regions. In this study, we describe a sensitive mRT-LAMP-IRNH assay for the detection of three influenza A viruses (subtypes A/H5, A/H7 and 2009A/H1) for the first time. The read-out can be observed by naked eyes, and no specialized instrument is required, which make this assay especially useful in resource-limited situations such as primary care facilities.",

LAMP products can be detected by agarose gel electrophoresis, turbidity or fluorescence detection 35, 36 , lateral flow dipstick 23 , or even visual inspection 37, 38 . These methods are robust and reliable, but detect total amplification products in a reaction and are thus limited to detection of a single target. Multiplex detection is the development trend of pathogen detection technology due to the properties of cost savings and high efficiency. In order to achieve multiplex LAMP detection, methods based on end point analysis 24,25 as well as real-time detection [26] [27] [28] have been employed to differentiate multiple target sequences, while these strategies all required complicated and specialized instruments. To enable multiplex pathogen detection without the need of specialized instruments, Dou et al. developed a polymer/paper hybrid microfluidic biochip for simultaneous LAMP detection of three meningitis-causing pathogens. Though this assay was not really a multiplex LAMP reaction, by using of microfluidic biochip, three pathogens were simultaneously detected on a chip, and high sensitivity and specificity were achieved within 1 h 39 . In this study, we present an alternative molecular method for multiplex LAMP amplicon detection by combining invader techniques 32,33 and gold nanoparticle probe techniques [29] [30] [31] . AuNPs have been used as a sensor for DNA detection for years. To improve the sensitivity, we coupled invader techniques with gold nanoparticle probe techniques, which were further used to detect multiplex RT-LAMP amplicons for the first time. Although the identification of the multiplex RT-LAMP amplicons is monoplex, the mRT-LAMP-IRNH assay developed in this study is a cost-saving method that requires no complicated instrument, and is more suitable for multiple-target detection of limited amount and/or precious nucleic acids. This pilot study also provides a strategy for establishing multiplex LAMP assay much more than three plex for field use. Meanwhile, unknown clinical specimens with co-infection can also be distinguished without using any equipments.",

LAMP reaction was able to tolerate the inhibitory effect of large amounts of templates, and was less affected by the presence of various salts and inhibitors 42 . In mRT-LAMP-IRNH method, aggregation of AuNPs is achieved by adding hairpin probes complementary to both AuNPs. The cleavage of hairpin probes is triggered by the cleaved flaps from the target-specific primary invasive reaction. Because one LAMP amplicon can yield large numbers of cleaved hairpin probes, the sensitivity of this method is increased significantly. By testing ten-fold serial dilutions of viral RNA transcripts, the analytical sensitivities of the mRT-LAMP-IRNH assay were found to be 10 1 copies of synthetic RNA for all three targets. Previous studies have shown that although multiplex nucleic acid detection tests have the advantage of high efficiency, due to the mutual interference of multiple primers, the analytic sensitivities of these assays tend to decrease. However, through the signal amplification effects of invader techniques and gold nanoparticle probe techniques, the sensitivity of the mRT-LAMP-IRNH assay established in this study was equivalent or even significantly increased as compared to general monoplex LAMP method 23, [43] [44] [45] .

As 120 min might be a little long for field use, we had tried to shorten the invasive reaction and hybridization reaction time, but we found that when the concentration of virus was low, the result might be somewhat ambiguous to the naked eye if the detection time was shortened. In future, we would test more conditions and settings to try to shorten the reaction time, and to combine invasive reaction with hybridization reaction in one step. These would make the assay more timely and practical for field use. In summary, a highly sensitive and specific mRT-LAMP-IRNH assay was developed for the first time in this study which can detect three prominent subtypes of influenza viruses (A/H5, A/H7 and 2009A/H1). The advantages of cost-saving and no requirement of any complicated instrument make this assay more suitable for low-equipment setting laboratory use and for on-site testing.

The 20 \u03bc l invasive reaction was carried out with 0.2 \u03bc M upstream probe, 0.2 \u03bc M downstream probe, 0.2 \u03bc M hairpin probe, 100 ng AfuFEN enzyme which was prepared in our lab as described before 47 , and 5 \u03bc l diluted multiplex RT-LAMP amplification products (20 \u03bc l products plus 30 \u03bc l deionized water) in a reaction buffer containing 10 mM MOPS (pH7.5), 0.05% Tween-20, 0.05% Nonidet P40, and 7.5 mM MgCl 2 . The reactions were run at 85 \u00b0C for 1 min followed by 63 \u00b0C for 20 min. After cascade invasive reaction, 3 \u03bc l of each AuNPs (30 nM), NaCl (500 mM) and water were added in a volume of 30 \u03bc l. Hybridization was performed at 55 \u00b0C for 30 min. The results were observed by naked eyes directly or after briefly centrifuging the products. The positive reaction mixture kept red while the negative reaction mixture became colorless.",

Ten-fold serial dilutions of synthetic RNA transcripts of the three HA genes (avian influenza A/H5, A/H7 and 2009A/H1, ranging from 10 4 to10 0 RNA copies) were used to assess the analytical sensitivity of the mRT-LAMP-IRNH assay. The specificity of the assay was determined by analyzing the RNA extracts from various control viruses mentioned above. Briefly, RNA extracted from influenza viruses A/Nanjing/2/2013(H7N9), A/Jiangsu/1/2007(H5N1), A/Jiangsu/2/2009(H1N1), or each control virus was used as RT-LAMP template, respectively. The amplicons from each RT-LAMP reaction were further identified by cascade invasive reaction and gold nanoparticle hybridization as described before in three separate target-specific detection tubes.",

The methods were carried out in accordance with the Ethical Guidelines for Medical and Health Research Involving Human Subjects. Viral isolates and clinical specimens. Influenza virus strains (A/Nanjing/2/2013 (H7N9), A/ Jiangsu/1/2007(H5N1), and A/Jiangsu/2/2009(H1N1)) isolated from patient samples at Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Prevention and Control were included in the mRT-LAMP-IRNH assay development. Other genetically or clinically related virus isolates including seasonal influenza viruses (A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and B), avian influenza virus A/H9N2, parainfluenza viruses (types 1, 2, 3, and 4), and respiratory syncytial viruses (types A and B) were used as control viruses to assess the specificity of the assay. For methodological evaluation of this study, a total of 84 nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from influenza-like cases. Among these specimens, 48 had been identified positive for influenza A viruses including 18A/H7N9, 2A/H5N1, and 28 2009A/H1N1, and 36 had been identified negative for influenza A viruses. Furthermore, 4 known positive poultry cage surface swabs (2A/H5N1 and 2A/H5N6) were collected from live poultry markets. All these isolates and specimens were stored at \u2212 80 \u00b0C until use. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Prevention and Control. Extraction of viral RNA. Viral RNA was extracted from 200 \u03bc l of samples with a MagNA Pure LC Total Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit on a MagNA Pure TM system (Roche Diagnostics, Manheim, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The extracted RNA was dissolved in 50 \u03bc l elution buffer (pH = 8.0) and kept at \u2212 80 \u00b0C until use. Preparation of transcripts. The HA genes were amplified from three influenza virus strains (A/ Nanjing/2/2013(H7N9), A/Jiangsu/1/2007(H5N1), and A/Jiangsu/2/2009(H1N1)) with primers containing T7 promoter sequence in the reverse sides. PCR amplicons containing the full length region of each gene target for multiplex RT-LAMP were in vitro transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase (TaKaRa Biotechnology Co. Ltd., Dalian, China) according to the manufacturer's instructions.The synthetic RNA transcripts were purified, quantified, and then tenfold diluted ranging from 10 4 to10 0 RNA copies/\u03bc l.",
