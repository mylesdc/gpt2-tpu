Of the 1379 MERS cases recorded during the study period, 321 (23.3%) cases were linked to hospital infection, out of which 203 (14.7%) cases occurred among healthcare workers. ere were 1113 isolated cases while the number of recorded contacts per MERS patient is between 1 (n \ufffd 210) and 17 (n \ufffd 1), with a mean of 0.27 (SD \ufffd 0.76). Five super-important nodes were identified based on their high number of connected contacts worthy of prioritization (at least degree of 5). e number of secondary cases in each SSE varies (range, 5-17). e eigenvector centrality was significantly (p < 0.05) associated with place of exposure, with hospitals having on average significantly higher eigenvector centrality than other places of exposure. Results suggested that being a healthcare worker has a higher eigenvector centrality score on average than being nonhealthcare workers. Pathogenic droplets are easily transmitted within a confined area of hospitals; therefore, control measures should be put in place to curtail the number of hospital visitors and movements of nonessential staff within the healthcare facility with MERS cases.",

In this study, super-spreading was defined as having at least five contacts. SSEs have been documented in other infectious disease outbreaks such as SARS in Beijing 2003 [12] and more recently Ebola in West Africa, 2014-2015 [13, 14] , and MER-CoV in South Korea, 2015 [10] . e knowledge of people's connectivity network is very crucial in the spread of infectious diseases transmitted via pathogenic droplets such as respiratory infection, MERS, and Ebola. As in the case of MERS, occasional larger cluster sizes should not be unexpected, such as the outbreak in South Korea [7] .

Network analysis was used to investigate whether the density of the network contacts of persons infected by Mycobacterium tuberculosis was more likely to be tested positive for tuberculosis (TB) compared to the occurrence of TB clusters detected through network connections with clusters detected by molecular genotyping [18] . Similarly, the effect of protein-protein interactions within the host-pathogen interactome was explored via network analysis on pathogen fitness during infection [19] . e focus of this study was to map and measure relationships and flows between people infected with MERS and to investigate the structure of MERS transmission with the help of network and graphs. Patient's interactions and links were obtained through contact tracing within 14 days prior to the onset of the disease. e structure of network connectivity will assist in identifying the most influential contacts, while network centrality metrics were used to investigate the contribution and characteristics of the agents of super-spreading to the infection and spread of MERS. And lastly, the role played by patient's attributes (node property) was investigated as an epidemic amplifier or attenuator via hypotheses testing.",

We used centrality metrics to measure the structural importance of patients (nodes) in a network. e node \"degree centrality\" was used to reveal the most active nodes in the network and how well a node is connected with its neighbours-a node degree is the number of edge incidents on a node. e \"betweenness centrality\" was used to measure how many pairs of nodes a node can be connected to through a shortest path, while the \"closeness centrality\" was used to measure how contagious an infected patient (a node) is to others [9, 17, 24, 25] . Similarly, \"2-reach centrality\" was used to explore the proportion of nodes that can reach a given node in 2 steps or less while \"eigenvector centrality\" was used to measure the importance of a node depending on the importance of its neighbours. Finally, the effects of patient's attributes on their position in a network (measured by network centrality metrics) were investigated, and the relationship between two (or more) network centrality metrics was explored. We used permutation tests in UCINET 6.0 Version 1.00 [24] to test specifically the following aspects: (1) whether more central patients are HCWs or not, (2) whether more central Figure 3 ).",

Similarly, while it is acknowledged that most reported clusters occurred in the hospital as a result of contact tracing, this is not surprising because of adequate monitoring and data collection in the hospital that revealed large secondary cases in the healthcare facilities. Lastly, as in the case of publicly available data, these study data are characterized by missing data. While the problems associated with inference-drawn, publicly available epidemiological data are acknowledged, the results are meaningful and suggest that structure and characteristics of contact network can indeed have significant effect on the rate of transmission of MERS disease.",

Moreover, the results present rational estimate of the size of outbreak and the underlying structural characteristics of the group [37] . Patients with high degree of centrality played a powerful role as epidemic attenuators. Patients with high degree of centrality played a powerful role as epidemic attenuators as they are linked to many secondary cases that did not produce any further secondary cases of their own. While patients with high betweenness are epidemic amplifiers, they are a pathway to infect other patients. is study has shown that most important nodes are those within the hospital, and healthcare workers are more prone to the infection. Pathogenic droplets are easily transmitted within the confined areas of hospitals, and control efforts should be put in place at different layers of hospitals. Reducing contact formation especially within the hospital by restricting hospital visitation for MERS patient families and reducing the number of healthcare workers with access to MERS patients will certainly have significant effect on the spread of MERS disease. Saudi Arabia is said to be facing continuous risk of MERS outbreaks [26] . If control measures are not put in place to curtail the number of hospital visitors and movements of nonessential staff within healthcare facility, with their connectivity to people within the community, the disease will speed up further national/international outbreaks. Future research should focus on epidemiological analysis exploring the role of a healthcare facility in the spread MERS disease.",
