As a result, implementing sustainable infectious disease surveillance systems in these regions is challenging. The cost of these programs and difficulties associated with collecting, storing and transporting relevant samples have hindered them in the regions where they are most needed. Therefore, we tested the sensitivity and feasibility of a novel surveillance technique called xenosurveillance. This approach utilizes the host feeding preferences and behaviors of Anopheles gambiae, which are highly anthropophilic and rest indoors after feeding, to sample viruses in human beings. We hypothesized that mosquito bloodmeals could be used to detect vertebrate viral pathogens within realistic field collection timeframes and clinically relevant concentrations.",

Our findings revealed that viral nucleic acids, at clinically relevant concentrations, could be detected from engorged mosquitoes for up to 24 hours post feeding by qRT-PCR. Subsequently, we tested this approach in the field by examining blood from engorged mosquitoes from two field sites in Liberia. Using next-generation sequencing and PCR we were able to detect the genetic signatures of multiple viral pathogens including Epstein-Barr virus and canine distemper virus.",

Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) have profound public health and economic consequences as highlighted by the ongoing epidemics of Ebola virus in West Africa [2] , MERS coronavirus in the Middle East [3] , and chikungunya and West Nile viruses in the Americas [4] . The emergence of these diseases can, in large part, be attributed to the increased frequency and duration of human and livestock interactions with wildlife populations [5] . Greater than 60% of EIDs since 1940 are due to zoonotic infections [1] . Biosurveillance efforts now focus on crucial interfaces (i.e. transmission between animals, initial human spillover events and localized emergence) in order to identify pathogens with epidemic and pandemic potential [6, 7] . Yet allocation of resources are not always directed towards predicted emerging disease 'hotspots' like tropical Africa where relatively few EID events have been documented locally [1] . This is mainly due to difficulties in sample collection, storage and transport from remote and underdeveloped parts of the world. Although a wide array of assays exist to detect emerging pathogens (e.g. [8] [9] [10] ), novel and inexpensive methods for sample collection and for pathogen detection are needed to use them most effectively.",

A large majority of these are hematophagous and rely on vertebrate blood for nourishment and reproduction. Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto is the major human malaria vector in Africa. This species is highly anthropophilic (>95% of bloodmeals come from humans when control measures are absent), feeds frequently, and prefers to blood feed at night and often in human dwellings [11] . After blood feeding, these mosquitoes rest on interior walls for several hours digesting their newly acquired bloodmeal before they exit the dwelling. While engorged, their mobility is limited, and it is at this vulnerable point that they can be easily collected via aspiration and bloodmeals analyzed for the presence of pathogens, a process we have termed xenosurveillance. Recently, Kading et al. demonstrated that mosquitoes could be used as 'biological syringes' to accurately quantify viremias in animals [12] . In fact, two recent field studies have demonstrated that vertebrate viral pathogens that are not vector-borne could be detected in the bloodmeals of Culicidae mosquitoes [13, 14] . These findings suggest that hematophagous insects, specifically mosquitoes, could make sample acquisition and pathogen surveillance more tractable in remote tropical locales.",

Therefore, we examined some of these variables and hypothesized that mosquito bloodmeals could be used to detect animal pathogens within realistic field collection timeframes and clinically relevant concentrations. We tested our hypothesis using An. gambiae mosquitoes and, because at least a quarter of human emerging pathogens are viruses [1] , viruses from four evolutionarily distinct families, none of which are vectored by An. gambiae mosquitoes. To make this approach more tractable in remote tropical regions, we preserved the bloodmeals onto Flinders Technology Associates (FTA) filter paper cards for subsequent nucleic acid detection [15] [16] [17] . Finally, we collected An. gambiae bloodmeals from houses in two remote villages in northern Liberia and analyzed them by next generation sequencing (NGS) and PCR to validate our methods. It should be noted that the use of highly anthropophilic An. gambiae mosquitoes may preclude the identification of potentially zoonotic viruses before they cross the species barrier; however, it will enable the detection of pathogens that have already gained the ability to infect humans but that remain undetected due to limited infection and spread, subclinical illness or clinical misdiagnoses. Our results suggest that xenosurveillance can be used in high-risk tropical regions to detect pathogen outbreaks at early stages of emergence.",

Battery powered Insecta-Zooka (BioQuip, Rancho Dominguez, CA) aspirators were used to collect mosquitoes resting on the walls, ceilings and bed nets inside of the village houses (S1A Fig.) . Using mouth aspirators (Model 412; John W. Hock Company, Gainesville, FL), mosquitoes were transferred from the collection cups to 16 oz cardboard containers screened with organdy (and labeled with date and location) and immediately transported to a field lab (S1B Fig.) . For long-term anesthesia, the mosquito cartons were placed inside of a plastic bag container containing a wick dipped in triethylamine for 1-2 min (S1C Fig.) . The mosquitoes were sorted by blood feeding status (S1D Fig.) , and all aspirated mosquitoes were identified as An. gambiae sensu stricto as previously described [24] . Forceps clutching the thorax were used to hold blood fed mosquitoes in place while the contents of the abdomen were pressed onto 96-well format FTA cards (one blood meal per \"well\") using sterile pipet tips (S1E Fig.) . The forceps were cleaned with 70% ethanol between mosquitoes. The blood meals were gently spread using the pipet tip and 2-5 \u03bcl of ethanol was added to help diffuse the blood into the card (5 \u03bcl of sterile PBS is an alternative option, see S2 Fig.) . The FTA cards were sealed immediately in multi-barrier pouches containing desiccant to dry the blood spots (S1F Fig.) . The desiccant was changed every day for three days then the pouches were stored in a cool, dry place for 1-3 weeks until being transported to CSU, whereupon they were stored at -80\u00b0C until RNA extraction. In village A, seven collections occurred every other day for two weeks and each house was aspirated every other collection.

Blood containing approximately 10 6 RNA copies/ml of WNV or HIV-1 were offered to mosquitoes using artificial membrane feeders. At the same time, 2 \u03bcl of the virus-spiked blood (approximate volume of a mosquito bloodmeal) were diluted in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (to determine the pre-blood feed concentration) and applied directly onto FTA cards (to determine the recovery of FTA cards alone). Twelve hours post feeding (hpf) the mosquito bloodmeals were expelled onto FTA cards. WNV and HIV-1 RNA were quantified by qRT-PCR to compare viral RNA recovery ( Fig. 2A) . The concentration of HIV-1 RNA from DBS and M-DBS remained unchanged Virus-specific differences between the efficiency and duration of viral RNA detection from M-DBS. WNV (red) or HIV-1 (blue) were mixed with blood at 10 6 viral RNA copies/ml. (A) The means (shown with SEM) of virus-specific RNA detected directly from 2 \u03bcl of blood-virus mix (not applied to FTA cards), 2 \u03bcl of the blood-virus mix applied to FTA cards and mosquito bloodmeals applied to FTA cards 12 h post feeding (hpf) were compared using a one way ANOVA with Tukey's multiple comparisons adjustment. Application of the blood-virus mix (P = 0.0012) and mosquito bloodmeals (P = 0.0008) to FTA cards resulted in significant losses in WNV RNA detection compared to the original blood-virus mix, but not between the treatments applied to FTA cards. Comparisons between HIV-1 treatments were not significant. (B) WNV or (C) HIV-1 mixed with blood were offered to mosquitoes and the bloodmeals were applied to FTA cards at the indicated times post blood feeding. The blood-virus mixes (2 \u03bcl each) were applied to FTA cards before blood feeding (pre-feed) to compare to viral RNA detection from mosquito dried blood spots (M-DBS). The number of blood spots positive (>10 4 RNA copies/ml) for virus RNA per dried blood spot tested (n = 5) are shown above each time point. The means (shown with SEM) of the post blood feeding time points were compared to the pre-feed using a one way ANOVA with Dunnet's multiple comparisons adjustment. The comparisons were not significant. compared to the pre-blood feed concentration. There were significant losses in WNV RNA recovery from blood applied onto FTA cards (5.4 fold reduction) and mosquito bloodmeals pressed onto FTA cards (11.2 fold reduction and only 4/5 > LLOQ) compared to the pre-feed blood. However, an insignificant reduction was measured between the DBSs and M-DBSs, indicating that the majority of RNA loss was due to WNV storage on FTA cards. There were not significant differences in viral and total RNA recovery between using PBS or ethanol to apply bloodmeals to FTA cards ( S2 Fig). Mosquitoes provided a virus-spiked bloodmeal were sampled over a 24 h period in order to establish the temporal stability of viral RNA in mosquito guts and determine whether degradation of viral RNA in mosquitoes would likely occur prior to mosquito sampling. Mosquitoes were fed blood mixed with approximately 10 6 RNA copies/ml of WNV or HIV-1 and the bloodmeals of engorged mosquitoes were collected on FTA cards at 30 min, 6 h, 12 h, 18 h and 24 h post feeding (n = 5 each). Blood spiked with WNV or HIV-1 (2 \u03bcl, n = 5 each) were applied to FTA cards before being fed to mosquitoes to determine the pre-blood feed virus concentration. RNA copies were quantified from the DBS and M-DBS for all time points pre-and post-blood feeding (Figs. 2B-2C ). The number of M-DBS with detectable amounts of WNV RNA decreased over time. WNV RNA could be detected from all of the M-DBS through 6 hpf, from 4/5 bloodmeals at 12 and 18 hpf and from only 1/5 bloodmeals at 24 hpf (Fig. 2B) . However, the quantity of WNV RNA in positive mosquitoes did not significantly decrease over time. HIV-1 RNA was detected in all the M-DBS tested and the RNA copies remained constant over the 24 hour sampling period (Fig. 2C) . Mosquito bloodmeals older than 24 hpf were considerably more viscous (and darker in color) making them less effectively absorbed into the FTA cards.",

Hamsters were infected with either PIRV or WNV (n = 3 each). Mosquitoes were allowed to feed on the hamsters 2, 4 and 6 days post infection (dpi) and held for 12 hpf before applying the bloodmeals to FTA cards. Prior to mosquito feeding, 2 \u03bcl of blood were collected and applied to FTA cards to quantify viral load at the time of mosquito exposure. WNV RNA could be detected in all of the M-DBS on days 2 and 4 dpi when circulating hamster WNV titers were > 10 6 RNA copies/ ml, but as circulating WNV titers approached or fell below the LLOQ (10 4 viral RNA copies/ ml for 2\u03bcl of blood) at 6 dpi, WNV RNA could be detected in only 6/15 M-DBS (Fig. 3A) . Hamsters infected with PIRV had low circulating titers during early infection (< 10 4 RNA copies/ ml on 2 dpi, <10 6 RNA copies/ml on 4 dpi) and therefore PIRV could only be detected from 1/ 11 and 7/13 M-DBS from 2 dpi and 4 dpi, respectively (Fig. 3B ). On 6 dpi, when the hamster PIRV titers were >10 8 RNA copies/ml, 15/15 M-DBS were positive for PIRV RNA. Data from all of the WNV and PIRV experiments were compiled together to further compare the recovery of viral RNA from mosquitoes taking bloodmeals from artificial membranes and infected hamsters. Ratios of viral RNA titers post blood feeding (mosquito bloodmeals applied onto FTA cards) to pre blood feeding (2 \u03bcl blood applied onto FTA cards) were used to make comparisons between recovery of RNA from artificial and hamster bloodmeals (Fig. 3C) . A ratio <1 indicates a loss of viral RNA recovery through the use of mosquito bloodmeals. From both artificial blood meals and those from infected hamsters, the WNV RNA recovery ratio was <1, indicating that WNV RNA recovery from M-DBS was less efficient than from DBS; although not significantly ( Fig. 2A) . Similarly, M-DBS acquired from actively replicating virus in hamsters did not significantly differ from WNV-spiked blood in an artificial feeder. In contrast, the recovery ratio of PIRV RNA was approximately 1 and also did not differ between the two blood feeding methods (Fig. 3C) . Table text colors represent different hamsters offered as bloodmeals and correspond to the colors in the graphs. (C) Ratios of viral RNA titers (means with min to max whiskers) post blood feeding (M-DBS) to pre blood feeding (2 \u03bcl blood applied to FTA cards) were used were used to determine the recovery of viral RNA from mosquito bloodfeeding. The post/pre blood feeding ratios between virus-spiked artificial and infected hamster bloodmeal sources were compared using unpaired t tests and were not significant. ",

The PathoScope alignment summaries to the reference genome libraries are shown in Table 3 . NGS analysis of the microbial composition in bloodfed An. gambiae collected within homes in rural Liberia revealed the presence of numerous mosquito midgut microbiota (e.g. Acinetobacter and Pantoea) and human skin-associated microbes (e.g. Staphylococcus epidermidis and Propionibacterium acnes) (S3 Fig) , some as detected previously [35] . In addition, genetic signatures for EBV were identified in all eight field-derived M-DBS pools, but not the control pool generated from laboratory mosquitoes that had fed upon defibrinated sheep's blood. Recovered EBV reads were distributed across the length of the genome (Fig. 4) and displayed varying levels of abundance (Table 3) . This result was confirmed by using RT-PCR to detect EBV-encoded RNA 2 (highly abundant EBV transcripts during latent infection [36] ) in all eight pooled M-DBSs from Liberia. Furthermore, we identified signatures of CDV in the M-DBS pool from Village A d7 (Fig. 4) and we confirmed that this was the only pool containing CDV RNA by RT-PCR. Upon further inspection, only 1 of 57 M-DBSs from Village A d7 was positive for CDV and the sequenced 400 bp L gene (polymerase) amplicon was most similar to a South American isolate of CDV (97% nucleotide identity to GenBank accession number KM280689). Genetic material derived from porcine and canine origin was also identified in this pool by NGS. Using cytochrome b PCR, we identified that the M-DBS containing CDV RNA was the only bloodmeal from Village A d7 that was obtained from a dog. Isolation of either of the aforementioned viruses was not attempted because the FTA cards fully inactivate viruses [37, 38] . Library quality and analysis accuracy were validated by the presence of reads aligning to An. gambiae, humans, and Plasmodium falciparum from all fieldcollected sample pools (S3 Fig.) . The presence of P. falciparum in our samples would be expected because malaria is holoendemic in this region and the mosquito, the human upon which it fed, or both may be infected. ",

            "text": "Blood acquisition is an indispensable activity for the reproduction of most mosquito species. An. gambiae mosquitoes imbibe several times their body weight in blood, and they spend several hours immediately following bloodmeal acquisition undergoing the initial stages of bloodmeal digestion [39] . Consequently the mosquito midgut becomes a highly proteolytic environment that facilitates the degradation of the blood contents over approximately the first 24 hours after blood ingestion [40] . Previous studies have demonstrated that vertebrate pathogens, specifically viruses, can be detected in the bloodmeal of recently engorged mosquitoes [12] [13] [14] , but the stability and recovery rates of viral RNA after prolonged exposure to the mosquito midgut was undefined. Therefore, we assessed our ability to recover WNV and HIV-1 RNA from An. gambiae and revealed that 12 hours exposure to the midgut environment did not significantly decrease the recovery of viral RNA. However, we did observe a significant reduction in WNV RNA recovery as a result of blood application onto FTA cards. Surprisingly, a similar reduction was not observed for HIV-1. This discrepancy might be explained by the relative stability of each of the viruses [41, 42] . Alternatively, there may be differences in the efficiency of binding to and/ or elution from FTA cards between the two viral RNA species. These observations may need further examination to determine if biases are being introduced in future sampling efforts. While there are some discrepancies with viral RNA recovery from FTA cards, overall these findings demonstrate that viral RNA remains mostly protected from the highly proteolytic environment of the mosquito midgut and that mosquitoes can be used to sample viral pathogens in human beings.",

            "text": "An. gambiae are nocturnal, endophilic feeders that rest on interior walls for several hours after feeding. As a result engorged mosquitoes can be captured during the early morning hours via aspiration. The elapsed time between bloodmeal acquisition and collection can range anywhere from 4-36 hours post feeding, but is most likely within the 4-14 hpf time-frame. Because of this broad range of times, we assessed the efficacy of our approach over varying postfeeding durations. We found that we could reliably detect WNV RNA in extracted bloodmeals for up to 18 hpf and up to 24 hours for HIV-1. The aforementioned differences in viral stability may account for the observed discrepancy in our detection at 24 hpf [41, 42] . Together these findings suggest that viral RNA remains detectable in the mosquito midgut within a fieldrelevant time-frame. Viral loads circulating in the blood are dynamic and constantly change during an active infection. In addition, viral loads can differ significantly between viral species. Therefore, we determined the detection limits for four different RNA viruses and compared our findings to viral loads in clinically apparent infections [8, [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] . We observed significant differences in our ability to detect each of the four viruses with HIV-1 having the lowest 50% endpoint detection (~10 5 RNA copies/ml) and CHIKV having the highest (~10 7 RNA copies/ml). These large discrepancies between the viruses could in part be explained by potential differences in viral stability or binding to and/ or elution efficiency from FTA cards. Regardless, each of the 50% endpoint detections were well within the clinical ranges for each of the respective viruses [8, [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] . While there may be greater chance to detect chronic viral infections (e.g. HIV-1), our data indicates that there is still a window to detect many acute stage viral infections with mosquitoes.",

Because our artificial feeding approach does not accurately replicate this scenario, we assessed sensitivity using actively replicating virus in hamsters. This is important to determine because cell-associated viral RNA (immature virions or replicative intermediates) could impact the sensitivity of detection. Furthermore, it is unknown if and how cells may affect the stability of viral RNA in the context of the mosquito midgut. In our WNV-and PIRV-hamster models, we determined that bloodmeals derived from actively replicating infections do not significantly impact our ability to detect viral RNA using the xenosurveillance approach. These findings suggest that in the context of the xenosurveillance workflow, artificial membrane feeding of virus spiked blood accurately mimics an active infection thereby validating our in vitro laboratory findings.",

NGS based metagenomics can be used to characterize the genomic landscape of complex biological or environmental samples without a priori knowledge of the microbial community [9] . Therefore, we determined if NGS-directed metagenomics approach could be used to detect pathogen-derived genetic signatures in field-collected samples. We found evidence of two potentially important animal viruses, EBV and CDV. EBV is a highly prevalent gamma-herpesvirus that infects B-lymphocytes and develops latency [36, 43] . Because of its tissue tropism and its associated reactivation during P. falciparum infections, it is not surprising that latent EBV infections of white blood cells would be readily detectable by our approach in a P. falciparum holoendemic region such as Liberia [43] . CDV is a morbillivirus (related to measles virus) and an emerging virus of veterinary significance. Spillover of CDV from domestic dogs has caused mass mortality in endangered African carnivores [44] [45] [46] . Detection of CDV from one mosquito that fed on a dog in a pool of 57 M-DBSs is important for two reasons. First, it demonstrates the sensitivity of using NGS to screen for pathogen signatures in pooled M-DBS. Second, it suggests that xenosurveillance may be useful for the detection of veterinary or zoonotic pathogens in areas where indoor-resting mosquitoes prefer to feed on domestic animals [47, 48] . Currently, the costs associated with NGS are impractically high for resource-poor regions; however, costs have been falling precipitously far outpacing the predictions associated with Moore's Law [49] . In addition to NGS, we demonstrated that viruses and bloodmeal sources could also be detected by more cost efficient PCRbased methods from pooled and individual M-DBSs, further broadening the utility of xenosurveillance.",

            "text": "Biosurveillance is the process of collecting, analyzing, and interpreting biosphere data in order to provide early detection of biological threats to human or animal health. However this process can be labor intensive, complex, costly, and ineffective, particularly in under-developed and remote locales such as tropical Africa. In this manuscript we describe the use of a novel sample acquisition and processing strategy termed xenosurveillance that can be used to improve the collection, storage, and shipment of biological samples from the field. Collecting bloodfed mosquitoes from houses is relatively easy, inexpensive and noninvasive compared to finger-pricks or venous blood draws. These factors may make it ideal for longitudinal sampling surveys and identification of viruses that induce transient viremias. In our experience, villagers welcome taking mosquitoes from their houses frequently, which may reduce their risk of future infections from vector-borne pathogens like Plasmodium. Consent from the head-of-households for mosquito collections is required, but xenosurveillance is not equivalent to sampling blood from patients directly, which requires individual informed consent, because the exact source of any bloodmeal cannot be identified without a matching blood sample from a patient. This is because up to 10% of An. gambiae bloodmeals are acquired from individuals living outside the home in which the mosquito was captured and up 20% have acquired bloodmeals from two or more people [11] . Nonetheless, xenosurveillance identification of the genetic signatures of certain pathogens (eg. HIV) should require, at minimum, notification to the local public health authorities of the possibility of the pathogen circulating in the area of the sampling. Aside from sample acquisition, xenosurveillance also offers benefits when processing samples. For instance, this approach offers increased portability because very few tools/ reagents are required and FTA cards eliminate the need for a cold-chain [15] [16] [17] . Moreover, the chemical properties associated with FTA cards completely inactivates viruses as has been previously demonstrated for two divergent enveloped RNA viruses, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (Arteriviridae) and Newcastle disease virus (Paramyxoviridae) [37, 38] , thereby increasing the safety of handling and simplifying international shipping. While we specifically addressed the utility of this workflow in the context of viral pathogens, the procedure could be applied to any pathogen found circulating in the blood of humans and other animals (although the sensitivity and duration of detection still need to be validated for non-virus pathogens). We have demonstrated the feasibility of this approach and determined the limits of detection using qRT-PCR on individual M-DBS as well as identified vertebrate viral pathogens from field-caught mosquitoes. Regardless of the bio-detection technology utilized, such samples can be used for the early detection of recent spillover events or of pathogens with epidemic potential. Furthermore, previous studies suggest that this approach could be used to complement traditional sero-epidemiological studies [50, 51] . Finally, while this study exclusively examined the utility of mosquitoes for the purpose of xenosurveillance, there is no reason to believe that other hematophagous insects or other animals (e.g. leeches) cannot be used for similar purposes [52, 53] . Together, this approach provides an attractive alternative to conventional approaches for epidemiological and surveillance studies of human pathogens in remote tropical locations. reads from field-collected mosquito bloodmeals determined by PathoScope. Mosquito bloodmeals were collected from village A and village B every 3 days and every 5 or 6 days, respectively, over a course of three weeks in northern Liberia. NGS was performed on RNA pooled from 20-51 M-DBS per collection and the sequencing reads were aligned to the microbial reference libraries using PathoScope. (TIF) S1 ",

(A) The means (shown with SEM) of virus-specific RNA detected directly from 2 \u03bcl of blood-virus mix (not applied to FTA cards), 2 \u03bcl of the blood-virus mix applied to FTA cards and mosquito bloodmeals applied to FTA cards 12 h post feeding (hpf) were compared using a one way ANOVA with Tukey's multiple comparisons adjustment. Application of the blood-virus mix (P = 0.0012) and mosquito bloodmeals (P = 0.0008) to FTA cards resulted in significant losses in WNV RNA detection compared to the original blood-virus mix, but not between the treatments applied to FTA cards. Comparisons between HIV-1 treatments were not significant. (B) WNV or (C) HIV-1 mixed with blood were offered to mosquitoes and the bloodmeals were applied to FTA cards at the indicated times post blood feeding. The blood-virus mixes (2 \u03bcl each) were applied to FTA cards before blood feeding (pre-feed) to compare to viral RNA detection from mosquito dried blood spots (M-DBS). The number of blood spots positive (>10 4 RNA copies/ml) for virus RNA per dried blood spot tested (n = 5) are shown above each time point. The means (shown with SEM) of the post blood feeding time points were compared to the pre-feed using a one way ANOVA with Dunnet's multiple comparisons adjustment.
