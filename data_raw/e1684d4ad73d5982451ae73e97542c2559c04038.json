Therefore, induction of the host tryptophan catabolizing enzyme, indoleamine-2,3-dioxgenase-1 (IDO1), by interferon gamma (IFN\u03b3) is one of the primary protective responses against chlamydial infection. However, despite the presence of a robust IFN\u03b3 response, active and replicating C. trachomatis can be detected in cervical secretions of women. We hypothesized that a primary C. trachomatis infection may evade the IFN\u03b3 response, and that the protective effect of this cytokine results from its activation of tryptophan catabolism in bystander cells. To test this hypothesis, we developed a novel method to separate a pool of cells exposed to C. trachomatis into pure populations of live infected and bystander cells and applied this technique to distinguish between the effects of IFN\u03b3 on infected and bystander cells. Our findings revealed that the protective induction of IDO1 is suppressed specifically within primary infected cells because Chlamydia attenuates the nuclear import of activated STAT1 following IFN\u03b3 exposure, without affecting STAT1 levels or phosphorylation. Critically, the IFN\u03b3-mediated induction of IDO1 activity is unhindered in bystander cells. Therefore, the IDO1-mediated tryptophan catabolism is functional in these cells, transforming these bystander cells into inhospitable hosts for a secondary C. trachomatis infection.",

IFN\u03b3 induces the expression of indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1), an enzyme that catabolizes tryptophan to kynurenine 14,15 . By depleting tryptophan, IDO1 activation curtails the growth of C. trachomatis, which is a tryptophan auxotroph 16 . Under conditions of limited tryptophan availability, the chlamydial life-cycle deviates from normal development to form an aberrant, viable but non-cultivable, growth form termed persistence 17,18 . Renewal of tryptophan availability can reactivate persistent forms to return to normal development 19 . However, when initial levels of tryptophan are already limiting, IFN\u03b3 exposure can block all development, including the onset of persistence 20 . Curiously, although IFN\u03b3 inhibits the growth of C. trachomatis in cells that are pre-depleted of tryptophan in vitro, the developmental cycle of C. trachomatis serovar D exhibits a moderate resistance to the effects of IFN\u03b3",

It is likely these protective effects rely on the prevention of secondary infections. This is evidenced by multiple studies indicating that pre-treatment of host cells with interferons blocks the subsequent replication of a pathogen, even if it possesses effectors to evade such responses 33, 34 . Therefore, while pathogens may circumvent the effects of interferons during primary infection, infection spread may be limited by the effects of interferons on uninfected bystander cells in the infected microenvironment. These observations may be relevant to chlamydial infections in vivo. Histological evidence from infected human tissues revealed a small number of infected cells to be surrounded by large numbers of uninfected-bystander cells 35, 36 . Therefore, even if C. trachomatis possesses a mechanism to block the effect of IFN\u03b3 on an ongoing primary infection, the effects of the cytokine on bystander cells would block infection spread, consistent with overwhelming evidence that IFN\u03b3 is critical to control chlamydial infections in vivo.",

Staining results indicated that >95% of the FITC-positive cells were LPS-positive; likewise, >95% of the FITC-negative cells were also LPS-negative (Fig. 1F) . Therefore CPP-labeled EBs can be used to sort a mixed pool of C. trachomatis-exposed cells into pools of live infected and bystander cells that are >95% pure. Analyses of sorted populations indicate that the IFN\u03b3-induced expression of IDO1 is attenuated in infected cells. The IFN\u03b3-induced enzyme, indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase-1 (IDO1), catabolizes tryptophan into kynurenine, and is proposed to be the primary mediator of the IFN\u03b3-induced protective response against chlamydial infection. Pre-treatment of epithelial cells with IFN\u03b3 at low concentrations results in tryptophan depletion and the induction of persistent chlamydial growth forms 17 . While characterizing the effect of IFN\u03b3 on chlamydial growth in A2EN cells at 38 hpi, it was observed to not substantially impair infection or normal development if it was added at the time of infection ( Fig. 2A,B) . Consistent with these observations, IFU recovery 48 hpi after infection of A2EN cells indicated a modest decrease when IFN\u03b3 was added at the time of infection (Fig. 2D) . In contrast, no recoverable IFUs were obtained at 48 hpi when A2EN cells were pre-treated (A) A schematic representation of the labeling and isolation protocol. A2EN cells were exposed to CPP-labeled C. trachomatis EBs, and subsequently separated into infected and bystander pools by flow cytometry. (B) MOMP staining (Texas Red) performed at 38 hpi reveal labeled EBs to form inclusions in A2EN cells that are indistinguishable from control EBs. Cells were counterstained with DAPI, and images were acquired using a 40 \u00d7 objective. (C) Equal IFUs for labeled and control EBs infected equivalent fractions of exposed A2EN cells indicating that labeling does not affect infectivity. Infection was quantified by LPS staining. (D) Growth curves of control and labeled EBs after infections of A2EN cells indicate that infections initiated using labeled EBs develop at the same rate as those initiated with control EBs. IFU recovery at the indicated times post-infection were measured by infection of HeLa 229 cells. (E) The upper panel shows flow cytometric analyses of mockinfected A2EN cells (gray histogram), and A2EN cells exposed to C. trachomatis (green histogram). Chlamydiainfected cells were sorted into CPP-positive and CPP-negative pools using the gating strategy indicated by the red markers. The lower panels display histograms indicating the sorting efficiency. 95% of CPP-positive and CPP-negative pools display fluorescence profiles that lie within the gates used to isolate them. with IFN\u03b3 (Fig. 2C,D) . These observations are consistent with published reports that C. trachomatis serovar D infections of HeLa cells are moderately resistant to the effects of IFN\u03b3 21 . Therefore, we considered it possible that C. trachomatis interfered with the induction of IDO1 by IFN\u03b3, or with IDO1 function. This hypothesis was explored by using the CPP to isolate pure populations of live infected and bystander cells after culture in the presence or absence of IFN\u03b3.",

Briefly, association of IFN\u03b3 with its receptor (IFNGR) results in the activation of STAT1 by the JAK1/JAK2 kinases. Activated STAT1 translocates to the nucleus, where it transactivates expression of the IDO1 gene whose promoter contains cognate STAT1 binding sites [37] [38] [39] [40] .

STAT1 must be accessible to the JAK1/JAK2 kinases for it to be phosphorylated in response to IFN\u03b3. After its phosphorylation, activated STAT1 must translocate to the nucleus to activate IFN\u03b3-responsive promoters. For this reason, aberrations in the sub-cellular distribution of STAT1 prior to and after IFN\u03b3 exposure are predicted to affect IDO1 expression. Therefore, we examined the sub-cellular distribution of STAT1 in bystander and infected cells in the absence or presence of IFN\u03b3. As reported for other cell types 42 , STAT1 displayed a broad nucleo-cytoplasmic distribution when A2EN cells were cultured in the absence of IFN\u03b3 (Supporting Figure S2 ). Addition of IFN\u03b3 caused STAT1 to accumulate in the nuclei of bystander but not infected cells (Fig. 5B, Supporting Figure S2 ). We quantified the effect of IFN\u03b3 on STAT1's distribution in nuclear and Mockinfected or C. trachomatis-exposed A2EN cells were harvested and stained for surface IFNGR. After this, they were fixed, permeabilized, and stained for LPS. Bystander cells are IFNGR + /LPS\u2212, while infected cells are double-positive. Cells were stained at 24 hpi. LPS staining intensity is shown on the X-axis, and IFNGR staining intensity is on the Y-axis. were examined by immunoblot in mock-infected, bystander \"B\", and infected \"I\" cells in the absence \"\u2212\" or presence \"+\" of IFN\u03b3 (600 U/mL). IFN\u03b3 treatment induced STAT1 levels in bystander and infected cells. A \u03b2-actin loading control is shown. (B) IFN\u03b3 efficiently induces STAT1 nuclear translocation in bystander but not infected cells. A2EN cells were plated on coverslips and exposed to IFN\u03b3 (600 U/mL) beginning at the time of infection. Coverslips were fixed and stained for STAT1 and LPS at 38 hpi. Hoechst dye was used for counter-staining. Examples of two bystander and infected cells are shown. The entire fields containing these cells are shown in Supporting Figure S4 , along with experiments conducted in the absence of IFN\u03b3. Images were obtained using a 63X objective.

Cells were counter-stained with Hoechst dye. As observed earlier, pSTAT1 nuclear localization is attenuated within infected cells of which an example is shown. No attenuation is observed in bystander cells. (B) Cells were pre-treated with IFN\u03b3 (300 U/mL) for 24 hours, then infected and maintained in IFN\u03b3 (600 U/mL) for 24 hpi. Processing and staining was performed as described for panel A. Under these conditions, pSTAT1 was observed to be nuclear within infected cells, of which an example is shown here, and also bystander cells (shown in Supporting Figure S9 ).

Such differences between bystander and infected cells are not unique to the IFN\u03b3 response. Previous studies examining cell surface proteins indicated that the NK cell ligand, MIC-A, is upregulated on infected but not bystander cells 52 . Therefore, while we have used it to probe responses to IFN\u03b3, our approach will be of general utility to discern differences between infected and bystander cells. Currently, studies requiring a pool of mostly-infected cells rely on infections performed with an m.o.i that is sufficiently high to infect the majority of cells exposed to Chlamydia. Indeed, our finding that the IFN\u03b3-induced expression of IDO1 is suppressed within infected cells was confirmed using conditions in which >95% of Chlamydia-exposed cells were infected. This suppression was not observed when only 25% of cells in the exposed pool were infected. Although infections using high m.o.i have been informative, they do not reveal the contributions of bystander cells toward host defenses against infection. This is especially relevant because histological examination of Chlamydia-infected animal and human tissues reveal a small number of infected cells to be surrounded by large numbers of uninfected bystander cells 35, 36, 53 .",

A single cell analysis to evaluate the NF\u03baB-dependent induction of IL-8 after infection by Shigella flexneri uncovered dramatic differences between infected and bystander cells 54 . Although the NF\u03baB-dependent induction of IL-8 was downmodulated in Shigella infected cells, NF\u03baB activation and IL-8 expression were amplified in uninfected bystander cells (ibid). Protective immune responses dependent on bystander cells have also been described for the intracellular pathogens Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella typhimurium (ibid). While they differ mechanistically, these findings coincide with our observations that the effect of IFN\u03b3 on bystander cells limits the spread of a primary Chlamydia infection in vitro. Bystander cells are also likely to mediate proinflammatory responses associated with C. trachomatis pathology. Paradoxically, although there is strong evidence that NF\u03baB responses are inhibited in Chlamydia-infected cells in vitro 4, 5, 55 , animal and human studies indicate that a proinflammatory response is a hallmark of C. trachomatis pathogenesis [reviewed in 56 ] . Akin to S. flexneri, bystander cells in the C. trachomatis-infected microenvironment may drive this proinflammatory response. From a broader perspective, studies with multiple intracellular pathogens emphasize the need to elucidate bystander cell contributions to infection dynamics and outcomes. The method we have developed to isolate live infected and bystander cells provides a powerful tool to investigate the mechanisms by which bystander cells modulate the Chlamydia infection microenvironment.",

The observation that NF\u03baB-dependent transcriptional responses are downmodulated within infected cells was previously attributed to its cleavage by the chlamydial CPAF 5 and/or TSP proteases 4 . Recent studies in which infected cell extracts were prepared under conditions where CPAF was inactive during cell lysis indicated that the p65 subunit of NF\u03baB is not cleaved by a chlamydial protease within intact cells 57 . Therefore, although NF\u03baB activity is reduced within infected cells, this reduction can no longer be attributed to its cleavage by a chlamydial protease. A reduction in NF\u03baB activity would also be observed if the capacity of Chlamydia to block nuclear accumulation of activated STAT1 extended to NF\u03baB. A possible block to NF\u03baB nuclear import in Chlamydia-infected cells is not without precedent. Enteropathogenic E. coli and Shigella secrete T3 effectors that prevent the nuclear translocation of NF\u03baB 58 .",

The inhibitory mechanisms used by these pathogens fall into four broad categories. The first involves downmodulation of IFNGR, which renders Listeria monocytogenes-infected macrophages refractory to IFN\u03b3 25 ; The second uses STAT1 degradation as exhibited by Leishmania donovani 41 . The third category, inhibition of STAT1 activation, is used by Chikungunya virus 26 . The fourth involves the inhibition of activated STAT1 nuclear import and can be seen in infections by Ebola virus 28 , porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus 30 and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 32 . The Ebola virus expressed protein, VP24, binds the same domain of KPNA1 as STAT1. Association of VP24 with KPNA1 displaces STAT1, thereby preventing its nuclear localization 28 . The Nsp1b protein of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus disrupts STAT1 nuclear localization by degrading KPNA1 30 . The ORF6 protein of the SARS coronavirus inhibits STAT1 nuclear localization by a mechanism that has not been completely elucidated. ORF6 sequesters karyopherin \u03b12 and it is proposed that sequestration affects the cellular environment necessary for KPNA1 function 32 .",

Upon reaching a confluence of ~70-80%, the cells were mock or C. trachomatis-infected at an m.o.i of 3. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at 24 or 40 hpi, and processed for immunostaining using the primary and secondary antibodies for proteins being assessed. Antibodies used are described in Table 2 . Pre-chilled acetone-methanol (1:1) was used to permeabilize cells for STAT1 or phosphorylated STAT1 detection. To detect phospho-STAT1, cells were fixed using pre-warmed fixation buffer (BD Biosciences) for 10 minutes at 37 \u00b0C . The cells were then permeabilized using chilled Perm Buffer III (BD Biosciences) for 30 minutes at -20 \u00b0C . Nuclei and inclusions were counterstained using DRAQ5 (Thermo Scientific), or Hoechst 33342 as described previously. Wide-field fluorescence images were acquired using an inverted Zeiss AxioObserver AX10 microscope, equipped with an AxioCam MRm camera, and controlled using AxioVision version 4.6.3. Images were acquired using the 20X, 40X and 63X objectives. Only on images acquired with the 63X objective (N.A. = 1.4) were quantified. For immunofluorescence, acquisition times were determined using a positive control, and kept constant for all samples in the same experiment. Minimally, five fields were acquired per slide, and slides from at least two independently performed experiments were used to quantify experimental outcomes.",

Using 10 cells, the average cell depth was estimated to be 7.4 microns in the area corresponding to the nuclear circumference. Non-thresholded stacks of the 10 nuclei indicated the average nucleus height to be 6.1 microns. After determining these values, all images were acquired as stacks containing 35 z-sections spaced 0.2 microns apart. Acquired images were processed using Fiji (ImageJ) 64 .

Successful spread of a Chlamydia infection requires normal bacterial replication within the initially infected cells, release of EBs, and their subsequent infection of surrounding cells. Our observation that IFN\u03b3-dependent responses, such as the induction of IDO1, are not affected in bystander cells suggests a critical role for these cells in limiting the spread of infection. Our model is also supported by previous observations that pre-exposing cells to IFN\u03b3 inhibits C. trachomatis development more effectively than when IFN\u03b3 exposure is begun concurrent with infection 21 .",
