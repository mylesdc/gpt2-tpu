            "text": "Using peptide nanoparticle technology, we have designed two novel vaccine constructs representing M2e in monomeric (Mono-M2e) and tetrameric (Tetra-M2e) forms. Groups of specific pathogen free (SPF) chickens were immunized intramuscularly with Mono-M2e or Tetra-M2e with and without an adjuvant. Two weeks after the second boost, chickens were challenged with 107.2 EID50 of H5N2 low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) virus. M2e-specific antibody responses to each of the vaccine constructs were tested by ELISA. Vaccinated chickens exhibited increased M2e-specific IgG responses for each of the constructs as compared to a non-vaccinated group. However, the vaccine construct Tetra-M2e elicited a significantly higher antibody response when it was used with an adjuvant. On the other hand, virus neutralization assays indicated that immune protection is not by way of neutralizing antibodies. The level of protection was evaluated using quantitative real time PCR at 4, 6, and 8 days postchallenge with H5N2 LPAI by measuring virus shedding from trachea and cloaca. The Tetra-M2e with adjuvant offered statistically significant (P < 0.05 ) protection against subtype H5N2 LPAI by reduction of the AI virus shedding. The results suggest that the self-assembling polypeptide nanoparticle shows promise as a potential platform for a development of a vaccine against AI.",

            "text": "Avian influenza (AI) is a devastating poultry disease with serious economic consequences to the commercial poultry industry. AI is also a significant public health concern because of recent highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza outbreaks causing also human deaths in Asia, Europe, and North Africa. According to the world health organization (WHO) update, 2011, since 2003, 520 confirmed cases of human infection with H5N1 have been reported, of which 307 died due to disease complications. However, other avian influenza viruses including low-pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) can also be a risk to public health. For instance, the LPAI subtype H9N2 infection in chickens is mild to asymptomatic and easily overlooked. However, it shares similar receptor binding epitopes with human influenza viruses and can infect humans [1] . There is a risk for LPAI subtypes H5 and H7 to become high-pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses in chickens due to constant virus shedding and transmission to new birds within the flock or neighboring flocks [2, 3] . Vaccination is an effective way for prevention of viral diseases in poultry. However, routine vaccination against AI has not been widely practiced throughout the world mainly for surveillance reasons [1, 2] . When there is the desire for routine vaccination, constant 2 Influenza Research and Treatment reformulation of AI vaccines is required according to the circulating field virus, which can be cumbersome in the case of an immediate outbreak. Current vaccines against AI viruses can reduce mortality, clinical signs, shedding, and transmission of the virus in poultry, but they are not capable of preventing infection and virus replication [4] .",

The external domain of matrix protein 2 (M2e) has been one of the main interests for the generation of a universal AI vaccine. The M2e is encoded by a separate open reading frame of segment 7 of the influenza virus genome, is located in the viral envelope, and projects from the surface of the virus as tetramers [5, 6] . The M2 is composed of 97 amino acids which forms 3 domains: the external domain, the transmembrane domain, and the internal domain. The external domain of M2 (M2e) is recognized by the host's immune system [7] [8] [9] . Initially, vaccination of ferrets with whole M-or M2-expressing recombinant vaccinia virus showed no evidence of protection [10] . However, later vaccine constructs using plasmid and recombinant salmonella expressing M or M2 induced significant protection in terms of reduction in virus growth and mortality in mice and chickens, respectively [11] [12] [13] . A multiple antigenic peptide construct containing M2e (M2e-MAP) induced strong M2especific antibody titers in the serum of mice and resulted in significant protection against influenza virus challenge [13] . Liang et al., 1994 [14] showed the importance of CD4 + T cells for nasal resistance and protection against the virus. It is assumed that M2e-specific memory T h cells also may have an important role in protection against the virus in the nose and trachea of mice [13] . De Filette et al., 2005 [15] used the hepatitis B virus core particle (HBc) as a carrier and fused M2e (conserved region of human influenza A virus) to either the C-terminus of HBc or inserted it in the immune-dominant loop of HBc. Immunization of mice with this M2e-HBc vaccine was 100% protective against lethal challenge [15] [16] [17] .",

Therefore, usually a larger carrier protein, such as bovine serum albumin (BSA), keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH), or a virus-like particle (VLP), is required for optimal immunogenicity [18] . Structural organization of the epitope on the carrier is critical for inducing stronger immune responses. Denis et al., 2007 [19] demonstrated that a monomeric form of M2e peptide was not immunogenic and Huleatt et al., 2008 [20] tried to solve that problem by adding 4 copies of the M2e peptide in their platform. Here, we used peptide nanoparticles as a platform to display the M2e peptide to the host's immune system. These nanoparticles represent a novel type of repetitive antigen display system which allows presenting the M2e peptide in high density in both, either in its monomeric or its tetrameric form.",

After the in vitro transcription reaction at 37 \u2022 C for 1 h, the possible remaining plasmid DNA was digested by DNase I and purified RNA was quantified with a spectrophotometer NanoDrop ND-1000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Wilmington, DE). The copy numbers of purified RNA were determined using a previously described method [27] and was used for the generation of a real time standard curve.",

The capsids of spherical viruses often have icosahedral symmetry, due to their need to build a large encapsulating structure from many copies of the same, or only few, capsid proteins. An icosahedron is the most efficient way to accomplish this. By utilizing pentameric and trimeric coiled coils, we have built a self-assembling nanoparticle which uses the threefold and fivefold symmetry of an icosahedrons [21] . The pentameric coiledcoil motif of the monomer is taken from Cartilage Oligomeric Matrix Protein (COMP) and the trimer is a de novo designed coiled coil. Self-assembly occurs when the coiled-coil domains of different monomers associate, forming the icosahedral nanoparticle ( Figure 1 ). A nanoparticle with this sort of architecture can then be used as a vaccine platform by extending the ends of the monomer with an epitope sequence. The Mono-M2e species of nanoparticle follows this plan ( Table 1) . As a result, it repetitively displays a monomeric form of M2e on the surface of the nanoparticles. The M2e peptide on the icosahedral nanoparticles lacks its C-terminal five residues to avoid problems with disulfide crosslinking that presumably require the native tetrameric conformation for proper formation. Although the simplest icosahedral particle with T1 icosahedral symmetry is made from 60 polypeptide chains, it may also be possible that Mono-M2e particles possess higher triangulation numbers, resulting in particles with an even greater molecular mass.",

Hence, to elicit conformationally specific antibodies, the M2e antigen displayed by a vaccine particle should ideally be tetrameric. With that in mind, we designed the Tetra-M2e peptide ( Table 1) . Instead of a pentameric coiled coil, this polypeptide uses the tetrameric coiledcoil motif from the protein tetrabrachion [29] . Self-assembly using this peptide would result in a nanoparticle with threefold and fourfold symmetry axes or octahedral symmetry. As opposed to the larger icosahedral Mono-M2e, this octahedral particle would only have 24 polypeptide chains. In addition, the epitope is now constrained to its native tetrameric conformation. The full-length M2e contains two cysteine residues. The formation of disulfide bridges between the cysteines of adjacent chains under oxidizing conditions is thought to stabilize their tetrameric conformation. The speed and ease of protein expression and purification, as well as of the self-assembly process, contribute to the overall viability of this technology as a vaccine platform.

In this case, the tetrameric version of GCN4 was used [30] . By affixing M2e to a tetrameric protein, we can constrain it in its tetrameric conformation. The effect is similar to that experienced by the ends of the tetrameric coiled coil from tetrabrachion of the Tetra-M2e nanoparticle. However, the coiled coil sequence is different.

Chickens after each inoculation developed high levels of antibody against the injected construct and anamnestic response clearly was seen when the plates were coated with Mono-M2e and Tetra-M2e nanoparticles and M2e-GCN4 (tetrameric M2e), respectively (Table 1, Figures 7 and 8) . For further investigation of the antibodies, the level of M2e specific antibody was measured using plates coated with tetrameric M2e-GNC4 peptide to evaluate the specific antibody against tetrameric M2e rather than the whole particle. The result of this study indicated that in chickens, after the second booster, the antibody levels are not at the same level as our previous results in mice with the same backbone but a different (malaria) epitope had been shown [23] . The dose level was also higher than what was shown to be required in mice. This could be because of the lower haplotype-specific immunogenicity of the particles in chickens, the route of administration in mice (intraperitoneal and intranasally), the body weight of the mice compared with chickens, and different immune system repertoires of mammalian and avian species. In future studies, changing the administration route can be another approach to reducing the dose of vaccine construct. We also coated the plate with inactivated purified virus to observe seroconversion of the chickens after challenge with the virus at 2 weeks after the last boost. Results indicated that whole virus response was higher as expected with hyperimmune serum (Figure 9 (a)), however, ELISA response from chicken vaccinated with tetra-M2e and with whole virus reacted similarly on GCN-M2e coated plate (Figure 9(b) ). The protective efficacy of the anti-M2e antibody responses induced by different constructs was assessed by evaluation of viral shedding post challenge. To determine the peak of shedding, viral copy number was Figure 10 . We determined viral loads in tracheal and cloacal swabs samples on day 8 following challenge with 10 7.2 EID 50 LPAI subtype H5N2. Reduction of cloacal and oropharyngeal shedding in vaccinated birds was significant in chickens vaccinated with Tetra-M2e with Freund's adjuvant. Virus shedding was evaluated at day 4 and day 6 after challenge; the swabs were tested for virus load ( Figure 11 ). It is seen that virus shedding reduction starts at day 4 post infection with a significant decrease at day 8 post infection.",

Chickens immunized with Tetra-M2e that harbors the tetrameric M2e with Freund's adjuvant showed a clear reduction in cloacal and tracheal excretion of LPAI compared to challenge control groups. The results of immunization with Mono-M2e with adjuvant and Tetra-M2e without adjuvant were also promising and by improving both B-and T-cell epitopes of those constructs, desirable results may be obtained. In vaccine design, repetitive Bcell epitope display is considered a strategy for improving the humoral immune response [33, 34] . In addition to repetitive antigen display on the nanoparticle, we were able to present M2e in its native tetrameric conformation. The correlation between high protection and antibody response specific for tetrameric M2e elicited by Tetra-M2e supports our assumption of tetrameric M2e presentation. The results of our studies show that tetrameric M2e stimulates a more specific immune response compared to the monomeric presentation and induces a significant protection against homologous virus challenge. The fact that a large portion of the antibody response is directed against the carrier and not only against the epitope(s) (Figures 7 and 8) can be explained by the fact that significant portions of the core of the nanoparticles are also exposed to the immune system (compare Figure 1) and hence, these portions will also induce a significant immune response.",

These can describe an efficient delayed clearance of the virus in M2e vaccinated chickens based on the previously described NK cell involvement in ADCC [35] . Significant improvement of virus clearance in vaccinated chickens with tetrameric M2e may be considered in a new vaccination strategy by vaccinating chickens with both a killed vaccine and a nanoparticle vaccine in order to provide robust protection, cross-reactive immunity, and clearance in case of emerging new strains of the virus.",

Thereby, especially in the case of HPAI infection, the vaccination may make the infection less visible and the eradication of virus more difficult, and consequently it may provide a good opportunity for HPAI virus to survive and persist in poultry flocks for a long time. For this reason, we plan to design new nanoparticle constructs that also contain fragments of hemagglutinin in addition to the M2e domain. Immunization would then result in the generation of neutralizing hemagglutinin-specific antibodies in addition to the disease modulating M2e-specific antibodies.",

Further designing and testing of new nanoparticle vaccines should demonstrate that they are effective tools for stimulation of an immune response against M2e and other B-or T-cell epitopes. Therefore, application of the nanoparticle platform facilitates the development of a new generation of vaccines that harbor conserved epitopes of avian influenza viruses and would not be rendered ineffective by viral mutations such as antigenic shifts and drifts. The nanotechnology described here offers the opportunity to rapidly produce new vaccines according to the emergence of new strains of influenza virus without going through the time-consuming steps of production currently used in manufacturing commercial influenza vaccines. For future studies, the chicken's LPAI infection model needs to be improved to evaluate clinical signs and higher virus shedding. This may help to better evaluate virus shedding, specifically cloacal virus shedding. Also, vaccination and HPAI challenge may be used to evaluate the vaccine efficiency in protection against high-pathogenicity AI viruses.",

Briefly, thirty 2-week-old SPF chickens were divided into 3 groups of ten and were bled for baseline serology and transferred to isolators equipped with HEPA filters. At 8 weeks of age, chickens were inoculated both intranasally and intraocularly with 0.2-1 mL diluted allantoic fluid depending on the treatment group. Chickens in the low-dose challenge group received a 0.2 mL diluted allantoic fluid containing 10 6 EID 50 , whereas the high-dose challenge group received 1 mL of allantoic fluid containing 10 7.7 EID 50 . The third group of chickens remained in a separate isolator as a negative control. Tracheal and cloacal swabs were collected at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 14 days postinfection using BD Universal Viral Transport (UVT) Kits (Becton, Dickinson, NJ) and Universal Viral Transport Polyester Swabs (Becton, Dickinson, NJ).",

Briefly, in a pilot study chickens were infected with 10 6 EID 50 and 10 7.7 EID 50 of the virus and by using real time RT-PCR, tracheal and cloacal virus shedding was evaluated at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 14 days postinfection. The 10 7.7 EID 50 was found to be a good indicator of virus shedding. First, a significant (P < 0.05) rise in tracheal and cloacal virus shedding was observed at days 4 and 8 postinfection with a magnified peak of tracheal shedding at 8 days postinfection. Taking into account these results, in the vaccination and challenge trial, individual tracheal and cloacal swabs were collected at 4, 6, and 8 days after challenge for better determination of protection. The results of the real-time RT-PCR testing of cloacal and tracheal swab samples taken on day 8 after vaccination and challenge study are shown in",
