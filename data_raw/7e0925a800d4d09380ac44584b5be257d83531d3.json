            "text": "Background. In Morocco, pediatric pneumonia remains a serious public health problem, as it constitutes the first cause of mortality due to infectious diseases. e etiological diagnosis of acute respiratory tract infections is difficult. erefore, it is necessary to use Multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction assay tests in a routine setting for exact and fast identification. Objectives. In this paper, we present the clinical results of pediatric pneumonia and describe their etiology by using molecular diagnosis. Study design: Tracheal secretion was collected from infants presenting respiratory distress isolated or associated with systemic signs, attending the unit of Neonatology between December 1, 2016, and Mai 31, 2018. Samples were tested with the multiplex RespiFinder \u00ae SMART 22 FAST which potentially detects 18 viruses and 4 bacteria. Results. Of the 86 infants considered in this study (mean age 31 \u00b1 19 days) suspected of acute respiratory tract infections, 71 (83%) were positive for one or multiple viruses or/and bacteria. e majority of acute respiratory tract infections had a viral origin (95%): respiratory syncytial viruses (A and B) (49%), rhinovirus (21%), coronaviruses 229E (11%), humain metapneumovirus (5%), influenza A (3%), influenza H1N1 (1%), adenovirus (2%), and parainfluenza virus type 4 (2%). Among our patients, 6% had Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Coinfections were not associated with severe respiratory symptoms. Conclusion. e clinical spectrum of respiratory infections is complex and often nonspecific. us, the early and fast detection of related causative agents is crucial. e use of multiplex real time polymerase chain reaction may help choose an accurate treatment, reduce the overall use of unnecessary antibiotics, preserve intestinal flora, and decrease nosocomial infection by reducing the length of hospitalization.",

In Morocco, pediatric pneumonia remains a serious public health problem and constitutes the first cause of mortality due to infectious diseases [2] . Pneumonia is a major cause of childhood morbidity and mortality worldwide. e WHO estimates that the 1.4 million children who die annually are under 5 years of age, where the greatest risk of death is in the neonatal period [3] . e epidemiology and etiology of pneumonia vary from country to country and from region to region. In developing countries, the incidence of pneumonia among children under 5 years of age is 0.29 episodes per child/year, compared to 0.05 episodes per child/year in developed countries [4, 5] .",

At Children's Hospital in Rabat CHR, RTIs are frequent, especially the acute lower RTIs; they represented a large proportion of all-cause consultations [2] . erefore, their precise diagnosis is necessary [19] .

Our results are similar to those of other studies conducted among children and infants [35, 36] . Our etiological results coincide with those of a study realized at Toulouze University Hospital among children suffering from ARIs; there samples were analyzed using the RespiFinder 15 assay, the prevalence of virus was 88.7% and the RSV was the most frequently detected 39.5% [9] . Regarding bacteria, only 6% of our patients had Mycoplasma pneumoniae, while 81% of the cases have been treated with antibiotic. e low prevalence of bacteria may be explained by the use of antibiotics as an urgent act used in cases suspected with ARTs. Beckmann and Hirsch detected Mycoplasma pneumoniae in 2.1% among pediatric and adult patients [36] .",

Bruijnesteijn van Coppenraet et al. reported that the molecular assays revealed a high frequency of double infections. Specifically, coronaviruses (75%), RSV (58%), and RV (46%) were frequently detected as mixed infection [8] . e current study shows coinfection in 31% of positive samples, with a high frequency in the combinations between RSV/rhino and RSV/Cor229E. Several studies had pointed out that clinical severity is associated with coinfection with more than one virus [8, 37, 38] . Another study reported that coinfection was not associated with an increase in the clinical severity [39] . Our results did not show a significant difference in clinical severity between coinfection and single infection. Also, clinical presentation of different causative agents was often similar. e association of viral detection with clinical characteristics shows a predominance of respiratory signs specially (dyspnea, polypnea, cyanosis, labored breathing, wheezing, and Rhonch). Our clinical symptoms and signs concurred with those of the study realized by Singh S et al. among infants aged less than 2 months [40] .",
