            "text": "IN 1992, OUR LABORATORY was one of the pioneers on the use of in vivo DNA-expressed proteins to elicit protective immune responses. As with many novel concepts, this ''radical'' method of vaccination met with skepticism and doubt. Jenner self-published his use of variolation to protect against smallpox because the Royal Society considered that they might damage the Society's reputation by publishing his findings in the Proceedings of the Royal Society. 1 So too, the idea of using DNA as a vaccine was first considered questionable. However, convincing experimental evidence from our laboratory and others over the past 25 years has demonstrated the powerful potential of this method for immunization and contributed to the use of in vivo expression of DNA-encoded proteins for gene therapy, cancer immunotherapy, and monoclonal antibody production. [2] [3] [4] The development of live vaccinia virus as an expression vector and its use as a vaccine in 1982 generated interest in the use of viral vectors for vaccination. 5, 6 Recognizing the potential of this method and possible extension to avian diseases, our group inserted the gene for avian influenza hemagglutinin, the major target for protective antibody, into a replication-competent avian retrovirus vector. 7 Transfection of the recombinant retroviral vector into chick embryo fibroblasts resulted in production of the vector and expression of the influenza hemagglutinin insert for >2 weeks. In experiments conducted in collaboration with Rob Webster of St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital (which had the appropriate BSL3 laboratory for testing avian influenza virus infections in chickens), the retroviral vector-based vaccine completely protected chickens against a lethal influenza virus challenge. 7 In contrast, birds within the control group succumbed to influenza. Given this, we next tested an infectious, replication-defective pseudotype of the retroviral vector for the ability to provide protection. This replication-defective pseudotype, despite inoculating <1 \u00b7 10 6 infectious units, also achieved 100% protection, demonstrating that even low titers of a replication-defective vector could achieve protective immunity.",

Given the ability of relatively few infectious units of the infectious, replication defective pseudotype to achieve protection and a growing body of evidence for successful in vivo transfection, 8, 9 we tested the ability of the DNA forms of both the replication-competent and replication-defective vectors to achieve protection. We made as much DNA as we could and asked Rob to vaccinate chickens with 300 lg of vaccine DNA or empty vector DNA (the control). Each chicken received 300 lg of DNA at weeks 0 and 4 delivered by three routes (subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, and intravenous). A lethal influenza virus challenge was administered at week 5. We learned that our first DNA experiment had worked when Rob left the message ''Send more vaccine.'' We had achieved 100% protection in both groups of chickens, receiving either the replication-competent or the replication-defective vectors. We immediately set out to repeat the trial, telling nobody of the result until a patent had been filed. Once we had filed, we began to present the results, but these were met with disdain and skepticism. The first question at the summer 1992 American Society of Virology meeting was ''You don't think this will ever be useful, do you?'' Our grants were triaged and our manuscripts returned (despite Nature sending the report to multiple reviewers). Fortunately, our department chair, Guido Majno, a pathologist with broad interests in the history of science and medicine and author of the bestselling book, The Healing Hand, recognized the potential of what we were doing and provided departmental funds to keep us going. We knew we were onto something, and we kept going.",

[10] [11] [12] In our experiments, we used the gene gun to blast gold particles coated with the plasmid DNA into the shaved abdominal skin of mice. In earlier biolistic studies, Stephen Johnston had used a gene gun to deliver human growth hormone to the outer ears of mice and realized that he had not affected mouse growth but had elicited Ab to human growth hormone. 13 The use of the Agracetus gun (the size of a refrigerator) generated a great deal of excitement (and noise) within the department, but did not allay suspicions about our laboratory's endeavors.",

Despite the extraordinarily rapid reduction of this new technique to clinical use, we are now 25 years out and do not have a single licensed DNA vaccine for humans. Part of this is due to DNA vaccines having been used for the development of vaccines for chronic infections, such as HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria, which are difficult targets for vaccination. A second important factor is the low level of immune responses that are elicited by DNA vaccines when used alone or without assisted delivery such as by electroporation.",

The ''undetectable'' Ab responses did undergo strong anamnestic expansions post challenge, sufficiently strong to protect against infections that could kill within a week of challenge. These strong anamnestic responses differed from anamnestic responses primed by a natural infection by being focused on the antigen primed by the vaccine, rather than the totality of the immunogenic proteins of an infection. 22 This characteristic of DNA vaccines, the elicitation of low but specific responses, is the foundation for the currently popular use of DNA to prime responses that are then boosted by a live vector, peptide, or protein. 23 In these heterologous primeboost regimens, the DNA focuses the immune response on its vaccine insert, promotes antigenspecific B-cell development at the germinal center of lymph nodes, and activates the innate immune system to promote acquired immunity. 24, 25 Live vectors such as modified vaccinia Ankara are then used to boost the memory response for the vaccine antigens, which occurs largely to the exclusion of the antigens present in the boosting vector. Protein boosts are most effective for the epitopes that are common to the DNA-expressed antigen and the boost. In this case, the DNA-expressed antigen can serve to focus the boost on epitopes that represent the native antigen. These are readily preserved on DNA-expressed proteins but trickier to preserve on protein immunogens that need to undergo production, purification, and storage.",

Thus, they can be expensive to manufacture and deliver.

Currently, this Zika virus DNA vaccine candidate is in Phase I clinical trials (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02840487). This success reflects the high immunogenicity of the Zika glycoprotein, and sets a precedent for DNA immunizations with other highly immunogenic proteins holding good promise for success.
