            "text": "Background: Phylogeny estimation from aligned haplotype sequences has attracted more and more attention in the recent years due to its importance in analysis of many fine-scale genetic data. Its application fields range from medical research, to drug discovery, to epidemiology, to population dynamics. The literature on molecular phylogenetics proposes a number of criteria for selecting a phylogeny from among plausible alternatives. Usually, such criteria can be expressed by means of objective functions, and the phylogenies that optimize them are referred to as optimal. One of the most important estimation criteria is the parsimony which states that the optimal phylogeny T * for a set H of n haplotype sequences over a common set of variable loci is the one that satisfies the following requirements: (i) it has the shortest length and (ii) it is such that, for each pair of distinct haplotypes h i , h j \u2208 H, the sum of the edge weights belonging to the path from h i to h j in T * is not smaller than the observed number of changes between h i and h j . Finding the most parsimonious phylogeny for H involves solving an optimization problem, called the Most Parsimonious Phylogeny Estimation Problem (MPPEP), which is N P-hard in many of its versions. Results: In this article we investigate a recent version of the MPPEP that arises when input data consist of single nucleotide polymorphism haplotypes extracted from a population of individuals on a common genomic region. Specifically, we explore the prospects for improving on the implicit enumeration strategy of implicit enumeration strategy used in previous work using a novel problem formulation and a series of strengthening valid inequalities and preliminary symmetry breaking constraints to more precisely bound the solution space and accelerate implicit enumeration of possible optimal phylogenies. We present the basic formulation and then introduce a series of provable valid constraints to reduce the solution space. We then prove that these constraints can often lead to significant reductions in the gap between the optimal solution and its non-integral linear programming bound relative to the prior art as well as often substantially faster processing of moderately hard problem instances. Conclusion: We provide an indication of the conditions under which such an optimal enumeration approach is likely to be feasible, suggesting that these strategies are usable for relatively large numbers of taxa, although with stricter limits on numbers of variable sites. The work thus provides methodology suitable for provably optimal solution of some harder instances that resist all prior approaches.",

That evolution proceeds by small rather than smallest changes is due to the fact that the neighborhood of possible alleles that are selected at each instant of the life of a taxon is finite and, perhaps more important, that the selective forces acting on the taxon may not be constant throughout its evolution [12, 13] . Over the long term (periods of environmental change, including the intracellular environment), the accumulation of small changes will not generally correspond to the smallest possible set of changes consistent with the observed final sequences. Nevertheless, it is plausible to believe, at least for well-conserved molecular regions where mutations are reasonably rare and unlikely to have occurred repeatedly at any given variant locus, that the process of approximating small changes with smallest changes could provide a good approximation to the true evolutionary process of the observed set of taxa [14] . Such an assumption is likely to be reasonable, for example, in intraspecies phylogenetics, where few generations have elapsed since the observed taxa shared a common ancestor and thus the expected number of mutations per locus is much less than one. When such assumtions hold, a phylogeny of H is defined to be optimal under the parsimony criterion if it satisfies the following requirements: (i) it has the shortest length, i.e., the minimum sum of the edge weights, and (ii) it is such that, for each pair of distinct haplotypes h i , h j \u2208 H, the sum of the edge weights belonging to the path from h i to h j in T * is not smaller than the observed number of changes between h i and h j [11] . The first condition imposes the assumption that the smallest number of mutations consistent with the observed sequences is a good approximation to the true accumulated set of mutations; the second condition correlates the edge weights to the observed data.",

Some of the variants of the MPPEP, see e.g., [15, 16] , can be solved in polynomial time, however, in the most general case, the problem is N P-hard [11, 17] and this fact has justified the development of a number of exact and approximate solution approaches, http://www.almob.org/content/8/1/3 such those described in [11, 17, 18] . Some recent versions of the MPPEP, such as the Most Parsimonious Phylogeny Estimation Problem from SNP haplotypes (MPPEP-SNP) investigated in this article, play a fundamental role in providing predictions of practical use in several medical bioinformatics applications, such as disease association studies [19] or reconstruction of tumor phylogenies [20, 21] . In these contexts, it would be highly desirable to have the most accurate inferences possible for specific applications, but this in turn would imply to have algorithms able to exactly solve instances of such versions. As regards the MPPEP-SNP, the literature describes some (rare) circumstances for which it is possible to solve the problem in polynomial time (see Section Methods). Unfortunately, in the general case the MPPEP-SNP is N P-hard and solving provably to optimality therefore generally requires the use of exact approaches based on implicit enumeration algorithms, similar to the mixed integer programming strategies described in [1, 2, 22] .",

We present a formulation for the problem based on an adaptation of [23] 's mixed integer formulation for the Steiner tree problem extended with a number of preprocessing techniques and reduction rules to further decrease its size. We then show that it is possible to exploit the high symmetry inherent in most instances of the problem, through a series of strengthening valid inequalities, to eliminate redundant solutions and reduce the practical search space. We demonstrate through a series of empirical tests on real and artificial data that these novel insights into the symmetry of the problem often leads to significant reductions in the gap between the optimal solution and its non-integral linear programming bound relative to the prior art as well as often substantially faster processing of moderately hard problem instances. More generally, the work provides an indication of the conditions under which such an optimal enumeration approach is likely to be feasible, suggesting that these strategies are usable for relatively large numbers of taxa, although with stricter limits on numbers of variable sites. The work thus provides methodology suitable for provably optimal solution of some harder instances that resist all prior approaches. In future work, it may provide useful guidance for strategies and prospects of similar optimization methods for other variants of phylogeny inference.",

Specifically, a site is considered a SNP if for a minority of the population a certain nucleotide is observed (called the minor allele) while for the rest of the population a different nucleotide is observed (the major allele). The minor allele, or mutant type [24] , is generally encoded as '1' , as opposed to the major allele, or wild type [24] , generally encoded as '0' .

Unfortunately, it is possible to prove that in the general case the MPPEP-SNP is N P-hard (see [1, 22] ). In fact, the binary nature of the SNP haplotypes allows us to interpret a generic haplotype h i \u2208 H as a vertex of a m-dimensional unit hypercube, its s-th allele as the s-th coordinate of the vertex h i , and the set H as the set of Steiner vertices of the unit hypercube.

The first task in designing an integer programming model for the MPPEP-SNP that uses a polynomial-size number of variables consists of characterizing V, i.e., determining an upper and a lower bound on the cardinality of the set H . In fact, observe that H contains potentially an exponential number of haplotypes, namely all vertices of the unit hypercube that belong to the set {0, 1} m \\ H. However, we can easily bound the cardinality of H by means of the following approach. Consider the complete graph\u011c = (H,\u00ca), where\u00ca = {(h i , h j ) : h i , h j \u2208 H}, and construct a minimum spanning tree T\u011c of G.

Moreover, Formulation 1 can be reduced in size by removing those variables that are redundant or whose value is known in the optimal solution to the problem. For example, variables y ij can be removed from Formulation 1 as it is easy to realize that they are redundant. Similarly, all variables z s ij such that i, j \u2208 V H and d ij > 1 do not need to be defined as their value will be always zero for any s \u2208 S and in any feasible solution to the problem.

The reduction process can be further combined with the preprocessing strategies described in [1] to obtain even smaller formulations. Such strategies allow one to remove alleles from the input haplotype set H without altering the optimal solution to the problem. For example, suppose that the haplotype set H is such that there exists an allele\u015d \u2208 S such that h i (\u015d) = 1, for all h i \u2208 H; then it is easy to realize that\u015d can be removed from S as in any feasible solution to the problem the\u015d-th coordinate of any vertex in the phylogeny would be characterized by having x\u02c6s i = 1.

Specifically, the fourth and fifth columns refer to the gaps (expressed in percentage) of the respective formulations, i.e., to the difference between the optimal value to a specific instance and the value of linear relaxation at the root node of the search tree, divided by the optimal value. The table shows that, excluding the cases in which the solution to a specific instance was trivially a minimum spanning tree (see e.g., Human chromosome Y, Chimpanzee mtDNA, and Chimpanzee chromosome Y), the Flow-RM is always characterized by (sometimes dramatically) smaller gaps. This fact derives on the one hand from the tightness of the Flow-RM with respect to [1] 's polynomial-size formulation and on the other hand from the efficiency of the strengthening valid inequalities previously described. The poor relaxations of their formulation led [1] to propose an alternative and faster exact approach to solution of the MPPEP-SNP based on the brute-force enumeration of all possible Steiner vertices necessary to solve a specific instance of the problem. To speed up the computation, the brute-force enumeration algorithm makes use of a set of reduction rules based on Buneman graph enumeration to decrease the number of Steiner vertices to be considered. Interestingly, despite the differences in terms of implementation language between the two programs (namely, Mosel for the Flow-RM and C++ for [1] 's brute-force enumeration algorithm), the Flow-RM proved to be competitive with [1] 's enumeration algorithm, being able to solve almost all the considered instances within 1 second computing time. Only in two cases, namely Human mtDNA 40 \u00d7 52 and Human mtDNA 395 \u00d7 830, the Flow-RM needed more than 5 minutes to find the corresponding optimal solutions. The deterioration of the runtime performance in those instances is mainly due to the overhead necessary to load the formulation (that in both cases is considerably bigger than in the other instances) and to an intensive use of the separation oracle for the forbidden path constraints. Possibly, a more thorough implementation of the separation oracle and the use of more performing languages (e.g., C++) could help in speeding up computations in those instances at least. Interestingly, sometimes in real applications the number of haplotypes can be much bigger than the number of SNPs. Hence, it is important to test the ability of an exact algorithm to tackle instances of the MPPEP-SNP containing e.g., hundreds haplotypes. [1] observed that their brute force enumeration algorithm is able to tackle instances of the problem containing up to 270 haplotypes having up to 9 SNPs each within 12 hours computing time. Unfortunately, the authors also observed that their algorithm is unable to solve larger instances of the MPPEP-SNP, no matter the maximum runtime considered. In this context, the Flow-RM makes the difference, being able to tackle instances of the MPPEP-SNP having up to 300 haplotypes and 10 SNPs within 3 hours computing time. To show this result, we considered a number of random instances of the problem containing 100, 150, 200, 250, and 300 haplotypes, respectively. Fixing the number of haplotypes n \u2208 {100, 150, 200, 250, 300}, we created an instance of the problem by generating at random n strings of length 10 over the alphabet = {0, 1}. During the generation process, we randomly selected the number of SNPs equal to 1 in a given haplotype, and subsequently we randomly chose the sites of the haplotype to be set to 1. We iterated the instance generation process 10 times for a fixed value of n, obtaining eventually an overall number of 50 random instances of the MPPEP-SNP downloadable at http://homepages.ulb.ac.be/ \u223c dacatanz/ Site/Software files/iMPPEP.zip.",

            "text": "A part from m4, all the remaining instances gave rise to too large formulations (several hundreds Mbytes RAM) to be handled by the Xpress Optimizer. Hence, instead of analyzing entirely each instance we decomposed it into contiguous SNP blocks and analyzed the most difficult block separately. In more in detail, we define H r to be the haplotype matrix obtained by the application of [1] 's reduction rules, we sorted the columns of H r according to an increasing ordering of the weights w s , s \u2208\u015c; subsequently, we considered the submatrices obtained by taking k contiguous SNPs (or k-block) in\u015c, k \u2208 {10, 13, 15}. We did not consider greater values for k as we observed that k = 15 was already a threshold after which the haplotype submatrix gave rise to too large formulations. For each k-block B in H r we considered the hamming distance d h i h j = s\u2208B |h i (s) \u2212 h j (s)| between each pair of distinct haplotypes in H r , and chose the k-block maximizing the sum h i ,h j \u2208H r ,h i <h j d h i h j . Finally, we assumed three hours as maximum runtime per instance. Table 3 shows the results obtained in our experiments. As for Table 2 , the columns \"Time\" and \"Nodes\" refer to the solution time (expressed in seconds) and to the number of nodes in the search tree necessary to solve exactly a specific instance of the MPPEP-SNP, respectively. In such a case, the values in the columns \"Gap\" refers to the gap between the best primal bound found within the limit time and the root relaxation and \"Nodes\" refers to the number of nodes explored in the tree search within the limit time. Table 3 shows that, apart from the instances f1 and m4, the Flow-RM was unable to exactly solve, within the limit time, the considered instances for values of k \u2208 {13, 15}. Specifically, The Flow-RM exactly solved in less than a minute the instance f1 when considering values of k \u2208 {10, 13} ; in 20 minutes the instance i2 when considering k = 10 ; in less than 3 minutes the instance k3 when considering k = 10 ; and the instance m4 in 5 seconds. In contrast, the Flow-RM was unable to solve the instance p5, regardless of the value of k considered. In fact, already when considering k = 10, the Xpress Optimizer took more than 12 hours to exactly solve the instance p5 and explored over 10 million nodes in the search tree. A more detailed analysis of the instance showed that, despite the presence of the strengthening valid inequalities, p5 is characterized by highly fractional relaxations. This fact implies the existence of equivalent optimal solutions to the instance that, on the one hand, delay the finding of a primal bound and, on the other hand, force the Optimizer to explore many more nodes in the tree search. This situation in more pronounced in p5 but also occurs in the instances i2 and k3. To improve the tightness of the formulation we tried to include in the Flow-RM also classical facets and strengthening valid inequalities for the Steiner tree problem in a graph (see [23, [36] [37] [38] ). However, we did not observe any benefit from the inclusion. We suspect that the presence of highly fractional solutions to the problem could be caused both by poor lower bounds on the number of Steiner vertices considered in the Flow-RM and by the existence of a number of non trivial classes of symmetries still present in the problem. Investigating such issues warrants future research efforts.",

When running the same experiments described in [2] we registered a very poor performance for the Flow-RM, mainly due to the large dimension of the considered instances and the presence of symmetries despite the use of constraints (13)- (15) . We observed that the combination of these two factors increased the runtime performance of the Flow-RM of 2-3 orders of magnitude with respect to [2] approach. However, we also observed that when performing [2] 's \"window analysis\" (i.e., when decomposing into blocks of 10 SNPs the input matrix) the Flow-RM performed better than [2] 's, being characterized by an average solution time of 8.27 seconds. This fact suggests that, when considering instances constituted by less than a dozen sites, an exact approach entirely based on integer programming may perform better than the implicit enumeration of the vertices of the generalized Buneman graph. Vice-versa, for larger instances the implicit enumeration of the vertices of the generalized Buneman graph appears more suitable.",

The MPPEP-SNP is N P-hard and this fact has justified the development of exact and approximate solution approaches such as those described in [1, 19, 22, [26] [27] [28] . We explored the prospects for improving on the strategy of [1, 2] using a novel problem formulation and a series of additional constraints to more precisely bound the solution space and accelerate implicit enumeration of possible optimal phylogenies. We present a formulation for the problem based on an adaptation of [23] 's mixed integer formulation for the Steiner tree problem extended with a number of preprocessing techniques and reduction rules to further decrease its size. We then show that it is possible to exploit the high symmetry inherent in most instances of the problem, through a series of strengthening valid inequalities, to eliminate redundant solutions and reduce the practical search space. We demonstrate through a series of empirical tests on real and artificial data that these novel insights into the symmetry of the problem often leads to significant reductions in the gap between the optimal solution and its non-integral linear programming bound relative to the prior art as well as often substantially faster processing of moderately hard problem instances. More generally, the work provides an indication of the conditions under which such an optimal enumeration approach is likely to be feasible, suggesting that these strategies are usable for relatively large numbers of taxa, although with stricter limits on numbers of variable sites. The work thus provides methodology suitable for provably optimal solution of some harder instances that resist all prior approaches. Our results may provide also useful guidance for strategies and prospects of similar optimization methods for other variants of phylogeny inference. In fact, if appropriately adapted, some of the results we presented here (e.g., symmetry breaking strategies) can be generalized with respect to other phylogenetic estimation criteria (e.g., the likelihood criterion) and provide important computational benefits.",

Given two distinct haplotypes h i , h j \u2208 H, we denote S h i h j as the subset of different alleles between h i and h j , d h i h j = |h i (s) \u2212 h j (s)| as the distance between h i and h j , and we say that h i and h j are adjacent if d h i h j = 1. From a biological point of view, the adjacency between a pair of distinct haplotypes means that one of the two haplotypes evolved from the other by mutation of a specific SNP over time. Consider a graph G = (H, E) having a vertex for each haplotype in H and an edge for each pair of adjacent haplotypes h i , h j \u2208 H. Then, a phylogeny T of H is a spanning tree of G, i.e., an acyclic subgraph of G in which a pair of vertices h i , h j \u2208 H is adjacent in T if d h i h j = 1 . It is worth noting that, according to the definition of the edge set E, in general a phylogeny of H may not exist as the graph G = (H, E) might not be connected. To always ensure the existence of a phylogeny for H, we introduce the set H which consists of the minimum number of haplotypes that should be added to H in such a way that, defined H = H \u222a H and E = {(h i , h j ) : h i , h j \u2208 H and d h i h j = 1}, the graph G= (H, E)is connected. From a biological point of view, the set H represents the set of haplotypes that are ancestors of the observed ones but either had gone extinct or just were not observed in that sample (also called Steiner nodes).Denote T as a phylogeny of H, E(T) as the edge set of T, and L(T) as the length of the phylogeny T, i.e., the sum of the distances d h i h j , for all (h i , h j ) \u2208 E(T). Then, the problem of finding a phylogeny of H that satisfies the parsimony criterion consists of solving the following optimization problem: the minimum cardinality haplotype set H to be added to H so that the phylogeny T has minimum length.",
