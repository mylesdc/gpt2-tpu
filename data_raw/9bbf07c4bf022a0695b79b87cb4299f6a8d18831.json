A total of 59,219 ESTs with an average read length of 409 bp were generated. 454 ESTs were combined with the 50,666 G. uralensis ESTs in GenBank. The combined ESTs were assembled into 27,229 unique sequences (11,694 contigs and 15,535 singletons). A total of 20,437 unique gene elements representing approximately 10,000 independent transcripts were annotated using BLAST searches (e-value \u2264 1e-5) against the SwissProt, KEGG, TAIR, Nr and Nt databases. The assembled sequences were annotated with gene names and Gene Ontology (GO) terms. With respect to the genes related to glycyrrhizin metabolism, genes encoding 16 enzymes of the 18 total steps of the glycyrrhizin skeleton synthesis pathway were found. To identify novel genes that encode cytochrome P450 enzymes and glycosyltransferases, which are related to glycyrrhizin metabolism, a total of 125 and 172 unigenes were found to be homologous to cytochrome P450s and glycosyltransferases, respectively. The cytochrome P450 candidate genes were classified into 32 CYP families, while the glycosyltransferase candidate genes were classified into 45 categories by GO analysis. Finally, 3 cytochrome P450 enzymes and 6 glycosyltransferases were selected as the candidates most likely to be involved in glycyrrhizin biosynthesis through an organ-specific expression pattern analysis based on real-time PCR.",

EST sequencing represents a rapid and cost-effective method for analyzing the transcribed regions of genomes. EST analysis is also a powerful tool for the discovery of genes involved in plant secondary metabolism. The 454 GS FLX sequencing technology has made EST-based resources more readily accessible for non-model organism transcriptomes [2, 3] . Our experimental focus for this study was Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch. ex DC., which is one of the most ancient medicinal herbs and has been used as a Chinese herbal medicine to treat infectious diseases for over 3,000 years [4] . This herb has been extensively stud-ied and is widely used as a flavoring agent, medicament and tobacco additive. Many of the biological activities of the bioactive constituents of G. uralensis have been investigated, including the protection against hepatotoxicity [5, 6] , anti-ulcer effects [7] , anti-inflammatory [8] and anti-tumor promoting activities [9] . This herb also exhibits antiviral activity against various DNA and RNA viruses, including herpes simplex virus [10] , HIV [11, 12] and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated coronavirus [13] .",

Our research interests primarily concern glycyrrhizin, an oleanane-type triterpene saponin and a well-known natural sweetener that is fifty times sweeter than sugar [14] . Although the various chemical and pharmacological properties of glycyrrhizin in G. uralensis have been extensively studied, the biosynthetic pathway of this compound remains poorly understood. Two functional genes encoding squalene synthase (SQS) have been isolated from G. uralensis [15] . Two cytochrome P450 genes have also been isolated from G. uralensis based on the traditional EST sequencing method [16] . CYP88D6, a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, was characterized by in vitro enzymatic activity assays and was shown to catalyze the oxidation of \u03b2-amyrin at C-11 to produce 11-oxo\u03b2-amyrin, a possible biosynthetic intermediate in the glycyrrhizin biosynthetic pathway [16] . Another cytochrome P450 from G. uralensis, CYP93E3, possesses \u03b2amyrin 24-hydroxylase activity in in vitro enzymatic activity assays [16] . A functional \u03b2-amyrin synthase gene (bAS) has been isolated from G. glabra [17, 18] . Thus far, only one glycosyltransferase in the Glycyrrhiza genus, the isoflavonoid glucosyltransferase in G. echinata, has been identified [19] . However, no progress has been made in the identification of the genes involved in the glycosylation of glycyrrhetinic acid to produce glycyrrhizin. Transcriptome sequencing would provide a foundation for detailed studies of gene expression and genetic connectivity with respect to plant secondary metabolism.",

The library was sequenced using the 454 GS FLX platform and Titanium reagents. There are currently 50,666 G. uralensis ESTs in the GenBank (GuEST) dbEST database, which were determined using conventional sequencing techniques [20] . In our study, we increased this collection with an additional 59,219 ESTs generated from 454 GS FLX Titanium sequencing. Bioinformatic analyses indicated that almost all of the genes involved in the biosynthesis of the glycyrrhizin skeleton were within the combined EST database, except for mevalonate kinase (EC 2.7.1.36) and DXP synthase (EC 2.2.1.7). Additionally, a pool of candidate genes for cytochrome P450s and glycosyltransferases was established, containing 125 and 172 unigenes, respectively. Finally, using an organ-specific expression pattern analysis, a few unigenes were selected as the candidates most likely to be responsible for glycyrrhizin skeleton modifications. The method described here is a cost-effective technology for the identification of novel genes in nonmodel organisms that serve as medicinal plants. Furthermore, the ESTs and unigenes described in our study constitute an important resource for future studies of the molecular genetics and functional genomics of G. uralensis.",

Of these HQ reads, 57,997 exceeded our minimal quality standards (SMART primer filtering; length threshold of 50 bp) and were used in the assembly. The large portion of reads used after trimming and filtering indicates that most of the sequences were used in the assembly and that the quality of the data was considerably high.

Figure 1 illustrates the sequence length distributions of the ESTs derived from 454 sequencing and Gen-Bank. Assembly of the trimmed, size-selected ESTs produced 11,694 contigs with a mean length of 571 bp and a range of 85 -3,812 bp, as well as an additional 15,535 singletons, for a total of 27,229 unigenes (contigs and singletons) ( Table 2 ).

Approximately 16% of the unigenes (4,337 out of 27,229) were composed of the 454 ESTs and GuESTs data ( Figure 3 ). The 454 sequencing identified 16,130 novel unigenes, bringing the total number of different G. uralensis unigenes in the databases to 27,229.

In plants, these two pathways appear to be separate; enzymes of the MVA pathway are found in the cytosol, whereas enzymes of the MEP pathway are localized in plastids. Triterpenoids are known to be formed by the MVA pathway because they are cytosolic products. However, there are examples where the two pathways can act cooperatively to create a molecule [30] . No progress has been made toward determining the precise source of isoprene units in glycyrrhizin biosynthesis. Using a BLAST [22] search against the SwissProt [23] and KEGG [24] databases, we found the genes encoding all of the enzymes from both of these two pathways in the EST database, except for mevalonate kinase (EC 2.7.1.36), which is located in the MVA pathway, and DXP synthase (EC 2.2.1.7), which is located in the MEP pathway. In this study, we found all of the putative genes encoding the enzymes involved in the triterpene skeleton \u03b2-amyrin synthesis step: farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FPS), squalene synthase (SQS), squalene monooxygenase and \u03b2-amyrin synthase (bAS). The enzymes involved in the biosyntheses of the isoprene unit and the triterpene skeleton are listed in Table 3 .

Plant P450s catalyze many different reactions involved in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, including terpenoids [33] . Some members of the CYP88 454 EST GuEST and CYP93 families have been shown to act on \u03b2-amyrin or related triterpene substrates with unique reaction specificities [16, [34] [35] [36] . Thus far, all known cytochrome P450s that act on triterpenes and sterols have been classified into two clans: the CYP71 clan and the CYP85 clan, which includes CYP93 and CYP88, respectively [16, 34, [37] [38] [39] . Only two CYP genes of G. uralensis have been identified [16] . An organ-specific transcript profiling approach was used in other studies to identify CYP88D6, which catalyzes the oxidation of \u03b2-amyrin at C-11 to produce 11-oxo-\u03b2-amyrin in the glycyrrhizin biosynthetic pathway. The expression profile of CYP88D6 was consistent with the organ-specific accumulation pattern of glycyrrhizin [16] ; a higher level of expression was seen in the root than in the stem and leaf. By mining the EST database, we found 125 unigenes (500 ESTs) annotated as putative CYP genes, which were further classified into 32 CYP families and 47 subfamilies (Additional file 4). To narrow down the candidate cytochrome P450s, these unigenes were further screened according to their classification. In the candidate P450 dataset, two unigenes (23 ESTs) were annotated as CYP88, while six unige-nes (30 ESTs) were annotated as CYP93. In total, 29 contigs annotated as cytochrome P450 and belonging to the CYP71 and CYP85 clans (Additional file 5), were chosen for organ-specific expression pattern assays ( Figure  5A ). Contig01314 (No. 2 in Figure 5A ) was exactly the same as the CYP88D6 gene according to the BLAST annotation results. An additional 3 unigenes had a similar organ-specific expression pattern as CYP88D6, including contig06734 (No. 19 in Figure 5A ), contig07137 (No. 20 in Figure 5A ) and contig07899 (No. 23 in Figure 5A ). However, additional experiments are needed to determine which of these unigenes participate in glycyrrhizin biosynthesis. Glycosyltransferases, a ubiquitous family of enzymes, catalyze reactions involving the transfer of a nucleotideactivated sugar moiety onto another molecule [40] . These enzymes are encoded by a large multigene family; approximately 120 secondary metabolism glycosyltransferase genes have been identified in Arabidopsis. The conjugation of a sugar moiety to a substrate is called glycosylation, which is a process that contributes to the synthesis of glucidic polymers, glycoproteins and glycolipids. According to the GO category analysis, these unigenes were classified into 45 categories (Additional file 6). Among these categories, 27 unigenes (83 ESTs) encoded for UDP-glucosyltransferases, which is obviously involved in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites. We also pick up unigenes annotated as glucuronosyltransferases because glycyrrhizin is composed of aglycone glycyrrhetic acid and two glucuronic acid units. We found 11 unigenes (33 ESTs) that encoded glucuronosyltransferases, and it is possible that these are involved in the last steps of glycyrrhizin biosynthesis. From these two categories, 17 contigs were chosen (Additional file 5) for organ-specific expression pattern analysis by real-time PCR ( Figure 5B ). The expression patterns of 6 glycosyltransferase unigenes were similar to that of CYP88D6. These glycosyltransferases included contig01209 (No. 3 in Figure 5B ), contig03646 (No. 6 in Figure 5B ), contig05219 (No. 11 in Figure 5B ), contig09428 (No. 13 in Figure 5B ), contig09463 (No. 14 in Figure 5B ) and contig09686 (No. 15 in Figure 5B ). These contigs were regarded as candidate glycosyltransferases that encode the enzymes responsible for glycyrrhizin biosynthesis and will be the subject of further study. We did not select singletons that were annotated as cytochrome P450s or glycosyltransferases for the organ-specific expression pattern analysis because of the high content of glycyrrhizin in the Glycyrrhiza plant (3 -5% in the root) [30] .",

The information from these ESTs represents a significant contribution toward the exploration of the molecular mechanisms of glycyrrhizin biosynthesis.

Previous research has shown that wild G. uralensis contains much more glycyrrhizin than cultivated plants [41, 42] . One possible reason for this difference is that under cultivated plant conditions, G. uralensis grows more vigorously and has a more active primary metabolism, while glycyrrhizin accumulation results from secondary metabolism. Wild G. uralensis primarily grows in dry areas where lean soil inhibits vegetative growth and thus favors the synthesis and accumulation of glycyrrhizin. Additional studies have shown that the glycyrrhizin content of the G. uralensis plant is related to its growth period [42, 43] . In contrast to the chemical methods that are mainly used to investigate glycyrrhizin content and accumulation, our transcriptome sequencing method is designed to only reveal genes that are expressed during sampling. Therefore, to investigate the secondary metabolites of glycyrrhizin, plants should be sampled during the glycyrrhizin biosynthetic period. Since this period has not been well studied thus far, we decided to use five-year-old wild G. uralensis.",
