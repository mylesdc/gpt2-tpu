The comparison of different samples requires the transformation of data through a process called normalisation. Reference or housekeeping genes are candidate genes which are selected on the basis of constitutive expression across samples, and allow the quantification of changes in gene expression. At present, no reference gene has been identified for any organism which is universally optimal for use across different tissue types or disease situations. We used microarray data to identify new reference genes generated from total RNA isolated from normal and osteoarthritic canine articular tissues (bone, ligament, cartilage, synovium and fat). RT-qPCR assays were designed and applied to each different articular tissue. Reference gene expression stability and ranking was compared using three different mathematical algorithms.",

One gene (mitochondrial ribosomal protein S7 [MRPS7]) was stably expressed in all five of the articular tissues evaluated. One gene HIRA interacting protein 5 isoform 2 [HIRP5]) was stably expressed in four of the tissues evaluated. A commonly used reference gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was not stably expressed in any of the tissues evaluated. Most consistent agreement between rank ordering of reference genes was observed between Bestkeeper\u00a9 and geNorm, although each method tended to agree on the identity of the most stably expressed genes and the least stably expressed genes for each tissue. New reference genes identified using microarray data normalised in a conventional manner were more stable than those identified by microarray data normalised by using a real-time RT-qPCR methodology.",

These inter-sample differences are addressed through the process of normalisation [5] , whereby the expression of an individual gene within a sample is related to that of a calibrating gene known as a reference, control or \"housekeeping\" gene. Ideally, a reference gene is expressed at a consistent and repeatable quantity across all samples being compared, so that relative differences in gene expression can be measured with confidence. Commonly used reference genes such as beta-2-microglobulin (B2M), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and beta actin (ACTB), are not constantly expressed across all tissue types and disease states [6, 7] . Thus it is widely accepted that the selection of reference genes should be established through the validation of expression stability in the tissue or cells of interest, before use.",

Microarray data can be stratified on the basis of fold changes in expression [14] , the variance of expression [11, 16] or integrative correlations [15] . Candidate genes can then be selected from stratified data, and frequently demonstrate expression stabilities greater than conventionally used reference genes [11, 14, 15] . However microarray data has yet to identify a new reference gene which shows consistent stability across multiple tissue or cell types, and/or disease situations.

We used a combination of filtering on statistical significance, fold change and coefficient of variation (percentage standard deviation) to narrow the potential number of reference genes. Furthermore, these criteria were applied to three different experiments, using two different data sets, to identify genes which were more likely to have generic stability across multiple tissues for diseases. Genes were finally filtered on the basis of defined annotation and level of expression. In retrospect, genes should also have been selected on the basis of single transcript expression (i.e. the absence of splice variants). Although the two most stably expressed genes (MRPS7 and HIRP5) currently have no splice variants reported, the absence of splice variants did not necessarily confer reference gene stability across multiple tissues (as demonstrated by GAPDH and MRPS25, genes which do not have splice variants annotated and were not the most stably expressed) but should be taken into account when selecting new reference genes, as another potential indicator of instability. Our filtering method was straightforward, quickly performed and easily completed by any person without a full understanding of microarray data set handling, and as such could be applied to publicly available microarray data sets for a given experiment or disease.",

The selection of reference genes upon their stability as determined by the mathematical assessment of their expression values is a widely accepted technique [6, [12] [13] [14] [15] 20, 21] . We identified one gene which showed stable expression across normal and diseased articular tissues (MRPS7), and a number of genes which demonstrated a relatively consistent stability across the majority of tissue specimens (HIRP5). One should bear in mind that the tissues evaluated were from the same embryological origin (mesenchymal tissue), and hence there may have been a tendency towards identifying a reference gene which was stable in all tissues, although this is not supported by reports of reference gene stability in different tissues [21] . Likewise, the diseases compared in the microarray data sets were the same as those affecting the tissue samples evaluated by real-time RT-qPCR, which may further tend towards identifying reference genes whose stability was constant. Therefore, although we identified one gene as being stably expressed in all tissues, we would not advocate its use as a reference gene in other tissues or diseases without assessment of its stability in the samples to be evaluated [6, 16, 21] , as the utopia of a universal reference gene suitable for all studies probably does not exist on basis of the published evidence to date.",

The precise function of this gene is unknown in eukaryotes, but the protein is thought to be involved in organising the 3' domain of the 16 S rRNA in the mitochondria of prokaryotes, and thus be involved in the initiation of translation in mammalian mitochondria [22] . Microarray data analysis indicated the mitochondrial ribosomal protein S25 was also stably expressed, although it was only stably expressed in two of the four tissues analysed by RT-qPCR (cartilage and fat pad). In a separate study, mitochondrial ribosomal protein L19 was one of six genes identified from microarray data obtained from different tissues and cells, as a good reference gene for real-time RT-qPCR experiments, when compared to conventional reference genes for mammary tumour expression profiling [16] . Mitochondrial ribosomal gene expression appears to show greater stability across different tissues and thus may be less affected by tissue type or disease status, and better potential candidate reference genes for other real-time RT-qPCR experiments.",

The selection of candidate reference genes from microarray data identified new genes which were more stably expressed and is consistent with the general outcome of previous studies using this methodology [11, [14] [15] [16] . The normalisation of microarray data by geometric mean of three reference genes [6] did not identify genes (NCK2 or TRAPPC2L) with appropriate stability to be suitable for use as reference genes. The instability of these genes may be reflected, in part, by the greater variation identified in the triplicate repeats of each assay when compared to more genes determined as being more stably expressed such as HIRP5 or MRPS7. The less stable expression of the three conventional reference genes (GAPDH, RPL13A and SDHA) probably resulted in the selection of similarly \"unstably\" expressed reference genes from microarray data, and thus accounted for this being a futile method of trying to select reference genes, which agrees with the evaluation of these types of methodologies for the accurate normalisation of microarray data [23] . These genes were selected on the basis of a preliminary study of reference gene stability in canine OA tissues [24] , however subsequent work evaluating greater sample numbers has determined that one of these genes (SHDA) demonstrates differential expression in OA cartilage [25] and thus its use may have further predisposed to the selection of genes which were not stably expressed. Furthermore, the conventionally used reference gene we evaluated (GAPDH) did not show acceptable stable expression in any of the tissues we analysed.",

As we identified a number of new reference genes which have very little functional information associated with their annotation, we checked for co-regulation between the most stably expressed genes by removing one of the highest ranked genes (as determined by pairwise comparisons) alternately, and reassessing the rank ordering of reference genes stabilities. No major changes in rank ordering or reference gene stability were observed when this was performed. However, it should be noted that other factors besides gene expression pathway similarities can contribute to co-regulation. Yu et al. (2003) identified that genes targeted by similar transcription factors have complex relationships across the co-regulated genes [26] . The different methods for determining reference gene stability did not necessarily agree on rank order, but were good at determining both the most and least stably expressed genes, regardless of method. The top two most stably expressed genes analysed by geNorm for each tissue were then used to study cytokine gene expression in canine osteoarthritis [27] .",

Each of these methods generates a measure of reference gene stability, which can be used to rank the reference genes in order of stability. GeNorm generates a stability measure (the M value) for each gene which is arbitrarily suggested to be lower than 0.4 (with a lower value indicating increased gene stability across samples), and a pairwise stability measure to determine the benefit of adding extra reference genes for the normalisation process, with again a lower value indicating greater stability of the normalised genes, and a lower value indicating greater stability with an arbitrary cut off value of lower than 0.15 indicating acceptable stability of the reference gene combination [6] . NormFinder generates a stability measure of which a lower value indicates increased stability in gene expression. By using a model-based approach, NormFinder groups samples to allow for a direct estimation of expression variation, compared to the pairwise comparison approach that ranks genes according to the similarity of their expression profiles. Therefore, taking a sample set which consists of two sample subgroups where all of the candidates but one show little difference between the groups, the one candidate which shows no difference will have the smallest stability value across all candidates and be the most stably expressed gene. Best-keeper\u00a9 generates a pairwise correlation co-efficient between each gene and the Bestkeeper\u00a9 index (the geometric mean of the threshold cycle values of all the reference genes grouped together). Stability measures for combined (normal and diseased) samples were recorded, as ultimately it is these measures which would be used to determine which genes were suitable for normalising expression data from genes of interest in a particular disease (osteoarthritis) in practice.",
