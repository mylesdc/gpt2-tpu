Since the reemergence of Ebola virus in Central Africa, the CIRMF \"Emerging Viral Disease Unit\" developed diagnostic tools and epidemiologic strategies and transfers of such technology to support the response of the National Public Health System and the World Health Organization to epidemics of Ebola virus disease. The Unit carries out a unique investigation program on the natural history of the filoviruses, emergence of epidemics, and Ebola virus pathogenesis. In addition, academic training is provided at all levels to regional and international students covering emerging conditions (host factors, molecular biology, genetics) that favor the spread of viral diseases.",

            "text": "The International Centre for Medical Researches of Franceville (CIRMF) was founded in 1974 by His Excellency El Hadj Omar Bongo Ondimba, President of the Gabonese Republic, and Mr. Pierre Guillaumat, the chairman of the petroleum company, Total Gabon. The Centre was inaugurated on December 5th, 1979 with the participation of numerous internationally eminent scientists (Figure 1) . In the 1990s, viral hemorrhagic fevers became a focus of attention in Equatorial. The decision to develop a high security laboratory for the study of Ebola virus disease came after a 1996 Ebola virus disease outbreak in Mayibout area, Gabon. The main objective was to develop the potential for rapid and specific diagnosis on viral hemorrhagic fevers and to have a backup for field investigation of severe viral hemorrhagic fever epidemics. Because the unique expertise and interaction of the CIRMF team along with the international World Health Organization (WHO) teams for Ebola virus disease, the Gabonese government agreed to such a project. The first BSL3+ (including negative pressure and glove box) laboratory was built in 1997, mostly financed by the Foreign Ministry of France ( Figure 2 ). This laboratory was built in a period of quasi \"emergence\" of successive Ebola virus disease outbreaks in Gabon, and the plans to upgrade the BSL3+ laboratory were not efficient. A specific research unit was founded in 1998 to study emerging infectious diseases: The Emerging Viral Disease Unit (UMVE). Thanks to work done between 1996 and 1998, both in the field and in research, CIRMF became a National Reference Laboratory and a WHO Collaborating Center in the Equatorial African region. A second high security laboratory for Risk Group 3/4 Agents, mostly funded by the TOTAL Gabon oil company and the Gabonese Government, was built between 2003 and 2008 on CIRMF campus ( Figure 3 ). This BSL-4 laboratory was commissioned by a combined team of experts from the Pasteur Institute of Paris, National Institute of Health and Medical Research, France, and Jean M\u00e9rieux P4 laboratory of Lyon.

The present high containment and high security laboratory, operated by the Emerging Viral Diseases Unit (UMVE), is one of 2 laboratories in Africa that can manipulate Risk Group 3/4 Agents (i.e., Ebola, Marburg, and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever viruses). Research, including isolation and characterization of these highly pathogenic viruses is performed in accordance with international rules defined by WHO on the handling Risk Group 3/4 Agents Updated equipment includes a double door autoclave, thermo regulated cabinet, a high security centrifuge system, a conventional photonic microscope, a virus isolation unit, and two independent rooms the can be shut down alternatively after decontamination when necessary. An uninterruptable controlled electrical supply for refrigeration, computer systems, and other systems is ensured by two back-up power plants. The telecommunication network consists of mobile phones and the Internet through a dedicated satellite antenna. Other service units consist of a Primate Center, the Gorilla and Chimpanzee Study Station in Lop\u00e9 National Park, and the Dienga Health Observatory. Investigators from this observatory conduct field studies on the prevalence of viral and parasitic diseases and their implications for public health [1] Dedicated to medical research, the Primate Center houses more than 450 primates belonging to ten different African species (e.g., chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), gorillas (Gorilla sp), mandrills (Mandrillus sphinx), guenons (Cercopithecus sp.), collared mangabeys (Cercocebus torquatus), greater spot-nosed monkeys (Cercopithecus nictitans), vervet monkeys (Chlorocebus pygerythrus) and an Asian macaque (Macaca sp.) colony. One of the largest primate centers in Africa, the Primate Center is equipped with level A2 and A3 animal facilities for scientific research protocols. The Great Apes are housed in large open-air facilities. Semi-free living colony of twelve forested hectares harbor about half of the primates at the Primate center. At the Gorillas and Chimpanzee Study Station, researchers study ecological approaches to the emergence of zoonotic diseases, inter-species transmission of pathogens, and disease outbreaks in humans and wild animals [2] .

If the first approach was not successful, conventional RT-PCR was implemented using degenerate consensus primers targeting conserved regions of the genome.

These steps include: the identification of reservoir species, the circulation within the natural host, the crossing to intermediary animal species, and finally the direct transmission to humans from great apes and fruit bats. Antibodies and nucleotide sequences specific for Ebola virus were detected in the liver and spleen of fruit bat belonging to three species (Hypsignathus monstrosus, Epomops franqueti, Myonycteris torquata) in Gabon and Republic of the Congo (Figure 4 ). Antibodies and nucleotide sequences specific for Marburg virus were found in the Egyptian fruit bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus) in Gabon, suggesting that bats might be reservoirs for filoviruses [3] [4] [5] . We showed that Ebola virus caused extensive epizootics among gorillas and chimpanzees, killing thousands of animals during the last decade in parts of Gabon and Republic of the Congo [4] . We characterized the viral variants associated with all Ebola virus disease outbreaks that occurred between 1996 and 2008 and developed new epidemiological models of Ebola virus disease epidemics, based on the identification of several independent epidemic chains. The identification of multiple variants during the 2001 Gabon/Republic of Congo outbreak and two phylogenetically divergent lineages suggest independent introductions into great ape and human populations following multiple viral spillovers from a reservoir host [6] [7] . In this \"multi-emergence\" hypothesis, Ebola virus disease outbreaks would occur episodically during certain ecological conditions caused by habitat disturbances or climatic phenomena. This hypothesis also implicitly assumes that Ebola virus was present in Equatorial Africa long before the first documented disease outbreak in 1976, as supported by various serological surveys. Furthermore, we recently showed that the 2007 Luebo outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo was linked to massive fruit bat migration, strongly suggesting that humans could be infected directly by bats or by consumption of bats [8] .",

The innate immune reaction is characterized by a 'cytokine storm', with a hyper secretion of numerous pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and growth factors, and by the noteworthy absence of antiviral interferon (IFN)-\u03b1 [9, 13, 14] . Immunosuppression of adaptive immunity is characterized by very low levels of circulating cytokines produced by T lymphocytes and by massive loss of peripheral CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes, probably through Fas/FasL-mediated apoptosis. Finally, we hypothesized that a viral protein with super-antigen activity might be involved in the massive T cell apoptosis [15] . In striking contrast with fatal outcome, effective control of Ebola virus infection is associated with balanced immune responses in survivors. Asymptomatic Ebola virus infection was demonstrated in humans during the 1996-97 disease outbreak in Gabon [16] . Asymptomatic infection was associated with an early strong inflammatory response that may be involved in the early inhibition of viral replication [16, 17] . Consistent with this discovery, we showed a decade later that a large fraction of the human population living in forested areas of Gabon has both humoral and cellular immunity to Ebola virus [18] . In the absence of identified risk factors, the high prevalence of 'immune' individuals suggests a common source of human exposure such as fruits contaminated by bat saliva.",

Due to tropical weather, four weekly domestic plane rotations often fly on an inconsistent schedule. Ultimately CIRMF needs to be largely autonomous in term of electrical power (i.e.,: unexpected fuel supply disruption), cold chain with the necessity to maintain in situ a unit of liquid nitrogen production (repository), and purified water supply.
