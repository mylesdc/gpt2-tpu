            "text": "Theoretically, homogeneous environments favor the evolution of specialists whereas heterogeneous environments favor generalists. Canine distemper is a multi-host carnivore disease caused by canine distemper virus (CDV). The described cell receptor of CDV is SLAM (CD150). Attachment of CDV hemagglutinin protein (CDV-H) to this receptor facilitates fusion and virus entry in cooperation with the fusion protein (CDV-F). We investigated whether CDV strains co-evolved in the large, homogeneous domestic dog population exhibited specialist traits, and strains adapted to the heterogeneous environment of smaller populations of different carnivores exhibited generalist traits. Comparison of amino acid sequences of the SLAM binding region revealed higher similarity between sequences from Canidae species than to sequences from other carnivore families. Using an in vitro assay, we quantified syncytia formation mediated by CDV-H proteins from dog and non-dog CDV strains in cells expressing dog, lion or cat SLAM. CDV-H proteins from dog strains produced significantly higher values with cells expressing dog SLAM than with cells expressing lion or cat SLAM. CDV-H proteins from strains of non-dog species produced similar values in all three cell types, but lower values in cells expressing dog SLAM than the values obtained for CDV-H proteins from dog strains. By experimentally changing one amino acid (Y549H) in the CDV-H protein of one dog strain we decreased expression of specialist traits and increased expression of generalist traits, thereby confirming its functional importance. A virus titer assay demonstrated that dog strains produced higher titers in cells expressing dog SLAM than cells expressing SLAM of non-dog hosts, which suggested possible fitness benefits of specialization post-cell entry. We provide in vitro evidence for the expression of specialist and generalist traits by CDV strains, and fitness trade-offs across carnivore host environments caused by antagonistic pleiotropy. These findings extend knowledge on CDV molecular epidemiology of particular relevance to wild carnivores.",

Specialists are expected to have reduced fitness in heterogeneous environments whereas the fitness of generalists in homogeneous environments is expected to be below that of a specialist. Such fitness trade-offs may be caused by antagonistic pleiotropy, in which a beneficial mutation in one environment is either harmful or neutral in another environment, or mutations that are neutral in the environment in which they arose are deleterious in another [3, 5, 8] . Specialists are thought to evolve more rapidly than generalists because selection for beneficial traits and against harmful traits is expected to occur more rapidly in homogeneous environments [1, 10] .",

Some viruses are described as specialists if they infect one or only a few closely related host species whereas others are viewed as generalists if they infect multiple hosts including species from different taxonomic groups [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . On a finer scale, a generalist multi-host virus is likely to exist as several distinct genetic strains that circulate in overlapping but distinct ranges of host species [16] [17] [18] [19] . Should particular strains of a multihost virus evolve in one (of several possible) host species, they are expected to experience strong co-evolution and thus become specialist strains with increased fitness in the host to which they are adapted. Strains of the same multi-host virus that evolve in heterogeneous host environments composed of several species would experience weaker co-evolution and become generalist strains [5, 7, 8, 11, 13] . The fitness of generalist strains should be higher than that of specialist strains in all host species except for the particular species that specialist strains were adapted to. Thus, specialist and generalist strains of a multi-host virus are expected to show trade-offs in their relative fitness in different host environments.",

Between 55 and 60 million years ago this order diverged into two suborders, the Feliformia and Caniformia [28] . Outbreaks of CDV have occurred in species within both the Caniformia, such as the domestic dog (Canis familiaris), African wild dog (Lycaon pictus) blackfooted ferret (Mustela nigripes) and Baikal seal (Pusa sibirica), and Feliformia, such as the African lion (Panthera leo) and spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta) [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] . Sensitivity to CDV varies greatly, even among species within one family. For example, in the Felidae, domestic cats (Felis catus) exposed to CDV seroconvert but do not develop clinical disease [34, 35] , whereas large felids both seroconvert and develop clinical disease [29, 31] .",

Interestingly, the CDV-H protein is the most variable H protein among all members of the genus Morbillivirus, which may explain why CDV has a far broader host range than other morbilliviruses [37] . In cultured cells, infection frequently leads to the formation of multinucleated cells known as syncytia. The proficiency of syncytium formation is chiefly determined by the CDV-H protein [38] . Currently, the only described [39] cellular receptor for the CDV-H protein on host lymphatic cells is the signaling lymphocytic activation molecule (SLAM, CD150). In humans it is expressed on immature thymocytes, memory T cells, and a subset of B cells and is rapidly induced in a wide range of immune cells after activation [40] [41] [42] . The importance of SLAM binding for CDV pathogenesis was experimentally demonstrated [43] . Measles virus (another Morbillivirus) also binds to SLAM, CD150 [40] [41] [42] and some strains are known to bind to cell receptor CD46 in both epithelial and immune cells [44] . Although it is unlikely that the CDV-H protein binds to CD46 [43] , other as yet unidentified receptors are thought to exist on lymphatic and epithelial cells [45] .",

Current information on the amino acid at site 549 in CDV strains worldwide suggests that positive selection at site 549 may be driven by adaptation of strains to their host species, given that the vast majority of domestic dog strains (and strains from other species in the Canidae family) have Y at this site, whereas strains from species in other carnivore families mostly have H at this site [49] .",

We then tested the predicted expression of specialist traits and generalist traits (detailed in Table 1 ) both at syncytia formation and virus production using two in vitro assays. The syncytia formation assay measured a parameter relevant to cell entry, i.e., the mean number of nuclei per syncytium formed by CDV-H proteins from domestic dog and non-dog CDV strains in cells expressing SLAM from the domestic dog, SLAM from the African lion and SLAM from the domestic cat. The virus titer assay measured virus production post cell entry by the same CDV strains in cells expressing SLAM from the same three carnivore species. Both assays provided results consistent with the predicted expression of specialist traits by CDV-H proteins and strains from domestic dog in cells expressing domestic dog SLAM and generalist traits by CDV-H proteins and strains from non-dog hosts regardless of which species SLAM was expressed on cells. Finally, we investigated antagonistic pleiotropic effects of the residue at site 549 in the CDV-H protein in different host receptor environments. We predicted that experimental substitution of residue Y, characteristic of domestic dog CDV strains at site 549, with residue H, typical for CDV strains from non-dog hosts [46, 49] , in the CDV-H protein from one domestic dog strain would decrease expression of specialist traits in the syncytia formation assay, which is what our results showed.",

In support of this idea our analysis of SLAM amino acid sequences from carnivores revealed a high similarity (99%) between sequences from three species in the Canidae, and the predicted far lower similarities (72.9-85.2%) between these canid SLAM sequences and SLAM sequences from six species in other carnivore families (Felidae, Hyenidae, Mustelidae and Phocidae figure 1a) . Results from the syncytia formation assay provided in vitro evidence consistent with the predicted expression of specialist or generalist traits by CDV-H proteins from CDV strains of domestic dogs and non-dog species, respectively (Table 1) . Results from the virus titer assay which measured trait expression post cell entry were also mostly consistent with these predictions.

[46] proposed that the replacement of residue Y by H at site 549 in the SLAM binding region of the CDV-H protein permitted CDV to spread from domestic dogs to other carnivore species. This hypothesis, within the evolutionary framework of specialists and generalists, suggests that the experimental substitution Y549H in a domestic dog strain would create a mutant expected to express traits more similar to generalist non-dog strains than the specialist traits of dog strains. Our results conformed to this expectation as the mutant CDV-H protein from strain A75/17-549H performed significantly less well than the CDV-H protein of the parent domestic dog strain (A75/ 17) in cells expressing SLAM from domestic dogs. Also, as predicted, CDV-H protein of the mutant strain (A75/17-549H) performed significantly better than the CDV-H protein from the parent virus in cell lines expressing lion SLAM or domestic cat SLAM. Thus, the residue substitution Y549H caused a significant decline in the expression of specialist traits and an increase in the expression of generalist traits. These results are consistent with the idea that specialist traits that emerge from strong co-evolution in a homogeneous environment entail the cost of reduced fitness in the heterogeneous environments, and that this trade-off is a result of antagonistic pleiotropy [3, 5, 8] .",

Strain Dog94SE was isolated from a domestic dog close to the Serengeti ecosystem, Tanzania, in 1994, the Lion94SNP isolate was obtained from a lion during a CDV outbreak in wildlife in the Serengeti National Park, Tanzania, in 1994. As these two strains were obtained in the same year and within the same geographical area of Tanzania, from a domestic dog and non-dog host, they are well suited to test for specialist and generalist traits, as the null hypothesis would predict CDV strains from the same geographical area and time-frame should perform equally in our assays. These two CDV isolates from Tanzania were initially isolated in dog PBMCs in 1994 and then were kept at 280uC until this study. Strain A75/17 was recovered from a domestic dog [64] and maintained by passaging it on VeroDogSLAM cells. Strain 5804P is a domestic ferret (Mustela putorius) adapted CDV strain [65] derived when the Vero cell-adapted wild-type strain 5804 was passaged three times through domestic ferrets. The wild-type strain 5804 was initially isolated from a CDV infected domestic dog in dog PBMCs. Adaptation to Vero cells probably explains why strain 5804P performed marginally better (figure 3c) than other strains tested ( figure 3a,b,d) in SLAM-negative Vero cells in the virus titer assay.",

If the effect is lower than 0.5, then the values for that category tend to take on smaller values than the results for all factor categories. The smaller the relative marginal effect, the stronger is the tendency to smaller values with respect to the average distribution. If the effect is larger than 0.5, then the values for that factor category tend to take on larger values than the results for all factor categories.

(a) Phylogenetic analysis of amino acid sequences of carnivore SLAM (CD150) protein (for details see supplementary information-methods), (b) Flow cytometry analysis of parental Vero cells and derived cell lines stably expressing domestic dog, lion, and cat SLAM (CD150) receptors. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0050955.g001 cell lines (ATS = 39.25; df = 2, 15; p,0.0001), and this change in ability across receptor cell lines depended on strain identity (ATS = 11.81; df = 4.38, '; p,0.0001). As expected from the lack of clinical symptoms in domestic cats, the MNN per syncytium was significantly smaller in domestic cat SLAM cells (figure 2b, white bars) than in lion SLAM cell lines (figure 2b, grey bars) across CDV-H proteins (ATS = 42.43; df = 1, 10; p,0.0001). The MNN per syncytium with CDV-H proteins of domestic dog strains Dog94SE and A75/17 significantly changed between receptor cell lines (ATS = 74.97; df = 1.98, 14.7; p,0.0001). Consistent with predicted specialist traits (table 1), post-hoc comparisons demonstrated a significantly higher MNN per syncytium with CDV-H proteins of both domestic dog strains in domestic dog SLAM (figure 2b, black bars) than in lion SLAM cell line (ATS = 67.11; df = 1, 8.90; p,0.0001; figure 2b, grey bars) or domestic cat SLAM cell line (ATS = 60.53; df = 1, 9.54; p,0.0001; figure 2b, white bars). The CDV-H proteins of strains Dog94SE and A75/17 also induced a significantly higher MNN per syncytium in the domestic dog SLAM cell line (figure 2b, black bars) than CDV-H proteins of strains 5804P and Lion94SNP and the mutated CDV-H protein A75/17-549H (contrast analysis, ATS = 13.12; df = 1, 5; p = 0.0076, figure 2b, black bars). Consistent with predicted generalist traits (table 1), CDV-H proteins of strains 5804P, Lion94SNP and mutant A75/17-549H showed similar MNN per syncytium in cells expressing SLAM of the two known CDV host species i.e., in lion SLAM and domestic dog SLAM cells (ATS = 1.71; df = 1, 8.93; p = 0.22, figure 2b grey and black bars). The CDV-H proteins of the non-dog strains 5804P and Lion94SNP, and the mutant CDV-H protein A75/17-549H induced significantly higher MNN per syncytium in lion SLAM and domestic cat SLAM cell lines than those of the two domestic dog strains Dog94SE and A75/17 (contrast analysis, ATS = 8.63; df = 1, 9.92; p,0.0001, figure 2b grey and white bars). Replacing residue Y at site 549 by H in the CDV-H protein of domestic dog strain A75/17 created the experimental CDV-H protein A75/17-549H. This single substitution reduced the MNN per syncytium in cell lines expressing domestic dog SLAM receptors and increased the MNN per syncytia in cells expressing the lion SLAM receptors (contrast analysis of A75/17 against A75/ 17-549H, ATS = 6.20; df = 1, 5.98; p = 0.047; figure 2b). The relative marginal effects on MNN per syncytium by CDV-H proteins from different CDV strains on cells expressing SLAM receptors from different carnivore species are illustrated in figure S5a.(c) Effect of SLAM on virus induced syncytia formationVisual comparison of the size of syncytia formed when domestic dog strains (A75/17 and Dog94SE) and non-dog strains (P5804 and Lion94SNP) were grown on cells expressing SLAM of different species revealed that domestic dog strains induced larger syncytia when grown on cells expressing dog SLAM than in cells expressing lion or cat SLAM. In contrast, the non-dog strains produced similar-sized syncytia in cell lines expressing dog, lion and cat SLAMs (figure 3e). Upon infection of Vero (SLAM negative) cells with any of the CDV strains used in the study, no syncytia were detected during 60 h post infection (data not shown).",
