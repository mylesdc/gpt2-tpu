A powerful experimental method to gain insights on the physical chemical nature of conformational epitopes is the selection of linear peptides that bind with high affinities to a monoclonal antibody of interest by phage display technology. However, the structural characterization of conformational epitopes from these mimotopes is not straightforward, and in the past the interpretation of peptide sequences from phage display experiments focused on linear sequence analysis to find a consensus sequence or common sequence motifs.",

The algorithm uses peptide sequences from phage display experiments as input, and ranks all surface exposed patches according to the frequency distribution of similar residues in the peptides and in the patch. We have tested the performance of the EpiSearch algorithm for six experimental data sets of phage display experiments, the human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2/neu), the antibody mAb Bo2C11 targeting the C 2 domain of FVIII, antibodies mAb 17b and mAb b12 of the HIV envelope protein gp120, mAb 13b5 targeting HIV-1 capsid protein and 80R of the SARS coronavirus spike protein. In all these examples the conformational epitopes as determined by the X-ray crystal structures of the antibody-antigen complexes, were found within the highest scoring patches of EpiSearch, covering in most cases more than 50% residues of experimental observed conformational epitopes. Input options of the program include mapping of a single peptide or a set of peptides on the antigen structure, and the results of the calculation can be visualized on our interactive web server.",

            "text": "The identification of conformational epitopes in antibody-antigen interaction is a crucial step for the rational design of novel drugs and vaccines. The most direct experimental method to accurately define an epitope is to determine the 3D structure of the antibody-antigen complex by X-ray crystallography 1-5 however these methods are timeconsuming and need purified protein complexes. An alternative approach makes use of screening biological peptide libraries with antibodies to identify peptides that mimic conformational epitopes. [6] [7] [8] A library of peptides is generated by filamentous phages that display a random set of peptides on their surfaces. The antigen binding site on the antibody, used in the screening, will select those peptides from the random phase libraries that have a subset of similar residues in common with the conformational epitope of the antigen. In iterative procedures of biopanning the libraries with the antibody of interest, residues important for binding can then be enriched in the phage sequences. Phage display methods have been shown to experimentally identify residues critical for antigen-antibody interactions. [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] It has been shown that the peptides obtained from random phage libraries can mimic conformational epitopes, thus they are also referred as mimotopes. 9, [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] The peptide sequences of mimotopes are found quite often be different from those of the natural antigen, thus the assignment of conformational epitopes from the peptide sequences can not be done by sequence alignment of the selected peptides with the sequence of the antigen. Conformational epitopes are formed in most cases by a small group of amino acid residues scattered along the protein sequence yet form contiguous clusters of residues on the protein surface. 9, 17, 18 Methods using only the linear sequence of the antigen are thus not applicable in most cases.",

EpiSearch is based on a patch analysis that identifies spatial contiguous clusters of residues on the surface of the antigen with similar physicalchemical properties as found in the phage display sequences. Similarity of residues is measured by a physical-chemical property distance that was derived from five descriptors of amino acid residues. [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] The performance of the EpiSearch algorithm has been tested for six experimental data sets of phage display experiments and compared to the conformational epitopes as found by the X-ray crystal structures of the corresponding antibody-antigen complexes. The highest-scoring patch of EpiSearch was found in all the test cases overlapping with the experimentally observed conformational epitopes, and the predicted conformational epitopes cover in most cases more than 50% residues of the conformational epitopes. In the online version of the EpiSearch method, users can map a single consensus sequence or up to thirty peptide sequences at a time. The output results from EpiSearch are displayed in a table and automatically mapped on the 3D structure using Jmol molecule viewer. 25",

Trastuzumab, also known under the trade name Herceptin, is a humanized monoclonal antibody that inhibits growth of Her-2/ neu expressing tumor cells, and has been approved as immunotherapy for breast cancer patients. [27] [28] [29] [30] The group of E. Jensen-Jarolim has isolated five peptides each 12 residue long from phage display experiments to characterize the epitope of the antibody trastuzumab on the human epidermal growth factor receptor-2, Her-2/neu. 28, 29 The conformational epitope of trastuzumab on Her-2/neu has also been determined by a co-crystal structure of a trastuzumab Fab fragment with the extra cellular domain of the HER2 receptor, PDB id: 1N8Z. 30 Main residues representing the conformational trastuzumab epitope are located in the C terminal of domain-IV with the three segments of amino acids 557-561, 569-573 and 591-603 respectively. Multiple sequence alignment shows no consensus region between the sequences of the phage display peptides and the HER-2/neu sequence. 28 High scoring patches on Her-2/neu were predicted by EpiSearch in two locations ranging from residues 200 to 300 and 550 to 600 ( Fig. 2A ). The patch with the highest score (0.910) was found with the center at residue C565, and the second highest score was found centered at residue C214 (Score: 0.882). The individual score profiles for all 5 peptides are shown in a close-up views in Figure 2B and Figure 2C . Patches at the third and fourth rank were found at K569 with a score 0.774 and at Y568 (Score: 0.766) overlapping with the patch at C565. Other high scoring patches at residues 272 and 283 are near the patch centered at C214 on the surface of Her-2/neu.",

The predicted residues form a large part of the conformational epitope as determined by the X-ray crystal structure of the Bo2C11 mAb-C 2 domain (Fig. 4A) .

The amino acids predicted by the EpiSearch method were observed at the interface site of the spike protein and its receptor ACE2, and may represent the possible binding site for anti-SARS monoclonal antibody, 80R. When the peptide sequences were tested independently, we found that with the exception of the peptide no 12 and 16, ten peptides mapped correctly in the interface region while five mapped in a patch centered at residue L355, a site also predicted by Tarnovitski et al 40 on SARS Coronoavirus. Very low sequence identity among the input peptide sequences may be responsible for the prediction of multiple binding sites. However, all the peptide sequences satisfying the criteria defined by equation (3) were found in a patch centered at residue F460.",

Table 1 gives an overview of the accuracy of EpiSearch method and shows that the method correctly predicted the location of conformational epitopes. Despite the low sequence similarity among the input peptide sequences, the residues in the highest scoring patch shared approximately 70% sequence identity with the residues in the input peptide sequences. In our analysis, we observed that, though all the residues in the input peptide sequences were not present in the epitope binding sites, a highest scoring patch correctly predicted the location of the conformational epitopes as found in the crystal structure. Except in case of mAb 17b peptides, the extent of coverage to locate the conformational epitope site in all the test cases was found to be more than 50% (Table 1 ). In case of mAb 17b the second high scoring patch performed better than the top scoring patch. The second high scoring patch partially overlapped with the top scoring patch and contained seven of the eleven residues present in the mAb 17b interface. In case of Trastuzumab, mAb 17b, mAb b12 and mAb 13b5 peptides, we also determined the influence of terminal cysteine (Cys) residues on the quality of the results. Experimentally, the terminal cysteine residues were introduced to constrain the peptides to a cyclic structure and might influence the selection process. We observed that in most of the cases the result was not sensitive to the presence of the Cys as terminal residues. However, in the case of mAb 17b bound gp120 the constrained loop peptides gave a better result than the analysis performed without the terminal Cys residues, which is evident from the presence of a Cys residue in the epitope binding site of gp120. 35, 36 The performance of the EpiSearch method was compared with the online version of the PepSurf method (http://pepitope.tau.ac.il/), 42 see Table 2 .",

The EpiSearch method assumes that all peptides that are selected during the bio-panning process use a subset of the actual antigenantibody interactions, and that the ensemble of all sequences sample most of favourable interactions in the protein-antibody interface. Therefore only surface patches that have a relative high number of matching residues for all peptide sequences are selected in our prediction process.

In all six cases the highest scoring patches overlap with the experimentally known epitopes as shown in the number of correctly predicted residues (column 6). This number is then compared to the number of all residues in the epitope sites (column 4), given as coverage, TP/(TP + Fn), in column 7, and also compared to the number of all predicted residues in that patch, given as overlap ratio, TP/(TP + FP), in column 8.

The phage display technique first introduced by G. Smith 49 has been successfully used to screen a large peptide libraries that binds to a specific antibody. Simple comparison of the linear sequences of the selected peptides to the sequence of the antigen is in most cases not possible, as the peptides selected from the phage display experiment represent discontinuous fragments of amino acids that may not have a high sequence homology to the antigen.

            "text": "A number of computational methods used to identify the epitopes on the antigen structure have been reported earlier. 9, 13, [15] [16] [17] [18] 33, 37, 42, [50] [51] [52] Most of these methods are either computationally expensive or unable to process a large number of peptide sequences at a time as discussed in detail by Mayrose et al. 37 EnShell-Seijffers et al 18 described a method that can be used to find the most frequent tandem pairs of amino acids selected from the phage display peptide library. The algorithm defines the statistically significant pairs of amino acids (AAP) by calculating the distance between two C\u03b1 atoms of adjacent residues. The AAP can be considered if the distance between to consecutive C\u03b1 is less than a given threshold value, D (the distance between alpha carbon of any given pair). Each peptide sequence obtained from the phage libraries are deconvoluted into AAPs and the most significant pairs were mapped on the protein surface. A new version of Enshell et al algorithm known as Mapitope, 17 is available which depends on the selection of the distance between C\u03b1 atoms of any given pair and the statistical threshold values. Other methods, Findmap, 53 3DEX 16 and MIMOX 33 uses one peptide sequence (or a consensus peptide sequence) at a time while PepSurf 37,42 becomes highly CPU time intensive when longer peptides are used 37 and the performance of the MIMOP 9 relies on the multiple sequence alignment of peptide sequences. The ability of the EpiSearch method to predict genuine epitope binding site on the antigen surface was also tested using a single peptide sequence as well as a group of three, five and if possible nine, fourteen and twenty sequences. As shown in Table 1 , the EpiSearch method correctly mapped the location of conformation epitopes. However, subtle differences were observed when the input peptide sequences shared a low sequence identity. 16, 17, 33, 42 Major advantages of EpiSearch are its flexibility for handling a single peptide sequence or a group of peptide sequences and its efficiency to process a large number of peptide sequences in a very short time. Based on tested examples shown here the average processing time is about one minute which may vary depending on the size of the input protein data file used. Also the EpiSearch method is flexible enough and allows the user to vary the cut off value for solvent accessible surface area of amino acids and the patch size. For example, in the case of Trastuzumab peptides, the method correctly predicts six residues using a 10\u00c5 patch size and three residues using a patch size of 8\u00c5 compared to nine residues using a patch size of 12\u00c5. Similarly, in the case of mAb Bo2C11, the method correctly predicts five residues using a patch size of 10\u00c5 compared to seven residues using a patch size of 12\u00c5. A further decrease in patch size predicts only four residues. A patch size below 10\u00c5 can accommodate fewer residues present in the 12-mer peptide and therefore recommends to use peptide sequences up to seven (7-mer) or nine (9-mer) residues long. The results obtained from the web server are shown interactively in a tabular form as well on the protein surface using JMOL molecular viewer. 25 In addition, using the information about the surface exposed residues, EpiSearch method can be used to design peptides that might interfere with protein-protein interactions. Also, we hope that the results obtained from the EpiSearch method in combination with the information available from site directed mutagenesis will provide a vital resource to understand the nature of the antigen-antibody interaction in greater details.
