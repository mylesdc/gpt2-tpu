The effectiveness of these drugs has been dramatically limited by the rapid spread of drug resistant mutations, mainly at sites S31N, V27A and L26F in the pore of the channel. Despite progress in designing inhibitors of V27A and L26F M2, there are currently no drugs targeting these mutated channels in clinical trials. Progress in developing new drugs has been hampered by the lack of a robust assay with sufficient throughput for discovery of new active chemotypes among chemical libraries and sufficient sensitivity to provide the SAR data essential for their improvement and development as drugs. In this study we adapted a yeast growth restoration assay, in which expression of the M2 channel inhibits yeast growth and exposure to an M2 channel inhibitor restores growth, into a robust and sensitive high-throughput screen for M2 channel inhibitors. A screen of over 250,000 pure chemicals and semi-purified fractions from natural extracts identified 21 active compounds comprising amantadine, rimantadine, 13 related adamantanes and 6 non-adamantanes. Of the non-adamantanes, hexamethylene amiloride and a triazine derivative represented new M2 inhibitory chemotypes that also showed antiviral activity in a plaque reduction assay. Of particular interest is the fact that the triazine derivative was not sufficiently potent for detection as an inhibitor in the traditional two electrode voltage clamp assay for M2 channel activity, but its discovery in the yeast assay led to testing of analogues of which one was as potent as amantadine.",

The M2 proton channel is required for virus replication and maturation. After the virus is taken up into the host cell by endocytosis, the low pH of the endosome activates the M2 channel to allow proton flux from the endosome into the viral interior. This acidification dissociates the viral RNA from its bound matrix proteins and permits release of the viral genetic material to the cytoplasm for replication [13] . The M2 protein also equilibrates the pH gradient between the Golgi lumen and the cytoplasm to prevent premature conformational changes of hemagglutinin during viral maturation [14, 15] . M2 is a homotetramer with each chain consisting of a short unstructured extracellular N-terminal domain (residues 1-24) that is important for incorporation into the virion; a single transmembrane domain that is necessary and sufficient for tetramerization, proton conductance and drug binding; an amphiphilic membraneassociated a-helix (residues 47-61) that is important for viral budding and scission; and a unstructured C-terminal cytoplasmic tail (residues 62-97) that interacts with matrix protein M1 [16] . Amantadine binds the transmembrane region with its charged amino group mimicking hydronium [17] . Because the proton conductance rate of the channel has to match the pH sensitivity of hemagglutinin [14, 18] , of the large number of amantadineresistant mutations that have been identified in vitro, only three have been identified in transmissible viruses [19, 20] . These are single amino acid substitutions in the channel -V27A, L26F or S31N.",

Methods of assaying ion channel activity are labor intense and technically demanding [21, 22, 23] and therefore unsuitable for high-throughput screens of chemical libraries. Krystal et al. showed that when the M2 channel gene was expressed in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a proton-selective channel was formed that disrupted the electrochemical potential across the yeast membrane and inhibited yeast growth, and that compounds that block M2 channel activity were able to restore growth [24] . The same principle was also applied using E. Coli but was not implemented for high throughput screening [25] . In this study, we developed the yeast growth restoration assay into a highthroughput screen for inhibitors of the M2 channel. We used it to discover not only additional analogs of known M2 channel inhibitors, but also amiloride derivatives and substituted triazines that represent chemotypes previously unrecognized as M2 channel inhibitors and that provide new starting points for influenza drug development.",

The IC 50 values obtained with the TEVC assay are therefore one or two orders of magnitude larger than in cellular assays that are conducted at longer time scales [27] . In accordance with these expectations, spiroadamantane amine clearly increased growth of the V27A strain at 0.01 mM and above, with an EC 50 of 0.3 mM (Fig. 2) . It also restored growth of the WT M2 strain in the same concentration range (Fig. 2) . Interestingly, the spiroadamantane amine was 3-fold more potent against the WT M2 strain (EC 50 = 0.03 mM) (Fig. 2 ) than amantadine (EC 50 = 0.1 mM).",

Examination of the active adamantanes (Fig. 4) shows that a wide variety of substitutions are tolerated at either the 1 or 2 position of adamantane, including substituted benzyl (2, 3, 4 and 5), fivemembered heterocycles (6, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13) and a sixmembered heterocycle substitution (1).

This finding is consistent with earlier studies that suggest that the ammonium serves to mimic the hydronium ion in the M2 channel [33] . Additionally, compounds 10, 12, 13, 14 and 18 bear basic heterocycles, acylguanidine or tertiary amines that might also be protonated at near neutral or slightly acidic pH.

Interestingly, the two compounds with hydrophobic scaffolds of more than seven carbon atoms were active (Fig. 5 ) while all others were essentially inactive in this assay (,20% inhibition at 100 mM) (Table S1 ). Active compounds 33 and 34 were tested in the yeast growth restoration assay and showed EC 50 values of 0.7 mM and 0.3 mM respectively, compared with an EC 50 of 12 mM for triazine 18. Given the good correspondence between inhibition at 100 mM in the TEVC assay and potency in the yeast assay for compounds identified here, and the fact that the TEVC assay requires much higher inhibitor concentrations than the yeast assay to show activity, we surmise that triazine 18 is not a false positive from the yeast assay but rather a true M2 inhibitor that is not sufficiently potent to be detected by the TVEC assay. Taken together, these results point to the importance of the contribution of the hydrophobic scaffolds to the high activity of the inhibitors (compound 14, 33 and 34) of WT M2 rather than the polar headgroup, which explains why a wide variety of polar headgroups can be tolerated.",

Compounds 1-19, 33 and 34 were tested against these two mutants in the yeast assay. Compound 16 showed significant activity against the V27A mutant (EC 50 = 7 mM) and was inactive against S31N while all other compounds were inactive against V27A or S31N. Compounds 14, 18, and 20-34 were also tested at 100 mM against the S31N and V27A mutant channels in the TEVC assay and were found to be inactive ( Fig. 5 and Table S1 ). Two potent adamantanes (6 and 10) and two non-adamantanes (14, 34) were further tested for inhibition of influenza A replication in a MDCK plaque reduction assay [27] , with amantadine as a positive control. All four compounds completely inhibited plaque formation at 10 mM (Fig. 6) . At 1 mM, compounds 6 and 10 almost completely inhibited plaque formation, comparable to 1 mM amantadine, compound 34 showed moderate inhibition, and compound 14 had nearly no effect (Fig. 6) . The potency of the antiviral effect of 6, 10 and 34 was consistent with their low EC 50 in the yeast growth restoration assays (0.2 mM, 0.3 mM and 0.3 mM, respectively) , compared with an EC 50 of 0.1 mM for amantadine. The good potency of compound 34 agreed with its TEVC assay result showing 89.7% inhibition at 100 mM (92.0% for amantadine at 100 mM). Hexamethyleneamiloride 14, which was less potent in the yeast assay (EC 50 = 1.1 mM) was also less potent in the plaque reduction assay. The four compounds were also tested for cytotoxicity towards uninfected MDCK cells. Compounds 6, 10 and 34 showed very low cytotoxicity, indicative of a good activity window, while hexamethyleneamiloride was more cytotoxic, with a CC 50 of 16 mM (Fig. 6) , indicative of a less favorable activity window. Overall, the results demonstrate that the yeast growth restoration assay can identify M2 inhibitors with antiviral activity.",

            "text": "In this study, we modified an assay described by Krystal et al [24] and optimized it for high-throughput screening, notably by expressing M2 in a yeast strain with defective drug efflux systems [45] , and by simplifying and automating assay conditions. The resulting growth restoration assay is robust, highly sensitive, quantitative, cost-effective and technically simple. We found that the yeast growth inhibition was greatest for WT, giving rise to a good Z' factor for screening. Because a successful drug should inhibit WT M2 as well as amantadine-resistant mutated forms, we use WT in the primary screen followed by testing of active compounds against mutants in secondary assays. Our screen of over 250,000 pure chemicals and semi-purified fractions from natural extracts identified only 21 active compounds. This 0.008% hit rate is 10-to 100-fold lower than typically encountered in screens for other targets. The assay shows high selectivity for M2 channel inhibitors as further testing of the 21 active compounds revealed no false positives. In positive readout cell-based assays, high selectivity is imparted largely by the requirement for active compounds to both inhibit their target and not hamper cell growth, effectively eliminating many non-selective active chemicals. However, since we have observed higher hit rates in yeast growth restoration assays with other targets [46] , the very low hit rate and the paucity of chemical classes identified indicates that M2 is not easily inhibited by the drug-like synthetic chemicals assembled in commercially available libraries. Natural products are known to encompass a much wider range of biologically relevant chemical space, so we were surprised that our large-scale screen of semi-purified fractions obtained from natural extracts did not yield a single hit. We do not believe this is due to technical factors such as testing of the fractions at too low a concentration to reveal activity [47] . Rather, we think this indicates that the M2 channel can be selectively inhibited by very few pharmacophores and that it is a challenging target for drug development. Nonetheless, the screen identified two compounds with novel structures for M2 channel inhibitors -hexamethylene amiloride 14 and triazine 18. Further testing in the TEVC assay confirmed that hexamethylene amiloride 14 inhibited the M2 channel, and subsequent SAR evaluation of amiloride analogs showed that hydrophobicity played a critical role in M2 channel inhibition. Hexamethylene amiloride 14 is a known inhibitor of the mammalian Na + /H + exchanger [48] , and is also active against the HCV proton channel p7, the HIV-1 Vpu ion channel and the SARS Coronavirus envelope protein ion channel activity [49, 50, 51] . Hexamethylene amiloride 14 inhibits the mammalian Na + /H + exchanger with an apparent K i of 0.2 mM [52] , more potently than it inhibits M2 in the yeast assay (EC 50 = 1 mM) and therefore does not appear to be a good drug candidate. An azolo-1,2,4-triazine derivative has been described as an inhibitor of influenza A and B virus replication [53] , with an uncharacterized mechanism of action. Triazines 18, 33 and 34 described here are considerably different and have not previously been linked to the inhibition of ion channels. Triazine 34 completely inhibited influenza A replication at 10 mM and was not very toxic to MDCK cells (CC 50 = 75 mM). These compounds may be good starting points for drug discovery. The high sensitivity of this yeastbased assay also revealed that the spiroadamantane amine shown in Fig. 2 is not only highly potent against the amantadine-resistant V27A mutant as reported [26] , but that it is a 3-fold more potent inhibitor of the WT M2 channel than amantadine and rimantadine, and may therefore be a candidate for drug development. Together, these results demonstrate the value of the yeast growth restoration assay for high throughput screening of M2 inhibitors and discovery of anti-influenza agents.",

The coding sequences of the Udorn WT, S31N and V27A M2 genes were introduced downstream of the GAL1 promoter by PCR amplification followed by recombination cloning in yeast. Plasmids were rescued from the yeast strains and coding sequences were sequenceverified. The yeast strains were propagated in synthetic complete (SC) medium pH 6.5 lacking leucine and containing glucose to repress M2 gene expression. To measure growth under M2 expression conditions, yeast were harvested by centrifugation, the pellets were washed with water to remove traces of glucose and they were suspended to A 600 = 0.008 in liquid SC medium pH 6.5 lacking leucine and containing 2% galactose. 100 ml samples were distributed into 96-well plates and incubated at 30uC in a humidified chamber, without agitation. A 600 was measured in a microplate reader at different times after suspending the cells by gentle but thorough vortexing.",
