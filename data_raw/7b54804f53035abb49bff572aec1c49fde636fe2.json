The goal of this study was to explore the contextual factors that inhibited the ability of emergency nurses to perform their duties in response to an outbreak. Methods: A qualitative descriptive design was used to explore the experiences and perceptions of emergency nurses. Participants were purposively recruited from 12 emergency departments in Hong Kong. Semi-structured face-to-face individual interviews were conducted with 26 emergency nurses. The audio-recorded interviews were transcribed verbatim and interpreted with a thematic analysis approach. Results: Four intertwined themes emerged from the analysis: resource constraints, threats of infection, ubiquitous changes and lingering uncertainties. These themes portrayed the constraints and challenges surrounding the work environment of emergency nurses. Conclusion: This study described the instabilities and vulnerabilities of the circumstances in which the emergency nurses were situated in during epidemic events. The findings shed light on the importance of hospitals and emergency departments in addressing both the technical problems and adaptive challenges that face emergency nurses during epidemic events.",

During the course of an EID event, accident and emergency departments (AEDs) take on a wider role by actively participating in the planning for and response to public health threats from EIDs on top of continuing to manage urgent illnesses and injuries. Apart from the distinguishing feature of emergency care in offering prompt intervention to patients in critical condition, the public health function of AEDs in assessing, monitoring and promoting the health of community members is considered a longstanding priority in managing epidemics (Menchine, Zhou, Lotfipour, & Chakravarthy, 2016) . The extended nature of emergency services in an EID event requires emergency nurses to demonstrate not only the capability to offer emergency care services to the public but also the capacity to participate in public health responses and combat a large-scale public health emergency.",

            "text": "In addition to their important role in the public health response to an epidemic event, emergency nurses also face barriers to fulfilling their duties in the course of EID management. They have been shown to be non-compliant with guidelines and protocols intended to prevent the spread of EIDs, such as adherence to hand hygiene practices (Muller, Carter, Siddiqui, & Larson, 2015) and personal protective equipment (PPE) usage (Baduge, Moss, & Morphet, 2017) . Studies have revealed that limitations in time and resources were the major cause of non-compliance with recommended practices (Lam, Kwong, Hung, & Pang, 2016; Muller et al., 2015) . Interestingly, it has also been reported that the issue of emergency nurses' non-compliance with guidelines could still occur, regardless of the availability of sufficient resources (Lam & Hung, 2013) . This suggests the existence of other contextual factors that affect the decision about whether to conform to a protocol. Studies have also been conducted to identify factors affecting the practices of healthcare workers in the course of outbreak management. These studies showcase the important role of institutions in offering training, guidance and incentives to frontline staff (Craig et al., 2018; Greenberg et al., 2019) . What is less clear is which factors in the emergency care setting adversely affect the ability of emergency nurses to engage in an EID outbreak response. This lack of knowledge could lead to difficulties in devising appropriate strategies to address non-compliance and could directly affect the role of emergency nurses in EID management. Understanding emergency nurses' experiences and perceptions of disease management during epidemic events might help identify and address the barriers to their involvement in EID management. The goal of this study was to identify and explore the contextual factors that inhibited the ability of emergency nurses to perform outbreak-response-related duties according to established protocols (Lam, Kwong, Hung, & Pang, 2016; Muller et al., 2015) .",

The identified issues often pertained to workplace susceptibility and resource constraints, which nurses are used to encountering and handling in their everyday practice. Furthermore, the changes and uncertainties in the emergency care setting during an epidemic worsen those issues and create unique challenges and obstacles to nursing practices. Indeed, change and uncertainty, which are inherent to the nature of the healthcare industry, are inevitable challenges facing nurses and other healthcare workers, and they create hesitation and fear and that affects the performance and quality of care delivery (Arrowsmith, Lau-Walker, Norman, & Maben, 2016) . During an epidemic event, the healthcare environment is often intertwined with urgency, uncertainty and change, and this scenario requires marked effort from workers to seamlessly maintain healthcare system operations (Cranley, Doran, Tourangeau, Kushniruk, & Nagle, 2012) . Similar results have also been reported in the literature, highlighting the hardships and struggles from bouts of uncertainty and volatility that nurses must endure as the first-line responders under disastrous circumstances (Lam, Kwong, Hung, Pang, & Chiang, 2018) .

The literature suggests that when healthcare workers underestimate the severity of a public health event, it could result in laxness in handling any issues (Dionne, Desjardins, Lebeau, Messier, & Dascal, 2018) .

Such a triage procedure could ensure the meticulous identification of priorities in maintaining core healthcare services.
