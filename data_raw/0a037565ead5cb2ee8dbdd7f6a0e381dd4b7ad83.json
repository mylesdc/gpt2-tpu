Unlike the low pathogenic avian influenza viruses (LPAIVs), highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIVs) cause very severe disease in gallinaceous poultry often leading to 100% mortality within 2-3 days 1 . HPAIVs of H5N1 subtype are of particular concern as certain contemporary Eurasian lineage H5N1 viruses can carry an alarming case fatality rate of up to 50% in humans 2 . Negative strand segmented RNA genomes contribute to the genetic variability of IAVs. In addition, IAVs can infect a wide range of avian and mammalian host species resulting in the emergence of novel subtypes with altered species tropism and/or virulence.",

IAVs are known to infect a wide range of avian and mammalian hosts, and it is highly likely that their host range could be broader than currently known, with more reservoirs to be revealed. For example, Northwest Atlantic gray seals have recently been suggested to be an endemically infected wild reservoir population for diverse IAVs 4 . From these natural reservoirs, IAVs can evolve into novel variants which can potentially lead to human pandemics. Influenza pandemics occur time to time with the most recent pandemic being in 2009. It is undisputed that the next influenza pandemic will happen, but the only question is when it will happen. Despite several reports investigating the basis of genetic variability of IAVs, the precise mechanism of pandemic IAV generation still remains an unresolved mystery. It is possible that additional IAV reservoirs are yet to be identified which will help to see the full picture of IAV ecology and evolution.",

            "text": "Bats (order: Chiroptera) are one of the ancient mammals, and their speciation occurred long before the development of most modern mammals. Bats are globally distributed, relatively long lived 5 and represent approximately 24% of all known mammalian species. Further, bats are one of the most diverse families of mammals found in nearly every habitat/continent around the world except Antarctica. More importantly, certain Old World bat species are known to be natural reservoirs of zoonotic viruses that cause some of the deadliest diseases in humans including filoviruses (such as Ebola and Marburg viruses), lyssaviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses and henipaviruses (e.g. Hendra and Nipah viruses) 6, 7 . In addition, bats also act as a major natural reservoir for hepaciviruses and pegiviruses (hepatitis C virus and GB virus B) 8 . Notably, all the zoonotic viruses of bat-origin identified to date are RNA viruses 5 . However, it is believed that the actual diversity of viruses in bats could be much more than what is currently known, as most of the investigations have focused on searching for specific viruses of interest and many additional viruses must have been overlooked 9 .",

These two viruses are genetically distinct from all previously known IAVs and hence are designated as novel subtypes, namely H17N10 and H18N11. These novel IAVs have been recently recovered in cell culture using synthetic DNA 11 . However, these HA and NA subtypes have not been identified in birds serologically or virologically. Consequently, the reservoir(s) of these novel IAV subtypes is still undefined. Phylogenetic studies raised a possibility that bats have the capacity to harbor more influenza virus genetic diversity than all the other mammalian and avian species combined 10 . In addition, it was demonstrated that little yellow-shouldered bats in Central America could constitute a potential sylvatic mammalian reservoir of influenza 12 . Susceptibility of bats to IAVs has been confirmed by recent serological evidence of AIV H9 subtype in about 30% of frugivorous bats from Africa 13 . It is worth noting that detection of antibodies against one AIV subtype in 30% of the bats tested is very significant.",

The expression of the appropriate host cell receptor to which viral haemagglutinin (HA) can bind is the key determinant of the ability of IAVs to infect a host 15 . Avian influenza viruses (AIVs) preferentially bind to SA receptors that are linked to galactose by an \u03b1 2,3 linkage (SA \u03b12,3-Gal), while human and classical swine influenza viruses show preference to \u03b12,6 linked SAs (SA \u03b12,6-Gal). A key source of IAV genetic diversity could be from the replication of IAVs in a non-native host species that initiate evolution of new virus variants 16 . Hosts that co-express both SA \u03b12,3-Gal and SA \u03b12,6-Gal receptors such as chickens, ducks and pigs have been hypothesized to potentially support re-assortment of IAVs and hence play a major role in the evolution of IAVs 14, 17 .",

In contrast SA \u03b12,6-Gal receptors are predominant in the tracheal mucosal lining in chickens, pigs and humans 14, 17 .

However, a recent study rescued these viruses using reverse genetics in cell culture and found that the novel bat influenza viruses can infect a range of mammalian cells including canine cells 29 . All the existing data suggests that bats could be susceptible to many different IAV subtypes and even support co-infection of avian and human IAVs. It is believed that the novel bat influenza viruses found in fruit bats are probably the ancient influenza viruses from which the modern world IAVs have been derived over time 30 . Evidence of high seroprevalence of avian influenza in frugivorous bats together with the evidence of abundant SA receptors in LBBs found in this study, raises a strong possibility that bats could be a major influenza virus reservoir.",

Both lectins were purchased from Vector laboratories (Burlingame, CA, USA). Following three washes with TBS, sections were incubated with Streptavidin Alexafluor 594 conjugate for 2 h at 4\u00b0C. The sections were washed three times with TBS and mounted in ProLongGold antifade reagent with nuclear stain 4\u2032,6-diamino-2-phenylindole, dihydro-chloride (DAPI). Negative controls were performed omitting the primary reagents. Following 24 h of curing at room temperature (RT), sections were imaged using Olympus FluoView \u2122 FV1000 confocal microscope. Settings of the confocal microscope were determined using negative controls to avoid any background fluorescence and the same settings were used to scan all the other sections for consistency. To rule out nonspecific binding of the lectins and IAVs, control tissue sections were treated, prior to lectin staining or virus binding, with Sialidase A (N-acetylneuraminate glycohydrolase; Prozyme, San Leandro, CA), for 2 h at 37\u00b0C, which cleaves all non-reducing terminal sialic acid residues in the order \u03b1(2,6) > \u03b1(2,3) > \u03b1(2,8) > \u03b1 (2, 9) .

Mock-treated tissues(Fig. 3B, D and F) did not exhibit any background staining.SA \u03b12,6-Gal receptors in LLBs are compatible with human H1N1 virus binding. Extensive binding of human H1N1 (A/H1N1/Virginia/2009) virus to LBB trachea, lung and intestine was observed(Fig. 4). As expected, greater binding of H1N1 virus was observed in the lungs(Fig. 4C) which had greater SA \u03b12,6-Gal expression. Notably, very little virus binding was found on the mucosal lining of intestinal villi(Fig. 4E)which had primarily SA \u03b12,3-Gal receptor expression. However, a fair amount of virus binding to the intestinal submucosa was observed. Widespread binding of the H1N1 virus to tracheal mucosa was observed(Fig. 4A). Mock tissues(Fig. 4B, D and F) did not exhibit any background staining.",
