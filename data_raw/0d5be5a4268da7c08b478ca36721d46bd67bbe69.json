            "text": "Background: Avian influenza remains a serious threat to human health. The consequence of human infection varies markedly among different subtypes of avian influenza viruses. In addition to viral factors, the difference in host cellular response is likely to play a critical role. This study aims at elucidating how avian influenza infection perturbs the host's miRNA regulatory pathways that may lead to adverse pathological events, such as cytokine storm, using the miRNA microarray approach. Results: The results showed that dysregulation of miRNA expression was mainly observed in highly pathogenic avian influenza A H5N1 infection. We found that miR-21*, miR-100*, miR-141, miR-574-3p, miR-1274a and miR1274b were differentially expressed in response to influenza A virus infection. Interestingly, we demonstrated that miR-141, which was more highly induced by H5N1 than by H1N1 (p < 0.05), had an ability to suppress the expression of a cytokine -transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b22. This was supported by the observation that the inhibitory effect could be reversed by antagomiR-141. Conclusions: Since TGF-\u03b22 is an important cytokine that can act as both an immunosuppressive agent and a potent proinflammatory molecule through its ability to attract and regulate inflammatory molecules, and previous report showed that only seasonal influenza H1N1 (but not the other avian influenza subtypes) could induce a persistent expression of TGF-\u03b22, we speculate that the modulation of TGF-\u03b22 expression by different influenza subtypes via miR-141 might be a critical step for determining the outcome of either normal or excessive inflammation progression.",

The naive host immune system cannot be the sole explanation as infection of other avian influenza viruses, e.g. H9N2, only results in mild infections [6] . While the predilection of H5N1 towards cells in the lower respiratory tract contributes to the development of severe pneumonia [7] , the available clinico-pathological evidence indicates that the infected patients progress to multi-organ failure early in the course of illness, and the degree of organ failure is out of proportion to the involvement of infection [8] [9] [10] . Cytokine storm and reactive haemophagocytic syndrome are the key features that distinguish H5N1 infection from severe seasonal influenza. These indirect mechanisms seem to play an even more important role than direct cell killing due to lytic viral infection.",

In one report, 36 pig-encoded miRNAs and 22 human-encoded miRNAs were found to have putative targets in swine influenza virus and Swine-Origin 2009 A/H1N1 influenza virus genes, respectively [15] . In another report, results showed that miR-323, miR-491 and miR-654 could inhibit replication of H1N1 influenza A virus through binding to the conserved region of the PB1 gene [16] . These miRNAs could downregulate PB1 expression through mRNA degradation instead of translation repression [16] . Besides targeting influenza virus, cellular miRNAs were also implicated in the lethal infections of mice with a highly pathogenic 1918 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus [17] . A previous study on miRNA gene expression in avian influenza virus infected chicken showed that miR-146, which was previously reported to be associated with immune-related signal pathways in mammals, was found to be differentially expressed in infected tissues [18] . Moreover, a study of profiling cellular miRNAs of lung tissue from cynomolgus macaques infected with a highly pathogenic H5N1 avian and a less pathogenic 1918 H1N1 reassortant virus identified that 23 miRNAs were associated with the extreme virulence of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian virus [19] . Also, the predicted gene targets of the identified miRNAs were found to be associated with aberrant and uncontrolled inflammatory responses and increased cell death [19] .",

The major observations from this work were that influenza A virus infection resulted in the altered regulation of cellular miRNAs. Avian influenza A virus can alter cellular miRNAs to a greater extent than that of seasonal human influenza A virus. Influenza A virus affects the regulation of many cellular processes. In some cases, these changes are directed by the virus for its advantage and others are cellular defense responses to infection. Here, we found that influenza A virus infection led to altered regulation of cellular miRNAs. Given the number of genes that can be regulated by individual miRNAs and the number of miRNAs expressed in cells, this greatly expands the range of possible virus-host regulatory interactions. The complexity is underscored by there being no uniform global pattern of regulation; rather, it appears that individual (or groups of ) miRNA are independently regulated, some positively and some negatively. Persistent and transient effects were seen, and changes in miRNA expression profiles were linked to the time course of infection. As a summary, miR-1246, miR-663 and miR-574-3p were up-regulated (>3-fold, p<0.05) at 24-hour postinfection with subtype H5 as compared with non-infected control cells. Moreover, miR-100*, miR-21*, miR-141, miR-1274a and miR1274b were found to be downregulated (>3-fold, p<0.05) in infection with subtype H5, particularly at 18 or 24 hours post-infection as compared with non-infected control cells. Interestingly, many of the virally regulated miRNAs were predicted by TargetScan to target important biological pathways, immune-related signal pathways and have altered regulation in some cellular defense and some states of cellular differentiation [22] .",

To validate the in silico findings empirically on the target of miR-141, we checked whether transient-transfection of anti-and premir-141 into NCI-H292 cells resulted in TGF-\u03b22 regulation. In our experiment, the transfection efficiency was an important factor affecting the degree of regulation on the target gene(s). In the case of higher transfection efficiency, as more miRNA would be transfected into the cells, the effect of gene(s) regulation by miRNA transfected would be greater. In our study, the transfection efficiency was about 78.2 \u00b1 6.3% (mean \u00b1 SD), which was considered to be adequate for further functional analyses. During transfection, some oligonucleotide molecules were sequestered in internal vesicles and physically separated from their targets in the cytoplasm; and then released during cell lysis.

The time point of 24-hour post-transfection or postinfection was chosen for evaluation because miR-141 induction was observed at the early stage of virus infection, and sufficient time might be required for the miR-141 to have effect on its target(s), so we had chosen 24-hour post-transfection or post-infection for evaluation of the effect of this miRNA. Indeed, upon detecting the TGF-\u03b22 expression at mRNA and protein levels, we found that the altered miR-141 expression would affect the expression of the cytokine-TGF-\u03b22. Literature search on the background of miR-141 confirmed that miR-141 is a member of the miR-200 family (miR-200a, miR-200b, miR-200c, miR-141 and miR-429). Previous studies of miR-141 were mainly on its role in cancer. It has been reported that miR-141 were markedly downregulated in cells that had undergone epithelial to mesenchymal in response to TGF-\u03b2. MiR-141 was also found to be overexpressed in ovarian and colorectal cancers [23, 24] and downregulated in prostate, hepatocellular, renal cell carcinoma and in gastric cancer tissues [25] [26] [27] [28] raising a controversial issue about the role of miR-141 in cancer progression. Furthermore, the miR-200 family members play roles in maintaining the epithelial phenotype of cancer cells [29] . A member of this family -miR-200a was also found to be differentially expressed in response to influenza virus infection in another study [17] . The targets of miR-200a are associated with viral gene replication and the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, which is closely related to type I interferon-mediated innate immune response [17] . However, the effect of miR-141 on virus infection was not known, except one recent report showing that enterovirus can induce miR-141 and contribute to the shutoff of host protein translation by targeting the translation initiation factor eIF4E [30] .",

In this case, there was a decrease in TGF-\u03b22 mRNA level, while the TGF-\u03b22 protein was increased.

That observation coincides with our results in this study, showing that H1N1 infection induced a little amount of miR-141 expression, while H5N1 infection induced a higher amount of miR-141 expression at the early phase of infection. As a consequence of the higher amount of miR-141 in H5N1 infection, TGF-\u03b22 expression might be more greatly reduced than that in H1N1 infection. Since TGF-\u03b22 can act as both an immunosuppressive agent and a potent proinflammatory molecule through its ability to attract and regulate inflammatory molecules, it plays a vital role in T-cell inhibition. Furthermore, it has been reported that TGF-\u03b22 inhibits Th1 cytokine-mediated induction of CCL-2/MCP-1, CCL-3/MIP-1\u03b1, CCL-4/MIP-1\u03b2, CCL-5/RANTES, CCL-9 /MIP-1\u03b3, CXCL-2/MIP-2, and CXCL-10/IP-10 [32] . Moreover, the pro-inflammatory responses during influenza A virus infection are tightly controlled by anti-inflammatory mediators, such as TGF-\u03b22, to protect the easily damageable lung tissue from destructive side effects associated with virus induced inflammation. Therefore, the downregulation of TGF-\u03b22 protein by miR-141 may be an important step in the excessive inflammation progression during influenza A virus infection, particularly in H5N1 infection. However, whether the recovery of TGF-\u03b22 expression by anti-miR miR-141 inhibitor could resolve the hypercytokinemia stage of H5N1 infection needs to be further studied.",

            "text": "Although our findings were obtained from an in vitro model, we could apply these to the real situation of an in vivo model or tissue comprised of different cell types. In real bronchial environments, lung epithelial cells are the key target of influenza viruses [33, 34] . After these cells are infected, they will activate an inflammatory cascade which launches a quick antimicrobial reaction and directs adaptive immunity to mount a protective response. Bronchial epithelial cells therefore modulate the activation of monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells (DC), and T lymphocytes through cytokines and chemokines. Cytokines and chemokines generally function in an autocrine (on the producing cell itself) or paracrine (on nearby cells) manner. These mediators will contribute to the generation of a specific bronchial homeostatic microenvironment that affects the way in which the body copes with the viruses. This homeostatic \"circuit\" can inhibit excessive inflammatory response in lung tissues [35] . For example, TGF-\u03b2 had been reported to mediate a cross-talk between alveolar macrophages and epithelial cells [36] . However, our findings show that, during highly pathogenic H5N1 avian virus infection, miR-141 would be induced shortly after infection. With high level of miR-141, the expression of TGF-\u03b2 would be suppressed from the lung epithelial cells. Without sufficient TGF-\u03b2, the pro-inflammatory response might not be tightly controlled in cases of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian virus infection. This might explain the mechanism concerning bronchial infiltration of inflammatory cells, particularly lymphocytes and eosinophils, and the subsequent hyperresponsiveness of the bronchial wall induced by viral infection.",
