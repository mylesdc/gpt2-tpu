The phospholipase A 2 (PLA 2 ) superfamily consists of a large number of members that specifically catalyse the hydrolysis of phospholipids at a particular position. Here we show that the CM-II isoform of secreted PLA 2 obtained from Naja mossambica mossambica snake venom (CM-II-sPLA 2 ) possesses potent virucidal (neutralising) activity against HCV, DENV and JEV, with 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC 50 ) of 0.036, 0.31 and 1.34 ng/ ml, respectively. In contrast, the IC 50 values of CM-II-sPLA 2 against viruses that bud through the PM (Sindbis virus, influenza virus and Sendai virus) or trans-Golgi network (TGN) (herpes simplex virus) were >10,000 ng/ml. Moreover, the 50% cytotoxic (CC 50 ) and haemolytic (HC 50 ) concentrations of CM-II-sPLA 2 were >10,000 ng/ml, implying that CM-II-sPLA 2 did not significantly damage the PM. These results suggest that CM-II-sPLA 2 and its derivatives are good candidates for the development of broadspectrum antiviral drugs that target viral envelope lipid bilayers derived from the ER membrane.",

The ER-NE-cis-Golgi membranes have lipid packing defects, whereas the trans-Golgi-PM-EE membranes show tight packing of phospholipids 3 . Additionally, the phospholipid contents of the ER-NE-cis-Golgi membranes differ from those of the trans-Golgi-PM-EE membranes. Enveloped viruses acquire their envelope lipid bilayers from host cellular membranes 4 . Consequently, the phospholipid contents of viruses budding through the ER-NE-cis-Golgi membranes differ from those of viruses budding through the trans-Golgi-PM-EE membranes 5-7 .

First, we tested the possible direct virucidal activity of CM-II-sPLA 2 (UniProtKB-P00603 [PA2B2_NAJMO]) against infectious particles of a panel of viruses. Each virus was incubated with various concentrations of CM-II-sPLA 2 or medium as a control at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h and then inoculated onto Huh7it-1 cells. After 1 h of virus adsorption, the residual virus was removed by washing the cells with medium and the cells were cultured for 24 h. The cells were subjected to fluorescent antibody (FA) staining with respective antiviral antibodies to determine the number of virus-infected cells, which represented the inoculum's viral titres (cell-infecting units [CIU]/ml). In some experiments, a plaque assay and 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID 50 ) assay were performed to determine the viral titres of the inocula (plaque-forming units [PFU]/ml and TCID 50 /ml, respectively). The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) was calculated based on the percent reduction of the initial viral titre.",

            "text": "The results demonstrated that CM-II-sPLA 2 efficiently neutralised the infectivity of HCV, DENV and JEV, with 50%-inhibitory concentrations (IC 50 ) of 0.036 ng/ml (0.003 nM), 0.31 ng/ml (0.023 nM) and 1.34 ng/ml (0.10 nM), respectively ( Table 1 ). The dose-dependent inhibition of the viruses by CM-II-sPLA 2 is shown in Supplementary Fig. S1 . HCV, DENV and JEV belong to the family Flaviviridae and are known to bud through the ER membrane [11] [12] [13] . Conversely, CM-II-sPLA 2 even at a dose of 10,000 ng/ml did not exert significant virucidal activity against Sindbis virus (SINV; Togaviridae) 27 , influenza A virus (FLUAV; Orthomyxoviridae) and Sendai virus (SeV; Paramyxoviridae) 28 , which are known to bud through the PM, or herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1; Herpesviridae), which buds through the trans-Golgi network (TGN) 29 . Vesicular stomatitis New Jersey virus (VSNJV; Rhabdoviridae), which also buds through the PM 30 , showed weak sensitivity to CM-II-sPLA 2 , with an IC 50 value of 2,300 ng/ml. The weak CM-II-sPLA 2 sensitivity of VSNJV compared to the insensitivity of SINV, FLUAV and HSV-1 could be attributable to the bullet-shape configuration of VSNJV, which might harbour lipid packing defects at the bottom edge of the bullet-shape particles. CM-II-sPLA 2 inhibited HIV infection with an IC 50 of 5.4 ng/ml. This result is consistent with a previous observation that sPLA 2 obtained from bee and snake venoms inhibited HIV entry into host cells without disrupting the HIV particles 19 . We also tested Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which is a member of family Coronaviridae that is known to bud through the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) 31 . The ERGIC constitutes part of the ER-NE-cis-Golgi territory and therefore is considered to have similar characteristics with the ER. Rather unexpectedly, we found that CM-II-sPLA 2 exerted only marginal, if any, virucidal activity against MERS-CoV, with an IC 50 of 10,000 ng/ml. We assume that the exceptionally large petal-shaped spikes that project approximately 20 nm from the virion envelope, which is a characteristic feature of members of Coronaviridae 31 , interfere with the access of CM-II-sPLA 2 to the envelope lipid bilayer. Alternatively, a dose-dependent inhibition pattern (see panel (d) in Supplementary Fig. S1 ) may imply the possibility that there are two groups of MERS-CoV particles: one that is sensitive to 100 ng/ml of CM-II-sPLA 2 and another that is resistant to 10,000 ng/ ml of CM-II-sPLA 2 . The latter group may represent viral particles that have budded through the PM, as reported previously 32 . Further studies are needed to elucidate the issue.",

We examined viral protein synthesis and RNA replication in the infected cells under the same experimental conditions. The results demonstrated that whereas pretreatment of the virus with CM-II-sPLA 2 at a dose as low as 1.0 ng/ml almost completely inhibited HCV and DENV infection, post-entry treatment of virus-infected cells with CM-II-sPLA 2 even at the 1,000 ng/ml dose did not inhibit viral protein synthesis (Fig. 1a ) or RNA replication (Fig. 1b) .

For example, viruses budding through the ER (HCV and bovine viral diarrhea virus [BVDV]) were reported to contain more phosphatidylcholine and less phosphatidylserine than viruses 7 . This difference is mainly a reflection of the intrinsic chemical differences between the ER and PM [1] [2] [3] 8, 9 . Additionally, the biophysical thickness and sturdiness differ between the ER and the PM, with the former being thin and less sturdy with lipid packing defects in the lipid bilayers and the latter being thick and sturdier with tight lipid packaging 3, 8, 9 . Moreover, the envelope proteins of viruses belonging to the family Flaviviridae lie flat across the surface of the lipid bilayer of the virion, which allows sPLA 2 to access to lipid bilayers more easily than the lipid bilayers of other enveloped viruses with protruding envelope proteins. These physicochemical and structural differences in lipid bilayers and whole envelopes would account for the specificity of the virucidal activity of CM-II-sPLA 2 against different viruses.

A CM-II-sPLA 2 mutant(s) that has a weaker or no binding affinity for the N-type receptor but retains potent virucidal activity would be a good candidate for development of a novel antiviral drug.",

Manoalide was purchased from Abcam. 21 , SeV (Fushimi strain) 48 , VSNJV 46 , HSV-1 (CHR3 strain) 49 , EMCV (DK-27 strain) 46 , CV-B3 (Nancy strain) 50 , HIV-1 (NLCSFV3 strain) 51 and MERS-CoV (EMC2012 strain) 52 were described previously. HCV, DENV, JEV, SINV, VSNJV, HSV-1, EMCV and CV-B3 were prepared in Huh7it-1 cells 53 . FLUAV, HIV-1 and MERS-CoV were prepared in MDCK, HEK293T and Vero cells, respectively. SeV was prepared in embryonated eggs. The infectivity of all viruses except HIV-1 and MERS-CoV was determined on Huh7it-1 cells. Plaque assays were performed for SINV, VSNJV and EMCV by cultivating the virus-inoculated cells for 2 to 4 days under overlay medium containing 1% methylcellulose as described previously 46 and the viral titres were expressed as PFU/ml. For the remaining viruses except HIV-1, infectivity was determined by a FA method using specific antibodies against the respective viruses, and viral titres were expressed as CIU/ml as described previously, 21, [42] [43] [44] [45] 48 . Briefly, viral samples were serially diluted 10-fold in complete medium and inoculated onto Huh7it-1 cells seeded on glass coverslips in a 24-well plate. After virus adsorption for 1 h, the cells were washed with medium to remove residual virus and cultured for 24 h. The virus-infected cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min and permeabilised with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. After washing three times with PBS, the cells were incubated with a virus-specific primary antibody for 1 h, followed by incubation with FITC-conjugated respective secondary antibodies for 1 h. Then, the cells were observed under a fluorescence microscope. HIV-1 infectivity was determined by the TZM-bl assay using HIV-1 receptor-expressing HeLa cells, and the viral titres were expressed based on the \u03b2-galactosidase activity as reported previously 54 . MERS-CoV infectivity was determined by a FA method using a specific antibody 55 on Vero cells 24 h after infection and also by a TCID 50 assay on Vero cells by cultivating the virus-inoculated cells for 4 days, followed by fixing with phosphate-buffered formalin and staining with crystal violet 52 . The cells were cultivated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (for cell growth) or 2% (for maintenance culture) foetal bovine serum, non-essential amino acids, penicillin (100 IU/ml) and streptomycin (100 \u00b5g/ml) at 37 \u00b0C in a 5% CO 2 incubator.",
