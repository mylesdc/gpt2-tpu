MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play a regulatory role in viral infection and may be involved in the mammalian immune response. Here, we report a comprehensive analysis of host miRNA expression in TGEV-infected swine testis (ST) cells. Deep sequencing generated 3,704,353 and 2,763,665 reads from uninfected ST cells and infected ST cells, respectively. The reads were aligned to known Sus scrofa pre-miRNAs in miR-Base 19, identifying 284 annotated miRNAs. Certain miRNAs were differentially regulated during TGEV infection. 59 unique miRNAs displayed significant differentially expression between the normal and TGEV-infected ST cell samples: 15 miRNAs were significantly upregulated and 44 were significantly down-regulated. Stem-loop RT-PCR was carried out to determine the expression levels of specific miRNAs in the two samples, and the results were consistent with those of sequencing. Gene ontology enrichment analysis of host target genes demonstrated that the differentially expressed miRNAs are involved in regulatory networks, including cellular process, metabolic process, immune system process. This is the first report of the identification of ST cell miRNAs and the comprehensive analysis of the miRNA regulatory mechanism during TGEV infection, which revealed the miRNA molecular regulatory mechanisms for the viral infection, expression of viral genes and the expression of immune-related genes. The results presented here will aid research on the prevention and treatment of viral diseases.",

To predict the putative TGEV targets for the differentially expressed miRNAs, the miRNA target gene database miRGen 3.0 was used with stringent criteria. The results showed that some of the differentially expressed miRNAs directly targeted the 3' UTR or 5' UTR of the TGEV genome: ssc-miR-28-3p, ssc-miR-126-5p and ssc-miR-30b-5p target the 3' UTR (28297 bp-28571 bp) and ssc-miR-2411 and chrX-16275 target the 5' UTR (1 bp-303 bp) (Fig. 5 ). This study also found a series of miRNAs that target host-encoded pre-miRNAs; for example, ssc-miR-9, ssc-miR-19a, ssc-miR-142-5p, ssc-miR-134 and ssc-miR-20c-5p all target ssc-mir-21. GO annotation was performed for the target genes of five designated differentially expressed miRNAs (miR-146b, miR-155-5p, miR-195, miR-124a and miR-1306-5p). The results showed that the differential expressed miRNAs and their target genes constituted a complex regulatory network: multiple miRNAs were linked through their common target genes. This complex regulatory network could regulate the expression of multiple genes through one miRNA, but could also regulate the expression of certain genes through several miRNAs in combination (S1 Fig. and S2 Fig.) . For example, the significantly differentially expressed miRNAs, miR-9, miR-9-1 and miR-9-2 all target IL12A, but the immune-related gene IL7R was individually regulated by miR-140-3p. The in-depth analysis of the miRNA regulatory mechanism in gene expression will contribute to our understanding of the complexity of eukaryote genomes and gene regulatory networks. The target genes were associated with cellular components, molecular functions and biological processes; the GO enrichment analysis revealed that the target genes were functionally enriched in immune system process, cellular process, metabolic process and others ( Fig. 6 ; S4 Table) . The Porcine MicroRNA Transcriptome Response to TGEV Infection KEGG analysis identified 143 overrepresented pathways, suggesting that these signaling pathways are regulated by the differentially expressed miRNAs during virus infection (S5 Table) .",

Currently, there are no commercial biological products for TGEV infection, and there is also no effective treatment for porcine transmissible gastroenteritis.

Known sequences of mRNA, rRNA, tRNA, snRNA, and snoRNA were also excluded.

Reads with counts < 2 were discarded when calculating the miRNA expression. To characterize the isomiR variability, any sequence that matched the miRNA precursors in the mature miRNA region \u00b14nt (no more than one mismatch) were accepted as mature miRNA isomiRs, which were then grouped according to the 5-prime (5p) or 3-prime (3p) arm of the precursor hairpin. miRDeep2 (http://www.mdcberlin.de/en/research/research_teams/systems_biology_of_gene_regulatory_elements/ projects/miRDeep/) was used to predict novel pig-encoded miRNAs.
