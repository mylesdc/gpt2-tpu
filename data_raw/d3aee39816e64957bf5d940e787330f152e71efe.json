Infection with S-INDEL strain causes less severe infection and low mortality compared with the original highly virulent US PEDV strains [7, 8] .

            "text": "Similar to the immunization strategies to control transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) infection [12] , lactogenic immunity is important to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with PEDV infection in neonatal piglets. Specifically, secretory IgA antibodies in colostrum and milk play a critical role in conferring protective immunity against enteric viral infections in suckling piglets [13] . However, once lactogenic immunity is curtailed post-weaning, piglets become susceptible to PEDV. Thus active immunization is essential to reduce economic losses associated with PEDV infection in weaned piglets. Vaccination against PEDV was extensively implemented in South Korea [14] and China [15] , but with little success after 2010. A lower effectiveness of the vaccines may be associated with the emergence of new variants of PEDV [15] . Therefore effective PEDV vaccines against the emerging PEDV strains are urgently needed, but not yet available. Recently, we reported the mild virulence and partial cross-protection of a US S-INDEL PEDV Iowa106 strain against the original US PEDV PC21A strain in nursing pigs [8] . In this study, systemic and local humoral immune responses were assessed after infection of piglets with an S-INDEL strain (Iowa106) and challenge with the original US PEDV strain PC21A.",

            "text": "All experiments were conducted in accordance with guidelines approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the Ohio State University. Virus inocula of the original US PEDV PC21A (GenBank accession no. KR078299) and S-INDEL PEDV Iowa106 (GenBank accession no. KJ645695) were prepared as described previously [8] . These two PEDV variants share 99% nucleotide identity at the genomic level. Six large white \u00d7 Duroc crossbred pregnant animals were purchased from a specific pathogen free swine herd of The Ohio State University. The experimental design was described in detail in our earlier report [8] and is summarized in Figure 1A . Pig litters were randomly assigned to the following groups: (1) inoculated with S-INDEL Iowa106 and challenged with original US PEDV PC21A (four litters, n = 36); (2) inoculated with original US PEDV PC21A and challenged with the homologous strain (one litter, n = 11); and (3) mock inoculated and challenged with original US PEDV PC21A (one litter, n = 7). Piglets were inoculated with the respective virus inoculum at 3-4 days of age and a subset of pigs [S-INDEL (n = 8), original US PC21A (n = 3), control, (n = 1)] were euthanized at 2-3 weeks post inoculation. The remaining piglets were challenged with US PEDV strain PC21A at 20-29 days post-inoculation (dpi). Rectal swabs were collected to assess the severity of diarrhea and fecal virus shedding. Fecal consistency scores 0, 1, 2 and 3 correspond to normal, pasty, semi-liquid, and liquid feces, respectively, with scores of \u2265 2 corresponding to diarrhea. Virus RNA shedding was titrated by TaqMan realtime reverse transcription-PCR (RT-qPCR) as described previously [5, 8] . Serum samples were collected weekly from piglets and sows to assess PEDV specific antibody responses. Milk samples were also collected weekly from sows and whey was prepared from milk following protocols described earlier [19] to remove components (fat globules, casein micelles, and cells) that are known to interfere with immunological assays to determine virus specific antibody responses. All remaining piglets [S-INDEL (n = 16), original US PC21A (n = 4), control, (n = 5)] were euthanized at 7 days post-challenge (dpc) and ileal samples were collected to isolate mononuclear cells (MNCs) for enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assays (see below) [16] . ELISA was developed for the detection of PEDV specific IgA antibodies. Hyperimmune anti-serum to PEDV used in the ELISA was produced in guinea pigs using repeated immunizations in a standard protocol approved by the IACUC at The Ohio State University. The virus used for immunization of guinea pigs and for ELISA was the tissue culture-adapted original US PEDV strain PC22A (GenBank Accession No. KM392224), which was isolated from the same PEDV outbreak as the PC21A strain [5] . The ELISA for the IgA antibody was adapted from previous standardized protocols [17, 18] with slight modifications. Nunc Maxisorp \u00ae 96-well plates (Nunc-Immuno, Denmark) were coated with the guinea pig hyperimmune anti-serum against PEDV in coating buffer (bicarbonate/carbonate buffer, pH 9.6) at 37 \u00b0C for 2 h. The plates were washed with phosphate buffered saline-Tween (0.05%) (PBS-T) and blocked with 4% skim milk (Great Value \u2122 instant dry milk) diluted in PBS-T overnight at 4 \u00b0C. After washing, virus/mock (PEDV-infected Vero cell supernatants/mock-infected Vero cell supernatants prepared as described previously [5] ) were added to the wells and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 2 h. The plates were washed with PBS-T and 4-fold sample dilutions were added to wells. The samples were diluted in 2% skim milk in PBS-T. After incubating at 37 \u00b0C for 1.5 h, the plates were washed 5 times with PBS-T. Horse radish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-pig IgA (AbD Serotec, Raleigh, NC, USA) was added and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h. The plates were washed 5 times and substrate 2,2\u2032-azinobis [3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid]diammonium salt) (ABTS) substrate (KPL, Baltimore, MD, USA) was added. The plates were read at 405 nm after 10 min-incubation at room temperature in the dark. The cut off value was determined as the average of the absorbance of the positive capture of the negative samples + 3 times of the standard deviation. The sensitivity and specificity of the ELISA was calculated based on virus neutralizing (VN) antibody titers as gold standard as 100 and 96.6%, respectively.",

Thus, studying mucosal immunity, such as intestinal antibodies and ASC responses to PEDV strains reveals important information about protective immunity against PEDV. Similar to other enteric viral infections such as TGE, porcine respiratory coronavirus [22] and rotavirus [23] , in this study both of the PEDV strains also induced predominantly IgA ASC responses in the intestine. Further, single exposure of nursing piglets to the original US PEDV strain or S-INDEL Iowa106 strains resulted in induction of intestinal virus specific IgA ASCs in piglets. Previous studies showed that the S protein of PEDV plays an important role in eliciting protective immunity [24, 25] . Results of this study indicated that mutations in the S protein of S-INDEL Iowa106 strain were associated with reduced systemic and mucosal antibody responses in comparison with responses to the original US PEDV strain. Specifically, ileal virus specific IgA ASCs were significantly lower in the S-INDEL Iowa106inoculated piglets compared with the original US PEDVinoculated piglets pre-challenge. However, the original US PEDV and S-INDEL strains induced similar levels of virus specific IgG and IgM ASCs responses in the ileum.",

Further, the S-INDEL Iowa106 induced IgA ASC responses coincided with the partial protection against original US PEDV challenge, as indicated by the significant reduction in virus RNA shedding titers in S-INDELinoculated piglets compared with mock-inoculated piglets. These in vivo results also confirmed our previous in vitro findings in which antisera against S-INDEL Iowa106 neutralized the original US PEDV strain [26] . Similar to our results, sows that were contact exposed to the S-INDEL variant PEDV conferred partial protection to their piglets post challenge with the original US PEDV strain [27] .",

            "text": "The milder S-INDEL Iowa106 infection might be a potential reason for a significant reduction in ileal IgA ASC responses in the S-INDEL Iowa106-inoculated piglets compared with the original US PEDV PC21A-inoculated piglets at 14-20 dpi. Further, the original US PEDV PC21A-inoculated, but not the S-INDEL-inoculated piglets were completely protected against diarrhea post-challenge. This might be due to the lower level of intestinal IgA ASCs responses in the S-INDEL Iowa106inoculated piglets which might be a possible reason for the failure to induce complete protection against diarrhea post-challenge (1-7 dpc). The specific reason for lower virus-specific antibody responses in the S-INDEL-inoculated compared with the original US PEDV-inoculated piglets is unknown. We speculate that differences in replication kinetics between the PEDV strains might have caused the lower antibody responses in the S-INDEL-inoculated piglets [8] . Specifically, we observed restricted viral infection as indicated by lower percentage of virus infected enterocytes in S-INDEL Iowa106-inoculated piglets compared with original US PEDV PC21A piglets at various post-inoculation time points by immunochemistry staining [8] . Further 3 of the 4 litters of the S-INDEL-inoculated piglets had shorter duration of diarrhea compared with the original US PEDV-inoculated piglets (Table 1) . These factors likely have an impact on induction of virus specific antibody responses both mucosally and systemically. Our findings are further supported by an earlier study [28] in which inoculation of virulent PEDV induced complete protection but exposure of piglets to an attenuated strain of PEDV elicited only partial protection against challenge. The authors also hypothesized that differences in viral antigen levels in the intestine between the virulent and attenuated PEDV viruses might have caused differences in induction of protective immunity in piglets [28] . However it should be determined whether a booster dose of S-INDEL Iowa106 induces more complete protection against diarrhea. This idea is supported by our observation that virus specific antibody responses reached comparable levels in both S-INDEL Iowa106 and original US PEDV-inoculated piglets post-challenge (Figures 1, 2) . Additionally, attenuated TGEV induced lower levels of intestinal virus specific IgA ASCs compared with virulent TGEV in an earlier study [29] . Thus, differences in virus replication kinetics between the S-INDEL Iowa106 and the original US PEDV PC21A strain might be a reason for lower induction of virus specific IgA ASCs in ileum. Infection of piglets with the selected PEDV strains also induced virus specific IgA antibody responses in sows through contact exposure followed by infection and virus RNA shedding. Further, induction of virus neutralizing antibody titers in milk whey of the sows also showed that S-INDEL Iowa106 can also induce lactogenic antibodies. Among the sows, milk whey virus neutralization antibody titers at 21 dpi/0 dpc were lower in the S-INDEL Iowa106 sows compared with the original US PEDV contact exposed sow. Thus, we speculate that differences in milk whey virus neutralizing antibody titers might also potentially cause differences in protective efficacy between the S-INDEL Iowa106 and original US PEDVinoculated groups.",
