In HCoV-229E, its receptor binding domain (RBD) shows extensive sequence variation but how S-protein function is maintained is not understood. Reported are the X-ray crystal structures of Class III-V RBDs in complex with human aminopeptidase N (hAPN), as well as the electron cryomicroscopy structure of the 229E S-protein. The structures show that common core interactions define the specificity for hAPN and that the peripheral RBD sequence variation is accommodated by loop plasticity. The results provide insight into immune evasion and the crossspecies transmission of 229E and related coronaviruses. We also find that the 229E S-protein can expose a portion of its helical core to solvent. This is undoubtedly facilitated by hydrophilic subunit interfaces that we show are conserved among coronaviruses. These interfaces likely play a role in the S-protein conformational changes associated with membrane fusion.",

They share a common ancestor thought to have originated in bats (Woo et al., 2012) and several genera that use a wide range of protein and carbohydrate receptors have evolved (Forni et al., 2017; Peck et al., 2015) . Four coronaviruses, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1, circulate in the human population where they are responsible for approximately one-third of the common cold (Gaunt et al., 2010; Lim et al., 2016) . HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are closely related alphacoronaviruses that use different host proteins as receptors (Yeager et al., 1992; Hofmann et al., 2005) , while HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 are betacoronaviruses that both use 9-O-acetylsialic acids as receptor (Vlasak et al., 1988; Hulswit et al., 2019) . HCoV-229E-like coronaviruses have recently been identified in bats (Corman et al., 2015) , camels (Sabir et al., 2016; Corman et al., 2016) and alpacas (Crossley et al., 2012) , an indication that transmission from bats to humans may have involved an intermediate host.",

Although these viruses might bind their host APNs in a structurally conserved fashion, it should be noted that the porcine alphacoronavirus, PRCoV, binds to a site on porcine APN that differs from the site at which HCoV-229E binds to hAPN (Reguera et al., 2012; Wong et al., 2017) . Moreover, the more closely related human alphacoronavirus, HCoV-NL63, uses angiotensin converting enzyme 2 as receptor (Hofmann et al., 2005) . These observations suggest the existence of mechanisms for acquiring new receptor interactions, whether conserved or non-conserved, an important step in cross-species transmission. The possibility that camels were involved in the transmission of HCoV-229E to humans is interesting given that the highly virulent MERS-CoV is directly transmitted to humans from dromedaries in many cases (Paden et al., 2018) .",

            "text": "The coronavirus S-protein is responsible for both host receptor binding and fusion of the viral and host cell membranes (Li, 2016) . Its ectodomain is composed of the N-terminal S1 region that harbors the receptor binding domain (RBD) and the C-terminal S2 region that mediates membrane fusion. The S-protein is a trimer in both the pre-fusion and post-fusion conformations and cryo-EM analysis has provided structures for both conformations (Kirchdoerfer et al., 2016; Walls et al., 2016a; Kirchdoerfer et al., 2018; Walls et al., 2016b; Walls et al., 2017; Gui et al., 2017; Yuan et al., 2017; Song et al., 2018; Shang et al., 2018a; Shang et al., 2018b; Tortorici et al., 2019) . Notably, the RBD has been found to access two different conformations in the pre-fusion form of some coronavirus S-proteins (Kirchdoerfer et al., 2018; Gui et al., 2017; Yuan et al., 2017; Song et al., 2018) . In the down conformation, the receptor binding site is blocked, and it has been suggested that this may serve to protect it from immune recognition (Walls et al., 2016a; Gui et al., 2017) . In the up conformation, it is exposed for receptor binding and data exist to suggest that the RBD up conformation may promote conversion to the post-fusion form . The post-fusion form of the coronavirus S-protein is characterized by a 6-helix bundle formed by the inner HR1 triple-helical coiled-coil around which the HR2 helices are packed (Xu et al., 2004; Yan et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2018) . The coronavirus S2 subunit is large and the structural changes that accompany conversion to the post-fusion conformation are extensive (Walls et al., 2017) . Indeed, the HR1 triple-helical coiled-coil is formed entirely on conversion to the post-fusion form, and the HR2 helices, which form a triple-helical coiled-coil in the pre-fusion conformation, must dissociate before participating in 6-helix bundle formation. The S-protein structural features that enable these dramatic conformational changes are not yet fully described.",

The structure showed that three extended RBD loops are solely responsible for receptor binding. Moreover, we showed that these loops are the most variable region in the entire viral genome. Indeed, a phylogenetic analysis defined six RBD classes whose viruses have successively replaced each other in the human population over the past 50 years. The RBD classes differ in their ability to be bound by a receptor binding loop-specific neutralizing antibody, and in their affinity for hAPN, two determinants of viral fitness. Although immune evasion provides an explanation for the emergence of these RBD classes, how extensive loop variation is accommodated while maintaining receptor binding remained an unanswered question. Loop variation is also expected to facilitate the acquisition of new receptor interactions and thereby cross-species transmission, and how this might work in structural terms is also not well understood.",

We find that an invariant set of core interactions defines the interaction with hAPN across all the RBD classes characterized. Receptor binding loop variation is concentrated in regions peripheral to the core and it is accommodated by the inherent plasticity of extended loops. The results have provided a model for how HCoV-229E could evade receptor loop-binding neutralizing antibodies while maintaining receptor binding. They also support the suggestion that the 229E-like bat, camel and alpaca coronaviruses use APN as receptor and bind it essentially as shown for our RBD-hAPN complexes. The structures also show that receptor binding loop variation is unlikely to modulate the RBD up/down equilibrium or the stability of the pre-fusion trimer. As shown by the cryo-EM structure, the 229E S-protein can access a conformation that exposes a significant portion of its helical core region to solvent. The ability to do so likely stems from the fact that the interfaces between monomers in this region are hydrophilic, a property which we now show is shared by all the coronavirus S-proteins whose structures have been determined. These hydrophilic interfaces likely play a role in the conversion of the coronavirus S-protein from its pre-fusion to its post-fusion conformation during the process of membrane fusion.",

There are six hydrogen bonds between Loop 1 and hAPN that are common to all the complexes. Of these, four involve backbone atoms of Loop 1 and five involve backbone atoms of hAPN. Indeed, the 287-291 segment of hAPN is a surface-exposed b-strand and these hydrogen bonds satisfy all its exposed backbone amide and carbonyl groups. These common hydrogen bonds also involve the side chains of Loop 1 residue Asn 319 and hAPN residue Asp 288. The importance of these core interactions is underscored by the fact that Gly 315, Cys 317, Asn 319, and Cys 320 correspond to four of the six residues that are absolutely conserved among the receptor binding loops of all 229E isolates sequenced (Wong et al., 2017) (Figure 1d , Figure 1 -figure supplement 1). Gly 315 is in the a L region of j/y-space, a backbone conformation only easily accessed by glycine. Cys 317 and Cys 320 form a disulfide bond which constrains the loop conformation required to satisfy the observed hydrogen bonds. The side chain of Asn 319 is buried in the complex interface where it donates and accepts hydrogen bonds from the backbone atoms of hAPN residue Glu 291. The stacking interaction between the backbone of residue Cys 317 and the side chain of hAPN residue Tyr 289 also plays an important role. Comparison of these four structures establishes that these core interactions underpin 229E's specificity for hAPN. Gly 313 is also absolutely conserved among all 229E isolates sequenced and its backbone conformation varies among the complexes. It seems that the flexibility afforded by glycine is important in maintaining the core Loop 1 interactions with hAPN in the context of the sequence variation that occurs in the three receptor binding loops outside of the core region.",

In Loop 2, they all have a deletion of two amino acids that allows Arg 357 of Loop 2, the last of the absolutely conserved residues, to form a stronger salt bridge with Asp 315 of hAPN than what was observed in the Class I complex. In Loop 3, all three classes have acquired two leucine residues not found in the Class I sequence: Trp 404 and Ser 407 of Class I are replaced by Leu 402 and Leu 405 in Classes III, IV and V. The sidechains of these leucine residues occupy the volume filled by the tryptophan sidechain in the Class I complex. As a result, Leu 405 makes the apolar contacts with Leu 318 of hAPN, a role played by Trp 404 in the Class I complex. The sequence changes in Loops 2 and 3 lead to a small re-orientation of the main body of the RBD in the Class III, IV and V complexes. This in turn leads to a compensatory twist in Loop 1 which preserves the core Loop 1-hAPN interaction. As a result of the twist, Arg 316 emerges from a different side of Loop 1 where it forms a salt bridge with Asp 288 of hAPN in the Class III, IV and V complexes, which is not possible in the Class I complex.",

In Class V, the motif is GPG and by constraining the Loop 1 conformation, the proline residue (Pro 314) likely leads to a stabilization of the interactions with hAPN. In Classes IV and V, the conversion of Gln 311 to Arg 311 permits a weak salt bridge interaction with Glu 291 that is not possible in Classes I or III.

            "text": "To provide further insight into how the 229E S-protein mediates receptor binding and ultimately membrane fusion, we determined the structure of its ectodomain by single-particle cryo-EM analysis. To facilitate expression and structure determination, the ectodomain (residues 17-1113) was Figure 1 . Comparison of the RBD-hAPN complexes. In all panels, the Class I RBD is colored magenta, the Class III, IV and V RBDs are colored cyan, and hAPN is colored gray. (a) Center: superimposition of the Class I, III IV and V RBD-hAPN complexes. Surrounding: the Class I and Class III RBDs are shown; the Class III RBD provides an example of the major differences observed between the Class III, IV and V RBDs relative to Class I. Loop 1, a twist in the loop allows Arg316 to interact with Asp288. Loop 2, a 2-aa deletion reorients Arg357, enabling a better interaction with Asp315. Loop 3, Leu402 and Leu405 replace Trp404, with Leu405 maintaining the apolar contact with Leu318. (b) The 315-320 segment of Loop 1shows a high degree of structural conservation among the four complexes. (c) Six hydrogen bonds (blue dotted lines, marked 1-6) are conserved among the four complexes and they all involve Loop 1 residues 315-320. Five of them (hydrogen bonds 1-5 in the figure) involve the five exposed backbone amide/carbonyl groups of hAPN residues 287-291; the sixth is formed with the sidechain of hAPN residue Asp 288. For clarity, only sidechains that participate in hydrogen bonds are shown. (d) Receptor binding loop sequence alignment. Differences relative to Class I are colored red. The six residues conserved among all HCoV-229E viruses sequenced are enclosed in blue boxes. The online version of this article includes the following figure supplement(s) for figure 1: produced as a fusion protein with a C-terminal fibritin foldon trimerization motif (Tao et al., 1997) . In addition, a dual-proline mutation (Thr871Pro/Ile872Pro) was introduced to stabilize the pre-fusion form as previously described (Pallesen et al., 2017) . Negative stain EM analysis showed that the 229E S-protein consistently appeared as uniformly sized, cone-shaped particles in the micrographs ( Figure 2a) . A flexible tail that is presumed to be a combination of the HR2 region and the trimerization motif is also visible in the micrographs. The 2D class averages from these micrographs further showed that the cones have domain-sized bulges and an opening at their bottom end ( Figure 2c ). These features are also observed in the cryo-EM structure and they result from an opening of the monomers in the helical core and connector region of the trimer, as discussed below. For cryo-EM structure determination, freshly prepared 229E ectodomain was frozen on EM grids and analyzed with single-particle techniques ( Figure 2b ). During data processing, extensive 2D and 3D classification were performed to remove a large number of small particles that did not represent the intact complex. The final dataset included~71,000 particle images, most of them showing sideviews of the trimeric S-protein (Figure 2d, Figure 2 -figure supplement 1). Since refinement with C1 symmetry did not reveal particle classes lacking three-fold symmetry, C3 symmetry was imposed in the final cryo-EM map and during 3D refinement. This led to a final map with a resolution of 3.1 \u00c5 ( The cryo-EM images also produced 2D class averages corresponding to particles shaped like equilateral triangles with~110 \u00c5 edges ( Figure 2e ). These class averages have little density in the center of the triangle and appear to correspond to the S1 region of the trimer alone ( Figure 2f ).",

            "text": "The overall structure of the 229E S-protein trimer is similar to that of the closely related NL63 S-protein trimer (Walls et al., 2016a) . The three S1 subunits form a cap over the three S2 subunits with each S1 subunit non-covalently associating with the S2 subunit of an adjacent monomer ( Figure 4) . The S1 subunit of each monomer is composed of four b-rich domains: A, B, C and D (Figure 4c ,d,e). The S2 subunit is largely alpha-helical and the three longest helices, helix 629-652 (UH), helix 821- 852 (HR1 821-852 ) and helix 873-918 (the central helix, CH), form the helical core region of each S2 subunit (Figure 4f,g) . The HR1 821-852 helix is only a portion of the HR1 segment that forms the central 3-helix coiled-coil of the post-fusion 6-helix bundle Zhang et al., 2018) . The remainder of HR1 is made up of two shorter helices and two non-helical segments (Figure 4g) . The junction between the HR1 helices and the start of CH is a sharp turn that reverses the chain direction leading to the anti-parallel arrangement of the HR1 821-852 and CH helices. The importance of the HR1-CH junction stems from the fact that in the post-fusion form it is restructured to form a connection between the HR1 and CH helices which now form a continuous helix (Figure 5b,c) . It is at this site that the Thr871Pro/Ile872Pro mutations have been introduced to stabilize the pre-fusion conformation. The~80 residue (residues 959-1033) b-rich connector domain (CD) could be identified in the cryo-EM map, but its density was too weak to be traced with confidence ( Figure 3c ). In this region, a homology model based on the CD domain of the NL63 S-protein was positioned in the density (Figure 4f ,g, Figure 4 -figure supplement 1). This extended our model to 24 residues before the start of the HR2 region.",

Eighteen of these are located in the well-resolved S1 and S2 regions (38-565 and 585-953) and clear N-glycan density is observed for 17 of them. Although not observed in our cryo-EM structure, the~60 residue HR2 region possesses 5 N-glycosylation sequons. As such, it represents the most highly glycosylated region of the entire S-protein, a feature that may be important in the transition from the pre-fusion to the post-fusion conformation. The HR2 region forms a triple helical coiled-coil in the pre-fusion form (Hakansson-McReynolds et al., 2006) and its helices must dissociate to participate in 6-helix bundle formation. Exposure of the core apolar residues of the HR2 coiled-coil to solvent would lead to a decrease in solubility and the potential for non-specific interactions and this might be offset by the bulky and hydrophilic N-glycans. The high degree of glycosylation shown by the coronaviruses is thought to be important in shielding them from immune recognition (Walls et al., 2016a) . Protecting the pre-fusion HR2 triple helical coiled-coil from immune recognition is another possible explanation for the high degree of glycosylation observed in this region.",

This N-glycan is the most well-ordered in the entire structure and density for it beyond the trimannose core is observed. The close approach of the three receptor binding loops of domain B (the RBD) to domain A closes the ring (Figure 4d ). As discussed above, Loop 1 forms a conserved set of core interactions with hAPN and in all the RBD-hAPN complexes it is well ordered. However, in the S-protein trimer (which contains a Class I RBD), Loop 1 is flexible, there is little density for the tip of it, and it does not make specific contacts with domain A. Loops 2 and 3 are shorter and although observed in the cryo-EM structure they too do not make specific interactions with domain A. An overlay of the Class III, Class IV and Class V RBDs, from the hAPN complexes reported here, suggests that their receptor binding loops would also not strongly interact with domain A. These observations suggest that the variable receptor-binding loops of 229E are simply accommodated in the gap between them and domain A. That the domain A surface near the loops is relatively well conserved among 229E isolates supports this suggestion as compensatory sequence changes in domain A might be expected if specific interactions with residues of the constantly evolving receptor binding loops were important.",

Receptor binding is only possible when domain B (the 229E RBD) is in the up conformation as the receptor binding end of domain B is blocked in the down conformation. In our cryo-EM structure, domain B is in the down conformation in all three monomers of the trimer and we see no evidence of molecules with domain B in the up conformation. Nevertheless, the structure provides a model for how the up/down conformational conversion is mediated in 229E. As shown in Figure 4h , the N-and C-termini of domain B are close in space and the polypeptide segments that lead into (V295-Y296-H297) and out of (V435-S436-S437) it, form a two-stranded hinge between domain B and domain C. Rotating domain B into the up conformation leads to an opening of the S1 ring and exposure of the receptor binding loops to solvent. In the down conformation, there are significant interactions between domains B and domain C of the same monomer and between domain B and the top of the S2 subunit of an adjacent monomer. The latter involves contacts with the HR1-CH junction, the connection between the HR1 and CH helices that is dramatically restructured on conversion to the post-fusion 6-helix bundle. 5SZS.

The cap is triangular in shape with relatively little density along the three-fold rotation axis. The three A domains sit at the vertices of the triangle and the B domains are positioned closer to the three-fold axis. Apolar interactions between domain A of one S1 subunit and domain C of another largely account for the inter-subunit contacts (~700 \u00c5 2 ) within the cap (Figure 6a) . The presence of 2D class averages with dimensions similar to that of the cap alone suggests that these interactions can maintain cap assembly even in the absence of interactions involving the S2 subunit. Viewed down the 3fold axis, domains C and D of the S1 subunit sit below domains A and B where they interact with the underlying S2 subunits. The three core helices (UH, HR1 821-852 , and CH) of each S2 subunit of the trimer are arranged around the 3-fold axis with CH positioned most closely to it. The interactions between the core helices of each S2 subunit make up the bulk of the trimer interface in this region. Remarkably, we find that few of the interface residues are apolar in nature. There is a small apolar patch around Val 891, but the remainder of the trimer interface in this region is composed of polar residues, many of them charged (Figure 7a,b, Figure 7-figure supplement 1) .

In contrast, the interactions between the S1 cap and the S2 subunits of the trimer include a relatively large apolar component capable of mediating significant stabilizing forces. Specifically, the C and D domains of each S1 subunit of the cap clamp over an apolar knob (residues 709-737) that protrudes from the helical core region of each S2 subunit. As a result, 1260 \u00c5 2 of apolar surface area (of a total of~2300 \u00c5 2 ) is buried for each pair of S1 and S2 subunits (Figure 6b,c,d) . As discussed above, domain B in the down conformation makes an additional contact with the S2 subunit, in this case with the critically important HR1-CH junction. Taken together, these observations suggest that the S1 cap plays a major role in the stabilization of the pre-fusion trimer. By clamping together the top end of the S2 subunits it prevents the conformational changes required for conversion to the post-fusion form. The connector domain contributes to the trimer interface in other coronavirus S-proteins and its interactions may also stabilize the pre-fusion trimer. However, as discussed below, the CD domain does not make trimer-stabilizing contacts in our structure, further evidence of the important role played by the cap in the stabilization of the pre-fusion trimer.",

In the pre-and post-fusion structures of the MHV S-protein (PDB: 3JCL, 6B3O) (Walls et al., 2016b; Walls et al., 2017) , the CH helix, the helix closest to the trimer axis, undergoes a 60\u02darotation along its long axis on conversion to the post-fusion form (Video 3). The rotation restructures the CH trimer interface and the transition is presumably facilitated by the hydrophilic interface as only a single apolar contact need be broken and formed in the process. Even larger conformational changes are associated with the formation of the post-fusion triple-helical HR1 coiled-coil (Figure 5b,c) .

            "text": "Sequence analysis has shown that the three receptor binding loops of HCoV-229E are the most variable region in the entire viral genome. Indeed, loop variation has led to the emergence of six RBD classes whose viruses have successively replaced each other in the human population over the past 50 years (Wong et al., 2017) . As we now show, the Class I, III, IV and V RBD-hAPN complexes show that there is a set of conserved core interactions, mediated by Loop 1 of the RBD, that defines the specificity of 229E for hAPN. The loop variation among classes is concentrated in regions peripheral to the core and loop plasticity ensures that they are accommodated while the core interactions are preserved. Immune evasion is a likely explanation for the emergence of these viral classes, and the structures provide insight into how mutational changes outside of the core region could abrogate loop-binding neutralizing antibodies while receptor binding is maintained. The Class III, IV and V RBDs all bind hAPN with higher affinity than that of the tissue culture adapted Class I RBD (16-fold for Class V) (Wong et al., 2017) . Given that the core interactions are conserved, the observed affinity changes undoubtedly arise from the sequence variation found in the periphery. Receptor binding affinity is a key determinant of viral fitness (Hensley et al., 2009; de Vries et al., 2013; Lynch et al., 2015; Rockx et al., 2010) and the optimization of it may be required following antibody escape or the acquisition of a new receptor during cross-species transmission. The structures also show how mutational changes in the periphery can lead to a modulation of receptor binding affinity while receptor specificity is maintained. The nature of the interaction between the various RBDs and hAPN also provides insight into how HCoV-229E and the related bat, camel and alpaca 229E-like viruses were transmitted to their respective hosts. As the structures show, the common hydrogen bonds between the RBDs and hAPN all involve backbone atoms of hAPN. Moreover, the key 287-291 segment on hAPN is a surface exposed b-strand whose exposed backbone amide and carbonyl groups are satisfied by the hydrogen bonds with the RBD. The use of backbone atoms in this way reduces the dependence on a given sequence and increases the chances that a virus might productively bind the homologous receptor of another species in essentially the same way. The five Loop 1 residues that are absolutely conserved among all HCoV-229E viruses are also identical in the bat, camel and alpaca viruses (Figure 1-figure supplement 1) . Taken together, it is likely that these viruses all use APN as receptor and that this has been facilitated by the Loop-1 mediated core interaction shown by our structures. During replication in the new host, loop mutations could accommodate the species-specific APN sequence differences in the peripheral regions and optimize receptor binding affinity as required. We have previously argued that the use of 'conserved' receptor interactions in this way would facilitate cross-species transmission over large evolutionary distances (Wong et al., 2017) .",

Whether they make S-protein contacts in the down conformation is an important question given the possibility that receptor binding loop variation might modulate the RBD equilibrium or the stability of the pre-fusion trimer. As shown by the HCoV-229E cryo-EM structure, the receptor binding loops of its Class I RBD closely approach domain A of the S1 subunit, but they do not interact with it strongly. The X-ray crystal structures of the Class III, IV and V RBDs in complex with hAPN provide structures for three other RBD classes, albeit in complex with hAPN. As shown by an overlay, they too do not interact significantly with domain A. In contrast, an analysis of the hinge region that connects domain B/RBD to domain C identifies two interfaces (Figure 4h) where interactions must be broken or formed in the conversion between the two RBD conformations. These interfaces are highly conserved among 229E isolates and taken together, it seems that the RBD equilibrium is a property of the pre-fusion trimer that is not likely to vary among viruses possessing different RBD classes.",

These conformational changes are not possible in the presence of the S1 cap and domain B/RBD in the down conformation likely strengthens the S1 cap interaction with the S2 subunits through its contact with the HR1-CH junction. Our analysis suggests that the S1 cap is a stable assembly and to the extent that it is, the interaction between the cap and the S2 subunits would be subject to an avidity effect and weakest with all three RBDs in the up conformation. In this way, receptor engagement and an increase in the number of RBDs in the up conformation would facilitate conversion to the post-fusion form and viral entry.",

Relative to the NL63 trimer, a significant proportion of the 229E core helices, CH, HR1 821-852 and UH, are exposed to solvent. The interfaces between the monomers of the trimer in the helical core region are hydrophilic in nature and this has presumably facilitated the exposure of these helices to solvent. As we now show, this hydrophilic character is shared among the other coronavirus S-proteins for which structures exist (Figure 7c,d, Figure 7-figure supplement 1) , an observation suggesting a conserved functional role. The coronavirus S2 subunit is large and the conformational changes on conversion to the post-fusion are more extensive than that shown by many other viral fusion proteins (Harrison, 2015; Rey and Lok, 2018) . The HR1 triple helical coiled-coil, for example, is generated entirely on conversion to the post-fusion form. This is to be contrasted with the canonical HA of influenza virus where one-half of the triple helical coiled-coiled coil is already formed in the pre-fusion conformation. It is certainly possible that in the coronaviruses, these hydrophilic interfaces facilitate the S-protein conformational changes required in the conversion from the pre-fusion to the post-fusion forms.",

The remainder of the RBDs comes from the Class I sequence. A sequence alignment of the six RBD classes can be found in Figure 1 -figure supplement 1. The cDNA sequences encoding the six RBD classes were cloned into an inducible piggyBac transposon-based stable expression vector (Li et al., 2013) . Stable cell lines were generated by co-transfecting HEK293S-GnT1(-/-) cells (ATCC Cat# CRL-3022, RRID: CVCL_A785) (Reeves et al., 2002) with each of the RBD plasmids and both a piggyBac transposase helper plasmid and an rtTA helper plasmid.

To isolate the RBD-hAPN complexes, the RBDs and hAPN were mixed in a 1.2:1 molar ratio (RBD:hAPN) and again run on the Superdex 200 column. Before setting up the crystallization experiments, the complexes were concentrated to 10 mg/mL and Endo A was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/mL to deglycosylate the RBDs in situ. The protein solutions were mixed with well solution consisting of 9% PEG 8000, 1 mM oxidized glutathione, 1 mM reduced glutathione, 5% glycerol, and 100 mM MES, pH 6.5. The crystallization experiments were carried out by hanging drop vapor diffusion. Of the five classes tested for co-crystallization with hAPN, only the Class III, IV and V RBDs yielded crystals. Crystal quality was improved by macro-seeding. Crystals were cryo-protected with well solution containing 25% glycerol before vitrification.",

A homology model based on the 3.4 \u00c5 cryo-EM structure of the HCoV-NL63 S-protein trimer (PDB id: 5SZS) (Walls et al., 2016a) was produced using the PHYRE2 server (Kelley et al., 2015) , and used as a reference during model building. Except for a few loops and the linker between S1 and S2, we were able to trace the polypeptide chain for residues 38-958. In the connector domain the homology model was docked into the map. This resulted in an atomic model of the HCoV-229E ectodomain that included most of the residues between residue 38 and residue 1033, 24 residues before the start of the HR2 region. The atomic model was refined against a half-map using Phenix.real_space_refine (Afonine et al., 2018a) and Rosetta . To improve the geometry of the atomic model, molecular dynamics-assisted model building was carried out in ChimeraX (Goddard et al., 2018) using the ISOLDE tool (Croll, 2018) . The other half-map was used for generating model statistics. The atomic model was validated using Molprobity (Williams et al., 2018) , EMRinger (Barad et al., 2015) and the comprehensive validation (cryo-EM) tool in Phenix (Afonine et al., 2018b) . The molecular graphics, animations and movies were generated using UCSF Chimera (Pettersen et al., 2004) and UCSF ChimeraX (Goddard et al., 2018) .",
