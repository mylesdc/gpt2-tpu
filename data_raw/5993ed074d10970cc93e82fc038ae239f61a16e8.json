            "text": "Macrodomains are conserved protein folds associated with ADP-ribose binding and turnover. ADPribosylation is a posttranslational modification catalyzed primarily by ARTD (aka PARP) enzymes in cells. ARTDs transfer either single or multiple ADP-ribose units to substrates, resulting in mono-or poly-ADP-ribosylation. TARG1/C6orf130 is a macrodomain protein that hydrolyzes mono-ADP-ribosylation and interacts with poly-ADP-ribose chains. Interactome analyses revealed that TARG1 binds strongly to ribosomes and proteins associated with rRNA processing and ribosomal assembly factors. TARG1 localized to transcriptionally active nucleoli, which occurred independently of ADP-ribose binding. TARG1 shuttled continuously between nucleoli and nucleoplasm. In response to DNA damage, which activates ARTD1/2 (PARP1/2) and promotes synthesis of poly-ADP-ribose chains, TARG1 re-localized to the nucleoplasm. This was dependent on the ability of TARG1 to bind to poly-ADP-ribose. These findings are consistent with the observed ability of TARG1 to competitively interact with RNA and PAR chains. We propose a nucleolar role of TARG1 in ribosome assembly or quality control that is stalled when TARG1 is re-located to sites of DNA damage.",

            "text": "Tandem-affinity purification reveals interaction of TARG1 with RNA-binding proteins. To gain insight into TARG1's cellular functions, we identified the TARG1-associated cellular proteome using a tandem affinity purification (TAP) approach 19 . HEK293 cells stably and inducibly expressing TAP-tagged TARG1 or the TAP-tag alone were generated and TAP-containing protein complexes isolated (Fig. 1a) 20 . The TAP-tag consists of Protein A fused to a Calmodulin (CaM) binding peptide (CBP) via a Tobacco Etch Virus (TEV) protease cleavage site (Fig. 1a) , allowing for sequential affinity purification of TAP-tag-containing complexes. Protein A is captured by an IgG matrix, complexes are eluted by TEV cleavage and CBP-tagged complexes are recovered by a CaM pulldown (Fig. 1a) . Co-purified proteins were analyzed by LC-MS/MS and relative enrichment of detected proteins in the TAP-TARG1 pulldown over the TAP-tag control was calculated by label-free quantitation ( Fig. 1b and c) 21, 22 . Because mechanical DNA shearing during cell lysis activates ARTD1/2 resulting in PAR formation, to which TARG1 can be recruited 9,23 , we assessed the role of PAR on the TARG1 interactome. Therefore, the experiments were performed with or without the ARTD1/2 inhibitor olaparib during cell lysis (Fig. 1a) . Experiments without inhibitor were performed in three, experiments with inhibitor in two biological replicates. The individual samples were measured in technical duplicates. Without inhibitor we identified 70 TARG1 interacting proteins with a fold enrichment \u22652 (Fig. 1b, Supplementary Table S1 , Supplementary Dataset S1). ARTD1, the only described interaction partner of TARG1 so far 9 , was highly enriched ( Fig. 1c ; Supplementary Table S1, Supplementary Dataset S1). In addition, components of protein complexes involved in base excision repair (BER; XRCC1 and LIG3), in non-homologous end joining (NHEJ; PRKDC, XRCC5 and XRCC6) and the FACT (facilitates chromatin transcription) complex subunits SSRP1 and SUPT16H were associated with TARG1. All of these factors doxycycline induction were lysed in the presence or absence of olaparib to inhibit ARTD1/2 activation during cell lysis. TAP-tag containing complexes were purified in two sequential affinity purification steps. Co-purified proteins were analyzed by LC-MS/MS and relative enrichment of TAP-TARG1 over TAP-tag control was determined by labelfree quantitation (LFQ). Upper right panel: Domain structure of TAP-TARG1 and TAP constructs. Lower right panel: Fractions of the input lysate, the IgG and the CaM pulldown were analyzed for TARG1 by Western blot using mAb 3A5 (for characterization of TARG1 antibodies see Supplementary Fig. S3 ). (b) Venn diagrams depicting the overlap between proteins associated with TARG1 in proteomics screens conducted in the absence (three biological replicates, p \u2264 0.01) or presence (two biological replicates, p \u2264 0.01) of olaparib in the lysis buffer with a fold enrichment of \u22652 (upper diagram) or \u226510 (lower diagram) over TAP control. (c) Fold enrichment of all proteins identified as TARG1 interacting proteins (p \u2264 0.01, \u22652-fold enrichment over TAP control) both in the absence and presence of olaparib. Only a fraction of grouped bars is specified with the corresponding protein names on the x-axis for clarity reasons. For details on the identified proteins see Supplementary Table S1, Supplementary Datasets S1 and S2. (d) HEK293 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding for FLAG-TARG1 wildtype (WT) or ADPr binding-deficient FLAG-TARG1-G123E (GE). Presence of SSRP1, XRCC1 and CHD1L in FLAG immunoprecipitates (IP) and whole cell lysates (WCL) was analyzed by Western blotting. (e) HEK293 cells transiently expressing FLAG-TARG1 were lysed in TAP lysis buffer \u00b110 \u00b5M olaparib. Presence of ARTD1, XRCC1, CHD1L, KU80 and TARG1 after IP of FLAG-TARG1 was analyzed by Western blotting. (f) HEK293T cells transiently expressing FLAG-TARG1 were lysed in the presence of 10 \u00b5M olaparib. Presence of ARTD1, NCL, RPL7A and USP10 after IP against FLAG-TARG1 was analyzed by Western blotting. CHD1L was detected to control for inhibition of lysis-induced PARylation.

Based on in silico mutational analyses of the ADPr binding pocket in TARG1, we mutated three residues located in the ADPr binding pocket, G43, I44 and G123, to glutamate ( Supplementary Fig. S1a -c, Supplementary Table S2 ). Mutation of G123 was previously shown to block ADPr binding 9 . Impact of the mutations on folding and ADPr binding was assessed in fluorescence-based thermal shift assays 25 . His-TARG1-G43E and -I44E were less, His-TARG1-G123E more stable than the wildtype protein ( Supplementary Fig. S1d ). While His-TARG1 was stabilized by ADPr, the mutants were not, indicative of loss of ADPr binding ( Supplementary  Fig. S1d) . Moreover, all three mutants were catalytically inactive towards auto-modified ARTD10 ( Supplementary  Fig. S1e ). Consistent with these findings and unlike the wildtype protein, TARG1-G123E did not interact with repair proteins in co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiments (Fig. 1d) .",

The +olaparib dataset contained 192 proteins with a \u22652-fold enrichment with an overlap of 32 proteins to the -olaparib dataset (Fig. 1b) . The lost proteins with olaparib included those being either substrates of or recruited by DNA damage-induced PARylation ( Fig. 1c and e) . Increasing the stringency to a threshold of \u226510 resulted in an overlap of only one protein, RFC2 (replication factor C subunit 2), in addition to TARG1 itself (Fig. 1b) . In the presence of olaparib, we identified almost all proteins of the small and large ribosomal subunits and proteins involved in ribosome biogenesis, RNA processing and translation such as nucleolin (NCL), hnRNPs and DDX proteins (Fig. 1c , Supplementary Table S1, Supplementary Dataset S2). Among the ARTD family members, association of TARG1 with ARTD1 and the catalytically inactive ARTD13 was observed. However, while ARTD1 was highly enriched in the absence of olaparib treatment (385-fold), it was only weakly interacting (2.6-fold) with TARG1 with ARTD1/2 inhibition (Fig. 1c , Supplementary Table S1, Supplementary Dataset S2). Independent co-IP experiments using FLAG-tagged TARG1 from cell lysates in the presence of olaparib confirmed binding to ARTD1, NCL, RPL7A, and USP10 (Fig. 1f) . CHD1L was not co-IPed, indicating that lysis-induced PAR formation was very low or did not occur in these experiments (Fig. 1f) . We were not able to IP endogenous TARG1 under co-IP conditions with any of our monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies despite their reactivity with endogenous TARG1 on Western blots and in high stringency IP buffers (for control Western blots see below). A possible explanation is that the epitopes of this small protein are covered by interacting factors under low stringency conditions.",

While clone 12 HeLa OARD1 \u2212/\u2212 cells proliferated as fast as wildtype cells, the proliferation rate of cells generated from clone 3 was reduced by half (Fig. 2b) . The reduction of cell proliferation observed for HeLa OARD1 \u2212/\u2212 clone 3 was not caused by the loss of TARG1, as complementation with a lentiviral vector expressing HA-TARG1 wildtype or HA-TARG1-G43E did not affect proliferation ( Fig. 2c and d) . Similarly, substantial overexpression of TARG1 or TARG1-G123E or shRNA-dependent knockdown of OARD1 in HeLa Flp-In \u2122 T-REx \u2122 cells did neither affect cell proliferation nor sensitivity to DNA damage-inducing agents ( Supplementary Figs S4 and S5 ). In summary, although it had been observed previously that TARG1 has growth promoting functions in HEK293/293T, NIH3T3, HSC58 and HSC60 cells 9,27 , our findings suggest that TARG1 does not affect cell proliferation in HeLa cells.",

Therefore, we asked whether nucleolar accumulation of TARG1 is dependent on its ability to interact with ADPr. All three ADPr binding-deficient TARG1 mutants accumulated in nucleoli in U2OS cells (Fig. 3b, Supplementary Fig. S7 ). Furthermore, treatment of U2OS cells with olaparib did not change the sub-cellular distribution of EGFP-TARG1 (see also below), together indicating that nucleolar localization of TARG1 is not dependent on nucleolar PAR. The nucleolus is involved in the cellular stress response, in line with rapid changes of the nucleolar proteome upon stress 34 . Inhibition of rRNA transcription by actinomycin D results in nucleolar disruption and release of nucleolar proteins, including ribosomal proteins, into the nucleoplasm 34 . Actinomycin D treatment, which at low concentration inhibits primarily RNA polymerase I, abrogated nucleolar accumulation of EGFP-TARG1 (Fig. 3c) . The same was observed for EGFP-TARG1-G123E, indicating that loss of nucleolar accumulation of TARG1 upon actinomycin D treatment was PARylation-independent ( Fig. 3c) . Thus, TARG1 is recruited into transcriptionally active nucleoli independent of ADPr binding. EGFP-TARG1 is rapidly exchanging between the nuclear and the nucleolar compartment. The nucleolar compartment consists of highly dynamic protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid interactions and nucleolar components typically continuously exchange with the surrounding nucleoplasm, important for quickly responding to cellular stress [35] [36] [37] [38] . Therefore, we assessed the exchange of EGFP-TARG1 between the nucleoplasm and nucleoli using fluorescence loss in photo-bleaching (FLIP) experiments in U2OS cells. Several regions of interest (ROIs) were defined, one for bleaching and one for measuring were placed in the nucleoplasm, one in a nucleolus, one in the cytoplasm, and a control ROI in a neighboring cell to account for changes during the measurements. After acquisition of five control images, one nucleoplasmic ROI was exposed to repetitive photo-bleaching. After each bleach pulse imaging scans were performed and mean EGFP intensities were determined in all ROIs. EGFP fluorescence intensities in control regions remained constant ( Fig. 4b-d) , indicating that the effect of bleaching during image acquisition between the bleach pulses was negligible. EGFP intensities in each ROI were normalized to the mean EGFP intensity in each ROI before bleaching ( Fig. 4b-d) .",

Normalized nucleolar EGFP fluorescence decreased together with nucleoplasmic EGFP fluorescence, indicating that EGFP-TARG1 exchanged rapidly between nucleoli and the nucleoplasm (Fig. 4b , upper panel). In contrast, EGFP fluorescence intensities in the cytoplasm decreased only slightly during 1 min of nuclear photo-bleaching (Fig. 4b, upper panel) . As bleaching of a nuclear region can be accompanied by bleaching of cytoplasmic EGFP fusion proteins above and below the nucleus, a reciprocal experiment was performed, in which cytoplasmic EGFP was bleached. No marked decrease in nuclear/nucleolar EGFP intensity was observed (Fig. 4d , upper panel), altogether indicating that within 1 min no substantial nucleo-cytoplasmic EGFP-TARG1 shuttling occurred. In U2OS cells expressing EGFP alone, nucleoplasmic EGFP fluorescence was depleted to \u223c19% within 60 s, which is comparable to what was observed for EGFP-TARG1 ( Fig. 4a and b, bottom panel). However, in contrast to EGFP-TARG1, a clear nucleo-cytoplasmic exchange of EGFP was observed during this time frame (Fig. 4b , bottom panel and Fig. 4d , bottom panel).

Indeed, titration of PAR into the RNA binding assay efficiently reversed the band shift induced by His-TARG1 but poorly by His-TARG1-G123E (Fig. 6g) . These data, together with the inability of ADPr to compete, are in agreement with a model, in which TARG1 binds RNA via positively charged patches on its surface but not via its ADPr binding pocket. In contrast, PAR occupies the ADPr binding pocket of TARG1 and at the same time interacts very likely with the positively charged patches on the surface of TARG1. These findings support the notion that TARG1 has a higher affinity to PAR than to RNA.",

In the absence of ARTD1/2 activation and PAR formation, the TARG1 interactome is strongly directed toward ribosomal proteins and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) that function in diverse RNA-associated cellular processes. Furthermore, we observed that TARG1 is a nuclear protein that shuttles rapidly between the nucleoplasm and nucleoli. The distribution between these two compartments is regulated by PARylation, i.e. TARG1 is mainly nucleolar in the absence of PAR, while it accumulates in the nucleoplasm in response to PAR formation. We also discovered that TARG1 interacts with RNA, which together with binding to ribosomal proteins is suggested to control its nucleolar localization (Fig. 7) .",

These screens commonly revealed that a high number of RNA processing factors are ADP-ribosylated or are PAR binding proteins 44, 45 . So far, it is unclear which of the identified proteins interact directly with TARG1. In addition to direct protein-protein binding, we assume that some of the interactions are mediated by the ability of TARG1 to associate with RNA (Fig. 6 ). This seems likely as a number of proteins were identified that are part of multi-protein and ribonucleoprotein complexes such as ribosomes. In contrast, when PARylation was not inhibited the interactome was dominated by DNA repair proteins of various processes, most of which have been shown to be PARylated or interacting with PAR 23, 24, 47, [51] [52] [53] [54] . This observation is consistent with the finding that TARG1 is recruited to sites of DNA damage in an ARTD1-dependent manner 9 . This efficient recruitment is also in agreement with the strong enrichment of ARTD1 in the TARG1 interactome in the absence of olaparib (Fig. 1) .",

This might seem surprising, because ADP-ribosylation has been associated with nucleolar functions in a number of studies 29, 44, [55] [56] [57] . PAR, ARTD1 and ARTD2 can be found enriched in nucleoli under non-stress conditions and several nucleolar proteins are ADP-ribosylated and/or interact with ARTD1, ARTD2 or PAR 29, 32, 33, 55 . Interference with PAR metabolism in Drosophila results in mislocalization of nucleolar proteins and disintegration of nucleoli 55 . We did not observe fragmentation or other abnormalities of nucleoli in cells with OARD1 knock-out or TARG1 overexpression. In Drosophila Parp and Parg mutants, rRNA maturation defects have been observed, accompanied by a drop in cytoplasmic polysomes 55 . It was proposed that nucleolar PAR serves as a scaffold to recruit rRNA processing factors into nucleoli, which is required for accurate ribosome biogenesis 55 . PAR chains formed at DNA damage sites are capable of forming liquid phase structures together with proteins that contain low complexity domains 58 . Thus, PAR might also contribute to the liquid phase structure of nucleoli, which are formed around rDNA repeats Figure 7 . Model of a dual function of TARG1 in both RNA-and PAR-regulated cellular processes. Under steady-state conditions, TARG1 accumulates in nucleoli but constantly shuttles between nucleoli and the nucleoplasm (1). Accumulation of TARG1 in nucleoli is mediated by direct interaction with ribosomal RNA or proteins (RP) or other nucleolar proteins (NP; 2). PARylation modulates the localization and interactome of TARG1. TARG1 re-locates to the nucleoplasm upon DNA damage-induced ARTD1/2-dependent PARylation (3) . In nucleoli, TARG1 may contribute to ribosome biogenesis, e.g., by counteracting PARylation of RPs or controlling nucleolar PAR scaffolds. DNA damage-induced PARylation might serve to sequester TARG1 to the nucleoplasm to regulate PAR turnover at DNA damage sites (4) . Hypothetical interactions are marked by grey arrows.",

TARG1 inhibits ARTD1 in vitro and might be able to remove complete PAR chains from automodified ARTD1 9 . It remains however unknown whether TARG1 is able to modulate PARylation levels by either of these mechanisms in cells. Whether TARG1 is needed for nucleolar integrity by modulating nucleolar PARylation or by other means remains to be investigated. Nucleolar localization of TARG1 could be mediated by direct interaction of TARG1 with nucleolar RNA. This is supported by the fact that two ADPr binding-deficient TARG1 mutants that retain RNA binding ability still localize to nucleoli and that TARG1 wildtype and mutants only locate to transcriptionally active nucleoli. Actinomycin D treatment induces broad changes in the nucleolar proteome 62 . Especially ribosomal proteins and ribosome biogenesis factors depend on the presence of rRNA for nucleolar localization and leave nucleoli upon RNA polymerase I inhibition 34, 62 . Thus, in addition to interaction with rRNA, the possibility exists that the actinomycin D-induced loss of nucleolar accumulation of TARG1 is caused by more indirect mechanisms than the loss of direct interaction between TARG1 and nucleolar RNA.",

            "text": "Several reasons encouraged us to address a potential RNA binding activity of TARG1. These included the localization of the protein to nucleoli, the interaction with ribosomes and RBPs, and the finding that several macrodomains including the macrodomain of CHIKV-nsP3 and MacroD1 interact with RNA 14, 15 . Our study provides an initial characterization of the RNA binding activity of TARG1. We found TARG1 to interact with different RNA molecules in EMSAs, indicating that the binding is independent of the RNA sequence. The competition experiments suggested that RNA binding does not rely on the ADPr binding pocket. PAR efficiently competed with RNA for binding to TARG1, but not for binding to TARG1-G123E. We conclude that PAR occupies the same regions in TARG1 as RNA, explaining the competitive binding mode. The requirement for an intact ADPr binding pocket for efficient competition suggests that PAR binding to this pocket is substantial. This is consistent with the roughly 10-fold more efficient competition of TARG1 RNA binding by PAR compared to RNA and by the inefficient competition by ADPr (Fig. 6) . Thus, RNA binding occurs probably in the vicinity of the ADPr binding pocket of TARG1 and the efficient competition by PAR requires interaction in this pocket and at surface sites that also interact with RNA. The latter is supported by the presence of basic surface patches close to the ADPr binding pocket in TARG1 9 , which could mediate unspecific interaction with the negatively charged RNA backbone and also stabilize interaction with PAR, as suggested earlier 14, 15 .",

The decrease in T M of His-TARG1 upon incubation with RNA is likely to reflect the direct interaction of RNA with the protein, although T M decreases in the thermal shift assays have also been attributed to indirect effects 65 . Destabilization of TARG1 by RNA was antagonized by ADPr. Of surprise was the high concentration of ADPr necessary for the stabilization effect, indicating that the affinity for ADPr is rather low. This is consistent with a K i value of 119 \u00b5M for ADPr in OA-ADPr deacetylation reactions 12 , but less compatible with the K d of 8.4 \u00b5M for ADPr 9 . Together with the ADPr competition in EMSAs, we conclude that ADPr and RNA are able to interact with TARG1 simultaneously.",

            "text": "What is the functional consequence of TARG1 binding to RNA and ribosomal proteins? How does this relate to the role of TARG1 during DNA damage-induced PARylation? So far, it is not clear whether TARG1 directly regulates ribosome biogenesis. According to our proteomics data, TARG1 interacts with a variety of ribosomal proteins and ribosome biogenesis factors, but evidence for a possible role of TARG1 in particular steps of ribosome biogenesis is missing presently. Based on the recruitment of TARG1 to sites of DNA damage and a decreased resistance to DNA damaging agents of TARG1 knock-down cells, TARG1 was proposed to act as a DNA damage response factor 9 , a finding that in our experimental set-up could not be reproduced ( Supplementary Fig. S5 ). However, several RBPs and ribosomal proteins have been described as direct substrates of ADP-ribosylation during genotoxic stress 44, 66 . Some of these ribosomal proteins are important for the interaction of the 40S and 60S subunits 66, 67 . It was proposed that ARTD1-dependent ADP-ribosylation of RPL24 at E106 and RPS8 at E89 might interfere with the formation of inter-subunit bridges formed between RPL24 and RPS6 and between RPS8 and the 28S rRNA, thereby regulating ribosome assembly 66 . These observations were made in a breast cancer cell line, but not in several other lines. Nevertheless, it offers the intriguing possibility that ADP-ribosylation of these proteins regulates ribosome assembly. Whether TARG1 can reverse these modifications and thereby modulate ribosome biogenesis remains to be determined. The maintenance of nucleolar PAR levels seems to promote nucleolus formation and ribosome biogenesis in Drosophila 55 . Whether this is also occurring in mammalian cells needs to be demonstrated. Nevertheless, the role of PARylation in nucleolar functions might be more complex than anticipated. PARylation might affect nucleolar functions by several mechanisms, acting either as a scaffold important for the recruitment of ribosome biogenesis factors and at the same time as a PTM of ribosomal proteins, interfering with ribosome assembly. This might explain why the effects observed in OARD1 knock-out cells are rather weak. The presence of MacroD1 and/or MacroD2 might also compensate sufficiently for the lack of TARG1 and thus allow proliferation, at least in HeLa cells.",

It is tempting to speculate that this sequestration may prevent TARG1 from executing a so far unidentified nucleolar function, thereby contributing to the cellular stress response. The loss of TARG1 in humans correlates with a severe neurodegeneration phenotype 9 , which might be due to a chronic, suboptimal ribosome production. Thus, it will now be interesting to address the role of TARG1 in animal models, in which long-term consequences can be studied. ",
