The presence of antigenically disparate pulmonary viruses and the emergence of novel viruses assures the recurrence of lung damage with infection and resolution of each primary viral infection. Thus, there is a need to develop safe broad spectrum immunoprophylactic strategies capable of enhancing protective immune responses in the lung but which limits immune-mediated lung damage. The immunoprophylactic strategy described here utilizes a protein cage nanoparticle (PCN) to significantly accelerate clearance of diverse respiratory viruses after primary infection and also results in a host immune response that causes less lung damage.",

Treatment with PCN significantly increased survival and was marked by enhanced viral clearance, accelerated induction of viral-specific antibody production, and significant decreases in morbidity and lung damage. The enhanced protection appears to be dependent upon the prior development of inducible bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (iBALT) in the lung in response to the PCN treatment and to be mediated through CD4+ T cell and B cell dependent mechanisms.",

Conventional strategies to protection against respiratory pathogens have relied on vaccination against individual virus strains or the use of drug based therapies. However, the efficacy of these immunoprophylactic strategies is often significantly limited by either difficulty in engineering effective vaccines to some respiratory viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus, or because of evasion of acquired immunity as a result of antigenic variation of circulating respiratory viral pathogens (H1N1 swine influenza pandemic, 2009). In addition, conventional strategies are generally not applicable to newly emerging viruses (SARS outbreak, 2003) since their sudden appearance does not allow for time to develop a vaccine.",

Mucosal, as opposed to systemic vaccination is often more efficacious against mucosal pathogens due to their ability to induce secretory IgA [1, 2] . Despite such an advantage, vaccination of mucosal epithelial surfaces, especially those of the lung, pose significant safety concerns due to the fragility of the tissue and the likelihood of triggering unwanted pulmonary inflammation [3] . Consequently, it is critical that the development of novel methods for pulmonary immunization focus not only on the generation of effective mucosal immunity but also on the amelioration of concomitant inflammatory responses. Thus, new immunoprophylactic strategies that facilitate the local generation of protective immunity against a broad spectrum of lung pathogens and are able to diminish any detrimental inflammatory sequelae associated with the onset of primary adaptive and/or innate immune responses at the site of infection would be highly advantageous.",

Although iBALT development is known to occur in association with pulmonary immune responses [4, 5] , the significance of the role of iBALT in the resolution of infections has only recently been investigated, most notably in its role in adaptive immunity to influenza virus infections [6, 7] . Remarkably, iBALT can replace the function of the spleen and other secondary lymphoid tissues in primary adaptive immune responses [7] and also support the maintenance and re-expansion of adaptive immune memory responses following influenza virus infections [6] . The association of iBALT with lung pathologies in autoimmune diseases [5] , or the necessity of infection for its induction [4] , has diverted attention from the immunoprophylactic potential of iBALT. Here, we demonstrate that iBALT can be induced asymptomatically without infection or ensuing pathology, and that pre-existing iBALT enhances and accelerates the primary adaptive and likely innate immune responses to respiratory viruses in the na\u00efve host.",

This noninfectious PCN is comprised of 24 identical subunits that spontaneously self-assemble into hollow, spherical protein cages that are 12 nm in diameter ( Figure 1 ). Interestingly, pulmonary instillation of the PCN induced iBALT development within the lung parenchyma ( Figure 2A ) whereas treatment with PBS vehicle control did not induce any detectable iBALT formation ( Figure 2B and 2C). PCN-induced iBALT structures formed in the submu- cosa adjacent to blood vessels and lymph ducts associated with bifurcations of the conducting airways down to the level of the terminal bronchioles.

            "text": "To determine the extent to which this PCN treatment could provide a similar level of enhanced protection against other respiratory viruses we infected PCN-or PBS-treated mice with 1LD 100 of a murine-adapted SARS-coronavirus ( Figure 4) . Notably, all PCN-treated mice survived the infection with minimal weight loss whereas all of the PBS-treated mice rapidly lost weight and died by day 4 post-infection ( Figure 4A and 4B) . Similarly, we found that PCN-treatment enhanced protection in mice infected either with an alternative influenza virus strain (X31 -H3N2) ( Figure S2 -A and S2-B) or infected with pneumovirus of mice (PVM) [13] ( Figure S2 -C and S2-D). Infection of mice with PVM results in a viral lung infection similar to that of RSV infections in humans [13] . To test whether this phenomenon is common to other PCN constructs, BALB/c mice were also treated with the human H-chain ferritin (HFn) protein cage and challenged with influenza virus. As a control, a group of mice were also treated with bovine serum albumin (BSA). Although the reduction in viral burdens were significant for mice treated with the HFN and for those treated with our PCN, this reduction in viral burden was 100 fold greater in the PCN treated mice ( Figure S3 -A). Viral burdens were not significantly different between the BSA-treated and PBS-treated mice. Neither HFn nor BSA treatments protected mice from weight loss following infection ( Figure S3 -B). Thus, it is evident that the overall effect of this PCN enhancement of immunity is not a generic feature of all PCN architectures and that the small heat-shock PCN appears uniquely well suited to facilitate the enhancement of protection against a broad spectrum of respiratory viruses. The formation of iBALT structures in the PCN-treated mice ( Figure 2A ) and the increased cellular content recovered in the BALF of PCN-treated mice prior to their infection ( Table 1) were indicative of the ability of the PCN to act as a pulmonary immunostimulatory agent. In spite of this PCN-driven immunostimulation, we did not observe any histological damage to the alveolar architecture of the lung following the PCN-treatment regimen. The lack of any lung damage associated with the PCN treatment was further supported by the absence of any increase in the levels of serum albumin ( Figure 3C ) and lactate dehydrogenase ( Figure 3D ) recovered in the BALF of these mice at this time and the absence of any weight loss during the PCN treatment regimen (data not shown). However, since it has already been demonstrated that novel small agents can act in an immunostimulatory role in the lung to enhance protective innate immune responses [14] against bacterial pathogens and that we could detect immunogenic changes in the lung following the PCN treatment regimen, we examined the potential of our PCN treatment regimen to enhance protection against a range of pulmonary bacterial pathogens. Three days after the conclusion of the 5x PCN treatment regimen, mice received a pulmonary challenge of 10 3 colony-forming units of the phase 1 variant of Coxiella burnetii. Although the PCN-treated mice did not experience the level of weight loss observed in the PBS-control treated mice in the days following infection ( Figure 5A ), no difference in the rate of clearance of the C. burnetii infection was observed between the PBS-control and PCNtreatment groups ( Figure 5B ). We also tested this PCN treatment strategy in a similar fashion using Francisella tularemia and Yersinia pestis infection models, but again found no enhanced protection associated with the PCN treatment (data not shown). Thus the pulmonary immune environment elicited by this PCN treatment regimen seems to be uniquely suited to enhancing the resolution of subsequent primary viral infections but not subsequent bacterial infections of the lung.",

To investigate a potential adjuvant-like role for this LPS in the PCN-enhanced protection, we treated C3H/ HeJ mice, which have decreased responsiveness to LPS [15] , with PCN or PBS and then challenged them with PVM ( Figure S2 -C and D) or with influenza virus ( Figure S4 -A, B, and C). C3H/HeJ mice treated 3x or 5x with the PCN exhibited significantly reduced influenza viral burdens ( Figure S4 -A), less morbidity following influenza virus ( Figure S4 -B and S4-C) or PVM ( Figure S2 -C) infection, and significantly enhanced survival rates following PVM infection ( Figure S2 -D) relative to the PBS-treated controls. Furthermore, dramatically reducing the LPS in the PCN preparations (1.28 ng/dose) did not significantly alter the accelerated rate of viral clearance in mice that had been treated with this preparation ( Figure S4 -D). Finally, treatment with the HFn protein cage, which was also produced in E. coli and presumably with similar levels of LPS contamination, did not enhance protection against the influenza infection as well as treatment with the PCN preparation did ( Figure S3 ). Taken together, these data strongly suggest that the presence of LPS is not a major contributor to the enhanced protection and that the small heat-shock PCNs are intrinsically immunomodulatory.",

To determine the necessity of the humoral immune response for this PCN-enhanced protection, B cell-deficient uMT mice were treated with either PCN or PBS prior to infection with influenza virus. We observed accelerated viral clearance in the PCN-treated wild type mice, but not in the PCN-treated uMT mice ( Figure 7A ), demonstrating the requirement of B cells for the enhanced clearance. However, that the PCN-treated uMT and wild type mice actually gained weight after infection whereas the PBS-treated uMT and wild type mice lost weight ( Figure 7B ) indicated that the protective effect of the PCN treatment against body weight loss is not wholly dependent on the presence of B cells. Thus, the PCN-induced mechanisms responsible for accelerated viral clearance may be distinct from those responsible for decreased weight loss. We also observed that CD4 and CD8 T cells accumulated more rapidly in the lungs of PCN-treated mice following infection ( Figure 7C ) than in the lungs of PBS-treated mice. To determine whether CD4 or CD8 T cells played a role in PCN-mediated protection against influenza virus we depleted T cell subsets prior to and after infection. The accelerated viral clearance was still observed in PCN-treated mice that were depleted of CD8 T cells but not in those PCN-treated mice that were depleted of CD4 T cells or both CD4 and CD8 T cells ( Figure 7D ). Thus, CD8 T cells do not play a significant role in the enhanced protection against influenza infection in the PCN-treated mice, whereas, both B cells and CD4 T cells are critical for full protection.",

            "text": "In order to determine whether PCN-induced iBALT structures could exclusively provide this enhanced protection, we generated chimeric mice by reconstitution of splenectomized, irradiated C57BL/6 wild type and lymphotoxin-a (LTa) deficient mice with wild type or lymphotoxin-a knockout (LTa-KO) bone marrow cells (BMC). Using these chimeric mice we were able to effectively isolate iBALT generated immunity from that generated by conventional secondary lymphatic tissues. The following 4 types of bone marrow chimeric mice were made; chimeras that lacked secondary lymph nodes (2 0 LN) and Peyers patches but could still form organized iBALT (LTa deficient mice that received wild type BMC -SLP chimeric mice); chimeras that lacked 2 0 LN and Peyers patches and were unable to form organized iBALT due to their lack of LT-a (LTa deficient mice that received LTa deficient BMC -LTa-KO chimeric mice); chimeras that retained 2 0 LN and Peyers patches but were likewise unable to form organized iBALT due to their lack of LTa (wild type mice that received LTa deficient BMC -WT/LTa chimeric mice); and wild type control chimeras that retained 2 0 LN and Peyers patches and could form organized iBALT (wild type mice that received wild type BMCwild type chimeric mice) [7] . Following engraftment of the transferred BMC, the chimeras were treated 5x with PCN or PBS and then challenged with influenza virus 3 days after the last treatment. Seven days after infection, the PCN-treated wild type chimeric mice (filled squares) and SLP chimeric mice (filled circles) had significantly less virus in their lungs relative to their respective PBS-treated cohorts (open squares and open circles respectively) ( Figure 8C ). The extent of viral clearance in the PCN-treated WT/LTa chimeric mice (filled triangles) and LTa-KO chimeric mice (filled diamonds), both of which do not make organized iBALT [7] , was closer to or equivalent to their respective PBStreated mice (open triangles and open diamonds respectively). However, there was no weight loss in any of the PCN-treated chimeric mice ( Figure 8D ). Together, these results indicate that organized secondary lymphoid tissues are not required for the PCN-induced enhancement of protection against influenza virus infections and that pre-existing iBALT can exclusively account for the enhanced protection against the viral infection and is most likely also associated with the protection against weight loss. The association of iBALT structures with lung pathology in auto-immune diseases [5] and our observation that PCN treatment altered lung micro-architecture, elicited an influx of leukocytes and enhanced local pulmonary immunity through iBALT formation suggested that this PCN treatment regimen may leave the lung susceptible to the development of allergic airway hyperresponsiveness. To assess this possibility, mice that had been systemically sensitized to ovalbumin were treated 5x with PCN or PBS, then given 3 intranasal instillations of ovalbumin and subsequently challenged with methacholine. Interestingly, airway hyperresponsiveness (Penh values) was attenuated in PCN-treated mice ( Figure S5 -A) and eosinophil influx into the lungs was reduced ( Figure S5-B) . These results indicated that the PCN-induced alterations to the lung did not render the lung susceptible to or exacerbate allergic airway hyperresponsiveness.",

This is consistent with previous results showing that pulmonary immune responses in the presence of iBALT are more efficient and less damaging to the host [7] . Because iBALT can serve as a functional lymphoid tissue at the site of infection, it is likely to acquire antigen more quickly and to respond to inflammatory signals in the lung more rapidly, thereby facilitating the acceleration of local adaptive immune responses. Given that antibodies are extraordinarily powerful at neutralizing virus, preventing further infection, clearing antigen and even dampening inflammation via FcR ligation, the accelerated IgG and IgA responses in the lung most likely contribute, at least partially, to the enhanced viral clearance in PCN-treated mice.",

The ability to non-specifically enhance immune protection against a diversity of respiratory viruses, most notably in the absence of significant pulmonary inflammation, underscores the potential effectiveness of this strategy against infections by antigenic variants of currently circulating viruses (H1N1 swine influenza pandemic, 2009), by newly emerging viruses (SARS epidemic, 2003) and by the numerous common respiratory viruses to which specific vaccines have not yet been successfully developed (RSV vaccines).",
