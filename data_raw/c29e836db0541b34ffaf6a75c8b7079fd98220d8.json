We analysed 130 community-ARI and 140 inpatient-ARI episodes (5 inpatient-ARI excluded because multiple pathogens were detected), involving 138 and 207 samples respectively. Detection by PCR declined with days post-onset for influenza virus; decrease was faster for community-ARI than for inpatient-ARI. No such patterns were observed for noninfluenza respiratory virus infections. PathChip added substantially to viruses detected for community-ARI only. Clinical case definitions discriminated influenza from other mild-ARI but performed poorly for severe-ARI and for older participants. Rational strategies for diagnosis and surveillance of influenza and other respiratory virus must acknowledge the differences between ARIs presenting in community and hospital settings.",

Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which detects viral nucleic acid by use of amplification techniques, is now considered as the gold standard assay for detection of respiratory viruses, and also has the advantage of short turn-around times as compared to Scientific RepoRts | 7:42963 | DOI: 10 .1038/srep42963 methods based on virus culture and isolation 13 . Moreover, multiplex RT-PCR (MRT-PCR) assays, which allow for rapid detection of multiple types of known viral agents, are now widely available 14 . Studies have evaluated the performance of PCR-based assays for diagnosing respiratory viruses [15] [16] [17] , but were mostly restricted to either outpatients or inpatients, or to at-risk groups such as the elderly and young children. Moreover, large-scale pathogen detection technologies, like the Genome Institute of Singapore (GIS) PathChip, have recently been developed 18 , and there is also a need to rationalize how these could be integrated with routinely available assays.",

Post episode onset, the proportion positive for influenza decreased (Ct value increased) faster in community-ARI as compared to inpatient-ARI, but no such pattern was observed for non-influenza panel viruses; likewise, others have found slower viral clearance in inpatients compared to outpatients for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 21 , and a lack of association between days post-onset and Ct values for adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus 1-3 22 .

In contrast to multiplexed PCR-based technologies which rely on a set of primers that target a finite number of specific pathogens, the PathChip is designed to detect a wide array of pathogens simultaneously by detecting signatures in the pathogen genome sequences. While costly, our results suggests that it has the potential to complement existing technologies as a diagnostic tool. Sim\u00f5es et al previously evaluated the diagnostic value of the PathChip using paediatric nasal wash samples and reported variable sensitivity ranging from 30.8% to 95.0% and reasonable specificity from 88.4% to 100% 18 . In our study, the PathChip was a valuable addition in community-ARI where it substantially increased the proportion positive for respiratory etiological agents, so that only about 20% of febrile episodes did not have a viral aetiology identified. Notably, the vast majority of additional viruses detected were those known to cause ARI. It may thus help in ruling out more sinister causes of ARI if added to MRT-PCR for surveillance in community settings; it may also help detect unexpected but dangerous infections such as SARS and MERS-CoV following further validation on actual patient samples with such infections. However, due to the high cost of the assay (about four times MRT-PCR) and the imperfect sensitivity for some pathogens (as low as 30.8% for adenovirus), we opted to test only the RT-PCR negative samples with the PathChip. As such, we are unable to comment on its sensitivity for samples from adults, which may be inferior to the previously published results which used samples from paediatric subjects, who are known to have higher viral loads for some viruses 23, 24 . However, given its current cost, variable sensitivity and slower turn-around time as compared to MRT-PCR (about 20 hours for PathChip), we believe this technology is most appropriately used in the way we designed our study, which is to detect additional respiratory viral pathogen positive episodes as an adjunct to more widely available MRT-PCR panels designed to cover the most common pathogens from community-based samples.",

            "text": "Finally, our study highlights how the same clinical case definitions, which have been used in both community 11 and inpatient settings 25 , may actually perform differently in the two settings for distinguishing influenza from other respiratory infections, identifying influenza cases, and increasing the yield of diagnostic assays. We found that, while respiratory symptoms themselves are poor in distinguishing influenza from other ARI causes, clinical case definitions using fever or temperature cut-off points demonstrated good discriminatory value in our mild-ARI episodes, which should reflect what can be anticipated in primary care settings. However, for ARI severe enough to require hospitalisation, the case definitions had poorer discriminatory value. This was partly because, while a good majority of older individuals (87.2%) with severe influenza had self-reported fever (as in FRI), only about half met the temperature criteria used for ILI case definitions ( Table 5 ). The use of such high temperature cut-off points would hence substantially reduce sensitivity for detecting influenza in the elderly. Also, non-influenza episodes in ARI severe enough to require hospitalization are more likely to also have a higher temperature than non-influenza episodes in mild ARI; this further reduces the ability of ILI case definitions to distinguish influenza from other respiratory causes in the inpatient setting. The choice of an appropriate case definition hence depends on the objectives and setting of the application. If the aim is to diagnose as many influenza cases as possible (e.g. for identifying patients for antiviral treatment or outbreak management), ILI case definitions have inadequate sensitivity, particularly in older age groups. However, the discriminatory value of ILI criteria finds application when aiming to reduce background noise during syndromic surveillance, either in community type settings or even a healthcare worker population 26 . The ILI case definitions are also useful for optimizing the yield of influenza viruses from samples tested, and particularly efficient in settings where milder ARI presentations are encountered (Fig. 2A) ; and if the aim is to identify all types of respiratory viruses for surveillance, ILI criteria would also modestly improve the probability of obtaining a positive result as compared to sampling all ARI in both mild as well as severe presentations (Fig. 2B,D) .",

While not ideal, Supplementary Table S1 suggests that influenza cases from this historical dataset which were classified as mild were reasonably similar to those from the community cohort, and likewise those classified as severe were similar to those from the later inpatient study. A sensitivity analysis without the influenza cases from our historical dataset gave a similar result. However, even with these additional influenza cases, the numbers remained inadequate to assess the performance of the case definitions for mild influenza in older age groups, and we are also unable to assess performance in paediatric subjects. Secondly, the panel of viruses tested on the multiplex PCR assay was not comprehensive; while this was supplemented by the PathChip, there is no means of ascertaining what proportion of the remaining ARI episodes are truly not due to an infectious viral aetiology. We also recognise that our study population, in particular the community cohort, may not be representative of the general community, which was further complicated by fluctuations in the rate at which participants notified us of ARI episodes, as well as intra-seasonal variations within each year and sporadic outbreaks of particular respiratory pathogens 27 .",

PCR-based assays may still be relevant for detecting influenza amongst inpatients that present late but less so for community ARI episodes with delayed presentations. The PathChip may add value for respiratory virus detection in samples negative by multiplex RT-PCR, but only for community-ARI. Finally, US-CDC and WHO ILI case definitions had similar performance for mild ARI, but performed less adequately amongst presentations severe enough to require hospitalisation, including in older individuals. Rational strategies for diagnosis and surveillance of influenza and other respiratory viruses must acknowledge the differences between these two populations.",

This assay was used to detect additional viruses beyond what was covered by the primers within the MRT-PCR panel used. For each sample, the cDNA was amplified from extracted nucleic acid.
