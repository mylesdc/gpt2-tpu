In this study, we investigated the cell death processes during productive HHV-6A infection and the underlying mechanisms. Annexin V-PI staining and electron microscopy indicated that HHV-6A is a strong inducer of apoptosis. HHV-6A infection decreased mitochondrial transmembrane potential and led to morphological changes of mitochondria. The cell death was associated with activation of caspase-3 and cleavage of DNA repair enzyme poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase, which is known to be an important substrate for activated caspase-3. Caspase-9 was activated significantly in HHV-6Ainfected cells, whereas caspase-8 was not activated obviously. Moreover, HHV-6A infection upregulated Bax and downregulated Bcl-2. This is the first demonstration of mitochondrion-mediated, caspase-dependent apoptosis in HHV-6A-infected cells.",

Apoptosis, a regulated suicide program, which is characterized by chromatin condensation, DNA fragmentation, membrane blebbing and cell shrinkage, can be induced by different factors such as virus infection, ultraviolet (UV) irradiation and deprivation of growth factors. Induction of apop-tosis is mediated either through death receptors (extrinsic pathway), or at the mitochondrial level (intrinsic pathway) [3] [4] [5] . The intrinsic pathway involves activation of caspase-9 whereas the extrinsic pathway involves the activation of caspase-8, which is initiated by the interaction of Fas ligand with death receptors. Both caspase-8 and caspase-9 activate caspase-3, which, along with other caspases, cleave critical cellular proteins, resulting in apoptosis.",

HHV-6 remains latent after primary infection and reactivates in an immunocompromised state, as other human herpesviruses do. It has been observed that HHV-6 can infect various types of cells, although this virus mainly infects and replicates in CD4 + T-lymphocytes. HHV-6 has an immunosuppressive effect on T-cell functions, including IL-2 synthesis and cell proliferation [9, 10] . HHV-6 has been shown to induce apoptosis in cultured T cells, oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, neuronal cell lines, and CD4 + T lymphocytes isolated from healthy donors [11] [12] [13] [14] .

Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 1,000 g for 10 min. Virus was concentrated from the medium of infected cells by centrifugation at 80,000 g for 2 h. The pellets were suspended in a small volume of medium and used for infection. Titers were determined as viral DNA equivalents by quantitative PCR and confirmed by endpoint dilution of viral inocula on cell cultures. A multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 15 virus DNA copies per cell was used. Uninfected CBMCs were similarly cultured and treated as HHV-6-infected cells and used for mock infection. HSB-2 cells were either mock-infected or adsorbed with HHV-6 for 2 h at 37\u00b0C. After adsorption, the cells were incubated in growth medium at a concentration of 2.5\u00d710 5 cells/ mL to allow optimal culturing devoid of cell stress due to excessive cell accumulation.",

Two major subgroups with distinct genetic, immunological and virologic characteristics have been named as HHV-6A and HHV-6B [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] . Ichimi et al. reported that in cord blood lymphocytes, HHV-6 induced apoptosis by an unknown mechanism, which was independent of death receptors [29] . In contrast, Inoue et al. reported that both TNF-\u03b1 and anti- CD95 and anti-CD95L antibodies augmented HHV-6-induced apoptosis, suggesting an involvement of death receptors in HHV-6-induced apoptosis [11] . Caspases play a critical role in apoptosis. During apoptosis, caspases cleave specific substrates and activate downstream molecules, which eventually culminate in cell death [30] . Although HHV-6-induced apoptosis has been widely confirmed, the role of the caspase cascade in HHV-6-induced apoptosis has not been studied. In this study, we demonstrated that activated caspase-9 and caspase-3 were increased in HHV-6Ainduced apoptosis of T cells, but there were no significantly changes of activated caspase-8. In addition, we found that PARP was cleaved in HHV-6A-induced T cells apoptosis. Caspase-3 is a common effector of both death receptor and the mitochondrial signaling pathways. Caspase-8 is activated by the death receptor signaling pathway, whereas caspase-9 is activated in the mitochondrial signaling pathway during apoptosis. We speculate that HHV-6A-induced apoptosis could be via the mitochondrial apoptotic pathways.",

In recent years, many viruses and viral gene products in different families have been found to induce apoptosis during their infection cycles [36] [37] [38] . Apoptosis may facilitate the release of virus progeny and help the virus to evade the immune surveillance by attenuating inflammation. On the other hand, premature apoptosis, most likely evoked by host defense mechanisms, aborts virus infection and therefore limits virus productivity and infectivity. The intricate balance between life and death of infected cells must be regulated by viral products or by interaction between virus and host to ensure a successful infection cycle.",

To further confirm the effect of HHV-6A infection on cell apoptosis, we examined the morphologic changes in HHV-6A-infected cells by transmission electron microscopy. HHV-6A-infected cells showed marginalized and condensed chromatin matrix, shrinkage and blebbing of the cytoplasm and fragmented nuclei, which are the typical features of apoptosis. In contrast, mock-infected cells showed uniformly stained nuclei (",
