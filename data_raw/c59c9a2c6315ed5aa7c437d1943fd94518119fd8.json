PA combined with LF or EF constitutes the lethal toxin (LeTx) or edema toxin (EdTx), respectively 8 . The first step in cellular intoxication involves binding of an 83 kD form of PA (PA83) to specific cell surface receptors (ANTXR1 9 and ANTXR2 10 ). Following receptor binding, PA83 is cleaved after the Arg-Lys-Lys-Arg sequence at amino acid position 167 by a furin-family protease. This results in a 63 kDa form (PA63) that spontaneously oligomerizes to either a heptamer or an octamer [11] [12] [13] . Dissociation of the 20 kDa form (PA20) from PA83 allows PA63 to bind to either or both EF and LF. Then, oligomeric PA63-receptor complexes translocate LF or EF into the cytosol, where they promote intoxication 14 .",

Second, since immunization with PA63 produces neutralizing antibody, it can be used to immunize animals. In the present study, we developed four murine mAbs that could well neutralize LeTx in vitro, and one clone was selected to form a human/mouse chimeric antibody known as hmPA6. This antibody showed excellent neutralization both in vitro and in vivo. The current status of therapeutic mAbs was directed against the major virulence factors: PA, LF, EF and capsule. Although LF could induce cell death, its effective result in vivo was unsatisfactory. PA was the critical factor which recognized cell membrane receptors. Then PA was cleaved to active PA63 by Furin which induced LF or EF into cells. Our strategy was to get antibody against active PA63. To immunize the mice, we used PA63, which is formed by the dissociation of PA20 from PA83, instead of PA83, because although PA63 is a part of PA83, these factors may have different structures and expose LF-or EF-binding sites. These differences may in turn lead to the production of completely different antibodies against anthrax in vivo. In the present study, we showed that PA63 could induce neutralizing antibodies, as proven through in vitro and vivo experiments. On the other hand, it was difficult to obtain active PA63 based on present methods. We screened out positive clones by active PA63 in a different way. Based on traditional ELISA, we coated plates with alive J774A.1 cells overninght at cell culture condition. Then PA83 was added into wells incubated about 2 h. The negative control was cells without PA83 adding. The rest of ELISA procedures was as normal. In this screening system, the active PA63 was more closed to in vivo state and could oligomerize to heptamer. In all, more diversity antibodies was generated in the immunization stage and more effective antibodies was obtained in the screening system.",

Passive immunization with protective antibodies is therefore considered the primary available biodefense measure 21 , especially in bioterrorist-associated exposure. In the present study, hmPA6 was found to provide good protection in rats challenged with anthrax virulence factors. In the in vitro experiment, hmPA6 maintained 100% cell viability with 0.01 \u03bc g/mL LF and 0.1 \u03bc g/mL PA83, while non-correlated IgG maintained only 50% cell viability. Further, with 10 \u03bc g/mL LF and 0.1 \u03bc g/mL PA83, hmPA6 maintained > 80% cell viability, while the control antibody maintained only 26%. Moreover, in previous study, they often used F344 rats challenged with LeTx (Table 1) before tested with B. anthracis spores. Therefore F344 rats was injected with LeTx vial tail vain. The hmPA6 with a Kd of 0.14 nM protected all rats from death at a concentration of 0.3 mg/kg (45 \u03bc g per rat). However, in a previous study, 1.5 mg/kg raxibacumab (of human origin) with a Kd of 2.78 nM was administered 24 h before anthrax lethal toxin administration in F344 rats 24 . We also tested an hmPA6 concentration of 0.6 mg/kg (90 \u03bc g per rat) administered 48 h before LeTx injection; this dose also protected all rats. Our findings indicate that hmPA6 may be used as a prophylactic. Other humanized or chimeric mAbs have been examined in other animal model, but the affinity found in the present study is the same as or better than those found previously 32, 33 . Murine mAbs against PA have been developed, but our chimeric mAb maintains a balance between the high-affinity murine component and the low-immunogenicity human component. Other mAbs of human origin are available but are difficult to produce and are expensive 32 . The chimeric mAb hmPA6 is produced in 293F cells, and the method of production is very convenient.",

The absorbance values at 450 nm of hmPA6 were plotted using GraphPad Prism software version 5.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA).",

Then, the mixture was incubated with 5 \u03bc g of hmPA6 at 4 \u00b0C and rotated for 3 h. Next, 50 \u03bc l protein-A Sepharose (Invitrogen, USA) was added and incubated at 4 \u00b0C. The immune complexes that formed were washed 3 times with PBST. Subsequently, 50 \u03bc L elution buffer was added to separate these antibody-antigen complexes from protein-A Sepharose. As a negative control, another anti-TLR4 chimeric antibody (generated by our lab) was created using the same protocol. The protein complexes were isolated by running two 10% SDS-PAGE gels; one was transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane, and the other was stained with Coomassie blue. The nitrocellulose membrane was blocked at 4 \u00b0C overnight, incubated with 1:5000 diluted rabbit polyclonal anti-PA antibody (Pierce, USA) for 1 h at RT, washed with PBST 3 times, and reacted with 1:4000 diluted goat anti-rabbit IgG-HRP conjugate (Sigma) for an additional 30 min at RT. The membrane was washed 3 times with PBST, and the hybridization signal was detected using ECL Western Blot substrate. The target bands on SDS-PAGE gel were subjected to mass spectra identification with an ABI 4700 proteomics analyzer and MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Framingham, MA). The mass spectra were then searched within the Swiss-Prot database using the MASCOT search engine (http://www.matrix science.com; Matrix Science, UK).",

Briefly, the IHS was determined by evaluation of both staining density and intensity. Multiplication of the intensity and percentage scores yielded the final IHS. Samples with IHS \u2264 3 were considered weakly positive, while those with IHS \u2265 6 were considered strongly positive.
