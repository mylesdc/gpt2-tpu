Patients with tonsillar hypertrophy were typically younger, and had more viral findings, but only bocavirus-1 was more often found in tonsils when compared to patients with recurrent tonsillitis. Respectively, they also had less self-reported pollen allergy, but no differences were found in food allergies between the groups. After age-adjusted analysis, tonsillar hypertrophy was associated with higher tonsillar mRNA expressions of IL-37. Other than age, no other significant co-factors were found. IL-37 (formerly IL-1 family member 7) is a fundamental inhibitor of innate immunity [9, 10] . It has been shown to be expressed in macrophages, monocytes, plasma and epithelial cells [11] . After ligand activation, IL-37 inhibits inflammatory cytokines (especially IL-1\u03b2, but also IL-6, IL-7, IFN-\u03b3, and TNF-\u03b1) and augments the level of antiinflammatory IL-10 and T regulatory cells [11] . We have previously shown that the expression of IL-37 is closely and positively associated with other \"immune activation/regulatory\" cytokines (IL-10, IL-17, IL-37, TGF-\u03b2, FOXP3, GATA3, RORC2, Tbet) in tonsils [2] . The current analysis adds that tonsillar expression of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-37 is also independently and positively associated with tonsillar hypertrophy.",

The data were analysed using backward stepwise linear regression analysis after logarithmic transformation. Only significant co-factors were used as adjustments in the final model [12] [13] [14] . We expected to see differences in IFN expression (lower responses in recurrent tonsillitis than in tonsillar hypertophy group), since they have antiviral properties and they up-regulate the expression of MHC Class II molecules on cells which increases the immune system's ability to recognize viruses [14, 15] . However, we did not observe these differences. We speculate that tonsillar hypertophy may be a consequence of chronic inflammation in tonsils and the same interferon pathways are equally activated in both conditions. We have previously found strong intragroup correlations of tonsillar IFN expression(IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2, IFN-\u03b3, IL-28) [2] . Age was the main clinical characteristic differentiating the tonsillectomy indication groups. In agreement with previous findings [16] , we found that obstruction due to the hypertrophy is more common with younger children where as adults have more recurrent tonsillitis. The age difference between the groups also explains the differences in smoking and in additional adenotomy performed. Interestingly, Reis and colleagues found no difference between the age distribution of hypertrophy and tonsillitis patients, but the narrow age range of their subjects (ages 2-11 years) may explain the lack of difference [17] .",

However, intratonsillar virus detection was low and did not show any statistically significant differences except for bocavirus-1. The results of nasopharyngeal and intratonsillar virus detection vs tonsillar cytokine responses are discussed in detail in our previous report [2] .",

The mean follicular area has been found to be larger, and the number of germinal centers higher, in the hypertrophy group compared to the recurrent tonsillitis [17] [18] [19] . In our study, the samples were taken from inside of the tonsils to minimize the margin of error and the possibility to misinterpreted differences between the groups. Seasonal changes, e.g. pollen and influenza seasons, may affect the expression of peripheral T cells [20] , but we found no differences in tonsillar expression of cytokines between the seasons of the surgery. Also, respiratory viruses are continuously detected in children with chronic tonsillitis throughout the year [21] [22] [23] . Circulating serum 25(OH)D level has been shown to been positively associated with IL-37 level [3] , but here it did not confound the results.",

In addition to forming cell-surface receptor complexes, IL-37 translocates to the nucleus where it binds to nuclear DNA and participate in transcription.

Our data suggest that T-cell and interferon gene expressions appear to relatively stable over the two main indications of tonsillectomy, tonsillar hypertrophy and recurrent tonsillitis. However, anti-inflammatory immune responses, namely IL-37, might be slightly stronger in patients with tonsillar hypertrophy than with patients with recurrent tonsillitis.",
