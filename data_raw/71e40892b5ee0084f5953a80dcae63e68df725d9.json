Ebola glycoprotein (GP) is involved in this process through activating dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages. However, the mechanism is unclear. Here, we showed that LSECtin (also known as CLEC4G) plays an important role in GP-mediated inflammatory responses in human DCs. Anti-LSECtin mAb engagement induced TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 production in DCs, whereas silencing of LSECtin abrogated this effect. Intriguingly, as a pathogenderived ligand, Ebola GP could trigger TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 release by DCs through LSECtin. Mechanistic investigations revealed that LSECtin initiated signaling via association with a 12-kDa DNAX-activating protein (DAP12) and induced Syk activation. Mutation of key tyrosines in the DAP12 immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif abrogated LSECtinmediated signaling. Furthermore, Syk inhibitors significantly reduced the GP-triggered cytokine production in DCs. Therefore, our results demonstrate that LSECtin is required for the GP-induced inflammatory response, providing new insights into the EBOV-mediated inflammatory response.",

Using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, our data demonstrated that GP1-Fc binds LSECtin in a dose-dependent way (S1D Fig). LSECtin has a typical carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) and binds Ebola GP in a Ca 2+ -dependent manner [25] . Amino acid sequence alignment of the CRD of LSECtin with those of other C-type lectins indicates that 2 amino acids, Asn256 and Asn274, interact with Ca 2+ through their carbonyl groups. Thus, we mutated the residues to aspartic acid. The mutant LSECtin (N256D or N274D) did not bind Ebola GP, which suggests that these residues are critical for recognition of EBOV GP (S1D Fig) . Furthermore, we also performed a cell surface staining assay and demonstrated that Jurkat cells lentivirally transfected with LSECtin rather than mutant LSECtin bind GP (S1E Fig). Next, we explore the expression profile of LSECtin in human blood leukocytes. As shown in S2A First, we found that Ebola GP can bind MDDCs. More importantly, the activity is partially dependent on LSECtin. These results suggest that LSECtin involves GP binding to MDDCs (Fig 1A) .",

Although eVLPs produced in insect cells or mammalian 293T cells exhibit similar DC-stimulating activities [26] , eVLPs were also produced in 293T mammalian cells to determine whether the data are influenced by the insect cell expression system for GP. Similar with the results shown in Fig 1B, eVLPs in the presence of human FcR inhibitor. Bound proteins were detected by APC-conjugated mouse anti-human IgG and analyzed by flow cytometry.

To directly investigate the role of LSECtin in GP1-mediated proinflammatory cytokine production, control or LSECtin siRNA-transfected MDDCs were stimulated with plate-bound GP1-Fc. Similar to the results as described above, GP1-Fc-induced cytokine production was impaired in LSECtin \"knockdown\" DCs ( Fig 1D) . In addition, our results demonstrated that the production of cytokines induced by eVLPs and plate-bound GP1-Fc was inhibited by Pepinh-MYD, a MyD88 inhibitor peptide, which is consistent with the previous reports that eVLP and shed GP induced cytokine production through TLR4/MyD88 signaling (S5A and S5B Fig) [13, 27] . However, the cytokine production induced by LPS is not impacted in LSECtin \"knockdown\" DCs, suggesting that MyD88 signaling pathway is intact (Fig 1D) . Given that the production of cytokines is partially inhibited by LSECtin silencing or MyD88 inhibitory peptide, we next determined whether there is a synergistic efficacy of LSECtin silencing in combination with MyD88 inhibitory peptide. We found that MDDCs treated by double silencing produced less TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 than LSECtin silencing or MyD88 inhibitory peptide alone treated cells ( Fig  1E) . In addition, we also demonstrated that there is a synergistic efficacy of LSECtin and TLR4-induced cytokines after LSECtin/TLR4 double \"knockdown\" DCs (S6 Fig).

To specially and clearly explore the LSECtin signaling, we use anti-LSECtin mAbs, including CCA023, CFD051 and CCB059, to stimulate LSECtin signaling upon crosslinking in MDDCs. We treated MDDCs with immobilized anti-LSECtin mAbs. The production of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 was significantly increased in MDDCs after 24h of treatment with CFD051, compared with CCA023, CCB059 and the control mIgG1, suggesting that only CFD051-LSECtin engagement promoted cytokine production (Fig 2A) . We also observed similar changes in mRNA levels. We found that LSECtin engagement induced rapid but transient mRNA expression for the cytokines IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 ( Fig 2B) . The IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 mRNA amounts peaked approximately 3h after LSECtin ligation and subsequently declined to close to baseline 6h after LSECtin crosslinking. In addition, LSECtin engagement increased the maturation of MDDCs, as characterized by increased surface expression of HLA-DR, CD83 and CD86 ( Fig 2C) . Interestingly, GP/LSECtin interaction also triggers the LSECtin crosslinking triggers proinflammatory cytokine production. (A) Plate-bound anti-LSECtin CFD051 mAb significantly enhanced the production of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 by MDDCs compared with plate-bound anti-LSECtin CCA023 mAb, CCB059 mAb and mIgG isotype control. Cytokine production in the supernatants was measured by ELISA after overnight stimulation. (B) Real-time RT-PCR analysis of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 from MDDCs seeded on control mIgG1-coated or CFD051-coated plates for the indicated times. The results are presented as the mean \u00b1 SD of triplicate wells normalized to GAPDH mRNA. (C) Flow cytometry analysis of cell surface markers on MDDCs left in medium alone or stimulated with immobilized control mIgG1 or CFD051 or with LPS (10ng/ml) for 24h. The data are presented as mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) values. (D) MDDCs were transfected with control siRNA or with LSECtin-specific siRNA for 48h and then stimulated with control mIgG1 or CFD051. After stimulation, cytokine production in the supernatants was measured by ELISA. (E) ELISA of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 production by human MDDCs stimulated with immobilized CFD051 F(ab 0 ) 2 fragments in the absence or presence of LPS for 18h. Data present the mean \u00b1 SD of two independent experiments. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001. To determine whether TLR signaling is involved in LSECtin-mediated cytokine production, MDDCs were pretreated with Pepinh-MYD (a MyD88 inhibitor) and stimulated the cells with plate-bound CFD051. Our results show that MyD88, a crucial adaptor of TLR signaling, was dispensable for LSECtin-mediated cytokine production (S8 Fig). To prove that the cellular effects mediated by LSECtin engagement were specific, we treated the siRNAtransfected MDDCs with CFD051 overnight. We found that after LSECtin \"knockdown\", MDDCs stimulated with CFD051 produced less TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 ( Fig 2D) . To exclude the possibility that the TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 production was simply due to Fc receptor engagement, we prepared F(ab 0 ) 2 fragments of anti-LSECtin mAb and used them to stimulate MDDCs. As shown in Fig 2E, plate-bound F(ab 0 ) 2 fragments from anti-LSECtin mAb induced the production of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 and markedly increased their production in the presence of LPS (a TLR4 agonist), suggesting cooperation between TLR4 and LSECtin signaling in the MDDCs.",

The negatively charged amino acid D50 in the transmembrane region of DAP12 is dispensable for the interaction (S10 Fig). However, the interaction of LSECtin and DAP12 was mediated through the transmembrane region of LSECtin (Fig 3D) , as deficiency of the transmembrane region abolished its association with DAP12. Next, we further showed that a short stretch of transmembrane region proximal to the intracellular domain of LSECtin (amino acids 32-43) was required for association with DAP12 ( Fig 3E) . In addition, the interaction of LSECtin and DAP12 was independent of the only two hydrophilic threonines (T41 and T42) within the transmembrane region of LSECtin (S10 Fig) .",

To determine whether LSECtin-mediated signaling is dependent on DAP12, MDDCs were transfected with siRNA specific for DAP12 or with control siRNA for 72 h (Fig 3F) . We found that LSECtin failed to induce the production of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 in DAP12 \"knockdown\" MDDCs after treatment with CFD051 antibody (Fig 3G) , suggesting that LSECtin transduces signaling in a DAP12-dependent manner. LSECtin binds Ebola GP and is required for eVLP-induced cytokine production. To determine whether eVLPs were able to induce tyrosine kinase-based intracellular signals through LSECtin, Jurkat cells were transfected with LSECtin and DAP12. Jurkat cells do not express LSECtin and DAP12 and refractory to Ebola GP-mediated infection [28] . The LSECtin-and DAP12transfected cells were either left unstimulated or stimulated with eVLP. Whole-cell extracts were subjected to Western blotting using an anti-phosphotyrosine Ab (4G10) to detect tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. Compared with correspondingly stimulated LSECtin or DAP12 transfectants, eVLP-treated LSECtin-DAP12 cells yielded increased amounts of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins (Fig 4A) . LSECtin bearing the two amino acid mutants (N256D andN274D) does not bind Ebola GP1-Fc. Consistent with this observation, LSECtin mutants (N256D and N274D) did not deliver an activation signal in response to eVLP stimulation, suggesting that LSECtin recognizes its ligand dependently of Ca 2+ -binding sites (Fig 4B) .",

To determine whether the two tyrosines of DAP12 are required for LSECtin/DAP12-mediated phosphorylation of protein tyrosines, we transduced a lentivirus encoding wild-type (WT) or mutant DAP12 in which the ITAM tyrosines at positions 91 and 102 were mutated to phenylalanine (2YF) into Jurkat-LSECtin stable cells. Our results show that eVLP stimulation enhanced the phosphorylation of protein tyrosines in Jurkat-LSECtin cells expressing WT but not mutant DAP12 (Fig 4C) , suggesting that the two tyrosines within the ITAM are required for LSECtin/DAP12-mediated phosphorylation of protein tyrosines. We next determine whether ligation of LSECtin results in tyrosine phosphorylation of DAP12. Jurkat-LSECtin/DAP12 and Jurkat-LSECtin/DAP12 (Y2F) stable cells were stimulated with eVLP. To detect DAP12 phosphorylation, DAP12 protein was immunoprecipitated and tyrosine phosphorylation of DAP12 was examined with 4G10 antibody. Our results show that eVLP induced DAP12 phosphorylation in Jurkat-LSECtin cells expressing WT but not mutant DAP12, although mutant DAP12 can also co-precipitate LSECtin (Fig 4D) . More importantly, MDDCs stimulated with eVLP were found to induce DAP12 phosphorylation, but knockdown of LSECtin resulted in a substantial decrease in DAP12 phosphorylation (Fig 4E) . In addition, the phosphorylation of DAP12 is independent on TLR4 activation as the effect is not affected after TLR4 \"knockdown\" in MDDCs (S11 Fig). These results suggest that eVLP-triggered DAP12 phosphorylation is mediated through LSECtin.",

In addition, the Syk inhibitor piceatannol abrogated the expression of cytokines in MDDCs induced by CFD051 in mRNA and protein levels (Fig 5B and 5C ). Identical results were achieved with interfering RNAs (siRNAs) against Syk (S12 Fig), confirming specificity of the Syk inhibitor. Syk inhibition by piceatannol also abrogates the enhanced expression of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 by LSECtin-TLR4 cross-talk (S13 Fig). Considering that another C-type lectin, DC-SIGN, has been shown to mediate signal transduction through Raf-1 [21] , we investigated whether Raf-1 is also involved in LSECtinmediated signaling. The Raf inhibitor GW5074 did not inhibit the expression of cytokines in MDDCs induced by CFD051 (S14 Fig). We next determined whether ligation of LSECtin by eVLP leads to the activation of Syk and ERK. We found that the activation of Syk and ERK induced by eVLP was significantly impaired in LSECtin \"knockdown\" DCs ( Fig 5D) . In addition, the phosphorylation of ERK induced by eVLP was also significantly impaired in TLR4 \"knockdown\" DCs, but the activation of Syk is independent on TLR4 signaling (S15 Fig). These results suggest that eVLP activates Syk through a LSECtin-dependent way. We then examined whether Syk is involved in cytokine expression induced by eVLP. Syk inhibition by piceatannol reduced the production of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 by DCs stimulated with eVLP (Fig 5E) , plate-bound GP1-Fc (Fig 5F) or eVLPm (Fig 5G) . R406 is another specific Syk inhibitor and in clinical trials for human inflammatory diseases [30] . In the presence of R406, the production of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 by DCs is also significantly suppressed after the stimulation by eVLPs ( Fig  5H) , plate-bound GP1-Fc (Fig 5I) or eVLPm (Fig 5G) . As a control, LPS does not activate Syk kinase and the cytokine production induced by LPS is not suppressed in the presence of either piceatannol or R406 (S16 Fig), which suggests that the inhibition of Syk signaling by piceatannol or R406 is specific to the eVLP and GP1-Fc treatment.",

To investigate the role of CLRs in regulation of myeloid cell function, mAbs to selectively trigger surface receptors has been widely used, which provides important insight into the signaling and function of different CLRs [33] . We used mAbs to selectively crosslink LSECtin, inducing Syk-and CARD9-dependent inflammatory cytokine production in DCs. It is noteworthy that the anti-LSECtin mAbs failed to induce cytokine production by DCs after transfection with LSECtin siRNA, which further confirms the specificity of the anti-LSECtin mAbs. Thus, LSECtin signaling by itself is sufficient to induce activation of the Syk/ CARD9 pathway and gene expression. We also observed that anti-LSECtin mAb treatment combined with LPS enhanced the production of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 by DCs, which indicates that LSECtin might regulate TLR signaling.",

These characteristics of CLRs increase the host's flexibility in recognizing various molecular patterns, including those in exogenous pathogens and endogenous ligands. Our previous studies showed that LSECtin binds activated T cells and inhibits their function through an unidentified endogenous ligand [34] . However, the function of LSECtin as a PRR is still undefined. We have shown here that LSECtin recognizes Ebola GP and transduces an activating signal in DCs. This is contrary to DC-SIGN-mediated immunomodulatory function. For example, DC-SIGN was employed by measles virus to suppress antiviral type I IFN responses and then escape antiviral immunity [35] . It is noteworthy that we used eVLPs or plate-coated GP1-Fc to induce the production of proinflammatory cytokines by MDDCs. Previous studies showed that soluble GP1 alone does not induce cytokine production in human macrophages [15] , and we confirmed this with MDDCs. The data is different from that soluble shed GP which can induce the secretion of cytokines. Shed GP is a trimer, but GP1-Fc is a monomer in our study (S1 Fig). Therefore, the different structures of soluble shed GP and GP1 maybe cause their varied ability of activating DCs. In addition, sera Lectins especially MBL in FBS used in our stimulation systems might also interfere GP binding DCs since MBL present in human sera is capable of affecting the binding of shed GP to cells [13] .",

            "text": "Fatal EBOV infection in humans is associated with severe immune dysregulation and the hypersecretion of numerous proinflammatory cytokines. Recently, it has been demonstrated that trimeric shed GP released from virus-infected cells could activate non-infected DCs and macrophages, causing massive release of pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines [13] . In addition, Qiu et al. reported that ZMapp, a blend of three EBOV GP-specific mAbs, protected EBOV-infected nonhuman primates [38] . This protection occurred even when ZMapp administered 5 days after infection, a time at which the clinical signs of disease are apparent. However, the mechanisms by which protection is achieved are unclear [39] . Given that GP participates in the production of numerous proinflammatory cytokines, it is reasonable to speculate that ZMapp not only neutralizes EBOV infection but also inhibits the excessive cytokine storm by blocking the interaction between GP and its PRRs, such as TLR4 and LSECtin. Therefore, therapeutic strategies to inhibit the cytokine storm should be considered during treatment for Ebola infection, especially for the patients with obvious clinical symptoms. In this regard, treatment with anti-GP, anti-TLR4 and anti-LSECtin Abs could be used to reduce the inflammatory responses caused by shed GP and may be helpful to alleviate the septic shock-like syndrome observed with EBOV infection.",

We further investigated the expression of LSECtin on monocyte-derived DCs (MDDCs) by culturing monocytes in the presence of GM-CSF and IL-4 (S2B Fig). This treatment resulted in a strong up-regulation of LSECtin. In addition, this result was confirmed by PCR and Western blotting (S2C and S2D Fig). Ebola GP interacts with LSECtin stably expressed on Jurkat cell line. It was thus of interest to investigate whether GP could also bind LSECtin on human MDDCs. To address the issue, MDDCs were transfected with siRNA specific for LSECtin or with control siRNA for 48h (S3 Fig) and stained with GP1-Fc.",
