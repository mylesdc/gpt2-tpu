The results were correlated with structural properties like side chain volume, hydrophobicity, and secondary structure propensities of substituting residues. All 3CL pro prefer Gln at P1 position, Leu at P2 position, basic residues at P3 position, small hydrophobic residues at P4 position, and small residues at P1' and P2' positions. Despite 3CL pro from different groups of CoVs share many similarities in substrate specificities, differences in substrate specificities were observed at P4 positions, with IBV 3CL pro prefers P4-Pro and SARS-CoV 3CL pro prefers P4-Val. By combining the most favorable residues at P3 to P5 positions, we identified super-active substrate sequences 'VARLQQSGF' that can be cleaved efficiently by all 3CL pro with relative activity of 1.7 to 3.2, and 'VPRLQQSGF' that can be cleaved specifically by IBV 3CL pro with relative activity of 4.3.",

Sequence analysis suggests that these coronaviral strains can be classified into three main groups -alphacoronavirus (group 1), betacoronavirus (group 2), and gamacoronavirus (group 3) [12] . The sequence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), discovered in 2003, was found to be diverse from any existing groups of CoVs. The group 2 CoVs are then further divided into 2a and 2b subgroups, with the original group 2 CoVs assigned to group 2a and SARS-CoV to group 2b [13, 14] . Most of coronaviral strains are group 1 and 2a members. They include the four human coronaviruses (HCoVs) strains, NL63, 229E, OC43 and HKU1, that associate with up to 5% of total respiratory tract disease cases [15, 16] . The most infamous strain in group 3 is infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), which can cause lethal infections in birds [17, 18] .",

The cleavage process can be acted in cis and in trans [19] . This enzyme is a good drug target for anti-coronaviral infection, as inhibiting the autocleavage process can inhibit viral replication and reduce virus-induced cytopathic effects on host cells [20, 21, 22, 23] . A detailed knowledge of substrate specificity of 3CL pro is helpful in the rational design of inhibitors. Substrate specificity of SARS-CoV 3CL pro was extensively investigated after the outbreak of SARS in 2003. Fan et al. measured the protease activity against 34 single-substituted variants at P5 to P1' positions, while Goetz et al. profiled the specificity at P4 to P1 positions by using a fully degenerated library of tetrapeptide mixtures [24, 25] .

The values of k obs /[3CL pro ] of the proteases against this WT sequence were 443611, 124613, 18065 and 174619 mM -1 min -1 for HCoV-NL63 (group 1), HCoV-OC43 (group 2a), SARS-CoV (group 2b), and IBV (group 3), respectively. That all proteases can cleave the WT sequence efficiently justifies that we can use our substrate library to profile the substrate specificities of 3CL pro from other groups of CoVs. Based on the FRET assay we developed, we measured the activities of 3CL pro from HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, SARS-CoV and IBV against the 1968 substrate variants ( Figure 1 , Table  S1 ) [26] . To identify the structural basis of substrate preferences for different CoVs, the protease activities were correlated with side chain volume [28] , hydrophobicity [29] , and a-helix and b-sheet propensities [30] as described [26] . The correlations were quantified in terms of correlation coefficients and p-values ( Figure 2 , Table S2 ).",

Interestingly, our results showed that 3CL pro from all groups of CoVs can cleave His at P1 position reasonably well. The relative activities for 3CL pro from HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, SARS-CoV, and IBV were 0.2660.08, 0.4760.08, 0.1960.03 and 0.2560.12, respectively (Table S1 ). Consistent with this observation, His is found natively at P1 positions in the polyproteins from group 1 and 2a CoVs (Table S3) . Taken together, the ability to cleave His at P1 position is a conserved property for all 3CL pro .

Considering that Leu, Val and Ile share similar hydrophobicity and side chain volume, the large differences in activities suggest that b-branched residues are not preferred in all 3CL pro , probably due to steric clashes with the P2 binding pocket.

We showed that the substrate specificities of these 3CL pro share many similarities to those of 3CL pro from SARS-CoV (group 2b) reported previously by us [26] . Table 2 summarizes the substrate specificities that are common to all 3CL pro . Although the substrate specificities for 3CL pro from different groups of CoVs share a number of similarities, unique substrate preferences were identified in this study. In particular, we showed that only IBV 3CL pro , but not other proteases, prefers P4-Pro (Figure 3 ). To understand the structural basis of this unique substrate preference, we compared the structures of IBV 3CL pro with other coronaviral 3CL pro . We noticed that strand-11 of IBV 3CL pro is positioned further away from the P4 and P5 substrate-binding site compared to other 3CL pro (Figure 4) [31, 32, 33] . This results in a wider substrate-binding pocket in IBV 3CL pro . We further docked the substrate variant A4P into the substrate-binding pocket of IBV 3CL pro . Due to the cyclic structure of Pro residue, the backbone \u00d8 dihedral angle of the P4 residue is restrained to ca. 260u, which causes the substrate peptide to bend towards the strand-11 of 3CL pro . Such conformation of substrate is much better accommodated by IBV 3CL pro , which has a wider substrate-binding pocket near the P4 and P5 positions. This observation justifies why only IBV 3CL pro cleaves P4-Pro efficiently.",

A broadspectrum inhibitor is desirable for a first line defense against coronaviral infection because CoVs are capable of generating novel strains with high virulence through high frequency of mutations and recombination [34, 35, 36, 37] .. Based on the autocleavage sequence of SARS-CoV 3CL pro (i.e. AVLQQ), Rao and co-workers designed broad-spectrum peptidomimetic inhibitors that can inhibit 3CL pro from different groups of CoVs [20] . Their results are consistent with our observation that the autocleavage sequence of SARS-CoV 3CL pro can be well cleaved by all 3CL pro . The substrate preferences profiled in this study will provide a rational basis to improve the broad-spectrum 3CL pro inhibitors. For example, by combining favorable substitutions at P3 to P5 positions, we identified a substrate sequence 'VARLQQSGF' that can be cleaved with high relative activities by 3CL pro from all groups of CoVs (Table 1 ). This substrate sequence may serve as a good starting point of the design of broadspectrum peptidomimetic inhibitors for 3CL pro .",
