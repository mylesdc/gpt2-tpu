These rates were adjusted for each of the remaining 8 provinces based on their prevalence of risk factors for pneumonia and healthcare-seeking behavior. We estimated non-hospitalized influenza-associated SARI from healthcare utilization surveys at two sites and used the percent of SARI cases positive for influenza from sentinel surveillance to derive the influenza-associated SARI rate. We applied rates of hospitalized and non-hospitalized influenza-associated SARI to census data to calculate the national number of cases. The percent of SARI cases that tested positive for influenza ranged from 7-17% depending on age group, year, province and HIV status. In 2010, there were an estimated 21,555 total severe influenza cases in HIV-uninfected individuals and 13,876 in HIV-infected individuals. In 2011, there were an estimated 29,892 total severe influenza cases in HIV-uninfected individuals and 17,289 in HIV-infected individuals. The incidence of influenza-associated SARI was highest in children <5 years and was higher in HIV-infected than HIV-uninfected persons in all age groups. Influenza virus PLOS ONE |",

These include environmental risk factors, such as crowded living conditions and exposure to indoor air pollution, as well as biological risk factors, such as malnutrition and underlying infections [5] [6] [7] . These risk factors may drive the burden of influenza in South Africa to be greater than other countries with similar income level [3, 8, 9] .

Non-hospitalized SARI includes cases from the population that do not reach the hospital due to health care access barriers. This method was previously used in Kenya and Guatemala but was modified to include stratification by HIV serostatus to reflect the impact of HIV on influenza burden in South Africa [2] . [19, 20] . Sentinel surveillance is conducted in four out of the nine South African provinces (Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal, Mpumalanga and North West). Hospitalized children aged <5 years are enrolled in surveillance with physician-diagnosed lower respiratory tract infection, and individuals 5 years are enrolled if they meet a modified WHO case definition for SARI (sudden onset of fever with cough or sore throat and shortness of breath or difficulty breathing with 7 days from presentation to the hospital) [21] . Population-based surveillance is implemented at the Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospital (CHBAH) in Gauteng Province. CHBAH is a large public academic hospital in the Soweto Township in Gauteng, South Africa. It serves approximately 1.4 million lower income South African individuals [12] .",

Briefly, between 4,000 and 6,000 community members were surveyed in each of the two sites as part of a cross-sectional door-to-door household survey and asked if they had a severe pneumonia in the past year (as defined as fever and cough and difficult breathing for 2-30 days or a physician diagnosis of pneumonia) and whether they were admitted to a hospital for the event. The ratio of those that sought care to those that did not was applied to the rate of hospitalized SARI to get the rate of non-hospitalized SARI in the base province [2] .",

Estimates of hospitalized SARI rates for the other eight provinces in South Africa were derived by adjusting the Soweto (Gauteng Province) SARI incidence rates for the provincial-level prevalence of known risk factors for pneumonia (from the South Africa Demographic and Health Survey and the ASSA model). Risk factors included exposure to indoor air pollution, crowding, malnutrition, low birth-weight and non-exclusive breastfeeding; the last three were only included as risk factors for children under five years of age [2, 8] . The relative risks of SARI associated with each risk factor were determined from the published literature [8] . In addition, we adjusted the provincial rates by the proportion of ARI seeking care in the given province to the proportion of ARI cases seeking care in the base province (Gauteng Province) using Health and Demographic Surveys (DHS) [4] . An upward adjustment factor (greater than one) resulted in a greater incidence of SARI in the province relative to Soweto (Gauteng Province). Similarly, a downward adjustment factor (less than one) resulted in a decrease in SARI incidence in the province relative to Soweto (Gauteng Province). The equations used for the Provincial adjustment are provided in the technical S1 Appendix.",

In 2009, the total number of hospitalized and non-hospitalized influenza-associated SARI cases was estimated to be 47,711 in HIV-uninfected individuals and 17,993 in HIV-infected individuals ( Table 2 ). In 2010 and 2011, there were fewer overall estimated influenza-associated SARI cases compared to 2009. In 2010, there were an estimated 21,555 total severe influenza cases in HIV-uninfected individuals and 13,876 in HIV-infected individuals ( Table 2 ). In 2011, there were an estimated 29,892 total severe influenza cases in HIV-uninfected individuals and 17,289 in HIV-infected individuals ( Table 2) . In our alternate method in which HIV was adjusted for as a risk factor rather than a stratifying variable, the greatest impact on the adjustment factors was for the 25-44 year old age group where the HIV prevalence is highest. The Eastern Cape Province still consistently had the largest downward adjustment factor, except in the 25-44 year old age group where Limpopo had the largest downward adjustment. However, KwaZulu-Natal Province consistently had the largest upward adjustment factor across all age groups, due to the high HIV prevalence in that province. The results from method 2 yielded similar incidence of influenza-associated SARI and number of hospitalized cases across the age groups and years included in the analysis (S3 Table) . The non-stratified alternate method estimated a total of 74,558 cases of hospitalized influenza-associated SARI for 2009-2011, only 6% more than the 70,607 cases estimated by the stratified model for the same years.",

Previous studies of influenza in South Africa have not calculated a national burden [25] [26] [27] [28] and have not estimated the non-hospitalized SARI burden. Our methodology allowed estimation of the number of cases in each province by age group and HIV serostatus, which can support decisions on targeted interventions within the confines of limited resources.",

            "text": "Our study highlights the important role that HIV infection plays when estimating severe influenza burden in settings with high HIV prevalence. Among the age group with the highest HIV prevalence (25) (26) (27) (28) (29) (30) (31) (32) (33) (34) (35) (36) (37) (38) (39) (40) (41) (42) (43) (44) year olds), HIV-infected persons accounted for 80% of the national burden of influenza-associated SARI, despite representing only 30% of the national population [29] . HIV-specific incidences for influenza-associated disease in South Africa have been reported previously to be high in HIV-infected individuals [11, 12] . A study in children 2-60 months of age in 1997 reported influenza-associated severe lower respiratory tract infection incidence rates of 1,268 and 148 per 100,000 for HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected children, respectively [11] . More recently, an analysis of population-based data from CHBAH found influenza-associated lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) to be highest in the HIV-infected population [12] . Some countries may not be able to calculate HIV-specific influenza incidence rates due to lack of reliable HIV-stratified influenza data in the population. In the non-HIV-stratified alternate method, we derived similar estimates of burden using a model incorporating adjustment for HIV prevalence by province. This suggests that HIV-specific influenza incidence rates are not necessary to derive valid overall burden estimates because HIV prevalence by province is available in most African countries through Demographic and Health Surveys or Multicluster Indicator Surveys [4] . There were several limitations to our methodology. Our study relies on extrapolating incidence rates from one surveillance site in one province to the rest of the provinces of South Africa. Although a high percentage of the base province is under surveillance from this one large surveillance site and we adjusted this incidence based on province-level risk factor for SARI, there are likely additional unmeasured factors that can lead to variation in rates regionally. We assumed that the relative risk of SARI for the different risk factors determined for the populations in the literature are the same relative risks for the population of South Africa, which might not be the case [8, 23, 24] . Second, the denominator estimates also might have been inaccurate. We used the ASSA 2008 population model to estimate the population and HIV prevalence by province and age group. These population estimates are extrapolations from the 2001 census. Third, the healthcare utilization surveys used to calculate non-hospitalized cases was undertaken in only two sites in two provinces. Moreover, the surveys did not stratify health-seeking by HIV status or age, which is likely to influence health-seeking behavior. Fourth, these estimates reflect the dsease burden in the public sector; however, a similar study using a different modelling approach in the private health sector of South Africa found similar incidence rates of influenza-associated respiratory hospitalizations [30] . Lastly, we assume that the percent of influenza-associated SARI is the same across all age groups, provinces and HIV status.",

Other countries that have influenza surveillance in place can also implement this methodology to estimate their national burden of severe influenza disease. We found that provinces in South Africa vary in the prevalence of important risk factors for SARI and influenza and that these impact the burden of severe disease. Current recommendations in South Africa include the vaccination of HIV-infected individuals with the seasonal influenza vaccine; however, the vaccine tends to be under-utilized in this population and in South Africa in general [31] . The results of this rapid assessment can be used to focus efforts targeting influenza vaccination by demonstrating the distribution of disease across South Africa.",
