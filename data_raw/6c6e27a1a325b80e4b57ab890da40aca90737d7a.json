            "text": "This study investigates the effects of five decontamination methods on the filter quality (q f ) of three commercially available electret masks-N95, Gauze and Spunlace nonwoven masks. Newly developed evaluation methods, the overall filter quality (q f,o ) and the q f ratio were applied to evaluate the effectiveness of decontamination methods for respirators. A scanning mobility particle sizer is utilized to measure the concentration of polydispersed particles with diameter 14.6-594 nm. The penetration of particles and pressure drop (\u0394p) through the mask are used to determine q f and q f,o . Experimental results reveal that the most penetrating particle size (MPS) for the pre-decontaminated N95, Gauze and Spunlace masks were 118 nm, 461 nm and 279 nm, respectively, and the respective penetration rates were 2.6%, 23.2% and 70.0%. The \u0394p through the pretreated N95 masks was 9.2 mm H 2 O at the breathing flow rate of heavy-duty workers, exceeding the \u0394p values obtained through Gauze and Spunlace masks. Decontamination increased the sizes of the most penetrating particles, changing the q f values of all of the masks: q f fell as particle size increased because the penetration increased. Bleach increased the \u0394p of N95, but destroyed the Gauze mask. However, the use of an autoclave reduces the \u0394p values of both the N95 and the Gauze mask. Neither the rice cooker nor ethanol altered the \u0394p of the Gauze mask. Chemical decontamination methods reduced the q f,o values for the three electret masks. The value of q f,o for PM 0.1 exceeded that for PM 0.1-0.6 , because particles smaller than 100 nm had lower penetration, resulting in a better q f for a given pressure drop. The values of q f,o , particularly for PM 0.1 , reveal that for the tested treatments and masks, physical decontamination methods are less destructive to the filter than chemical methods. Nevertheless, when purchasing new or reusing FFRs, penetration should be regarded as the priority.",

            "text": "The supply of masks may not meet demand during outbreaks or pandemics of diseases that are spread by human-to-human transmission through infectious bioaerosols. Therefore, some health authorities have considered reusing masks after decontamination to remove any infectious material. Most health authorities do not recommend the reuse of masks, but several users have attempted to use various simple methods to reclaim them to protect against noninfectious ambient particulate matter (PM)-particularly PM 2.5 , PM 1 or PM 0.1 . NIOSH published a series of research articles on mask decontamination [7] [8] [9] . The filtering effectiveness of reclaimed filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) and masks varies among brands and decontamination methods, so relevant results are applicable only to FFRs treated under the same conditions. Therefore, further tests must be performed to evaluate the filtration performance of filters before and after reclamation. This investigation applied three types of disposable mask, N95 FFRs (Dust Respirator 8210; 3M, St. Paul, MN, N95), gauze double-layer electret masks (Gauze, commercialized type, China) and spunlace nonwoven masks (Spunlace, Oimo, Taiwan), all of which are frequently used, and which can be reused when hospitals in Taiwan have insufficient masks for frontline healthcare workers [4] .",

The most frequently performed tests on filtration performance involve a polydispersed aerosol and evaluation of the most penetrating particle size (MPS) [10] . NaCl and dioctyl phthalate (DOP) are adopted as challenge aerosols with count median diameters (CMD) of 75 nm\u00b120 nm and 185 nm\u00b120 nm, and geometric standard deviations (GSD) of 1.86 and 1.6, respectively. ISO published test conditions include a numerical median particle size distribution (PSD) of between 60 nm and 100 nm, and electromobility diameters of 160nm and 210 nm for NaCl and liquid paraffin oil, respectively [11] . Both ISO conditions involve a polydispersed aerosol with a GSD of between 1.4 and 1.8. Calculations of penetration based on the published NIOSH and ISO criteria involve the penetration of particles of all sizes, instead of the penetration of particles of any specific size. The MPSs of various FFRs are not always within the standard range of CMD. Huang et al. observed that the MPS in electret filter media varies with face velocity, fiber diameter, packing density, filter thickness and charge density [12] . Current measurement methods can provide an accurate range of penetrating PSDs [13] , and elucidate the penetration and filter quality for particles covering a wide range of particle sizes.",

All of these methods are frequently adopted in hospitals in Taiwan. In the particulate penetration test, particles were formed using a constant-output atomizer (Model 3075, TSI Inc., St. Paul, MN) to atomize potassium sodium tartrate tetrahydrate (PST) solutions into polydispersed droplets [16] . The droplets were passed through a neutralizer that contained the radiation source Kr-85 (Model 3077, TSI Inc., St. Paul, MN), which neutralized them to the Boltzmann equilibrium state. Finally, the neutralized aerosols were passed into a test chamber, and diluted in filtered air. The overall quality factor was calculated over a wide range of sizes from 14.6nm to 594 nm which include viral particle size range. To obtain this size range, a challenge aerosol size distribution was utilized with a CMD of 101 nm \u00b110 nm, and a GSD of 2.01\u00b10.08. ",

Thus, masks of all three types exhibited a linear relationship between pressure drop and flowrate following the application of each of the decontamination methods. Immersion in bleach increased the pressure drop through the N95 mask (to 40 mm H 2 O at a flowrate of 10 L min \u22121 ), whereas use of the autoclave reduced it. Similar results were obtained in the tests on the Gauze masks except when bleach was used, because bleach destroyed all of the masks. Decontamination typically increased \u0394p, but treatment in the autoclave did not do so for the N95 or Gauze masks. The low pressure drop results for these two types of masks were observed to be associated with folds of the inner and outer filter supports. These folds may reduce the uniformity of filter density, causing the air to flow through loose filter material in the mask, and reducing the resistance of the filter. From the observation, as show in Fig 10, the outer layer of the masks were deformed, shrunken and stiff and these phenomena were similar to a previous study [8] . But no remarkable mottle was observed. However, the characteristics of various filters are not easily obtained as this information is commercially sensitive, and this fact imposed a limitation on this study. Filter quality of electret masks in filtering aerosol particles after decontamination Moreover, in the study, the calculated inspiratory breathing resistance (IBR) at 85 L min -1 [23] was 6.5, 2.6 and 0.9 mm H 2 O/L/sec for the pretreated N95, Gauze and Spunlace masks, respectively.

However, q f incorporates two variables, namely aerosol penetration and pressure drop. The minimum filtering efficiency (!95% for N95, for example) should be considered before obtaining q f . Figs 11(D)-11(F) present the calculated ratios of q f values before and after decontamination. Most of the q f ratios of the N95 masks were less than 1.0, except when treatment involved the autoclave or ethanol (Fig 11(D) ). The pressure drop (Fig 9(A) ), which is the denominator in q f , decreased when decontaminating N95 masks using the autoclave. Decontaminating N95 masks using ethanol did not affect the penetration of particles with diameters of less than 33.4 nm (Fig 6) , and yielded a q f ratio of close to unity. Under the Boltzmann charge equilibrium, approximately 60% of particles with diameters of less than 50 nm were uncharged [15] .",

In current study, only the tested N95 masks matched the minimum 42 CFR Part 84 criteria [10] because they had both an acceptable pressure drop and penetration. In 2011, Viscusi et al.

Consequently, buyers of FFRs or masks must consider both the penetration and the pressure drop. A good respirator should have a low aerosol penetration as the most important characteristic. Since the breathing resistance of N95 is 9.2 mm H 2 O at 5.95 L min \u22121 , the wearer may not notice a difference in pressure drop after decontamination. Therefore, for N95 respirators with a pressure drop below a 35 mm H 2 O threshold, the aerosol penetration must be kept below 5% consistent with 42 CFR 84 subpart K [10] . Moreover, it should be noted that the calculation of q f and q f,o provides more weight on pressure drop for comparing respirator after decontamination, therefore, q f and q f,o should be used carefully.",
