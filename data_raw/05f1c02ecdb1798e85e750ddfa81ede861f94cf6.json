ZIKV Natal RGN strain, an Asian-lineage virus, has been identified in brain tissues from fetal autopsy cases with microcephaly and is suggested to be a neurotropic variant. However, ZIKV Natal RGN strain has not been isolated; its biological features are not yet illustrated. This study rescued and characterized recombinant, single-round infectious particles (SRIPs) of the ZIKV Natal RGN strain using reverse genetic and synthetic biology techniques. The DNA-launched replicon of ZIKV Natal RGN was constructed and contains the EGFP reporter, lacks prM-E genes, and replicates under CMV promoter control. The peak in the ZIKV Natal RGN SRIP titer reached 6.25 \u00d7 10 6 TCID50/mL in the supernatant of prM-E-expressing packaging cells 72 h post-transfection with a ZIKV Natal RGN replicon. The infectivity of ZIKV Natal RGN SRIPs has been demonstrated to correlate with the green florescence intensity of the EGFP reporter, the SRIP-induced cytopathic effect, and ZIKV's non-structural protein expression. Moreover, ZIKV Natal RGN SRIPs effectively self-replicated in rhabdomyosarcoma/muscle, glioblastoma/astrocytoma, and retinal pigmented epithelial cells, displaying unique cell susceptibility with differential attachment activity. Therefore, the recombinant ZIKV Natal RGN strain was rescued as SRIPs that could be used to elucidate the biological features of a neurotropic strain regarding cell tropism and pathogenic components, apply for antiviral agent screening, and develop vaccine candidates.",

(Ontario, Canada). The construction of synthesized DNA fragments, plasmid information, and restriction enzyme digestion analysis of the DNA fragments we purchased are shown in Supplementary Figures S1 and S2 and Figure 1A . To construct the ZIKV Natal RGN replicon, the plasmid pBR322-Linker, described in our prior report [15] , was chosen as the vector to assemble fragments A, B, C, and D of the CMVp-driven ZIKV Natal RGN replicon with the EGFP reporter via the cloning sites of EcoRI, NotI, ClaI, RsrII, and XhoI ( Figure 1B ). Fragments A, C, and D were generated using the Platinum \u00ae PCR Supermix High Fidelity reaction with the DNA segments we synthesized, I and II, as the templates (Life Technology, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Fragment B was produced through two-round PCR with the Gibson Assembly reaction of two first-round PCR products (B1 and B2) as the template (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA). The pairs containing the restriction enzyme site(s) indicated, are listed in Supplementary Table S1 . The resultant plasmid carrying the CMVp-driven ZIKV Natal RGN replicon with the EGFP reporter was propagated in E. coli DH5\u03b1 and then sequenced by Sanger sequencing assays with sequencing primers (Supplementary Table S2 ). The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence alignment analysis of the CMVp-driven ZIKV Natal RGN replicon and its parent strain (GenBank accession number KU527068) was performed using the Lasergene DNASTAR Megalign software.

Two synthetic DNA segments in the pUC18 plasmid contained the entire ZIKV Natal RGN strain genome: CMVp, EGFP, FMDV-2A, and BGH-pA sequences (A). Four PCR products (Fragments A-D) were cloned into the indicated restriction sites (EcoRI, NotI, ClaI, RsrII, and XhoI) of the pBR322 plasmid and then assembled as the in-frame fusion of the ZIKV Natal RGN replicon with the EGFP reporter under CMV-promoter control (B).

Subsequently, the packaging cells were transfected with the ZIKV Natal RGN replicon, and then CPE and the EGFP reporter expressions were examined ( Figure 2 ). In the packaging cells, EGFP reporter expression and CPE showed slight levels 24 h post-transfection, but exhibited significant changes 72 h after transfection with the ZIKV Natal RGN replicon (Figure 2 bottom) . Moreover, in vitro translation and transcription of the ZIKV Natal RGN replicon in packaging cells were further characterized ( Figure 3 ). Immunofluorescent staining indicated that the ZIKV E C-terminus, NS1, and NS5 proteins were massively expressed in replicon-transfected packaging cells ( Figure 3A bottom), but not in mock and packaging cells ( Figure  3A top and middle). The real-time, reverse transcription PCR assay showed large amounts of positive and negative-sense ZIKV subgenomes in replicon-transfected packaging cells 72 h post-transfection, but not in mock cells ( Figure 3B top and bottom) . The results demonstrated efficient translation and replication of the ZIKV subgenomes in the packaging cells using the DNA-launched ZIKV Natal RGN replicon. Figure 1 . Construction of the pBR322-based ZIKV Natal RGN replicon and pcDNA3.1-ZIKV prME. Two synthetic DNA segments in the pUC18 plasmid contained the entire ZIKV Natal RGN strain genome: CMVp, EGFP, FMDV-2A, and BGH-pA sequences (A). Four PCR products (Fragments A-D) were cloned into the indicated restriction sites (EcoRI, NotI, ClaI, RsrII, and XhoI) of the pBR322 plasmid and then assembled as the in-frame fusion of the ZIKV Natal RGN replicon with the EGFP reporter under CMV-promoter control (B). Those four PCR products were analyzed using agarose gel electrophoresis (C). The PCR product of ZKIV prM and E genes was cloned into restriction sites (EcoRI and XhoI) of the pcDNA3.1-His-C plasmid (D).",

Two synthetic DNA segments in the pUC18 plasmids comprised the entire ZIKV Natal RGN strain genome, CMVp, EGFP, FMDV-2A, and BGH-pA sequences (Supplementary Figures S1 and S2 and Figure 1A ,B). The synthetic DNA segments were used as templates via PCR to amplify the gene fragments (A-D) that were cloned into the low-copy-number plasmid pBR322 to construct a DNA-launched ZIKV Natal RGN replicon under the control of the CMV promoter ( Figure 1B,C) . Fragment A consisted of CMVp, ZIKV 5'-UTR, ZIKV C protein, the reporter EGFP, and FMDV-2A. Fragment B containing the 73-residue C-terminal region of ZIKV E protein, NS1, NS2A, NS2B, and the N-terminal region of NS3, was produced using Gibson Assembly cloning ( Figure 1C ). In order to join fragments B and C, the reverse primer for fragment B and the forward primer for fragment C contained the restriction enzyme site ClaI (Supplementary Table S1 ), which is recognized as the marker nt5156 ATCGAT 5161 of the replicon in which thymidine at nucleotide 5156 of the ZIKV Natal RGN genome was exchanged with adenosine, but it caused a silent mutation ( Figure 1B) . Interestingly, the RsrII restriction site within the NS4B gene ( nt7473 CGGACCG 7479 ) of the ZIKV Natal RGN genome was a unique restriction site for ligation between fragments C and D. In addition, HDVr was fused with the 3'-UTR of ZIKV in the replicon to verify the accuracy of the 3'-end of the transcribed ZIKV Natal RGN RNA genomes ( Figure 1B,C) . Furthermore, sequencing analysis of the ZIKV Natal RGN replicon indicated that only two amino acid substitutions appeared within the NS5 protein (L3277R and E3280N) (Supplementary Figure S3) . Therefore, the DNA-launched ZIKV Natal RGN replicon was effectively constructed to generate the in-frame fusion of ZIKV C protein, reporter EGFP, FMDV-2A, the 73-residue C-terminal region of ZIKV E protein, and all non-structural ZIKV proteins under the control of the CMV promoter.",

The viral yield of ZIKV Natal RGN SRIPs in prM-E-expressing packaging cells transfected with the ZIKV replicon was 6.25 \u00d7 10 6 TCID50/mL (Figure 4) , which indicated the replication capacity of the CMV promoter-launched ZIKV Natal RGN replicon. In addition, a green fluorescence reporter, EGFP, encoded within the ZIKV Natal RGN replicon, represented an observable marker to examine replication of the ZIKV Natal RGN replicon and SRIPs (Figures 2,3, and 5 ). In our laboratory, the pBR322 plasmid has been used to construct a JEV replicon that is genetically stable in E. coli [15] . The JEV genome sequence encoding for structural proteins (C, prM/M, and E) was toxic in E. coli, which resulted in genetic instability of the JEV infectious clones and replicons [15] . Similarly, construction of ZIKV Natal RGN infectious clones was not accomplished due to the genetic instability of ZIKV Natal RGN infectious clones, particularly within the NS1 gene region (Supplementary Figures S1 and S2) . However, the recombinant pcDNA3.1 plasmid containing prM and E genes and the pBR322 plasmid containing 5' and 3'-UTRs, C, and all NS genes, showed genetic stability. Two ZIKV infectious clones obtained by cloning the entire fulllength native cDNA have been reported [20, 21] , and other ZIKV infectious clones were reported using strategies to avoid the toxicity of the ZIKV genome sequence, including in vitro assembly of viral cDNA fragments and insertion of eukaryotic introns [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] . Particularly, the ZIKV Natal RGN infectious clone was produced using bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) [27] , in which a singlecopy pBeloBAC11 plasmid containing the full-length genome of the ZIKV Natal RGN strain under the CMV promoter control was used to maintain ZIKV genome stability and reduce toxicity in bacteria.

Interestingly, TE671 cells expressing JEV C, prM, and E proteins were also used as a packaging cell line that was efficient at producing JEV SRIPs post-transfection with the JEV replicon [15] . The recombinant ZIKV Natal RGN SRIPs showed infectivity and self-replication in the packaging cells ( Figure 5 ). Two amino acid substitutions within NS5 (L3277R and E3280N) (Supplementary Figure S3) seemed to have no influence on the activities of NS5 methyltransferase and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. A recent study indicated that human embryonic kidney 293T cells had been used to establish different flavivirus prM-E-expressing packaging cells, including DENV1-4, ZIKV, JEV, West Nile virus, yellow fever virus, and tick-borne encephalitis virus, and the cells were transfected with the DENV1 reporter replicon to generate a chimeric flavivirus SRIP-based neutralization assay [28] . Therefore, recombinant ZIKV Natal RGN SRIPs generated in this study could be used to analyze the ZIKV life cycle, elucidate viral pathogenesis, screen antiviral agents, design faster and safer diagnostic tools, and even develop attenuated vaccines against ZIKV infection.",

In this study, recombinant ZIKV Natal RGN SRIPs were rescued using reverse genetic and synthetic biology techniques (Figures 1-5 and Supplementary  Figures S1-S3) . Three cell lines, TE671, SF268, and ARPE-19, were further tested for cell susceptibility to ZIKV Natal RGN SRIPs ( Figure 6 ). The order of cell susceptibility to ZIKV Natal RGN SRIPs was TE671 > ARPE-19 > SF268 cells. The CPE level, EGFP reporter intensity, and ZIKV NS1 protein expression were most obvious (>50% involvement) in TE671 cells, but were mild in ARPE-19 cells and limited in SF268 cells 72 h post-infection with SRIPs at an MOI of 0.15 TCID50/cell. The results indicated that ZIKV Natal RGN SRIPs had a broad range of human tissue tropism with differential cell susceptibilities ( Figure 6A ). In addition, ZIKV Natal RGN SRIPs had the highest attachment activity to TE671 cells among those three cell lines ( Figure 6B ). SRIP attachment to TE671 cells was suggested to be involved in the infectivity of ZIKV Natal RGN in TE671 cells. This finding implied that ZIKV Natal RGN SRIPs had tropism for rhabdomyosarcoma/muscle and retinal pigmented epithelial cells, which was consistent with myalgia, arthralgia, retinitis, chorioretinal atrophy, and pigmentary maculopathy in symptomatic ZIKV infection [29, 30] . Therefore, the cell line susceptibility results revealed the unique features of ZIKV Natal RGN SRIPs and suggested the possible pathogenesis of ZIKV infection.",

ZIKV Natal RGN SRIPs were rescued by the combination of prM-E-expressing packaging cells and the ZIKV Natal RGN replicon under CMV promoter control, which mimicked self-replicating, positive-sense, single strand RNA viruses. The biological features of ZIKV Natal RGN SRIPs were revealed, including CPE, infectivity, cell susceptibility, and attachment activity. Therefore, recombinant ZIKV Natal RGN SRIPs could be further used to investigate cell tropism, persistent infection, and vaccine candidates, and to establish reliable, effective, and efficient assays for screening antiviral agents and diagnosing viral infections.

Subsequently, the packaging cells were transfected with the ZIKV Natal RGN replicon, and then CPE and the EGFP reporter expressions were examined(Figure 2). In the packaging cells, EGFP reporter expression and CPE showed slight levels 24 h post-transfection, but exhibited significant changes 72 h after transfection with the ZIKV Natal RGN replicon(Figure 2 bottom). Moreover, in vitro translation and transcription of the ZIKV Natal RGN replicon in packaging cells were further characterized(Figure 3). Immunofluorescent staining indicated that the ZIKV E C-terminus, NS1, and NS5 proteins were massively expressed in transfected packaging cells (Figure 3A bottom), but not in mock and packaging cells (Figure 3Atop and middle). The real-time, reverse transcription PCR assay showed large amounts of positive and negative-sense ZIKV subgenomes in replicon-transfected packaging cells 72 h post-transfection, but not in mock cells (Figure 3B top and bottom). The results demonstrated efficient translation and replication of the ZIKV subgenomes in the packaging cells using the DNA-launched ZIKV Natal RGN replicon.Viruses 2019, 11,",
