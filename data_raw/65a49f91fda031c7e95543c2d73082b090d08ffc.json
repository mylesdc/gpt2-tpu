            "text": "The gammacoronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) causes an acute, highly contagious respiratory disease of poultry. Live attenuated vaccines are traditionally generated by serial passage of a virulent strain in embryonated chicken eggs; however, the molecular mechanism of attenuation is unknown. M41-CK, a virulent lab-adapted strain of IBV, was egg passaged over 100 times in four parallel independent replicates. All four final egg-passaged viruses were attenuated in vivo and exhibited similar growth phenotypes in adult chicken kidney cells and ex vivo tracheal organ cultures. The virus populations were sequenced by 454 pyrosequencing at the end of passaging, and the results showed that overall sequence diversity in the IBV population increased but the four replicates only had between 11 and 17 consensus-level single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Although hot spots of variation were identified in spike and nucleocapsid structural proteins as well as the 3= untranslated region, each attenuated virus possessed a different pattern of genomic variation. Overall, only a small number of consensus-level SNPs were acquired during egg passage, leaving a potentially short route back to virulence. These results highlight the unpredictable nature of attenuation by serial egg passage and the need to develop mechanisms to rationally attenuate IBV for the next generation of effective vaccines. IMPORTANCE Infectious bronchitis remains a major problem in the global poultry industry, despite the existence of many different vaccines. IBV vaccines are currently developed by serial passage of a virulent strain on embryonated hen's eggs until attenuation; however, little is known about the evolution of the viral population during the process of attenuation. High-throughput sequencing of four replicates of a serially egg-passaged IBV revealed a different pattern of genomic variation in each attenuated replicate and few consensus-level SNPs. This raises concerns that only a small number of genomic mutations are required to revert to a virulent phenotype, which may result in vaccine breakdown in the field. The observed hot spots of variation in the attenuated viruses have the potential to be used in the rational attenuation of virulent IBV for next-generation vaccine design.",

            "text": "The etiological agent of IB is infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), a gammacoronavirus belonging to the Nidovirales order, Coronaviridae family, species Avian coronavirus. The positive-sense single-stranded RNA viral genome is typically 27 to 28 kb and encodes the spike, envelope (E), membrane (M), nucleocapsid (N), and structural proteins and accessory proteins 3a, 3b, 4b, 5a, and 5b in the 3= end of the genome. A large replicase gene is located at the 5= end of the genome, which expresses two polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab. The two polyproteins are cleaved by virus-encoded proteases, resulting in 15 nonstructural proteins (nsps); nsp2 to nsp11 are encoded by pp1a, and nsp2 to nsp10 and nsp12 to nsp16 are encoded by pp1ab, the latter produced as the result of a \u03ea1 ribosomal frameshifting mechanism. Untranslated regions (UTR) are located at the 5= and 3= ends of the genome. Unusually for an RNA virus, nsp14 exhibits 3=-to-5= exoribonuclease activity (5) which, in conjunction with nsp12, an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), forms part of a proofreading system that facilitates a high-fidelity replication of both genomic and subgenomic RNAs. The extent to which the proofreading capability of IBV impacts genetic variability, and the role of genetic diversity within an IB viral population, remains undefined despite having a discernible in vivo effect (6) .",

Alternatively, it is possible that given the highly diverse genetic structure of RNA virus population, the so-called \"viral swarm,\" low-frequency attenuated viruses could preexist within a virulent population, with the process of egg passaging driving selection of such attenuated genotypes. Additionally, recombination reported in the field will likely have a role in the evolution of IBV (15, 16) .

This capability for an intermediate frequency variant to exist within an attenuated population would suggest an intrinsic ability to retain a virulent genotype at a given position.",

Due to the nature of serial passaging, it is possible that some observed variation occurred after the point at which these viruses would be deemed attenuated and suitable for vaccine use. Current strategies for characterizing the pathogenicity of IBV isolates largely rely on in vivo studies, as limited overlap is observed between in vitro and in vivo characteristics. Without a suitable alternative for assessing attenuation accurately, in vivo characterization remains the only representative means of assessing loss of pathogenicity. Given the number of samples involved here, it would not be ethical to perform pathogenicity experiments with each individual egg-passaged virus to establish the point at which our serial passages are deemed attenuated, as the harm would outweigh the benefit.",

Surprisingly few variants within our virulent population were detected, with fewer still shared between the virulent and attenuated populations. This would first indicate that de novo mutation, as opposed to the selection of preexisting attenuating mutations (within the virulent population), is the cause of attenuation in this instance. Due to the coverage profile of our data set, the detection of diversity across the entirety of the genome, particularly in replicase and spike proteins of lineages A and A1, is limited. A consequence is that all mutations occurring in multiple lineages may not have been fully identified and detection of diversity in A and A1 is not wholly representative as a result. To fully answer this question of selection versus mutation, sequencing of intermediate passaging at a higher depth of coverage provided by current high-throughput sequencers would be required to show the change in frequency of variants at a higher temporal resolution. Such cross-sectional analysis would provide insight as to how the viral population evolves over the course of passaging.",

From the same starting material, our data suggest that it is possible to differently attenuate four viruses with minimal overlap between these viruses. In addition, few of the SNPs identified in the attenuated viruses match the nucleotide found at these positions in commercial vaccine strains of the same serotype. This highlights that attenuation of IBV by serial egg passage results in different patterns of genomic variation each time. It is possible that the mutations identified here are linked by a means that have yet to be established. Regardless, the potential for industry to generate different vaccines against the same virulent strain with poor consistency is concerning. Moreover, the ability for potentially virulent subconsensus mutations to remain within an attenuated population demonstrates the risk of reverting to virulence and potentially has an evolutionary consequence when introduced into the field and in competition with other IBV strains. Regulations in place for market authorization in Europe do limit this risk. However, there is still an importance to move away from the process of attenuation by egg passage. Our findings would suggest a need for the genetic structure of live attenuated vaccine viruses generated by egg passaging to be fully characterized by deep sequenc-ing, not only for purposes of quality control but also to improve our understanding of the mechanism of attenuation. This information, coupled with a reverse genetics system, would allow for the development of rationally attenuated IBVs with high efficacy and safety.",

A consensus sequence was generated from this alignment where indel mutations were permitted and a minimum coverage of 10 reads was required for a nucleotide to be called (GenBank accession number MK728875). For positions where coverage was below this threshold, an ambiguity code, \"N,\" placed instead. This consensus sequence was annotated (Fig. 3A ) according to information available (33, 34) and UniProtKB accession number P0C6Y3 (35) , where regions of highly similar sequences were identified. The annotations of AY851295.1 available from NCBI were not used in this instance.",
