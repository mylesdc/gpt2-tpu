Water resources are perhaps most crucial, as humans and animals depend on safe water for health and survival, and sources of clean water are dwindling due to demands from agriculture and global climate change. As water becomes more scarce, animals and people are squeezed into smaller and smaller workable areas. Contact among infected animals and people then increases, facilitating disease transmission. Water scarcity also means that people and animals use the same water sources for drinking and bathing, which results in serious contamination of drinking water and increased risk of zoonotic diseases. In addition, poor sanitation and animal management can result in fecal contamination of both animal and human food. When this situation is complicated by high HIV/AIDS prevalence, the impacts of otherwise minimally virulent or difficult-to-transmit pathogens can be catastrophic to families and entire communities, and ultimately to the environment through impacts on human capacity, natural resource management, and land use [8] .",

Human population in sub-Saharan Africa doubled between 1975 and 2001 [9] , and the African Population and Health Research Center predicts another doubling from 2008 levels to 1.9 billion by 2050. Such rapid population growth and consequent demands for natural resources are making African wildlands increasingly vulnerable to conversion to other land uses, such as logging, agriculture, and pasturage. A recent analysis by Wittermyer et al. [10] found that average annual population growth rates were higher in buffers to protected areas than in rural areas in Africa and Latin America. Protected areas provide some of the last supplies of ecosystem goods and services for expanding human populations, including firewood, bush meat, clean water, medicinal plants, and areas of safety during civil strife. Their porous edges also provide refuge for the vectors of zoonotic disease transmission.",

In 2006, the Health for Animals and Livelihood Improvement (HALI; http:// haliproject.wordpress.com/) project was initiated to test the feasibility of the One Health approach in rural Tanzania and to find creative solutions to these problems by investigating the impact of zoonotic disease on the health and livelihoods of rural Tanzanians living in the water-limited Ruaha ecosystem. HALI, from the Swahili word for state of health, addresses these complex disease and natural resources issues on a platform that recognizes that the health of domestic animals, wildlife, and people is inextricably linked to the ecosystem and natural resources on which all depend [12] .",

This sprawling ecosystem is of extraordinary conservation significance and supports approximately 30,000 elephants (Loxodonta africana) and the continent's third largest population of critically endangered African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus) [13] . The socioeconomic importance of the Ruaha region rivals its biological significance, as virtually all communities depend entirely on the natural resource base, and agriculture accounts for about 80% of these livelihoods [14] . This importance is immediately apparent at the village level, where livestock are widespread, abundant, and central to traditional natural resource management. Unfortunately, livestock-dependent households are among the poorest in the nation [15] . This local poverty fuels the demand for illegal wildlife hunting for meat, another known driver for disease emergence [16] .",

Nearly 40,000 new cases of tuberculosis (human, bovine, or atypical strain) are diagnosed per year in Tanzania [20], with anywhere from 21% to 77% of Tanzanian tuberculosis patients also infected with HIV [21] . The extrapulmonary form of tuberculosis (EPTB) in people, often associated with BTB infection from animals, accounts for 20% of the reported cases in Tanzania [20] . Therefore, bovine tuberculosis became a focal disease for the HALI project due to its high livestock prevalence [22] , wildlife data paucity, and the large, susceptible HIVinfected human population living in close association with livestock and wildlife. Additional priorities for HALI were determined through gender-balanced interviews with affected communities, including village chair people; leaders of agricultural, water, and women's cooperatives; and heads and members of pastoralist households. An overwhelming consensus emerged from follow-up stakeholder meetings of diverse communities, including multiple levels of government (including public hospital physicians), nonprofit organizations, academic institutions, and citizens:",

In addition, Salmonella, Escherichia coli, Cryptosporidium, and Giardia spp. that can cause disease in humans and animals have been isolated from multiple water sources used by people and frequented by livestock and wildlife. These data are now being used to examine spatial and temporal associations between landscape factors and disease and to identify risk factors and health impacts that may be mitigated through policy changes and outreach. Preliminary findings also indicate that more than two-thirds of participating pastoral households do not believe that illness in their families can be contracted from livestock, and nearly half believe the same of wildlife. Furthermore, when the HALI project began working in this region, 75% of households did not consider sharing water sources with livestock or wildlife a health risk, illustrating the need for effective community education.",

Most people living in high risk areas are not aware of the danger or what can be done to reduce it. In addition, transmission can be exacerbated by common animal husbandry and food and water handling practices ( Figure 3 ) [23] . Therefore, data collection strategies should include the evaluation of spatial, temporal, and demographic patterns of pathogen prevalence and disease in human, domestic animal, and wildlife populations in likely hotspots for disease emergence. The underlying water-and land-use determinants of disease and the social, economic, and cultural barriers to control and prevention must be explored [24, 25] . While local stakeholders and international institutions actively involved in animal health, conservation, and livelihood assessment and improvement were quick to engage in HALI, physicians and public health experts (local and international) have been slower, likely due to competing demands on time and resources already dedicated to addressing malaria and tuberculosis of human origin [5] . Concerns over the financial escalation of projects directly measuring pathogens in humans was also an obstacle to engaging medical professionals for these neglected diseases.",

Water scarcity increases work stress, especially in women and children, and brings animals and people together more frequently, increasing the likelihood of water contamination and transmission of infectious diseases. Likewise, the manner in which water is used for agricultural and animal production affects worker health, food safety, and the health of those who drink and bathe in it. Improving water safety and security, including sanitation, in ecologically appropriate ways that reduce disease risk will require a transdisciplinary approach in which economists, ecologists, epidemiologists, and engineers play important roles with public and animal health practitioners.",

Effective surveillance, assessments, and interventions are possible only by bridging the organizational gaps among institutions studying and managing wildlife, livestock, water, and public health. It is clear that education in global health, especially emerging zoonotic diseases, is urgently needed at all levels from research institutions to pastoralist communities. Collecting detailed data regarding land use and agricultural practices, food consumption and water use habits, illness in animals and people, and access to health care will help appropriately tailor education efforts for priority diseases and pandemic prevention. The donor community should be encouraged to transcend disciplinary conventions and invest in holistic health projects that have the best chance of affecting change. ",
