To validate the best candidate genes, we performed quantitative RT-PCR on a subset of 10 genes (TRAP1, DECR1, FPGS, FARP1, MAPRE2, PEX16, GINS2, CRY2, CSNK1G2 and A4GALT), 4 commonly employed reference genes (GAPDH, ACTB, B2M and HMBS) and PPIB, previously reported to be stably expressed in blood.

Different transcript quantification methodologies exist, all of which rely on utilization of proper normalization techniques. Such analysis requires several variables need to be accounted for, including amount and quality of RNA, enzymatic efficiencies, and differences between tissues or cells in overall transcriptional activity. The current, most universally utilized normalization method for PCR and Northern blotting relies on the use of constitutively expressed endogenous reference genes, often termed ''house-keeping genes.'' It has been shown, however, that the expression of such reference genes can vary significantly between different tissues or conditions, thus making it impossible to use the same reference genes for various tissues [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . Moreover, the identification of appropriate control genes presents a circular problem, because in order to find suitable genes for normalization, prior knowledge of their stable gene expression is needed, which also relies on properly normalized data.",

The GeNorm tool was used to calculate the internal control genes stability measures (M) [6] . In short, input data was generated using the comparative Ct-method [26] , where relative expression levels were calculated by setting the lowest Ct value of a particular gene to 1, and the relative expression levels for the same gene in the rest of the samples were calculated. Then for every control gene, the pair-wise variation with all other control genes is estimated in GeNorm as the SD of the log-transformed expression ratios. The internal control gene stability measure M is defined as the average pair-wise variation of a particular control gene with all other control genes. Stepwise exclusion of the gene with the highest M value is performed. Because a pair of control genes is needed to calculate M, the two most stably expressed genes cannot be ranked any further. The optimal number of control genes for normalization is determined by calculating the pair-wise variation V n /V n+1 between each set of two sequential normalization factors [6] . Consistent with the Vandesompele recommendations, the minimum number of genes for which the V was smaller than 0.15, was used to define the optimal set of control genes for normalization. A normalization factor is calculated based on the geometric mean of the optimal set of control genes.",

In short, the Ct value of the normalizer was subtracted from the Ct value of each sample (\uf044Ct). Then the value of the calibrator was subtracted (\uf044\uf044Ct) and the linearized values were calculated (2 -(\uf044\uf044Ct) ).

Diagnosis and each PCR-plate were included as factors. CSNK1G2 showed significant differences in expression between MS and control samples ( Table 5 , p < 0.05). However, if multiple-comparison correction is applied to this p-value, it is not statistically significant. Expression of the remaining genes did not differ significantly between the matched pairs (Table 5) . No significant p-values (p \uf0a3 0.05) for plate, nor for the Diagnosis-versus-plate interaction were found, suggesting no significant technical bias in the study (data not shown). The fold-change of expression between the MS and the healthy controls for the stably expressed genes (Figure 4 , below the dotted line) was closest to 1.0 for FPGS (Table 5 ). ACTB and A4GALT foldchanges could not be estimated in Partek due to multiple missing values. The greatest deviation from the 1.0 ratio for all the genes was observed for CSNK1G2. We also used the \uf044\uf044Ct method [28] , as described in the Methods section, to calculate fold-change. B2M showed the smallest deviation from the 1.0 ratio for the most stably expressed genes (Table 5 ). TRAP1, identified by GeNorm as one of the most stably expressed genes, was used as the Normalizer; therefore, its ratio is not relevant. The highest deviation from the 1.0 ratio for all the genes was observed for CSNK1G2, as expected.",

They were not identified as stably expressed in our Affymetrix data because their expression was higher than our upper limit for selection. PPIB was also reported to be stably expressed in whole blood of patients with local and systemic inflammatory syndromes and healthy controls [3] . HMBS had a high SD based on our Affymetrix arrays on the 526 samples (SD of log-2-transformed values = 0.72). For comparison, the most stably expressed genes in the same intensity interval had a standard deviation (SD) of the log-2-transformed values around 0.2. HMBS, however, showed stable expression when using qRT-PCR in the MS versus healthy controls experiment. Closer inspection of the expression stability on the 526 samples from the Affymetrix chips showed that the HMBS SD of the log- 2-transformed values for most of the studies was around 0.5, but it was 0.94 for the stroke study. This result suggests that there were study-specific differences for stroke versus the other diseases, leading to its unstable expression. Our conclusion that HMBS was unstably expressed across our 526 samples is consistent with a previous study reporting that HMBS was unstably expressed in leukocytes [6] . Among the 10 candidate reference genes, TRAP1, DECR1, FPGS, and FARP1 showed the most stable expression.",

            "text": "We took advantage of the large amount of expression data on 33,000 genes from 526 individuals to select genes that had stable expression in whole blood. This gave us an added advantage to assess not only the gene expression of commonly used housekeeping genes but to perform a whole genome survey for stably expressed genes over multiple ages, disease conditions and different expression levels. Ranking based on the expression stability from qRT-PCR data of the candidate control genes and estimation of the minimum number of genes needed for nomalization showed that the fewest, most stably expressed genes needed for acurate normalization in RNA expression studies of human whole blood is a combination of TRAP1, FPGS, DECR1 and PPIB. These genes should be useful as normalization genes for a wide-range of whole blood expression studies in humans.",
