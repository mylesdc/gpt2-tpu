In particular, deep sequencing has been used to identify medically relevant drug-resistant rare variants that impact anti-retroviral drug treatment outcomes [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . Many of the earliest efforts have targeted specific hyper variable genomic regions using 454 sequencing; more recently published studies have begun to target more of the genome with high depths using the greater sequencing output of Illumina technologies [16, 17] . Recently, the software tool for managing deep sequencing data, Segminator II, was introduced and used to compare performance of Illumina and 454 deep sequencing of influenza [18] . However, less emphasis was given to evaluating a general subconsensus base calling procedure and the impact of PCR amplification was not considered. Two other available packages that address PCR errors and known sequencing error modes, AmpliconNoise [19] and RC454 [20] , are designed specifically for 454 pyrosequencing data. In a recent Illumina deep sequencing study of foot-and-mouth disease virus samples, Wright et al. [21] counted evidence for between 1,434 and 2,622 rare variants present in their samples. Their approach relied on an estimated error rate from the sequencer without the use of sequencing controls and included sequencing each sample twice to correct for sequencing error, which would present practical problems for sequencing larger numbers of samples collected from an outbreak. Moreover, recent work has indicated the presence of non-uniform error rates in Illumina sequence data in particular, and highlights the ongoing challenge of correctly separating the true mutant spectra from sequencing related errors [15, [22] [23] [24] .",

Given the potential for RNA viruses that circulate in a non-human host reservoir to infect new host types, including humans [25] , it is important to study viral evolution at the highest resolution for measuring genetic change. Characterizing these viruses pose a particular challenge since the starting material can be too small (or rare) to directly sequence without PCR amplification or growth in cell culture, which can introduce new errors to the measurement process [26] . As a pilot study for a series of viral evolution studies, three viral samples collected from naturally infected hosts--two fox rabies brain tissue samples and one bovine coronavirus (BCV) nasal sample-were sequenced using Illumina paired-end read technology at ultra-deep coverage (> 300,000x raw reads). Two plasmid clones containing 1 kb region of the rabies and BCV genomes served as error controls in the study. Error rates seen in plasmids provided a best estimate of the combined PCR and sequencing error rate for the natural samples [27] .",

Overlapping read pairs have not been previously applied to mutant spectra profiling to improve the sensitivity of variant detection. We demonstrate the novel use of mismatch rates in the overlapping read pairs (ORP) to provide an unbiased assessment of the sequencer-derived quality scores when selecting a read filtering threshold, as well as to estimate position-dependent sequencing errors without relying on a clonal control. Our methods identified a high variation in error rates between sequencers and indicated the difficulty of relying on traditional sequencing approaches for rare variant characterization. Moreover, we demonstrate that PCR amplification can become the dominant source of error over the sequencer's error even when using a high fidelity polymerase. Among the three natural viral samples we sequenced, we identified up to 2,133 rare variants within a single sample with an inhost population frequency as rare as 0.0096%. Given the majority of the variants we discovered occurred at the ultra-rare level (< 0.1%), we show that careful error control and estimation using ORP can reveal a deep and rich mutant spectrum. Our results demonstrate a practical sequencing and computational analytic approach to studying viral evolution with an unprecedented level of genetic resolution.",

First, they served as a mechanism of error checking, as each read pair came from the same template and should therefore be perfectly complementary. Base calls that do not match in the forward and reverse strands are automatically identified as sequencing errors. Second, although the mismatched bases were excluded from data analysis, they provided an empirical estimate for single-read sequencing error rates. Third, it identified \"problematic loci\" on the genome where large fractions of the ORPs are mismatched. A high fraction of ORP mismatches at a particular locus would indicate that the locus was a site with high probability of erroneous nucleotide incorporation and hence suggest that a more stringent criterion should be considered when making variant calls at the locus.",

The probability of a mismatched read pair occurring anywhere during the Illumina paired-end sequencing process was estimated from the ratio of number of mismatched ORPs over the total number of ORPs. These average ORP mismatch rates are shown in Table 2 . While mismatches occurred at the approximate rate of~7 per 1000 unfiltered base pairs; with Q30 filtering, the mismatch rate dropped three orders of magnitude to~4 per 1 million base pairs (averaged over 5 samples).

Q-scores of 10, 20, 30 and 35 correspond to error rates of 0.1, 0.01, 0.001, 0.0003, respectively. The mean mismatch rates among the raw, Q10, Q20, Q30 and Q35 ORPs were 6.7\u00d710 -3 , 8.8\u00d710 -4 , 1.2\u00d710 -4 , 4.0\u00d710 -6 , 2.5\u00d710 -7 , respectively (Table 2, average of 5 samples), far lower than what their Illumina Q-scores suggest. However, when the rabies control plasmid was sequenced a second time, the resulting ORP mismatch rate profile was quite different. Though the mismatch rates were comparable to the first run in the raw, unfiltered ORP reads, they were significantly higher in the second run when comparing the same Q thresholds ( Table 2) . At Q30, ORP mismatch rates in the first run were two orders of magnitude lower than the rabies control repeat run. Given the same model of Next Generation Sequencing instrument (Illumina GA IIx) was used in both sequencing runs, the most parsimoneous explanation for the difference in ORP mismatch rates is the difference in the Q-score calibration of the two instruments. This underscores the utility of using ORP to recover an empirical sequencing error rate and minimize technical artifacts introduced by the sequencer. The trade-off for enhanced accuracy is the reduction in coverage. Since the two overlapping reads represent redundant information from the same amplicon, the true depth of coverage is the number of read pairs instead of number of single reads. For example, in the BCV control sample, the Q-score filtering process removes roughly 11%, 22% and 55% of the raw matching ORPs at each base at Q10, Q20 and Q30, respectively (see Additional file 1: Figure S1 ).",

Consistent with Figure 2 , the number of mismatched ORPs decreased with Q-scores while the number of matching ORPs increased with Q-scores. In contrast, the number of erroneous matching ORPs was relatively constant with respect to Q-scores, which suggests that they were dominated by PCR errors and not sequencing errors. Furthermore, Figure 3 shows that at Q \u2265 30, the number of mismatched ORPs (sequencing error) became dramatically lower than the number of erroneous matching ORP (PCR error).

(Since only matching ORPs are considered here, these polymorphisms are erroneous matching read pairs.) The mean probability of such an error was estimated from the fraction of erroneous calls among all calls made across the control plasmid, which later served as the baseline error rate in our variant detection model. Another useful statistic is the maximum per base-call error ratefrequency of the erroneous base-call with the highest frequency in the control plasmid --which provided an upper bound on the combined PCR and sequencing error that occurred at a single locus. Table 3 summarizes these error rates in the control plasmids at Q10 and Q30 for ORP and the two single reads that make up the read pairs. Notably, the maximum per base-call ORP error at Q10 and Q30 were comparable, which suggests this error was fairly stable and did not improve with Q-score. This result paralleled the finding that the frequency of erroneous matching ORP was relatively constant with Q-scores ( Figure 3 ). Together, they suggest that the maximum per base-call errors observed in matching ORPs was likely produced by PCR. As expected, matching ORPs have reduced error rates compared to the two single reads that make up each read pair. At Q10, this reduction is 3 fold in the mean error rate and one to two orders of magnitude in the maximum error rate (Table 3 ). Figure 4 shows the cumulative distribution of per base-call errors in the matching ORP and single reads thresholded at Q = 10, 20 and 30. The read accuracy improvement of using ORP over single reads, revealed as a gap between their respective error profiles, was most prominent at Q10 and diminished with higher Q-score filtering; the advantage at Q30 was small yet still highly significant (twosample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test p = 5\u00d710 -36 and 2\u00d710 -11 for rabies and BCV control, respectively), as any reduction in error rate can be used to detect viral variants with greater sensitivity. In our data, error rates in Q30 single reads were equivalent with Q20 ORP reads. This equivalence, however, may not be generalizable to other data sets due to variations in Q-score metrics shown earlier ( Table 2) . Our variant detection model uses a position-dependent error rate that takes the mismatch rate found at each base into consideration (Methods). Before applying this model on the natural samples, we applied it to the control data and determined that the false positive rates associated with 3 error rates, 5\u00d710 -5 , 1\u00d710 -4 and 5\u00d710 -4 were 2.45%, 0.75% and 0%, respectively (Additional file 1: Table S2 ). This suggests that the mean Q30 ORP error rate of~5\u00d710 -5 estimated from the control data (Table 3) was not conservative enough to eliminate all false positive variant calls, possibly due to PCR errors. Based on these observations, we made variant calls in the three natural viral samples using both 5\u00d710 -5 and a more conservative error rate of 5\u00d710 -4 , where the former represented the mean overall error rate and the latter approximated the PCR error rate.",

Figure 5A shows that most of the variants detected at 5\u00d710 -5 were far more rare than the least frequent variants detected at 5\u00d710 -4 . This means, the higher error rate of 5\u00d710 -4 was not sensitive enough to detect the Mean and maximum error rates at Q10 and Q30 are listed for matching ORP as well as the forward and reverse reads that make up the read pairs. majority of the mutations detected at the lower error rate of 5\u00d710 -5 , which existed at frequencies below 0.05%. Recovering the bulk of these 'ultra-rare' viral mutations, however, requires considerable extra efforteither through reduced error rate or increased coverage. Since for most viral evolution study designs it may not be practical or necessary to sequence viral samples at the coverage level used in this paper, we estimated the theoretical coverage required to achieve specific variant detection sensitivity under three error rates: 5\u00d710 -5 , 1\u00d710 -4 , and 5\u00d710 -4 . Predictions are based on a binomial error model with a fixed Bonferroni correction factor (assuming 11,000 candidate variants detected in every case) and shown in Figure 5B . For instance, at 20,000x coverage (matching ORP), the maximum sensitivity, or the rarest variants that can be detected at these three error rates have population frequencies of 0.05%, 0.065% and 0.145%, respectively, with the lowest error rate (5\u00d710 -5 ) being the most sensitive and the highest error rate (5\u00d710 -4 ) being the least sensitive. As shown in Figure 4 , accuracy of Q30 single reads is comparable to that of Q20 ORPs. In the scenario of 20,000x ORP coverage, if non-overlapping read pairs had been generated during sequencing, in theory, the number of Q30 single reads could potentially double the coverage to 40,000x. At the error rate of 5\u00d710 -5 , the maximum sensitivity for variant detection in these Q30 single reads would be 0.03% instead of 0.05%. The cost of this increased coverage by generating non-overlapping read pairs is losing the benefit of context-specific error estimation and correction afforded by the overlapping read pairs. The accuracy comparison between Q20 ORPs and Q30 single reads observed in our data set was only established because ORPs were used. Any accuracy equivalence between single reads and ORP has to be carefully re-established for the specific sequencer being used. ",

We have developed a protocol to evaluate and control sequencing error in multiple ways. First, plasmid clones were sequenced along with viral samples of interest so that error rates in the PCR and sequencing process could be empirically derived. Second, taking advantage of the Illumina paired-end technology, overlapping paired-end reads were generated to improve read accuracy. Third, mismatch rates in the ORP and error rates in the control plasmids were examined in association with quality scores from the sequencers so an optimal Q-score threshold could be selected for read filtering. Mismatch rates were also incorporated in the variant detection model to dynamically adjust error rates based on local sequencing errors. Applying this model on the plasmid control data before the natural samples further gave empirical assessment of false positive rates in the data for a given error rate.",

Using mismatch rates in the ORP, we demonstrated considerable variability of quality metrics on two Illumina GA IIx sequencers ( Table 2) . This variability may stem from differences in the Qscore calibration process on the sequencers. Together, these findings suggest that Q-scores by themselves are not reliable measures of sequencing accuracy. Mismatch rates in ORPs, however, provide unbiased estimates on sequencing error and can be used to select Q-scores for read filtering.",

Mismatch rates in the ORPs offer locusspecific information on error rates and thus can improve variant call accuracy.

Our results show that with careful quality control, the accuracy of PCR-amplicon sequencing will be limited by PCR rather than sequencing errors. While it is often necessary to use RT-PCR to amplify viral RNA from host material, the exponential nature of the PCR reaction combined with issues such as primer bias can skew the variant frequencies (e.g. toward laboratory-derived reference strains) and even generate incorrect consensus sequences in some regions of the genome. This highlights the importance of pursuing alternative, direct sequencing technologies. Until recently, it has not been practical to sequence viral samples such as ours without PCR amplification. As the technology of direct sequencing improves and becomes available, methods that can reduce sequencing error, such as the use of ORP, will play a greater role in quality control.",

Choosing to generate overlapping read pairs instead of nonoverlapping read pairs can reduce the effective coverage by half. Another limitation of ORPs is the effective shortening of read length, which limits downstream analysis such as linking multiple sub-consensus mutations to a single haplotype. Nevertheless, currently the longest length of non-overlapping read pairs is still too short to span an entire gene or genome for the purpose of reconstructing subconsensus haplotypes.",

            "text": "Several alternative ultra-sensitive mutation detection approaches have been proposed recently for next generation sequencing [15, 31, 32] , but they require significant sample preparation and may not be practical beyond targeting limited regions of a genome. Both Duplex Sequencing [32] and Safe-SeqS [31] require labeling the DNA fragment libraries with unique sequence tags (UID) prior to PCR amplification. Post-sequencing, mutations that occur in the majority of their uniquely tagged read families are identified as true variants. These methods successfully address the errors introduced during PCR and sequencing but are subject to the efficiency of the UID assignment. A significant fraction of the starting material is generally lost in the library prep procedures for Illumina sequencing due to poor adapter ligation efficiency and the requirement of multiple clean-up cycles. If a sample contains limited starting material for sequencing, as is often the case in viral or clinical samples, performing adapter ligation prior to PCR amplification will likely lead to poor representation of the sample. Furthermore, the additional UID assignment process adds to the complexity and cost of sample preparation. Thus while these methods present a possible approach for the future, their scalability to whole genome sequencing has not yet been demonstrated. Flaherty et al. [15] proposed an ultrasensitive mutation detection method for targeted resequencing using a position-specific error profile. They derive the positionspecific error profile of a 700 bp region of the NA gene in H1N1 using a clone of the sample of interest. This approach while highly specific, also does not scale to whole genome analysis. In contrast to these methods, we suggest that the use of ORPs to derive error profiles is easily extendible to a genome of any size without the use of a cloned sample. Comparable fragment length and read length is the only requirement to generate ORPs.",

We provided theoretical maximum sensitivity for a given coverage at three different error rates ( Figure 5B ). Consistent with these predictions, the majority of the variants detected in our data occurred at the frequencies of 0.01% to 0.1% for the error rate of 5\u00d710 -5 . For our samples, the 'ultra-rare' mutants make up a majority of the sub-consensus population ( Figure 5A ). These ultra-rare mutants greatly increase the genetic diversity in the quasispecies and may play important roles in acute viral infectious diseases. While it remains an open question as to their ultimate importance for downstream applications, our results illustrate the significance of reduced error and increased coverage in recovering these rare mutations. Reliable rare variant detection and sequence error reduction is important for many research areas beyond virology. Our methods have applications in clinical diagnostics [15, 31] , forensics [33] and DNA-based information storage system [34] . Although high-throughput sequencing technologies have been limited in some applications due to their high error rates, repeated template sequencing presents a powerful approach for increasing the sequencing fidelity to a level that can generate highly sensitive detection assays.",

These nucleotide frequency distributions were generated at four quality thresholds for comparative analyses: raw (all reads), Q\u226510, Q\u226520 and Q\u226530. At a given base, a read covering the base contributes to a candidate base call only when the minimum Q-score over an 11-nucleotide window (\u00b15bp) centered on the query base surpasses the quality-score threshold being considered (e.g. the Q30 nucleotide frequency profile). In addition to Q-score filtering, a misalignment filter required that the 11-nt window contained no indels and that the query position must be at least five bases away from the end of the read to avoid misalignment for single reads. To avoid the potential of higher error rates at the 3-prime ends of single reads, only the first 80 bases were used in single read analyses. Furthermore, when calculating error rates and making variant calls, only those bases where greater than 10% of the reads that survive the quality filters are considered for analysis at that quality score. This is to avoid inclusion of non-representative features for select bases in the genome.",
