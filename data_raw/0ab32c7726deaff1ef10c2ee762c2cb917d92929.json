Recently, our group reported the isolation of the Melaka virus from a patient with acute respiratory disease and provided data suggesting that this new orthoreovirus is capable of human-to-human transmission and is probably of bat origin. Here we report yet another Melaka-like reovirus (named Kampar virus) isolated from the throat swab of a 54 year old male patient in Kampar, Perak, Malaysia who was suffering from high fever, acute respiratory disease and vomiting at the time of virus isolation. Serological studies indicated that Kampar virus was transmitted from the index case to at least one other individual and caused respiratory disease in the contact case. Sequence analysis of the four small class genome segments indicated that Kampar and Melaka viruses are closely related. This was confirmed by virus neutralization assay, showing an effective two-way cross neutralization, i.e., the serum against one virus was able to neutralize the other. Although the exact origin of Kampar virus is unknown, epidemiological tracing revealed that the house of the index case is surrounded by fruit trees frequently visited by fruit bats. There is a high probability that Kampar virus originated from bats and was transmitted to humans via bat droppings or contaminated fruits. The discovery of Kampar virus highlights the increasing trend of emergence of bat zoonotic viruses and the need to expand our understanding of bats as a source of many unknown viruses.",

Members of the genus Orthoreovirus contain 10 genome segments and have been isolated from a broad range of mammalian, avian and reptilian hosts. Although orthoreoviruses have been identified as the causative agents of diseases in animals, infections in humans are generally benign with very rare cases of mild upper respiratory tract illness or enteritis in infants or children [3] . Orthoreoviruses are divided into two subgroups, fusogenic and nonfusogenic, based on the ability of the virus to induce cell-cell fusion and syncytium formation [4] .",

A tall fruiting mango tree is planted close to the house which is of less than three feet from the side wall of the house and directly adjacent to the window of the living room. At night, fruit bats were noted to use this mango tree to feed on the ''sea-almond'' fruits which they obtained from the nearby Ketapang trees. Partially eaten fruits and leftover stones of the fruits abandoned by the fruit bats were noted on the ground just outside the window of the living room or on the roof of the house. Only occasionally, the fruit bats were noted to feed on the ripened mangoes. During night time, S1 and his wife often rested in the living room while watching television. There was no recollection of fruit bats flying into his house or roosting inside the house. There was also no record of dead fruit bats being found in the house compound. It is not clear at the present time whether KamV is carried by a specific fruit bat species or by multiple bat species circulating in the region. A preliminary survey of bat sera collected in peninsular Malaysia from our previous studies indicated a low prevalence of KamV-specific antibodies in at least two different bat species, Pteropus vampyrus (1/55) and Pteropus hypomelaunus (2/77). Considering that the closely related PulV virus was isolated from Pteropus hypomelaunus [7] and NBV from Pteropus poliocephalus [6] , it seems likely that these orthoreoviruses may have a broad host range among different bats. It should be noted that smaller fruit bats, such as Eonycteris spelaean and Cynopterus brachyotis, are more commonly found in the areas where KamV and MelV were discovered. Further field study is required to elucidate the bat species mainly responsible for the spill over of these viruses into human population in Malaysia.",

The genetic relatedness of KamV and three other viruses in the NBV species group was further corroborated by the following molecular characteristics: (i) The deduced protein products encoded by the four small (S) genome segments of these viruses are very similar in size and share significant levels of sequence identity (Table 4 ); (ii) One S-class genome segment of orthoreoviruses may be polycistronic, and its coding arrangement is used as a useful molecular marker for differentiation of different species groups (Duncan et al., 2004) . The S1 segment of KamV has an identical coding arrangement to that of the three other viruses (data not shown); (iii) Orthoreoviruses have highly conserved genome terminal sequences at the 59 end of the positive sense RNA which can be used as a genetic marker for virus classification [3] . For KamV, the consensus sequence is 59 GCUUww (w = U or A), which is identical to that of MelV, PulV and NBV (Figure 4 ), but different from other orthoreoviruses. The evolutionary relationship between KamV and other known orthoreoviruses was investigated by conducting phylogenetic analyses for all the proteins encoded by the S-class genome segments. Representative phylogenetic trees based on deduced amino acid sequences of the major outer capsid protein and the major inner capsid protein are shown in Figure 5A and 5B, respectively. It is evident that KamV is a close member of the NBV species. Similar trees were obtained based on other proteins (data not shown).",

Subsequent serological surveillance confirmed low levels of antibodies to KamV circulating in two bat species commonly found in peninsula Malaysia. Retrospective serological studies indicated that the index has transmitted the virus to at least one other person, his doctor, presumably via contact droplet nuclei or aerosol.

            "text": "During the preparation of this manuscript, the partial S segment sequences of a new orthoreovirus were made available in the GenBank by a group in Hong Kong (GenBank accession numbers EU165526 and EU170365-7). This virus, tentatively named reovirus strain HK23629/07, was isolated from a patient suffering an acute respiratory infection. Phylogenetic analysis of the available sequences confirmed that the HK strain is very closely related to other members of the NBV group. A closer look at the phylogenetic tree based on the most variable protein, cell attachment protein sigma C (Figure 6 ), indicated that the Malaysian bat isolate (PulV) is more closely related to the three human isolates (MelV, KamV and HK) than to the Australian bat isolate (NBV). This suggests that geographic location, rather than the host of isolation, is a more important determinant for genetic relatedness. Although the exact reservoir species of KamV is yet to be determined, preliminary serological studies suggest that KamV is likely able to infect multiple fruit bat species in Malaysia. The isolation of three related viruses from human patients within such a short period and the close relation between bat and human isolates would suggest that spill over by this group of orthor- eoviruses is not an uncommon event and systematic surveillance among RTI patients is needed to provide a more accurate assessment of this newly discovered viral infection among human population in different countries in this region and beyond.",

Briefly, for IFAT a freshly confluent monolayer of MDCK was infected with KamV and at full CPE, the infected cells were harvested, washed four times and suspended in sterile PBS at a cell concentration of approximately 3000 cells per millilitre. An aliquot of the infected cell suspension was carefully spotted onto each well of Teflon coated slides, followed by air-drying over a warm plate and subsequent fixation in cold acetone for 10 min. Serial 2-fold dilutions of serum samples were then added to detect specific reactivity. For detection of IgM, IgG was removed by absorption with protein A prior to serum dilution. Bound antibodies were detected using fluorescein conjugated rabbit anti-human IgM or IgG (Dako, USA). Specific reactivity/labelling were read under a UV fluorescence microscope (Olympus BX50, Japan). For VNT, serial 2-fold dilutions of control and test sera were prepared in duplicate starting at 1:10. An equal volume of virus working stock containing 150 TCID 50 was added to the diluted sera and incubated for 30 min. The pre-incubated virus/ serum mix was added to confluent cell monolayers and incubated for 1 h. The inoculum was removed, monolayers washed three times with PBS and cell media replaced. Ability of sera to neutralize virus was determined by scoring the extent of CPE observed in duplicate wells three days later.",

The majority of sequence information was obtained by PCR with primers designed from conserved regions of MelV, PulV and NBV (primer sequences will be supplied upon request). To obtain the genome segment terminal sequences, a two-step PCR strategy was used. First, the single primer amplification technique or SPAT [36] was used to generate primary PCR product followed by a semi-nested PCR using the combination of KamV genome segment-specific primers and the adaptor-specific primer used in SPAT. PCR products were sequenced directly without cloning. All regions of the genome segments were sequenced at least three times. Phylogenetic analysis was conducted using the MEGA4 software package [37] . Phylogenetic trees were constructed using the neighbour-joining algorithm with bootstrap values determined by 1,000 replicates. Complete genome sequences of the four S segments were deposited in GenBank under accession numbers EU448334 to EU4488337 for S1, S2, S3 and S4 segments, respectively.",
