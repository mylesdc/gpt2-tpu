The characteristics of disease propagation evolve with time, as a result of a multitude of environmental and anthropic factors, this non-stationarity is a key factor in this huge complexity. In the absence of appropriate external data sources, to correctly describe the disease propagation, we explore a flexible approach, based on stochastic models for the disease dynamics, and on diffusion processes for the parameter dynamics. Using such a diffusion process has the advantage of not requiring a specific mathematical function for the parameter dynamics. Coupled with particle MCMC, this approach allows us to reconstruct the time evolution of some key parameters (average transmission rate for instance). Thus, by capturing the time-varying nature of the different mechanisms involved in disease propagation, the epidemic can be described. Firstly we demonstrate the efficiency of this methodology on a toy model, where the parameters and the observation process are known. Applied then to real datasets, our methodology is able, based solely on simple stochastic models, to reconstruct complex epidemics, such as flu or dengue, over long time periods. Hence we demonstrate that timevarying parameters can improve the accuracy of model performances, and we suggest that our methodology can be used as a first step towards a better understanding of a complex epidemic, in situation where data is limited and/or uncertain.",

            "text": "Our world constantly faces the threat of emerging and re-emerging diseases and it has been shown that this has intensified over the past 50 years. This intensification is due, in part, to climate change, urbanization and globalization [1] meaning that infectious diseases remain a constant and unpredictable threat to human health. Numerous factors contribute to the propagation of an infectious disease. These include increased human connectivity, limited availability of economic resources for adequate intervention, increasing antimicrobial resistance, evolution of the dominant strains and increasing parasite and vector resistance to the most widely used drugs and insecticides, etc. A key factor in this huge complexity is non-stationarity [2] , meaning that the characteristics of the dynamical epidemiological processes evolve with time. Thus, the mechanisms of transmission are uncertain, making it difficult to obtain quantitative predictions. One of the classic aspects of non-stationarity, is the seasonality of epidemiological dynamics, linked to environment and climate [3] [4] but the environmental variability can shape the disease propagation in unforeseeable ways on small and large spatial scales [5] [6] [7] [8] . Intervention and control may also modify the course of an epidemic. A less well-described but equally important cause of non-stationarity is linked to social cycles, e.g. school terms, religious holidays and agricultural cycles [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . Research increasingly focuses on the effect of behavioral change in the presence of epidemiological risk as a source of non-stationarity [14] [15] [16] . Societal responses and changing human behavior play an important role in our connected society. Thus, during an epidemic, depending on the availability of information on the disease, people exhibit a variety of behaviors including anxiety and social distancing that might greatly influence the course of an epidemic.",

This is particularly the case when we consider the non-stationarity features of epidemics and their transient nature poses a challenging problem for modeling. Further to this, different hypothesis must be formulated. In the case of influenza, for example, some researchers have suggested using a quantitative relationship between climatic variables and the effective transmission rate [20] . Another recent example illustrates non-stationarity in epidemiology. Between November 2010 and February 2011, despite a low level of population susceptibility, an unexpected third wave of infection by the H1N1pdm09 pandemic virus was observed in the United Kingdom. Using a compartmental mathematical model of influenza transmission, this third wave was explained, by a substantial increase in the transmissibility of the H1N1pdm09 virus [21] . It has been proposed that this modification of the transmissibility was caused by the virus evolution with a better adaptation to the human host, or by climatic factors, namely the very cold weather experienced in the United Kingdom at that time, or by a combination of these factors [21] .",

More complex approaches have therefore been proposed. These approaches use semi-mechanistic models that incorporate the known compartmental structure of disease transmission but do not specify the form of the transmission rate equation that is estimated based on the data. In an early paper, the force of infection is estimated by neuronal network or kernel regression [29] . Now it is more common to use B-spline [30] [31] [32] [33] . An alternative approach is to use diffusion models driven by fractional Brownian motion to model time-varying parameter of major epidemiological significance [34] [35] [36] . The models developed assign diffusion processes to the time-varying parameters embedded in a state-space framework. With the Kalman filter, the timeevolution of some key parameters (average transmission rate, mean incubation rate, and basic reproduction rate) were estimated during the course of the HIV/AIDS epidemics in the Paris region [34] [35] . Dureau et al. [36] generalized this approach using a Bayesian framework with an adjusted adaptive particle Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm (PMCMC), but only applied to the transmission rate, for short epidemics, with application to the 2009 pandemic flu. Very recently, an algorithm relying on robustly estimating the time-varying infection rate, based on the method of the unknown input observers from control theory, has been proposed [37] . Similarly, an approach for the reconstruction of time-dependent transmission rates, by projecting onto a finite subspace, spanned by Legendre polynomials, has been introduced [38] .",

The parameter time evolution is estimated solely based on observations of the incidence or the prevalence. Here, we propose to expand this approach to recurrent epidemics over time periods longer than just one season. The underlying idea of this approach is to capture unknown influences by considering time-varying parameters. As with other semi-mechanistic approaches, the key advantage of this approach, for the parameter dynamics, is that it is data-driven, and thus the shape of change does not need to be specified beforehand. We applied our framework both to a toy model, where parameters and observation process are known, and to two real data sets. This allows us to demonstrate that this datadriven approach is very effective for tackling the non-stationarity of recurrent epidemics, even with long time series. It has other benefits too. For instance, with limited access to information, it can capture unknown influences. By so doing, and by analyzing the parameter time evolution, this framework allows a more thorough analysis of the different influences, facilitating their introduction in more complex models with pertinent hypotheses based on observations.",

In this example, the trajectory of each variable has been simulated with a model for which all the parameters were known. Moreover we also knew the observation process that has generated the data, a Poisson law for the incidence with an observation rate equal to 1. incidence and the transmission rate highlighting the potential of the method. The parameter estimations are in perfect agreement with the values used to generate the observations and the estimation process has correctly converged (S1 and S2 Figs). This clearly demonstrates the feasibility of accurately ascertaining the time evolution of the transmission rate and correctly estimating the R eff (see Fig 2) . It is worth emphasizing that the SIRS model is a complicated example for different reasons. First, even with a constant transmission rate the SIRS model can generate oscillations (damped oscillations, see [17, 44] ). Secondly, the model trajectories are not very sensitive, a modification of \u00b1 10% can induce minor modifications of the trajectories that are inside or near the 95% CI of our inferences (Fig 2) . Moreover in this example we have used initial conditions outside the attractor of the dynamics to generate transients that appear more realistic for real applications, but are more complex to reconstruct. The robustness of our approach has also been tested: (i) using long time series and initial conditions near the attractor ( Fig 3A and S3A Fig); (ii) modifying the number of inferring parameters (S4-S6 Figs), for instance estimating just the volatility parameter (S7 and S8 Figs); (iii) considering the possibility of not using the transformation log in the diffusion process (S9 and S10 Figs) and (iv) using a true \u03b2(t) with 2 or 3 periodic components (Fig 3B and 3C and S3B and S3C Fig) .",

We can accurately describe the 12 year time series and reconstruct the time evolution of \u03b2(t) (Fig 6 and S17 Fig) . Our results stress that the \u03b2(t) oscillations are more complex than a simple sinusoidal function. Sometimes bi-modality occurs over one season. In general one observes a fast growth of \u03b2(t) and a slow decrease. Moreover the amplitude of the \u03b2(t) varies from year to year, perhaps depending on the fluctuations in the mosquito population and in the environment. Interestingly the peak in \u03b2(t) appears 1 to 2 months before the incidence peak. This delay can be explained by the extrinsic incubation period and might be used in a warning system.",

This large nonstationarity association between dengue and climatic factors has recently been demonstrated using statistical models (dynamic generalized linear models) and data from a medium-sized city in Colombia [49] . The authors showed that dengue cases correlate with climatic variables (temperature, rainfall, solar radiation and relative humidity) but these correlations change over time, some intervals showing a positive association, while in others the association is negative [49] . The non-stationarity association between dengue and climate may be explained by the fact that a climatic variable has different effects depending on the biological cycle of the pathogen or of the vector.

Such tools need to take account of the time-varying nature of the underlying ecological and biological mechanisms as well as social and behavioral influences involved in an epidemic. Because of this, time-varying parameters modeled with a diffusion process, that track epidemiological patterns and update the key parameters according to data appear to be a worthwhile approach. Indeed developing a more complex model would be difficult considering the relative paucity of available data. We propose a flexible modeling framework that encompasses time-varying aspects of the epidemic. It does this via diffusion process equations for time-varying parameters and also considers uncertainty associated with key parameters and data. This data-driven framework for time-varying parameters has been coupled with simple stochastic models and a robust Bayesian procedure for inference. To test its efficiency, our proposed methodology was first applied to a toy model and then to real epidemiological examples.",

Firstly, our methodology was able to accurately reconstruct both the incidence and the sinusoidal transmission rate of a simple SIRS model just based on noisy observations (Figs 1-4 and S4 ,S5,S7,S9 and S14 Figs). Based on these reconstructions one can also closely estimate R eff which is one of the key relevant epidemiological parameters. Our results also highlight the flexibility of our developed methodology. It can reconstruct the time evolution of a shifting parameter (\u03b5 S (t), see . The comparison using goodness-of-fit indices with the inferred true model allows us to highlight the fact that our methodology performs as well for the observed incidence. Its flexibility results in greater variability in some other trajectories mainly \u03b2(t) and R eff (Table 1) . Moreover, in the absence of knowledge of the true evolution of the transmission rate, our approach appears to capture the dynamic observed more accurately than a misspecified model (Table 2) . Secondly, applied to real datasets, our framework is able, based solely on simple stochastic models, to reconstruct complex epidemics such as flu or dengue over long time periods (Figs 5 and 6 ). In such cases, the reconstruction of the time evolution of the transmission rate clearly stresses that, on real datasets, it is difficult to assimilate the dynamic of this parameter as a simple sinusoidal function. It is more irregular in amplitude and sometimes multi-modal over one season.",

Indeed most of the unknowns and uncertainties can be put into time-varying parameters. The interactions between both the human behavior and complex environmental drivers. In a recent paper [50] , the authors reviewed evidence of interactions between seasonal influenza virus and other pathogens (bacteria or virus). They concluded that it is important to incorporate these different coinfecting pathogens in models of seasonal flu in order to get a better estimate of the burden of influenza. Our framework could be an alternative to the development of complex models with all the potential interactions between pathogens and to estimate the strength of the interactions. After reconstructing the time evolution of the transmission rate the statistical association between the coinfecting pathogens and the transmission rate could be tested. This screening may facilitate the construction of more complex models that could incorporate only the most significant coinfecting pathogens in the seasonal flu model.",

The relative simplicity of our methodology is also suitable for short-term predictions and it can then easily be used to predict an epidemic in real time.

There is, however, considerable literature on this subject (e.g. [41,42,53-55]). Identifiability is not evident even for a simple seasonal SIR model [56] . To solve this problem one can fit a combination of parameters or fix some of them (the population size for instance) [57] . In our applications there is a clear limitation due to practical non-identifiability of reporting rate and initial conditions. To fix these problems we have used informative priors (see Method). Using informative priors or fixing some parameters gives very similar results (compare Fig 1 and S4-S7 Figs) . Related to this is the misspecification of models [45] . In our cases, as with other semi-mechanistic models the time-varying parameter methodology captures some of the information in the data but not in the mechanistic part of the model. If the model is misspecified due to lack of precision, it compensates for it and the dynamics of \u03b2(t) will drive improvements in the model to make it more complex and realistic ( Table 2 ). If the model is misspecified to the extent that it creates mechanisms that do not exist, the reconstructed \u03b2(t) would compensate for these effects but it will be harder to interpret.",

Indeed, one of the major difficulties with these multi-strain models is the identification of the initial conditions (e.g. [58] ). Nevertheless it is worth emphasizing that the Bayesian inference method used in our framework, PMCMC, the approximation of the likelihood is limited for a large number of parameters and/or equations [59] .

Since the epidemiological propagation models are considered in a stochastic framework, their likelihood is intractable and it is estimated with particle filtering methods (Sequential Monte Carlo, SMC). With a given set of parameters, the SMC algorithm reconstructs sequentially the trajectory of the state variables and the time-varying parameters, and computes the associated likelihood. Firstly, the distribution of the initial conditions of the system is approximated with a sample of particles. Then, at each iteration, the particles are projected according to the propagation model up to the next observation point, they receive a weight reflecting the quality of their prediction compared to the observation and the total likelihood is updated. A resampling step using the weights is performed before the next iteration, in order to discard the trajectories associated with low weight particles.",
