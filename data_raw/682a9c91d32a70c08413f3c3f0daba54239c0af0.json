We used historical time-series data on the spread of cholera in twelve European and North American cities during the second cholera pandemic, as reported in Amariah Brigham's 1832 A Treatise on Epidemic Cholera, to parameterize simple mathematical models of cholera transmission. Richards growth models were used to derive estimates of the basic reproductive number (R 0 ) (median: 16.0, range: 1.9 to 550.9) and the proportion of unrecognized cases (mean: 96.3%, SD: 0.04%). Heterogeneity in model-generated R 0 estimates was consistent with variability in cholera dynamics described by contemporary investigators and may represent differences in the nature of cholera spread. While subject to limitations associated with measurement and the absence of microbiological diagnosis, historical epidemic data are a potentially rich source for understanding pathogen dynamics in the absence of control measures, particularly when used in conjunction with simple and readily interpretable mathematical models.

The earliest western record of cholera dates back to at least 16 th century, when cases were observed in India [1] , but global pandemics of ''asiatic cholera'' were first documented in 1817. Cholera can be endemic or epidemic, and is a disease with pandemic potential, with pandemics occurring as a result of genetic reassortment microbial strains [2] ; the seventh recorded cholera pandemic occurred in the 1960s and cholera remains endemic in many countries [3] . Cholera is treatable with oral rehydration therapy and preventable with adequate sanitation and water treatment, and cholera epidemics have not been seen in high income countries since the early 20 th century [3] ; however, the disease remains a major global threat, with an estimated 3-5 million cases and 100000-120000 deaths annually [4] . In recent years, Africa has accounted for over 90% of cases reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) globally, with majority of the remaining cases reported from low and middle income countries in Asia and South America [5, 6] .",

            "text": "Cholera swept across Europe for the first time in 1831 during the second cholera pandemic (the first (1817) pandemic reached only as far west as the Caspian Sea). The pandemic originated in India in 1826 and moved along trade and military campaign routes to Central Asia, the Middle East, Europe from east to west across the Baltic states, and eventually to North America [1] . Notwithstanding this geographic march, cholera was not widely believed to be contagious prior to John Snow's work on the 1854 London cholera outbreak. Prevalent models for disease spread, some of which lasted until the end of the 19 th century, included the diffusion of a poisonous ''miasma'', spread by tiny, invisible insects, and hypotheses related to the disruption of the earth's magnetic field or atmosphere [7] . While the dispatch of expert commissions to study the progress of the disease in far-off locales [8] and the deployment of military cordons to prevent the disease's spread in eastern and central Europe [1] suggest an implicit recognition of transmissibility, at least by civil authorities, medical professionals tended to deride those who suggested cholera might be contagious as superstitious and unsophisticated. As such, limited attempts were made to control the spread of disease using interventions that could be considered truly effective, and 19 th century epidemics may, consequently, provide a snapshot of the true ''natural history'' of cholera.",

[11] estimated an R 0 ranging from 3 to 15 using average age of first infection and life expectancy data (R 0 &L=A) from four past epidemics between 1985 and 2001. Their analysis yielded an R 0 of 18 for V. cholerae in a ''hyperinfective'' state. Similarly, the symptomatic attack rate of cholera is poorly estimated. Currently available studies suggest that the ratio of asymptomatic (or unrecognized) to symptomatic (or recognized) cases range from 3 to 100 [9] .",

We used Brigham's data to parameterize simple mathematical models of cholera transmission; our objectives were (i) to derive R 0 using the Richards generalized logistic growth model, (ii) to estimate projected ratios of recognized:unrecognized cases using Kermack and McKendrick's formula for final epidemic size, and (iii) to examine the utility of historical data for the parameterization of models of cholera spread.",

While it is possible that misclassification and underreporting of cholera could have been major sources of error in the data it should be noted that such misclassification would not have affected our estimates of R 0 : the Richards model evaluates rate (and hence R 0 ) of growth in a manner that is independent of case counts reported. Distortion of R 0 values could have occurred if case ascertainment changed over time in a given center; however, to explain the diversity of R 0 values such changes would have had to have occurred in different ways in each city we studied, and consequently true variability in epidemic growth remains plausible.",

Cases of cholera could have been underreported among communities that were supposedly immune to the disease, such as ostensibly temperate members of the establishment. Furthermore, the background level of diarrhoea and dysentery in communities is likely to have been high at the time [16, 17, 18] . Bacteriological diagnosis of cholera awaited the work of Robert Koch in the 1880s [19] , hence the ability of clinicians to distinguish between ''Asiatic cholera'', so-called cholera morbus (basically endemic watery diarrhea [1] ), and other forms of gastrointestinal disease which shares the symptoms of Asiatic cholera was also limited.

The model has been applied to contemporary infectious disease outbreaks and size formula emerges as a potentially useful index of the proportion of cases that are unrecognized or truly asymptomatic in situations where effective interventions are not put in place for epidemic control. The lack of understanding of the role of contagion and contaminated water in the spread of cholera in 1832 makes the situation under study one in which this approach is likely to be valid, and this approach may be particularly attractive for the study of historical epidemics where control measures were ineffective. In contemporary epidemics with control, comparison of final epidemic size with expected final size projections based on the Kermack-McKendrick formula would have a different (but also useful) interpretation, and would be a function of both unrecognized/asymptomatic case rates and the effectiveness of control measures.",

Furthermore, advances in disease control through sanitation and vaccination have made many communicable diseases of public health importance uncommon, making the study of epidemic dynamics with contemporary data difficult. For example, Earn has previously demonstrated that regular epidemic cycles become chaotic once vaccination is introduced [22] . The study of historical epidemics can also provide important insights into the impact of [3] . As our data demonstrate, early 19 th century cholera epidemics in Europe and North America had properties similar to those seen in low income countries today [23, 24, 25] , highlighting the fact that it is not intrinsic characteristics of populations, but rather economic conditions, that determine vulnerability to disease.",

Using the expected final sizes and the observed attack rates, the proportion of unrecognized (asymptomatic or undiagnosed) cases can be calculated, and thereby the ratio of unrecognized cases to symptomatic, recognized cases of cholera can be determined. Few assumptions are made by the Richards model: 1) the rate of increase in cumulative case is proportional to present number of cases, 2) case incidence grows exponentially without intervention and 3) effective interventions would decrease incidence growth [28] . Cholera satisfies all three assumptions.",

Ma and Earn showed that the formula still holds ''(i) regardless of the number of distinct infectious stages, (ii) if the mean contact rate is itself arbitrarily distributed and (iii) for a large class of spatially heterogeneous contact structures'' [32] . For two-wave epidemics, this approach is problematic since I(0) is not equal to zero for the second wave. Consequently, we approximated expected final size for two-wave epidemics based on the best-fit single epidemic curve generated using the Richards approach. Figure S1 Sensitivity analysis on the impact of estimated cholera generation time on cholera R 0 . City names in legend are ordered from highest R 0 (Riga) to lowest (Philadelphia). A 4-day generation time was used in the base case. Cities with an asterisk next to name had 2-wave cholera epidemics; best-fit single wave R 0 estimates are presented here. It can be seen that as expected the absolute impact of uncertainty in generation time is greatest for high-R 0 cities. (TIF)",
