However, the underlying mechanisms of this process are still poorly understood. Here, we show that the mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS/VISA/Cardif/IPS-1) is critical for SeV (Sendai virus)-induced apoptosis. MAVS specifically activates c-Jun N-terminal kinase 2 (JNK2) but not other MAP kinases. Jnk22/2 cells, but not Jnk12/2 cells, are unable to initiate virus-induced apoptosis and SeV further fails to trigger apoptosis in MAPK kinase 7 (MKK7) knockout (Mkk72/2) cells. Mechanistically, MAVS recruits MKK7 onto mitochondria via its 3D domain, which subsequently phosphorylates JNK2 and thus activates the apoptosis pathway. Consistently, Jnk22/2 mice, but not Jnk12/2 mice, display marked inflammatory injury in lung and liver after viral challenge. Collectively, we have identified a novel signaling pathway, involving MAVS-MKK7-JNK2, which mediates virus-induced apoptosis and highlights the indispensable role of mitochondrial outer membrane in host defenses.",

During infection with a RNA virus, the mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS/VISA/Cardif/IPS-1) has been recently uncovered to seed a critical protein complex on the mitochondrial outer membrane [1] [2] [3] [4] . This signalosome consists of TNFRassociated factors (TRAF2/3/6) [5] , TNFR-associated death domain protein (TRADD) [6] , translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 70 (TOM70) [7] , ubiquitously expressed transcript (UXT-V1) [8] , Autophagy proteins (Atg5/Atg12) [9] , Mitofusin-2 (Mfn2) [10] et.al. The MAVS signalosome activates TANKbinding kinase 1 (TBK1), which then phosphorylates interferon (IFN) regulatory factor 3(IRF3). In addition, the MAVS signalosome can also activate the IkB kinase (IKK) complex and nuclear factor kB (NF-kB). Synergistically, these transcription factors (IRF3 and NF-kB) induce the early production of type I interferons and inflammatory cytokines [11] .",

As such, these infections represent effective models for studying virusinduced apoptosis. Due to the central role of mitochondria in apoptosis and the mitochondrial localization of MAVS, it is important to explore the putative function of MAVS in the apoptotic signaling pathway. This work will be instrumental towards understanding the molecular mechanisms regarding host decisions on cell survival and apoptosis, and shedding further light on the cross-talk between innate immunity and apoptosis.",

To explore this possibility, we overexpressed MAVS in HEK293 cells and then checked the activation of JNK, extracelluar signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and p38. Interestingly, the phosphorylation of JNK exhibited a dosedependence on the expression of MAVS, whereas similar effects did not apply to either ERK or p38 ( Figure 1A ), suggesting that MAVS may specifically activate JNK. Using siRNA to knock down endogenous MAVS, we further explored the SeV-induced activation of JNK. As expected, SeV could induce the phosphorylation of all the MAP kinases (JNK, ERK and p38). Notably, knockdown of MAVS appeared to attenuate JNK activation, whereas this did not influence the activation of ERK or p38 ( Figure 1B ). In addition, the knock down of MAVS did not affect tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFa)-triggered phosphorylation of JNK, ERK or p38 ( Figure 1B) .

Ectopic-expression of RIG-I, TBK1, IKKa or IKKe did not influence JNK phosphorylation ( Figure 1C ). RIG-I and MDA5 are the viral nucleic acid sensors and are both upstream of MAVS signaling. We used Rig-i 2/2 MEF cells to determine whether RIG-I also mediated JNK phosphorylation. Surprisingly, knockout of RIG-I didn't influence the SeV-triggered JNK phosphorylation, although it did abrogate IRF3 activation ( Figure 1D ). We also prepared siRNA sets to specifically knock down RIG-I or MDA5. The results showed that a decrease in either RIG-I or MDA5 did not impact SeV-induced JNK phosphorylation ( Figure S1A ). The absence of TBK1 also had no effect on JNK phosphorylation ( Figure 1E ). In contrast, MAVS deficiency completely blocked SeV-induced JNK activation ( Figure 1F ). Taken together, the SeV-induced activation of JNK is dependent on MAVS, yet independent of RIG-I/MDA5 and TBK1/IKK.

These results indicate that MAVS specifically modulates virus-induced apoptosis. In addition, ectopic-expression of MAVS potentiated JNK phosphorylation and apoptosis, whereas RIG-I (full length), RIG-I-CARDs (constitutively activated form of RIG-I), TBK1, IKKa and IKKe failed to do so ( Figure 2C ). We also measured SeV-induced apoptosis in Rig-i 2/2 MEFs. Consistently, there was no difference in the cleavage of PARP or caspase-3, between RIG-I knockout and wild type control ( Figure S1B ).",

Consistently, the caspase inhibitor Z-VAD effectively blocked the PARP/caspase-3 cleavages, whereas the inhibitor did not affect the phosphorylation of JNKs upon SeV stimulation ( Figure S2A and S2B), suggesting that JNK activation is primary, not secondary to cell apoptosis. Unexpectedly, knock down of endogenous JNK2 alone significantly attenuated the SeV-induced PARP/caspase-3 cleavages, whereas knockdown of JNK1 alone did not appear to influence apoptosis ( Figure 2E ). These observations were further substantiated by using Jnk1 2/2 and Jnk2 2/2 MEF cells after SeV infection ( Figure 2F ) or VSV infection ( Figure S2C ). Collectively, these data differentiate the functions of JNK1 and JNK2, revealing the specific role of JNK2 in SeV-induced apoptosis.",

In this study, we revealed the essential role of MAVS in virusinduced apoptosis, independent of Retinoic acid-Inducible Gene I (RIG-I) signaling. Upon viral infection, MAVS recruits MKK7 onto mitochondria, followed by MKK7 induced activation of JNK2, which subsequently initiates apoptosis. Importantly, we have clearly differentiated the roles of JNK2 versus JNK1, and MKK7 versus MKK4 in virus-induced apoptosis. Thus, we define a novel apoptotic signaling pathway, involving MAVS-MKK7-JNK2, which sheds a new perspective on the crosstalk between the antiviral and apoptotic signaling pathways in innate immunity. we used Mkk4/7 2/2 or Mkk3/6 2/2 double knockout MEF cells. As expected, JNK1/2 phosphorylation was abolished in Mkk4/7 2/2 cells, whereas this was not the case in Mkk3/6 2/2 cells ( Figure 3A ). In addition, we individually knocked down MKK4 and MKK7 in HEK293 cells. MKK7, but not MKK4, was both necessary and sufficient for JNK phosphorylation ( Figure 3B ). Consistent with these results, SeV-induced apoptosis was significantly impaired in Mkk4/7 2/2 MEF cells, in contrast to Mkk3/6 2/2 MEF and wild type cells ( Figure 3C ). The specific knock down of MKK7, but not MMK4, further attenuated apoptosis in HEK293 cells ( Figure 3D ). Collectively, our results reveal MKK7 as the essential signal transducer for SeV-induced apoptosis.",

The mortality of the Jnk2 2/2 mice was proportional to the amount of VSV administrated. Almost all of the Jnk2 2/2 mice died when high dose of VSV was used ( Figure 6A ). In contrast, only a small fraction of the Jnk1 2/2 mice died and no wild type mice died, under the same conditions ( Figure 6A ). Two days after VSV infection, we prepared serum from the mice and performed plaque assays in HEK293 cells ( Figure 6B , upper). Consistently, VSV replicated much more robustly in Jnk2 2/2 mice ( Figure 6B , lower). Quantification revealed that the viral titer of VSV in Jnk2 2/2 mice was 7-10 fold higher than that in Jnk1 2/2 or wild-type mice ( Figure 6C ). These results indicate that JNK2 could protect mice against the VSV infection, whereas JNK1 was dispensable.",

Strikingly, NDV-GFP was markedly observed in the lung of the Jnk2 2/2 mice, whereas no or only marginal NDV-GFP were detected in the lungs of wild-type or Jnk1 2/2 mice ( Figure 6D ). Serum was also collected from the mice and the NDV-GFP titers were monitored by infecting HEK293 cells and using fluorescence microscopy ( Figure 6E ) and flow cytometry ( Figure 6F ).

These BMDM were then infected with SeV and their cytokine expression was measured at both the protein and mRNA level ( Figure 7A and Figure S6 ). It was observed that JNK1 and JNK2 only marginally influenced the expression of cytokines induced by innate immune signaling, and there was no difference in IFN-b (Interferon b) protein expression between wild type and JNK2 knockout cells ( Figure 7A ).

Further investigation is needed to dissect the manner by which JNK2 triggers the relevant apoptosis effector mechanism, downstream of MAVS-mediated signaling.

Several DNA sensors have been reported recently, including Absent In Melanoma 2 (AIM2) [26] , DNA-dependent activator of interferon regulatory factors (DAI) [27] , DEAD box polypeptide 41 (DDX41) [28] , interferon inducible protein 16 (IFI16) [29] , and cGAMP synthase (cGAS) [30, 31] . Each of these sensors activate the endoplasmic reticulum protein called stimulator of interferon genes (STING). Like MAVS, STING activates both IKK and IRF3, thereby turning on the NF-kB and IRF3 signaling pathways [32, 33] . In the current study, we established the role of MAVS-MKK7-JNK2 signaling in mediating RNA virus-induced apoptosis. Future studies will address whether STING plays a role in JNK activation during DNA virus-induced apoptosis. In addition, it remains intriguing to examine potential sensor(s) for RNA virus-induced apoptosis. Wild type C57BL/6, Jnk1 2/2 or Jnk2 2/2 mice (12 mice in each group) were infected with VSV at the indicated doses via nasal dripping (liquid volume#20 mL). Survival rates of the mice were monitored at 5 days after infection. (B) The mice were intranasally challenged with VSV (10 6 PFU/g mouse weight). Two days after infection, serum was collected from the mice. Equal volumes (10 mL) of serum were added to HEK293 cells culture media and incubated for 24 hours, followed by plaque assay using crystal violet staining. Viral plaques were observed by microscopy and the viral titer was calculated. (C) Data from B presented as means6SD (n = 3). (D) Wild type C57BL/6, Jnk1 2/2 or Jnk2 2/2 mice were infected with NDV-GFP (10 6 PFU/g mouse weight). Two days after viral challenge, lungs were collected for fluorescence stereomicroscopy to observe NDV-GFP in situ. (E) Serum was collected at 2 days after NDV-GFP infection and equal volumes (100 mL) of serum were added to HEK293 cells culture media. Eighteen hours later, the NDV-GFP infected cells were observed by fluorescence microscopy. (F) GFP-positive cells from E were quantified by flow cytometry. doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1004020.g006 ",

            "text": "Schematic diagram of the MAVS-MKK7-JNK2 apoptosis signaling pathway. MAVS is a critical converging point of the host response to RNA virus infection. By engaging RIG-I or MDA5, MAVS forms a mitochondrial signalosome, dynamically composed of TRAF2/3/6, TRADD, TOM70, UXT-V1 and so on. This signalosome leads to the activation of TBK1 and IKK and then the ultimate induction of type 1 interferon and inflammatory cytokines, thereby establishing the antiviral state. In addition, MAVS also recruits MAPK kinase MKK7 onto the mitochondria via proteinprotein interaction. MKK7 subsequently induces the phosphorylation of JNK2 at its threonine-183 and tyrosine-185 positions. Finally, JNK2 initiates cell apoptosis to sacrifice the virus-infected host cell, thereby dampening virus-induced inflammatory injury. doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1004020.g008",
