A virulent PEDV YN13 strain, isolated in our laboratory, was attenuated to yield an attenuated PEDV strain YN144. To better understand the pathogenesis mechanism and the virus-host interaction during infection with both PEDV YN13 and YN144 strains, a comparative proteomic analysis was carried out to investigate the proteomic changes produced in the primary target organ, using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) labeling, followed by liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). A total of 269 and 301 differently expressed proteins (DEPs) were identified in the jejunum tissues of the piglets inoculated with YN13 and YN144, respectively. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that these proteins were involved in stress responses, signal transduction, and the immune system. All of these involved interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) which were up-regulated in jejunums by both of the PEDV-infected groups. Based on the comparative analysis, we proposed that different changes induced by YN13 and YN144 in heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNPA1), eukaryotic initiation factor 4G1 (eIF4G1), and some members in the heat shock protein (HSP) family, may be responsible for differences in their pathogenicity.",

PED was first reported in England in 1971 [2] . Since then, it has been reported in many European and Asian countries. In the past ten years, new outbreaks of PED in Thailand [3] , China [4] [5] [6] , South Korea [7, 8] , USA [9] , and Japan [10] have caused serious economic losses to their swine industry. For example, the PED outbreak in USA in 2013 led to an estimated death of 7 million piglets [11] . The etiological agent is porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV). PEDV, a member of the Coronaviridae family, is a single-stranded positive sense RNA virus. Viral genome is about 28 kb, encoding four structural proteins (spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N)), and three non-structural proteins (replicases 1a, 1b, and accessory protein ORF3) [12] . Despite extensive research on PEDV, there have been few comparative in vivo studies examining the host interaction with the wild type, its attenuated PEDV strain, and their pathogenesis.",

It is well known that expression of ISGs depends on the induction of interferon (IFN). Previous studies have demonstrated that the N protein, the non-structure protein 1, 3c-like protease or papain-like protease of PEDV, inhibited the production of type-I IFN in vitro [24] [25] [26] [27] . In addition, Cao et al. have proven in vitro that PDEV could inhibit the production of IFN-\u03b2 in its infected porcine intestinal epithelial cells [28] . However, recently, Thavamathi et al. have verified that suckling pigs infected with PEDV have a higher and earlier increase in serum IFN\u03b1 [29] , which may explain the upregulation of those ISG proteins in the present study. It is also known that IFN regulates the production of ISGs by activating the JAK-STAT signaling pathway [30] . Transcription of ISGs requires the phosphorylation and nuclear transportation of signal transducer and activator of transcription proteins (STATs). There are seven STAT proteins in mammals [31] . Among them, STAT1 and STAT2 are the most important in the IFN signaling pathway [23] . In vitro studies have demonstrated that PEDV infection inhibited the interferon signaling by targeted degradation of STAT1 [20, 32] . However, in this work, no significant change was found in STAT1 and STAT2 in the two PEDV infected groups. So, further investigations are needed to elucidate the upregulation of ISG proteins.",

            "text": "Transcription and translation are two key steps in the process of virus replication. Alterations of factors involved in viral transcription and translation may affect viral replication. Coronavirus replication involves the generation of nested subgenomic mRNAs (sgmRNAs) with a common capped 5 leader sequence [51] . To organize optical transcription of sgmRNAs, its 5 terminal leader sequences need to interact with intergenic (IG) sequences just upstream of each open reading frame (ORF). Li et al. have verified that hnRNPA1, a RNA binding protein, can bind both the 5 terminal leader sequence and IG sequence of coronavirus sgmRNA [52] . So, it is obvious that alteration of hnRNPA1 can influence the transcription of coronavirus and thus the replication of coronavirus. This phenomenon has been verified by a previous study reporting that overexpression of hnRNPA1 promoted mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) replication while a dominant-negative inhibition of hnRNPA1 reduced MHV replication [53] . In this study, hnRNPA1 was downregulated in the YN144-infected group, suggesting a decrease of the replication of YN144. The translation of most of the sgmRNAs requires eukaryotic initiation factor 4F (eIF4F), which is composed of eIF4A, eIF4E, and eIF4G. Regina Cencic et al. have reported that replication of human coronavirus 229E was significantly inhibited by blocking the interaction between eIF4E and eIF4G [51] . In the case of vesicular stomatitis virus and influenza virus, viral replication was also inhibited by silencing eIF4G1 [54, 55] . In the present study, eIF4G1 was upregulated in YN13-infected group but downregulated in YN144-infected group. This result demonstrates that YN13 might enhance its replication by upregulating expressed eIF4G, while the downregulation of eIF4G1 may result in inhibiting the replication of YN144.",
