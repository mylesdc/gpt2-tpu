A technique that couples polymerase chain reaction to mass spectrometry (PCR/ESI-MS) has recently been developed and an assay validated to identify and genotype S. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS). Methods: This study was conducted to determine the rates, risk factors, and molecular genotypes of colonizing Staphylococcus aureus in adult patients presenting to an inner-city academic emergency department. Participants completed a structured questionnaire to assess hospital and community risks for infection with methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Nasal swabs were analyzed by PCR/ESI-MS to identify and genotype S. aureus and CoNS.",

The molecular genotypes of the 59 S. aureus strains were diverse; 21 unique molecular genotypes belonging to seven major clonal complexes were identified. Eighty-five of 200 patients carried strains with high-level mupirocin resistance.

Although several epidemiological studies have provided information on the prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) colonization in different hospital settings [2] [3] [4] and in emergency department personnel [5, 6] , limited data exist on MRSA colonization rates for patients seen in emergency departments. The cost benefit of screening for MRSA colonization is not overwhelming and the subject is controversial [7] . A limitation of both culturebased and molecular methods of MRSA screening is that current tests determine only the presence or absence of colonization with no information on the colonizing strain type [8] . As only small subsets of MRSA clones have been responsible for the major epidemics in the United States [9] screening might have greater value if future studies demonstrate that certain clones are more likely to cause serious infections than others.",

A previous version of this assay has been shown to accurately genotype S. aureus strains and to identify the clonal complex of a series of isolates from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). Excellent agreement with multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and pulsedfield gel electrophoresis (PFGE) results [13] was reached using in the PCR/ESI-MS assay a set of eight primer pairs that target the same genes as those for MLST. This set of primer pairs was designed to optimize the information content of the amplicons and distinguished 99% of 710 distinct S. aureus sequence types [13] . Using a second set of eight primer pairs, PCR/ESI-MS has also been used to characterize virulence factors, toxinencoding genes and antibiotic resistance determinants on isolated colonies [14] and to detect MRSA in nasal swabs with sensitivity and specificity similar to culture methods [15] . In this work, elements from the previous studies were consolidated into a single PCR/ESI-MS research application to directly screen nasal swabs from sample of 200 patients who presented to an urban hospital emergency department.",

In addition, for S. aureus detections, the presence or absence of PVL (with a distinction between the \"R\" and \"H\" variants), the mecA gene, the gene encoding TSST-1, and the genes encoding high level (mupA) and low level (ileS) mupirocin resistance were determined along with the clonal complex.

In those co-colonizations, the location of the antibiotic resistance genes could not be determined directly by PCR/ESI-MS (as the same amplicon is produced irrespective of the bacterial strain); instead, the species carrying the gene was determined by plating samples on ChromAgar in order to demonstrate more than one colony type.

DNA from nasal swabs was distributed into eight wells of a microtiter plate, allowing 12 samples to be analyzed per plate. Each well contained two pairs of primers as indicated in Table 1 . Following PCR and desalting, amplicons were analyzed by ESI-MS. Amplicon masses were used to calculate base compositions-the A, G, C, and T counts -of the PCR products. Comparison to a database of calculated base compositions of characterized strains allowed the determination of clonal complexes and USA types and of the presence or absence of genes for virulence factors, toxins and antibiotic resistance determinants. colonized with S. aureus, regardless of whether the patient was co-colonized with CoNS. The genotype and characterization results are shown in Table 3 . The 59 S. aureus isolates showed a remarkable diversity; the isolates clustered into 21 genotypes as depicted by each unique row in Table 3 . One genotype was detected in 12 instances (Table 3) in this patient population, but 11 patients had unique genotypes. When examined from the perspective of clonal complexes, the 21 unique molecular genotypes belong to seven major clonal complexes (CC) ( Table 3 ). The most abundant genotypes were PCR/ESI-MS type 1 (CC8) (19 patients), which correlates with USA300, followed by PCR/ESI-MS type 2 (CC5), which correlates with USA100 (12 patients). Eleven patients had genotypes that were PCR/ESI-MS type 1 and were positive for the PVL \"R\" variant; these genotypes are consistent with the predominant community-associated MRSA (CA-MRSA) in the US [20] . PCR/ESI-MS type 2 (CC5) was isolated from 12 patients; these isolates were PVL negative and these organisms are consistent with hospital-acquired MRSA (HA-MRSA). PCR/ESI-MS types 1 and 2 (CC8 and CC5) represented slightly more than half the organisms isolated from this patient population; the remainders represented a plurality of CC genotypes (CC45, CC30, CC15, CC45, CC59 or CC1) or did not fit into a previously defined clonal complex (Table 3) . Additional molecular resolution beyond the PCR/ESI-MS type was provided by the presence or absence of the lukD/E genes and the gene encoding the TSST-1 toxin. Regions of two leukocidin toxin-producing operons were amplified by a single pair of primers, BCT2095. A region of the Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) operon, which includes the lukS-PV and lukF-PV genes, is targeted by a primer pair that hybridizes across the junction of the 3\u2032 end of lukS-PV and the 5\u2032 end of lukF-PV [14] . The same primer pair serendipitously detects and differentiates by virtue of base composition a second leukotoxinencoding operon that contains the lukE and lukD genes. Thus, analysis of an isolate had four potential outcomes: PVL positive, lukE/D positive, both positive, or neither positive. The lukD/E genes are generally correlated with the clonal complex assignment. It was recently shown that the gene encoding TSST-1 protein was associated with PFGE type USA200 in 87% of isolates studied [23] . The tst gene was present in two of the four instances of this genotype in our study. No mutations associated with low-level mupirocin resistance were observed in the ileS genes within this data set.",

The mechanisms leading to S. aureus nasal carriage are multifactorial, and an optimal fit between host and bacteria seems to be essential [27] . This study demonstrated a significant prevalence of S. aureus, MRSA and drug-resistant CoNS nasal colonization in a random sample of individuals seeking care from the Emergency Department at The Johns Hopkins Hospital. The prevalence of MRSA (13.5%) among nasal isolates was somewhat greater than those estimated from other studies that had a similar objective and sample population [28] . Three studies performed outside healthcare facilities (i.e., isolated, semi-closed rural population [29] , urban poor in San Francisco [30] , or university students in Portugal [31] ) that include a total of 4,452 people, showed a pooled MRSA colonization prevalence of only 0.76% [32] . The prevalence of MRSA colonization in an inpatient setting in a tertiary hospital was reported to be 0.18%-7.2% [32, 33] . Our findings were similar to the prevalence noted in a study investigating the prevalence of MRSA among newly arrested men in Baltimore (29.5% and 13.5% in our study vs. 40.4% and 15.8% for S. aureus and MRSA prevalence, respectively) [34] . Other studies have identified three risk factors for MRSA colonization: hospitalization within the past 12 months [16] , previous MRSA infection [17] and injection drug use [18] . Because these risk factors had already been identified, they were exclusion criteria in our study. Although we evaluated patient demographics, primary complaints, chronic co-morbidities, antibiotic prescriptions and providers' admission decisions, none were independent risk factors for MRSA colonization. Our data confirms recent epidemiologic data indicating that nosocomial MRSA strains are present in the community. Interestingly, there was substantial genotypic diversity of S. aureus and MRSA types in this the patient population. There was a significant frequency of co-colonization of S. aureus and CoNS (24 patients, 12%) and at least one third of patients were colonized with a CoNS that had a high-level mupirocin resistance gene (65 patients or 32%, noncounting the S. aureus co-infections). This is concerning because it has previously been reported that the gene for high-level mupirocin resistance can be found on conjugative plasmids that carry multiple resistance determinants for other antimicrobial agents [21] . Moreover, this resistance has been shown to be transferable to S. aureus [35] , which has implications for mupirocin decolonization strategies.",

As data from more extensive analysis of the S. aureus strains that result in the hospital infections become available, additional targets for genetic analysis of S. aureus can be added. While a goal of this assay was to add targets that provide information that have value for infection control and tracking outbreaks in hospital settings, the limitation to a current assay is the lack of resolution compared to other technologies. We acknowledge that the inclusion of typing for TSST or PVL, would probably not aid in a clinical scenario, but might aid a research study where predictors of subsequent infection in hospitalized patients were being studied.",

A substantial fraction of the S. aureus-colonized patients were co-colonized with CoNS and highlevel mupirocin-resistant CoNS. These findings highlight the importance of active surveillance studies to detect MRSA colonization and/or infection among emergency department patients. The molecular genotypes were directly identified from nasal swabs by PCR/ESI-MS. The ability to identify unique molecular signatures from MRSA may allow infection control resources to be effectively focused and will enable tracking origins of outbreaks in hospital settings. Determining the molecular genotype of S. aureus during intake screening may prove valuable if certain molecular genotypes become associated with increased infection risk. Authors' contributions AK, CG, RR, DJE, RS, and LBB conceived of the study, and participated in its design and coordination and helped to draft the manuscript. RR and CM carried out the genotyping and characterization assay and drafted the manuscript. Y-HH participated in the design of the study and performed the statistical analysis.

Several other, previously described risk factors for S. aureus and MRSA colonization (i.e. previous admission to hospital, or previous antibiotic use) were also investigated in this study. However, there are other known factors for which we do not have data, that might have significantly contributed to the relatively high burden of MRSA encountered in our study, including HIV status, diabetes, men who have sex with men, recent incarceration, high-risk sexual behavior, household members with SSTI, and hospitalassociated exposures[4]. It should be noted that this was not a longitudinal study that would distinguish at least three S aureus nasal carriage patterns in healthy individuals: persistent carriage, intermittent carriage, and non-carriage. This distinction is important because persistent carriers have higher S. aureus loads and a higher risk of acquiring S. aureus infection[37,38]. A further important limitation is that in the significant proportion of patients (~40%) with both S. aureus and CNS, this assay alone cannot distinguish for the presence of MRSA or other resistance determinants being carried by S. aureus. Thus, there remains the need for plating samples on ChromAgar, which adds significantly to the turn-around time for infection control purposes.",
