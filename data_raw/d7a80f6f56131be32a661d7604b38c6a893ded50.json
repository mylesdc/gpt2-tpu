Attempts to identify the natural reservoirs of MERS-CoV have focused in part on dromedaries. Bats are also suspected to be reservoirs based on frequent detection of other betacoronaviruses in these mammals. For this study, ten distinct cell lines derived from bats of divergent species were exposed to MERS-CoV. Plaque assays, immunofluorescence assays, and transmission electron microscopy confirmed that six bat cell lines can be productively infected. We found that the susceptibility or resistance of these bat cell lines directly correlates with the presence or absence of cell surface-expressed CD26/DPP4, the functional human receptor for MERS-CoV. Human anti-CD26/DPP4 antibodies inhibited infection of susceptible bat cells in a dose-dependent manner. Overexpression of human CD26/DPP4 receptor conferred MERS-CoV susceptibility to resistant bat cell lines. Finally, sequential passage of MERS-CoV in permissive bat cells established persistent infection with concomitant downregulation of CD26/DPP4 surface expression. Together, these results imply that bats indeed could be among the MERS-CoV host spectrum, and that cellular restriction of MERS-CoV is determined by CD26/DPP4 expression rather than by downstream restriction factors.",

As of June 11, 2014, MERS-CoV caused 699 laboratory-confirmed human infections in 21 countries, including 209 deaths (proportion of fatal cases <29.9%) [3] . Increasing evidence points to dromedaries (Camelus dromedarius) as an intermediate reservoir contributing to the emergence of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in humans. Several seroepidemiology studies have found MERS-CoV-neutralizing antibodies in dromedaries from Egypt, Jordan, Oman, and Saudi Arabia [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . More recently, coronaviral genomes detected in nasal swabs obtained from dromedaries proved to be identical to genomes of human MERS-CoV isolates [4, 5, 9] . One such genome was detected in a patient who had been caring for a sick dromedary and directly from that animal [10] . In addition, MERS-CoV was directly isolated from a dromedary in Qatar [11] .",

Bats have been proposed as additional MERS-CoV hosts. This hypothesis is based on the fact that several betacoronaviruses related to MERS-CoV (e.g., severe acute respiratory syndrome-like coronaviruses, Tylonycteris bat coronavirus HKU4, Pipistrellus bat coronavirus HKU5) are known to infect bats in Africa, Europe, and Asia [1, [13] [14] [15] [16] . In addition, MERS-CoV genome fragments encoding parts of the RNAdependent RNA polymerase were detected in one Egyptian tomb bat (Taphozous perforates) living close to a MERS-CoV-infected patient [14] . Finally, a novel coronavirus (NeoCoV) closely related to MERS-CoV was discovered in cape serotines (Neoromicia capensis) in South Africa [12] . Therefore, bats could possibly maintain MERS-CoV in nature and may occasionally infect dromedaries and thereby may infect humans similar to the batshorse-human or bats-pig-human transmission cycle observed for henipaviruses [17, 18] .",

The susceptibility or resistance of the ten cell lines to MERS-CoV infection directly correlated with the absence or presence of naturally expressed CD26/DPP4 on the cells surface. Anti-human CD26/DPP4 antibodies reduced MERS-CoV yield in susceptible bat cell cultures in a dose-dependent manner. Similar to other studies using MERS-CoV-resistant (non-bat) cell lines transfected with CD26/DPP4 [19] , expression of human CD26/DPP4 in resistant bat cells rendered these cell lines susceptible to infection. Finally, we demonstrate that persistent MERS-CoV infections can be established in permissive bat cell lines after sequential virus passage, leading to downregulation of natural CD26/DPP4 cellsurface expression. Together, our data indicate that the host cell tropism of MERS-CoV may largely depend on the expression of suitable CD26/DPP4 orthologs, and that bats cannot be excluded as MERS-CoV reservoirs at this point in time.",

Importantly, cellular susceptibility to MERS-CoV infection not only depends on the expression of CD26/DPP4, but also on its sequence. For instance, five amino-acid variations in the MERS-CoV-binding domain of hamster, ferret, and mouse CD26/DPP4 compared to human CD26/DPP4 have been linked to the resistance of hamster, ferret, and mouse cell lines to MERS-CoV infection [22] .

Bat cells that tested negative for CD26/DPP4 expression by flow cytometry using the polyclonal anti-human CD26/DPP4 antibody may possibly express a CD26/DPP4 ortholog that is not recognized by this antibody.

We hypothesize that this variation may be due to differences in the number of bat CD26/DPP4 molecules on the cell-surface of each bat cell. For instance, overexpression of human CD26/DPP4 in a bat cell line with naturally high bat CD26/ DPP4 surface expression may not have an effect on virion entry efficiency since all virions already find enough binding partners in the untransfected cell. Vice versa, if a bat cell line expresses little CD26/DPP4, finding a binding partner would present a bottleneck for MERS-CoV virions, and overexpression of human CD26/DPP4 might overcome this bottleneck and thereby increase virus yield. Second, we hypothesize that overexpression of human CD26/DPP4 may interfere with transport and/or functionality of certain bat CD26/DPP4 orthologs due to heterodimerization and consequent structural changes.",

A number of zoonotic viruses are known to persistently and subclinically infect rodents (e.g., arenaviruses, hantaviruses) or bats (henipaviruses), which then directly or indirectly infect humans [17, [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] . Among the betacoronaviruses, the group of coronaviruses including MERS-CoV, murine coronavirus and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses that are related to MERS-CoV, are known to cause persistent infection in their mammalian hosts [16, 32] . During persistent SARS-CoV infection in Vero E6 cells and also during acute infection in laboratory mice, the SARS-CoV entry receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), is downregulated [33, 34] . ACE2 downregulation contributes to the severity of lung pathology of SARS [34] .",

The observation that cultures continued to release significant virion amounts on day 63 post-inoculation, but also exhibited low to absent CD26/DPP4 cell-surface expression, is consistent with receptor downregulation as one mechanism for persistent infection with MERS-CoV in our experiments. Virus carryover between cell/virus passages probably did not influence these results as excreted viruses should be unable to re-infect cells in the absence of CD26/DPP4 receptor. The mechanism of CD26/DPP4 downregulation upon persistent MERS-CoV infection requires further study. Western blot-based examination of lysates of persistently infected cells at day 63 indicate that CD26/DPP4 is either not expressed anymore or is very efficiently degraded ( Figure 5G ).",

If CD26/DPP4-positive cells of bats become infected with MERS-CoV and if subsequently the receptor surface expression is downregulated as we observe in our experiments, a persistent infection could be established. Such animals may provide a reservoir that continuously sheds infectious virus, possibly transmitting the virus to other mammals, such as dromedaries. Further evaluation is needed to determine whether downregulation of CD26/DPP4 is a general hallmark of persistent MERS-CoV infection in animal models of MERS and whether the receptor influences pathogenesis in a manner similar to that seen with ACE2 downregulation in persistent SARS-CoV infection.

Transient expression of human CD26/DPP4 in these bat cell lines supported MERS-CoV replication as evidenced by increased viral yields compared to those measured in the same cell line transfected with empty control plasmid (Figure 4A). These results were confirmed by IFA using the same cells stained against MERS-CoV spike protein or CD26/DPP4 (Figure 4B). The merged immunofluorescent images clearly indicate the colocalization of MERS-CoV spike protein and CD26/DPP4 (Figure 4C). Thus, the restriction of MERS-CoV infection in the resistant bat cell lines may be determined by the absence of CD26/DPP4. Overexpression of human CD26/ DPP4 in already susceptible bat cell lines led to an increase in virus yield in some bat cell lines (EpoNi/22.1, HypLu/45.1, RoNi/7.1, RoNi/7.2) or to a decrease in virus yield in other susceptible bat cell lines (EiD/41.3, HypNi/1.1,",

To investigate whether MERS-CoV can establish persistent infections in bats on the cellular level, we infected susceptible bat cell lines (i.e., EidNi/ 41.3, EpoNi/22.1, HypLu/45.1, HypNi/1.1, RoNi/7.1, RoNi/ 7.2) with MERS-CoV/EMC or MERS-CoV/Jor, and serially passaged these cells weekly for a total of 9 weeks (63 days). Persistent infection, as indicated by viral yields determined by plaque assay, was achieved in EidNi/41.3, EpoNi/22.1, HypNi/ 1.1, and HypLu/45.1 cell lines, control Vero E6 cells inoculated with MERS-CoV/EMC (Figure 5A), and EidNi/41.3 and EpoNi/22.1 cell lines inoculated with MERS-CoV/Jor (Figure 5B). Immunofluorescent images taken on day 33 after staining against MERS-CoV spike protein also confirm persistent infection in the same cell lines (Figure 5C, 5D). Intracellular viral particles, virion budding, and virion egress from EidNi/41.3 and EpoNi/ 22.1 cells and control Vero E6 cells are clearly visible on TEM images acquired at day 56 post-exposure (Figure 5E). Flow cytometry was used to determine CD26/DPP4 cell-surface expression in EidNi/41.3 and control Vero E6 cells before virus exposure and at study endpoint (day 63) by incubation with an antibody against human CD26/DPP4 (Figure 5F). Prior to exposure of EidNi/41.3 cells to MERS-CoV, CD26/DPP4 expression (red line) was higher than that observed for isotypic IgG control (black line), confirming CD26/DPP4 cell-surface expression as shown previously (Figure 2). At day 63, CD26/ DPP4 expression was nearly absent in EidNi/41.3 cells. At the same time point in control Vero E6 cells, CD26/DPP4 expression was decreased but still detected in cells inoculated with MERS-CoV/EMC, whereas surface expression of CD26/DPP4 could barely be detected in cells inoculated with MERS-CoV/Jor. Western blot analysis of EidNi/41.3 cells persistently infected with either MERS-CoV/EMC or MERS-CoV/Jor (day 63) also demonstrated no or minimal expression of CD26/DPP4 (Figure 5G).",
