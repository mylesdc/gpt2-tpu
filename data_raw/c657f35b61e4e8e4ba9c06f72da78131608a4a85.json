As demonstrated in the work of Deacon on the 'globalization of social policy', global social policy has been animated and debated not only at the multilateral level but at the regional level as well. But at least in the diplomatic literature, the importance of this regional dynamic (with a focus on diverse sites and actors and the pursuit of democratic control) has been missed. The objective of this article is to explore whether health diplomacy is catching up to this larger debate reshaping the conceptualization and practice of diplomacy more generally. In some ways, the results may be counter-productive in that this shift may encourage an increasingly fragmented process. Yet, it may also point to some breakthroughs, with diplomats, acting as 'go to' personnel on the front lines of operational activity, enabling actors to integrate with one another to produce effective governance. In doing so, the regional dimension is given greater recognition as a component of health diplomacy, albeit in an uneven and sometimes awkward manner. Whereas global diplomacy generally emphasizes problem solving, the regional dimension is animated by a normative orientation.",

            "text": "In some ways, health diplomacy is still highly 'state centric', states at the apex of the global system viewing health as an arena that is increasingly linked to national interests and the defense of sovereignty. This trend has been somehow reinforced by recent cases of pandemics as health became a matter of securing borders as much as societies. This view gave substance to the 'securitization' of health (Rushton, 2010) , with issues such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or Avian influenza being treated as threats to national security. The state-centric approach seemed resilient to the increasing role and presence of civil society organizations (CSOs), such as M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res/ Doctors without Borders (MSF) and other social organizations as well as philanthropies, operating autonomously on the front lines of epidemics, such as Ebola, compensating for measures and a focus beyond that of 'protecting own borders' (MSF, 2014) . What this suggests is that although the hold of the state remains strong in some areas of health diplomacy, in other areas there are signs of adaptability and willingness to share responsibilities. Yet dynamics in health diplomacy are mainly driven by problem-solving and issue-specific forms of networking, cast as a guide to tactical solutions to (global) health problems.",

Although highly driven by what Robert Cox (1981) termed as problem solving, that is, driven by specific ways of tackling a (globalized) medical/epidemiological problem, the diplomatic camp is no longer a privilege of the traditional professional state diplomats representing government foreign affairs departments. The late 20th century witnessed the rising awareness of, and cluster of, new trans-border issues that transformed the practice of diplomacy in international relations. Furthermore, the state-centric focus proved to be limited in addressing such issues, opening the way to innovative normative and practical grounds redefining opportunities to think and practice health governance in '21st century diplomacy'.",

Many CSOs, for example, brought public attention onto many emerging critical social issues for policy change well before a state policy response was initiated in addressing them. Most notably, communitylevel action prompted the exigency of a national response for HIV/AIDS issue well before any official state-level response was initiated in Africa (The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS [UNAIDS], 1997).",

This is when an issue becomes 'sticky', with calls for more than ad hoc responses, in the order of long-term solutions with ample space for multiple actors, and institutional norms and regime complexes (Raustiala and Victor, 2004: 279) . Sticky issues demonstrate that states do not have exclusive 'ownership' of an issue in the 21st century. Sticky issues have its own 'self', autonomous of how a country's foreign policy is shaped. It involves a multitude of actors in the process of its governance and diplomacy. In other words, an issue is the content of diplomacy; context is the event that animates the issues into life; and multitude actors are the agents that fragment global governance. What it implies is that certain issues due to their complex and ongoing nature serve as a catalyst for a focused, albeit at times divergent, set of global responses.",

As a result, issue-specific CSOs may be in direct conflict with traditional state authorities. Indeed the contrast in normative positions acts to 'push' state and non-state actors further away from each other (see Figure 1 ). The 'push' effect is a natural tendency for the diverging actors in claiming the opposite pole to differentiate themselves notably on the question of the extent to which sovereign rights are defended or bypassed.",

            "text": "Fragmentation on health diplomacy is caused by the emergence of a multitude of actors. Actors, whether they are states, international governmental organizations (IGOs), international non-governmental organizations (INGOs), international organization (IOs), or CSOs emerge only when they acquire identities, which are shaped by and founded on their interests, functions, and policy around an issue. In terms of further analysis at the micro-level, the ideational affiliation of actors in international relations prior to their 'emergence' was 'there' but was not ontologically observable. Only when they became 'fleshed out' with missions, objectives, and modes of organizations did they effectively emerge as an actor. However, this type of actor emerges only in relation to other actors, mobilizes resources with different missions and objectives compared to that of others, and tries to accomplish something in relation to others. Therefore, in functional terms, although divergence in issue-interest 'pushes' actors into opposite poles, there is a tendency among actors to 'pull' each other together in achieving a negotiated result because of the exigency of an issue (see Figure 2 ). Modern diplomacy is that 'pull' effect that builds partnership through negotiation, dialogues, and cooperation among a diversity of actors. The 'pull' effect in diplomacy, in effect, integrates fragmented international relations through a network of governance. As a result, the push-pull effect creates an inverted-U effect of this 21st century diplomacy in an increasingly fragmented world ( Figure 3 ). In terms of timing, the pull effect may be a matter of a few years in some cases or a few decades in others. The pull effect between actors may result in a weak or a strong connection depending on how successful the negotiation is. Sometimes other actors act as a catalyst in initiating that pull effect which is in effect dialogue and negotiation between the diverging actors. IGOs often play that role when the IGO leaders press for a resolution to address an issue among its member states.",

The diplomats are one of the many instrumental figures who are the 'go to' persons or the intermediaries and maintain those nodes. The nodes were predominantly among the states until the late 20th century in international relations. As such, states were the only powerful actors, diplomats were state-officials with traditional rules and customary conducts, diplomacy was 'club-like' with strong statecraft characteristics, and the nodal connections were mostly hierarchical. In the 21st century world, though, all nodes not necessarily direct toward states, rather they are poly-lateral; states are not the only powerful actors albeit still significant; diplomats are intermediaries who are not only state-officials; diplomacy is more than statecraft, with a mix of statecraft and society craft; and the nodal connections among the actors are more horizontal. The result is that 'club diplomacy' is supplemented by 'network diplomacy' (Heine, 2008: 272-277) , where the institutional form for non-state actor is more resilient, horizontal information and resource mobilization are fluid, and clusters of networks are firmly 'tied' (Burris, Drahos and Shearing, 2005: 38) to nodes that act as a focal point for sticky issues.",

            "text": "Indeed, the emergence of unofficial (non-state) diplomats was a significant product of the process of fragmentation. The classic work of Hedley Bull (1977) did, to be sure, point to this phenomenon in its definition of diplomats by opening the way for a much broader categorization such that diplomacy not only includes the conduct of official relations by states but 'other entities with standing in world politics ' (p. 162 ). Yet, as argued elsewhere, it took the structural and systemic contradistinction between the fragmenting global governance and the traditional diplomacy (Cooper et al., 2008 : 2) to accelerate and diversify this process. In essence, forces on the ground caught up to conceptual possibilities, with the emergence of unofficial diplomats willing and able to fill in that 'void' created by the inadequacies of traditional diplomacy based on statecraft, which indeed is the embedded 'pull' effect of the fragmented international relations. Writing how diplomacy is changing in the presence of multiple actors in polycentric governance, Scholte (2008: 55-59) has argued that in the 21st century diplomacy, representation covers many more actors, communication handles faster speeds and larger volumes from multiple technological tools, and negotiation addresses an increasing range of diverse political parties and identities. Amid this increasing fragmentation in the relocation of authority in the pattern of diplomacy (Kelley, 2010: 295) , however, the regional dimension has received less attention. In part, this is due to both the perception and reality that regional organizations -or at least those in the global South -lacked problem-solving capacity. However, the gap is also a function of the contest between the problem-solving orientation of diplomacy at the apex of the global level and the dynamics at the regional level that highlight the need for the regional dimension as a driver for social redistribution and a set of expanded social regulations. Whereas the core of the problem-solving global diplomatic agenda has been heavily focused on pandemics, regional dynamics have concentrated on the extension of social rights. Indeed, even when there is an emphasis on lesson learning, the focus has often been on finding solutions involving equity (such as in the area of producing cheaper generic pharmaceuticals).",

Health issues are still emerging and under-analyzed in the nexus between governance and diplomacy. Figure 4 shows that there have been multiple negotiations on critical global health issues in the last 10 years, which were triggered by the catalytic effect of a series of health emergencies. Therefore, global health governance is still at a formative stage and health diplomacy is very much in the transitional stage of practice in dealing, negotiating, and managing emerging health issues at different levels of governance (Lee and Smith, 2011; Novotny and Kevany, 2013) . This process is constantly demonstrating that health diplomacy is more than about public health itself. Zucker (2012) wrote, Public health negotiations are often about everything but public health. As such one much bring in the expertise from other domains including, international treaty law, finance ministries, trade delegations, foreign affairs, international security, and any other areas that are linked to the issues at hand. (pp. 273-274) The pull effect in the practice of health diplomacy increasingly appears to be strong among the NGOs, networking with state and global and local actors. As stated by Low-Beer (2012), 'a major trend since 2000 has been a shift to a wider \"partnership approach\" to delivering health aid, bringing together governments, private sector, civil society, private foundations and multilaterals, sometimes shouting and sometimes kicking' (p. 23). Nevertheless, a multitude of actors also bring divergence in preferences and uncertainty in negotiation processes. Health diplomacy thus involves a multitude of inter-dependent actors, involved in poly-lateral diplomacy, and issues that create opportunities for partnership as well as conflict of interest.",

For instance, African regional organizations such as South African Development Community (SADC) and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) have engaged with some limited success in addressing HIV/ AIDS problem (Lisk, 2008: 160-161; Deacon et al., 2010 passim; see also Penfold and Fourie, this issue) .

Utilizing the 'Strengthening Independent Immunization and Vaccine Advisory Committees' (SIVAC) initiative, AMP collaborated with the West African Health Organization (WAHO), the health branch of ECOWAS, to provide global recommendations to all countries in West Africa, especially with the establishment of National Immunization Technical Advisory Groups (NITAGs; Mengel et al., 2014) . In South America, there is a long tradition of regional cooperation in health that can be traced to the establishment of the Pan-American Health Organization in 1902, but that is gaining new traction with the establishment of the Union of South American Nations in 2008 (see Herrero and Tussie, this issue; Riggirozzi, 2015) .",

NGOs and regional organizations are often at a disadvantage in terms of outreach and institutional capacity, as well as in terms of depth and experience in international law to effectively influence negotiation process in health-related issues (Taylor and Dhillon, 2011) . For instance, health diplomacy is profoundly affected by legal considerations during negotiation process. Trade negotiations such as the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) and Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) include critical legal implications on generic drug production, public health services, price control of essential medicines, and market regulations. Indeed, the legal matters on trade affect multiple health negotiations simultaneously. During the negotiation on influenza virus sharing with Indonesia, France, the United Kingdom, and a few other countries indicated that the interdisciplinary working group (IDWG), formed by the World Health Organization (WHO), could not debate the intellectual property rights (IPR) issues as the WHO member states were waiting for a report from another negotiation on IPR (Lange, 2011: 138-139) . Often changes in texts from 'should' to 'shall' stall last minute negotiations due to the legal implications associated with them, let alone the disagreements in legal niceties as evident from the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) negotiation (Bernard, 2012: 68) .",

The Gates Foundation is not only a larger health donor than all governments, except for the United States and the United Kingdom (McCoy et al., 2009 ), but it is also a crucial participant in negotiations across a wide spectrum from the 'Health 8' coordinating group to its 1.5 billion dollar contribution to the G8's 2010 Muskoka Initiative on Maternal, Newborn, and Child Health (Fidler, 2013: 701) . Significantly, the regional dimension is coming into focus in this domain. For example, in a meeting between the African Development Bank President Donald Kaberuka and Bill Gates, co-chair and trustee of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, discussions were held on ways to cooperate on a range of issues from vaccine delivery to sanitation, to Ebola (African Development Bank Group, 2014) . Constant efforts to improve epidemiological surveillance at the regional level are also evident from the earlier experience of the United States and the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) helping setting up Polymerase Chain Reaction machines in Mexico for molecular diagnostics, signing a trilateral agreement of cooperation under the Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America, and more so after recent emerging disease outbreaks in Africa where a network of laboratories in Kenya and Ghana are key pillars of disease surveillance (Farooq and Majowicz, 2013: 40-41) .",

Power differentials between the developed and developing countries is historical that goes back to the colonial period. As a result, the low-income countries often negotiate as a bloc against the developed countries, which, however, is not unique to health diplomacy. Nevertheless, the 'right to health' provision, public health emergency due to AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, and other diseases in developing countries, and high price of life-saving drugs and vaccines show the developing countries have vested interest to strongly contest negotiations with the developed countries who have the technological advantage, financial resources, and host the big pharmaceutical firms with preferential access to drugs and vaccine production during public health emergency. 1 Under the GATS terms, market access liberalization restricts developing countries from providing critical health services through public sector, providing incentives to domestic firms over foreign companies, regulating the health sector, and managing the cost of essential health services (Mukhtar, 2012: 31-33) . The Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) also is a major concern for the developing countries because pharmaceutical patent would prevent generic drug production, which is vital to address various epidemics in developing countries. Therefore, during negotiation on these issues, developing countries 'generally act together as one block, assigning a delegate from one country in the block to speak on behalf of all countries in the block' (Mukhtar, 2012: 35) . 2 During the IHR negotiation process, disagreement on the Annex 2 of the final text of IHR (2005) clearly demonstrated divergence between the North and the South, where the developing countries argued that unless a list of diseases were specified in the IHR texts, they would be unable to get necessary financial support for disease surveillance (Katz and Muldoon, 2012: 92) .",

The delegate from Thailand said that he 'might just be a small sparrow, but he was not afraid of the big eagle'. Clearly, the eagle being a symbol of America, was a reference to the United States' position on intellectual property rights. (p. 263) The pull effect weakens when a lack of institutional capacity within the developing countries acts as a functional problem. It challenges the South making the most efficient use of their resources in health diplomacy. Furthermore, institutional incapacity challenges the developing countries with transactional cost to implement negotiated agreements. Negotiation in health-related issues often requires a wide array of experts skilled in legal, scientific, political, trade, and public health topics. Health diplomacy, which often includes arduous, long, and expensive negotiation process, spanning multiple years and involving multiple simultaneous negotiations, is a disadvantage for the developing countries that do not have enough financial and human resources to address domestic health problems, let alone the ability to send enough skilled officials with a wide array of expertise in all international negotiations.",

Indonesia claimed -although unsuccessfully -that pathogens were their sovereign right under the Rio Biodiversity convention (Vezzani, 2010) . Similarly, during the negotiation of the IHR (2005), several states were not willing to discontinue certain national public health measures that were not supported by scientific studies. Katz and Muldoon (2012) wrote, 'The states viewed this as an infringement on their sovereignty because it would prevent them from exercising public health authority within their own borders' (p. 89). Other points that were debated during the negotiation on the ground of sovereign right included WHO's surveillance system that depends on third-party sources, definition of disease, border control, and inclusion of chemical, radiological, biological, and nuclear events in the revised IHR draft (Katz and Muldoon, 2012: 88-91) .",

However, China's shift in policy after SARS outbreak embracing greater openness and multilateral cooperation also points to its realization that security benefit is higher in cooperation than withholding information in fear of economic loss (Schwartz and Schwartz, 2010) . Success in health diplomacy is subject to a state's security incentives to cooperate. However, states also like to keep reservation for their national security. Therefore, global security interest can effectively work as a 'pull' effect when soft-binding negotiated clauses or outcomes accommodate reservations for national interest.",

Such a dynamic may accentuate the gap between the problem-solving approach favored by the core actors in the global system and, in so doing, reinforce the differences vis-a-vis the North and the Global South. The advantage, nonetheless, is that new avenues are opening up about the possibilities of health diplomacy as an agent of transformation in terms of social justice. In declaratory terms, the call for bringing the regional dimension has been building for a considerable length of time (see Yeates and Deacon, 2010, and 'Introduction' to this Special Issue) . More recently, Yeates (2014b) points toward the possibility of ambitious regional mechanisms including regional social funds and regional social rights in supporting the implementation of the Social Protection Floor (SPF) Initiative.",

            "text": "Still in terms of practice, the expansion of regional organizations directly into health diplomacy has lagged behind other manifestations of diplomatic change. The Caribbean Community and Common Market (CARICOM), for instance, has developed some guidelines for regional capacity for issues such as human resource capacity and communicative diseases (Yeates and Deacon, 2010) though Yeates (2010 Yeates ( , 2014b argues that there are tensions in the region between approaches that privilege the production of health workers for 'export' and those that favor regional self-sufficiency. It may be misleading to suggest that the disconnect between the declaratory and the operational necessarily stymies momentum for the regional dimension in health diplomacy. Rather, it signals forcefully the salience of the contest between two types of diplomacy: the problem-solving diplomacy at the core of the approach favored by the actors at the apex of the global system, and the normatively driven approach advocated by a number of regional actors in the global South. The developments in health diplomacy with respect to the regional dimension reveal the salience of this normative contribution. In light of this, Yeates (2014b: 3) argues that many of these regional social policies have progressed faster as exhortative declarations of aims and principles rather than as binding regulatory or redistributive mechanisms. However, it is important to note the symbolic and practical uses of exhortative policy (such as Social Charters and other declarations of intent) in creating greater awareness of a range of common issues and a world of possibilities on a wider front. Exhortative policy may not have 'teeth' but it is nonetheless vital in contributing to the forging of transnational political alliances and political dynamics that may in turn stimulate more substantive forms of regional cooperation and action (Yeates, 2014a) .",
