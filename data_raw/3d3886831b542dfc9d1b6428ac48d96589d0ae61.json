Most methods used the epidemic curve and the generation time distribution. Two categories of methods were available: those estimating the initial reproduction number, and those estimating a time dependent reproduction number. We implemented five methods as an R library, developed sensitivity analysis tools for each method and provided numerical illustrations of their use. A comparison of the performance of the different methods on simulated datasets is reported. Conclusions: This software package allows a standardized and extensible approach to the estimation of the reproduction number and generation interval distribution from epidemic curves.",

The largest R-squared value corresponds to the period over which the model of analysis fitted the data best: we select this period to provide estimates.

The epidemic was started with one incident case at time t=0, then for each incident case, the number of secondary cases was sampled from a negative binomial distribution with mean \u03b2 I and variance k \u03b2 I, where I was the individual's duration of infectious period, \u03b2 the effective contact rate, and k the overdispersion parameter. The actual time of infection of secondary cases was sampled uniformly during the infectious period of the index case. In this model, the reproduction number is R = \u03b2 E(I), so that it was possible to calibrate \u03b2 to obtain the desired value of R.

Other methods are not affected, provided the maximum generation time is longer than the gap. When the data was aggregated in time periods up to twice the mean generation time, only the exponential growth method remained unbiased. Indeed, it has previously been reported that aggregation in time periods of 1 mean generation time width was ideal for estimation, and corrections proposed for larger time intervals [21] .

The attack rate method requires the least information, but is only usable when the epidemic is over, and furthermore requires that no intervention was set up during the whole course of an outbreak. Therefore its use is generally limited to particular settings like schools or army platoons, for example [22] . All other methods require the epidemic curve and the generation time distribution, with the 'initial' reproduction ratio as an output. If one assumes that the population was totally susceptible at first, it may also be interpreted as the basic reproduction ratio (R0); a correction will be necessary in the case of a initial partial immunity. With a truly emerging outbreak, prior knowledge on the generation time distribution may be unavailable. Allowing sensitivity analyses according to the mean generation time, as we described, is therefore important to help quantify uncertainty in this respect. In other cases, estimation of the generation time distribution is relatively straightforward from pairs of infectors/infectees if there is a marked separation between generations; it is more complicated when generations quickly overlap as with influenza [23] . An additional issue is that symptom onset dates may be known only to an interval, requiring specialized methods for estimation [24] .

In practice, one may wait for data consolidation before applying any method, but it would also be possible to correct for this bias before estimating the reproduction number if the reporting delay is known [14, 26] .",

An exception was the EG method, with upward bias for small R values (R<2) and downwards bias for larger values. When incidence data was available on a daily basis, i.e. smaller than the generation time distribution, the characteristics of the four methods compared. The EG method was the least sensitive to changes in aggregation window, while the ML and TD methods were rapidly inconsistent. The SB method was generally not better than the EG method. Best practice in case of an emerging epidemic will likely depend on a combination of reproduction ratio magnitude, mean generation time duration and aggregation detail. We have provided the framework that would allow comparison and critic of these estimates.",
