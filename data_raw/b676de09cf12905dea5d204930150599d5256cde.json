            "text": "single compound indicator in seeking to increase performance. However, these systems suffer from two problems. First, if an outbreak of a new disease occurs during a larger outbreak of a known disease, it might not be noticed. For instance, imagine if a new disease causes fever. People with this disease might purchase thermometers. However, if an outbreak of this new disease occurs during a large outbreak of influenza the increased thermometer sales due to the new disease would be overshadowed by the number of thermometer sales due to influenza. Second, they assume that the future will be like the past, and that outbreaks of influenza and other known diseases occur at the same time each year. For instance, suppose that the system expects increased thermometer sales during the month of January because that is when outbreaks of influenza typically occur but, in fact, there is no January outbreak of influenza in the current year. Then, an increase in thermometer sales in January due to an outbreak of a new disease might well be attributed to the expected outbreak of influenza and dismissed. The WSARE (What's Strange About Recent Events) system [10] addresses these issues by representing the joint distribution of patient data with a Bayesian network that includes several environmental attributes to represent influenza activity, season, weather, etc. and several response attributes to represent patient attributes such as age, gender, location, and reported symptom (which is similar to a patient's chief complaint and takes a value from none, respiratory problems, nausea, or rash). The network is conditioned on the current values of the enviromental attributes to create a conditional joint distribution of response variables for the current day. Thus, the conditional joint distribution represents what would be expected for the current day if there are no outbreaks of new diseases. Thus, WSARE does not take a strictly technical approach to predicting cyclic patterns, but rather incorporates current conditions. The WSARE system then searches for rules that describe significant differences between the actual current data and the conditional joint distribution. For instance, if there are many patients with fever in the current data, but the conditional joint distribution predicted few patients with fever, WSARE would report this. The WSARE system has two important shortcomings, however. First, as with time-series methods, if an outbreak of a new disease occurs during a large outbreak of influenza it might not be noticed. Second, it can be misled by outbreaks of other known diseases such as RSV, parainfluenza, hMPV, etc. For instance, if the environmental attribute influenza activity is low, but there is an outbreak of RSV, the resulting surge of patients with respiratory ailments would cause a false alarm. (We note that these shortcomings could be corrected by adding additional enviromental attributes for each known disease and additional response attributes for a set of clinical findings sufficient to distinguish between different respiratory illnesses).",

[12] describes a semantic scan sytem that infers a set of topics (probability distributions over words) from the free-text of chief complaints. The system learns one set of topics using past data and a second set of topics from the most recent 3-hour moving window, assigns each patient case to its most likely topic, then looks for anomalous counts and clusters of topics.

[14] describes a Bayesian system, based on moving windows of ILI records, to detect a period of exponential growth that can signal the start of an outbreak. That system uses Bayes' factors to determine when it is likely that an outbreak has started. This paper describes a Bayesian modeling approach called DUDE (Detection of Unmodeled Diseases from Evidence) that can recognize outbreaks of new forms of influenza-like illness (ILI) and create clinical characterizations of them. We demonstrate its operation on data from real-world outbreaks including an outbreak of Enterovirus EV-D68. DUDE avoids the shortcomings of previous sytems by building probabilistic models of normal (baseline) ILI activity using a large set of patient findings extracted from patient-care reports using natural language processing. (This approach to ILI detection and characterization was developed in [15] ). It then looks for statistically significant deviations from baseline normal activity. Thus, DUDE does not rely on just a small set of findings (as might be extracted from patients' chief complaints). Also, it does not model temporal patterns and therefore does not assume that the present is like the past. Finally, by removing cases of known forms of ILI (such as influenza, RSV, etc.) from the input data, it can recognize new, emergent kinds of ILI.",

DUDE collects statistics about rates of symptoms among patients in the baseline window to model background ILI. The monitor window includes patient records from a later time period. DUDE then computes the likelihood of the data in the monitor period assuming that only background ILI is present, and the likelihood of the data in the monitor period assuming that both background ILI and a different unmodeled ILI is present. We then compute the odds that an unmodeled ILI is present. Note that our data are collected in hospitals. The number of patients with a disease who go to a hospital is certainly related to the number of cases in the general population. Even if this is a simple linear relationship it is hidden since we have no way to directly count the number of people in the general population with a disease We avoid the difficulty of determining this relationship by working solely with ED data.",

Ideally, the first alarm is generated on the first day of an outbreak (and each subsequent day while the outbreak is ongoing). Given data for an outbreak year that contains an outbreak of an unmodeled disease, and a specific value for the alarm threshold, the number of false alarms is the number of alarms before the start of the outbreak.

This suggests that we can increase the effectiveness of DUDE by concentrating atypical patients in the monitor window and using them for detection. We have developed a heuristic method to do this. First, we compute the probability of each finding using all of the patients in the monitor window.

Then, for comparison, we do the same with the patients in the baseline window to create a new baseline window comprised of the least likely patients.",

Note that the AMOC graph corresponding to the 30% heuristically selected patients is lower at nearly every point than the AMOC curve without heuristic patient selection. This means that given thresholds for each approach that led to a particular number of false alarms, the heuristic approach will almost always have fewer days to detection. (We also applied this heuristic using the 10%, 50%, 70%, and 90% most atypical patients and obtained similar, but less, improvement). Although this heuristic worked well with the assumed unmodeled outbreaks (influenza, RSV, parainfluenza, and hMPV) for the five years of data we used, it failed to identify the unmodeled outbreak near day 106 of 2014-2015 that was identified by DUDE when it used all patient records. Although the likelihood of the presence of an unmodeled outbreak did increase slightly it never exceeded 1 indicating that the presence of an unmodeled disease was likely.",

The new disease might differ in an obvious way, such as displaying a rare symptom, or more subtly, such as in new combinations or rates of common symptoms. By design, DUDE identifies sets of cases with rates of symptoms that are statistically different from a baseline of earlier cases. However, it does this with a limited set of medical findings. While this highlights DUDE's ability to identify outbreaks of diseases such as EV-D68 merely from common symptoms, it potentially misses diseases that are characterized by the presence of unusual symptoms (such as paralysis which is associated with EV-D68 [22] ). To be more effective, DUDE will need access to a much wider range of symptoms than it currently uses. Of course, by using a large set of findings we risk overfitting, so this must be done in a probabilistically sound way.",

DUDE compares the set of cases in the monitor window with a baseline set of cases and generates an alarm if the presence of an unmodeled disease better explains the difference than simple variation. However, this ignores the daily increase in the number of cases of the unmodeled disease. It would be better if DUDE generated an alarm when it detects an increasing number of cases of an unmodeled disease. Doing so would increase the computational complexity since it will need to search over (the parameters of) a set of increasing curves and their start dates, but this can be ameliorated by heuristics that favor increasing disease curves that match increasing numbers of findings.",

A better approach would be to probabilistically model each of the known diseases and compute the daily expected number of each disease in the entire dataset. We could then compute the expected number of each finding-assuming that no unmodeled disease is present-then find the likelihood of an unmodeled disease based on how the actual distributions of findings differ from what would be expected if no unmodeled disease is present.",
