This approach cannot provide a complete description of viruses in circulation in the community. A proportion of the infections will be asymptomatic or not severe enough to require medical attention, and, respiratory virus infections are typically of short duration. Hence, a full ecological/epidemiological description requires frequent sampling of individuals in a population regardless of symptoms, which is rarely undertaken. As a result, our understanding of seasonality, persistence patterns, and transmission dynamics of most respiratory viruses at the community level remains uncertain. Increased sensitivity and range of pathogens detectable by molecular diagnostics over traditional methods (culture isolation or antigen detection) [1] [2] [3] enable enhanced studies of a wide range of respiratory viruses in otherwise healthy populations.",

The intensive surveillance provided detailed infection data that allowed comprehensive investigation of the circulation of the respiratory viruses in the community.

Identifying who infects the infant with RSV in the household was the primary objective of the study [6] . Households were eligible if they had an infant born since the end of the previous RSV epidemic in the study location and at least 1 older sibling (aged <13 years). The study period spanned 1 complete RSV season [6] . Deep NPS collections were requested from all household members irrespective of symptoms, once weekly in the first 4 weeks and subsequently twice weekly for the remainder of the study period.

            "text": "Over the 6-month study period, the number of individuals with at least 1 infection of any of the target viruses, RV, AdV, HCoV, RSV, PIV, HMPV, and influenza were 75 (93.8%), 62 (77.5%), 57 (71.3%), 58 (72.5%), 52 (65.0%), 37 (46.3%), 11 (13.8%), and 8 (10.0%), respectively. The corresponding number of symptomatic infections of those ever infected, by pathogen, was 46 (61.3%), 33 (53.2%), 26 (45.6%), 29 (50.0%), 25 (45.5%), 11 (29.7%), 2 (18.1%), and 4 (50.0%), respectively. RV, AdV, HCoV, and RSV were the most prevalent respiratory viruses. They were each found in all the 6 households, infecting at least 1 member and were taken forward as the prevalent targets for screening of the NPS collection from the remaining 41 households. The temporal infection profile for the 6 households showing positive samples for each member is shown in Figure 1 . The frequency distribution of the viruses circulating in the community during the study period are shown for the 6 households with full respiratory virus screen vs the 47 households with select respiratory screen in Figure 2A and 2B, respectively. For comparison, Figure 2C illustrates the frequency distribution of virus infections in pediatric (<5 years old) pneumonia admissions to Kilifi County Hospital over the same period [6] , showing a markedly higher frequency of RV, RSV, HMPV, and PIV3 detections than in the households.",

Throughout the study, adenoviruses had a consistently high prevalence with no apparent peak times. The prevalence of RV was at its peak in January, gradually declined over the study period, and was at its lowest at the end of May 2010. The observed seasonal patterns were evident even after aggregating the data to assess the weekly detection rates of the viruses at sample, individual, or household level ( Figure 4 ). From the 6 households with full respiratory virus screen, similar seasonal patterns were observed, albeit with greater variability (Supplementary Figure 2) . The PIVs, influenza viruses, and HMPV were rarely detected throughout the 6-month study period (Supplementary Figure 2) , and this was also observed from the hospital virus surveillance (Supplementary Figure 1) .",

The groupings based on age were closely related to those based on the relationship to the study infant; hence, the pattern of attack rates according to relationships was similar to that of the age groups (Table 3 and Supplementary  Table 1 ). Notably, the attack rates regardless of symptoms in mothers were higher than in fathers for all the studied viruses, and this was significant statistically (P = .04). There were no statistically significant differences in the attack rates regardless of symptoms by sex and school-going status (Table 3 ). However, for the symptomatic infections the attack rates for RSV were significantly higher in males than in females (26.6% vs 18.2%; P = .026). The attack rates by household sizes varied by pathogen and illness status. Households with fewer household members (4-7 individuals) had higher attack rates than larger households that were statistically significant for RV, HCoV, and RSV irrespective of symptoms. For symptomatic infections, only RSV showed a significant association by household size (Supplementary Table 1 ).",

This demonstrates the extraordinarily enabling environment for virus spread coherent with earlier reports for RSV infections [5] [6] [7] .

Given the close contacts of individuals in the households, the participants' exposure to the investigated respiratory viruses was high: >95% of the households had 1 or more members detected with RV, HCoV, and AdV. The individual attack rates declined with increasing age for most of the target pathogens, most likely due to acquisition of immunity following previous infections. School-going children are usually respiratory virus introducers to households [6, 24] , but did not seem to have higher individual attack rates compared to non-school-goers for the studied viruses. Fathers had consistently and significantly lower attack rates compared with mothers. In this community, fathers are likely to have fewer interactions with the young infants and children relative to mothers, which could partly explain the disparity in attack rates. Empirical data on contact patterns within households might help elucidate this observation. Individuals in larger households (>7 members) had lower attack rates than in smaller households, and this pattern was significant for RV, AdV, and RSV. This may be related to the structure of households, which comprise 1 or more building units, and larger occupancy would tend to have more building units, between which there may be less interaction than in a single-building household.",

First, the study was designed with a focus on RSV, and here we are presenting an observational data set from essentially a \"convenience\" sample for a small number of viruses for a short period. A surveillance over a longer period and investigating a wider range of respiratory viruses would provide more comprehensive data on virus circulation. Multiple years of study would compensate for year-toyear variation. Second, our sample was households with infants, so it might be possible that households without infants would have a lower prevalence. Third, only a small number of households had their samples subjected to full respiratory screen. Given the clustering of respiratory infections by households, it is possible that a different set of households might have resulted in an additional choice of targets for screening. However, the similarities in circulation of the respiratory viruses in the community study and the hospital surveillance do not support this view. Last, virus infection was deduced from molecular diagnostics, which do not necessarily equate with the presence of potentially infectious virus, leading to overestimation of infectiousness. Each multiplex in the molecular screen may have reduced sensitivity for detecting coinfections as compared to single-target assays.",

The molecular screen of these specimens revealed continuous and considerable respiratory virus circulation and infection frequency in this population that varied with virus species and subject age. The study here unveils previously unknown patterns of respiratory pathogen circulation in a rural low-income population. The remarkable frequency of virus infections of multiple species and strains lends itself to an ecological analysis of interactions that may be influential in virus ecology. The etiology of respiratory disease and immunological burden of respiratory viruses in children is worthy of further study. In addition, investigation on the human virome in the nasopharynx would provide insight on these viruses and how they affect human health and disease. Future studies should address the health and economic implications of these observations.",
