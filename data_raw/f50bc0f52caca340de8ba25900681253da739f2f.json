According to the organ involved, patients could present with pneumonitis, meningitis, encephalitis, myocarditis, acute pulmonary oedema, pericarditis, hepatitis and even multiple organ failure. [7] [8] [9] Respiratory distress and encephalitis are the principal cause of death in patients with severe disease. 10 Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a major global health issue and its incidence is markedly rising 11 and affects an estimated 13-18% of hospitalised patients, 12 resulting in increasing hospital stay, healthcare costs, poor short-term and long-term outcomes, 13 especially in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). 14 In patients with infectious disease, especially those with sepsis, the incidence of AKI is reported to range from 5% to 51%. 15 16 Renal involvement is not uncommon in scrub typhus, and ranges from simple haematuria or proteinuria, 10-20% incidence of scrub typhus, to severe complications, including acute renal failure, 17-20 nephrotic syndrome 21 and end-stage renal disease leading to long-term haemodialysis. 22 It is known that the incidence of AKI in scrub typhus ranges from 8% to 40% according to the classification criteria used. 17 23-26 The risk factors and prognosis of AKI associated with scrub typhus have been poorly studied. 26 We have encountered poor prognosis and long hospital stay in patients with scrub typhus if AKI was accompanied, especially in patients with comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension and CKD. Therefore, we analysed the clinical and laboratory data of AKI in patients with scrub typhus.",

Shock was defined as a systolic blood pressure \u226490 mm Hg. The method of creatinine formation was Jaffe one. RIFLE classification was first reported in 2004, whereas AKIN classification, later or modified version of 'RIFLE' classification, was reported in 2007. We have usually used the RIFLE classification for AKI incidence in our institution because it can easily be applied when the baseline serum creatinine is known and has been largely validated in terms of determining the incidence of AKI. Furthermore, since we enrolled our patients from the year 2001, we used the original version for classification of AKI. AKI was defined and categorised according to the RIFLE classification. 27 We used the serum creatinine level and eGFR to establish the RIFLE category because we had no data on the 6-hour and 12-hour urine volumes. If the baseline creatinine values were unknown, the serum creatinine was estimated using the MDRD formula and assuming eGFR=75 mL/min/1.73 m 2 as the normal value. To evaluate the incidence, risk factors and clinical outcomes of AKI associated with scrub typhus, we divided the patients into AKI and non-AKI groups. To show the distribution of AKI cases, we annually evaluated the incidence of AKI associated with scrub typhus and compared it as an interquartile. On the basis of the occurrence of AKI, we also compared the clinical and laboratory characteristics of patients with CKD among those with scrub typhus in the AKI and non-AKI groups. We evaluated the severity of AKI categorised using RIFLE in the CKD versus non-CKD group.",

Haematuria and proteinuria were more frequent in the AKI group ( p=0.005 and p=0.005, respectively), although the degree of proteinuria did not differ between the two groups. The white cell count, C reactive protein, aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase levels, and O. tsutsugamushi antibody titre did not differ between the AKI and non-AKI groups. In total, 27 patients (5.3%) had underlying CKD, of whom 19 (70.4%) developed AKI. This rate was significantly higher than that of patients without CKD (figure 1). Underlying renal function, measured using the MDRD formula, and the presence of haematuria were significant risk factors for AKI in these patients with CKD (table 2) . The severity of AKI according to the RIFLE category was significantly greater in the patients with CKD compared with patients without CKD (figure 2). In univariate analysis, time to hospital presentation after symptom onset, older age, the presence of DM, HT and CKD, and lower albumin and haemoglobin levels were significant predictors of AKI. In the multivariate analysis, time to hospital presentation after symptom onset, older age, presence of CKD and lower albumin level (<3.5 g/dL) remained independent risk factors for AKI (table 3) .",

The lower incidence of AKI (23.2% vs 35.9%) compared with our study might be explained by the difference in the age of the enrolled patients (40 vs 58 years). Age was an important predictor of AKI in our study. In addition, patients with underlying diseases such Figure 2 The comparison of AKI according to the RIFLE category in patients with CKD and non-CKD.

The underlying disease tends to increase in frequency with age. Easy access to a tertiary hospital might reduce the incidence and severity of AKI because of the regional characteristics of small areas. Our study also showed that the time from symptom onset to hospitalisation was associated with AKI incidence. The mechanism of AKI in scrub typhus is unclear. One plausible theory is that the invasion of Rickettsia induces vasculitis, leading to direct renal involvement. 18 19 However, renal biopsies have not revealed evidence of renal vasculitis associated with scrub typhus but have shown inflammation and proliferation of the glomerular tubule interstitium 4 5 and tubular necrosis due to direct involvement of tubules by Rickettsia. [17] [18] [19] Membranous nephropathy has also been demonstrated, 21 although we cannot completely rule out renal vasculitis because very few renal biopsies have been performed in scrub typhus.",

Of that, the gold standard for scrub typhus is IFA despite some limitations. Serological tests are most reliable when a fourfold rise in antibody titre is shown. 29 If the patient lives in a non-endemic area, the diagnosis can be made from a single acute serum sample to require a cut-off antibody titre. This is impossible in patients living in endemic areas because antibodies can be found in up to 18% of healthy populations. 30 A major limitation of this study was its retrospective design. In addition, since the research relied on medical records, the capacity to find other possible causes of AKI was limited and urine volume, an important factor in the RIFLE classification, could not be analysed. Therefore, the incidence of AKI might have been underestimated. However, we believe that these limitations are overcome by the large participant pool and application of many variables to the statistical analysis. It was also a single-centre study, so relatively similar laboratory values applied, most patients were followed at the same facility, and the same diagnostic criteria and treatment were used.",
