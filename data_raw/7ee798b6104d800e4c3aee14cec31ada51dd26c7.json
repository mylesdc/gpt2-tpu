In the present study, we monitored expression of this miR-36 at early time points during KSHV infection of human B and endothelial cells. We employed human B (BJAB) and endothelial (HMVEC-d) cells as they are physiologically relevant cells to KSHV biology. Expression of miR-36 gradually increased from 5 min PI and peaked at 30 min PI in KSHV infected BJAB (Fig. 1A) and HMVEC-d cells (Fig. 1B) . Uninfected BJAB and HMVEC-d cells did not express miR-36 (Fig. 1A,B) . Expression of known miRNAs, hsa-let-7c and hsa-miR-3130-5p, were not significantly altered when compared to miR-36 during early stages of KSHV infection of cells (Fig. 1A,B) . Treatment of cells with 10 units/ml of heparinase I/III for 2 h at 37 \u00b0C prior to KSHV infection of cells resulted in a significant drop in the expression of miR-36 in BJAB (Fig. 1C) and HMVEC-d cells (Fig. 1D) . Also, infection of both BJAB and HMVEC-d cells with UV.KSHV could induce the expression of miR-36 to comparable levels as the wild-type KSHV (Fig. 1C,D) . These results demonstrate KSHV to induce host cell miR-36 very early upon infection. Key features of the novel miR-36 including the secondary structure are provided in Table 1 and supplemental Fig. 1 , respectively.",

            "text": "To evaluate the biological effects of miR-36 in target cells, we analyzed the effects of miR-36 mimic and inhibitor on KSHV infection. The range of doses tested in this study is comparable to those reported in the earlier studies [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . The doses of the mimic In panels 'C and D' , Student t test was performed to study the effect of HS and compare infection of cells with KSHV versus UV.KSHV on miR-36 expression at 5, 10, 15, and 30 min PI. Two-tailed P value of 0.05 or less was considered statistically significant. *p < 0.05; **p,0.01; ***p < 0.001; NS-not significant. and inhibitor used in the study did not significantly induce cell death in BJAB and HMVEC-d cells ( Fig. 2A,B) . Transfection of BJAB (Fig. 2C ) and HMVEC-d (Fig. 2D ) cells with miR-36 mimic significantly reduced KSHV infection of cells as monitored by the expression of ORF50 gene as early as 30 min PI. KSHV entry is a quick process and the IE gene, ORF50, is expressed immediately upon infection 26 . KSHV infection was not significantly altered in BJAB (Fig. 2C ) and HMVEC-d ( Fig. 2D ) cells that were either transfected with scrambled miRNA control (miR-NC) or mock transfected. Interestingly, the effect of miR-36 mimic on KSHV infection of BJAB and HMVEC-d cells could be significantly reversed by co-transfecting cells with 10 nM of miR-36 inhibitor (Fig. 2E ). Co-transfection of cells with miR-NS did not alter the effects of miR-36 mimic (Fig. 2E ). To ascertain that the effect of miR-36 mimic was at a post-binding stage of infection, we performed a binding assay. The binding assay performed on BJAB and HMVEC-d cells demonstrated that miR-36 mimic and the miR-36 inhibitor did not block KSHV from binding the target cells (Fig. 2F ). Incubating KSHV with heparin but not CSA significantly blocked KSHV from binding cells (Fig. 2F ). Our results clearly implicate miR-36 to inhibit KSHV infection of cells. To extend our understanding of the role of miR-36 on other related viruses, we tested the effect of miR-36 mimic and the miR-36 inhibitor on EBV and HSV-2 infection of BJAB cells. Interestingly, miR-36 mimic could significantly block EBV and HSV-2 infection of BJAB cells and this inhibition could be specifically reversed by the miR-inhibitor (Fig. 3 ). miR-36 targets IFITM1. By using the DIANA and MiRmap tool algorithms, we identified a putative miR-36 binding site located in the 3\u2032-UTR of IFITM1 mRNA (Supplemental Fig. 2 ). To confirm the ability of miR-36 to specifically inhibit IFITM1 expression, we monitored the expression of IFITM1 in target cells that were untransfected, transfected with miR-36 mimic, or miR-NC prior to infection. Transfection of BJAB and HMVEC-d cells with miR-36 mimic significantly lowered the expression of IFITM1 at 15 min PI compared to untransfected cells and cells transfected with miR-NC (Fig. 4A) . Transfection of cells with miR-36 mimic could specifically inhibit IFITM1 expression from 5 min till 48 h PI (data not shown). These results authenticate the fact that IFITM1 expression may well be regulated by miR- 36. In order to determine the bona fide target of miR-36, a luciferase reporter assay was performed. In this assay, two quantifiable genes encoding luciferase proteins were put on a vector. The IFITM1 3\u2032 UTR with the target region was placed downstream GLuc to regulate its translation, and SEAP was placed under no regulation for normalization. 293 cells were co-transfected with the IFITM1 3\u2032 UTR vector plasmid and miR-36 mimic. miR-36 mimic significantly decreased the relative luciferase activity compared to the cells that were transfected with miR-NC (Fig. 4B ). In contrast, transfection of cells with miR-inihibitor reversed the ability of miR-36 mimic from lowering the luciferase activity (Fig. 4B ). There was an inverse correlation observed in the expression of miR-36 and IFITM1 during the course of KSHV infection of BJAB (Fig. 4C ) and HMVEC-d (Fig. 4D ) cells. These results suggest that miR-36 directly targets IFITM1 and thereby downregulates its expression.",

To confirm a role for IFITM1 in KSHV infection of target cells, we transiently transfected BJAB and HMVEC-d cells with pQCXIP/IFITM1 and the expression of IFITM1 was confirmed by flow cytometry (Fig. 5B ). KSHV infection of the above IFITM1 expressing BJAB and HMVEC-d cells was a measure of the expression of ORF50 at 30 min PI. The idea was to strictly understand the effects of IFITM1 expression on early stages of KSHV infection. BJAB (Fig. 5C ) and HMVEC-d ( Fig. 5D ) cells expressing IFITM1 supported a significantly enhanced KSHV infection compared to those cells that were left untransfected, mock transfected, or transfected with the empty vector. Surprisingly, IFITM1 expression also enhanced HSV-2 and EBV infection of BJAB and HMVEC-d cells (Fig. 5C,D) .

The levels of IFITM1 mRNA was significantly suppressed in BJAB and HMVEC-d cells by siRNA when compared with a (NS)siRNA control (Fig. 6A) inhibition of 82% \u00b1 7%, 74% \u00b1 9%, and 45% \u00b1 6% was observed in BJAB cells at 12, 24, and 48 hours, respectively, after siRNA transfection (Fig. 6A) .

IFITM1 expression levels were not significantly altered by the (NS)siRNA controls in both the cells tested, demonstrating the specificity of the siRNA used (Fig. 6A ). IFITM1 expression in target cells transfected with siRNA specific to IFITM1 was significantly lowered at 15 min post KSHV infection (Fig. 6B ). In contrast, KSHV induced IFITM1 expression in untransfected or cells transfected with (NS)siRNA were not altered (Fig. 6B ). On the same lines, KSHV infection in cells silenced for the expression of IFITM1 was significantly lower compared to cells that were untransfected or transfected with (NS)siRNA (Fig. 6C ). Silencing the expression of IFITM1 also decreased EBV and HSV-2 infection of the above cells (Fig. 6C) . The above viral infections were monitored by performing qRT-PCR.

Virus-encoded miRNAs (vmiRNA) identified in virus-infected cells significantly influence viral replication and disease progression by modulating viral as well as host cellular mRNA. Many of the cellular miRNAs affect viral replication either directly by binding to the viral genome or indirectly by targeting host factors related to replication 28 . There are several published works that describe virus and cellular encoded miRNAs in KSHV pathogenesis 10, 18 . However, to date, there is no report on the role of cellular miRNAs during early stages of KSHV infection. Recent studies from our laboratory using a combination of deep sequencing and qRT-PCR identified cellular miR-36 to activate as early as 15 min PI 20 . In the current studies, we employed physiologically relevant human B cells (BJAB) and endothelial cells (HMVEC-d) to make the study more meaningful to KSHV biology. Accordingly, using specific primers we analyzed the expression profile of cellular miR-36 during the first 30 min of KSHV infection of cells. A successful viral entry was a measure of KSHV to enter cells and express immediate early gene, ORF50. The expression of ORF50 was monitored by qRT-PCR 26, 29 . KSHV infection of BJAB and HMVEC-d cells rapidly triggered the expression of miR-36 as early as 5 min PI that peaked at 30 min PI (Fig. 1) . Expression of miR-36 in KSHV infected BJAB is higher than those in HMVEC cells. This could be attributed to the inherited variations observed between different cells in the manner by which they respond to virus infection 30 . Moreover, the expression level of miRNAs has been shown to vary among tissues, cell types, and even between cells of the same lineage 31, 32 .",

Accordingly, miR-36 can possibly target several genes (Supplemental Fig. 6 ). Using bioinformatics tools, we identified IFITM1 to be the most promising targets to miR-36. IFITM is a member of the interferon-induced 125-133 amino acid protein family including IFITM1, IFITM2, IFITM3, IFITM5 and IFITM10. This family of proteins is located on chromosome 11 of the human genome and originally described as highly inducible genes by \u03b1and \u03b3-interferons (IFNs) 37, 38 . The three members of the IFITM proteins (IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3) have gained prominence as novel antiviral IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) 39 . Hence, we set out to test the effect of transfecting target cells with IFITM1-3 genes on KSHV infection of target cells. Over-expressing IFITM1 significantly enhanced KSHV infection of cells; IFITM3 moderately enhanced KSHV infection while IFITM2 did not alter the viral infection (Supplemental Fig. 7) . Based on these results, we focused our further studies on IFITM1 in terms of miR-36 and early stages of KSHV infection. Using bioinformatic tools it was determined that the miR-36 target IFITM1 expression. Luciferase assay demonstrated the ability of miR-36 to physically interact with IFITM1 (Fig. 4B) . miR-36 mimic specifically inhibited IFITM1 expression that could be reverted by transfecting cells with miR-36 inhibitor (Fig. 4B) . There was an apparent inverse correlation observed between the KSHV-induced IFITM1 expression and miR-36 response (Fig. 4C,D) . We propose the sharp decline in the expression of IFITM1 30 min PI is because of an increase in the expression of miR-36 (Fig. 4C,D) . Taken together, our study established a direct association between virus-induced IFITM1 and endogenous miR-36 expression in the biology of KSHV.",

If that is the case, how can IFITM1 enhance infection of not just KSHV; but also of EBV and HSV-2? Such a scenario can be possible only if the virus infection is not altered by IFNs and associated proteins 48 . Interestingly enough, herpesviruses as a group (including KSHV) is considered to be relatively insensitive to the antiviral effects of IFNs in a variety of different cell systems 50, 51 . In a way, our results demonstrate for the first time that herpesviruses, KSHV, EBV, and HSV-2, not only hijack IFITM1 to their benefit in facilitating virus entry into cells but also evade the IFN-induced antiviral effects.",

            "text": "This study provides a new insight to virus infection. KSHV (including EBV and HSV-2) interactions with target cells induce IFITM1 within minutes, which facilitate virus entry into cells. KSHV-induced IFITM1 is part of the innate immune activation system that occurs in an antigen-independent fashion 52 and relies on the ability of the host to recognize virus via specific pattern recognition receptors 53 . To counter the effects of KSHV-induced IFITM1, infected cells respond within a short period of time by inducing expression of miR-36. Cellular miR-36 in turn inhibits expression of IFITM1 and thus limit virus infection of cells. Perhaps, this could be a mechanism of superinfection resistance (SIR) 54 developed by cells towards KSHV and other related viral pathogens. IFITM1 suppression by miR-36 may have direct and indirect effects of KSHV pathobiology: (i) directly limit KSHV infection of cells; (ii) block cell proliferation/division 55 and thereby promote KSHV latency 56 ; and (iii) reduce virus-induced inflammation. Such effects of IFITM1 on the biology of KSHV will be better understood by employing the three-dimensional (3-D) cell culture models as they mimic certain aspects of the tissue environment 57, 58 . For all this time, studies on virus entry have always focused primarily on the roles of virus encoded glycoproteins and their cognate host cell receptors. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a miRNA influencing KSHV infection of cells and this, we hope, will open doors to a further understanding of virus entry; after all, it is the miRNAs that regulate the gene function.",

Target cells were treated with different concentrations of miR-36 mimic and inhibitor at 37 \u00b0C in a V-bottom 96-well plate. After a 24 h incubation, the cells were analyzed for the expression of LDH, as an indicator of cell death. The LDH assay was performed using the CytoTox 96 non-radioactive kit (Promega) as per earlier studies 26 Extracted RNA was used to synthesize cDNA and the expression of ORF50 was monitored by qRT-PCR using specific primers as per earlier studies 26 Expression of ORF50 was used as a scale to measure KSHV infection of cells. As reported earlier 29 , the lowest limit of detection in the standard samples was 6-60 copies for the ORF50 gene. The results from the use of ORF50 primers were consistently confirmed by monitoring the expression of another viral immediate early (IE) gene, vGPCR (data not shown). EBV and HSV-2 infection was monitored using specific primers to BRLF1 (homolog of KSHV ORF50) 64 Binding assay. The effect of miR-mimic and inhibitor on KSHV binding to target cells was assessed by PCR detecting the cell-bound KSHV DNA. Briefly, untransfected cells or cells transfected with miR-mimic or inhibitor were infected with 10 MOI of KSHV at +4 \u00b0C. After 60 min of incubation with virus, cells were washed three times with PBS to remove the unbound virus. Cells were pelleted, and total DNA including those representing the cell bound KSHV was isolated using DNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and subjected to qPCR analysis monitoring ORF50 according to recently published work 29 . Incubating KSHV with 100 \u00b5g/ml of heparin and chondroitin sulfate A (CSA; Sigma-Aldridge) for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C were used as known positive and negative controls. Western blotting. All the buffers used in this project were made with water that was endotoxin and pyrogen free. Western blotting was conducted as per earlier studies 29 using the following primary antibodies: rabbit anti-IFITM1 polyclonal antibody (EMD Millipore) and mouse anti-actin antibodies (Clone AC-74; Sigma-Aldridge).",

Briefly, the cDNA was synthesized in a 25 \u03bcl reaction mix containing 5 \u03bcl of 5x reaction buffer, 2.5 U/\u03bcl Poly A Polymerase, 10 ng/\u03bcl MS2 RNA, and 1 \u00b5l RTase Mix. The reaction was performed at 37 \u00b0C for 60 min and terminated at 85 \u00b0C for 5 min. cDNA that was produced in the RT reaction was diluted ten-fold and was used as the template for the PCR reaction in an Applied Biosystems ViiA 7 Real-Time PCR System (Life Technologies, USA). In this system, MS2 RNA was used as an external reference for the quality of the extracted miRNAs, and RNU6B, RNU44, RNU48, and RNU49 were used for normalization. The expression levels of miRNAs were measured employing qRT-PCR with the SYBR green detection and specific forward primer for the mature miRNA sequence and the universal adaptor reverse primer (GeneCopoeia, USA).

IFITM1 inhibits entry of many RNA viruses including influenza A H1N1 Virus, West Nile Virus, Dengue Virus, HIV, and HCV 42-44 . The suggested mechanisms by which IFITM proteins restrict the above virus infections include inhibition of virus binding to corresponding cellular receptors, inhibition of endocytosis, and acting as pattern recognition receptors by sensing virus infection and activation of downstream cellular signaling pathways 42 . These proteins inhibit fusion of viral membranes with cellular endosomal vesicular membranes by blocking the creation of hemifusion, reducing membrane fluidity and curvature, and by possibly disrupting intracellular cholesterol homeostasis 45,46 . However, IFITMs can also enhance viral infection of cells: (i) both IFITM1 and IFITM3 modestly enhanced human papillomavirus 16 (HPV-16) infection of a variety of cells 47 ; and (ii) Zhao et al. have shown type I IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, and type II IFN-\u03bb to significantly promote infection of human coronavirus, HCoV-OC43 by the induction of IFITM proteins.

The cells were left uninfected or infected for 5, 10, 15, and 30 min prior to washing the cells twice in PBS and processed appropriately for RNA extraction. Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The RNA concentration was measured with a NanoDrop ND-2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), and then verified for quality using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Only the RNA samples with 260/280 ratios of 1.8 to 2.0 were used in the study.",

FuGene HD/DNA ratios of 3:1 for adherent cell lines and 6:1 for suspension cell lines were used. Transfection of target cells with different concentrations of miR-36 mimic, or scramble control (miR-NC); miRNA inhibitor to miR-36 and non-specific (NS) inhibitor (Sigma-Aldridge) was achieved using FuGene HD reagent as per standard laboratory procedures. These were transient transfections and experiments using these cells were conducted 48 h post transfection.",
