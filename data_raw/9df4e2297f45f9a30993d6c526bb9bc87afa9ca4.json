We investigated the use of alignment-based and alignment-free methods and support vector machine using mononucleotide frequency and dinucleotide bias to predict the hosts of viruses, and applied these approaches to three datasets: rabies virus, coronavirus, and influenza A virus. For coronavirus, we used the spike gene sequences, while for rabies and influenza A viruses, we used the more conserved nucleoprotein gene sequences. We compared the three methods under different scenarios and showed that their performances are highly correlated with the variability of sequences and sample size. For conserved genes like the nucleoprotein gene, longer k-mers than mono-and dinucleotides are needed to better distinguish the sequences. We also showed that both alignmentbased and alignment-free methods can accurately predict the hosts of viruses. When alignment is difficult to achieve or highly time-consuming, alignment-free methods can be a promising substitute to predict the hosts of new viruses.",

Many infectious disease studies showed that virus cross-species transmissions are highly prevalent resulting in emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) 1 . EIDs continue to pose significant public health problems as shown by the recent outbreaks of West Nile virus, SARS, MARS, and H1N1 2 . Rapidly identifying the reservoir of the new pathogenic bacterial or viral origins responsible for these diseases will help the containment, control, and prevention of the outbreaks 1,3,4 . Further, investigating the potential host of a virus can throw light on the evolutionary history of the virus, thus provide guidance on how to cut off the transmission path. The biological presumption for most of the host identification methods is that the more similar two viruses' DNA/RNA sequences are, they are more likely to share the same host 5 .",

Kargarfard et al. 11 predicted the host range of the influenza virus using various machine learning approaches. Several new alignment-free statistics including \u204e d 2 and d S 2 for molecular sequence comparison using k-mers (k-grams, words, etc.) were developed recently 12,13 .

For alignment-free distance measures, we use Manhattan distance as an representative as many of them have similar prediction accuracies. Figure 1 shows the multidimensional scaling (MDS) plots of the 148 rabies viruses with complete Nucleoprotein (N) gene sequences based on the Manhattan distance using 6-mers (left) and alignment (right). In addition, Figs 2 and 3 show the hierarchical clustering of the viruses using alignment-based distance and Manhattan distances using 6-mers, respectively. The clustering results using the alignment-based method and the Manhattan distance are highly similar indicating that the alignment and alignment-free based methods give roughly similar results. Figure 4 shows the leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) prediction accuracies of one nearest neighbor using alignment-based distance and Manhattan distance with 6-mers, and SVM for different sample sizes. It can be seen from the figure that the average prediction accuracies for the alignment based method and the Manhattan distance based method are similar. However, the prediction accuracies for the alignment-based method have an relatively larger variance than that for the Manhattan distance based method for almost all the sample sizes considered. On the other hand, the average prediction accuracies for the SVM based method are lower than that for both the alignment and Manhattan distance based methods.",

The prediction accuracies for all the methods are greater than 0.90 when the sample size is above 400.

Parallel to the investigations for the rabies virus and the coronavirus, Fig. 9 shows the MDS plots for the 1,200 influenza A viruses with N gene sequences based on Manhattan distance using 6-mers and alignment method. Figures S6 and S7 show the corresponding hierarchical clustering results. The MDS and hierarchical clustering plots do not show a clear clustering pattern according to the hosts.

Figure 10 shows the LOOCV prediction accuracies of the influenza A virus dataset using alignment-based distance, Manhattan distance using 6-mers, and SVM for different sample sizes.

None of the three methods consistently outperforms other methods. For the rabies virus dataset, the alignment based and alignment-free methods perform similarly and both outperform SVM with a large margin. For the coronavirus dataset, SVM outperforms alignment based method followed by alignment-free method when the sample size is low. When the number of samples is large, eg. over 400, all the three methods perform similarly. Finally, for the influenza A virus, none of the methods performs well with prediction accuracies below 0.6. The alignment-free method does a little bit better than the alignment based method and both outperform SVM. Thus, this study shows both alignment-based and alignment-free methods can be effectively used to predict the hosts of viruses. Figures S1-S3 in the supplementary material show that the prediction accuracies of the various alignment-free and alignment methods tend to have large variation for K from 1 to 5 and become stable for K from 5 to 10. Therefore, we choose K = 7 for the coronaviruses and influenza A viruses datasets, and choose K = 1 for the rabies For both the rabies and the influenza A viruses, we use the nucleoprotein gene sequences, while for the coronavirus we use the spike gene. It was shown before that the spike gene evolves fast to better prevent the virus from detection by the host 16 , while nucleoprotein gene is much more conserved, especially at the non-synonymous sites 17, 18 . For conserved genes like nucleoprotein genes, longer k-mers than mono-and dinucleotides are needed to distinguish the sequences. Therefore, SVM using only mono-and dinucleotide does not perform as well as alignment based or Manhattan distance using 6-mers for the rabies and influenza A viruses. On the other hand, for highly divergent genes such as the spike genes, mono-and dinucleotide frequencies are enough to capture the differences among the sequences resulting in better performance of the SVM method.",

We use the same data as in Tang et al. 10 consisting of 724 coronavirus samples from 6 host species (human, porcine, bovine, bat, murine and avian). Among them, 392 samples have complete genome sequenced, and 326 samples only have their spike genes sequenced. We extract the spike gene sequences from the complete genomes by checking the coding sequence annotation in NCBI and obtain additional 381 extracted spike gene sequences. Together with the original 326 sequences, we have a total of 707 all spike sequences and we focus on the investigation of these 707 spike sequences.",
