            "text": "Coronaviruses (CoVs) are important human and animal pathogens that induce fatal respiratory, gastrointestinal and neurological disease. The outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002/2003 has demonstrated human vulnerability to (Coronavirus) CoV epidemics. Neither vaccines nor therapeutics are available against human and animal CoVs. Knowledge of host cell proteins that take part in pivotal virus-host interactions could define broad-spectrum antiviral targets. In this study, we used a systems biology approach employing a genome-wide yeast-two hybrid interaction screen to identify immunopilins (PPIA, PPIB, PPIH, PPIG, FKBP1A, FKBP1B) as interaction partners of the CoV non-structural protein 1 (Nsp1). These molecules modulate the Calcineurin/NFAT pathway that plays an important role in immune cell activation. Overexpression of NSP1 and infection with live SARS-CoV strongly increased signalling through the Calcineurin/NFAT pathway and enhanced the induction of interleukin 2, compatible with late-stage immunopathogenicity and long-term cytokine dysregulation as observed in severe SARS cases. Conversely, inhibition of cyclophilins by cyclosporine A (CspA) blocked the replication of CoVs of all genera, including SARS-CoV, human CoV-229E and -NL-63, feline CoV, as well as avian infectious bronchitis virus. Non-immunosuppressive derivatives of CspA might serve as broad-range CoV inhibitors applicable against emerging CoVs as well as ubiquitous pathogens of humans and livestock.

The agent of SARS was a novel CoV introduced into the human population from an animal reservoir, resulting in a highly lethal epidemic in 2002/2003 [1, 2] . A tremendous diversity of CoVs exists in complex mammalian and avian reservoirs [1, 3, 4] .

            "text": "The SARS-CoV genome is predicted to encode 14 functional open reading frames, leading to the expression of up to 29 structural and non-structural protein products [1] . The functions of many of these proteins are poorly understood or unknown. To study the interplay of viral proteins with the host cell and to identify new targets involved in viral replication we have performed a genome-wide analysis of protein -protein interactions between the SARS-CoV and human proteins via a High-Throughput Yeast Two Hybrid Screen (HTY2H) [6, 7] . Within this framework we identified redundant interactions between SARS-CoV non-structural protein Nsp1 and a group of host proteins with peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans-isomerase activity, including the cyclophilins/immunophilins PPIA, PPIG, PPIH and FKBP1A, FKBP1B. These modulate the Calcineurin/ NFAT pathway that plays an important role in immune cell activation [8, 9] . The NFAT family of transcription factors encodes four calcium-regulated proteins of which three (NFAT1, -2, -3) are expressed in a variety of cell types including T-cells, B-cells, mast cells, natural killer cells and eosinophils [8, 9] . NFAT activation regulates pivotal immune processes like apoptosis, anergy, and T-cell development. An essential activation step for NFAT is its dephosphorylation by the phospatase calcineurin A (CnA), resulting in the translocation of NFAT into the nucleus. Cyclosporin A (CspA) forms complexes with cyclophilins that bind to CnA, preventing its activity. This effect is used in transplant patients to prevent organ rejection by suppression of the immune system. Here we show that SARS-CoV nonstructural protein Nsp1, as well as full replicating SARS-CoV, enhance the CnA/NFAT pathway and induce NFATresponsive promoters. Because interactions with upstream elements of the pathway were redundantly identified in a hypothesis-free virushost interaction screen, the pathway is likely to play a significant role for virus replication. Indeed, an extensive panel of CoVs covering all three relevant virus genera was strongly inhibited by manipulation of cyclophilins using CspA.",

Inserts from positive yeast clones were sequenced and compared against GenBank. BLAST searches on 2287 DNA sequences yielded 942 different human gene hits. These were divided into four confidence categories: category A (highly confident interaction partners found more than once in one or several screens), category B (single hits), category C (sticky preys interacting with several to many bait proteins) and category D (39-UTR cDNA regions or inserts in reverse orientation coding for unnatural peptides). We found 132, 383, 245, and 282 hits in categories A -D, respectively. For validation, the cDNAs of 86 category A and category B interaction candidates were cloned inframe with the Renilla reniformis luciferase and overexpressed in HEK 293 cells. SARS-CoV ORFs were cloned in-frame with N-terminal protein A domains and co-expressed in the same cells. Protein Adirected immunoprecipitates retained on IgG-coated magnetic beads were identified by measuring in-vitro Luciferase activity.

Abstracts mentioning YTH or co-immunoprecipitation assays were specifically sought. Twenty-eight CoV-/host protein interactions were identified in the literature, as listed in Table S2 . It was then determined how these literature hits overlapped with the lists of candidate interactors as identified by HTY2H screening in different confidence levels. Using a hypergeometric test, the fractions of overlap were compared to the fraction of literature hits in the list of search terms (31,941 human proteins used for text-mining). Abstracts were enriched for proteins identified as SARS-CoV interaction partners both in the high confidence and the complete data sets (Table S3 and Table S4 ). Figure 2 summarizes highly confident interactions identified in the overall screen and GO [11, 12] analysis. SARS-CoV proteins were found to preferentially target protein complex subunits (Table S5  and Table S6 ). Of 9 complexes which were targeted through $4 subunits, 4 complexes were found to be significantly enriched: The respiratory chain complex I (7 subunits targeted by SARS-CoV, pvalue ,0.036), the cytoplasmic ribosome (10 subunits targeted by SARS-CoV, p-value ,0.036), in particular the 60S ribosomal subunit (7 subunits targeted by SARS-CoV, p-value ,0.036) and the LCR-associated remodeling complex which is involved in DNA conformation modification (4 subunits targeted by SARS-CoV, pvalue , 0.039). Furthermore, the analysis of the centrality of SARS targets within the human interaction network ( Figure S1 ) indicated that SARS-CoV proteins target both highly interactive proteins (hubs) as well as so-called bottleneck proteins which are central to many of the shortest paths in their networks [13] ( Figure S2 ). Table S4 summarizes GO results for SARS-CoV nonstructural protein Nsp1, a protein yielding particularly interesting candidate interaction networks. Interactions between Nsp1 and several members of the class of immunophilins (PPIA, PPIG, PPIH, FK506-binding proteins FKBP1A and -B) and calcipressins (RCAN1 and -3) were selected for experimental confirmation.",

Broad-range drugs can be obtained by targeting elements that several of these organisms have in common. In contrast, target overlap between different viruses is minimal. The replication of viruses is highly interweaved with the metabolism of the host cell. A high potential in the development of antivirals with broad activity might therefore reside in the identification of host factors elemental to virus replication. In this work we followed a systems biology approach, screening for interactions between virus and host proteins by employing an automated yeast-two-hybrid setup. Upon binding of a viral protein to cyclophilins the screen led to the identification of the Calcineurin/NFAT pathway possibly being involved in the pathogenesis of SARS-Coronavirus. Secondly, cyclophilins were suggested to play an elemental role in virus replication since cyclosporin A inhibited replication of all Coronavirus prototype members tested. This large range of viruses includes common cold viruses, the SARS agent, as well as a range of animal viruses. For the first time this work shows that an undirected, systemsbiology approach could identify a host-encoded, broadrange antiviral target.",

Although PPIB was not identified as an interactor by Y2H it was included in the experiment as it is known to bind to the HIV-1 gag protein [15] and to the HCV NSB5 protein [16] . All tested proteins interacted with Nsp1(aa 1-93), suggesting redundant interactions of SARS-CoV with the CnA/ NFAT pathway via the N-terminal part of Nsp1 ( Figure 3) . To examine the functional consequences of Nsp1 expression on NFAT activity, NFAT and CnA cDNAs were overexpressed in HEK 293 cells. Parallel experiments in Jurkat cells were done without overexpression due to their constitutive activity of the CnA/NFAT pathway. The CnA/NFAT pathway was stimulated by addition of PMA (40 ng/ml) and ionomycin (2 mM) to the culture medium. In both cell lines treated this way, expression of Nsp1 did not induce NFAT activity directly, but increased significantly the stimulatory effect of PMA/ionomycin on NFAT activation ( Figure 4A ). The increase in NFAT activity could be blocked by CspA, an inhibitor of the NFAT pathway ( Figure 4A and B) . Coexpression of the calcipressin RCAN3 as shown in Figure 4B attenuated the overall stimulating effect on the NFAT activity. In contrast, coexpression of other CoV proteins or coexpression of PPIA, PPIH, FKBP1A did not impact NFAT activity (data not shown). Experiments up to this point employed overexpression of NFAT3. As different NFAT species are expressed depending on cell type [17] , NFAT1 and NFAT2 were alternatively expressed and compared in the same assay. For both species essentially the same influence of Nsp1 on PMA/ionomycin-dependent stimulation was seen ( Figure 4C and D). Altogether this suggested a broad effect of Nsp1 on NFAT activation that is mediated via the canonical NFAT activation pathway including CnA.",

To examine whether the Nsp1-mediated, PMA/ionomycin-dependent activation of NFAT may cause specific induction of relevant cytokines, HEK293 cells were co-transfected with the plasmids described above, except that the NFAT reporter plasmid was replaced by luciferase reporter plasmids carrying the IL-2, IL-4 and IL-8 promoters, respectively ( Figure 6 ). Expression of Nsp1 induced the IL-2 promoter significantly by a factor of about 2.5 ( Figure 6A ). This effect was inhibited by CspA and RCAN-3, suggesting dependence on the CnA/NFAT pathway. The IL-4 promoter activity was not significantly elevated by Nsp1 expression in the presence of PMA/ionomycin ( Figure 6B ). Its activity was decreased in the presence of CspA but not RCAN-3. The IL-8 promoter was induced by PMA/ionomycin alone, but significantly downregulated by a factor of about 1.8 in additional presence of Nsp1 ( Figure 6C ). Expression of RCAN-3 reduced IL-8 promoter activity levels to about half, while CspA inhibited the promoter completely. In Jurkat cells, which express endogenous NFAT3 and CnA, the Nsp1 protein did not induce the IL-2 promoter. The slight induction of IL-4 and the downregulation of the IL-8 promoter activities in presence of Nsp1 (about twofold) were similar to effects seen in HEK 293 cells. These results suggested that Nsp1 expression had the strongest influence on the IL-2 promoter.",

Overexpression of Nsp1fl as well as treatment with PMA/ionomycin, respectively, caused small but significant luciferase increases in both cell lines. The combined expression of Nsp1fl with PMA/ionomycin treatment led to significant induction of PRDII by a factor of about 6 in both cell lines. The AP-1 promotor was only slightly upregulated in HEK293 and downregulated in Jurkat cells. This indicated a coinvolvement of NFkB but not of AP-1 in the induction of IL-2 by Nsp1, suggesting dependence mainly on the NFAT pathway.

Three versions of Nsp1 (Nsp1fl = aa 1-180, Nsp1N-terminus = aa 1-93 and Nsp1 C-terminus = aa119-180) and human cDNAs were cloned into protein A and Renilla Luciferase fusion vectors. Renilla-Nsp1 (A) or protein A-Nsp1 (B) was cotransfected with each respective cDNA into HEK293 cells. Complexes were purified via IgG-coated magnetic beads and Luciferase activity was determined as a measure for binding activity. As a positive control the very strongly interacting jun and fos genes were used. On the y-axis normalized signal to background ratios are shown. doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1002331.g003 (R. H., own unpublished observations), inhibited replicon activity to a comparable extent as CspA, at comparable substance concentrations ( Figure 9B ). To control against any influence of the nucleocapsid protein that is co-electroporated for maximal replicon efficiency [24, 25, 26] and that is also contained in the replicon RNA, this protein was expressed from a eukaryotic expression vector in the same cells and an NFAT induction assay was conducted as described above. No N-dependent effect on the assay was seen ( Figure 9C) . These results suggest an action of CspA on genome replication and/or transcription, rather than other stages such as virus entry or egress.",

            "text": "Various genomic and proteomic methods have been utilized to identify protein-protein interactions in the context of viral replication [6, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31] . HTY2H is among the most direct approaches to identify interactions between members of viral ORFeomes and large host cDNA libraries. Major advantages of the method include its potential for high throughput testing and automation, as well as its high sensitivity. The latter facilitates investigation of proteins expressed at low levels and of those causing weak and transient interactions [32, 33] . Drawbacks include the inability to control and confirm expression of genes of interest, other than by positive selection of yeast expression clones containing nutritional markers. Moreover, some proteins need posttranslational modifications not provided by the yeast cell, in order to interact with binding partners. Also, since interactions of bait and prey proteins take place in the nucleus of the yeast cell, the assay is influenced by hydrophobic and transmembrane regions affecting the nuclear membrane. It is well known that a considerable fraction of interacting proteins in HTY2H represent false positive findings, making it absolutely necessary to validate interactions by independent eukaryotic assays. We have implemented a version of the Lumier assay that is amenable for screening in mammalian cells at a medium scale of parallelity [34] . Our modified version using a protein A tag instead of a Flag tag enables automated capture of precipitates on IgG Fc-coated magnetic beads. Throughput is mainly limited by the requirement to subclone Y2H plasmid inserts, as the assay does not involve any cell-based imaging or other readouts going beyond in-vitro Luciferase assays. In our analysis of 86 Y2H-positive interaction partners we achieved a positive confirmation rate of about 42% in category A and B interactors, which is in good agreement with a standardized comparison of five different interaction assays in which the LUMIER pull-down assay showed the highest sensitivity (36%) on a positive reference set of human proteins [10] . It has to be mentioned that all interaction assay systems carry intrinsic limitations. In the case of our modified Lumier method the Renilla and protein A tags are rather long as compared to His or HA tags. Therefore, true interactions might be missed, and it is possible that the interaction of PPIA with full-length nsp1 is sterically prevented by the length of these tags, as compared to the N-terminal fragment of Nsp1. But the chief attraction of our method is its applicability in high thoughput assays.",

In order to demonstrate that HTY2H can afford a direct identification of novel antiviral targets, we have chosen one promising group of interactors for further investigation in the present study. The interaction of Nsp1 with the cyclophilins PPIA, PPIB, PPIG, PPIH, the FK506-binding proteins FKBP1A/B, and the CnA (calcipressin) regulators RCAN1 and RCAN3 represented a highly redundant virus-host interaction involving critical elements of the same regulatory network immediately upstream of the CnA/ NFAT pathway. Nsp1 is a virulence factor in-vivo whose action has been linked with early stages of the immune response, including antagonism against IFN signaling and inhibition of host protein synthesis [35, 36, 37, 38] . Our findings add an important new dimension to Nsp19s role in pathogenicity, identifying this protein as a strong and specific activator of NFAT enhancing the induction of the IL-2 promoter. The increase of NFAT activation extended to all three major NFAT species, suggesting a potential for induction of broad and systemic cytokine dysregulation by affecting several types of immune cells. The pattern of cytokine dysregulation in severe SARS cases differed from the cytokine burst seen in other acute viral diseases in its delayed occurrence, manifesting beyond the second week of symptoms. Interestingly, it was noted upon clinical observations that late aggravation was correlated with severe clinical outcome, triggering parallel efforts in several centers to treat patients empirically with steroids [39, 40, 41] . Our results suggest an influence on fundamental triggers of immune cell activation, contributing an explanation for the cytokine dysregulation and immune-dependent pathogenesis observed in severe cases of SARS.",

Cyclophilins are essential cofactors for replication of HCV, HIV and of some parasites [43] . Incorporation of PPIA into HIV-1 particles via binding to gag is paralleled by its binding to the N protein of SARS-CoV by an educated guess finding using surface plasmon resonance biosensor technology [44] . Furthermore, in a recent proteomics study in which viral and cellular proteins incorporated into SARS-CoV virions were spectrometrically profiled PPIA was also found in purified virus particles [31] . We have indeed shown that the inhibition of cyclophilins by CspA exhibited strong and specific inhibitory effects on members of all three genera of CoVs. This broad antiviral action is supported by a recent characterization of Nsp1 structural conservation that extends beyond the limits of CoV genera [22] . Inhibition took place in the low micromolar range, indicating prospects for future investigation of similar (nonimmunosuppressive) drugs as broad-range antivirals. Such drugs have already been employed against HCV, whose nonstructural NS5A and NS2 proteins interact with cyclophilins and whose replication can be inhibited by CspA and non-immunosuppressive derivatives thereof [45] .",

            "text": "Our study is limited in that it does not clarify the biological functions of the interaction between Nsp1 and its cellular partners, nor does it confirm the involvement of Nsp1 in full virus context by knock out experiments in recombinant viruses. Brockway and Denison showed that deletion of residues in the amino-terminal half of nsp1 is not tolerated for a productive infection [46] . Thus it seems not possible to construct viruses with mutations in the Nterminal half of nsp1 which do not bind to cyclophilins anymore. It will thereofore be difficult to exactly delineate the role of nsp1 in virus-host cooperation. It should also be appreciated that CspAinhibitable NFAT induction by SARS-CoV nsp1 may be independent of the replication inhibition by CspA. CspA specifically binds to cyclophilins and this complex binds to calcineurin phosphatase preventing the dephosphorylation of NFAT. Binding of nsp1 to cyclophilins and the induction of NFAT is obviously inhibited by Csp A. On an independent level, formation of the Cyclophilin-CspA complex might prevent those cyclophilin functions required for virus replication. Complex further studies involving multiple CoV systems will be required to delineate these functions. Nevertheless, we have been able to shed more light on the principal stage of the virus replication cycle that is subject to CspAdependent inhibition. Our experiments using a SARS-CoV replicon suggest strongly that the processes afforded by the replicative proteins rather than stages of virus entry and egress, are affected. Further experiments need to be done in the future in order to investigate on a mechanistic level the potential breadth of the identified antiviral effect. In particular, the large diversity of CoVs in animal reservoirs generates interest in studying how conserved this particular virus-host interaction might be between non-human CoVs and human cells, and whether this could be exploited as a truly broad-range antiviral target that covers epidemic and reservoir-borne viruses alike.",

Human cDNA libraries from human brain and fetal brain (Clontech) as well as a library of individually cloned full-length open reading frames from cDNAs of 5000 different genes were screened to a minimal coverage of 5 million clones per library. To mate yeast strains, exponentially growing cultures at an OD 600nm of 1 were combined, pelleted by centrifugation, and resuspended in an equal volume of YPDA (Yeast Extract Peptone Dextrose Adenine) containing 20% PEG 6000. For the generation of a highconfidence dataset, interaction pairs were selected which were isolated at least twice, or where the bait interacted with two highly related preys, and which did not involve promiscuous preys.",

We then compared the distribution of degree (number of interactions) and betweenness centrality [13] for the viral targets against all other proteins in the human networks with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test in R [56] . P-Values were again corrected for multiple testing using the FDRmethod by Benjamini and Hochberg. Degree and betweenness centrality are alternative measures of network centrality for individual proteins. High degree characterizes so-called hubs which are highly interactive while high betweenness centrality characterizes so-called bottlenecks which are central to many connections between proteins. Table S1 Category 1 (A) and category 2 (B) interaction partners of SARS-CoV nsp1 and cellular proteins identified by HTY2H and validated by LUMIER assay. Of 44 of the high-confidence (A) Y2H interactions that were retested in LUMIER assays, 21 (48%) were clearly positive. In contrast, when 42 of the low-confidence Y2H-interactions (category B) were tested in LUMIER assays, a much lower percentage of pairs gave interactions signals above background. For comparison, a negative reference set of 85 random proteins yielded interaction signals which roughly corresponded to the statstically expected numbers for normally distributed signals. A comparison of Braun et al. (see main text) have recently shown that roughly one third of interactions selected from the scientific literature score positive in the LUMIER assays. We therefore estimate the false positive rate of the interactions from our dataset to be in the range of 20-30%. A graphical comparison of these data to a negative control set is depicted in Figure 1 .",
