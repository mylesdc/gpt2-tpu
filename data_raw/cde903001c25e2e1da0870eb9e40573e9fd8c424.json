            "text": "Little is known about the specific contributions of aging to the neuron dysfunction and death in Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD is characterized by the pathological accumulation of abnormal tau (a microtubule-associated protein), and the mislocalization of tau from the axon to the somatodendritic compartment is thought to play an important role in disease pathogenesis. The axon initial segment (AIS) is thought to play a role in the selective localization of tau in the axonal compartment. Thus, disruption in the AIS barrier may allow tau to diffuse freely back into the somatodendritic compartment and potentially lead to neurotoxicity. Here, we analyzed AISs using stereological methods and protein immunoblotting, and the localization of tau was assessed with immunofluorescence optical density measurements and protein immunoblotting. None of the outcome measurements assessed, including AIS structure, AIS protein levels, the distribution of tau in neurons of the hippocampus (HP), and total tau or phospho-tau protein levels were different in young, middle-, and old-age Fischer 344 rats. The outcome measurements assessed, including AIS structure, AIS protein levels, the distribution of tau in neurons of the HP, and total tau or phospho-tau protein levels were not different in young, middle-, and old-age Fischer 344 rats, with the exception of a small reduction in AIS volume and diameter in the CA2 region of aged animals. These data suggest that aging largely has no effect on these properties of the AIS or tau distribution, and thus, may not contribute directly to tau mislocalization.",

            "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease of individuals over the age of 65, and affects over 6.4 million adults in the United States (James et al., 2014) . The leading risk factor for developing the disease is aging, and while the cause of AD is still unclear, the accumulation of inclusions comprised of tau protein is a hallmark of the disease (Santuccione et al., 2013) . It remains unclear whether changes in the distribution of tau that are reminiscent of AD-related changes, such as accumulation in the somatodendritic compartment, occur during normal aging. Aged Fischer 344 rats are commonly used for aging research and exhibit agerelated behavioral deficits of learning and memory as well as motor impairment (Spangler et al., 1994; van der Staay and Blokland, 1996; Cochran et al., 2014) . Additionally, aging causes altered neuronal protein expression, axonal atrophy, and some gliosis in the F344 rat model (Parhad et al., 1995) . For example, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) is shown to increase significantly in the hippocampus (HP) of aged rats both with and without cognitive impairment (VanGuilder et al., 2011) . Thus, Fischer 344 rats are a good model to recapitulate factors of human aging (van der Staay and Blokland, 1996) and determining whether aging effects the AIS and tau distribution. The underlying hypothesis is that aging causes alterations in AIS integrity and tau mislocalization, which may represent events that contribute to aging as a strong risk factor for AD.",

            "text": "Tau, a microtubule-associated protein, is thought to contribute to the development and progression of AD pathology, but the mechanisms behind tau toxicity remain largely unknown. Age-related accumulations of tau were reported in some nonhuman primate brains (Oikawa et al., 2010; Perez et al., 2013) , yet systematic analysis of the cellular localization of tau accumulation across aging is not well studied. Unfortunately, human tissue studies are often limited in scope across age groups making it hard to appreciate changes from young to old age. In healthy neurons, tau is enriched in the axonal compartment, where it may stabilize microtubules and play a role in regulating axonal functions such as transport (Tytell et al., 1984; Binder et al., 1986; Kanaan et al., 2013) . The redistribution of tau from the axonal compartment to the somatodendritic compartment is thought of as an important event in tau-mediated neurotoxicity (Buee et al., 2000) . The preferential localization of tau in axons is mediated, at least in part, by the axon initial segment (AIS), which acts as a retrograde barrier for freely diffusing tau (Li et al., 2011; Sun et al., 2014; Zempel and Mandelkow, 2014; Sohn et al., 2016) . Importantly, very little is known about the connections between aging, the AIS, and tau distribution. The AIS is a selective diffusion barrier separating the axonal compartment from the somatodendritic compartment (Winckler et al., 1999) . The establishment of the AIS creates a filter that regulates intracellular traffic based on protein size or the type of motor proteins carrying cargo along microtubules (Song et al., 2009; Leterrier and Dargent, 2014) . Ankyrin G (AnkG) is well established as a necessary protein for the development and maintenance of the AIS as a selective filter, as well as a necessary protein for developing and maintaining axonal polarity (Zhou et al., 1998; Hedstrom et al., 2008) . AnkG also has an integral role in recruiting and binding structural proteins to the AIS, such as \u2424IV-spectrin and neurofascin (Hedstrom et al., 2007; Freal et al., 2016) . Interestingly, a single previous report showed that some structural proteins in the AIS (specifically ankyrin) are reduced with age in wild-type mice (Bahr et al., 1994) . Thus, we set out to determine if the structure of the AIS and/or tau localization is altered during normal aging. Our data show that AIS structure, levels of multiple AIS proteins, and the distribution of tau in HP neurons are not altered with advancing age in Fischer 344 rats.",

The flash frozen HPs were dropped into nine volumes of urea buffer (8 M urea, 5% SDS, 5 mM N-ethyl maleimide, 10 mM HEPES, 10 g/ml leupeptin, and 10 g/ml pepstatin) at 65\u00b0C and immediately pulverized with an Eppendorf tube pestle (#12-141-363, Thermo Fisher) for 10 s and then sonicated, as described above. The samples were then diluted in Laemmli buffer and heated to 95\u00b0C for 10 min. The protein concentrations of the resulting lysate samples were measured using the SDS Lowry protein assay as described (Cox et al., 2016) . Lysate samples (100 g/lane; n \u03ed 6/group) were separated using SDS-PAGE on 3-8% Criterion XT Tris-Acetate in XT buffer (Bio-Rad) gradient gels at 150 V and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes in transfer buffer [40 mM Tris, 20 mM sodium acetate, 2 mM EDTA, pH 7.4, 20% (v/v) methanol, 0.05% (w/v) SDS] for 120 min at 10 V. After transferring, the blots were stained with Ponceau S [0.04% (w/v) Ponceau S (#P3504, Sigma), 0.1% (v/v) acetic acid] for 5 min followed by 2 \u03eb 5 min washes in 5% acetic acid (v/v) and then two washes in water. The blots were imaged before proceeding to blocking and Ponceau bands were used to normalize the quantified AnkG signals.",

This conclusion is further supported by the lack of changes in tubulin described above. Stereological analysis of the AIS was conducted using two complementary approaches. The space balls probe is an established methodology for detecting agingrelated changes in fiber structures within the brain (Ypsilanti et al., 2008) , and here we used it to measure AIS length. The AutoNeuron method in Neurolucida was used to perform 3D measurements of individual AISs and showed a lack of age-related changes in AIS length and only a mild, region-specific decrease in width and volume. This probe has been used previously to measure the diameter of dendrites in pyramidal neurons and compare them across brain regions (Amatrudo et al., 2012) .The unbiased stereological measurement of AIS length in the entire HP is a significant advantage of this approach to analyze AIS morphology. The length of the AIS was previously measured with \u2424IV-spectrin using a nonstereological method in selected z-stacks of the HP (Baalman et al., 2013) . Interestingly, they report that a shortening of AISs correlates to cognitive impairment following explosioninduced brain trauma in Sprague Dawley rats. This work suggests that a shortening of the AIS may correlate to cognitive impairment, but we did not detect a shortening of AISs with age in the current work. Collectively, these data strongly demonstrate that the gross structure of the AIS (i.e., length, diameter, volume) do not change during the normal aging process in most cells of the HP.",

We included age groups that span the spectrum from young (4 months), middle (14 months), and old (24 months), which is near the end of the normal lifespan and a time at which agingrelated impairments in memory and cognition occur. For example, an age-related decline in learning ability at 24 months of age was observed using a 14-unit T-maze and shock-motivated one-way active avoidance test in Fischer 344 rats (Spangler et al., 1994) . Additionally, 24month-old Fischer 344 rats exhibit pathologies in multiple organ systems associated with advanced aging, further supporting their utility as a model of aging. We confirmed that our techniques and methods are capable of detecting other changes in normal aging that were previously reported (i.e., GFAP increase; VanGuilder et al., 2011) .",

These studies, made it clear that aged animals can be separated into unimpaired or impaired groups based on performance and that these changes correspond to some neurochemical and neuroanatomical changes. However, the data reported here demonstrate that two distinct populations of aged animals do not exist in regard to the specific AIS and tau parameters studied, suggesting these variables do not underlie the behavioral and cognitive decline seen in aging Fischer 344 rats. Analysis of these parameters in young, middle, and old humans may be necessary to definitively establish whether the same holds true for humans.",
