The absence of comprehensive data on populations, health care systems and disease characteristics in this region makes risk assessment and decisions about the provision of such support challenging.",

The globalised nature of health security argues for international support to improve local health care systems, but limited data makes risk assessment and decision making difficult. We propose a mathematical modelling framework that can help explore a variety of outbreak and intervention scenarios. Our framework can assist with the identification of constraints that limit the ability of local health care systems to detect and respond to EID outbreaks in a timely and effective fashion, and assess the relative importance of these constraints to help establish priorities for health care system support. We illustrate the use of our framework by considering the importation of Ebola into the Asia-Pacific region, with results emphasising the critical role played by effective surveillance in controlling localised outbreaks.

Although no such importation has occurred to date, the risk has been recognised [9] , prompting consideration of the likelihood of an outbreak occurring and evaluating alternative preparedness and response strategies. Furthermore, other viral haemorrhagic fevers-both external to the Asia-Pacific region, such as Marburg virus disease [10] and Lassa fever [11] , and those already present, such as Nipah virus [12] -may have similar pandemic potential to EVD, and the model framework introduced here would be directly applicable.",

However, we show how priorities for health care system support depend upon the local context. We compare our findings to results from qualitative assessments of EVD risk undertaken by WHO [13, 14] , and conclude by discussing the implications for EVD preparedness in particular, and the broader utility of mathematical modelling for EID risk assessment and decision making in data-poor scenarios.",

The 2014 West African outbreak-first reported in Guinea and subsequently becoming established in Liberia and Sierra Leone-is the largest to date. Symptoms of EVD include vomiting, diarrhoea and haemorrhaging, and transmission occurs via direct contact with blood and other bodily fluids. It is characterised by an incubation period of up to three weeks during which onward transmission is unlikely, followed by increasingly severe symptoms and associated infectiousness. Case fatality rates are high, and improperly buried bodies represent an ongoing source of infection [15] . In the absence of widely available pharmaceutical measures for treatment or prevention during the 2014 West African outbreak, control efforts centred around identification and isolation of cases, tracing of known contacts, and hygienic burial of people who died from EVD.",

Health care workers were disproportionately represented among cases and the full costs of the outbreak in terms of the impact on health infrastructure are still being realised [2] .

The later the first detection occurs, the more critical it becomes to deliver the intervention rapidly. When the first detection is the fifth actual case (\"FD = 5\") a delay of 4 weeks before burial practices are changed reduces the likelihood of control from 89% to 78%, but when the first detection is the twenty-fifth actual case (\"FD = 25\") a delay of 4 weeks before burial practices are changed reduces this from 45% to 23%. Starting with a baseline case ascertainment of 80% and a small health care system (0.1% of population are HCWs, 1:15 and 1:50 ratio of bed and contact-tracing capacities to HCWs, as above), this figure shows the effect of doubling both the health care capacity and the health care workforce at different times after the first detected case. This increase in capacity represents the transition from a small health care system to a medium health care system, as defined in Fig 5. This clearly shows the importance of early detection; the time delay in delivering the additional capacity is less important over this timescale of 0-8 weeks, because the existing health care system is capable of accommodating patients in the early stage of the outbreak. As expected, reducing the force of infection from both dead bodies and from infectious individuals in the community has a dramatic effect on disease transmission and substantially increases the likelihood of control (Fig 9) . However, even the impact of this intervention is substantially reduced by late detection and delayed delivery. ",

Although PNG's Human Development Index (HDI) (0.505 in 2014) is slightly higher than that of EVD-affected West African countries (0.411 in Guinea, 0.413 in Sierra Leone and 0.43 in Liberia), it is the lowest ranked country in the Southeast Asia/West Pacific region, and among the lowest ranked countries globally. Therefore, estimates of health care system and population factors relevant to disease transmission are likely to be comparable.

We also assumed a (modest) national contact-tracing capacity of 100 contacts per day. We allocated national hospital beds to Port Moresby and distributed remaining beds (regional and provincial hospitals) among the administrative regions in proportion to their population densities, as a proxy for both population size and health care system accessibility.

These challenges include: very few health professionals (less than 1 doctor per 10,000 people), insufficient health workforce in rural areas (more than 80% of medical officers work in urban areas, despite 87.5% of the population living in rural areas), low levels of workforce retention in rural areas (due to remoteness, financial instability, and dangerous environments), limited availability of basic essential medical Table 1 .

We have also shown that, in specific settings (such as the Papua New Guinea case study), the relative merits of different resourcing strategies may shift. For example, sensitivity analyses for the rural regions of PNG indicated that interventions targeting behavioural change, such as changes to burial practices, consistently improve controllability. However, providing extra hospital beds alone is unlikely to confer substantial benefits because the limiting factor is case ascertainment rather than treatment and isolation of cases. These observations are of course specific to this population and health care system context, and a strength of this framework is the ability to tailor intervention priorities to specific local context.",

This clarifies the potential connection between what the WHO assessment refers to as 'localized clusters' and 'widespread transmission' . While the WHO assessment identifies the need for clinician awareness, case definition, triage and precautions for cases, our model also highlights the importance of secondary contact tracing and case ascertainment in limiting further spread. Our modelling demonstrates that the risk of extending to widespread transmission is not negligible, and that the presentation of cases to health facilities would not in and of itself necessarily improve control. In agreement with the APSED strategy recommendations, our results highlight the critical importance of early detection and high ascertainment for EID control [19] . Preemptive strengthening of surveillance systems in this region is therefore of paramount importance.",

In particular, such data are typically not available at a high spatial resolution, which is likely to hide considerable geographic heterogeneity in health care system quantity, quality and access. We have dealt with this limitation by exploring a range of potential health care system resourcing levels, but the availability of more accurate data would improve the quality of model scenarios. Furthermore, our modelling approach embodies particular assumptions about disease transmission characteristics that may only partially reflect the dynamics of any specific EID outbreak. For example, increased variability ('overdispersion') in the number of secondary cases that a primary case generates may lead to an overestimate in the risk of an outbreak occurring [37] (see Over-dispersion in secondary cases in S1 Methods).",

Communication of key model outcomes to policy makers and local health care providers must be both accurate and comprehensible. Given the considerable uncertainty around model inputs in data-poor settings, it is important that specific quantitative outputs are not 'over-interpreted' . For example, projections of cumulative cases are unlikely to be realised given both initial uncertainty, and the evolving nature of the local and international response and intervention. We therefore advocate focusing on qualitative measures of control and burden that can inform estimates of comparative, rather than absolute, impact. Our classification of outbreaks as either controlled or uncontrolled was appropriate in the case of EVD, since there was a clear division between epidemic sizes. It is possible that further distinctions may be required in other scenarios.",

This represents a sociocultural intervention that changes burial practices, as conducted in previous Ebola outbreaks and the temporary storage of dead bodies in the 2009 cholera outbreak in Papua New Guinea. Reducing the force of infection (whether directly or indirectly) will decrease the epidemic burden, but the likelihood of controlling the epidemic is strongly affected by the speed with which such an intervention can be delivered. Success requires both early detection and a rapid response from the community.",
