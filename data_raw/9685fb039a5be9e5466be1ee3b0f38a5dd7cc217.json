            "text": "The 2nd Symposium of the Canadian Society for Virology (CSV2018) was held in June 2018 in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, as a featured event marking the 200th anniversary of Dalhousie University. CSV2018 attracted 175 attendees from across Canada and around the world, more than double the number that attended the first CSV symposium two years earlier. CSV2018 provided a forum to discuss a wide range of topics in virology including human, veterinary, plant, and microbial pathogens. Invited keynote speakers included David Kelvin (Dalhousie University and Shantou University Medical College) who provided a historical perspective on influenza on the 100th anniversary of the 1918 pandemic; Sylvain Moineau (Universit\u00e9 Laval) who described CRISPR-Cas systems and anti-CRISPR proteins in warfare between bacteriophages and their host microbes; and Kate O'Brien (then from Johns Hopkins University, now relocated to the World Health Organization where she is Director of Immunization, Vaccines and Biologicals), who discussed the underlying viral etiology for pneumonia in the developing world, and the evidence for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) as a primary cause. Reflecting a strong commitment of Canadian virologists to science communication, CSV2018 featured the launch of Halifax's first annual Soapbox Science event to enable public engagement with female scientists, and the live-taping of the 499th episode of the This Week in Virology (TWIV) podcast, hosted by Vincent Racaniello (Columbia University) and science writer Alan Dove. TWIV featured interviews of CSV co-founders Nathalie Grandvaux (Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al) and Craig McCormick (Dalhousie University), who discussed the origins and objectives of the new society; Ryan Noyce (University of Alberta), who discussed technical and ethical considerations of synthetic virology; and Kate O'Brien, who discussed vaccines and global health. Finally, because CSV seeks to provide a better future for the next generation of Canadian virologists, the symposium featured a large number of oral and poster presentations from trainees and closed with the awarding of presentation prizes to trainees, followed by a tour of the Halifax Citadel National Historic Site and an evening of entertainment at the historic Alexander Keith's Brewery.",

Dr. Moineau discussed current and potential applications of CRISPR technology and introduced the audience to a wide variety of newly discovered anti-CRISPR proteins that will undoubtedly be the subject of intense investigation for years to come [2, 3] .

            "text": "The second day of CSV2018 started early for some, with a student-led Fun Run through South End Halifax and Point Pleasant Park. When Fun Run survivors arrived at breakfast, they were greeted by volunteers who gave them seating assignments that maximized potential interactions between PIs and students. Following this, the first scientific session of the day commenced, chaired by Dr. Hugo Soudeyns (Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al), on \"Emerging Viruses\". To lead off, Dr. Vikram Misra (University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SK) presented his studies of bat viruses. In recent years several viruses that appear to cause no overt disease in their natural bat hosts have been transmitted to new mammalian hosts, causing serious and sometimes fatal disease. Dr. Misra's research program is focused on examining the apparently benign relationship between these viruses and their natural bat hosts, as well as factors that upset this relationship leading to increased viral replication and transmission to new mammalian hosts (recently reviewed in [5] ). His team, in a comparison of bat and human host responses to viral infection, demonstrated that while both animals mount antiviral responses, inflammatory responses are diminished in bat cells [6] potentially decreasing viral pathology. Moreover, antiviral responses in bat cells were resistant to viral subversion mechanisms that normally operate in human host cells. The Misra laboratory has identified a new bat coronavirus [7] and a new bat herpesvirus [8] that persistently infect two Canadian bat species with no overt signs of disease. Both viruses infect many, if not most, bats in long-term associations without causing overt disease. The stress of white-nose syndrome, a fungal infection that has decimated some north American bat species, leads to a dramatic increase in corona virus replication in little brown bats, potentially increasing the chances of transmission to other species [9] . Long-term viral persistence followed by stress-induced reactivation could be modeled in tissue-culture where the MERS-coronavirus persistently infected bat cells and the suppression of innate antiviral responses led to increased viral replication [10] . Studying interactions between bat viruses and their natural host may provide key information to prevent future zoonoses.",

This vaccine was safe and efficacious in early clinical trials and was deployed in West Africa in 2013 as an emergency measure to quell an Ebola epidemic by ring vaccination (effectively, a phase III clinical trial) [11] . Lassa virus is an arenavirus endemic across much of West Africa. Rodents are the natural host, and zoonotic transmission to humans can cause severe hemorrhagic fevers in 20% of infected individuals. No Lassa virus vaccine is currently available because even though many candidates have performed well in clinical trials, none have yet shown efficacy and safety in humans. NML researchers developed a Lassa fever vaccine using the same VSV platform previously used to create the successful Ebola vaccine by inserting Lassa virus GPC gene into the VSV platform [12] . Dr. Michael Drebot from the Zoonotic Diseases and Special Pathogens Program at the NML summarized the pre-clinical studies conducted to date on the \"made-in-Canada\" Lassa fever vaccine, which performed well in guinea pig, rhesus and cynomolgus macaque models [13] [14] [15] . Dr. Drebot also described work from Dr. David Safronetz and other colleagues at the NML who are working on the next steps required to bring this vaccine to clinical trials.",

            "text": "The next session on \"Viral Subversion of Host Cell Processes\" opened with a talk on herpesvirus assembly from Dr. Bruce Banfield (Queens University). Herpesviruses replicate in the cell nucleus, where the viral genome is copied into branched concatemers that are trimmed and packaged into newly assembled procapsids. Because these DNA-containing capsids are too large to exit the nucleus via nuclear pores, herpesviruses must transit the nuclear envelope to access the cytoplasm where the final stages of virion maturation occur. This process, called nuclear egress, is achieved by budding of capsids into the inner nuclear membrane yielding an enveloped particle in the perinuclear space. The envelopes of these perinuclear virions then fuse with the outer nuclear membrane releasing DNA-containing capsids into the cytoplasm. Although this fusion mechanism is poorly understood, several groups have partially described the remarkable mechanism of budding, whereby two conserved viral proteins, pUL31 and pUL34, assemble into an oligomeric nuclear egress complex (NEC) on the inner nuclear membrane and facilitate capsid recruitment and budding into the perinuclear space [16, 17] . Dr. Banfield described the herpes simplex virus type-2 (HSV-2) NEC complex, which is sufficient to promote nuclear envelope vesiculation and drive nucleoplasmic invagination of the inner nuclear membrane in transfected cells. However, these nuclear envelope perturbations are not normally seen in cells infected with wild-type HSV-2 strains suggesting that these NEC activities are negatively regulated during infection. The capacity of the NEC to drive the formation of long inner nuclear membrane-derived tubules that extend deep into the nucleus suggest that capsid envelopment could, paradoxically, occur deeper in the nucleus rather than at the nuclear periphery where marginalized cellular chromatin and the nuclear lamina create formidable barriers to capsid envelopment. pUL21 is a tegument protein that is required for efficient nuclear egress of HSV-2 capsids [18] . New data from the Banfield lab demonstrated that enveloped capsids accumulate in inner nuclear membrane bound structures deep within the nucleus of cells infected with UL21 mutant viruses suggesting that: 1) pUL21 negatively regulates the inner nuclear membrane invagination activity of the HSV-2 NEC; and 2) that inner nuclear membrane invaginations can serve as sites of capsid envelopment.",

Dr. Maya Shmulevitz (University of Alberta) described how knowledge of reovirus molecular genetics can be exploited to create mutant viruses that enter and kill cancer cells more effectively without compromising their selectivity towards transformed cells [21] . For example, while virions bearing the full complement of twelve trimeric \u03c31 attachment protein complexes on their surfaces are relatively stable in the natural enteric environment, experimentally reducing the number of these attachment proteins on the virion accelerated uncoating and replication in cancer cells and increased oncolytic potency in a mouse melanoma model [22, 23] . Dr. Shmulevitz also described how \u03c31 attachment protein cleavage by breast cancer metalloproteases dramatically lowered reovirus infectivity. Mutagenesis of defined protease cleavage sites on \u03c31 prevented cleavage and inactivation of reoviruses by breast tumor metalloproteases. These studies suggest that reoviruses are quite amenable to repurposing for superior oncolytic properties.",

In the first talk of the session, Dr. Maxwell described a new host defense mechanism against viral infection. Bacteria have long been known to defend against bacteriophage infection using restriction endonucleases, cell surface modifications and abortive infection systems, and the past 15 years have seen a rapid expansion of our understanding of diverse CRISPR-Cas systems that provide a form of adaptive immune memory for bacteria [24] . All these systems rely on bacterial proteins or protein/RNA complexes to execute antiviral defense. Dr. Maxwell described the discovery of a new chemical defense against phage infection of the soil-dwelling bacteria Streptomyces. These molecules include anthracyclines that act as DNA-intercalating agents that disrupt the early stages of infection by phages with DNA genomes, perhaps by blocking circularization of the incoming linear DNA [25] . Dr. Maxwell showed that Streptomyces bacteria can secrete anthracyclines into the extracellular environment, which are then taken up by neighboring cells to block viral infection. In this way, these chemicals act as broad-spectrum antivirals that can protect and influence the evolution of bacterial communities.",

FMT inevitably transfer bacteriophages as well [28] , but little is known about how transferred phage affect the recipient microbiome. Dr. Alexander Hynes (McMaster University) described studies designed to address this directly by studying crAssphage, the most abundant phage in humans. crAssphage was recently discovered by metagenomic sequencing [29] but its natural bacterial host had not yet been identified. Using PCR and metagenomic analysis, Dr. Hynes's group tracked crAssphage transfer from phage-positive human donors to human FMT recipients or germ-free mice. Studying the bacteria transferred along with the crAssphage into na\u00efve recipients may provide opportunities to discover the elusive crAssphage host.",

Traditionally, flow cytometry has been a very useful approach to study virus infection on a single-cell basis, but viruses themselves have been too small to analyze due to the 0.5 \u00b5m resolution of most instruments. Dr. Lipp\u00e9 described how his research group prepares herpesvirus particles for analysis on these instruments by labelling with nucleic acid dyes that can penetrate viral particles or engineering viral particles with fluorescent fusion proteins (including capsid proteins, tegument proteins or glycoproteins) [34] [35] [36] . This approach enabled characterization of individual HSV-1 particles harvested from different cellular compartments, as well as sorting to >90% purity. Flow virometry also enables the study of the impact of heterogeneity of viral populations on viral fitness and facilitates the analysis by mass spectrometry of highly enriched viral particles isolated along the egress pathway to monitor their maturation. Because flow virometry can be performed on standard flow cytometers and flow sorters available at most institutions, these approaches can be rapidly adopted by others and applied to the study of other large viruses.",

Ryan Noyce (University of Alberta) described his efforts to use the principles of synthetic biology to create a synthetic poxvirus vector that could be used for a variety of therapeutic applications. Edward Jenner believed that his variolae vaccinae originated in horses, which has been corroborated by molecular analyses of modern vaccinia virus (VACV) isolates that share common ancestry with horsepox virus (HPXV) [37] [38] [39] (incidentally, Dr. Noyce told us, this means that the term \"vaccination\" could be a misnomer; cows may have had nothing to do with it, and the term \"equination\" may be more accurate [40] ). To improve on the safety and efficacy of VACV, Dr. Noyce and colleagues chose to reactivate the ancestral HPXV and use it as a template for safer and more efficacious vaccines and other therapeutics including oncolytic viruses. Dr. Noyce synthesized ten large (10-30 kilobase pair) fragments of DNA based on the published HPXV sequence [38] , along with VACV-derived terminal sequences [41] . These sequences were recombined into a 212 kilobase pair live synthetic chimeric (scHPXV) virus in cells infected with Shope fibroma virus (SFV), which served as a helper virus. scHPXV was safe and effective in pre-clinical studies; it produced smaller plaques in cell culture and was less virulent in mice than VACV, but still provided protection against a lethal VACV challenge. Dr. Noyce discussed the technical challenges associated with using synthetic biology as a tool to build new viruses, as well as biosafety and ethical considerations.",

The liver-specific microRNA-122 (miR-122) directly binds to the 5'-end of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) genome and promotes the accumulation of viral RNA in cell culture and animal models, at least in part by protecting the genome from degradation by the host 5'-3' exonucleases Xrn1 and Xrn2. Because the HCV 5'-triphosphate structure is a molecular pattern expected to be recognized by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), the Sagan (McGill University) and Wilson (University of Saskatchewan) groups investigated whether miR-122 binding to the HCV genome affects PRR binding and activation of innate antiviral signaling pathways. Dr. Sagan reported that miR-122 does not affect recognition of the HCV genome by protein kinase R (PKR), retinoic acid inducible protein I (RIG-I)-like receptors, or interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats (IFITs) 1 and 5 [44] . 5'-triphophate-containing RNAs can be converted to 5'-monophosphate RNA by the action of the cytoplasmic pyrophosphatases DOM3Z and DUSP11; they found that RNA silencing of DOM3Z or DUSP11 rescued RNA accumulation of HCV subgenomic replicons in the absence of miR-122, suggesting that miR-122 normally protects the 5'-triphosphate structure on the viral RNA and prevents pyrophosphatase activity and subsequent degradation by Xrn1/2. Using Selective 2' Hydroxyl Acylation analyzed by Primer Extension (SHAPE), the Sagan lab is exploring how mutations in the 5' non-coding region of HCV genomes from patient isolates may help to promote genome stability and relieve HCV's dependence on miR-122. However, there is evidence to support an additional role for miR-122 in the HCV replication cycle beyond genome stabilization.",

            "text": "Influenza A virus infection delivers eight (\u2212)-sense single-stranded viral RNA (vRNA) genome segments to the cell nucleus, each bound to the tripartite viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) complex. To initiate transcription, the RdRp complex simultaneously binds to host RNA polymerase II (Pol II) and 5'-cap structures on nascent host pre-mRNAs. Once in position, the polymerase acidic (PA) subunit of the RdRp complex catalyzes endoribonucleolytic cleavage of host pre-mRNAs at a position 10-15 nucleotides downstream of the 5'-cap structure. This process, known as \"cap-snatching\", enables priming of viral mRNA synthesis. It remains unclear whether there is some selectivity in this process, or the RdRp simply \"snatches\" these primers from the most abundant nearby host pre-mRNAs. Dr. Martin Pelchat (University of Ottawa) described deep sequencing studies that support a more nuanced model of cap-snatching that integrates host pre-mRNA abundance with selectivity, whereby each of the eight RdRp:vRNA complexes acquire distinct subsets of host RNAs due to differences in vRNA untranslated region (UTR) sequence [45, 46] . Importantly, he reported that host mRNAs associated with antiviral responses are over-represented in the cap-snatched population. This suggests that cap-snatching may indeed play an important role in influenza A virus-host shutoff.",

After discussing the weather (as is their custom), the TWiV hosts got down to business with an interview of Drs. Grandvaux and McCormick, who discussed their motivation in founding the CSV, the current research funding climate in Canada, and plans for the new society ( Figure 3 ). They also interviewed Dr. Ryan Noyce from the University of Alberta, who discussed his high-profile synthetic virology (or \"SynViro\") research project, in which he used principles of synthetic biology to create a horsepox virus vector that could be used as the basis for new poxvirus vaccines and oncolytic viruses [41, 48] . This project had been previously discussed on TWiV 478, entitled \"A pox on your horse\" [49] , and received scrutiny in the scientific and mainstream media due to concerns about ethics and potential \"dual-use\" of these new poxviruses. Finally, the TWiV team interviewed Dr. Kate O'Brien from Johns Hopkins University, who discussed her global health research in vaccines, and in particular how certain viruses are etiologically linked to severe pneumonia in the developing world.

N-terminal sequencing by Edman degradation method enabled precise mapping of two protease cleavage sites with the consensus sequence P\u2193xFP. Together, these findings suggest that SMoV polyprotein processing requires two viral proteases, the 3C-like cysteine protease encoded by RNA1, and a novel protease encoded by RNA2 that features two putative glutamic acid residues in the catalytic site. The novel protease domain is only found in the RNA2 polyproteins of two other definite or putative members of the family Secoviridae, suggesting that it was recently acquired.",

Dr. Magor shared a photo of herself as a child cradling her pet duck in Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, and explained how this early love of animals influenced her career path. Ducks are the natural IAV reservoir host; the virus infects the gastrointestinal tract and typically does not cause overt disease. However, the emergence of avian H5N1 IAV strains with pandemic potential have disrupted this balance and can cause lethal infection in ducks. To better understand the pathogenic effects of lethal H5N1 infection in ducks, Dr. Magor established an infection model of White Pekin ducks with three similar H5N1 viruses with known differences in pathogenicity and replication rate [64] . Viral replication and host responses were measured by RT-qPCR at different times post-infection. Viral replication peaked and viral load declined in the spleen over time. The ducks rapidly mounted interferon and cytokine responses that peaked on the first day of infection and declined thereafter, with the strongest responses coming from the high-pathogenic viruses. Further characterization of the duck immune responses to lethal and sub-lethal infections could advance our understanding of virus-host interactions in the reservoir host.",

Following an ovation for the small army of local volunteers who were instrumental to the success of the symposium, Dr. Grandvaux announced the travel awards ( Figure 5 ). We then gathered outside the lecture theatre where we were met by two members of the 78th Highlanders Pipe Band, who marched us through the streets of Halifax and ascended the slopes of the Halifax Citadel National Historic Site ( Figure 6 ). Inside the walls of the star-shaped fortress, Highlanders conducted historic tours in English and French. Then Pipe and Drum sounded once again, and we marched out of the Citadel and down Sackville Street to the historic Alexander Keith's Brewery for an evening featuring local food, drink, and music. A good time was had by all, including Drs. Grandvaux and McCormick, who could be found relaxing in Mr. Keith's leather-bound office following a very successful symposium (Figure 7) , and perhaps twisting a few arms to encourage colleagues to assume leadership positions and host future CSV symposia.
