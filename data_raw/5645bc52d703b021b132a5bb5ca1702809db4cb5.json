Rapid microbiological diagnosis ensures appropriate antimicrobial therapy as well as effective implementation of isolation precautions. The ePlex respiratory pathogen panel (RP panel) is a novel molecular biologybased assay, developed by GenMark Diagnostics, Inc. (Carlsbad, CA), to be performed within a single cartridge for the diagnosis of 25 respiratory pathogens (viral and bacterial). The objective of this study was to compare the performance of the RP panel with those of laboratory-developed real-time PCR assays, using a variety of previously collected clinical respiratory specimens. A total of 343 clinical specimens as well as 29 external quality assessment (EQA) specimens and 2 different Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus isolates have been assessed in this study. The RP panel showed an agreement of 97.4% with the real-time PCR assay regarding 464 pathogens found in the clinical specimens. All pathogens present in clinical samples and EQA samples with a threshold cycle (C T ) value of \u03fd30 were detected correctly using the RP panel. The RP panel detected 17 additional pathogens, 7 of which could be confirmed by discrepant testing. In conclusion, this study shows excellent performance of the RP panel in comparison to real-time PCR assays for the detection of respiratory pathogens. The ePlex system provided a large amount of useful diagnostic data within a short time frame, with minimal hands-on time, and can therefore potentially be used for rapid diagnostic sample-to-answer testing, in either a laboratory or a decentralized setting.",

Community-acquired respiratory tract infections are a leading cause of hospitalization and responsible for substantial morbidity and mortality, especially in infants, the elderly, and immunocompromised patients. The etiological agent in such infections differs greatly according to season and age of patient, with highest prevalences being those of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in children and influenza virus in adults. Rapid microbiological diagnosis of a respiratory infection is important to ensure appropriate antimicrobial therapy and for the effective implementation of isolation precautions (1) .",

Multiplex real-time PCR assays have been developed and implemented for routine diagnostic application, detecting a wide variety of pathogens (2-7). These assays have shown high sensitivity and specificity, but the limited number of fluorophores that can be used per reaction resulted in the need to run several real-time PCR assays to cover a broad range of relevant pathogens. Commercial assays using multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA), a dual priming oligonucleotide system (DPO), or a microarray technology were developed to overcome this problem and are able to detect up to 19 viruses simultaneously (8, 9) . All applications mentioned require nucleic acid extraction prior to amplification. For routine diagnostics, these methods are most suited for batch-wise testing, with a turnaround time of \u03f36 to 8 h. To decrease the time to result and enable random access testing, syndromic diagnostic assays have been developed. These assays combine nucleic acid extraction, amplification, and detection in a single cartridge per sample and are suitable for decentralized or even point-of-care testing (POCT) with a time to result of \u03fd2 h.",

            "text": "The RP panel on the ePlex system enables rapid testing and can be used as a diagnostic system in either a laboratory or a decentralized setting that is closer to the patient. The assay turned out to be rapid and straightforward to perform. Compared to routine testing, hands-on time of the RP panel was very low (\u03fd2 min), whereas the hands-on time of the routine testing was about 30 to 45 min, depending on the nature and number of samples tested. The overall run time of the platforms was also in favor of the ePlex system, as it takes approximately 90 min for nucleic acid extraction, amplification, hybridization, and detection, whereas routine testing takes up to 2 h and 45 min using different systems and multiple real-time PCR assays in multiplex. An important advantage of the ePlex system is the possibility of random access testing, compared to batch-wise testing in the current diagnostic real-time PCR approach. With a relatively short turnaround time and the potential to randomly load and run up to 24 specimens, the ePlex system is very suitable for testing STAT samples, which require immediate testing. In contrast to LDTs, where C T values represent a quantitative indicator, the ePlex system generates qualitative results only. The C T value is dependent on many different factors such as sample type and course of infection and can therefore differ greatly, even within a single patient. Hence, a qualitative result, e.g., identification of the pathogen, is the major factor for patient management. The costs of reagents per sample are relatively high for ePlex compared to LDT. However, when taking into account the hands-on time of technicians and the clinical benefit of more rapid results, the assay will most likely be more cost-effective. Studies evaluating a rapid diagnostic assay for respiratory pathogens, such as the FilmArray respiratory panel (BioFire Diagnostics, Salt Lake City, UT), have already shown the impact of rapid diagnostics for respiratory pathogens, since it decreased the duration of antibiotic use, the length of hospitalization, and the time of isolation, delivering financial savings (13, 14) . Although the RP panel on the ePlex system has the same potential, clinical studies remain to be conducted to fulfill this potential.",
