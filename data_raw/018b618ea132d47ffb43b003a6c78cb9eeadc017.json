Although patient cohort studies have shown the production of CHIKV specific antibodies, the fine specificity of the antibody response against CHIKV is not completely defined. The macaque model of CHIKV infection was established due to limitations of clinical specimens. More importantly, its close relation to humans will allow the study of chronic infection and further identify important CHIKV targets. In this study, serum samples from CHIKV-infected macaques collected at different time-points post infection were used to characterize the antibody production pattern and kinetics. Results revealed that anti-CHIKV antibodies were neutralizing and the E2 glycoprotein, Capsid, nsP1, nsP3 and nsP4 proteins were targets of the anti-CHIKV antibody response in macaques. Furthermore, linear B-cell epitopes recognized by these anti-CHIKV antibodies were identified, and mapped to their structural localization. This characterizes the specificity of anti-CHIKV antibody response in macaques and further demonstrates the importance of the different regions in CHIKV-encoded proteins in the adaptive immune response. Information from this study provides critical knowledge that will aid in the understanding of CHIKV infection and immunity, vaccine design, and pre-clinical efficacy studies.",

CHIKV belongs to the genus Alphavirus of the family Togaviridae and is an enveloped virus with a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome [3] . The 12kb RNA genome is capped at the 59 end and polyadenylated at the 39 end and consists of two open reading frames coding for four nonstructural proteins (nsP1-4), three major structural proteins (Capsid, E1, and E2) and two small cleavage products (E3 and 6K) [3, 4] . The E1 and E2 glycoproteins form heterodimers that associate as trimeric spikes on the virion surface while E3 and 6K were demonstrated to act as helper proteins in the budding and maturation process of the virion envelope [5] [6] [7] .",

The Aedes species of mosquito has been the major arthropod vector associated with CHIKV transmission to humans [15] . CHIKV infection usually leads to the development of CHIKF and is characterized by an abrupt onset of fever, headache, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, rash, myalgia, and severe arthralgia.

High levels of CHIKV-specific IgG antibody responses were detected at 16 dpi ( Figure 1A ) confirming previous observations [17] . Even though the IgG levels decreased over time, they were still detectable at 180 dpi ( Figure 1A ). To determine if the anti-CHIKV antibodies were neutralizing, in vitro infection of HEK 293T cells with different CHIKV isolates (IMT and SGP11) was carried out in the presence of sera from CHIKV-infected macaques ( Figure 1B and 1C ) [29] . Serum samples from CHIKV-infected macaques contained antibodies that displayed neutralizing activity when assessed in sero-neutralization assays [16, 17] with the highest neutralizing efficiency for samples taken at 16 dpi ( Figure 1C ). Interestingly, a stronger neutralizing activity against IMT was observed when compared to SGP11 for samples at 16 dpi, at a dilution of 1:800 ( Figure 1C ). This is not unexpected as these macaques were experimentally infected with the LR2006 OPY-1 isolate that is more closely related to the IMT isolate. The presence of neutralizing antibodies in the sera of CHIKV-infected macaques was sustained till 180 dpi, although less efficiently than sera at 16 dpi ( Figure 1C ).",

            "text": "To better define the antigenic recognition profile of the antibodies from CHIKV-infected macaques, we used CHIKVinfected cell lysates to determine which CHIKV antigens were recognized by the macaque antibodies ( Figure 2A) . None of the non-structural proteins (nsPs) were recognized by antibodies in the serum samples taken at 16 or 180 dpi ( Figure 2B ). The serum contained antibodies against E2 glycoprotein and Capsid protein ( Figure 2B and S1). Anti-E2 and anti-Capsid antibodies persisted till 180 dpi. In addition, CHIKV virions were purified from supernatant of cells infected with CHIKV isolates from Reunion Island (IMT) [25] , or from Singapore (SGP11) [27] . Protein extracts were prepared under reducing or non-reducing conditions as described [29, 30] , and were then assessed by immunoblot assays using serum samples from CHIKV-infected macaques ( Figure 2C ). This first screen revealed that these serum samples contained antibodies recognizing multiple proteins from two isolates of CHIKV. A stronger reactivity against proteins prepared under non-reducing conditions compared to proteins prepared under reducing conditions indicated that the serum samples contained antibodies recognizing both linear and disulfide bonds dependent conformational epitopes ( Figure 2C ) [35] . Similar reactivity was observed between two closely related CHIKV isolates (IMT and SGP11) that have more than 99% amino acid sequence similarity [36] , suggesting that the two isolates present epitopes that are common or similar in part and are recognized by a fraction of the Figure 1 . Antibody profiles of sera from CHIKV-infected macaques. A, Virus-specific IgG and IgM antibody titers in serum samples, at a dilution of 1:2,000 were determined by ELISA using purified CHIK virions. Serum samples from CHIKV-infected macaques (n = 1-3) were collected at 16 and 180 dpi and subjected to virion-based ELISA, using 96-well plates pre-coated with purified CHIKV (IMT) virions. Sera from non-infected macaques were used as negative controls. Data are presented as mean 6 SD and representative of 2 independent experiments with similar results. B, Visualization of CHIKV by immunofluorescence in CHIKV-infected cultures after seroneutralization. Virus samples were pre-incubated with heatinactivated sera from CHIKV-infected macaques collected at 16 and 180 dpi, before being added to HEK 293T cells. Infection without pre-incubation with sera (No sera) was used as a control. Analysis was performed at 6 hours post-infection (hpi). Scale bar in white: 50 mm. Representative microscopic images for each treatment condition (macaque sera dilution at 1:800) are shown. C, In vitro neutralizing activity of sera from CHIKVinfected macaques. Samples (Healthy macaque sera, 16 and 180 dpi) were tested against IMT or SGP11 viruses, in triplicates at a dilution 1:800 for healthy macaque sera; between 1:100 and 1:800 for CHIKV-infected macaque sera. Results are representative of 3 independent experiments, presented as mean 6 SD, and expressed as percentage of control infection. *p,0.05, Mann-Whitney U test. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0095647.g001",

B, Total cell lysates were prepared from CHIKV-infected 293T cells and mock-infected 293T cells. Lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis (Left lane -mock-infected lysates, right lane -CHIKV-infected lysates) and probed with sera from CHIKV-infected macaques at a dilution of 1:2,000, followed by HRP-conjugated anti-monkey IgG secondary antibodies. The arrows at the top panel indicate the CHIKV antigens (Capsid and E2) detected by antibodies in the sera of CHIKV-infected macaques. Arrows at the middle panel (non-structural proteins) and the lower panel (structural proteins) indicate CHIKV proteins detected by corresponding CHIKV antigen-specific rabbit sera performed at a dilution of 1:2,000 followed by HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibodies.

Mapping of CHIKV B-cell epitopes within CHIKV proteome. Sera from CHIKV-infected macaques (16 and 180 dpi) were diluted 1:2,000 and subjected to peptide-based ELISA with a peptide library covering the CHIKV proteome, using pooled peptides (named P1, P2, etc) from the structural (A, Capsid, B, E2) and non-structural (C, nsP1, D, nsP3 and E, nsP4) proteins. Sera from non-infected macaques were used as negative controls. *Pooled peptides were considered to contain positive linear B-cell epitopes when OD values obtained with sera from CHIKV-infected macaques were above mean +3 SD of the OD values obtained with sera from non-infected macaques. Data are presented as OD values obtained using sera from infected macaques, minus the OD values obtained using sera from non-infected macaques, for the corresponding pooled peptides. Data represent an average of two independent experiments (mean 6 SD). doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0095647.g003 (LR2006 OPY-1) were collected over a 6-month period [22] . Anti-CHIKV antibody profiles were followed longitudinally through different post-infection phases ( Figure 4 ). All the macaques presented with fever, rash and lymphopenia, and exhibited signs of inflammation as indicated by cytokine patterns and biochemistry assays, from 1 to 6-8 dpi [22] . The 9 dpi time point in the acute phase was the earliest time point when specific anti-CHIKV antibodies were detected (Figure 4 ). At 9 dpi, 90% of the total signal came from IgM that was no longer detectable at 16 dpi, in the early convalescent phase. Furthermore, at 16 dpi, the first detectable levels of IgG were also observed. Importantly, the later time-points of 100 and 180 dpi in the recovery phase allowed the plateau and persistence of the IgG specific response to be assessed, while levels of IgM were no longer detectable (data not shown). Next, to define the location of the linear B-cell epitopes, the complete set of single peptides from each of the antibody-binding peptide pools identified in Figure 3 , was screened with serum samples. The positions of the epitope sequences within the nonstructural and structural proteins are illustrated in the schematic diagrams ( Figure 4A ). The two recognized regions for the Capsid protein are located at the N-and C-terminus of the protein while the epitopes for the E2 glycoprotein are distributed along the entire protein. On the other hand, antibodies from the macaque serum samples failed to recognize any regions in the 6K protein and E1 glycoprotein. Comparison of the reactivity between the two time-points showed that antibodies recognized the linear epitopes in Capsid, and in the immunodominant E2 region in a concerted manner ( Figure 4B ).",

Results showed two structural proteins (Capsid protein and E2 glycoprotein) and three nonstructural proteins (nsP1, nsP3 and nsP4 proteins) contained linear epitopes that were recognized by macaque anti-CHIKV antibodies. Experimental infection of macaques induced antibodies not only against the structural proteins, but also against several non-structural proteins.

Specifically, high levels of antibodies from CHIKV-infected patients were targeted against a linear B-cell epitope called E2EP3 during the acute phase of CHIKV infection [17] . Here, E2EP3 is one of the major B-cell linear epitopes recognized by antibodies from the sera of all CHIKV-infected macaques during the early phase of disease (amino acids 2800-2818, Table 1 ). This verifies that the presence of anti-E2EP3 antibodies is a common marker for early CHIKV infection in both humans and macaques [17] .

However, anti-CHIKV antibodies against two ASR epitopes (amino acids 2961-2978, and 3025-3066, Table 1 ) were detected in the sera of experimentally infected macaques. Furthermore, these two ASR epitopes were immunodominant from the early convalescent to recovery phase, contrary to the immunodominance of the E2EP3 epitope observed in natural human CHIKV infection [17, 29] . The observation that one of the ASR epitopes (amino acids 3025-3058) is important in both natural human infection and experimental macaque infection, suggests that this epitope could be useful for vaccine development.",

Here, we further demonstrated this phenomenon in the non-human primate model. Infection of macaques with the LR2006-OPY1 isolate, which encodes K 252 in the E2 glycoprotein, strongly induced anti-CHIKV antibodies against a particular linear B-cell epitope (amino acids 3025-3066) at 16 dpi. In line with this, we observed significantly stronger neutralizing activity against the IMT isolate (encoding K 252 in E2) compared to the SGP11 isolate (encoding Q 252 in E2) ( Figure 1C) . These data complement a separate study that showed stronger neutralizing antibody response in animals infected with the ECSA strain (DHS-4263) compared to animals infected with the West African strain (37997) [24] . Paradoxically, the difference in neutralizing capacity observed here was lost in macaque sera taken at 180 dpi. Incidentally, sera taken at this time point also had relatively low levels of anti-CHIKV antibodies against the same B-cell epitope (amino acids 3025-3066). These observations highlight the importance of incorporating various components in antigen preparation for CHIKV vaccine development. Epitope sequences covering all the relevant isolates from various geographical regions will be favored in order to offer complete coverage against CHIKV infections globally.",

In these models, the protective effect was closely associated to the generation of neutralizing antibodies, but only few have reported on the exact epitopes involved [50, 52] . Our previous work in CHIKV-infected macaques showed that natural infection led to viral persistence in all macaques tested up to 90 dpi [22] despite a robust innate immune response that was protective in vitro. As such, a comprehensive study on the exact targets of infection-versus vaccination-induced antibodies will provide more information about antibody-mediated protection against the chronic CHIKV infection observed in macaques.
