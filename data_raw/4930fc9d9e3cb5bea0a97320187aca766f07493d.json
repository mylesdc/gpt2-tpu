            "text": "Background: Public health risks associated to infection by human coronaviruses remain considerable and vaccination is a key option for preventing the resurgence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). We have previously reported that antibodies elicited by a SARS-CoV vaccine candidate based on recombinant, full-length SARS-CoV Spike-protein trimers, trigger infection of immune cell lines. These observations prompted us to investigate the molecular mechanisms and responses to antibody-mediated infection in human macrophages. Methods: We have used primary human immune cells to evaluate their susceptibility to infection by SARS-CoV in the presence of anti-Spike antibodies. Fluorescence microscopy and real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were utilized to assess occurrence and consequences of infection. To gain insight into the underlying molecular mechanism, we performed mutational analysis with a series of truncated and chimeric constructs of fragment crystallizable \u03b3 receptors (Fc\u03b3R), which bind antibody-coated pathogens. Results: We show here that anti-Spike immune serum increased infection of human monocyte-derived macrophages by replication-competent SARS-CoV as well as Spike-pseudotyped lentiviral particles (SARS-CoVpp). Macrophages infected with SARS-CoV, however, did not support productive replication of the virus. Purified anti-viral IgGs, but not other soluble factor(s) from heat-inactivated mouse immune serum, were sufficient to enhance infection. Antibody-mediated infection was dependent on signaling-competent members of the human Fc\u03b3RII family, which were shown to confer susceptibility to otherwise na\u00efve ST486 cells, as binding of immune complexes to cell surface Fc\u03b3RII was necessary but not sufficient to trigger antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection. Furthermore, only Fc\u03b3RII with intact cytoplasmic signaling domains were competent to sustain ADE of SARS-CoVpp infection, thus providing additional information on the role of downstream signaling by Fc\u03b3RII. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that human macrophages can be infected by SARS-CoV as a result of IgG-mediated ADE and indicate that this infection route requires signaling pathways activated downstream of binding to Fc\u03b3RII receptors.",

More recently, we demonstrated that anti-Spike antibody potentiates infection of both monocytic and lymphoid immune cell lines, not only by SARS-CoVpp but also by replication-competent SARS-coronavirus [16] , thus providing evidence for a novel and versatile mechanism by which SARS-CoV can enter into target cells that do not express the conventional ACE2 virus receptor and are otherwise refractory to the virus.

In addition to monocytes, human macrophages were also infected by SARS-CoV in presence of anti-Spike antibodies only. ADE-mediated infection of macrophages, however, did not support productive replication of the virus.

            "text": "Primary human macrophages are susceptible to SARS-CoV infection through antibody-mediated pathway Because our previous observations revealed that a human monocytic cell line THP-1 was susceptible to ADE of infection [16] , we investigated the occurrence of ADE of infection in primary human macrophages in vitro, firstly by taking advantage of SARS-CoVpp that can be safely used to mimic the viral entry process [15, 17] . We found that SARS-CoVpp opsonized with a 1:1000 dilution of anti-Spike serum readily infected over 80% of primary human macrophages, as determined by immunofluorescence staining of firefly luciferase at 72 hours post infection (h.p.i.). By contrast, cells exposed to SARS-CoVpp opsonized with control serum did not show any positive staining of the luciferase reporter protein (Figure 1 ). These experiments extend our previous observations and indicate that anti-Spike antibodies facilitate infection of SARS-CoVpp into human macrophages. We next tested whether this altered tropism was also displayed by replicationcompetent SARS-CoV. Human macrophages were infected at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 with the same dilutions of anti-Spike or control immune serum and the infection pattern was examined by both immunofluorescence staining of SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein and real-time quantitative PCR measurement of viral RNAs. Positive immunofluorescence signals were detected only at 6 h.p.i. when SARS-CoV was opsonized with both control and anti-Spike serum ( Figure 2 ). Interestingly, whereas presence of control serum led to only modest infection by SARS-CoV (~5% of cells), a 4-fold increase in the percentage of positive cells was noted in the presence of anti-Spike serum for two out of three donors ( Figure 2 ). Such enhanced infection pattern was paralleled by the number of viral gene copies measured ( Figure 3 ). Thus, compared to inoculums containing control serum, there was a 2 to 3-fold increase in the detection of both positive and negative strands of viral genes in macrophages infected in presence of anti-Spike serum, which was more pronounced at 1 and 6 h.p.i. There was a rapid decline in viral RNA from 6 to 24 h.p.i. for both conditions and no further changes were detected at later time points ( Figure 3 ). However, it should be noted that the primer set used for the nucleocapsid gene could also detect the negative strand of the viral genomic RNA and could not distinguish it from sub-genomic material. In addition, we measured by real-time quantitative PCR copies of both viral nucleocapsid and ORF1b genes in culture supernatants to determine the release of SARS-CoV particles from the infected macrophages. Copy numbers of both viral RNAs, however, remained unchanged at all the selected time points during the course of the experiment (less than 200 copies/\u03bcl), regardless of whether macrophages had been infected in the presence of either control or anti-Spike serum (data not shown).",

In the context of ADE, antibodies against viral proteins are considered as the major players of enhancement [18, 19] ; see for review [20, 21] . To eliminate the possibility of the participation of other soluble factors during ADE of SARS, in this section we investigated the capability of anti-Spike antibodies alone in enhancing infection of immune cells. We purified IgG by protein G-sepharose chromatography from mouse anti-Spike and control serum, and used 2fold serial dilutions from 10 to 0.125 \u03bcg/mL of the purified portion to form immune complex with SARS-CoVpp and then infected Raji cells. Our results show that purified IgG from mouse anti-Spike serum triggered infection in Raji cells, which was more pronounced with increasing immunoglobulin concentrations ( Figure 4 ). The flow-through (FT) from the same serum, which was diluted by the appropriate factor to be comparable to the final IgG concentration used, elicited no detectable infection at all concentrations (data not shown). Significant differences between ADE of infection with purified mouse anti-Spike IgG and flow-through were observed at concentrations 10 and 2.5 \u03bcg/mL, and marginal difference was observed at 0.625 \u03bcg/mL. As expected, neither purified IgG ( Figure 4 ) nor flow-through from mouse control serum triggered significant ADE of infection at all concentrations.",

            "text": "Our recent work had revealed the predominant role of human Fc\u03b3RII (CD32) in mediating ADE of SARS-CoV [16] . To gain further insight into the underlying molecular mechanism we have investigated the involvement of different domains of Fc\u03b3RII in mediating ADE. To this end we produced a series of truncated constructs that only carried ectodomain and transmembrane domains of Fc\u03b3RII, and chimeric constructs with the ectodomain of one receptor and transmembrane and endodomain of another ( Figure 5A ). We then verified the expression of these constructs on ST486 cells by flow cytometry using a specific monoclonal antibody (clone FLI8.26) that binds to the second Ig-like domain D2\u03b3 of Fc\u03b3RII. Of note, the Fc binding portion of the Fc\u03b3RII group is very similar among Fc\u03b3RIIA-H131, Fc\u03b3RIIA-R131, Fc\u03b3RIIB1 [22] and also Fc\u03b3RIIB2, as it harbors identical extracellular structures as Fc\u03b3RIIB1. Our findings indicate that all Fc\u03b3RII constructs exhibited detectable expression of Fc\u03b3RII (dark grey) in ST486 cells in comparison to isotype control (light grey) ( Figure 5B ). We then tested the ability of the various constructs to bind purified anti-Spike IgG-SARS-CoVpp immune complexes and observed that all ST486 transfectants were able to bind immune complexes ( Figure 5C ). Finally we investigated whether any difference in susceptibility to SARS-CoVpp ADE of infection was conferred by different Fc\u03b3RII constructs. When immune complexes formed by 5 \u03bcg/mL of purified mouse anti-Spike IgG (the concentration at which the highest infection level was observed in Raji cells) and SARS-CoVpp were added to Fc\u03b3RII-expressing ST486 cells, all four transfectants expressing wildtype Fc\u03b3RII forms (cf. Fc\u03b3RIIA-H vs. Fc\u03b3RIIA-R, and Fc\u03b3RIIB1 vs. Fc\u03b3RIIB2, corresponding to constructs 1, 5, 9, 10, respectively) were infected ( Figure 5D ), with Fc\u03b3RIIA-expressing ST486 being more prone to infection than Fc\u03b3RIIB (cf, constructs 1 and 5 with 9). All the endodomain-truncated constructs (Fc\u03b3RIIA-H.\u0394IC, Fc\u03b3RIIA-R.\u0394IC and Fc\u03b3RIIB.\u0394IC, corresponding to constructs 2, 6, 11 respectively) were not susceptible to ADE of infection, indicating that binding of anti-Spike IgG-SARS-CoVpp immune complexes was not sufficient to mediate entry and that the signaling-competent endodomain was required. However, not all chimeric constructs were able to sustain ADE of infection, suggesting that domain swapping may have partially interfered with signal transduction. Thus only chimeras with Fc\u03b3RIIA-H ectodomain and Fc\u03b3RIIB1 endomain, or with Fc\u03b3RIIB ectodomain and Fc\u03b3RIIA endomain, exhibited a statistically significant ADE of infection ( Figure 5D ). This cannot be explained by differences in surface expression or binding of opsonized pseudoparticles, as Fc\u03b3RIIB.EC/ IIA.IC (viz., construct 12) showed robust ADE despite one of the lowest binding ability of immune-complexes.",

            "text": "The possibility that immune response to pathogens may have also deleterious effects on the host homeostasis has been the focus of several studies. For example, the hyper-induction of cytokines following avian influenza infection has been implicated in the severity of the disease [23] and infection of cells by ADE has been known to occur for several viral diseases [20, 21] . Here we demonstrate that anti-Spike antibody potentiates infection Although we unambiguously obtained evidence of ongoing infection (e.g., de novo synthesis of the structural viral protein N), ADE-infected macrophages did not support productive replication of SARS-CoV and, after initiation of viral gene transcription and viral protein synthesis, the replication process stalled ultimately ending in an abortive viral cycle without detectable release of progeny virus. Abortive replication of SARS-CoV into macrophages has already been documented [24] but, at variance with this previous report in which 90% of the macrophages were infected by SARS-CoV in the absence of immune-serum (MOI = 1-2), we observed a much lower infection rate (about 5-7%). One possibility is that such discrepancy may be due to difference of time of sampling (6 hours in our study versus 15 hours in Cheung's study) and the protocol used for in vitro differentiation (viz., macrophages were differentiated in the presence of fetal calf serum in our study, and autologous plasma was removed two days prior to infection in ref. [8] ), leading to difference in infectivity of the cells observed in the studies. Alternatively, we should also consider that the readout of the pseudo-particle experiments was the expression of the luciferase reporter gene, which is under the control of the HIV backbone. This may lead to higher level of protein expression when compared to the abortive replication that follows SARS-CoV infection of macrophages. Thus, the difference may be, in part due to the inability to detect low amounts of Spike protein by immunofluorescence and the difference in sensitivity of the two methods. Of note, the anti-Spike mediated entry is specific for Spike-pseudotyped particles, as shown in Figure 1 of [16] .",

            "text": "In general, studies aiming at better understanding antibody-dependent enhancement of viral infections are focusing on either identifying the (immune) receptor(s) and/or serum component(s) allowing penetration of the pathogen into the target cell, also known as extrinsic ADE, or the outcome response(s) of the target cell downstream to ADE of infectionor intrinsic ADE [20, 21, 28] . Our previous results demonstrated that only Fc\u03b3RIIA and, to a lesser extent, Fc\u03b3RIIB1 triggered infection by SARS-CoVpp in presence of anti-Spike serum [16] . Although it would have been desirable to perform Fc\u03b3R blocking experiments also in macrophages, coexpression of all Fc\u03b3Rs in these cells [29, 30] However, the relationship between internalization of immune complexes and ADE of infection by SARS-CoV via Fc\u03b3RIIs appears to be a complex process. Thus, Fc\u03b3RIIB2 has been shown to mediate internalization of immune complexes at a faster rate than Fc\u03b3RIIA [33] , whereas we found that ADE of infection via Fc\u03b3RIIA was more prominent than with Fc\u03b3RIIB. Recently, involvement of downstream signaling triggered by Fc\u03b3Rs activation has been evaluated with respect to ADE of dengue virus infection [34] . Thus, abrogation of Fc\u03b3RI and Fc\u03b3RII signaling competency was associated with significant impairment of phagocytosis, but only the signaling-incompetent Fc\u03b3RI become unable to trigger ADE of dengue virus. Conversely, no discernible effect on dengue virus immune complex infectivity was observed for both wild type and signaling incompetent Fc\u03b3RIIA. These findings point to fundamental differences between Fc\u03b3RIA and Fc\u03b3RIIA with respect to their immuneenhancing capabilities and suggest that different mechanisms of dengue virus immune complex internalization may operate between these Fc\u03b3Rs [34] .",

            "text": "Altogether our results demonstrate that, in presence of vaccine-elicited antiviral antibodies, SARS-CoV displays an altered tropism toward primary human immune cells, which do not express the conventional virus receptor and are otherwise refractory to the virus. A number of SARS vaccine candidates have been tested in experimental animal models [35, 36] , many of them based on the viral Spike glycoprotein previously identified as the most immunogenic antigen inducing neutralizing and protective antibodies [14, 15, 37, 38] . Of note, some vaccines against animal coronaviruses have been also generated, but their development has proven difficult due to immune [39] [40] [41] . Despite the fact that this alternative infection pathway appears to have a limited impact, it remains of interest to appreciate the cost of antibody-mediated SARS-CoV infection on the functionality of the target cells, in order to have a broad understanding of the tropism and pathogenesis of the virus and evaluate potential pitfalls associated with immunization against human coronaviruses. This aspect is gaining more relevance as the emergence of the MERS-CoV further indicates that the availability of vaccines targeting this group of viruses, which have demonstrated the ability to jump species, is one of the few options available to prevent the spread of infections causing severe diseases with high mortality in humans [42] .",

HEK293T cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), 0.6 mg/l penicillin and 60 mg/l (hFc\u03b3RIIB2) . B) Surface expression in stably transduced ST486 cell lines was evaluated by flow cytometry using a mouse monoclonal anti-Fc\u03b3RII antibodies (dark grey) or isotype control (light grey), and expressed as mean fluorescence intensity in Arbitrary Units (AU) as described under Materials and methods. Constructs are identified by Arabic numbers and grouped from top to bottom as indicated in A. C) Immune complex-binding ability of wild-type, truncated and chimeric Fc\u03b3R receptors. SARS-CoVpp were incubated with purified mouse anti-Spike IgG (dark grey) or control IgG (light grey) to form immune complexes, which were then added to the ST486 transfectants (see Materials and methods). After washing and fixation, bound immune complexes were detected by flow cytometry with an FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse F(ab')2, and results shown as in B. Constructs are identified by Arabic numbers and grouped from top to bottom as indicated in A. D) Susceptibility of ST486 transfectants to ADE of infection by SARS-CoVpp. SARS-CoVpp were incubated with purified mouse anti-Spike IgG (dark grey) or control IgG (light grey) and then used to infect cells (see Materials and methods). Cells were washed and three days post infection incubation was stopped by adding luciferase substrate to measure enzymatic activity, which was expressed as Relative Luminescence Units (RLU).

For quantification of SARS-CoV gene copies, cDNA was generated in separate reactions in presence of either forward or reverse primers specific for the nucleocapsid and ORF1b genes ( Table 1 ) that amplified negative and positive strand viral RNAs, respectively. This assay allows distinguishing between signals generated by entry of input virus from downstream events reflecting an active replication process [47] . Specific primers (Table 1) and TaqMan Minor Groove Binder probes used for detection of SARS-CoV nucleocapsid gene have been previously described [48] . However, it should be noted that the primer set used for the nucleocapsid gene could also detect the negative strand of the viral genomic RNA and could not distinguish it from sub-genomic material. The qPCR assay was carried out in a final volume of 20 \u03bcl and the fluorescence signal was detected with a LightCycler 480-II (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany) programmed as follows: 95\u00b0C for 10 min, followed by 45 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 10 sec, 60\u00b0C for 30 sec, and 72\u00b0C for 1 sec. Results were expressed as the number of target copies per 10 8 copies of the 18S rRNA gene, which was used to normalize results. To ensure the consistency of qPCR measurements over the time period of the study, the same batches of primers and probes were employed.

After fixation, cells were permeabilized for intracellular staining of SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein, which was revealed by TRITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (orange) while cell nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue). Images shown are representatives of the results obtained with macrophages from three donors at 6 hours post infection. Scale bar: 20 \u03bcm.

Positive and negative RNA strands were determined for SARS-CoV nucleocapsid (A) and ORF1b (B) at the specified time points (hours) post infection (h.p.i.) using real-time qPCR. Data are shown as the number of viral RNA copies normalized to that of 10 8 copies of 18S rRNA in the corresponding sample.
