Taxonomical profiling of the sequencing reads did not reveal sequence similarities to any known virus. Subsequent application of de novo assembly tools to the sequencing reads produced contigs, of which three showed some similarity to the L, M, and S segments of viruses belonging to the Orthobunyavirus genus. Further refinement of these contigs resulted in high-quality, full-length genomic sequences of the three genomic segments (L, M and S) of a novel Orthobunyavirus.",

Interactions between humans and animals are the paramount driving force for the ever-growing distribution and emergence of novel viruses. Other reasons for the spread of new viruses include climate change, globalization, social mobilization and intensive farming 1-3 . A novel virus might emerge in the form of an outbreak, and in this scenario, rapid diagnosis is of extreme importance for the selection of prevention and treatment strategies. However, such a diagnosis is not trivial, especially for RNA viruses, since the viruses in this category have small but highly variable genomes 4 . Viruses can be identified by a wide range of techniques. Traditional methods rely on morphological characteristics observed by light microscopy or transmission electron microscopy (TEM) in various specimens such as cell cultures and fertilized eggs. Serology, as well as antibody-based diagnostics, allow to identify the virus and in some cases even at the species level. However, these methods provide only morphological clues, depend on the availability of an antiserum and, for the most part, are not strain specific 5 . In recent decades, molecular methods such as PCR, RT-PCR and microarrays, which are in most cases more sensitive than traditional techniques, have been used to complement and even replace traditional techniques. However, most of the molecular assays bromide gel electrophoresis. The agarose gel was then visualized under UV light using a Bio-Rad Gel Doc 2000 gel documentation system. A 50-bp DNA ladder (Cat# N3236L, New England Biolabs) was used for RT-PCR product size determination.",

Studies that have tried to identify unknown RNA viruses by using HTS have been conducted mostly in less-relevant clinical samples (i.e., brain) and provided diagnoses in shorter time frames because they did not require culture first, while other studies have typically obtained between tens to a few thousands of viral reads, a number that might be sufficient for resequencing against a model organism but not for characterizing novel viruses 12-20 . In this study, an HTS-based approach was applied to identify the origin of a viral pathogen found to be present in plasma obtained from a hyperimmune horse 21 . To this end, we have established a straightforward procedure that includes virus enrichment in cell culture followed by RNA extraction from the growth medium, rapid library preparation, sequencing and in-depth data analyses.

To identify the virus in the sample, we initially utilized two rapid bioinformatic tools, MetaPhlAn2 and Pathoscope, which profile obtained reads by comparing the reads to databases of microbial genomic sequences. MetaPhlAn2 maps reads against a database of predefined clade-specific genetic markers originating from bacterial, fungal and viral genomes, while Pathoscope uses various databases of whole-genome sequences, containing over 10,000 complete bacterial, fungal and viral genome sequences. However, no significant viral hits were found by either computational method, indicating that the viral sequence is not present in the databases currently used for analysis. Four percent of the reads could be attributed to bacterial and fungal sequences or to controls that were added to the sample (PhiX174 and carrier RNA). Approximately 78% of the reads were mapped to the green monkey (C. sabaeus) genome, while in the negative control sample, over 90% of the reads were mapped, implying that these reads originated from the Vero cells. Notably, a significant portion of the reads (18%) could not be assigned to sequences in the databases. We hypothesized that the as-yet-unidentified viral sequences might be among these reads. To determine the origins of these unmapped reads, we applied a de novo assembly approach in order to obtain long continuous sequences (contigs) and reconstruct the viral sequence. Such contigs may then be subjected to sequence similarity searches against the entire NCBI nr/nt nucleotide collection and to characterization of the genome sequence of the virus.",

Following the removal of sequences originating from the Vero host cells, the remaining reads were subjected to analysis by the Velvet assembler using optimized parameters obtained automatically from the multithreaded script VelvetOptimiser (see Methods). The assembly resulted in eight contigs with lengths ranging from 255 to 6834 bases (Table 1 ). In the control sample no relevant contigs were found. Each contig was subjected to a sequence similarity search against the nr/nt nucleotide collection using BLAST. Of these eight contigs, four (contigs 5 to 8) were highly similar to rRNA sequences, while one contig (contig 2) matched the PhiX174 genome. BLAST results for contigs 1, 3 and 4 did not show a complete match with any sequence in the database, with the best hits exhibiting less than 70% identity; contigs 1, 3 and 4 most resembled the L, M and S genomic segments, respectively, of viruses from the Orthobunyavirus genus (Fig. 2) . Notably, the lengths of the contigs were in best agreement with the typical lengths of the Orthobunyavirus genomic segments and substantially differed from those of other genera in the Bunyavirales order (Table 2 ). These results are consistent with the assignment of the generated sequences to the Orthobunyavirus genus, while the low sequence homology to known Orthobunyavirus sequences suggests the classification of this virus as a new species. Notably, the morphology of the virus, as observed by TEM, is consistent with this classification. We named the virus Ness Ziona virus (NZV) after the location it was discovered in. To verify the presence of NZV in the horse plasma, we designed a specific NZV RT-PCR test based on the assembled NZV S genomic segment. The test was conducted on the original plasma before culturing (H234) and after culturing (H234-Vero). A plasma sample taken from the same horse before infection (H210) was used as a control. The presence of the expected 162-bp band confirmed the existence of NZV in the infected H234 plasma and its absence from the preinfection sample ( Supplementary Fig. 3 ).",

In-depth analysis of the NZV sequence revealed that some of the segment termini lacked this consensus sequence. We therefore applied an additional algorithm for de novo assembly using the SPAdes tool. This analysis resulted in contigs that were similar to but longer than those obtained from the Velvet algorithm, and these contigs included the conserved sequences at all termini, which were flanked by short sequences that were apparently host-derived [25] [26] [27] . To further refine and verify the sequences of the three segments, we realigned the original sequencing reads to the longer sequences obtained from SPAdes and removed low-quality alignments. This procedure resulted in high-quality, manually curated, www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ complete genomic sequences of the three segments of NZV. The complete genomic sequences were annotated and deposited in the NCBI GenBank (accession numbers MH018032, MH018033, and MH018034 for the L, M, and S segments, respectively). Comparison of the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of each of these NZV segments revealed that the novel virus contains a similar consensus sequence as other Orthobunyavirus species (Fig. 3) .

Previous experiments conducted by our group demonstrated that although the growth medium fraction contained less RNA than the cell pellet, the viral RNA was enriched in that fraction (data not shown). We used the QIAamp Viral Mini Kit for extraction and purification of the RNA since this is most suitable kit for the subnanogram amounts of RNA commonly present in the growth medium fraction. We found that carrier RNA, which was added to improve the yield of the extraction, normalized the amount of initial RNA needed for library preparation and did not interfere with downstream processes, improving upon previous protocols that included a carrier RNA depletion step [32] [33] [34] . We chose to prepare the HTS libraries using the SMARTer Pico RNA Kit for several reasons. The initial RNA amount requirements for this kit are among the lowest for commercial kits, and the RNA concentrations obtained from the RNA extraction step are within the required range. This kit uses random (and not oligo-dT) priming for first-strand synthesis and proprietary SMART technology for template switching and second-strand synthesis. These unique features favor the probability of obtaining full-length transcripts, even from nonpolyadenylated viruses, as in our case. In addition, depletion of the ribosomal cDNA originating from host cells is integrated into the kit and allows whole library preparation to be performed in a single tube and in a relatively short amount of time.",

Nevertheless, a prerequisite for successful identification of a microbial agent by these tools is the existence of the sequence of the organism in the databases used to analyze the data. In the current study, NZV was discovered to be a novel Orthobunyavirus and thus could not be recognized by these profiling tools. We therefore applied a complementary approach based on de novo assembly that did not require any prior knowledge of the sequences of the organisms present in the sample. We used two different algorithms for the de novo assembly, namely, Velvet and SPAdes, which produced similar results, although Velvet was somewhat more stringent and thus gave slightly shorter contigs. Three of the resulting contigs could be assigned to the L, M and S segments of NZV. After a refinement step, where the contigs were used as references to map the reads, and after filtering out the low-quality alignments, we obtained the complete sequences of the three segments of the virus. Determination of whole-genomic sequences is the gold standard in genomic characterization and allowed in-depth characterization of NZV. The characterization included the prediction of ORFs, identification of the consensus sequences of the genomic termini, and phylogenetic classification; the phylogenetic classification closely resembled the serogroup classification. Notably, segments L and S showed high homology with other Orthobunyavirus members throughout the segments, while segment M exhibited lower homology in the central region and higher homologies in the flanks (Fig. 2) . Segment M of Orthobunyavirus members typically encodes for three polypeptides, Gn, NSm and Gc, which are cotranslationally cleaved. The central region of the M segment encompasses the predicted NSm sequence. The low homology found in the NZV predicted NSm sequence might indicate the uniqueness of the virus and further supports the concept that this is a new member of the Orthobunyavirus genus.",

In a scenario of novel viral emergence, straightforward diagnosis, such as that described in this study, could be applied and be of utmost importance and value. www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ FCS, MEM-Eagle nonessential amino acids, 2 mM L-glutamine, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, 100 units/ml penicillin, 1.25 units/ml nystatin and 10 mM HEPES buffer was added. Six days post infection, when a massive CPE was evident, the culture medium was collected, and cell debris was removed by centrifugation (1700 RCF, 5 min). The collected medium was used to infect fresh Vero monolayers as described above. Five days post infection, when a CPE was observed, the culture medium was collected and used for analyses. Viral titers were determined as pfu/ml using a plaque assay on Vero monolayers as previously described 38 .",

Ten microliters of the inactivated supernatant was applied on 300-mesh carbon-coated copper TEM grids treated previously with 1% alcian blue. The samples were incubated for 10 min, and excess liquid was blotted using Whatman paper. The grids were washed three times with distilled water and stained with 1% phosphotungstic acid. After air-drying, the samples were visualized using an FEI Tecnai T12 microscope operated at 120 kV and equipped with a Gatan ES500W Erlangshen camera. Scaling was performed using a standard of known size, which was measured at different magnifications.",

As a control, RNA was extracted as mentioned above from noninfected cells. RNA was quantified using a Qubit fluorometer with the Qubit RNA HS Assay Kit (Invitrogen). The concentration of the purified RNA was 6 ng/\u00b5l (and 5 ng/\u00b5l for the control), which is sufficient for library preparation using the SMARTer Pico RNA Kit.

This kit combines three technologies-SMART (switching mechanism at the 5\u2032 end of RNA template) technology, LNA (locked nucleic acid), and a ribosomal cDNA depletion method-and the procedure can be completed in 5 hours. Five nanograms of the extracted RNA was used for fragmentation at 94 \u00b0C for 4 min. First-strand synthesis was performed using SMARTer oligonucleotides, a template-switching oligo mix, partial Illumina adaptor sequences, and SMARTScribe reverse transcriptase at 42 \u00b0C for 90 min and then at 70 \u00b0C for 10 min. The cDNA was then amplified by 5 cycles of PCR with SeqAmp DNA polymerase and adapters for Illumina sequencing (with specific barcodes) and purified by two rounds of clean-up with 1 \u00d7 AMPure XP beads (Agencourt). Ribosomal cDNA was depleted by a ZapR-mediated process, in which the library fragments originating from rRNA (18S and 28S) and mitochondrial rRNA (m12S and m16S) are cleaved by ZapR in the presence of R-Probes (which are mammalian-specific). These R-Probes were hybridized to ribosomal RNA and mitochondrial rRNA sequences for 60 min at 37 \u00b0C and then for 10 min at 72 \u00b0C. The depleted cDNA fragments were further amplified with universal Illumina primers for 16 PCR cycles. Lastly, the PCR products were purified once again by a single round of clean-up with 1 \u00d7 AMPure XP beads to yield the final cDNA library. The library was sequenced in single-read mode (60 nucleotides) on a MiSeq instrument using the V2 Kit.",
