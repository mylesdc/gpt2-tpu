The mAbs were further dissected using recombinant E protein domain I-II (E-DI-II) and III (E-DIII) of DENV-2. Using plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) and mouse protection assay with lethal doses of DENV-2, we identified four serotype-specific mAbs that had high neutralizing activity against DENV-2 infection. Of the four, E-DIII targeting mAb DB32-6 was the strongest neutralizing mAb against diverse DENV-2 strains. Using phage display and virus-like particles (VLPs) we found that residue K310 in the E-DIII A-strand was key to mAb DB32-6 binding E-DIII. We successfully converted DB32-6 to a humanized version that retained potency for the neutralization of DENV-2 and did not enhance the viral infection. The DB32-6 showed therapeutic efficacy against mortality induced by different strains of DENV-2 in two mouse models even in post-exposure trials.",

Studies of the neutralizing epitopes found the strongest mAbs to be DB32-6 and DB25-2, both DENV-2 serotype-specific antibodies. These two mAbs recognized the A-strand of E-DIII at residues K310 and E311, respectively.

Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) of DENV would be powerful research tools for antiviral development, diagnosis and pathological investigations. Here we described generation and characterization of seventeen mAbs with high reactivity for E protein of DENV. Four of these mAbs showed high neutralizing activity against DENV-2 infection in mice. The monoclonal antibody mAb DB32-6 showed the strongest neutralizing activity against diverse DENV-2 and protected DENV-2-infected mice against mortality in therapeutic models. We identified neutralizing epitopes of DENV located at residues K310 and E311 of viral envelope protein domain III (E-DIII) through the combination of biological and molecular strategies. Comparing the strong neutralizing activity of mAbs targeting A-strand with mAbs targeting lateral ridge, we found that epitopes located in A-strand induced stronger neutralizing activity than those located on the lateral ridge. DB32-6 humanized version was successfully developed. Humanized DB32-6 variant retained neutralizing activity and prevented DENV infection. Understanding the epitope-based antibody-mediated neutralization is crucial to controlling dengue infection. Additionally, this study also introduces a novel humanized mAb as a candidate for therapy of dengue patients.",

Both 4G2 and 3H5 were used as positive controls (Figure 1 ). The specificities of the mAbs recognized as the four DENVs were further confirmed by ELISA and Western blotting (Figures 1A-1B and Table 1 ).

Generally, the nonneutralizing antibody normal mouse IgG (NMIgG) treated group showed paralysis, ruffling, and slowing of activity around 6 to 9 days. This was followed by severe sickness leading to anorexia, asthenia and death within 9 to 17 days ( Figures 2B and 2C) . In contrast, mAbs DB32-6 at a concentration of 10 mg/ml protected 93% of the mice from the lethal challenge of DENV-2 ( Figure 2B ). mAbs 3H5, DB23-3, DB2-3 and DB25-2 had survival rates of Humanized mAb against Dengue Virus www.plosntds.org 75%, 76%, 72% and 71%, respectively. DB42-3 and DB13-19 had survival rates of 46% and 28%, respectively ( Figure 2B ). The neutralizing mAbs showed a significant delay of the onset of paralysis and death relative to the NMIgG. To evaluate the therapeutic potential of the highly protective mAb DB32-6, we administered 100 mg/ml or 1 mg/ml to infected suckling mice. The survival rates for DB32-6 at 100 mg/ml or 1 mg/ml were 100% and 89%, respectively ( Figure 2C ). In comparison, 3H5 showed 82% and 40% survival rates at 100 mg/ml or 1 mg/ml, respectively. Stat1 2/2 mice, which lack a transcription factor involved in interferons (IFNs) signaling were sensitive to lethality induced by DENV-2 infection [27, 31] . To test the potential therapeutic effects of the strongest neutralizing mAb DB32-6, we challenged Stat1 2/2 mice at a strict condition with 1610 5 pfu (300-fold LD 50 ) of DENV-2 (NGC-N). After 21 days observation, mice showed ruffled fur, mild paralysis and lost approximate 20% of their initial body weight at day 7 after infection (P,0.01), and then they all died within 7-18 days of infection ( Figures 2D and 2E ).

Even in the postexposure therapeutic experiments, the DB32-6 treated mice had a survival rate of 50% (Figure 2E left) .

Phage-displayed peptide sequences selected by DB32-6 had the consensus motifs of histidine (H)-lysine (K)-glutamic acid (E)-tryptophan (W)/tyrosine (Y)-histidine (H) (Figure 3D left) . Similarly, 17 immunopositive phage clones selected by DB32-6 using phage library displayed 7 amino acid residues, which contained the consensus motif H-K-E-W/Y-H ( Figure 3D left) . Interestingly, all phage-displayed peptides selected by DB32-6 and DB25-2 contained lysine (K) and glutamic acid (E), respectively ( Figure 3D ). To further confirm the neutralizing epitopes, we developed various E protein epitope-specific variants VLPs and screened lossof-binding VLP mutants for identification of critical recognition residues. Using this strategy, we found that DB32-6 lost its VLP binding activity when the residue K310 in the A-strand of E-DIII was changed to alanine (K310A) or glutamine (K310Q) (Figure 4A  left) . Similarly, DB25-2 lost its VLP binding activity when E311 was changed to arginine (E311R) in the A-strand of E-DIII ( Figure 4A right). Both the critical recognition residues K310 and E311 were located in the A-strand of E-DIII (Figures 4B and 4C) . We found that mAb 3H5 recognized residues K305, E383 and P384 ( Figure  S4 ), as previously reported [17, 20] . Notably, even the adjacent residues (K310 and E311) induced antibodies with different levels of neutralizing activity. By comparing the amino acid sequences of E proteins from representing genotypes of DENV-2 (Table S1), we found residues K310 and E311 in E-DIII of the different genotypes (Southeast Asian, West African and American) ( Figure S5 ). Our data further showed epitopes in the A-strand of E-DIII were important for inducing neutralizing antibodies.",

DB32-6 was the most potent mAb against DENV-2 and showed potential as a therapeutic antibody. To develop humanized mAbs, we sequenced V H and V L segment of the neutralizing mAbs from hybridoma cell lines. The CDRs of DB32-6 were grafted onto human IgG1 backbone to create humanized DB32-6 (hDB32-6) ( Figure 5A ). The hDB32-6 was expressed in CHO-K1 cells and purified from culture supernatants. Both hDB32-6 and mDB32-6 were able to against DENV-2 ( Figure 5B ). The hDB32-6 maintained the specificity of murine DB32-6 (mDB32-6). Furthermore, we established stable clones of hDB32-6. After selection, mAbs hDB32-6-30, hDB32-6-48 and hDB32-6-51 were found to have highly binding activity ( Figure 5C ). Comparing to these mAbs, we found hDB32-6-48 to have the highest production rate in cells. mAb hDB32-6-48 was dose-dependent against DENV-2 and E-DIII ( Figure 5D ). The affinity was analyzed by surface plasmon resonance. The mDB32-6 and hDB32-6-48 bound to E-DIII of DENV-2 with a similar affinity (0.12 nM and 0.18 nM, respectively) ( Figure 5E ). The results revealed that hDB32-6 maintained the same binding affinity to the E protein as mDB32-6. mAb hDB32-6 protected mice from DENV-2-induced mortality",

The hDB32-6 variant retained the same neutralizing activity as unmodified mAb mDB32-6 at high concentrations (100 mg/ml and 10 mg/ml) but was completely devoid of enhancing activity at low concentrations (1 mg/ml and 0.1 mg/ml) (Figure 7) . The hDB32-6 variant eliminated the ADE phenomenon and holds great potential for being developed into therapeutic antibodies for the prevention and treatment of DENV-2 infection.",

            "text": "Based on previous epitope mapping results, several epitopes have been shown to elicit strong neutralizing antibodies against individual flaviviruses that situated in E-DIII [14, 50] . Investigation of neutralizing epitopes on the E proteins may provide the framework for a detailed understanding of both specific mechanisms of the viral infection as well as the identification of the specific DENV domain that attaches to a cellular receptor. Phage display is useful in the identification of B-cell epitopes, including linear [32, 51] and conformational epitopes [29, 45] . However, these epitopes need to further elucidation using other methods. Combining different strategies provided a fast and reliable evidence for identifying epitopes (Figures 3 and 4) . To date, few mAbs possess better neutralizing activity than 3H5, which has been shown to bind to residues K305, E383 and P384 at the lateral ridge of E-DIII [17, 20] . DB32-6 had higher neutralizing activity than 3H5. Neutralizing epitope of DB32-6 was mapped on K310 residue in A-strand of E-DIII (Figure 4 ). Neutralizing epitope of another mAb DB25-2 was mapped on E311 residue in A-strand of E-DIII, too ( Figure 4) . These serotype-specific neutralizing epitopes located in the A-strand of E-DIII induced stronger neutralizing activity than those located on the lateral ridge of E-DIII. We aligned different DENV-2 genotypes and found that the K310 and E311 were frequently observed in DENV-2 ( Figure S5 ). The K310 may be important to DENV-2. Thus by binding DB32-6 to K310, it lead to dramatic neutralized DENV-2. To determine whether DB32-6 can neutralize diverse genotypes of DENV-2 is a critical step in evaluating the potential of therapeutic development in the future.",

Our mAb DB32-6 is a serotype-specific neutralizing mAb that recognized residue K310 but not residues K305 or K307. Although K310 is considered as a subcomplex-specific epitope, DB32-6 is a serotypespecific mAb. There may be other regions that affect the binding of DB32-6 to DENV-2. We found that by mutating residue I312, DB32-6's binding activity was reduced by 50% (data not shown). Residue I312 may be a minor epitope of DB32-6. Moreover, 1A1D-2 is a temperature dependent mAb due to its needs for dynamic motion on the virion surface to neutralize virus [16] . Different from 1A1D-2, DB32-6 is temperature independent. When DB32-6 was incubated with DENV at 4uC, it still exhibited significant neutralizing activity (Figures 2 and 6 ). As expected, when incubating the DENV and DB32-6 at 37uC, DB32-6 showed better efficacy than it did at 4uC (data not shown). The residue K310 on the surface of DENV-2 may be accessible to DB32-6 binding. Additionally, DB32-6 had high binding affinity (0.12-0.18 nM) to DENV-2. Based on the above finding, the residue K310 induce serotype-specific mAbs and is crucial in the neutralization of virus infectivity.",

However, there are fewer antibody concentrations capable of recognizing E-DIII than there are that recognize E-DI-II in dengue patients [20, 39] . Wahala et al. studied the human immune sera of DENV infection and found the E-DIII binding antibodies to play a minor role in DENV neutralization, similar to West Nile virus-infected human [52, 53] . The mAbs that bind to E-DIII expresses potent neutralizing activity, but only a few of them exist in serum of the patients infected with DENV or WNV. Combining the information from both mice and human mAbs studies of DENV infection is critical to understanding the complex mechanism behind the humoral immunity following natural DENV infection. According to one previous study, the immunoglobulin populations recognizing residues K310, E311 and P364 in dengue fever patients were much larger in IgM than in IgG [20] . The strong neutralizing IgG made up a small proportion of the antibody in dengue patients. de Alwis et al. has conducted an in-depth analysis of the human mAbs derived from memory B-cells of patients infected with primary DENV infections [54] . After the epitope mapping of anti-DENV-2 human mAbs, the strong neutralizing mAb 10.16 was mapped to K305, K310 and E311 in the A-strand. Together, the finding above suggest that the highly protective epitopes K310 and E311 in mouse play a role in humans as well.",

The high or no neutralizing activity of our mAbs can be used help identify neutralizing or immunopathogenic epitopes in the E protein. Studies that explore the mAbs mediated neutralization mechanism and mAbs dependent enhancement are currently underway.",

Developing of mouse models to studying its pathogenesis is important but challenging. We used two models, suckling mice protection assay and Stat1-deficient (Stat1 2/2 ) mouse model with different DENV-2 strains through intracerebral or intraperitoneal inoculation to evaluate the neutralizing activity of DB32-6 mAb (Figures 2 and 6 ). Our findings suggested that mAb DB32-6 might effectively block virus entry. However, disease manifestation of suckling mice is not relevant to dengue disease in humans since DENV infections in humans rarely involve the nervous system [58] . The Stat1-deficient mice are genetically mutated and not immunocompetent, hence they are not representative of the wild types' immune response to DENV. However, their survival rates might reflect the therapeutic potential of these mAbs. The results from these mouse models showed that the therapeutic potential of this newly generated mAb DB32-6 is worth further investigation.",
