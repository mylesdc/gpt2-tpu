            "text": "The bactericidal activity of conventional titanium dioxide (TiO 2 ) photocatalyst is effective only on irradiation by ultraviolet light, which restricts the applications of TiO 2 for use in living environments. Recently, carbon-containing TiO 2 nanoparticles [TiO 2 (C) NP] were found to be a visible-light-responsive photocatalyst (VLRP), which displayed significantly enhanced antibacterial properties under visible light illumination. However, whether TiO 2 (C) NPs exert antibacterial properties against Bacillus anthracis remains elusive. Here, we evaluated these VLRP NPs in the reduction of anthrax-induced pathogenesis. Bacteria-killing experiments indicated that a significantly higher proportion (40%-60%) of all tested Bacillus species, including B. subtilis, B. cereus, B. thuringiensis, and B. anthracis, were considerably eliminated by TiO 2 (C) NPs. Toxin inactivation analysis further suggested that the TiO 2 (C) NPs efficiently detoxify approximately 90% of tested anthrax lethal toxin, a major virulence factor of anthrax. Notably, macrophage clearance experiments further suggested that, even under suboptimal conditions without considerable bacterial killing, the TiO 2 (C) NP-mediated photocatalysis still exhibited antibacterial properties through the reduction of bacterial resistance against macrophage killing. Our results collectively suggested that TiO 2 (C) NP is a conceptually feasible anti-anthrax material, and the relevant technologies described herein may be useful in the development of new strategies against anthrax.",

Approximately 2000 to 20,000 cases occur worldwide annually [2] , mostly in Africa and central and south Asia [3] . Anthrax spores have been developed as a biological weapon by several countries [4] [5] [6] . The 2001 US anthrax letter attacks further evidenced an emerging terrorist threat, leading to renewed attention to the importance of prophylaxis, prevention, and handling procedures for anthrax [7] . Agents commonly cited to inactivate anthrax spores include formaldehyde, hypochlorite solutions, chlorine dioxide, and radiation [8] . However, most of these agents are harmful to humans, limiting their use in public environments. Therefore, a safer disinfection technique that can exert a sustainable antimicrobial effect in human living environments is highly desirable.",

            "text": "Photocatalytic titanium dioxide (TiO 2 ) substrates have been demonstrated to eliminate organic compounds and to function as disinfectants [9] . On stimulation by ultraviolet (UV) light irradiation, the photon energy excites valance electrons and generates pairs of electrons and holes (electron vacancy in the valence band) that diffuse and become trapped on the TiO 2 surfaces. These excited electrons and holes have strong reducing and oxidizing activities and react with atmospheric water and oxygen to yield reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ), hydroxyl radicals ( \u2022 OH), and superoxide anions (O 2 \u2212 ) [10] , which are extremely reactive on contact with organic compounds, and have been shown to operate in concert to attack polyunsaturated phospholipids and DNA in bacteria [9, 11] . The oxidation of bacterial cell components such as lipids and DNA might therefore result in subsequent bacterial cell death [9] . Consequently, the TiO 2 photocatalytic process is a conceptually feasible disinfectant technology. The TiO 2 photocatalyst, however, is effective only on irradiation with UV light at the necessary levels, which can induce severe damage to human eyes and skin [12] [13] [14] [15] . This greatly restricts the potential applications of the photocatalyst for use in human living environments. To solve this problem, impurity doping of TiO 2 with different elements has been used, including carbon, sulfur, nitrogen, and silver, resulting in excitation wavelength shifts from the UV to visible-light [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . Simultaneously, the proper amount of impurity doping of TiO 2 may also reduce the recombination rates of electron and hole pairs. Previously, we reported visible-light-responsive photocatalyst (VLRP) films, which offered a complementary and possibly alternative approach for meeting this need to control the spread of anthrax [24] . However, these VLRP films must be precoated on the surfaces of particular objects, whereas photocatalytic NPs do not, and as such may have broader applications. To solve this problem, the anti-anthrax properties of VLRP carbon-containing titanium dioxide [TiO 2 (C)] nanoparticles [TiO 2 (C) NPs; C200 NPs] [17] were evaluated in this study. The visible-light-responsive photocatalytic activity of C200 NPs has been respectively validated by degradation of methylene blue in liquid phase, oxidation of NO in gas phase, and sterilization in these works under visible light illumination [17, 19, [26] [27] [28] . The existence of carbonaceous species on TiO 2 surface was analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectra. The effect of carbonaceous species on physical properties was observed on UV-visible absorption spectra, photoluminescence spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy as shown in our previous works [26] [27] [28] . In addition, we have further demonstrated that C200 NPs exert superior Escherichia coli killing properties under visible light illumination when compared to anatase TiO 2 NPs [17, 19] . These results collectively suggested that the C200 NPs exhibit a photocatalytic property under visible light illumination. However, whether C200 NPs can eliminate spore-forming bacteria such as Bacillus species has remained uncertain. Therefore, the visible-light-responsive C200 NP-mediated anti-anthrax property was evaluated. The potential applications are discussed herein.",

In the present study, scanning electron microscopy and UV-Vis absorption analyses of the newly prepared C200 NPs were performed ( Figure 1 ). We found that both TiO 2 and C200 displayed nanoscale structures ( Figure 1A ,B), and that an increased content of carbon ( Figure 1C ) and C200 displayed considerable redshift absorbance compared with TiO 2 NPs ( Figure 1D ), indicating absorbance in the visible light range (wavelength > 380 nm). The UV-Visible diffuse reflectance spectra were converted by instrument software to absorbance values, F(R), based on the Kubelka-Munk theory. In the C200 sample, a sharp edge extending to approximately 438 nm and corresponding to a band gap of approximately 2.83 eV was observed, as indicated in one of our previous reports [27] .

To investigate whether photocatalysis might injure the bacterium and make it more vulnerable to phagocyte-mediated killing, B. subtilis was used as a surrogate for B. anthracis to treat macrophage J774A.1 cells. To avoid a biased condition, we applied a subbacterial killing condition (3 \u00d7 10 4 for 5 min), under which bacterial survival could not be considerably suppressed ( Figure 2B ). The analysis results revealed that B. subtilis in groups without antibacterial photocatalytic properties (i.e., UV100 TiO 2 groups and C200 dark groups; Figure 2 ) tended to have a low reduction rate (killing by macrophages) after being engulfed by the phagocytes (Figure 5 ). By contrast, the levels of surviving bacteria of macrophage-engulfed B. subtilis were markedly suppressed 8 h after ingestion, only in C200 groups with visible-light illumination ( Figure 5 , C200 light group). These results suggested that the C200-mediated photocatalysis also induced damage in bacterial cells that could be repaired after plating ( Figure 2B , 5 min group, not significant reduction), but resulted in a relatively vulnerable phenotype when encountering phagocytes ( Figure 5 , C200 light 8 h group). This suggested that, although the bacteria may not efficiently be killed when a subantibacterial dose of photocatalysis is applied, the bacteria that survive the photocatalysis are still more easily secured and eliminated by phagocytes in the immune system. In other words, the C200-mediated photocatalysis exhibits a protective effect against contaminated bacteria even under subbacterial killing conditions. Nanomaterials 2016, 6, 237 5 of 12",

The UV-responsive TiO 2 photocatalysts are therefore unsuitable for application in indoor environments. By contrast, visible-light-activated TiO 2 photocatalytic NPs exhibit at least four advantages. First, compared with UV-responsive materials, visible-light-activated TiO 2 photocatalysts offer potential for use as a disinfectant in human living environments such as indoor spaces and public areas. Second, because TiO 2 is a chemically stable and inert material, it can continuously exert antimicrobial action when illuminated by light. Third, the bactericidal activity can be switched on and off or modulated by controlling the light intensity. Fourth, the transportability of NPs offers greater adjustability. Because of these advantages, visible-light-activated photocatalytic NPs might be used complementarily with existing disinfection technologies against anthrax.",

            "text": "Emerging nanomaterials and particular NPs have been implicated as having tremendous potential applications in environmental and disinfection use [38] . We previously demonstrated that photocatalytic films can eliminate vegetative bacteria and spores of anthrax [24] . However, compared with nanostructured films, which have to be precoated at the surfaces of particular objects, NPs frequently show superior portability [39] . For example, VLRP NPs can theoretically be easier to spread into a dead corner of spore-contamination-suspected objects, houses, territorial waters, and even aerosol spaces, when compared with VLRP films. Therefore, in the present study, visible-light-responsive C200 NPs were used. For toxicity consideration, previous studies have shown that TiO 2 NPs are generally considered safe for skin contact or even ingestion by healthy animals [40] [41] [42] . However, inhalation of TiO 2 NPs can be toxic to the lungs [42] . As a result, in a real setting, aerosol TiO 2 NPs should be avoided unless the nearby persons are provided with appropriate certified masks (e.g., N95) and/or air cleaning and filtering equipment. A pioneering work demonstrated that supplements with various types of NPs, including TiO 2 NPs, may reduce the growth of Escherichia coli and B. anthracis in bacterial culture [43] ; however, it showed that the growth retardation effect was due to the presence of excessive NPs in the culture medium rather than bacterial killing. In addition, the photocatalytic effect of TiO 2 NPs on B. anthracis has not yet been reported. Therefore, to determine a more efficient way to eliminate the contaminated pathogenic bacteria, relevant verifications that involve using photocatalytic NPs are necessary.",

However, whether C200 NPs can eliminate spore-forming bacteria such as Bacillus species has remained elusive. Therefore, in the present study, we demonstrated that visible-light-responsive C200 NP-mediated photocatalysis can eliminate considerable levels of both vegetative bacteria and spores of Bacillus species, including B. subtilis, B. cereus, B. thuringiensis, and B. anthracis. The analysis data suggested that C200 NPs are useful for eliminating contamination of these spore-forming bacteria. Notably, in agreement with our previous findings [24] , our data suggest that C200-mediated photocatalysis somehow injures the bacteria even under suboptimal antibacterial conditions, thus leading to faster clearance of the photocatalyzed bacteria by phagocytes ( Figure 5 ). This suggests that C200 can still exert anti-anthrax properties even at a subantibacterial level.",

A measured quantity of tetrabutyl orthotitanate (50 mmol) was slowly introduced into 90 mL of anhydrate ethanol and 20 mL of deionized (DI) water in a 250 mL flask. After complete dissolution, 4 mL of nitric acid was added to catalyze the hydrolysis and condensation reactions. The mixed solution was uniformly agitated at 500 rpm for 3 h, producing a precipitate of titanium hydroxide. After drying at 110 \u2022 C, the dried powder was calcined in air at 200 \u2022 C for 5 h and designated as C200 [17, 24, 26, 27] . Details of preparing the production of C200, including structural properties and the sizes of primary particles, were reported in our earlier work [27] . The surface of C200 was found to contain unique anatase/rutile mixed crystalline phases that exhibit strong visible-light absorption and photocatalytic effects [22, 23] . The carbonaceous species on TiO 2 (C) NPs exist in an amorphous form, as observed in Raman spectra [26] [27] [28] . One commercially available TiO 2 NP (UV100, Sachtleben, Germany) that can exert photocatalytic properties only when illuminated by UV light was used for comparison. Because C200 samples often aggregate into larger clusters because of surface charges, in Van der Waals interactions, we dispersed the aggregates by using sonication (Transsonic Digital TP680DH, Elma Schmidbauer, Singen, Germany) before the bacteria-killing or bacteria-photocatalyst interaction experiments. The UV-Vis absorption spectra were recorded on a Hitachi 3300H spectrophotometer (Hitachi Taiwan, Taipei, Taiwan) [24, 44] . Particle size and morphology were determined using a transmission electron microscope (Philips Tecnai F20 G2 FEI-TEM, Philips Taiwan, Taipei, Taiwan) and a scanning electron microscope (JEM-3010, JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) [17, 21] . Material compositions were determined using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (Perkin Elmer SSI-M probe XPS system and S4800, Waltham, MA, USA).",

B. cereus (ATCC 13061) and B. thuringiensis (ATCC 35646) were maintained and cultured in BAPs or BHIB at 30 \u2022 C, and B. subtilis (ATCC 39090) was maintained and cultured in trypticase soy agar or broth (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) at 37 \u2022 C [24, 48] . Bacterial strains were stored in a 50% culture medium and 50% glycerol solution at \u221280 \u2022 C before use. To reactivate bacteria from frozen stock, 25 \u00b5L of bacterial stock solution was transferred to a test tube containing 5 mL of a freshly prepared culture medium and then incubated at 30 \u2022 C or 37 \u2022 C under agitation overnight (16-18 h) . Spores of B. anthracis were prepared as previously described [24, 49, 50] . Overnight BHIB cultures of B. anthracis were diluted to approximately 10 7 colony-forming units (CFU)/mL in phosphate-buffered saline, and 0.1-mL aliquots were inoculated onto blood agar plates. The agar plates were incubated at 25-37 \u2022 C until 90%-99% phase-bright spores were observed using phase-contrast light microscopy. Spores were harvested and washed with cold sterile DI water as previously described [49] and stored in the freezer at \u221220 \u2022 C for up to 1 mol. The quality of spores was determined by two complementary criteria previously established for validating the presence of dormant spores [50] . The criteria consisted of evaluating (i) the absence of vegetative cells (rods) determined through microscopic examination as described, and (ii) the survival of spores in hydrochloric acid (2.5 N) . Spore preparations of B. subtilis, B. cereus, and B. thuringiensis were conducted following the same protocol.",

For each Bacillus species, a factor for converting the OD600 values of the bacterial culture to concentration (CFU/mL) was calculated as follows. A fresh bacterial culture was diluted by factors of 10 \u22121 to 10 \u22127 , and the OD600 of these dilutions was measured. The bacterial concentrations of these dilutions were determined using the standard plating method. To determine the bactericidal effects of the TiO 2 -related substrates, 200 \u00b5L of bacterial overnight culture was transferred into 5 mL of a culture medium and incubated at 37 \u2022 C until an OD600 of 0.3-0.6 (log phase) was reached. The bacterial concentrations were calculated using the previously determined conversion factor for the bacteria, and the cultures were diluted to 1 \u00d7 10 5 CFU/mL with the culture medium. The bacterial cultures (2.5 \u00d7 10 4 CFU) were mixed with the TiO 2 or C200 NPs (200 \u00b5g/mL in 150 \u00b5L of normal saline) using a 200 \u00b5L pipetman and placed onto a 24-well cell culture dish. Photocatalytic reactions were carried out using an incandescent lamp (Classictone incandescent lamp, 60 W, Philips Taiwan, Taipei, Taiwan). A light meter (model LX-102, Lutron Electronic Enterprises, Taipei, Taiwan) was used to record the illumination density. In the dose-dependent experiments, illumination was carried out for 5 min at distances of 5, 10 and 15 cm from the lamp, corresponding to illumination densities of 3 \u00d7 10 4 , 1.2 \u00d7 10 3 and 3 \u00d7 10 2 lux (lumen/m 2 ) (equivalent to 90, 30 and 10 mW/cm 2 ), respectively. In the kinetic analysis experiments, illumination was carried out for 1, 5, 10, 20 and 30 min at a distance of 5 cm, corresponding to an illumination density of 3 \u00d7 10 4 lux (90 mW/cm 2 ). Unless specified, illumination was carried out in a 4 \u2022 C cold room to prevent overheating of the photocatalyst-containing solution. After illumination, the levels of surviving bacteria were determined using a standard plating method immediately after bacterial collection. In the spore experiments, 1 \u00d7 10 4 CFU (1 \u00d7 10 5 CFU/mL in 100 \u00b5L) was used, and the procedures followed the same protocols as those in the live bacteria experiments.",

Anthrax LT is composed of two protein components, a PA (cell receptor-binding) and an LF (metalloprotease). The PA and LF were purified from B. anthracis (ATCC 14186) culture supernatants, as previously described [24, [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] 45, 47] . The culture supernatants were filter-sterilized by being passed through a 0.22-mm filter (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA) and concentrated using the Minitan Ultrafiltration System (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA). Protease inhibitor phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride 0.1 mM (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) [51, 52] was added to prevent toxin degradation. Ammonium sulfate was added to 75% to precipitate the protein; and the protein was collected and suspended in 20 mM tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane HCl (Tris-HCl) pH 8.0, and extensively dialyzed against the same buffer. The purification was further performed using fast protein liquid chromatography Mono Q anion exchange (Pharmacia, Piscataway, NJ, USA) with a 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 buffer and linear 0-400 mM NaCl gradient elution over 40 min. The PA was eluted at 130-140 mM NaCl, and the LF was eluted at 250-270 mM NaCl. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) contamination was monitored using a Limulus Amoebocyte Lysate QCL-1000 kit (Lonza, Walkersville, MD, USA) [31, 35, 53] . Batches of purified LT with an LPS contamination level of less than 1 EU/mg of LT were used [31] . The LT solution was mixed with the TiO 2 or C200 nanoparticles (200 \u00b5g/mL in 150 \u00b5L of normal saline) by using a 200 \u00b5L pipetman and placed onto a 24-well cell culture dish. After inactivation in visible-light illumination for 30 min (3 \u00d7 10 4 lux; 90 mW/cm 2 ), the LT (LF:PA = 1:5) was ready for use. Cytotoxic doses of LT (10 mg/L) [30] , with or without pretreatment of photocatalytic inactivation using pure TiO 2 and C200 NPs, was used to treat mouse macrophage J774A.1 cells. Three hours after the LT treatments, the cell viability of J774A.1 cells was measured using a WST-1 kit (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) [30, 53, 54] , following manufacturer instructions.",

In particular, C200-mediated photocatalysis exhibits a protective effect against the bacteria, even under suboptimal conditions. Our results collectively suggest that C200 NPs and the extended concepts and technologies described in this report are useful for the development of new strategies against anthrax.",
