            "text": "Bleomycin is a powerful chemotherapeutic drug used to treat a variety of cancers. However, individual patients vary in their responses to bleomycin. The identification of genetic differences that underlie this response variation could improve treatment outcomes by tailoring bleomycin dosages to each patient. We used the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans to identify genetic determinants of bleomycin-response differences by performing linkage mapping on recombinants derived from a cross between the laboratory strain (N2) and a wild strain (CB4856). This approach identified a small genomic region on chromosome V that underlies bleomycin-response variation. Using near-isogenic lines, and strains with CRISPR-Cas9 mediated deletions and allele replacements, we discovered that a novel nematode-specific gene (scb-1) is required for bleomycin resistance. Although the mechanism by which this gene causes variation in bleomycin responses is unknown, we suggest that a rare variant present in the CB4856 strain might cause differences in the potential stress-response function of scb-1 between the N2 and CB4856 strains, thereby leading to differences in bleomycin resistance.

One of these drugs is bleomycin, an antitumor antibiotic that interacts with oxygen and transition metals to cause double-stranded DNA breaks (Chen and Stubbe 2005) . Although the cytotoxicity of bleomycin can reliably induce cell death in tumor cells, off-target effects can lead to a range of harmful consequences, from mild gastrointestinal irritation to severe bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis (Blum et al. 1973) . The tradeoff between efficacy and toxicity varies across individuals, and understanding the genetic variants that affect bleomycin response might yield opportunities to broaden the therapeutic range (Relling and Dervieux 2001; de Haas et al. 2008) .",

Many studies have attempted to identify the genetic variant(s) that underlie bleomycin-response differences across cancer patients, and some have identified potential connections between the metabolic enzyme bleomycin hydrolase (BLMH) and patient outcomes. However, none of these studies established a causal connection between genetic differences in BLMH and variation in bleomycin responses (Lazo and Humphreys 1983; Nuver et al. 2005; de Haas et al. 2008; Gu et al. 2011; Alt\u00e9s et al. 2013) . The inability to identify a human genetic variant that causes differences in bleomycin responses might be attributed to limited sample sizes (Sham and Purcell 2014) , confounding environmental factors (Hunter 2005; Liu et al. King 2010; Dagogo-Jack and Shaw 2018) . However, the DNA-damage pathways that might be implicated in bleomycin responses are evolutionarily conserved across eukaryotes (Taylor and Lehmann 1998) . Therefore, studying bleomycin responses in a model organism with natural genetic variation can offer insights into how bleomycin response differs across individuals and can potentially be applied to the clinic .",

We used near-isogenic lines (NILs) to validate the largest effect QTL on chromosome V. Our results from the NIL assays suggested that epistatic loci underlie bleomycin responses, but a two-factor genome scan was unable to detect significant genetic interactions. Next, we created and tested CRISPR-Cas9 mediated deletion alleles to investigate all six candidate genes in the QTL region. We identified a nematode-specific gene, H19N07.3, that underlies this QTL. Although this gene does not contain a proteincoding variant between the N2 and CB4856 strains, its gene expression varies across the RIAIL panel. Interestingly, a genome-wide association (GWA) approach identifies different QTL than the linkage mapping approach, suggesting that both common and rare variants underlie bleomycin response variation. Given the genetic complexity underlying the bleomycin response phenotype, this study highlights the power of the C. elegans model system to identify elusive causal genes.",

A large-particle flow cytometer (COPAS BIOSORT; Union Biometrica, Holliston, MA) was used to sort three L4 larvae into each well of a 96-well plate that contained 50 ml K medium plus HB101 lysate at 10 mg/ml, 50 mM kanamycin, and either 1% distilled water (control) or 1% distilled water and bleomycin (drug).

Finally, bleomycin-specific effects were calculated using the regress(assay = FALSE) function from easysorter, which fits a linear model with the phenotype as the dependent variable and control phenotype as the independent variable (phenotype control phenotype).

All samples were diluted to 0.2 ng/ml and incubated with diluted Illumina transposome (catalog no. FC-121-1031). Tagmented samples were amplified with barcoded primers. Unique libraries (192) were pooled by adding 8 ml of each library.

The sample was purified using Qiagen's Gel Extraction Kit (catalog no. 28706), and eluted in 30 ml of buffer EB. The concentration of the purified sample was determined using the Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit (catalog no. Q32851).

The summary of each scantwo output includes the maximum interactive LOD score for each pair of chromosomes. To determine a threshold for significant interactions, we performed 1000 permutations of the scantwo analysis and selected the 95th percentile from these permutations. For the bleomycin-response variation scantwo, the significant interaction threshold was a LOD score of 4.08. The significant interaction threshold for the scb-1 expression variation scantwo was 4.05.

Our initial linkage mappings used the 1454 marker set (Rockman and Kruglyak 2009) and had a QTL confidence interval larger than the interval found using the whole-genome marker set (described above). Because this confidence interval was larger and more conservative, we kept it for subsequent testing of candidate genes. This expanded interval contained an additional 20 kb on either side of the whole-genome marker set confidence interval (File S9). The snpeff function within the cegwas R package was used to identify variants within the region of interest (File S11). We identified variants predicted to have MODERATE (coding variant, inframe insertion/ deletion, missense variant, regulatory region ablation, or splice region variant) or HIGH (chromosome number variant, exon loss, frameshift variant, rare amino acid variant, splice donor/acceptor variant, start loss, stop loss/gain, or transcript ablation) phenotypic effects according to Sequence Ontology (Eilbeck et al. 2005) and selected variants at which the CB4856 strain contains the alternate allele. This search found five candidate genes in the interval: C45B11.8, C45B11.6, jmjd-5, srg-42, and cnc-10, which each contain one nonsynonymous variant between the N2 and CB4856 strains.",

For each desired deletion, we designed a 59 and a 39 guide RNA with the highest possible on-target and off-target scores, calculated using the Doench algorithm (Doench et al. 2016) . The N2 and CB4856 L4 hermaphrodite larvae were picked to 6 cm agar plates seeded with OP50 Escherichia coli 24 hr before injection. The CRISPR injection mix was assembled by first incubating 0.88 ml of 200 mM AltR CRISPR-Cas9 tracrRNA (IDT, catalog no. 1072532), 0.82 ml of each of the 59 and 39 AltR CRISPR-Cas9 crRNAs at a stock concentration of 100 mM in Duplex Buffer (IDT), and 0.12 ml of 100 mM dpy-10 co-injection crRNA at 95\u00b0for 5 min. Then, 2.52 ml of 69 mM AltR S. pyogenes Cas9 Nuclease (catalog no. 1081058; IDT) was added to the tracrRNA/crRNA complex mixture and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. Finally, 0.5 ml of 10 mM dpy-10 repair construct and distilled water were added to a final volume of 10 ml. The injection mixture was loaded into the injection capillary using a mouth pipet to avoid bubbles in the injection solution. Young adult animals were mounted onto agar injection pads, injected in either the anterior or posterior arm of the gonad, and allowed to recover on 6 cm plates in bulk. At 12 hr after injection, survivors were transferred to individual 6 cm plates. Broods with successful edits were easily observed because of the dpy-10 co-injection marker, which created animals with an obvious locomotive defect, roller (Rol), or morphological phenotype, dumpy (Dpy). At 3-4 days after injections, plates were checked for the presence of Rol or Dpy F1 progeny. These Rol F1 progeny were transferred to individual 6 cm plates, allowed to lay offspring, and genotyped for the desired edit 24 hr later. Genotyping was performed with PCR amplicons designed around the desired site of the deletion. Plates with heterozygous or homozygous deletions were propagated and genotyped for at least two more generations to ensure homozygosity, and to cross out the Rol mutation. Deletion amplicons were Sanger sequenced to identify the exact location of the deletion. Reagents used to generate deletion alleles are detailed in Supplemental Information.",

Two repair constructs were designed, one for the N2 to CB4856 replacement and vice versa. Repair oligonucleotides were homologous to the background strain except for the nucleotide variant, a silent mutation in the PAM site (A339A) to eliminate repair construct cleavage and a silent mutation that introduces a BsaAI restriction enzyme cut site (T336T). Repair constructs contained a 35-bp homology arm on the PAM-proximal side of the edit, and a 91-bp homology arm on the PAM-distal side of the edit. Injection mixes were made as above, with 0.6 ml of 100 mM jmjd-5 repair construct added with the dpy-10 repair construct in the last step of the protocol.

For each heterozygous/ hemizygous genotype, 30 hermaphrodites and 60 males were placed onto each of four 6-cm plates and allowed to mate for 48 hr. The same process was completed for homozygous strains to remove biases introduced by the presence of male progeny in the assay. Mated hermaphrodites were transferred to a clean 6-cm plate and allowed to lay embryos for 8 hr. After the egg laying period, adults were manually removed from egg lay plates, and embryos were washed into 15 ml conical tubes using M9 and a combination of Pasteur pipette rinsing and scraping with plastic inoculation loops.

File S8 is a summary of the scantwo analysis for bleomycin responses in the RIAILs and reports the maximum interaction LOD score for each chromosome pair. File S9 contains information on all genes in the QTL confidence interval plus 20 kb on either side. File S10 contains locations of the exons, introns, and transcription start and stop sites for all genes in the region. File S11 reports predicted nonsynonymous variants between the N2 and CB4856 strains in the region. File S12 is derived from the Rockman et al. (2010) RIAIL microarray expression data, and reports the expression measurements for each of the 13,107 microarray probes across 209 RIAILs. File S13 contains all significant QTL identified by linkage mapping of File S12 data. File S14 contains the annotated linkage mapping of the H19N07.3 expression data. File S15 reports the H19N07.3 expression and residual median optical density for strains of the RIAIL panel that were assayed for both of those traits. File S16 contains H19N07.3 RNA-seq expression data for populations of young adults of N2 and CB4856. File S17 is a summary of the scantwo analysis for H19N07.3 expression in the RIAILs, and reports the maximum interaction LOD score for each chromosome pair. File S18 contains control-regressed phenotypic data for all wild isolates assayed in response to bleomycin. File S19 contains GWA mapping for the phenotypes in File S18. File S20 contains genotype information for each strain measured in File S18 across all variants within the linkage mapping confidence interval around the QTL for which CB4856 contains the alternate allele. File S21 is a FASTA file containing the protein sequences for all H19N07.3 homologs.

Therefore, exposure to bleomycin can affect the development of C. elegans larvae as well as germ-cell production of adult animals. We used a HTA to measure the effects of bleomycin on development and brood size ( Figure S1 , Materials and Methods). To determine the concentration of bleomycin that would maximize among-strain, while minimizing withinstrain, phenotypic variation, we used the HTA to perform a dose-response assay. We assessed bleomycin responses for four divergent strains (N2, CB4856, JU258, and DL238) across each of 26 HTA traits ( Figure S2 and File S1). For each concentration of bleomycin, we calculated the broad-sense heritability of the traits (Materials and Methods), and found that heritability was maximized at 50 mM bleomycin (mean H 2 across all traits = 0.58, File S2). Given these results, we exposed animals to 50 mM bleomycin for all future HTA experiments.",

RIAILs were previously constructed between these two strains (Rockman and Kruglyak 2009; Andersen et al. 2015) , and these RIAILs have been leveraged to identify genetic variants that cause phenotypic differences between the N2 and CB4856 strains (Kammenga et al. 2007; Palopoli et al. 2008; Seidel et al. 2008 Seidel et al. , 2011 McGrath et al. 2009; Reddy et al. 2009; Bendesky et al. 2011 Bendesky et al. , 2012 Andersen et al. 2014; Schmid et al. 2015; Lee et al. 2017; . We used these RIAILs to identify genetic variants that contribute to differential bleomycin responses between the N2 and CB4856 strains. Using our HTA, we measured each of the 26 fitness parameters for 249 RIAILs (Materials and Methods, File S3). Correlations between each pairwise combination of the 26 HTA measurements revealed several clusters of highly correlated traits ( Figure S3) . Therefore, the summary statistics measured by the BIOSORT should not be considered independent traits for linkage mapping. We selected median optical density (median.EXT) for future analyses, which is related to both animal length and optical extinction, because this trait was highly correlated with many of the 26 HTA traits and was highly heritable (H 2 = 0.73, File S2).",

We used the HTA to test these strains in response to bleomycin (File S3). The NIL with the N2 genotype across this QTL introgressed into the CB4856 background (ECA230) was statistically more sensitive to bleomycin than CB4856 ( Figure S6 and File S7, P = 1.3e214, Tukey HSD). This phenotype indicated that the N2 genotype within the introgressed region (which includes the QTL confidence interval) confers sensitivity to bleomycin. However, the reciprocal NIL with the CB4856 locus introgressed into the N2 background (ECA232) had a bleomycin-response phenotype that was not significantly different from the N2 strain ( Figure S6 and File S7, P = 0.053, Tukey HSD), suggesting that interacting loci could underlie bleomycin responses in a background-dependent manner. We performed a two-factor genome scan to map potential epistatic loci but did not identify a significant interaction between the QTL on chromosome V and other loci ( Figure S7 and File S8). However, the failure to detect significant interacting QTL could be because we have too few recombinant strains or because too few replicates of each RIAIL were phenotyped. Alternatively, more than two loci might underlie the transgressive phenotype of ECA230, and a two-factor genome scan might not be able to capture this complexity.",

The genotypes of ECA411 and ECA528 differ in a small region of chromosome V that includes the QTL confidence interval (Figure 2 and Files S5 and S6). Both of these strains were more sensitive to bleomycin than the background parental strain, CB4856. This result could suggest that the introgressed region shared between these strains, which does not include the QTL, conferred some bleomycin-response variation between the N2 and CB4856 strains ( Figure 2) . Alternatively, the hypersensitivity of these NILs could suggest the presence of Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibilities between the N2 and CB4856 genotypes (Snoek et al. 2014 ) that might affect stress responses of the NILs. However, ECA528 was much more sensitive to bleomycin than ECA411 (Figure 2 and File S7). Because ECA528 has the N2 genotype across the QTL region and ECA411 has the CB4856 genotype, these results suggest that the QTL genotype strongly affects bleomycin sensitivity (Figure 2 , ECA528 vs. each other strain P , 1e214, Tukey HSD).

The 147 kb confidence interval on chromosome V contains 93 genes, including pseudogenes, piRNA, miRNA, ncRNA, and protein-coding genes (File S9). Given the narrow confidence interval, we expanded our search to include an additional 20 kb on each side of the 147 kb interval (Materials and Methods).

We used CRISPR-Cas9 mediated genome editing to generate two independent deletion alleles of each gene in each genetic background to reduce the possibility that off-target mutations could cause phenotypic differences (Materials and Methods, Supplemental Information). We tested the bleomycin response of each deletion allele in comparison to the N2 and CB4856 parental strains ( Figure 3B and File S3). The deletion alleles of C45B11.8, C45B11.6, srg-42, and cnc-10 each had a bleomycin response similar to the respective parent genetic background, which suggested that the functions of each of these genes did not affect bleomycin responses ( Figure 3B and File S7, P . 0.05, Tukey HSD). By contrast, the jmjd-5 deletion alleles in the N2 and the CB4856 backgrounds were each more resistant to bleomycin than their respective parental strains ( Figure 3B and File S7, ECA1047 vs. CB4856 P = 3.8e210, ECA1048 vs. CB4856 P = 0.026, ECA1051 vs. N2 P = 7.4e24, ECA1052 vs. N2 P = 2.9e26, Tukey HSD).

            "text": "We tested if the nonsynonymous variant in jmjd-5 between the N2 and CB4856 strains caused bleomycin-response differences. At residue 338 of JMJD-5, the N2 strain has a proline, whereas the CB4856 strain has a serine (P338S, Figure  S9A ). We used CRISPR-Cas9 to generate reciprocal allele replacements of the jmjd-5 single-nucleotide polymorphism that encodes the putative amino-acid change in the N2 background jmjd-5(N2 to CB4856) and in the CB4856 background jmjd-5(CB4856 to N2) (Materials and Methods, Supplemental Information). We created two independent allele replacements in each genetic background and measured each strain for bleomycin-response differences as compared to the parental strains ( Figure S9B and File S3). Although the allele-replacement strains with the CB4856 allele in the N2 genetic background jmjd-5(N2 to CB4856) were significantly different from the N2 parental strain, these strains were more sensitive to bleomycin than N2 ( Figure S9B and File S7, ECA576 vs. N2 P = 0.006, ECA577 vs. N2 P = 1.6e26, Tukey HSD). This increased sensitivity was unexpected, because the CB4856 allele at the jmjd-5 locus should confer resistance. However, the NIL with the CB4856 genotype across the QTL was not different from the N2 parental strain with 20 kb on the left and the right is displayed. Each protein-coding gene in the region is indicated by an arrow that points in the direction of transcription. Genes with nonsynonymous variants between the N2 and CB4856 strains are shown as red arrows and are labeled with their gene name. (B) Deletion alleles for each of these genes were tested in response to bleomycin. Bleomycin responses are shown as Tukey box plots, with the strain name on the x-axis, split by gene, and residual median optical density on the y-axis. Each point is a biological replicate. Strains are colored by their background genotype (orange indicates an N2 genetic background, and blue indicates a CB4856 genetic background). For each gene, two independent deletion alleles in each background were created and tested. Red asterisks indicate a significant difference (P , 0.05, Tukey HSD) between a strain with a deletion and the parental strain that has the same genetic background. Depictions of each deletion allele are shown below the phenotype for each candidate gene. White rectangles indicate exons, and diagonal lines indicate introns. The 59 and 39 UTRs are shown by gray rectangles and triangles, respectively. The region of the gene that was deleted by CRISPR-Cas9 directed genome editing is shown as a red bar beneath each gene model. Figure S6 and File S7), suggesting that the QTL might confer increased sensitivity only when the N2 allele is in the CB4856 background. Therefore, it remained unclear whether an allele replacement of jmjd-5 in the N2 parental background could confer resistance. Neither of the two strains with the N2 allele in the CB4856 background, jmjd-5(CB4856 to N2), conferred a significantly more sensitive phenotype than the CB4856 parental strain ( Figure  S9B and File S7). Given that the QTL explained 43.58% of phenotypic variation among the RIAILs, the causal variant should have a clear impact on bleomycin response. Additionally, the NILs with the N2 allele at the QTL introgressed into the CB4856 background displayed a significant increase in bleomycin sensitivity compared to the parental CB4856 strain ( Figure S6 and File S7). Taken together, the phenotypes of the reciprocal allele-replacement strains showed that the amino-acid change in JMJD-5 likely does not underlie bleomycin-response variation between the N2 and CB4856 strains, although deletion of this gene did cause resistance to bleomycin regardless of the genetic background. We performed a reciprocal hemizygosity assay to test if natural variation in jmjd-5 function affected bleomycin responses (Figures S10-S12). The results of this assay supported the previously identified increase in bleomycin resistance of homozygous jmjd-5 deletions in both parental backgrounds ( Figure S11 and File S7, P , 0.05, Tukey HSD), which again might be caused by an increased sensitivity in the control condition ( Figure  S12 ). However, the increases in bleomycin resistance between each jmjd-5 deletion strain and the strain with the same genetic background were similar, and the reciprocal hemizygous strains show equivalent bleomycin responses ( Figure S11 ). Taken together, these results suggest that natural variation in jmjd-5 function does not underlie this QTL.",

Of the 118 genes in the 187 kb surrounding the bleomycin-response QTL, expression for 50 genes were measured in the previous microarray study. We identified a significant eQTL for 8 of these 50 genes, 4 of which mapped to chromosome V (File S13). eQTL for two of those four genes, H19N07.3 and cnc-10, mapped to the center of chromosome V, and overlapped with the bleomycin-response QTL. Because cnc-10 did not underlie bleomycin response variation ( Figure 3B ), we hypothesized that H19N07.3 might underlie the bleomycin-response QTL. The H19N07.3 eQTL explains 45.70% of the variation in H19N07.3 expression among the RIAILs (Figure 4, A and B and File S14). The length of animals and expression of H19N07.3 was correlated in the RIAIL strains ( Figure 4C and File S15, r 2 = 0.61, P , 9.5e213 Spearman's correlation).

RIAILs with the CB4856 allele at the QTL peak marker have increased expression of scb-1 and increased bleomycin resistance compared to RIAILs with the N2 allele ( Figure 1 and Figure 4) . Therefore, scb-1 expression differences might cause the bleomycin-response variation between the parental strains. We performed RNA-seq of the N2 and CB4856 strains to assess scb-1 expression differences between the parental strains, and did not identify a significant increase in expression in the CB4856 strain ( Figure S13 and File S16, P = 0.20, Wald test; P = 0.17, likelihood ratio test). This result could be caused by the low sample size (n = 3) in the RNA-seq experiment, or the RIAIL strains could have a novel variant that arose during strain construction that causes scb-1 expression variation. Alternatively, the expression difference observed in the RIAIL strains could be attributed to epistatic loci. We performed a two-factor genome scan to identify epistatic loci that underlie scb-1 expression variation in the RIAILs and identified two significant interactions: one between loci on chromosomes IV and X, and another between loci on chromosomes II and V ( Figure  S14 and File S17).

Because this gene does not have a predicted nonsynonymous variant between the N2 and CB4856 strains, scb-1 gene expression might underlie bleomycin response differences. Potential candidate variants that could cause this expression difference include one variant 2 kb upstream of the gene, and one variant in the third intron of scb-1. However, gene expression can be regulated by distant loci, so the identification of the specific variant is difficult. To understand whether natural variation of scb-1 underlies bleomycin-response differences in other strains, we compared the bleomycin-response linkage mapping to a GWA mapping. We used the HTA to measure median optical density in bleomycin for 83 divergent wild isolates and performed GWA mapping (Figure 7 and Files S18 and S19). Six QTL were identified from the GWA, but none of these QTL regions overlapped the QTL from linkage mapping (Figure 7 and File S19). Therefore, the CB4856 strain might have a rare variant that underlies its increase in bleomycin resistance compared to the N2 strain.",

We tested all six candidate genes in the QTL region to identify a causal gene that underlies bleomycin-response variation between two divergent strains. Deletions of four of these genes, C45B11.8, C45B11.6, srg-42, and cnc-10, did not impact bleomycin responses. Deletions in one gene, jmjd-5, showed increased bleomycin resistance in both parental backgrounds. However, after further analysis of allelereplacement strains and hemizygosity tests, we concluded that the QTL cannot be explained by differences in jmjd-5. Deletions in a gene with an expression difference, scb-1 (previously named H19N07.3), caused an increase in bleomycin sensitivity in both the N2 and the CB4856 strains. Results from a reciprocal hemizygosity assay indicated that natural variation in scb-1 function caused differences in bleomycin responses between the N2 and CB4856 strains. Because lossof-function alleles in scb-1 caused increased bleomycin sensitivity ( Figure 5 ), and RIAILs with lower scb-1 expression levels show increased bleomycin sensitivity (Figure 4) , natural differences in scb-1 expression might cause the bleomycinresponse variation between the N2 and CB4856 strains.",

A previous study found that RNAi of scb-1 impaired the DAF-16/FOXOinduced lifespan extension of daf-2(e1370ts) mutants, which suggests that scb-1 might play a role in stress response (Riedel et al. 2013) . Because bleomycin causes doublestranded DNA breaks and introduces oxidative stress to cells (Stubbe and Kozarich 1987) , reduction of scb-1 function might inhibit the ability of an animal to respond to bleomycin. This model is in agreement with our observation that scb-1 deletions and RIAILs with lower scb-1 expression are sensitive to bleomycin (Figure 4 and Figure 5 ). We used the amino acid sequence of SCB-1 to query the Phyre2 database, and found weak homology to a viral hydrolase (Kelley et al. 2015; Zhang et al. 2018) . This result could suggest that SCB-1 might function as a hydrolase, which could be the mechanism by which scb-1 regulates cellular stress. This finding Figure 5 Bleomycin responses of H19N07.3 deletion alleles are shown as Tukey box plots, with the strain name on the x-axis, split by genotype, and residual median optical density on the y-axis. Each point is a biological replicate. Strains are colored by their background genotype (orange indicates an N2 genetic background, and blue indicates a CB4856 genetic background). Two independent deletion alleles in each genetic background were created and tested. Red asterisks indicate a significant difference (P , 0.05, Tukey HSD) between a strain with a deletion and the parental strain that has the same genetic background. A depiction of the deletion allele is shown below the box plots. White rectangles indicate exons, and diagonal lines indicate introns. The 59 and 39 UTRs are shown by gray rectangles and triangles, respectively. The region of the gene that was deleted by CRISPR-Cas9 directed genome editing is shown as a red bar beneath the gene model. would be similar to clinical studies that have suggested a role for BLMH in bleomycin-response variation (Lazo and Humphreys 1983; Nuver et al. 2005; de Haas et al. 2008; Gu et al. 2011; Alt\u00e9s et al. 2013) . Because scb-1 is expressed in the nucleus of all somatic cells, this gene might impact the ability of bleomycin to cause DNA damage within the cell nucleus (Turek et al. 2016) . Alternatively, scb-1 could impact bleomycin import, export, or another mechanism. If the mechanism of scb-1 is conserved in humans, this discovery could offer insights into the clinical applications of bleomycin. Our results also suggested the presence of genes that interact with scb-1 to cause bleomycin-response differences. These interacting genes could be conserved in humans and inform the use of bleomycin in the clinic.",

Interestingly, the scb-1 gene lies within a toxin-response QTL hotspot on chromosome V (Evans et al. 2018) . Understanding the mechanism of the role of scb-1 in toxin responses might offer insights into evolutionary processes that shaped the genomic diversity of C. elegans and other nematode species.",

In each of these studies, drug-response QTL overlap between linkage mapping and GWA, and variants in common between both mapping strain sets have been shown to underlie drug-response QTL. In the case of the bleomycin response, the linkage-mapping QTL did not overlap with the QTL identified through GWA. Therefore, the variant that underlies the QTL likely is not present at an allele frequency above 5% in the panel of wild isolates used for the bleomycin GWA. The difference between linkage mapping and GWA results indicates that both rare and common natural variants underlie bleomycin-response variation.",

Although linkage mapping detected a highly significant QTL, the manner in which genetic components affect bleomycin responses is not simple. Certain NILs showed transgressive phenotypes (Figure 2 and Figure  S6 ), which indicates that multiple loci interact to create extreme bleomycin sensitivity in particular strains with mixed genetic backgrounds. Our attempts to identify epistatic loci that underlie bleomycin responses in the RIAILs were unsuccessful, potentially because of the complexity of these epistatic interactions. Despite this complexity, scb-1 deletions showed increased bleomycin sensitivity in both parental backgrounds, and expression variation among the RIAIL panel mapped to the same locus as the bleomycin response QTL. Interestingly, the parental strains do not seem to vary in scb-1 expression, as measured by RNA-seq ( Figure S13 ). We found evidence of epistatic loci that underlie scb-1 expression variation in the RIAILs, which might explain why the parental strains do not differ in scb-1 expression ( Figure S14 ). Additional complexities of this trait include the lack of overlap between GWA and linkage mapping QTL, and the potential effect of jmjd-5 lossof-function on bleomycin responses. Despite the complicated manner in which genetic variants seem to affect bleomycin responses, we leveraged the powerful model of C. elegans to identify a single gene that underlies this complex trait.",
