            "text": "Noroviruses are the principal cause of epidemic gastroenteritis worldwide with GII.4 strains accounting for 80% of infections. The major capsid protein of GII.4 strains is evolving rapidly, resulting in new epidemic strains with altered antigenic potentials. To test if antigenic drift may contribute to GII.4 persistence, human memory B cells were immortalized and the resulting human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) characterized for reactivity to a panel of time-ordered GII.4 virus-like particles (VLPs). Reflecting the complex exposure history of the volunteer, human anti-GII.4 mAbs grouped into three VLP reactivity patterns; ancestral reacted exclusively to the earliest GII.4 VLPs by EIA and blockade. NVB 97 specifically bound and blocked only contemporary GII.4 VLPs, while NBV 111 and 43.9 exclusively reacted with and blocked variants of the GII.4.2006 Minerva strain. Three mAbs had broad GII.4 reactivity. Two, NVB 37.10 and 61.3, also detected other genogroup II VLPs by EIA but did not block any VLP interactions with carbohydrate ligands. NVB 71.4 cross-neutralized the panel of time-ordered GII.4 VLPs, as measured by VLPcarbohydrate blockade assays. Using mutant VLPs designed to alter predicted antigenic epitopes, two evolving, GII.4specific, blockade epitopes were mapped. Amino acids 294-298 and 368-372 were required for binding NVB 114, 111 and 43.9 mAbs. Amino acids 393-395 were essential for binding NVB 97, supporting earlier correlations between antibody blockade escape and carbohydrate binding variation. These data inform VLP vaccine design, provide a strategy for expanding the cross-blockade potential of chimeric VLP vaccines, and identify an antibody with broadly neutralizing therapeutic potential for the treatment of human disease. Moreover, these data support the hypothesis that GII.4 norovirus evolution is heavily influenced by antigenic variation of neutralizing epitopes and consequently, antibody-driven receptor switching; thus, protective herd immunity is a driving force in norovirus molecular evolution.",

Although the severity of disease is usually moderate, lasting 1-3 days, infection can be especially virulent in young children, the elderly, and the immunocompromised, with the latter group experiencing chronic diarrhea and virus shedding for over a year [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . Importantly, it is estimated that 200,000 people die each year from norovirus infections, primarily children in the developing world [9] . An effective vaccine would be particularly advantageous for the very young and aged populations, military personnel, children and healthcare providers, food handlers, cruise ship passengers, and populations of the developing world [10] . Immunotherapeutics are especially needed for treating immunosuppressed populations experiencing long-term infections with chronic diarrhea. The lack of understanding of the extensive antigenic relationships among the large number of norovirus strains and the complex relationship between host protective immunity and virus antigenic heterogeneity are the primary obstacles to norovirus vaccine development.",

Expression of the major capsid protein (ORF2) in Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) virus or baculovirus results in the formation of virus-like particles (VLPs) composed of 90 copies of the major capsid protein dimer [11] . Noroviruses are grouped by the amino acid sequence of the major capsid protein: viruses with less than 14.3% difference are classified as the same strain, 14.3-43.8% difference as the same genotype, and 45-61.4% difference as the same genogroup [12] . Currently, noroviruses are grouped into five genogroups (GI-GV). Genogroups GI and GII are responsible for most human infections and are further subdivided into 8 and 21 different genotypes, respectively [1, 12] .",

During the mid-1990's [24] strain US95/96 was responsible for ,55% of the norovirus outbreaks in the USA and 85% of the outbreaks in the Netherlands [25] . In 2002, the US95/96 strain was replaced by the Farmington Hills strain [26] , which was associated with ,80% of norovirus outbreaks [27] in the USA. In 2004, the Hunter GII.4 variant was detected in Australia, Europe, and Asia [28] [29] [30] .

            "text": "A variety of studies using time ordered human outbreak sera and mouse monoclonal antibodies support the hypothesis that the GII.4 noroviruses are undergoing antigenic variation and that this variation contributes to the emergence of new outbreak strains over time [13, 22, 33, 34] . However, the lack of a cell culture or small animal model for human norovirus cultivation restricts study of neutralization antibodies and epitopes. To circumvent this problem, highly informative in vitro assays have been developed that measure the ability of an antibody to ''block'' binding of a VLP to a carbohydrate ligand [13, 35, 36] . This assay is highly sensitive, as it differentiates between norovirus strains too similar to be distinguished by enzyme immunoassay (EIA). The clinical relevance of the blockade assay, as a surrogate neutralization assay, has been confirmed in both infected chimpanzees [37] and Norwalk virus-infected humans [10, 38] . For NoV strains that hemagglutinate RBCs, high blockade antibody titers that prevent hemagglutination also correlate with protection from disease in humans [39] . Using human norovirus outbreak sera, VLPimmunized mouse sera, and mouse mAbs [13, 33, 34] , the early GII. 4 strains (1987 and 1997) were antigenically indistinguishable from each other by EIA and surrogate neutralization assays. VLPs of strains circulating post 2002 had significantly less reactivity with sera directed against earlier strains and no reactivity to mouse mAbs directed to GII.4.1987 . Conversely, select mouse mAbs generated against GII.4.2006 reacted with VLPs that circulated only from 2002 or later. No blockade epitopes were found to be in common between GII. 4.1987 and GII.4.2006. Prior to this work, we and others had predicted GII.4 antibody epitopes using bioinformatic techniques. As expected, discreet amino acids are repeatedly identified as potential evolving epitopes. In particular, residues 296-298 and 393-395 are consistently identified as putative epitopes that change between epidemic GII.4 strains. Additional surface residues at 333, 340, 356, 368, 372, 407 and 412-413 were also predicted as potential antibody epitopes [13, 18, 19, 22, 28, [40] [41] [42] . These amino acids tend to cluster on loops and ridges of the P2 subdomain where antibody interaction would be most accessible. Beyond bioinformatics predictions, only a few studies have shown empirical evidence mapping GII.4 antigenic change. Allen et al. [42] compared the reactivity of five monoclonal antibodies against a pre and post-2002 epidemic GII.4 strain, and identified conformational epitopes composed of residues 294-296 and 393-395. The carbohydrate blockade potential of these antibodies was not reported, so the role of these sites in escape from herd immunity was unclear. However, the finding that residues 393-395 were antigenically important supported our previously published work identifying amino acid 395 as an antigenic determinant in the GII.4.2002 Farmington Hills strain [13] . Using mouse mAbs and molecular biology approaches to exchange predicted epitopes between GII.4 strain backbones, we have clearly identified amino acids 294, 296-298, 368 and 372 to comprise an evolving blockade epitope, as exchange of these amino acids from GII.4.1987 into GII.4.2006 conferred binding of mAbs that recognize GII.4.1987 but not GII.2006 [43] . Extending this approach, we have also confirmed amino acids 407, 412 and 413 to constitute a GII.4.2002 Farmington Hills-specific blockade epitope [17] . These empirical studies support the validity of using computational analysis to guide norovirus epitope studies.",

            "text": "Noroviruses are the principal cause of epidemic gastroenteritis worldwide with GII.4 strains accounting for 80% of infections. The major capsid protein of GII.4 strains is evolving rapidly, resulting in new epidemic strains with altered antigenic sites. To define these sites we prepared the first human monoclonal antibodies (Hu mAbs) against GII.4 noroviruses by immortalizing memory B cells and characterizing antibody reactivity and carbohydrate blockade responses across a ,20 year panel of time-ordered GII.4 virus-like particles (VLPs). Reflecting the complex exposure history of the patient, human anti-GII.4 mAbs grouped into three VLP reactivity patterns: broad (1987-2009), contemporary (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) (2009) , and ancestral (1987) (1988) (1989) (1990) (1991) (1992) (1993) (1994) (1995) (1996) (1997) (1998) (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) . We also identified the location of several defined epitopes which evolve over time and drive antigenic change. Our data indicate that antibodies targeting these sites block carbohydrate binding and likely select for the emergence of new strains that escape herd immunity and recognize unique carbohydrates for entry, resulting in new outbreaks of disease in vulnerable human populations. Importantly, these studies critically inform the rational design of broadly active vaccines and immunotherapeutics for the treatment of norovirus disease.",

We identified one novel, broadly cross reactive antibody that differentially blocks GII.4.1987 through 2009 VLP interactions with carbohydrate ligands, a potential immunotherapeutic for the treatment of acute or chronic GII.4 disease. We also defined unique antibody interactions with two different surface exposed epitopes that evolve over time. Importantly, antigenic variation in one of these epitopes correlated with changing carbohydrate ligand binding patterns over time, supporting the proposed relationship between epitope escape from human herd immunity and changing HBGA usage for virus docking [13] . In addition to defining the first human monoclonal antibodies with therapeutic potential for treating acute and chronic NoV GII.4 infections, these data support the hypothesis that GII.4 norovirus evolution results in antigenic drift of neutralizing epitopes and consequently, antibody-driven HBGA receptor switching; thus, protective herd immunity is a driving force in norovirus evolution.",

However, understanding of the human anti-GII.4 norovirus antibody response is essential not only for understanding the complex relationships between host immunity and virus antigenic change, but also for rational vaccine design based on defined neutralizing epitopes. Therefore, we developed a panel of human anti-GII.4 norovirus monoclonal antibodies to begin to characterize GII.4 antibody reactivity in the native virus host under natural infection conditions, noting that the norovirus preexposure histories in human volunteers are unknown and can only be inferred by human sera cross-reactive antibody binding and blockade patterns using time-ordered VLPs representing different outbreak and pandemic strains (Table 1) [13, 33] . Plasma and PBMC samples from 63 healthy individuals were collected in early 2009 and plasma binding titers (ED50) were measured by EIA against a panel of 6 different norovirus VLPs representing GI and GII strains ( Figure 1 ). The majority of tested samples reacted by EIA with variable ED50 titers to the panel of VLPs tested ( Figure S1 ). One sample (Donor NVB) was shown to react strongly with GII VLPs and was therefore chosen for further character- Figure 3 , and Figure S2 ). Significantly more antibody was needed to block GII.4.1997-PGM binding (EC50 0.4152 mg/ml) than GII.4.1987-PGM binding (EC50 0.3414 mg/ml) ( Figure 3B ) (p,0.05), supporting the hypothesis that subtle antigenic differences exist between these strains.

By single-dilution EIA, NVB 111 specifically reacted to 2006 but minimally with the 2009 variant of Minerva and other tested VLPs (Table 2 and Figure S2 ). Accordingly, NVB 111 required 13-fold more antibody to block GII.4.2009-PGM interaction (EC50 9.953 mg/ml) than it required to block GII.4.2006-PGM interaction (EC50 0.7376 mg/ml) ( Figure 5A and B) (p,0.05).

            "text": "Our previous work with mouse-derived anti-norovirus mAbs suggested that blockade epitopes are conformation dependent [17, 34] . To test the effect of protein conformation of human mAb binding, we used both Western blot and EIA analysis to compare antibody binding to GII.4.2006 VLPs and P proteins. P proteins of GII.4.2006 are composed of the C-terminal portion of the major capsid protein (amino acids 221-531) [21] . Expression of the P protein in E. coli results in small particle formation estimated to consist of 12 P dimers that reportedly maintains VLP characteristics in carbohydrate and antibody binding studies [46, 47] . None of the human anti-GII.4 mAbs recognized either the denatured VLP or P protein by Western blot analysis, suggesting that the epitopes for these antibodies are conformation dependent (data not shown). Surprisingly, only half of the mAbs that recognized GII.4.2006 VLP ( Figure 8A ) by EIA also recognized GII.4.2006 P protein by EIA ( Figure 8B ). NVB 71.4 and 61.3 extended their broad reactivity to P proteins, whereas NVB 37.10 did not, indicating that a minimum of three GII.4 cross-reactive epitopes must exist. NVB 97 also detected P protein by EIA. Neither of the Minerva variant mAbs recognized P protein even at protein concentrations 8-fold above standard EIA conditions (1 mg/ml coating protein). Further, all seven mAbs detected increasing concentrations of VLP in a linear dose response with signals saturating at 4 mg/ml of VLP when the mAb concentration was held at 1 mg/ml, which is our standard EIA antibody titer ( Figure 8A ). Antibody reactivity to the P protein saturated at a lower protein concentration than VLP and at optical densities below the linear range of the assay (compare Figure 8A and 8B), suggesting that even among the mAbs that bind to P proteins conformation-based epitopes may be limited in a way not observed with VLPs. These data suggest two important points. First, some of the mAb epitopes are highly sensitive to conformation, and secondly, that the principle P protein conformation is not identical to VLPs at least for some critical blockade epitopes.",

            "text": "Epitope A encodes significant amino acid changes over time and has also been demonstrated to be an evolving GII.4 blockade epitope using mouse mAbs ( Figure 9A, 9B and [43] ). Epitope A is conformational and is located on the top of the capsid proximal to the HBGA binding pocket. Six variable sites were close to each other in the region of this putative epitope, suggesting that these residues may work in concert to change the local structure of Epitope A. The variable, surface-exposed residues include positions 294, 296-298, 368 and 372. Of note, Epitope A is continuing to evolve in extant strains, whereby the amino acid at position 294 seems to vary extensively in strains from 2008-2010 (amino acid replacements P294A, P294S and P294T have been observed at this position). Epitope B was predicted based upon two variable residues at positions 333 and 382. While these residues are buried in the dimer interface between two chains, the patterns of variation at these sites suggest that they play an important role in the evolution of novel strains, perhaps by evolving replacements that allow the more surface exposed residues in other surface exposed epitopes to dramatically change the physiochemical properties of the amino acid replacements. Residues 340 and 376 make up the variable residues of putative Epitope C. This putative conformation dependent epitope is on the surface and lateral edge of the capsid and is directly proximal to the HBGA binding pocket, suggesting that this epitope may play a role in receptor switching along with Epitope D. Epitope D is comprised Table S2 . doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1002705.g007 of three variable residues from positions 393-395. In the first reported crystal structure for the GII.4 noroviruses, this region was reported to be a secondary HBGA binding site [16] . However, the location of this epitope on the surface of the capsid, directly proximal to the HBGA binding site, suggests that it likely plays a role in both receptor switching and in escape from herd immunity and perhaps both, simultaneously [13, 21, 40, 43] . Epitope D is close enough to the HBGA binding pocket to contribute to or inhibit carbohydrate binding, and yet variable enough to suggest that it is targeted by the immune response. Putative Epitope E is comprised of variable residues 407, 412 and 413, which are surface exposed regions lateral to the HBGA binding pockets and the other epitopes. These residues vary with every major epidemic strain after 2002, suggesting that it is a hot spot for the emergence of immunologically novel GII.4 strains. Epitope E is a GII.4.2002 blockade antibody epitope [17] . This putative epitope is lateral to the HBGA binding pockets indicating that antibodies are targeting interior regions below the capsid surface, which suggests that other epitopes may be present in the P1 subdomain. A few variable residues do not necessarily identify the boundaries of a putative epitope. Moreover, it is nearly impossible to predict the surface area of a putative epitope by sequence analysis alone. Therefore, we expanded the putative epitopes to include residues within 8 \u00c5 of the variable sites from which the epitopes were predicted ( Figure 9B ).",

Exchange of all of the epitopes, except Epitope D into either backbone and GII.4.1987 C into GII.4.2006 resulted in significantly different EC50 values compared to the parental strains ( Figure 11B , 11D, and Table S4 ) (p,0.05).

Exchange of Epitope A between the two parental backbones resulted in a chimeric VLP (GII.4.1987/2006A) that was blocked with significantly less plasma than the parental GII.4.1987 (EC50 0.0167 mg/ml compared to 0.0673 mg/ml) (p,0.05) and a chimeric VLP (GII.4.2006/1987A) that was blocked with signif- Figure S2 and Table 2 ).

In this individual, these data suggest that Epitope A may be an important evolving GII.4 neutralization epitope as the blockade response is significant enough to be detected in the polyclonal antibody response.",

In contrast, each of the strain-specific mAbs displayed differential EIA reactivity to exchanged epitopes Table S4 ). Exchange of the other GII.4.1987 epitopes did not eliminate NVB 114 blockade potential ( Figure 12A and B) Figure 13A and B) . Binding was not restored to wild type levels as the EC50 of GII.4.1987/2006D was 0.6349 mg/ml, significantly higher than the blockade EC50 for GII.4.2006 -PGM (0.1195 mg/ml) ( Figure 13B and Table S4 ) (p,0.05). Both EIA and blockade data clearly indicate that Epitope D is critical for the binding of NVB 97 and suggest that amino acids 393-395 are important components of a GII.4 evolving blockade epitope in addition to modulating VLP-carbohydrate ligand binding [13, 21] . Interestingly, Epitope D has a single amino acid change in GII.4.2004, explaining the highly conserved binding and blockade responses noted across GII.4.2005 to 2009 VLPs, while ancestral strains display significant antigenic variation across these residues. Together, these data map the GII.4 evolving blockade epitopes recognized by each of the four strain-exclusive human mAbs described in this study ( Figure 14 ).",

With the successful vaccination program being developed against rotavirus, focus is shifting to norovirus as the primary causative agent of severe childhood diarrhea resulting in a yearly estimate of 1.1 million episodes of pediatric gastroenteritis in developed nations and 218,000 deaths in developing nations [9] . The elderly and immunocompromised also suffer sometimes life-threatening or chronic long-term norovirus diarrheal disease characterized by malnutrition and dehydration [48] . In some HIV infected patients, chronic norovirus diarrheal disease is associated with persistent norovirus infection [49] . The economic disease burden of a norovirus outbreak within a care facility has been estimated at over $657,000 for a single event [50] . These statistics emphasize the critical need for a norovirus vaccine. Although recent reports strongly support the development and use of an efficacious norovirus vaccine in humans [38, 51] , a primary obstacle to a successful vaccine is the lack of a definitive correlate to protection coupled with the extreme antigenic variation across the many norovirus strains. In fact, the existence of long-term protective immunity to norovirus infection remains controversial within the field [52] . Human challenge studies conducted before molecular diagnostics of infection and refined immune response assays had indicated that some volunteers could be reinfected with the same norovirus strain, suggesting that norovirus infection did not induce long-term protection [53] . However, recent reports identifying immune responses in norovirus-challenged but uninfected volunteers [44, 54] have necessitated qualification of these early observations to acknowledge that the findings may be compromised by assay limitations and/or the overwhelming challenge dose in comparison to the very low norovirus infectious dose [44, 54] . Clearly defining the relationships between pre-exposure history, blockade antibody responses, T cell immunity, virus evolution, and the components of protective immunity represent key challenges for future vaccine and therapeutic design.",

In this manuscript, we isolated and characterized the first human mAbs against noroviruses, derived from a healthy donor whose pre-exposure history was unknown. The number of unique GII.4 human monoclonal antibodies in this patient accurately reflects the high prevalence of GII.4 norovirus infection seen in human populations over the past 25 years. Moreover, distinct antibody cross reactivity patterns support the hypothesis that the GII.4 genotype is undergoing antigenic variation which not only correlates with loss of antibody blockade activity and emergence of new epidemic norovirus strains, but also changing carbohydrate ligand binding patterns over time.",

            "text": "Previously, we have identified two immunological responses associated with protection from infection in norovirus-challenged volunteers. An early (day 1-3) post-exposure salivary IgA response in genetically susceptible volunteers correlated with protection from Norwalk virus infection [54] and an early T h 1 response correlated with protection from Snow Mountain virus infection [44] . Historically, the role of IgG in norovirus protection has been unclear. By adulthood, .90% of the population [48] is positive for anti-norovirus IgG, and norovirus strains within a genogroup share a high degree of antigenic cross-reactivity as measured by EIA [44, 60] . These facts likely skew functional interpretations of the role of serum IgG titers on susceptibility to infection and/or infection outcomes. Although carbohydrate ligand blockade antibody responses have been suggested as correlates of protective immunity [13, 35, 36] , it wasn't until recently that these blockade responses were correlated definitively with protection from clinical disease and infection [10, 38] . Importantly, our surrogate neutralization assay is specific enough to differentiate GII.4 norovirus strains too similar to be distinguished by EIA but different at key antigenic sites. While human re-challenge studies using the same viral inoculum are necessary to confirm an association between a blockade IgG response and protection from repeat norovirus infection, our findings support the clinical relevance of the antibody blockade assay as a correlate of protective immunity [38] .",

While mouse mAbs provide insight into GII.4 antigenic structure, data in this manuscript argues that human mAbs offer considerable advantages, including: a) immunologic record of B-cell immunity following repeat GII.4 infection, b) relationships between antibody blockade responses and antigenic variation, c) relationships between immune selection and carbohydrate ligand reactivity, d) relationships between early infection and downstream immunity, and e) epitope mapping. We focused on anti-GII.4 mAbs because of the clinical relevance of the GII.4 strains. One key finding is a direct relationship between anti-GII. (Figure 3) . Given the lack of cross reactivity with later strains, the most likely explanation is that NVB 114 was derived from a long-term memory plasma cell that had been elicited some 12-22 years earlier. In support of this idea, examination of human monoclonal antibodies against 1918 H1N1 influenza also identified antibody variants that recognized ancestral or contemporary isolates [61] . The exclusive blockade reactivity of NVB 114 with GII.4.1987 and 1997 supports potential long-term protective immunity. Further, NVB 114 is the first antibody identified to clearly demonstrate antigenic difference between GII. 4.1987 and GII.4.1997 , suggesting that antigenic variation may have subtly contributed to the emergence of the GII.4 US 95/96 pandemic strain from ancestral strains.",

Epitopes A and D were both confirmed as evolving GII.4 antibody blockade epitopes using chimeric VLPs containing a mixture of epitopes derived from early or contemporary strains. We recognize that Epitopes A and D have not been structurally defined as epitopes, supporting the need for structural studies to define the exact mAb binding site on the VLPs. Moreover, we focused on discrete regions of varying residues and all of the residues within 8 \u00c5 (representing approximately 201 \u00c5 2 ) to the primary sites that may be influenced directly by an amino acid replacement ( Figure 9B ). However, Ab binding sites have been reported to be much larger (700-800 \u00c5 2 ), suggesting that the epitopes that we have predicted may actually work in concert to form larger Ab recognition sites. By expanding the putative epitopes, we identified other residues that were less variable; however, the exact role that these varying residues play in evolution is less clear. In some cases variation may be required to encode changes that are necessary for the replacement at a primary site. In addition, all of our structural analyses have been conducted using models of the P dimer, representing about 1/90 th of the VLP structural surface. Interactions between the epitopes in the context of the superstructure have not been determined. Therefore, these observations indicate that the complex nature of the NoV Ab epitope requires further research to define the specific boundaries and residues that regulate Ab binding.",

At this time it is unclear how many and which amino acids in Epitope A are needed to mediate an escape mutant phenotype that is completely resistant to GII.4.2006 antibody blockade. However, it is clear that Epitope A varies, and that the site is conserved as a major target for blockade antibody response between 1987 and 2009. Although correlative, comparisons of Epitope A variation along with residues that are proximal to those that appear to be evolving over time suggest that changes at positions 292, 293, 294, 295, 296, 297, 298, 300, 365, 367, 368 and 372 might contribute to an escape phenotype, with residues 294, 296, 297, 298, 300, 368 and 372 playing direct roles in this variation ( Figure 9 ). However, the minor replacements at other positions are likely essential for remodeling the local structural neighborhood such that more profound changes can be tolerated. Supporting the sensitivity of epitopes to the local environment, mAbs that recognized Epitope A differentiated between GII.4.2006 VLPs and GII.4.2006 P dimers. P protein (P dimer) is a dimeric, truncated form of the major capsid protein composed of residues 214-539 [62] . P-dimers have been widely used to determine the crystallographic structure of NoV-HBGA interactions and are considered accurate reflections of the VLP surface topology [16, 21, 63] . P -particles can assemble as higher ordered structures composed of varying copies of the P dimer [46, 64] . These subviral particles are reported to have similar characteristics to VLPs [62, [65] [66] [67] and have been proposed as a candidate vaccine platforms [68] . To our knowledge, this is the first immunologic characterization of P-dimers vs. VLPs using monoclonal antibodies derived from human infections. Here, P-dimers derived from GII.4.2006 lost binding of mAbs NVB 111 and 43.9, the mAbs that recognize Epitope A in GII. 4.2006 . P dimer binding to the Epitope D binding mAb NVB 97 and the broadly cross-blockade mAb NVB 71.4 were retained. Recently, P-particle vaccines were shown to be less robust at inducing strong blockade responses, as compared with intact VLP [69] , perhaps because of the loss of blockade Epitope A in this higher ordered structure. While speculative, it is recognized that virions ''breathe'' suggesting that the possibility that P-dimers and P-particles may become ''locked'' in a slightly less immunologically reactive state that affects some but not all blockade epitopes on the virion surface [70, 71] . These data absolutely underscore the critical importance of determining the structures of several of these human mAbs with their appropriate GII.4 VLP epitopes by either cryoEM or crystallography, for informing targeted mutagenesis to identify the role of key residues in regulating antigenicity and antibody escape.",

            "text": "These data indicate that like influenza, a successful norovirus vaccine regimen will require periodic population sampling to identify future strains for inclusion into the next year's vaccine formulation not unlike the strategy employed by the Influenza Virus Global Surveillance Program. Norovirus population sampling has already begun as monitoring systems for detection of NoV infections have been established in the United States, Europe, and Japan. Identification of GII.4 evolving antigenic epitopes furthers our understanding of norovirus pathogenesis and provides target epitopes that may be useful for surveillance and prediction of new strain emergence. Identification of GII.4 conserved epitopes also informs diagnostic and potential therapeutic reagent development and design. Monoclonal antibodies NVB 37.10, 61.3 and 71.4 all recognize epitopes conserved among the GII.4 strains from 1987 through 2009. NVB 37.10 and 61.3 have enhanced GII VLP recognition, binding not only GII.4 VLPs but also other GII VLPs, but are unable to block VLP-PGM interaction. The high conservation of the NVB 37.10 and 61.3 epitopes suggest that these epitopes are highly resistant to antigenic variation within the GII strains, making these mAbs potentially valuable diagnostic reagents as GII strains cause up to 95% of norovirus outbreaks [27, 72] . The unidentified epitope for NVB 71.4 is clearly different from the epitopes recognized by NVB 37.10 and 61.3 and is conserved throughout the GII.4 strains. NVB 71.4 did not recognize any non-GII.4 VLPs but, importantly, it exhibited blockade activity for the entire panel of timeordered GII.4 VLPs with PGM and Bi-HBGAs. Emphasizing the difference between the two quantitative blockade assays and the qualitative HAI assay, GII.4.2002 HA was not inhibited by NVB 71.4. Noting that blockade assays are not true measurements of neutralization, NVB 71.4 has potential as a therapeutic reagent based on its broad GII.4 blockade potential and the fact that it is by nature a human antibody. Clearly, the effectiveness of NVB 71.4 at preventing or treating illness can only be determined empirically. Although one of the blockade-epitope specific mAbs with lower EC50 values/steeper Hill constants may be more effective at select strain neutralization, the breadth of strains neutralized is likely to be limited for these mAbs. There are a number of viral diseases currently being treated with mAbs including RSV, CMV and enterovirus; however, only the anti-RSV humanized mAb palivizumab has FDA approval for prophylactic use in humans [73, 74] . In outbreak settings or in chronically infected patients, an anti-NoV mAb that could be delivered before symptoms begin and protect from illness could be very useful in care facilities, the military and the cruise industry. Given the acute clinical disease window, it is less likely that therapeutic antibodies will provide relief in those individuals experiencing acute infections, however, therapeutic antibodies may offer opportunities for ameliorating symptomatic disease in chronic infections. The discovery of broadly cross reactive and cross blockade human GII.4 mAbs dictates the need for a new approach to map epitopes. Our current experimental approach was designed to identify GII.4 epitopes that change over time and provide insight into broadly conserved epitope locations. Because the identification of the epitopes recognized by NVB 37.10, 61.3, and 71.4 has important implications for successful vaccine design, new panels of mutated VLPs and other approaches will be needed to characterize these epitopes in the future.",

            "text": "GII.4 NoVs are significant human pathogens that cause considerable morbidity and mortality, worldwide. The development of mouse mAbs to different time-ordered GII.4 VLPs has greatly facilitated progress towards understanding the complex antigenic relationships between these strains by clearly demonstrating antigenic variation over time and epidemic strain [34] . Here we have expanded these observations using human anti-GII.4 mAbs isolated from a healthy adult donor, who has likely experienced multiple norovirus infections throughout his/her lifetime. The identification of highly significant, varying antigenic epitopes that influence VLP-carbohydrate ligand interaction provides important new insights into vaccine design and the development of therapeutics that target norovirus virions. For example, these antibodies represent the first anti-norovirus human mAbs to be characterized, and they confirm findings from studies using mouse mAbs supporting antigenic drift and its linkage with varying carbohydrate ligand binding profiles within the GII.4 noroviruses. Further, we have demonstrated that the GII.4 NoV varying epitopes can be exchanged between time-ordered VLPs, providing a robust platform for expanding the antigenic and blockade cross reactivity of future vaccine candidates. Using this approach, we have identified two surface-exposed antibody blockade epitopes that vary over time and were differentially recognized by four of the seven human mAbs. We also identified three antibodies which recognize either overlapping or three unique highly conserved epitopes within the GII.4 VLP. These data continue to support the hypothesis that norovirus long-term protective immune responses are elicited following acute infection, a concept essential for effective vaccine design. We anticipate that a full understanding of the varying antigenic and blockade epitopes of GII.4 NoVs may not only help to predict the emergence of new epidemic strains but simultaneously identify key reformulations in vaccine design that will protect public health against contemporary and emerging epidemic strains in the future.",

PGM contains relatively high levels of H and A antigen and more moderate levels of Lewis Y antigen [17] . All of the GII.4 VLPs used in the blockade assays in this study bind to both PGM and synthetic Bi-HBGA, and binding to PGM is consistent with synthetic Bi-HBGA binding profiles for a-1,2-fucose (H antigen) and a-1,4-fucose (Lewis antigen) containing molecules [13, 17, 77] . For blockade assays, PGM was solvated in PBS at 5 mg/ml and coated onto EIA plates at 10 mg/ml in PBS for 4 hours and blocked over night at 4uC in 5% dry milk in PBS-0.05% Tween-20. VLPs (0.5 mg/ml) were pretreated with decreasing concentrations of test mAb or donor plasma for 1 hour at room temperature before being added to the carbohydrate ligand-coated plates for 1 hour. Bound VLP was detected by a rabbit anti-GII norovirus polyclonal sera made from hyperimmunization with either GII.4.2009 or a cocktail of GII. 4.1997 , GII.3.1999 , GII.1.1976 , and GII.2.1976 VLPs, followed by anti-rabbit IgG-HRP (GE Healthcare) and color developed with 1-Step Ultra TMB ELISA HRP substrate solution (Thermo-Fisher). The percent control binding was defined as the binding level in the presence of antibody pretreatment compared to the binding level in the absence of antibody pretreatment multiplied by 100. All incubations were done at room temperature. Each step was followed by washing with PBS-0.05% Tween 20 and all reagents were diluted in 5% dry milk in PBS-0.05% Tween-20. All antibodies were tested for blockade potential against the panel of GII.4 VLPs at two-fold serial dilutions ranging from 0.08 to 2 mg/ ml. Additional concentrations of blockade antibodies were tested if needed to complete the sigmoid dose-response curve. Blockade of synthetic Bi-HBGAs (Glycotech, Gaithersburg, MD) assays were done as described for PGM with the following exception. Bi-HBGAs were bound to Neutri-avidin coated plates (Pierce) at 10 mg/ml for one hour prior to the addition of 1 mg/ml VLP for 1.5 h. Reported mean % control binding reflects the results of at least two independent experiments with each dilution tested at least in duplicate. An antibody was designated as a ''blockade'' antibody for a VLP if at least 50% of control binding was inhibited by 2 mg/ ml antibody. Blockade data were fitted and EC50 values calculated using Sigmoidal dose response analysis of non-linear data in GraphPad Prism 5 (www.graphpad.com). EC50 values between VLPs were compared using the One-way ANOVA with Dunnett post test, when at least three values were compared or the unpaired t-test when two values were compared. A difference was considered significant if the P value was ,0.05. To test for antibody binding that prevents detector antibody from binding to the VLP instead of the VLP binding to the PGM, select blockade assays are performed without using a detector antibody and instead developed directly with an anti-human IgG-HRP. Antibodies tested this way give two responses; 1) a bell-shaped response curve for antibodies that are blockade and 2) a sigmoidal shaped curve for antibodies that are not blockade. These data indicate that it is the amount of human mAb that is directly blocking the VLP from binding to PGM. Of note, VLP concentrations in blockade assays are in the low nanomolar range and therefore cannot discriminate between antibodies with sub-nanomolar affinities.",

Accordingly, the NVB 97 blocked VLP-PGM interaction of GII.4.2005, 2006 and 2009 VLPs (Figure 4). A comparable blockade assay for GII.4.2004 is not available, as our strain doesn't bind carbohydrate ligand under our conditions of treatment [13,17,34]. However, under standard conditions, the EC50 for GII.4.2006 (0.1195 mg/ml) was significantly less than the EC50 of GII.4.2005 (0.1559 mg/ml) and GII.4.2009 (0.1810 mg/ml) (Figure 4B) (p,0.05). These data are consistent with the hypothesis that the contemporary 2009 Minerva variant may be diverging antigenically from its 2006 Minerva variant ancestral strain.",

Combined, these three human mAbs (NVB 97, 111, and 43.9) indicate that GII.4.2006 and GII.4.2009 are diverging from each other at the antigenic level, but that significant 2006 blockade epitopes are still preserved, suggesting that additional evolution is needed prior to the emergence of an antigenically distinct, new pandemic strain.Characterization of broadly-reactive human anti-GII.4 mAbs NVB 114, 97, 111, and 43.9 recognize blockade epitopes that are evolving over time (Figures 3-5). Three additional antibodies recognize epitopes that are highly conserved over time. Human mAbs NVB 37.10 and 61.3 exhibited broad GII reactivity, detecting VLPs from GII.1, GII.2, GII.3 and GII.12 genoclusters and the entire panel of time-ordered GII.4 (1987-2009) VLPs",
