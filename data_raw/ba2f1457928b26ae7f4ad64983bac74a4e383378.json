            "text": "The continuous expansion of nosocomial infections around the globe has become a precarious situation. Key challenges include mounting dissemination of multiple resistances to antibiotics, the easy transmission and the growing mortality rates of hospital-acquired bacterial diseases. Thus, new ways to rapidly detect these infections are vital. Consequently, researchers around the globe pursue innovative approaches for point-of-care devices. In many cases the specific interaction of an antigen and a corresponding antibody is pivotal. However, the knowledge about suitable antigens is lacking. The aim of this study was to identify novel antigens as specific diagnostic markers. Additionally, these proteins might be aptly used for the generation of vaccines to improve current treatment options. Hence, a cDNA-based expression library was constructed and screened via microarrays to detect novel antigens of Klebsiella pneumoniae, a prominent agent of nosocomial infections well-known for its extensive antibiotics resistance, especially by extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL). After screening 1536 clones, 14 previously unknown immunogenic proteins were identified. Subsequently, each protein was expressed in full-length and its immunodominant character examined by ELISA and microarray analyses. Consequently, six proteins were selected for epitope mapping and three thereof possessed linear epitopes. After specificity analysis, homology survey and 3d structural modelling, one epitope sequence GAVVALSTTFA of KPN_00363, an ion channel protein, was identified harboring specificity for K. pneumoniae. The remaining epitopes showed ambiguous results regarding the specificity for K. pneumoniae. The approach adopted herein has been successfully utilized to discover novel antigens of Campylobacter jejuni and Salmonella enterica antigens before. Now, we have transferred this knowledge to the key nosocomial agent, K. pneumoniae. By identifying several novel antigens and their linear epitope sites, we have paved the way for crucial future research and applications including the design of point-of-care devices, vaccine development and serological screenings for a highly relevant nosocomial pathogen.",

            "text": "Klebsiella pneumoniae is a gram-negative, facultative anaerobic rod-shaped bacterium belonging to the family of Enterobacteriaceae. It is a non-motile, lactose fermenting organism, which has been known to cause severe lung damage if aspirated. Other clinical symptoms common with Klebsiella pneumoniae infections encompass urinary-tract-infections (UTI) and wound infection potentially causing bacteremia and septicemia [1] . In recent years it has become one of the most persistent nosocomial agents, especially due to the increasing distribution of multiple resistances to antibiotics. The most prominent group of K. pneumoniae harboring a broad resistance spectrum incorporates the Extendedspectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) expressing strains. Due to their outstanding clinical relevance and occurrence as agents of nosocomial infections, it is highly desirable to rapidly detect the presence of these organisms and to find suitable measures to effectively counter any infection in the early stages [2] . While numerous DNA-based typing methods exist [3] , these are often laborious and time-consuming. In contrast, user-friendly point-of-care devices applying antigen-antibody interactions would allow for a quick and reliable detection [4] . Nevertheless, the knowledge about suitable antigens to be incorporated into such a device is scarce. Thus, we have utilized a method to quickly assess novel immunogenic proteins of K. pneumoniae, which might serve as potential targets for a diagnostic tool.",

Therefore, this approach enables a broad and reliable screening, while reducing cross-reactivity and background to a minimum [7] due to the highly selective and covalent binding of HaloTag to its specific ligand [8] . Moreover, the high specificity of said interaction renders excessive protein purification steps normally encountered in microarray-based screening applications [9] obsolete.

As bacterial mRNA rarely contains a Poly(A)-tail [11, 12] , isolation of the mRNA from other RNA species is tedious. While some methods exist to isolate the mRNA prior to reverse transcription [13, 14] , we rather chose to normalize the cDNA afterwards. Consequently, the entire RNA of K. pneumoniae was used for reverse transcription. Next, normalization was performed using a Duplex-specific nuclease [15] . This treatment has been shown to effectively reduce the highly abundant rRNA derived cDNA portions without implementing a bias, thus altering the overall composition of the cDNA in favour of the mRNA derived molecules [16] . In addition to this, ligation-independent cloning and electroporation were employed to enhance cloning efficiency [17] .",

After successful normalization, the cDNA was cloned to create an expression library. Of this library, 1536 different clones were screened using HaloLink slides. The known immunogenic proteins [18] , outer membrane protein 1a OmpF (UniProt/Swiss-Prot: A6T721) and outer membrane protein 3a OmpA (A6T751), were used as positive references, whereas both dihyroorotase PyrC (A6T7D6) and glyceraldehye-3-phosphate-dehydrogenase GapA (A6T8L2) served as negative references. After screening, the signal intensities of each sample were compared to the references and grouped accordingly. Generally, three distinct groups were established. Group I represents samples exceeding the intensities of both positive reference proteins, group II encompasses samples ranging in between the different intensities of OmpA and OmpF, whereas group III entails those samples that albeit showing higher intensities than the negative controls, are below both OmpA and OmpF. Here, approximately 25% of samples belong to group I, while II and III contain 7% and 14% respectively. The remaining samples, 54%, fall into the same range as the negative protein references. Consequently, 192 clones or 12.5% of the entire screening approach were selected for sequencing. These clones were all taken from group I. After sequencing, artificial fragments and known antigens were discarded to reveal potentially novel immunogenic proteins, see Table S1 for a list of the initial identification via sequencing. Some of the inserts were too heavily truncated to reliably identify the corresponding gene. Moreover, in some cases subcloning the initially identified genes in full-length failed even after numerous attempts. Therefore, those genes were removed from further characterization as the translated peptide fragments were too short to be significant. Despite these limitations, 14 potentially novel immunogenic proteins were expressed in full length and used for further characterization.",

In summary, Table 1 reveals the resulting mean Q values and corresponding errors (n = 10). A Q value above one represents higher intensity signals than OmpA, the used positive reference. The highest mean Q value was obtained for KPN_02199, a CoA-linked acetaldehyde dehydrogenase and irondependent alcohol dehydrogenase; pyruvate-formate-lyase deactivase with 2.1660.39. However, as this protein is highly conserved within all bacteria, it was not considered for further analyses regarding specific antigenic sites. The same holds true for KPN_03668, the 50S ribosomal protein L11 methyltransferase. Although a Q value of 1.7060.38 was attained, the highly conserved nature of this protein renders it unsuitable within a diagnostic approach. Contrastingly, KPN_00466 and KPN_01584, two hypothetical proteins, were selected for future investigations as little is known about the function of these proteins. Their mean Q values were 1.1560.22 and 1.9060. 36 respectively. Moreover, KPN_01584 shows some homology to a known superantigen of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis according to the NCBI Protein Cluster database [19] . Thus, the potential utilization of these proteins within a diagnostic tool seems plausible. In addition, KPN_01100, a histidine triad protein, KPN_02202, Glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase, KPN_00 363, a nucleoside channel and receptor of phage T6 and colicin K and KPN_00459, a putative transport protein, were selected for further investigations via epitope mapping. While KPN_01100 and KPN_02202 revealed mean Q values above one with 1.3160.27 and 1.6960.56, respectively, KPN_00459 and KPN_00363 failed to reach this level. Rather, the Q values attained were 0.8360.27 and 0.7760.14. While the Q values of the latter two proteins are lower compared to some of the other proteins identified, their functional descriptions and membraneassociation render them highly attractive within a diagnostic question.

These comprised the peptides 2 and 3, 16-18, 29-30, 45-47, 50-51, 60-63 and 69-71. The highest mean value for these peptides was obtained for peptide 16 with more than 10000 A.U. The positive reference, i.e. Rabbit IgG, reached a mean value of more than 30000 A.U., whereas the negative control MBP showed intensities of less than 500 A.U. As the adjacent peptides are identical in all but 4 amino acids in sequence, a consensus can easily be derived from two or more neighboring peptides. As Figure 2 reveals, only the first two peptides, LLAAGAVVALSTTFA and GAVVALSTTFAAGAA showed some specificity during specificity control assays. Here, the arrays were incubated with additional antibodies reactive to different bacterial species, namely Campylobacter jejuni, Staphylococcus aureus, E. coli and S. enterica. All remaining peptides display similar intensities when these antibodies were used as compared to the original K. pneumoniae antibodies. However, for the first two peptides a significant difference is observed. The mean value for peptide 2 was approximately 6500 A.U. with K. pneumoniae antibodies and dropped to less than 400 A.U. with the other antibodies. A similar trend is discernible for peptide 3, where a drop from 1100 A.U. to less than zero is visible. Thus, the consensus sequence GAVVALSTTFA is likely a suitable linear epitope featuring specificity for K. pneumoniae.",

However, the derived model only spans residues 31 to 294 and as such does not contain the derived consensus sequence of the linear epitope GAV-VALSTTFA. Nevertheless, the model displays a beta barrel structure typical of outer membrane-spanning transport proteins, see Figure 7 for details. The first residues of the derived model, starting at position 31, are marked in orange and present a coiled region outside of the beta barrel. Therefore, the likelihood of the GAVVALSTTFA region to reside within the barrel is slim. Rather, an extension of the truncated coil seems plausible. Consequently, the potential accessibility of the identified linear epitope appears high. Furthermore, the predicted 3d structure of the first part of KPN_00459 is displayed in Figure 8 .

Still, it facilitates to rank the proteins and increases the likelihood of a given protein to be immunogenic if its Q value is significantly high. However, proteins with outstanding Q values were not chosen for epitope mapping by default. Rather, the known homology and corresponding distribution of each protein was carefully evaluated.

Notably, three proteins, KPN_00363, KPN_00459 and KPN_00466, harbored sites with potential linear epitopes. Further careful examination, however, excluded KPN_00466 from future applications as the identified epitope sequence were nonspecific for K. pneumoniae, which might be due to the conserved character of the protein within the family Enterobacteriaceae.

            "text": "In contrast, the other two proteins displaying linear epitopes, KPN_00363 and KPN_00459, indicated some specificity with the antibodies tested and two linear consensus sequences could be derived, GAVVALSTTFA and GIAFGAVELFD, respectively. While the former sequence is present in KPN_00363, an ion channel protein Tsx, which is conserved among Enterobacteriaceae, the latter sequence is part of KPN_00459, a hypothetical protein with high similarity to a cation:proton antiport protein and conserved among Proteobacteria. Consequently, the homology of GIAFGAVELFD (KPN_00459) is high throughout different bacterial species, which renders the sequence inapt for specific K. pneumoniae detection and other applications. In contrast, GAVVALSTTFA (KPN_00363) displays alterations within this sequence for bacterial species other than K. pneumoniae. As small as these alterations appear, they appear to have a crucial effect on the binding of antibodies to the target sequence and thus benefit specificity. This is well in line with the experimental results that indicate no binding by antibodies reactive to other bacteria to this sequence or any of its alterations. Moreover, alanine scanning revealed a number of residues to be paramount for antibody binding. Consequently, replacing the glycine (position 1), alanine (position 2), alanine (position 5) or either threonine (positions 7 and 8) leads to a significant loss of antibody binding observable by a dramatic reduction in signal intensity. On the contrary, removing either the first valine or leucine and inserting an alanine residue as a replacement results in a significant increase in signal intensity, potentially hinting at an improved antibody binding. The reason for these effects remains nebulous; however, it is not caused by a simple change in secondary structure. This is apparent as both AAVVALSTTFA and GAVVAASTTFA, two sequences at opposite sides regarding signal intensity, are predicted to consist solely of an alpha-helix as compared to the original sequence, which is predicted to contain a beta-strand (position 1 to 7) and a helical part (position 8 to 11) by EMBOSS garnier. Furthermore, as the original sequence is fully constructed of uncharged amino acids, alterations via alanine or glycine do not change the overall charge of the peptide. Consequently, the differences in signal intensity cannot be deduced to implementation or removal of charged residues. Finally, changes in hydrophobicity albeit present are minimal at best and may not suffice to explain the observed characteristics. Still, one has to bear in mind that the accuracy of prediction based tools is often lacking, especially for EMBOSS garnier with an accuracy in the range of 65%. Consequently, some of the predicted secondary structures might differ. Despite some uncertainty as to the mechanistic cause of the altered peptides to behave as they did, one fact remains obvious. None of the peptides showed any significant binding to antibodies not raised against K. pneumoniae. Therefore, after alanine scanning, GAVVALSTTFA remains a suitable candidate for specific K. pneumoniae detection or treatment. Still, accessibility of the epitope is paramount to a quick diagnostic tool. Thus, modelling of the 3d structure of the protein was performed. Unfortunately, the 3d modelling only succeeded for the part of the protein, which does not contain said linear epitope sequence. Nevertheless, the pronounced beta barrel structure of the channel protein is visible and the linear epitope sequence, albeit absent, likely to be an extension of the freely accessible N-terminal region outside the barrel structure. Thus, accessibility of the epitope by an antibody might be pronounced without the need to enter the cell or channel. Membrane proteins harboring a beta barrel like structure have been shown in bacteria to be exclusively found in the outer membrane [23] . Moreover, the mobile coils on the extracellular sides of these membrane proteins are pivotal for their function or interaction with other molecules. This renders the identified sequence an intriguing target for antibody-based detection. Additionally, channel proteins harboring beta barrel like structures have been shown to be immunodominant in other bacterial species such as Salmonella, Haemophilus influenzae, E. coli, Neisseria meningitides, Shigella dysenteriae and Chlamydia trachomatis [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] .",

Subsequently, we achieved to identify two sequences displaying specificity during experimental investigations; however, one of these is doubtful as homology analysis has revealed it to be highly conserved among a broad spectrum of bacterial species. Still, GAVVALSTTFA of KPN_00363 was identified to be specific both experimentally and has shown four residues within the eleven amino acid sequence to occur predominantly in K. pneumoniae only. Thus, the likelihood for this linear epitope to be specific is high. This assumption was confirmed by alanine scanning revealing a number of pivotal residues for antibody binding. Moreover, it was unearthed that neither E. coli nor S. enterica antibodies were able to bind to any of the sequences, original and modified. Subsequent investigations might help to further nurture the insight into the suitability of this peptide for diagnostic and therapeutic applications. Thus, monoclonal antibodies ought to be devised to be used for affinity investigations via BIAcore and to determine kinetics. Furthermore, monoclonal antibodies could be used within a potential diagnostic tool and after validation ought to be tested with whole bacteria. If these antibodies are able to specifically detect intact K. pneumoniae cells, the resulting antibody might well be suited for integration into a point-of-care device. In a different approach, the identified epitope sequence could easily be produced in large quantity. This peptide might serve some role in serological screenings, especially if it proves to be immunodominant. Consequently, antibodies against this epitope might be present in a plethora of patient sera.",

Identical residues are marked by dots, gaps by a horizontal dash and differences by the single letter amino acid code. Seven of nine K. pneumoniae strains show identical epitope sequences, while two strains display changes in two residues. Threonine replaces alanine at position 11, a change observed not only in these two strains but in almost all other bacteria within the list. Additionally, threonine at position 9 is substituted by either serine or phenylalanine. Bacteria other than K. pneumoniae show an additional number of amino acid substitutions, most prominently leucine for valine at position 4 and serine for threonine at position 8. In S.enterica the changes become more pronounced. Glycine at position 1 is replaced by serine, valine at position 3 replaced by alanine and threonine inserted for serine at position 7. In some rare cases, other residues have also been substituted, e.g. valine replaces alanine at position 2 in Shigella dysenteriae. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0110703.g009 Figure 10 .
