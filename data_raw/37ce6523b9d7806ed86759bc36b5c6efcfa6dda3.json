In vitro and in vivo studies of GTV demonstrated that it was able to infect animal and human cell lines and could cause pathological lesions in mice. Glycoproteins (GP, including Gn and Gc) on the surface of Guertu virus (GTV) could bind to receptors on host cells and induce protective immunity in the host, but knowledge is now lacking on the information of B cell epitopes (BCEs) present on GTV-GP protein. The aim of this study was to identify all BCEs on Gn of the GTV DXM strain using rabbit pAbs against GTV-Gn. Seven fine BCEs and two antigenic peptides (APs) from nine reactive 16mer-peptides were identified, which are E Gn six of mapped BCEs were recognized by the IgG-positive sheep serum obtained from sheep GTV-infected naturally. Multiple sequence alignments (MSA) based on each mapped BCE motif identified that the most of identified BCEs and APs are highly conserved among 10 SFTSV strains from different countries and lineages that share relatively close evolutionary relationships with GTV. The fine epitope mapping of the GTV-Gn would provide basic data with which to explore the GTV-Gn antigen structure and pathogenic mechanisms, and it could lay the foundation for the design and development of a GTV multi-epitope peptide vaccine and detection antigen. Fig 1. Schematic of epitope mapping strategy. (a) The black band indicates the full-length sequence of GTV-Gn, and the gray bands indicate three of truncated Gn1, Gn2 and Gn3 segments. Schematic of epitope mapping strategy involves 56 overlapping 16mer-peptides spanning Gn1 (b), Gn2 (c) and Gn3 sequences (d).",

            "text": "Emerging pathogenic tick-borne viruses (TBVs) that can infect animals and humans have attracted much attention because of the increasing incidence of tick-borne viral diseases (TBVDs) and their significant impact on human health [1] [2] [3] . In recent years, two novel tickborne phleboviruses (TBPVs), severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV), PLOS and Heartland virus (HRTV) have been shown to be correlated with severe human disease, having caused fatalities in East Asian countries and in the United States [4] [5] [6] [7] . With the rapid development of metagenomics, more and more novel arboviruses have been identified from various hosts [8] . In 2014, Shen et al. [9] isolated one viral strain that displayed a strong evolutionary relationship with SFTSV from Dermacentor nuttalli ticks in the Xinjiang uygur autonomous region of China. Analysis of the phylogenetic tree constructed for this virus indicates that it belongs to the genus Banyangvirus in the family of Phenuiviridae, and named Guertu virus (GTV) [9, 10] . Wu et al. found the crystal structure of the envelope GP N-terminal (Gn) head domain from SFTSV and RVFV was compact and triangle-like, and the three subdomains comprising the Gn head domain have different arrangements [11] . The Gn protein plays a critical role in virion formation and in adhesion to new target cells [12] , and helps viruses enter their target cells, which is the main target of neutralizing antibodies [13] . Thus, elucidating the B-cell epitopes (BCE) in the conserved domain or in the immunodominant region of GTV-Gn is very important to determine how the virus interacts with its host cells and to develop viral detection methods and vaccines [14] .",

However, a common defect of those methods is no way to identify an epitope minimal motif employing polyclonal antibodies (pAbs), and thus it is impossible to know entire BCEs on a target protein. Recently, the obstacle in epitope mapping has been overcome as the novel biosynthetic peptide (BSP) method with many merits was developed, in which short peptides (minimum 3mer peptide) fused with the truncated GST188 protein can be arbitrarily biosynthesized using the expression plasmid pXXGST-1 [21] , Then the BSP method was further modified, which makes it more convenient to screen r-clones of encoding short peptides by SDS-PAGE analysis, that is, the screening of r-clones no longer requires to use control GST188 protein expressed by pXXGST-2 plasmid, when using newly constructed pXXGST-3 plasmid to express short peptides fused with GST188 carrier [22] . Xu et al. have used their own developed method to identify many fine BCEs on human zona pellucida glycoprotein-3 (hZP3) and human hZP4 using rabbit pAbs [21, 23] , and especially to reveal three fine rabbit IgG-epitomes of human papilloma virus type 58 (HPV58) E6, E7 and L1 proteins for the first time [24] . In our previous studies, a lot of fine BCEs on the Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) nucleoprotein (NP) and Gn were identified also using the method [25, 26] , of which all the identified BCEs were recognized by anti-CCHFV positive sheep serum, confirming that the BSP method is credible and easy to operate for epitope mapping.",

Similarly, of expressed overlapping 8merpeptides from other eight reactive 16mer-peptides, P77-P79 and P81-P83 in P21, P88 and P89 in P25, and P100-P102 in P29 and P30 were founded to be able to react with rabbit pAbs as well (Fig 3) . Obviously, this result indicated that there were four BCEs named E Gn 3 (IPEDVF), E Gn 4 (VFQELK), E Gn 5 (IDGILFN) and E Gn 6 (QTKWIQ), of which two were located in P21 due to existence of a non-reactive P80 between P77-P79 and P81-P83, one in P25 and one shared by P29 and P30, respectively.",

At first, the epitope named E Gn 1 in P1 was identified using seven of 10mer-peptides (P136-P142) followed by five of 12mer-peptides (P143-P147), which was a BCE with 11 aa (PIICEGLTHSN) according to two reactive 12mer-peptides of P143 and P144.

Meanwhile, three peptides of E Gn 3, AP-8 and AP-9 were not recognized by sheep positive serum (Fig 6A) . In short, these results indicate that there is better similarity of the immune response to GTV-Gn between rabbit and sheep, and four BCE peptides of E Gn 1, E Gn 2, E Gn 6 and E Gn 7 can be used as candidate BCEs to develop the diagnostic antigen with single and/or multi-epitope peptide for sheep with GTV-infection.",

The 8 BCE motifs have amino acid mutations, which are Fine epitope mapping of Gn in GTV specifically shown in Fig 7. Moreover, the analysis results showed that the BCE E Gn 5 and AP-8 were completely conserved within 10/9 SFTSV strains, indicating that they may be used as candidates for 'universal' GST and SFTSV multi-epitope vaccine design. The E Gn 2 and E Gn 6 BCEs were found to be highly conserved among homologous proteins (Fig 7) , but the peptide (RTKWIC) similar to E Gn 6 was not recognized by rabbit pAbs in Western blotting (S1 Fig), indicating that the E Gn 6 is completely specific to the 10 SFTSV strains. For E Gn 2, whether there is antibody cross-reactivity within homologous proteins remain to be determined using its similar peptide with one residue mutation. Interestingly, the E Gn 1 and E Gn 7 BCEs were specific for GST because of three residues mutation happened at the site corresponding to each BCE motif in homologous proteins of 10 SFTSV strains (Fig 7) , indicating that they together with E Gn 6 all can be used as diagnostic reagents to test GTV-infection.",

In the study on Hantaan virus, most of the neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were found to specifically target Gn and Gc proteins [35] . Compared to the glycosylation sites ( 12 NKSA 15 and 42 NHSQ 45 ) of the Gn from SFTSV HB29 strain, analysis of glycosylation sites (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetNGlyc) of GTV-Gn in this study showed two N-glycosylation sites ( 12 NKSA 15 and 42 NHTQ 45 ). Cysteines responsible for disulfide bonds formation and multimerization, and two hydrophobic loops important for fusion are fully conserved among GP proteins of the GTV, SFTSV, and HRTV [9] . The key residue responsible for hydrogen bonds and salt bridges with an antibody is conserved in GTV-and SFTSV-Gn proteins, suggesting that GTV-Gn is likely to be recognized by the antibody derived from SFTSV [9] . However, there are still no reports on the antigenic region of the GTV-Gn. To investigate antigenic sites on GTV-Gn, epitope mapping of the Gn was performed by using rabbit pAbs and the improve BSP method [22] , by which seven fine BCEs and two APs were identified. Interestingly, the E Gn 1 motif is found to be closely linked to the first glycosylation site ( 12 NKSA 15 ) of GST-Gn (Fig 7) , suggesting that the antibody induced by E Gn 1 might prevent glycosylation of this site through the inhibition of spatial conformation, and the biological/immunological significance of the mapped BCE remains to be studied in the future.",

Thus, the antiserum of sheep GTV-infection was utilized to compare the Gn antigenicity between rabbit and sheep in this work. As shown in Fig 6, 6 of mapped 9 BCEs could reacted with sheep antiserum to GTV, and three (E Gn 3, AP-8 and AP-9) did not show immunogenic in sheep, which the results clearly reflected the better similarity and some differences of the immune response to GTV-Gn in rabbit and sheep. It is a common phenomenon for many species studied; for instance, the sheep serum to peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV) could recognize 9 of 13 BCEs on hemagglutinin (H) protein of PPRV [36] , and the murine pAbs to HPV58 L1-VLP could react with 13 of 18 BCEs mapped by rabbit pAbs to r-HPV58-L1 [24] . Notably, the completely similar antibody-responses to a given antigen also existed between various species sometimes; for instance, all rabbit IgG-BCEs on NPs of CCHFV/PPRV could react with the antisera from sheep CCHFV or PPRV-infected [25, 37] , and the antibodies to three of \u03b2-hCG BCEs present in a chimeric peptide immunogen all were generated in both rabbit and mice [38] . These results indicate that the immune systems of rabbit, murine and sheep could recognize most and/or all of antigenic sites present in a given antigen despite differing greatly in biology and genetics for them, and thus can explain why there are too many reports on identifying BCEs on various viral proteins with rabbit and mouse antisera. To our knowledge, there are few reports about the immunogenic comparison of viral proteins between human and rabbit or murine as mentioned above, although many researches were carried employing the sera from patients or convalescents with various virus infection for epitope mapping [39] [40] [41] . In this work, we also tried to investigate whether a conserved E Gn 5 could be recognized by the serum of a patient with infected-SFTSV (because of no sera from patient infected-GTV), but failed to achieve the desired result. Because it is an interesting scientific question and the need of future application to know similarity of mapped BCEs within rabbit and human, the study will be continued if we could collect the human antisera to GTV later on.",

            "text": "In the present paper, the results of multiple sequence alignment between the GTV strain and 10 SFTSV strains indicated that nine of BCEs and APs shared 66.67%-100% sequence identity with the homologous proteins from SFTSV (Fig 7) , Considering that the hydrophilic region and antigenic region are more susceptible to exposed to the immune system, it could display higher reactivity when contacted with pAbs. Thus, we analyzed the hydrophilicity and antigenic region of those linear BCEs. Our results clearly indicated that all mapped BCEs are located in the hydrophilic domains and six of the nine identified BCEs from this study are consistent with the result predicted for the antigenic BCEs ( Fig 8A) . When these BCEs are located in the constructed 3D model, it is obvious that they occupy a relatively large and accessible surface area (Fig 8B and 8C) , which is consistent with the expected. This suggests that the epitope prediction tool combined with the biosynthetic peptide method is reliable, which could reduce the work load and cost of epitope mapping in immune diagnosis and fine BCE motif recognition [26] . However, whether the identified BCEs could improve the sensitivity of virus detection and be efficacious in a vaccine remains to be further investigation.",

The BSP method used in this study shows many advantages of easy operation, simple, cheap, reliable, and adaptable, of which another outstanding advantage is to help in discriminating reactive bands in Western blotting, as those expressed peptides were located in a weak antigenic area of cell total proteins, and thus avoid the false positive bands associated with two bacterial strong antigenic proteins with 23 kDa and 31 kDa [22] . The BSP method can be used under standard laboratory conditions, making it a useful for fine BCE motifs mapping with pAbs [37, 43] . For example, Yu et al. [37] identified 19 linear BCEs on H protein encoded by PPRV and Liu et al. [43] mapped 5 BCEs on NP2 from CCHFV that all were recognized by CCHFV-positive sheep serum, respectively. In addition, the longest linear BCE (E Gn 1) with 11 residues was identified in Western blotting with the BSP method. The a well helix-angle-helix structure.

It is suggested that the antigenic similarity and differences between both rabbit and sheep species.",

Subdomain III is recognized by specific neutralizing antibodies, and subdomain II is mainly recognized by broad-spectrum neutralizing antibodies [11] . Although SFTSV has a close evolutionary relationship with GTV, current investigations on the GTV-Gn protein structure are still not complete. We speculated that the corresponding domain of GTV-Gn protein has similar characteristics to that of SFTSV. MSA indicated that seven BCEs and two APs were presumed to be located in the subdomain II and III of the GTV-Gn, could be recognized by broad-spectrum neutralizing antibodies.
