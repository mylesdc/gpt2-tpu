Annually, seasonal influenza epidemics attack human populations leading to 290-650 thousand deaths/year worldwide. Recently, a novel Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus emerged. Together, those two viruses present a significant public health burden in areas where they circulate. Herein, we generated a bacterial outer membrane vesicles (OMVs)-based vaccine presenting the antigenic stable chimeric fusion protein of the H1-type haemagglutinin (HA) of the pandemic influenza A virus (H1N1) strain from 2009 (H1N1pdm09) and the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (OMVs-H1/RBD). Our results showed that the chimeric antigen could induce specific neutralizing antibodies against both strains leading to protection of immunized mice against H1N1pdm09 and efficient neutralization of MERS-CoV. This study demonstrate that OMVs-based vaccines presenting viral antigens provide a safe and reliable approach to protect against two different viral infections.",

Beside these epidemics, the world is confronted every 10-40 years with antigenically distinct pandemic influenza virus strains of wide geographical distribution and considerable human-to-human transmissibility resulting in high mortality rates [5] . In recent years, the world has been challenged with newly emerging influenza A virus (IAV) infections, which have the potential to cause sporadic fatalities in the human population within limited epidemics. For instance, highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIV) of the H5N1-subtype and low pathogenic avian influenza viruses (LPAIV) of the H7N9-, H10N8-and H6N1-subtypes [6] [7] [8] [9] have caused sporadic human infections. In addition, other IAVs caused global pandemic outbreaks, such as the 2009 swine-origin H1N1 influenza virus (H1N1pdm09) [10, 11] .",

The composition of the OMVs can be adapted and used as a vaccine platform via incorporation of heterologous antigens into the vesicles [20] . This engineering approach is advantageous because (i) it retains the antigens in their native conformation, (ii) it enables the OMVs to target specific immune responses, and (iii) it provides multiple and commensurate protein antigens in a single production process [17] . However, bacteria-based vaccines are not well explored to deliver viral antigens. Therefore, we engineered a stable OMVs-based dual vaccine against H1N1pdm09 and MERS-CoV by producing OMVs with a chimeric hemagglutinin (HA) comprising of both HA1 and HA2 from the H1N1pdm09 and the receptor binding domain (RBD) of MERS-CoV. MERS-CoV strain was isolated and grown in Vero-E6 cells. The two viruses were used for preparation of the OMVs-based dual vaccine and inactivated vaccines were used as positive control.",

Briefly, for the PCR amplification of each fragment, 25 \u00b5L of 2\u00d7 Phusion Master Mix, 2.5 \u00b5L of forward and reverse primers (10 \u00b5M/\u00b5L), and 50 ng of the according template DNA were mixed and the reaction was then brought to a total volume of 50 \u00b5L using RNase-/DNase-free ddH 2 O. The plasmid pMP-HA-Gi [21] encoding the HA of Cal-H1N1pdm2009 was used as template DNA for F1 and F3, while the plasmid pcDNA3.1-Spike-MERS-CoV encoding the spike protein from the isolate MERS-CoV/Camel/Egypt/HKU-NRCE-270/2013 was used as a template for F2.

The three amplified PCR fragments were then loaded onto a 1% agarose-gel for electrophoresis. Separation and purification of the three specific fragments was done by using QIAquick gel purification kit according to manufacturer's (Qiagen, Germany) instructions. After purification the three fragments were digested by corresponding restriction enzymes, shown in Table 1 . Ligation of the three fragments and the linearized vector was performed using T4 DNA ligase (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) by adding 5 \u00b5L of each purified fragment (20 ng/\u00b5L) to 2 \u00b5L 10\u00d7 buffer, 2 \u00b5L T4 DNA ligase, and 1 \u00b5L linearized vector (20 ng/\u00b5L).

Briefly, sera were inactivated by heating at 56 \u2022 C in a water bath for 30 min. Sera were diluted two-fold serial dilution from 1:20 to 1:160 dilution in 40 \u00b5L of DMEM/2% FBS. An equal amount of plaque forming unit in 40 \u00b5L DMEM/2% FBS was added over sera dilutions. The serum/virus dilutions were then incubated at 37 \u2022 C for 1 h in a humidified incubator with 5% CO 2 . Afterwards, 50 \u00b5L of each dilution were inoculated into individual wells of 12-well tissue culture plates with confluent Vero-E6 cell monolayers and incubated at 37 \u2022 C for 1 h. The plates were periodically undulated every 20 min to avoid cell drying. After 1 h of virus adsorption, inoculum was removed gently from the infected monolayer cells, washed with 1\u00d7 PBS and covered with an overlay containing 1\u00d7 MEM media, 1% agar, 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin (Pen/Strep). The plates were left to solidify and incubated at 37 \u2022 C with 5% CO 2 upside down until the formation of viral plaques were visible (3 days). The cell monolayers were then fixed with 3.4% formaldehyde solution for 1 h at RT, stained with 1% crystal violet solution (in 20% methanol) for 30 min at RT, and washed with water to visualize the plaques. The percent (%) of inhibition is calculated as following:",

However, it was reported that the specificity of the vaccine produced in cell-culture and embryonated eggs is occasionally impaired by amino acid (aa) changes, due to seed strain adaptation, with a drastic impact on vaccine effectiveness [14] [15] [16] . The vaccine platform presented in this study depends on plasmid-based bacterial expression of recombinant viral antigen(s). These plasmids, encoding viral antigen(s), can be easily and quickly modified to insert non-synonymous changes in the encoding region of the antigen(s). Additionally, the bacterial expression has lower mutation rates than eukaryotes [34] . This platform can be also a base for incorporating combinations of different viral antigens to address additional vaccines needed to combat seasonal H1N1, H3N2 and influenza B viruses.",

The vaccine platform presented in this study depends on plasmid-based bacterial expression of recombinant viral antigen(s). These plasmids, encoding viral antigen(s), can be easily and quickly modified to insert non-synonymous changes in the encoding region of the antigen(s). Additionally, the bacterial expression has lower mutation rates than eukaryotes [34] . This platform can be also a base for incorporating combinations of different viral antigens to address additional vaccines needed to combat seasonal H1N1, H3N2 and influenza B viruses.",

LPS in the outer surface of OMVs acts as a self-adjuvant that induces humoral and cellular immunity. Therefore, OMVs vaccines may be used without extra adjuvant to increase the immunogenicity and produce antiviral innate immune responses against various influenza virus infections via activation of macrophages [42] [43] [44] . Despite that the exact role of LPS in the context of OMVs vaccines requires further investigations, high amounts of LPS could be a drawback due to its known endotoxicity and ability to induce excessive secretions of pro-inflammatory cytokines [45] . Therefore, several ongoing investigations aim to produce genetically detoxified and less reactogenic LPS to improve OMV safety [42, 46, 47] . Additionally, modified bacterial strains such as ClearColi\u2122 BL21(DE3), which do not trigger LPS-related immune response, can be applied for OMV production [48] .",

(a) Schematic representation of the outer-membrane vesicles (OMVs)-vaccination platform to combat MERS-CoV and pandemic 2009 H1N1 (H1N1pdm09). The target sequences of MERS-CoV (RBD, 720 bp, 240 aa) and H1N1pdm09 (HA) were amplified, purified, digested and ligated to pMPccdB vector. The ligated plasmids harboring the target sequences were transformed into bacteria and the secreted OMVs containing recombinant antigens were then purified for evaluation in mice.
