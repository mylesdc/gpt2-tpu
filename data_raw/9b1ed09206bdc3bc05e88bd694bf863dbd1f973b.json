Fifteen cynomolgus macaque monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) were infected with Marburg virus (Baltimore Group V, negative-sense single-stranded RNA; 1,000 pfu/inoculation). The macaques were followed over a nine-day period, with three animals sacrificed at each two-day interval.

Supplementary Figure S6 | Consort diagram for the FEVER study See Supplementary Text 1 for further details. Supplementary Figure S7 | Examples of applying the 1,000 tree Random Forest model to the GSE63990 dataset with randomly shuffled group labels We conducted 2,000 iterations of a permutation analysis of dataset GSE63990. Each permutation iteration consisted of randomly shuffling the dataset's group/response labels, before inputting the data into a Random Forest model (see Methods section and Figure 8 in the manuscript). Each panel in Supplementary Figure S7 shows a 2-dimensional projection of a randomly selected permutation of the GFE63990 dataset. As expected, each of the permutations shows no significant group separation. Supplementary Figure S8 | A plot of the distribution of null results from a permutation test applied to the GSE63990 dataset Statistical H0 distribution of the logloss function produced via permutation analysis. Following the method described in Li et al. (2010), the group labels in GSE63990 were randomly shuffled in each of 2,000 permutation iterations. Each permutation iteration was then reanalyzed using a Random Forest model, as described in Supplementary Figure S7 and the Methods section of the manuscript.

The gene expression responses reported by Yu et al. were different for each virus, but in both cases included many interferon-induced genes.

Animation S1consists of 181 frames of a GIF (graphics interchange format) file, wherein each frame presents a three-dimensional projection of points from an 8-dimensional space defined by the expression levels of the 8 individual genes comprising the two signatures. The frames have been arranged in a coherent, continuous sequential order. Animation S1 can be run by opening its icon in a web browser such as Google Chrome. When run, Animation S1 provides a 360 degree rotational view of the three-dimensional projection, about one axis. The frames and rotational orientation have been selected to present an obvious visual separation between the three clinical groups (bacterial, viral, and non-infectious illness). Two of the frames from the GIF file are also shown in Figure 8 , Panels A and B, of the manuscript.
