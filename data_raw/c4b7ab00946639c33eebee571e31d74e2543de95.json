            "text": "Autophagy is a basic biological metabolic process involving in intracellular membrane transport pathways that recycle cellular components and eliminate intracellular microorganisms within the lysosome. Autophagy also plays an important part in virus infection and propagation. However, some pathogens, including viruses, have evolved unique trick to escape or exploit autophagy. This study explores the mechanism of autophagy induction by porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV) in Neuro-2a cells, and examines the role of autophagy in PHEV replication. PHEV triggered autophagy in Neuro-2a cells is dependent on the presence of bulk double-or single-membrane vacuoles, the accumulation of GFP-LC3 fluorescent dots, and the LC3 lipidation. In addition, PHEV induced an incomplete autophagic effect because the degradation level of p62 did not change in PHEV-infected cells. Further validation was captured using LysoTracker and lysosome-associated membrane protein by indirect immunofluorescence labeling in PHEV-infected cells. We also investigated the change in viral replication by pharmacological experiments with the autophagy inducer rapamycin or the autophagy inhibitor 3-MA, and the lysosomal inhibitor chloroquine (CQ). Suppression of autophagy by 3-MA increased viral replication, compared with the mock treatment, while promoting of autophagy by rapamycin reduced PHEV replication. CQ treatment enhanced the LC3 lipidation in PHEV-infected Neuro-2a cells but lowered PHEV replication. These results show that PHEV infection induces atypical autophagy and causes the appearance of autophagosomes but blocks the fusion with lysosomes, which is necessary for the replication of PHEV in nerve cells.",

It mainly gives rise to encephalomyelitis or vomiting and wasting disease in piglets. As a neurotropic virus, it spreads via the peripheral to the central nervous system (CNS), resulting in neurological damage by virus infection (Andries and Pensaert, 1980) . Nervous lesions caused by pathogens often lead to abnormal nerve cell morphology, unnatural protein accumulation, vesicular transport or neuronal gene transcription disorders, and synaptic transmission obstacles (Xilouri and Stefanis, 2010) . Similarly, as a virus invading the nervous system, rabies virus (RABV) can cause severe encephalitis and induce analogous cytopathic features (Peng et al., 2016) . Although, some studies of PHEV pathogenesis have been performed, the underlying mechanism of PHEV replication is still poorly elucidated. Therefore, a more detailed description of the mechanism should be revealed, especially the biological changes of the host cells induced by infection.",

            "text": "Previous studies have indicated that autophagy not only protects cells under stressful conditions, but also plays an important part in the process of pathogen infection (Shintani and Klionsky, 2004) . Some viruses have also developed strategies to reverse the autophagy defense pathway. US11, a late gene of herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1), blocks the formation and development of autophagosomes in both fibroblasts and HeLa cells. US11 also interacts with PKR to suppress autophagy (Lussignol et al., 2013) . Nevertheless, there are viruses that utilize autophagosomes for promoting their replication, such as in poliovirus infection, where the formation of autophagosomes provides a conservative platform for viral replication (Suhy et al., 2000) . Conversely, in the Sindbis virus and tobacco mosaic virus infections, autophagy successfully suppresses viral replication (Liu et al., 2005) . More interestingly, several coronaviruses can hijack the important autophagy-related protein LC3-I and endoplasmic reticulum vesicle structures for their replication (Reggiori et al., 2010) using the same mechanism as rotavirus (Crawford et al., 2012) . This mechanism induced by viral proteins is associated with their own pathogenic non-structural proteins, exemplified by the infectious bursal disease virus infection (Hu et al., 2015) . However, whether PHEV, as a member of the coronavirus family, infection is associated with autophagy is unknown. In this study, we confirmed that PHEV infection induces atypical autophagy and leads to the accumulation of autophagosomes while blocking their fusion with lysosomes, which creates conditions for the virus to replicate within nerve cells.",

These results suggest that cells infected with PHEV suppress autophagic flux, leading to no decrease of p62 but an accumulation when treated with CQ before PHEV infection. These results also revealed that PHEV induced incomplete autophagy. These data implied that PHEV infection may interfere with the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes or impair autolysosomal degradation. FIGURE 2 | PHEV-induced autophagy was time-dependent.

The GFP fluorescence from the ptfLC3 fusion protein is quenched in acidic autolysosomal conditions; however, the red fluorescence signal produced by ptfLC3 is not sensitive to acidic conditions. We found the GFP puncta were increased by PHEV during infection, as shown in Figure 5A . When both RFP and GFP signals were colocalized, resulting in yellow puncta, the RFP puncta remained increased at 12 and 24 h. However, with rapamycin treated cells, ptfLC3-transfected cells experienced complete autophagic flux and showed main red fluorescence with only a fuzzy green fluorescence. Subsequently, we examined whether the fusion of the autolysosome with lysosomes was intact during PHEV infection. A marker for acidic late endosomal and lysosomal structures, LysoTracker Red was used in the corresponding treated cells ( Figure 5B) . In mock-infected cells, a certain number of GFP-LC3 vacuoles merged with LysoTracker staining. It indicated that a portion of autophagosomes had fused with lysosomes and became acidified.

Therefore, the development of autophagy often contributs to the proliferation of the virus (Levine and Kroemer, 2008) . Several studies have determined the mechanism of virus-induced autophagy, such as influenza A virus. The virus inhibits the autophagic degradation process, and its matrix protein 2 plays a key role in this process (Gannag\u00e9 et al., 2009) . Rotavirus also blocks the maturation of autophagosomes and inhibits autophagy maturation, both of which may offer the rotavirus as a way for escaping the antiviral function of autophagy (Crawford et al., 2012) . Recently, it has been reported that coronavirus membrane-associated papainlike protease PLP2 (PLP2-TM) could promote autophagy. In addition, the interaction between PLP2-TM with Beclin 1 affected the replication of the coronavirus, and further regulated the innate immune defense mechanism against viruses. (Chen et al., 2014) . The similar phenomenon is shown in our results which demonstrated that PHEV could activate the appearance of autophagosome but influence its fusion with lysosomes.",

Some recent studies have demonstrated that the induction of autophagy not only increases autophagosome formation and expression of autophagy proteins but also increases autophagic flux, which can be measured by detecting the levels of p62 (Pankiv et al., 2007) . Using several means of measuring autophagic flux, including p62 degradation, LC3-II turnover, and GFP-LC3 lysosomal delivery and proteolysis, we confirmed that autophagic flux remained unchanged upon PHEV infection. The cells were infected with PHEV after CQ treatment, the level of LC3-II was increased, but PHEV infection was suppressed. The effect of CQ treatment may be related to its inhibition of autophagic proteolysis by suppressing acidification of lysosomes and endosomes. Cellular entry of coronaviruses is dependent on clathrin-mediated endocytosis, CQ treatment may block viral genome release from the lysosome into the cytoplasm for replication (Burkard et al., 2014) . This may also be another dominant effect of CQ. These findings illustrate that an incomplete autophagy is activated in Neuro-2a cells by PHEV infected, like we mentioned as \"atypical autophagy\" above, and this autophagy induced by PHEV is involved in viral replication.",

In the present study, we examined the co-localization between autophagy-related proteins and PHEV virion in infected cells, including LC3, an important component in the autophagosomal membrane; LAMP1, a widely used of lysosomal marker protein. We found that PHEV improved the rearrangement of LC3 and LAMP1, suggesting that several autophagy-associated membrane proteins are related to the PHEV replication.",

Our data displayed that after rapamycin treatment, viral replication was inhibited by the rapamycin-treated autophagic effect. The early autophagic inhibitor 3-MA treatment could significantly promote the replication of PHEV, further implied that the formation of early autophagosome contributes to PHEV replication. At the same time, the results from the WST-8 assay we performed above proposed that the pharmacological alteration did not affect cell viability.",

However, the specific mechanism of inhibiting autophagy maturation requires further exploration. On the other hand, such a seemingly contradictory process precisely sets the stage in the formation of early autophagy rather than the autophagolysosome. It may also be an evolutionary mechanism in which the virus escapes the immune system. Our studies provide insights into PHEV-host interactions and may develop a theoretical basis for further study between the virus and autophagy. These insights may raise promising targets for the development of antiviral strategies against PHEV infection.",
