            "text": "Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) is one of the key chemokines that play important roles in diverse inflammatory and chronic pain conditions. Interstitial cystitis/ bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) is a chronic and debilitating inflammatory condition of the urinary bladder characterized by the hallmark symptoms of pelvic pain and voiding dysfunction. To facilitate IC/BPS research, we used transgenic technology to develop a novel urothelial MCP-1 secretion mouse model (URO-MCP-1). A transgene consisting of the uroplakin II gene promoter and the mouse MCP-1 coding sequence with a secretory element was constructed and microinjected. URO-MCP-1 mice were found to express MCP-1 mRNA in the bladder epithelium and MCP-1 protein in the urine, and developed bladder inflammation 24 hours after intravesical administration of a single sub-noxious dose of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The inflamed bladders of URO-MCP-1 mice exhibited elevated mRNAs for interleukin (IL)-1\u00df, IL-6, substance P precursor, and nerve growth factor as well as increased macrophage infiltration. In parallel with these phenotypic changes, URO-MCP-1 mice manifested significant functional changes at days 1 and 3 after cystitis induction. These functional changes included pelvic pain as measured by von Frey filament stimulation and voiding dysfunction (increased urinary frequency, reduced average volume voided per micturition, and reduced maximum volume voided per micturition) as measured by micturition cages. Micturition changes remained evident at day 7 after cystitis induction, although these changes were not statistically significant. Control wild-type C57BL/6 mice manifested no clear changes in histological, biochemical and behavioral features after similar cystitis induction with LPS. Taken together, our results indicate that PLOS ONE | URO-MCP-1 mice are hypersensitive to bladder irritants such as LPS and develop pelvic pain and voiding dysfunction upon cystitis induction, providing a novel model for IC/BPS research.",

MCP-1 is produced by multiple cell types including bladder epithelial cells [1, 2] and plays an important role in recruiting monocytes/macrophages as well as other leukocytes to sites during an inflammatory process. The fundamental importance of MCP-1 and its cognate receptor CCR2 are underscored by studies using genetic knockout mice lacking either of these two proteins. These genetically deficient mice display decreased macrophage recruitment and activation, increased susceptibility to mucosal infection, and reduced T cell responses [3] [4] [5] . Moreover, transgenic models of tissue specific MCP-1 expression have recapitulated many inflammatory disorders such as insulitis, pneumonitis and encephalitis but typically only after an additional inflammatory stimulus is introduced [6] [7] [8] [9] .",

In addition, elevated MCP-1 in the bladder has been observed to associate with bladder inflammation, reduced bladder capacity, and pelvic pain in a cyclophosphamide (CYP)-induced cystitis model [15] . Moreover, one study demonstrated that elevated MCP-1 in the bladder promoted histamine release from mast cells in a protamine sulfate and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced cystitis model [16] . Another study demonstrated that mast cell associated MCP-1 mediated bladder inflammation and chronic pelvic pain in a uroplakin peptide-induced autoimmune cystitis model [17] . All these findings suggest that aberrant overexpression of MCP-1 may contribute to pelvic pain and voiding dysfunction in interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS), a chronic and debilitating inflammatory condition of the urinary bladder characterized by the hallmark symptoms of pelvic pain and voiding dysfunction [18] . Here we report the development of a transgenic mouse model (URO-MCP-1) that secretes MCP-1 by the bladder epithelium and develops bladder inflammation, pelvic pain and voiding dysfunction upon intravesical administration of a single sub-noxious dose of LPS.

Sun at the New York University School of Medicine [19] . The 3.6 Kb fragment containing the UPII gene promoter was excised and placed upstream to the mouse MCP-1 coding sequence (0.52 Kb). An intron sequence was inserted between the UPII gene promoter and the MCP-1 transgene to facilitate discriminating MCP-1 mRNA from its genomic DNA in RT-PCR analysis [20] . The 4.9 Kb Kpnl-DraIII DNA fragment consisting of the above-mentioned sequences and a poly A additional site was microinjected into fertilizing eggs (B6/SJL background; The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Maine). Transgenic founders were backcrossed with C57BL/6 mice (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) for 10 generations to generate C57BL/6 congenic URO-MCP-1 mice. Each generation was confirmed for the presence of the MCP-1 transgene by PCR genotyping using a sequence-specific primer pair (5'-CGAGGTCGACTGCAGAAG-3' and 5'-TGAGGTGGTTGTGGAAAAGG-3'; 690 bp). PCR was performed for 40 cycles at 94\u00b0C for 30 seconds, 55\u00b0C for 30 seconds, and 72\u00b0C for one minute. The PCR products were analyzed by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. RT-PCR was performed on various tissues from an URO-MCP-1 mouse. MCP-1 mRNA product is indicated by a red arrow. GAPDH was used as an internal control. pUPII-MCP-1, a plasmid containing the transgenic MCP-1 DNA sequence (a control for MCP-1 genomic DNA).

Stimulation was confined to the lower abdominal area in the general vicinity of the bladder. A positive response to filament stimulation was considered when mice showed sharp abdominal retraction, instant licking or scratching of the stimulated area, or jumping. Response frequency was calculated as the percentage of positive response to each filament. Tactile sensitivity of the plantar region of the hind paw was assessed using the same calibrated von Frey filaments. The 50% withdrawal threshold was calculated and presented.

            "text": "IC/BPS is one of the most refractory diseases in urology today and the effort to develop animal models that can reproduce the clinical correlates of the human disease is greatly needed for IC/BPS research. Since the etiology of IC/BPS remains elusive and many factors appear to be causative for the disease, animal models with diverse pathological pathways have been developed [22] . It is now generally agreed that a valid IC/BPS animal model must present, at minimum, pelvic or bladder nociception and/or voiding dysfunction such as urinary frequency [22] . In this study we created a novel transgenic cystitis model (URO-MCP-1) that secretes MCP-1 by the bladder epithelium and develops bladder inflammation upon intravesical instillation of a single sub-noxious dose of LPS. Besides bladder histopathology, the URO-MCP-1 model demonstrates both qualitative and quantitative changes in bladder functions such as increased pelvic pain sensitivity, increased urinary frequency, reduced average volume voided per micturition (urgency), and reduced maximum volume voided per micturition (bladder capacity). Because of the genetic stability of the incorporated transgene, the URO-MCP-1 model is stable and reproducible and provides a unique translational model for IC/BPS research. URO-MCP-1 mice do not spontaneously develop bladder inflammation, pelvic pain and voiding dysfunction in the unmanipulated state, suggesting that the urothelial expression of MCP-1 alone is not sufficient to cause bladder inflammation and functional changes in these mice. However, URO-MCP-1 mice readily develop phenotypical and functional changes upon intravesical administration of a single sub-noxious dose of LPS. Our observation is similar to those observed in other MCP-1 transgenic models. Gunn and associates reported that transgenic mice expressing MCP-1 by type II alveolar epithelial cells showed no morphologic evidence of inflammation in the lung but exhibited enhanced inflammatory response upon treatment with either intraperitoneal LPS or intravenous yeast wall glucan [7] . Huang and associates reported that transgenic mice expressing MCP-1 by astrocytes only manifested neurological impairment and encephalopathy after treatment with intravenous pertussis toxin plus subcutaneous complete Freund's adjuvant [8] . Similarly, Trujillo and associates reported that transgenic mice expressing MCP-1 by oligodendrocytes predisposed mice to a defective immune response to a minimally lethal neurotropic coronavirus and developed encephalitis following intracranial infection by the virus [9] . These observations indicated that development of inflammatory disorders is dependent on both genetic and environmental factors in the MCP-1 transgenic models.",

We have observed that URO-MCP-1 mice exhibit a much lower threshold trigger for producing exaggerated responses to a single sub-noxious dose of LPS as compared to wild-type C57BL/6 mice. Intravesical administration of LPS at 1 \u03bcg in 100 \u03bcl PBS efficiently induced profound bladder inflammation in URO-MCP-1 mice but not in wild-type C57BL/6 mice. This dose of LPS used for cystitis induction in URO-MCP-1 mice was only one-tenth of the dose commonly used for cystitis induction in wild-type C57BL/6 mice [23, 24] . This feature of the URO-MCP-1 model is clinically relevant, as subclinical infection can be a causative factor for IC/BPS and patients with IC/BPS are often found to be hypersensitive to minor bladder irritants [25] .",

            "text": "Inflammation plays a central role in the pathogenesis of IC/BPS and may directly affect bladder function in IC/BPS patients [25] . Our recent studies supported the fundamental role of inflammation in IC/BPS, as the production of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) mediated proinflammatory cytokines IL-1\u00df and IL-6 was significantly associated with multiple IC/BPS pain indicators [26] [27] [28] . As a clinically relevant model, the URO-MCP-1 model develops bladder inflammation and functional changes such as pelvic pain, urinary frequency and urgency. In addition to bladder histopathology, the inflamed bladders expressed elevated mRNAs for proinflammatory cytokines IL-1\u00df and IL-6. Moreover, the inflamed bladders also expressed elevated mRNAs for NGF (a neurotrophic factor) and substance P precursor (a neurotransmitter), suggesting the presence of a strong neuro-immune interaction in the animal model. Multiple cell types including urothelial cells, macrophages, mast cells, and neurons are known to express these inflammatory factors, reflecting an ongoing local inflammatory response in the bladders of URO-MCP-1 mice. All these inflammatory factors have been detected in the urine and/or bladder tissues of IC/BPS patients [29] .",
