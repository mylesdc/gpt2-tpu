What is the moi (and viral strain) used in the phosphoproteomic screen in this study. How does this relate to the number of IAV particles per cells? How physiologically relevant are the moi used, and are similar phosphorylation profiles expected at lower moi? 3. Is it possible that part of the phosphorylation signature observed does not result from IAV particles attaching to cells, but from other factors induced and released from infected cells (e.g. interferons or interferon-stimulated gene products). The virus stocks do not seem to be purified. Would it be possible to perform control experiments using conditioned media from which particles are removed? 4. In the mouse experiment, the authors do not use the inhibitor that they used throughout the study, but rather a SSRI that also inhibits GRK2 activity. It cannot be excluded that the inhibition observed results from the drug acting as a SSRI rather than from inhibition of GRK2. Were animal studies also performed using the other GRK2 inhibitor and what was the outcome? The authors could perform inhibition experiment (at least in vitro) using another SSRI that not inhibits GRK2 (e.g. fluoxetine?) to show that SSRIs do not generally inhibit IAV infection and uncoating.",

We apologize for this mistake and we corrected it in the revised version. 10 PFU of the mouse-adapted strain of pandemic H1N1 correspond to 5xLD50 under Swiss animal rights legislation, meaning that the dose used is lethal and already constitutes a high dose. We therefore used the same infection conditions as in our previous mouse experiments but measured weight loss and survival instead of virus titers. Given the modest (but significant) differences in lung virus titers it is probably not too surprising that no significant differences in weight loss or survival were detected. Furthermore, we also examined the lungs of mice on d4 p.i. and compared mock-treated to inhibitor-treated animals (please see figure below). As expected, a clear difference can be seen between mock-infected and influenza A virus-infected animals but no difference was detectable between mock-treated and inhibitor-treated mice. These results show that GRK2 inhibition by paroxetine from d-1 up to d2 results in a significant reduction of virus titers upon challenge with a lethal dose of pandemic H1N1, but is not potent enough to protect from weight loss, death or lung pathology.

It would certainly be very interesting to also look at tyrosine phosphorylation events in response to influenza virus infection. However, in contrast to serine and threonine phosphoproteomics, in which metal affinity purification is used for phosphopeptide enrichment, tyrosine phosphoproteomics mostly relies on the use of antibody-based immunoaffinity purification (6). Although the quality of the anti-phospho-Tyr antibodies and the number of available protocols have increased during the last years, this approach is still technically challenging and the coverage and number of phosphopeptides detected in such studies is modest when compared with similar ones focusing on serine and threonine phosphorylation.",

No significant enrichment of any stress-related pathways was detected for our dataset indicating that the very early infection events do not cause detectable cell stress.

To this end, phosphoproteomic profiling was performed after 5 min and 15 min infection. Kinases activated in response to infection were identified via bioinformatics analysis. Inhibitors of several of the identified kinases were shown to inhibit infection. GRK2 was shown to be required for IAV uncoating. A SSRI that also inhibits GRK2 was shown to decrease IAV replication when administered prior to infection in mice. In general it is a very nice study that is well executed and written.

We hypothesized that these early events would already trigger signalling cascades that enable the following steps of the replication cycle. As it had been shown by Eierhoff et al. that HA binding to cells can trigger EGFR signalling (7) we used an assay to monitor EGFR activation after addition of influenza virus to cells. The results from this assay suggested that 5 and 15 min p.i. would be suitable time points. As a similar study on early signalling events induced by HIV had also analysed time points in the range of 1-15 min (8) we decided to perform the phosphoproteomics analysis for these two time points. We expanded the explanation for our choice of time points in l. 85-93. 3. Is it possible that part of the phosphorylation signature observed does not result from IAV particles attaching to cells, but from other factors induced and released from infected cells (e.g. interferons or interferon-stimulated gene products). The virus stocks do not seem to be purified. Would it be possible to perform control experiments using conditioned media from which particles are removed?",

            "text": "In order to avoid contributions of interferons to the phosphorylation signature we used virus stocks that had been prepared in embryonated chicken eggs and used allantoic fluid from mock-infected eggs as control. If chicken interferon was present in our virus stock it would not be able to induce signalling on human cells due to the species-specific action of interferons. However, as noted by the reviewer we cannot exclude contributions from other components of the allantoic fluid. To address this point we performed a proteomic analysis of our lysates used for the phosphoproteomic analysis and identified chicken proteins present in the different samples. The results of the proteomic analysis are shown in the new supplementary table 1. Only two chicken proteins were at least 2-fold more abundant in the sample infected for 5 min compared to the mock allantoic fluid and three proteins were more abundant in the sample infected for 15 min compared to mock. None of these proteins was present more abundantly at both time points and we can conclude that contributions from chicken proteins present in the virus stock are unlikely to have impacted our results. These new results are described in l. 98-105. Furthermore, we performed an additional control experiment, in which we tested for GRK2 activation upon infection with a purified virus stock. As shown in the new supplementary figure 4g, the purified virus stock also activated GRK2 and we can thus conclude that the activation of GRK2 is independent of allantoic fluid components other than viral particles. These new results are described in l. 256-259. 4 . In the mouse experiment, the authors do not use the inhibitor that they used throughout the study, but rather a SSRI that also inhibits GRK2 activity. It cannot be excluded that the inhibition observed results from the drug acting as a SSRI rather than from inhibition of GRK2. Were animal studies also performed using the other GRK2 inhibitor and what was the outcome? The authors could perform inhibition experiment (at least in vitro) using another SSRI that not inhibits GRK2 (e.g. fluoxetine?) to show that SSRIs do not generally inhibit IAV infection and uncoating.",

However, we do appreciate the reviewer's point that paroxetine could also impact IAV infection via its activity as serotonin reuptake inhibitor.

            "text": "The moi used in the study mentioned in point 1 (ref 8) is very high. What is the moi (and viral strain) used in the phosphoproteomic screen in this study. How does this relate to the number of IAV particles per cells? How physiologically relevant are the moi used, and are similar phosphorylation profiles expected at lower moi? Whereas the study by Eierhoff et al. used an MOI of 100 and avian IAV strain FPV to study the signalling events induced by early steps of virus infection (7) we used an MOI of 25 PFU per cell and strain A/WSN/33 for our phosphoproteomics analysis. In our revised version, we also included this information about our experimental set-up in the legend for figure 1 and in the results section (l. 91). In order to determine the number of virus particles that corresponds to an MOI of 25 we quantified the amount of viral M segment by RT-qPCR in our virus preparation. We included serial dilutions of an M-segment encoding plasmid as standard to obtain absolute copy numbers and found that an MOI of 25 PFU per cell corresponds to approximately 25.000 virus particles per cell. This may seem unphysiological at first glance and certainly does not reflect the initial infection event in vivo.However, when virus replication takes place in the respiratory epithelium, large amounts of virus are produced and epithelial cells can thus be exposed to high doses of virus secreted from neighbouring epithelial cells. Furthermore, the sensitivity of current phosphoproteomics approaches would not be sufficient to detect phosphorylation events that only occur in few cells during low MOI infections as often only a small proportion of a given protein becomes phosphorylated (see GRK2 phosphorylation in new figure 3e). Using an MOI of 25 PFU per cell resulted in a 94% infection rate in A549 cells.Further lowering of the MOI would thus compromise the sensitivity of our approach. Given these technical limitations and the possible physiological relevance of high MOI infections, we believe that our study yielded relevant information about signalling events induced early in IAV infection.",
