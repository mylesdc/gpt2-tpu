The virus is of the Alphavirus genus in the Togaviridae family [1, 2] . CHIKV has been shown to infect and be transmitted by Ae. aegyptii and Ae. albopictus mosquitoes. It was identified in East Africa in the early 1950s and since then has caused epidemics in continental Africa, the Indian Ocean region, and countries of Southeast Asia such as India, where since 2006 suspected cases have been estimated to be 1.39 million, and Singapore [3] [4] [5] [6] . The only reported outbreak outside these areas was in Italy in the Emilia Romagna region in 2007. Small nonepidemic imported cases have been reported in other regions such as North America, France and Japan, which were caused by travelers returning from affected areas [7] [8] [9] .",

Although this study reported that IL-1b, IL-6 and RANTES were correlated with severe acute phase CHIKV disease, cytokine profiles were not determined for the progression and convalescence of the disease. Here we investigated cytokine profiles during the acute phase and 6-and 12-month follow-up of CHIKV infected patients of the Italian 2007 outbreak. Since CHIKV disease can have severe acute phase symptoms and be followed by persistent symptoms in the convalescence phase it was important to investigate the immune response responsible for these maladies. Furthermore, the Italian CHIKV included the A226V mutation and the Singapore virus did not. Furthermore, we analysed the relationship between cytokine levels and patient severity, and IgG levels linking high CXCL9, CXCL10 and IgG levels with disease severity. Therefore, the results presented here are virus specific and reflect previously unreported cytokine profiles which may be important for the development of future therapeutics for CHIKV outbreaks.",

Collaboration with the regional microbiology reference laboratory of Bologna University and the Department of Infectious and Parasitic Diseases of the National Institute of Health in Rome was initiated and identified the patients as having CHIKV. The clinical criteria was described as acute onset of fever (.38.5uC) and severe arthralgia not explained by other medical conditions. CHIKV infection was confirmed by one or more of the acute phase tests: virus isolation, reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) positive for CHIKV nsp1 gene, seroconversion to virus-specific serum antibodies collected at least 1 to 3 weeks apart, or presence of virus-specific IgM antibodies in a single serum sample collected [15] . Acute CHIKV patient samples were determined to be in the viral stage if the sample was PCR positive for CHIKV (7 patients), in the IgM antibody initiation stage if the sample was PCR negative, IgM positive, IgG negative (6 patients) or in the seroconversion stage (22 patients) if the sample was PCR negative, IgM positive and IgG positive. The samples were considered to be high IgG if the IgG level was greater than 6400 (6 months) (31 patients high out of 50) or greater than 3200 (12 months) (20 patients out of 50). IgG levels below or equal to these thresholds were considered low IgG.

After determining the cytokine profiles of our Italian 2007 CHIKV patients during their disease resolution, we next sought to determine the association between symptom severity and cytokine levels. Patients were determined to be non-symptomatic (N), to have mild symptoms (M) or to have severe symptoms (S) depending on their responses to a questionnaire. The cytokine levels were then grouped by symptom level and a Mann-Whitney U test was used to determine significance among the severity groups for each cytokine. CXCL10 and CXCL9 were found to be significantly increased in the patients with mild and severe symptoms at 6 months following initial infection compared to the patients reporting no symptoms ( Figure 6A) . A 2 fold difference was seen between the medians of the non-symptomatic and severe patients for CXCL10 and a 5 fold difference for CXCL9. No statistical difference was seen for any of the 13 cytokines profiled for the 12-month follow-up. CXCL10 and CXCL9 at 12 months are shown for comparison ( Figure 6B ). Moreover, we analyzed the IgG levels at the 6-month follow-up in patients with no symptoms, mild symptoms, and severe symptoms. The results showed IgG levels were statistically increased with Figure 1 . Acute phase CHIKV disease was associated with high levels of IL-6, CXCL9, CCL2, CXCL10. Cytokine Bead Array analysis of CHIKV patient serum samples showed high levels of IL-6, CXCL9, CCL2 and CXCL-10 are associated with acute disease phase and decreased with patient convalescence. Six-month and one-year cytokine levels were analysed for statistical significance using the Wilcoxon test for Significance by comparing with acute levels.

Conversely, the trend for TNF-a, IL-1b, IL-2, IL-5 and IL-12 were low initially and increased as patients began to recover from acute illness. High levels of CXCL9, CXCL10, CCL2, and IL-6 in the acute phase possibly indicated an inflammatory program initiating adaptive T-cell immunity [27] . CXCL9 and CXCL10 are both chemokines induced by IFN-c and are part of the chemokine program that regulates the migration of monocytes/ macrophages, memory T cells and NK cells and are associated with the polarization of T cells [27] . IL-6, a pleiotropic cytokine, has a destructive role in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), contributing to joint inflammation as well as joint pain [28, 29] . The increased IL-6 levels in the acute phase of our study may be the initiating factor of the severe joint pain symptoms reported in CHIKV patients which mimics RA. Furthermore, IL-6 is important during acute phases of the disease by acting as an important immune mediator of fever activating muscle metabolism to increase core body temperature [28] . Since fever is a common symptom of acute CHIKV disease, it is highly probable that the high IL-6 levels were contributing to the acute fever and the IL-6 decreasing trend followed patient core body temperature as it returned to resting temperature in the follow-up.",

            "text": "A second host immune response profile was characterized by TNF-a, IL-1b, Il-10, Il-12, IFN-c and IL-5, which increased from the acute phase into convalescence. Interestingly, TNF-a and IL-1b, which are known to co-induce the other's expression, are both involved in chronic inflammatory diseases such as RA, chronic hepatitis B and C infection [23, 29, 30] . Importantly, TNF-a and IL-1b are main contributors to joint pain, which is the major symptom of RA. An internal balance of TNF-a or IL-1b levels is imperative as mis-regulation of either has been shown to be a major proponent of chronic diseases (RA). Our data indicated that these cytokines increased significantly during patient convalescence above those of the control group, but were not statistically changed in patients reporting mild or severe symptoms. These data may imply that the increased levels of TNF-a and IL-1b in the convalescence phase were not a major contributor of chronic damage causing persistent severe joint pain symptoms during the Italian outbreak even though these cytokines have previously been found to play a destructive role in chronic inflammatory diseases. Furthermore, TNF-a immunomodulators have previously been used as a common treatment for RA and IL-1b immunomodulators are effective with other chronic diseases such as systemiconset juvenile idiopathic arthritis and in adult onset Still's diseases [29, 31] . Taken together, these findings suggest TNF-a and IL-1b therapies would not be effective controlling the prolonged symptoms of CHIKV disease since the raised levels during convalescence were not associated with patient severity. Previously, cytokine profiles have been analyzed from patients during an Asian outbreak of CHIKV [22] . Ng and colleagues, investigated 30 cytokines and growth factors from 10 acute phase CHIKV patients, determined that the levels of 8 cytokines, 2 chemokines and 3 growth factors were significantly raised in patients compared to those of the control group. In accordance with their data, IL-6, CXCL9 and CXCL10 were also increased in the acute phase of our patients as compared to control. Since the results from the previous study did not follow the patients during convalescence, our study added significant insight to the progression of CHIKV disease. We found that these three cytokine levels decreased as the patients convalesced as discussed above. Conversely, we found CCL2 also to be increased in the acute phase compared to that of the control group, which was unchanged in the Ng study. Furthermore, Ng et al. found IL-5 and IL-10 were significantly increased in the acute phase where our data indicated that IL-5 and IL-10 were initially low and below control levels and increased following the acute phase. These discrepancies can possibly be explained by the patient populations: the Ng study patients and our patients were from significantly varied genetic backgrounds (Asian and European, respectively). Therefore, differences in immune response may reflect variations in immunological genetic programs. As well, the virus that caused the two outbreaks also differed genetically. Even though the virus that caused the Singapore outbreak was the same genotype as the Italian virus, the virus that infected the Italian patients had the A226V mutation in the E1 gene which was acquired on La Reunion Island [19] . Although the impact of this mutation has been shown to increase vector infectivity [20] , the mutation has not been investigated on the human or mammalian immune response.",

As the viral load decreased in the WNV patients, IgM antibody levels were initiated and followed by IgM conversion to IgG, thereby marking the 3 stages of the acute phase. From this work we were able to identify the stages of the CHIKV patients and compare their respective serum cytokine levels. We found CXCL10 and IL-10 levels decreased as patients progressed through the viral stage to seroconversion. Since CXCL10 is often correlated with viral load, this observation was not surprising [32] . High IL-10 levels in the viral stage may act in an effort to control the IFN-c program [33] shown by high CXCL10 levels. Furthermore, plasma levels of CCL2, IL-6 as well as CXCL10 have all been correlated with viral loads in virus infected individuals [24, 34, 35] . It is possible that the decrease of CCL2 and IL-6 we observed subsequent to the acute phase [14] correlated with viral clearance, although not with antibody levels. Analysis of the cytokine/antibody response was carried on to the 6-and 12-month follow-up where we grouped the patients on their IgG levels. CXCL9, CXCL10 and IL-6 were raised in the patients with increased IgG levels at 6 months and CXCL9 at the 12month follow-up. These proinflammatory cytokine associations with high IgG levels may represent the persistence of an active immune system.",

Previously, CXCL10 has been associated with severe viral disease supporting a role for CXCL10 in severe CHIKV disease [34] [35] [36] [37] . These studies did not find an association with CXCL9 and severity as seen in our CHIKV patients. Our findings suggest high CXCL10 and CXCL9 associated with severity to be a unique signature of CHIKV. Interestingly, not only are CXCL10 and CXCL9 expressed in RA and other arthritis related disease patients [38] [39] [40] [41] , but they have been shown to be biomarkers for RA symptoms, implying a similar mechanism for joint destruction in CHIKV disease [42] . Moreover, CXCL9 and CXCL10 may be contributors of persistent immune activation in CHIKV disease leading to chronic symptoms, which implies cytokine immunomodulation may significantly improve patient treatment and recovery. Importantly, CXCL10 also has prognostic value in the treatment of viral hepatitis where CXCL10 levels follow disease recovery [43] supporting our finding and proposes a prognostic role for CXCL10 in CHIKV. Furthermore, our data puts forth CXCL10 and CXCL9 as possible drug targets for treatment of CHIKV symptoms in the convalescence phase due to the association with severity; however, further investigation is needed on CXCL10 and CXCL9 efficacy. In addition, not only are the identified cytokines useful as possible drug targets but the cytokine signatures described can also be applied when testing newly developed CHIKV therapeutics. As CHIKV therapeutics are evaluated in the CHIKV disease model, cytokine profiles can be used as an output for determining the efficacy of the novel therapeutics.",

Currently, mast cell activation through FccRs by high levels of circulating IgG antibodies is hypothesized to contribute to the pathological destruction of synovium in RA [44] [45] [46] . In addition, antibody immune complex formation within the joint stabilizing inflammatory mediators, such as chemokines and complement proteins, is another possible low IgG level group (L) and a high IgG level group (H). Cytokine Bead Array analysis of the serum samples showed a significant difference in CXCL9, CXCL10 and IL-6 between patients with high and low IgG levels at the 6-month time point.

Since the samples from the CHIKV patients were taken at various stages of the acute phase, we went on to determine if there were cytokines marking the viral (V), IgM antibody initiation (AI) or seroconversion (SC) stage. Acute CHIKV patient samples were determined to be PCR positive for CHIKV (viral stage), IgM positive, IgG negative (IgM antibody initiation stage) or IgM positive, IgG postive (seroconversion stage). Samples were put into Viral stage (V), Antibody Initiation stage (AI) or Seroconversion stage (SC) according to the presence of CHIKV, IgM and IgG antibodies.
