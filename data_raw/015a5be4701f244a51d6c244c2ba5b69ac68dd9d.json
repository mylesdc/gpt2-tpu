            "text": "Ebola virus outbreaks, such as the 2014 Makona epidemic in West Africa, are episodic and deadly. Filovirus antivirals are currently not clinically available. Our findings suggest interferon gamma, an FDA-approved drug, may serve as a novel and effective prophylactic or treatment option. Using mouse-adapted Ebola virus, we found that murine interferon gamma administered 24 hours before or after infection robustly protects lethally-challenged mice and reduces morbidity and serum viral titers. Furthermore, we demonstrated that interferon gamma profoundly inhibits Ebola virus infection of macrophages, an early cellular target of infection. As early as six hours following in vitro infection, Ebola virus RNA levels in interferon gamma-treated macrophages were lower than in infected, untreated cells. Addition of the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide, to interferon gamma-treated macrophages did not further reduce viral RNA levels, suggesting that interferon gamma blocks life cycle events that require protein synthesis such as virus replication. Microarray studies with interferon gamma-treated human macrophages identified more than 160 interferon-stimulated genes. Ectopic expression of a select group of these genes inhibited Ebola virus infection. These studies provide new potential avenues for antiviral targeting as these genes that have not previously appreciated to inhibit negative strand RNA viruses and specifically Ebola virus infection. As treatment of interferon gamma robustly protects mice from lethal Ebola virus infection, we propose that interferon gamma should be further evaluated for its efficacy as a prophylactic and/or therapeutic strategy against filoviruses. Use of this FDAapproved drug could rapidly be deployed during future outbreaks.",

EBOV infection causes dysregulation of these antigen-presenting cells, increasing production and release of pro-inflammatory proteins, vasoactive molecules, and coagulation factors [5] [6] [7] . Pro-inflammatory molecules recruit other target cells to the site of infection, providing additional cells for virus infection and increasing circulation of inflammatory cells and proteins. This uncontrolled amplification of infection and cytokine production results in dysregulation of the inflammatory response, leading to the systemic spread of the virus, excessive cytokine accumulation and circulatory collapse observed in cases of fatal EBOV hemorrhagic fever in humans and non-human primates [3, 4, 6, 8] . Contributing to this amplifying dysregulation, EBOV sustains replication in macrophages and DCs by counteracting early innate immune responses, thereby decreasing effective host responses to the virus [5, 9] . These events in combination with decreased T cell numbers observed in EBOV-infected individuals [10] are thought to lead to poor adaptive immune responses to infection.",

One approach to controlling virus replication in macrophages is to elicit early innate immune responses. If these responses could be triggered prior to virus-mediated inhibition of these responses, systemic control of EBOV replication should be possible. Previous studies have investigated the ability of type I interferons (IFNs) to decrease EBOV morbidity and mortality with mixed results [11] [12] [13] . Jahrling et al. demonstrated that administration of IFN-alpha2b by itself did not significantly alter the course of EBOV in cynomolgus macaques, but more recently IFN-\u03b2 was shown to prolong survival in rhesus macaques [11, 12] . Additionally, the combination of type I IFN with three monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against EBOV glycoprotein (GP) provided robust protection against lethal challenge, while neither the IFN nor mAbs alone was highly efficacious [13] .",

Macrophages treated with IFN\u03b3 alone or in combination with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF\u03b1) are activated towards a M1 phenotype that is characteristically proinflammatory and antiviral, enhancing host defenses [14] [15] [16] . As IFN\u03b3 directly stimulates the expression of a number of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) having antiviral activity [17, 18] , IFN\u03b3 treatment would be predicted to generate macrophages that are resistant to EBOV infection. Since it is thought that EBOV infection of macrophages is responsible for dysregulated cytokine production, reducing infection would likely reduce aberrant cytokine production concomitantly.

Infection of peritoneal macrophages with EBOV GP/rVSV resulted in remarkably similar effects of GM-CSF, M-CSF and the combination IFN\u03b3/TNF\u03b1 treatments to that we observed with EBOV (compare Fig 1A-1B and S2 Fig) .

To assess if the IFN\u03b3 antiviral effect on macrophages was independent of type I IFN receptor signaling, peritoneal macrophages were harvested from interferon \u03b1/\u03b2 receptor knockout mice (IFNAR -/-) and cultured for 24 hours with M-CSF or M-CSF plus IFN\u03b3 prior to EBOV GP/rVSV infection.

Therefore, to narrow down which step(s) within the life cycle is affected by IFN\u03b3, we compared the ability of IFN\u03b3 and CHX to inhibit viral RNA production and determined if the combination of these two drugs inhibited viral RNA levels to a greater extent. BALB/c IFNAR -/peritoneal macrophages were treated with M-CSF in the presence or absence of IFN\u03b3 for 24 hours. At the initiation of EBOV infection under BSL4 conditions, CHX was added and viral RNA levels were assessed at 6 and 14 hours of infection. CHX or IFN\u03b3 suppressed EBOV nucleoprotein (NP) and polymerase (L) RNA levels equally and the combination of inhibitors did not further reduce EBOV RNA production ( Fig 2B) . Similar results were observed with EBOV GP/rVSV infections harvested at 6 hours (S4 Fig).

Production of ISG proteins alters macrophage function and protects cells from viral infection [35] . While gene sets activated by these two types of IFNs overlap, both type I and II IFNs also stimulate unique subsets of genes [17, 18, 36] . To determine the impact of IFN\u03b3 stimulation on gene expression in our macrophage cultures, we performed microarray analyses. We identified 268 genes with at least two-fold increased or decreased expression in IFN\u03b3-treated six-day- Table) . In parallel, gene arrays were performed in IFN\u03b3-treated alveolar macrophages and 45 genes were identified to have altered expression (S5 Fig and S2 Table) . Forty-one of the significantly altered genes were identified in both arrays ( Fig 3B and S6A Fig) . Through pathway analysis of the gene profiles, we discovered that the top IFN\u03b3-upregulated genes in our arrays are involved in immune responses, development, signal transduction, ATP metabolism, or transcription (S6B Fig). Our arrays identified IFN\u03b3-enhanced expression of ISGs known to be primary-response genes, such as the transcription factors IRF1 and IRF9, and more poorly studied secondaryresponse ISGs, such as the p65 GBPs and the apolipoprotein L family of proteins that are thought be regulated by IRFs [37] . Consistent with previous reports, a number of chemokines Interferon-\u03b3 Inhibits Ebola Virus Infection (CXCL9, CXCL10, CCL8 and CXCL11) and complement components (C1s and C1r) were also highly upregulated by IFN\u03b3 [14, 16, 17, 38] . Our array findings were validated by examining mRNA levels of several of the top ISGs, including IRF1, GBP4, GBP5, IFIT3, RARRES3, and VAMP5 by qRT-PCR ( Fig 4A and S5B Fig) . HeLa cells were infected with EBOV 48 hours following electroporation of 5 \u03bcg of ISG-RFP lentiviral constructs. Infection was assessed by microscopy 24 hours later and percent of cells that were GFP positive were calculated by CellProfiler image analysis software. A lentiviral construct expressing IRF1 served as a positive control in these studies. (D) IRF1 knock down increases EBOV GP/rVSV infection following IFN\u03b3 stimulation. IRF1 or scrambled (Scr) siRNA were loaded into HEK 293T derived exosomes. SiRNA loaded exosomes (2.5 \u03bcg) were delivered and IFN\u03b3 added to BALB/c IFNAR -/peritoneal macrophages 24 hours prior to EBOV GP/rVSV infection (MOI = 0.1). Twenty-four hours following infection, total RNA was isolated from the macrophages. Amount of IRF1 expression and infection (by detection of VSV polymerase (L)) was quantified by qRT-PCR. Results represent the means \u00b1 s.e.m. Significance was determined by Student's t-test analysis, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001. To assess the importance of some of our most significantly upregulated ISGs in controlling EBOV GP/rVSV and EBOV infection, IFN\u03b3-upregulated genes were transfected into cells and their effect on virus infection was assessed. The panel of ISGs included both well-studied and poorly characterized IFN\u03b3-responsive genes. Eight lentiviral constructs that expressed an ISG and red fluorescent protein (RFP) were assessed for inhibition of EBOV GP/rVSV or EBOV in highly permissive cells [23] .",

As IRF1 is a transcription factor critical for IFN\u03b3 signaling by driving downstream expression of many IFN\u03b3 target genes [19] , we also assessed if knock down of IRF1 in M-CSF-treated and M-CSF/IFN\u03b3-treated macrophages altered infection of EBOV GP/rVSV in peritoneal macrophages. IRF1 siRNA or scrambled control siRNA was delivered to peritoneal macrophages by exosomes since direct siRNA transfection of macrophages is highly inefficient. To validate this siRNA delivery method, we initially demonstrated that exosomes are efficiently engulfed by murine peritoneal macrophages (S7 Fig). In the context of EBOV GP/rVSV infection, delivery of IRF1 siRNA containing exosomes knocked down IRF1 mRNA levels by approximately 50% in both M-CSF-and M-CSF/IFN\u03b3treated macrophages ( Fig 4D) . With IRF1 knock down, a significant increase in EBOV GP/ rVSV RNA was observed 24 hours following infection, consistent with the importance of IRF1 expression in controlling virus infection by IFN\u03b3.",

Evaluation of these ISGs for their ability to inhibit EBOV demonstrated that they also effectively blocked EBOV, identifying these as novel ISGs that are likely important for the control of EBOV in IFN\u03b3-treated cells. Surprisingly, expression of STAT1 only modestly inhibited EBOV GP/rVSV infection, likely because significant levels of STAT1 are constitutively expressed within these cells and control of STAT1 activity is primarily regulated by its phosphorylation status [41] [42] [43] .

For these studies, BALB/c IFNAR -/mice were used as little to no pathogenesis is observed with EBOV GP/rVSV infections of wild-type mice, but significant morbidity and mortality occurs in IFNAR -/mice. Initial IFN\u03b3 dose response studies demonstrated that both 3.3 and 10 \u03bcg of IFN\u03b3 protected IFNAR -/mice against lethal EBOV GP/rVSV challenge (S8A Fig). Further, neither dose of IFN\u03b3 had any detectable consequence on the weight or health of the mice. Therefore, subsequent studies were performed with both dosages. IFN\u03b3 administered by i.p. injection 24 hours prior to, 2 or 6 hours after a lethal dose of EBOV GP/rVSV protected mice against challenge, with treated mice demonstrating significantly reduced mortality, weight loss and clinical sickness scores compared to untreated, virus-infected animals (Figs 5A and S8B-S8D). At the 10 \u03bcg IFN\u03b3 dose, we also assessed survival of mice when IFN\u03b3 was given at 12 and 48 hours after challenge. While only 75% of the mice survived challenge in the 12-hour post challenge group, the protection offered by this treatment was not statistically different than that conferred at time points more proximal to the challenge (Fig 5A) . However, IFN\u03b3 administered 48 hours following EBOV GP/rVSV did not protect mice against lethal challenge.",

Initial studies demonstrated that equivalent concentrations of VSV were more virulent in mice than our recombinant virus, EBOV GP/rVSV, perhaps because of the broad cellular tropism conferred by the native VSV glycoprotein G [44, 45] . As a consequence, in these studies we used 10 2 infectious units of VSV as our challenge virus, the lowest concentration of VSV that resulted in predictable death. IFNAR -/mice challenged with VSV were given 3.3 \u03bcg of IFN\u03b3 either 24 hours prior or 2 hours after challenge. While the 24-hour pretreated mice had significant protection, 40% mortality was still observed. Surprisingly, the survival of the 2-hour IFN\u03b3 post-treatment mice was not significantly different from the PBStreated, VSV infected mice (S8B Fig) . This finding stands in contrast to the robust protection IFN\u03b3 conferred at 2, 6 and 12 hours following EBOV GP/rVSV challenge. These findings suggested that VSV infection is less sensitive to IFN\u03b3, particularly when administered as a postchallenge antiviral.",

BALB/c mice were administered 3 or 10 \u03bcg of IFN\u03b3 i.p. and challenged i.p. with MA-EBOV 24 hours later. Initial IFN\u03b3 dose response studies indicated that mice pretreated with 10 \u03bcg of IFN\u03b3 were better protected against MA-EBOV than treatment with 3 \u03bcg (S9A Fig). Thus, in subsequent studies, mice challenged with MA-EBOV were administered 10 \u03bcg of IFN\u03b3. Since IFN\u03b3 given 48 hours following infection did not protect IFNAR -/mice against EBOV GP/rVSV (Fig 5A) , in these studies we assessed the protection IFN\u03b3 conferred against MA-EBOV when administered 24 hours prior to, at the time of infection, 6 or 24 hours following infection. All IFN\u03b3-treated mice, regardless of time of treatment, had significantly less morbidity and mortality than untreated, infected mice, with treatment as late as 24 hours following infection protecting 100% of the mice from death (Fig 6A and 6B) . Lower MA-EBOV viremia levels were observed in the 24 hour post challenge treated mice, but not in the 24 hour pre-infection treatment group, suggesting that IFN\u03b3 administration as a post-exposure antiviral may prove more efficacious than when used prophylactically (Fig 6C) .",

IFN\u03b3 treatment profoundly inhibited EBOV infection of peritoneal macrophages in tissue culture, consistent with the protection conferred by IFN\u03b3 and evidence that this cell type is an important early target for virus replication. Since antiviral efficacy required the presence of IFN\u03b3 receptor, but not the type I receptor, IFN\u03b3 control of EBOV infection occurs independently of type I IFN responses. Thus, we sought to identify specific IFN\u03b3-stimulated genes involved in its antiviral effect. In addition to previously characterized ISGs, we identified three novel IFN\u03b3-stimulated factors, GBP5, RARRES3 and VAMP5. To date, GBP5, RARRES3 or VAMP5 has not been shown to control negative strand RNA virus infection. Finally, we demonstrated that the recombinant BSL2-level virus, EBOV GP/rVSV, recapitulates our findings with EBOV, arguing that studies with this BSL2 model virus may serve as a safer and cost effective alternative for initial evaluations of novel anti-filoviral agents. Antiviral activity conferred by IFN\u03b3 against members of the Mononegavirales has been previously reported. For instance, addition of Pteropus alecto IFN\u03b3 to bat cells protects against the paramyxoviruses, Semiki forest virus and Hendra virus [47] . Additionally, several lines of evidence indicate that IFN\u03b3 is effective against rabies virus in tissue culture and in vivo, potentially through stimulation of type I IFN pathways [48, 49] .",

However, the timing of IFN\u03b3 protection against wild-type EBOV and wild-type VSV differed. IFN\u03b3 treatment protected against VSV only when given prior to infection, whereas post-challenge treatment appeared somewhat more efficacious against EBOV than pre-challenge treatment. Recent studies demonstrate that some ISGs are solely synthesized during the first few hours following IFN stimulation, whereas others are expressed for longer periods of time [50] . The difference in timing of IFN\u03b3 protection against VSV versus EBOV suggests that ISGs responsible for protection may differ. Future studies are needed to explore this possibility. Since mice challenged with EBOV GP/rVSV were protected by IFN\u03b3 treatment at post challenge time points in a manner similar to EBOV, the difference in timing of protection may be related to the cell populations targeted by the two wild-type viruses.",

Not surprisingly, expression of IFN\u03b3-activated transcription factor IRF1 inhibited EBOV infection and this ISG served as a positive control in these experiments [18, 40, 52] . Other downstream ISGs were selected for study based on the enhancement of their expression elicited by IFN\u03b3 in our gene array studies and availability of expression constructs. The ability of GBP5, RARRES3 and VAMP5 to inhibit negative strand RNA viruses has been poorly studied and the mechanisms driving inhibition of virus replication remain to be elucidated.

These various model organisms offer different advantages for studying EBOV pathogenesis and assessing novel antiviral treatments. While NHPs are considered the most representative model for EBOV infection as they display very similar symptoms to those observed in humans [72] , they are expensive and, ethically, the use of these animals should be limited to late phase pre-clinical studies. In contrast, infection of mice with MA-EBOV serves as a good, genetically manipulatable small animal model for early phase evaluation of vaccines and therapeutic interventions, allowing assessment of their impact on viral pathogenesis. Our definitive evidence of IFN\u03b3 efficacy in this small animal model paves the way for future NHP studies to further assay the anti-EBOV properties of IFN\u03b3.",

The antiviral effects of IFN\u03b3 are less well-studied, but this protein is a FDA-approved therapy for chronic granulomatous disease and osteopetrosis [75, 76] . Chronic granulomatous patients receive IFN\u03b3 three times weekly to prevent infections, which can serve as life-long protective treatment in these patients [77, 78] . The established safety and effectiveness of IFN\u03b3 against these disorders and the ability of IFN\u03b3 to profoundly inhibit EBOV infection in our studies suggest that IFN\u03b3 may serve as an EBOV antiviral therapy.",

Two-tailed, unpaired Student's t-tests were used to compare experimental treatment group to no IFN\u03b3 control for the majority of the studies reported here. To assess variance in these studies, F tests to compare variance were performed in parallel to determine that variance was similar between groups. For protein translation inhibition studies, a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to compare the no IFN\u03b3 control to the different treatments followed by a Tukey post hoc multiple comparison analysis to determine statistical significance. For nonparametric data, Mann-Whitney U-test was used. Log-rank (Mantel-Cox) tests were used to analyze differences in survival. P values less than 0.05 were considered significant. Death of mice at a particular day is indicated by a cross and value indicating the number of mice that succumb to infection. (B) IFN\u03b3 enhances survival of EBOV GP/rVSV infected mice and more modestly enhances survival following wild-type VSV infection. 3.3 \u03bcg IFN\u03b3 or PBS was administered by i.p. injection to BALB/c IFNAR -/mice 24 hours prior to or 2 hours following 10 3 iu of EBOV GP/rVSV or 10 2 iu VSV infection (n!8/treatment). Protection studies with 3.3 \u03bcg of IFN\u03b3 were also performed at 6 hours following EBOV GP/rVSV challenge. Significance was determined by Mantel-Cox Test; compared to EBOV GP/rVSV PBS mice, \u00c3\u00c3 p< 0.01, \u00c3\u00c3\u00c3 p < 0.001, compared to VSV PBS mice, # p< 0.05, ### p< 0.001, compared EBOV GP/rVSV IFN\u03b3 treated groups to VSV IFN\u03b3 treated groups, @ p< 0.05. (C) Treatment of mice with 10 \u03bcg IFN\u03b3 24 hours prior to or 2, 6, 12 or 48 hours following EBOV GP/rVSV infection prevents weight loss during the first 3 days of EBOV GP/rVSV in vivo infection. (D) IFN\u03b3 (10 \u03bcg) treatment protects against weight loss at early days following infection. IFN\u03b3 was given 24 hours prior or 2, 6, 12 or 48 hours following EBOV GP/rVSV. For C and D, results represent means \u00b1 s.e.m. For B-D, treatment groups consist of at least 8 mice per group. Significance was determined by Student's t-test compared to PBS control, \u00c3\u00c3\u00c3 p < 0.001. Findings in panels A-C represent 7 mice per group from one experiment. (D) IFN\u03b3 treatment inhibits MA-EBOV viremia. Serum was collected 4 days following infection and viral loads quantified with 10-fold serial dilutions of serum on Vero-E6 cells to determine PFU/mL. Data represent 2 or 3 mice per group. Significance was determined by Student's t-test compared to PBS control, \u00c3 p < 0.05. (TIF) S1 Table.
