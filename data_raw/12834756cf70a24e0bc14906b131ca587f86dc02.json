Point-of-care testing in the field is lacking owing to the requirement for a simple, robust field applicable test that does not require professional laboratory equipment. The aim of this study was to establish a novel reverse transcription polymerase spiral reaction (RT-PSR) assay for the rapid detection of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV). For the assay, a specific RT-PSR primer pair was designed against a conserved region in PEDV ORF3.",

PEDV infections are more frequent in the winter [3] , and although PEDV can infect swine of all ages, it causes the most serious harm to suckling piglets. Since the discovery of PED in England in 1971, the disease has expanded to many countries in Europe and Asia, especially China and South Korea, which has caused huge economic losses [4] . In China, PEDV is widely distributed, and outbreaks have a strong negative impact on the swine industry, in part due to the acute onset and fast spread of the virus,the incidence rate in piglets can be very prevalent [5] [6] [7] .",

Although immunological methods are generally low cost and easy to perform, they have several disadvantages, including inconclusive results and the long time required to perform the assays. To decrease the time required for PEDV detection, PCR-related methods focused on the amplification of viral nucleic acids have been developed, which have been shown to be more efficient, highly sensitive and specific, even at different stages of the disease, when compared to immunological diagnostic methods. However, these molecular diagnostic methods cannot be widely used because of their complex operation, time-consuming nature, and the requirement for expensive instrumentation.",

The polymerase spiral reaction (PSR) [14] is a novel nucleic acid isothermal amplification method that has the advantages of simplicity, rapidity, accuracy, and low cost when compared to conventional PCR. In addition, less primer is required, and primer design is simpler than for loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP). Due to the high efficiency of amplification, product formation is accompanied by high levels of pyrophosphate ion by-product, leading to a change in pH. Therefore, a pH-sensitive dye can be used to detect the product of the reaction with the naked eye [15] . PSR detection methods have been used for numerous human and veterinary pathogens [16] [17] [18] [19] . Therefore, we evaluated clinical samples using the newly developed RT-PSR method to determine the method's utility for early detection of PEDV.",

Therefore, the optimum temperature and time for detecting PEDV by RT-PSR was 62\u00b0C and 50 min, respectively.

Therefore, the RT-PSR assay is more sensitive than the conventional RT-PCR assay.

The RT-PCR-negative samples were confirmed the presence of PEDV by virus isolation. The RT-PSR and RT-PCR assay for detecting PEDV possessed an analytical specificity of 100% (0 false negative) and 92.1% (3 false negative), respectively. These results demonstrate that conventional PCR is not adequately sensitive to detect PEDV in samples with low viral loads or the PSR assay is less affected by potential inhibitors within the samples. Moreover, the efficiency of the developed detection method is not affected by co-infection. Based on the above results, the accuracy of the RT-PSR method is well suited for the detection of early viral infections.",

            "text": "PEDV, a predominant cause of acute enteric infection in swine, leads to severe dehydrating diarrhea and economic losses in the swine industry worldwide. In recent years, the incidence rates of various infectious diseases in swine have been rapidly increasing, and co-infection with PEDV and a variety of other porcine diseases is becoming more and more common [20] . Moreover, the cure rate for PEDV is significantly higher in the early stage of infection than in the late stage of infection. Therefore, it is necessary to establish a rapid, sensitive, and specific method for detecting PEDV early in primary veterinary clinics, which would be a major breakthrough for this disease. At present, numerous established laboratory diagnostic techniques are used to identify PEDV. Kim [21] compared PEDV detection using RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry, and in situ hybridization; Zhou [22] developed and evaluated three assays, including conventional RT-PCR, SYBR Green I real-time RT-PCR, and TaqMan real-time RT-PCR assays. Their results indicated that the TaqMan real-time RT-PCR could be a useful tool for clinical diagnosis, epidemiological surveys, and outbreak investigations of PEDV. In addition, although RT-PCR detected PEDV more frequently than serological techniques, when only tissues are submitted, immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization would be useful methods for the detection of PEDV antigen and nucleic acids. A comprehensive analysis showed that although immunological techniques can rapidly and quantitatively detect PEDV in samples, molecular technologies have become more popular for their superior specificity and sensitivity. By combining current research and technological progress, we developed a more suitable molecular-based assay for the detection of PEDV for early diagnosis.",

            "text": "Because of the difficulties in clinical diagnosis, the low accuracy of serological diagnosis, and the complicated operation of diagnosis via viral isolation methods, PSR technology has been widely used for the differential diagnosis of animal epidemics, such as canine parvovirus 2 (CPV-2) [18] , African swine fever virus (ASFV) [19] , and bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV-1) [23] . PSR not only has the advantages of traditional PCR, as it can also detect pathogenic genes efficiently and specifically, it also has a shorter detection time, is easier to perform, and uses less reagents, when compared to traditional PCR. Specific nucleic acids can be amplified by the PSR method under isothermal conditions, without the need for template pre-denaturation, or sacrificing amplification efficiency. In a positive reaction, the large amount of products, and white pyrophosphoric acid precipitates make a positive result easy to detect. In this experiment, by using the PEDV ORF3 sequence in GenBank, a highly conserved region of the sequence was analyzed and selected for primer design, and a fast, simple, and accurate PEDV RT-PSR method was successfully developed for the detection of PEDV. It offers many advantages compared to conventional PCR, and the most obvious advantage of this assay is that it is sensitive for PEDV. RT-PSR is more accurate than RT-PCR for the detection of clinical samples, and its sensitivity is about 10 times higher than that of conventional PCR. Further analysis of the RT-PSR-positive samples that were not detected by RT-PCR by viral isolation and identification confirmed the presence of PEDV. We speculated that, for such samples, the viral load may be low or it may have been collected early in the course of the infection. Besides limiting by viral load, PSR assay is less affected by potential inhibitors within the samples, which indicated that RNA Extraction of from samples could be omitted [24] . So far, extraction of nucleic acid from clinical samples was consumedly increased the time and cost for diagnosis on farm or in typical veterinary clinics. Therefore, nucleic acid adsorption or other simple strategy needed study and evaluate for application of RT-PSR assay. In addition, by using the developed RT-PSR detection method, PEDV can be amplified across a wide range of temperatures from 60\u00b0C to 65\u00b0C; therefore, it can be performed in a water bath. In addition, expensive electrophoresis equipment and gel imaging systems are required to analyze the results of conventional PCR, which increases the detection costs. In contrast, using the PSR method established in this study, a positive result can be directly determined by the naked eye when mixed dyes are added before the reaction, which do not affect the amplification efficiency, nor agarose gel electrophoresis. These advantages facilitate the rapid detection of PEDV.",
