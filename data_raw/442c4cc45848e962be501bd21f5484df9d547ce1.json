Rather clear evidence was found for regional strains of NNV. Interestingly, most of the geographic defining \"characteristic attributes\" were in codon position three, and not translated into differences for the protein capsid (i.e. they were synonymous variations), suggesting that while NNV strains were geographically isolated and had diverged in different regions for RNA sequences, selection had largely conserved the protein sequences among regions. The apparent selection constraint on the capsid protein may mitigate the risk that despite geographic subdivision, NNV strain variability will confound genetic selection for host resistance. The existence of regional Asian NNV strains may suggest that hatcheries are at risk from NNV not only from imported material but also from endemic reservoirs.",

Moreover QTLs for resistance to NNV in Asian Sea Bass were reported 13 . However, notwithstanding such promising genetic selection opportunities, there are substantial knowledge gaps about the genetic diversity of NNV among Asian grouper hosts: are there many strains within and between regions, perhaps with different virulence so that each region or NNV strain may then require different selection programs, or not? Moreover, is there evidence that NNV strains vary over time? Genetic programs are long term and expensive undertakings so selecting for resistance to the appropriate strain/s is an important consideration, but one with a relative absence of knowledge for Asian grouper NNV. Without some clarity, we may select for inappropriate NNV strains, or see new NNVs transported from a different region for which the grouper have no resistance.",

Available Genbank data show all Asian grouper NNV RNA2 RNA sequences, from Japan to Indonesia, are very closely related, varying by just one or two percent; this closeness means there are challenges to determine phylogenetic relationships especially when using traditional DNA or RNA distance based methods. However, Lowenstein et al. 16 have found for tuna that particular polymorphic nucleotide positions (characteristic attributes) may categorically discriminate groups/ species previous not previous distinguished using traditional analyses based on percent RNA or DNA similarity. Ruan et al. 17 reported certain polymorphic nucleotide positions could discriminate among strains of the SARS virus while Zou et al. 18 reported that \"character based\" bar coding methods outperformed other approaches in discriminating closely related sea snails. Within aquaculture, these approaches of identifying nucleotides that are present in one group but not others have yet to be considered to a large degree, although our group have applied these ideas of characteristic attributes to recently resolve a very long standing taxonomic issue in oysters, whether the very closely related Crassostrea gigas and C. angulata are one or two species, as a prelude to conducting selection on the now identified C. angulata in Vietnam 19 .",

This is the first clear evidence of regionality for RGNNV in the Indo Asian region, but interestingly a large survey in Southern Europe by Panzarin et al. 28 also detected regionality (geographic subdivision) of mostly RGNNV strains. This understanding, of regionality for RGNNV strains, is a completely novel one for Asian marine species, and possibly has some implications for selective breeding programs for host resistance in different regions, and also possibly for general management and prevention of this disease. Far more cases of statistically significant regional differences were detected using \"characteristic attributes\" than using maximum likelihood tree analyses, lending support to the postulate that characteristic attributes can better discriminate closely related species than traditional phylogenetic analyses 16, 18 .",

Actually, we found no evidence of such a hypothetical effect, and indeed there was slightly more variation in sequences from fish hosts than from cell cultures; moreover AMOVA tests did not show significant differences between the sequences from fish hosts and from cell lines. Accordingly, there does not appear to be any evidence based reason not to include the RNA sequences from cell cultures in our analyses on the grounds that they are intrinsically more variable, or intrinsically more different, than sequences from fish.",

            "text": "Another potentially confounding matter was that of substantial diversity of NNV sequences within hatcheries. We did not find evidence of much if any diversity for the same species, same hatchery and same sampling time for grouper species, although some barramundi samples from India showed some slight differences from the same collection time and place; in any case such slight differences were clearly, ipso facto, insufficient to confound the analyses that assessed regional differences (i.e. regional differences were statistically significant). RNA genetic diversity is greater than the capsid protein diversity. The RNA sequence considered here was from the RNA2 gene, which encodes the virus protein capsid protein. Interestingly, the translated RNA2 sequences showed even less variation than the RNA with less evidence of region specific amino acid \"CATS\"; indeed most RNA \"CATS\" were found at codon position three which did not lead to changes in the capsid protein. Statistical tests indicated a very substantial excess of synonymous substitutions over nonsynonymous sites, indicating \"purifying\" selection. Every node in the maximum likelihood tree for the protein sequences was not significant for clusters save one. A parsimonious model to account for this interesting discrepancy between the RNA sequence and the protein is that strains to some degree are geographically isolated and free to diverge especially at RNA triplet positions not tightly constrained by selection (i. e. most codon 3 positions), but those sites (RNA codon positions one and two) where changes can lead to changes in the capsid protein, are more tightly constrained by selection. Balancing all the evidence, the null hypothesis is that the regional Asian strains of NNV are functionally equivalent which may give encouragement that selection for resistance in one region will lead to fish capable of resisting NNV in another. Indeed various have reported that all RGNNV strains that were tested in Asian and Europe were serologically related (within each region) and had the same serotype despite different RNA genotypes, further supporting the hypothesis that selection for one RGNNV RNA genotype will give rise to resistance for all within a region 29, 30 . If this hypothesis is confirmed, then variation evident in the RNA sequences and \"CATs\" may become less relevant to the issue of genetic selection, but still may inform about the epidemiology of the pathogen (see following).",

Munday et al. 6 stated \"Lack of knowledge of the epidemiology of the diseases caused by nodaviruses, except for vertical transmission of the pathogen in some species, has impeded the development of control measures\". By showing the existence of regional strains of RGNNV in Asian marine fish for the first time, our study points to the existence of regional, endemic sources of NNV that may recurrently infect local hatcheries. This understanding is consistent with reports of finding NNV in wild fish 31 . So in addition to taking precautions not to import NNV along with imported broodstock, grouper hatcheries may also now consider the possibility that NNV can enter the hatcheries from local reservoirs from local wild fish carrying NNV.",

New RNA2 sequenced from Vietnam and Taiwan in this study. Four C. altivelis Vietnamese larvae and three E. lanceolatus \u2642 \u00d7 E. fuscoguttatus \u2640 larvae from Taiwan were sequenced for the RNA2 gene. The 1338 bp RNA2 sequence from all four Vietnamese and three Taiwanese samples had a single 1017 bp ORF encoding the coat protein. The coding region of the coat protein is predicted to include 338 amino acids (protein molecular mass of 37.07 kilodaltons), starting at ATG codon (nucleotide 4) and terminating with stop codon TAA (nucleotide 1017). The NNV sequences obtained from Vietnamese Humpback grouper (C. altivelis) in this study are submitted to GenBank with the accession number KU705815. VNN sequences from Asian grouper used in the statistical analyses. The protein capsid encoding RNA sequences from the 82 collated NNV RNA2 sequences had high similarity considering the 1017 bp protein encoding regions (all sequences in Supplementary Table S2, similarity matrix in",
