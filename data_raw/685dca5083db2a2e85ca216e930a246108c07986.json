In the Tc goat system, a human artificial chromosome (HAC) comprising the entire human immunoglobulin (Ig) gene repertoire in the germline configuration was introduced into the genetic makeup of the domestic goat. We achieved this by transferring the HAC into goat fetal fibroblast cells followed by somatic cell nuclear transfer for Tc goat production. Gene and protein expression analyses in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and the sera, respectively, of Tc caprine demonstrated the successful expression of human Ig genes and antibodies. Furthermore, immunization of Tc caprine with inactivated influenza A (H7N9) viruses followed by H7N9 Hemagglutinin 1 (HA1) boosting elicited human antibodies with high neutralizing activities against H7N9 viruses in vitro. As a small ungulate, Tc caprine offers the advantages of low cost and quick establishment of herds, therefore complementing the Tc cattle platform in responses to a range of medical needs and diagnostic applications where small volumes of human antibody products are needed.",

However, because of the nature of voluntary donation of human plasma, the production of human IVIG therapeutics is limited by the shortage of supplies; there are also great concerns over the potential transmission of human diseases from donors to patients. Animal-derived polyclonal antibodies have also been used as therapeutics for certain disease indications, one of which being the life-saving anti-venoms derived from horse sera 2 . These animal-derived polyclonal antibody products also suffer from some significant limitations, chief among which are the severe adverse effects such as allergic reactions caused by the high immunogenicity of these products in humans 2 .",

            "text": "To address the limitation of human-and animal-derived polyclonal antibodies, we at SAB Biotherapeutics, Inc. have developed a transchromosomic (Tc) bovine platform with the capability to produce large quantities of highly potent fully-human polyclonal antibodies 3, 4 . In the Tc bovine, the bovine immunoglobulin genes were genetically inactivated by gene targeting and the Ig functions were reconstituted by a human artificial chromosome (HAC) comprising the entire unrearranged human immunoglobulin heavy-chain (hIGH), kappa-chain (hIGK) and lambda-chain (hIGL) germline loci. Consequently, Tc cattle express fully-human IgG (hIgG) 5, 6 . Through further optimizing the genetic elements on the HAC that are involved in B cell signaling and Ig class switch recombination, physiological levels of hIgG are produced in the blood of Tc bovine (2-9 mg/ml), leading 1 SAB Biotherapeutics, Sioux Falls, SD, 57104, USA. 2 to the production of 300-600 g of hIgG in a Tc bovine per month 6 . Equally important, these Tc cattle can be hyperimmunized with a pathogen of choice to produce highly potent pathogen-specific hIgG which have been successfully used to treat a list of viral and bacterial infection diseases in animal models, and some of these hIgG products have entered into human clinical trials [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . Building upon this Tc bovine platform, we recently initiated efforts to establish a Tc goat (Capra aegagrus hircus) system to produce hIgG in smaller ungulates. Development of a Tc system in a small ungulate species such as the goat is better suited for producing smaller volumes of hIgG for certain applications, including using hIgG as diagnostic reagents for serological testing of emerging diseases and as therapeutics for spotty outbreaks of infectious diseases and/or personalized therapeutic hIgG products targeting specific diseases. Goats also offer the advantages of having a shorter gestation period and growing to adult size much faster than larger ungulates, decreasing the time for herd development at much lower costs. Furthermore, because large numbers of Tc goats can be quickly produced, plasma from sufficient numbers of animals can be included in plasma pooling strategies to ensure a greater lot to lot consistency.",

Here, we report that the produced Tc caprine expresses hIgG in the PBMCs and sera. We also further demonstrated that, with a H7N9 influenza A immunization study, the Tc caprine can be hyperimmunized and respond well to a pathogen of choice to produce pathogen-specific hIgG in the serum.

Previously, we engineered a HAC, named isKcHAC\u2206, that comprises the entire human Ig genetic repertoire in the germline configuration in which the regulatory genomic sequences involved in pre-B cell receptor (preBCR) and BCR signaling during B cell development and those mediating human Ig class switch recombination are replaced with the respective genomic sequences from an ungulate (bovine) 6 . We have demonstrated in the Tc bovine system that the ungulate regulatory sequences engineered into the HAC allows high levels of hIgG expression and a hIgG subclass distribution with IgG1 dominancy, closely mimicking hIgG expression in humans 6 . We reasoned that these ungulate regulatory elements, due to their high similarity in sequence among ungulates, may also render the HAC to function well in Tc goats. Based on this rationale, we established single cell-derived Tc goat fibroblast cell colonies by transferring the isKcHAC\u2206 into goat fetal fibroblast cells via microcell-mediated chromosome transfer (MMCT) and used the produced Tc goat fibroblasts as nuclear donors for Tc goat production by SCNT. In total, 194 cloned embryos were generated using five isK-cHAC\u2206 containing fetal fibroblast colonies and were transferred into 14 estrus-synchronized does ( Table 1) .",

We concluded that the HAC confers the Tc goat with the capability of generating antigen-specific hIgG response to antigen challenges. We then conducted virus neutralization assays to investigate the potency of purified hIgG against H7N9 viruses. We demonstrated that hIgG purified from the H7N9 immunized Tc goat had high neutralization titer activity against H7N9 virus (Table 3 ).

For certain biomedical applications, such as for serological testing and as therapeutics for small patient populations, it is more desirable to produce smaller volumes of hIgG products. It is also highly desirable to have the capability of swiftly establishing a Tc animal heard for therapeutic hIgG production in responding to sudden outbreaks of infectious diseases. In this regard, the goat offers the advantages of having a much shorter reproductive cycle and physical maturation time than larger ungulates. Furthermore, in addition to allowing plasma pooling strategies to be employed from a large number of Tc animals for greater lot to lot consistency, each of the Tc goats can be used for producing personalized-therapeutics at an affordable cost.",

However, this is only the first step in our efforts to fully establish the Tc goat system: because the goat endogenous Ig genes are still intact in the Tc caprine reported here, it is most likely that, as demonstrated in Tc bovine 3 , the endogenous goat Ig genes are predominantly expressed over the human Ig genes in goat B cells. The competition between goat Ig genes and human Ig genes would severely suppress the expression of human Ig genes leading to low level expressions of hIgG, a phenomenon that we have observed in the Tc bovine system when the bovine Ig genes are intact 3 ; in addition, the expression of endogenous goat Ig genes may also lead to the formation of chimeric antibodies-in certain percentages of the produced antibodies, the light chains are of goat origin while the heavy chains are of human origin, or vice versa. To address these issues, we have initiated the efforts to genetically inactivate the goat Ig genes to greatly enhance the production of hIgG in the Tc goat system and to prevent chimeric antibody production, a strategy that has proven effective in Tc bovine 16 . We have recently knocked out the goat Ig heavy chain, lambda light chain, and kappa light chain genes (triple knockout) in the same goat primary fibroblast cells. These triple knockout cell lines are being used for Tc goat production. Our goal is to achieve a hIgG production level in the Tc goat system comparable to the goat IgG levels in wild type goats 17 , an objective that has been achieved in the Tc bovine system. To test if the Tc caprine is fully fertile, we recently bred it with a wild type ram, and as the time of submitting this report, the Tc caprine was detected pregnant (with two live fetuses) by ultrasound at a gestation stage of about day 50. As normal fertility of Tc goats is important for quickly expanding a Tc herd, the success of this Tc goat in establishing pregnancy is encouraging, even though we are still awaiting the outcome at full term of the pregnancy. Tc goats can be hyperimmunized multiple times with vaccines containing strong adjuvants and/or immune stimulators, leading to the production of highly potent neutralizing hIgG against any pathogen of choice. Because a large herd of Tc goats can be produced quickly, the Tc caprine system can provide patients with hIgG products that are highly potent and safe at low cost. Our immunization studies with H7N9 followed by functional characterizations of the H7N9-specific hIgG elicited from the Tc caprine have demonstrated the proof of concept of this novel Tc caprine system for such therapeutic applications. It is also our intention that hIgG products produced from hyperimmunized Tc goats will be used as diagnostic reagents where human antibodies are desirable.",

We also demonstrated that the Tc goat can be hyperimmunized with a pathogen of choice to elicit high titers of pathogen-specific hIgG (see Fig. 4 and Table 3 ). Therefore, the Tc goat system may provide a novel solution to the production of target-specific and high titer human antibodies for both therapeutic and diagnostic applications.",

It was amplified using 15RI-HA1-F (TCTTGCACTTGTCACGAATTCGGATAAGATTTGTCTGGGCCATCATGCTGTGA) and 15SA-HA1-R (TGTGTGAGTTTTGTCTCTCCCCTTTGGAATCTCGGGCACAT) to generate the fragment for the human Fc (hFc) vector (pFUSEss-CHIg-hG1 expression vector (InvivoGen, Inc.) and 15RV-HA1-F (CT TGTCACGAAT TCGGATAAGAT T TGTCTGGGCCATCATGCTGTGA) and 15Bg-HA1-R (GCACGTGGGCTTGCTTCTCCCCTTTGGAATCTCGGGCACAT) for the rabbit Fc (rFc) expression vector, pFUSE-rIgG-Fc2 (IL2ss) (InvivoGen, Inc. pfuse-rfc2). PCR cloning was conducted using the CLONEZ system (Genescript L00339) and Subcloning Efficiency \u2122 DH5a \u2122 Competent Cells (Invitrogen 18265-017) for both vectors.Transient expression of the recombinant H7N9 HA1-hFc or H7N9 HA1-rFc was accomplished using the Expi293F \u2122 Cells (Life Technologies A14527) and the ExpiFectamine \u2122 293 Transfection Kit (Life Technologies A14524) following their standard protocol. After 6 days the supernatant was centrifuged at 3,200 rpm for 5 min and filtered (EMD Millipore S2GPU05RE) prior to purification. The recombinant H7N9 HA1-hFc or H7N9 HA1-rFc was purified through protein A column. The recombinant H7N9 HA1-hFc was use as the antigen for Tc goat vaccinations. The recombinant H7N9 HA1-rFc was used as coating antigen for H7N9 HA1-specific human IgG ELISA. goat H7N9 immunization. Tc goat was immunized four times with 3-week intervals. The BPL-inactivated H7N9 virus (Influenza A/Anhui/1/2013 H7N9) formulated with SAB-adj-2 was given to Tc goat via intradermal (i/d) injection for the first vaccination at 0.25 mg per dose and the second vaccination at 0.5 mg per dose. Then the recombinant H7N9 HA1-hFc (0.6 mg HA1 per dose) formulated with SAB-adj-1 was given to Tc goat via intramuscular injection for the third and fourth vaccinations. Forty ml of serum per collection was collected from immunized Tc goat on day 8 and day 15 after the fourth vaccination for antibody purification.",
