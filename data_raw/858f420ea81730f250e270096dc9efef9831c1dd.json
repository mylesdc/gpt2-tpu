This study presents the molecular characterization of chicken astrovirus (CAstV), PL/G059/2014, which is involved in the induction of ''white chicks'' condition. The 7382-nucleotidelong genome sequence was determined by next-generation sequencing using an Illumina MiSeq System. Phylogenetic analysis showed that it has the characteristics that are typical of avian astroviruses. However, overall degree of nucleotide sequence identity was 43.6 % to 73.7 % between PL/G059/2014 and other available genome sequences of aAstV strains. The amino acid sequences of the proteins encoded by ORF1a and ORF1b of the studied strain were very similar (86.5-93.8 % identity) to those of CAstVs 4175 and GA2011, but they were only 32.7-35.2 % identical in the case of ORF2, which is used officially for astrovirus species demarcation. These features could suggest that the PL/G059/2014 strain should be assigned to a new species in the genus Avastrovirus. Moreover, the different phylogenetic topology of PL/G059/ 2014 and its nucleotide sequence similarity in different genomic regions could suggest that a recombination event occurred during its evolution and that it has ancestors in common with duck astroviruses.",

We sequenced a nearly fulllength genome of the viral isolate PL/G059/2014 at the commercial service Genomed Sp. z o.o. (Poland).

The nearly complete genome sequence contained a partial 5 0 untranslated region (UTR) (nt 1-7, positions 15-21 of the reference GA2011 sequence), and 3 0 UTR (nt 7156-7382, positions 7315-7521 of the reference GA2011 sequence). Examination of the first nucleotides of the virus revealed the presence of two in-frame AUG codons of ORF1a, beginning at position 8 and 20, respectively (GCGATGGCC CAGGCCATGG8-23), both with the strongest positive effects on translation. ORF1a is 3427 nt long and encodes a polypeptide of 1139 amino acids (aa) with a calculated M r of 129.77 kDa. As in the case with other astroviruses, there is an overlap region between ORF1a and ORF1b (nt 3409 to 3427), which contains the heptameric frameshift sequence AAAAAAC (nt 3418-3424) known as RFS (ribosomal frameshift signal). ORF1b is 1559 nt long and encodes a polypeptide of 519 aa with a calculated M r of 60.41 kDa. As is typical for astroviruses, a 24-nt spacer between the stop codon of ORF1b and the start codon of ORF2 with a highly conserved CCGAA pentamer at positions 4980-4984 is also present. ORF2 is 2162 nt long and encodes a capsid protein precursor of 720 aa with a calculated M r of 80.01 kDa. Rfam analysis of (http://rfam.xfam.org) revealed the presence of a highly conserved coronavirus 3 0 stem-loop-II-like motif (s2m) consisting of 23 nt of ORF and the adjacent 18 nt of the 3 0 UTR (7136-7178). The exact role of s2m remains obscure, but recently, it was described as genetic element that, through an RNA-interference-like mechanism, influences gene expression in the infected organism, providing some kind of selective advantage for the virus [21] .",

The amino acid sequences of ORF1a and ORF1b of PL/G059/ 2014 shared the highest identities of 86.5 % to 93.8 % with the published sequences of CAstVs GA2011 and 4175 as well (Table 1) . However, the aa sequence similarity of ORF2 to these chicken astrovirus strains was rather low, at the level of 32.7-35.2 %. The PL/G059/2014 strain had the highest ORF2 aa sequence identity to P22-18.8.00 and VF08-36 strains, and it ranged between 80.8 % and 82.1 %. The next astrovirus strains with similarity to PL/ G059/2014 were DAstV-2 strains (representative SL5 in Table 1 ), with 49.4 % nucleotide sequence identity. In turn, the studied strains showed the lowest similarity, at the level of 20.3 %, to astroviruses detected in wild aquatic birds in Cambodia and Hong Kong [5] .",

The ORF1a of PL/G059/2014 was most closely related to that of DAstV-1; and ORF1b, to that of DAstV-3. This situation was also observed in ORF1a and ORF1b of other CAstV strains, GA2011 and 4175. However, in the case of these two CastV strains, similarity of ORF2 to that of DastV-3 was also observed. Surprisingly, the ORF2 of PL/G059/ 2014 was more closely related to a duck astroviruses, DastV-2. This may suggest that the nonstructural and structural protein genes of the PL/G059/2014 came from three different ancestor astroviruses, all hosted by ducks. A recombination event between astroviruses with different hosts of origin as one of the main mechanisms of virus evolution was previously suggested [11, 13, 19, 23] . Taking into consideration that many different avastroviruses have recently been detected in ducks and that their genomes showed phylogenetic relationships to poultry astroviruses, it seems probable that ducks may play an important role in the epidemiology of astrovirus, similar to the case with avian influenza virus [1] .",

On the other hand, the p-dist values with chicken astroviruses GA2011 and 4175 were 0.613-0.644, but only 0.178-0.192 with CAstVs P22-18.8.00 and VF08-36 (Table 2 ). These p-dist values are even lower condition. With regard to ORF2 protein structure, the most closely phylogenetically related strains were European CAstV strains that are responsible for enteric and respiratory problems in chickens, as well as hatchability issues [2, 18, 22] . We detected some differences in the capsid protein sequences of these strains, but their implications for pathogenicity are unknown. To investigate this question, whole astrovirus genome sequences should be compared, but they are currently unavailable. However, it should be remembered that pathogenicity could be influenced by the dose and route of inoculation, age and breed of chickens, level of maternally derived or acquired antibodies, and coinfection with other pathogens. For these reasons, conclusions about the pathogenicity of the virus based on their genome sequences should be made with caution.",

Based on the criteria for species demarcation recommended recently by the ICTV, the virus should be classified as a member of a new species within the genus Avastrovirus. Its genomic similarity to different astroviruses supports the previous suggestion that recombination events have played a role in the evolution of astroviruses. The data presented here also suggest a need for redefinition of taxonomic classification criteria for avastroviruses. P22-18.8.00 JN582318 n/a n/a n/a 80.8 VF08-36 JN582325 n/a n/a n/a 82.1",
