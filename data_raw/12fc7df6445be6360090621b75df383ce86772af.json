The goal of this study is to investigate the in vivo and in vitro inhibitory effect of cinnamon water extract (CWE) on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 and its underlying intracellular mechanisms. Methods: CWE was orally administrated to mice for 6 days prior to intraperitoneal injection of LPS. Serum levels of TNF-\u03b1 and interleukin (IL)-6 were determined 1 hour after LPS stimulation. Peritoneal macrophages from thioglycollate-injected mice were isolated and assayed for viability, cytokine expression and signaling molecules upon LPS stimulation. CWE was further fractioned according to molecular size, and the levels of total polyphenols and biological activities of each fraction were measured. Results: The oral administration of CWE to mice significantly decreased the serum levels of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6. CWE treatment in vitro decreased the mRNA expression of TNF-\u03b1. CWE blocked the LPS-induced degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1 as well as the activation of JNK, p38 and ERK1/2. Furthermore, size-based fractionation of CWE showed that the observed inhibitory effect of CWE in vitro occurred in the fraction containing the highest level of total polyphenols.",

Accordingly, extensive studies on the pharmacological activities of the cinnamon bark have been conducted, indicating that cinnamon bark is involved in a vast range of pathological and physiological events. For instance, essential oil and water-based extracts from cinnamon have been shown to be effective against pathogenic microbes, viruses, and various types of tumor cell lines [1] [2] [3] [4] . Furthermore, it has been also reported that cinnamon bark reduces the level of serum glucose through the enhancement of insulin-regulated glucose utilization in vivo [5, 6] .",

Since proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factoralpha(TNF-\u03b1), interleukin(IL)-1 and IL-6, lipid mediators, proteases, and oxidants produced during the typical response can cause damage to normal tissues regardless of how and where the inflammatory response is triggered, the substances involved in the inflammatory response need to be tightly regulated. If the scavenging reaction is delayed, the inflammatory response may evolve into a variety of chronic inflammatory diseases, such as atherosclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, and neurodegenerative diseases. A vast number of molecular studies have identified several target molecules involved in inflammatory changes, and most anti-inflammatory drugs currently used suppress the biosynthesis of the inflammatory mediators mentioned earlier [8] .",

However, since cinnamon bark has been typically used as in the form of a water extract, where the volatile ingredients are seldom found, it is likely that the established pharmacological activities of cinnamon bark depend on a mixture comprised of a variety of water-soluble components, thereby ensuring its safety as a traditional remedy. Recently, it has been found that cinnamon bark water extract (CWE) elevates glucose uptake through the promotion of insulin sensitivity and inhibits angiogenesis through blocking vascular endothelial growth factor 2 signaling [12, 13] . These results indicate that the observed pharmacological activities may have originated from polyphenolic compounds in CWE.",

For size fractionation, 1.28 g of CWE was dissolved in 30 ml of distilled water and fractions were collected using 3 kDa and 10kDa Amicon Ultra Centrifugal Filter device (Millipore, Ireland). The yields of a low molecular weight (MW) fraction (below 3 kDa), a middle MW fraction (between 3 kDa and 10 kDa), and a high MW fraction (over 10 kDa) were 60%, 15% and 25% of CWE, respectively.

            "text": "LPS is an endotoxin originating from the cell walls of gram-negative bacteria, which stimulates the expression of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 in monocytes and macrophages. These cytokines provide protective effects for the body by inducing blood clotting, leukocyte recruitment and activation of adaptive immunity, but a large quantity of such cytokines in serum results in provoking disseminated intravascular coagulation, multiple organ failure or septic shock [15] . First, we tested whether CWE treatment affects systemic inflammatory response to LPS stimulation. To this end, CWE was orally administrated to mice for 6 days before intraperitoneal injection of LPS and the release of serum TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 was measured by ELISA. Based on our previous study, doses of 20, 100, and 500 mg/kg were chosen for oral administration [16] . Dexamethasone was used as a reference drug to compare the suppressive activity of CWE in the presence of LPS. Serum levels of TNF-\u03b1 were significantly reduced with the 20 and 100 mg/kg doses, while a higher dose (500 mg/kg) showed a lesser reduction than the lower dose points and was not statistical significant ( Figure 1 ). This pattern was observed in our previous work in which a dose-dependent reduction in serum IFN-\u03b3 occurred only between 20-200 mg/kg of CWE [16] . In the case of IL-6, a dose-dependent decrease occurred in the 20 and 100 mg/kg dosage groups although the latter group reached statistical significance. The 500 mg/kg group showed a higher level of IL-6 than the control group. It seems that unidentified compounds beyond a critical level may interfere with the antiinflammatory components of CWE.",

Concentrations of CWE up to 400 \u03bcg/ml was not cytotoxic to peritoneal macrophages treated with or without LPS (Figure 2 ). Many herbal water extracts contain polysaccharides, which induce the secretion of TNF-\u03b1 in non-stimulated macrophages in vitro [17] . We found that treatment with CWE alone ranging from 10 to 100 \u03bcg/ml stimulated the release of TNF-\u03b1 into media in a concentration-dependent manner ( Figure 3A ). Such phenomenon must be due to the presence of water soluble polysaccharides in CWE. Subsequently, we examined the effects of CWE on Figure 4 In vitro effect of CWE on LPS-induced I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation and MAP kinase activation. Peritoneal macrophages were pretreated with the indicated concentration of CWE for 1 h and then stimulated with LPS for 15 min.

We tested the effect of CWE on I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation 15 min after LPS stimulation. A time course study of I\u03baB\u03b1 activity in LPS-stimulated macrophages shows that phosphorylation of I\u03baB\u03b1 reaches its peak at 5 min after LPS stimulation and then disappears at 15 min while a complete degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1 occurs within 15 min [19] . As expected, an almost complete loss of phospho-I\u03baB\u03b1 as well as I\u03baB\u03b1 was identified in macrophages treated with LPS alone (Figure 4 ). CWE at doses of 50 and 100 \u03bcg/ml inhibited I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation, although phospho-I\u03baB\u03b1 was still detected. Phosphorylation of IKK was not affected. These results strongly indicate that the inhibitory effect of CWE on NF-\u03baB signaling may occur downstream of the phosphorylation of I\u03baB\u03b1.",

Since the insulin-like and antioxidant activities of CWE originate from polyphenolic compounds, we wanted to determine the polyphenol content in these fractions [12] . As shown in Table 1 , the highest concentration of total polyphenols was observed in the high MW fraction, being more than ten-fold than that of the low or middle MW fraction. Next, based on the fraction yield ratio relative to the total CWE, 120 \u03bcg/ml, 30 \u03bcg/ml and 50 \u03bcg/ml of the low, middle and high MW fractions were added to macrophages and their effects on signaling molecules were examined. Suppression of the degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1 and phosphorylation of JNK, p38 and ERK 1/2 was detected only in cells treated with the high MW fraction ( Figure 5 ).
