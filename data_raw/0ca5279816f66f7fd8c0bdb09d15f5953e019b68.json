Compare the effects of three sampling methods on the microbiological monitoring results a er reprocessing of gastrointestinal endoscopes, providing scientific basis for improving the monitoring quality of gastrointestinal endoscope cleaning and disinfection. Method. Gastrointestinal endoscopes a er reprocessing were selected randomly at the gastrointestinal endoscopy center of a tertiary hospital in Shanghai from October 2018 to February 2019. e endoscopes selected were all sampled in three different methods under continuous sampling and intermittent sampling respectively. Methods used includes, the biopsy channel group (Group A), the entire channel group (Group B), and the disc brush group (Group C). en the colony forming units (CFU/piece) were counted in the laboratory. Results. A total of 12 endoscopes were sampled by using continuous sampling approach, in which the detection rate of bacteria in disc brush group (33.3%) and entire channel group (33.3%) was higher than biopsy channel group (8.3%). Among the 12 endoscopes sampled with intermittent approach, the detection rate of bacteria from high to low was the disc brush group (50%), the entire channel group (41.7%), and the biopsy channel group (8.3%). Conclusion. Different sampling methods will lead to the difference of microbiological culture results a er reprocessing of gastrointestinal endoscope, indicating that the improved sampling method is beneficial to objectively reflect the endoscope cleaning and disinfection effect, and improve the monitoring quality of endoscope disinfection.",

            "text": "In recent years, flexible endoscope reprocessing failure has been listed in the \"Top 10 Health Technology Hazards\" issued annually by the Emergency Care Research Institute (ECRI) for five consecutive years and even ranked the top one of the list in the year 2016. With the continuous advancement of gastrointestinal endoscopy technology, new endoscopic technique may bring new medical risks and medical technique hazards while improving medical quality and patient safety. According to the report, from 1996 to 2015, among 1389 cases of patients under duodenoscopy procedures in Europe, 32 cases were found of being infected with multidrug resistant Escherichia coli due to the failure of endoscopic reprocessing [1] ; from October 3, 2014, to January 28, 2015, patients from UCLA Medical Center died of Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacter (CRE) infections obtained from contaminated endoscopy; in 2015, 186 patients were infected with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome due to endoscopic reprocessing failure, of which 19.4% died [2] . As per the data from the American Journal of Infection Control, 2018, endoscopes a er reprocessing, including gastroendoscope, intestinal endoscope, duodenal endoscope, ultrasound endoscope, etc., the bacterial positive rate ranges from 60% to 92% [3] , and in China from 2007 to 2012, the qualification rate a er reprocessing of gastrointestinal endoscopes was only 80.8% [4] . Accordingly, the quality of the gastrointestinal endoscopic reprocessing is not stable, and scientific and objective monitoring is urgently needed. Meanwhile, more and more domestic and international guidelines emphasize the importance of endoscope microbial monitoring. e microbiological monitoring can evaluate the effect and quality of endoscopic reprocessing, and is beneficial to identify sources of contamination, correct cleaning, and disinfection methods, and thus preventing the spread of nosocomial infections It is mentioned in the guidelines from Europe, Australia, and New Zealand [5] . For microbiological sampling of gastrointestinal endoscope, the APIC (Association for Professionals in Infection Control Epidemiology, 2000) recommends sampling the suction and biopsy channel as well as the air-water channel in a flushing method; the ESGE-ESGENA (European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy and European Society of Gastroenterology and Endoscopy Nurses and Associates, 2008), Canada (2010) sets the rule that the endoscopes should be sampled with entire channel by antegrade flushing method. e GESA-GENCA (Gastroenterological Society of Australia and Gastroenterological Nurses College of Australia, 2010) recommends to sample the entire channel of endoscopes with the sequence of flush-brush-flush method in both antegrade and retrograde manner, and the UMCG (University Medical Center Groningen, 2011) suggests the sampling by retrograde rinsing of endoscopic suction biopsy and air-water channel [6] . In order to improve the detection rate of endoscopic microbial contamination a er reprocessing, and to more objectively evaluate the effect of endoscopic reprocessing, the Ministry of Health of China has issued the national standard for endoscope cleaning and disinfection since 2004, established the requirement of sample frequency, channel should be sampled and fluid volume of samples. In 2016, newly issued \"Regulation for cleaning and disinfection technique of flexible endoscope WS 507-2016\" [7] updates and supplements bunches of quality control methods and details of endoscope cleaning and disinfection. e regulation emphasized the entire channel sample method, using 50 ml instead of 20 ml of eluate containing neutralizer, it also emphasized the total collection method, as well as bacteria culture by filter membrane method to improve the elution effect and detection efficiency. However, there are wide difference on sampling sites, sampling methods, and frequency, as well as evaluation indicators between different international guidelines [8] . It becomes an urgent problem and needs to be tackled on how to conduct a microbiological monitoring examination more scientifically, reasonably, and regularly.",

As a reusable medical device that directly contacts with the mucosa of a patient's organs, high-level disinfection, or sterilization must be achieved before use. However, studies have shown that even if the endoscope and accessories are treated strictly in accordance with guideline recommended for cleaning and disinfection methods, endoscopic associated infections are still possible to happen [8] , so we believe that no matter the method of cleaning and disinfection, the effect must be verified to ensure the disinfection effect as well as patients' safety. At present, microbiology culture is an important way to evaluate the quality of the endoscope cleaning and disinfection [9] .",

In the endoscopic microbiology sampling method of our study, the entire channel group sampling was to inject the neutralizer from the instrument port beside the endoscope light guiding connector, and seal the suction port, the air/water injection port and the instrument port of the endoscope control section with the washing joint, and then collect the elution from the distal end of the endoscope. e path taken by the instrument channel sampling group is the same as the brush sampling group. e single biopsy channel was lacking the sampling of the suction channel compared with the entire channel group. However, the disc brush sampling method can brush and wash the inner surface of the endoscope lumen when compared with the simple flushing method of washing off the attachment from the inner surface of lumen. It has been shown that brush sampling method could scrub the endoscope channel and remove separately the new and old contaminants from endoscope channel [16] . It can be seen that the entire channel sampling method is more comprehensive, avoiding the limitations of the other two methods, and the disc brush sampling method could fully scrub the inner wall of the lumen, loosening and washing off the attachments, which might more effectively improve the detection rate of bacteria of endoscopes, but it may also require more staff cooperation between operators. e details, such as the type of brush, type of endoscope, the frequency of brushing practice etc. may need further research in the future [17] .",
