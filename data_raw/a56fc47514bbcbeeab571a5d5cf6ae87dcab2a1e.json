We imputed BovineHD genotypes to whole genome sequence for 2703 Holsteins that were cases or controls for Bovine Respiratory Disease and sampled from either California or New Mexico to construct and compare genomic prediction models. The sequence variation reference dataset comprised variants called for 1578 animals from Run 5 of the 1000 Bull Genomes Project, including 450 Holsteins and 29 animals sequenced from this study population. Genotypes for 9,282,726 variants with minor allele frequencies \u22655% were imputed and used to obtain genomic predictions in GEMMA using a Bayesian Sparse Linear Mixed Model. Results: Variation explained by markers increased from 13.6% using BovineHD data to 14.4% using imputed whole genome sequence data and the resolution of genomic regions detected as harbouring QTL substantially increased. Explained variation in the analysis of the combined California and New Mexico data was less than when data for each state were separately analysed and the estimated genetic correlation between risk of Bovine Respiratory Disease in California and New Mexico Holsteins was \u2212 0.36. Consequently, genomic predictions trained using the data from one state did not accurately predict disease risk in the other state. To determine if a prediction model could be developed with utility in both states, we selected variants within genomic regions harbouring: 1) genes involved in the normal immune response to infection by pathogens responsible for Bovine Respiratory Disease detected by RNA-Seq analysis, and/or 2) QTL identified in the association analysis of the imputed sequence variants. The model based on QTL selected variants is biased but when trained in one state generated BRD risk predictions with positive accuracies in the other state.",

Genetic heterogeneity between populations occurs when sick animals display the same clinical signs, but these signs are caused by infections involving different pathogens that elicit potentially different immune responses. When this occurs, mutations in different genes and regulatory elements may lead to susceptibility to different pathogens which also differ in their prevalence across environments, leading to an apparent genotype-by-environment interaction for risk of BRD. When this is the case, the genetic correlation between risk of BRD in the different environments will be substantially less than one and integrating data for animals from different environments will result in the identification of QTL or production of GP that have a reduced pathogen specificity. This approach will therefore tend to reduce the ability to identify variants with pathogen-specific effects on risk of BRD. Considering the cost and difficulty of creating GP training populations representing the range of U.S. cattle production environments, it is imperative that we fully leverage existing disease status data. We attempted to utilize different data types to enhance our biological understanding of BRD and better understand the genetic architecture of disease risk within and across regions.",

In the second approach, we examined the effects of reducing the number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from the WGS imputation set that were included in the GP model to sets selected based upon a genome-wide association (GWAS) analysis of these data and a previous RNA-Seq analysis. We included SNPs located within genomic regions found to harbour QTL of large effect on risk of BRD, or SNPs located within genomic regions previously found to harbour genes involved in the normal immune response to infection by pathogens responsible for BRD based on RNA-Seq analysis [7] and the union of these two sets of variants. Recent studies have suggested the utility of incorporating ancillary information into the analysis to inform the selection of biologically relevant loci and reduce the challenge of estimating effects for several hundreds of thousands, or millions, of loci [8] [9] [10] [11] .",

The first approach uses a two-step data analysis in which the first phase estimates WGS variant effects and the second, feature selection step, retains only those SNPs that are located in large-effect QTL regions for the prediction of genetic merit. We recognise that this does not represent the use of independent data to identify QTL and that the estimated QTL effects are positively biased, which is commonly known as the \"Beavis effect\" (see [12] for an explanation). Consequently, the selection of SNPs in QTL regions detected in an analysis of the same data set is likely to result in a positive bias in the accuracy of GPs. We sought to quantify the magnitude of this bias by performing cross-validation analyses in which subsets of the data were used for QTL detection and the training of the prediction model which was then applied to an independent subset of the data for validation of prediction accuracy. The second approach utilized completely independent biological information to identify genomic regions harbouring genes involved in the normal immune response to infection by pathogens causing BRD and then selecting SNPs from the WGS variants located in these regions for the prediction of genetic merit.",

Comparing feature sets Surprisingly, only 8379 SNPs were in common between the QTL feature selected SNP set (1.6% of SNPs) and the RNA-Seq feature selected SNP set (2.7%). This may have been impacted by the relatively small window-size (transcript \u00b125 kb) selected for sampling SNPs in the vicinity of genes that were differentially regulated in the bronchial lymph node in response to pathogen challenge. However, as has been previously observed in human complex disease GWAS studies, the largest effect QTL are rarely found within transcripts and are much more frequently located in intergenic and upstream regions that are inferred to have regulatory effects. This is consistent with our results, which suggest that the largest effect BRD-risk QTL are generally not located within close proximity to genes involved in the immune response to pathogen challenge, suggesting that these QTL must have regulatory roles on gene expression. This, of course, does not preclude certain variants within these transcripts from underlying QTL, but these QTL have too small an effect to have been detected in the GWAS of 2703 animals.",

While this approach is not by itself capable of inferring the causality of any associated variant, the biological relevance of genes, particularly those differentially expressed in response to pathogen infection suggests the utility of using imputed WGS data for refining the numbers of variants that potentially may be causal for their effects on risk of disease. Imputation also enabled the identification of relatively small regions, which could be targeted for further fine mapping using variants missing from the 1KBGP data and indels. This approach could also benefit from the identification of regulatory regions within the QTL regions and specifically targeting the genotyping of variants within regulatory regions located within QTL.

The possibility of a large systematic bias in phenotyping between the regions is also highly unlikely considering the objective nature of the McGuirk scoring system and the fact that these data were collected by trained veterinary personnel [4] . Pathogen diagnostic data obtained from mid-nasal and deep-nasopharyngeal swabs taken from each calf made it clear that there were very different pathogen profiles present in the two state cohorts, and consequently, disease status classification must be interpreted from the perspective of the pathogens to which the animals were exposed in each environment (Fig. 6) .",

PPARG is a transcription factor that has been shown to mediate immune responses in a pathogen-specific manner. In human Coronavirus respiratory infections, expression of PPARG is crucial for preventing a persistent infection [20] . Host PPARG variants have also been found to provide resistance to infection by some, but not all, Hepatitis C virus strains [21] . The allele frequencies at imputed WGS variants in the vicinity of PPARG (chr22:57,366,988-57,413,013 bp) were similar for the animals in the two state cohorts which would be expected if similar sires are selected nationwide based upon their Net Merit PTA.

Our intention was to enrich the prediction model for variants that were more likely to be trait associated and to reduce the noise in the prediction model created by the estimation of a multitude of SNP effects for variants that are not trait associated. Feature selection reduced the number of variants used in prediction by an order of magnitude relative to the imputed WGS training data, and to a level comparable to the HD training data.

Alternatively, a national genetic evaluation could focus selection on the variants that influencing risk of disease in a pathogen agnostic manner. The feature selection approaches implemented here targeted the latter goal, but did not specifically attempt to functionally validate or elucidate the biology associated with variation within the selected genomic regions. For example, a QTL may be specific to an individual pathogen that is present in both regional cohorts or may be specific to all bacterial or viral pathogens that cause BRD. This level of refinement in our understanding of BRD will require considerably more data aggregation, improved mapping resolution and biological experimentation. Selection without regard to these potential GxE effects will be effective only if the heritability of disease risk across all environments is moderate or the pathogen profiles within specific regions of the country remain stable in time. Indeed, this may explain why BRD has been persistent despite the considerable cost associated with animal infection.",

            "text": "The potential benefit of high accuracy imputation lies in capturing genetic variation that is missed due to low LD with the common variants on the currently available genotyping assays. Given the abundance of rare variation in the cattle genome, many functional variants will not be in strong LD with these common variants. Reliance on LD and allele phase relationships between chip-based markers and causal variants, which are population specific, explains why GP models frequently fail to be translatable across populations [16] . Accurate WGS imputation may address this issue, however, this appears to be difficult to accomplish if we the imputation process requires strong LD between typed and untyped markers [26] . However, current imputation algorithms generally exploit a haplotype matching strategy which can accurately impute common haplotypes. Despite the relatively small effective population size, there is abundant variation within Holsteins. However, this variation resides on a relatively small number of haplotypes which enables the majority of common haplotypes to be captured by sequencing only a few hundred animals [6] .",

However, the accuracy and large number of called WGS variants and relatively small number of sequenced individuals all impact the accuracy of imputation. One approach towards the amelioration of this issue is to assign annotations to classes of variants, and then fit classes separately in a mixture model of normal distributions with different scale parameters. If a class, such as variants within transcripts found to be trait-associated in an RNA-Seq study, is enriched for alleles that directly cause trait variation, the power to detect these causal variants should be improved by increasing the prior likelihood of association for members of this class. Such an approach is implemented in BayesRC [8] . To the extent that annotations and genotype imputation can be accomplished at high levels of accuracy, this approach should be beneficial for variant selection for GP. However, at present, both variant annotation and imputation are limited in extent and accuracy, and rather than restricting inclusion to specific variants, we defined sets of genomic regions (based on windows of SNPs) of interest and included all variants within these windows. Once the windows had been defined, the Bayesian Sparse Linear Mixed Model (BSLMM) [35] implemented in GEMMA had no additional information about which of the variants within each window may be important. BSLMM assumes that only a small proportion of the supplied variants have large effects that contribute to variation in the phenotype and estimates which of the supplied variants have large effects, the magnitudes of these effects and the residual additive genetic merit of each individual due to the remaining small effect variants. Within each feature selected window, if a causal variant acted by disrupting an enhancer, for example, BSLMM would be expected to identify this variant as a large effect variant. BSLMM would also identify other loci in strong LD with the causal variant and sampling effects could lead to some of these having stronger associations than the causal variant.",

We hypothesized that imputation of HD genotypes to WGS variants in conjunction with biologically guided feature selection may enable the development of genomic prediction models in Holstein cattle with utility across geographic regions. While the genome sequence resources for WGS imputation and the annotation of identified genomic variants in cattle are limited, the continued improvement of these resources should enable this development.

Fixed effects of sex and age were included as covariates within the analyses of the binary case-control disease phenotype data for each state, and a fixed effect for state was included in the model for the analysis of the combined CA + NM data. The model also included a random effect for the additive genetic merit of each animal and a random residual term that contained residual additive genetic effects that are not in complete linkage disequilibrium with the markers included in the model [40] and nonadditive genetic, permanent and temporary environmental effects. The GRM was constructed using a random sample of 10% (N = 928,258) of the genomic sites represented in the imputed WGS genotype data approximately consistent with number of SNPs present on the HD assay. For the analyses of the HD genotype data all SNPs were used to form the GRM. We also estimated the genetic correlation between the binary case-control BRD variables in CA and NM using GCTA by fitting a bivariate model.",
