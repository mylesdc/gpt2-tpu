We followed previous authors and reasoned that variation in detection probability of disease events would be primarily determined by \"search effort\"; namely, the extent to which disease events have been looked for. 1,2 Since search effort is difficult to estimate directly for infectious diseases at a global scale, we further reasoned that search effort would be a function of \"reporting effort\", which is the extent to which disease events are \"reported\" to become part of the scientific literature. This is appropriate here since our observations of disease events are similarly drawn from the scientific literature.",

            "text": "Previous studies have similarly recognized this issue when modeling infectious disease occurrence, and various methods have been used to estimate the distribution of reporting effort. In certain cases, presence-only data may be supplemented with data on known sampling bias, or data from other planned sampling efforts. 3 A previous study using an earlier version of the dataset used in the present study used locations drawn from the Journal of Infectious Disease as a measure of reporting effort. 4 An index was created using the country of residence of every author from all JID articles since 1973. This country-level measure of reporting effort was then downscaled to match the spatial grid used in the analyses (~100 x 100km) and included as a covariate in a logistic regression model. Similarly, in their study of water-associated infectious disease events, Yang et al., (2012) searched PubMed for \"infectious disease\" and \"[country name]\" and recorded the yearly counts at the country level for 1991 through 2008 5 . In their spatial Poisson model, these country level publication count estimates were again downscaled to match the spatial grid used in their analyses and included as an offset. 5 In our analyses, we sought to improve on these methods by creating a better-than country level reporting effort dataset. Country-level measures of reporting effort may be limited as a correction for more fine-grain bias in the detection of disease events in people. Furthermore, in the case of Jones et al., (2008) , the country of residence of authors may not be a good proxy for the locations in which studies have actually occurred. To solve these issues, we adapted methods from ecology that are now routinely used when modeling species distributions from \"presence-only\" data.",

However, the same is not true for datasets involving only observations of an event (i.e., presence-only). In such circumstances, presence records are typically contrasted with randomly generated records, often termed \"background data\" or (somewhat misleadingly) \"pseudo-absence\" records. However, while it is reasonable to compare a distribution of observations against a random distribution, the set of \"background data\" provided to the model may innately differ from the covariate space of search effort, and this can cause poor model performance and/or spurious associations. 1-3 Weighting or stratifying background points by a proxy or estimate of detection probability can ameliorate this problem. By balancing the distribution of covariates in the background sample and a hypothetical null outcome sample, the divergence between those measured by the model should be due to the effect of interest. 1-31",
