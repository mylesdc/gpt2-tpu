            "text": "Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an insect borne virus (genus: Alphavirus) which causes acute febrile illness in humans followed by a prolonged arthralgic disease that affects the joints of the extremities. Re-emergence of the virus in the form of outbreaks in last 6-7 years has posed a serious public health problem. CHIKV has a positive sense single stranded RNA genome of about 12,000 nt. Open reading frame 1 of the viral genome encodes a polyprotein precursor, nsP1234, which is processed further into different non structural proteins (nsP1, nsP2, nsP3 and nsP4). Sequence based analyses have shown helicase domain at the N-terminus and protease domain at C-terminus of nsP2. A detailed biochemical analysis of NTPase/ RNA helicase and 59-RNA phosphatase activities of recombinant CHIKV-nsP2T protein (containing conserved NTPase/ helicase motifs in the N-terminus and partial papain like protease domain at the C-terminus) was carried out. The protein could hydrolyze all NTPs except dTTP and showed better efficiency for ATP, dATP, GTP and dGTP hydrolysis. ATP was the most preferred substrate by the enzyme. CHIKV-nsP2T also showed 59-triphosphatase (RTPase) activity that specifically removes the c-phosphate from the 59 end of RNA. Both NTPase and RTPase activities of the protein were completely dependent on Mg 2+ ions. RTPase activity was inhibited by ATP showing sharing of the binding motif by NTP and RNA. Both enzymatic activities were drastically reduced by mutations in the NTP binding motif (GKT) and co-factor, Mg 2+ ion binding motif (DEXX) suggesting that they have a common catalytic site.",

Prototype viruses like Sindbis Virus (SINV) and Semliki Forest Virus (SFV) of this family have been extensively studied. ORF1 encodes a polyprotein precursor termed as nsP1234 and processed into different non structural proteins (nsP1, nsP2, nsP3 and nsP4) after stepwise proteolytic cleavages. The 39-terminal one-third of the genome encodes for viral structural polyprotein which is expressed from a separate subgenomic mRNA and cleaved co-translationally and posttranslationally into structural proteins C, E1, E2 [1] . Alphavirus nsP4, the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and the processing intermediates or mature products of nsP123 are essential components of the viral RNA replication and transcription complexes [2] . Alphaviral nsP2 is a multifunctional protein [3, 4, 5, 6] . Nucleoside triphosphatase, helicase, and RNA-dependent 59-triphosphatase activities have been located in the N-terminus of the protein while the proteolytic domain has been mapped to its C-terminal part [3, 7] . It forms a papain-like thiol protease. The nsP2 protease is responsible for cleavages in the non-structural polyprotein [8;9] . CHIKV protease activity of nsP2 has been demonstrated [10] however enzymatic activities associated with N-terminus have not been shown as yet.",

One strand in each of the three RNA or DNA duplexes was 59-end labeled. Duplex unwinding assays were carried out at similar conditions which were optimized for the ATPase activity. There was no detectable strand displacement by CHIKV-nsP2T with any of the RNA/DNA duplexes with 1 nM protein/reaction ( Figure 4a ). Further, unwinding assays were carried out using different concentrations of the enzyme from 1 ng-1000 ng/reaction. There was no visible unwinding activity seen even at higher concentrations of enzyme in the reactions ( Figure 4b ).",

Following incubation with the CHIKV-nsP2T at 37uC for 30 min, products were analyzed by TLC. 59-[c-32 P]-RNA or 59-[a-32 P]-RNA substrates were separately incubated with shrimp alkaline phosphatase (SAP) to see the specificity of CHIKV-nsP2T for phosphate group at the 59-end of the RNA substrate. As expected, SAP could remove 32 P moiety from both RNA substrates, but CHIKV-nsP2T showed no release of label from 59-a-32 P-RNA. CHIKV-nsP2T released labeled 59-phosphate group from 59-c-32 P labeled RNA indicating that CHIKV-nsP2T hydrolyzes only c-b-triphosphate bond and unlike SAP does not have a general phosphohydrolase activity that would also remove the band aphosphate groups (Figure 5a ). This suggested that CHIKV-nsP2T has 59-RNA-triphosphatase (RTPase) activity. Extent of hydrolysis of both CHIKV 59-NCR and non specific RNA oligo substrates was comparable (Figure 5b) . Thus, for the further characterization of 59-RNA-triphosphatase activity, non-specific RNA substrate was used.",

Other possibility is that unwinding activity of CHIKV-nsP2 is dependent on the protease domain. Helicase motifs identified until now are actually characteristic of NTPdependent nucleic acid translocases which are capable of moving unidirectionally along a single or double stranded nucleic acid. Extra domains in addition to core enzyme (need not be from the same protein) may be necessary for conferring strand separation activity to the enzyme.

            "text": "Alphaviruses possess a novel RNA capping mechanism, where GTP is first methylated, forms a covalent m 7 GMP intermediate with nsP1and then gets transferred on to RNA resulting in G 0 cap structure. Methyltransferase and guanylyltransferase activities required to carry out these reactions have been demonstrated to be nsP1 associated [30] . There is prior step of removing 59 cphosphate of the nascent RNA and nsP2 has been identified as the RNA triphosphatase for both SFV and SINV [6] . On testing CHIKV-nsP2T for RNA 59-triphosphatase (RTPase) activity, it released 32 P only from the 59-[c-32 P] RNA and not from the 59-[a-32 P] RNA substrate showing specificity for the cbtriphosphate bond (Figure 5a ) confirming CHIKV-nsP2T having RTPase activity. Release of the 59-phosphate group from the nonspecific RNA oligonucleotide substrate and that from the CHIKV 59-NCR were equally efficient. This showed that CHIKV-nsP2T 59-RTPase has no sequence specificity for RNA substrates. RNA-59 triphosphatase activity of the mutant proteins showed significant inhibition (Figure 6c ) suggesting that the NTPase and RTPase activities shared a common reaction mechanism. The effective inhibition of RTPase with 0.1 mM ATP and not with ADP and AMP further confirmed that the enzyme binds by means of triphosphorylated nucleotide. In summary, CHIKV-nsP2T has both NTPase and RNA 59triphosphatase activities. It could hydrolyze all NTPs except dTTP and showed better efficiency for ATP, dATP, GTP and dGTP hydrolysis. ATP was the most preferred substrate by the enzyme. RTPase activity was completely inhibited by ATP showing sharing of the binding motif by NTP and RNA. NTPase and RTPase activities were completely dependent on Mg 2+ ions. Walker A and Walker B mutant proteins showed significant reduction in both enzymatic activities confirming sharing of functional domains for these activities. This is the first report showing CHIKV-nsP2 associated NTPase and RNA 59-triphosphatase activities. Considering importance of these functions during alphavirus replication, helicase could serve as a potential target for antivirals.",

A parallel purification of MBP was carried out from the empty vector transformed cells to obtain control fraction which was used to test absence of contaminating enzymatic activities from E.coli in the purified protein.

Elution of the protein was performed using binding buffer containing 10 mM Maltose (Sigma). Collected fractions were analyzed on 10% SDS-PAGE and fractions containing protein of the expected size were combined and concentrated by using Amicon membrane columns (cutoff, 50 kDa; Millipore). The protein was further purified by gel filtration chromatography (Sephacryl HR100, CV-120 ml; Amersham Biosciences) by using an Akta Basic 100 HPLC system (Amersham Pharmacia, USA). Fractions were analyzed on 10% SDS-PAGE. Fractions containing purified protein were combined, concentrated by using an Amicon membrane column and buffer was exchanged to 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.0).
