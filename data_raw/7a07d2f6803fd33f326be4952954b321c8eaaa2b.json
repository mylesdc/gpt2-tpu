They can be completed by responders to an outbreak, or by anyone interested in or following an outbreak using public or open source data, including news reports.",

There has been some person to person spread, including a family in Guandoing, and a single case which infected 14 health workers. One of the two cases in Vietnam also appears to be spread person-to-person from the index case in Vietnam. SARS was transmitted person-to-person, especially in the hospital setting.

Hospitals and the health system -both SARS and MERS CoV caused nosocomial outbreaks.
