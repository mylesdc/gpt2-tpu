In this study, which began in 2010, we surveyed EV-D68 in children with ARIs and analyzed sequences of EV-D68 strains detected. Real-time PCR of 19 respiratory viruses or subtypes of viruses, including enterovirus, was performed on 2,215 specimens from ARI patients (<10 years of age) collected between November 2010 and December 2015 in Osaka City, Japan. EV-D68 was identified in 18 enterovirus-positive specimens (n = 4 in 2013, n = 1 in 2014, and n = 13 in 2015) by analysis of viral protein 1 (VP1) or VP4 sequences, followed by a BLAST search for similar sequences. All EV-D68 strains were detected between June and October (summer to autumn), except for one strain detected in 2014. A phylogenetic analysis of available VP1 sequences revealed that the Osaka strains detected in 2010, 2013, and 2015 belonged to distinct clusters (Clades C, A, and B [Subclade B3], respectively). Comparison of the 5 0 untranslated regions of these viruses showed that Osaka strains in Clades A, B (Subclade B3), and C commonly had deletions at nucleotide positions 681-703 corresponding to the prototype Fermon strain. Clades B and C had deletions from nucleotide positions 713-724. Since the EV-D68 epidemic in 2010, EV-D68 re-emerged in Osaka City, Japan, in 2013 and 2015. Results of this study indicate that distinct clades of EV-D68 contributed to re-emergences of this virus in",

In addition, 310 respiratory specimens were collected from hospitals and clinics from April to December 2015 for cooperative research. Surveillance in Osaka City was part of a national surveillance program for viral infectious diseases in Japan based on the Infectious Diseases Control Law. Specimens, collected as part of a passive surveillance, were residues after clinical use in hospitals and clinics. Specimens were anonymized before testing in our public health laboratory. Sample collection, detection of pathogens, and analysis of detected pathogens were approved by domestic law without additional permissions. Specifically, informed consent is considered unnecessary by domestic law and according to ethical guidelines for epidemiological research. However, sample collection for the cooperative research, which was not considered virus surveillance, required both informed consent and ethics committee review. Therefore, written consent was obtained from parents and guardians of the children whose specimens were included in the study. This part of the study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan (no. 532). , and human rhinovirus, as described previously [18] . For enterovirus-positive specimens, the VP1 or VP4 region was amplified by conventional reverse transcription-PCR. VP1 was amplified by PCR using primers 224 (5 0 -GCIATGYTIGGIACICAY RT-3 0 ) and 222 (5 0 -CICCIGGIGGIAYRWACAT-3 0 ), followed by a nested PCR using primers AN89 (5 0 -CCAGCACTGACAGCAGYNGARAYNGG-3 0 ) and AN88 (5 0 -TACTGGACCACCTGGNGGNAYRWACAT-3 0 ) [19] . VP4 was amplified using primers OL68-1 (5 0 -GGTAAYTTCCACCACCANCC-3 0 ) and EVP4 (5 0 -CTACTTTGGGTGTCCGTG TT-3 0 ) [20] . PCR products were subjected to direct sequencing, and EV-D68 was identified by phylogenetic analysis.",

Other epidemiological data on EV-D68 in Japan, Yamagata Prefecture, showed an upsurge of EV-D68 between summer and autumn in 2005-2010 [12] . Based on the available data, summer through autumn is believed to be the EV-D68 season in Japan. Multi-year studies on EV-D68 suggest that the EV-D68 epidemic season differs by country, with peak seasons of August-January in China [23] , July-December in Australia [24] , October-December in Germany [25] , and July-October in the Netherlands [26] , and variable seasons in Thailand and Hong Kong [15, 27] .

Earlier reports describing receptor binding activity of EV-D68 strains in all genetic clades showed that distinct genetic clades have different antigenicities [28] . Therefore, differences in the prevalent genetic clade of EV-D68 each year in Osaka City might have contributed to its re-emergence in this limited geographic area. There were high similarities in VP1 nucleotide and amino acid sequences of Osaka strains detected in 2010, 2013, and 2015. However, lower similarities were observed for strains detected in 2010 vs. 2013, 2013 vs. 2015, and 2010 vs. 2015. This low similarity might be associated with differences in EV-D68 antigenicity. Lower herd immunity against strains in specific genetic clades of EV-D68 might have facilitated the rapid spread of a clade of EV-D68 that was not reported to be prevalent in the limited geographic area. Intriguingly, co-circulation of all three clades of EV-D68 was observed in Yamagata Prefecture, Japan, in the 2010 epidemic [12] . Based on these results, EV-D68 dynamics might differ in the same period in different parts of the country. One might infer that herd immunity against different clades of EV-D68 is associated with their prevalences in a limited geographic area.",

Some characteristic partial deletions, relative to the prototype Fermon strain, were observed in the 5 0 UTRs of EV-D68 strains in three clades. However, we did not analyze functional differences or the physiological importance of the deletion on EV-D68. To date, there has been no published report on the function of the EV-D68 5 0 UTR. The 5 0 UTR of an enterovirus contains an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) that is associated with translational efficiency and virulence [29] [30] [31] . Deletions in EV-D68 strains appeared to be in the region between the IRES and the open reading frame. Analysis of this deletion may yield important information about EV-D68. The 5 0 UTR of EV-D68 strain CA/AFP/11-1767 in clade B showed a deletion similar to that of strains in Clade A. Du et al. analyzed 2014 North American EV-D68 outbreak using VP1, which revealed that CA/AFP/11-1767 strain was phylogenetically distant from other subclade B1 strains [32] . Their findings might partially explain one amino acid substitution (T650) in the BC loop of VP1 in strain CA/AFP/11-1767. However, the reason for the Clade A-like nucleotide deletion in the 5 0 UTR of strain CA/AFP/11-1767 remains unknown.",

To analyze EV-D68 further, near-complete genome sequences of earlier reported strains from cases of ARI, AFM, encephalitis, central nervous system disorders, and other diseases must be determined. Recently, a novel genetic lineage of Subclade B3 was identified that now includes 2015 Osaka strains. Based on our phylogenetic analysis of VP1 (Fig 2) , there are some strains (2013-0720-6-CHN, 2011-21186-CHN, CA/AFP/v12T00346-USA-2013, CU171-THA-2011, CU134-THA-2011) that do not clearly cluster in the currently recognized genetic subgroups in Clade B.

Osaka strains detected in the same year showed high similarities both in nucleotide and amino acid sequences; however, lower similarities were observed between strains detected in different years. When VP1 nucleotide and amino acid sequences of Osaka strains detected in 2015 (Subclade B3) were compared with recently reported strains from United States, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Yamagata, Japan, shown in Fig 2, they were found to be highly similar (96.5-100% [nt]; 97.1-100% [aa]) (Table 2). Phylogenetic analysis using complete or near-complete genome sequences of EV-D68 strains To analyze and compare the strains detected in this study with strains reported earlier from around the world, complete genome sequences (7,341 nt) of two strains (705-OsakaC.JPN-2013, 726-OsakaC.JPN-2013) and near-complete genome sequences (7,110-7,298 nt) from seven strains (727-OsakaC.JPN-2013, 594-OsakaC.JPN-2015, 639-OsakaC.JPN-2015, A184-OsakaC.JPN-2015, A244-OsakaC.JPN-2015, A250-OsakaC.JPN-2015, A252-OsakaC.

Based on the Akaike information criterion with correction for finite sample sizes, a GTR plus G+I model was used. Numbers at nodes, which indicate bootstrap support values (>95%), are given. Sequences in GenBank were also included in the analysis. Strain name, country of origin, and year of detection are shown for each strain. GenBank accession numbers are presented in parentheses. The scale bar shows the genetic distance. Partial deletion of the 5 0 UTR To analyze the 5 0 UTR of the complete or near-complete genome strains, nucleotide positions 501-1,000, corresponding to those of the Fermon strain, were analyzed. All clades (A, B, C, D) of EV-D68 showed deletions at positions 681-703 nt compared to the Fermon strain. As for Clade A, one nucleotide at position 680 was also deleted. Additionally, nucleotides 713-724 were deleted from strains in Clades B and C, except for in strain CA/AFP/11-1767 in Clade B, which also showed one nucleotide deletion at position 680(Fig 5).DiscussionThis report is the first to describe longitudinal surveillance of EV-D68 in children with ARIs since the first epidemic in Japan in 2010. Of 18 EV-D68-positive patients, 15 (83.3%) were positive for EV-D68 alone. Therefore, EV-D68 is believed to be a cause of ARI in at least 15 of these cases.The specimens collected in 2013 were fewer than those collected in 2010-2012 or 2014-2015 because of fewer specimens collected from clinics and not because of a decreasing number of patients with ARI. The rates of EV-D68 positivity per year were 3.8%, 2.8%, and 1.9% in 2010, 2013, and 2015, respectively. The highest rates of EV-D68 were observed in August (15.4%) in 2010, October (25%) in 2013, and September (13.2%) in 2015. Taken together, these results indicate that EV-D68 epidemics in 2010, 2013, and 2015 in Osaka City might have occurred on a similar scale.",
