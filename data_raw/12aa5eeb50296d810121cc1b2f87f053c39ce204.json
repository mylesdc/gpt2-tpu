Several MMTV strains have been shown to productively infect, in addition to murine cells, various heterologous cell lines including those of human origin, albeit less efficiently than murine cells. Furthermore, there have been reports that the continued passage of MMTV in heterologous cell lines gives rise to novel variants that are able to infect naive non-murine cells with higher efficiency than the parental virus.",

            "text": "Results: We show that MMTV(C3H), like other MMTV strains, that had undergone a number of replication cycles in non-murine cells displayed an increased replication kinetic, as compared to parental virus, when applied on naive human cells. Sequence analysis of several replication kinetic variants and the parental virus, together with calculation of the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous mutations at individual codons, revealed that several regions within the viral genome were under strong positive selection pressure during viral replication in human cells. The mutation responsible, at least in part, for the phenotypic change was subsequently mapped to the segment of env encoding the receptor binding site (F 40 HGFR 44 ). Introduction of the identified mutation, leading to single amino acid substitution (G42E), into egfp-containing recombinant MMTV virions enhanced their ability to bind to and infect human cells. Interestingly, neither the replication kinetic mutant nor the parental virus required human TfR1 for infection. Knock-out of TFR1 gene from the human genome did not decrease the susceptibility of Hs578T cells to virus infection. Furthermore, the expression of human TfR1, in contrast to mouse TfR1, did not enhance the susceptibility of MMTV-resistant Chinese hamster ovary cells. Thus, human TfR1 is dispensable for infection and another cell surface molecule mediates the MMTV entry into human cells. Conclusion: Taken together, our data explain the mechanism enabling MMTV to form 'host-range variants' in non-murine cells that has been known for a long time, the basis of which remained obscure. Our findings may expand our understanding of how viruses gain capability to cross species-specific barriers to infect new hosts.",

            "text": "Cross-species transmission of viruses is well documented. Understanding how viruses infect and spread in new hosts is central to understanding the pathogenesis of infection and emergence of disease. Mouse mammary tumour virus (MMTV), the prototypical Type B betaretrovirus, infects Muridae rodents (of the Mus genus specifically) and is associated with mammary adenocarcinomas and T-cell lymphomas [1] [2] [3] [4] . Mouse transferrin receptor 1 (mTfR1) is used by MMTV to initiate infection of murine cells [5] . The human ortholog (hTfR1), even though it has been reported to bind MMTV efficiently, does not serve as an entry receptor for MMTV [6] . Virus entry was blocked at a post-attachment phase due to a lack of internalization of MMTV-bound hTfR1 and subsequent trafficking to the late endosomes where fusion of membranes occurs [6] . Interestingly, although the virus cannot use hTfR1 for cell entry, several MMTV strains have been shown to productively infect, in addition to murine cells, various heterologous cell lines including those of human origin, albeit less efficiently than murine cells [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . It has also been reported that MMTV sequences have been detected in human breast cancer and primary biliary cirrhosis specimens [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] , as well as in canine and feline neoplastic and normal mammary tissue [11] .",

These residues have undergone positive selection for mutations that compromise the interaction between the betaretrovirus entry glycoprotein and TfR1 [18] . At the same time, the entry glycoprotein receptor binding site (RBS; F 40 HGFR 44 residues at the N-terminus-proximal region of the MMTV surface subunit (SU) domain [20] ) has evolved to acquire compatibility with particular host TfR1 orthologs [18] . The molecular arms race between MMTV Env and rodent TfR1 driving endless rounds of 'positive selection' for mutations that affect interaction between the virus and host as well as above mentioned evidence support the concept that MMTV-like viruses once circulated more widely in nature and that they are particularly adept at overcoming cellular barrier preventing cross-species transmissions. Consistent with this model is the observation that continuous passage of MMTV in human or feline cell lines results in an adapted virus that infects various non-murine cells more efficiently that the parental virus [21, 22] . At present, the nature of the adaptation mutation(s) responsible for this phenotypic change is unknown, however it can be envisaged that changes in the receptor binding site may allow the emergence of host range variants.",

            "text": "Such a scenario would be reminiscent of that reported for viruses belonging to two other virus families, Parvoviridae (canine and feline parvoviruses) and Arenaviridae (several rodent and human arenaviruses), which also use TfR1 as their primary cellular receptor to trigger their cellular entry. Canine parvovirus type 2a, is a host-range variant of the closely related feline parvovirus that gained access to dogs through the acquisition of only a few mutations in the capsid protein that allowed efficient binding of the virus to TfR1 expressed on the surface of canine cells [23, 24] . It now appears that the transmission from cats to dogs was an indirect event involving passage through another carnivore species, racoon, which contributed to the adaptation of the capsid protein to canine TfR1 and the emergence of the canine parvovirus [25] . There is also indirect evidence suggesting that New World arenaviruses are able to, though minor changes in the arenavirus entry glycoprotein, expand their host range. Several of these viruses, which typically circulate in rodent species found in the Americas, are emerging into human populations, where they cause hemorrhagic fever and lethal disease [26, 27] . Their zoonotic potential correlates with the ability to use the human TfR1 (hTfR1) in addition to their native rodent TfR1 [26] . Whereas clade B arenavirus that do not cause human disease (e.g. Amapari virus and Tacaribe virus) cannot utilize hTfR1 for cell entry, the pathogenic clade B arenaviruses effectively recognise the human ortholog, leading to the more efficient infection of human cells and, in turn, zoonotic transmission [28] [29] [30] . Interestingly, it has been shown that changes in as little as one amino acid residue of hTfR1 were sufficient for nonpathogenic arenaviruses to gain use of the receptor for cell entry [29] . Similarly, mutation of only a few amino acid residues enabled the conversion of the mouse TfR1 (mTfR1) to a compatible cell entry receptors for pathogenic arenaviruses [28] . From the aforementioned studies, it can be inferred that only minor changes in the receptor binding domain of GP1 may dramatically change arenavirus tropism.",

The established infection was, however, sufficient to enable virus spread to every cell in culture. Infectivity of the wild-type and MMTV(C3H)-Env-carrying MMTV recombinant virions was blocked by heat-inactivation and an inhibitor of reverse transcription, 3\u2032-azido-3\u2032-deoxythymidine (AZT), ruling out a nonspecific mechanism of viral transfer [31] . Furthermore, infection requires an intact MMTV envelope protein, since neutralizing anti-MMTV antibodies blocked infectivity of both the wild-type and MMTV(C3H)-Env-carrying MMTV recombinant virions. Persistently infected Hs578T cells produced infectious virus particles capable of infecting naive human breast cells in culture, the infectivity of which could be blocked by neutralizing anti-MMTV antibodies, heatinactivation and AZT, demonstrating that virus particles released by the persistently infected Hs578T cells are antigenically related to the virus produced from murine cells and showing that the presence of proviral DNA in infected cells is due to an authentic, receptor-mediated and reverse transcriptase-dependent infection process [31] .",

The greatest number of point mutations was found in the Env coding region. Next, we sought to analyze whether selection pressures shaped the genetic variation during cultivation in human cells. Calculation of the ratio between the number of non-synonymous mutations per non-synonymous site (dN) and synonymous mutations per synonymous site (dS) was used to infer the direction and magnitude of natural selection acting on a protein encoding sequence. A dN/dS ratio lower than one implies purifying selection, whereas a ratio greater than one implies positive or fixing selection. The ratio was calculated using the Tamura-Nei method implemented in the MEGA software package that estimates the number of non-synonymous and synonymous changes that have occurred at each codon throughout evolution [33] . The average dN/dS ratio for the entire Env coding region was slightly less than one, suggesting that the entire env is under neutral selection. However, because different regions of a single gene can be exposed to different selective pressures, we analysed the dN/dS ratios over the entire length of the gene using a sliding window of 100 codons. Importantly, several regions in env were found to be under positive selection during virus cultivation in human cells ( [20] , was detected in all twelve MMTV(C3H)hp1 clones but not in MMTV(C3H) virus ( Figure 2B and C). This particular polymorphism has previously been reported in the SU sequence from MMTV(RIII) virus adapted to the human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 (designated RIIIM) [20, 34] . Additionally, one of the twelve MMTV(C3H)hp1 clones was also found to carry an additional non-synonymous mutation (arginine to lysine substitution at position 44 of SU; R44K) in the RBS of SU ( Figure 2B ). These results imply that the RBD of viruses replicating in human cells is under positive selection pressure and changes in this region may facilitate infection of human cells and in turn lead to faster replication kinetics. Other point mutations leading to amino acid substitutions were found outside the regions encoding the RBD and heparin binding domain (HBD). In contrast to the mutations described above, none of these polymorphisms were found in all twelve MMTV(C3H)hp1 clones. Surprisingly, a high frequency of non-synonymous mutations was also identified for the Sag coding region (Figure 2A, left panel) . This region also appears to be under a positive selection pressure. The reason for the observed phenomenon is not clear. As expected, the most conserved gene was the gene encoding the enzymatic components of the virus, pol. The dN/dS ratio for this region was close to one, suggesting that this segment of the virus was under neutral selection ( Figure 2A , left panel).",

            "text": "Next, we analysed whether the MMTV(C3H)hp1 sequences carry a signature of the human APOBEC3G (hA3G), which is expressed in Hs578T cells [35] . The hA3G is an intrinsic immunity factor that catalyses deamination of deoxycitidine (C) to deoxyuridine (U) in the minus strand viral DNA (\u2212ssDNA) during reverse transcription. (Subsequent synthesis of the plus strand from a deaminated minus strand template induces G to A mutations in newly generated plus strand viral DNA). We hypothesised that if the variants exhibiting faster replication kinetics resulted from the mutagenesis in human cells and not from selection of pre-existing quasispecies, they should contain hallmarks of hA3G-mediated mutagenesis (C to U transitions in the -ssDNA). Furthermore, analysis of sequence context of the deaminated deoxycitidines can be also used as an indirect method to confirm the human origin of infected cells. This is due to the fact that the hA3G and mouse APOBEC3 deaminases target deoxycytosine within different DNA sequence contexts (hA3G commonly targets the last C in a run of C's on the -ssDNA, whereas mouse APOBEC3 prefers \"TTC\" targets [36] [37] [38] ). We observed that about 40% of mutations could be attributed to APOBEC3 activity ( Figure 3A ; C to T substitutions in the -ssDNA). Additionally, the most commonly targeted cytosine was within the canonical 5\u2032-CCC-3\u2032 (\u2212ssDNA) sequence context recognized by hA3G ( Figure 3B ). Importantly, the hA3G activity also likely accounted for the G42E substitution in the receptor binding sequence detected in all twelve MMTV(C3H)hp1 clones. The glycine codon GGG (CCC in -ssDNA) was mutated to GAG (CUC in -ssDNA) encoding for glutamic acid. Taken together, these data provide evidence supporting the concept that a large proportion of mutations in MMTV(C3H)hp1 proviral DNA can be attributed to hA3G-directed mutagenesis. Hallmarks of the hA3Gmediated cytosine deamination substantiate our original hypothesis that MMTV(C3H) is capable of productive infection of human cells. Additionally, the hA3G-mediated mutagenesis may, at least in part, explain the relatively long cultivation time required to detect infection of every human cell in culture.",

As a control, we used MMTV particles pseudotyped with an amphotropic MLV 4070A Env. The filtered supernatant from transfected HEK293T cells was subsequently used to transduce both human (Hs578T) and mouse (NMuMG) mammary epithelial cells. We first demonstrated that the mutant Env was efficiently processed. Total cell extracts from WT and mutant pENV C3H -transfected HEK293T cells were subjected to Western blot analysis with anti-gp52/36 to determine the levels of the viral proteins. The mutant Env was processed into mature SU and TM ( Figure 4A ), indicating that no gross changes in Env processing had occurred as a result of the sequence alterations.",

When equal amounts of virus (quantified by western blot analysis of serially diluted concentrated virions using anti-MMTV CA antibody) were used for transduction of human cells, the G42E mutant exhibited approximately 6-fold increase in transduction efficiency compared to WT Env carrying virus ( Figure 4B ). In mouse cells, however, the same mutations caused only a modest (~2-fold) increase in transduction levels ( Figure 4B ). The infectivity of MMTV-based vectors carrying the mutant Env was, like the infectivity of vectors carrying the WT Env, completely blocked after preincubation with neutralizing goat anti-MMTV antibodies ( Figure 4C ). In contrast, pre-treatment of the virions with non-specific serum had no effect on the infectivity ( Figure 4C ). Importantly, no alteration in the infectivity was observed when the MLV 4070A Env-carrying pseudovirions were pre-incubated with the anti-MMTV antibodies ( Figure 4C ), ruling out nonspecific infection inhibition activity of the serum. Additionally, the infectivity of the WT and mutant Env-carrying MMTV virions was blocked by heat-inactivation (60\u00b0C, 10 minutes) and an inhibitor of reverse transcription, 3\u2032-azido-3\u2032-deoxythymidine (AZT; 37 \u03bcM) ( Figure 4C ), ruling out a nonspecific mechanism of vector transfer/showing that vector transfer is due to an authentic, reverse transcriptasedependent infection process.",

The GPs from pathogenic New World clade B arenaviruses use hTfR1 as a cellular receptor, whereas non-pathogenic strains do not use hTfR1 for cell entry [28] [29] [30] 46] . mTfR1, on the other hand, plays no role in clade B arenavirus cell entry [28] [29] [30] .",

Further, the addition of mTfR1 had no effect on the transduction efficiency of either JUNV or TCRV GP pseudotyped vectors ( Figure 6A ). In contrast to arenaviruses, mTfR1 expression caused a significant increase in the transduction levels of MMTVbased vectors carrying WT and G42E Env, respectively (>10 fold; Figure 6A ). Importantly, the expression of hTfR1 had no effect on transduction efficiency ( Figure 6A ). Similar results were also obtained when wild-type MMTV(C3H) virus, harvested from cell culture fluids of an MMTV-induced mouse mammary tumour cell line (Mm5MT) was used (Additional file 1: Figure S1A ). Also in this case only the presence of mTfR1 allowed efficient entry of the virus into CHO cells. Next, we analysed whether a downmodulation of hTfR1 expression will have an effect on transduction efficiency. Hs578T cells were treated with an hTFR1 mRNA-targeting siRNA prior to incubation with MMTV vectors carrying various Envs. As a control, cells transfected with non-targeting siRNA were used. Similar to previous reports, the depletion of hTfR1 in Hs578T cells resulted in approximately 2-fold reduction in the transduction levels of JUNV GP pseudotyped vectors, whereas the levels of TCRV GP pseudotyped vectors remained unaffected ( Figure 6B ) [30] . Importantly, the transduction efficiency of MMTV Env-carrying vectors under conditions of reduced endogenous hTfR1 expression remained comparable to that obtained with cells expressing hTfR1. Similar results were observed for both the WT and mutant Env ( Figure 6B ). The infectivity of wild-type MMTV(C3H) virus, harvested from Mm5MT cells, was also unaffected by hTfR1 knockdown (Additional file 1: Figure S1B ).",

Therefore, it may be possible that residual levels of hTfR1 may affect the MMTV entry process. For example, remaining hTfR1 may be sufficient to initiate a low level of virus entry. Alternatively, as MMTV binds to hTfR1 [6] , the presence of the protein on the cell surface may trap the virus and/or hinder its interaction with other molecules on the cell surface. To provide a definitive answer as to whether hTfR1 has any role to play in MMTV infection, we knocked out hTFR1 from Hs578T cells, using CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats Type II)/Cas9 [47, 48] . Specifically, we used the lentiCRISPR vector production system, which enables simultaneous delivery of a mammalian codon-optimised Cas9 nuclease, a single guide RNA (sgRNA) and a puromycin selection marker into target cells [49] .",

Transduced cells were cultured in the presence of puromycin for a total of 14 days after which individual clones were isolated and expanded. A total of 43 clones were used for further analysis. First, we assayed the genomic mutation status of the hTFR1 locus in the individual clones. The CRISPR-Cas9 system induces double-strand DNA breaks that are repaired mainly by error-prone nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ). Thirty three percent (14 out of 43) of the clones bore mutations at the hTFR1 locus, as determined by a T7 endonuclease I (T7EI) assay and DNA sequencing ( Figure 7C ). Of the 14 clones, one contained mutations in all three copies of the hTFR1 locus [Hs578T cells carry two copies of chromosome 3 as well a derivative of chromosome 3: der(3)t(3;15)(q10;p10); hTFR1 gene located on Chr3q29], as determined by DNA sequencing ( Figure 7E ). These mutations led to premature stop codons, which effectively disrupted the open reading frame (ORF) of hTFR1, yielding truncated protein products (Additional file 2: Figure  S2 ). Successful hTfR1 knock-out was confirmed by western blotting of cell lysates ( Figure 7D ). Next, these Hs578T\u0394hTfR1 cells were transduced with the panel of MMTV-based vectors carrying WT MMTV(C3H) Env, mutant (G42E) Env, JUNV GP or TCRV GP. As a control, one of the clones that carried no mutations at the hTFR1 and showed similar levels of hTfR1 expression to parental Hs578T cells was used. As expected, transduction efficiency of JUNV GP-pseudotyped vectors was compromised in Hs578T\u0394hTfR1 cells compared to cells expressing hTfR1 ( Figure 8A ). Further, TCRV GP vector transduction rates were unaffected by hTfR1 expression ( Figure 8A ) [29, 30] .

In contrast, pre-treatment of the virions with non-specific serum had no effect on the ability of these vectors to infect Hs578T\u0394hTfR1 cells ( Figure 8B ). Importantly, TCRV GP pseudotyped vectors, pre-incubated with the anti-MMTV antibodies, were still able to transduce Hs578T\u0394hTfR1 cells ( Figure 8B ), ruling out nonspecific infection inhibition activity of the serum. These results suggest that MMTV-mediated infection of Hs578T\u0394hTfR1 cells relies on a specific interaction of the viral envelope with a cell surface receptor, other than hTfR1. Furthermore, the incubation of supernatants at 60\u00b0C for 10 minutes, prior to transduction of hTfR1 knock-out cells, abrogated the infectivity of vectors regardless of the Env used ( Figure 8B) , showing that transmission of vector DNA is temperature sensitive, as expected for vector transduction rather than for other means of DNA transfer. Finally, the addition of AZT (37 \u03bcM) to the culture medium of the transduced Hs578T\u0394hTfR1 cells inhibited transduction ( Figure 8B ), further demonstrating that the presence of vector DNA in the transduced cells resulted from the reverse transcription-dependent process as expected for vector transduction.",

Specifically, MMTV(C3H)hp1 required four-times less time (21 days) to infect every cell in cell culture, even-though infectious doses equivalent to those used with viruses produced from murine cells were used. Several mechanisms may explain the observed variation in replication kinetics: i) differences hTFR1 guide oligos for sgRNA TFRCsgRNA1+ in virus preparations, such as percentage of defective virions; ii) pseudotyping with human genome-encoded envelope protein(s); iii) recombination with human cellular DNA or human endogenous proviral sequences; iv) selection of a pre-existing quasispecies in the wild-type MMTV population and v) random mutation event(s) followed by selection of variants exhibiting faster replication kinetics in human cells. We believe that the first two mechanisms can be readily ruled out. This conviction is based on the observation that MMTV(C3H)hp1 virions contained surface antigen determinants identical or very similar to those found on MMTVs released from murine cells, as judged from the complete neutralization of MMTV(C3H)hp1 infectivity with the MMTV-specific antibodies. Similarly, real time RT-PCR results, combined with single round infection experiments, did not reveal significantly greater levels of defective viruses in virus preparations generated in murine and human cells, respectively. Furthermore, MMTV(C3H)hp1 did not contain sequences from other viruses or from the human genome, as determined by sequences analysis. Instead, the MMTV(C3H)hp1 sequences (complete genomes with the exception of the Gag-coding region containing a sequence precluding cloning and growth in E. coli) originated from MMTV(C3H). Thus, recombination with sequences of human origin does also not account for the observed variation in the speed of virus replication. Finally, upon further analysis, MMTV(C3H)hp1 was found to carry an hA3G specific signature of cytosine deamination. Hallmarks of the hA3G-mediated cytosine deamination further substantiate our original hypothesis that MMTV(C3H) is capable of productive infection of human cells. Additionally, the hA3G-mediated mutagenesis may, at least in part, also explain the relatively long cultivation time required to detect infection of every human cell in culture.",

Most of the point mutations identified in the SU subunit-encoding portion of env were unique to the MMTV(C3H)hp1 sequences and were not found in other strains of MMTV. Additionally, the bulk of the polymorphisms were unique to each individual proviral plasmid clone. Several non-synonymous mutations were found in the RBD. Some of these mutations were situated directly in a five-amino-acid stretch of polar and hydrophobic residues, F 40 HGFR 44 , believed to constitute the RBS [20] .

The non-conservative alteration from a small non-charged amino acid to a negatively charged polar residue is expected to impose both electrostatic and steric effects on the RBS ( Figure 2C ). This mutation may thus alter virus receptor use, giving rise to an adapted virus capable of infecting heterologous cells with increased efficiency. In HIV, mutations that alter the charge in and around the predicted CD4-binding site in gp120 give rise to variants that enter cells in a CD4-independent manner, which enables the virus to expand its target cell range [50] .

Such a scenario would be reminiscent of what has been reported for another group of viruses that use TfR1 as their primary cellular receptor -New World clade B Arenaviruses. These viruses are endemic to rodent populations found in the Americas and each virus has evolved compatibility with the specific TfR1 ortholog encoded by its respective host species [18, [28] [29] [30] . Several of these viruses have, however, through changes in the amino acid residues of the RBD, acquired compatibility with hTfR1, which allows more efficient infection of human cells and enables the zoonotic transmission to humans [26, 46] .",

Second, human (Hs578T) cells, in which the TfR1 expression has been downmodulated using hTFR1-targeted siRNA did not exhibit decreased susceptibility to MMTV-based vectors carrying the mutant Env relative to vectors carrying the WT Env. Third, MMTV-based vectors carrying mutant MMTV(C3H) Env transduced hTFR1 knock-out human Hs578T cells with efficiency similar to cells expressing hTfR1.

This includes the observation that feline TfR1, derived from the most susceptible cell line, CrFK, does not make cells susceptible to MMTV infection [53] . Thus, feline cells must express another molecule, different from TfR1 that enables the virus to enter the cytoplasm. Further evidence comes from studies of cell entry of the non-pathogenic New World arenaviruses. They typically use TfR1 orthologs of their host species as receptor molecule. However, like MMTV, they have been reported to relatively efficiently enter human cells in an TfR1 independent manner using so far unidentified alterantive receptor(s) [29, 30] . Additionally, the usage of more than one cell surface molecule as receptor is not rare and it has been reported for a number of viruses including SARS coronavisus and enterovirus 71 [54, 55] . Some viruses seem to exhibit an even more complex receptor dependency that involves engagement with multiple cell surface components. An example is hepatitis C virus (HCV), which in addition to attachment factors such as HS and L-SIGN also requires the co-expression of four proteins (CD81, SR-B1, claudin-1 and occludin) for entry into cells (reviewed in [56] ). Another variation is the use of both a primary and a secondary/co-receptor for cell entry. HIV-1 is a prime example of such a process, since it requires the coexpression of co-receptors (CCR5 or CXCR4), in addition to the primary receptor CD4, for cell entry (reviewed in [57] ). Finally, some viruses use less specific interactions with attachment factors to bind to the cell surface before interacting with the true receptor, such as the binding of HIV-1 to syndecans, which enhances virus entry into macrophages [58] . In the case of MMTV, an alternative receptor may substitute for hTfR1, function in conjuction with TfR1 in a manner similar to the HCV multiple cell surface component dependency, or function down-stream of TfR1 in manner analogous to the HIV1 co-receptors. Work to identify the attachment receptor used by MMTV to enter human cells and initiate infection is currently ongoing.",

Oligonucleotide primers specific for either hTFR1 (Figure 7A & B) or egfp were designed according to Shalem et al. [49] . The gene specific oligos were phosphorylated at the 5\u2032 end using T4 polynucleotide kinase (PNK), annealed together giving rise to a double stranded insert carrying cohesive ends compatible with BsmBI-generated restriction sites. Reactions were carried out in a total volume of 10 \u03bcl containing 100 \u03bcM of each oligo, 1x T4 Ligation Buffer (NEB) and 5 units T4 PNK (NEB). After the first incubation at 37\u00b0C for 30 minutes, the oligos were denaturated at 95\u00b0C for 5 min and annealed together by gradually ramping down temperature (\u22125\u00b0C/min) to 25\u00b0C. The lenti-CRISPR vector was digested with BsmBI (NEB) to remove a spacer sequence and ligated with the double stranded insert. To produce lentivirus vector, 7.5 x 10 5 HEK293T cells (6-well plate) were co-transfected with 1 \u03bcg lentiCRISPR plasmid, 0.8 \u03bcg packaging construct (pLP1, Invirogen), 0.6 \u03bcg Rev expression construct (pLP2, Invitorgen) and 0.3 \u03bcg VSV-G Env-encoding plasmid (pHCMV-G). Transfections were performed using the calcium phosphate method. Thirty-six hours post-transfection, the viruscontaining supernatants were harvested, filtered (0.45 \u03bcm, Sarstedt) and 4 serial dilutions (undiluted, 1:10, 1:100 and 1:1000) prepared. For transduction, target cells (Hs578T or Hs578T-EGFP) were seeded at a density of 5 x 10 4 cells per well (6-well plate), one day before transduction. The increasing dilutions of the filtered virus supernatant was added to cells together with polybrene (8 \u03bcg/ml) and replaced with fresh medium after 2 hours. Puromycin (0.3 \u03bcg/mL) was added to the cells 16 hours post transduction. Hs578T-EGFP cells transduced with lentiCRISPRbased vector particles carrying sgRNA targeting egfp were maintained for 11 days and analysed by UV microscopy and FCM. Hs578T cells transduced with lentiCRISPRbased vector particles carrying sgRNA targeting hTFR1 were maintained for 14 days in the puromycin-containing medium. Then, single clones were expanded, genomic DNA extracted and analysed by a T7 endonuclease I assay followed by DNA sequencing. For the T7 endonuclease assay the primers listed in Figure 8A were used to generate an 1100 bp PCR product encompassing the target site. Cycling conditions consisted of 94\u00b0C for 2 min, followed by 35 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 30 s, 58\u00b0C for 30 s, 72\u00b0C for 40 s, and a final extension of 7 min at 72\u00b0C. The PCR products were column purified and 500 ng of DNA per sample were subjected to the following hybridisation reaction: 95\u00b0C for 5 min, ramped down to 85\u00b0C at \u22122\u00b0C /s and ramped down further to 25\u00b0C at \u22120.1\u00b0C/s. The products were subsequently digested with 1 unit of T7 endonuclease (NEB) in a 10 \u03bcl reaction volume for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. The mixture was then resolved on a 2% agarose gel. The amplicons carrying non-perfectly matched DNA (digested with T7 endonuclease) were cloned into the pCR2.1 plasmid [TA cloning kit (Invitrogen)] and at least six clones analysed by sequencing.",

A red arrow points to the expected cleavage site. (B) Oligonucleotide sequences used for the generation and characterisation of Hs578T\u0394hTfR1 cells. (C) Detection of mutations in Hs578T clones generated by transduction of lentiCRISPR vector containing sgRNA targeting hTFR1and Cas9 nuclease. PCR products (1100 bp) containing the target site were denatured, re-annealed and probed with T7 endonuclease that recognizes non-perfectly matched DNA. A cleavage product of~600 bp indicates successful NHEJ-mediated mutation in at least one copy of hTFR1 (lanes 2-11). Analysis of 12 clones is shown; (the amount of PCR product loaded in lane 4 was lower than in other lanes). (D) Western blot analysis of the hTFR1 knock-out Hs578T clone (\u2212/\u2212) together with controls including parental cells (WT) and a clone containing at least one copy of non-mutated hTFR1(+/+). Cellular lysates were also probed for actin to ensure equal loading (bottom panel).
