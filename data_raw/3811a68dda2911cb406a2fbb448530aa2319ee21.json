In this study, we constructed genetically modified Lactobacillus acidophilus strains expressing the membrane proximal external region (MPER) from human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) within the context of the major S-layer protein, SlpA. Intragastric immunization of mice with the recombinants induced MPER-specific and S-layer protein-specific antibodies in serum and mucosal secretions. Moreover, analysis of systemic SlpA-specific cytokines revealed that the responses appeared to be Th1 and Th17 dominant. These findings demonstrated the potential use of the Lactobacillus S-layer protein for development of oral vaccines targeting specific peptides.",

The mucosal immune system is, in many respects, independent of the systemic immune system. In humans, 90% of intestinal and 50% of vaginal IgA is produced locally and induction of mucosal immunity is best achieved via mucosal infection or vaccination [1] [2] [3] . Passive transfer studies using broadly neutralizing antibodies (BnAb) have shown protection against mucosal transmission (reviewed in [4] ). Induction of BnAb has proven extraordinarily difficult because neutralizing epitopes are often structurally complex and difficult to faithfully recapitulate, long-term immune maturation is needed to acquire the extensive hypermutation described for most neutralizing IgG, and some neutralizing antibodies show autoreactivity [5, 6] . However, BnAb may not be essential for protection at the mucosa.",

IgA can sequester virus in mucus, sterically hinder binding to mucosal epithelia, and target virus for destruction via the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR). There is also growing interest in the protective potential of non-neutralizing IgG [7] [8] [9] [10] . Mechanisms of non-neutralizing protection include antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, antibodydependent cell-mediated virus inhibition, and other innate immune functions such as phagocytosis that are mediated by the Fc domain of the antibody.

Proof of principle studies have been performed using recombinant lactobacilli as oral vaccines against tetanus toxin, anthrax, rotavirus, Brucella aborus, SARS Coronavirus, human papilloma virus, Helicobacter pylori and others (reviewed in [11] [12] [13] ). In 2003, Xin and colleagues employed recombinant Lactococcus lactis to induce HIV-specific immune responses [14] . While this report clearly demonstrated the potential of lactic acid bacteria as vaccine vectors against HIV-1, there were two concerns with the approach that was employed. First, cholera toxin was used as an adjuvant and is not acceptable for use in humans. Second, the HIV-1 IIIB Env V2-V4 loop was used as the immunogen and is unlikely to induce a broadly protective immune response. Thus, alternative adjuvants and antigen design and expression are needed for a successful anti-HIV vaccine using lactic acid bacteria.",

Chromosomal DNA of L. acidophilus NCFM was used for template DNA. The PCR products were applied to the second round of PCR along with AK_63 and AK_64. The connected 2 kb fragment was treated with BamHI and HindIII followed by ligation with the digested pTRK935. The resulting plasmid, pTRK1053, was introduced into L. acidophilus NCK1910 by electroporation. The gene replacement by double crossing-over was performed as previously described [23] . The mutation in slpA was validated by PCR. A DNA fragment encoding matured mouse IL-1\u03b2 was fused with the signal sequence of L. acidophilus mub gene (locus_tag: LBA1709) by overlap PCR. Each DNA fragment was amplified using either PCK_1 & AK_80 with L. acidophilus chromosomal DNA or AK_79 & PCK_2 with total mouse cDNA. The fusion DNA was inserted between the EcoRI and EagI sites of pTRK882 [24] . The established plasmid, pGAD17, was introduced into L. acidophilus NCK2208, the strain displaying MPER. The nucleotide sequences of the primers are described in S2 Table.",

The additional boosts also showed that GAD31 was capable of inducing MPER-specific Ab production while no responses were shown in NCK1985 (S5 Fig). Isotype analysis of the MPER-specific serum antibody induced by GAD19 revealed that IgG2b was dominant, albeit only small part of anti-MPER could be detected due to low sensitivity of the assay (Fig 6) .",

            "text": "S-layer proteins are dominating cell-surface components of some bacteria that serve as scaffolds for functional peptides. Because of their abundance, S-layer proteins may be a more efficient means to display specific vaccine epitopes as compared to other surface display approaches such as LPXTG-anchored proteins and flagella [14, 31, 32] . The present study shows that a mutant L. acidophilus displaying MPER was successfully established by modification of the slpA gene. The high frequency of the epitope on the bacterial surface was demonstrated by flow cytometry and immunoblot assay. Importantly, mAb 2F5 recognized the MPER peptides exposed on the S-layer proteins suggesting that the heterologous 16-mer peptide reproduced the corresponding structure of HIV-1. Presently, insertion of peptides longer than 19 amino acids into SlpA protein without destructive effects on the S-layer structure has been difficult ( [33] and our unpublished data). Work is ongoing to successfully engineer the insertion of longer and/or multiple peptides. In previous studies, S-layer proteins of a different L. acidophilus strain and a Lactobacillus brevis strain were engineered to include a c-Myc epitope, although the immunological properties were not determined [33, 34] . Scheppler et al. reported that immunization of mice with a recombinant Lactobacillus johnsonii strain expressing PrtB, the cell wall anchored proteinase of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, with an inserted mimotope of tetanus toxin induced antibodies specific to the bacterial cell and PrtB but not to the mimotope [35] . This emphasizes that display of epitopes on the bacterial surface does not guarantee immunogenicity. Hence, we investigated whether the MPER on SlpA could elicit specific immune responses in vivo. In a preliminary experiment, L. acidophilus NCK2208 was only weakly immunogenic with no antibody response to MPER. To improve the mucosal immunogenicity of NCK2208, matured murine IL-1\u03b2 was employed since IL-1 and IL-1 family proteins are known to act as mucosal adjuvants [36, 37] . We previously showed that biologically active IL-1\u03b2 can be produced and secreted by another recombinant Lactobacillus strain [38] . In the first round of i. g. immunization with the recombinant strain and reference strains, both MPER-specific Abs and the specific IgA-producing cells were detected exclusively in the group receiving the IL-1\u03b2secreting strain. On the other hand, SlpA-specific responses did not rely on the cytokine. These results implied that the induction of MPER-specific but not SlpA-specific Abs was adjuvantdependent. However, in the second trial where mice received four additional boosts, both L. acidophilus strains eventually elicited MPER-specific Ab responses regardless of IL-1\u03b2 coexpression. This suggests that IL-1\u03b2 was not essential for, but possibly expedited the specific immune responses. Additional studies are needed to confirm the adjuvant effect of IL-1\u03b2 and better define the mechanism of action.",

The current study showed that repeated, high dose immunization with L. acidophilus evoked S-layer protein-specific antibodies and cytokine responses. Splenocytes isolated from mice immunized with the L. acidophilus strains were re-stimulated with purified S-layer proteins. Production of several cytokines was markedly upregulated, most notably, IFN-\u03b3 and IL-17. This suggests that the systemic immune responses specific to S-layer proteins were Th1 and Th17 dominant. Since the pattern of cytokine production in each group treated with L. acidophilus strains was similar regardless of SlpA-mutation or co-expression of IL-1\u03b2, those responses were likely attributed to the nature of the S-layer protein, per se. SlpA of L. acidophilus has previously been shown to induce cytokine production by dendritic cells via DC-SIGN in vitro [20] . Our current study reveals the role of the S-layer proteins in adaptive immune responses in vivo.",

This suggests the MPER peptide embedded in the Slayer protein did not stimulate a T cell response and that the MPER-specific antibody response was T cell independent. Isotype analysis revealed that the major subclass of MPER-specific antibody was IgG2b, which is known to be evoked in a T cell independent manner [39] . The involvement of TGF-\u03b2 in IgG2b switching has previously been reported [40] . As mentioned above, S-layer proteins stimulate a Th17 response, which is known to require IL-6 and TGF-\u03b2. Taken together, TGF-\u03b2 produced in response to S-layer proteins of L. acidophilus may drive or facilitate a T cell independent antibody response against MPER. This could be an important feature of the L. acidophilus vaccine platform given the growing general concerns that vectorinduced T cell responses may enhance HIV-1 infection [41] .",

The current study demonstrates that genetically engineered L. acidophilus can induce both mucosal and systemic antigen-specific antibodies by repeated mucosal immunization. However, the functional characteristics of the induced antibodies remain to be determined. Classical virus neutralization may not be essential if other mechanisms can reduce the likelihood of infectious virions contacting target cells. Several functional attributes of mucosal antibodies have been described for pathogen neutralization [42] . These include immune exclusion, intracellular neutralization, reverse-transcytosis, and immune targeting via the high-affinity IgA receptor (CD89) expressed on dendritic cells and neutrophils [43] [44] [45] . Furthermore, local elimination of early virus targets via antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity could create a one-two punch and provide a significant level of protection without the need for rapid immune activation. Clearly, it remains to be confirmed, in an appropriate animal model, whether recombinant L. acidophilus can induce a protective mucosal and systemic antibody response against HIV-1 without activating mucosal T cell targets.",
