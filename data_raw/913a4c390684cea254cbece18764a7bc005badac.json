The reaction was monitored by TLC (eluent hexane/ethyl acetate 8/2). After evaporation of the solvent, the obtained material was taken up with dichloromethane. The solution was washed three times with water and the organic layer was dried (MgSO4). Filtration, followed by evaporation of the solvent under vacuum, provided a crude product which was chromatographed on silicagel (100g, eluent hexane/ethyl acetate 1/1) to afford the wanted product which was further recrystallized (Scheme 1).",

Infrared spectra were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer RX I spectrometer as deuteriochloroform solutions (or KBr discs) or with a Nicolet Magna 550 FTIR spectrometer fitted with a horizontal Attenuated Total Reflectance (ATR) Durascope Durasampler equipped with a diamond / KRS5 internal reflection element; a DTGS detector was used at a resolution of 4cm -1 . The 1 H-NMR (300 MHz) spectra were recorded on a Varian AC 300 spectrometer. Chemical shifts are expressed as parts per million downfield from tetramethylsilane. Splitting patterns have been designated as follows: s (singlet), d (doublet), dd (doublet of doublet), t (triplet), dt (doublet of triplet), q (quadruplet), m (multiplet), br. (broad signal). Coupling constants (J values) are listed in hertz (Hz). Mass spectra were obtained with a ZQ 2000 MS spectrometer applying an electrospray (ES) + ionization technique. * * * -The 3-(3-chlorophenyl)-2-nitro-4H-furo[3,2-c][1]benzopyran-4-one DD311 has already been described by one of us(1). The synthesis of the 3-(3-chlorophenyl)-6,7-dihydrobenzofuran-4(5H)-one DD264 has previously been described(2). The other compounds tested herein were especially prepared for the present work. The new nitro derivatives DD363, DD771, DD775, DD776, DD778, DD783, DD784, JP10, JP25, JP49, JP52, were synthesized in their racemic forms starting from the appropriate 4-hyroxycoumarin and of the suitable 3-(2-chloro-2-nitrovinyl)-1H-indole by adapting a methodology previously reported involving potassium fluoride in refluxing 1,2-dimethoxyethane(Table 1)(1, 3).General procedure : A 50-mL round-bottomed flask equipped with reflux condenser and a magnetic stirring bar was charged with the appropriate 4-hyroxycoumarin (10 mmol), anhydrous potassium fluoride (0.58g, 10 mmol) and the suitable 3-(2-chloro-2-nitrovinyl)-1H-indole (5 mmol) in 1,2-dimethoxyethane (25 mL). The mixture was refluxed with stirring under argon atmosphere for 30 hours. Removal of the solvent at 50\u00b0C under vacuum afforded a solid which was filtered and washed successively with dichloromethane then methanol.",
