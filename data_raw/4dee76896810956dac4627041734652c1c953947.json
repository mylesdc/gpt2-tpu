Accordingly, many One Health surveillance and viral discovery programs have focused on bats. In this report we present viral metagenomic data from bats collected in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia [KSA]. Unbiased high throughput sequencing of fecal samples from 72 bat individuals comprising four species; lesser mouse-tailed bat (Rhinopoma hardwickii), Egyptian tomb bat (Taphozous perforatus), straw-colored fruit bat (Eidolon helvum), and Egyptian fruit bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus) revealed molecular evidence of a diverse set of viral families: Picornaviridae (hepatovirus, teschovirus, parechovirus), Reoviridae (rotavirus), Polyomaviridae (polyomavirus), Papillomaviridae (papillomavirus), Astroviridae (astrovirus), Caliciviridae (sapovirus), Coronaviridae (coronavirus), Adenoviridae (adenovirus), Paramyxoviridae (paramyxovirus), and unassigned mononegavirales (chuvirus). Additionally, we discovered a bastro-like virus (Middle East Hepe-Astrovirus), with a genomic organization similar to Hepeviridae. However, since it shared homology with Hepeviridae and Astroviridae at ORF1 and in ORF2, respectively, the newly discovered Hepe-Astrovirus may represent a phylogenetic bridge between Hepeviridae and Astroviridae.",

            "text": "Introduction Bats (order Chiroptera) are the second most diverse mammalian order after rodents, comprising more than 1400 species that represent approximately 20% of all mammalian species [1] . Bats are beneficial in arthropod suppression, seed dispersal, and pollination; and serve as a bushmeat food source for some human populations [2, 3] . Bats are also natural reservoirs for a wide range of emerging viruses that may cause infectious diseases in humans, livestock, domestic animals and wildlife [4] , and as a group bats also harbor a higher proportion of zoonotic viruses than other mammals [5] . As with most groups of mammals, bats are predicted to have a large diversity of viruses, which are currently undescribed [5, 6] . The development of more powerful high throughput sequencing (HTS) technology and bioinformatic tools now allow us to better characterize this viral diversity, including analysis of samples from geographic regions that have received little wildlife surveillance attention to date. Recently several bat virome studies have been published using high-throughput viral metagenomic approaches, revealing a wide range of viruses and expanding our knowledge of viral diversity. A coronavirus similar to Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), adenoviruses, herpesviruses and circoviruses were reported in Neoromicia capensis bats from South Africa. Yinda et. al reported diverse rotaviruses, bastroviruses and sapoviruses using HTS analysis of Eidolon helvum and Epomophorus gambianus bats from Cameroon [7] [8] [9] [10] .",

We recovered whole genomes of hepatovirus, rotavirus, polyomavirus, and partial genomes of papillomavirus, astrovirus, sapovirus, teschovirus, parechovirus, coronavirus, adenovirus, paramyxovirus, and chuvirus. In both R. hardwickii and E. helvum, we also found evidence of a virus that, like the recently reported bastrovirus, has elements of both hepeviruses and astroviruses, but differs in genomic organization. The Middle East Hepe-Astrovirus (ME Hepe-Astrovirus) has a genomic organization similar to Hepeviridae; however, it shares homology in certain regions of the genome to members from two viral families, Hepeviridae and Astroviridae.",

Bat capture, morphological measurements and fecal sample collection were conducted as part of an outbreak investigation and surveillance effort with permission from and in coordination with the KSA Ministry of Health (Zoonotic Disease section). No methods for anesthesia, euthanasia, or any kind of animal sacrifice were involved in bat capturing and fecal sample collection. All bats were released after sampling. There was no local IACUC available in KSA at the time of this investigation; however, all bat sampling and handling were carried out in accordance with protocols from previously IACUC approved EcoHealth Alliance studies [12, 13] . All sampling was performed using minimally invasive (non-lethal) techniques detailed in a published protocol [14] . Briefly, individual bats were captured in either mist nets or harp traps located within ten meters of roosting sites or at foraging sites, and held in individual cloth bags until sampling. Bats were restrained manually while blood, urine, oral swabs, and rectal swabs/fecal samples were collected. Microbats (R. hardwickii and T. perforatus) were restrained between the handler's thumb and palm of the non-preferred hand with wing extended with 90\u02daangle between bat's forearm and upper arm, the skin was wiped with alcohol and venous blood from brachial or propatagial (cephalic) vein was collected using a 25 or 27-gauge needle. Larger bats (R. aegyptiacus and E. helvum) were restrained by one researcher and second collected venous blood from propatagial or saphenous (inter-fermoral) vein [15] .",

Filtered suspensions were then treated with DNAse and RNAse to enrich the viral sequences by destroying exogenous host, bacterial, and fungal nucleic acids without affecting nucleic acid protected inside the viral capsid or envelope [16] . Total nucleic acids were then extracted using EasyMag automated extraction platform (bioM\u00e9rieux, Boxtel, The Netherlands) [17] .

Second-stranded cDNA synthesis for HTS was carried out by random primer extension with Klenow enzyme (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA). Double stranded DNA preparations were sheared (E210 sonicator; Covaris, Woburn, MA, USA) for an average fragment size of 200 bp and added to Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA) for purification, and libraries were prepared with the Hyper Prep kit (KAPA Biosystems, Wilmington, MA, USA).

Assembled contiguous sequences (contigs) and unique singletons from assembly were subjected to NCBI BLASTn, and unannotated sequences were further searched on non-redundant (nr) database using NCBI BLASTx.

Sequencing of the E. helvum (n = 24) pool yielded 113 million reads, R. hardwickii (n = 29) pool yielded 116 million reads, T. perforates (n = 17) pool yielded 68 million reads and R. aegyptiacus (n = 2) pool yielded 7 million reads. A total of 124 million reads (~40.7%) were identified as bat host sequences and 13.7 million (~4.5%) low quality and low complexity reads were removed by filtering using PRINSEQ (v 0.20.2) [18] . Of the remaining 167 million reads, 31 million were shared between fungal (~0.43 million,~0.3%), bacterial (~29 million,~17.3%), phage (~0.27 million,~0.2%) and viral sequences (1.6 million,~0.52%). The remaining~130 million reads had similarity with genomic sequences of plants, insects, vertebrates and invertebrates, which largely can be explained by the dietary preference of each bat species. Viral results showed sequences matching with a wide range of known and novel viruses. Approximately 1.6 million (~0.52% of total reads) had nt or amino acid [aa] homology with the entries in the NCBI viral database [30] that included ssRNA viruses (~0.97 million reads, 52.4% of viral reads), ssDNA viruses (~0.47 million reads, 25.7%), dsRNA viruses (~0.11 million reads, 6.2%), dsDNA viruses (~0.24 million reads, 13.0%), retro-transcribing viruses (~0.04 million reads, 2.1%) and unclassified viruses (~0.004 million reads, 0.2%) (Fig 1) . The virus population distribution by Baltimore classification [31] was different amongst the four bat species. Whereas results for R. hardwickii, T. perforatus, and E. helvum represent 17 or more bats per species, results for R. aegyptiacus reflect analysis of only two bats. Reads and contigs related to ssRNA viruses were abundant in R. hardwickii, T. perforatus and E. helvum bats (50-72%). R. aegyptiacus was dominated by retro-transcribing viruses (~88%). Reads and contigs related to ssRNA viruses were found in higher number in E. helvum and R. hardwickii (Fig 1) . Sequences related to ssDNA viruses were found in higher number in T. perforatus and R. hardwickii (Fig 1) . More than 50% of the ssRNA viral reads represented insect-borne picornaviruses that are presumably the result of an insectivorous diet. Similarly, greater than 70% of the ssDNA viral reads represented insect-borne densoviruses and parvoviruses. Based on BLASTn/BLASTx analyses, representations of viral reads per bat species are described in S1 Fig. Sequencing Single stranded RNA and dsRNA virus diversity was more pronounced in R. hardwickii than in other bat species. E. helvum and R. aegyptiacus bat species showed >50% ssRNA viral reads representing the order Picornavirales. T. perforatus and E. helvum had more unclassified negative stranded ssRNA viral reads than either R. aegyptiacus or R. hardwicki. R. aegyptiacus and R. hardwickii had more papillomavirus reads than E. helvum and T. perforatus. In further analysis of sequence contigs with homology to viruses of vertebrate origin we found that some viruses appeared to be restricted to specific bat species (e.g. hepatovirus in R. hardwickii, sapovirus in E. helvum, adenovirus in T. perforatus). Descriptions of sequences and Genbank acc. numbers are summarized in Table 1 .",

Whereas KSA239 [complete genome, 5839 nt] was isolated from R. hardwickii, KSA403 [complete genome, 5745 nt] and KSA410 [partial genome, 4911 nt] were isolated from E. helvum. No poly-A tail was detected through HTS or 3' RACE analysis. The genome organization of the three viruses is most similar to that of hepeviruses (Fig 3) rather than human bastrovirus. KSA239, KSA403, and KSA410 genomes showed~45% nt homology and~50% aa homology with human bastroviruses. Since the genomic organization of viruses recovered from KSA was more similar to hepeviruses and the nt/aa identity shared with bastroviruses was low, we describe these 3 viruses as ME Hepe-Astroviruses. ME Hepe-Astroviruses showed~65% nt and~70% aa homology with bat bastrovirus (acc. no. KX907131) and rat bastrovirus from Vietnam (acc. no. KX907127). They contain ORF1, ORF2 and ORF3. ORF1 and ORF2 are in frame; ORF3 is in +1 position and overlaps ORF2. They also contain conserved domains consistent with the viral methyltransferase (Vtm), helicase, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and capsid proteins of hepeviruses. We also compared ORF1, ORF2 and ORF3 with other hepeviruses and astroviruses and found that whereas ORF1 had higher aa homology to Hepeviridae (30%-37%) than to Astroviridae (11%-19%), ORF2 had higher aa homology to Astroviridae (33%-36%) than to Hepeviridae (17%-21%) (Fig  3) . KSA239, KSA403 and KSA410 showed 59.3%-63.7% nt identity with each other and had an average 61% aa homology, with highest homology in ORF1 (65%-70%) and lowest homology in ORF3 (57%-59%). Comparative topological analysis confirmed these findings. Whereas RdRp sequences clustered with Hepeviridae, the capsid proteins clustered with Astroviridae (Fig 4) . Phylogenetic analysis for Hepe-Astroviruses identified a close lineage with human bastroviruses when comparing RdRp (ORF1) sequences, but a distant lineage with human bastroviruses when comparing capsid (ORF2) sequences (Fig 4) .",

            "text": "https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0214227.g004 A) Hepatoviruses. Six of 29 fecal samples from R. hardwickii had viral reads homologous with genus Hepatovirus. Based on viral reads obtained, we designed two consensus PCR assays targeting a partial region of 5' NCR (356 nt) and VP2 (261 nt). 5' NCR clones showed 99.3% nt identity and VP2 clones showed 98% nt and 100% aa identity among 6 positive samples (accession # MH367852-MH367863). We sequenced the complete genome of the PCR positive sample with the highest product signal (KSA-215, Accession # KX420952) using a combination of HTS data, 5'/3' RACE and gap-filling PCRs. The KSA-215 hepatovirus genome was 7473 nt long with a single ORF encoding a 2229 aa long polyprotein. The genomic organization of KSA-215 hepatovirus was similar to those of other reported hepatoviruses [36, 37] (Fig 5) and consisted of a 5' NCR, a polyprotein (VP4-VP2-VP3-VP1-2A-2B-2C-3A-3B-3C-3D proteins) and 3' NCR with a poly 'A' tail ( Fig 5) . The KSA-215 hepatovirus showed 77% nt identity and 82.5% aa homology with a recently discovered hepatovirus identified in Hipposideros armiger bats from China [36] (Fig 5) . The most similar human hepatovirus (acc. no. AAA45465.1) showed 63% nt and 74% aa identity with the KSA-215 hepatovirus. Phylogenetic analysis using complete polyprotein sequence of KSA-215 bat hepatovirus and other hepatoviruses revealed that the KSA-215 bat hepatovirus clusters with other bat and hedgehog hepatoviruses (Fig 5) . Human and simian origin hepatoviruses formed a separate clade. Polyprotein sequences from KSA-215, bat hepatovirus (Bat-HepV, acc. no. MG559674), the closest human hepatovirus (acc. no. LC035020) and phopivirus (acc. no. KR703607) were analyzed using the recombination RNAlysis tool (RAT) (Fig 5) . This analysis revealed that the KSA-215 bat hepatovirus was most similar to bat-hepatovirus through the polyprotein and had no evidence of recombination (Fig 5) . B) Teschoviruses. Suids (domestic pigs and wild relatives) are the only known natural hosts of teschoviruses. In four E. helvum fecal samples, viral reads revealed aa homology to porcine teschovirus. KSA-412 has a 3167 nt contig with a 971 aa sequence in the putative polyprotein that has only 47% aa homology to other known teschoviruses. When placed in the phylogenetic context of the picornavirus family (Fig 5) , KSA-412 teschovirus clusters with the teschoviruses and hungaroviruses; encephalomyocarditis and erboviruses remaining as outgroups. This virus likely represents a new genus within the Picornaviridae. C) Parechoviruses. Parechovirus is another genus in the family Picornaviridae. Approximately 10% of total Picornavirales reads were similar to parechoviruses (21-86% at the nt level, 30-90% at the aa level), and 11% were most similar to Ljungan viruses (26-88% at the nt level, 31-95% at the aa, S3 Fig-Krona) . We did not recover complete viral genomic sequence from any sample; however, a 1080 nt parechovirus contig was recovered from E. helvum (KSA403). This fragment encoded 360 aa of polyprotein corresponding to the 3A and peptidase C3 proteins. The KSA-403 parechovirus had 52% aa homology with a bat parechovirus (crohivirus) and 40% aa homology with a ferret parechovirus. The pairwise phylogenetic analysis of the KSA-403 parechovirus partial polyprotein with the corresponding protein regions of other parechoviruses is shown in phylogenetic Fig 6. Based on criteria established by the Picornavirus Study Group of the International Committee for Taxonomy of Viruses whereby members of the same species of the Parechovirus genus share > 70% aa identity in the polyprotein region, KSA-403 parechovirus appears to represent a new species in the Parechovirus genus, Picornaviridae family (Fig 5) .",

Twenty-seven percent of dsRNA reads were similar to sequences from family Reoviridae; the remainder matched most closely with plant, bacterial, fungal or insect dsRNA viruses including drosophila A virus, circulifer tenellus virus 1, spissistilus festinus virus, partitivirus, totivirus, unclassified partitiviridae, unclassified birnaviridae, lentinula edodes helical virus and picobirnavirus (Fig 2) . Approximately 2% of dsRNA sequences had nt similarity with rotaviruses. Five fecal samples from E. helvum (n = 3) and R. hardwicki and T. perforatus (each n = 1) had rotavirus A (RVA) reads. Based on these reads, we designed a consensus VP1 PCR assay to test for presence of bat RVA sequences. We detected 5 VP1 amplification products that had >99% nt identity with one another and 96-97% nt and 98% aa homology with a recently discovered Rotavirus A sequence (Bat-wt/CMR/BatLy03/2014/G25P43, acc. no. KX268776) from E. helvum bats in Cameroon [10] . We recovered a complete RVA genome from an E. helvum sample (KSA-402) using HTS data, 5'/3' RACE and gap filling PCR. The KSA-402 RVA genome consisted of 11 dsRNA fragments ranging in size from 528 bp to 3267 bp (S1 Table) . Stoichiometric analyses based on Sybrgreen realtime assays for each of the 11 individual RNA segments indicated that the number of RNA copies per reaction was similar for each segment (S3 Fig and S2 Table) . These findings are consistent with the presence of a single reovirus [42] . VP7 segment of KSA-402 RVA showed 83% nt homology with the VP7 segment of Bat-wt/CMR/BatLy03/2014/G25P43. The remaining 10 segments showed 97-100% nt homology with Bat-wt/CMR/BatLy03/2014/G25P43 (acc. no. KX268777-KX268786). Whereas KSA-402 RVA is also similar to other bat rotaviruses (bat/4852/Kenya/2007 for the VP2, VP6, VP7, NSP2, NSP3, and NSP5 segments), the VP1, VP3, VP4, NSP1, NSP4 segments are similar to a diverse array of mammalian RVAs: VP1 had 79% aa similarity with a human rotavirus (genotype G10P/11) from India; VP3 had 74% aa identity with a Nigerian-origin cow rotavirus (genotype G8P); VP4 had 76% aa homology with a Nigerian-origin human rotavirus (genotype G8P); NSP4 had 74% aa level homology with a human rotavirus (genotype B10); and NSP1 had 36% aa homology with human rotavirus (genotype B10) (S1 Table) . Five of eleven KSA-402 rotavirus segments had less than 80% aa homology to known human rotaviruses; our findings are compatible with the discovery of a new rotavirus genotype [43] .",

According to ICTV guidelines, EhPyV-3 meets criteria for classification as a new species [44] . Phylogenetic analysis of the VP1 protein places EhPyV-3 in a well-supported clade (99% bootstrap nodal support) with Pomona leaf-nosed bat associated polyomavirus (Fig 7) .

MERS-CoV continues to cause morbidity and mortality chiefly in the Middle East and in travelers returning from the Middle East [51] . While primary human cases of MERS-CoV are often associated with epidemiological exposure to infected dromedary camels [52, 53] , phylogenetic analyses and the global distribution of MERS-CoV related viruses in bats suggests that they were likely an original source of spillover to camels [54, 55] .",

The ME Hepe-Astrovirus from R. hardwickii (KSA 239) showed 63-65% aa homology with Hepe-Astroviruses from E. helvum (KSA 403, and KSA 410). E. helvum and R. hardwickii are phylogenetically and ecologically distinct bat species: E. helvum is a large widely roaming frugivorous bat that roost on trees while R. hardwickii is an insectivorous cave-roosting bat. These viruses have~42-53% nt sequence identity to unpublished Bastroviruses from rats, pigs and bats from Vietnam, and the Bastro-like virus recently discovered in E. helvum bats that has been described as a novel astrovirus [9] . Whereas the ME Hepe-Astrovirus ORF1 is most homologous to hepeviruses, its ORF2 is most homologous to astroviruses (Fig 3B) . Astroviruses have three overlapping ORFs; ORF1a, ORF1b and ORF2. In contrast, ME Hepe-Astroviruses have a genomic organization more similar to Hepeviridae: the ORF1 and ORF2 are non-overlapping but ORF3 is overlapping with ORF2 ( Fig 3A) . All three ME Hepe-Astroviruses identified in this study have a 10-nt long non-coding region between ORF1 and ORF2. The ME Hepe-Astrovirus ORF3 is characteristic of the Hepeviridae family, but not of the Astroviridae family [56] . Dryden et al. proposed a phylogenetic relationship between the Astroviridae and Hepeviridae viral families based on the structural similarities between immature human Astrovirus and hepatitis E like particles [57] . The ORF2 capsid protein of ME Hepe-Astroviruses shares very low aa identity with the hepeviruses, while the ORF1 protein showed very low aa similarity to astroviruses. The ORF1 non-structural protein in ME Hepe-Astroviruses contains functional domains of Hepeviridae and the phylogenetic and genomic analysis of the ME Hepe-Astroviruses consist with recombination events for previously reported bastroviruses [9, 34] . Thus, like bastroviruses, ME Hepe-Astrovirus sequences also support the argument for a common ancestor between the Astroviridae and Hepeviridae families. We also discovered five bat astroviruses. The majority of astroviruses found in T. perforatus bats from KSA are homologous to bat astroviruses discovered in T. perforatus bats from China. However, we also found an astrovirus in E. helvum [KSA-419] that was more closely related to bovine astroviruses.",

The KSA-215 hepatovirus showed 77% nt identity and 82.5% aa homology with a recently discovered Hipposideros armiger bat hepatovirus from China, ( Fig  5A) . The closest human hepatovirus (acc. no. AAA45465.1) shared 63% nt and 74% aa identity with the KSA-215 hepatovirus. R. hardwickii and H. armiger bat species have no geographical range overlap and are from two divergent families, however homology between hepatoviruses found in these two species indicates a recent common ancestor or a wider viral host range that involves intermediate bridge hosts. Suids (domestic and wild pigs) are the only known natural hosts of teschoviruses [58] . However, we identified viral reads homologous to porcine teschoviruses in four E. helvum bats (KSA-412). We speculate that the bat teschovirus detected in KSA-412 will ultimately be described as representing a new genus within the Picornaviridae. Based on criteria established by the Picornavirus Study Group of the International Committee for Taxonomy of Viruses, KSA-403 parechovirus (bat crohivirus) also appears to represent a new species in the Picornaviridae family. Three betacoronaviruses from E. helvum bats were more than 98% homologous at the nt level with a R. aegyptiacus bat betacoronavirus 2d from China (bat coronavirus HKU9-1, acc. no, NC009021).

These data suggest an underappreciated diversity of polyomaviruses remains to be discovered in bats sampled from intermediate geographical locations, including wide swaths of Western Asia that remain relatively unexplored. The discovery of near complete genomes for four papillomaviruses, including three from T. perforatus, demonstrates co-circulation of multiple genotypes in a localized region of KSA, and expands the collection of the highly diverse Papillomaviridae viral family.
