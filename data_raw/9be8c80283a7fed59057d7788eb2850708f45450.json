Silver nanoparticles were synthesized, via sodium citrate and silver nitrate addition into a boiling aqueous solution of curcumin, monomers and surfactant. curcumin and sodium citrate promoted silver nucleation, acting as reducing and stabilizing agents. these curcumin-capped Agnps enabled, after adding the radical polymerization initiator, the assembling of the growing polymer chains around the hydrophobic Agnp surface. the resultant core-doped shell nanohybrids exhibit plasmonic, luminescent and volume thermoresponsive properties, with improved possibilities to be used as successful therapeutic platforms. In fact, the possibility to nanoconfine the synergistic antioxidant, antiviral, antibacterial features of silver and curcumin in one bioavailable hybrid paves the way to promising applications in the biomedical field.",

However to achieve polymer coating with tunable thickness, polymerization in heterogeneous media, as free radical precipitation polymerization (FRPP) is the most widely choice 7,8 . Since this technique relies on the precipitation of water insoluble growing polymer chain, a previous surface preparation of metal NP is required.

Therefore a variety of strategies can be found in the literature, mainly for gold 7, 8, [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] , whereas works focused on achieving silver@polymer core-shell nanogels are scarce; despite the reliable properties of silver NPs in applications as ultrasensitive analysis of molecules through Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) 2,16 , catalysis 17 , cancer cell imaging 16,18 and other applications related to their antimicrobial properties 19 .",

Previous backgrounds evidenced the curcumin ability to reduce Ag + and Au 3+ ions to silver 20-22 and gold 23 nanoparticles, without any other additional reductant or in the presence of citrate and CTBA to modulate NP shape 24 . Thus, Kundu and Nithiyanantham 20 , in a pioneer work, were able to synthesize different shapes of AgNP (spheres, nanowires and anisotropic nanoflakes) by tuning the molar ratio of curcumin to AgNO 3 . Nevertheless, even though the reductant ability of curcumin has been already reported, it should be noted that, as far as we know, none has postulated that hydrophobic curcumin presence nearby metal surface may facilitate polymer self-assembling during post-crosslinking polymerization. In addition, by considering the antioxidant properties of this natural phenolic compound, our curcumin-promoted Ag@nanogel hybrid system will state a double benefit arising from the biomedical properties of curcumin itself, as antibacterial, self-healing 25,26 , antiviral 27 and anti-inflammatory 28 ; and from the antibacterial 19 synergistic effect and remarkable antiviral 29 activity of particles comprising silver nanoparticles and curcumin in one hybrid. Moreover, encapsulation of curcumin in the hydrophobic polymer shell will increase curcumin bioavailability protecting curcumin from hydrolytic degradation 30 , since this is the main limitation for its therapeutic applications. experimental Materials.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were recorded with a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) Hitachi SU-8000 operated at 30 kV in transmitted electron imaging mode (S-TEM). Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis to determine the elemental composition of the hybrid samples was performed using a Bruker Nano with X-Flash Detector 5030 coupled to the SEM. Data were recorded at an accelerating voltage of 15 kV. The progress of sample purification by centrifugation was verified by UV-Vis spectroscopy (NanoDrop One Thermo-Scientific spectrometer). The centrifugation was performed by refrigerating micro centrifuge 5430 R (Eppendorf \u2122 ) to obtain Ag@cur-G and cur-G nanoparticle pellets.",

            "text": "AgNPs synthesis (outlined in Fig. 1B ) was completed at two different temperatures, 90 \u00b0C and 100 \u00b0C (series -A and -B in Table 1 , respectively). After 15 min of reaction, the flask was removed from the silicon bath and allowed to cool to room temperature. The as-synthesized silver nanocores had an average size around 60 nm (90 \u00b0C, series -A) and 40 nm (100 \u00b0C, series B) in diameter, respectively. To elucidate the role of curcumin as stabilizing agent, the sample obtained in this first step was purified by centrifugation to eliminate the excess of reagents that are not protecting the silver core. The presence of curcumin close to the AgNP surface, attained in this first step, was confirmed by ATR-FTIR spectroscopy (Fig. S1 ). As it can be observed in this Figure, the spectrum corresponding to Ag@cur (green line) is very similar to that of curcumin (blue line). The most prominent vibration band at \u223c1510 cm \u22121 assigned to highly mixed vibration including C=O stretching 35 appears in both spectra as well as other characteristic vibration bands of curcumin at 1626 cm \u22121 (mixed C=C and C=O stretching), 1429 cm \u22121 (deformation of CH 3 ), 1271 cm \u22121 (deformation of phenyl rings), 817 cm \u22121 (C-H out-of-plane aromatic motions). In this Fig. S1 , spectra corresponding to sodium citrate and Ag@citrate NPs are also displayed. As it can be seen, two strong bands corresponding to the asymmetric and symmetric stretching of CO 2 \u2212 groups at 1562 cm \u22121 and at 1387 cm \u22121 , respectively appear with nearly similar intensity for the free sodium citrate spectrum (violet line); whereas for Ag@citrate spectrum (orange line), the most prominent band corresponds to the symmetric stretch at 1362 cm \u22121 . In the spectrum corresponding to Ag@cur NPs (green line), this vibration band at 1362 cm \u22121 is www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ absent and only the asymmetric stretching (\u223c 1590 cm \u22121 ) can be hardly intuited overlapped with vibration bands from curcumin (blue line); these facts indicate that the affinity of sodium citrate for the silver surface is lower than that of curcumin. In addition, the bands attributed to C-H (2937-2948 cm \u22121 ) and C=O stretching vibrations of MEO 2 MA appear very weak, also suggesting a low interaction of the monomer with the silver surface. Figure 1C outlines the polymer shell preparation. This second step was done without previous Ag@cur sample purification. For the purpose of thermoresponsive-shell polymerization, Ag@cur was first flushed with N 2 for 20 min at the lowest possible temperature (room temperature), with the aim of reducing water evaporation during nitrogen flow. Subsequently, APS initiator was added and incubated for 2 h in a closed flask under stirring at 70 \u00b0C. The presence of hydrophobic curcumin nearby the metallic surface led to precipitation-polymerization of P(MEO 2 MA) around the AgNPs previously formed (Fig. 1B,C) ; and the resulting Ag@cur-P(MEO 2 MA) nanoparticles were born negatively charged due to the persulfate groups from the APS initiator, which promotes their colloidal stability. The successful encapsulation of Ag@cur NPs within P(MEO 2 MA) nanogels can be anticipated by the ATR-FTIR spectrum shown in Fig. S1 corresponding to f4 of Ag@cur-G3B sample (Table 1) , which displays typical vibration bands attributed to both curcumin and P(MEO 2 MA). It should be noted that an attempt to encapsulate AgNPs synthesized solely using sodium citrate caused irreversible aggregation in the second polymerization step (Fig. S2 ). This fact evidences the role of hydrophobic curcumin to provide both a protection to the AgNPs and a good interface between the polymer and the metal surface.",

Surprisingly, when comparing both cur-G and Ag@cur-G NPs, for similar curcumin/polymer ratios (Tables 1 and 2 ), qualitative differences were observed in their respective spectra evolution (Fig. 3) . Consistently with curcumin data (Tables 1 and 2) , curcumin related vibration bands seemed to be differently affected by its content. Cur-G series exhibited an increase tendency of intensity (Fig. 3A,B) ; whereas Ag@cur-G series (Fig. 3C,D) barely varied. This observation could be explained through the key-implication of curcumin in our nuclei-growth approach (Fig. 1) which determines, at the end, the morphology of Ag@cur-G nanohybrids. In fact, the specific silver-nucleation strategy (Fig. 1B) makes feasible that certain amount of curcumin be preferably confined at the metal surface, being subsequently enclosed at higher concentration during P(MEO 2 MA) polymer growing shell onto silver core NPs (Ag@cur-G) than during polymer assembling along silver-free P(MEO 2 MA) nanogels formation (cur-G).",

A mere glance to S-TEM pictures revealed almost concentric nanostructuration of polymer shell coverage around metal core for both series of nanohybrids. Both series were synthesized with similar curcumin/polymer ratios (3.80, 3.15, 2.10 and 1.05 wt%, Table 1 ). The resultant mean values of Ag-core diameter (60 nm at 90 \u00b0C and 40 nm at 100 \u00b0C) for both series are collected in Table 1 . These differences can be attributed to the faster nucleation rate with increasing temperature that leads to smaller NPs. EDX spectra in Fig. S3 confirm the presence of Ag in two representative hybrid samples with 60 nm (Ag@cur-G4A) and 40 nm (Ag@cur-G4B) core diameter, the determined elemental composition is in agreement with ther core size of both nanohybrids.

In fact, these wavelengths variations resulted from changes of refractive index of the medium surrounding the metal surface, due to polymer/curcumin reorganization around the two different Ag-core sizes. Correlative changes in color were also observed when different sizes of metal core were used by keeping all the other reaction parameters constant (Table 1 and UV-Vis insets of Fig. 4 ). Larger silver NPs exhibited a visual reddish color and a wavelength red-shift. In fact, the \u03bb max for Ag@citrate of 40 and 60 nm are 412 and 431 nm respectively 36 , so that red shifts of about 20-30 nm collected in Table 1 are in accordance to the polymer coating with shell thickness values shown in Table 1 .",

At this time, 800 \u03bcL of a citrate solution 0.12 M was added to the reaction mixture instead of 0.029 M, in the presence of 3.8 wt% of curcumin, at 100 \u00b0C. As expected, it resulted in two highly differentiated Ag-core populations (30 nm and 5 nm) shown in Fig. S4 . Interestingly, AgNPs (\u223c5 nm) were mostly formed at the limit around the polymeric vesicle boundary but also closely packed inside polymer networking-shell of 250 nm of size (Fig. S4 ). This behavior is attributed to the high nucleation of the nanoparticles due to the high concentration of citrate that causes a greater ion exchange and increases the total ionic strength in the solution, promoting the formation of particle agglomerates in some cases. Then, in the regime of low curcumin concentration, phase separation can take place, being the smallest spherical cores produced by sodium citrate and the almost rod-like AgNPs promoted by curcumin. So, we hypothesize that an appropriate balance among both reducing agents (sodium citrate and curcumin) is needed to obtain more uniform AgNP population. thermoresponsive properties. Micro/nanogels of crosslinked P(MEO 2 MA) in aqueous solution exhibit a reversible volume decrease when raising temperature above the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of linear P(MEO 2 MA). This temperature is known as temperature-induced volume phase transition (VPTT) which can be followed by measuring the particle hydrodynamic size by DLS. In Fig. 5 representative Z-average vs temperature curves are shown for the series of Ag@cur-G#B NPs synthesized at 100 \u00b0C ( Fig. 5Ai and Table 1 ) and of the cur-G# nanogels (Fig. 5Aii and Table 2 ). As can be observed the VPTT values, calculated from the inflection www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ point of the curve (Fig. 5Ai) , are around 20 \u00b0C for the two hybrid NPs series (Ag@cur-G, Table 1 ), showing no dependence on the curcumin content. These results are in good agreement with the ATR-FTIR spectra (Fig. 3) which indicated rather similar curcumin content for Ag@cur-G hybrids NPs. On the contrary, cur-G nanogels (Fig. 5Aii ) exhibit slightly decreasing VPTT values with increasing the curcumin content (Table 2 ). This implication is clearly evidenced at low temperature, where the decrease of the nanogel size is affected by the hydrophobicity feature of curcumin (Fig. 5Aii) .",

Nevertheless, in the present investigation, we only observed this temperature-dependent effect on nanoparticles without curcumin (G0 in Fig. 5Bi) . Indeed, hybrid NPs exhibited a tunable \u03b6-potential temperature-dependent behavior before (Ag@ cur) and after polymerization (Ag@cur-G). So, initial \u03b6-potential diminution values with increasing temperature (Fig. 5Bii ) rapidly transited to high and almost invariant \u03b6-potential values with temperature (Fig. 5Biii) as polymerization progressed.

Figure 5C displays representative UV-Vis spectra (below and above VPTT) for two nanohybrid samples with different core size (Ag60nm@cur-G4A, Fig. 5Ci and Ag40nm@ cur-G4B, Fig. 5Cii ) and nanogels (cur-G4, Fig. 5Ciii ) synthesized with 3.8 wt% of curcumin content (Table 1 ). In UV-Vis absorbance spectra, SPR band of the nanohybrid with a higher silver diameter (Fig. 5Ci) red-shifted while broadening considerably with respect to SPR band of the nanohybrid with a smaller silver diameter (Fig. 5Cii) . Obviously, the SPR band position and width was affected by the core-size and the temperature-induced variation of the electromagnetic field in its neighboring environment. The cur-G4 sample containing silver-free nanogel (Fig. 5Ciii) only showed the curcumin effect on nanogel swelling behavior which determines the refractive index of the polymer-gel with the surrounding aqueous medium. In addition, a reversible red-blue shift was observed, when the temperature increase-decrease the VPTT of the polymer shell (Fig. 5) . When the external temperature rises above the VPTT, the nanogel shell expels water dictated by the strengthening of hydrophobic interactions giving rise to (i) a decrease of the polymer shell thickness and (ii) an increase of the refractive index. At that point, the effect of refractive index augmentation exceeds to that of the shell thickness diminution; therefore a red-shift should be observed above the VPTT for plasmonic-core@thermoresponsive-shell nanohybrids. Fig. 5Ci and 4Cii illustrate this behavior for our Ag-based thermoresponsive-polymer (core@shell) hybrid NPs which correlates well with similar results reported for Au-core based thermoresponsive core@shell nanogels 38 .",

            "text": "Furthermore, the change of the SPR maximum with temperature is more pronounced for larger silver core (Fig. 5Ci) as previously observed for core-shell nanohybrids with gold core 15 . Indeed for the nanohybrids with silver core of 60 nm (series Ag@cur-G#A), the \u0394\u03bbLSPR max is about 6-10 nm whereas for the 40 nm silver core ones (series Ag@cur-G#B) the \u0394\u03bbLSPR max is about 2-4 nm ( Table 1 ). The cur-G4 nanogel sample, without metallic core intervention (Fig. 4Ciii) , exhibits no so remarkable \u03bb max absorption change with temperature, at similar curcumin/polymer ratio. www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Luminescent properties. Curcumin is a tautomeric compound that can occur in diketo and keto-enol forms which ratio strongly varies with the solvent. According to Manolova et al. 39 , in solvents as ethanol, only the enol-keto tautomer is present; whereas the addition of water leads to appearance of a new spectral band (about 350 nm), which was attributed to the diketo tautomeric form. The keto-enol form, due to a strong intramolecular hydrogen bond, undergoes transformation into a totally delocalized \u03c0-system. Due to the hydrophobic character of curcumin, it presents luminescence properties in organic solvents but it is almost non-fluorescent in aqueous solution. However, by complexation through hydrophobic interactions with proteins 40 or with amphiphilic polymers as pluronic 41 , or encapsulating curcumin in hydrophobic polymer nanoparticles 30 , fluorescence enhancement in aqueous medium has been reported. Previous to the luminescence investigation of the Ag@cur-G hybrid NPs, we investigated the absorption and emission of curcumin encapsulated in the thermoresponsive nanogels, cur-G (Table 3 and Fig. S5 ). Hydrophobic curcumin was engulfed by thermoresponsive NPs during the polymerization process, based on the precipitation of the growing polymer at 70 \u00b0C due to its unfavorable interaction with the water solvent above LCST (Fig. 1) . Absorbance spectra for curcumin embedded in P(MEO 2 MA) nanogels (cur-G) at the polymer concentration of 1 mg mL \u22121 show an increase of intensity proportional to the curcumin concentration (Fig. S5 ). In agreement with previous reports of curcumin entrapped in hydrophobic 30 or amphiphilic block copolymers 41 , a main absorption band at 425-430 nm in addition to a shoulder about 450 nm 30 appear in Fig. S5 . Some authors attributed the signal at 430 nm to the keto-enol tautomer 39, 42 , whereas the band at 350 nm, associated to the keto form and that typically appears in water, is absent in the present case. Fig. S5 inset shows the linear dependence of the curcumin absorption maxima at 427 nm vs molar concentration of curcumin according to the Beer-Lambert law for cur-G nanogels. Table 3 ). Samples were excited at 430 nm. ( Fig. 6A emission spectra in water for the synthesized cur-G nanogels excited at 430 nm evidence remarkable luminescence due to curcumin. In Table 3 , the emission maxima (\u03bb em ) and QY, calculated with fluorescein standard, are collected. The emission maxima are about 509-515 nm in good agreement with the values reported by Banerjee et al. 30 for curcumin encapsulated in polymeric nanoparticles. The position of the emission maxima of curcumin is strongly dependent on the solvent; so by increasing the polarity from chloroform to water, the emission maximum is red-shifted and broadened from 497 nm to 550 nm 42 . Both the QY values and the emission maxima position for the present cur-G nanogels seem to indicate that curcumin is well protected by the hydrophobic environment provided by the polymer.",

In first place, analyzing the QY values collected in Table 3 , it can be seen that nanohybrids\u00b4 fluorescence values are lower than those measured for cur-G nanogels. On the other hand, for both series of Ag@cur-G hybrid NPs, an increase of luminescence with increasing of curcumin concentration is detected, in opposite to what happened in cur-G nanogels (Table 3 and Fig. 6A ). However we know that it can be an \u00a8apparent increase\u00a8 since the absorption band consideration for estimating the QY values was not properly drawn up. Note that this absorption band reflects the additive contribution from the overlapped silver and curcumin SPR bands. Then, on the basis of these considerations, at lower curcumin concentration, the real curcumin contribution to the final absorbance will be lower. The same miscalculation could arise when comparing QYs of hybrid NPs with those of polymeric nanogels, because for hybrids an important part of the absorbance arises from the SPR of AgNPs.",

Whereas, when increasing temperature, the polymer increases its hydrophobic balance, which should contribute to protect curcumin against water; nevertheless this positive effect could be overcome by the fact that after polymer collapse, curcumin can get too close to the metal surface and this effect should lead to a further emission quenching. Similar observation was reported on the strong curcumin emission-quenching for other silver NP-based hybrid systems by other authors 19,20 . conclusion In this work, we focused on the knowledge and application of one-pot protocol to obtain core-shell hybrid nanoparticles with the ability to encapsulate hydrophobic, bioactive, antioxidant, and low bioavailability molecules. The aim is to draw on the reductive capacity of some bioactive molecules as curcumin for the in situ formation of metallic NPs, meanwhile their hydrophobic character leads the polymer nanostructuration in aqueous medium in the presence of the inorganic metal-core. Therefore, new core-doped shell nanohybrids based on silver plasmonic core, thermoresponsive polymer shell and embedded luminescence and bioactive curcumin are easily obtained with potential bioapplications such as antimicrobial systems. Furthermore, polymeric nanogels encapsulating curcumin were also achieved, which luminescent properties are strongly enhanced by increasing temperature. This last property could be tuned even with the minimum ratio of bioactive compound.",
