            "text": "Genetic background may play an important role in the process of SARS-CoV infection and SARS development. We found several proteins that could interact with the nucleocapsid protein of the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV). a-2-Heremans-Schmid Glycoprotein (AHSG), which is required for macrophage deactivation by endogenous cations, is associated with inflammatory regulation. Cytochrome P450 Family 3A (CYP4F3A) is an v-oxidase that inactivates Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) in human neutrophils and the liver. We investigated the association between the polymorphisms of these two inflammationassociated genes and SARS development. The linkage disequilibrium (LD) maps of these two genes were built with Haploview using data on CHB+JPT (version 2) from the HapMap. A total of ten tag SNPs were selected and genotyped. In the Guangzhou cohort study, after adjusting for age and sex, two AHSG SNPs and one CYP4F3 SNP were found to be associated with SARS susceptibility: rs2248690 (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 2.42; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.30-4.51); rs4917 (AOR 1.84; 95% CI 1.02-3.34); and rs3794987 (AOR 2.01; 95% CI 1.10-3.68). To further validate the association, the ten tag SNPs were genotyped in the Beijing cohort. After adjusting for age and sex, only rs2248690 (AOR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.30-2.04) was found to be associated with SARS susceptibility. The combined analysis of the two studies confirmed tag SNP rs2248690 in AHSG as a susceptibility variant (AOR 1.70; 95% CI 1.37-2.09). The statistical analysis of the rs2248690 genotype data among the patients and healthy controls in the HCW cohort, who were all similarly exposed to the SARS virus, also supported the findings. Further, the SNP rs2248690 affected the transcriptional activity of the AHSG promoter and thus regulated the AHSG serum level. Therefore, our study has demonstrated that the AA genotype of rs2268690, which leads to a higher AHSG serum concentration, was significantly associated with protection against SARS development.",

            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an acute respiratory disease resulting from the infection of a previously undescribed coronavirus (SARS-CoV) that spreads through airborne transmission [1] [2] [3] . Rapid transmission, high infectivity and unpredictable clinical progression with a fatality ratio of approximately 9.6% made SARS a global threat in 2003. However, the pathogenesis of this infectious agent is still not fully understood. Asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic SARS-CoV infections, which represent more than 10% of all SARS-CoV infections, have been reported in many places, including Hong Kong, Taiwan, Guangdong Province of China, and Singapore [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . Clinical and laboratory investigations have shown that the host genetic background is an important factor that determines the susceptibility to and pathogenicity of SARS infection. We have demonstrated that genetic haplotypes associated with low serum mannose-binding lectin (MBL) are also associated with SARS, and our findings were confirmed by other independent studies [9, 10] . Other susceptible genes, including chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 5 (CCL5) [11] , interferon gamma (IFN c) [12] , 29-59 oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS) and myxovirus resistance 1 (MX1) [13] , have also been reported. The involvement of the major histocompatibility complex class I gene (HLA) [14] [15] [16] and the L-SIGN gene (CLEC4M) [17] [18] [19] are still disputed.",

The pairwise tagging algorithm implemented in the Tagger program of Haploview (r 2 threshold was 0.8) was used to select the tag SNPs for assessment. SNPs that were reported to affect the AHSG level or that had been associated with other diseases were also selected. Finally, we chose to genotype rs2248690 (59-flanking region), rs2077119 (59-flanking region), rs4917 (exon 6), rs2593813 (intron 1) and rs4918 (exon 7) in the AHSG gene. The genotyping and statistical results are presented in Table S1 and Table S2 under the dominant and additive models, respectively. The genotyping and statistical analyses of the Guangzhou non-HCW population revealed that two tag SNPs were associated with SARS. The rs2248690 TT/AT genotype was more associated with increased susceptibility to SARS than the AA genotype (OR = 2.42; 95% CI, 1.30-4.51; Table 2 and Table S1 ). The TT/CT genotype of rs4917 was associated with an increased possibility of developing clinically apparent SARS (OR = 1.84; 95% CI, 1.02-3.34; Table 3 and Table S1 ). In the validation study (Beijing population), only the rs2248690 polymorphism was significantly associated with SARS development (relative to the TT/AT genotype, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.30-2.04; Table 2 and Table S1 ). Because the Beijing and Guangzhou sample groups had homogenous demographic and genetic parameters (Han Chinese), a joint analysis was performed. The combined analysis of the two studies under the dominant model is presented in Table S3 . After combining data from the two cohorts, the TT/AT genotype of rs2248690 had a frequency of 27.5% in the control population and a significantly higher frequency of 39.1% in the SARS patients (OR = 1.70; 95% CI, 1.37-2.09; Table 2 and Table S3 ). After adjusting for sex and age, a non-significant association was observed between rs4917 and SARS susceptibility (OR = 1.22; 95% CI, 1.02-1.54; P = 0.08). Because rs4917 and rs2248690 are in high linkage disequilibrium (0.62), the association between rs4917 and SARS can be easily understood. A logistic regression analysis was applied to adjust the linkage between rs4917 and rs2248690. The result showed that rs2248690 was associated with SARS development (OR = 1.58; 95% CI, 1.16-2.17; p = 0.004), Figure 1 . The nucleocapsid protein associates with serum AHSG. Human serum (100 ml) was incubated with agarose beads conjugated to GST-N protein or GST at 4uC for 2 h. The beads were washed three times with PBS supplemented with 0.1% NP40. The bound proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot with anti-AHSG antibody. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0023730.g001 while rs4917 was not associated with SARS (p = 0.54). To remove the influence of the exposure factor to SARS infection and risk, cases and controls from the HCW population were genotyped at rs2248690. Though the P-value is higher than 0.05, the distribution of different genotypes between the HCW cases and HCW controls is similar to the distribution between the non-HCW cases and non-HCW controls with a difference of approximately 10%. The statistical analysis of the rs2248690 genotype data from all cases and HCW controls confirmed this finding (OR = 1.68; 95% CI, 1.38-2.06; Table 4 ). We tested the deviation from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in both cases and controls, within each cohort and within the overall study population; we found that there was no statistically significant deviation from equilibrium for any SNP.",

However, no convincing multivariate analysis has been performed to identify the most associated variants. To uncover potential functional changes associated with the AHSG rs2248690 polymorphism, 192 healthy subjects from Beijing were genotyped, and their AHSG serum concentrations were determined. As expected, there was an association between the rs2248690 genotype and the AHSG serum concentrations ( Table 5 ). The order of the average AHSG serum concentrations was as follows: 2799AA .2799AT .2799TT. Consistently, rs4917 and rs4918 were associated with different serum levels of AHSG. Furthermore, a stepwise regression analysis clearly showed that rs2248690 was an independent contributor to the variability in AHSG serum concentration ( Table 5 ).

            "text": "AHSG is a circulating negative inflammatory acute-phase glycoprotein. The pathophysiological sequence of infection is mediated by macrophage-derived pro-inflammatory cytokines. The current literature suggests that the availability of AHSG to macrophages is critical in regulating the innate immune response in tissue injury and infection because AHSG is required for macrophage deactivation by endogenous cations [37] . Decreased levels of human fetuin have been observed in patients with acute lymphocytic Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, rheuma- toid arthritis, acute alcoholic hepatitis and trauma [28, [38] [39] [40] [41] . Under conditions where macrophage-associated fetuin levels are decreased, macrophage deactivation by endogenous counterregulators may be impaired, leading to the uncontrolled overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines [29, 38] . A recent work showed that mice deficient in AHSG are hypersensitive to LPS-induced inflammation [27] . Because the development of SARS is always associated with a severe inflammatory reaction, low AHSG serum levels could result in severe symptoms after a SARS-CoV infection. Considering that there might be many asymptomatic SARS-CoV infections in the control group, it is plausible that relatively higher serum concentrations of AHSG can orchestrate an unimpaired counter-regulation between macrophage deactivation and endogenous pro-inflammatory cytokines. Therefore, viruses can be cleared without severe inflammation and obvious symptoms. However, we observed that AHSG interacts with the SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein (Figure 1) , which may induce massive pro-inflammatory cytokine production upon infection [21] . AHSG may neutralize the pro-inflammatory effect of the SARS nucleocapsid protein because AHSG is so abundant in the serum (0.2-0.55 mg/ml). Considering that AHSG is a circulating glycoprotein synthesized in human liver tissue and the nucleocapsid protein is ''wrapped'' by membrane proteins in the SARS-CoV virion, interactions between AHSG and the nucleocapsid protein are less likely to affect the viral infectivity and replication of the SARS-CoV. To our knowledge, this is the first study reporting an association of AHSG polymorphisms with SARS. Individuals with polymorphisms that contribute to high concentrations of AHSG may be less likely to develop SARS. These findings improve our understanding of SARS pathogenesis and provide a genetic basis for SARS prognosis. Future studies should further investigate the mechanisms of AHSG-based resistance to SARS and other infectious diseases.",

Each SNE primer contained 1 of the 20 oligonucleotide tags at its 59 end, and the SNE reactions were performed in 12-plex. The microarray plate was imaged using a SNP scope reader (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA). The twocolor system allowed the detection of the SNP by comparing the signals from the two fluorescent dyes. The image signals were subsequently transferred to genotyping software that translated the images of the arrays into genotype calls.
