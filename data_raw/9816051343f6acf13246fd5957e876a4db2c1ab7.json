This analysis is part of the World Health Organization Global Observatory on Health Research and Development's work with the overall aim to enable evidence-informed deliberations and decisions on new investments in health research and development. The analysis expands on the interactive data visualisations of these data on the Observatory's website and describes the methods used to enable the categorisation of grants by health categories using automated data-mining techniques. Methods: Grants data were extracted from the World RePORT platform for 2016, the most recent year with data from all funders. A data-mining algorithm was developed in Java to categorise grants by health category. The analysis explored the distribution of grants by funder, recipient country and organisation, type of grant, health category, average grant duration, and the nature of collaborations between recipients of direct grants and the institutions they collaborated with. Results: Out of a total of 69,420 grants in 2016, the United States of America's National Institutes of Health funded the greatest number of grants (52,928; 76%) and had the longest average grant duration (6 years and 10 months). Grants for research constituted 70.4% (48,879) of all types of grants, followed by grants for training (13,008; 18.7%) and meetings (2907; 4.2%). Of grant recipients by income group, low-income countries received only 0.2% (165) of all grants. Almost three-quarters of all grants were for non-communicable diseases (72%; 40,035), followed by communicable, maternal, perinatal and nutritional conditions (20%; 11,123), and injuries (6%; 3056). Only 1.1% of grants were for neglected tropical diseases and 0.4% for priority diseases on the WHO list of highly infectious (R&D blueprint) pathogens. Conclusions: The findings highlight the importance of considering funding decisions by other actors in future health research and capacity-strengthening decisions. This will not only improve efficiency and equity in allocating scarce resources but will also allow informed investment decisions that aim to support research on public health needs and neglected areas.",

The lists we retrieved generally included long lists of keywords not appearing to belong to an intentional classification of projects by type (e.g. outcomes, software, database, evaluation, anthropology). We therefore developed our own synonyms list to capture the various terms used to refer to the following categories that emerged from the data: core institutional funding, training (e.g. postgraduate degrees), capacity strengthening (e.g. fellowship, prize), meetings and networking. All other grants falling outside of these categories were classified as research. The categories and list of synonyms for each category were refined and expanded in various iterations during data cleaning and analysis. This was done by reviewing the grant titles and searching for various ways of expressing the category in a snowball manner, including language variations. The search continued until no further synonyms were found.",

The algorithm stopped when the first match closer to the beginning of the text field was found. This avoids the assignment of more than one disease. This method was developed and verified using at least five random samples of 100 records from the data to test and refine the comprehensiveness of the synonyms list, which confirmed that the primary disease focus of the grant was almost always the one first mentioned in the text-based field. This was particularly consistent in the title field.
