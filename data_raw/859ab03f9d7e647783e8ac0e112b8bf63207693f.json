            "text": "In the field of host-guest chemistry, some of the most widely used hosts are probably cyclodextrins (CDs). As CDs are able to increase the water solubility of numerous drugs by inclusion into their hydrophobic cavity, they have been widespread used to develop numerous pharmaceutical formulations. Nevertheless, CDs are also able to interact with endogenous substances that originate from an organism, tissue or cell. These interactions can be useful for a vast array of topics including cholesterol manipulation, treatment of Alzheimer's disease, control of pathogens, etc. In addition, the use of natural CDs offers the great advantage of avoiding or reducing the use of common petroleum-sourced drugs. In this paper, the general features and applications of CDs have been reviewed as well as their interactions with isolated biomolecules leading to the formation of inclusion or exclusion complexes. Finally, some potential medical applications are highlighted throughout several examples.",

Between 1911 and 1935, Pringsheim and co-workers demonstrated the ability of CDs to form complexes with many organic molecules [4, 5] . Since the 1970s, the structural elucidation of the three natural CDs, \u03b1-, \u03b2-, and \u03b3-CDs composed of 6-, 7-, and 8-membered \u03b1-D-glucopyranoses linked by \u03b1-1,4 glycosidic bonds, allowed the development and the rational study of their encapsulation properties [6, 7] . As their water solubility differs significantly, a great variety of modified CDs has been developed to improve the stability and the solubility of inclusion complexes [8] [9] [10] . Nowadays, CDs are widely applied in many fields [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] due to their host-guest properties, their origins (produced from starch by enzymatic conversion), their relatively low prices, their easy modifications, their biodegradability and their low toxicity. Moreover, CDs are able to interact with a wide range of biomol-Scheme 1: Structure and conventional representation of native CDs. ecules opening the way for many biological applications. The majority of these researches are based on the ability of CDs to extract lipids from the cell membrane.

            "text": "As mentioned earlier, the ordinary starch hydrolysis (e.g., corn starch) by an enzyme (i.e., cyclodextrin glycosyl transferase, CGTase) allows the production of the native CDs [13] . To reduce the separation and the purification costs, selective \u03b1-, \u03b2and \u03b3-CGTases have been developed in the last two decades [29] . Nevertheless, the cheapest remains the \u03b2-CD whereas the most expensive is the \u03b3-CD. The molecular shape of the native CDs can be represented as a truncated cone with \"hydrophobic\" cavity which can accommodate hydrophobic compounds (Scheme 1). In aqueous solution, the complexation is enthalpically and entropically driven. In addition, complementary interactions (e.g., van der Waals forces, H-bonds, etc.) appear between the CD and the guest. The non-polar suitably-sized guest may be bound in numerous molar ratios (e.g., 1:1, 2:1, 1:2, etc.). In all cases, the knowledge of the binding constants (K ass ) is crucial because these values provide an index of host-guest binding forces. CDs can also form exclusion complexes where the CDs are bound to the guest through a H-bond network. For instance, the complexation of [PMo 12 O 40 ] anion by \u03b2-and \u03b3-CD results in a one-dimensional columnar structure through a combination of intermolecular [C\u2212H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O=Mo] and [O\u2212H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O] interactions [30] . Unfortunately, the natural CDs as well as their inclusion complexes are of limited aqueous solubility leading to their precipitation. Fortunately, native CDs are effective templates for the generation of a wide range of molecular hosts through chemical modifications.",

The native \u03b1-and \u03b2-CD, unlike \u03b3-CD, cannot be hydrolyzed by pancreatic amylases and human salivary but can be fermented by the intestinal microflora. When administered orally, native CDs and hydrophilic derivatives are not absorbed from the human gastrointestinal tract and thus making them practically nontoxic due to their high molecular mass ranging from almost 1 000 to over 2 000 g/mol and their hydrophilic nature with a significant number of H-bond donors and acceptors [39] . Indeed, CDs violate three criteria of the Lipinski's rule: i) no more than 5 H-bond donors, ii) no more than 10 H-bond acceptors, iii) a molecular mass less than 500 g/mol, and iv) an octanol-water partition coefficient (log P) not greater than 5 [40] . As these criteria apply only to absorption by passive diffusion of compounds through cell membranes, the absorption of the native CDs and their hydrophilic derivatives are not allowed in their intact form and any cellular absorption, if it occurs, is by passive transport through cytoplasmic membranes (i.e., by transporter proteins) [41] . In contrast, lipophilic derivatives (e.g., ME-\u03b2-CD) interact more readily with membranes than the hydrophilic derivatives, they cannot readily permeate cell membranes (see below) [42] . Moreover, oral administration of alkylated CD derivatives, such as ME-\u03b2-CD, is limited by its potential toxicity [43] . Indeed, ME-\u03b2-CD is partially absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract into the systemic circulation. Moreover, they have been shown to be toxic after parenteral administration. The opposite holds for hydrophilic CD derivatives, such as HP-\u03b2-CD and SBE-\u03b2-CD, which are considered safe for parenteral administration. In a general way, the \u03b3-CD, HP-\u03b2-CD and SBE-\u03b2-CD, S-\u03b2-CD and G2-\u03b2-CD appear to be globally safer than \u03b1-, \u03b2-and alkylated CDs which are less suitable for parental administration [44, 45] . Table 3 presents the pharmacokinetics and safety overview of some natural and modified CDs. When administered, natural and hydrophilic CD derivatives disappear rapidly from systemic circulation and are distributed to various tissues of the body such as kidney, liver, urinary bladder, etc. Nevertheless, they are mainly renally excreted intact.

Overt signs of acute toxicity are not apparent for CDs (i.e., no inflammatory response and no cell degeneration). They are also not genotoxic, not teratogenic or mutagenic. However, CDs affect the human organism only at extremely high concentrations. Nevertheless, the principal side effect of natural and modified CDs is probably the cell toxicity. This effect is directly correlated to their hemolytic activities. Indeed, several in vitro studies reported erythrocyte lysis although the toxicological implication in vivo is negligible. The lysis mechanism is related to their capacity to draw phospholipids and cholesterol out of the biological membrane (see below). Based on this, the complexation of endogenous substances are of potential interest for many applications.",

This property allows the formation of biological membranes. Indeed, cells and organelles membranes are composed of lipids. Lipids also provide various other biological functions, including cell signaling and storage of metabolic energy by lipogenesis. Bio-logical lipids are basically due to two types of compounds acting as \"building blocks\": ketoacyl groups and isoprene units. From this point of view, they can be divided into eight categories: fatty acids (and their derivatives: mono-, di-and triglycerides and phospholipids), acylglycerols, phosphoglycerides, sphingolipids, glycolipids and polyketides, which result from the condensation of ketoacyl groups, sterols (e.g., cholesterol) and prenols, which are produced from condensation of isoprene units [54] . These compounds can be easily included inside the CDs because they are hydrophobic or amphiphilic molecules. As mentioned earlier, and as it will become exceeding clear throughout the following sections, the majority of research involving CDs has revolved around their ability to manipulate lipid (phospholipids and cholesterol) composition in different cells [55] [56] [57] [58] . Although numerous studies deal of this topic, the mechanism of this process is poorly investigated (i.e., only the consequences of this phenomenon are reported).

            "text": "This different effect, observed for native CDs, has been explained by Ohtani et al. in 1989 [58] . As the membrane of erythrocytes is composed of proteins (43%) associated with lipids (49%) and carbohydrates (8%) and as the fraction of cholesterol is 25% of total membrane lipids [54], the proposed explanation is based on the specific interaction of natural CDs with the erythrocyte membrane components. Indeed, \u03b1-and \u03b2-CD are excellently suited to solubilize phospholipids and cholesterol, respectively, whereas \u03b3-CD is generally less lipidselective. In more detail, the CD affinity for solubilizing various lipid components of the erythrocyte membranes are in the order \u03b3-CD << \u03b2-CD < \u03b1-CD for phospholipids and \u03b1-CD < \u03b3-CD << \u03b2-CD for cholesterol [58] . These findings are corroborated by the work of Leventis and Silvius which have reported that \u03b2-and \u03b3-CD accelerate the rate of cholesterol transfer by a larger factor than they accelerate the transfer of phospholipid, whereas the opposite is true for \u03b1-CD [60] . The hemolytic properties of CDs are a general behavior not limited to human erythrocytes: All mammalian red blood cells are affected by the parent CDs. For instance, dog erythrocytes are also affected by native CDs in the order \u03b3-CD < \u03b1-CD < \u03b2-CD [61] . Thus, the magnitude of the hemolytic activity observed for dog erythrocytes is consistent with the order of magnitude of human erythrocytes (see discussion above). However, the hemolytic activity is largely influenced by the substituents attached to the CDs. The presence of hydrophilic substituents (e.g., glucosyl, 2-hydroxypropyl, 3-hydroxypropyl, maltosyl, sulfate, sulfobutyl ether, etc.) reduces the hemolytic activity in comparison with the parent CDs while the lipophilic ones (e.g., methylated CDs) demonstrate the strongest hemolytic activities [62] . As for parent CDs, these differences are ascribed to the different solubilization effects of lipid components and their sequestration in the external aqueous phase.",

            "text": "As the hemolysis is attributed to the removal of erythrocyte membrane components, particularly phospholipids and cholesterol, the value of the binding constants between CDs and lipids can be very relevant. To the author's knowledge there is only one paper in the literature that describes the binding constants between CDs (\u03b1-or \u03b3-CD) and short phospholipids (i.e., diheptanoylphosphatidylcholine, DHPC) [63] . In this study, the association constants were estimated from 1 H NMR measurements. The results proved that the K 1 values are in the order \u03b1-CD < \u03b3-CD while the K 2 values are in the order \u03b3-CD < \u03b1-CD. This behavior was attributed to the large cavity of \u03b3-CD which is able to incorporate both alkyl chains of DHPC simultaneously. In contrast, the formation of a 1:2 inclusion complex with \u03b1-CD is easier than with \u03b3-CD. These findings are corroborated by Fauvelle and co-workers who reported that \u03b1-CD has the strongest affinity to phospholipids (e.g., phosphatidylinositol) [64, 65] . In 2000, Nishijo et al. studied the interactions of various CDs with dipalmitoyl, distearoyl, and dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine liposomes. This study highlights that the liposome-CD interaction depends on the length of the fatty acid chain of the phospholipid, the cavity size, and the nature of the substituents at the CD [66] . In the literature, the binding constant between cholesterol and \u03b2-CD was estimated around 1.7 \u00d7 10 4 M \u22121 from a solubility method [67, 68] . This value proves the good stability of the inclusion complex because of the driving force of complexation: hydrophobic interaction. Despite there is no information on the binding constant observed for the inclusion of cholesterol in \u03b3-CD, the cavity internal diameter of the \u03b2-CD and its derivatives perfectly matches the size of the sterol molecules contrary to \u03b3-CD (too large) [69, 70] . Moreover, the positive correlation observed between the hemolytic activities of various modified CDs and their ability to solubilize cholesterol reveal that HP-\u03b2-CD was shown to be a more efficient cholesterol-acceptor molecule than HP-\u03b3-CD. This is apparently due to the diameter of its internal cavity that matches the size of this molecule. Finally, it is noteworthy that all CDs lose their abilities to induce hemolysis, when their cavities are occupied with guest molecules due to a reduced interaction with the erythrocyte membranes [71] . All these observations support the aforementioned affinities of \u03b1-CD for phospholipids and of \u03b2-CD for cholesterol.",

As expected, lipid effluxes on the brain capillary endothelial cells in the presence of native CDs reveal that \u03b1-CD extracts only phospholipids whereas \u03b2-CD is able to remove phospholipids and cholesterol. In contrast, \u03b3-CD is less lipid-selective than the other native CDs. This differential effect compared to the order of magnitude of hemolytic activity (\u03b3-CD < \u03b1-CD < \u03b2-CD) could be ascribed to the lower cholesterol content in blood-brain barrier cells compared to erythrocytes. Indeed, the cholesterol fraction is markedly higher in erythrocytes than in other cells. As for hemolysis, the presence of hydrophilic substituents (e.g., 2-hydroxypropyl and sulfobutyl ether) annihilates the cytotoxicity while the presence of methyl residues induces cell death of various cells (Caco-2, TR146, PC-12, etc.) [76] [77] [78] . For instance, cell death induced by DM-\u03b2-CD is caused by a marked apoptosis mechanism (i.e., a process by which cells trigger their self-destruction in response to a signal which leads to cell changes prior to death) for NR8383, A549 and Jurkat cells [79] . This apoptosis process results from cholesterol extraction leading to inhibition of the activation of PI3K-Akt-Bad pathway. The presence of DM-\u03b1-CD had repercussions that were totally opposite to the DM-\u03b2-CD. Indeed, the cell death results from a non-apoptotic mechanism (i.e., necrosis). This differential effect could be attributed to a dissimilarity of interaction between the methylated CDs with the cholesterol-rich lipid rafts and with the sphingomyelin-rich domains for DM-\u03b2-CD and DM-\u03b1-CD, respectively. These results suggest that lipid rafts of cell membranes would be involved in cell death and cellular function.",

The secondary structure describes the arrangement of amino acid residues observed at the atomic scale stabilized mainly by H-bonds (e.g., \u03b1-helix, \u03b2-sheet and turns). The tertiary structure corresponds to the general shape of the observable protein across the whole molecule. It describes the interactions between the different elements of the secondary structure. Finally, the assembly of several protein subunits to form a functional complex is described by the quaternary structure [54] . As some amino acids have hydrophobic side chains (e.g., alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, proline, phenylalanine, tryptophan, cysteine and methionine), they can be easily included inside the CDs. This complexation leads to modification of the protein. For sake of clarity, only some typical examples are reported in this section.",

This dissociation is clearly related to the interaction of these CDs with the protein side chains. Indeed, the dissociation of insulin oligomers is endothermic without CDs whereas in the presence of \u03b1-CD, the dissociation is less endothermic due to the exothermic binding of \u03b1-CD to exposed groups on insulin monomers after dissociation.

In 2009, a 1 H NMR spectroscopic study revealed that the 1 H NMR signals corresponding to Trp residues were shifted upon the addition of G1-\u03b2-CD due to encapsulation of the tryptophan residues in the G1-\u03b2-CD cavity [92] . In addition, the 1 H NMR signals for cysteine 64 and isoleucine 98 were also influenced to a considerable extent with the addition of G1-\u03b2-CD. This allows the conclusion that these hydrophobic amino acid residues are also included by this CD. These results are highly compatible with the very important thermal stability reduction observed in the presence of G1-\u03b2-CD.

Thaumatin has been shown to bind to G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) which are transmembrane proteins, responsible for signal transduction. Therefore, the interaction of CDs with thaumatin could be used to modify the interaction of thaumatin with GPCRs and to modify its sweet-taste profile. In this context, Thordarson et al. studied the interaction of \u03b1-CD with thaumatin [93] . The 1D and 2D NMR experiments revealed that \u03b1-CD binds to aromatic residues of thaumatin with a binding constant of 8.5 M \u22121 . As the active binding site of the thaumatin protein is known, the authors have synthesized a heptapeptide (Lys-Thr-Gly-Asp-Arg-Gly-Phe) that mimics this binding site of thaumatin. The results show that \u03b1-CD binds to the C-terminal solvent accessible phenylalanine residue with a binding constant of 8.8 M \u22121 . As the \u03b1-CD may interact with the active binding site on thaumatin, the regulation of the interaction of thaumatin with GPCRs is probably possible.",

In autotrophs, such as plants, sugars are converted into starch whereas for heterotrophic organisms, such as animals, they are stored as glycogen. However, polysaccharides serve also as structural components: cellulose for plants and chitin for arthropods. Moreover, saccharides and their derivatives play key roles in the immune system, fertilization, blood clotting, information transfer, etc. For instance, the 5-carbon monosaccharide ribose forms the backbone of the genetic molecule RNA (see below) and is also an important component of coenzymes (ATP, FAD and NAD).",

This magnitude is consistent with the order of magnitude of the sugar hydrophobicity scale determined by Janado and Yano in 1985 (Scheme 4) [100] . This hydrophobicity scale is corroborated by Wei and Pohorille for the hexose series [101] . Therefore, even if all the literature values for the binding constants obtained by the different methods are not especially self-consistent, it is clear that \u03b2-CD can selectively recognize pentoses in contrast to hexoses [102] . However, the binding constants remain very small (see Table 4 ). Based on all these results, the interaction of CDs with carbohydrates in aqueous solution can be completely neglected.

For instance, the results found in the literature for the \u03b1-CD are contradictory. Indeed, the works of Komiyama [104] , Tee [105] , and Spies et al. [106] suggested that \u03b1-CD cannot interact with DNA because the cavity of this molecule is too small to accommodate DNA base pairs. All these results support the work of Hoffmann and Bock who examined the complex formation between different CDs and nucleotides [107] . In contrast, in a more recent work, Jaffer et al. have found that \u03b1-CD can form H-bonds with DNA base pairs that flip out spontaneously at room temperature leading to DNA denaturation [108] . Consequently, exclusion and inclusion complexes are achieved with \u03b1-and \u03b2-CD, respectively. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that when a complex is formed with \u03b2-CD, the ribose and phosphate groups of the nucleotides exert also a stabilizing effect by establishing H-bonds with the outer rim of the CD molecules. Interestingly, the extent of complexation depends significantly on the base composition and the doubleor triple-helical structures. In contrast to native CDs, cationic CDs are known to interact strongly with DNA [109, 110] . As consequence, CDs can be used to complex DNA and to encapsulate it into liposomes for potential gene therapy applications [111] . However, other formulation can be used to obtain nonviral vectors [112] .",

The obtained anthryl(alkylamino)-\u03b2-CD was used as chemically switched DNA intercalator. However, as the anthryl residue is locked in the CD cavity, its intercalation into DNA is not possible in aqueous solution. Upon addition of a ligand that is tightly bound in the CD cavity (e.g., 1-adamantanol), the host molecule releases the anthryl unit, which then leads to strong intercalation with the double-stranded DNA molecule leading to structural distortions (Scheme 5). This behavior was clearly established from 1 H NMR spectroscopy (shifts and broadening of anthryl signals) in the presence of the 1-adamantanol guest. This concept could be very useful in nucleic acid reactions of medicinal and biotechnological importance for new drug delivery systems. Unfortunately, the binding constants between CDs and nucleic acids remain relatively modest and close to those observed for peptides and proteins (see above).",

Indeed, CDs have been used recently to monitor the movement of cholesterol from monolayers [57] or liposome bilayers [60] . For instance, a typical paper has been published in 2001 by Leventis and Silvius [60] . In order to characterize the CDs capacity to bind cholesterol, the authors examined the catalytic transfer of cholesterol between liposomes composed of 1-stearoyl-2-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine (SOPC) or SOPC/cholesterol. In the steady state under such conditions where a negligible fraction of the sterol is bound to CD (i.e., in the presence of submillimolar concentrations), \u03b2-and \u03b3-CDs accelerate considerably the rate of cholesterol transfer between lipid vesicles (63-and 64-fold, respectively). This improvement is clearly greater than the transfer of phospholipid. The opposite is true for \u03b1-and methyl\u03b2-CD. The kinetics of CD-mediated cholesterol transfer indicates that the transbilayer flip-flop of cholesterol is very rapid (halftime < 1-2 min at 37 \u00b0C). In the case of \u03b2-CD, the author reported on the relative affinities of cholesterol for different phospholipids. As expected, strong variations in cholesterol affinity were observed depending on the degree of chain unsaturation and the headgroup structure. The transfer revealed that cholesterol interacts with markedly higher affinity with sphingolipids than with other membrane phospholipids. As extension of this work, Huang and London highlighted the possibility of preparing asymmetric vesicles during the exchange of membrane lipids between different vesicles by selective inclusion of phospholipids and/or cholesterol into the CD cavity [120] . Moreover, CDs can also be used to monitor the intracellular movement of cholesterol in tissue culture cells [121] .",

For instance, the kinetics of cholesterol efflux have been examined in different cell lines such as fibroblasts [117] , human erythrocytes [122] , rat cerebellar neurons [123] , differentiated human neurons and astrocytes [124] , etc. All these results indicated that CDs induce cholesterol, sphingolipids, and phospholipids extraction from the cytoplasmic membrane typically in a range of 50-90% of the original amount. Castagne and co-workers studied the cholesterol extraction of native and modified \u03b2-CDs on endothelial cells (HUVEC) [125] . The measurement of the residual cholesterol content of cells reveals that cholesterol was extracted in a dose dependent relationship. As expected, a correlation was obtained between the cytotoxicity and the affinity for cholesterol. The affinity of CDs for cholesterol was classified in the order \u03b2-CD < HP-\u03b2-CD < Me-\u03b2-CD. Similar results are obtained with other biological membranes [117] [118] [119] [120] [121] [122] [123] [124] [125] [126] . Another typical example has been published by Steck et al. The authors investigated the cholesterol movement created by the treatment of human erythrocytes with Me-\u03b2-CD [122] . The results show that the rate of efflux is approximately three orders of magnitude higher than the cholesterol transfer from cells to synthetic vesicles. Therefore, Me-\u03b2-CDs are very efficient to extract large amounts of membrane cholesterol at a very high rate. CDs can also catalyze the exchange of cholesterol between serum lipoproteins and cells [56] .",

Consequently, the elasticity of the artery walls is reduced, pulse pressure can be modified and blood clot can be formed (Scheme 6). Cardiovascular disease is currently the leading cause of death worldwide.

The opposite holds for low-density lipoproteins (LDL). Their function is to transport cholesterol, free or esterified, in the blood and through the body to bring them to the cells. HDL particles also reduce macrophage accumulation, and thus help prevent or even regress atherosclerosis. The alteration of cellular cholesterol regulation, named the reverse cholesterol transport, RCT, could be used to block atheroprogression associated with different severity degrees of atherosclerosis pathogenesis.

In addition to reduce triglyceride serum levels, this CD reduces cholesterol accumulation in atherosclerotic plaques by the modification of HDL-cholesterol levels.

As pointed out by Coisne and co-workers, \"RCT alterations have been poorly studied at the arterial endothelial cell and smooth muscle cells levels\" [132] . Consequently, the authors investigated the effect of different methylated \u03b2-CDs on the RCT of arterial endothelial and smooth muscle cells. It should be noted that these two cell types express basal levels of ABCA1 and SR-BI whereas ABCG1 was solely found in arterial endothelial cells. The authors highlighted the correlation between the percentages of cholesterol extraction and the methylation degree of the CDs. This effect was clearly independent of the membrane composition. The expression levels of ABCA1 and ABCG1, as well as the cholesterol efflux to ApoA-I and HDL, were reduced due to cholesterol-methylated \u03b2-CD interaction. Consequently, the cellular cholesterol involved in atherosclerotic lesions is lowered and the expression of ABCA1 and ABCG1 transporters involved in RCT is clearly modulated.",

Mice were fed with a cholesterol-rich diet for 12 weeks in order to promote fatty plaques in their blood vessels (i.e., to obtain atherosclerotic mice). After 8 weeks, they started the injection of HP-\u03b2-CD (2 injections by week). Over the remaining four weeks, the authors observed a plaque reduction in atherosclerotic mice that had consumed HP-\u03b2-CD compared with plaques in the blood vessels of untreated animals (\u224846% reduction). From a mechanistic point of view, the researchers suspect that the CD boosts the activity of macro-phages, enabling them to attack excess cholesterol without causing inflammation.

The antiviral properties were clearly dependent on the cavity size: \u03b1-CD exhibited no significant antiherpetic activity, while, under similar conditions, \u03b2-CD reduced both the cell-free and cell-associated virus more effectively than acyclovir (i.e., antiherpetic drug). Indeed, the results reveal an almost complete protection of Vero cells against acyclovir-sensitive and acyclovir-resistant strains of HSV.

            "text": "The potential occurrence of synergistic effects presents a special case, and may occur when one substance increases the activity of another. Currently, gaps in our knowledge of the circumstances under which such effects may occur (e.g., mixture composition, contact time, species, and exposure concentrations) often hamper predictive approaches. However, since the CDs are able to extract cholesterol and other lipids from the viral membrane, it is likely that their combination with virucides or antiviral drugs which act on the same target results in a synergistic effect. Based on this assumption, our group studied the combination of di-n-decyldimethylammonium chloride, [DiC 10 ][Cl] (the most widely used cationic surfactant with intrinsic virucidal activity), and native CDs (\u03b1-, \u03b2-and \u03b3-CD) [159] . A marked synergism was observed with \u03b3-CD against lipid-containing deoxyribonucleic and ribonucleic acid viruses (HSV-1, respiratory syncytial virus, RSV), and vaccinia viruses, VACV). Indeed, noticeable reductions of the [DiC 10 ][Cl] concentration (i.e., active virucide) were obtained: 72, 40 and 85% against HSV-1, RSV and VACV, respectively. In all cases, submillimolar [DiC 10 ][Cl] and \u03b3-CD concentrations were re-quired to obtain a \"6-log reduction\" (equivalent to 99.9999% reduction) of the viral titer. Therefore, for these diluted solutions, free CD and [DiC 10 ] species prevail due to the Le Ch\u00e2telier's principle. Moreover, the micellization equilibrium is not relevant as the virucidal activity was clearly obtained in the premicellar region. Thus, the proposed mechanism of the synergy is based on the ability of CD to extract rapidly cholesterol from the viral envelope. Indeed, \u03b3-CD catalyzes the rapid exchange of cholesterol between the viral envelope and the aqueous solution. The sequestration of cholesterol in the bulk phase facilitates the [DiC 10 ] insertion within the lipid envelope which leads to the virus inactivation (Scheme 7). This means that \u03b3-CD accelerates the rate of cholesterol extraction by a larger factor than \u03b1-or \u03b2-CD. The proposed mechanism is highly compatible with the results of Leventis and Silvius (see above) [60] . These results demonstrate a clear effect of CDs on the \"viability\" of enveloped viruses and provide evidences of their potential use in order to improve the efficiency of common antiviral medications.",

The majority of these applications are based on the capacity of CDs to withdraw cholesterol of the plasma membrane. This behavior presents several applications such as cholesterol manipulation, control of viral and bacterial infections, treatment of Alzheimer's and heart diseases, etc. Moreover, CDs present a viable basis in the context of \"green pharmacy and medicine\". In the last decade, the concept of \"ecofriendly pharmacy\" emerged in response to the Kreisberg's question: \"what clinicians can do to reduce the environmental impacts of medications\" [165] ? Of course, the answers are based on similar principles than green chemistry initially developed by Anastas and Warner [166] . The principles cover various concepts such as: i) the use of bio-sourced ingredients, ii) the use of \"green concepts\" during the production (chemicals, synthesis processes, life cycle engineering, packaging, waste management), iii) the reduction of the negative impact of medication transportations, iv) the reduction of healthcare environmental footprint, v) the reduction of the use of pharmaceuticals and, vi) the improvement of the ultimate drug disposal with the use of take-back programs [167] . As CDs are bio-sourced compounds with very low toxicity dangers and easily biodegradable, they can be used to obtain more sustainable drug formulations in which CDs act as an active green ingredient and not only as an excipient. It is noteworthy that these CDs can be used alone or in combination with common petro-sourced medications. If a synergistic effect between the two molecules is obtained, a significant amount of the drug can be replaced by eco-and biocompatible CDs whilst maintaining the same biological activity. This is particularly interesting as it solves at least partially the negative impact of pharmaceutical formulations to the environment. Consequently, in this context of \"greener pharmacy\", CDs will contribute without doubt to preserve our planet in the coming years.",

The authors reported that DM-\u03b1-CD induces morphological changes in rabbit erythrocytes leading to stomatocytes, while DM-\u03b2-CD leads to echinocytes. This difference is ascribed to the cavity size of the CDs and their ability to extract either sphingomyelin and/or cholesterol of lipid rafts. Lipid rafts are constituted of cholesterol, glycolipids, and sphingomyelin. Nevertheless, their structures have heterogeneity with the presence of cholesterol-rich and sphingomyelin-rich domains. Consequently, DM-\u03b1-CD extract sphingomyelin form sphingomyelin-rich domains while DM-\u03b2-CD extract cholesterol from cholesterol-rich lipid rafts (Scheme 2). This assertion is supported by the work of Nishijo et al. which reported the binding constants of the 1:1 and 1:2 (cholesterol:DM-\u03b2-CD) complexes (1.09 \u00d7 10 2 M \u22121 and 5.68 \u00d7 10 4 M \u22121 , respectively, at 25 \u00b0C)",
