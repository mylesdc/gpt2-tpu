Molecular and phylogenetic analyses were performed on partial fusion gene sequences of HMPV-positive patients. Results. HMPV-positive patients were detected in 2007-2008. The overall infection rate was 4%, while 57% of the patients were children. Sequence analysis demonstrated circulation of subgroup B viruses with predominance of lineage B2. Nucleotide sequence identity within lineage B1 was 98.8%-99.7% and higher than that in lineage B2 (94.3%-100%). Three new amino acid substitutions (T223N, R229K, and D280N) of lineage B2 were observed. Conclusion. HMPV is a major viral pathogen in the Egyptian population especially in children.

The genetic profile of the virus consists of 13,350 nucleotides, comprising the nucleoprotein (N), phosphoprotein (P), matrix protein (M), fusion protein (F), matrix proteins (M2-1 and M2-2), small hydrophobic protein (SH), glycoprotein (G), and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L) [3] . The fusion (F) and attachment (G) proteins are the major HMPV surface glycoproteins. The HMPV F gene codes for a class 1 viral fusion protein that mediates virus entry through both attachment [4] and fusion with the host cell membrane [5] . The HMPV F protein is a major antigenic determinant which mediates extensive crosslineage neutralization and protection. Infection with each strain provided a high level of resistance to reinfection with the homologous or heterologous strain [6] . The F gene is relatively conserved between subgroups, making it an ideal target for nucleic acid amplification [7] .",

Another study of HMPV infection in children of Mansoura, northeast part of Egypt, in 2010 showed a positive rate of 8% [41] . Further, in comparison to our study, the infection rate of HMPV in children is at an equal frequency level in the Arabian Peninsula.

In general, the HMPV frequency rate varies worldwide from 3.5% in Finland to 17.8% in Brazil [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] .

We detected three coinfections in children (4.3%) and one co-infection in adults (0.2%). With regard to HMPV, there was one co-infection with HMPV and AdV identified in an infant. In a different study from Egypt conducted in 2006-2007, a comparable coinfection rate in children (4.5%) to our results was observed [40] . Interestingly, a study in China revealed a co-infection frequency of 58% in HMPV-positive children [54] . Coinfections with HMPV are often described for children [55, 56] and were mostly associated with the age group less than 6 months old [57] .",

The phylogenetic analysis was both performed with German strains and other published reference strains representing HMPV subgroups A and B. The Egyptian sequences clustered in HMPV subgroup B with predominance of the genetic lineage B2. Whereas in Upper Egypt HMPV B circulated in the season 2007-2008, in Jordan (Arabian Peninsula) both subgroups were detected in 2007 [43] . HMPV subgroup A was detected in 93% of the patients and 28.6% of the patients were infected with subgroup B. Co-infection with HMPV subgroups A and B was detected in 21,4% [43] . These different circulation patterns in the same area support the assumption that the circulation of HMPV subgroups and subclusters might be a local phenomenon [58] .",

In line with these findings, the F gene was well conserved in HMPV circulating in Europe, North America, and Asia [8, 18, 31, [59] [60] [61] (Table 5 ). The amino acid conservation of the F gene was higher in the Egyptian strains than nucleotide sequence conservation. This is supported by the assumption that nucleotide diversity is greater than amino acid diversity among HMPV F sequences due to functional constraints on fusion proteins which prevent drastic amino acid changes. This could lead to a lack of directional antigenic drift in paramyxoviruses in contrast to influenza viruses [62] .",

The Egyptian HMPV strains formed three clusters, two in the B2 branch and one in the B1 branch. In regard of the amino acid substitution, it was revealed that B2 strains were more variable than B1 strains. Two Egyptian HMPV (EG/303(NA)/08 and EG/513(TS)/08) showed a unique amino acid substitution in the F gene resulting in an allocation of these strains to a separate branch from B2 viruses. These viruses were detected in two patients from Red Sea and Luxor. Interestingly, there were Egyptian and German HMPV strains which were very closely related. The relation of HMPV from distant regions 9 is known but reasons remain unclear. It can be supposed that human travelling behaviour influences the diversity and evolution of HMPV.",
