            "text": "Background: Since 2008, a progressive pneumonia has become prevalent in broilers and laying hens. This disease occurrs the first day after hatching and lasts more than 30 days, resulting in approximately 70% morbidity and 30% mortality in broilers. The objective of this study was to isolate and identify the pathogens that are responsible for the progressive pneumonia and establish an animal model for drug screening. Results: 193 serum samples were collected from 8 intensive farms from 5 provinces in China and analysed in the current research. Our clinical survey showed that 65.2% to 100% of breeding broilers, breeding layers, broilers and laying hens were seropositive for ORT antibodies. From 8 intensive farms, six ORT isolates were identified by PCR and biochemical assays, and two H9N2 viruses were isolated. Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV) and Infectious BronchitisVirus (IBV) were excluded. Typical pneumonia and airsacculitis were observed both in broilers inoculated intraperitoneally with an ORT isolate alone and in those co-infected with ORT and H9N2 virus isolates. Specifically, the survival rate was 30%, 20%, 70%, 50% and 90% in birds inoculated with ORT+H9N2 virus, ORT followed by H9N2 virus, H9N2 virus followed by ORT, and ORT or H9N2 virus alone, respectively. Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that ORT infections of domestic poultry have been occurring frequently in China. ORT infection can induce higher economic losses and mortality if H9N2 AIV is also present. Although the isolation of ORT and H9N2 virus has been reported previously, there have been no reported co-infections of poultry with these two pathogens. This is the first report of co-infection of broilers with ORT and H9N2 virus, and this co-infection is probably associated with the outbreak of broiler airsacculitis in China, which has caused extensive economic losses.",

            "text": "Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale(ORT) causes respiratory infections, such as airsacculitis and pneumonia, in birds all over the world. ORT can be a primary or secondary etiological agent, depending on the strain virulence, environmental factors, the immune status of the host, and the presence of other infectious agents [1] . In recent years, outbreaks of respiratory disease associated with ORT have been reported all over the world, including the USA, France, Netherlands, Belgium, Spain, Germany, Hungary, Israel, Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Turkey, Brazil, Iran and South Africa [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . This pathogen can cause economic losses in the poultry industry due to growth retardation and the designation of infected carcasses as unacceptable for human consumption [1, 6, 8] . The H9N2 avian influenza virus (AIV) is not only widespread in poultry, but it also has important implications for human health as a zoonotic infection [10, 11] . Previous studies demonstrate that H9N2 virus infection contributes to respiratory distress and is involved in diseases caused by other respiratory pathogens in the poultry industry [12, 13] . More recent reports indicate that two virulent Chinese isolates of H9N2 virus induced acute respiratory distress in mice [14] , which are widely used in biomedical research, suggesting a potential public health risk.",

            "text": "In the current study, 83.0% of clinical blood samples from poultry farms were positive for ORT antibodies by ELISA. The ORT isolated from the infected lungs of a 32-day-old broiler grew on sheep blood agar, and the H9N2 virus was isolated from the same broiler and identified by HI and RT-PCR. Based on the sequence analysis, the Chinese ORT isolate is 98.0 to 100% homologous to other ORT isolates in GenBank. Broilers inoculated intraperitoneally with ORT/chicken/Shandong/2011 alone displayed pneumonia and typical airsacculitis, and coinfection of the broilers with ORT and H9N2 virus isolates induced higher mortality than infection with ORT or H9N2 virus alone. Therefore, these results satisfy Koch's postulates for confirming the role of a suspected bacterial pathogen in disease. The results of this study strongly suggest that co-infection with ORT and H9N2 virus is responsible for the current severe pneumonia with high mortality in broilers of China. In our clinical setting, ORT was associated with 20-30 % and 10-20% mortality in broilers and layers, respectively. However, the birds infected with the ORT isolated in this study had a 50% mortality rate, and a co-infection with the H9N2 virus resulted in 70% death. Our findings suggest that primary infection with ORT might play a major role in the development of severe pneumonia, and secondary infection with H9N2 further increases the mortality. These findings are different from previous reports in which no pneumonia or airsacculitis was induced by aerosol, intra-tracheal or intra-thoracic inoculation with ORT alone [18] . Only intravenous inoculation has been reported to induce clinical signs in SPF chickens, with at most 20% mortality [19] , and no airsacculitis has been previously seen in the field. Given these conflicting results, it is uncertain if ORT should be regarded as a primary pathogen [1] . Additionally, it is generally acknowledged that ORT and Avian pneumovirusvirus (APV) infections synergistically aggravate respiratory symptoms in turkeys. An aerosol inoculation of ORT without a viral primer did not result in lesions [20, 21] . Furthermore, viral agents could trigger higher mortality independent of ORT infection, such as NDV [1] and APV [21, 22] . A recent report confirmed that IBV and E. coli infection exacerbated ORT pathogenesis in adult laying hens [23] . However, none of the above-mentioned viruses were identified in the present study. Interestingly, the birds infected with ORT alone developed an exudative pneumonia and extensive haemorrhage in the lungs and kidneys. This pattern of pathology is not consistent with previous reports. These histological results indicate that this newly isolated ORT is different from formerly reported ORT serotypes [20] [21] [22] 24] . Because the serotype of the ORT isolated in this study is unclear, further investigation is needed to identify its specific serotype and characterise ORT pathogenesis based on serotype. After inoculation of broilers with ORT and H9N2 virus together, widespread haemorrhage and fibrosis in the respiratory tract were the most notable features of the infection, which led to occlusion of the air capillaries, respiratory distress and the increased mortality. These histopathological lesions are analogous to those described in birds late during the course of avian influenza H9N2 infection alone [11, 14] . Notably, the severe pulmonary fibrosis was observed in the animals inoculated first with ORT followed by the H9N2 virus. The clinical signs and the respiratory lesions observed during necropsy of the birds infected with the H9N2+ORT combination and the H9N2 group confirm that ORT, not a viral agent, triggers the overt respiratory symptoms. Our findings are also different from previous reports in which ORT could be involved in infections with E. coli O2:K1 [22] , Bordetella avium [25] , and Chlamydophila psittaci [26] as well as a combination of E. coli and APV [22] . In our pilot study (unpublished data), E. coli and Chlamydophila psittaci were occasionally identified in the latter phase of the ORT infection. However, coinfection of ORT and E. coli or Chlamydophila psittaci could not reproduce the typical pathology of the pneumonia and airsacculitis, such as clots of fibrin in the air sacs and haemorrhage in lungs. In the co-infection, ORT may dominate the primary infection, followed by secondary bacterial infections. ORT was isolated and identified in birds with clinical signs immediately after hatching in the previous reports [24] . In current study, ORT/chicken/Liaoning/2010 was isolated from the egg yolks of the breeder's eggs, suggesting the possibility of vertical transmission from parents to offspring.",

Moreover, ORT infection could produce a higher level of mortality and economic loss if H9N2 AIV was also present. Although ORT and the H9N2 virus have been isolated and identified separately in previous reports, this is the first report of co-infection of broilers with ORT and H9N2 AIV, and this co-infection might be probably associated with the outbreak of broiler airsacculitis in China, which caused an extensive economic loss. Therefore, further investigation of the resistance and pathogenesis of ORT is urgently needed. ",
