            "text": "Background: Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are primarily known for their innate immune defense against invading microorganisms, including viruses. In addition, recent research has suggested their modulatory activity in immune induction. Given that most subunit vaccines require an adjuvant to achieve effective immune induction through the activation of innate immunity, AMPs are plausible candidate molecules for stimulating not only innate immune but also adaptive immune responses. Results: In this study, we investigated the ability of human \u03b2-defensin (HBD) 2 to promote antiviral immunity in vitro and in vivo using a receptor-binding domain (RBD) of Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) spike protein (S RBD) as a model antigen (Ag). When HBD 2-conjugated S RBD was used to treat THP-1 human monocytic cells, the expression levels of antiviral (IFN-\u03b2, IFN-\u03b3, MxA, PKR, and RNaseL) and primary immune-inducing (NOD2, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6) molecules were enhanced compared to those expressed after treatment with S RBD only. The expression of chemokines capable of recruiting leukocytes, including monocytes/macrophages, natural killer cells, granulocytes, T cells, and dendritic cells, was also increased following HBD 2-conjugated S RBD treatment. More important, immunization of mice with HBD 2-conjugated S RBD enhanced the immunogenicity of the S RBD and elicited a higher S RBD-specific neutralizing antibody response than S RBD alone.",

Vaccines made up of live attenuated and/or killed whole pathogens usually contain endogenous adjuvants, such as bacterial cell wall components, genomic nucleic acids, and various pathogen-derived materials, that act as pathogen-associated molecular patterns and are sufficient to induce Ag-specific adaptive immunity by potentiating immunogenicity through the activation of innate immunity [2, 3] . However, subunit vaccines that utilize recombinant and/ or purified Ags usually lack these endogenous innate immune stimulators. Consequently, the addition of exogenous materials with adjuvant activity is required to mimic natural infection to draw effective pathogenic Ag-specific adaptive immunity [4] .",

            "text": "The innate immune response includes the production of interferons (IFNs), complements, and antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and is crucial for controlling infectious diseases and inducing adaptive immunity [5] . AMPs have been proposed as multifunctional peptides that participate in the elimination of pathogenic microorganisms, including bacteria, fungi, and viruses [6] . In particular, defensins, one of the major AMP families in mammals, contribute to the antimicrobial innate immune response by disrupting the cell membranes of pathogens [7] . Six \u03b1-defensins and 31 \u03b2-defensins are expressed in humans. Human \u03b2-defensins (HBDs), unlike \u03b1-defensins, are produced in a wide variety of epithelial tissues, including skin and mucosa, and cells, including phagocytic cells and mucosal epithelial cells [7] . The expression of defense genes is tightly regulated by cytokines as part of the host defense and is suppressed by various virulent factors of pathogens [6] . It is important to note that AMPs were recently reported to modulate adaptive immunity by triggering the recruitment and activation of immune cells via various pathways linked with innate immunity [8] . For example, HBDs are chemotactic for immature dendritic cells (DCs) and memory T cells to the site of pathogen invasion by interacting with CCR6 and promote the adaptive immune response by recruiting immune cells [9, 10] . However, their antiviral and immune-modulatory functions against viral infection have not been clearly elucidated in crucial innate immune cells, such as neutrophils and macrophages.",

The transcript level of MxA was substantially elevated 6 h after HBD 2-conjugated Ag treatment and remained strongly induced 24 h after Ag treatment (Fig. 1c ). In addition, the levels of all cytokine and chemokine genes tested were significantly higher in HBD 2-conjugated Ag-treated THP-1 cells than in control PBS-treated cells (Fig. 1d-k) .

PKR gene expression was significantly higher in HBD 2-con jugated Ag-treated THP-1 cells than in control PBStreated cells; however, the difference between THP-1 cells treated with either HBD 2-conjugated or non-conju gated Ag-treated cells was not statistically significant, although HBD 2-conjugated Ag treatment upregulated the expression of PKR in THP-1 cells 24 h after treatment (Fig. 3a) . It is interesting that the transcript levels of RNaseL and NOD2 were significantly higher in HBD 2-conjugated S RBD-treated cells 6 h after treatment than in cells treated with S RBD without HBD 2 conjugation, and this significant difference was maintained 24 h after treatment (Fig. 3b and c) . More important, HBD 2-conjugated Ag treatment provoked a rapid and strong induction of NOD2 expression in THP-1 cells compared to treatment with S RBD alone (Fig. 3c) .

Defensins are small cysteine-rich cationic and amphipathic proteins. Their antiviral and antibacterial activity was originally attributed to their lipid perturbation activity because the disruption of viral glycoprotein function by membrane lipid perturbation leads to the inhibition of receptor binding and fusion of a b c Fig. 3 Quantitative analysis of antiviral gene expression in HBD 2treated THP-1 cells. THP-1 cells were stimulated with 1 \u03bcg/mL recombinant S RBD protein with (S RBD-HBD 2) or without (S RBD) HBD 2 conjugation, and the transcript levels of (a) PKR, (b) RNaseL, and (c) NOD2 were measured 6 h and 24 h after treatment via qRT-PCR as described in Materials and Methods. qRT-PCR was performed twice, and values were normalized to that of the internal control (hACTB).

However, the observation that several classes of non-enveloped viruses are also sensitive to defensins led to the discovery of additional antiviral mechanisms of defensins [7] . Although additional mechanisms include receptor downregulation and the disruption of early events in viral infection, a universal mechanism for the neutralization of non-enveloped viruses remains elusive. In addition to their antibacterial and antiviral activity, defensins are one of the strongest central and peripheral defenders against pathogen infection, particularly in linking innate and adaptive immunity against pathogen infection through leukocytes, such as DCs and T cells [9] . In addition, a potent adjuvant is needed to enhance the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of subunit vaccines against pathogens [21, 22] . We thus investigated the adjuvant effects of defensins on antiviral innate and pathogenic Ag-specific adaptive immune responses using HBD 2 to analyze its potential use in the development of a subunit vaccine with self-adjuvant activity.",

IFNs are divided into type I and type II IFNs. Like IFN-\u03b3, a type II IFN, type I IFNs, such as IFN-\u03b2, are induced by viral infection and confer antiviral activity to the host [23, 24] . IFNs exert their antiviral activity by enhancing the expression of numerous genes with antiviral activity, including MxA, a cytoplasmic GTPase that inhibits the replication of several RNA viruses [25, 26] . Double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase PKR and endogenous ribonuclease RNaseL are also antiviral effector proteins [25] . In contrast to MxA, the activation of PKR requires its binding to double-stranded RNA, and the activation of PKR leads to translational arrest via the phosphorylation of an essential translation initiation factor. This in turn activates the endogenous ribonuclease RNase L, which subsequently cleaves single-stranded RNAs, including mRNAs of viral and host cell origin [25] .",

            "text": "We found that NOD2 expression was activated by HBD 2-conjugated Ag treatment of THP-1 cells (Fig. 3c) . NOD2 was recently identified as a bacterial receptor that contributes to crosstalk between innate and adaptive immune systems in the digestive tract [27, 28] . NOD2 also functions as a cytoplasmic viral pattern recognition receptor by triggering the activation of IFN-regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and the production of IFN-\u03b2 [29] . NOD2 is expressed in immune cells, such as monocytes/macrophages, T cells, granulocytes, and DCs, as well as in colon epithelial cells [30, 31] and is required for the expression of a subgroup of intestinal antimicrobial peptides, such as cryptdins [28] . It is interesting that NOD2-deficient mice are susceptible to pathogen infection via the oral route but not intravenous or peritoneal routes. These reports indicate that NOD2 is essential for activating adaptive immunity by acting as an adjuvant receptor for Ab production, either directly or by enhancing the production of defensins [32, 33] or other immunostimulatory molecules. In addition, \u03b2-defensins have been reported to function as chemoattractants for various antigen-presenting cells (APCs), including immature DCs and macrophages, through chemokine receptors CCR6 and CCR2 [9, 34, 35] . Besides recruiting APCs to the inflammation site, \u03b2-defensins modulate the adaptive immune response by activating signal transduction a b Fig. 4 Quantitative analysis of the S RBD-specific antibody (Ab) response induced by the HBD 2-conjugated antigen (Ag). Mice were immunized with 10 \u03bcg/mouse of the indicated Ag and sera were collected 3 days after boost immunization. The level of the S RBDspecific Ab was measured via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and data are represented as the mean \u00b1 SD (from triplicates): (a) S RBD-specific IgG endpoint titers and (b) amount of S RBD-specific IgG. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, and *** p < 0.001 indicate significant differences between groups through pattern recognition receptors for APC maturation, leading to the production of Th1-polarized cytokines and other important immunomodulatory factors. \u03b2-defensins also modulate the adaptive immune response by self-destructive signaling to eliminate activated APCs and prevent harmful effects of long-activated DCs and macrophages [36, 37] . Therefore, some \u03b2-defensins may counter suppressive pathogen-derived factors by generating robust host primary immune responses, thereby inducing an efficient protective immune response. Collectively, we presume that HBD 2 is able to stimulate not only antiviral innate immune responses, but also specific adaptive immune responses through enhanced delivery of fused antigens to APCs in vivo. Consequently, we assessed the ability of HBD 2 to promote Ag-specific immune response induction using the HBD 2-conjugated S RBD of MERS-CoV.",

Penta-His Ab coupled with Alexa Fluor\u00ae 488 (Qiagen) was used as a secondary Ab. Cells were covered with SlowFade Gold Antifade Reagent (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY, USA), and slides were observed under a confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM, LSM 510, Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY, USA). Additionally, a receptor binding inhibition assay was performed with MERS-CoV-susceptible Vero E6 cells as described above, and median fluorescence intensity was measured using a CytoFLEX flow cytometer (Beckman-Coulter, Indianapolis, IN, USA).",
