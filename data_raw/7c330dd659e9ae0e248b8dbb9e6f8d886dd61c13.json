This risk has been recently reinforced by human epidemics in Singapore of SARS coronavirus, 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza A virus, and enterovirus 71. Other major threats to Singapore include MERS-coronavirus and various avian and swine influenza viruses. The ability to quickly identify and robustly track such threats to initiate an early emergency response remains a significant challenge. In an effort to enhance respiratory virus surveillance in Singapore, our team conducted a pilot study employing a noninvasive bioaerosol sampling method to detect respiratory viruses in Singapore's Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) network. Over a period of 52 weeks, 89 aerosol samples were collected during peak MRT ridership hours. Nine (10%) tested positive for adenovirus, four (4.5%) tested positive for respiratory syncytial virus type A, and one (1%) tested positive for influenza A virus using real-time RT-PCR/PCR. To our knowledge, this is the first time molecular evidence for any infectious respiratory agent has been collected from Singapore's MRT. Our pilot study data support the possibility of employing bioaerosol samplers in crowded public spaces to noninvasively monitor for respiratory viruses circulating in communities.",

            "text": "International travel can play a significant role in the spread of infectious diseases. For example, during the 2009 influenza H1N1 pandemic, countries receiving the highest volume of passengers (>1,400 in two months) from Mexico (the country of origin of the 2009 H1N1 virus), had a significantly higher risk of virus importation associated with travel to Mexico 15 . China (the country of origin of A(H7N4) and A(H7N9) viruses) is the third largest market of travelers for Singapore Changi Airport, which receives ~60,000 passengers from China per week. With Singapore's close connection to China, and recent evidence suggesting the potential for airborne transmission of highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H7N9) 16 , it is prudent for Singapore to ramp up disease surveillance. The ability to quickly identify and robustly track respiratory threats is fundamentally important for an early emergency response. To better understand the dynamics of microbes in cities in relation to human health, and to create healthier environments in areas where people frequently visit, researchers have begun studying the microbiome in and around public transportation vehicles 17, 18 . An international project named MetaSUB 18 was launched to map the microbiome of transit networks in the world's largest cities. Over 50 cities, including Singapore, Boston, Shanghai, Paris, Stockholm, and S\u00e3o Paolo are participating in the project to improve city planning and public health. Although baseline metagenomic maps created from these studies are said to be useful for mitigating bioterrorism and infectious disease outbreaks, most of them focus largely on mapping surface-borne bacterial DNA 17 and neglect to address the threat of weaponized or global catastrophic biological risk-level (GCBR-level) agents, both of which would likely be aerosolized or respiratory-borne RNA viruses 19 .",

Our results suggest that bioaerosol sampling might have a practical application for pathogen detection in public areas such as subway systems. Bioaerosol sampling in the field provides a noninvasive way to monitor and characterize the community of aerosolized respiratory viruses that regularly infect the public, as well as potentially detect or discover novel pathogens with pandemic potential, such as the influenza A(H7N9) virus. Additionally, a bioaerosol sampling system is advantageous as it does not require collecting individual samples from human subjects, nor informed consent. Although this pilot study provides important qualitative data (i.e., molecular presence of respiratory viruses in the MRT), it is important to note that solely detecting viral DNA/RNA in the air does not determine that a virus is successfully transmitted through the air. Cultures in this study were negative and therefore the viruses detected may have been non-viable. However, studies have demonstrated that upon the first ~15 minutes of aerosolization, viruses tend to decay the most rapidly 29, 30 , and therefore it is possible that the viability of the viruses captured in our study rapidly decreased during sample collection and transport. Moreover, temperature and RH have been widely understood to influence the viability of aerosolized viruses 31 . However, novel research has recently demonstrated that the viability of aerosolized influenza virus is independent of RH when the aerosol composition includes human bronchial epithelial (HBE) extracellular material (ECM) 32 , indicating that the influence of RH is more so on the rate of aerosol deposition after expulsion, which in turn, influences the overall concentration of viral aerosols in the environment. Aerosols tend to deposit onto surfaces more quickly at higher RH levels (>50%), suggesting that greater time spent in controlled environments with lower, more comfortable RH levels, could increase the risk of acquiring a respiratory virus via inhalation and respiration. Therefore, the average RH level (63%) on the Singapore MRT is not theoretically conducive to heavy airborne transmission of influenza viruses.",

            "text": "A likely contributor to the lack of data regarding airborne transmission of viruses is the difficulty of detecting respiratory pathogens in the air. Standard detection methods are designed to target viral nucleic acids which are subject to degradation from various environmental stressors (e.g., temperature, humidity, and UV light) as well as physical stress from aerosol sample collection methods, potentially deterring downstream detection. Therefore, high RH levels, in addition to sample degradation, could explain the low recovery of virus-positive aerosol samples in our study. Additionally, viral bioaerosols have notoriously low airborne concentrations, reducing the sensitivity of bioaerosol sampling. Some bioaerosol samplers, such as the NIOSH sampler used in this study, are compact and require a low flow rate which also may reduce sensitivity. Although the air pump flow rate and sample collection times used in our study have been demonstrated to efficiently capture aerosolized influenza virus and RSV RNA [33] [34] [35] , it is possible that these parameters are not optimal for capturing the other respiratory virus DNA/RNA targeted in our study. For example, it is possible that when compared to RNA viruses (e.g., influenza virus, RSV), adenovirus (a more durable DNA virus) can withstand a higher flow rate and/or longer sampling duration. Furthermore, although each of the assays used to detect viral DNA/RNA in our aerosol samples are highly sensitive, validated, singleplex real-time RT-PCR/PCR assays, specific detection limits (viral copies per volume of air) were not tested in our laboratory. Therefore, our DNA/RNA detections should not be mistaken as a true representation of the prevalence/densities of these viruses circulating in the air of the MRT, but rather a representation of the viruses our bioaerosol sampling technique is capable of detecting in this environment. To improve the sensitivity and specificity of bioaerosol sampling, more virus-specific controlled studies are needed to determine optimal sampling parameters for multiple respiratory viruses.",

Quickly identifying and robustly tracking respiratory threats are fundamental steps in an early emergency response to a pandemic. A bioaerosol sampling system is advantageous in this regard as it does not require the timely acquisition of ethical/IRB approvals and informed consent needed to collect individual samples from human subjects. If an outbreak is suspected or underway, bioaerosol samplers can be immediately deployed in high-risk areas, yielding results within a minimum of ~8 hours. Moreover, if bioaerosol samplers are proactively used to monitor high-risk areas, initial results turnaround times are nearly cut in half, as sample collection time is ~3-4 hours. Proactively monitoring for respiratory viruses also eliminates the risk of missing the time window of exposure to pandemic viruses in high-risk areas and would allow a more robust surveillance, which could be beneficial when the etiologic agent is known but the route of exposure is not fully understood.",

However, the full extent of exposure cannot be determined without measuring viral load. Our study falls short in that we did not quantify the viral load in our aerosol samples, making it difficult to compare our results with quantitative aerosol studies. In the future, we will implement a dilution series of positive controls into our real-time RT-PCR/PCR assay protocols to create a standard curve that can be used to accurately quantify the viral load in each aerosol sample.",

As this type of research is new to Singapore, the wellbeing of Singapore's civilians was carefully considered and therefore, researchers wore their Duke-NUS employee badges while sampling, and our laboratory's name was stitched onto the sampling backpacks (Fig. 1) for transparency. Similar to a study measuring the risk of exposure to aerosolized influenza virus among healthcare workers in an emergency department during influenza season 37 , strapping the samplers to personal backpacks allowed us to detect personal exposure to aerosolized viruses and provide insight into the efficacy of potential interventions (e.g., air/surface decontamination, and wearing face masks when infectious). Moreover, with evidence validating the notion that MRT riders are at risk of exposure to respiratory viruses, we hope to motivate scientists to conduct similar field studies to unveil the true risk of exposure while using public transportation, as data on this topic are scarce. Field studies may also inspire bioengineers and scientific instrument companies to design and test improved bioaerosol sampling such that it might be employed in a more widespread fashion to surveil for respiratory threats.",

From January 2017 through January 2018, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) BC 251 2-stage aerosol samplers were used to collect aerosol samples from the following Singapore Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) heavy rail lines: East West Line (EWL; green), and North East Line (NEL; purple). MRT lines were selected for their high capacity (~1,600 passengers per 6-car train), frequent use, and connection to high-traffic public areas. The EWL was specifically chosen for its connection to Changi Airport, and the NEL for its connection to downtown Singapore. Aerosol samples were collected weekly, with occasional interruptions, during peak ridership (~267 passengers/car or 5 pax/m 2 ) from 7:30-9:00 and 17:30-19:00 on Wednesdays. Sampling days varied occasionally due to public holidays and the researchers' availability. Using a 2-foot (61 cm) long piece of \u00bc\" (0.635 cm) Tygon tubing, NIOSH samplers were connected to AirChek \u00ae TOUCH Sample Pumps (SKC, Eighty Four, Pennsylvania) carried inside personal backpacks worn by the researchers. Both straps were tightened around the shoulders to secure the backpack against the researcher's back. NIOSH samplers were securely fastened to the front of the backpacks (on or above the researcher's heart) using Velcro (Fig. 1) . For each separate MRT line (i.e., green and purple), the same assembled NIOSH sampler was used for both AM and PM sampling sessions. To ensure all researchers followed the same sampling protocol, each researcher sampled one of the middle train-cars and remained standing with intermittent walking throughout each sampling session. Between AM and PM sampling sessions, sampler inlets were covered with electrical tape and the assembled samplers were refrigerated. All of the material collected by one NIOSH sampler during 3 hours of sampling was counted as one aerosol sample.",

Calibration was performed by inserting the sampler into a calibration adaptor (designed for NIOSH samplers) attached to an SKC check-mate calibrator. NIOSH samplers were engineered to separate collected particles into three size fractions: >4 \u03bcm, 1-4 \u03bcm, and <1 \u03bcm in diameter 33 . Prior to molecular analysis, the particles collected in the 1-4 \u03bcm and <1 \u03bcm size fractions were combined (see sample processing below). Therefore, our study reports molecular results for two particle size fractions (droplets >4 \u03bcm and droplet nuclei \u22644 \u03bcm). If processed directly, the minimum time duration between the start of sample collection and reporting of assay results (for one, 3 hr aerosol sample) was 14 hours. However, most of the DNA/RNA extracted from the aerosol samples was stored at \u221280 \u00b0C and analyzed in monthly batches. NIOSH samplers were rinsed with deionized water and soaked in 70% ethanol between each sampling day and a swab sample of the sterilized NIOSH sampler interior was used as a negative control sample for each sampling day. Negative control swabs were transferred to tubes containing 1 mL of 0.5% BSA solution, vortexed for 15 seconds, and discarded.
