When protein expression was induced at constant temperature, the greatest amount of extracellular recombinant \u03b1-CGTase was produced at 25 \u00b0C. Higher or lower induction temperatures were not conducive to extracellular secretion of recombinant \u03b1-CGTase. To enhance extracellular secretion of \u03b1-CGTase by E. coli, a two-stage temperature control strategy was adopted. When expression was induced at 25 \u00b0C for 32 h, and then the temperature was shifted to 30 \u00b0C, the extracellular \u03b1-CGTase activity at 90 h was 45% higher than that observed when induction was performed at a constant temperature of 25 \u00b0C. Further experiments suggested that raising the induction temperature can benefit the transport of recombinant enzyme and compensate for the decreased rate of recombinant enzyme synthesis during the later stage of expression.

Cyclodextrins form inclusion complexes with many different small, hydrophobic guest molecules, improving their solubility and stability in aqueous environments. This property makes it have many applications in scientific, medical and industrial fields (Roy et al. 2017) . The industrial use of \u03b1-cyclodextrin is in its infancy, yet is still expanding because of its small internal cavity, high water solubility, and resistance to enzymatic hydrolysis. Previous reports have shown that \u03b1-cyclodextrin can be used as a carrier of active ingredients, a solubilizer of lipids, a stabilizer of oils, a modifier of flavors or aromas, and a natural soluble dietary fiber (Aytac and Uyar 2016; Li et al. 2010b Li et al. , 2014a .",

Unfortunately, previous reports have demonstrated that the CGTases expressed in E. coli usually accumulated in the cytosol as biologically inactive inclusion bodies (Makrides 1996; Choi and Lee 2004) , and the refolding processes have been proved to be inconvenient (Li et al. 2005) . Although secretion into the periplasm is helpful for the rapid isolation of recombinant proteins, current methods for the selective release of periplasmic proteins are not suitable for largescale production (Yang et al. 1998; Jeang et al. 2005) . Therefore, the limitations of cytosolic and periplasmic expression of CGTase make the extracellular secretion of CGTases highly needed.",

This plasmid was then inserted into E. coli BL21(DE3) to form a strain used for the extracellular expression of \u03b1-CGTase by E. coli (Li et al. 2010a, b) . The greatest amount of extracellular recombinant \u03b1-CGTase was produced when expression was induced at a constant temperature of 25 \u00b0C (Li et al. 2010a, b) . Extracellular \u03b1-CGTase secretion was inhibited when expression was induced at temperatures >30 \u00b0C, and very little recombinant enzyme was obtained at 37 \u00b0C (Li et al. 2010a, b) . Additional studies were devoted to improving the yields of these recombinant \u03b1-CGTase by optimizing the composition of the culture medium (Ding et al. 2010; Li et al. 2013a, b) . When a one-stage temperature control strategy was used, the membrane permeability was generally at a low level. This low degree of membrane permeability did not favor the secretion of mature \u03b1-CGTase into the culture medium. Using a variable temperature control strategy, the membrane permeability may be increased. Therefore, in this study, a novel two-stage temperature control strategy was developed to further improve extracellular expression of P. macerans \u03b1-CGTase by E. coli. The underlying mechanisms for the enhanced enzyme secretion are discussed.",

The two-stage temperature control strategy had substantial effects on extracellular \u03b1-CGTase production (Fig. 1) . A control culture maintained at 25 \u00b0C showed a slow rise in extracellular \u03b1-CGTase activity until about 50 h of cultivation, a rapid rise between 50 and 80 h of cultivation, then a leveling off between 80 and 90 h of cultivation.

At 90 h of cultivation, the enzyme activity reached approximately 27 U/mL, which was 1.2 times that of the control.

Periplasmic \u03b1-CGTase activity increased dramatically during the first 15 h of induction at 25 \u00b0C, and then had a slow decline. When maintained at 25 \u00b0C, the decline continued until 45 h, and then there was a slow increase followed by a slow decline. This produced a peak of periplasmic activity at approximately 65 h of induction. Shifting the induction temperature to 30 \u00b0C after 32 h of induction at 25 \u00b0C increased the periplasmic \u03b1-CGTase activity substantially until it peaked at approximately 55 h. Thereafter, the activity dropped dramatically until, at 90 h, the activity was much lower than that observed when the induction temperature was maintained at 25 \u00b0C. These data are consistent with the SDS-PAGE study, suggesting that the two-phase induction strategy increased the flux of \u03b1-CGTase through the periplasmic space. ",

Extracellular \u03b1-CGTase production was inhibited when the induction temperatures was >30 \u00b0C, and very little recombinant enzyme could be obtained at 37 \u00b0C. The reason of this phenomenon was probably that the pre-\u03b1-CGTase formed inclusion bodies at the inner membrane at temperature above 30 \u00b0C, which could block the pre-protein translocation channels and suppress the entrance of newly synthesized pre-CGTase into the periplasm (Chen et al. 2014) . At 25 \u00b0C, pre-\u03b1-CGTase synthesis proceeded at a desirable rate and most of the pre-CGTase passed smoothly through the inner membrane into the periplasm, and then folded correctly (Mergulhao et al. 2005; Fang et al. 2010) . The rate of protein synthesis at 25 \u00b0C may have prevented the target protein from saturating the secretion machinery and have facilitated the translocation of \u03b1-CGTase across both E. coli membranes (Yamabhai et al. 2008; Fang et al. 2010) .",

Increasing the temperature is a reasonable strategy to increase the \u03b1-CGTase movement across the membranes since it can increase the membrane permeability. However, prolonged induction periods at elevated temperature, especially at 37 \u00b0C, may cause cell lysis, which would decrease productivity and secretion capacity (Mana et al. 2015) . Therefore, the second-stage temperatures between 30 and 37 \u00b0C were investigated during the total induction period of 90 h. The timing of the temperature shift had to be selected to minimize formation of inclusion bodies through accelerating translation. In the first experiment, 24 h was chosen because the inspection of the growth curve (Fig. 3) revealed that 24 h was well past the mid-point. The results showed that increasing the temperature increased the initial rate of \u03b1-CGTase production, but temperatures >30 \u00b0C gave poorer overall yields at 90 h of induction. This phenomenon was perhaps due to the premature cell lysis (Mana et al. 2015) .",

            "text": "The mechanistic data presented in Figs. 3, 4 and 5 strongly suggest that the two-stage induction strategy increased membrane permeability, which caused increased extracellular \u03b1-CGTase production. The increased inner membrane permeability in the ONPG study (Fig. 3 ) and the decreased amount of cytosolic protein and inclusion bodies in the SDS-PAGE study (Fig. 4) suggest that the two-stage induction strategy increased E. coli inner membrane permeability and then accelerated the transit of the \u03b1-CGTase across the inner membrane. This is confirmed by the increased \u03b1-CGTase activity that observed in the periplasmic space between 32 and 60 h of induction (Fig. 5 ). This accumulation of the \u03b1-CGTase activity in the periplasmic space further suggests that outer membrane permeability plays a significant role in the extracellular expression. The low degree of the outer membrane permeability was the main reason why only a small portion of the mature \u03b1-CGTase was secreted into the culture medium during the early stage of induction. The increased permeability of the outer membrane in the NPN study (Fig. 3 ) and the decreased amount of periplasmic \u03b1-CGTase in the SDS-PAGE study (Fig. 4) suggest that the two-stage induction strategy increased the E. coli outer membrane permeability, and then accelerated the transport of the \u03b1-CGTase across the outer membrane. This is confirmed by both the rapid decrease in the periplasmic \u03b1-CGTase activity during 60-90 h of induction and the simultaneous increase in the extracellular \u03b1-CGTase activity (Fig. 2) . In summary, this study showed that when the \u03b1-CGTase from P. macerans strain JFB05-01 was expressed in E. coli as a recombinant fusion protein carrying a pelB leader sequence, a two-stage induction temperature control strategy can help to obtain the optimal extracellular \u03b1-CGTase production. In this two-stage induction temperature control strategy, induction was conducted at 25 \u00b0C for 32 h, and then the temperature was shifted to 30 \u00b0C and the induction was continued for an additional 58 h. Using this two-stage induction control strategy, the extracellular \u03b1-CGTase activity was increased by 45% compared with the induction at a constant temperature of 25 \u00b0C. The primary mechanism responsible for the increase of the \u03b1-CGTase production was due to the increase of the membrane permeability. This is the first report describing a two-stage temperature control strategy used for increasing the extracellular \u03b1-CGTase production in E. coli.
