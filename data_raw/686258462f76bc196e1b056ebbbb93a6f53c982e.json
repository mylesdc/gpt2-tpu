However, the underlying mechanism remains elusive, and in particular, the transcriptional profile induced by IFN-\u03bb3 has not been reported. Here, to resolve the mechanism responsible for the disparity between IFN-\u03bb3 and type I IFN in anti-mucosal virus infection, we compared the transcription profiles induced by the two IFNs in porcine intestinal epithelial (IPEC-J2) cells by RNA-Seq. Our results showed that the pretreatment of IPEC-J2 cells with IFN-\u03bb3 resulted in the differential expression of 983 genes. In contrast, IFN-\u03b1 only modified the expression of 134 genes, and 110 of these genes were also observed in the response to IFN-\u03bb3. A transcriptional enrichment analysis indicated that IFN-\u03bb3 or IFN-\u03b1 regulates multiple cellular processes and that IFN-\u03bb3 activates more robust signaling pathways, particularly the antiviral Jak-STAT signaling pathway, than IFN-\u03b1. Furthermore, we verified the RNA-Seq results through an RT-qPCR analysis of IPEC-J2 cells and porcine enteroids. Moreover, transient expression of the porcine rsad2 and mx2 genes among the top 10 genes induced by IFN-\u03bb3 significantly inhibited PEDV infection. Collectively, the data showed that IFN-\u03bb3 induces a unique transcriptional profile that does not completely overlap with that induced by IFN-\u03b1 and strongly elicits a set of genes responsible for the antiviral activity of IFN-\u03bb3.

            "text": "The surface epithelia of the mucosa are the major entry site of most pathogens in the host and serve as a first line of defense against invading pathogens. One of the most important antiviral cytokines in the host is interferons (IFNs), which perform key roles in inhibiting viral infection (1, 2) . The IFN family is categorized into three different types: type I IFN (IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2), type II IFN (IFN-\u03b3), and type III IFN (IFN-\u03bb). Type II IFN, which is primarily produced by T cells and natural killer cells, exerts limited direct antiviral activity and plays a key role in modulating the host immune response (3) , whereas type I IFNs (\u03b1/\u03b2) and the more recently discovered type III IFNs induce a strong antiviral state in responsive cells and play crucial roles in controlling viral infection (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) . Although type I IFNs have generally been thought to be a key element against systemic infections, recent research has shown that IFN-\u03bb plays a critical role in mucosal infections, such as enteric infection (9, 10) . Unlike type I IFNs that are secreted by a wide range of different cell types upon stimulation, type III IFNs are primarily produced by epithelial cells, NK cells, and dendritic cells (DCs) (8, (11) (12) (13) . IFN-\u03bb acts primarily on the mucosal epithelium, which might result in fewer side effects compared with type I IFN treatment (8) . These features make IFN-\u03bb a potentially superior antiviral therapeutic candidate against local mucosal infection (7) .",

            "text": "Although the receptors for type I and III IFNs are different, the binding of both type I and III IFNs to their corresponding receptors stimulates a Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer of transcription (STAT) pathway, and the stimulation of this pathways subsequently drives the transcription of IFNstimulated genes (ISGs) and prompts cells toward an antiviral status (14) . Consistent with the similarity of the induced signaling pathways, the spectrum of genes elicited by the two types of IFNs show a high overlap (2) . However, recent studies have demonstrated that type III IFNs are critical non-redundant antiviral mediators of type I IFNs in the GI tract (2) . To date, numerous studies in humans or mice have taken advantage of RNA-Seq or chip assays to show that IFN-\u03bb and IFN-\u03b1 elicit distinct downstream signaling events, even though many genes are induced by both type I and III IFNs (15, 16) . Mice with type I IFN or III IFN receptor knockout experience more severe viral intestinal infections, but Ifnl \u2212/\u2212 mice show higher viral loads and more serious clinical symptoms than IFNAR \u2212/\u2212 mice (17, 18) . Studies conducted by Pott et al. showed that intestinal epithelial cells exhibit stronger responses to IFN-\u03bb compared with IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 in vivo (19, 20) . A comprehensive understanding of the unique signaling profiles of type I and III IFNs has become increasingly important for understanding host-virus interactions and the development of IFN-\u03bb therapeutics. However, thus far, no direct comparative analyses of the transcriptional profiles induced by porcine type I vs. type III IFNs in swine intestinal epithelia have been performed.",

To confirm this disparity in the antiviral activities of IFN-\u03bb3 and IFN-\u03b1 against PEDV, IPEC-J2 cells were primed with IFN-\u03b1 (1,000 ng/ml) or IFN-\u03bb3 (1,000 ng/ml) for 24 h and then infected with PEDV (MOI = 1). Consistent with our previous results, both IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03bb3 substantially suppressed PEDV infection in IPEC-J2 cells, as demonstrated by measurements of the viral genomes and titers by RT-qPCR ( Figure 1A ) and TCID 50 titration (Figure 1B) , respectively. IFN-\u03b1 reduced the number of PEDV genomes by 24-fold, whereas IFN-\u03bb3 decreased the number of PEDV genomes by approximately 342-fold. The virus titers were consistent with results of PEDV genomes: PEDV titers decreased 10and 100-fold after pretreatment with IFN-\u03b1 or IFN-\u03bb3, respectively. The inhibition of PEDV infection by both IFN\u03b1 and IFN-\u03bb3 was further verified by PEDV N protein IFA ( Figure 1C) . The virus-infected cells were significantly decreased after pretreatment with IFN-\u03b1 or IFN-\u03bb3, whereas the number of PEDV-infected cells in the IFN-\u03bb3-pretreated group was significantly decreased, as demonstrated by only a few sporadically distributed cells, compared with those in the IFN\u03b1-pretreated group. Thus, IFN-\u03bb3 restricted PEDV infection in IPEC-J2 cells more effectively than IFN-\u03b1, regardless of the quantification of viral RNA, infectivity, or viral protein (Figure 1 ).",

This duration of stimulation (24 h) was selected based on the efficacy of viral inhibition after exposure to IFN-\u03bb3 and IFN-\u03b1 (Figure 1 ) (22) . Each of the triple replicate yielded more than 3.89 \u00d7 10 7 clean reads and has more than 95% Q20 (%), indicating the reliability of the RNA-Seq data. The IFN-\u03bb3stimulated cells showed a total of 997 differentially expressed genes, including 983 upregulated genes and 14 downregulated genes, compared with the mock control, whereas IFN-\u03b1 only upregulated the expression of 122 genes among the total of 126 differentially expressed genes and reduced the expression of four genes (Figure 2A) . The number of IFN-\u03bb3-modified genes was approximately 10-fold higher than that of IFN-\u03b1modified genes. These results indicate that the intestine epithelia respond better to IFN-\u03bb3 than to IFN-\u03b1. We further grouped the corresponding genes through supervised partitioning clustering and combined the differentially expressed genes induced by IFN-\u03bb3 and IFN-\u03b1 to obtain the heat map ( Figure 2B ) and the venn map ( Figure 2C ). IFN-\u03bb3 yielded different gene expression profiles compared with that induced by IFN-\u03b1, even though these showed substantial overlap ( Figure 2B) . One hundred ten genes were upregulated in both the IFN-\u03bb3-and IFN-\u03b1-treated cells, whereas 873 and 12 genes were uniquely upregulated in the presence of IFN-\u03bb3 and IFN-\u03b1, respectively ( Figure 2C) . None of the coexpression genes were downregulated in both the IFN-\u03bb3-and IFN-\u03b1-treated cells, whereas 14 and 4 genes were only downregulated in the presence of IFN-\u03bb3 and IFN\u03b1, respectively. These results demonstrated that IFN-\u03bb3 induces a unique gene transcriptional profile in the intestine epithelia compared with IFN-\u03b1.",

Among the 983 genes upregulated by IFN-\u03bb3, 221 and 134 genes (22.17 and 13.44% of the total genes, respectively) were associated with a binding function and catalysis, respectively, and these two functions account for the main molecular functional changes. The dominant functions of the IFN-\u03b1-regulated genes are cellular transporter activity and nucleic acid-binding transcription factor activity, and these functions were associated with 40 genes (31.75% of total genes) and 22 genes (17.46% of total genes), respectively. The analysis of cellular components revealed that 221 differentially expressed genes in the IFN-\u03bb3-treated group affected the cell part, and 36 genes associated with this cellular component were differentially expressed in the IFN-\u03b1-treated group. With respect to biological processes, the IFN-\u03bb3-treated group included 200, 173, 169, 142, and 120 differentially expressed genes associated with the cellular process, the single-organism process, biological regulation, the metabolic process, and response to stimulus, respectively. The pattern obtained for the IFN-\u03b1-treated group was similar to that of the IFN-\u03bb3-treated group, and the differentially expressed genes were also concentrated on the following five functions: the cellular process, the single-organism process, the biological regulation, the metabolic process, and the response to stimulus. However, the numbers of differentially expressed genes after IFN-\u03b1 treatment were notably lower than those obtained after IFN-\u03bb3 treatment. These results indicated that both IFN-\u03bb3 and IFN-\u03b1 are involved in the regulation of multiple cellular processes in IPEC-J2 cells, such as cellular components and molecular functions, but IFN-\u03bb3 exerts more potent effects than IFN-\u03b1. To further investigate the function of genes specifically induced by IFN-\u03bb3, we extracted the transcriptional profiles of IFN-\u03bb3 and IFN-\u03b1 regarding biological processes (p < 0.01) and combined them based on the -log 10 (p) values to obtain a heat map that showed the enrichment of biological processes ( Figure S1 ). The data demonstrated that in IPEC-J2 cells, IFN-\u03bb3 stimulation triggered more biological reaction processes than IFN-\u03b1, and these processes mainly involved the modulation of metabolic processes, including cellular metabolic processes, macromolecular metabolic processes, and primary metabolic regulation. Taken together, these results indicate that the differentially expressed genes induced by IFN-\u03bb3 are involved in more intracellular biological processes than those induced by IFN-\u03b1.",

            "text": "To explore the clustering of the IFN-induced differential expression genes in anti-viral signaling pathways, we performed a KEGG enrichment analysis of the differentially expressed genes using KOBAS 3.0. The KEGG enrichment analysis revealed that the differentially expressed genes induced by IFN-\u03bb3 involved in much broader signal pathways compared with IFN-\u03b1 though they both primarily modified the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway, the Jak-STAT signaling pathway, the phosphoinositide-3-kinase-Akt (PI3K-Akt) signaling pathway, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, and the cGMP-PKG signaling pathway ( Figure 4A) . To determine the signaling pathways involving the differentially expressed genes induced by IFN-\u03bb3 or IFN-\u03b1, we combined the differentially expressed genes and analyzed their expression patterns ( Figure 4B) . The results showed that the differentially expressed genes were most abundantly involved in the Jak-STAT signaling pathway, followed by the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway and the MAPK signaling pathway, which is consistent with the finding that the Jak-STAT signaling pathway primarily mediates IFN-induced antiviral responses. Among the proteins encoded by the differentially expressed genes, SOS2, PIK3CA, JAK2, IL-6, SOCS4, IL-28B, STAT1, IL22RA1, and SOCS1 play a major role in the Jak-STAT signaling pathway, and KRAS, PIK3AP1, PRKAA1, ENSSSCG00000021148, ENSSSCG00000022362, and MAP3K2 play a major role in the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. To predict the protein interactions between differentially expressed genes, we extracted the union of differentially expressed genes and introduced these into the web-based tool STRING (http:// www.string-db.org/) to generate protein-protein interaction networks ( Figure 4C) . The results of the STRING analysis indicated that JAK2, STAT2, PTEN, PIK3CA, IRS1, KRAS, and IL6ST are closely related to other proteins and displayed significant differential expression compared with the IFN-\u03b1induced proteins, which play critical roles in the innate immune response induced by IFN. Collectively, the results showed that the IFN-\u03bb3-induced differentially expressed genes are involved in more signaling pathways, particularly those associated with innate immunity, than those induced by IFN-\u03b1, which indicates that IFN-\u03bb3 exhibits stronger antiviral activity in intestinal epithelial cells.",

The expression of the 100 top genes in all three subgroups induced by IFN-\u03bb3 was significantly higher compared with that induced by IFN-\u03b1 ( Figure 5) . The ISGs in the classic ISG subgroup are primarily the classical ISGs induced by IFN reported in the literature (16, 27) . The levels of ISGs in this subgroup induced by IFN-\u03bb3 were from 3-to 23-fold higher than those induced by IFN\u03b1. The weakly IFN-\u03bb3-induced gene subgroup contained 25 genes, including three unknown genes (being denoted UN1, UN2, and UN3). The analysis of this subgroup showed that both IFN-\u03bb3 and IFN-\u03b1 induced a more than 4-fold increase in the expression of ISGs compared with mock control. The IFN-\u03bb3-induced expression levels of IFIT3, OASL, OAS1, and GBP4, which are important innate immunity factors, were 10fold higher than those induced by IFN-\u03b1. The expression of 16 of the genes in the strongly IFN-\u03bb3-induced gene subgroup was strongly induced by IFN-\u03bb3, whereas IFN-\u03b1 did not induce a substantial increase in expression (<2-fold compared with the mock control). Interestingly, radical S-adenosyl methionine domain containing 2 (RSAD2), a multifunctional protein with broad antiviral activity that can inhibit both DNA and RNA viruses, is the top gene upregulated by IFN-\u03bb3 (28) . In contrast, IFN-\u03b1 did not substantially upregulate RSAD2 expression. Protein interaction prediction analysis of differentially expressed genes by string database. The relevant genes were input into string (http://www.string-db. org/), the active interaction sources were selected as homology, and the experimentally determined interaction and database annotated were used as predictive conditions for protein interaction prediction. The thickness of the line represents combined score, which is the combined score of the prediction results of the three prediction conditions, indicating the strength of data support.",

We cloned porcine mx2 or rsad2 into the eukaryotic expression vector pCAGGS-HA, and the transient expression of pMX2 or pRSAD2 in Vero E6 cells was verified by IFA (data not shown).

Despite the similarities between the effects of the two types of IFNs, increasing evidence demonstrates that each class of IFN is essential for antiviral host defense and is not functionally redundant (2) . A previous study in mice demonstrated that the role of IFN-\u03bb in functionally redundant intestinal viral infections cannot be compensated by IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 (20) . Therefore, clarification of the induction of cell-specific IFN signaling profiles is essential for understanding the non-redundant roles of IFN-\u03bb and IFN-\u03b1 in viral infection at the tissue and organism levels. In this study, we found that the transcriptional profile induced by type III IFN in the intestinal epithelia The differences between groups were compared using an unpaired Mann-Whitney test.

Type I and III IFNs each signal through different heterodimeric complex receptors to initiate multiple downstream signaling pathways. In addition to activation of the Jak-STAT signaling pathway, IFNs also activate the PI3K and MAPK signaling cascades (5, 32) . The combined use of these signaling pathways by IFNs and many other cytokines might help explain the different roles of IFNs in regulating the antiviral and immune responses in a variety of environments and locations. We have very limited knowledge on the pathways activated by IFN-\u03bb, which are important for understanding the immune-modulating activities of IFN-\u03bb (8) . In this study, we found that IFN-\u03bb3 not only activates the classical antiviral response Jak-STAT signaling pathway but also primarily activated the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway, the cAMP signal pathway, the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, and MAPK signaling pathway (Figure 4) . IFN-\u03bb3 activated much more signaling pathways in epithelia than IFN-\u03b1, and this finding might provide new insights into the mechanism through which IFN-\u03bb modulates other cellular functions beyond its direct antiviral activity. IFN-\u03bb3 largely stimulated Wnt signaling pathway in IEC compared with IFN-\u03b1, which plays critical roles in maintaining the homeostasis of intestinal epithelia in vivo (33) . Further studies of different signaling pathways induced by IFN-\u03bb3 or IFN-\u03b1 will help dissect the complex interaction of IFN-induced signaling pathways with similar or overlapping intracellular signaling pathways stimulated by other cytokines.",

We demonstrated that the porcine intestinal epithelia respond to both type I and III IFNs, even though these IFNs induced different ISG expression levels. Type III IFNs comprise four functional and highly homologous subtypes, namely, IFN-\u03bb1, IFN-\u03bb2, IFN-\u03bb3, and IFN-\u03bb4, in humans. Our study and other studies have revealed differences in antiviral activity among different IFN-\u03bb subtypes (22, 23, 34) . IFN-\u03bb3 is superior or equal to IFN-\u03bb1 in terms of its antiviral activity in the intestinal epithelia (22) and the immortalized liver cell line HepG2 in vitro (34) . The different kinetics and magnitude of ISG induction after stimulation might account for the variation in the antiviral activity among different types or subtypes IFNs. Previous studies that attempted to identify the gene profiles induced by type III IFNs primarily focused on the comparison of IFN-\u03bb1 with type I IFN (15) , and most of these studies were performed in immortalized human or mouse cell lines. The gene transcription profile induced by IFN-\u03bb3, particularly the gene transcription profile induced by IFN-\u03bb3 in porcine intestinal epithelial cells, has not been reported. Here, we performed comparative analyses of the transcriptional profiles induced by IFN-\u03bb3 and IFN-\u03b1 in porcine intestinal epithelia cells. More importantly, in this study, we verified the RNA-Seq results in primary swine crypt-derived enteroids, an in vitro system that well recapitulates the complicated cellularity of the GI tract, which exhibits a potent response to both type I and III IFNs (21, 27, 35) . The differential expression in IPEC-J2 or enteroids detected by qPCR is not related to the selection of housekeeping gene GAPDH since we observed the same pattern when using another housekeeping gene actin (data not shown). Therefore, studying the differences among IFN-\u03bb3-and IFN-\u03b1-induced gene expression in enteroids is more realistic and clinically significant.",

The functions of some of the genes that were strongly induced by IFN-\u03bb3 have been reported, but the functions and mechanisms of more genes remain unclear. RSAD2, a host viral restrictor gene, showed the highest upregulated levels after IFN-\u03bb3 rather than IFN-\u03b1 stimulation, whereas MX1 was the most highly upregulated gene after IFN-\u03b1 stimulation. A previous study demonstrated that porcine RSAD2 effectively inhibited CSFV replication in vitro, and this effect might occur via the interaction of RSAD2 with CSFV E2 protein in the cytoplasm (28) . Our study found that RSAD2 transient expression also substantially curtailed PEDV infection in Vero E6 cells in vitro, but the mechanism is unclear. MX2, an IFN-induced GTPbinding protein (36, 37) , reportedly inhibits the replication of lentivirus HIV-1, simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), and equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) in vitro (38, 39) . The function of porcine MX2 has been poorly studied. We confirmed that porcine MX2 inhibits PEDV infection in Vero E6 cells.
