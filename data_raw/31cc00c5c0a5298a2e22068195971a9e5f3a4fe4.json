[1] [2] [3] [4] Principles of evidence-based methods to assess the effectiveness of health care interventions and set policy are cited increasingly. 5 Meta-analysis, a systematic approach to identifying, appraising, synthesizing, and (if appropriate) combining the results of relevant studies to arrive at conclusions about a body of research, has been applied with increasing frequency to randomized controlled trials (RCTs), which are considered to provide the strongest evidence regarding an intervention. 6, 7 However, in many situations randomized controlled designs are not feasible, and only data from observational studies are available. 8 Here, we define an observational study as an etiologic or effectiveness study using data from an existing database, a cross-sectional study, a case series, a case-control design, a design with historical controls, or a cohort design. 9 Observational designs may lack the experimental element of a random allocation to an intervention and rely on studies of association between changes or differences in 1 characteristic (eg, an exposure or intervention) and changes or differences in an outcome of interest. These designs have long been used in the evaluation of educational programs 10 and exposures that might cause disease or injury. 11 Studies of risk factors generally cannot be randomized because they relate to inherent human characteristics or practices, and exposing subjects to harmful risk factors is unethical. 12 At times, clinical data may be summarized in order to design a randomized comparison. 13 Observational data may also be needed to assess the effectiveness of an intervention in a community as opposed to the special setting of a controlled trial. 14 Thus, a clear understanding of the advantages and limitations of statistical syntheses of observational data is needed. 15 Although meta-analysis restricted to RCTs is usually preferred to metaanalyses of observational studies, [16] [17] [18] the number of published meta-analyses concerning observational studies in health has increased substantially during the past 4 decades (678 in 1955-1992, 525 in 1992-1995 , and more than 400 in 1996 alone). 19 While guidelines for meta-analyses have been proposed, many are written from the meta-analyst's (author's) rather than from the reviewer's, editor's, or reader's perspective 20 and restrict attention to reporting of meta-analyses of RCTs. 21, 22 Meta-analyses of observational studies present particular challenges because of inherent biases and differences in study designs 23 ; yet, they may provide a tool for helping to understand and quantify sources of variability in results across studies. 24 We describe here the results of a workshop held in Atlanta, Ga, in April 1997, to examine concerns regarding the reporting of Meta-analysis Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE). This article summarizes deliberations of 27 participants (the MOOSE group) of evidence leading to recommendations regarding the reporting of meta-analyses. Meta-analysis of individual-level data from different studies, sometimes called \"pooled analysis\" or \"meta-analysis of individual patient data,\" 25, 26 has unique challenges that we will not address here. We propose a checklist of items for reporting that builds on similar activities for RCTs 22 and is intended for use by authors, reviewers, editors, and readers of metaanalyses of observational studies.",

Published research shows that use of electronic databases may find only half of all relevant studies, and contacting authors may be useful, 27 although this result may not be true for all topic areas. 28 For example, a meta-analysis of depression in elderly medical inpatients 29 used 2 databases for the search. In addition, bibliographies of retrieved papers were searched. However, the authors did not report their search strategy in enough detail to allow replication. An example of a thorough \"reject log\" can be found in the report of a metaanalysis of electrical and magnetic field exposure and leukemia. 30 Examples of a table characterizing studies included can be found in Franceschi et al 31 and Saag et al. 32 Complete specification of search strategy is not uniform; a review of 103 published meta-analyses in education showed that search procedures were described inadequately in the majority of the articles. 10",

Empirical evidence shows that reporting of procedures for classification and coding and quality assessment is often incomplete: fewer than half of the meta-analyses reported details of classifying and coding the primary study data, and only 22% assessed quality of the primary studies. 10 We recognize that the use of quality scoring in meta-analyses of observa-tional studies is controversial, as it is for RCTs, 16, 33 because scores constructed in an ad hoc fashion may lack demonstrated validity, and results may not be associated with quality. 34 Nevertheless, some particular aspects of study quality have been shown to be associated with effect: eg, adequate concealment of allocation in randomized trials. 35 Thus, key components of design, rather than aggregate scores themselves, may be important. For example, in a study of blinding (masking) of readers participating in meta-analyses, masking essentially made no difference in the summary odds ratios across the 5 meta-analyses. 36 We recommend the reporting of quality scoring if it has been done and also recommend subgroup or sensitivity analysis rather than using quality scores as weights in the analysis. 37, 38 While some control over heterogeneity of design may be accomplished through the use of exclusion rules, we recommend using broad inclusion criteria for studies, and then performing analyses relating design features to outcome. 8 In cases when heterogeneity of outcomes is particularly problematic, a single summary measure may well be inappropriate. 39 Analyses that stratify by study feature or regression analysis with design features as predictors can be useful in assessing whether study outcomes indeed vary systematically with these features. 40 Investigating heterogeneity was a key feature of a meta-analysis of observational studies of asbestos exposure and risk of gastrointestinal cancer. 41 The authors of the meta-analysis hypothesized that studies allowing for a latent period between the initiation of exposure and any increases in risk should show, on average, appropriately higher standardized mortality ratios than studies that ignored latency. In other words, the apparent effect of exposure would be attenuated by including the latent period in the calculation of time at risk (the \"denominator\"), since exposurerelated deaths (the \"numerator\") would, by definition, not occur during that latent period (FIGURE) .",

Bias can occur in the original studies (resulting from flaws in the study design that tend to distort the magnitude or direction of associations in the data) or from the way in which studies are selected for inclusion. 42 Publication bias, the selective publication of studies based on the magnitude (usually larger) and direction of their findings, represents a particular threat to the validity of meta-analysis of observational studies. [43] [44] [45] Thorough specifications of quality assessment can contribute to understanding some of the variations in the observational studies themselves. Methods should be used to aid in the detection of publication bias, eg, fail-safe procedures or funnel plots. 46 Schlesselman 47 comments on such biases in assessing the possible association between endometrial cancer and oral contraceptives. This meta-analysis combined both cohort and casecontrol studies and used a sensitivity analysis to illustrate the influence of specific studies, such as those published in English.",

Similarly, the extreme diversity of study designs and populations in epidemiology makes the interpretation of simple summaries problematic, at best. In addition, methodologic issues related specifically to metaanalysis, such as publication bias, could have particular impact when combining results of observational studies. 44, 47 Despite these challenges, metaanalyses of observational studies continue to be one of the few methods for assessing efficacy and effectiveness and are being published in increasing numbers. Our goal is to improve the reporting of these meta-analyses so that readers can understand what was done in a given analysis, who did it, and why it was done. If bias is a problem, we suggest that an informative approach is to use broad inclusion criteria for studies and then to perform analyses (when the data permit) relating suspected sources of bias and variability to study findings.",
