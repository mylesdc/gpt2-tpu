            "text": "Acute respiratory infection (ARI) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality with a worldwide disease burden estimated at 112 900 000 disability adjusted life years (DALYs) and 3?5 million deaths. [1, 2] A strict definition of ARI would include all infections of the respiratory tract. However, in practice, acute lower respiratory infection accounts for most of the serious disease burden. ARI causes about 20% of all deaths in pre-school children worldwide, with 90% of these deaths being due to pneumonia. Risk factors for severe ARI include malnutrition, low birth weight, passive smoking, nonbreastfeeding, low socio-economic status, overcrowding, immu-nodeficiency and HIV infection, and consequently, most of the morbidity associated with ARI is found in the developing world. [3, 4, 5] ARI causative organisms are predominantly bacterial (most commonly Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae) or viral, although it is not possible to differentiate between them based on clinical signs or radiology. New pathogens are frequently being reported in the literature, including Coronaviruses (NL63 and HKU1), human Metapneumovirus (hMPV) and human Bocavirus (hBoV). [6, 7, 8, 9] This expansion in the number of pathogens, combined with an increased ability to simultaneously test for multiple organisms, has highlighted the potential role of coinfection, with the detection of more than one pathogen from a single sample, although their significance with regard to disease severity remains debatable. [10, 11] The causes of ARI in children under-5 years have been studied in different environments and populations. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), hMPV, Rhinoviruses (hRV) and Para-influenza viruses (PIV) have consistently been shown to predominate, with some displaying strong seasonal peaks and with co-infection with more than one viral pathogen occurring in 4-33% of children. [11, 12, 13, 14] Few studies however have attempted to determine whether particular viruses are associated with differing severities of disease. Those that have, have concentrated on the more severe end of the disease severity spectrum i.e. those children with RSV disease hospitalized or ventilated on intensive care. [15] Similarly, few studies have examined in detail the viral causes of specific clinical conditions in the under-5 age group. [16] The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and seasonal distribution of viral and atypical bacterial pathogens in a cohort of well-characterised children under the age of 5 years presenting to a paediatric A&E department in North-Eastern Brazil with various severities and clinical manifestations of ARI.",

Interestingly most pathogens were detected across all disease severity categories, although RSV and Mpp were more frequently detected among children with severe disease, respectively confirming and highlighting the importance of these pathogens. RSV was also more likely to be detected in nasopharyngeal aspirates from hospitalised than ambulatory children with bronchiolitis.

Perceived wisdom and published literature state that Mpp is a wellrecognised cause of community-acquired pneumonia in older children and adults, [27] but a less common cause in preschool children, although few studies have examined prevalence in this age group. [12] Thus our findings that Mpp could be detected in approximately 10% of all children with ARI and 17% of hospitalised pneumonia cases is important and has potential implications for management, given that current treatment guidelines for pneumonia in this age group do not include macrolide antibiotics. [28] Interestingly, Mpp was more likely to be detected in hospitalised than ambulatory children with bronchiolitis, a finding which may in part reflect the difficulties in clinically distinguishing between pneumonia and bronchiolitis in young children.",

While this may be because we had smaller numbers of children in the very mild and severe categories, co-infection was consistently between 39-42% across all groups. Our study was also not powered to detect whether particular pathogen combinations were associated with more severe disease. Similarly, severe disease was no more or less common in those children in whom pathogens were not detected. In these children, one might speculate about possible infection with 'typical' bacteria such as Streptococcus and Haemophilus, although it is equally possible that viruses as yet unknown could have caused their symptoms.",

Equally, while the study screened more pathogens than most published studies, some pathogens, such as Bordetella pertussis were not included. Other valid criticisms include that real-time PCR may be overly sensitive and that pathogen detection in the nasopharynx may not accurately reflect the situation in the lower respiratory tract.
