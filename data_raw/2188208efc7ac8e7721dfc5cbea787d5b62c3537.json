Prefusion-stabilized RSV F variants have been engineered as vaccine antigens, but crystal structures of these variants have revealed conformational differences in a key antigenic site located at the apex of the trimer, referred to as antigenic site \u00d8. Currently, it is unclear if flexibility in this region is an inherent property of prefusion RSV F or if it is related to inadequate stabilization of site \u00d8 in the engineered variants. Therefore, we set out to investigate the conformational flexibility of antigenic site \u00d8, as well as the ability of the human immune system to recognize alternative conformations of this site, by determining crystal structures of prefusion RSV F bound to neutralizing human-derived antibodies AM22 and RSD5. Both antibodies bound with high affinity and were specific for the prefusion conformation of RSV F. Crystal structures of the complexes revealed that the antibodies recognized distinct conformations of antigenic site \u00d8, each diverging at a conserved proline residue located in the middle of an \u03b1-helix. These data suggest that antigenic site \u00d8 exists as an ensemble of conformations, with individual antibodies recognizing discrete states. Collectively, these results have implications for the refolding of pneumovirus and paramyxovirus fusion proteins and should inform development of prefusion-stabilized RSV F vaccine candidates.",

There are two subtypes of RSV, A and B, to which many individual strains belong. RSV has two major glycoproteins on the viral surface important for entry: the fusion (F) and attachment (G) glycoproteins [7] . Whereas RSV G is the primary source of sequence variation and defines the subtype of a specific virus, the fusion glycoprotein is well conserved with sequence identities >90% [8] . RSV F is a class I fusion glycoprotein initially produced as an inactive precursor, F0, that is subsequently cleaved by furin-like proteases to generate a protomer of disulfide-linked subunits, F1 and F2 [9] [10] [11] [12] . Three of these protomers associate to form the functional trimeric glycoprotein required for membrane fusion and infection [13] [14] [15] . Numerous vaccine trials for RSV are currently underway [16] , many of which contain the RSV F glycoprotein as an antigen because it has been shown that F is a major target of neutralizing antibodies [17, 18] and is the only protein on the viral surface that is strictly required for entry [19, 20] .",

            "text": "RSV F initially folds into a metastable prefusion conformation, with fusion peptides buried within the central cavity of the trimer [8] . During viral entry, RSV F triggers to undergo a dramatic conformational rearrangement from the prefusion to postfusion state. The triggering process results in release of the fusion peptides from the central cavity of the trimer and their insertion into the target-cell membrane, resulting in the formation of an unstable prehairpin intermediate. Collapse of this intermediate into the stable postfusion conformation brings the virus and host-cell membranes together, facilitating formation of a fusion pore and release of the viral genome into the target cell [7, 15] . However, the mechanism and underlying cause of RSV F triggering is not well understood. Recombinant virus expressing only the RSV F protein on its surface is sufficient for infection of immortalized cell lines in vitro, suggesting that RSV F can facilitate attachment and mediate fusion in the absence of the attachment glycoprotein [7, [20] [21] [22] . Potential RSV F receptors include nucleolin, EGFR, and heparan sulfate proteoglycans, among others [7, [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] , but the specific role each may play in the setting of natural infection remains to be defined. In addition, in vitro experiments have demonstrated that RSV F has a propensity to trigger upon exposure to elevated temperatures [28] and hypo-osmotic conditions [29] , and RSV F has even been shown to spontaneously trigger and refold over time due to the metastable nature of the prefusion conformation [30] . This raises the possibility that RSV F does not have a specific receptor that initiates triggering and fusion, but rather that spontaneous triggering in the presence of attachment factors, such as heparan sulfate proteoglycans [31] , is sufficient for entry.",

Antigenic site \u00d8 is located at the membrane-distal apex of the trimer and includes the \u03b14-helix and the loop connecting \u03b14 to \u03b15 (\u03b14-\u03b15 loop) of F1, and the F2 loop between \u03b22 and \u03b11. Upon triggering, site \u00d8 undergoes an extensive structural rearrangement in which \u03b14 and the \u03b14-\u03b15 loop refold to form the continuous \u03b15-helix observed in the postfusion F conformation [8] . Comparison of the neutralization potency of two site \u00d8 antibodies, D25 [34] and 5C4 [35] , with palivizumab, a site II-directed conformation-independent antibody [36] , demonstrated that the prefusionspecific antibodies are 10-100 times more potent [8] . Other potent prefusion-specific human antibodies that bind to the apex of the trimer, such as AM22 and RSD5, have also been isolated in recent years [8, 37, 38] , and one of them (MEDI8897) is now in advanced stages of clinical development [39] .",

Recently, the structure of 5C4 bound to RSV F was determined, revealing a nearly identical conformation of prefusion RSV F as that observed in the D25-bound structure [42] . However, crystal structures of the different prefusion-stabilized variants of RSV F have revealed an alternative conformation of antigenic site \u00d8 or weak electron density in this region, suggesting that this site is flexible. Currently, it is unclear if flexibility in this region is an inherent property of prefusion RSV F that may be important for triggering membrane fusion [41] , or if it is related to inadequate stabilization of site \u00d8 in the engineered variants [40] . Therefore, we sought to investigate the conformational plasticity of site \u00d8 by determining and comparing the crystal structures of prefusion RSV F in complex with AM22 and RSD5. Our results demonstrate that prefusion RSV F adopts at least three alternative conformations of site \u00d8 and that potently neutralizing human antibodies can recognize the alternative conformations using distinct binding modes. This suggests that site \u00d8 samples an ensemble of conformations in vivo, at least some of which can be recognized by neutralizing human antibodies. These results should influence future vaccine designs and may have implications for the mechanism of RSV F triggering.",

However, differences in antibody kinetics and subtype specificities have not been fully explored. Therefore, we used surface plasmon resonance (SPR) to determine the binding affinity and kinetics of the interaction between three site \u00d8 antibodies (AM22, D25, and RSD5) and prefusion RSV F derived from each subtype (strains A2 and B9320) (Fig 1) . For these studies, we worked with a germline-reverted version of RSD5 Kinetic parameters of AM22, D25, and RSD5-GL antibodies binding to prefusion RSV F. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensorgrams of AM22, D25, and RSD5-GL Fabs binding to prefusion RSV F from (A) subtype A (strain A2) or (B) subtype B (strain B9320). The raw data is plotted as a black line and the fitted curve used to calculate the binding kinetics is plotted as a thicker red line. Each binding curve has a 180 second association phase, followed by a 500 second dissociation phase. The equilibrium dissociation constant (K D ) is displayed immediately above the SPR curve for each Fab. (C) A table of the association rate constants (k a ) and dissociation rate constants (k d ) determined for the binding kinetics of each Fab. A value of <1 x 10 \u22125 was used as the lower limit for the dissociation rate constant (k d ) that can be accurately measured by a Biacore X100. (RSD5-GL), which had 20 somatic mutations in the framework regions reverted to germline residues to minimize immunogenicity (S1 Fig). Of note, RSD5-GL showed similar neutralization potency and binding kinetics for prefusion RSV F as compared to the parental RSD5 antibody (RSD5-WT) (S2 Fig). Despite similar neutralization potencies, AM22, D25, and RSD5 displayed distinct affinities and binding kinetics when compared to each other as well as when compared individually across the two RSV subtypes. The AM22 antigen-binding fragment (Fab) has an~50-fold higher affinity for subtype A with an equilibrium dissociation constant (K D ) of 0.12 nM, whereas its affinity for subtype B is 6.1 nM. Similarly, D25 Fab binds tightly to prefusion RSV F with a slight preference for subtype A, consistent with previously published data [43] , having a K D of <0.064 nM and 0.33 nM for subtype A and B, respectively. In contrast, RSD5-GL Fab has substantial subtype specificity with a >2,000-fold stronger affinity for subtype B compared to subtype A, with a K D of <0.016 nM and 34 nM, respectively. Preferential binding of RSD5-GL for subtype B is primarily due to the off-rate, which is fast for the subtype A interaction and slow for the subtype B interaction.",

The light chain is responsible for the remaining 175 \u00c5 2 (24%) of buried surface area on prefusion RSV F and forms three additional hydrogen bonds with the \u03b14-\u03b15 loop via the CDR L2. The high affinity and specificity of AM22 for prefusion RSV F (Fig 1 and S3 Fig) is due to the formation of a three-strand anti-parallel \u03b2-sheet between the CDR H3 of AM22 and \u03b14-\u03b15 loop of F1 ( Fig 2B) . When bound by AM22, the \u03b14-helix kinks near residue Pro205 and shifts away from \u03b15, stretching the \u03b14-\u03b15 loop and allowing it to adopt a \u03b2-strand conformation that pairs with the \u03b2-hairpin formed by the CDR H3 of AM22. Upon RSV F triggering and the rearrangement into the postfusion conformation, \u03b14 and the \u03b14-\u03b15 loop refold into the continuous \u03b15-helix, which would disrupt the \u03b2-sheet interaction and prevent AM22 binding.",

The crystal structure shows that three RSD5-GL Fabs bind to the membrane-distal apex of the prefusion RSV F trimer ( Fig 3A) . RSD5-GL binds slightly lower on the trimer than AM22, bridging antigenic site \u00d8 and the recently defined site V [32, 44] . The interactions of RSD5-GL with prefusion RSV F are more diverse than that of AM22, with the CDR H2 and CDR H3 as well as all three CDRs of the light chain making contacts with the F protein ( Fig 3B) . In addition, the contacts on prefusion RSV F span multiple regions including the F2 loop as well as \u03b13 and \u03b14 of F1, burying a total surface area of 855 \u00c5 2 . The RSD5-GL heavy chain buries 577 \u00c5 2 (67%) on the surface of prefusion RSV F. The CDR H3 interacts with \u03b14 and the F2 loop, forming hydrogen bonds with Asp200 and mainchain atoms of Lys65, respectively, whereas the CDR H2 contacts \u03b13 and forms a salt bridge with Lys168. The light chain contributes to the interface through contacts with \u03b14, including hydrogen bonds with Asp200 and main-chain atoms of Pro205 and Gln210. Similar to AM22, the prefusion specificity of RSD5-GL can be explained by the dramatic rearrangement of \u03b13 and \u03b14 to form the single elongated \u03b15-helix upon conversion to the postfusion conformation, which dismantles the RSD5-GL epitope.",

This structure closely matches the unbound prefusion-stabilized RSV F variants DS-Cav1 (PDB ID: 4MMU) and PR-DM (PDB ID: 5C69 [41] ), specifically the kink in the \u03b14-helix and greater angle between \u03b14 and \u03b15.

The structure of DS-Cav1 bound to RSD5-GL reveals an intermediate site \u00d8 conformation, with the \u03b14-helix only slightly kinked out and away from \u03b15, but not to the same degree as seen in the AM22 complex. Because all three of these antibodies were isolated from humans who had experienced natural RSV infection, these structures indicate that site \u00d8 is naturally flexible and adopts at least three states that can be recognized by the human immune system.

In addition, previous publications using SPR and flow cytometry-based competition assays have suggested that AM22 and RSD5 do not compete with D25, but rather occupy a separate prefusion-specific epitope [37, 38] . However, comparing the crystal structures of prefusion RSV F bound to AM22, RSD5-GL, and D25, demonstrates that all three antibody epitopes overlap substantially and would prevent any two from binding simultaneously due to large steric clashes.

Taken together, this suggests that movement of the fusion peptide is conditional upon prior rearrangement of site \u00d8. The only discrepancy between the crystal structures of wild-type prefusion RSV F when bound to D25 and the prefusion-stabilized variant DS-Cav1 is the kinked-open conformation of \u03b14 in the DS-Cav1 model, which was attributed to the cavity-filling V207L mutation being unable to fully stabilize the \u03b14-helix [40] . However, the structure reported here of DS-Cav1 in complex with the human antibody AM22 matches the unbound DS-Cav1 structure and demonstrates that this conformation is a naturally sampled alternative conformation of prefusion RSV F.",

            "text": "Recent vaccine strategies targeting viruses with class I fusion proteins have focused on stabilizing the prefusion conformation of the fusion protein for use as an immunogen. A common approach to achieve prefusion stabilization has been through introduction of one or more proline residues within the loop of a helix-loop-helix motif that refolds into a continuous alpha helix in the postfusion conformation. This strategy has been used successfully to stabilize several class I viral fusion glycoproteins including RSV F, MPV F, influenza HA, HIV Env, and coronavirus Spike [41, [57] [58] [59] [60] . Proline-based stabilization utilizes the restricted phi-psi angles of proline residues and disruption of the alpha-helix hydrogen bond network to inhibit the hinge motion required of the helix-loop-helix motif and the subsequent coil-to-helix structural transition required for refolding into the postfusion conformation. However, for wild-type prefusion RSV F there is a conserved proline residue (Pro205) within the middle of the \u03b14-helix, N-terminal to the \u03b14-\u03b15 loop that may act as a hinge during refolding [41] . Crystal structures of prefusion RSV F demonstrate a variety of alternate conformations adopted by antigenic site \u00d8, all of which diverge near the conserved Pro205. This indicates that Pro205 may disfavor a rigid alpha-helical structure, which in turn facilitates conformational flexibility of site \u00d8 and the tendency of prefusion RSV F to trigger. We note that Pro205 is absolutely conserved in all human and bovine RSV strains, and a proline at an identical position is also commonly found in F proteins from viruses within the Pneumoviridae and Paramyxoviridae families, with the exception of human metapneumoviruses (Fig 5D) . The functional importance of this well-conserved proline residue will need to be evaluated in future studies investigating the triggering mechanism and refolding of pneumovirus and paramyxovirus F proteins.",

Our findings demonstrate that potently neutralizing human antibodies that target antigenic site \u00d8 can recognize a variety of alternative conformations and have varying degrees of subtype specificity.

NCBI basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) was used to identify homologous regions between the hRSV fusion protein sequence (strain A2) and other pneumovirus and paramyxovirus fusion proteins. Specifically, we identified sequences that were indicated to be partially homologous with the residues 195-214 of the hRSV fusion protein sequence derived from strain A2. These residues correspond to the \u03b14-helix and \u03b14-\u03b15 loop within the prefusion RSV F structure. For all known structures of prefusion pneumovirus or paramyxovirus fusion proteins, the homologous sequence also corresponds to the equivalent \u03b14-helix and \u03b14-\u03b15 loop, even if the residue numbering differs. To prevent overrepresentation from viral species which have multiple subtypes sequenced, we only included a single amino acid sequence from each species when the multiple subtypes were >90% identical throughout the residue range corresponding to 195-214 in hRSV F. However, if two subtypes within a single viral species differed by >10% in the residue range corresponding to 195-214 in hRSV F, then they were both included when performing sequence analysis and generating the sequence WebLogo. For example, there are four sequenced strains of human metapneumovirus F, but they are all mostly identical and hence only two representative sequences were included in the final WebLogo (strain A1 and B1). However, there are multiple distinct sequences for the different types of parainfluenza virus (PIV), and therefore all the distinct sequences are included separately when generating the WebLogo. See S1 Table for a full list of sequences used in the WebLogo. The WebLogo was generated using publicly available software at weblogo.berkley.edu.",
