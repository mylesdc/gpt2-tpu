This study reports the detection and genetic characterization of PAstV, PSaV in healthy and diarrheic domestic pigs and PEDV and TGEV in diarrheic pigs of different age groups. Results: The presence of PAstV and PSaV was studied in 411 rectal swabs collected from healthy (n = 251) and diarrheic (n = 160) pigs of different age categories: suckling (n = 143), weaned (n = 147) and fattening (n = 121) animals on farms in Slovakia. The presence of TGEV and PEDV was investigated in the diarrheic pigs (n = 160). A high presence of PAstV infections was detected in both healthy (94.4%) and diarrheic (91.3%) pigs. PSaV was detected less often, but also equally in clinically healthy (8.4%) and diarrheic (10%) pigs. Neither TGEV nor PEDV was detected in any diarrheic sample. The phylogenetic analysis of a part of the RdRp region revealed the presence of all five lineages of PAstV in Slovakia (PAstV-1 -PAstV-5), with the most frequent lineages being PAstV-2 and PAstV-4. Analysis of partial capsid genome sequences of the PSaVs indicated that virus strains belonged to genogroup GIII. Most of the PSaV sequences from Slovakia clustered with sequences originating from neighbouring countries.",

The virus genome is organized into two or three ORFs, which encode both structural and non-structural proteins, including the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and the major capsid protein (VP1) [1] . Due to great genetic variability and recombination capacity, the genus is divided into fifteen different genogroups based on analysis of both capsid and RdRp sequences [9, 10] . Sapoviruses infect a wide variety of hosts including humans, pigs, mink, canines and bats [11] [12] [13] [14] . The porcine sapovirus (PSaV), formerly known as porcine enteric calicivirus (PEC), is divided into GIII, GV -GXI genogroups, but GIII is considered as the prototypic genogroup with the only cultivable Cowden strain [9] .",

Our results indicate that there is no strong correlation between detection of both viruses in enteric samples and diarrhea.

The presencee of PKV-1 as a newly emerged virus, which role in gastroenteritis is still unknown, has been similar in both, healthy and diarrheic pigs, as has been observed for PAstV and PSaV in this work. However, the detection of RVA in suckling piglets, but not in weaned and fattening pigs, was significantly associated with diarrhea, confirming that this virus is a cause of gastroenteritis. In this context it is difficult to conclude, at least from our findings, that PAstV, PSaV and PKV-1 are typical enteric viruses associated with diarrhea which contrasts with conclusions by others [4, 19, 20] . This inconsistency indicates that viruses could express their pathogenicity in only a small percentage of cases as has been already hypothesized by Luo et al. [21] due to co-infection with other gastrointestinal viruses or due to immunodeficiency of animals. However, our data of the co-infection of viruses do not support this hypothesis. In two studies (this work and [18] ) we did not detect strong differences between healthy and diarrheic animals with co-infection of PAstV and PSaV or in the case of rotavirus A coinfection with both PAstV and PSaV. Other studies also indicated that PAstV as a ubiquitous virus has been often found in co-infections with various viruses [7, 8] .",

The phylogenetic tree indicated three different genotypes inside GIII (Fig. 3) as describe by Jeong et al. [34] and Dufkova et al. [7] . The RK O3 isolate showed a phylogenetic relatedness with Czech strain P38/11/CZ which was proposed as \"P38/11-like\" genotype [7] . This isolate was different from other isolates coming from the same farm and represented the only exception when viral isolates from the same farm did not belong to the same cluster.

The tree was constructed on the base of 667 bp nucleotide sequences of capsid PSaV and selected sequences from GenBank (labelled with accession number and country of origin).

The tree was constructed using the neighbour-joining method implemented in MEGA6 software. Scale bar represents the number of nucleotide substitutions per site Generally, most of our PSaV sequences clustered together with sequences originating from PSaV of neighbouring countries. This phenomenon indicates the circulation of related viral isolates in Central Europe. None of the Slovakian isolates has been found to be related to human sapovirus. Thus, at least at present PSaV has no zoonotic risk for human populations.",

On the other side PSaV was found in a small percentage (around 9%) of both, healthy and diarrheic animals with higher occurrence in suckling piglets. The equal presence of both viruses in healthy and diarrheic pigs does not clearly clarify their role in gastrointestinal diseases and their detection has no diagnostic value.
