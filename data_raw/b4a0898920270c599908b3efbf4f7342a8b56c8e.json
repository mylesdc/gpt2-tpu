            "text": "Safe and efficacious orally-delivered mucosal vaccine platforms are desperately needed to combat the plethora of mucosally transmitted pathogens. Lactobacillus spp. have emerged as attractive candidates to meet this need and are known to activate the host innate immune response in a species-and strain-specific manner. For selected bacterial isolates and mutants, we investigated the role of key innate immune pathways required for induction of innate and subsequent adaptive immune responses. Co-culture of murine macrophages with L. gasseri (strain NCK1785), L. acidophilus (strain NCFM), or NCFM-derived mutants-NCK2025 and NCK2031-elicited an M2b-like phenotype associated with TH2 skewing and immune regulatory function. For NCFM, this M2b phenotype was dependent on expression of lipoteichoic acid and S layer proteins. Through the use of macrophage genetic knockouts, we identified Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), the cytosolic nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing 2 (NOD2) receptor, and the inflammasome-associated caspase-1 as contributors to macrophage activation, with NOD2 cooperating with caspase-1 to induce inflammasome derived interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 in a pyroptosis-independent fashion. Finally, utilizing an NCFM-based mucosal vaccine platform with surface expression of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Gag or membrane proximal external region (MPER), we demonstrated that NOD2 signaling is required for antigen-specific mucosal and systemic humoral responses. We show that lactobacilli differentially utilize innate immune pathways and highlight NOD2 as a key mediator of macrophage function and antigen-specific humoral responses to a Lactobacillus acidophilus mucosal vaccine platform.",

At sacrifice, spleen, intestine, female reproductive tract (FRT), mesenteric lymph node (MLN), Peyer's patches (PP), and cecal contents were also harvested [6] . The vaginal vault was lavaged with 100 \u03bcl of PBS and the insoluble debris removed via centrifugation. Fecal pellets were suspended at 100 mg/mL in PBS with 10% goat serum, 2X proteaseArrest (G-Biosciences, St. Louis, MO) and 0.1% Kathon, homogenized (FastPrep-24, MP Bio 4.0 m/s for 20 s for three cycles), and supernatant collected postcentrifugation. Cecal contents were processed by the same method as fecal pellets, but without proteaseArrest. Blood was periodically collected from tail vein or terminally via cardiac puncture. All samples were aliquoted and stored at-80\u02daC until analysis. Single cell suspensions of lymphocytes were isolated from the MLN, PP, spleen, colon, and FRT for ELISpot and B cell phenotyping. MLN were pushed through a 40 \u03bcm cell strainer with a syringe plunger. PP and spleen were dissociated in 5 mL cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) medium using the gentleMACS Octo Dissociator (Miltenyi setting m_spleen_01_01), followed by incubation in ACK (ammonium chloride potassium) buffer to lyse red blood cells in the spleen samples [26] . Colon and FRT were manually cleaned of mucus and debris in PBS, 1mM dithiothreitol, 5 mM EDTA, cut into~1cm pieces, and digested with Liberase TM (125 \u03bcg/mL; Roche Molecular) and DNAse I (grade II 100 \u03bcg/mL; Roche Molecular) in digestion base media (RPMI containing 5 \u03bcg/mL gentamicin, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 \u03bcg/mL streptomycin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for 30 or 60 minutes, respectively, with constant tissue rotation at 37\u02daC.

Post-digestion, tissue was passed through a 70 \u03bcm filter; lymphocytes were isolated using a Percoll gradient and suspended in CTL media as described previously [16] . After dissociation, all cells were washed with CTL media then passed through a 40 \u03bcm strainer. Small intestine ex vivo culture was performed as previously described to assess tissue cytokine production [31, 32] . Briefly, small intestine was opened longitudinally, irrigated with PBS, and shaken for 30 minutes at 240 rpm, room temperature (RT), in digestion base media. Tissue was subsequently blotted, weighed, diced, and distributed into a 24-well plate (0.05 g/well) with 150 \u03bcl CTL media.

Ordinarily, lactobacilli taken up by macrophages are exposed to hydrolytic enzymes in the phagolysosome that digest PGN into constitutive components, including MDP. To demonstrate the ability of MDP from different lactobacilli to activate NOD2, we exposed HEK293 cells stably transfected with human NOD2 linked to a secreted embryonic alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) reporter gene to lysozymedigested lactobacilli. Despite strain-dependent variability in the susceptibility of bacteria to lysozyme digestion, the soluble and insoluble fractions of each lactobacilli species, strain, and mutant strongly activated NOD2 (Fig 1) to a degree not significantly different from the positive control (NOD2 ligand, L18-MDP).",

Since Nod2 was required for NCFM immune activation of macrophages, we sought to determine whether our NCFMderived oral immunization strategy expressing an HIV-1 model antigen (Gag) was dependent on NOD2 signaling in vivo [6, 20] . WT Nod2+/+ and Nod2-/-C57BL/6 mice were immunized with buffer alone, NCK1895, or NCK2166 by oral gavage (Table 1) . Lymphocytes were collected at sacrifice from the FRT, large intestine (LI), PP, MLN, and spleen for flow cytometric phenotyping and determination of IgA secretion via ELISpot. While the percentage of CD45 + CD19 + CD38 -B cells was significantly larger for NCK2166-immunized WT mice than for NCK2166-immunized Nod2-/-mice for most mucosal and systemic tissues (P < 0.05), this did not correspond with differences in IgA-producing cells as measured via ELISpot (Fig 5a and 5b) . To determine whether NOD2 status dictated differential antigen-specific IgA levels, cecal contents and vaginal lavage samples were collected from mice at sacrifice and mucosal anti-Gag IgA was measured by ELISA. Gag-specific IgA levels in cecal contents were not statistically significantly different between NCK2166-immunized Nod+/+ and Nod-/-mice (Fig 5c) . After immunization with NCK2166, only 2 of 6 Nod2-/mice and no Nod2+/+ mice were positive for antigen-specific IgA in cecal contents (Fig 5c) . No mice were positive for antigen-specific IgA in vaginal washes. Conversely, Gag-specific IgG levels in sera were statistically significant, with antigen-specific serum IgG detected in 5 of 6 WT mice compared to 0 of 6 Nod2-/-mice. Antibody responses to the highly expressed surface layer protein A (SlpA) of L. acidophilus can serve as an endogenous bacterial antigen for comparison against recombinant antigen responses. We found no correlation between anti-SlpA IgA or IgG seroconversion and HIV-specific antibody responses in C57BL/6 mice (Fig 5d) .",

Here, despite similar M2b traits, the cytokine profile associated with NCFM was biased toward higher IL-10 and IL-12 (p40), and lower KC than NCK1785. In agreement with previous reports, we show that NCFM LTA has an inflammatory effect since NCK2025, which lacks LTA, is associated with increased IL-10, decreased IL-12 (p40), and decreased CD11b and MHCII expression by macrophages in vitro [23, 24, 48] . Interestingly, TLR2 itself was required for maximal IL-10 production in response to lactobacilli, suggesting that the LTA-TLR2-IL10 axis is complicated by additional PRR ligands or perhaps TLR2 co-receptors [13, 49] . The SlpB/X deficient mutant, NCK2031, had an anti-inflammatory effect on BMDM, with decreased MHCII, IL-6, and MIP-1\u03b1 compared to wild type NCFM. This is discrepant from previous reports of NCK2031 and is most likely due to the cell type evaluated and culture conditions employed [11, 24, 45] . The immunomodulatory properties of S-layer proteins from different lactobacilli species and strains must be further investigated.",

We found differential susceptibility of NCK1785 and NCFM to lysozyme degradation, but this did not correlate with NOD2 activation or macrophage cytokine production. Phagocytosis and NOD2 signaling did correlate with maximal MHCII and CD11b co-expression for NCK1785 and NCFM. NOD2 activation was essential for cytokine responses and acted synergistically with TLR2 rather than as a negative regulator thereof [15, 51, 52] .",

Consistent with other reports, we observed that robust antigen-specific humoral responses against our NCFM-based mucosal vaccines required NOD2 signaling in C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice [51, [53] [54] [55] . No specific vaccine correlates were identified here, but the significant increase of gut IL-1\u03b2 in NCK2166 immunized C57BL/6 mice was also dependent on NOD2. NOD2 and caspase-1 inflammasome activation were also required for lactobacilli induced IL-1\u03b2 in BMDM. Caspase-1 inflammasome activation can result in adjuvant-associated, highly inflammatory pyroptosis; however, lactobacilli BMDM activation occurred in a pyroptosis-independent manner [56, 57] . While NOD2 is involved in both NALP1 and NALP3 inflammasome activation, future studies are required to define the constituents of the inflammasome in this setting and the implications of limited pyropotosis for vaccine adjuvancy [18, 58, 59] .",

Recent studies have demonstrated synergy between NOD2 and TLR2 in the development of antigen-specific humoral responses [51, 54] . While TLR2 has been shown to promote IgA class switching and plasma cell differentiation, Kim et al demonstrated the requirement of NOD2 for optimal humoral responses in a mucosal cholera toxin (CT) model [60, 61] . In their studies, the adjuvant effect of CT was promoted by microbiota-driven NOD2 signaling in CD11c + phagocytes and implicated NOD2 in follicular helper T cells and plasma cell development [61] . Other studies have shown NOD2 expression by hematopoietic cells, in general, and B lymphocytes in particular, is required for optimal antibody responses [62] [63] [64] [65] . NOD2 signaling by the microbiota appears necessary for the continuous diversification of memory B cells [65, 66] . NOD2 activation in the stromal compartment of the intestinal tract may also shape the antibody response [55] . Additional studies will be required to determine the specific cell types responsible for the NOD2-dependent humoral responses identified here.",
