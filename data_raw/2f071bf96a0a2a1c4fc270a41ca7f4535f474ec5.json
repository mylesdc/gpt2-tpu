            "text": "Co-infecting parasite species can interact with one another, potentially altering both within-host infection dynamics [1] [2] [3] and between-host transmission (e.g. by increasing or decreasing parasite reproductive output or by altering host susceptibility) [2, [4] [5] [6] [7] . In turn, changes in infection dynamics within hosts can alter host disease severity and/or duration [8] [9] [10] and may directly or indirectly confound attempts to control parasite infection [3, 11, 12] . In most cases, whether or not particular parasite species interact, and the nature of such interactions are unknown. Despite the important consequences of co-infection, the potential interactions among parasites are, therefore, rarely considered in either clinical settings or during the design of infection control programmes. One possible solution to this problem would be to discover and define rules that determine when and how parasites interact. Such a concept has been explored at a broad scale for macroparasite-microparasite interactions using a meta-analysis of different infection combinations in mice [13] . This meta-analysis demonstrated that macroparasite-microparasite co-infection would normally result in increased numbers of microparasites owing to helminth-induced impairment of the anti-microparasite immune response, but that such effects would be moderated where resource competition was also present. This was a seminal contribution to the field of co-infection biology, highlighting the potential to predict co-infection using easily obtained parasite traits. However, because of the necessarily broad categorizations in this analysis, and the focus on a single model host system, application of these findings in a clinical or public health setting is difficult. Two key questions therefore follow logically from this meta-analysis: (i) can predictions also be made at a species-specific scale appropriate for use in clinical and public health settings? and (ii) can patterns of parasite interspecific interaction be robustly predicted across different host species?",

This approach was limited, however, by the necessity for detailed immunological data for each of the co-infecting parasites. Here, we develop and extend this approach by using taxonomic and parasite niche traits (i.e. resource use, site of infection) to assign parasite species to groups, making the assumption that organisms assigned to these groups will interact with the host immune system in a similar manner to one another. Subsequently, we infer what the immune interaction of each parasite group will be with its host, and hence the likely immune relationship between the groups, based on a known example of a co-infection interaction between representative species from those groups.",

            "text": "In a previous study of the parasite community of wild rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus), we described a range of interspecific interactions, including the interaction between two gut nematodes; the blood-feeding stomach worm Graphidium strigosum and the intestinal worm Trichostrongylus retortaeformis, a mucosal browser [3] . We showed that an increasing abundance of G. strigosum was associated with increased infection intensity of T. retortaeformis but, conversely, that the presence of T. retortaeformis was associated with a reduced intensity of G. strigosum. We further proposed that these effects occurred because (i) G. strigosum downregulated anti-worm immune response in the host, and T. retortaeformis was given an advantage by this suppression, while (ii) T. retortaeformis induced an immune response which, though reduced in co-infection, acted against G. strigosum [3] . In sheep, there are parasite species that are taxonomically and functionally equivalent to the parasite groups found in the rabbit; specifically, the nematode Haemonchus contortus, which lives in the abomasum (stomach) of the sheep and feeds on host blood, and Trichostrongylus colubriformis, which lives downstream in the small intestine and feeds on the host mucosa. We predict that these two parasites of sheep will interact with the same pattern, and by the same process, as the functionally equivalent parasite species in the rabbit. This is, to our knowledge, the first empirical attempt to predict the consequences of a hitherto untested interspecific interaction and to do so using data from different host and parasite species.",

            "text": "Not all parasitic nematodes are equal in the immune responses that they stimulate, or that affect them [15, 16] . While the immune control of the majority of gut nematodes is associated with a T-helper cell 2 (Th2) immune response [17, 18] , many nematodes are able to subvert this response to varying degrees. Such immunomodulation may be particularly important for blood-feeding species. These nematodes are usually very harmful to their host, causing both tissue damage and anaemia, with heavy infections sometimes proving fatal [19] . In addition, blood-feeding nematodes are frequently found at a high prevalence in their host populations [20, 21] . Therefore, it would be reasonable to expect hosts to evolve strong immune responses against bloodfeeding nematodes. Yet age-prevalence and age-intensity curves for these parasites show that they cause chronic infections and/or repeatedly reinfect the host [20] , suggesting that immune responses are functionally unsuccessful against them. Furthermore, many blood-feeding nematode species have been shown to have wide-ranging immunomodulatory capacities (e.g. Ancylostoma duodenale, Ancylostoma caninum, Necator americanus, Angiostrongylus cantonensis, H. contortus [22 -26] ). While these species do induce a strong Th2 response [23, 27] , many simultaneously subvert that response through a range of mechanisms [28] . These immunomodulatory effects may have consequences for other co-infecting parasite species. In contrast to blood-feeding nematode species, Trichostrongylus spp. browses on intestinal mucosa and bacteria, and shows limited invasion and penetration into host tissues [29] . These nematodes tend to produce shorter-lived infections than those of blood-feeding species, being more rapidly and effectively controlled by the host [30, 31] . While there is evidence that Trichostrongylus spp. may have some immunomodulatory capacity, it does not appear to be as immunologically broad ranging as that observed among the blood-feeding species [16, 32] . Further evidence of the different immune responses to these parasite groups is seen in rabbits, where the temporal pattern of natural and laboratory infections suggests that T. retortaeformis is effectively removed by the host, while G. strigosum is not [3, 33] . In summary, we therefore propose that how these two parasite groups interact with their hosts' immune responses will result in predictable interspecific interactions.",

For animals in the co-infection groups, doses of both parasite species were given simultaneously as an additive dose. Differential dosing was used because of the different size and pathogenicity of the two helminth species, T. colubriformis being considerably smaller and less pathogenic than H. contortus [35] .

Throughout the experiment animals were maintained on raised slatted floors to prevent self-reinfection, provided fresh water ad libitum, and fed daily with a ration of 700 g of standard pellets consisting of lucerne (500 g kg 21 ), wheat (100 g kg 21 ), pollard (200 g kg 21 ), bran (160 g kg 21 ), salt (20 g kg 21 ) and ammonium chloride (20 g kg 21 ), the quantity of which was set for normal growth.",

First, two principal components (PCs) analyses were conducted separately on the abomasal and jejunal measures of immune responses, using a singular value decomposition of the centred and scaled data matrix [39] . All scores were treated as numeric data and scaling was applied. The measures of the abomasal immune responses were compared between the H. contortus mono-and co-infection groups; and measures of the jejunal immune responses were compared between T. colubriformis mono-and co-infection groups; in both cases, this separation reflects the location of these species within the animals. The PC explaining the majority of the variation in each analysis was then used as the dependent variable in a GLM where treatment group, time of sampling and their interaction were the explanatory variables. Models were refined in a stepwise manner by evaluating the F statistics (terms were rejected when p . 0.05). Where the GLM analyses showed significant differences in PC values between treatment groups, the second step in the analysis was undertaken. In these second analyses, the bootstrapped mean value was calculated for each individual measure of immune response, to qualitatively explore The effect of treatment group on anti-H. contortus and anti-T. colubriformis IgG1 titres were assessed in two general linear mixed models (GLMMs using the R package ASReml-R v3.0) in which each animal's individual identification number was included as a random term to control for pseudo-replication. The titres of IgG1 were transformed to normalize residuals in the model, as ((x \u00fe 1) 0.12 ) for anti-T. colubriformis and ((x \u00fe 1) 0.18 ) for anti-H. contortus responses. Results shown here are backtransformed. In these models, treatment group, time of sampling (included as a categorical variable) and their interaction were included as fixed effects. This fixed-effect model was refined in a stepwise manner using the Wald test and evaluation of the conditional F statistics (terms were rejected when p . 0.05). Where treatment group was found to be a significant effect, differences between treatment groups were assessed by within-model contrasts. Haemonchus contortus was also affected by co-infection, but differently compared with T. colubriformis. To assess the H. contortus infection, we analysed both the number of arrested L4-stage larvae in the host tissues along with adult worms (see the electronic supplementary material, S3 for mean and s.d. of raw counts through time). There were fewer H. contortus arrested larvae in co-infections, compared with H. contortus-only infections (F 1,71 \u00bc 4.15, p \u00bc 0.045; figure 2 ); the number of these larvae was also affected by the time post-initial infection (F 3,71 \u00bc 9.79, p , 0.001; electronic supplementary material, S4). By contrast, the number of adult H. contortus was not affected by co-infection, though numbers did vary through time post-initial infection (F 3,72 \u00bc 14.73, p , 0.001; electronic supplementary material, S5). As the number of adults show no evidence of being bolstered by larvae leaving the arrested state in the co-infection group, together these data mean that in co-infections there are overall fewer H. contortus worms.",

The trajectory of adult worm numbers in the T. colubriformis mono-infected sheep shows a classic convex age-intensity curve, indicative of host immune responses removing adult worms [30, 40, 41] . In the co-infection treatment group the number of worms reached an asymptote, suggesting that adult worms were not being removed by the host immune response. There was, however, some evidence of a reduction in the larval establishment in this co-infection group (though less than in the mono-infected group), probably indicating that an anti-T. colubriformis response was beginning to develop. This is consistent with previous studies that have shown the anti-T. colubriformis immune response acts first against incoming larvae [42] . As we hypothesized, the difference in the number of T. colubriformis adults between co-infection and mono-infection groups appears to be immune-mediated. Our data demonstrate that there was a reduced immune response in the jejunum in the co-infected animals, compared to the T. colubriformis mono-infected animals, and most pronounced in the latter time points (weeks 14 and 18 post-initial infection; figures 3 and 4 and electronic supplementary material, S7). This differentiation between the infection groups suggests that the immune suppression we observe is dependent on the adult H. contortus (since by week 14 all larvae would have developed to adulthood or arrested their development). We use the presented immune measures as general indicators of anti-helminth immune responses, rather than implicating individual immune components. Nevertheless, all these immune components have been associated with the immune response against helminths in sheep [43] [44] [45] .",

            "text": "There was no evidence of an effect of co-infection on the number of H. contortus adults, nor on the abomasal cellular immune response. However, the significantly fewer arrested larvae in the co-infected animals demonstrate that coinfection still has a negative effect on H. contortus (figure 2). In natural infections, arrested larvae resume development to adulthood during periods of host stress [36] . There are significantly less arrested larvae in the co-infection group but no more adults. These missing larvae must, therefore: (i) be lost to the system entirely, or (ii) have replaced adults that have been lost. Thus, these larvae either (a) never established in the arrested state in the first place, (b) were destroyed in, or expelled from, the tissues, or (c) following a period in the arrested state, resumed their development and either replaced lost adults, or failed to establish as adults. The difference in the number of larvae found in the arrested state between singly and co-infected groups of sheep is relatively small, approximately 40 larvae, and is thus unlikely to be of clinical significance in these sheep. We highlight, however, that this study is not focused upon clinical significance per se, but upon the ability of our predictive framework to establish the form and direction of the parasite interactions, which we have achieved. Nevertheless, even these few larvae, as adults, could contribute substantially to the potential infectious burden on pasture under natural conditions. Assuming an average daily fecundity of 4700 eggs per female [46] and a sex ratio of 1 : 1, 20 adult female worms could be adding more than 94 000 eggs per day to pasture. As predicted, the loss of H. contortus arrested larvae appears to be immune-mediated. Although the abomasal immune components do not differ among infection groups, the concentration of anti-H. contortus IgG1 was significantly higher in co-infected animals (figure 3). Haemonchus contortus larvae were the source antigen for the IgG1 assay and it is likely that this antibody response reduces larval development, as has been previously been reported [47] . The host immune response to T. colubriformis and H. contortus in mono-infections is well documented [48] [49] [50] [51] . A feature of these responses is that they differ in strength depending on host species (sheep or goat), breed [17] , [52 -54] , age [30] , [55] and diet [56] , although the same immune components are implicated in helminth control among these host groups. An important consideration, then, is whether the interactions we have described between the co-infecting parasite groups would be robust to such host differences. As the immune components involved in the host response are the same, we suggest that while there may be quantitative differences in intensity of infection owing to variation in the strength of the immune response, the qualitative result (i.e. positive consequences for a mucosal-browsing nematode and negative for the blood-feeding group) will probably persist. This view is further supported by the identical pattern of interaction seen in the rabbit co-infection system between its blood-feeding and mucosal-browsing nematode parasites. It should be noted that one laboratory study of co-infection with the same rabbit helminths did not find this pattern of interaction during co-infection [33] . That laboratory study, however, used a single, high-dose infection (rather than the trickle infections we used), which can dramatically alter the form of the elicited immune response [57] , in turn altering the nature of the interspecific interactions.",

While we have successfully applied this approach here, we acknowledge that this is a single test and that further work is required to confirm that the approach could be applied beyond our defined parasite groupings. However, we note that our predictive ability crossed host species (rabbits and sheep) that are distinct taxonomically, behaviourally and physiologically, suggesting that host similarity does not underlie our successful prediction. Regarding the parasites, we also emphasize that our hypothesis of how the sheep parasites would interact came solely from our predictive framework. Specifically, despite extensive prior study of these parasites in sheep, the interactions we correctly predicted had never previously been hypothesized. Together this suggests that our predictive framework is neither host nor parasite species-specific. Future exploration of this topic could include a meta-analysis to determine whether parasite traits can represent patterns of immune function across multiple host types and different forms of parasite (i.e. beyond helminths).",

There is less information available to support the grouping of mucosal-browsing nematodes, as the host immunological response to this group has been less well studied. Even if we narrow this group to mucosal-browsing Trichostrongylus spp., the only immune function studies conducted appear to be on T. colubriformis and T. retortaeformis, the species involved in our studies. It will therefore be interesting to determine whether other members of the group also stimulate, and are controlled by, a classic Th2 response, which underlies the mechanism of their interaction with the blood feeders and, further, whether the group could be expanded to other helminth species displaying similarly low levels of tissue invasion, i.e. browsing nematodes beyond Trichostrongylus spp.",

Production losses owing to T. colubriformis are likely to be greater in sheep co-infected with H. contortus, because of the higher worm burdens and prolonged infection in such co-infections. Notably, the condition and mass of co-infected animals did not significantly differ from the other treatment groups. However, pasture-reared sheep, not provisioned with the high-quality maintenance diet provided in our experiment, would probably experience more severe effects during co-infection. Transmission of T. colubriformis in co-infected sheep could be substantially higher owing to the higher worm burdens and prolonged infection during H. contortus co-infection, meaning potentially higher worm burdens at a population level, requiring the use of anthelmintics. However, density-dependent reduction in per capita worm fecundity has been observed for T. colubriformis [59] , which may ameliorate such effects. Nevertheless, host immune response appears to play a role in this densitydependent restriction of fecundity [17] , and thus such immune effects may be reduced during H. contortus co-infection. A change in H. contortus-induced production losses during coinfection are unlikely, as adult worm burdens of this species were not affected by the co-infection. The economic implications of this co-infection are, therefore, principally a consequence of the altered dynamics of the T. colubriformis infection.",

A problem with this idea is that immune profiling is complex and expensive, and reagents may not be available for a novel or lesser-studied hosts. However, the current study offers an alternative mechanism for classification by using taxonomy and more easily identified parasitological traits, to act as a proxy for the immune traits.

Analysis of the individual cell types in the jejunum also showed that the greatest responses were in the T. colubriformis-only infection group and lower in the co-infected animals, presumably owing to the immunosuppressive effect of H. contortus (figure 4; electronic supplementary material, S7).
