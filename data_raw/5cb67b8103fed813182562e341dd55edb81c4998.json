Neuronal abnormalities might directly induce encephalopathic symptoms, such as epilepsy, seizures, convulsions or lethargy, and long-term neurological sequelae, including cognitive impairment and seizures, have been observed in patients.

This phosphoprotein is found mainly in the nucleus, where it regulates cell proliferation and growth, embryogenesis, cytokinesis, and nucleogenesis [16] . More recently, C23 was proposed to mediate the extracellular regulation of nuclear events [14] and shown to play roles in inflammatory responses induced by lipopolysaccharides (LPS) [17] . Furthermore, reports have also suggested that surface C23 may serve as an attachment target for some viruses, such as HIV [18, 19] . Based on its relative molecular mobility during sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), C23 is often described as a 100-110-kDa protein, although its putative molecular weight is approximately 78 kDa [20] . Tayyari et al. reported that C23 acts as a cellular receptor to recognize the RSV F protein, and interfering with the C23-RSV F protein interaction inhibits RSV infection in cell cultures and in animal models [21] . These finding are consistent with the characteristics of other enveloped virus cellular receptors, such as those of herpes simplex virus [22] and hepatitis B virus [23] .",

The F protein was found to co-localize with both the TLR4 and C23 receptors at 1 h pi (Figs. 5 and 6 ). The baseline level of C23 expression was slightly higher than that of TLR4, but both TLR4 and C23 protein expression were up-regulated from 1 h pi to 4 h pi, which is during the early stage of infection (Fig. 7) . Interestingly, both TLR4 and C23 protein levels were down-regulated beginning 4 h pi (late stage of infection), suggesting that these two receptors may participate in the early recognition and modulation of viral entry into N2a cells. We also speculated that TLR4 and C23 have no additional functions after RSV is internalized, as the expression levels of these two membrane receptors were decreased after 4 h of infection. These data are consistent with those of the laser confocal microscopy and co-immunoprecipitation experiments. TLR4 expression in neurons of traumatic encephalopathy patients has also been reported to increase at early infection and decrease at late infection, and TLR4 is thought to play a vital role in inflammatory responses involving MyD88/NF-\u03baB activation and initiate the TLR4/MyD88/NF-\u03baB signaling pathway [26, 37] , suggesting that TLR4 is very important for the ability of RSV to infect neuronal cells. Fig. 6 The potential interactive effects of TLR4 and nucleolin with the RSV F protein were assessed using a co-immunoprecipitation assay. The TLR4 and nucleolin proteins were pulled down with F protein, and their coalition in N2a cells was augmented after RSV infection but not throughout the entire infection period. Crude extract (input) and immunoenriched (IP) fractions were subjected to Western blot analysis. Tagged proteins were detected using an anti-RSV F protein antibody. Anti-mouse IgG served as the negative control The relative fold changes and statistical analyses of TLR4 (a) and nucleolin (b) expression levels were evaluated using GraphPad Prism 5 software (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA). Data are expressed as the mean \u00b1 SEM, and three independent experiments were run. * P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant, and ** P < 0.01 was considered highly statistically significant compared with the uninfected control Third, because apoptosis may involve virus-cell interactions and induce cellular damage during the viral infection process, the apoptosis rates of N2a cells after RSV infection were measured in this study. Early apoptosis occurred at 2 d pi, and late apoptosis occurred as the duration of RSV infection extended. These findings demonstrated the presence of apoptotic lesions during the RSV infection process.",

TLR3 activation is associated with neuroinflammation and common CNS disease pathologies [41] , and TLR7 is up-regulated upon chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infection and plays an important role in CHIKV pathogenesis in neuronal cells [42] . Moreover, TLR activation in dendritic and neuronal cells has been reported to drive a protective antiviral response [43, 44] . Thus, in this study, variations in TLR3 and TLR7 expression in RSVinfected N2a cells were determined. Both TLR3 and TLR7 protein levels continuously increased as the duration of RSV infection was extended, confirming the role of TLR-mediated innate immune responses in RSV pathogenesis.",

During these processes, the RSV F protein colocalized with TLR4 and C23 and thus may play an essential role in the RSV infection of N2a cells.
