The application of this combination of methodologies permitted us to generate human single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) against two proteins: green fluorescent protein (GFP) and thioredoxin (Trx) in a short time, using as low as 5 \u03bcg of purified protein. These scFvs showed specific reactivity against their respective targets and worked well by ELISA and western blot. The scFvs were able to recognise as low as 31 ng of protein of their respective targets by western blot. Conclusion: This work describes a novel and miniaturized methodology to obtain human monoclonal recombinant antibodies against any target in a shorter time than other methodologies using only 5 \u03bcg of protein.",

The affinity of scFvs for their targets might be comparable to that of mAbs or pAbs and in some cases even higher [15] . As a general rule, scFvs possess several advantages in comparison to IgG or Fabs such as higher tissue penetrance and more rapid clarification [16, 17] . Moreover, antibody phage display, M13-based human libraries, is becoming particularly useful for the production and development of antibodies for immunotherapy in different diseases [18] [19] [20] [21] . In vitro phage display pipelines have been setup to generate antibodies to the complete human proteome, but the selections are still carried out manually [8, 9, 22] . Screening of phage display antibody libraries is constrained by the necessity of having considerable amounts of antigen, at least 0.1-0.5 mg of protein for the whole procedure (selection, screening and validation).",

Rapid Translation System (RTS) [32] , a bacterial-based commercially available cell-free protein expression system, has been used for the high-throughput expression of inner and outer membrane proteins from Anaplasma marginale [33] . In 2000, the Riken Structural Genomics Initiative (Japan) reported the bacterial based cell-free protein expression production of about 25% of randomly chosen mouse cDNA clones with yields higher than 0.1 mg/ml [34] . Since then, several developments have significantly improved the yield of in vitro expressed proteins in the range of milligrams of protein per mL of reaction mix [27, 28, 35, 36] . Another interesting initiative is the \"human protein factory\", for the expression of human proteins using the wheat-germ in vitro protein expression system and Gateway technology [24] . The authors reported a 97% success rate of protein expression over 13364 human proteins. Among them, they detected soluble proteins in 12682 out of 13364 clones [24] . There have been other successful high-throughput initiatives based on in vitro protein expression, with yields up to 6 mg/mL, which have been applied for protein arrays, nuclear magnetic resonance and crystallization studies [37] [38] [39] .",

Antibody arrays were initially designed to capture and detect simultaneously multiple analytes with high affinity and selectivity in human biological samples (plasma, serum, tissue ...) in order to study variations between biological statuses [5] . We have explored the use of this proteomic technique for testing scFv antibody libraries against different antigens at the same time in order to identify specific scFvs, increasing the throughput of the screening step with minimal requirements of protein. In this report, we propose a novel methodology to develop scFv antibodies using human phage display antibody libraries in a short time (no more than four weeks) with only 5 \u03bcg of protein. Furthermore, this method could be automated in a high-throughput format to obtain \"antibodies on demand\" against any target, taking advantage of cell-free protein expression, antibody phage display and scFv antibody microarrays.",

Although some scFv expression differences were observed among the different clones, a correct printing pattern was detected, indicating adequate printing conditions ( Figure 2B ). The amount of scFv printed in the array was determined by printing serial 1:10 dilutions of previously reported antigastrin TA4 scFv at 0.5 \u03bcg/ml to construct a regression line [40] . Then, we used the median of the fluorescence signal of the scFvs in the regression line to get the amount of scFvs printed in the array. Approximately 12 pg of antibodies were printed in each spot of the array. The quality of the scFv antibody microarray was confirmed by the absence of cross contamination between successive spots. All positive controls as well as buffer spots showed the correct reactivity. The intra-assay reproducibility was assessed by comparing the results between the two replicas printed within the same chip for each clone and gave an R 2 = 0.9311 ( Figure 2C ).",

GST-His6 and scFv-Trx (3xFlag, His6) proteins were produced in E. coli according to established procedures [54] . Briefly, pET41b (Novagen) containing GST-cDNA and pSANG10-3F containing the cDNA encoding the scFv-Trx were used to transform BL21 (DE3) E. coli cells. His6-tagged proteins were then expressed and purified by affinity chromatography on a HiTrap chelating column (GE Healthcare). Selection of protein-specific scFvs from phagemid libraries Human scFv Mehta libraries (a kind gift of Wayne Marasco, Dana-Farber Cancer Center. USA) were used for scFv production [55, 56] . Mehta scFvs contain a c-myc tag for detection and purification. Phage display selections were performed using the proteins attached to TALON Dynabeads. Briefly, cell-free expressed proteins were attached to TALON\u2122 Dynabeads through the His6 tag by incubating 40 \u03bcL of the RTS reaction with 50 \u03bcL of magnetic beads. Five equal aliquots were prepared, four for the rounds of selection and one for direct labelling of the proteins. After exhaustive washing with PBS, magnetic beads were blocked with 3% BSA in PBS (PBS-BSA) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, 100 \u03bcl of Mehta I and II libraries, diluted 1:10 in PBS-BSA, pre-incubated with magnetic beads to remove non-specific binders, were added to the solution and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. We performed four rounds of biopanning to get specific scFvs against GFP and Trx. Each round of selection included a negative subtraction of the phages against empty TALON\u2122 Dynabeads \u00ae . Beads were washed 5 times with PBS-0.1% Tween during 2 min at room temperature and 40 rpm in a lab roller. Prior to elution a final washing step with PBS was performed to remove detergent from the media. Then, phages were eluted with 100 \u03bcL of 0.1M glycine, pH 2.7 during 10 min at room temperature in a lab roller at 40 rpm. Finally, phages were neutralized with 20 \u03bcL of 1M Tris, pH 9.",
