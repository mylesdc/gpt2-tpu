            "text": "Background: Carbohydrates are a class of large and diverse biomolecules, ranging from a simple monosaccharide to large multi-branching glycan structures. The covalent linkage of a carbohydrate to the nitrogen atom of an asparagine, a process referred to as N-linked glycosylation, plays an important role in the physiology of many living organisms. Most software for glycan modeling on a personal desktop computer requires knowledge of molecular dynamics to interface with specialized programs such as CHARMM or AMBER. There are a number of popular web-based tools that are available for modeling glycans (e.g., GLYCAM-WEB (http://https://dev.glycam.org/gp/) or Glycosciences.db (http://www. glycosciences.de/)). However, these web-based tools are generally limited to a few canonical glycan conformations and do not allow the user to incorporate glycan modeling into their protein structure modeling workflow.",

            "text": "Results: Here, we present Glycosylator, a Python framework for the identification, modeling and modification of glycans in protein structure that can be used directly in a Python script through its application programming interface (API) or through its graphical user interface (GUI). The GUI provides a straightforward two-dimensional (2D) rendering of a glycoprotein that allows for a quick visual inspection of the glycosylation state of all the sequons on a protein structure. Modeled glycans can be further refined by a genetic algorithm for removing clashes and sampling alternative conformations. Glycosylator can also identify specific three-dimensional (3D) glycans on a protein structure using a library of predefined templates. Conclusions: Glycosylator was used to generate models of glycosylated protein without steric clashes. Since the molecular topology is based on the CHARMM force field, new complex sugar moieties can be generated without modifying the internals of the code. Glycosylator provides more functionality for analyzing and modeling glycans than any other available software or webserver at present. Glycosylator will be a valuable tool for the glycoinformatics and biomolecular modeling communities.",

            "text": "Glycosylation is an important post-translational modification of proteins, where a carbohydrate is covalently attached by an enzyme to specific amino acids motifs known as sequons space [1] [2] [3] [4] . Glycosylation has several principal structural and functional roles in biology, that include protein folding [5] , tissue repair [6] , and cell migration [7] . In eukaryotes, nearly 70% of the proteome is believed to be glycosylated [8] . More recently, glycosylation has been observed in bacteria where it has been associated with their virulence and the formation of biofilms [9] . For viruses, such as HIV and Influenza, glycosylation allows for evasion of the host's immune system [10, 11] . Thus, determining the role of glycan structure in biology is essential in order to understand pathogenesis. The diverse and dynamic nature of glycan structures makes it difficult to resolve their structure experimentally through traditional approaches (e.g., x-ray crystallography, cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) or nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)). Computational methods, such as molecular dynamics (MD) can help resolve glycan dynamics but this method is computationally intensive and cannot be used for the rapid modeling of glycan structure. Complementary techniques that are more rapid and available through a graphical user interface (GUI) should allow users to gain new insights into glycanprotein structure.",

CarbBuilder, POLYS and doGlycans are open source programs that allow building glycan structures from their primary sequence of monosaccharide units. SWEET-II is part of the website Glycosciences.DB [20] and can be used to build 3D structures of glycans. Furthermore, the website provides a number of tools for manipulating and analyzing glycans. GLYCAM-Web offers several options that simplify the building and set-up of molecular dynamics simulations of glycoproteins. It uses the GLYCAM force field [21] that is compatible with the AMBER force field. Finally, Glycan Reader recognizes most types of glycans and their chemical modifications found in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), which are all available in the CHARMM force field [22] . It also provides the option for editing their threedimensional structure. Glycan Modeler generates complex glycans and glycoconjugates by searching templates from a fragment database. Glycan Reader and Modeler have both been integrated into CHARMM-GUI [23] , a powerful website widely employed for setting up molecular dynamics simulation. In addition, CHARMM-GUI provides the functionality for modelling glycolipids and lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and to combine them with complex biological membrane simulations [24] . While many of these tools are available as webservers making them ideal for their ease of use and distribution, this limits their ability to be customized for the specific needs of some users; for example, for tasks that require batch modeling of several glycoforms for a given protein or adding non-canonical saccharides to a protein structure.",

At the core of Glycosylator is the Molecule class. A Molecule is defined as a single covalently linked set of atoms and is implemented around the ProDy [25] and NetworkX [26] packages. ProDy is widely used for studying biomolecules and offers several functions for storing and manipulating structures. The functions and classes provided are used in the Molecule class for saving and quickly accessing the structural data of a molecule. The topological properties of a molecule are represented here as a graph using the Net-workX package. A Molecule can be instantiated directly with a 3D structure (PDB) or using a MoleculeBuilder instance and the topology information provided for the CHARMM force field [22] . When loading a glycoprotein, Glycosylator will identify all Oand N-linked sequons and their glycans. The structure and topology of each of the glycans can then be modified. Clashes and alternative conformations for glycans can be optimized with the Sampler class. Finally, the graphical representation of glycans provided by the Drawer class makes use of Matplotlib [27] , a Python package used for plotting. Taken together, Glycosylator provides more functionality for analyzing and modeling glycans than many popular software packages and webservers ( Table 1 ). The main functions used for glycosylating a protein can be conveniently accessed through Glycosylator's GUI (Additional file 1: Figure S2 ).",

These torsional angles can be measured, set to a specific value or rotated by a given amount. An interresidue graph is also built in order to quickly parse through a molecule composed of several residues.",

These trees describe the connectivity and saccharide units that compose a polysaccharide. A library of these structures can be imported into a Glycosylator instance or saved as a simple text file or a SQL database. Glycosylator can then compare the extracted connectivity tree to the internal dataset of known glycans to identify them based on the glycosidic linkage and residue type. We do note that chemical post-modifications of glycans are not supported in the current version. Glycans can be extended, trimmed or modeled ab initio. This can be achieved by providing the identification of a known oligosaccharide (in the library) or with a topology tree describing the connectivity and glycan units of the desired oligosaccharide. The topology tree is a string representation of a glycan.",

The glycans on the surface of these proteins create a shield that helps them to evade the host's immune system [28] . For the benchmark, a mannose 9 was modeled at each sequon, mimicking the glycosylation state before exiting the endoplasmic reticulum [29] . The topology of the glycosylated structure was generated with the autopsf plug-in of VMD [30] . Each glycoprotein was then minimized with 5000 steps of conjugate gradient optimization in NAMD [31] . The resulting energy-minimized model was then submitted for a sanity check to pdb-care (http:// www.glycosciences.de/tools/pdb-care/), a powerful tool that checks the connectivity and nomenclature in glycoproteins [32] . We observed that all glycoproteins modeled with Glycosylator had a lower potential energy and were devoid of any steric clashes and topological errors ( Table 2) . For structures with a low density of sequons, such as Influenza's hemagglutinin, Glycosylator and doGlycans performed similarly. However, a simple minimization was insufficient for removing steric clashes from the HIV-1 Envelope trimer and Delta coronavirus spike protein structures using doGlycans. The density of sequons at the surface of these glycoproteins is high, requiring a more effective strategy for removing clashes, such as provided by Glycosylator's Sampler Class. The steric clashes present in the structures produced with doGlycans lead topological errors, such as ring puckering after minimizations. In order to solve this issue, the torsional angles would have to be manually adjusted by the user.",

First, all crystallographically-determined glycans were identified and hydrogenated (Fig. 1 , upper left triangle). The ribbon representation allowed for a quick visual inspection of the identified N-linked sequons and linked glycans. A combination of mannose 5, mannose 9 and complex glycans was then modeled ab initio or by extending existing glycans to produce a more biologically relevant glycoform of the HIV-1 Env trimer (Fig. 1, lower right  triangle) . The Sampler function in Glycosylator was then used to remove all major clashes, such that the Table 2 Benchmark comparing Glycosylator and doGlycans. The average minimum distance between sequons was computed between the closest pairs of asparagine C\u03b1 atoms. The number of issues accounts for errors in glycan connectivity and nomenclature due to steric clashes.
