No effective antiviral drugs against it are commercially available. We recently reported that the culture supernatant of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, the porcine pleuropneumonia causative agent, has an antiviral activity in vitro against PRRSV in SJPL cells.

Subsequent, flow cytometry analysis and cell cycle inhibitors were used to confirm antibody microarray data and to link them to the antiviral activity of the A. pleuropneumoniae supernatant. Finally, A. pleuropneumoniae supernatant characterization was partially achieved using mass spectrometry. Results: Using antibody microarray, we observed modulations in G2/M-phase cell cycle regulation pathway when SJPL cells were treated with A. pleuropneumoniae culture supernatant. These modulations were confirmed by a cell cycle arrest at the G2/M-phase when cells were treated with the A. pleuropneumoniae culture supernatant. Furthermore, two G2/M-phase cell cycle inhibitors demonstrated the ability to inhibit PRRSV infection, indicating a potential key role for PRRSV infection. Finally, mass spectrometry lead to identify two molecules (m/z 515.2 and m/z 663.6) present only in the culture supernatant. Conclusions: We demonstrated for the first time that A. pleuropneumoniae is able to disrupt SJPL cell cycle resulting in inhibitory activity against PRRSV. Furthermore, two putative molecules were identified from the culture supernatant. This study highlighted the cell cycle importance for PRRSV and will allow the development of new prophylactic or therapeutic approaches against PRRSV.",

Therefore, protein profiling of SJPL cells infected or not with PRRSV (MOI 0.5) and/or treated or not with the App\u0394apxIC\u0394apxIIC culture supernatant was performed using Kinex KAM-850 antibody microarray. Eight hundred and fifty four cell signaling proteins were targeted, using 337 phosphosite-specific antibodies and 517 pan-specific antibodies. Pan-specific antibodies targeted both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated proteins forms. Proteins were classified into nine groups according to their cellular functions: (1) transcription and translation factors; (2) proteins implicated in signal transduction pathway; (3) proteins implicated in host-pathogen interaction or in immune response; (4) proteins implicated in stress response; (5) proteins implicated in cell spreading, cell migration, cell survival, cell growth, cell cycle and cell proliferation; (6) apoptosis signaling pathway; (7) cytoskeleton-associated proteins; (8) proteins implicated in cell biosynthesis and metabolism; (9) proteins implicated in other biological process or unclassifiable proteins. Data are expressed in percent of change from control (mock-infected and untreated SJPL cells; % CFC) and are presented in Fig. 1 and Additional file 1: Table S1 . The App\u0394apxIC\u0394apxIIC culture supernatant upregulates inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B kinase subunit beta (IKK\u03b2), receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 2 (Rip2) and caspase-9 (CASP9). In cells treated with App\u0394apxIC\u0394apxIIC culture supernatant, cell cycle regulation proteins (M-phase inducer phosphatase 3 inactive form (CDC25c (ser216)) and cyclin-dependent kinase 1/2 active forms (CDK1/2 (tyr161))) and caspase-3 (CASP3) were modulated by the culture supernatant regardless of whether they were infected with PRRSV or not. Also, PRRSV seems to upregulate mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/mitogen activated protein kinase ERK pathway and NF-\u03baB pathway. Indeed, serine/threonine-protein kinase A-Raf (Raf-A), ERK1/2, interleukin-1 receptorassociated kinase 4 (IRAK4) and cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein 1 (CREB1) were differentially modulated in presence or absence of culture supernatant. Thus, PRRSV upregulates MAPK/ERK and NF-\u03baB pathways. The culture supernatant seems to decrease the PRRSV induced upregulation for MAPK/ERK and NF-\u03baB pathways. Overall, the antibodies microarray data suggests that A. pleuropneumoniae culture supernatant modulates SJPL cell cycle.",

SJPL cells incubated in DMEM were used as normal cell cycle and we obtained a mean 50.6 % of SJPL cells in Gap-1 phase (G1-phase); 35.1 % of SJPL cells in DNA-synthesis phase (S-phase); and 14.3 % of SJPL cells in Gap-2 and mitotic phase (G2/M-phase) ( Fig. 2a and b) . We then used as controls, two molecules known to modulate the cell cycle at different phases. Nocodazole interferes with the polymerization of microtubules, blocking treated cells in G2/M-phase and inducing cell death by apoptosis [19] . Aphidicolin is a DNA-polymerase inhibitor and induces cell cycle arrest in S-phase [20] . When SJPL cells were treated with nocodazole or aphidicolin, we observed Fig. 1 App\u0394apxIC\u0394apxIIC culture supernatant upregulated cellular proteins when SJPL cells were infected or not with PRRSV. Proteins represented were selected using a Z-score difference (Z-score SJPL -Z-score SJPL treated/infected cells) threshold of plus 75 % (corresponding in log2 to 1.68 fold change versus the control). CDC25c: ser216 phosphorylated form; CDK1/2: tyr161 phosphorylated form; Tau: ser516 and ser519 phosphorylated forms; Rb: ser807 and ser811 phosphorylated forms differences between treated and untreated cells (Fig. 2a) . With nocodazole treatment, SJPL cell number in G2/Mphase increased (in mean) to 41.5% and an additional apoptotic peak before the G1-phase peak was seen as expected (Fig. 2a) . With aphidicolin treatment, the proportion of SJPL cells in S-phase increased (in mean) to 51.9 % (Fig. 2a) . Following validation with cell cycle controls, 33.9 %, respectively ( Fig. 2a and b) , indicating that A. pleuropneumoniae culture supernatant had an effect on SJPL cell cycle.",

Two specific cell cycle inhibitors were used to verify whether cell cycle modulation induced by the culture supernatant is due to CDC25c and/or CDK1/2. We first used DIM which is a specific activator of cell cycle inhibitor serine/threonine-protein kinase (Chk2), Chk2 is an inhibitor of CDC25 and leads to a cell cycle arrest in G2/M-phase [21] . Then, we used SBE-13 which is a selective inhibitor of cell cycle activator polo-kinase isoforms: PLK1, PLK2, PLK3 [22] . These proteins are implicated in the G2/M-phase transition pathway; PLK1 is a CDC25c activator and CDC25c promotes the G2/ M-phase transition using cyclin-B/CDK1 complex. Both DIM and SBE-13 treatments induced a SJPL cell cycle modulation (Fig. 4) . G1-phase of SJPL cells was not modulated by DIM or SBE-13 ( Fig. 4a and b) . The number of cells in S-phase was significantly (n \u2265 6; P \u2264 0.001) decreased (in mean) from 35.1 % to 17.7 % and to 3.6 % by DIM and SBE-13 treatments, respectively ( Fig. 4a and c) and proportions of cells in G2/M-phase were significantly (n \u2265 6; P \u2264 0.001) increased (in mean) from 14.3 % to 37.0 % and to 51.8 % by DIM and SBE-13 treatments, respectively as previously observed with A. pleuropneumoniae culture supernatant ( Fig. 4a and d) .",

This observation is interesting as it can partly Peptidoglycan fragments can stimulate the nucleotidebinding oligomerization domain (NOD) pathway [25, 26] . Following activation, NOD1 or NOD2 recruits RIP2 and nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells inhibitor alpha (I\u03baB\u03b1), leading to NF-\u03baB activation [27] . Protein profiling indicated that only RIP2, a specific NF-\u03baB activator, was upregulated by the culture supernatant in absence of PRRSV. The absence of NF-\u03baB activation by A. pleuropneumoniae culture supernatant alone is certainly puzzling, but L\u00e9vesque and collaborators demonstrated that NOD pathway induction using peptidoglycan fragments did not lead to an antiviral effect [7] .

The G2/M-phase checkpoint is activated after DNA damages and provides opportunity to stop and repair the damaged cells. To the best of our knowledge, the observed cell cycle arrest induced by A. pleuropneumoniae has never been reported before. However, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (formerly Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) was able to stop growth and induce cell cycle arrest in G2/M-phase of HeLa cells, by production of the cytolethal distending toxin (CDT) [33, 34] . With regards to PRRSV, Sun and collaborators demonstrated the ability of its non structural protein 11 to control the cell cycle and to induce a cell cycle arrest in S-phase [35] . We demonstrated that A. pleuropneumoniae culture supernatant is able to induce a G2/M-phase cell cycle arrest in SJPL cells, resulting in decreased cell proliferation. Using CDC25c, CDK1/2 and PLK inhibitors, we confirmed the protein profiling results. DIM and SBE-13 are known to induce a cell cycle arrest in G2/M-phase and both decreased proliferation of SJPL cells. The cell cycle arrest induced by A. pleuropneumoniae can be due to a CDC25c or CDK1/2 inhibition. We will further investigate this pathway using Western-blot analysis of regulation proteins.",

These conditions are known to block PRRSV replication [7] . Cells were washed twice with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS; Life Technologies) and 500 \u03bcL of lysis buffer was added (20 mM MOPS (pH 7.0; Sigma-Aldrich), 2 mM EGTA (Sigma-Aldrich), 5 mM EDTA (Fisher Scientific, Fair Lawn, NJ, USA), 30 mM sodium fluoride (Sigma-Aldrich), 60 mM \u03b2-glycerophosphate (pH 7.2; Sigma-Aldrich), 20 mM sodium pyrophosphate (Sigma-Aldrich), 1 mM sodium orthovanadate (Sigma-Aldrich), 1 % (v/v) Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich) and one protease inhibitor cocktail tablet Complete Mini EDTA-free (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany), pH 7.2). Cells were removed using a cell scraper (Nalge Nunc International, Rochester, NY, USA) and transferred into a microcentrifuge tube on ice. Sonication was performed at 180 Joules using an ultrasonic processor (Cole-Parmer, Vernin Hills, IL, USA) in order to lyse the cells. Samples were then ultracentrifuged at 90,000 g for 30 min in a Sorvall RC M100 ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter, Mississauga, ON, Canada). Protein concentration was determined on the supernatant using Pierce BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Rockford, IL, USA) and was adjusted to 2 mg/mL. Samples were then analyzed using Kinex KAM-850 antibody microarray (Kinexus Bioinformatics Corporation, Vancouver, BC, Canada). Kinex KAM-850 antibody microarray includes 854 antibodies which target different cell signaling pathways and included 517 pan-specific antibodies and 337 phosphosite-specific antibodies. These include 466 antibodies against protein kinase, 44 antibodies against protein phosphatase, 46 antibodies against stress response proteins, 75 antibodies against protein implicated in transcription and 223 others. Data were expressed in a chemiluminescence signal ratio versus the untreated cells. The percentage change from control (% CFC) was calculated for each protein by dividing the treated condition Z-ratio by the control Z-scores X 100 as described previously [44] .",

Briefly, 2 \u03bcL of sample was injected and the separation was achieved with a gradient mobile phase along with a microbore column Thermo Biobasic C8 (100 \u00d7 1 mm) (Thermo Scientific), with a particle size of 5 \u03bcm. The initial mobile phase condition consisted of acetonitrile and water (both fortified with 0.4 % (v/v) of formic acid) at a ratio of 5:95. From 0 to 1 min, the ratio was maintained at 5:95. From 1 to 21 min, a linear gradient was applied up to a ratio of 90:10 and maintained for 5 min. The mobile phase composition ratio was then reverted to the initial conditions and the column was allowed to re-equilibrate for 14 min for a total run time of 40 min. The flow rate was fixed at 75 \u03bcL/min. Mass spectrometer was coupled with the LC system using a pneumatically assisted electrospray ion source (ESI). Sheath nitrogen gas was set to 10 units and ESI electrode was set to 4000 V in positive mode. Capillary temperature was set at 300\u00b0C and capillary voltage to 34 V. Instrument was operating in full scan MS mode (m/z 200-1000) and MS/MS data was collected on the most abundant peaks in a data dependent acquisition (DDA) mode using a peak intensity threshold of 1 \u00d7 10 5 counts per second (cps). The \u2264 3 kDa ultrafiltrate of DMEM was used as a negative control and spectra were compared with the \u2264 3 kDa ultrafiltrate of the A. pleuropneumoniae culture supernatant or the TLC extracted molecules.
