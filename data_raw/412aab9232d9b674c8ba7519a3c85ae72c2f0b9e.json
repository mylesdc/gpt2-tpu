Investigation of the underlying mechanism of action revealed that quercetin exhibited a preventive effect against EV71 infection and inhibited viral adsorption. Moreover, quercetin mediated its powerful therapeutic effects primarily by blocking the early post-attachment stage of viral infection. Further experiments demonstrated that quercetin potently inhibited the activity of the EV71 protease, 3C pro , blocking viral replication, but not the activity of the protease, 2A pro , or the RNA polymerase, 3D pol . Modeling of the molecular binding of the 3C pro -quercetin complex revealed that quercetin was predicted to insert into the substrate-binding pocket of EV71 3C pro , blocking substrate recognition and thereby inhibiting EV71 3C pro activity.",

Clinical manifestations of EV71 infection range from mild HFMD to severe encephalitis, pulmonary edema, and even death [8, 9] . In recent years, EV71 was reported to cause several large-scale outbreaks of severe complications in children involving the central nervous system, resulting in fatalities [10, 11] . EV71 caused 126 deaths in 2008 in China [12, 13] and the largest outbreak in China occurred in 2010, with an estimated 1.7 million infections, of which 27,000 caused severe neurological complications, resulting in 905 fatalities [14] . Fatal cases were also reported in Asia as recently as 2012 [13] .",

Determination of cell viability 48 h after viral infection indicated that the inhibitory effect of quercetin on EV71 may result from the inhibition of viral replication in cells when the compound was also absorbed into cells, rather than only by inhibition of virus adsorption. Therefore, we performed an adsorption inhibition assay using intracellular virus titrations via the median tissue culture infective dose (TCID 50 ) method. RD cells were infected with EV71 (100 and 1000 TCID 50 ) and treated with 40 and 80 \u03bcM quercetin.

Cells infected with EV71 in the absence of quercetin were used as the virus control.

As shown in Fig. 2d , when quercetin was present for the whole course of the replication cycle (\u2212 2 to 12 h p.i.), the progeny virus titer was markedly reduced, and addition of quercetin during the 0-12 h and 2-12 h stages after viral infection (p.i) had a similar effect. Treatment during other periods following EV71 infection resulted in a gradual increase of viral yield, reflecting the reduction/loss of the antiviral effects of the compound.

RD cells were co-transfected with the reporter plasmid, pCMV-FLuc, harboring firefly luciferase, and [37] , contributing to the shut-down of cellular cap-dependent translation. If 2A pro activity was inhibited, firefly luciferase would be highly expressed, luminescence intensity increased, and vice versa. As shown in Fig. 4a , there was a significant reduction in the Renilla luciferase signal in cell lysates expressing 2A pro compared with those expressing inactive 2A pro . When cells were treated with different concentrations of quercetin, there was no restoration of the reporter signal in RD cells co-transfected with the reporter plasmid and the 2A expression plasmid, indicating that quercetin did not inhibit the activity of EV71 2A pro . EV71 3D pol is an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) which is key in the process of viral RNA replication. We investigated the effect of quercetin on EV71 3D pol activity in vitro by detecting the amount of radio-labeled UMP incorporated into poly (A) RNA in the presence of poly (A) templates and oligo (dT) primers. The rate of UMP incorporation by EV71 3D pol in the presence of 0.5% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; the vehicle used for dissolving quercetin) and EDTA were employed as negative and positive controls, respectively. The results presented in Fig. 4b demonstrate that UMP incorporation into RdRp reaction products was entirely inhibited in the presence of EDTA, whereas EV71 3D pol exhibited potent activity in the presence of 0.5% DMSO, and almost the same activity in the presence of 10 \u03bcM quercetin. Minimal inhibition was also observed by addition of 100 \u03bcM quercetin to the RdRp reaction. The results of this experiment indicate that quercetin did not interfere with EV71 3D pol activity. Quercetin targets EV71 3C pro EV71 3C pro is vital for the maturation of virion particles, and an ideal drug target. To further identify the potential antiviral target of quercetin, its effects on 3C pro activity were investigated. The peptide Dabcyl-KTSAVLQSGFRKME-Edans (incorporating the fluorescence quenching pair, Dabcyl-Edans) was chosen for use in an EV71 3C pro assay, and the increase in fluorescence (indicating real-time peptide bond cleavage) monitored. Rutin, a well-known 3C pro inhibitor, was used as a positive control. As illustrated in Fig. 5 , quercetin significantly inhibited 3C pro in a dose-dependent manner in vitro, and the EC50 of quercetin against 3C pro was 30.3 \u03bcM. The presence of 200 \u03bcM quercetin reduced 3C pro activity by 86%, comparable to the effects of rutin. These observations suggest that quercetin is a potent inhibitor of 3C pro .",

A flexible surface loop \u03b2-ribbon is important for recognition of the P2-P4 region of the peptide substrate. The stabilization of the open \u03b2-ribbon conformation requires intermolecular hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions, formed by Gly1-Gln168, Tyr122-Phe113, Gln121-Ser111, and a hydrophobic patch generated by interaction between Leu25 and Pro131, and Met109, Met112, Val114, and Phe140 [34] . To predict the interaction between EV71 3C pro and quercetin, we tested the possible interaction and calculated the binding energy by molecular docking. We initially identified putative sites through which quercetin might bind to 3C pro (Protein Data Bank [PDB] no. 3OSY) using this method. The binding free energy was calculated (Table 2 ) and the optimal value, indicating a site most likely to mediate interaction of quercetin with 3C pro , was chosen (Fig. 6) . The results illustrate that quercetin is predicted to bind stably in the substrate recognition region (P2-P4) mainly through hydrogen bonds formed by residue Gly164 and hydrophobic interactions formed by residues Try138, Phe140, Ala144, His161, Ile162, Gly163, Gln168, Gly169 and Phe170 in 3C pro (Fig. 6a) . The molecular structure of quercetin bound to 3C pro indicates that it partially occupies a catalytically important amino acid loop (aa) 140-147 (Fig. 6b) . Based on these results, we predicted that quercetin would be able to bind to P2-P4 and inhibit the interaction between the peptide substrate and the 3C pro active site, thereby contributing to 3C pro inactivation. These results indicate that quercetin may block substrate recognition to inhibit EV71 3C pro activity.",

            "text": "In this study, a two-step detection system, consisting of an enhanced GFP reporter infection assay and a cell viability-based assay, was developed to assess the antiviral activity of quercetin against EV71. A major limitation of these assays is their inability to discriminate between drug toxicity and viral-induced CPE. Moreover, reporter virus-based assays are only suitable for determining the antiviral activity of non-toxic compounds, since toxic compounds decrease the fluorescence or luminescence signal. Thus, the EV71 antiviral assay used in this study was conducted by combining these two approaches. Moreover, EC50 values of quercetin against EV71 were also obtained by other approaches, including CPE microscopy and classic virus yield reduction assay (data not shown), in addition to the two assays described above. GFP reporter infection assays, using a full-length infectious clone, allowed screening for inhibitors of any step(s) of the replication cycle of EV71. CPE detection, MTT and virus yield assays reflected changes in cellular phenotypes, metabolism, and viral multiplication, respectively. The similarity of the EC50s obtained using these different approaches suggested that quercetin alone did not inhibit cell growth and could effectively inhibit viral infection. Furthermore, we determined the CC50 values at a maximum quercetin concentration of 200 \u03bcM, because when the concentration was higher than 200 \u03bcM, a large amount of particles would adsorb on the cell surface, resulting in an inability to visualize the state of the cells, or to accurately determine cell viability using the MTT method. The value of CC50 for quercetin was > 200 \u03bcM, which was the same as the positive control, ribavirin. Quercetin exhibited dose-dependent antiviral effects against EV71, which meant quercetin could inhibit EV71 infection only when it reached a certain concentration. Actually, quercetin had an EC50 of 12.1 \u03bcM for RD cells and 8.8 \u03bcM for Vero cells against EV71 infection, with selective indexes of > 16.6 and > 22.8, respectively. An approximately ten-fold inhibitory activity against EV71 relative to ribavirin was observed. Selectivity index (SI) values \u22654 are considered suitable for antiviral agents [41] , which suggesting that quercetin is an effective anti-EV71 agent with a relatively safe profile. Previous reports also demonstrated that quercetin showed potent anti-EV71 activity without toxic effects [29] . These results suggest that quercetin has potential for use in therapeutic application against EV71 infection.",

As previously reported, several flavonoids, including kaempferol and hesperetin, exhibit antiviral activity against EV71 through inhibition of the IRES; however, quercetin does not inhibit IRES-driven translation [29] . Another dietary flavonoid, apigenin, suppresses EV71 replication through a novel mechanism by targeting trans-acting factors [28] . The results of this study demonstrated that quercetin was able to effectively inhibit EV71 replication by inhibition of the activity of the virus-encoded 3C pro , and the results verified that flavonoids with similar structures exert different mechanisms against EV71. Further study of the affinity of quercetin for 3C pro is warranted to ascertain whether the compound affects other viral or cellular functions crucial for EV71 replication.",

The amounts of quercetin required to inhibit purified EV71 3C pro activity in vitro were higher than those required to block EV71 replication, this is because the higher concentrations of 3C pro present in vitro required more quercetin for inhibition. Viral 3C pro is a multifunctional protein involved in binding viral RNA and RNA replication, in addition to a number of other biological processes. It has also been reported that 3C pro can impair host RNA processing and polyadenylation by cleavage of the cellular CstF-64 protein, leading to enhanced viral RNA replication [7] . The 3C protein can also trigger apoptosis through the caspase pathway in neuronal cells [42] . In this study, treatment of infected cells with quercetin reduced yields of viral RNA and inhibited EV71-induced apoptosis. These results led us to conclude that the inhibition of viral RNA synthesis and EV71-induced apoptosis in RD cells by quercetin was the result of its inhibition of viral 3C pro activity.",

Quercetin has also been identified as a potent inhibitor of reverse transcriptases from rauscher murine leukemia virus (RLV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [44] . In this study, quercetin significantly inhibited the activity of 3Cpro of EV71. Further, we predicted the interaction between EV71 3C pro and quercetin and calculated the binding energy using molecular docking. Docking calculations between 3C pro and other flavonoids have been reported previously, and the accurate prediction of biomolecular conformation and binding energies of protein-ligand complexes exhibited similarities, including common binding sites Leu4, Leu8, Ser111, Met112, Phe113, and Pro115 [45, 46] . The amino acid sites predicted to be involved in 3Cpro-quercetin complexes included Met0, Arg4, Pro5, Ser111, Met112, Phe113, Leu4, Thr101, Pro115 (rank 1 and rank 2 in Table 2 ). Although these amino acid sites were explored for important roles in the interaction between EV71 3C pro and other flavonoids (or its phosphate ester), they have not been identified as involved in biological catalysis to date. Analysis of the 3C pro -quercetin interaction revealed that quercetin interacted with the 3C pro catalytic residues, His40, Glu71 and Cys147 (rank 7 and rank 8 in Table 2 ), which is different to other flavonoids, this binding may decrease EV71 3C pro activity. Moreover, for the initial manner of binding, predicted by the docking results (rank 0 in Table 2 ), quercetin was predicted to interact with numerous residues in 3C pro , including Tyr138, Phe140, Ala144, His161, Ile162, Gly163, Gly164, Gln168, Gly169, and Phe170. The molecular binding model of the 3C pro -quercetin complex revealed that quercetin may stably insert into the substrate-binding pocket of EV71 3C pro via numerous hydrogen bond interactions. Similar binding mechanisms have been reported for the interactions between flavonoids and 3CLpro in SARS-CoV [43] , but not EV71. Therefore, these modes of interaction between different flavonoids and various viruses could be used as a reference for the design of 3C pro inhibitors.",

The experiments were performed three times and the representative results were shown or absence of quercetin. Apoptosis levels were measured using an annexin-V-FITC/PI kit. As shown inFig. 1g, EV71 infection contributed to apoptosis and cell death; RD cells infected with EV71 showed a significant fluorescence drift to the right (representative of early apoptosis) and the upper-right quadrant (representative of late apoptosis or death) compared with mock-infected cells. While similar fluorescence drift was barely detectable in the presence of 50 \u03bcM quercetin. These results indicate that quercetin could effectively inhibit virus-induced apoptosis and death of RD cells.",
