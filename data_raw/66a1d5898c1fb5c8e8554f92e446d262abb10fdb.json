In PMWS-affected animals, neutralizing antibodies could either not be found (sera from field studies) or were detected in low titres between 7 and 14 DPI only (sera from experimentally inoculated SPF pigs). Differences were also found in the evolution of specific antibody isotypes titres against PCV2. In healthy pigs, IgM antibodies persisted until the end of the study, whereas in PMWS-affected pigs they quickly decreased or remained present at low titres. The mean titres of other antibody isotypes (IgG1, IgG2 and IgA), were slightly lower in PMWS-affected pigs compared to their healthy group mates at the end of each study.",

Porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2) and chicken anaemia virus are able to maintain a high level of replication up to one month or longer after experimental inoculation (Bolin et al., 2001; Imai et al., 1999) [1, 2] . The human hepatitis-related TT-virus, also a member of the circoviridae family (Nishizawa et al., 1997) [3] , is able to maintain a constant viremia for a period of more than 3 years in infected patients (Lefrere et al., 2000) [4] . The ability of these small viruses to persist and replicate for such a long time in their host, indicates a failure of the host's immunologic response to efficiently recognize and/or remove virus particles or virus-infected cells from the body.",

The syndrome is characterized by clinical signs such as anaemia, jaundice and severe weight loss and histopathological lesions including lymphocyte depletion and infil-tration of monocytes in lymphoid tissues. It is generally accepted that other factors, including other viral infections such as porcine parvovirus (Allan et al., 2000a) [7] or porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (Allan et al., 2000b) [8] or a stimulation of the immune system (Krakowka et al., 2001) [9] , influence the clinical outcome of the infection. A high and persisting PCV2-replication level was found to be a crucial factor in the pathogenesis of the disease. The demonstration of an intense PCV2-replication was therefore incorporated in the case definition of PMWS in order to differentiate the disease from other chronic disorders leading to the manifestation of similar clinical symptoms (Segal\u00e9s and Domingo, 2002) [10] .",

In a subsequent study, the evolution in PCV2-replication was monitored in individual gnotobiotic pigs (Meerts et al., 2005) [13] . During the first two weeks of the experiment, the evolution of the PCV2-titre in inguinal lymph nodes of inoculated pigs showed little variation. At later stages of the infection, two patterns developed. In most pigs, PCV2-titres decreased between 15 and 21 DPI. One of the PCV2-inoculated pigs, showed Course of IPMA and SN (sensitive) antibody titres in experimentally PCV2-inoculated gnotobiotic and SPF pigs Figure 1 Course of IPMA and SN (sensitive) antibody titres in experimentally PCV2-inoculated gnotobiotic and SPF pigs. Full symbols: pigs with low PCV2 replication (gnotobiotic) or subclinically infected pigs (SPF); empty symbol: pig with high PCV2-replication (gnotobiotic) or PMWS-affected pigs (SPF). [11, 12] . From these observations, it could be concluded that not all pigs are equally able to deal with a PCV2-infection. When the relation between the onset of the adaptive immune response against PCV2 was monitored in these pigs, an interesting observation was made. Using a sensitive PCV2-neutralization assay, PCV2-neutralizing antibodies could be detected in all PCV2-inoculated pigs starting from 15 DPI, except in the pig with high PCV2-replication (Meerts et al., 2005) [13] . This study suggested a correlation between the absence or delayed production of PCV2-neutralizing antibodies and an increased level of replication of the virus in experimentally inoculated pigs. The latter study was performed in gnotobiotic piglets. Previously, it has been shown that the adaptive immune response against viral infections in gnotobiotic pigs which are raised in a sterile environment may deviate to some extent from the response of pigs in a conventional environment (Mehrazar et al., 1993; Butler et al., 2002; Souza et al., 2004) [14] [15] [16] . Therefore, the observation made in PCV2-inoculated gnotobiotic piglets should be confirmed in naturally infected and experimentally inoculated conventional pigs.",

            "text": "Neutralizing antibodies have important functions in the defence of animals and humans against viral infections. Starting from the moment they appear, neutralizing antibodies bind and neutralize the virus and prevent further spread in the body by inhibiting attachment and infection of new cells. It has been shown that neutralizing antibod-ies against many viruses are more rapidly induced during the immune response and reach higher titres compared to antibodies against other viral epitopes (Bachmann and Zinkernagel, 1997) [26] . In contrast, neutralizing antibodies against PCV2 could only be detected starting from 10 dpi by using a particularly sensitive SN assay (Meerts et al., 2005) [13] . These SN titres rose slowly until they could be detected with the classical SN assay starting from 4 weeks after inoculation (Pogranichnyy et al., 2000) [24]. The slow induction of neutralizing antibodies is a very effective mechanism for the virus to ensure a long period of replication in its host. In previous work, the observation was made that an increased replication of the virus in one pig, was correlated with a lack of neutralizing antibody production (Meerts et al., 2005) [13] . In the present study, it was confirmed that the absence of PCV2-neutralizing antibodies is indeed a recurring phenomenon in pigs with high PCV2-replication. In experimentally PCV2inoculated SPF pigs and in two field studies, a good correlation was observed between the absence or low titres of neutralizing antibodies against PCV2 and the occurrence of a high virus replication and the development of PMWS. This observation reveals a possible mechanism that allows the virus to replicate to a higher extent in a limited number of pigs. These pigs seem to be unable to recognize or produce antibodies against the epitope(s) that is (are) involved in the neutralization of the virus. With relation to other viral infections such as pseudorabies virus (Jacobs and Kimman, 1994) [27] , influenza virus (Lambkin and Dimmock, 1995) [28] or human rotavirus (Green et al., 1990 ) [29] , it has been shown that different animals do not all recognize the same epitopes. Various syndromes have already been ascribed to the inability of certain individuals to recognize certain epitopes (susceptibility to mastitis (Lunden et al., 1990) [30] , clinical outcome of Marek's disease virus (Wakenell et al., 1996) [31] ). The susceptibility to these syndromes is highly genetically determined. It has been demonstrated previously that the prevalence of PMWS highly differs between regions. Since contemporary pig industry still uses region-specific breeds, this could be interpreted as an indication that PMWS would be partly genetically determined. Therefore, it would be worthwhile to check for a similar mechanism in the recognition of PCV2-neutralizing epitope and the subsequent influence on the susceptibility of the host to PMWS.",

It was observed that these pigs also showed a peak of IgM titres at that same time point. The IgM antibodies in these pigs did not lead to the production of neutralizing IgG or IgA antibodies, which may indicate that the neutralizing epitope was not targeted by the humoral immune response. However, the pronounced B-cell lymphopenia that was observed in these pigs (Nielsen et al., 2003) [32] may also constitute an important factor in the mechanism causing these changes in the humoral immune response. The parallel evolution of the SN and IgM titres in these pigs suggests that the IgM antibodies might be responsible for the low level of PCV2neutralization that was observed at 10 DPI. Possibly IgM antibodies which are directed against non-neutralizing epitopes, are able to neutralize PCV2 to some extent by sterical hindrance. Indeed, IgM antibodies are secreted in a pentamere formation that is much larger compared to any other antibody isotype. This pentamere form contains 10 Fab fragments that would enable it to bind PCV2 at different sites. In PMWS-affected pigs in the Danish field study, a peak in IgM antibodies was not detected probably because time intervals between the different blood collections were too long (3 weeks). When comparing IgM profiles in both experimental studies, it is observed that in the gnotobiotic pig with high PCV2-replication, low IgM titres were detected until the end of the study. In general the humoral immune response in gnotobiotic pigs was delayed compared to the SPF pigs, which might be the reason that no decrease in IgM titres was observed in this pig. The low IgM titres in this gnotobiotic pig might correspond to the slight increase in PCV2-neutralization (up to 16% whereas in other pigs they reached 97%) that was observed in this pig. This slight neutralization however, was not significantly different compared to the result obtained from serum of the same pig before inoculation.",

After a viral infection, IgM-type antibodies are the first antibodies that are being produced. Generally, the plasma cells that produce these antibodies go through an isotype switch and start producing other isotypes of antibodies resulting a down-regulation of IgM production (Esser and Radbruch, 1997) [33] . A persistence of IgM type antibodies has already been described during the immune response against other viruses such as the coronavirus responsible for the severe acute respiratory syndrome in humans (Woo et al., 2004) [34] or the human parvovirus B19 (Yeagashi et al., 1989 ) [35] . However, the mechanism of this prolonged presence of IgM antibodies has not been defined yet. It is known that in older animals such as breeding sows, exceptionally high IPMA antibody titres against PCV2 can be found compared to antibody titres against other viruses. It may be hypothesized that the persistent presence of IgM lies at the base of this observation.",

(2005) [13] . A similar neutralization assay had previously also been used to detect neutralizing antibodies against porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (Delputte et al., 2005) [25]. Briefly, a standard infectious dose of PCV2 (10 3.7 TCID 50 of strain Stoon-1010) was incubated for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C with 25% of the serum. Afterwards, this virus-serum mixture was inoculated on PCV-negative PK-15 cells. After 1 hour, the inoculum was removed, cell cultures were washed 2 times, new cell medium was added and cultures were maintained at 37\u00b0C in the presence of 5% CO2. After 36 hours of incubation, cells were fixed and stained for PCV2 antigens using an immunoperoxidase technique. The number of PCV2-infected cells was counted and compared to the number of infected cells in a PK-15 culture inoculated with a PCV2 stock treated with the serum of the pig before inoculation. The result of this seroneutralization assay was expressed as a percentage of reduction of PCV2-infection.",
