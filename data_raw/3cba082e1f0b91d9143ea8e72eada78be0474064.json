Many swine diseases and ailments affect the productivity particularly pre-weaned piglets, and it was estimated that diarrhea alone accounts for a reduction of 8-14 g/day in average daily weight gain in the 1 st week of life [2] . Every year, huge losses in terms of health and productivity are attributed to piglet's diarrhea worldwide. The mechanism of viral and bacterial coinfection contribution to disease augmentation was first explained while studying role of secondary bacterial infections during influenza pandemics [3] in which many bacterial agents were associated, but Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae are the major bacteria associated in concurrent infection with influenza virus [4] . Researchers have demonstrated that a single susceptible host is attacked and often infected by two or more pathogen species or strains [5, 6] , in which case coinfecting pathogens may act synergistically, resulting in even greater pathogenesis and such involvement may contribute to the overall disease burden in host species both individually and together in a herd [7] . Such concurrent infections not only augment the clinical course of infections but can also influence host immune responses to pathogens [8, 9] and eventually affect the effectiveness of many disease control program in a state or country [10] . Coinfecting pathogens in any species may cause severe diarrhea than infection with a single pathogen alone [11] . Most often concurrent infection with multiple pathogens Available at www.veterinaryworld.org/Vol.12/February-2019/6.pdf is common particularly among young children with diarrhea and often followed a long severe course and manifestation than infection with a single causal pathogen [12, 13] .",

Diarrhea remains the second leading cause of death in young children worldwide, accounting for 1.3 million deaths annually and it alone amounts to an estimated 4.1% of the total global burden of disease [15, 16] . In food animal species, an array of infectious agents including bacteria, viruses, and parasites cause acute and chronic diarrhea in piglets including Campylobacter spp., Clostridium perfringens, diarrheagenic Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Rotavirus, Coronaviruses (transmissible gastroenteritis virus), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, as well as by nematode and protozoan parasites [17, 18] . Such enteric infections lead to gastroenteritis causing life-threatening implication, especially to newborns. Although there are many diarrheagenic pathogens, most studies have been focused only on one pathogen or on few causal agents, as a result, a clear concept of understanding of the relative importance of such causal pathogens and other related factors may have strong biases.",

However, Katsuda et al. [31] noted that infectious diarrhea in newborn piglets is usually related to the presence of a single pathogen and mixed infections are considered less common. In another study by Zhang et al. [32] recorded 4.3% of positive cooccurrences of enteric pathogens in sick children in Southwest China where E. coli and Norovirus were the predominant coinfective pathogens. These reports suggested that coinfection of pathogens varies from one region to another geographical region. Neonatal diarrhea, particularly in young piglets, is often complex with a mixture of infectious agents and other factors such as passive immunity transferred by colostrum and milk, environmental temperature and humidity [33, 34] , and managemental factor [35] , all contributing to its manifestation.",

            "text": "Many researchers [38] [39] [40] [41] reported that RVA is the most common cause of viral diarrhea in neonatal pigs compared to Type C, and other workers have detected porcine Rotavirus in diarrheic fecal samples in nursing, weaning, and post-weaning pigs either alone or in combination of other enteric pathogens such as E. coli, Salmonella, and Adenovirus [42, 43] . Rotavirus A is only often detected as the sole infectious agent than as coinfection in cases of neonatal diarrhea [31, 44] . This is in agreement with our finding in which RVA was detected only in one diarrheic sample as coinfection with EPEC. Although it is clear that RVA has an overwhelming impact on diarrhea illnesses in children, coinfection with other enteric pathogens appears to aggravate diarrhea severity. These findings should serve as evidence for public health services when planning and developing intervention programs [32] . Diarrheagenic E. coli are important common bacterial pathogen involve in piglets diarrhea. According to Fairbrother and Gyles [33] , the main pathotype of E. coli responsible for intestinal disease in pigs is enterotoxigenic E. coli and EPEC also known as attaching and effacing E. coli. Coinfection of EPEC with other infectious agents indicates that EPEC potentially accelerates gastroenteritis and is one of the main pathogens involved in coinfection with other diarrheagenic bacterial or viral pathogens. Shiga-toxigenic E. coli was detected as coinfective strain in two diarrheic samples. The strain is one of the leading causes of diarrhea in the developing world and importantly in Northeast India, and they are commonly recovered from diarrheic feces of food-producing animals including porcine [45, 46] .",

The reason for variation probably might be due to different management being practice from farm to farm, particularly in case of Picobirnaviruses which can enter and transmit mainly through sewage and untreated water in the farm [48] . Crossbreed piglets recorded higher detection of mixed infection than local indigenous piglets. Although the variation is not very significant, it may be possible that the local non-descriptive piglets possess better immunity against natural infection than crossbreed animals. In addition, the weaning age of piglets of the local animals is generally 8-10 weeks in comparison with the crossbreed animals in organized farms (within 6 weeks). Maternal immunity might also play an important role in resisting the infection in piglets, particularly in indigenous pigs. In the same region in a study of diarrheagenic pathogens, reported a higher prevalence rate of Picobirnavirus and STEC in crossbreed than indigenous piglets population [24, 46] . In our study, samples collected during different seasons showed that coinfection of enteric pathogens was found to be most common during the summer (June-August). However, due to paucity of reports regarding seasonal variation of coinfection, hence, this did not allow us to compare our results. The humid climatic condition during summer with persistent rainfall in Northeast region may be an important reason for entry and transmission of infection among the pig population. Such climatic condition also allows suitable environment for persistent enteric pathogens such as E. coli, Salmonella, Rotavirus, and Picobirnavirus to cause diarrhea in piglets.",

In the present study, a total of 11 diarrheic fecal samples were detected for a combination of at least two different enteric pathogens which are suggestive of the fact that a number of enteric pathogens may cause diarrhea either singly or in combination. Considering the importance of E. coli, Salmonella, Rotavirus, and Picobirnavirus as important diarrheal causing agents in animal species and human, hence, there is a possibility of transmission between porcine and human population, particularly in rural tribal areas in North East Hilly region of India were people reared two or three pigs in close proximity with human habitation and most share common drinking water.",

In conclusion, it may be stated that coinfections with either of the four enteric bacterial and viral pathogens persist and associated with the piglet diarrhea in Northeast region of India, particularly with Picobirnavirus and S. Typhimurium. Higher prevalence is recorded from unorganized compared to organized farm and higher detection in crossbreed compared to the local indigenous pigs with higher detection during the summer season. This probably the first systematic study of the prevalence of the coinfection of important diarrheagenic bacterial and viral pathogens associated with piglet diarrhea in India.",
