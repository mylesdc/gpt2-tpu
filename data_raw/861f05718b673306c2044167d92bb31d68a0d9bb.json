Analyses of blame and heroisation during the 2014-15 Ebola epidemic, using Twitter and Facebook posts in French and English, 2,8 suggest that heroic status was widely conferred on ordinary individuals and insiders rather than altruistic foreigners, as in other crises. The term local hero is not an empty phrase: identification of local heroes as they emerge, and working with them (online and offline), could have a strong pay-off in communication campaigns. What constitutes a hero during a time of crisis is nuanced and context-specific, however, and needs careful qualitative work to understand. Heroes can include, for example, whistle-blowers (who put their careers on the line to alert the public) and health workers (who generate essential information while doing their work). All these figures can be seen emerging during the COVID-19 outbreak.",

For instance, discussions can coalesce not only around conspiracy theories but also around real uncertainties and blind spots in health authorities' communications. 9, 10 In times of crisis, public authorities tend to focus their concern on avoiding panic and filtering the information they provide to the public. But trust is a crucial support to public health systems. It is during crises such as the COVID-19 outbreak that this trust is put to the test.",
