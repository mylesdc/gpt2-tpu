The laws have established direct foundations for spread control based on scientific evidences from the surveillance, notification and report of infectious diseases, the supply of hospital treatment and emergency medicine to minimize damage, and financial support for recovery. The actors for these roles are the central government, local governments, and medical personnel, who play the roles within the infrastructure comprising the national health care system, including development of health care resources, organization of the resources, health care management, supply of health care services, and financial supports [2] . Components of infrastructure in the national health care system seek to prevent pandemics of emerging infectious diseases. In cases of emerging infectious diseases where vaccines or drugs are insufficient or unavailable, the development and organization of resources, the supply of health care services, and financial support all have significant effects on response to infectious diseases and minimization of damage [3] . For example, the indicated domestic causes of MERS were individual problems of vulnerabilities of the national infectious disease management system and nosocomial infection prevention control, inefficiency of health care delivery systems, health care use and nursing culture, as well as correlations between the problems [4] .",

Measures for response to emerging infectious diseases require collaborative governance that distinguishes the role of the central government from those of metropolitan cities/provinces and si/gun/gu, and then closely interconnects them. In addition, it should protect the human rights and privacy of those who are exposed to infectious diseases, and be in a form ensuring commonly shared rights of all the subjects. In the present paper, we reviewed the legislative procedure of the Infectious Disease Control and Prevention Act, analyzed its problems, and then proposed the direction to improve the Infec- munity. This has been found all over the world including Africa, Southeast Asia, South America, Europe, and the US and the concept expanded the scope of response from containment of infectious diseases within the border to a supranational level [8] . IHR 2005 also affected the law of the Korea: the 'Communicable Diseases Prevention Act. ' On December 29, 2009 , the Communicable Diseases Prevention Act was fully revised (enforced on December 30, 2010) , and the term, 'communicable diseases' has been changed to 'infectious diseases' so as to include both communicable and non-communicable diseases. The revision was not limited to the term. In Aticles 2, 11-13 of the Infectious Disease Control and Prevention Act, Class 1-5 infectious diseases and designated infectious diseases were named legal infectious diseases, because they were designated by law. On the other hand, WHO monitors infectious diseases, bioterror infectious diseases, sexually transmitted infectious diseases, zoonotic infectious diseases, and health care-related infectious diseases, and these were designated as notifiable infectious diseases by the Minister of Health and Welfare (MOHW).",

The Incident Management System classifies potential risk factors for public health into biological, artificial, intentional, and natural factors, determines the order of risk management based on seriousness of all potential risk factors for public health, chance of incidence, and response ability, and then takes appropriate measures as a response [12] . The US CDC supports state governments and the Department of Health and Human Service. The Incident Command System refers to a temporary management procedure that can manage finance, human resources, facilities and risk communication from the time of incidence. The Minister of Health and Human Service (HHS) forms the HHS Secretary's Command Center, in which he/she makes preparations at all health care levels, and performs response and recovery activities.

In addition, the medical institutions were found to have issues, including overcrowding in emergency centers of general hospitals, settings of emergency centers operated as multi-patient rooms, and increased chance of infection due to family nursing [15] . Thus, the Infectious Disease Control and Prevention Act was revised, focusing on reform of infectious disease control system, supplementation of specialists in infectious diseases, preparation of measures to manage and oversee infection in hospitals, improvement of structure and culture of emergency centers, compensation of medical institutions and pharmacies for loss, compensation of patients and fatalities, and requests and disclosure of information at the time of any public health crisis caused by infectious diseases.

However, public health risk factors have been increasing in random and atypical forms, so that it has become harder to accurately assess their influences and severities, classify infectious diseases and define their scopes. In addition to disease onset evidences based on incidence rate, mortality rate and epidemiological information, chances of local incidence or inflow from other countries, chance of prevention and treatment, and sensitivity of the public to diseases, there are more diverse evaluation criteria. To evaluate potential risks caused by influenza virus, the US CDC has proposed assessment criteria through the Influenza Risk Assessment Tool, in which viral characteristics, population characteristics, and ecological and epidemiological standards were presented [17] . To assess risk of seasonal influenza, the European Union conducts survey in the countries that experience influenza every year, in addition to collecting clinical, epidemiological and virological data, by which seriousness of infectious diseases is evaluated [18] . The Tool for Influenza Pandemic Risk Assessment in the WHO uses influences, risk of transmission, and necessity to ban travel or trade as assessment criteria [19] . Classification of infectious diseases is related to a declaration system, because the time to declare and report to community health centers and KCDC is different depending on the infectious disease.

Regarding the legal aspects, notification is an administrative measure that an administrative agency publicly announces to unspecified individuals, only playing a role of spreading information, whereas notification itself has no legal effect related to the people's rights and duties. To become a legal order, notification is required to have specific and clear legal delegations [22] . The requirement of specific description about each individual article as a foundation of delegation is to protect the people's basic rights. Considering the characteristics of response measure to infectious diseases that may cause conflicts between the duty of the state to protect the people's basic rights and the individuals' rights to move freely, notification has a limitation in protection of basic rights. In addition, notification as a specific norm control becomes effective five days after a public announcement unless there are special regulations in other laws and announcing documents [23] .
