The aim of this study was to evaluate the epidemiological, clinical and laboratory characteristics of this infection in children and adults. Methods: We evaluated the epidemiologic characteristics of patients infected with the 2009 H1N1 influenza A virus (4,463 patients, age range from 2 mo to 86 y), and the clinical and laboratory findings of 373 inpatients (80/ 217 children, \u2264 15 y, had pneumonia and 36/156 adults, > 16 y, had pneumonia) in a single hospital during the epidemic.",

The rates of admission and pneumonia were 8.4% (373/4,463) and 2.5% (116/4,463), respectively. The rates of admission and pneumonia, total duration of fever, the frequency of underlying diseases, and the values of C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate tended to increase as age increased; highest rates were found in the \u2265 65 y group. Pneumonia was founded more boys than girls in children, but more female than male in adults. The adult patients with pneumonia had higher leukocyte counts with lower lymphocyte differentials than the group without pneumonia, as shown in children group. Conclusion: Our results suggest that the immunologic reaction to viral insults may be associated with age, sex and underlying diseases, and that unknown herd immunity may affect populations. The patients with underlying diseases, especially in older patients may have immunologic insufficiency that is associated with immunologic consumption by the underlying diseases.",

Although the mortality of the 2009 H1N1 influenza A virus pandemic (2009 H1N1 flu) has been reported to be not exceed that of seasonal (inter-pandemic) influenza, some epidemiological characteristics of the pandemic, including its age distribution, differ from those of seasonal influenza [1, 2] . In seasonal influenza, young infants and older persons are vulnerable and the mortality rate is higher in the extreme of age groups. However, in pandemic influenza occurring a 10-40 year cycle, people of all ages without immunity may be affected, and young healthy adults can be fatal due to pandemic influenza [1] [2] [3] [4] . During the 20th century, 3 pandemics were documented: 1918 Spanish flu, 1957 Asian flu and 1968 Hong Kong flu. The 2009 H1N1 flu was the first pandemic in the 21st century [5] . In the 2009 H1N1 flu and in other pandemics, a majority of infected patients recovered from this infection without complications. However, some previously healthy patients developed pneumonia. Patients that developed severe pneumonia can experience acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multi-organ failure, and even death. Nevertheless, the mortality rate of the 2009 H1N1 flu was far less than that of previous pandemics [6] [7] [8] [9] .",

Some experimental and clinical studies have suggested that the pathogenesis of acute lung injury in influenza infections is associated with excessive host response such as the cell-mediated immune reaction [10] [11] [12] . The immune system of the host matures through childhood and then declines as people age [13] [14] [15] . Thus, it could be postulated that the infants and the elderly have either an immature or reduced immune response to viral infection, respectively. Furthermore, this may explain the higher mortality rate in these age groups during the winter influenza season. However, we previously observed that pneumonia and severe pneumonia were more prevalent in the 5-9 y group than in the 0-4 y group [16] .",

In laboratory findings, the C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) values displayed similar correlation (ANOVA test) ( Table 2 ). The \u2265 65 y group showed significant differences compared to other age groups in nearly all of the examined parameters (c 2 test and Student's t-test, data not shown). The frequency of underlying diseases was significantly different among age groups. Many patients had more than one underlying diseases and these patients were more prevalent in older groups.

            "text": "It is unknown what characteristics of the 2009 H1N1 flu caused the trends identified in this study. In Korea, because the rates of seasonal influenza vaccination during the recent decade was relatively even in the adult population with higher rates of vaccination in the under 5 y group and the older than 60 y group, it is unlikely that the vaccination status of the population was responsible for the age distribution of this pandemic. In addition, the results from serologic studies on the crossreactive antibody response to the 2009 H1N1 virus before the pandemic in all age groups were different among the populations [22] [23] [24] [25] . In Korea, prior to the pandemic the seroprevalence of antibodies that were cross-reactive to the H1N1 virus were 20.0% in the 19-59 y group and 27.3% in the older than 60 y group with no statistical differences among adult groups [23] . Dudareva et al. in Germany reported that those younger than 50 y group had highest levels of cross-reactive antibodies prior to the pandemic and the highest infection rates. Furthermore, they proposed that one of the possible reasons for the lower risk of infection among older persons could be pre-existing immunity not detectable by cross-reactive antibodies [24] . Given that this pandemic reemerged nearly 4 decades after last pandemic (1968 Hong Kong flu), it is possible that cross-immunity and/or an unknown herd immunity against a previous pandemic influenza virus (known as H3N2) may have played a role on populations in this pandemic, although the virus subtypes were different. Previous epidemiological studies on measles in the South Pacific islands, including Hawaii, have provided the new insights into new pathogens and herd immunity [26] [27] [28] . Epidemiologically, it is well documented that when a new pathogenic virus, such as the measles virus, is introduced into an immune-naive isolated population, nearly all inhabitants of all ages are affected, and that the severity of the disease and the mortality rate is very high (> 10-50%). In addition, the mortality is paradoxically the highest in the healthiest age-group (20-40 y) with the most active immune function. Then, in subsequent epidemics the severity of the disease begins to weaken because of unknown herd immunity [26, 27] . In Far\u00f6e Islands, when the measles were re-introduced 65 years after the first disaster, the older than 65 population was protected from measles, and the mortality in this population was far less than the first attack [26, 28] . Therefore, it is possible that the epidemiological characteristics of pandemic influenza are similar to those of measles. The severity of influenza in this pandemic was far less than that of the Spanish flu, which was a devastating disaster, because of the highest mortality rate in young adult groups. In addition, changing epidemiology has been observed for some viral infections, such as hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome after the introduction of the vaccine in Korea [29] , and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) after the introduction of antivirals [30] . An initially severe disease with high mortality can transform into a milder phenotype over time.",

In Korea during the 2009 H1N1 flu period, Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that a total of 740,835 patients (1.5% of the 49 millions of total population in South Korea, 1,492 per100,000 persons) had been infected with H1N1 virus and confirmed by RT-PCR, and also reported that 225 of these patients died [9] . Therefore, there may have been many patients with asymptomatic or mild phenotypes in the 2009 H1N1 flu, regardless of the half RT-PCR positivity caused by febrile influenza-like illness. Follow-up seroprevalence studies conducted after the 2009 H1N1 flu have shown that greater than 40-50% of the examined samples from young adults were positive [24, 25] , and these findings support the possibility of the unknown herd immunity to pandemic influenza. In present cohort study, the calculated incidence of pneumonia in the 2009 pandemic was 2.6% of the infected patients with no fatal cases. The mortality rate in Korea was reported as 0.3 per 1,000 patients (0.03%), and other countries reported a range of mortality rates from 0.01 to 0.05% [7, 8, 17, 19, 21] .",

            "text": "In this study, we found that clinical parameters such as admission rate, the frequency of underlying diseases, the rate of pneumonia and the values of laboratory parameter, such as CRP and ESR were associated with the increasing age. Especially, in the \u2265 65 y group (mean age 74 y), which showed significant difference compared to the other age groups all parameters. The \u2265 65 y group made only 0.9% of the total H1N1 virus infected patients (42/4,463) . However, 5.6% of the admitted patients (21/373) and 9.5% of the pneumonia patients (11/116) were \u2265 65 y. It has been well documented that influenza can exacerbate underlying chronic disease, including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic hepatic or renal insufficiency, diabetes, or other cardiovascular conditions [6] [7] [8] [9] . Given that a majority of H1N1 infected patients recovered without developing pneumonia, it is possible that the previously healthy patients that did develop progressive pneumonia may have had a hyperactive immunologic reaction to the viral insults [10] [11] [12] . However, because the ultimate recovery from viral infection should be controlled by immune system of the host, including T cells, we hypothesised that the patients with underlying diseases that require immune cells to control the diseases, may have an immunological defect as a result of immunological consumption. Patients with underlying diseases, especially older patients who have natural immune weakness, may experience a delayed recovery from viral insult or die from the deterioration of underlying diseases. Thus, it is possible that in these patient groups, the cause of mortality may be an individual immunological defect rather than viral infection. This phenomenon has been observed in other systemic infection including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) by corona viruses and was recently observed in hemolytic uremic syndrome, which is caused by toxin-producing E. coli [33, 34] . Furthermore, the proportion of these older patients (> 60 y) with underlying diseases accounted for > 50% of the fatal cases in Korea, despite the small number of total infections in this group (1.2% of the total infected patients) and in this study [9, 35] .",

We previously reported that treating children with severe pneumonia with early corticosteroids effectively prevented disease progression [10, 16, 37] . In the present adult series, two previously healthy female patients (30 y and 42 y) had progress pneumonia and developed ARDS. Early infusion of corticosteroid (methylprednisolone) resulted in rapid recovery without mechanical ventilation therapy. The results of corticosteroid treatment on severely affected adult ARDS patients are also controversial [38, 39] . It is possible that the numbers of patients with underlying diseases and different modalities for respiratory care among the study groups may be the major confounding factors with regards to mortality after treatment with immune modulators (corticosteroids) for patients with severe ARDS patients [38, 39] . In addition, in this pandemic a part of pneumonia patients who were previously healthy presented with acute severe respiratory distress that was similar to an acute asthmatic attack [10] . Many of these patients may have been treated with early corticosteroids because it was assumed that they were having an asthmatic episode. Therefore, if these patients improved after corticosteroid treatment, they would not be included in the corticosteroid treated ARDS groups. The effect of corticosteroids on viral replication is controversial [40, 41] . Additionally, it is unknown whether the virus particle itself or other mediators induce inflammation in lung lesions [10] . The corticosteroids may reduce the systemic immune reaction caused by hyperactive immune cells (T cells) with hypercytokinemia [10, 38] .",

The epidemiologic characteristics of this pandemic suggest that unknown herd immunity may have acted on the populations. The greater than 65 y group had the highest rate of underlying diseases and higher admission rate, pneumonia rate, total duration of fever, and CRP and ESR values than other age groups. These results indicated that these patients may have an immunologic defect that is associated with immunologic consumption by underlying diseases.
