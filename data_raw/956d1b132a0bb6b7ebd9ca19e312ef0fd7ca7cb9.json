Rapid identification of infected calves is essential to control BRV successfully. Therefore development of simple, highly specific, and sensitive detection method for BRV is needed. Results: A reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay was developed and optimized for rapid detection of BRV. Specific primer sets were designed to target the sequences of the VP6 gene of the neonatal calf diarrhea virus (NCDV) strain of BRV. The RT-LAMP assay was performed in a water bath for 60 minutes at 63\u00b0C, and the amplification products were visualized either directly or under ultraviolet light. This BRV specific RT-LAMP assay could detect 3.32 copies of subtype A BRV. No cross-reactions were detected with other bovine pathogens. The ability of RT-LAMP to detect bovine rotavirus was further evaluated with 88 bovine rectal swab samples. Twenty-nine of these samples were found to be positive for BRV using RT-LAMP. The BRV-specific-RT-LAMP results were also confirmed by real-time RT-PCR assay. Conclusions: The bovine rotavirus-specific RT-LAMP assay was highly sensitive and holds promise as a prompt and simple diagnostic method for the detection of group A bovine rotavirus infection in young calves.",

Rotavirus infections with group A are the major cause of acute diarrhea among newborn animals and humans leading to death [3, 4] . Identification of infected calves, in combination with a proper vaccination program, is essential to control BRV successfully. The current methods for the detection and characterization of BRV, which include virus isolation, immunoassay, electron microscopy, and nucleic acid hybridization, are time consuming and laborious [5] [6] [7] . On the other hand, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been used successfully for the detection and characterization of BRV [8] [9] [10] . Unfortunately, PCR assays require sophisticated equipment, which is costly to maintain, and must be performed in specialized laboratories (Additional file 1: Figure S1 and S2).",

            "text": "The recently described loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) can amplify specific target DNA sequences with high sensitivity and can be completed within 60 minutes under isothermal conditions without the need of a thermal cycler and specialized laboratory [11] . This technique eliminates the heat denaturation step for DNA synthesis used in conventional PCR, and relies instead on auto-cycling strand displacement DNA synthesis achieved by a DNA polymerase with high strand displacement activity and a set of two specially designed inner and two outer primers. Another important feature of LAMP is a resulting color change following the addition of a fluorescent dye, making it visible to the naked eye. The LAMP assay has been used successfully to detect many pathogens [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] and in using reverse transcriptase, it has been further adapted for the detection of RNA viruses [15, 16] . The objective of the study reported here was to develop and optimize the reverse transcription LAMP (RT-LAMP) assay for the detection of group A BRV in calves. Table 1 lists the pathogen strains used in this study and describes the following: ten group A BRV strains, five other bovine pathogens other than BRV, four negative controls, three normal bovines rectal swab samples (one each from normal bovine nasal mucus and blood sample). Nasal mucus swabs and blood samples were taken from all bovine following routine pre slaughter examination for the normal animals to be slaughter. The collection of these samples could be considered as part of regular and routine examination, therefore no official review and approval of the Guangxi Veterinary Research Institute was needed. The viruses were propagated using rhesus monkey epithelial cell line (MA-104) and grown in Eagle's minimal essential medium (MEM) according to previously described methods [6] . MEM was supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum free from BRV and BRV antibodies (Shijiqing, China). The BRV strains were titrated by plaque assay in MA-104 cells in accordance to the published protocols [6, 16] .",

A set of six primers comprised of two outer, two inner, and two loop primers was designed and is shown in Table 2 . The inner primers, which are known as the forward inner primer (FIP) and the backward inner primer (BIP), each have two distinct sequences corresponding to the sense and antisense sequences of the target, one for priming the first stage, and the other for self-priming in later stages in the reaction. FIP contains F1c (complementary to F1), and the F2 sequence. BIP contains the B1c sequence (complementary to B1), and the B2 sequence. The outer primers (F3 and B3) were used in the initial steps of LAMP reactions, but later during the isothermal cycling only the inner primers were used for strand displacement DNA synthesis. Two additional loop primers (loopF and loopB) were designed to accelerate the amplification reaction as described [18] . The sequences of the selected primers were compared to VP6 gene sequences [20] [21] [22] . All the primers were synthesized and purified by Invitrogen Inc (Guangzhou, China).",

Second, color change: 1 ml of 10,000 \u00d7 SYBR Green I nucleic acid stain was added to the tube after the reaction. Samples turning yellowgreen were considered positive, while samples turning orange were negative. Samples showing fluorescence under an ultraviolet hand lamp at a 365-nm wavelength were considered positive as described previously [12] . Samples were compared with a negative control to account for background fluorescence. Third, gel electrophoresis: run on a 1% agarose gel, RT-LAMP reaction end product yields a combination of DNA fragments of varying sizes [11] . Therefore, the presence of a smear or a pattern of multiple bands of different molecular weights indicates a positive result. A molecular marker was used to estimate amplified product size. Lastly, a restriction enzyme analysis: EcoRI and EcoRV restriction of the RT-LAMP product confirms reaction specificity [14] .

VP6 a group-specific gene of BRV is the most immunogenic viral protein and considered to be very conserved among group A BRV and suitable to use as conserved gene specific for BRV [21] [22] [23] . The RT-LAMP was determined to be specific, as no crossreactions were observed when other bovine pathogens were tested. The RT-LAMP technique offers several advantages over PCR for the detection of bovine rotavirus RNA. Firstly, the RT-LAMP demonstrates high efficiency under isothermal conditions without a significant influence of non-target DNA and demonstrates sensitivity identical to that of real-time RT-PCR assays. Secondly, the RT-LAMP is easy to perform once the appropriate primers are selected and optimized. The reaction requires only four primers, a Bst DNA polymerase, and a temperature adjustable conventional laboratory water bath. Thirdly, the results of RT-LAMP are visible to the naked eye without the need for electrophoresis. This is attributable to recognition of the target sequence by six primers in the initial stage and by four primers during the later stages of the RT-LAMP reaction. The RT-LAMP system possesses specificity in addition to high sensitivity and may be used in large-scale molecular surveys of BRV infections in the field.",
