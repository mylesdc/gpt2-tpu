Next, this study assessed the behavioral and physiologic responses of rats that were euthanized with 100% CO 2 infused at 10%, 30%, or 100% volume per minute displacement rates. Analysis of the concentrations of CO 2 and oxygen in the euthanasia chamber and the behavioral responses of the rats suggest that the use of the very low flow volume per minute displacement rate (10%) may prolong the duration of panicogenic ranges of ambient CO 2 , while the use of the higher flow volume per minute displacement rate (100%) increases agitation. Therefore, of the volume displacement per minute rates evaluated, this study suggests that 30% minimizes the potential pain and distress experienced by the animal.",

However, there is concern that the use of these gradual fill methods may increase the distress experienced by these animals. We evaluated social and anxiety behavior of rats that had been exposed to concentrations of CO 2 that did not cause a loss of consciousness. We also evaluated the physiologic changes of rats that were euthanized with gradual fill protocols as compared to rapid fill methods. We found that rats exposed to concentrations of CO 2 that did not cause a loss of consciousness did exhibit increased anxiety and decreased social behavior. We also found that the use of a 10% volume per minute displacement rate of CO 2 resulted in physiologic and behavioral changes suggestive of distress.",

However, exposing rats to CO 2 , concentrations as low as 7% CO 2 are reported to cause distress and 10%-20% CO 2 induces panic-associated behavior and physiology, but loss of consciousness does not occur until CO 2 concentrations are at least 40%. This suggests that the use of the currently recommended low flow volume per minute displacement rates create a situation where rats are exposed to concentrations of CO 2 that induce anxiety, panic, and distress for prolonged periods of time. This study first characterized the response of male rats exposed to normoxic 20% CO 2 for a prolonged period of time as compared to room air controls. It demonstrated that rats exposed to this experimental condition displayed clinical signs consistent with significantly increased panic-associated behavior and physiology during CO 2 exposure. When atmospheric air was then again delivered, there was a robust increase in respiration rate that coincided with rats moving to the air intake. The rats exposed",

Indeed, it should be remembered that it is impossible to euthanize an animal using a chemical anesthetic agent (injected or inhaled) without first inducing anesthesia. Therefore, the current recommendations for the use of inhalant anesthetics should be considered when evaluating the use of inhalant gases for euthanasia. Tranquilli and Grimm provide an overview of the four stages of inhalant anesthesia. Stage I (the stage of voluntary movement) lasts from the initial administration of the inhalant anesthesia until the loss of the righting reflex. As they progress to Stage II, the animal becomes ataxic and loses its ability to stand. An animal in Stage II will exhibit involuntary movements and vocalizations, but it is no longer conscious. Stage III includes the level of anesthesia where surgery can be performed. In Stage IV, the animal has extreme central nervous system and cardiovascular depression and will die unless the anesthetic agent is removed and the animal is resuscitated [6] . When performing surgery, the veterinarian targets Stage III, while in euthanasia, they target Stage IV. As with the selection of an appropriate agent for euthanasia, the ideal anesthetic permits rapid induction, minimizing the potential pain and distress experienced by the animal as they progress through Stage I of anesthesia.",

            "text": "Although the AVMA guidelines acknowledge that loss of consciousness (transition from stage I to stage II) will be more rapid if animals are initially exposed to a high concentration of an inhalant agent, they recommend gradual exposure because high concentrations of some gases, such as concentrations of CO 2 at the levels of 40%-50%, can be aversive and distressing [1, 7] . The AVMA Guidelines clearly state that high concentrations of CO 2 are associated with pain, but suggest that the potential distress associated with exposure to low concentrations of CO 2 over prolonged periods of time is not well characterized. Yet, the distressing effects of prolonged exposure to low concentrations of CO 2 for rats are well documented [8] . Homeostatic regulation of blood CO 2 concentrations is critical as CO 2 alters blood pH by combining with water to form carbonic acid, and even a small change in blood pH can be fatal (for review, see [9, 10] ). Initial elevations of arterial CO 2 (i.e., hypercapnia) lead to an increase in respiration rate and tidal volume to help \"blow off\" excess CO 2 (see review [11] ), but when arterial pH continues to decrease, a feeling of dyspnea and anxiety begin to emerge. This is followed by a feeling of fear and panic with moderate hypercapnia, and sedation and loss of consciousness during severe hypercapnia. For example, exposing humans to 5% CO 2 increases respiration responses without increasing anxiety, while exposure to 7.5% CO 2 increases anxiety symptoms (e.g., self-reports of fear and panic [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] ). Exposure to 20% CO 2 induces a strong sense of suffocation (dyspnea) that is accompanied by symptoms strongly associated with panic attacks (e.g., fear of dying, shortness of breath, cardiorespiratory response [17] ). Anxiety symptoms, such as fear and panic can lead to aversion and avoidance (e.g., phobias), and although aversion/avoidance is not specific to anxiety-associated symptoms/emotions (e.g. aversion/avoidance can be related to food that can elicit disgust) [18] . In the presence of a life threatening event, panic can occur, but following the event fear and avoidance can occur. Fear is also associated with potential imminent threats [19] .",

Similar to humans, exposing rats to mild hypercarbic gas (e.g., 7% to 7.5% CO 2 [21] ) increases respiration rate and tidal volume that reduces hypercapnia, but this concentration of CO 2 does not alter aversion-associated exploratory behaviors in an open field test (unpublished observations). However, exposing rats to higher concentrations of hypercarbic gas (e.g., normoxic, 10% to 20% CO 2 ) elicits additional components of a panic-associated response as evidenced by increases in sympathetic activity [22] , blood pressure [20, 23, 24] , anxiety-like behaviors as evidenced by increased aversion during risk versus reward conflict tests (i.e., Vogel test, open field exploration test, social interaction tests, and increases in panic/escape/flight-associated locomotor responses [20, 23, 25, 26] ), and mobilization of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis [27] [28] [29] .",

Carbon dioxide readily crosses the blood-brain barrier to directly interact with neurons and inhibits the majority of neuronal networks causing a depression in activity which leads to loss of consciousness and anesthesia with rising concentrations. Yet, there are also specialized central chemoreceptive neurons [30, 31] in medullary regions that are critical for regulating breathing following subtle changes in CO 2 /H + [11] and in panic-generating brain regions, such as the hypothalamus [32] . In fact exposing healthy rats to normoxic 20% CO 2 concentrations selectively increases cellular activity in panic and anxiety networks, such as the perifornical hypothalamus and dorsal periaqueductal gray [26] . When stimulated, these areas induce panic-associated symptoms in humans [33, 34] and panic-associated behaviors and cardioexcitation in rats [35, 36] and cats [37] . Others have proposed fear centers, such as the amygdala, as critical sites for CO 2 -induced panic in mice [38] , but panic responses to 20% CO 2 are intact in humans with bilateral loss of amygdala function [39] .",

This catheter was connected to a telemetric probe that was aseptically implanted into the peritoneal cavity. The telemetry probe also contained an internal thermistor for measuring core body temperature and is also capable of assessing general locomotor activity (Cat. no.

Thus, in a counter-balanced design all rats received one infusion of either atmospheric air or normoxic 20% CO 2 with at least 48 h between treatments. Rats were placed in a clear custom-built Plexiglass \u00ae cylindrical plethysmograph chamber where they were capable of moving (i.d. 9.5 cm, length 26 cm, wall thickness 3 mm) with atmospheric air infused at a flow rate of 2.8 L/min using a Vetamac flowmeter (Rossville, IN, USA) until a steady baseline respiration rate was noted (approximately 30 min). A plastic T-connector was inserted 20 cm away from the start of the output line and then linked to one input of a differential pressure amplifier (model 24PC01SMT, Honeywell Sensing and Control, Golden Valley, MN, USA), the second input being opened to the room air. The atmospheric infusion rate was sufficient to prevent any rise of CO 2 in the plethysmograph [20] . Radiotelemetry probes were turned on with a magnet placed near abdomen, and receivers were placed below the experimental gas infusion cages in order to acquire radiotelemetry data during procedures. All rats had infusions of the following: (1) 5 min infusion of atmospheric gas (<1% CO 2 , 21% O 2 , 78% N 2 : Praxair, Inc., Indianapolis, IN, USA) for baseline measurements; then (2) either the control gas or experimental normoxic, hypercarbic gas (20% CO 2 , 21% O 2 , 59% N 2 : Praxair, Inc., Indianapolis, IN, USA) for 5 min, and finally; (3) 5 min infusion of atmospheric gas.",

The social interaction (SI) test was done in the open field arena and is a fully validated test of experimental anxiety-like behavior in rats [20, 36] . The \"experimental\" rat and an unfamiliar \"partner\" rat are both placed in the center of the box, and the total duration (s) of non-aggressive physical contact (grooming, sniffing, crawling over and under the partner rat) initiated by the \"experimental\" rat is quantified over 5 min. Baseline social interaction was done with an unfamiliar partner rat and on the test day this was repeated with a different unfamiliar partner rat.

The recordings were scored offline by Cristian Bernabe for time duration of seizure (rapid and repeated contraction and relaxation of body muscles with uncontrolled shaking of the body), running (rapid movement within the cage), and gasping (sudden and sharp inhalation of air through the mouth) behaviors using ODLog\u2122 software (version 2.5 Macropod Software, Yarraville, Victoria, Australia). Additionally, the video recordings were used to approximate the time to loss of consciousness. In humans, loss of consciousness is associated with the inability to engage in verbal communication [1] . In animals, the loss of righting reflex is utilized [6] . This can correlate to the ataxia seen in stage I of anesthesia, but as involuntary movement can continue in stage II, where the animal is unconscious, care must be taken in evaluation of movement as an indicator of consciousness [6] . For this study, we determined that the rats had lost consciousness at the point when gross motor control was compromised. We had initially determined that the point when the rat let its nose touch the cage bottom would be the time for loss of consciousness, but this behavior was inconsistent in the groups. So, instead we considered the gross loss of motor function as the point where the rat either touched its nose to the ground or began staggering with significant ataxia. It is recognized that both of these measures are very subjective and may not be reflective of the actual state of consciousness of the animals. The video was recorded at baseline and from the initiation of the infusion of gas and was observed for 5 min or until the respiration ceased.",

For the core body temperature there was a significant gas\u02c6time interaction (F (36,204) = 6.8, p < 0.0001, Figure 2c , n = 5,5,5,6) with core body temperature beginning to decrease at 5 min post 10%, 30%, and 100% CO 2 volume per minute replacement, respectively, and significant differences as compared to atmospheric air evident at 6 and 7 min. For locomotor activity, there was no gas\u02c6time interaction (F (40,260) = 1.3, p = 0.103, Figure 2d , n = 5,5,5,6), and although an significant time effect was noted (F (20,260) = 10.4, p < 0.0001), post hoc analyses failed to detect changes from baseline. This could be due to the agitated motor activity at baseline between groups which ranged from 2-10 counts/min compared to a range of 2-6 counts/min in the baseline of Figure 1e . For MAP there was a significant difference in the gas\u02c6time interaction (F (40,260) = 1.6, p = 0.016, Figure 2e , n = 5,5,5,6). It is worth noting that baseline MAP is 130 to 145 mmHg, which is 10 to 25 mmHg above baselines seen in Figure 1a , and similar to MAP see post-normoxic 20% CO 2 exposure. Assessment of over time within subjects' effects on MAP revealed there was a significant decrease in MAP 4 min post 100% CO 2 volume displacement and this took a minute longer for the 10% and 30% CO 2 volume per minute displacement methods. The MAP for rats in the 10% CO 2 volume per minute displacement group was significantly decreased as compared to the other groups beginning around the sixth minute. For heart rate, there was a significant gas\u02c6time interaction (F (40,260) = 1.7, p = 0.004, Figure 2f , n = 5,5,5,6).

This method only increased ambient O 2 concentrations by approximately 0.2%, but rapidly increased ambient CO 2 concentrations from being undetectable to 20% to 24% during the infusions. Behavioral assessments revealed that rats experiencing the 20% CO 2 challenge had increased panic and escape or flight associated locomotor responses (from 2 counts/min to 12 counts/min) during the CO 2 challenge. This challenge also increased mean arterial blood pressure by 25 to 28 mmHg, and respiration rate by approximately 75 breath/min. At the offset of CO 2 infusions and onset of atmospheric air infusions, we noted that the rats would orient themselves so that their nose was near the gas infusion intake which coincided with an even greater increase in respiration from 150 breaths/min to almost 275 breaths/min. Following the CO 2 challenge, the rats expressed increased fear and avoidance-associated behavior (operantly defined as thigmotaxis and social avoidance, and evidenced by reduced time spent exploring center regions of an open field arena and reduced social interaction time). It is possible that CO 2 induced drowsiness that might have contributed to a decrease in the exploratory behavior in these rats, but previous work with rats that were fully anesthetized with CO 2 report that the rats regain locomotor control within 90 s and exhibit a complete clinical recovery from anesthesia within 5 min, but they exhibit antinociception for up to 60 min [42] . Environmental concentrations of CO 2 that are less than 5% do not typically induce symptoms and signs of anxiety in people [12] , though there is an increase in the respiratory activity to attempt to blow off excessive CO 2 to return the plasma CO 2 /H + to homeostasis (for review, see [9, 10] ). However, environmental concentrations of 7.5% CO 2 begin to signal air hunger and are anxiety symptom/sign provoking in humans [12] , and environmental concentrations of 20% CO 2 induce symptoms such as suffocation sensations, fear of dying, and robust cardio-respiratory responses which are all strongly associated with panic attacks [17] . These human findings are fairly consistent with a study where gradually filling a test chamber up to 10% CO 2 did not significantly alter rat behavior, but when concentrations approached 15% there was a reduced latency to leave the test chamber, and at 20% the majority of rats left immediately [43] . The relationship between CO 2 and panic attacks is further supported in that exposing patients with panic disorder to 5%-7% CO 2 will provoke panic attacks in the majority of these patients and no panic attacks in healthy controls [44] [45] [46] . Overall this provides further evidence of the aversive nature of exposure to 7.5%-20% CO 2 .",

Both reached greater than 90% within 4 min and there were minimal differences in the rate of change. However the 10% CO 2 volume per minute displacement method led to a gradual increase in ambient CO 2 concentration that was approximately 7%-20% within the first 2 min and 30% within 3 min, which suggests these rats remained in panic inducing ranges of CO 2 concentrations significantly longer than the other higher CO 2 displacement methods. All of the methods led to fairly rapid decreases in blood pressure within 4 min for 100%, and 5 min for 10% and 30%, and a decrease in heart rate within 1 min for 10% and 2 min for 30% and 100%.",

Thus, this drop in core body temperature is not just due to a cessation of metabolic and locomotor activity, but an active cooling mechanism.

            "text": "Our evaluations of CO 2 concentrations are consistent with findings that were previously reported regarding how the concentration of CO 2 changes in the chamber over time with constant volume per minute displacement flow rates [1, 49] . Of concern, when using a volume per minute displacement rate of 10%, the environmental concentrations of CO 2 reached levels associated with anxiety within 1 min of the initiation of the CO 2 flow. The concentrations of 40%-50%, which have been demonstrated to induce loss of consciousness [1, 7] , were not achieved until approximately 5 min after the initiation of the CO 2 flow. This meant that the animal would be exposed to anxiety-and panic-inducing concentrations of CO 2 , without loss of consciousness, for at least 4 min. Contrast this with the volume per minute displacement rate of 30%. In this case, the anxiety inducing threshold was also achieved within 1 min of the initiation of CO 2 flow, but the environmental concentration of CO 2 exceeded 50% approximately 2 min after the initiation of CO 2 flow. In this case, the animal would be exposed to anxiety-and panic-inducing concentrations of CO 2 , without loss of consciousness, for approximately 1 min. This interval was shortened further when a 100% volume per minute displacement flow rate was utilized. However, there is evidence that this could increase the opportunities for exposure to painful concentrations of CO 2 , where carbonic acid has increased high enough in the respiratory tract to interact with nociceptors to signal a burning sensation [8] . For example, humans inhaling air with 50%-60% CO 2 were most likely to call the experience unpleasant [50] , but inhalations of 80%-100% CO 2 were more often reported as painful with self-reports of a burning sensation and difficulty inhaling the gas [8] . Within the same manuscript, the authors exposed rats to different concentrations of CO 2 (60%, 70%, 80% and 100%) until anesthesia or euthanization occurred. They reported that the most aversive behaviors (seizures) occurred in lower concentrations of CO 2 exposure and were absent to mild with 100% CO 2 in most instances. They further noted that trauma to airways and nasal cavities occurred in these lower concentrations of CO 2 , as well, though it is not clear if the animals were conscious when the trauma occurred. Thus, the short exposure humans had to CO 2 may have led to a fast aversive response [51] , but prolonged exposure (anesthesia inducing) to lower concentrations of CO 2 could produce enough carbonic acid to elicit similar burning and pain as high concentrations of CO 2 that would likely be prolonged since time to anesthesia would be delayed, but this has not been explored. In all of these cases, it is necessary to balance the potential for pain (likely higher for a short period of time with a 100% volume per minute displacement rate) with the possibility for distress (likely higher for a prolonged period of time with a 10% volume per minute displacement rate). The lower the flow of the volume per minute displacement rate, the more time the animal would be left in concentrations of gas that are well-documented to cause anxiety and panic prior to loss of consciousness, which occurs at concentrations of 40%-50%, dependent upon equilibration of the CO 2 gas [1, 7] . This strongly suggests that while the low flow volume per minute displacement rates may minimize pain, they increase the distress experienced by the animal.",

With the available tools, defining the exact time of loss of consciousness is challenging because we lack the ability to create a clear determination of when this loss of consciousness has occurred. In humans, loss of consciousness is generally accepted to have occurred at the time when the individual is no longer able to engage in verbal communication [6] , but this definition is compounded by the fact that humans can engage in significant and appropriate verbal communication with others that is not recalled when under the effect of alcohol or drugs [52, 53] . It has been suggested that electroencephalography (EEG) can be used to assess consciousness in animals [1, 54, 55] , but as EEG measurements are present in anesthetized and sleeping animals, this assessment tool is not necessarily as specific as desired [54] [55] [56] . In animals, the loss of righting reflex is generally accepted as the marker of loss of consciousness [1, 6] , but again, pinpointing this exact moment is difficult, especially when using gaseous agents where opening the chamber to test the animal affects the concentration and distribution of the gas. If the ability to handle the animal is built into the cage (as was done in one study [57] ), this could lead to more reliable assessments of the loss of righting reflex.",

We had initially determined that the point when the rat let its nose touch the cage bottom would be the time for loss of consciousness, but this behavior was inconsistent in the groups. Instead we considered the gross loss of motor function as the point where the rat either touched its nose to the ground or began staggering with significant ataxia. It is recognized that both of these measures are very subjective and may not be reflective of the actual state of consciousness of the animals. However, it is worth noting that the interval to achieve this gross loss of motor control was significantly less than anticipated based on the measurements in the empty chamber. For example, in the empty chamber, we projected that the rat would be conscious for as long as 4-5 min when euthanized using a 10% volume pre minute displacement rate, but our behavioral data suggested that the loss of consciousness occurred closer to 1.5-2 min, though the behavioral data of the rat euthanized with a 100% volume per minute displacement rate was consistent with the predicted loss of consciousness around 25 s. Aside from the concern about the subjective definition of loss of consciousness affecting this discrepancy, it should also be noted that the presence of the animal in the chamber would create turbulence because of its movements and thermal load which could lead to better mixing of the carbon dioxide to facilitate exposure that would not be seen in the empty chamber.",

Adding oxygen to the euthanasia chamber when using carbon dioxide may not minimize distress, but may actually increase the distress experienced by the animal [1] . As demonstrated by the oxygen measurements in the empty euthanasia chamber during the infusion of CO 2 gas, the 10% volume per minute displacement rate results in a very slow loss of oxygen. Therefore, in addition to the animals being exposed to concentrations of CO 2 that are anxiety inducing, their cardiovascular and respiratory functions are kept in a manner that induces an acute air hunger, as well. In contrast, when the 30% and 100% volume per minute displacement flow rates for CO 2 are utilized, there is an acute drop off of oxygen over the first 2-3 min. This decrease in oxygen would be expected to induce a \"drowsiness\" response in the animals, further decreasing the potential for distress associated with these volume per minute displacement rates of CO 2 . Currently, this is only an observation, and a future study comparing CO 2 displacement concentrations in normoxic, hypoxic, and hyperoxic conditions would be needed to test this hypothesis.",

A typical calm rat will have a mean arterial pressure of approximately 120 mmHg and a heart rate of 360 to 380 beats per minute. Historically, our laboratory has seen mean arterial blood pressures of 140 mmHg and heart rates of 400 to 450 beats per minute during a panic episode induced by exposure to 20% CO 2 [20, 23] . In this data, the animals were all exhibiting these elevated levels during the 5 min that they were in the chamber prior to induction of the euthanasia process. This is likely explained because, in this study, rats were removed from their home cage and placed into the novel euthanasia chamber. Although it is generally recommended that animals remain in their home cage when being euthanized, it should be recognized that this practice is variable across institutions and actively discouraged during the induction of anesthesia with other inhalant gases (such as isoflurane) for survival procedures. It should also be recognized that there are often other stressors, such as the stress of transport or comingling of groups of animals, that are also frequently done at the time of euthanasia. So, although current best practices for euthanasia suggest that it is preferential to transport the home cage containing the animal to the euthanasia chamber [59] and let the animal acclimate to its new surroundings for at least 30 min prior to initiating the euthanasia procedures (as demonstrated by the first study presented here), this is not uniformly recognized.",

However, there was an increase in the mean arterial pressure of the animals that were euthanized using the 10% volume per minute displacement rate in the first 2 min following the initiation of the CO 2 gas infusion. This is suggestive of increased sympathetic activity and distress experienced by the animal. At 3 min post-induction of CO 2 , the mean arterial pressure of the rats exposed to the 100% volume per minute displacement rate of CO 2 drops below baseline, but this drop does not occur until approximately 4 min for the other two volume per minute displacement rate groups. This is likely due to the delayed onset of freezing behaviors that would be expected in the rats exposed to the lower volume per minute displacement flow rates, though these behaviors were not seen in the rats euthanized for this study.",

Although there were no significant changes in pattern between the treatment groups, the 30% and 100% CO 2 and the 10% CO 2 groups, respectively, displayed prolonged inactivity within 3 and 5 min post displacement. The significance of this drop in locomotion could be representative of a loss of consciousness, though we did not attempt to characterize loss of consciousness in this study. Loss of consciousness for humans is defined as the point where the person can no longer verbally respond, but for animals, the loss of righting reflex is generally accepted as the point of loss of consciousness [1] . However, it is challenging to determine exactly when this point occurs because different observers may determine that the animal has lost its ability to right itself at different times.",

The rats that were euthanized using the 10% volume displacement per minute rate displayed a prolonged period of gasping behavior that began around 1.5 min (when the concentration of CO 2 in the chamber would have exceeded 10%) and extended beyond 4 min (when the concentration of CO 2 in the chamber would have exceeded 40%). As other studies have demonstrated that concentrations of at least 40% CO 2 are required to induce a loss of consciousness (dependent upon chamber conditions and definition of loss of consciousness used by the study), these animals were clearly demonstrating dyspnea and distress during this period of time. The gasping behaviors demonstrated by the 30% and 100% volume displacement per minute treatment groups were similar and significantly shorter in duration.",

            "text": "Carbon dioxide anesthesia overdose is an important and appropriate method of euthanasia for laboratory rats, but refinements are necessary to ensure that the pain and distress experienced by the rat is minimized. The use of volume per minute displacement flow rates instead of precharged chambers when using carbon dioxide for euthanasia is critical to prevent the exposure of animals to noxious stimuli that can result in pain. However, the results of this study suggest that the use of very low volume per minute displacement flow rates (such as 10% volume displacement per minute) for carbon dioxide in rats has the potential to significantly increase the distress experienced by the animals. This distress is induced by the prolonged period of time that the rats are exposed to concentrations of CO 2 that are known to induce panic and anxiety and the concurrent stabilization of oxygen levels in the chamber, which is known to induce air hunger in the face of elevations of CO 2 . The elevations in mean arterial blood pressure of the rats euthanized with the 10% volume per minute displacement rate beyond the elevations that were already induced by the stress of transport and novel environment support this finding. Alternatively, the use of medium to high volume per minute displacement flow rates result in a minimizing of potential distress experienced by the rat through the shortening of the period of time that the rats are exposed to concentrations of CO 2 that are known to induce panic and anxiety and the rapid depletion of O 2 , which is known to induce a drowsiness prior to loss of consciousness. Therefore, the results of this study suggest that volume per minute displacement rates of 10% should not be used as there is increased potential exposure to pain and distress associated with prolonged exposure to panicogenic concentrations of CO 2 .",
