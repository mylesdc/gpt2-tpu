Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) M co-expression with either N or E is sufficient for producing virus-like particles (VLPs), although at a lower level compared to M, N and E co-expression. Whether E can release from cells or E/N interaction exists so as to contribute to enhanced VLP production is unknown. It also remains to be determined whether E palmitoylation or disulfide bond formation plays a role in SARS-CoV virus assembly. Results: SARS-CoV N is released from cells through an association with E protein-containing vesicles. Further analysis suggests that domains involved in E/N interaction are largely located in both carboxyl-terminal regions. Changing all three E cysteine residues to alanines did not exert negative effects on E release, E association with N, or E enhancement of VLP production, suggesting that E palmitoylation modification or disulfide bond formation is not required for SARS-CoV virus assembly. We found that removal of the last E carboxyl-terminal residue markedly affected E release, N association, and VLP incorporation, but did not significantly compromise the contribution of E to efficient VLP production.",

            "text": "Coronavirus E is a small integral membrane protein consisting of approximately 76 to 109 amino acids and containing a hydrophobic domain. Several researchers have suggested that coronavirus E functions as an ion channel [12, 13] . The role of the coronavirus E ion channel in the virus life cycle is not completely clear. The addition of hexamethylene amiloride (HMA, an ion channel inhibitor of mouse hepatitis coronavirus [MHV] and human coronavirus 229E [HCoV229E] ion channel activity in vitro) to culture medium blocks MHV and HCoV229E replication [12] , suggesting that the coronavirus E ion channel plays a role in virus replication. Two or three cysteine residues are located on the carboxyl side of the hydrophobic domain in coronavirus E proteins, with some serving as targets for palmitoylation [14] [15] [16] [17] , which may contribute to virus assembly in the MHV. E plus M has been shown to be sufficient for VLP formation in the MHV [18] , transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) [19] , bovine coronavirus (BCoV) [19] , infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) [5] , and SARS-CoV [20] . Although M and N co-expression is also sufficient for SARS-CoV VLP production [21, 22] , VLP yields are further enhanced by E co-expression [23] . According to these data, SARS-CoV E plays a supporting role in promoting virus assembly and/or budding. E and N are thought to be packaged into VLPs through separate and individual associations with M; it remains unknown whether E/N interaction exists, which might contribute to enhanced virion production. MHV and IBV E proteins are capable of release from cells as vesicles [5, 24] , implying a relationship between E release and its contribution to virus production. Our goal for this study was to determine whether SARS-CoV N is capable of interacting with E and cell release via an association with Econtaining vesicles. Our results indicate no correlation between SARS-CoV E capacity to release or interact with N, or its ability to promote VLP production.",

Since N release into medium depends on an association with M, and since E may promote VLP production, we set out to confirm whether E complements M-FLAG in N packaging into VLPs. Toward this goal we coexpressed N with M-FLAG in the absence or presence of SARS-CoV E tagged with either HA at the amino terminus (HA-E) or with FLAG at the carboxyl terminus (E-FLAG). As shown in Figure 1 , N that was barely detectable in medium became readily detected following co-expression with HA-E (lanes 9 versus 10). Since N is incapable of associating with M-FLAG, a simple explanation would be the ability of E to promote N incorporation into VLPs via E/N interaction. E-FLAG was barely HA-E denotes an HA tagged at the SARS-CoV E amino terminus. DNA (5 \u03bcg) of each plasmid was used for each transfection, with pBlueScript SK added to maintain a plasmid DNA level of 20 \u03bcg.

Lack of palmitoylation modification can markedly decrease SARS-CoV E membrane association [16] and MHV E stability [17] . Substitution mutations for cysteines-the palmitoylation targets in MHV E can reduce virus yields, implying their importance for MHV virus production [14, 17] . Accordingly, we tried to determine whether equivalent cysteines play a role in SARS-CoV E/N interaction and VLP assembly by constructing an E mutant (designated EC3A) with alanine replacements for SARS-CoV E cysteine residues C40, C43 and C44. Supernatant and cell lysate samples containing HA-E were analyzed under non-reducing conditions to confirm the presence of disulfide bonds between SARS-CoV E molecules. Results indicate the presence of an 18 kDa band (equivalent to an HA-E dimer) ( Figure 4A , lanes 2 and 11, arrowheads), which agrees with a previous report [31] . As expected, only the E monomer was detected in EC3A-containing samples under non-reducing conditions ( Figure 4A, lanes 3 and 12) .",

            "text": "While most of intracellular E retains its monomeric form, most released E was detected in dimeric form ( Figure 4A , lane 2 vs. lane 11), suggesting that released SARS-CoV E proteins are largely linked by disulfide bonds. Interestingly, EC3A was still efficiently released into medium and apparently capable of promoting N release ( Figure 4A, lanes 14  and 18) . The relatively low level of medium HA-E observed in Figure 4A is due to low expression level (top panels, lanes 17 vs. 8). Nevertheless, our data indicate that EC3A produced VLPs as efficiently as wt when co-expressed with both M and N ( Figure 4B, lanes 10-12) , suggesting that SARS-CoV E cysteines are not involved in E release, E/N interactions, or VLP assembly. EC3A exhibited greater release efficiency compared to wt, implying that SARS-CoV E cysteines are involved in the E trafficking process. However, immunofluorescence results indicate that the EC3A subcellular distribution pattern was similar to that of the wt. Removal of last amino acid residue from the E carboxyl-terminal tail significantly affects E release and E/N interaction E-FLAG was released at a lower efficiency level compared to HA-E, suggesting that the carboxyl-terminal tail domain may be involved in the E release process. We hypothesized that the E-carboxyl tail is also involved in E/N interaction. To test this idea, we constructed two E mutants: E\u039476V (with the final carboxyl-terminal residue valine removed) and E74LL/AA (with the carboxylterminal dileucine motif 74-LL-75 replaced with alanines). According to our results, (a) the E74LL/AA mutant was capable of release, and (b) a positive correlation exists between the release levels of co-expressed N and E74LL/AA ( Figure 5A, lanes 10-15) . In addition, E74LL/AA was capable of producing VLPs as efficiently as wt when co-expressed with M and N ( Figure 5A,  lanes 16 vs. 17 and 18) . These results suggest that 74-LL-75 was not functionally involved in E release, E/N interaction, or the promotion of VLP production. Conversely, E\u039476A was not capable of efficiently promoting N release, and exhibited a reduced release capacity ( Figure 5B, lanes 12 to 15) . GST pull-down assay data suggest that the E\u039476V mutation markedly affected E/N interaction, but exerted no major impacts on N/M association ( Figure 5C, lanes 16 vs. 18) . The level of GST-Nassociated E was significantly lower than that of GST-Massociated E, suggesting that E/N association is not as strong as E/M association ( Figure 5C, lanes 15 vs. 17) . While pull-down assay results suggest an association between E\u039476V and M, E\u039476V release was not significantly enhanced following M co-expression ( Figure 5C , lane 18 vs. Figure 5B, lanes 17 and 20) . A possible explanation is steric hindrance during VLP assembly. Note that E\u039476V was still capable of promoting VLP production as efficiently as the wt, despite defective packaging into VLPs ( Figure 5B, lane 20) . This suggests that the SARS-CoV E contribution to VLP production is independent of its ability to be packaged into VLPs.",

When co-expressed with EGFP-tagged N, a fraction of N co-localized with E\u039476V in the perinuclear area; this staining pattern was barely distinguishable from that of cells co-expressing HA-E and N-EGFP ( Figure 6B ).

            "text": "To our knowledge, this is the first report of interaction between SARS-CoV E and N proteins. Both SARS-CoV spike (S) and E proteins can be released into medium; however, unlike E, S cannot promote the release of coexpressed N (Figure 2A ). This suggests that N is incapable of associating with S, and supports the idea of specific E/N interaction. While RNA can enhance N/N interaction, the presence of RNA is not necessary for E/ N interaction. Genetic analyses suggest that E binding domains are largely located in the N carboxyl-terminal region (Figure 3) . SARS-CoV M or E by itself can secrete into medium as vesicles but not virus-like particles (VLPs) which can be formed by M plus N, M plus E, E plus N or M plus N and E. It is likely that there may be a combination of these different VLPs in culture medium when cells are co-transfected with M plus E and N. The iodixanol density gradient fractionation analyses suggest that released E vesicles and E-N VLPs exhibit slightly higher densities compared to those of M-E-N VLPs ( Figure 2C ). Since M is the major viral component, the strong presence of M molecules may exert a spatial effect that explains, at least in part, the lower density for M-E-N particles. We consistently observed marked E-N VLP yield enhancement following M co-expression. Since M is the most abundant viral structural protein capable of recruiting both E and N into VLPs, we do not consider this a surprising result. In addition, M exhibits a noticeably higher N binding capacity than E ( Figure 5C ). VLPs formed by M, E and N look more morphologically homogeneous than E-N VLPs, possibly due to additional intermolecular interactions between M/M, M/E and M/N. SARS-CoV E is capable of undergoing oligomerization triggered by both hydrophobic interaction and interchain disulfide bond formation between cysteine residues [16, 31] . All three SARS-CoV E cysteine residues have been shown to be post-translationally modified by palmitoylation [16] . Blocking MHV E palmitoylation results in significantly impaired VLP assembly, suggesting that palmitoylated E proteins are essential for murine coronavirus assembly [14] . In the present study we found that changing all three cysteines into alanines (EC3A) did not exert negative effects on SARS-CoV E protein release or VLP assembly (Figure 4 ). This suggests that E palmitoylation or interchain disulfide bond formation is not required for SARS-CoV E protein release or VLP assembly. Furthermore, we consistently detected higher levels of EC3A compared to wt E in medium, suggesting that EC3A is released more efficiently than wt E. One possible explanation is that post-translational palmitoylation or interchain disulfide bond formation restricts E protein secretion.",

Furthermore, E\u039476A was still capable of enhancing VLP production even though it was defective in both release and N association. Although E\u039476A is capable of M association (as shown by GST assays), it is not efficiently incorporated into VLPs when co-expressed with M. A possible explanation for this discrepancy is that the disruption of cellular compartments allows E/M to associate at a higher capacity, whereas less E/M association occurs in assembly and budding compartments such as ER/Golgi, resulting in smaller amounts of E being packaged into virions. This scenario is compatible with the proposal that E may promote virus assembly and/or budding by facilitating membrane bending and scissions without required packaging into virions. In support of this hypothesis, one research team has reported that E deletion does not significantly affect SARS-CoV replication, but that E-deleted mutants exhibit 100-to 1,000-fold reductions in virus yields associated with decreased efficiency during morphogenesis [32] . Although E/N interactions may not be directly involved in virus assembly and budding, it remains to be seen whether the SARS-CoV E contribution to virus production requires efficient E/M interaction.",

The contribution of SARS-CoV E to efficient VLP production is also independent of its release capacity, association with N, or VLP incorporation. Additional experiments are required to clarify the biological relevance of SARS-CoV E/N interaction, and to determine whether E/N interaction also exists in other coronaviruses.",

HeLa cells were co-transfected with the indicated HA-tagged wt or mutant E expression vectors plus pGolgi-ECFP, which encodes a Golgi apparatus labeling marker. (B) Co-localization of SARS-CoV E and N proteins. HeLa cells were co-transfected with SARS-CoV N bearing carboxyl-terminal tagged EGFP (N-EGFP) and HA-tagged wt or \u039476V expression vectors. At 18 h post-transfection, cells were fixed and labeled with a primary anti-HA antibody and a secondary rhodamine-conjugated anti-mouse antibody. Images represent the most prevalent phenotypes. Merged red/blue or red/green fluorescent images are shown in right-hand column panels. Mock-transfected cells failed to yield any signal (data not shown).",
