            "text": "We have previously reported that the absence of sphingosine kinase 1 (SK1) affects both dengue virus (DENV) infection and innate immune responses in vitro. Here we aimed to define SK1-dependancy of DENV-induced disease and the associated innate responses in vivo. The lack of a reliable mouse model with a fully competent interferon response for DENV infection is a challenge, and here we use an experimental model of DENV infection in the brain of immunocompetent mice. Intracranial injection of DENV-2 into C57BL/6 mice induced body weight loss and neurological symptoms which was associated with a high level of DENV RNA in the brain. Body weight loss and DENV RNA level tended to be greater in SK1 -/compared with wildtype (WT) mice. Brain infection with DENV-2 is associated with the induction of interferon-\u03b2 (IFN-\u03b2) and IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) expression including viperin, Ifi27l2a, IRF7, and CXCL10 without any significant differences between WT and SK1 -/mice. The SK2 and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) levels in the brain were unchanged by DENV infection or the lack of SK1. Histological analysis demonstrated the presence of a cellular infiltrate in DENV-infected brain with a significant increase in mRNA for CD8 but not CD4 suggesting this infiltrate is likely CD8 + but not CD4 + T-lymphocytes. This increase in T-cell infiltration was not affected by the lack of SK1. Overall, DENV-infection in the brain induces IFN and T-cell responses but does not influence the SK/S1P axis. In contrast to our observations in vitro, SK1 has no major influence on these responses following DENV-infection in the mouse brain.",

            "text": "Introduction Sphingolipids, which are an integral part of membranes in all eukaryotic cells, have been involved in a variety of cell signalling functions [1] . One of these signalling sphingolipids is sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) which has well-known critical roles in cell growth and development [2] and T-lymphocyte recruitment [3] . This latter property has drawn considerable recent attention and has led to the clinical use of S1P analogues in the treatment of diseases such as multiple sclerosis [4] . S1P is a normal metabolite produced following the phosphorylation of sphingosine by the sphingosine kinases (SKs) which can play an important role in cell signalling and inflammation [5] . For example, a recent study by Harikumar et al., showed that SK1 was required for interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-1-mediated induction of CXCL10 and CCL5 chemokines following interleukin 1 (IL-1) stimulation [6] . There are two forms of SK, designated SK1 and SK2 [7] . Both isozymes show a high degree of sequence similarity although they vary in size, catalytic properties, tissue distribution, and subcellular localisation [8] , and have been proposed to have complementing but also distinct physiological roles [1, 9] .",

Several viruses have been shown to modulate the activity or level of SK1 for efficient viral infection. For instance, bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) reduced the catalytic activity of SK1 to promote viral replication [11] . In contrast, an increase of SK1 expression and activity during human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) [12] , influenza A virus [13] , and measles virus (MV) [14] infections enhanced viral replication. Moreover, SK1 can promote viral infections through different biological mechanisms. SK1 has been shown to prolong survival of virus-infected cells [12] , and viral protein synthesis [14] . We have previously shown that SK1 activity is altered during dengue virus (DENV) infection [15, 16] , and that a reduction in SK1 affects the ability of DENV to induce interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in vitro [17] . Here, we investigated the effect of SK1 on DENV replication and the induction of ISGs using an in vivo model comprising intracranial (ic) injection of DENV.",

            "text": "DENV is a globally important human pathogen that can cause a wide spectrum of clinical presentations from a febrile illness to a life threatening infection with bleeding complications [18] . The disease severity and pathogenicity is thought to be immune-mediated in which immune responses to DENV exacerbate damage to the host [19] [20] [21] . Unlike DENVinfection in humans, DENV does not replicate well or cause symptoms reflective of human disease in immunocompetent wild type (WT) mice [22] , but can cause a similar pathology in mice deficient in the interferon (IFN) response, such as in the AG129 IFN receptor knockout mouse model [23] . Analysis of neurovirulence-the induction of symptoms of brain infection including reduction in hind limb function has been a widely used historical method to indicate the presence of virus following ic inoculation. Ic injection of DENV into WT mice, although not reflective of a natural mode of DENV-infection, is associated with DENV replication and neurological symptoms [24, 25] but additionally, may reflect some aspects of DENV-associated neurological disease in humans [26] . Although DENV does not antagonise IFN responses in mice as it does in humans [27] , in our study we utilised the DENV ic mouse infection model as a means to assess the role of SK1 in DENV infection and induction of ISGs in vivo in an immunocompetent animal. We compared virus replication and immune responses following ic injection of DENV into WT and SK1 -/mice. Our data define novel ISG and T-cell responses, and a lack of change in the SK/S1P axis in the brain following DENV infection and demonstrate that SK1 is not a key regulator of these processes in the brain.",

            "text": "To define the susceptibility of WT and SK1 -/mice to DENV-2 ic infection, we compared the growth rates and survival of mock and DENV-infected WT and SK1 -/mice. Animals were challenged by ic injection with 800 pfu/mouse DENV-2, and body weight and neurological symptoms (slow movement, hunched posture, and reduction in hind limb movement) recorded daily. Mock-infected mice did not demonstrate any loss in body weight or neurological symptoms (Fig 1A-1D) . Although there was a tendency towards a greater and earlier body weight loss in DENV-infected SK1 -/mice compared with DENV-infected WT mice, there was no significant difference in terms of the overall number of mice that lost body weight, the time of onset of body weight loss, nor the percentage of mice that lost more than 7% of body weight (Table 2) . When average body weight gain as a percentage of the initial body weight was analysed, results showed that both DENV-infected WT mice and SK1 -/mice started to lose body weight at 6 days post infection (dpi) in comparison to mock-infected mice (Fig 1A and 1C ). As expected, analysis of survival demonstrated a significantly higher mortality in DENV-infected compared to mock-infected mice (Fig 1B and 1D ). Comparison of body weight loss and survival of DENV-infected WT and SK1 -/mice support the trends in Table 2 and demonstrate that DENV-infected SK1 -/mice show a significantly greater weight loss at 7 dpi than WT mice (Fig 1E) . At this time point, 7 out of 17 WT mice (~41%) and 7 out of 13 SK1 -/mice (~54%) were sacrificed due to either excessive body weight loss and/or appearance of signs of DENV-induced neurovirulence. This is reflected by an apparent higher survival rate of WT compared to SK1 -/mice at 7 and 8 dpi, although this was not statistically significant ( Fig 1F) . These results suggest that C57BL/6 mice deficient in SK1 tend to be more susceptible to body weight loss following DENV-2 infection than their counterpart WT mice but the overall disease profile is comparable. (Fig 2A) . Eight WT or SK1 -/mice were injected ic with DENV-2 and brain tissues harvested at 3 dpi. DENV RNA levels at 3 dpi tended to be higher in SK1 -/compared with WT mice (p = 0.083), but were not significantly different ( Fig 2B) . RNA levels were also quantitated in WT and SK1 -/mice at the termination of experiments. DENV RNA level was significantly higher at day 7-8, than at 9-14 dpi in both WT and SK1 -/mice ( Fig 2C) . The sacrifice of mice at 7-8 dpi was due to symptomatic presentation and ethical termination, but those sacrificed at 9-14 dpi showed body weight loss but lacked neurological symptoms and represented an elective time for termination of the experiment. Based on the disease presentation and comparable level of DENV RNA at 7 and 8 dpi, we have considered this combined time point as 'end-stage disease'. We have indicated the 9-14 dpi animals in Figs 4-7 as half-filled symbols but excluded these animals from our statistical analysis since they did not show DENV-induced disease. It should be noted, however that the inclusion of the 9-14 dpi mice in the data set did not influence the statistical outcomes. At end-stage disease (7-8 dpi), DENV RNA levels again tended to be higher in SK1 -/mice brains in comparison to WT mice ( Fig 2C) but were not significantly different (p = 0.116). These data suggest that DENV-2 can replicate and cause body weight loss and neurological symptoms when introduced directly into the mouse brain, with a moderate but not statistically significant increase in DENV RNA in SK1 -/compared to WT mice.",

Similar to other studies of DENV ic infection, not all mice develop neurological symptoms [29, 34]. We have further shown here that symptomatic DENV-infection with body weight loss and neurological signs is positively associated with the level of DENV RNA in the brain with a lower level of DENV RNA in the brains of asymptomatic mice at 9-14 dpi. The data from these mice has been represented graphically but we have excluded these from our statistical analysis. Interestingly, these asymptomatic mice strikingly group together with lower induction of viperin compared to symptomatic mice (Fig 4B) but are interspersed with the symptomatic mice in terms of responses such as CD8+ mRNA levels ( Fig 7B) . This suggests an association of viperin with symptomatic DENV-infection in the brain, and this remains to be investigated further.",

            "text": "Mice that are deficient in SK1 showed moderately greater and earlier body weight loss and tended to have higher levels of DENV RNA following DENV-2 infection than their counterpart WT mice. Since SK1 is a pro-survival factor [35], it is possible that without SK1 mice are more prone to weight loss and growth deficiencies. Additionally, the trend towards an increase in DENV RNA in SK1 -/mice, although not statistically significant (p = 0.116), is consistent with our recent data showing enhancement of DENV-2 infection in SK1 -/primary mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF), that we demonstrated is associated with a reduced ability of DENV to induce ISGs in the absence of SK1 [17] . Thus, we assessed the SK1-dependency of the induction of ISGs in this DENV-brain infection model. We chose to analyse the mRNA level of selected important type I IFN driven ISGs: viperin [36], IRF7 [37], and CXCL10 [38] that have been described previously as antiviral factors against DENV and we have previously shown to be induced in a SK1-dependent manner in response to DENV infection in vitro [17] . Ifi27l2a was also assessed as an ISG, previously reported to be induced in the brain in response to West Nile Virus (WNV) infection [39] , and for which the response to DENV-infection has not been previously defined. At 6 dpi and end stage disease the level of IFN-\u03b2 mRNA tended to be increased. In contrast there was a more rapid (1-3 dpi) and significant induction of ISGs viperin, Ifi27l2a, IRF7 and CXCL10 that persisted until end stage disease. IFIT1 and OAS1, which are similarly anti-viral against DENV [40, 41] were also induced rapidly but were not analysed in our complete experimental set (data not shown). This is the first report of mock-infected mice. Data points representing non-symptomatic animals (9-14 dpi) are indicated by the halffilled symbols. Statistical analysis has been performed on symptomatic DENV-infected mice only (7-8 dpi), excluding n = 5 WT and n = 3 SK1 -/at 9/14 dpi. Data represent average PCR values from individual mice and normalized against GAPDH by \u0394Ct method. Statistical significance was assessed by unpaired student t-test. * = p < 0.05, ** = p < 0.005, *** = p < 0.0005, **** = p < 0.00005. WT and SK1 -/mice were ic infected with DENV, as in Fig 1 and at end stage disease, brain tissue was harvested and snap frozen or stored in TRIzol. RNA was extracted from TRIzol and lysates prepared in EB buffer from snap frozen tissue. A. SK1 mRNA was determined by qRT-PCR (left panel) and isoenzyme specific SK1 activity assay (right panel); B. SK2 mRNA was determined by qRT-PCR (left panel) and isoenzyme specific SK2 activity assay induction of these ISGs in the brain following DENV-infection and the first report of DENVinduction of Ifi27l2a. The discordance between the induction of IFN-\u03b2 and these ISGs contrasts to studies that show IFN-\u03b2 to be a major driver of neuronal ISGs response during WNV infection in the brain [42, 43] and ISGs following DENV-infection in some cells [16, 44] . This (right panel); C. S1P was quantitated in brain lysates by HPLC. n = 11 WT and n = 10 SK1 -/-DENV-infected, n = 7 WT mock and n = 4 SK1 -/mock-infected mice.

Potentially, other factors such as IFN-\u03b3 or \u03bb may be more important in this tissue [45] [46] [47] . Studies have shown the activation of microglial cells, an increase in neurological disease severity when these cells are depleted and a role for microglia in production of cytokines and chemokines such as RANTES, IFN-\u03b3, IL-6, MCP-1 and MCP5 following WT and SK1 -/mice were ic infected with DENV, as in Fig 1 and brain tissue harvested at 3 dpi and end stage disease. RNA was isolated from infected mice brain tissues and analysed by real time qRT-PCR for A. CD4 mRNA; B. CD8 mRNA.

This contrasts to our prior data from in vitro studies where embryonic fibroblasts from SK1 -/mice or cells treated with an SK1 inhibitor (SK1-I) show reduced DENV-induction of ISGs such as viperin, IFIT1 and CXCL10 [17] . Similarly, genetic deletion or chemical inhibition of SK1 reduced the IL-1 induced expression of CXCL10 [6] . This suggests that in contrast to MEF and peripheral responses, the deficiency of SK1 does not compromise the induction of ISGs in the model herein of DENV-infection of the brain. Further, that lack of a major effect of the lack of SK1 on DENV-disease suggests that similarly SK1-dependent inflammatory pathways are not involved in regulating DENV replication and pathogenicity in the brain. This contrasts to LPS [49] or ischemia-induced neuroinflammation [50] where SK1 has been shown to be present in microglia and to promote the induction of factors such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-1 and nitric oxide [49] but intriguingly a lack of SK1 exacerbates LPS induced neuroinflammation [51] . Our observed lack of influence of SK1 on DENV in the brain may be due to pathogen or stimulus specific roles for SK1 in brain inflammation or tissue specific roles for SK1, where in the brain SK2 is known to be the dominant SK isoform [52] . The brain is an immune privileged site and previous studies have also reported differences in the expression of ISGs between the brain and other tissues. For example, mRNA levels for genes such as OAS, MDA5, and STAT1 as well as ISGs IFIT1, IFIT2, and ISG15 are greater in the liver than the brain of mice [53, 54] . Studies also showed expression of ISGs vary between the different cell types within the brain itself. For example, the basal and inducible levels of OAS were lower in neurons than microglia in response to MHV infection [53] and higher levels of both basal and induced ISGs (e.g. IFIT1 and IRF7) are observed in microglia than oligodendrocytes [53, 55] . Additionally, mouse cortical neurons fail to express basal levels of ISG54 and ISG56 [56] while distinct neuronal subsets in the brain differentially express Ifi27, IRF1 and viperin that make these cells more susceptible to WNV infection [43] . Thus, although we saw no overall effect of a lack of SK1 in a whole brain extract, and in situ analysis of SK1 and ISGs in different cells of the brain may be informative.",

We demonstrated a marked cell infiltrate in DENV-infected mouse brain by H&E staining and further characterised the nature of this cellular infiltrate as CD8+ but not CD4+ T-cells by RT-PCR analysis, although we did not analyse the presence of monocytes, a cell type also known to infiltrate the brain in WNV infection [59, 60] . A prior study has shown both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells infiltration into the brain following DENV-3 challenge in C57BL/6 mice [25], or DENV-2 challenge in BALB/c mice [34] . Further, Hsieh et al. showed predominant CD8+ compared to CD4+ T cell infiltration in DENV-infected mouse brain [38] . Similarly, the infiltration of T cells has been demonstrated in mouse brains during infection with other flaviviruses. Increased CD8+ but not CD4+ mRNA levels were detected in Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV)-infected mouse brains [61] , and similarly CD8+ T-cells infiltrate WNV-infected mouse brains [62] and following ic challenge with the Alphavirus, Semliki Forest virus (SFV) [63] . In contrast, both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells have been reported in mice challenged with a WNV [60, 64] and Yellow fever (YF)-17D virus [65] . Thus, there is an overall consensus from a number of flavivirus and other virus infections in the brain that CD8+ Tcells are a major infiltrating cell type, and our data is consistent with this suggestion.",

While DENV-infection induced ISGs and CD8+Tcell infiltration, the SK/S1P axis is not affected by DENV-infection and none of these factors were significantly affected by the absence of SK1. This data has defined innate responses to DENV-infection in the brain and demonstrate that in contrast to our studies showing a role of SK1 in promoting ISG induction following DENV-infection in vitro, and other studies demonstrating a role for SK1 in non-infectious neuroinflammation, in the scenario of DENV-infection of the brain, SK1 does not play a role in these processes.
