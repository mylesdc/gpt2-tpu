Furthermore, we detected ''1H8-like'' antibodies, defined as those with amino acid-specificity similar to 1H8, in the plasma of patients with chronic HCV infection. The time course study of plasma samples from Patient H, a well-characterized case of posttransfusion hepatitis C, showed that ''1H8-like'' antibodies could be detected in a sample collected almost two years after the initial infection, thus confirming the immunogenicity of this epitope in vivo. The characterization of this neutralization epitope with a function in host entry factor CD81 interaction should enhance our understanding of antibody-mediated neutralization of HCV infections.",

More than 70% of infected people fail to clear the virus during the acute phase of the disease and become chronic carriers [1] . Liver cirrhosis, which develops in about 10 to 20% of chronically infected patients, is linked with a high risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in later life [2] . Hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related end stage liver disease is the leading reason for liver transplantation in the United States [1] . For many years, the standard therapy for hepatitis C consisted of a regimen of pegylated alpha interferon and ribavirin, but showed limited success depending on the viral genotype. This antiviral drug therapy has recently been augmented with the FDA approval of two HCV-specific protease inhibitors, boceprivir and telaprevir. The new drug combination achieved sustained virologic response rates of close to 70% in HCV genotype 1-infected patients in clinical trials [3] . While this new treatment promises a higher cure rate especially for difficultto-treat HCV genotype 1 infections, the high cost of drug therapy in general still makes this option unaffordable in developing countries. The development of a safe and effective HCV vaccine remains an important goal for the global control of HCV infections. The understanding of antibody-mediated neutralization of HCV infections thus becomes a potentially key step toward the vaccine design.",

We found that the E2 protein with an S528A substitution did not affect the binding of 1H8, nor did the CD81 binding (Figs 3D, 5B, 6B), suggesting that S528 is not absolutely required for the CD81 binding. Indeed, either S528N or S528T substitutions, which could be seen, respectively, in 42.80% and 20.84% of the HCV strains (n = 1958), did not affect the CD81 binding, although these replacements reduced the binding of 1H8 in the Western blot (Fig 6C) . These results suggest that while the binding of 1H8 is residue-specific at the position of 528, the selection of residues at the position 528 is unlikely to be crucial for the E2 protein to interact with CD81. These observations support the view that at least two sets of amino acids within this short peptide have distinguishable functions, i.e., the recognition by 1H8 or the interaction with CD81 (Table 2) . Residues Y527 and W529 were the two residues critical for both antibody and CD81 binding. Residues A524, P525, and S528 (in a residue-specific manner) were critical only for the antibody binding, but not for CD81 interaction. In contrast, T526 was required for CD81 interaction, but not for antibody 1H8 binding.

The assay cut-off was based on the A450 nm reading of the negative Figure 6 . Effect of naturally occurring variants of the E2 protein with specific residue substitutions in the linear epitope on the 1H8 binding and the CD81 interaction. (A) The residues 524-529 derived from the E2 protein of H77 strain, i.e., E2-16Fc, is indicated, which serves as a reference sequence. The bold letter shows the presence of a specific residue at that position. The hyphen indicates any possible amino acids at these positions although the residues at positions of 525, 526,527 and 529 are highly conserved among the strains ( Table 1 ). The prevalence of the strains containing a specific residue (bold letter) in the ViPR database is shown. (B) The reactivity of 1H8 to the E2 protein with an indicated substitution was determined in a Western blot analysis. The secreted forms of these E2 proteins were produced in Huh7 cells. 1H8 (1:1000 dilution) and an HRPconjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:3000 dilution) were used as the primary and secondary antibodies, respectively. The detection with anti-Fc (1:3000 dilution) was served as a control. (C) Determination of the interaction between the E2-16Fc variants and CD81-Luc in a luciferase-based binding assay. The x-axis indicates the different constructed E2-16Fc used in the assay. The y axis indicates the relative luciferase activity, representing the direct interaction between E2-16Fc and CD81-Luc. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0084346.g006 control, a SARS virus peptide. Using A450 .0.64 as the cut-off for the positive, we tested the plasma samples for their reactivity to the wild-type epitope peptide (residues 520-533) and its mutants (S528A and W529A) ( Table 3) . We found that 53 patient samples (54.08%) reacted positively to the wild-type peptide. Among these 53 wild-type peptide-reactive samples, 35 samples (35.71%) also reacted positively with the mutant S528A. 14 of these 35 samples were negative for W529A. These results demonstrated the existence of ''1H8-like'' antibodies in patients with HCV infections, thus supporting the notion that the epitope peptide is sufficiently immunogenic in stimulating the host immune system to generate ''1H8-like'' neutralizing antibodies with a fine residuespecificity.",

Three peptides, including wild-type, S528A and W529A mutants that were designed to define ''1H8-like'' specificity of the antibody, were selected for the ELISA.

Levels of ''1H8-like'' antibodies had increased significantly by days 643 and remained elevated at day 5266.

            "text": "A successful vaccine relies often on its ability to elicit neutralizing antibodies in humans. Paradoxically, during the natural course of HCV infection, neutralizing antibodies are rarely detectable at the early stage of the infection, and if detectable, these antibodies are essentially ineffective in vivo, in spite of their neutralizing activity being demonstrated in vitro [16] [17] . As a consequence, patients establish persistent HCV infections even in the presence of appreciable amounts of neutralizing antibodies [9] . Additionally, it has been observed that HCV variants that re-infect the grafted livers of transplant patients are poorly neutralized by antibodies that were present in pre-transplant plasma. In contrast, the viral variants that could no longer be detected following transplantation are efficiently neutralized [18] . These observations support the hypothesis that the profile of antibodies elicited by the virus over the natural course of a patient's HCV infection, in combination with the high mutation rate of the virus, determines the ultimate pattern of humoral immunity [9] . In the majority of cases the result is that virus-specific neutralizing antibody responses occur too late (or neutralizing antibodies are produced in insufficient amounts) to halt the infection. In line with this thinking, a comprehensive study of clinical samples collected after a single-source outbreak of hepatitis C has shown that neutralizing antibodies produced early in the infection play an important role in the clearance of HCV, thus avoiding chronicity [16] .",

These results may explain how the 1H8mediated neutralization of HCV is realized at the interface between the E2 protein and host entry factor CD81.",

            "text": "The genetic diversity of HCV has posed a great challenge to the generation of antibodies capable of neutralizing the various HCV genotypes. With at least six distinct genotypes, HCV exhibits extensive variability, particularly within the envelope genes, which differ by approximately 30% at the nucleotide level [19] [20] . Even within a single infected individual, HCV may exist as a complex population of genetically distinct variants, termed quasispecies [21] [22] . Therefore, the conserved residues in the E2 protein that are directly involved in CD81-mediated virus entry would be reasonable targets to elicit neutralizing antibodies. Antibody blocking experiments have indeed shown that several regions of the E2 protein are critical for CD81 binding [6, [23] [24] [25] [26] . However, because some of the antibodies used in these experiments are conformation-sensitive, it is difficult to confirm whether some of the observed inhibitory effects on the interaction between the E2 protein and CD81 resulted directly from blocking the CD81 binding site of the E2 protein or from antibody-mediated steric hindrance. Despite this difficulty, the majority of the broadly neutralizing conformation-sensitive antibodies reported so far, including those isolated from humans, appear to recognize highly conserved E2 residues, such as W420, Y527, W529, G530, and D535, that are critical for CD81 binding [23] [24] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] . In particular, substitutions at positions 523 and 530 with alanine showed that these two residues, while being a part of the CD81 binding site of the E2 [27] , were also important for the neutralization of HCV by several antibodies [32] . Our observation is consistent with previous findings by others who used human monoclonal antibodies and determined that the two conserved residues Y527 and W529 are the antibody contacts of the conformational epitope and are important for the CD81-E2 interaction [27] [28] [29] [30] . In addition, we further demonstrated that naturally occurring amino acid variations appeared in this linear epitope, such as valine at position 524, and asparagine or threonine at position 528 of the E2 protein may represent a potential mechanism for HCV to escape the 1H8-mediated neutralization. Selectively incorporating certain highly conserved residues, such as Y527 and W529, into this short linear epitope of 1H8, as previously suggested by others and confirmed by us in this study, while taking the variant residues, e.g., V524 and N528 or T528, into consideration for their escape potential, might be worthwhile to explore in order to advance the discovery of an immunogen that will effectively produce neutralizing antibodies against HCV infections.",

We speculate that the tertiary structure of viral proteins presented on the surface of the virion, because of the interaction between E1 and E2 as heterodimers, for instance, may prevent the exposure of critical residues necessary for ''1H8-like'' antibody production in the early phase of infection. Another possibility is that escape variants may be rapidly accumulating in patients at the acute phase of HCV infection which could lead to the failure of any antibody response directed at this epitope. According to our model, some HCV variants, irrelevant to their genotypes, may be able to escape from ''1H8-like'' antibodymediated neutralization during the course of natural infections, if the substituted residues in the E2 protein, as changes of alanine to valine at position 524, and serine to asparagine or threonine at position 528, are associated only with antibody recognition without affecting E2-CD81 interaction. We plan to perform a series of experiments in an animal model to systematically investigate if the antibodies elicited after immunization with peptides containing specific substitutions could affect the infectivity of the virus and the breadth of ''1H8-like'' antibody-mediated neutralization.

(A) A schematic diagram of the wild-type HCV E2 protein (based on the H77 strain sequence) and its truncated forms that were used in this study. (B) A Western blot analysis was performed to determine the reactivity of mAb 1H8 with the proteins indicated. The secreted forms of these E2 proteins were produced after transient transfection of Huh7 cells. For the Western blots, 1H8 (1:1000 dilution) and an HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:3000 dilution) were used as the primary and secondary antibodies, respectively. (C) Site-directed mutagenesis of the E2-16Fc construct was performed to determine the key residues for the binding of 1H8. The residues at positions 525, 526, 527, 528 and 529 were replaced by alanine one at a time. At position 524, the alanine was replaced by a glycine. A hyphen indicates an amino acid that is identical to that of the H77 strain sequence.
