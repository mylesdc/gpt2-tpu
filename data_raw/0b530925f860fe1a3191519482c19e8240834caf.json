            "text": "Influenza infection and pneumonia are known to cause much of their mortality by inducing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is the most severe form of acute lung injury (ALI). Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is a negative regulator of angiotensin II in the renin-angiotensin system, has been reported to have a crucial role in ALI. Downregulation of ACE2 is always associated with the ALI or ARDS induced by avian influenza virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus and sepsis. However, the molecular mechanism of the decreased expression of ACE2 in ALI is unclear. Here we show that avian influenza virus H5N1 induced the upregulation of miR-200c-3p, which was then demonstrated to target the 3\u2032-untranslated region of ACE2. Then, we found that nonstructural protein 1 and viral RNA of H5N1 contributed to the induction of miR-200c-3p during viral infection. Additionally, the synthetic analog of viral double-stranded RNA (poly (I:C)), bacterial lipopolysaccharide and lipoteichoic acid can all markedly increase the expression of miR-200c-3p in a nuclear factor-\u03baB-dependent manner. Furthermore, markedly elevated plasma levels of miR-200c-3p were observed in severe pneumonia patients. The inhibition of miR-200c-3p ameliorated the ALI induced by H5N1 virus infection in vivo, indicating a potential therapeutic target. Therefore, we identify a shared mechanism of viral and bacterial lung infection-induced ALI/ARDS via nuclear factor-\u03baB-dependent upregulation of miR-200c-3p to reduce ACE2 levels, which leads increased angiotensin II levels and subsequently causes lung injury.",

The ALI caused by influenza infection can facilitate bacterial superinfection, which is a major factor that promotes mortality and disease severity [3] . From 2003 to 2016, highly pathogenic avian H5N1 influenza virus has caused 856 human infection cases worldwide with a high mortality rate of 52.8% (http://101.96.8.164/www. who.int/entity/influenza/human_animal_interface/2017_ 01_16_tableH5N1.pdf). Currently, China is undergoing its fifth epidemic of human infections of avian H7N9 influenza virus. Until 16 January 2017, 918 H7N9infected human cases with at least 359 deaths have been reported to World Health Organization (http://101. 96.8.165/www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_inter face/Influenza_Summary_IRA_HA_interface_01_16_ 2017_FINAL.pdf?ua = 1). With high mutation and reassortment rates, influenza viruses have evolved with a rapid resistance to the current vaccines and anti-viral drugs, making an avian influenza pandemic an urgent unresolved threat to human health [4] [5] [6] .",

Reduced expression levels of ACE2 have been reported in hypertension and chronic kidney disease [13, 14] . In addition, ACE2 was identified as a key regulator of dietary amino-acid homeostasis and gut microbial ecology [15] . We previously demonstrated that ACE2 counteracts the development of severe ALI or ARDS induced by avian influenza virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus spikes, sepsis and acid aspiration in mice [16] [17] [18] . Administration of recombinant ACE2 or the Ang II receptor blocker losartan can ameliorate H5N1 virus infection-induced ALI [16, 19] . Moreover, ACE2 was also reported to have a protective role in respiratory syncytial virus-induced lung injury [20] . Notably, plasma Ang II levels can indicate disease severity in H7N9 infections [21] . Downregulation of ACE2 appears to be a shared phenomenon in ALI or ARDS induced by viral or bacterial infection [18, [22] [23] [24] [25] .",

            "text": "Interestingly, the H5N1-induced expression of miR-200c-3p and miR-141-3p was highly correlated with both cell viability (Figure 1d and f) and viral replication (Figure 1e and g) . However, the expression of neither miR-200c-5p nor miR-141-5p was correlated with cell viability or viral replication (Supplementary Figure S1g and h) . Then, we tested the effect of the different multiplicity of infection (MOI) on the expression of miR-200c-3p and miR-141-3p. A549 cells were challenged with H5N1 virus at different viral titers (MOI = 0.05, 0.5 and 5), and the expression of miR-200c-3p and miR-141-3p was detected. The larger the infective dose administered, the higher the expression of miR-200c-3p and miR-141-3p (Supplementary Figure S1i) . Successful viral infection was confirmed by detecting the expression of matrix protein 1 (M1) (Supplementary Figure S1j) decreased the abundance of ACE2 protein, whereas miR-200c-3p inhibitors increased it ( Figure 2a ). However, we did not observe any significant change of ACE2 expression in the group transfected with miR-141-3p mimics or inhibitors. Previously, miR-141-3p has been reported to regulate tumor growth factor-\u03b22 by targeting its transcript during H5N1 infection [32] . To demonstrate the interaction between miR-200c-3p and ACE2 transcripts, we constructed a reporter vector in which the 3\u2032-UTR of ACE2 was fused downstream of Renilla luciferase coding sequence (Supplementary Figure S2a) . In HEK293T cells transfected with miR-200c-3p mimics rather than miR-200c-5p mimics, Renilla luciferase activity significantly decreased (Figure 2b ). Successful transfection of miR-200c-3p mimics and miR-200c-5p mimics was confirmed by qRT-PCR (Supplementary Figure S2b) . Additionally, the activity was inhibited by miR-200c-3p mimics in a concentration-dependent manner (Supplementary Figure S2c) . When the predicted miR-200c-3p binding site on ACE2 3\u2032-UTR was deleted, the inhibiting effects of miR-200c-3p mimics on the luciferase activity were diminished ( Figure 2c ). Moreover, mutation of the site on miR-200c-3p binding to ACE2 3\u2032-UTR abolished the inhibiting effects of miR-200c-3p on Renilla luciferase activity (Supplementary Figure S2d) . Taken together, these results indicate that miR-200c-3p, rather than miR-200c-5p and miR-141-3p, directly targets the 3\u2032-UTR of ACE2 and downregulates the expression of ACE2 protein.",

In HEK293T cells transfected with NS1 expressing vector, the upregulation of miR-200c-3p and miR-141-3p was observed ( Figure 2d and Supplementary Figure S3a ). In addition, M1 and NP also induced the upregulation of miR-200c-3p. However, NS1 induced a much higher level of miR-200c-3p than M1 and NP. Therefore, in the subsequent experiments, we focused on the function of NS1. Compared with the NS1 of H1N1 virus, the NS1 of H5N1 and H7N9 viruses induced much higher expression of miR-200c-3p and miR-141-3p ( Figure 2e and Supplementary Figure S3b ). However, NS1 of neither H5N1 nor H7N9 caused any significant change of the expression of miR-421 (Supplementary Figure S3c ). Transfection of H5N1-NS1 and H7N9-NS1 expression vectors into HEK293T cells resulted in the downregulation of ACE2 protein levels ( Figure 2f ). Our results suggest that NS1 of pathogenic avian influenza virus has an important role in the induction of miR-200c-3p and miR-141-3p.",

            "text": "To examine whether the induction of miR-200c-3p to downregulate ACE2 is a specific mechanism of pathogenic avian influenza viruses, we challenged A549 cells with poly (I:C). miR-200c-3p was upregulated in a concentration-dependent manner in poly (I:C)-transfected A549 cells (Figure 3a ). In addition, transfection of poly (I:C) also resulted in the downregulation of ACE2 protein expression, which was rescued by the transfection of inhibitors of miR-200c-3p (Figure 3d ), indicating that downregulating ACE2 protein expression by miR-200c-3p may be a shared mechanism for RNA viruses. Induction of interleukin-6, interleukin-29 and interferon-\u03b2 by poly (I:C) was confirmed by qRT-PCR analysis (Supplementary Figure S4a ). Previous studies have reported that LPS, which is the major constituent of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, can induce the downregulation of ACE2 and the upregulation of Ang II [33, 34] . However, the mechanisms are still unclear. By exposing A549 and THP1 cells (human acute monocytic leukemia cell line) to LPS, we found that Viruses and bacteria are usually the precipitating factors of severe pneumonia, which may induce severe respiratory failure by triggering ARDS [35, 36] , a clinical syndrome characterized by pulmonary edema, hypoxemia and the accumulation of inflammatory cells [1] . ARDS has a high mortality rate of 30-50%, thus demanding accurate prediction models [37, 38] . Because H5N1 virus, poly (I:C), LPS and LTA can all induce the expression of miR-200c-3p to downregulate ACE2 protein expression, we speculate that the expression of miR-200c-3p may be aberrant in severe pneumonia infection. To investigate whether miR-200c-3p is involved in severe pneumonia infection, we collected plasma from 56 severe pneumonia patients and 21 healthy volunteers and then detected the expression of miR-200c-3p in the plasma. The characteristics of the study subjects are shown in Supplementary Table S1 . Of the 56 patients, 53 (94.64%) fulfilled ARDS criteria [39] . In accordance with our speculation, the plasma levels of miR-200c-3p were significantly elevated in severe pneumonia patients (Figure 3g ). Downregulation of ACE2 may result in the elevated plasma level of Ang II, which is a major substrate of ACE2. Additionally, Ang II is claimed considerably increased in ARDS patients [40] . Consistent with this report, the plasma levels of Ang II were also markedly upregulated in severe pneumonia patients (Figure 3h ). Notably, the plasma level of Ang II changed over miR-200c-3p in severe pneumonia patient (patient 48th) whose plasma samples were consecutively collected (Figure 3i ), suggesting that miR-200c-3p may participate in the upregulation of plasma Ang II and then induces lung injury through Ang II type 1 receptor. Consequently, our results raise the possibility that miR-200c-3p can serve as a biomarker or therapeutic target for severe pneumonia.",

It is well known that the activation of NF-\u03baB signaling is essential in H5N1 infection and propagation [46] [47] [48] . Disabling the function of NF-\u03baB heterodimer with small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) (si-p65 and si-p50) or its specific inhibitors, caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) and JSH-23, we found that the induction of miR-200c-3p by H5N1 infection was significantly repressed (Figure 4a and b and Supplementary Figure S6a ). Considering that NS1 was reported to inhibit NF-\u03baB activation, we proposed that there is an NF-\u03baB-dependent manner for influenza virus to induce the expression of miR-200c-3p besides NS1-mediated induction of miR-200c-3p [49] .

H5N1 virus infection results in lung edema, inflammatory cellular infiltration and lung injury in mice [53] . Our results showed that the expression of miR-200c-3p in the lung tissue of H5N1infected mice was also markedly upregulated ( Figure 5a) . Previously, we reported that the expression of ACE2 protein was downregulated in H5N1-infected mouse lung tissue [16] . As inhibition of miR-200c-3p resulted in recovery of ACE2 protein level in H5N1-infected A549 cells, miR-200c-3p may be a therapeutic target for H5N1-infected mice. In fact, administration of miR-200c-3p antagomir (24 h before, 6 and 24 h after infection, intraperitoneally 10 mg kg \u2212 1 ) indeed improved wet-to-dry lung tissue weight ratio, which indicates the degree of lung edema (Figure 5b) . In mice administered with miR-200c-3p antagomir, lung injury scores (including alveolar wall thickening, hyaline membranes formatting and airspaces filling with proteinaceous debris) [54] were decreased, and inflammatory cell infiltration was alleviated (Figure 5c Figure S7c) . Administration of miR-200c-3p antagomir also resulted in the recovery of ACE2 protein level in the lung tissue (Figure 5f ). Accordingly, treatment with miR-200c-3p antagomir markedly reduced the plasma level of Ang II of H5N1-infected mice as well (Figure 5g ). In summary, our data demonstrated that inhibiting the function of miR-200c-3p improves lung injury and ARDS induced by H5N1 virus infection, rendering miR-200c-3p as a potential therapeutic target.",

            "text": "Our previous studies have demonstrated that ACE2 protects mice against ALI induced by severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus spikes, acid aspiration, sepsis and avian influenza virus [16, 18] . In this study, we showed that avian influenza virus, poly (I:C), bacterial LPS and LTA use a similar approach to reduce ACE2 level: the elevated miR-200c-3p directly downregulates ACE2 expression. Moreover, plasma levels of miR-200c-3p and its downstream effector Ang II were significantly elevated in severe pneumonia patients. While NS1 was reported to inhibit the activation of NF-\u03baB, it is a matter of common observation that NF-\u03baB signaling pathway is still significantly activated upon H5N1 virus infection and multiple NF-\u03baB-dependent genes are expressed [46] [47] [48] [49] . Interestingly, here we found that pathogenic avian influenza virus can induce the upregulation of miR-200c-3p through both the expression of NS1 protein and the accumulation of vRNA ( Figure 6 ). NS1 is a multifunctional protein that interacts with more than 50 proteins to regulate innate immune pathways, splicing and mRNA export [57, 58] . Unlike NS1 of human pandemic H1N1/2009, NS1 of avian highly pathogenic H5N1 effectively inhibits the polyadenylation of cellular pre-mRNA in A549 cells [59] . Batista et al. [60] have shown that the transcription of miR-200c/141 can be induced by the bypass of the usual PTPN6 polyadenylation. NS1 of pathogenic avian influenza viruses may induce the expression of miR-200c-3p and miR-141-3p by bypassing the usual PTPN6 polyadenylation, which needed to be further investigated. Moreover, a study has reported that NA protein of influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1, PR8) can downregulate ACE2 [61] ; therefore, whether NA of H5N1 and H7N9 viruses can downregulate ACE2 requires further investigation.",

However, the detailed molecular mechanism needs to be further investigated. The expression levels of miR-200c-3p have been found to be markedly upregulated in the livers of hepatocellular carcinoma patients [64] . Among these patients, nine patients were diagnosed with HBV infection and five patients were diagnosed with HCV infection, thus suggesting that HBV and HCV infection may induce the expression of miR-200c-3p.

In poly (I:C)treated cells, another miRNA previously reported targeting to ACE2 gene, miR-421, was measured slightly upregulated, whereas in LPS-and LTA-treated A549 cells, no significant changes of miR-421 were observed(Figure 3a-c). Induction of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, interleukin-6 and interleukin-1\u03b2 by LPS and LTA in A549 and THP1 cells were confirmed by qRT-PCR analysis (SupplementaryFigure S4band c and SupplementaryFigure S5eand f).

Interestingly, we found that transfection of H5N1-vRNA significantly elevated the expression level of miR-200c-3p compared with transfection of RNA extracted from AF-treated cells (SupplementaryFigure S6b). In addition, repressing the function of NF-\u03baB heterodimer with siRNAs (si-p65 or si-p50) or its specific inhibitors (CAPE and JSH-23) also resulted in the inhibition of the upregulation of miR-200c-3p induced by H5N1-vRNA transfection(Figure 4cand d and SupplementaryFigure S6c), suggesting that H5N1-vRNA-induced expression of miR-200c-3p requires NF-\u03baB activation.Previous studies have established that NF-\u03baB signaling activation is crucial in cellular responses to stimuli such as poly (I:C), LPS and LTA[50][51][52]. To assess whether the induction of miR-200c-3p by poly (I:C), LPS and LTA is also mediated by NF-\u03baB signaling pathway, we again disabled the function of NF-\u03baB heterodimer by using siRNAs or its specific inhibitors. Knockdown of p65 and p50 significantly repressed the upregulation of miR-200c-3p induced by the treatment of poly (I:C), LPS or LTA (Figure 4e,g and i and Supplementary Figure S6d, e and f). In addition, pretreatment with CAPE or JSH-23 also blocked the induction of miR-200c-3p in cells treated with poly (I:C), LPS or LTA (Figure 4f,h and j). The knockdown efficiency of siRNAs on p65 and p50 gene expression was validated by qRT-PCR (Supplementary",
