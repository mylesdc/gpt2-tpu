Human RVFV infections generally manifest as self-limiting and non-fatal illnesses. However, a small percentage of patients develop encephalitis, vision loss and hemorrhagic fever with a high mortality rate. Currently, there is no commercially available vaccine for human use or effective antiviral drug for RVFV treatment. The non-structural protein NSs is a major virulence factor of RVFV, which mediates suppression of host general transcription, inhibition of IFN-\u03b2 transcription and degradation of PKR, to block host antiviral responses. To examine the contribution of host transcription inhibition to RVFV virulence, we generated RVFV MP-12 strain-derived mutants that have attenuated inhibitory activity on host transcription due to amino acid mutations in NSs. The mutant viruses showed attenuated cytotoxicity in cell culture and attenuated virulence in young mice, demonstrating the contribution of NSs-mediated host transcription inhibition to the virulence of RVFV.",

RVFV NSs protein, a nonstructural protein, is a major virulence factor that exhibits several important biological properties. These include suppression of general transcription, inhibition of IFN-\u03b2 promoter induction and degradation of doublestranded RNA-dependent protein kinase R. Although each of these biological functions of NSs are considered important for countering the antiviral response in the host, the individual contributions of these functions towards RVFV virulence remains unclear. To examine this, we generated two RVFV MP-12 strain-derived mutant viruses. Each carried mutations in NSs that specifically targeted its general transcription inhibition function without affecting its ability to degrade PKR and inhibit IFN-\u03b2 promoter induction, through its interaction with Sin3-associated protein 30, a part of the repressor complex at the IFN-\u03b2 promoter. Using these mutant viruses, we have dissected the transcription inhibition function of NSs and examined its importance in RVFV virulence. Both NSs mutant viruses exhibited a differentially impaired ability to inhibit host transcription when compared with MP-12. It has been reported that NSs suppresses general transcription by interfering with the formation of the transcription factor IIH complex, through the degradation of the p62 subunit and sequestration of the p44 subunit. Our study results lead us to suggest that the ability of NSs to induce p62 degradation is the major contributor to its general transcription inhibition property, whereas its interaction with p44 may not play a significant role in this function. Importantly, RVFV MP-12-NSs mutant viruses with an impaired general transcription inhibition function showed a reduced cytotoxicity in cell culture and attenuated virulence in young mice,",

In the nucleus, NSs forms filament-like structures by self-dimerization through its C-terminal domain [10] . RVFV NSs protein is a major virus virulence factor and has various important biological functions, which are important for countering the host antiviral response. One of the NSs functions is suppression of IFN-\u03b2 mRNA transcription. NSs binds to Sin3-associated protein 30 (SAP30), a subunit of a corepressor complex, and maintains IFN-\u03b2 promoter in a transcriptionally silent state, leading to suppression of IFN-\u03b2 mRNA transcription [11] . In addition to the specific inhibition of IFN-\u03b2 transcription, NSs suppresses general transcription; it has been proposed that NSs exerts suppression of general transcription by interacting with subunits of transcription factor II H (TFIIH) complex, p44 and p62 [12, 13] . A recent study showed that the NSs-mediated general transcription inhibition contributes to the inhibition of IFN-\u03b2 mRNA transcription [14] . Although NSs-mediated transcription suppression has been considered to be important in suppressing the host antiviral response, the exact effects of the NSs-mediated general transcription inhibition on virus virulence have not been defined. NSs promotes the degradation of doublestranded RNA-dependent protein kinase R (PKR), an antiviral IFN-stimulated gene product, through a proteasome pathway to prevent phosphorylation of eIF2-\u03b1 triggered by RVFV infection [15] [16] [17] [18] . Furthermore, NSs contributes to cellular stress responses such as an increase in reactive oxygen species, activation of DNA damage signaling, cell cycle arrest, and activation of the p53 signaling pathway [19] [20] [21] [22] . Although how NSs induces the cellular stresses remains largely unknown, these stress responses may contribute to RVFV-induced cell death.",

Hence, it has been challenging to generate NSs mutants that lack a specific biological function but retain its other functions. The lack of these NSs mutants has prevented a detailed mechanistic analysis of each biological function of the NSs. In this study, we generated two RVFV mutants, each carrying mutations in NSs, that specifically targeted its general transcription inhibition function, to delineate the mechanism of its inhibition by NSs.

To obtain virus variants, carrying mutations that can compensate for this deficiency, we serially passaged this mutant virus in type I IFN-incompetent Vero E6 cells; the virus inoculum, used for each passage, was diluted 10 times and the released viruses were harvested at 4 days p.i. The titer of the mutant virus progressively increased with each passage; at passage 18, the virus titer was 2.9 x 10 6 PFU/ml, which was 2 logs higher than the initial titer of 2.0 x 10 4 PFU/ml prior to the serial passage. We isolated 34 plaque-cloned viruses from passage level 18, and 28 had a large deletion in the NSs gene in the S segment, whereas 6 plaque-cloned viruses retained the full-length NSs gene. We determined the full genome sequence of 5 clones that retained the full-length NSs gene and found that all of the isolated viruses had several mutations in the L, M, and S segments. Table 1 shows mutations found in the NSs genes of 5 plaque-cloned viruses and the uncloned passage 18 virus. All five plaque-cloned viruses and the passage 18 virus had an amino-acid substitution at position 250, including M250K or M250T mutations. Two plaque-cloned viruses and the passage 18 virus had a D100G substitution. Other mutations found in plaque-cloned viruses were R16H and A75E. Although K202N mutation was found in the uncloned passage 18 virus sample, this mutation was absent in the plaque-cloned viruses. To test whether the mutations affect NSs functions, we generated MP-12-based mutant viruses, each carrying R16H, R16H+M250K (NSs-R16H/M250K), A75E, D100G, D100G+M250T, M250K (NSs-M250K), or M250T mutations in the NSs, by using a reverse genetics system [24] . Accumulations of NSs protein in VeroE6 cells infected with MP-12 carrying the D100G mutation or the D100G+M250T mutations were significantly lower than those in MP-12 infected cells (Fig 1) , indicating that the D100G mutation affected efficient NSs accumulation. Due to the poor accumulation of NSs, we excluded the MP-12 mutant carrying the D100G mutation and that carrying the D100G+M250T mutation from subsequent analysis. In cells infected with the other mutants, levels of NSs protein accumulation were similar to that in MP-12 infected cells. In this study, we refer to MP-12 NSs as wild type NSs (wt NSs).",

Mock-infected cells alone, as well as those treated with ActD, and MP-12-infected cells and cells infected with MP-12\u0394NSs, which lacks the NSs gene [24] , served as controls. 5EU-labeled RNA, which was detected as a fluorescence signal, was mainly observed in the nucleus but not in the cytoplasm, indicating that viral RNA synthesis, which occurs exclusively in the cytoplasm, was not very active at 16h post infection. As shown in Fig 2A, strong signals of fluorescent-labeled RNA were observed in the nucleus of mock-infected cells and MP-12\u0394NSsinfected cells, demonstrating active host RNA synthesis. In contrast, ActD-treated cells showed very weak fluorescent signals, demonstrating ActD-mediated host transcriptional shut-off. MP-12-infected cells showed weaker fluorescent signals in the nucleus, compared with those in MP-12\u0394NSs-infected cells, demonstrating an inhibition of host transcription by NSs. Fluorescent intensity observed in cells infected with virus carrying mutation M250T, R16H or A75E in NSs was similar to that in MP-12-infected cells, suggesting that host transcription was still inhibited by these NSs mutants. In contrast, cells infected with MP-12 carrying NSs-R16H/ We next used flow cytometry analysis to quantitatively measure the levels of 5EU-labeled RNAs in MP-12-M250K-infected cells and in MP-12-R16H/M250K-infected cells. We used the same controls as described above. Fig 2B shows the results using density plots, wherein 5EU incorporation and N protein levels are shown on the X and Y axes, respectively. In mockinfected and ActD-treated samples, most of the cells were found in quadrant 3 (Q3) and Q4, respectively, demonstrating active host transcription in the former, but not in the latter ( Fig  2B-a and 2B-b) . In all infected samples, 86.8-93.4% of cells were RVFV N protein positive (Q1+Q2), demonstrating that most of the cells were infected. The level of 5EU-labeled RNA in MP-12\u0394NSs-infected cells was similar to that in mock-infected cells, demonstrating similar RNA synthesis activity in these two samples (Fig 2B-a and 2B-f ). MP-12-infected cells showed lower levels of 5EU-labeled RNA compared with those in MP-12\u0394NSs infected cells, demonstrating its lower RNA transcription activity (Fig 2B-c and 2B-f ). MP-12-R16H/M250Kinfected and MP-12\u0394NSs-infected cells showed similar density plot patterns, suggesting to us that host transcription inhibition did not occur in MP-12-R16H/M250K-infected cells (Fig 2B- e and 2B-f). MP-12-M250K-infected cells showed lower levels of 5EU-labeled RNA compared with those in MP-12\u0394NSs-infected cells (Fig 2B-d and 2B-f) . However, the percentage of MP-12-M250K-infected cells with low transcription activity was 43.0% (Q1/Q1+Q2), while in the MP-12 samples, it was 56.6%. These results suggested that MP-12-M250K replication suppressed host general transcription, and yet the inhibitory activity of MP-12-M250K was weaker than that of MP-12.",

To investigate the ability of MP-12-R16H/M250K or MP-12-M250K to suppress IFN-\u03b2 mRNA transcription, we examined the levels of IFN-\u03b2 mRNA in MRC-5 cells infected with MP-12, MP-12-\u0394NSs, MP-12-M250K or MP-12-R16H/250K at various times p.i.

In contrast, low levels of IFN-\u03b2 mRNA accumulation occurred in MP-12-R16H/M250K-infected cells, demonstrating that the NSs-R16H/M250K was unable to efficiently inhibit IFN-\u03b2 mRNA transcription. MP-12-M250K replicated as efficiently as did MP-12 in MRC-5 cells, whereas the virus titer of MP-12\u0394NSs was significantly lower than that of MP-12 at 72 h p.i.

Although MP-12-R16H/M250K replicated better than MP-12\u0394NSs, it replicated less efficiently MP-12-R16H/M250K-Flag). Cells, transiently expressing a V5-tagged SAP30, were infected with these viruses, and the co-localization of the mutated NSs protein with SAP30 was examined by fluorescence microscopy analysis. Like wt NSs, both NSs mutants formed filament-like structures in the nucleus (Fig 5C) . The expressed SAP30 was mainly observed in the nucleus and was co-localized with wt NSs and both mutated NSs in the filaments. We also performed co-immunoprecipitation analysis to examine NSs-SAP30 interaction. As a negative control, V5-tagged Venus was expressed in place of V5-tagged SAP30. Anti-V5 antibody co-precipitated wt NSs and both NSs mutants along with V5-tagged SAP30, while the amounts of NSs-M250K that were co-immunoprecipitated with SAP30 were lower than those of wt NSs ( Fig  5D) . Anti-V5 antibody did not co-precipitate wt NSs along with V5-tagged Venus (Fig 5D) . These data demonstrate that both NSs mutants bound to SAP30 in infected cells.",

Consistent with the data obtained from infected cells (Fig 2) , NSs-R16H/M250K expression did not inhibit luciferase activity, whereas NSs-M250K expression moderately inhibited the luciferase activity. Western blot analysis of nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions from virus-infected cells showed that like wt NSs, NSs-R16H/M250 and NSs-M250K were also distributed in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm (S1 Fig) , demonstrating that these mutations did not affect the subcellular localization of NSs.",

The NSs-mediated inhibition of type I IFN production is thought to contribute to the virulence of the virus, yet it remains unclear whether the general transcription suppression function of NSs contributes to this virulence. We examined the importance of the NSs-mediated transcription inhibition in RVFV virulence by using a young mouse model. Although MP-12 is known as an attenuated strain, the intraperitoneal inoculation of 10 4 PFU of MP-12 into 18-day-old CD1 mice resulted in the death of 55% of the mice within 13 days p.i. (Fig 7) . Under the same experimental conditions, none of the MP-12-R16H/M250K-inoculated mice and 20% of the MP-12-M250K-inoculated mice died. No obvious clinical signs, including neurological symptoms, were observed. These data demonstrated that the MP-12-R16H/M250K lacked virulence, and MP-12-M250K was less virulent than MP-12 in this young mouse model. ",

            "text": "In this study, we demonstrated that the M250K and R16H/M250K mutations in NSs differentially reduced its inhibitory activity on host transcription without affecting its ability to inhibit IFN-\u03b2 transcription, through its interaction with SAP30, and induced PKR degradation. NSs-R16H/M250K, which completely lacked the activity to inhibit general transcription, correspondingly lost the ability to promote the degradation of p62. Unexpectedly, NSs-R16H/ M250K was able to interact with FBOX3 and p62 (Fig 6) . These data possibly suggest that the FBXO3-NSs-p62 interaction may not be sufficient to trigger p62 degradation. NSs-M250K exhibited a partially reduced activity to inhibit general transcription. The results of co-immunoprecipitation assays showed that a reduced amount of NSs-M250K co-precipitated with SAP30, p62 and p44, compared with that in wt NSs (Figs 5 and 6 ). However, the slightly impaired ability of NSs-M250K to inhibit general transcription could not be solely attributed to the lower binding efficiency of NSs-M250K to p44 because NSs-M250K efficiently suppressed IFN-\u03b2 transcription and induced p62 degradation, despite its lower efficiency of binding to SAP30 and p62. Moreover, NSs-R16H/M250K, which lacked transcription suppression activity, efficiently interacted with p44 ( Fig 6) . These data bring into question the importance of NSs-p44 interaction for its host transcriptional shut-off function. One possibility is that the NSs-p44 interaction may only make a modest contribution towards its transcription inhibition activity and possibly could have additional, as yet unidentified, biological function(s). A second possibility is that only wt NSs, but not the mutated NSs, is able to interfere with the formation of an active TFIIH complex. NSs competes with XPD for binding to p44, resulting in inhibition of the TFIIH complex formation [12] . Although both NSs-M250K and NSs-R16H/M250K retained the ability to bind to p44, it is possible that the binding of these mutated NSs to p44 did not exclude the binding of XPD. The R16H single mutation did not affect the ability of NSs to inhibit transcription (Fig 2) . Although the M250K mutation is in close proximity to the \u2126XaV motif located at the C-terminal region of NSs, which is essential for p62 degradation [32] , MP-12-M250K still retained the ability to degrade p62 (Fig 6) . However, the R16H/M250K double mutant lost the ability to induce p62 degradation. These results imply that the combined mutations, R16H and M250K, induced an unfavorable structural alteration in NSs, which abolished its function to degrade p62.",

It has been reported that NSs-induced p62 degradation contributes to the inhibition of IFN-\u03b2 production [14] . Accordingly, our data suggested that MP-12-R16H/M250K was unable to completely block IFN-\u03b2 mRNA synthesis due to a lack of ability to promote the degradation of p62 (Fig 6) . Although MP-12-R16H/M250K replication induced IFN-\u03b2 mRNA synthesis, the level of the IFN-\u03b2 mRNA was significantly lower than that in MP-12\u0394NSs-infected cells (Fig 5) , suggesting the importance of interaction of NSs with SAP30 for IFN-\u03b2 inhibition. Taken together, the data shown here and those of others [11, 14] strongly imply that NSs-SAP30 interaction and NSs-induced general host transcriptional suppression function are both necessary for efficient inhibition of IFN-\u03b2 mRNA transcription.",

MP-12 replication induces NSs-dependent p53 stabilization, which contributes to virus-induced cell death [21] , and yet it was unclear which function of the NSs contributed to the induction of the p53-mediated cytotoxicity. As shown in Fig 3, MP-12-infected cells showed the lowest cell viability, followed in order by MP-12-M250K, which moderately suppressed host general transcription, and MP-12-R16H/M250K, which did not suppress host transcription. Hence, there was a correlation between the strength of NSs-mediated, host transcriptional shut-off activity and cell viability in the infected cells (Table 3) . Likewise, accumulation of p53 was the highest in MP-12-infected cells, followed in order by that in MP-12-M250K-infected cells and MP-12-R16H/M250K-infected cells, suggesting to us that p53 stabilization also correlates with the transcription inhibition activities of the different NSs mutants. These results indicate that the NSs-mediated host transcriptional shut-off triggered p53 stabilization, leading to p53-mediated cell death.",

            "text": "Although MP-12 is an attenuated RVFV strain, 55% of 18-day-old CD1 mice died after intraperitoneal inoculation with 10 4 PFU within 13 days p.i. (Fig 7) . As the immune system is not yet fully developed in young mice, it likely failed to prevent systemic infection by MP-12. Consistent with this notion, intraperitoneal inoculation of MP-12 into severe combined immune deficiency mice also caused 100% mortality [33] . MP-12-R16H/M250K carrying NSs that lacks the host transcription inhibition function was completely attenuated in 18-day-old CD1 mice (Fig 7) . MP-12-M250K carrying NSs with an impaired ability to inhibit transcription also exhibited reduced virulence when compared to that in its parental virus MP-12. These data highlight the role of the host transcription inhibition function of NSs in RVFV virulence. Type I IFN has been shown to play a critical role in protecting the host from RVFV-induced disease in animal models [34] . Notably, both the NSs mutants, carrying either the M250K single mutation or the R16H/M250K double mutation, retained the ability to bind to SAP30, the factor that is targeted by NSs to inhibit IFN-\u03b2 mRNA transcription. However, the induction of IFN-\u03b2 mRNA synthesis was not completely blocked in MP-12-R16H/M250K-infected MRC-5 cells, most probably due to the lack of inhibition of host transcription in these cells expressing the mutated NSs. These data suggest the possibility that the inability of MP-12-R16H/M250K to completely block the production of IFN-\u03b2 in infected mice could have contributed towards its attenuation. In addition, the production of other antiviral and/or proinflammatory cytokines could have also contributed towards the attenuated phenotype of both of these mutant viruses, carrying NSs with an impaired ability to block host transcription. It is also possible that the lower levels of virus-induced cytocidal effects might have contributed to the lower virulence of these NSs mutant viruses, as both mutant viruses caused less severe cytopathic effects and cytotoxicity than did MP-12 in cultured cells (Fig 3) . We believe that experiments using RVFV mutants, carrying the M250K single mutation and the R16H/M250K double mutation, in animal models would yield valuable information about the role of NSs-mediated host transcription inhibition in regulating host cytokine responses and its impact on the pathogenesis of RVFV. MP-12 is an attenuated live vaccine candidate, but it still harbors residual virulence in a young mouse model. Although further studies are required to test the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of MP-12-M250K and MP-12-R16H/M250K, there is a potential for developing these MP-12-derived NSs mutant viruses as safer live attenuated RVFV vaccine candidates.",

            "text": "We found that the serial passage of an MP-12-derived mutant virus having a large deletion in the 5' untranslated region of M RNA segment [30] in Vero E6 cells resulted in accumulation of variant viruses that were able to replicate better than the original mutant virus. Most of viruses in passage 18 had a large internal deletion in the NSs gene, which may mean their NSs proteins are biologically inactive. Others have reported that RVFV carrying large deletions in the NSs gene start accumulating from the 15 th serial passage in BHK cells of the RVFV P strain, which is defective in IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 signaling [35] . In our experiment, the large deletions in the NSs gene were detected after the 5 th serial passage of the virus. Although the cell lines used in the studies were different, the deletion of the NSs gene as early as after 5 passages implied that there was a selective pressure to remove the NSs gene from the virus genome during the passaging of the mutant virus. The full-length NSs gene of the uncloned passage 18 viruses had M250K, M250T, K202N and D100G mutations (Table 1 ). In the cells infected with MP-12 carrying NSs with a D100G mutation, the accumulation of NSs was poor (Fig 1) , indicating that the D100G mutation affects the efficient accumulation of NSs. As two out of the five plaque-cloned viruses (clones 3 and 4, Table 1 ) also had the D100G mutation in NSs, this possibly affected its accumulation in infected cells. The remaining three clones carried NSs with a M250K or R16H/M250K mutation. Our results showed that these mutations in NSs partially or completely abolished its host transcription inhibition function without affecting its ability to interact with SAP30 to inhibit IFN-\u03b2 mRNA synthesis. These data implied that the host transcription function of NSs was unfavorable for the mutant virus, carrying a deletion in the 5' UTR, to replicate well in VeroE6 cells. MP-12-M250K and MP-12-R16H/M250K replication induced low cytotoxicity due to its lower inhibitory activity on host transcription (Figs 2 and 3) . We suspect that the lack of NSs-induced host transcription suppression created a favorable cellular environment for the mutant virus, thereby allowing the emergence and accumulation of mutant viruses that lacked this function. Further studies are required to delineate the importance of NSs-mediated host transcription inhibition in the virus life cycle.",
