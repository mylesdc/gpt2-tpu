The cat was rescued at about 5 months of age and had been strictly indoor since. A year previously, the cat was evaluated by our Internal Medicine Service for an acute onset of vomiting, dysphagia, dysphonia, inspiratory stridor and suspected bilateral laryngeal paralysis. Physical examination revealed mild anisocoria (right eye (OD) miosis), dysphonia and right thoracic limb (RTL) lameness. Eosinophilia, hyperglobulinemia and hypocholesterolemia were the only complete blood count (CBC) and serum biochemical abnormalities (Supplemental documents). Serum protein electrophoresis confirmed a polyclonal gammopathy. Diagnostic testing, including FeLV/FIV ELISA, acetylcholine receptor antibody titer, abdominal ultrasound, splenic aspirates cytopathology and a swallowing study, did not identify a cause for the clinical signs. The cat improved without treatment within a week. Historically, anisocoria (miosis OD) was reported since a kitten. However, 3 weeks before presentation to the Neurology Service, the cat developed mydriasis OD and left eye (OS) miosis ( Figure  1 ), reflecting a reversal in the \"historical\" anisocoria. One week later, the cat developed Horner's syndrome OD, pelvic limb ataxia and knuckling on its left thoracic limb (LTL), prompting referral.",

Magnetic resonance imaging (1.5 Tesla, Siemens Medical Solutions, Malvern, PA, USA) of the cervical spine revealed diffuse contrast enhancement of the supraspinatus, subscapularis and triceps musculature bilaterally, worse on the left, with no evidence of spinal cord involvement ( Figure 2 ). Cisternal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was normal but there was albuminocytological dissociation of lumbar CSF (nucleated cell count (NCC) 4/mL, reference value <5; protein concentration: 1.24 g/L, reference value <0.4) with a cytological increase in the proportion of non-degenerate neutrophils (80% neutrophils, 9% lymphocytes and 11% macrophages). CSF and blood Toxoplasma, Cryptococcus and Coronavirus titers and blood FelV/FIV ELISA results were negative. Bartonella henselae DNA was amplified and sequenced from a Bartonella Alpha Proteobacteria Growth Medium (BAPGM) enrichment blood culture by Galaxy Diagnostics Inc. Research Triangle Park, NC, USA. The 16S-23S intergenic spacer DNA sequence was 100% similar (377 of 377 bp) to Bartonella henselae Houston 1 (Gen Bank accession number CP020742). Conversely, BAPGM CSF culture as well as a quantitative PCR on blood and CSF were PCR-negative. The cat was discharged with instructions to administer oral clindamycin at 15 mg/kg BW every 12 h for potential toxoplasmosis, but the medication was discontinued after a week based upon negative Toxoplasma gondii titers (by immunofluorescent assay (IFA)) for immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG)).",

After restarting clindamycin these signs improved, but 5 days later, the cat developed right pelvic limb (RPL) paresis with proprioceptive deficits, decreased withdrawal and patellar reflexes. Lumbar spinal pain suggested a lesion affecting the lumbar intumescence or right lumbosacral plexus. Mild right medial iliac and colonic lymphadenomegaly was visualized on abdominal ultrasound. MRI of the lumbosacral spine revealed diffuse contrast enhancement of several muscles. Lumbar CSF albuminocytological dissociation (NCC: 1/uL, protein concentration: 0.65 g/L) persisted. Electromyographic and nerve conduction velocity (NCV) study (Nicolet Viking Quest, MFI Medical, San Diego, CA, USA) abnormalities revealed changes consistent with a myopathy and neuropathy (Supplemental documents). Right cranial tibial and triceps muscle biopsies, evaluated in frozen and paraffin fixed sections, showed a mild to moderate multifocal myositis with several myofibers containing large parasite cysts measuring 150-200 mM in diameter consistent with Sarcocystis sp. (Figure 3 ). Mononuclear cell infiltrations were at sites distant from the parasite cysts and not directly invasive. A pan-fungal blood PCR panel and CSF Sarcocystis neurona titers were negative. Immunohistochemistry and PCR for Bartonella spp. on formalin fixed and fresh frozen muscle samples were negative. A PCR targeting the 18S ribosomal RNA gene was performed on DNA extracted from frozen muscle tissue (methods in Supplemental documents). National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Basic Local Alignment Tool nucleotide (BLASTn) analysis of the 18S rRNA gene was 99.9% identical (744/745 bp) to Sarcocystis caninum (Gen Bank accession# MH469240.1) and Sarcocystis artica (Gen Bank acces-sion# MH469240.1), and 99% identical (339/340 bp) to Sarcocystis felis. A cox1 amplicon was 99.4% identical (321/323 bp) to S. caninum (Gen Bank acces-sion# MH469240.1) and to S. artica (Gen Bank accession# MF596306.1). A Gen Bank cox1 reference sequence was not available for alignment with S. felis. Other cox1 Sarcocystis spp. with 99.7% identity (322/323 bp) included: Sarcocystis fulicae (Gen Bank accession# MH138316.1), Sarcocystis wobeseri (Gen Bank accession# MH138315.1), Sarcocystis corvusi (Gen Bank accession# MH138314.1), and Sarcocystis cornixi (Gen Bank accession# MH138313.1). Due to poly-repetitive regions, only a smaller ITS-1 sequence was available in Gen Bank for BLAST analysis (525 bp). When aligned with S. felis (Genbank accession # AY190081.1 and AY190082.1) cloned ITS-1 amplicons varied between 97.3% and 99.0% (Table  1) . Based upon cumulative DNA sequence alignments of multiple gene targets we suspect that the visualized organism was S. felis, but infection with another Sarcocystis sp. more similar to S. caninum could not be ruled out. Treatment was directed at a co-infection with B. henselae and S. felis. showing anisocoria with the left pupil being smaller than the right pupil. B. The cat in late February 2015, showing a change in the anisocoria with the right pupil being smaller than the left pupil. According to the owner, this was the pattern of anisocoria that the cat had since a kitten, i.e. for six years. Also note the nictitating membrane protrusion consistent with Horner's syndrome. C. This picture shows the cat in June 2015, after complete resolution of all clinical and neuromuscular signs including the historical anisocoria.",

Five days later, the owner reported some improvement but the cat was still knuckling on its RPL. Ten days later, there was a transient relapse characterized by dysphagia, recurrence of anisocoria and ataxia. Pradofloxacin (5 mg/kg BW every 24 h PO) was added for treatment of the B. henselae infection. One week later, the cat developed paresis in three limbs. Because of difficulties with administration of liquid medication, ciprofloxacin (25 mg/kg BW every 24 h PO) was substituted for pradofloxacin after 4 days of treatment. After 10 days, the paresis worsened so pyrimethamine (2 mg/kg BW every 24 h PO) was added. Five days later, the cat became non-ambulatory tetraparetic, lethargic, painful and anorexic. Gabapentin (10 mg/kg BW every 12 h PO) was added for pain management. Due to anorexia, the ciprofloxacin was discontinued and appetite returned. Three days later, the cat started to improve neurologically and was ambulatory tetraparetic with weak motor function in the RTL and strong motor function in the other limbs. Proprioceptive deficits in all limbs and mild anisocoria persisted. Two weeks later, neurological abnormalities continued to improve, but the cat had developed a non-regenerative anemia, neutropenia, and moderate increase in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activities (Supplemental documents). These changes resolved 4 weeks after discontinuation of TMS and Pyrimethamine. Three months later, neurological examination, CBC and serum chemistry results were normal, with the exception of mild hyperglobulinemia. Titers for B. henselae were positive, but a BAPGM enrichment blood culture was negative. A comprehensive tick serology and PCR panel (NCSU Vector Borne Disease Feline Comprehensive Panel) to rule out untreated concurrent infections was negative. This panel includes serology testing for B. vinsonii subsp. berkhoffii, Bartonella koehlerae (by IFA) Borrelia burgdorferi, Anaplasma, and Ehrlichia spp. antibodies and Dirofliaria immitis antigen (Snap V R 4DX Plus V R IDEXX Laboratories, city, state, USA) paired with PCR testing to detect the presence of Anaplasma, Babesia, Bartonella, Cytauxzoon, Ehrlichia, Rickettsia, and hemotropic Mycoplasma organism DNA. Hepatozoon spp. and S. neurona PCR on blood extracted DNA were negative. Neospora caninum PCR on muscle was also negative. The cat remained neurologically normal with symmetrical pupils two years later with only residual signs of mild dysphagia.",

That organism has been attributed a questionable pathogenic role and only following immunosuppression (Dubey et al. 1994; Gillis et al. 2003; Greiner et al. 1989 ). In our case, the muscle protozoal cysts were further characterized by PCR. We generated DNA sequences for three target genes suggesting that the muscles contained organisms that were closely related to S. felis, but also to S. caninum and S. artica. PCR amplification, cloning and DNA sequencing supported B. henselae and Sarcocystis co-infection. To date, S. felis had not been associated with disease in cats (Little 2014) , therefore, our findings potentially support coinfection with more than one Sarcocystis sp. Given the higher prevalence of S. caninum in our region, an infection with this Sarcocytis sp., as well as S. felis, was considered more likely than S. arctica. However, S. arctica infection could not be completely excluded, as these Sarcocystis organisms are very closely related on an evolutionary basis. When aligned with available Gen Bank nucleic acid sequences, differences among the targeted genes suggested the presence of more than one Sarcocystis spp. PCR testing did not support infection with another protozoal genus and DNA sequences were not consistent with S. neurona, a species associated with muscular disease.",

Similar to our adult cat, the kitten developed leukopenia, increased ALT and AST activities suspected to be related to the antibiotics, as discontinuation after 20 days of treatment was followed by normalization of the hematologic and serum chemistry abnormalities. The increased ALT and AST activities could have been secondary to muscle necrosis as reported with Toxoplasma infection (Dubey, Lindsay, and Lappin 2009 ).

The owner reported that the cat had suffered from anisocoria since a kitten and based upon the repeated documentation of hyperglobulinemia and eosinophilia, it is likely that one or both infections were present for at least a year. Eosinophilia occurred in cats experimentally-infected with B. henselae (Kordick and Breitschwerdt 1997) and hyperglobulinemia has been associated with B. henselae seroreactivity in naturally-infected cats (Whittemore et al. 2012) . The hypocholesterolemia was thought to be a consequence of down-regulation of cholesterol production by the liver in the face of increased globulin production to maintain oncotic pressure (Patel et al. 2005) . Assuming no in-house exposures, it is possible that the cat was B. henselae bacteremic and hosted a quiescent protozoal infection since rescued as a stray kitten. Clearly, concurrent infections contribute to complex disease expression, in association with overlapping clinical, hematological and biochemical abnormalities (Maggi et al. 2013) .",

Spastic pupil syndrome, has been reported in cats positive for FeLV but our case tested negative multiple times (Cullen and Aubrey 2013b) . It is unlikely for the anisocoria to have been secondary to chorioretinitis as the miosis would be abolished in the dark and pupillary light reflexes would be abnormal with only retinal lesions (Cullen and Aubrey 2013a) . It is unclear which, if either, of the infectious agents caused the ocular signs. However, the fact that the cat's anisocoria had been present for 6 years and resolved after treatment indirectly supports a role of chronic infection in its pathophysiology.",

A similar phenomenon may occur following destruction of intramuscular protozoal cysts and explain the initial worsening of signs in our case. Administration of anti-inflammatory drugs might be beneficial to prevent this reaction and avoid early treatment discontinuation. The cat was treated with a fluoroquinolone for 19 days, during which TMS was concurrently administered. Because Bartonella bacteremia can have a relapsing pattern, we cannot exclude the possibility that the cat remained infected despite the negative post-treatment blood culture (Kordick et al. 1999; Breitschwerdt et al. 2010; Regnery et al. 1996) . Fortunately, the cat made a full recovery despite earlier antibiotic discontinuation than recommended (Breitschwerdt et al. 2010) , suggesting that the duration of treatment and/or the antibiotic combination was adequate to address both infections.",
