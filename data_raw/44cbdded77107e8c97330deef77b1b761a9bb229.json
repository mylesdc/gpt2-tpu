            "text": "Studying the effects of HIV infection on the host transcriptome has typically focused on protein-coding genes. However, recent advances in the field of RNA sequencing revealed that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) add an extensive additional layer to the cell's molecular network. Here, we performed transcriptome profiling throughout a primary HIV infection in vitro to investigate lncRNA expression at the different HIV replication cycle processes (reverse transcription, integration and particle production). Subsequently, guilt-by-association, transcription factor and co-expression analysis were performed to infer biological roles for the lncRNAs identified in the HIV-host interplay. Many lncRNAs were suggested to play a role in mechanisms relying on proteasomal and ubiquitination pathways, apoptosis, DNA damage responses and cell cycle regulation. Through transcription factor binding analysis, we found that lncRNAs display a distinct transcriptional regulation profile as compared to protein coding mRNAs, suggesting that mRNAs and lncRNAs are independently modulated. In addition, we identified five differentially expressed lncRNA-mRNA pairs with mRNA involvement in HIV pathogenesis with possible cis regulatory lncRNAs that control nearby mRNA expression and function. Altogether, the present study demonstrates that lncRNAs add a new dimension to the HIV-host interplay and should be further investigated as they may represent targets for controlling HIV replication.",

These studies typically focused on protein-coding genes and successfully identified several host factors involved in HIV pathogenesis and intracellular defense 1-6 . However, over the past decade it has become evident from genome-wide tiling arrays and RNA sequencing studies that the human genome is pervasively transcribed and that the majority of these transcribed genomic sequences are associated with non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) rather than protein coding RNAs, underpinning their widespread presence in the cellular environment and adding a new layer of complexity to the cell's molecular network 7-10 .",

Sample preparation was performed with the Quick amp WT labelling kit (Agilent) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In short, 100 ng total RNA was used per sample as input for the generation of fluorescent complementary RNA (cRNA). This involved cDNA synthesis and amplification with simultaneous incorporation of cyanine 3-labeled CTP by the T7 RNA polymerase. Subsequently, the cRNA was purified with the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) as instructed by the manufacturer's protocol and RNA concentrations measured by NanoDrop ND-1000 (Thermo Scientific). Next, 600 ng of each cRNA sample was fragmented at 60 \u00b0C for 30 min and hybridized to the microarray slides for 17 hours in a hybridization oven rotator (Agilent) at 65 \u00b0C.

Processing of the raw fluorescent microarray signals and differential expression analysis were performed with the Bioconductor R package limma (v3. 20.9) 25 . First, background correction and quantile normalization was applied in order to make the 16 arrays comparable. Next, control probes and low expressed probes were filtered out. Probes were considered expressed when the fluorescent signal was 50% brighter than the 95% quantile of the negative control probes on at least two arrays. Subsequently, a linear model was fitted for each gene to estimate the variability in the data and differential expression analysis was performed at each of the four selected time points. Fold changes were calculated by an empirical Bayes method and the returned p-values were corrected for multiple hypothesis testing by the Benjamini-Hochberg method 26 . Probes with adjusted p-values < 0.05 were considered significantly differentially expressed and annotations were added to identify the gene symbols that are linked to the probes. Information on the different lncRNA classes was exported from LNCipedia (www.lncipedia.org), these included: intergenic, sense-overlapping, antisense, intronic and bidirectional lncRNA classes. In a last step, enhancer regions (eRNAs) were filtered by making use of the database of predicted human enhancers (DENdb, http://www.cbrc.kaust.edu.sa/dendb/index.php) 27 . qPCR validation of selected lncRNAs. cDNA synthesis on total RNA samples was performed with iScript (Bio-Rad) according to manufacturer's protocol. Primers were designed with the IDT Primer Quest tool, primer specificity checked by NCBI BLAST analysis and secondary structures were determined with the mFold tool 28 . Primer efficiencies were tested on a standard curve of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Next, primers were checked for specific amplification of the amplicon by smelting curve analysis and further used when amplification efficiency was observed between 90-110% 29 .

In short, normalized gene expression values of the 16 samples were used to build a correlation matrix with the differentially expressed lncRNA and all expressed mRNAs. For each lncRNA, mRNAs are ranked according to their correlation coefficient and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed using pathways from the Biocarta database 37 . A lncRNA was considered linked to a pathway in case of a GSEA False Discovery Rate (FDR)-value < 0.05. Visualization and network analysis was performed with Cytoscape using the built-in network analyzer tool 38 . Binding and expression target analysis (BETA): transcription factor analysis. Regulatory transcription factors (TFs) were determined for the differentially expressed mRNAs and lncRNAs at each time point through 'binding and expression target analysis' (BETA) 39, 40 . In short, available Chip-seq data of 237 known transcription factors and the microarray gene expression data were integrated to identify putative active or repressive TFs and their target genes (cut-off used for enriched TF binding sites: 0.001). Next, clustering was performed by CLUTO software and visualization of TF networks was conducted with Cytoscape 38,41 . Cis and co-expression analysis of lncRNAs and neighboring mRNAs. Chromosomal coordinates based on the reference genome assembly GrCh37 were extracted from the LNCipedia database for the differentially expressed lncRNA transcripts 11 . Additionally, the Ensembl Biomart tool was used for the retrieval of chromosomal coordinates of all mRNA transcripts of the corresponding reference genome 30 . Based on the chromosomal coordinates, overlapping mRNAs and the closest neighboring mRNAs within the same topological associated domain (TAD) and a distance of up to 500 kb from transcription start and stop sites were determined for each differentially expressed lncRNA using a custom R script. Six categories were used to classify neighboring genes as previously described: full or partially overlapping, head to head, tail to tail, nearby to head (sense and antisense strand), nearby to tail (sense and antisense strand) (Supplementary Data 3) 13,31 . TAD information was downloaded from the ENCODE webserver (https://www.encodeproject.org/comparative/chromatin/#Hi-C) and was made available by Dixon et al 32 . Next, HIV interactions for the neighboring mRNAs were determined by making use of the HIV Interaction Database 33 . In addition, the epigenetic context of HIV linked mRNA-lnRNA pairs was determined for H3K4Me 1 , H3K4Me 3 , H3K27Ac, H3K36Me 3 together with cap analysis gene expression (CAGE) peaks by making use of the Integrative Genomics Viewer 34 . Lastly, the co-expression database Co-LncRNA (http://www.bio-bigdata.com/Co-LncRNA) was browsed to determine similar co-expression events that correspond with our dataset 35 .",

This is consistent with data from Peng et al. who found similar percentages of DE expressed ncRNAs in CD4+ T cells upon HIV infection at 12 h and 24 h post infection 18 . Furthermore, DE mRNAs and lncRNAs between our dataset and Peng et al. showed an overlap of 44-45% and 8-13%, respectively. A possible reason for the lower percentage of overlapping lncRNAs is that lncRNAs are found, an overage, to exert a shorter half-life than mRNAs and could change in a more time-dependent manner linked to specific cellular processes 42 . Hence, lncRNA expression might be influenced to a larger extent than mRNAs because the datasets differ in the time points considered for transcriptome profiling. Nonetheless, these overlapping mRNAs and lncRNAs validate our experimental setup and form ideal targets to be further investigated in the context of HIV infection. For instance, a well-known and characterized lncRNA, MALAT1 (lnc-SCYL1-1) is found in both datasets and is already linked to viral infection 43 . In addition, in HIV infected individuals MALAT1 is shown as a potential biomarker 44 . In this context, it would be worthwhile exploring and comparing transcriptome datasets of other viral infections (i.e. CMV, HSV) to pinpoint lncRNAs involved in the broad process of antiviral defense. Our dataset is publicly available and can contribute to this goal.",

In this context, HIV circumvents host's cellular defenses rapidly and finds numerous escape mechanisms 47 . Interestingly, the guilt-by-association analysis showed that the majority of DE lncR-NAs upon HIV infection could be functionally linked to the proteasome pathway. Indeed, it has been shown that (immuno-) proteasomes are recruited for cellular defense against incoming pathogens (i.e. HIV) [48] [49] [50] . These complexes digest viral proteins and provide small peptides that can be presented by Major Histocompatibility Complex I (MHC-I) molecules on the cell surface in order to be recognized and killed by other immune cells. On the other hand, HIV has evolved a way to counteract this by Nef-mediated downregulation of the (immuno-) proteasomes and MHC-I presentation 51 . Other examples of proteasomal countermeasures include the Vif-mediated ubiquitination of the HIV restriction factor APOBEC3G/F, flagging it for proteosomal degradation, as well as Vpu-mediated downregulation of CD4 and tetherin through proteosomal degradation [52] [53] [54] . In addition, the proteasome has been involved in the life cycle of many other viruses 48, 55 . Therefore, we hypothesize that the proteasome plays an important role in HIV escape mechanisms but also in cellular defense against pathogens and that lncRNAs are widely involved in this interplay between virus and host.",

For instance, downregulation of mRNAs was mainly regulated by PRC2 complex members SUZ12, EZH2 and CTBP2. This complex was shown to be largely involved in HIV latency establishment and epigenetic silencing 62 . PRC2 is also linked to proteasome and ubiquitination pathways which corroborates guilt-by-association findings 63 . Next, we found multiple TFs that were described to directly interact with HIV Tat. Hence, we might speculate that the lncRNA targets of these TFs are Tat induced. For instance, TAF1/3/7 are represented at the 18 h and 30 h time point regulating lncRNA expression. These TAFs take part in the TFIID-complex (transcription factor IID) that is described to be directly interacting with HIV Tat and can guide RNAPOLII transcribed target genes 64 . Beside Tat linked TFs, we found TFs that guide lncRNA expression with a role in the regulation of HIV transcription. The TF CHD1 is a chromatin reassembly factor that acts as a positive regulator of HIV transcription as upon knockdown a total block of HIV transcription was previously observed 65 . ATF3 is part of the SWI/SNF complex and is responsible for shuttling this complex to the HIV promoter and guide HIV transcription. This complex is well characterized in HIV infection and important in HIV latency 66, 67 . LncRNAs were, on average, connected to more TFs as compared to mRNAs, indicating that specific lncRNAs can be induced by multiple TFs.
