In this study, we inserted into a replication defective PanAd3 a transgene expressing a fusion protein of conserved influenza antigens nucleoprotein (NP) and matrix 1 (M1). We then studied antibody and T cell responses as well as protection from challenge infection in a mouse model. A single intranasal administration of PanAd3-NPM1 vaccine induced strong antibody and T cell responses, and protected against high dose lethal influenza virus challenge. Thus PanAd3 is a promising candidate vector for vaccines, including universal influenza vaccines.",

Antigenic changes in influenza virus, primarily in the surface antigens hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), are referred to as antigenic shift (subtype changes by reassortment) and antigenic drift (mutation). This variability among influenza viruses hinders vaccination efforts. Currently, annual surveillance is necessary to identify circulating viral strains for use in vaccine production. New vaccines are often required, and take about 6 months to become available [1] . Thus new approaches are needed.",

This immunity to conserved antigens would not necessarily prevent infection completely, but might decrease severity of disease, speed up viral clearance, and reduce morbidity and mortality during the initial stages of an outbreak until strain-matched vaccine became available [2] . Furthermore, vaccines based on T cell immunity could be used in combination with a seasonal vaccine to improve efficacy, especially in the elderly who are at high risk of severe disease and show reduced responses to current flu vaccines.",

By sequence homology, NP is .90% conserved among influenza A isolates [4] . Both murine [5] and human [6] cytotoxic T lymphocytes induced by NP of one virus strain have been shown to cross-react with NP from different influenza A strains. The strong immune responses to NP in mice contribute to protection against challenge [7] via CD8 + T cells [5, 8] , as well as contributions from CD4 + cells [9, 10] and antibodies [11] [12] [13] . The influenza A matrix (M) gene encodes two highly conserved proteins: an ion channel protein, M2, and the capsid protein, M1. M1 is not a major protective antigen in the mouse and is not well recognized by mouse T cells [14] , but has long been known to be recognized by human T cells [15] . Thus its potential contribution to vaccine protection may be underestimated by mouse studies.",

More potent immunization can be achieved using recombinant vectors to express the influenza antigens and focus immunity on these targets.

Recombinant adenovirus vectors expressing NP [19] or both NP and M2 [20, 21] can protect mice against a range of influenza virus challenges, including highly pathogenic avian H5N1 strains. While potential interference by prior immunity to human adenoviruses has been suggested as a barrier, this issue can be circumvented by use of vectors based on animal adenoviruses [22] [23] [24] [25] . Chimpanzee adenoviruses have been shown to be useful vaccine vectors in a variety of animal studies [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] , and the prevalence of neutralizing antibodies against chimpanzee adenoviruses is low in human populations [31] [32] [33] , but not all of them are equally immunogenic.",

The influenza expression cassette contains consensus sequences of NP and M1. Influenza A NP and M1 sequences were obtained from the NCBI Influenza Virus Resource database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih. gov/genomes/FLU/FLU.html). Protein sequences were chosen from among different subtype strains isolated between 1990 and 2009 that caused infection in humans worldwide. The NP consensus sequence was derived by alignment of all non-identical sequences (H1N1: 88 of 629 sequences, H1N2: 5 of 26, H3N2: 244 of 1557, H5N1: 50 of 121) using MUSCLE version 3.6, and applying the majority rule. Further, the NP sequence used in the PanAd3 vaccine lacks the Nuclear Localization Signal residing in aa 6-8 (TKR mutated to AAA), which results in increased cytoplasmic accumulation. The M1 consensus sequence was similarly derived by the alignment of non-identical sequences (H1N1: 51 of 808 sequences, H1N2: 3 of 34, H3N2: 115 of 2150, H5N1: 23 of 145). NP and M1 sequences were spaced by a flexible linker (GGGSGGG). The resulting NPM1 sequence was codonoptimized for expression in eukaryotic cells. A diagram of the insert and its full sequence are given in Figure 1 . The NPM1 expression cassette was inserted into the PanAd3DE1DE3 backbone via homologous recombination in E.coli. Sequences for HIV gag protein or a respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) fusion protein of F protein, nucleoprotein N and transcription factor M2-1 were inserted in constructs to be used as specificity controls. Expression cassettes were inserted into a pNEB shuttle vector and then transferred into the SnaBI linearized pPanAd3DE1DE3-EGFP plasmid by homologous recombination in E. coli, exploiting the homology between the HCMV promoter and BGH polyA sequences. The PanAd3 vectors were produced in Procell 92 cells, which were derived from the HEK 293 cell line originally banked at the University of Leiden in 1973 [36] and obtained from Frank Graham at MacMaster University (Hamilton, Canada), and further adapted at Okair\u00f2s to be suitable for manufacturing by incorporation of a plasmid carrying a Tet repressor expression cassette and G418-resistance gene. The protocol for generating the Procell 92 cell line followed essentially that published by Matthews et al. [37] . Briefly, HEK 293 cells were transfected with an expression vector containing a cassette encoding the Tet repressor under control of the human phosphoglycerate kinase-1 (PGK) promoter, and the G418-resistance gene. Single clones were selected by growing the transfected cells in the presence of 1 mg/ ml G418 in culture medium. Single clones were amplified and tested for Tet repressor expression by Western Blot analysis. The stability of Tet repressor expression in the selected clone was tested up to passage 63. PanAd3 vectors grown in these cells were purified by cesium chloride gradients and stored in buffer A195 [38] .",

Since they are so closely related, Ad5 and PanAd3 may share certain structural features providing powerful internal adjuvant effects and thus higher immunogenicity.

Moreover, in a screening study, PanAd3 was shown to be a potent vector in mice and in primates [34] . We show here that a single administration of PanAd3-NPM1 influenza vaccine given i.n. provided highly effective protection against lethal challenge with mouse-adapted A/FM, with greatly reduced morbidity and mortality compared to controls.

Using multiple target antigens may invoke different immune mechanisms, reduce the likelihood of generating escape mutants, and provide a larger range of epitopes that may be suitable for different MHC types. Although M1 is not expected to play much of a role in protection in mice, it is a prominent target of T cell immunity in humans [3] , and might contribute to the performance of the PanAd3-NPM1 vaccine in humans. The results presented here support the use of the PanAd3 vector as a vaccine candidate that is highly effective at inducing T cell and antibody immunity, while at the same time having the advantage that it is not neutralized by human sera [34] . Thus PanAd3, when used to express conserved influenza virus antigens, has promise as a ''universal'' influenza vaccine candidate.",
