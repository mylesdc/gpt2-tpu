A comparison of MPP patients and HC showed APOC1 had the largest area under the curve (AUC) of 0.853, with 77.6% sensitivity and 81.1% specificity.

MP infection is thought to influence the expression of associated proteins, which are released into the bloodstream through different pathways (Covani et al., 2008; Sun et al., 2008; Li et al., 2014) . Plasma proteins including cytokines, growth factors, extracellular matrix proteins, and other soluble mediators are essential for MP infection. In terms of pediatric MPP diagnosis, culture and serological tests are insensitive, timeconsuming, and cross-reactive in children (Daxboeck et al., 2003; Long et al., 2012) ; therefore, they are not appropriate for the rapid and accurate detection of MP infection in clinical practice.",

Proteomic analysis using a label-free protocol is increasingly being performed for biomarker selection. Based on the principle that a special mixture of plasma proteins present different characterizations, this technique has been widely used in many diseases including infectious diseases (Papadopoulos et al., 2004; Ren et al., 2004; Agranoff et al., 2006; Hodgetts et al., 2007) , cancer (Engwegen et al., 2006) , and vascular disease (Pinet et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2008; Hong et al., 2009) .

By using label-free quantitative analysis, we analyzed plasma proteins among MPP, HC, and IDC individuals. This proteomic approach allowed the measurement of changes in protein expression, which might be used to \"forecast\" disease pathogenesis. As reported here, 282 and 76 proteins were identified in the MPP group compared with the HC and IDC groups, of which 27 were overlapping. In addition, WEGO was used to analysis the function of the 27 different proteins. Here, we observed that a majority of the proteins had a cellular distribution and organelles. They were mainly related to binding, catalysis, enzyme regulator, molecular transducer, transcription regulator, and transporter. They mostly participated in cellular processes, metabolic processes, cellular component organization, biological regulation, and pigmentation, all of which are thought to be essential in the pathogenesis of MP.",

Using the same optimal cutoffs for each protein, we analyzed the sensitivities and specificities of different combinations of two or three of the different proteins for the diagnosis of MPP. The specificities of combined proteins were generally higher than APOC1, while the sensitivities of combined proteins were generally lower than the best protein for differentiating MPP patients and HC or IDC patients. In summary, our results showed that APOC1 alone was the best choice for differentiate of MPP in children. APOC1 had the best sensitivity and specificity. To the best of our knowledge, the sensitivity and specificity of the MP-specific antigens currently used are poor when used as a diagnostic test based on ineffective antibody detection (Zhang et al., 2014) .

Cholesterol metabolism is essential for MP growth and infection. APOC1 is a 6.6-kDa plasma protein that inhibits receptor-mediated lipoprotein clearance (Shulman et al., 1975) . It is secreted by many organs, including the liver, spleen, and lung, and is secreted into the blood (Lauer et al., 1988 ). Therefore, the plasma level of APOC1 is associated with cholesterol metabolism and MP infection status in humans. Lipid metabolism is one of the essential changes in many infectious diseases, including MPP (Katsel et al., 2007; Xiang et al., 2007) . Furthermore, many cholesterol metabolites have been analyzed by studies with the aim of screening and identifying early biomarkers for infectious disease (Leoni et al., 2006; Bach et al., 2009; Gilch et al., 2009) . Several genes associated with cholesterol metabolism and lipid biosynthesis were reported to be up-regulated in serum or plasma (Brown et al., 2005) . Because APOC1 activates cholesterol metabolism (Barbisin et al., 2014) , its up-regulation leads to an increase in cholesterol biosynthesis, consistent with the concomitant presence of MP infectious disease. Our study demonstrated that APOC1 alone is a potential biomarker for differentiate of MPP in children. This was an exploratory study to detect novel plasma proteomics biomarkers and further studies are required. MPP causes up to 40% of CAP in children and biomarker selection requires a large sample verification. Clearly, this should be the focus of further investigations.",
