New IBV variants are continuously emerging, which complicates vaccination-based IB control. In this study, five IBVs were isolated from clinical samples submitted to a diagnostic laboratory in Ontario, Canada, and subjected to detailed molecular characterization. Analysis of the spike (S)1 gene showed that these five IBVs were highly related to the Delmarva (DMV/1639) strain (~97.0% nucleotide sequence similarity) that was firstly isolated from an IB outbreak in the Delmarva peninsula, United States of America (USA), in 2011. However, the complete genomic sequence analysis showed a 93.5-93.7% similarity with the Connecticut (Conn) vaccine strain, suggesting that Conn-like viruses contributed to the evolution of the five Canadian IBV/DMV isolates. A SimPlot analysis of the complete genomic sequence showed evidence of recombination for at least three different IBV strains, including a Conn vaccine-like strain, a 4/91 vaccine-like strain, and one strain that is yet-unidentified. The unidentified strain may have contributed the genomic regions of the S, 3, and membrane (M) genes of the five Canadian IBV/DMV isolates. The study outcomes add to the existing knowledge about involvement of recombination in IBV evolution.",

Here, the infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is the causative agent and is an enveloped, positive-sense single-stranded ribonucleic acid (RNA) virus which belongs to the genus Gammacoronavirus of the family Coronaviridae [2] . The size of the IBV genome is approximately 27.6 kilo-bases (kb) and the genome encodes at least 10 open reading frames (ORFs), flanked by two untranslated regions (UTR), and is organized as follows: 5 (UTR)-1a-1ab-S-3a-3b-envelope (E)-M-5a-5b-nucleocapsid (N)-3 UTR [3] . Ribosomal frameshifting from the 1a reading frame into the 1ab ORF at the 5 region generates two polyproteins (1a and 1ab) which are then cleaved by two types of virus-encoded proteases. The process generates 15 non-structural proteins (nsps), nsps 2-16, that are necessary for replication and pathogenicity [3, 4] .",

For example, a recombination event that involved the 5 terminal end of the S1 gene containing hypervariable regions I and II has driven an IBV isolate of 4/91 genotype to be more serologically related with H120 strain [13] . Further, it has been suggested that the acquisition of the 3 end of the N gene and the 3 UTR from a strain of different genotype, through recombination, may alter the replication efficiency of an IBV isolate [14] .",

The use of embryonated eggs for virus isolation has been approved by the Health Science Animal Care Committee (HSACC) of the University of Calgary, Calgary, Canada. Five diagnostic samples, which were characterized by partial S1 gene sequencing to be related to DMV/1639 strain, were received from the Animal Health Laboratory (AHL), University of Guelph, Canada, for virus isolation. The samples were collected from different farms located in Ontario, Canada, and the relevant history for each sample is summarized in Table 1 . Virus isolation was carried out by inoculation of 9-11-day-old embryonated SPF eggs with 150 \u00b5L of 10% tissue homogenates or virus transport medium. After 48 h of incubation at 37.6 \u2022 C, the eggs were refrigerated 12 h, then the allantoic fluid was collected and stored at -80 \u2022 C. Allantoic fluid was serially passaged in the embryonated SPF eggs 2-4 times in order to obtain high virus titers. ",

All genotypes of representative IBV strains are indicated on the right side. Our five IBV isolates are marked in red color. Our five IBV isolates were nearly identical among themselves, with an overall nucleotide sequence identity of 99.4-100%. A phylogenetic analysis using 146 complete genomes of IBV strains downloaded from GenBank was conducted to investigate their relationships with the sequences of our five IBV isolates. The sequences of our five IBV isolates showed close relationships with the Conn vaccine (93.5-93.7%), Cal56b (93.5-93.7%), and IBS037A/2014 (93.9-94.1%) strains. The nucleotide-based MAFFT alignment of our five IBV isolates with the Conn and 4/91 vaccine strains provided six fragments that showed alternating similarity with the two reference strains (Figure 3 ). One fragment, which started at the 3 end of the replicase gene and ended at the 3 end of M gene, was different from both the Conn and 4/91 vaccine strains. Similarity searches using different parts in this fragment showed variable identities with other IBV reference and vaccine strains, where gene 3 revealed a higher sequence similarity of 96.63-96.93% with Mass41 2006 (FJ904713). The highest similarity with the M gene was with ck/CH/LSD/03I (KX236001), which was 96.76-97.20%.

In a study that examined a highly variable region within the IBV genome, namely, the S1 gene, even 10 passages in embryonated eggs resulted in no changes in five viruses. Additionally, two viruses had only 2 nucleotide changes and one virus had only 1 nucleotide change [33] . The genome organization of our five IBV isolates (5 -1a-1ab-S-3a-3b-E-M-4b-4c-5a-5b-N-6b-3 ) is consistent with many of the recently reported IBV genomes in different locations around the world [34] [35] [36] [37] . We reported a 13-nucleotide deletion in the reading frame of the 6b gene in isolate IBV/Ck/Can/18-048192T. The examination of the raw sequencing data verified the deletions. Natural IBV isolates lacking accessory proteins (3a, 3b, 5a or 5b), or those expressing a truncated 3a protein, have been reported, and the absence of such accessory proteins did not abolish the replication of these viruses [38, 39] . Although the roles of these accessory genes are not fully studied, recombinant IBVs with 3 and/or 5 deleted genes exhibited reduced virulence and induced protective immune responses [40] . Similarly, the ORF 4a protein of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus affected interferon therapy response [41] and the overexpression of ORF 6 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus induced cell apoptosis [42] . It is possible that these proteins may have analogous roles in IBVs, although further studies are necessary to confirm this possibility.",

Therefore, it is used often for phylogenetic analysis [43] . Classification of IBV into lineages or genotypes relying on the full S1 gene has been proposed [7] , and by using this method, our five IBV isolates were clustered within the GI-17 genotype, where they were highly related to MDL_DMV1639. On the other hand, the Mass and Conn types that are used in live IBV vaccines in Canada showed low similarities with our five IBV isolates, which may explain the increase in the isolation rate of DMV/1639-like isolates from poultry farms in Canada [15] . However, vaccine efficacy studies against DMV/1639-like isolates circulating in Canada are required. The occurrence of IBV strains in Canada that are closely related to IBV strains in USA may be explained by the potential role of wild birds in virus transmission across the border [44] . A substantial portion of diagnostic samples (20.5%) genotyped by the Animal Health Laboratory (University of Guelph, ON, Canada) in the early 2000s were US variant-like viruses [18] , which also indicates the possibility IBV transmission between the two neighboring countries. It is also possible that the current IBV isolates in Canada originated from a native parental IBV strain, and studies should be directed towards the confirmation of the origin of the current IBV strains. It was suggested that the IBV strain DMV/1639 evolved from a strain of PA/171/99 which was detected in early 1999 in Pennsylvania, where the two isolates shared a 95.6% S1 nucleotide sequence identity [32, 45] .",

The Conn vaccine, Cal56b, and IBS037A/2017 strains showed high sequence identity with our five IBV isolates. However, strains Cal56b and IBS037A/2017 were isolated in the USA and Malaysia, respectively, and they have never been isolated in Canada [47, 48] . Since the complete genome sequences of our five IBV isolates were 99.4-100% identical, the SimPlot analysis results were identical. Analysis of the recombination events in our five IBV isolates showed that genetic fragments from the Conn vaccine strain could be detected in our five IBV isolates. Live attenuated Conn vaccines are used in the poultry industry, since this is one of the two live attenuated vaccines available in Canada. Our recombination analysis also indicated that the 4/91 vaccine-like virus is a potential parent of our five IBV isolates. Unlike live attenuated Conn vaccines, modified live vaccines based on the 4/91 strain are not licensed in Canada. The incursion of the IBV 4/91 strain in Canadian poultry started in late 2011 [18] . Unfortunately, there were no recent complete genome sequences available to include in our analysis in this instance. It is noteworthy that seven S1 sequences of 4/91 viruses identified in 2011 were 99.2-100% identical amongst themselves and 99.2-99.6% identical to the IBV 4/91 vaccine strain [18] . It is possible that a large segment of such 4/91 viruses contributed in the replicase gene and 5 UTR of our five IBV isolates. Four out of five recombination events demonstrated in this study were in the first two thirds of the genome. Consistently, regions with the highest incidence of recombination were located in the replicase transcriptase complex [34, [49] [50] [51] . We developed a hypothesis to explain the scenario of the origin of the fragment that involved the S gene, which states that a recombination event replaced this fragment in a Conn vaccine-like virus with a fragment from an as-yet-unidentified parental virus, which has led to the emergence of these variants which include the PA/171/99 and DMV/1639 strains in the USA. Subsequently, when these isolates started to circulate in Canadian poultry, recombination events that involved 4/91 vaccine-like viruses may have happened. The results obtained from the multiple sequence alignments of our five IBV isolates and isolate GA9977/2019 with the Conn vaccine and 4/91 vaccine strains support this hypothesis, however, it cannot be confirmed, since there were no complete genome sequences available for both the PA/171/99 and DMV/1639 strains immediately after they had been isolated.",

Recombination Analysis 22 The Conn vaccine and 4/91 vaccine sequences were used as putative parents, and each sequence 23 of our five IBV isolates was queried in SimPlot. The result of SimPlot confirmed the result of the 24 MAFFT alignment, where six fragments were changing identity with the Conn vaccine and 4/91 25 vaccine strains, except for the genomic region between 20,120-25,100 nucleotides, which showed low 26 identity with either of these strains. The SimPlot results for our five IBV isolates were identical, and 27 only representative analysis of IBV/Ck/Can/18-049707 is shown (Figure 5a).28 Five crossover points were found: The first recombination breakpoint (at approximately 1,911 29 nucleotide position) was located in the nsp2 gene, the second in the nsp3 gene (at approximately the30 3,735 nucleotide position), the third in the nsp12 gene (at approximately the 12,043 nucleotide 31 position), the fourth at the 3\u2032 end of 1ab gene (at approximately the 20,120 nucleotide position), and 32 the last breakpoint was located at the 3\u2032 end of the M gene (at approximately the 25,100 nucleotide 33 position).
