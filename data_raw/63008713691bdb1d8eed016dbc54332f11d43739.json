Because of the lack of a disease model in animals and the complex immune interaction in dengue infection, the study of host response and immunopathogenesis is difficult. The development of genomics technology, microarray and high throughput quantitative PCR have allowed researchers to study gene expression changes on a much broader scale. We therefore used this approach to investigate the host response in dengue virusinfected cell lines and in patients developing dengue fever.",

Among the most highly upregulated genes were the chemokines IP-10 and I-TAC, both ligands of the CXCR3 receptor. Increased expression of IP-10 and I-TAC in the peripheral blood of ten patients at the early onset of fever was confirmed by ELISA. A highly upregulated gene in the IFN pathway, viperin, was overexpressed in A549 cells resulting in a significant reduction in viral replication. The upregulation of genes in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway prompted the testing of proteasome inhibitors MG-132 and ALLN, both of which reduced viral replication.",

Dengue virus is an enveloped, positive-stranded RNA virus of the Flaviviridae family transmitted by the mosquito Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. Four serotypes of dengue virus (DENV1-4) circulate in endemic areas. Although infection with one serotype of dengue virus confers life-long protective immunity to that serotype, it does not protect the host from infection with other serotypes [3] .",

Through means not yet fully understood, Langerhans cells spread the virus, via the lymphatic system, to other tissues such as liver, spleen, kidney and blood, whereas monocytes, macrophages and endothelial cells are the major cell types in which the virus replicates [5] . In the majority of symptomatic dengue infections, a fever of 5-7 days duration develops together with bone and joint pain, retro-orbital pain, nausea and fatigue, this is called dengue fever (DF). While the majority of DF patients recover without intervention, 2-5% develop a more severe form of the disease, called dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS), characterized by thrombocytopenia and vascular leakage, causing hypervolemic shock and death if not promptly treated [6] . The cause of DHF/DSS is not clear. Antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) is the most widely supported theory explaining the higher risk of DHF/DSS associated with a heterologous secondary infection [7] . The phenomenon of T cell ''original antigenic sin'' has also been described [8] . Like many viruses, dengue inhibits IFNa and IFNb signaling by suppressing Jak-Stat activation, resulting in reduced host antiviral response [9] . The combination of a reduced host defense, increased uptake of the virus and delayed viral clearance likely synergizes to produce higher viremia resulting in a more severe outcome.",

In this study, the expression of 15 genes involved in cell cycle, apoptosis, membrane trafficking and cytoskeleton was found to be altered after infection [13] . Using a different gene expression approach, primary macrophages infected with a clinical isolate of dengue were analyzed by a cytokine array containing 375 human cytokine-related genes with approximately 20 genes observed to be either up-or down-regulated [14] .

We identified the upregulation of three major clusters of genes; NF-kB-mediated cytokine/chemokine responses, type I IFN response, and the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Increased expression of selected genes, identified by Compugen array, was confirmed using a taqman low density array (TLDA) and results extended to include an additional, readily infectable, cell line (A549) and PBMC derived from adult dengue fever patients from a Singapore dengue prospective cohort study. Next we sought to confirm the functional effects of these upregulated genes. We confirmed the high levels of two novel chemokines, IP-10 and I-TAC, in dengue infection, in both cell lines and in dengue patients. We also determined that overexpression of viperin, an upregulated gene in the IFN pathway, and proteasome inhibition, with MG-132 or ALLN, reduced virus replication. In summary, we have used microarray analysis to identify new host genes associated with dengue infection, and to show that components of the host response can control dengue viral replication and therefore represent potential targets for drug therapy.",

Using microarray technology to monitor the response of virtually every human gene, we aimed to identify the ways in which humans interact with dengue virus during infection in order to discover new therapeutic targets that could be exploited to control viral replication. From the activated genes, we identified three pathways common to in vitro and in vivo infection; the NF-kB initiated immune pathway, the type I interferon pathway, and the ubiquitin proteasome pathway. We next found that inhibiting the ubiquitin proteasome pathway, or activating the type I interferon pathway, resulted in significant inhibition of viral replication. However, inhibiting the NF-kB initiated immune pathway had no effect on viral replication. We suggest that drugs that target the ubiquitin proteasome pathway may prove effective at killing the dengue virus, and, if used therapeutically, improve clinical outcome in dengue disease.",

All three methods showed that new viral replication began after 24 hours and reached a plateau at 72 hrs, with FACS analysis showing 28% of cells infected at this point. After 72 hrs a degree of cell death become apparent (data not shown) and the experiment was not continued. Analysis of microarrays, performed in duplicate (dye-swapped) on three biological replicates at each time point, comparing infectious with heat inactivated virus; using a SAM q value (false discovery threshold) of 25%, revealed no significantly differentially expressed genes at 3, 6, 12 or 24 hrs post infection. However, there were 24 transcripts identified at 48 hrs and 124 at 72 hrs (a total of 132 transcripts representing 124 genes; Table S1 ) that were differentially expressed. At both 48 hrs and 72 hrs, clustering of transcripts using PANTHER analysis identified the IFN-mediated immunity pathway as the most significant with a P value of 10 215 (at 72 hrs). Genes that are typically induced after type I IFN stimulation, including OAS1, OAS2, OAS3, OASL, STAT1, STAT2, MX1, IFIH and IFNb, featured prominently in this cluster ( Figure 2 and Table S1 ). Further analysis of the 124 genes suggested the involvement of NF-kB-mediated cytokine/chemokine responses (NFKBIB, NFKB1A, TNFA1P, CCL4, CCL5, IP-10 and I-TAC amongst others) and ubiquitin related genes (HERC5, HERC6, UBE2L6, USP15 and others) ( Figure 2 ). Although not completely overlapping, a core host response to pathogen involving the IFN response and the NF-kB-mediated immune defense response [10] was observed in our array results.

Fifty genes fulfilled these criteria (Table S2 ) and, we felt, represented common genes involved in dengue virus response, or virus replication, while excluding responses that were cell type specific. These 50 common genes were mapped by direct interactions using the MetaCore program which illustrated the close clustering and interconnectedness of a network of 29 of genes around NF-kB, TNF-a and STAT1. (Figure 3A) . The NF-kB gene alone was added to the network, despite not being from our common list, to illustrate the connections between those induced by it. For example, the upregulation of IP-10, I-TAC, VEGF, PAI1, B2M, TNFAIP3 and RIG-1 could all be linked to the activation of NF-kB, while NFKB1B and NFKB1A, two feedback control genes for NF-kB activation, were also upregulated reflecting the self containment of this activation ( Figure 3A ). The degree of upregulation varied between the genes in this pathway with I-TAC and IP-10 being the most highly up-regulated (average expression in the two cell types and patients) genes ( Figure 3B) . A number of genes clustered around STAT1 were associated with the IFN pathway, and examination of the common list revealed another four genes (viperin, IFI44, IFIH1, G1P3) related to the IFN pathway that were upregulated but not mapped by the MetaCore program ( Figure 3C ).

In order to determine if this up-regulation of gene transcription lead to translation and protein release, concentrations of IP-10 and I-TAC protein in cell culture supernatant following dengue infection were determined by ELISA. In both the A549 and HepG2 infection models, dengue infected cells produced moderate, but significant (compared to heat-inactivated virus treated cells), concentrations of IP-10 ( Figure 4A ) and I-TAC ( Figure 4B ) at 72 hrs, but not at earlier time points (data not shown). We next investigated if these, or other, NF-kB induced proteins were influencing dengue virus replication. Adding dexamethasone to the HepG2 infection model to inhibit NF-kB activation [25] prevented IP-10 and I-TAC production, but had no effect on viral replication (data not shown). These results suggest that NF-kB activation, and IP-10 and I-TAC production, do not have a direct effect on viral replication and are, rather, simply part of the immune response to infection. Serum concentrations of IP-10 and I-TAC in the ten dengue fever patients described above, together with ten fever patients who did not have dengue (viral PCR negative) were also determined by ELISA. High concentrations of IP-10 ( Figure 4C ) and I-TAC ( Figure 4D) were present in the serum of dengue fever patients. There was significantly more IP-10 in the serum of the patients during the first (1-2 days after fever onset) and second (4-5 days after fever onset) visits, compared to the convalescent serum (P = 10 215 and P = 10 211 , respectively) as well as to non-dengue fever patient serum (P = 10 29 and P = 10 27 , respectively). I-TAC level was also significantly higher in first visit dengue patient serum comparing to both the convalescent (P = 10 27 ) and non-dengue fever (P = 10 26 ) patients. I-TAC levels in dengue fever patients at the second visit were significantly lower than at first visit (Fig 4D) .",

Viperin has previously been identified as an IFN-induced anti-viral protein in HCMV and HCV infection [26, 27] . In order to investigate the role of viperin in dengue infection, we used an established A549 cell line stably overexpressing viperin (Vip) [26] . Comparing to infection in wild type A549 cells (WT), viperin overexpressing cells were significantly resistant to viral replication, as shown by plaque assay two days after infection ( Figure 5A ), with and without pre-treatment with IFNb (+IFN; 500 U/ml). Although pre-treatment with IFNb had the greater anti-viral effect, viperin over expression alone resulted in a small, but significant, reduction in virus production both with (P = 0.038) and without (P = 0.0004) IFNb pretreatment. These results suggest that viperin is an functional component of the IFN-mediated response to dengue, and demonstrate, for the first time, that viperin could be part of the anti-dengue response.",

An examination of the effects of these compounds on the integrity and viability of inhibitor-treated cells using fluorescein diacetate revealed no cytotoxicity at these concentrations ( Figure 5C ).

Using microarray analysis of gene expression and high throughput quantitative real-time PCR, we investigated the host response to dengue infection in cell lines and in DF patients. We further validated our microarray results by functional study of the identified genes. Although dendritic cells, Langerhans cells and monocytes have been proposed as the principle reservoirs of viral infection [4] , it is not clear which other tissues, if any, are targeted. Immunohistochemistry and in-situ hybridisation studies of biopsies from DHF patients have indicated that a range of tissues are infected by the virus, including cells in the liver, spleen, lung, kidney and peripheral blood [5] . We chose the HepG2 cell line as the primary cell model for this study as it readily supported viral replication, and it is derived from the liver, which might be of some clinical relevance. The A549 cell line was included as it was also an excellent supporter of viral replication even though there is, presumably, little or no clinical relevance. The final clinical relevance came from the validation of the genes in 10 DF patients from the Singapore EDEN cohort. The 10 patients were selected based on low platelet count, because of the lack of WHO DHF/DSS manifestation in Singapore adult patients. Despite the limited sample number, and the wide range of collection times, variation between individuals at the same time point was ruled out by statistical analysis. We believe that with more patients, more genes that are differentially expressed would be identified.",

            "text": "In a dengue intracerebral mouse infection models, CXCR3 2/2 and IP10 2/2 mice both had higher mortality rate than wild type mice after infection, indicating that IP-10 and CXCR3 receptors are part of the host defense mechanism, most likely in recruitment of T cells to the infection site [38] . IP-10 was also proposed to compete with virus binding on the receptor in vitro [39] . However, the relevance of this study to human patients is not clear. Although IFNc, a/b and NF-kB could all induce the production of IP-10 and I-TAC, prevention of IP-10 and I-TAC via NF-kB inhibition clearly reduced the IP-10 level in HepG2 cells. Furthermore, IFNb and IFNc were not consistently upregulated in the two cell lines or in DF patients in our study (data not shown). Therefore, we believe that NF-kB activation rather than IFN induction played the major role in elevated IP-10 and I-TAC in dengue infection. The inhibition of NF-kB, and consequent IP-10 and I-TAC inhibition, had no demonstrable effect on dengue replication in cell lines, suggesting the more complex role for these chemokines in a multi-cellular in vivo setting. Concentrations of each chemokine were significantly higher during the early stages of dengue fever, while I-TAC levels were reduced at the second visit, IP-10 levels remained high. The persistently high level of IP-10 might also contribute to the immunopathogenesis of dengue although this would require further investigation. It may be that concentrations of IP-10 and I-TAC, in combination with a viral antigen, could be used as an early marker for dengue fever. It is interesting to note that the level of IP-10 and I-TAC were independent of previous history of dengue infection, as half of the ten tested patients were suffering from a secondary infection. The common clinical feature of the ten selected patients was the low platelet count at second visit. Because of the lack of severe dengue cases (by WHO definition) in Singapore, the low platelet count was used as the measure of severity by which the ten patients from the cohort study were classified as having more severe dengue fever. We cannot at this point make a link between the level of IP-10, I-TAC and disease severity because of the small number of cases used in this study, a more detailed clinical study, currently underway, aims to determine if the concentrations of IP-10 and I-TAC during early stages of infection are linked to the progression to more severe forms of disease.",

Our results indicated that viperin was one of the most highly upregulated genes in all models following dengue infection. Viperin encodes for an IFN-inducible antiviral protein shown to be associated with the endoplasmic reticulum and redistributed to the Golgi apparatus and cytoplasmic vacuoles following human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection [26] . The induction of viperin has been suggested to be anti-viral in both HCMV [26] and hepatitis C (HCV) [27] infections, but this is its first association with dengue infection. The use of viperin overexpressing A549 cells demonstrated that, in addition to being significantly upregulated during infection, viperin is directly involved in the anti-viral response to dengue, as shown by the suppression of dengue replication in the presence of increased expression of viperin. This effect was not as significant as the effect of IFNb alone suggesting that viperin is only a part of the IFN-mediated response to dengue. The molecular mechanism of the action of viperin to counter dengue infection will need to be further studied.",

Use of proteasome inhibitors, MG-132 and ALLN, significantly reduced the release of dengue virus following infection of the HepG2 cell line. Previously, it has been shown that the effect of proteasome inhibitors may be virus specific with these compounds less (or non-) effective against virus such as influenza [45] and equine infectious anemia virus [46] . The effect of proteasome inhibition on viral replication appears to be mediated via a number of different processes including the involvement of ubiquitin or the proteasome in virus assembly [45] , budding [47] and release and maturation [48] . Further studies may elucidate the exact role the ubiquitin-proteasome plays in dengue virus replication which may involve trafficking of the virus to the plasma membrane or the maturation and fusion of the virus upon release [49] . It is instructive to compare our results with those of a published microarray study investigating host responses in patient blood [50] . That study identified genes whose protein products are expressed in the ER to be the most significantly enriched, which directly overlaps with our identification of the ubiquitin pathway; specifically including UBE2 and the PSMB genes. This may represent a process fundamental to viral replication in any system. In addition, Simmons et al. described host responses associated with dengue shock syndrome that clearly overlap with our interferon related gene list. In particular, G1P genes, OAS genes, IFI genes and Mx genes were found in both studies, suggesting that the amount of viral replication may be directly related to clinical outcome.",

F.C. indicates fold change. ''-'' represents no significant change. Genes selected for real-time PCR validation through a TaqMan low density array (TLDA) platform are indicated by a tick. Found at: doi:10.1371/journal.pntd.0000086.s001 (0.28 MB DOC) Table S2 Quantitative PCR by Taqman based low density array in HepG2, A549 and Singapore dengue fever patients. Fold increase in gene expression as determined by quantitative PCR. For HepG2 and A549, the fold change was calculated based on dengue virus infection over heat-inactivated virus infection. For dengue fever patients (Patients), the fold change was calculated using patient blood samples collected at the first visit (,1-2 days after onset of fever) over the convalescence (3-4 weeks after the acute fever). Upregulation is shown in black and down-regulation in red. ''1.0'' represents no significant change (significance determined by q value ,5, see Material and Method). Genes that were significantly up-regulated in at least one time point in HepG2 and in at least one time point in A549 and in Patients are indicated with P-values, calculated by standard student T test and selected based on a cut off at P,0.05.
