Despite extensive research on the relationship between autophagy and virus infection, the concrete role of autophagy in porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) infection has not been reported. In this study, autophagy was demonstrated to be triggered by the effective replication of PEDV through transmission electron microscopy, confocal microscopy, and Western blot analysis. Moreover, autophagy was confirmed to benefit PEDV replication by using autophagy regulators and RNA interference. Furthermore, autophagy might be associated with the expression of inflammatory cytokines and have a positive feedback loop with the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway during PEDV infection. This work is the first attempt to explore the complex interplay between autophagy and PEDV infection. Our findings might accelerate our understanding of the pathogenesis of PEDV infection and provide new insights into the development of effective therapeutic strategies.",

            "text": "Viruses 2017, 9, 53 2 of 16 damaged organelles are delivered to lysosomes for degradation and recycling [8, 9] . Autophagy can be induced by diverse intracellular and extracellular stimuli, such as nutrient starvation, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), and virus infection [10] . Increasing evidence indicates that autophagy plays both anti-viral and pro-viral roles in the life cycles and pathogenesis of a broad range of viruses [11] . Specifically, autophagy is an intrinsic host defense mechanism that inhibits viral replication or eliminates viruses by delivering them to the lysosomal compartment for degradation. Meanwhile, viruses develop many mechanisms to block autophagy or even hijack it for their own benefit, such as human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) [9, [12] [13] [14] . However, autophagy is also believed to serve as a platform for viral replication, especially for RNA viruses, such as classical swine fever virus (CSFV), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), and rotavirus (RV), utilizing the membranes of the autophagosome-like vesicles for their replication [15] [16] [17] . These polar characteristics reveal the complicated relationship between autophagy and viral infection.",

In addition, our previous study demonstrated that mTOR (the mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway, which was closely associated with cellular autophagy, was down-regulated, and that the autophagy associated protein ATG5 was up-regulated during PEDV infection [19] . These studies indicated that autophagy might participate in PEDV infection, but the specific function of autophagy in the process of PEDV infection has not been elucidated. In the present study, we demonstrated for the first time that autophagy was triggered in Vero cells during PEDV infection to promote its replication. Moreover, autophagy might mediate the inflammatory responses induced by PEDV infection and have a positive correlation with the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway.

As is well-known, the LC3, a protein, is selectively recruited to autophagic vesicles, which can be considered as its redistribution from a diffuse cytoplasmic localization to a distinctive punctate cytoplasmic pattern during autophagy [16] . GFP-LC3 positive cells treated with rapamycin showed high punctate LC3 accumulation. Additionally, large amounts of punctate GFP-LC3 proteins were observed in PEDV-infected cells at 18 hpi, while GFP-LC3 was detected as a diffuse distribution in mock-infected cells ( Figure 1B) , indicating that the accumulation of GFP-LC3 dots was induced by PEDV infection. The quantitative analysis of the percentage of punctate GFP-LC3 cells in the total GFP-positive cells was performed and 100 GFP-positive cells were detected in each sample. The percentage of punctate GFP-LC3 cells in PEDV infected cells was nearly 70%, which was obviously higher than that in the mock-treated cells ( Figure 1C ). To further analyze whether autophagy was induced by PEDV infection, we examined the level of autophagy marker proteins in PEDV-infected cells by using immunoblotting. The conversion from LC3-I to LC3-II was monitored at 6, 12, 18, 24, and 30 h post PEDV infection. As shown in Figure 2A ,B, a significant conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II was observed during the progression of PEDV infection, which was tracked by the PEDV N protein. Meanwhile, PEDV infection increased the expression of ATG5 and beclin1 in Vero cells relative to the mock-infected cells ( Figure 2C ). The results further supported that autophagy was induced by the PEDV infection.",

The results indicated that viral replication was required for PEDV-induced autophagy. To further analyze whether autophagy was induced by PEDV infection, we examined the level of autophagy marker proteins in PEDV-infected cells by using immunoblotting. The conversion from LC3-I to LC3-II was monitored at 6, 12, 18, 24, and 30 h post PEDV infection. As shown in Figure  2A ,B, a significant conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II was observed during the progression of PEDV infection, which was tracked by the PEDV N protein. Meanwhile, PEDV infection increased the expression of ATG5 and beclin1 in Vero cells relative to the mock-infected cells ( Figure 2C ). The results further supported that autophagy was induced by the PEDV infection.",

Thus, the role of autophagy in PEDV induced inflammatory responses was investigated first by measuring the level of inflammatory cytokines under the circumstances when autophagy was suppressed by silencing the expression of Beclin1 and ATG5 proteins. Data showed that the inflammatory cytokines (such as IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, CCL5, TNF-\u03b1, and MCP-1) were significantly down-regulated at 24 hpi when autophagy was inhibited in PEDV infected cells ( Figure 6A,B) , suggesting the potential involvement of autophagy in PEDV induced inflammation. It is well-known that the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway plays a pivotal role in PEDV induced inflammatory response and Vero cells are interferon deficient [19, 29] . Therefore, the influence of autophagy on the NF-\u03baB pathway was determined under the deficient expression of Beclin1 and ATG5 at 24 h upon PEDV infection by immunoblotting analysis. The level of LC3-II decreased, and the phosphorylation of p65 was also down-regulated at the same time ( Figure 6C ). The results indicated that autophagy might participate in PEDV induced inflammation through the NF-\u03baB pathway.",

These data indicated that a potential positive feedback loop between autophagy and the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway might exist during PEDV infection. Considering that autophagy inhibition can block PEDV replication, a TNF-\u03b1 induction of inflammatory cytokines experiment in autophagy-deficiency cells was carried out to exclude the effect of PEDV replication on cytokine production. From Figure 6F ,G, it can be seen that the expression of inflammatory cytokines induced by TNF-\u03b1 in ATG5-or Beclin1-deficient cells was significantly down-regulated, when compared to the transfected cells of the negative control.

            "text": "Recent studies have demonstrated that the replication mechanisms may vary among different members of the Coronaviridae family. For example, TGEV infection induces autophagy to negatively regulate its replication [35] . IBV can induce autophagy but does not require autophagy for its replication [34] . The specific effect of autophagy induction on MHV infection is controversial. Prentice et al. reported that MHV utilized the autophagy process to form DMVs to enhance its replication [33] . However, another study showed that autophagy was not important for MHV replication [41] . In the present study, the concrete effect of autophagy upon PEDV infection was examined by administrating pharmacological regulators. The yield of PEDV was found to be suppressed whenever the autophagy process was inhibited by 3-MA at the early stage, or by CQ at the late stage. Additionally, the induction of autophagy by rapamycin also enhanced the viral titer. The effect of autophagy modulation on PEDV replication was further evaluated by silencing the two essential endogenous components Beclin1 and ATG5 [26, 42] . Beclin1 (ATG6), a critical component in the class III PI3 kinase complex (PI3KC3), is involved in the initial step of autophagosome formation, while the ATG12-ATG5 conjugate, a key regulator, participates in autophagosome maturation [43] . The abolishment of their expression reduced the PEDV titer. These results suggested that autophagy induction might benefit PEDV replication. Autophagy has also been documented to have a complex interaction with apoptosis during viral infection [44] [45] [46] . For instance, influenza A virus was documented to induce apoptosis in autophagy protein deficient cells [47] . Autophagy was also reported to postpone apoptotic cell death during porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) infection through Bad-Beclin1 interaction [48, 49] . The interplay of autophagy and apoptosis during PEDV infection needs to be further elucidated for a better understanding of the autophagy mechanism by which PEDV benefits its infection.",

            "text": "Recently, autophagy has been identified as an important component of the immune system, functioning from the elimination of infectious agents to the modulation of inflammatory responses [50, 51] . The crosstalk between autophagy and inflammation has drawn much attention from researchers in recent years, while the relationship between autophagy and PEDV induced inflammatory responses is largely unclear. In the present study, we showed the expression of inflammatory cytokines and the activation of the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway were both restrained in PEDV infected autophagy deficient cells, implying that autophagy might participate in PEDV induced inflammatory responses, especially for the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. Meanwhile, Vero cells with a NF-\u03baB pathway deficiency exhibited a decreased level of LC3-II after PEDV infection, suggesting that the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway might also have a positive role in autophagy induction. It was worth mentioning that the PEDV yield was reduced in both autophagy deficient or NF-\u03baB pathway deficient cells. The decreased expression of inflammatory cytokines induced by TNF-\u03b1 in autophagy deficient cells might provide new clues for deciphering the complex relationship between autophagy and inflammation. The cause-and-effect relationship between the restriction of PEDV yield reduction on the expression of inflammatory cytokines and the restraint of inflammation inhibition on PEDV replication in autophagy deficient cells needs further elucidation. A previous study reported that the positive feedback loop between autophagy and the NF-\u03baB signaling cascade might exacerbate the inflammation induced by H5N1 pseudotyped viral particles [28] . The inhibition of NF-\u03baB was also documented to induce autophagy suppression, leading to apoptosis in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells [52] . We speculate that autophagy and inflammatory cascade reactions might be positively regulated by PEDV infection to exacerbate inflammation. Furthermore, apoptosis might play a pivotal role in the complex relationship between autophagy and inflammation.",
