However, as specific PCR only detects pre-defined targets, novel virus strains or viruses not included in routine test panels will be missed. Recently, advances in high-throughput sequencing allow for virus-sequence-independent identification of entire virus populations in clinical samples, yet standardized protocols are needed to allow broad application in clinical diagnostics. Here, we describe a comprehensive sample preparation protocol for high-throughput metagenomic virus sequencing using random amplification of total nucleic acids from clinical samples.",

A protocol including filtration, nuclease digestion, and random amplification of RNA and DNA in separate reactions provided the best results, allowing reliable recovery of viral genomes and a good correlation of the relative number of sequencing reads with the virus input. We further validated our method by sequencing a multiplexed viral pathogen reagent containing a range of human viruses from different virus families. Our method proved successful in detecting the majority of the included viruses with high read numbers and compared well to other protocols in the field validated against the same reference reagent. Our sequencing protocol does work not only with plasma but also with other clinical samples such as urine and throat swabs.",

However, specific PCR requires prior knowledge of the virus sequence, and a separate assay needs to be designed for each individual virus or virus type. Recently, high-throughput or next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies enabled metagenomicbased identification of viruses by sequencing random fragments of all genomes present in a clinical or environmental sample [1] [2] [3] . As viral metagenomics is virus-sequence independent, potentially any virus, cultivable or uncultivable, known or novel, can be readily detected and the method can be applied to all types of virus genomes, including single-stranded DNA and RNA. Several research studies have used this technology in recent years to explore the breadth of the virome in diverse biological and environmental samples including human and animal feces [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] , blood [13, 14] , animal and human tissues [15] [16] [17] , and human respiratory tract secretions [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] and highlighted the validity of the approach to detect rare and novel viruses.",

Briefly, reads were quality-filtered by removing low quality bases (average PHRED score below 20), reads shorter than 75 bp and reads with low entropy (i.e., consisting mainly of repeats). Read passing quality filters were cleaned from non-viral reads by aligning with STAR [48, 49] against, in this order, human, bacterial, bovine, and canine genomes. Reads not matching any of the above genomes were aligned with BLAST [50] against an in-house viral database that contains approximately 46,000 different virus sequences. For each sequencing read that passed the quality filter, the BLAST hit with lowest e value was reported, given the identity was higher than 75%.

Plasma samples were spiked with four different viruses (adenovirus, HHV-4, influenzavirus, poliovirus) and processed and sequenced with the combined and the new separate workflow. In the separate workflow, random amplification products were pooled before NexteraXT library preparation in equal concentrations. The experiment was performed in triplicates. a Distribution of sequencing reads into the different taxonomic categories viral, human, bacterial, and unknown origin. b Number of reads (upper panels) and fraction of all quality passing reads (lower panels) obtained for each individual virus the digestion of human DNA containing high numbers of repetitive (low entropy) sequences and important for maximizing the amount of quality reads to increase sensitivity. Nuclease treatment enriched for all viruses, except HHV-5, which might, probably due to its size or envelope, not be as stable as smaller viruses. While the combination of low-speed centrifugation, filtration, and nuclease-treatment also showed the greatest increase in the proportion of viral sequences in other studies [29] and filtration and DNase treatment lead to dramatic improvements [25] , some studies only found minor differences among the methods with or without filtration and nuclease digestion [30] . The reason for these discrepancies might be that some studies compare pre-sequencing nucleic acid concentrations while others compare sequencing reads. Enrichment methods in general decrease the absolute concentration; however, in our hands, the overall gain of nuclease treatment to increase the ratio of virus over host prevails. Poliovirus reads were recovered in highest numbers in our experiments, although the amount of spiked viruses was adjusted to similar levels (ct values). This might be due to the fact that poliovirus has the smallest virion and genome size among the spiked viruses, what might have facilitated its efficient enrichment and amplification. In contrast, HHV-4 virus is a large virus in respect to virion and genome size and often only single reads could be detected. It was suggested that filtration might actually have an adverse effect on large virus genomes such as herpesvirus and mimivirus [28] . In other studies of virus profiling in clinical specimens, lower numbers of HHV-4 reads as expected were also reported [55] . However, experiments using HHV-5, which belongs to the same virus family as HHV-4, resulted in many more virus reads. Therefore, it is conceivable that other factors than virus and genome size are influencing the number of recovered viral genomes.",

In both virus combinations and experiments performed, there was a good correlation between the ratio of spiked viruses and the ratio of the resulting reads (Fig. 4) . Direct correlations of viral copies with percentages of sequencing reads have been suggested [18, 54] . However, a direct quantification of input copy numbers based on sequencing reads seems not applicable. Viruses have different properties such as the presence of an envelope, types of genomes, and virion sizes, and certain virus or genome types are amplified preferentially as we have seen with Poliovirus in our experiments. Adding to the complexity, different composition of the genetic background in clinical samples will strongly influence the yield of virus reads. Nevertheless, the correlations showed that the ratio of sequencing reads is preserved over different input ratios and concentrations, signifying that the amplification method itself preserves the relative contribution of different viruses in a sample. Finally, spiking the same amount of viruses in different samples showed that the protocol presented here could be applied not only for plasma, but also for other clinical samples such as urine and swabs. A more stringent virus enrichment protocol is needed to sequence stool samples or biopsies, as those contain a lot of bacterial or human background reads, respectively [53, 54] .",

Such an approach reduces the time and cost spent today on multiple tests performed for each distinct virus and allows detecting rare or novel viruses not accounted for in routine test panels. Characterization of the virome and its alterations in specific disease settings might help to better understand and manage infectious diseases. Finally, our analysis highlights the need for validation methods and standards for metagenomic sequencing approaches in clinical diagnostics.",

Increasing the PCR input volume had no effect on viral enrichment. Figure S4 . After extraction, viral amplicons were quantified in the eluate and the ratio of spiked viruses was perfectly maintained. (PDF 540 kb)",
