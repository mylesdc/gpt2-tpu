They have a 3' stem loop and histone downstream element (HDE) that are recognized by stem-loop binding protein (SLBP) and U7 snRNP, respectively. The N-terminal domain (NTD) of Lsm11, a component of U7 snRNP, interacts with FLASH NTD and these two proteins recruit the histone cleavage complex containing the CPSF-73 endonuclease for the cleavage reaction. Here, we determined crystal structures of FLASH NTD and found that it forms a coiled-coil dimer. Using solution light scattering, we characterized the stoichiometry of the FLASH NTD-Lsm11 NTD complex and found that it is a 2:1 heterotrimer, which is supported by observations from analytical ultracentrifugation and crosslinking.",

(2017) The Nterminal domains of FLASH and Lsm11 form a 2:1 heterotrimer for histone pre-mRNA 3'-end processing. PLoS ONE 12(10): e0186034. https:// Biochemical studies of the 3'-end processing machinery that cleaves replication-dependent histone pre-mRNAs have shown that it is comprised of the stem-loop binding protein (SLBP), U7 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (U7 snRNP), FLASH, and the histone pre-mRNA cleavage complex (HCC) [1, [3] [4] [5] [6] . SLBP binds the 3' stem-loop in the pre-mRNA and remains bound after mRNA maturation, and functions in translation [7, 8] . The 3' stem-loop also recruits the 3'-5' exoribonuclease 3'hExo [9, 10], which is not essential for processing [11] but trims the processed histone mRNAs and initiates degradation of histone mRNAs in the cytoplasm [12] . The core U7 snRNP consists of two integral and stably associated components:~60-nucleotide U7 snRNA and a unique Sm ring, which contains Lsm10 and Lsm11 in place of the spliceosomal SmD1 and SmD2 [13, 14] . The U7 snRNP recognizes the pre-mRNA through base-pairing between the 5'-end of U7 snRNA and the HDE [15, 16] . SLBP bound to the upstream stemloop stabilizes this interaction, likely by directly or indirectly contacting a subunit(s) of U7 snRNP [17] .",

Residues 51-70, which include the LDLY motif previously shown to be essential for histone pre-mRNA processing [28] and for binding the HCC [22], are disordered in this crystal. The first 30 residues of FLASH are poorly conserved among homologs (Fig 1B) , although there is substantial conservation from Drosophila to mammals for residues 55-137 in the N-terminal segment.

            "text": "In eukaryotic cells, histones play important roles in genomic DNA packaging as well as epigenetic regulation of gene expression. The levels of histone mRNAs are carefully controlled throughout the cell cycle and they dramatically increase during S phase to meet the growing demand for packaging the newly replicated DNA from the replicating genome [1] . In metazoans, histone proteins for packaging of newly synthesized DNA are encoded by the replicationdependent histone genes. They are distinct from the replication-independent histone genes which are expressed constitutively [2] . Unlike canonical pre-mRNAs, replication-dependent histone pre-mRNAs lack introns and undergo 3'-end processing that differs from cleavage coupled to polyadenylation. Histone pre-mRNAs contain two sequence elements essential for their 3'-end processing: a highly-conserved stem-loop structure and a purine-rich histone downstream element (HDE). Cleavage occurs between these two sequence elements and the polyadenylation step is omitted, giving rise to mature histone mRNAs that end with the stemloop followed by a 4-5 nucleotide tail. PLOS Residues 71-137 observed in the structure form a single \u03b1-helix. The length of the coiledcoil FLASH NTD dimer is approximately 100 \u00c5, excluding the C-terminal hexahistidine tag observed for one of the protomers. The protomers do not superimpose perfectly onto each other (r.m.s.d.~1.5 \u00c5), and one of them appears to adopt a straighter conformation (S1 Fig). For each protomer, the buried surface area is~1800 \u00c5 2 (~25% of its total surface area, calculated using the program PISA [29] ). The majority of the FLASH dimer interface residues are leucines and isoleucines, forming the bulk of the hydrophobic interactions (Fig 2A) . The leucines and isoleucines are interspersed with other residues that form either polar or non-polar interactions. Other hydrophobic interactions are formed by bulky residues such as Tyr73, Tyr80, and Phe94, as well as Met87 (selenomethionine in this structure). Hydrophilic interactions include residues Gln100/Asn101 and Glu107/Asn108 near the mid-section of the structure (Fig 2B) , and an ion pair between Lys129 and Asp130 at the C-terminal end of the coiledcoil (Fig 2A) .",

In addition to Cys83, we also mutated the other Cys residue in the FLASH NTD, Cys54, in case it formed a disulfide as well even though the residue was disordered in the structure. The two structures adopt the same coiled-coil dimer (Fig 3A and 3B ) as the wild-type FLASH NTD (Fig 3C) , confirming that FLASH NTD dimer formation does not require the Cys83 disulfide. The individual protomers of these two mutant dimers also show differences, similar to those observed for the wild-type dimer (S1 Fig). Interestingly, residues 53-70 from one of the protomers in the structure at 2.6 \u00c5 resolution are stabilized by crystal packing, showing strong electron density corresponding to an \u03b1-helix ( Fig 3B) .

Previous pull-down studies showed that substituting Leu118 and Ile119 with alanines abolished the ability of FLASH to bind Lsm11 [28] . According to our FLASH NTD structures, both Leu118 and Ile119 are situated at the dimer interface ( Fig 4A) . It was possible that these mutations disrupt FLASH NTD dimerization, thereby affecting Lsm11 binding. To test this possibility, we generated the FLASH NTD L118A/I119A mutant in the background of C54S/C83A mutations and investigated its oligomeric state by analytical gel filtration (Fig 4B) . Our results showed that this mutant had a similar migration behavior as the C54S/C83A mutant control, indicating that the deleterious effect of L118A/I119A mutation on binding Lsm11 is not due to the disruption of FLASH NTD dimerization.",

In addition, since Lys129 and Asp130 form an ion pair in the dimer interface, we also replaced these two charged residues as well as the preceding Arg128 with alanines, generating the R128A/K129A/D130A mutant. Our gel filtration results showed that the Y73A/L76A/Y80A mutant had essentially the same migration behavior as the C54S/C83A control, while the N101A/L104A/N108A and R128A/K129A/ D130A mutants actually migrated faster ( Fig 4B) . As a control, we made the K88A/K92A/ K95A mutant, changing three residues located outside of the dimer interface. As expected, the migration behavior of this mutant was nearly the same as that for the C54S/C83A protein ( Fig  4B) .

The results showed that the Y73A/L76A/Y80A and K88A/K92A/K95A mutants still interacted with Lsm11 NTD, while the L118A/I119A mutant could no longer interact with Lsm11 NTD (Fig 4C) , consistent with earlier data [28] . These experiments further demonstrated that the loss of binding between the FLASH NTD mutant and Lsm11 NTD is not linked to the dissociation of FLASH dimer.",

We co-expressed FLASH NTD C54S/C83A double mutant and His-tagged Lsm11 NTD (residues 23-130) in E. coli and purified their complex, demonstrating a stable interaction between the two proteins (S2 Fig) . Extensive efforts at producing diffraction quality crystals of the FLASH NTD-Lsm11 NTD complex have so far been unsuccessful. To obtain estimates for the molar masses of the FLASH NTD-Lsm11 NTD complex as well as the FLASH NTD C54S/C83A mutant alone, we performed size exclusion chromatography multi-angle light scattering (SEC-MALS) experiments using buffers with high (500 mM) and low (250 mM) NaCl concentrations ( Fig 5, S3 Fig) . At high-salt concentration, both the FLASH NTD-Lsm11 NTD complex and FLASH NTD alone eluted in single peaks. However, the FLASH NTD-Lsm11 NTD complex peak had a trailing edge, suggesting some dissociation of the complex during chromatography. The weight-averaged molar masses of the samples eluting in the peaks are 31 kDa for the FLASH NTD-Lsm11 NTD complex (with a Stokes radius of 3.9 nm) and 21 kDa for FLASH NTD C54S/C83A mutant alone (with a Stokes radius In the low-salt buffer, the positions of the peaks for both the FLASH NTD-Lsm11 NTD complex and FLASH NTD C54S/C83A mutant were slightly shifted to the left, suggesting a more extended structure for both. A small amount of higher order structures was present for the FLASH NTD-Lsm11 NTD complex suggesting the formation of aggregates in low-salt buffer condition. As in the high-salt buffer, the FLASH NTD-Lsm11 NTD complex peak had a trailing edge. The weight-averaged molar masses of the samples eluting in the peaks are 34.3 kDa for FLASH NTD-Lsm11 NTD complex (with a Stokes radius of 4.3 nm) and 21.8 kDa for FLASH NTD C54S/C83A (with a Stokes radius of 3.5 nm). Due to the presence of higher order structures, the molar mass of the FLASH NTD-Lsm11 NTD complex decreased gradually from 55 kDa and higher (leading edge of peak) to 26 kDa (trailing edge of peak). The FLASH NTD C54S/C83A molar mass decreased from 23.5 kDa (leading edge) to 19 kDa (trailing edge). Overall, the polydispersity of the FLASH NTD-Lsm11 NTD complex was slightly higher in low-salt buffer.",

We observed the strong presence of dimers for both FLASH wild-type and C54S/C83A double mutant and weaker presence of higher oligomers (trimer, tetramer etc.). The higher oligomers became less apparent at lower concentration (0.01 mg/mL) of the protein, suggesting that they are probably due to random collisions of monomer/dimer in solution. Dimer and trimer species were also observed for the FLASH NTD-Lsm11 NTD complex but Lsm11 NTD did not appear to be substantially crosslinked to FLASH or to itself, possibly due to the fact that it has only one lysine residue. Therefore, we conclude that the dimer and trimer species for the complex were probably crosslinked FLASH, as observed for the FLASH alone samples, and the cross-linking experiments by themselves did not provide conclusive information about the stoichiometry of FLASH NTD-Lsm11 NTD complex.",

Interestingly, the L118A/I119A mutation in the interface of the coiled-coil dimer failed to disrupt FLASH dimerization but was sufficient to abolish the ability of FLASH to interact with Lsm11. The N-terminal \u03b1-helical region that mediates FLASH dimerization overlaps substantially with the core Lsm11 binding site in FLASH mapped to amino acids 100-140, prompting the hypothesis that Lsm11 may interact with a FLASH dimer. SEC-MALS experiments on the complex provided strong evidence that the FLASH NTD-Lsm11 NTD complex is a 2:1 heterotrimer. While our AUC data confirmed that FLASH is a dimer, the stoichiometry of FLASH and Lsm11 in the FLASH NTD-Lsm11 NTD complex was less clear, likely due to dissociation of Lsm11 NTD from the FLASH NTD dimer during prolonged ultracentrifugation. Some dissociation of the complex was observed during the short time scale of the SEC-MALS experiment. That Lsm11 interacts with a FLASH dimer is also consistent with the data from H/D exchange experiments. While the region between amino acids 100-120 showed the slowest H/ D exchange within the entire FLASH NTD (which we show here can form a dimer), this region underwent slower H/D exchange in the presence of Lsm11 and the reduced rate of exchange extended to amino acid 130 in FLASH [33] . Since H/D exchange occurs when hydrogen bonds are temporarily destabilized, this region of FLASH (residues 100-130) is in a more stable structure in the heterotrimer than in the homodimer.",

In animal cells, components of the transcription and 3'-end processing machinery are localized in Histone Locus Bodies (HLBs), nuclear domains that assemble at histone gene loci and are present throughout the cell cycle. Strikingly, histone gene expression is repressed during G1 phase and becomes activated only with the onset of S phase and DNA replication in response to cell cycle signals, including cyclin E/ CDK2-mediated phosphorylation of NPAT, a universal coactivator of histone gene expression [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] . A growing body of evidence suggests that FLASH is targeted to HLBs as a separate entity rather than a subunit of the U7 snRNP. For example, mutations in either Lsm11 or FLASH that disrupt binding between their N-terminal domains do not affect localization of either FLASH or U7 snRNP to the Drosophila HLB, but abolishes processing in vivo [40, 41] .",

The cells were then loaded into the rotor and run at speed of 10,000, 15,000, and 25,000 rpm each for 12 h at 20\u02daC. Ten A 280 nm scans with time interval of 8-10 min were measured for every different rotor speed to check the status of sedimentation equilibrium.

A final concentration of 0.1% (w/v) of glutaraldehyde was added to 0.1 mg/mL (total volum\u1ebd 100 \u03bcL) and 0.01 mg/mL (total volume~1 mL) of FLASH NTD C54S/C83A-Lsm11 NTD complex, FLASH NTD C54S/C83A, and FLASH NTD wildtype. Controls with protein concentrations of 0.1 mg/mL without glutaraldehyde were set up for each sample type. All samples were incubated at 37\u02daC for 3 min then chilled on ice. A final concentration of about 100 mM of Tris pH 8.0 was added into each sample to quench the cross-linking reaction. All samples were concentrated to a volume~20 \u03bcL using Sartorius Vivaspin 1 500 centrifugal concentrators with a molecular weight cut off of 10 kDa and finally analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The speed of centrifugation for sedimentation equilibrium experiment (A) was 10,000 rpm (squares), 15,000 rpm (circles), and 25,000 rpm (triangles) at 20\u02daC each for 14 h. The velocity experiment (B) was 42,000 rpm (circles) at 20\u02daC for 6 h. The solid lines in two panels are the best fit results from global analysis of the two discrete species models by SEDPHAT (57) . The residuals of each fit are shown below the panels. The calculated sedimentation coefficients and M r from the best fit results are shown in Table 2 In the FLASH NTD-Lsm11 NTD complex, FLASH NTD is the lower band (as it lacks a His tag compared to FLASH NTD alone), and Lsm11 NTD is the upper band. While the FLASH NTD band disappeared in the presence of glutaraldehyde, the Lsm11 NTD band mostly stayed the same. Therefore, probably very small amount of Lsm11 NTD (if any) got crosslinked in the reaction, consistent with the fact that it has only 1 Lys residue. (TIF) S1 ",
