            "text": "Despite the clinical relevance, dengue virus (DENV) research has been hampered by the absence of robust reverse genetic systems to manipulate the viral serotypes for propagation and generation of mutant viruses. In this article, we describe application of an infectious clone system for DENV serotype 1 (DENV1). Similar to previous clones in both flaviviruses and coronaviruses, the approach constructs a panel of contiguous cDNAs that span the DENV genome and can be systematically and directionally assembled to produce viable, full-length viruses. Comparison of the virus derived from the infectious clone with the original viral isolate reveals identical sequence, comparable endpoint titers, and similar focus staining. Both focus-forming assays and percent infection by flow cytometry revealed overlapping replication levels in two different cell types. Moreover, serotype-specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) bound similarly to infectious clone and the natural isolate. Using the clone, we were able to insert a DENV4 type-specific epitope recognized by primate MAb 5H2 into envelope (E) protein domain I (EDI) of DENV1 and recover a viable chimeric recombinant virus. The recombinant DENV1 virus was recognized and neutralized by the DENV4 type-specific 5H2 MAb. The introduction of the 5H2 epitope ablated two epitopes on DENV1 EDI recognized by human MAbs (1F4 and 14C10) that strongly neutralize DENV1. Together, the work demonstrates the utility of the infectious clone and provides a resource to rapidly manipulate the DENV1 serotype for generation of recombinant and mutant viruses.",

Here we further characterize a novel and robust DENV serotype 1 (DENV1) infectious clone system that can be used to support basic and applied research. We demonstrate how the system can be used to probe the antigenic relationships between strains by creating viable recombinant viruses that display or lack major antibody epitopes. The DENV1 clone system and recombinant viruses can be used to analyze existing vaccine immune responses and inform second-generation bivalent vaccine designs. KEYWORDS antibody, dengue, epitope, infectious clone D engue viruses (DENVs) represent a significant threat to human health and the global economy, causing widespread and frequent epidemics (1, 2) . Transmitted by female mosquitos, the DENV family has four known serotypes that are genetically and antigenically related. Infection with any one DENV serotype typically produces asymptomatic or mild disease but induces long-term immunity against that serotype (3) . However, subsequent exposure to a different serotype may result in more-severe disease characterized by dengue hemorrhagic fever or dengue shock syndrome often attributed to antibody-dependent enhancement (2, 4) . Overall, potential adverse disease outcomes due to immune cross-reactivity complicates efforts to produce effective vaccines against the DENV family (5) .",

Flavivirus clones are difficult to maintain in bacteria and often result in sequence rearrangements or mutations that reduce expression of toxic elements from the viral genome. Several approaches have been employed to improve propagation, including use of low-copy-number plasmid (6), insertion into bacterial or yeast artificial chromosomes (13) (14) (15) , disruption of promoter regions in viral cDNA (16) , as well as microbe-free propagation approaches (17, 18) . However, these methods often diminish yields, produce changes in viral sequence, or require significant extraneous effort that reduces the overall utility of the approaches. Importantly, many of these reverse genetic systems report significant attenuation relative to their control wild-type (WT) viruses despite similar consensus sequencing (6).

Using the tetrapartite DENV1 molecular clone, we then inserted a known DENV4 envelope protein domain I (EDI) neutralization epitope and demonstrated efficient gain of neutralization function. However, by introducing these changes, we simultaneously ablated two known DENV1 antibody binding sites and disrupted their binding and neutralization.

Based on sequence from a laboratory strain of DENV1 West Pac '74, each segment is flanked by class IIS restriction endonuclease sites that cleave palindromic sequences into asymmetric 3-nucleotide overhangs. These overhangs permit directional assembly of the cleaved fragments to generate full-length viral cDNA. With the exception of an ablated restriction site (see Materials and Methods), the sequence directly reconstitutes the wild-type (WT) laboratory strain. The ligated cDNA fragments are then used as a template to produce full-length viral RNA, which is electroporated into C6/36 mosquito cells. To demonstrate transfection efficiencies of full-length transcripts, the results of the infectious center assay indicate low, but stable infection (0.4%) (Fig. 1B) . After several days, cell culture supernatant containing progeny rDENV1ic virions is harvested and passaged once on C6/36 cells to generate working virus stocks.",

While observing equivalent antibody binding between rDENV1ic and wild-type virus by ELISA, neutralization is an even more sensitive functional assay to compare viruses. Small changes in binding conformation may induce enhancement versus neutralization; as such, these assays must be equivalent between the infectious clone and the wild-type virus to justify the use of rDENVic for vaccine and immunogenicity studies. Using a focus reduction neutralization test (FRNT), we examined the ability of well-defined MAbs to block virus infectivity. For all three DENV1 monoclonal antibodies (1F4, 14C10, and 1C19.2), percent neutralization was nearly identical between the wild-type DENV1 and rDENV1ic ( Fig. 3A to C).

Extending studies to a U937\u03e9DC-SIGN flow-based neutralization assay, percent infection results revealed overlapping neutralization of rDENV1ic and wild-type DENV1 following DENV1 monoclonal antibody incubations ( Fig. S1A to C). In addition, none of the other DENV serotype-specific antibodies provides any significant reduction in viral infection (Fig. S1D to F) .

To use the rDENVic to study antibody responses to specific epitopes, we generated a DENV1 mutant virus that incorporates the DENV4 5H2 epitope into the DENV1 backbone virus. 5H2 is a DENV4 type-specific and strongly neutralizing MAb isolated from a nonhuman primate infected with DENV4 (24, 25) . A high-resolution structure of 5H2 bound to DENV4 E protein has led to the identification of 17 residues within EDI that interact with the antibody (Table 1) (24, 25) . Of these 17 amino acids, five are conserved between DENV1 and DENV4. The remaining 12 residues in DENV1 were replaced with those from DENV4, by manipulating plasmid A of the DENV1 infectious clone (rDENV1ic-5H2-epitope [rDENV1ic-EDI]) (Fig. 4A) ( Table 1 ). The DENV4 MAb 5H2 bound and neutralized the rDENV1ic-EDI virus ( Fig. 4B and C) . As the parental clone and wild-type DENV1 were not recognized by 5H2 (Fig. 4B and C) , these results confirm successful transfer of a conformational epitope from DENV4 into DENV1. Ablation of DENV1 monoclonal binding and neutralization. The epitope of DENV4 MAb 5H2 overlaps with the known DENV1 type-specific epitopes recognized by human neutralizing MAbs 1F4 and 14C10 (21) . Importantly, 1F4 has more than onethird of its predicted contact residues replaced in the rDENV1ic-EDI virus ( Fig. 5A and Table 1 ). Insertion of the DENV4 5H2 epitope partially disrupted the DENV1 1F4 epitope, resulting in an 80-fold reduction in 50% effective concentration (EC 50 ) but not complete ablation in binding of 1F4 to rDENV1ic-EDI (Fig. 5B) . Similarly, neutralization assays indicate that 1F4 nearly lost all of its ability to neutralize the rDENV1ic-EDI mutant (Fig. 5C) . MAb 14C10 has a smaller percentage (15%) of its epitope disrupted in the rDENV1ic-EDI virus ( Fig. 5D and Table 1 ), as it has additional contact residues in EDIII from the neighboring dimer that are maintained (Fig. S2) (26) . Despite this smaller percentage, binding of 14C10 is still reduced (Fig. 5E) , and 14C10 neutralization of TABLE 1 Virus amino acid sequences and MAb epitopes a a Amino acid sequences for wild-type rDENV1ic, rDENV4ic are shown with chimeric rDENV1ic-EDI residues highlighted in orange (DENV4 amino acids transplanted into the DENV1 backbone sequence). rDENV1ic-EDI virus that was recovered contained an additional mutation (light orange) unrelated to the transplanted 5H2 epitope. Contact residues for MAbs 5H2, 1F4, 14C10, and E103 are shown in green, magenta, purple, and cyan, respectively. rDENV1ic-EDI is mostly lost (Fig. 5F ). In contrast, DENV1 monoclonal antibody E103, which targets an EDIII epitope (Fig. 5G ) (27) , had no significant reduction in ELISA binding relative to wild-type virus or the infectious clone (Fig. 5H) . Additionally, MAb E103 maintained robust neutralization, indicating maintenance of other DENV1 epitopes within the mutant virus (Fig. 5I) . In summary, the introduction of the 5H2 epitope residues to create the rDENV1ic-EDI virus leads to efficient display of a heterologous DENV4 epitope and the disruption of two native DENV1 type-specific epitopes. Our results illustrate the utility of the infectious clone for transferring DENV epitopes between serotypes and identify functional consequences on other conserved epitopes within the transferred amino acid regions.",

            "text": "While a number of reverse genetic systems for dengue viruses have been developed, significant obstacles, including replication attenuation, sequence alteration, as well as labor-and cost-intensive techniques, have limited their utility (6) . In this study, we further characterize a novel DENV1 molecular clone platform that is patterned after coronavirus systems and describe additional details, including transcript infectivity and recombinant virus phenotypes in vitro (19, (28) (29) (30) (31) . Generating a panel of contiguous cDNAs that span the entire genome, the divided DENV1 reverse genetic system overcomes toxic elements within itself and allows propagation in bacteria. Importantly, directional assembly and in vitro transcription allow electroporation of full-length infectious RNA that directly corresponds to the wild-type virus sequence. As a result, the virus derived from the infectious clone maintains similar replication in multiple cell types (Fig. 1E to G) as well as complete fidelity in regard to antibody binding and virus neutralization ( Fig. 2 and 3) . Building on previous epitope swap mutants (19, 32) , we employed this reverse genetic system to generate a DENV1 viral mutant that displayed a known monoclonal antibody epitope from DENV4, gaining 5H2 monoclonal antibody binding and neutralization to the donor sequence strain. However, the mutant virus also disrupted binding and neutralization of two DENV1-specific monoclonal antibodies despite retaining the majority of their targeted antigenic residues (Table 1 and Fig. 5 ). While other DENV1-specific monoclonal antibodies maintain effective binding and neutralization (Fig. 5C) , the data highlight the opportunity cost of domain swaps even in the context of partial epitope disruption. Overall, the results also illustrate the utility of this newly developed infectious clone systems as a platform to study DENV1 infection, pathogenesis, and immunity.",

            "text": "For the DENV vaccine field, this reverse genetic system amplifies opportunities in virus design that are already being explored. Previous work by our lab has utilized the DENV2 and DENV4 infectious clones to define and transfer a critical antibody binding epitope in DENV2 identified by structural analysis (22, 32) . In this case, we described a recombinant DENV4 virus that displayed a heterologous DENV2 epitope, while preserving the major neutralizing epitopes on DENV4 (32) . In addition, previous work using this DENV1 infectious clone was able to transfer part of the DENV3 MAb 5J7 epitope, resulting in a partial gain of binding and neutralization by 5J7 but no loss of binding to DENV1 MAb 1F4 (19) . Importantly, both the DENV2 2D22 and DENV3 5J7 MAb epitopes are distinct from the 1F4 and 14C10 epitopes transplanted here. Coupled with data from the current study, the approach to disrupt epitopes within the context of live virus highlights an independent and powerful approach to quickly validate structural predictions of key residues. Importantly, full characterization of these viral epitopes and their portability between DENV serotypes open new approaches to vaccine development. This work defines a rationally designed chimeric virus that uses MAb-envelope structural interactions to identify residues associated with the DENV4 MAb 5H2 epitope that were sufficient for the gain of binding and neutralization. These changes lead to the disruption of multiple overlapping DENV1 epitopes, highlighting a potential problem that must be addressed in DENV vaccine design. Interestingly, despite maintaining nearly two-thirds of the DENV1 1F4 epitope in the chimeric virus, binding and neutralization were almost completely lost, indicating that the critical residue determinants for antibody interactions were among those that were changed. Another DENV1 MAb, 14C10, which maintained a much larger percentage of its epitope in the chimeric virus, lost a smaller amount of binding yet still lost nearly complete neutralization by 14C10. This suggests that while the remaining epitope can still be partially bound by 14C10, the interaction is insufficient to fully neutralize the virus. Structure-guided design could identify additional residues to further expand the transplanted DENV4 epitope to fully ablate DENV1 MAb and polyclonal binding and neutralization. Together, these data illustrate the utility of mapping epitopes using a combination of structure and reveres genetics. With a similar approach employed for human norovirus (33) (34) (35) (36) (37) , these resources can be applied to generate diagnostic reagents and to create a map of epitopes ideal for designing chimeric bivalent vaccines that produce broad-spectrum neutralization, a critical issue in DENV pathogenesis.",

Building on previous reports (19) , this clone system provides several important advantages to study DENV1, including robust propagation in bacteria, fidelity to wild-type sequence, and absence of replication attenuation. Importantly, both antibody binding and virus neutralization indicate uniform antigenicity with the wild-type strain permitting epitope mapping. Coupled with structural studies, the reverse genetic system can be manipulated to produce chimeric vaccines harboring conserved epitopes from multiple serotypes. While it is unlikely that neutralizing epitopes from all four serotypes could be combined into a single viable chimeric DENV virus, it is possible that two bivalent viruses that contain neutralizing epitopes from all four serotypes (e.g., rDENV1/3 and rDENV4/2) could be generated. This advance offers a promising strategy to produce broad protection against the DENV family.",

Briefly, the DENV1 genome was divided into four fragments and subcloned into separate cDNA plasmids with unique type IIS restriction endonuclease cleavage sites at the 5= and 3= ends of each fragment. A PflMI site was removed using standard molecular techniques. A T7 promoter was introduced into the 5= end of the plasmid A fragment, and plasmid DNA was grown in Escherichia coli cells. Purified plasmid DNA was enzyme digested, purified, and ligated together with T4 DNA ligase. Infectious genome-length capped viral RNA transcripts were generated with T7 polymerase. RNA was electroporated into C6/36 cells and incubated 4 to 6 days. Cell culture supernatant containing virus was harvested, centrifuged at maximum speed to remove cellular debris, and passaged onto C6/36 cells to generate a passage one virus stock.",
