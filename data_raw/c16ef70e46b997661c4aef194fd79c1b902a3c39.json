The electronic citation database PubMed, maintained by the U.S. National Library of Medicine, along with its mechanically printed predecessor, Index Medicus, have been a standard source of information on biomedical periodical publications since 1879. PubMed includes the content of the Cumulative Index Medicus and the older Current List of Medical Literature reaching back to 1946 [1] . In 2015, PubMed included greater than 24.6 million citations, with 765,850 works from 5642 journals newly indexed during fiscal year (FY) 2014 alone. In FY2014, the database was searched 2.7 billion times [2] . The growth of the international medical literature has been stunning, likely reflecting increased funding for biomedical research around the world. As of July 2015, PubMed included 161,882 citations published in 1964, 234,576 in 1974, 317,252 in 1984, 435,130 in 1994, 619,182 in 2004 and 1,088,434 in 2014. In addition to serving as an index for biomedical literature, PubMed data can be utilized to assess relative changes in the magnitude of the world's research infrastructure on a particular subject.",

There is a lack of surveillance data for MRSA in most countries including the United States. There does exist, however, robust surveillance for many other emerging and re-emerging pathogens. We wondered whether we could identify the incidence pattern of MRSA during the past 50 years by comparing its citation pattern to those of other pathogens.",

The start year was chosen as 1963 to correspond to the year of the first MRSA-related PubMed citation. Publicly available incidence data, which for some pathogens began in the year of their discovery after 1963, was also collected. Specifically, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website, CDC publications (including Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report [MMWR]), the Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO) website and the World Health Organization (WHO) website and publications were reviewed for data on the number of cases and the number of deaths in each year for each of the studied pathogens in the U.S. and worldwide [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . Incidence data were tabulated from these published sources. These data were overlaid on the graphs of citation trends for each pathogen with a second axis showing population-based incidence. Uniquely in the case of HIV/ AIDS, because of the change in definition of AIDS over time, we used U.S. mortality data. Incidence data for the remaining pathogens were reported either for the U.S. alone or for the entire world, depending on the quality of the available data or on the geographical locations of the greatest number of infections caused by each pathogen.",

For avian influenza, however, although the citation curve has a Type Ia pattern, there was no sudden epidemic of human infections caused by avian influenza strains during 2003-2006, but rather there was an increase in awareness and increase in the level of funding and surveillance worldwide for human infections with these strains [11] [12] [13] .",

AIDS, for example, was first identified as a distinct syndrome in 1981 [14] . It continues to spread slowly in the U.S. in 2015 while it remains a devastating disease in many parts of the developing world. The relative number of citations to HIV/AIDS peaked in 1998 at 28.36 per 1000 PubMed citations (Fig. 2) . This rise in the number of references to HIV/AIDS was likely associated with public interest in the disease, the incidence of the disease in the U.S. and funding provided to study the disease. The number of deaths from AIDS in the U.S. peaked in 1995, just as the number of publications peaked. After the rapid drop in mortality from AIDS in the U.S. in 1994-1996, with the development of highly active antiretroviral therapy, the number of deaths has continued to decline slowly [7] , as has the number of publications on HIV/AIDS relative to the total number of PubMed citations.",

Borrelia burgdorferi, the etiologic agent of Lyme disease, was discovered in 1981, several years after the clinical syndrome of Lyme disease was recognized, and this discovery led to a great increase in research efforts on the bacterium and on the disease it causes. It appears that research interest in the disease peaked after about a decade. Thereafter, the relative number of citations plateaued for the next decade, following a similar time course in its citation pattern to that of HIV, even as the number of reported U.S. cases of Lyme disease continued to rise steadily from 8257 in 1993 to 22,014 in 2012 [4] . Because deaths from Lyme disease are unusual, it is possible that the dynamics of funding for research on, and thus citations to, Lyme disease differed from those for HIV. WNV was discovered in Uganda in 1937, but there was a peak in relative citations only in 2004, when there were 0.61 citations to the virus per 1000 PubMed citations. WNV was studied before 2000 with a relatively small number of citations, never reaching 0.015 % of all PubMed citations between 1963 and 1999. Only after human cases were reported in the U.S., with an outbreak in New York City in 1999 [15] did the epidemic citation curve rise rapidly, reaching 0.06 % of all PubMed citations in 2003. After 2006, however, the relative number of citations declined. The pattern of reported WNV infection incidence, in contrast to the citation pattern for WNV and in contrast to both the incidence of Lyme disease and mortality from HIV in the U.S., appears to be cyclical, with increasingly higher annual incidence peaks recorded in 2003, 2006 and 2012 [4] .",

Local spread of the mosquito-borne disease was first noted on islands in the Caribbean in 2013, and greater than 440,000 cases had been diagnosed in the Americas by July 2014, including hundreds of secondary cases in Florida [16] . Discovered in Tanzania in 1953, Chikungunya had five PubMed citations in 1964 and just eight in 2005 although it persistently caused disease in Africa during this period. Once the disease started to spread gradually to new regions of the world, and especially to the Americas, there was a sharp rise in the absolute number of citations over a decade, reaching 170 in 2010 and 306 in 2014. In this case, as with WNV, novel geographic regions of spread, and particularly to developed countries, seemed to correlate with the number of citations in PubMed. However, qualitatively, the disease incidence also showed a steady rise that corresponded temporally to the rise in recorded incidence of and geographic spread of the disease.",

For Ebola, first discovered in 1976 in Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of Congo), by far the largest epidemic recorded has been in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea, resulting in more than 27,500 cases between March 2014 and July 2015, including isolated cases in Europe and the U.S. From its discovery until 2013, Ebola virus reappeared in periodic, limited outbreaks [6] . The 2014 epidemic resulted in an increase of nearly eight times in the relative number of citations in PubMed on the disease in 2014 (n = 892) compared with 2013 (n = 108), representing an enormous ramp-up in research and commentary on the virus by the biomedical research community. In contrast, SARS-related citations spiked immediately to more than 1200 in 2003 after the disease was discovered and then dropped off at a rate similar to the pattern for the other studied emerging diseases. The only recorded outbreaks of SARS occurred between November 2002 and April 2004 [17] . Similarly, MERS was first reported in Saudi Arabia during the autumn of 2012, resulting in a sudden spike in citations that persisted for the next two years, reflecting the persistence of new cases of the disease throughout the Middle East during 2013 and 2014 [18] .",

In 2014 and early 2015, there was a great increase in the number of H7N9 avian influenza A infections reported from China, likely reflecting primarily spread of the virus to people from poultry on farms [20] . Research on avian influenza after 2003 was driven by preparedness efforts in anticipation of the emergence of a pandemic strain.

MRSA has followed a trend in citations most similar to HIV/AIDS, which may suggest that the impact of MRSA disease peaked in 2009 or 2010 and began trending down in 2011. There is some evidence that the incidence of CA-MRSA infections in the U.S., the country in the world that probably had the highest incidence, has decreased after 2008 or 2009 [21] [22] [23] , corresponding with the decrease in the relative number of PubMed citations. However, in the absence of national surveillance data, trends in CA-MRSA incidence can only be inferred from local studies. Healthcare-associated invasive MRSA infections, however, did decrease in incidence in the U.S. after 2005 [24] as did MRSA bacteremia incidence both in the UK after 2006 [25] and in Taiwan after 2005 [26] .

For HIV/AIDS, the decline occurred after 1998, and for MRSA, this occurred after 2010. While HIV/AIDS stabilized in the absolute number of citations in 1999-2014, there are not yet adequate data available to determine if citations to MRSA would follow the same pattern after reaching a peak level per 1000 PubMed citations.DiscussionThe number of yearly publications on MRSA identified by our search strategy increased dramatically, rising more than four-fold from 501 in 2000 to 2148 by the end of 2014. On average, there were more than five citations to MRSA added to PubMed each day during 2014. Even accounting for the growing number of citations added to PubMed each year, the number related to MRSA more than doubled between 2000 and 2009, from 0.94 to 2.32 per 1000 citations in PubMed. The reasons for this massive growth in the publication rate, presumably reflecting increasing research on MRSA epidemiology, pathogenesis, prevention, antimicrobial resistance, virulence, immunity and therapy, may have resulted from a number of factors, including increased funding, interest among researchers and the increase in the incidence of disease caused by MRSA, particularly outside of the healthcare setting in the U.S. and certain other countries. To what extent is this dramatic rise in the number of publications related only to an increased level of attention by researchers and to what extent is it a reflection of true epidemiologic change?",
