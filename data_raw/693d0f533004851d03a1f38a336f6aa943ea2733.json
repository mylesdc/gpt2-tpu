            "text": "Virus-induced apoptosis and viral mechanisms that regulate this cell death program are key issues in understanding virushost interactions and viral pathogenesis. Like many other human and animal viruses, coronavirus infection of mammalian cells induces apoptosis. In this study, the global gene expression profiles are first determined in IBV-infected Vero cells at 24 hours post-infection by Affymetrix array, using avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) as a model system. It reveals an up-regulation at the transcriptional level of both pro-apoptotic Bak and pro-survival myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1). These results were further confirmed both in vivo and in vitro, in IBV-infected embryonated chicken eggs, chicken fibroblast cells and mammalian cells at transcriptional and translational levels, respectively. Interestingly, the onset of apoptosis occurred earlier in IBV-infected mammalian cells silenced with short interfering RNA targeting Mcl-1 (siMcl-1), and was delayed in cells silenced with siBak. IBV progeny production and release were increased in infected Mcl-1 knockdown cells compared to similarly infected control cells, while the contrary was observed in infected Bak knockdown cells. Furthermore, IBV infection-induced up-regulation of GADD153 regulated the expression of Mcl-1. Inhibition of the mitogenactivated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK/ERK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K/Akt) signaling pathways by chemical inhibitors and knockdown of GADD153 by siRNA demonstrated the involvement of ER-stress response in regulation of IBV-induced Mcl-1 expression. These results illustrate the sophisticated regulatory strategies evolved by a coronavirus to modulate both virus-induced apoptosis and viral replication during its replication cycle.",

            "text": "Virus-induced eukaryotic cell death typically follows one of the two paths: apoptosis or necrosis. The execution of either one or the other in virus-infected cells, thus, reflects the pathogenicity of viruses [1] . Apoptosis is a highly conserved and strictly controlled physiological process by which unwanted cells are selectively eliminated. This mechanism also plays a critical role in normal development [2] , stress response and adaptation [3] . Apoptotic cells undergo many distinct morphological and biochemical changes. Nuclear and/or cytoplasmic condensation, as well as membrane protrusion, is initiated. Nuclear fragmentation then follows suit, resulting in the subsequent encapsulation of these fragments into apoptotic bodies that are rapidly and unobtrusively phagocytosed without eliciting an inflammatory response [4] . Necrosis, in contrast, is not self initiated but instead arises from an insult or injury to the cell, such as cytotoxicity or mechanical damage [5] . Characteristics of necrosis include significantly less DNA degradation as compared to apoptosis and a major loss of membrane integrity, resulting in leakage of cell contents and eliciting an inflammatory response from the surrounding cells [6] .",

            "text": "Apoptotic mitochondrial events are regulated primarily through the activation of pro-survival and pro-apoptotic proteins [7] . The Bcl-2 (B cell lymphoma-2) family of proteins constitutes a critical control point in the regulation of apoptosis. They form three major protein subgroups: the BH3 (Bcl-2 homology)-only proteins (e.g., Bid, Bad), Bax-like proteins (e.g., Bax, Bak) and the Bcl-2-like factors (e.g., Mcl-1, Bcl-X L ) [8] . BH3-only and Bax-like proteins are essential initiators of apoptosis while the Bcl-2-like proteins are pro-survival factors that safeguard the cells against apoptosis. An increase in the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins of the Bcl-2 family such as Bax and Bak, which can form pores in the outer mitochondrial membrane, induces the efflux of cytochrome-c from the mitochondria into the cytosol [9] . Cytochrome-c then complexes with Apaf-1 and pro-caspase 9 to activate caspase 9, which leads to the subsequent activation of caspase-3 and -7 [10] . Bak and Bax can also be recruited to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and initiate apoptosis in response to stress [11] . On the other hand, Bak heterodimerization with Bcl-2-like anti-apoptotic factors, such as Mcl-1 and Bcl-X L , suppresses Bak homooligomerization and pore formation in unstressed, healthy cells [12, 13] .",

            "text": "Apoptosis is also an important antiviral defense mechanism of the host cell that leads to the abortion of virus infection and consequently limits viral productivity and infectivity [14] . However, certain viruses have evolved strategies to both counteract and induce apoptosis in order to maximize the production of virus progeny and promote its spread to neighbouring cells. An increasing number of viruses from different families, including two coronaviruses, has been found to induce apoptosis during their infection cycles, which may possibly contribute to the cytotoxicity associated with virus infections [15] . Specifically, the avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) has been shown to induce caspase-dependent apoptosis in infected African green monkey Vero cells [16] . As important pathogens of both human and animals, coronaviruses are generally associated with respiratory diseases, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [17] . IBV is the etiological agent of infectious bronchitis, an acute disease that renders the respiratory and urogenital tracts of chicken irreparable [18, 19] . While it extensively destroys the mucosae of the respiratory tract, the impact of IBV infection is greatly magnified as a consequence of its enhancement of diseases associated with co-infections by bacteria and mycoplasmas [20, 21] . Although IBV is an avian virus, it is reported to adapt well to primate cells and has also been shown to infect human and animal cells [22, 23] . DNA damage response is one strategy IBV employs to trigger DNA replication stress in IBV-infected cells, subsequently leading to cell cycle arrest [24] . Recent reports have also shown the upregulation of dual-specificity phosphatase 1 (DUSP1), which negatively regulates p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, culminating in the suppression of excessive induction of the pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 [25] . However, the mechanisms by which IBV induces and regulates apoptosis remain under investigation.",

Using IBV as a model system, we investigated the underlying effects of pro-and anti-apoptotic protein expression on coronavirus infectivity and virus-induced apoptosis through systematic characterization of Bak and Mcl-1 expression at both transcriptional and translational levels in IBV-infected cells. We showed that IBV infection up-regulated Bak and Mcl-1 at both transcriptional and translational levels. We also checked the expression levels of Bak and Mcl-1 in IBV-infected chicken embryos and chicken fibroblast cells and confirmed a similar upregulation trend at the transcriptional level. Targeted Bak and Mcl-1 down-regulation by siRNA revealed that IBV progeny production was enhanced in cells depleted of the pro-survival Mcl-1 protein and decreased in that of the pro-apoptotic Bak. Furthermore, IBV-induced apoptosis appeared earlier in Mcl-1 knockdown cells, and later in Bak knockdown cells, indicating the possibility that Mcl-1 and Bak may play diverging roles in the regulation of coronavirus-induced apoptosis. Lastly, we studied the upstream signaling pathways leading to infection-mediated Mcl-1 induction and identified components of the MAP/ERK, PI3K/ Akt and GADD153 in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress pathways as potential modulators.",

This zinc-dependent eukaryotic DNAbinding protein specifically recognizes DNA strand breaks produced by genotoxic agents, and is normally involved in DNA repair, DNA stability and other cellular events. It is one of the substrates cleaved by members of the caspase family during early apoptosis, and detection of the caspase cleavage fragment (85 kDa) of PARP has long been considered to be a hallmark of apoptosis [34] . Using siEGFP as a negative control, Western blot analysis, followed by densitometry measurements, of H1299 and Huh7 cells infected with IBV showed that Mcl-1 and Bak expression were specifically decreased by siMcl-1 and siBak, respectively, in both H1299 and Huh7 cells (Fig. 3B) . Interestingly, the detection of the 85 kDa PARP cleavage fragment in both cell lines appeared to be inversely correlated with Mcl-1 expression levels. As shown in Fig. 4B , a significantly more amount of the cleavage product was detected in IBV-infected, Mcl-1 knockdown H1299 (29%) and Huh7 (30%) cells at 20 hours post-infection, compared to the same infected cell lines treated with either siBak (0% in both cell lines) or siEGFP (23% in H1299 and 0% in Hun7). The same trend was also observed at 24 hours post-infection, although more cleavage product was detected in siEGFP-treated Huh7 cells (Fig. 3B) . As no significant amount of Mcl-1 was observed in siEGFPtransfected H1299 and Huh7 cells at 24 hours post-infection (Fig. 3B) , it may suggest rapid proteasome degradation of the protein as observed previously.",

The appearance of the PARP cleavage fragment in Bak-silenced Huh7 cells at 24 hours post-infection, albeit at lower levels as those in similarly infected Mcl-1 and EGFP knockdown Huh7 cells, could be attributed to a slight decrease in Mcl-1 expression in the Bak knockdown cells (Fig. 3B) .

GADD153, also known as C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), is a pro-apoptotic transcription factor and well-known component of several ER stress-mediated pathways, including the MAP/ERK pathway [35, 36, 37] . Induction of GADD153 has been found to regulate different members of the Bcl-2 family [3, 38] . Downstream of the ER stress-mediated up-regulation of GADD153 expression is a correlated suppression of Akt signaling [39] . The activation of the latter is, in turn, known to up-regulate Mcl-1 through its Akt kinase [40] . Induction of GADD153 in IBV-infected cells was observed (data not shown). To elucidate the regulatory roles, if any, for GADD153 in the induction of Mcl-1, H1299 cells transfected with either siRNA duplexes targeting GADD153 (siGADD153) or a non-targeting control (siControl) were infected with IBV at an M.O.I of 1 for 16-20 hours and harvested for Western blot analysis, followed by densitometry measurements. We observed a corresponding reduction in the expression of Mcl-1 (40-73% down-regulation) with a decreased GADD153 expression (21-27% knockdown efficiencies) in IBVinfected cells, alongside a 66-98% reduction in viral replication efficiency, compared to that in infected control cells (Fig. 5B ). These results suggest the possible involvement of many signaling pathways in the modulation of Mcl-1 induction, including MAP/ERK and ER stress, leading to the regulation of virusinduced apoptosis.",

We observed that knockdown of either Bak or Mcl-1 renders minimal, if any, effects on the replication and transcription of IBV RNA.

            "text": "Viral regulation of programmed cell death is a sophisticated process [1] . It is also a complex aspect of viral pathogenesis. In the past few decades, numerous viruses have been shown to manipulate various apoptotic pathways to their own advantage [41] . Viruses may inhibit apoptosis during the initial stages of infection so as to garner enough time to multiply and disperse rapidly from the plasma membrane to infect other cells [42] . Yet, viruses may just as easily infect a cell, elicit apoptosis, and spread to neighbouring cells through phagocytosis of the resulting apoptotic bodies while cleverly minimizing an immune response at the same time [43] . It has also been previously reported that SARS-CoV induces apoptosis as well, both in vitro and in vivo, which might account for the destruction of lung epithelial cells in infected patients [44] . A moderate enhancement effect on viral protein synthesis and viral particle release was observed in Mcl-1 knockdown cells infected with IBV in the late stages of infection. As Mcl-1 is unlikely involved in direct viral RNA replication and protein synthesis, the detection of more viral protein expression in Mcl-1 knockdown cells than that in the control cells at these time points would be due to the fact that more infectious viral particles were released from the primary infection. Subsequently, these viruses could infect more neighboring cells during secondary and tertiary infections, resulting in the detection of more viral proteins. In fact, minor, if any, differences in viral RNA replication and protein synthesis were observed at the earlier stages of infection, lending support to this conclusion. On the other hand, the minimal to moderate regulatory effect observed in Mcl-1 knockdown cells may not truthfully reflect the actual impact of Mcl-1 up-regulation on viral replication and pathogenesis in the infected animals. This issue can be addressed only in Mcl-1 knockout mouse or other suitable animal models. Nevertheless, it appears that up-regulation of Mcl-1 in IBV-infected cells, as characterized here, may represent an effective host anti-coronavirus response that regulates viral infectivity and productivity.",

As explained earlier, Mcl-1 has a short half-life as it undergoes polyubiquitination and subsequent proteasome degradation. The down-regulation observed during late stages of virus infection may be due to the rapid degradation of the protein. It also suggests that, unlike in Chlamydia trachomatis-infected cells [46] , IBV infection does not stabilize Mcl-1 protein, particularly in human cells. Another reason is that more efficient viral replication and infection are usually observed in these two cell lines, especially in Huh7 cells, compared to that in Vero cells, leading to the destruction of the monolayers and degradation of cellular RNAs.",

Mcl-1 activation can also be triggered by many signaling events, including MAPK pathways, PI3K/AKT pathway, growth factors and cell stress [3, 11, 35, 46] . From our data, it appears that the induction of Mcl-1 protein in IBV-infected cells is indeed affected by the activation of MEK and/or PI3K pathways, as well as by upstream activators such as the transcriptional regulator of ER-stress mediated apoptosis, GADD153. In a previous study, we showed IBV infection induced the expression of GADD34 [48] , indicating activation of the double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinaselike ER kinase (PERK) branch of the unfolded protein response (UPR) in IBV-infected cells. The observed up-regulation of GADD153 in IBV-infected cells in this study would lend further support to this conclusion. ER stress also activates the inositolrequiring enzyme 1 (IRE1) branch of the UPR, which, other than its role in the cleavage and degradation of misfolded proteins, serves to transcriptionally up-regulate Mcl-1 through its downstream activation of the PI3k/Akt pathway [49, 50] . The induction of Mcl-1, likely the consequence of a combination of viral RNA replication, protein synthesis and cellular signal cascades triggered by all these events, would then attenuate Bak activation and subsequent apoptosis.",

With the ability of viruses to behave as oncolytic, apoptosis-inducing agents [43] and the rapid advances in molecular biology, apoptotic viral genes can be harnessed as vectors and targeted to tumor cells as a potential anti-cancer therapeutic benefit [51] . Degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and Huntingdon's disease may also be similarly treated with anti-apoptotic viral genes [1] . Investigating the relationship between Bcl2 family proteins and IBV-induced apoptosis may lead to further refinement of the virotherapy concept [52] to develop safer, virally-derived gene therapies that will target cancer cells with more discrimination.",

H1299 (upper panel) and Huh7 cells (lower panel) were transfected with siRNA duplexes targeting Mcl-1, Bak or EGFP. At 72 hours post-transfection, cells were infected with IBV and harvested at 20 and 24 hours post-infection. M, mock infection.

The involvement of MAP/ERK and PI3K kinase pathways in regulation of IBV-induced Mcl-1 was first studied by infection of Vero and H1299 cells with IBV at an M.O.I. of 2 in the presence or absence of either 20 mM of MAP/ ERK kinase MEK-1 inhibitor U0126 or 40 mM of PI3K inhibitor LY294002. Mcl-1 induction was quantitatively defined by realtime RT-PCR at 16 hours post-infection, showing that both U0126 and LY294002 significantly reduced the Mcl-1 induction in both cell lines, compared to the control cells treated with DMSO alone",

            "text": "In this study, global gene expression profiles have been first determined in IBV-infected Vero cells at 24 hours post-infection by Affymetrix array, revealing an up-regulation at the transcriptional level of both pro-apoptotic Bak and pro-survival Mcl-1. These results were further confirmed in IBV-infected chicken embryos and chicken fibroblast DF1 cells, as well as mammalian cells such as H1299, Vero and Huh7 cells. As apoptosis is influenced, both positively and negatively, by a variety of genes including various members of the Bcl2 gene family[45], upregulation of Bak and Mcl-1 may play essential roles in maintaining the intricate balance between life and death of infected cells to ensure a successful infection cycle. Our data show that IBV viral protein release was increased in cells with knockdown of the anti-apoptotic Mcl-1 protein, and in cells over-expressing the pro-apoptotic Bak protein. Likewise, PARP cleavage occurs earlier in cells depleted of Mcl-1, and in cells with elevated levels of Bak. This points to the importance of these two members of the Bcl2 family in regulating IBV-induced apoptosis, especially at an early stage of infection. Mcl-1 and Bak also appear to be involved in regulating viral replication efficiency at late stages of infection, as a decrease in Mcl-1 expression levels and an increase in that of Bak promote virus progeny release. A tricky balance between the two may therefore be a key requisite in first maintaining the integrity of the host cell environment during infection before the conclusion of a triumphant infection cycle.",
