            "text": "The outbreak of pneumonia originating in Wuhan, China, has generated 24,500 confirmed cases, including 492 deaths, as of 5 February 2020. The virus (2019-nCoV) has spread elsewhere in China and to 24 countries, including South Korea, Thailand, Japan and USA. Fortunately, there has only been limited human-to-human transmission outside of China. Here, we assess the risk of sustained transmission whenever the coronavirus arrives in other countries. Data describing the times from symptom onset to hospitalisation for 47 patients infected early in the current outbreak are used to generate an estimate for the probability that an imported case is followed by sustained human-to-human transmission. Under the assumptions that the imported case is representative of the patients in China, and that the 2019-nCoV is similarly transmissible to the SARS coronavirus, the probability that an imported case is followed by sustained human-to-human transmission is 0.41 (credible interval [0.27, 0.55]). However, if the mean time from symptom onset to hospitalisation can be halved by intense surveillance, then the probability that an imported case leads to sustained transmission is only 0.012 (credible interval [0, 0.099]). This emphasises the importance of current surveillance efforts in countries around the world, to ensure that the ongoing outbreak will not become a global pandemic.",

Since then, cases have been recorded in other countries, and initial estimates suggest a hospital fatality risk of around 14% [6] , although estimates of disease severity early in an outbreak are often imprecise [7] [8] [9] . Even countries without confirmed cases have been on high alert. For example, even prior to the two cases in the United Kingdom on 31 January 2020, officials were reported to be attempting to trace as many as 2000 visitors that had travelled to that country from Wuhan [10] .",

We fit an exponential distribution to these data, accounting for uncertainty due to the limited numbers of patients from whom data were available. Assuming that this distribution characterises the time spent by infected hosts generating new transmissions in the community, it is then possible to infer the probability that a case arriving in a new location is followed by an outbreak driven by sustained human-to-human transmission. We estimate this probability under the assumption that the transmissibility of the 2019-nCoV is similar to that of the SARS coronavirus, and then go on to consider the effect of shortening the mean time from symptom onset to hospitalisation. This provides an estimate of the risk that imported cases generate sustained outbreaks in new locations under different surveillance levels.",

Since the precise times of symptom onset and hospitalisation on the dates concerned were unknown, we converted the times from symptom onset to hospitalisation to intervals describing possible time periods (see the Supplementary Data). For example, for a case showing symptoms on 9 January 2020, and then being hospitalised on 14 January 2020, the time between symptom onset and hospitalisation lies between four and six days (see e.g., Supplementary Material of [16] for a similar calculation). This is because the minimum possible period involves symptom onset at the end of 9 January and hospitalisation at the start of 14 January, whereas the maximum possible period involves symptom onset early on 9 January and hospitalisation late on 14 January.",

In this branching process, the effective reproduction number (accounting for control interventions, other than intensified surveillance which we model explicitly) of the 2019-nCoV when the virus arrives in a new location is denoted by R = \u03b2/\u03b3, where the parameter \u03b2 represents pathogen transmissibility [20] . We assumed that the transmissibility of the virus is similar to that of the SARS coronavirus, i.e., \u03b2 = R SARS \u03b3 SARS , where R SARS = 3 [21] and the mean infection duration for SARS is 1/\u03b3 SARS = 3.8 days [22] . However, we adjusted the infectious period to account for the data describing the times between symptom onset and hospitalisation in the current outbreak. In doing this, we assumed that the time between an individual first displaying symptoms and being hospitalised was the period in which that individual was potentially transmitting the virus in the community.",

We made the assumption that symptom appearance coincides with the onset of infectiousness. One of the features of the SARS outbreak in 2002-2003 that allowed it to eventually be brought under control was the low proportion of onward transmissions occurring either prior to symptoms or from asymptomatic infectious hosts [26] . It might be hoped that infections due to the 2019-nCoV share this characteristic. Some reports have suggested that this may not be the case, although the extent of presymptomatic transmission is disputed [25, 27] .

Our results might therefore be viewed as an upper bound on the risk posed by the 2019-nCoV. As the outbreak continues, it might be expected that the time from symptom onset to hospitalisation or isolation will decrease, leading to lower risks of sustained transmission, as has been observed for outbreaks of other diseases (e.g., the ongoing outbreak of Ebola virus disease in the Democratic Republic of the Congo). Initial indications suggest that such a decrease is occurring in China for this outbreak. In contrast, there may be some individuals that developed symptoms, but had not yet reported their infection by the time our analysis was conducted. \"Right censoring\" in this way favours lower reporting times, and so falsely reduces estimates of the time between symptom onset and hospitalisation [16, 28] .",

One example might be to consider spatial variation in host population densities and surveillance levels, leading to spatially inhomogeneous outbreak risks. Another possibility might be to account more explicitly for heterogeneities between different infectors, either by incorporating \"superspreaders\" [29] in the model or by differentiating between individuals that report disease at different rates. Such heterogeneity might be expected to reduce the risk of sustained transmission (for a preliminary analysis, in which individuals can either be \"fast reporters\" or \"slow reporters\", see the Supplementary Text). It would also be possible to differentiate between mild and severe cases in the model. On the one hand, a mild case might be more likely to go unnoticed than a severe case, potentially leading to a higher outbreak risk. On the other hand, mild infections may generate fewer secondary cases than severe infections, thereby decreasing the outbreak risk. Complex interactions may therefore affect the risk of sustained transmission in an unpredictable fashion.",
