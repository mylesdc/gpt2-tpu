            "text": "Feline herpesvirus 1 (FHV-1), an enveloped dsDNA virus, is one of the major pathogens of feline upper respiratory tract disease (URTD) and ocular disease. Currently, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) remains the gold standard diagnostic tool for FHV-1 infection but is relatively expensive, requires well-equipped laboratories and is not suitable for field tests. Recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), an isothermal gene amplification technology, has been explored for the molecular diagnosis of infectious diseases. In this study, an exo-RPA assay for FHV-1 detection was developed and validated. Primers targeting specifically the thymidine kinase (TK) gene of FHV-1 were designed. The RPA reaction was performed successfully at 39\u02daC and the results were obtained within 20 min. Using different copy numbers of recombinant plasmid DNA that contains the TK gene as template, we showed the detection limit of exo-RPA was 10 2 copies DNA/reaction, the same as that of real time PCR. The exo-RPA assay did not cross-detect feline panleukopenia virus, feline calicivirus, bovine herpesvirus-1, pseudorabies virus or chlamydia psittaci, a panel of pathogens important in feline URTD or other viruses in Alphaherpesvirinae, demonstrating high specificity. The assay was validated by testing 120 nasal and ocular conjunctival swabs of cats, and the results were compared with those obtained with real-time PCR. Both assays provided the same testing results in the clinical samples. Compared with real time PCR, the exo-RPA assay uses less-complex equipment that is portable and the reaction is completed much faster. Additionally, commercial RPA reagents in vacuum-sealed pouches can tolerate temperatures up to room temperature for days without loss of activity, suitable for shipment and storage for field tests. Taken together, the exo-RPA assay is a simple, fast and cost-effective alternative to real time PCR, suitable for use in less advanced laboratories and for field detection of FHV-1 infection.",

            "text": "Feline herpesvirus 1 (FHV-1), an enveloped double-stranded DNA virus, belongs to the Varicellovirus genus of the subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae [1] . It is the major pathogen of feline upper respiratory tract disease (URTD) and ocular disease. It is estimated that FHV-1 infection accounts for approximately 50-75% of URTD in susceptible cats and more than 90% of the cats are seropositive to FHV-1 [2, 3] . So far, only one serotype of FHV-1 has been identified but its distribution is worldwide [1] . Like other alpha herpesviruses, FHV-1 induces latency in the trigeminal ganglions after the primary infection and the latent virus can be activated by stress and other factors that compromise host immune function [1, 4] . About 45% of latently infected cats shed virus periodically [5] Different diagnostic methods for FHV-1 infection have been described. Virus isolation can be applied for the diagnosis of acute FHV-1 infection. However, it often yields false negative results for FHV-1 detection in latent infection. As over 90% of cats are seropositive to FHV-1, and seroprevalence does not vary significantly among clinically normal and diseased cats, it is believed that antibody testing hardly aids the diagnosis of FHV-1 infection [3] . Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) remains the gold standard diagnostic tool for FHV-1 infection with real time PCR having higher sensitivity than conventional PCR [2, [6] [7] [8] .",

The RPA process employs three enzymes-a recombinase, a single-stranded DNA-binding protein (SSB) and a strand-displacing polymerase. The recombinase is capable of pairing oligonucleotide primers with homologous sequence in the target DNA. SSB then binds to the displaced strand of DNA and prevents the dissociation of primers. Finally, the strand displacing polymerase begins DNA synthesis where the primer has bound to the target DNA. With the use of two opposing primers, exponential amplification of the target sequence with RPA can be achieved at a constant temperature in 10-20 min. The RPA product can be measured in realtime using different probes with fluorescence detection device. In this study, using the fluorescent TwistAmp 1 exo Probe (TwistDX, Cambridge, UK), we developed and validated a realtime RPA assay for rapid and specific detection of FHV-1.",

All reagents except for the template and magnesium acetate were prepared in a master mix, which was distributed into each 0.2 ml reaction tube containing a dried enzyme pellet. One \u03bcL of nucleic acid template was added to the tubes. Subsequently, magnesium acetate was pipetted into the tube lids, the lids were closed carefully, and magnesium acetate was centrifuged into the rehydrated material using a minispin centrifuge. The sample was vortexed briefly and spun down. The tubes were immediately placed in the Genie III Instrument (OptiGene Limited, West Sussex, UK) and incubated at 39\u02daC for 20 min. The fluorescence signal was monitored in real-time. A cutoff value of 3000 (fluorescence signal at the Y-axis, see Figs 1 and 2A) after 20 min of amplification was established to distinguish positive from negative results.",

Real time PCR was also performed using 1 \u03bcL of each dilution as the template. Real time PCR primers and the probe were designed according to the published sequence (GenBank: FJ478159) as follows: forward primer, 5'-GGACAGCATAAAAGCGATTG-3'; reverse primer, 5'-AACGTGAACAACGACGC AG-3'; and the probe, 5'-FAM-AATTCCAGCCCGGAGCCTCAAT-BHQ1-3'. Primers and the probe were synthesized by Takara Bio Inc. Real time PCR was performed using the Premix Ex Taq Master Mix (Takara Bio Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instruction. The reaction was completed on the ABI 7500 Real-Time PCR System in following steps, 95\u02daC for 3 min and then 40 cycles of 95\u02daC for 15 s and 60\u02daC for 30 s. The fluorescent dye FAM was used as a reporter dye in real time PCR. The dye can incorporate into the amplified product, and the fluorescent intensity is proportional with the relative amount of the PCR product, which can be measured in real time and is reflected by the Y-axis value, so called delta Rn value, on a real time PCR plot. The Rn value stands for normalized reporter value. The delta Rn value is the Rn value of an experimental reaction minus the Rn value of the baseline signal generated by the instrument. A cutoff Delta Rn value of 2.000e + 005 (see Fig 2B) after 40 cycles of amplification was established to distinguish positive from negative results. 2.000e + 005 is a notation for 2 x 10 5 . The \"N+m\" formula, where n and m are numbers, is commonly used for a very high number. The format \"2.000e + 005\" was generated automatically by the PCR machine. The sensitivity between the RPA reaction and real time PCR was compared. The results from 5 independent reactions using the lowest detectable copy number of the template (10 2 ) were statistically analyzed and the co-efficient of variations was calculated to determine the reproducibility of the assay.",

The co-efficient of variations from 5 independent reactions (10 2 copies of template) was demonstrated in Table 1 , showing high reproducibility for both real time PCR and the RPA assay.

They used agarose gel electrophoresis together with ethidium bromide staining to visualize the PCR product and observed that as low as 3x10 3 copies of FHV-1 genomic DNA could be detected. Weigler et al developed a real time PCR method for FHV-1 detection, which had a detection limit of 240 copies of FHV-1 DNA [7] , in line with our results obtained with real time PCR and the RPA assay. Compared with real time PCR, RPA has several advantages. First, RPA reactions are done at a constant temperature, requiring less-complex instrument. Secondly, RPA reactions are usually completed in 10-20 min, much faster than real time PCR that often takes > 60 min. Thirdly, commercial RPA reagents in vacuum-sealed pouches can tolerate temperatures up to room temperature for days without loss of activity (http://www.twistdx.co. uk/images/uploads/docs/TA01cmanual_Combined_Manual_RevI.pdf), eliminating the need of complex shipment and storage containers, which is convenient and fitting for field performance of rapid point-of-care diagnostic tests. Lastly, it has been shown that RPA primers and probes carrying 5-9 base pair mismatches do not influence the performance of RPA reactions [13, 19] , while such base pair mismatches can cause real-time PCR small probes to fail [20] .",
