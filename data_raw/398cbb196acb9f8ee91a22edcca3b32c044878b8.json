            "text": "Attenuated, live viral vaccines have been extraordinarily successful in protecting against many diseases. The main drawbacks in their development and use have been reliance on an unpredictable method of attenuation and the potential for evolutionary reversion to high virulence. Methods of genetic engineering now provide many safer alternatives to live vaccines, so if live vaccines are to compete with these alternatives in the future, they must either have superior immunogenicity or they must be able to overcome these former disadvantages. Several live vaccine designs that were historically inaccessible are now feasible because of advances in genome synthesis. Some of those methods are addressed here, with an emphasis on whether they enable predictable levels of attenuation and whether they are stable against evolutionary reversion. These new designs overcome many of the former drawbacks and position live vaccines to be competitive with alternatives. Not only do new methods appear to retard evolutionary reversion enough to prevent vaccine-derived epidemics, but it may even be possible to permanently attenuate live vaccines that are transmissible but cannot evolve to higher virulence under prolonged adaptation.",

These vaccines consist of infectious viruses that establish a limited infection in the patient, mimicking infection by the wild-type virus enough to elicit an immune response but not enough to cause disease. They may also be transmitted to people other than those vaccinated. The attenuated viral populations created in this fashion, whether within or among patients, are thus subject to natural selection to improve viral growth rate. Any consequent evolution is usually antithetical to their intended use, possibly reversing the attenuation. The purpose of this article is to consider some of the major ways to engineer live vaccines, especially with respect to the ability to limit this post-engineering evolution. Viral evolution is not an issue with killed vaccines or with subunit vaccines in which the vector cannot create infectious virus in the host, so those types of vaccines are not considered here.",

The oral polio vaccine (OPV) consists of three viral strains, each attenuated for low virulence. The risk of disease from the vaccine is maybe 1 in 750,000 recipients, and the immunity is lifelong (Burns et al. 2014 ). This vaccine was responsible for polio eradication in the Americas and Europe (Nathanson and Kew 2010; Kew 2012) . But one serotype is only two mutations away from attenuation reversal, another is three mutations away. In countries with intermittent vaccine coverage, the vaccine has evolved reversal of the attenuation many times, causing epidemics and even establishing itself endemically (Kew 2012) . With current political constraints, a safer OPV that does not easily revert yet still stimulates mucosal immunity would be highly desirable. Can synthetic biology give us a better live vaccine?",

Many new methods for creating vaccines exist, some which combine benefits of older methods without the drawbacks. In particular, there are now various ways of creating virus particles that are not infectious or virions that can infect a cell and go through one intracellular life cycle yet produce no infectious progeny (Chroboczek, Szurgot, and Szolajska 2014; Yamanaka, Suzuki, and Konishi 2014; Petro et al. 2015) . DNA vaccines can express subsets of the viral proteome without risk of producing infectious particles (Liu 2011) . These and other 'dead-end' vaccines provide novel ways of exposing the patient to large repertoires of viral proteins in relevant tissues with zero risk of creating a replicating, sustained viral population in the patient.

By establishing a self-replicating infection, the vaccine inoculum can be much lower than with the dead-end approaches. The resulting immunity may be greater. Also, if the vaccine strain is transmitted to secondary contacts without reverting to higher virulence, herd immunity will increase passively (Hanley 2011) , reducing the public health effort needed to achieve the same level of coverage with dead-end vaccines. Transmissible vaccines even have the potential to reach populations that other approaches cannot, such as wildlife and inaccessible humans. Attenuated viruses might also be used in the production of killed-virus vaccines, as the killing is not invariably complete, and the attenuation would help prevent disease (as suggested by a reviewer).",

For these new approaches to be justified against the non-replicating alternatives, two problems must be solved. First, the level attenuation should be tunable, so that the virus is neither virulent nor so incapacitated that it fails to generate a sufficient immune response. Second, reversion to virulence must be so slow that the descendants of the vaccine disappear before evolution enables it to initiate an epidemic. Both of these objectives will be greatly facilitated by attenuation methods that lend themselves to predictability. Such is the focus here.",

Attenuated strains are designed either to be confined to the vaccinated individual, thus failing to transmit entirely (R 0 \u00bc 0), or to transmit so poorly that each vaccinated host establishes fewer than one new infection on average (0 < R 0 < 1). However, the growth of attenuated viral populations within patients and among patients allows the ascent of mutations that increase R 0 , and if R 0 evolves to exceed 1, the vaccine strain can potentially create an epidemic. Killed virus, designs that create empty, virus-like particles, and dead-end viruses that infect a cell but produce non-infectious progeny necessarily have R 0 \u00bc 0, but even live vaccines that produce infectious progeny may also fail to transmit to new patients because they do not establish a high enough titer.",

As with any adaptive evolutionary process, the magnitude of evolution is expected to increase with population size and with increasing time to extinction. Vaccines whose intrinsic R 0 (before evolution) are 0.4 or less are expected to die out quickly (they have a very low probability of transmission chains of 4 or more from a single infected individual), whereas those of R 0 > 0:6 have a much higher probability of long chains (Farrington and Grant 1999) . Viruses with an R 0 near 1 are especially prone to evolve above the epidemic threshold both because they are likely to experience long transmission chains and because they need little increase in R 0 to exceed the threshold (Antia et al. 2003) . Based on population size considerations, it might also seem that adaptive vaccine evolution increases directly with the number of individuals vaccinated, but herd immunity generated by mass vaccination will reduce opportunities for transmission and thus restrict evolution.",

These individuals may transmit the virus to far more secondary contacts that does the average vaccinated person, and they may even be incubators for extensive, long-term vaccine evolution within the host (Baric et al. 1999; DeVries et al. 2011) . If these hosts are uncommon, their presence will have almost no impact on standard R 0 calculations, yet they alone could be the basis of vaccine evolution to R 0 > 1. Nonetheless, it would be useful to know the R 0 of live, attenuated viruses. Such studies may require new estimation approaches, because mass vaccinations exhibit different dynamics than do natural outbreaks.

(B and C) For the viruses that have attained a particular chain length, there will have been some evolution occurring during that chain, resulting in a distribution of R 0 values increasing with chain length. If the chain is long enough, there may have been enough evolution that some viruses now have R0 > 1, and if they get into the next patient, an outbreak may occur (depending on other factors). The net probability of evolving a virus that exceeds the epidemic threshold combines the probability of each chain length with the probability that viruses in that patient have R0 > 1 and escape to the next patient.

The old method uses viral growth to evolve a virus that is genetically 'repressed' from its wild counterpart. Toward this end, the virulent, wild-type virus is propagated under unnatural conditions such that it has an opportunity to adapt to the new environment. The new environment may be a tissue culture with a sub-optimal temperature or cells of an unnatural host, or the new environment may be the unnatural host itself. Any adaptation to the new conditions may render it less able to grow well in the original hostan example of what is commonly referred to as an evolutionary trade-off or a negative genetic correlation. This method is haphazard because every set of growth conditions is potentially different, and even different attenuations of the same virus using the same protocol may follow different trajectories. The resulting strain may be a mix of genetic variants (Badgett et al. 2002; Depledge et al. 2014) ; plaque purification may resolve it to a single genotype, but not all viruses can be grown as plaques. Prior to testing, there is no basis for knowing whether adaptation to the new environment affects viral ability to grow in the original host-predicting the level of attenuation is impossible. Thus, any candidate vaccine must be tested by standard trial and error with a susceptible host. In the case of poliovirus, that host was the chimpanzee: a vaccine candidate was injected into its cerebral spinal fluid and the chimp monitored for disease. Although chimps were not natural hosts for poliovirus, wild-type virus delivered in this fashion could make them sick. For many other cases, the virus must be tested in humans before attenuation is known.",

Methods of genetic engineering would allow us to synthesize genomes with random mutations more expeditiously than by sequential bottlenecks, enabling us to create and test hundreds of mutant genomes for any virus. As an attenuation method, however, the fixation of random mutations poses problems. First, the fitness effects of random mutations vary greatly, so the fitness decline from, say, 10 random mutations might be due primarily to just one or two of those mutations, potentially allowing for easy recovery (Sanjuan, Moya, and Elena 2004; Domingo-Calap, Cuevas, and Sanjuan 2009 ). Second, mutations that alter amino acid sequences may change the antigenicity of the vaccine, so that immunity is no longer targeted directly at virulent forms of the virus.",

The suggestion was to create a viral genome with altered codon sequences but which encodes protein sequences identical to the wild type. To a first approximation, a silent codon substitution makes little difference. The protein is the same (hence the codon changes are 'silent'). But some exchanges do make small fitness differences, so they are not strictly fitness neutral. If many exchanges are made in a viral genome and the exchanges are of the right type, viral reproduction can be slowed down to arbitrary levels yet the virus encodes the same proteins as the wild type and is antigenically the same as wild type. Advantages of this method are that it can potentially be used with any virus, even those with small genomes (Tulloch et al. 2014) , and no detailed knowledge of viral biochemistry is required. Other methods discussed below are not as obviously feasible with small genomes.",

By choosing rare codons, protein translation may be slowed (slowing viral progeny production) and translational error rates may be increased (leading to misfolded proteins). RNA secondary structure may be altered by silent codon changes, and regulatory signals may be created or destroyed. Also, dinucleotide frequencies will often be altered. Three rules for making the 'right type' of silent codon exchanges have been proposed, all implemented in experimental poliovirus studies. One method substitutes rare codons for common ones (Burns et al. 2006; Mueller et al. 2006) . Another merely shuffles the synonymous codons used by the gene (Coleman et al. 2008) . A third specifically introduces CpG and UpA dinucleotides (Burns et al. 2009 ). There are varying degrees of overlap in the different methods (e.g., codon shuffling does not introduce rare codons but it does affect CpG and UpA dinucleotides), but the bulk of evidence seems to support a mechanism of attenuation by introducing CpG and UpA dinucleotides (Atkinson et al. 2014; Tulloch et al. 2014 , see below).",

In theory, if hundreds of codon changes individually contribute small effects to reduced viral growth, the pathway to viral recovery must reverse most of those changes. Any single reversion mutation should ascend slowly because of its small fitness benefit.

Second, the argument of slow fitness recovery assumes that evolution must reverse each of the attenuating mutations to reverse the attenuating fitness effect. This assumption is more suspect.

All three protocols proposed for poliovirus achieved attenuation in a satisfying, quantitative fashion (Burns et al. 2006 (Burns et al. , 2009 Mueller et al. 2006; Coleman et al. 2008) . In a couple other systems as well, silent codon replacements have revealed highly regular, quantitative attenuation in proportion to the number of codon changes (Fig. 3, A recent proposal, extending the suggestion of Burns et al. (2009) , based on a reanalysis of other studies and also on new data is that the level of attenuation for eukaryotic viruses depends chiefly on the number of CpG and UpA dinucleotides created by the codon changes. Rather than impairing translation, the attenuating effect is due to the innate immune response to the nucleic acid itself (Atkinson et al. 2014; Tulloch et al. 2014 ). If the dependence of attenuation on those two dinucleotides holds broadly, it will enable greater predictability in attenuation. This model cannot explain attenuation with bacterial viruses, of course. Given the many processes that could be affected by silent codon differences (protein synthesis, RNA folding, or translational errors), it is possible that, across all viruses, there are multiple mechanisms contributing to attenuation by silent codon replacement.",

In some short-term adaptations, there has been no obvious evolutionary fitness reversion (Coleman et al. 2008; Meng et al. 2014 ). In cases of longer term evolution, fitness reversion is slow or substantial-not consistent across viruses. Part of the difficulty in comparing results across studies is that some studies codon-modify viral genomes that have not been pre-adapted to the growth conditions used in the adaptations. Thus, both the codon-modified virus and the unmodified virus show considerable fitness gains during the adaptations, so it is difficult to know how much of the fitness improvement in the codon-modified virus is in response to the attenuation rather than the culture conditions. When fitness increase can be attributed to attenuation reversal, however, the nucleotide changes commonly do not reverse the attenuating mutations and may even fall outside the codonmodified segments (Bull, Molineux, and Wilke 2012; Martrus et al. 2013; Nougairede et al. 2013 ). Poliovirus reversions did show an elevated rate of CpG reversals (which led to the proposal of their importance in attenuation, Burns et al. 2009 ). Thus, molecular reversal of attenuation is not one to one with the engineered changes, and the fitness effects of reversing mutations are not as small as predicted. Some of the more rapid reversions were in HIV-1, with complete recovery of fitness in 15 passages (10-fold dilutions each, Martrus et al. 2013) . Moderate fitness increases occurred in deoptimized Chikungunya virus over 300 generations, but inference from analysis of mutations was that most of the fitness gain was from adaptation to culture conditions, hence slow reversion of the engineered fitness drop (Nougairede et al. 2013) . No detectable fitness increase was observed after 100 generations in phage T7, but nearly half of lost fitness was recovered after 1,000 generations (Bull, Molineux, and Wilke 2012) .",

At present, experimental work is needed to determine the pace of recovery for each individual implementation.

The most advanced understanding of this sort is for the bacteriophage T7: a virtual model of the viral life cycle has been developed, and this model was used to predict the fitness effect of translocations of the phage RNA polymerase (RNAP) gene (Endy et al. 2000) . T7 is unusual among DNA phages in that it encodes its own RNAP, which in turn drives expression of most of its genome. The linear entry of the T7 genome into its host requires expression of the RNAP; a 'downstream' shift in the location of the RNAP gene causes well-understood delays in the life cycle, giving rise to robust predictions of fitness drops. For most viruses, however, the fitness effect of a translocated element is not obviously as predictable nor prone to incremental modification as with silent codon changes. Predicting the evolutionary stability of a rearranged genome is also problematic in all systems. The impact of rearrangements on viral growth rate is subject to change through mutations affecting gene expression, so it is feasible that some recovery mutations will have large effects and lead to rapid fitness gains despite an initially strong attenuating rearrangement that itself is irreversible.",

Different rearrangements showed different patterns of early fitness recovery, some substantial, but all maintained a significant level of fitness depression on longterm adaptation (Fig. 4, even out to 2,000 generations) .

Yet even with small genomes, nonessential portions of the genome can be identified, perhaps within genes. With several possible targets for deletion in a single genome, the combinatorial possibilities for attenuated genomes may be large, and many of those combinations may need to be tested empirically to find acceptable reductions in fitness.

One is simply to reduce the growth rate of the virus, attenuating by reducing viral titer in the same way that the codon-deoptimization methods work (Whatmore et al. 1995; Berkhout et al. 1999; Licis, Balklava, and Van Duin 2000; Rokyta et al. 2002; Springman et al. 2005; Licis and van Duin 2006; Harcombe, Springman, and Bull 2009; Mazel-Sanchez and Elliott 2012) ; any non-essential gene or gene segment will potentially work. For example, the codon-deoptimized influenza virus of Nogales et al. (2014) targeted the NS1 gene, whose role is to defend against the host interferon response; it might be guessed that a deletion or partial deletion of NS1 would have a similar effect (as pointed out by a reviewer). A second is to selectively remove genes that are essential for virulence but not essential for viral growth (Enjuanes et al. 2008; Lamirande et al. 2008 ). The absence of such genes may of course impair viral growth, but the effect on virulence is for reasons other than growth rate. A well-known example from outside viruses comes from pathogenicity islands in bacteria, responsible for specific disease symptoms yet not necessary for bacterial growth (Groisman and Ochman 1996) . (In a third approach, a virus may be deleted of a gene essential for growth or transmission and the vaccine be prepared with a complementing gene so that the vaccine infects and possibly replicates but is unable to produce infective progeny. This latter design ensures R 0 \u00bc 0, but as those viruses are dead ends, they are considered no further.)",

However, regardless of the fitness effect of a deletion, different deletions together should often lead to greater fitness reduction than do the individual deletions, enabling a coarseor moderate-scale tuning of fitness reduction.

Phage DNA ligase is 'essential' when the virus is grown on a host whose DNA ligase is also defective, but sustained adaptation led to massive fitness increases in both viruses and to approximately the same final fitness. In T7, the observed compensatory mutations were primarily in DNA metabolism genes, whereas in T3, the compensatory changes were both in DNA metabolism and in genes unrelated to DNA metabolism. The fact that a reduction in genome replication (by disruption of DNA metabolism) creates an imbalance in the different processes of viral assembly allows most any gene to interact with, and thus compensate for, the absence of ligase.",

Offsetting this concern is the fact that some recoveries were slow, at least initially, though some were not. Thus, deletion-based vaccines that are intrinsically capable of extensive recoveries might die out before they evolve the ability to persist. Furthermore, recoveries that leave the deletion intact are typically only partial, a point that led Berkhout et al. (1999) to propose a stepwise method of attenuation. Viruses engineered with deletions would be evolved for recovery, then engineered to carry other deletions, followed by a second recovery. replicates of a genome with an RNAP gene displaced approximately half the genome length. In the replicate that evolved the higher fitness, an early rearrangement returned the RNAP gene to its wild-type location but displaced other genes. Subsequent evolution was gradual and may have reached an asymptote. (Right) The RNAP gene was displaced about 15% of the genome length, so the initial fitness was higher than in the left graph. However, no apparent fitness improvement occurred during adaptation. Both panels are from Cecchini et al. (2013) , the left amended with data from Springman et al. (2005) .

Several approaches made feasible by technology have been tested enough, if only in culture, to get a sense of the repeatability and hence the predictability of the process. The emphasis here is on approaches that are potentially general to many viruses and have also been implemented at least experimentally. Designs specific to one virus are sometimes used and may work well, so they may warrant consideration on a case-by-case basis.",

Predictability should improve as more is understood about how codon changes attenuate; the recent proposal that attenuation is due to CpG and UpA dinucleotides may lead to a profound improvement in prediction. In contrast, attenuation by genome rearrangement or deletion poses a much greater challenge to prediction, and difficulties were experienced in a system considered highly amenable to prediction.",

            "text": "Once experience has been obtained with a particular vaccine and it has proven robust against evolutionary reversion, it may be possible to use that stable genome for vaccines against other serotypes, by replacing key antigens. This approach has been implemented in the Flu Mist influenza vaccine (Flu Mist fact sheet, 2015, at http://www.medimmune.com/docs/ default-source/default-document-library/product-and-patientinformation-for-flumist-quadrivalent.pdf?sfvrsn\u00bc0). The approach avoids the need to attenuate each serotype, but it does require a priori knowledge of antigens driving the immune response. Kenney et al. (2011) offered an interesting evaluation of alternative methods. They engineered three different designs in the same virus and then evaluated attenuation and reversion in side-by-side comparisons during serial transfers in mice. The three designs consisted of the traditional attenuation method (adaptation to novel conditions), a rationally engineered strain with a nonsynonymous point mutation in an envelope gene and a deletion, and a chimera between virulent virus and an avirulent relative. After 10 mouse-mouse transfers (by intracerebral injection), the chimeric virus exhibited the greatest stability of attenuation. This experimental, comparative approach has obvious advantages in discovering suitable designs and even helps avoid experimenter bias in becoming vested in a single approach. Of course, other studies and combinations of studies have compared different attenuation designs of the same virus but not so explicitly and directly as did Kenney et al. (2011) . Viral chimeras-recombinants incorporating genes from close or distant relatives-are widely used in research and offer several different possibilities for attenuation. The challenges of many chimeric vaccine approaches parallel those experienced by the methods discussed above so will not be discussed here. However, one chimeric technology is specific to chimeras and offers a unique possibility: changing viral receptors (Reimann et al. 2004; Michelfelder and Trepel 2009; Parrish 2010; Mourez et al. 2011) . In extreme cases, altering the receptors can completely change the tissue tropism of a virus. In essence, use of a new receptor may endow the virus with a new niche. Depending on the dynamics of viral growth in the host, on the spectrum of mutations to other receptors, and on tradeoffs in alternative receptor use, a virus with altered tropism could be stably transmitted indefinitely under its new tropism. If this altered tropism is attenuating and also effects an appropriate immune response, a virus with a new and stable tropism may be permanently attenuated. This is an exciting area for original research, both theoretical (Kelly et al. 2003) and experimental.",

Recombination between an attenuated strain and the wild type may be inconsequential because it does no worse than reconstituting the wild type, which is already present in any host harboring the recombination. The problem gets messier when multiple wild-type strains are present and/or multiple strains are attenuated, because it now may be possible for a recombinant to acquire different properties than any of the parent strains and thus to have even higher fitness than circulating wild types. Of course, recombination among wild-type strains is not accelerated by the introduction of vaccine strains, but recombination among different vaccine strains or between vaccine and wild-type strains may be greatly increased in the high viral loads introduced by vaccination. The evolution of a high-fitness vaccine-recombinant strain has in fact been reported in a poultry virus, and the recombinant virus even appears to have higher fitness than the previous wild-type virus (Lee et al. 2012 (Lee et al. , 2015 . When recombination poses a possible threat of this type, the vaccine design may be chosen to restrict opportunities for recombination or to restrict opportunities for the types of recombination that will be most pernicious. For example, silent codon modification may reduce sequence similarity so that recombination becomes improbable in certain segments. Attenuating deletions may also limit opportunities for creating viral recombinants whose fitness is higher than wild type.",
