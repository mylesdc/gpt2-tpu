Prior work has demonstrated that a visual scoring system applied to chest radiographs (CXR) is associated with adverse outcomes in ICU patients with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). We hypothesized that a simple, semi-quantitative CXR score would be associated with clinical outcomes for the general ICU population, regardless of underlying diagnosis. Methods: All individuals enrolled in the Registry of Critical Illness at Brigham and Women's Hospital between June 2008 and August 2018 who had a CXR within 24 h of admission were included. Each patient's CXR was assigned an opacification score of 0-4 in each of four quadrants with the total score being the sum of all four quadrants. Multivariable negative binomial, logistic, and Cox regression, adjusted for age, sex, race, immunosuppression, a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, a history of congestive heart failure, and APACHE II scores, were used to assess the total score's association with ICU length of stay (LOS), duration of mechanical ventilation, inhospital mortality, 60-day mortality, and overall mortality, respectively.",

Higher CXR scores were associated with increased mortality; for every one-point increase in score, in-hospital mortality increased 10% (OR 1.10, CI 1.05-1.16, p < 0.001) and 60-day mortality increased by 12% (OR 1.12, CI 1.07-1.17, p < 0.001). CXR scores were also independently associated with both ICU length of stay (rate ratio 1.06, CI 1.04-1.07, p < 0.001) and duration of mechanical ventilation (rate ratio 1.05, CI 1.02-1.07, p < 0.001). Conclusions: Higher values on a simple visual score of a patient's CXR on admission to the medical ICU are associated with increased in-hospital mortality, 60-day mortality, overall mortality, length of ICU stay, and duration of mechanical ventilation.",

To calculate a score for each radiograph, the patient's first portable CXR upon acceptance to the ICU was divided into four quadrants; two in each of the right and left lungs. The upper and lower quadrants for each lung were determined by the level of the carina. Each quadrant was assigned a score from 0 to 4 with 0 = normal, 1 = hazy opacification of less than half the quadrant, 2 = dense opacification of less than half the quadrant, 3 = hazy opacification of more than half the quadrant, and 4 = dense opacification of more than half the quadrant. Opacification was considered dense if the rib margins were obscured by the infiltrate. The total score, ranging from 0 to 16, was the sum of the four quadrants (Fig. 2 ). If the subject initially presented to another facility and the only image available for the first 24 h was obtained there, then the image from the facility of presentation was used (n = 6). No radiographs were excluded for positioning or exposure reasons.",

Compared to the time and volume of data required to calculate an APACHE or SOFA Fig. 3 Receiver operating curves (ROC) for univariable and bivariable predictors of in-hospital mortality.

In our study, given the stepwise increase in odds of death by quartile, it is possible that with a larger sample size this threshold effect would be eliminated. Notably, the location of the potential threshold differed between the two studies; with ours suggesting an inflection after quartile one and theirs at the median [12] .. This likely reflects the differences in the scoring systems as well as in the populations to which they were applied. The prior study was limited to ARDS patients enrolled in the Fluid and Catheter Treatment Trial, a randomized, controlled trial that excluded patients with comorbid conditions limiting lifeexpectancy, which significantly reduced heterogeneity [24] . That we were unable to replicate their findings specifically in the subgroup with ARDS is likely due to our limited sample size of this subgroup.",

Elevated IL-18 levels have been demonstrated in patients with sepsis and ARDS compared to ICU controls [14, 25, 26] . Similarly, damage associated molecular patterns, such as mtDNA and nucDNA have been associated with mortality in critically ill patients [27, 28] . While the strength of the correlation between biomarkers and the CXR score is moderate, this is likely because the correlation between biomarkers and critical illness itself has been variable [29] . Further, because our cohort was comprised predominately of sepsis, we chose biomarkers studied in septic critical illness; however, the correlation for a given biomarker is likely to be limited given the heterogeneity of diagnoses admitted to the ICU. Our study also has several limitations. For example, subgroups in our cohort were not large enough to explore the relationship between the variety of admission diagnoses and mortality with granularity. Our non-ARDS subgroup was comprised predominately of septic patients and thus likely underrepresents diagnoses such as cardiogenic shock or COPD exacerbation, which may limit generalizability. Additionally, the population in our study is derived from a single, tertiary care institution with a high proportion of immunosuppressed patients. While immunosuppression was controlled for in the regression models, our survival outcomes may not be typical of a community ICU setting. Indeed, our median CXR score was comparable to, and our 60-day mortality was higher than, that of a prior study composed entirely of ARDS patients. It will be important to validate our findings in other general ICU populations that include a range of illness severity and comorbid conditions.",
