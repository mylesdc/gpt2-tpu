The proteasome is essential for poxvirus replication, making the viral components interacting with the ubiquitin-proteasome system attractive antiviral targets. We show that proteasome inhibition impairs CPXV replication by prevention of uncoating, suggesting that uncoating is mediated by proteasomal degradation of viral core proteins. Although Orthopoxvirus particles contain considerable amounts of ubiquitin, distinct modification sites are largely unknown. Therefore, for the first time, we analyzed globally ubiquitination sites in CPXV mature virion proteins using LC-MS/MS. Identification of 137 conserved sites in 54 viral proteins among five CPXV strains revealed extensive ubiquitination of structural core proteins. Moreover, since virions contained primarily K48-linked polyubiquitin, we hypothesized that core proteins are modified accordingly. However, quantitative analysis of ubiquitinated CPXV proteins early in infection showed no proteasomal degradation of core proteins. Instead, our data indicate that the recently suggested proteasomal regulation of the uncoating factor E5 is a prerequisite for uncoating. Expanding our understanding of poxvirus uncoating and elucidating a multitude of novel ubiquitination sites in poxvirus proteins, the present study verifies the major biological significance of ubiquitin in poxvirus infection.",

As a member of the Poxviridae family the genus Orthopoxvirus (OPV) comprises complex enveloped DNA viruses, including the smallpox-causing Variola virus (VARV), Vaccinia virus (VACV), which was used for smallpox eradication 7 , and several animal-borne viruses with zoonotic potential like Cowpox virus (CPXV) 8-10 . Having caused the death of hundreds of millions of people, VARV is the most prominent member of OPV. Although VARV has been eradicated in 1979, it is still a global health threat because of its possible release in the context of a bioterrorist attack and the emergence of VARV-like viruses from circulating OPV by natural evolution 11 . CPXV are well suited to fill the niche that was created by VARV eradication, since it has the largest OPV genome including homologous open reading frames of all VARV genes. Currently, the number of zoonotic infections in Europe caused by CPXV is increasing, illustrating the need for a comprehensive understanding of the virus biology, especially the interaction with the host cell 12,13 .",

Treatment of CPXV-infected cells with proteasome inhibitors prevents late protein expression and reduces viral titers 3 but it remains unknown to what extent results generated with VACV apply to CPXV. Hence, we aimed to characterize the role of ubiquitin and the UPS in CPXV infection in a more comprehensive way. We initially verified the inhibition of proteasome activity by MG-132 and Bortezomib in HeLa cells and excluded cytotoxic effects. Subsequently, we showed that proteasome inhibition impairs CPXV replication by prevention of viral core degradation, resulting in early but not in late viral protein expression. Therefore, we hypothesized that proteasomal degradation of K48-linked polyubiquitinated core proteins is the mechanism underlying CPXV uncoating, as previously suggested for VACV 4 . Since this hypothesis has not been verified yet, we aimed to prove it by conducting the first global LC-MS/MS-based ubiquitinome analysis of OPV IMV proteins. Using purified CPXV IMV particles, we identified 137 conserved ubiquitination sites in 54 viral proteins among five CPXV strains. As hypothesized, CPXV major core proteins were extensively ubiquitinated. But surprisingly, we were unable to detect their proteasome-dependent degradation upon infection. Instead, 54 other viral proteins were degraded in a proteasome-dependent manner early in infection, including all proteins associated with the formation of viral pre-replication sites 23 . Most notably, we detected the proteasomal degradation of the uncoating factor E5 (VACV D5), which is likely a prerequisite for OPV genome uncoating 23 .",

For this purpose, different concentrations of MG-132 and Bortezomib were analyzed for their inhibition of the chymotryptic-like proteasome activity in HeLa cells. Both compounds inhibit primarily the chymotrypsin-like site of the 26 S proteasome but may also act on the caspaselike site in a concentration-dependent manner 24 . A complete inhibition of proteasome activity was only observed using 10 \u00b5M MG-132 and 1 \u00b5M Bortezomib, which represented the highest inhibitor concentrations tested (Fig. 1a) . These concentrations have already been applied in previous studies, though proteasome inhibition has not been shown 2,3 . Analysis of the ATP amount revealed about 80% cell viability of inhibitor-treated cells after 24 h of treatment (Fig. 1b) .

Using a confocal microscopy-based core stabilization assay, Satheshkumar and colleagues still observed 40-45% of uncoated cores in cells treated with MG-132. Although they additionally observed a more than 2-fold increase in intact virus cores in the presence of MG-132, they concluded that the inability of uncoating is not sufficient to account for the complete replication inhibition of VACV observed in proteasome-inhibited cells 2 . However, virus attachment to cells at 4 \u00b0C for 1 h without the presence of MG-132 prior to 37 \u00b0C incubation in the presence of proteasome inhibitor, as done by Satheshkumar and colleagues 2 , may result in uncoating even before complete proteasome inhibition is achieved. This may explain the observed 40-45% of uncoated cores in the presence of MG-132 2 . We still observed residual proteasome activity after 1 h of MG-132 treatment (data not shown) verifying this assumption and hence we pretreated cells for electron microscopy with proteasome inhibitor prior to infection. Confirming that proteasome inhibition prevents CPXV core degradation, we aimed to identify ubiquitination sites in structural core proteins, which are a prerequisite for their proteasome-dependent degradation. Therefore, we conducted the first global LC-MS/ MS-based ubiquitinome analysis of virion proteins.",

Although K48-linked polyubiquitin was identified in VACV core fractions using immunoblotting 4 , no information is available about distinct ubiquitinated proteins in the core fraction that would prove the hypothesis of ubiquitinated structural core proteins. This encouraged us to analyze the mature virion ubiquitinome of five CPXV strains to elucidate the conserved CPXV ubiquitinome. Besides the cell culture-adapted CPXV strain Brighton Red (BR) representing the best-characterized CPXV strain, we analyzed four CPXV strains that were isolated between 2007 and 2009 in the German Consultant Laboratory for Poxviruses at the Robert Koch Institute, Germany. All of these four strains led to documented zoonotic infections. If the hypothesis of ubiquitinated core proteins is true, ubiquitination sites in corresponding proteins should be identifiable. Therefore, we purified CPXV mature virions by density gradient ultracentrifugation, lysed the purified particles and digested the proteins with trypsin. Ubiquitinated lysine residues resulted in diGly(K) remnants at peptides, which were subsequently enriched via immunoaffinity purification and analyzed by LC-MS/MS.",

This supports the hypothesis of K48-linked polyubiquitinated core proteins. It should be noted that peptide area quantification of ubiquitin linkages relies on the comparison of non-identical peptides and hence represents only a rough approximation. Moreover, from our results, it is not possibly to determine the precise ubiquitination linkage of distinct virion proteins. However, in agreement with our results, Mercer and colleagues identified K48-linked polyubiquitin in VACV virion core fractions by Western blotting but, in contrast to our results, they were not able to detect K63-linked polyubiquitin chains 4 . This might be attributed to the lesser abundance of K63 linkages which may not be detectable using Western blot but it may also represent a biological difference between VACV and CPXV. It should be noted further that fractionation of purified IMV particles in core and membrane fraction by incubation with detergent and reduction agents 4, 20, 30 as performed by Mercer and colleagues 4 may result in incomplete separation since LBs may be still associated. Pederson and colleagues compared proteins of cores prepared with NP-40/DTT to those isolated from infected cells treated with actinomycin D which inhibits uncoating. Only the NP40/DTT-treated cores were positive for the LB protein F17, which indicates incomplete LB removal by NP40/DTT treatment 25 .

Another eleven viral proteins contained ubiquitination sites in all five CPXV strains but no conserved lysine residues were identified (Supplementary Table S6 ). More than half of the 54 viral proteins with conserved ubiquitination sites contained one or two diGly(K) sites, while other proteins showed up to ten sites (Fig. 4b) . As expected, proteins with conserved diGly(K) sites tended to be essential for virus replication (59.5%) and conserved in OPV (70.4%). In addition, most viral proteins with conserved ubiquitination sites belonged to the functional term host-virus interaction and transcription but also proteins belonging to the core were identified (Fig. 4c) . The identification of ubiquitination sites in CPXV proteins of diverse functions indicated an underestimated regulatory function of ubiquitin during OPV infection. Because the elucidation of ubiquitination sites in CPXV core proteins was a major objective of the present study, it is discussed in the following. Nevertheless, remarkable results were obtained for viral proteins of other functional classes. Our data, for example, indicates a ubiquitin-dependent transcriptional regulation of CPXV. Therefore, viral proteins with conserved ubiquitination sites that belong to functional classes other than the core are depicted in the Supplementary Discussion. Ubiquitination of CPXV core proteins. Although proteins of the core are not defined in detail, they are known to include the viral proteins A11 (p4a), A4 (p4b), A5 (p39), N4 (p25) and A7 transferred by homology from VACV 25, 34, 35 . These proteins, except for A7, are also found in high copy numbers comparable to those of membrane proteins in CPXV mature virions, suggesting a structural role 17 . The function of A7 has not been elucidated yet. A7 and N4 are known to locate inside the core, while A11, A4 and A5 are part of the outer core structure, making them likely targets for ubiquitination 25, 35 . The major core protein A11 contained the greatest number of ubiquitination sites among all proteins identified. A11 contained ten conserved diGly(K) sites and a mean of 20 diGly(K) sites, considering also non-conserved sites. Additionally, the major core protein A4 contained six conserved diGly(K) sites, ranking third-highest in the number of conserved ubiquitination sites. The A5 protein was not grouped to the proteins with conserved ubiquitin positions because no site was detected in the CPXV BR strain; all other CPXV strains showed at least one ubiquitination site in the A5 protein. Although N4 and A7 are not part of the outer core structure, they were identified to possess six and seven conserved ubiquitination sites, respectively, demonstrating that ubiquitination of core proteins is not restricted to the outer part of the core. This data clearly confirmed the massive ubiquitination of CPXV major core proteins, supporting the hypothesis of their proteasomal degradation upon infection.",

For example, it has been reported that VACV C6 (CPXV C14) and B14 (CPXV B12) are not covalently ubiquitinated 39 . Indeed, for the CPXV BR strain we were unable to identify any ubiquitination site in C14 or B12, but all other analyzed CPXV strains contained ubiquitination sites on one or both proteins.

We compared the amino acid sequence around ubiquitinated lysine residues (+/\u2212 eight amino acids) to the non-ubiquitinated lysine background using motif-x 40 . However, this did not lead to any results. Also, the sequence logo analysis implemented in Perseus revealed no primary amino acid motif for ubiquitination. Therefore, it may be concluded that ubiquitination site specificity of CPXV mature virion proteins is independent of a distinct amino acid motif near target lysine residues. It is not completely understood what determines ubiquitination site specificity but recently it was suggested that proteins destined for the proteasome contain three factors which are referred to as tripartite degron architecture 41 . These consist of a primary peptide motif recognized by an E3-ubiquitin ligase (degron), target lysine site(s) for ubiquitination and a disordered degradation initiation site. The degron can be distant from the target ubiquitination site, which could explain why no ubiquitination motif was identified near the lysine residue. Besides ubiquitination, phosphorylation of VACV mature virion proteins has been globally analyzed with LC-MS/MS 42, 43 . Recently, 396 unique phosphorylation sites among 83 VACV proteins have been identified 43 . Strikingly, about 70% of CPXV proteins with conserved ubiquitination sites were identified to contain phosphorylation sites in homologous VACV proteins. This correlation may be important since cross-talk between phosphorylation and ubiquitination has been described, e.g. the regulation of proteasomal degradation by phosphorylation 44 . Interestingly, the data from Ngo and colleagues 43 revealed the greatest number of phosphorylation sites in VACV core proteins p4A and p4B with 17 and 34 unique phosphorylation sites, respectively, indicating that core proteins are packaged in a phosphorylated state in mature virions. Since it is known that phosphorylation motifs, so-called phosphodegrons, can serve as recognition signals for E3 ligases 44 , it can be hypothesized that OPV proteins may contain phosphorylation motifs representing binding signals for ubiquitin ligases. Although Ngo and colleagues 43 did not detect a phosphorylation motif in VACV proteins, they observed protein areas with frequent phosphorylation identifications, so-called phosphorylation clusters, which were also found in major core proteins p4A and p4B.",

            "text": "CPXV core proteins were elucidated, we next aimed to show their proteasome-dependent degradation in HeLa cells. For this purpose, we performed an LC-MS/MS-based quantitative analysis of ubiquitinated peptides in CPXV-infected HeLa cells in the presence or absence of MG-132 early in infection (2 h post infection). Control and inhibitor-treated samples were prepared in triplicate each, which show clear separation in hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis (Fig. 5a,b) . Statistical analysis revealed significant abundance differences of ubiquitinated peptides in cells with non-inhibited versus inhibited proteasome, with most viral peptides being stabilized in the presence of proteasome inhibitor ( Fig. 5c and Supplementary Table S7 ). Stabilization of proteins as a result of proteasome inhibition implies that these proteins are degraded by an active proteasome. Controversially, one peptide of the viral RhoA-signaling inhibitor G11 protein was identified to be degraded by the proteasome, while two peptides of G11 were identified as not being degraded. Since it cannot be inferred from the present data which ubiquitination linkage is present at the respective lysine linkage, the ubiquitin linkages in G11 may be not linked by K48 and, hence, may be not associated with proteasomal degradation. However, peptides of all other viral proteins showed clear tendencies for either degradation or not. Functional categorization of CPXV proteins degraded by the proteasome revealed mostly proteins of unknown function, followed by proteins belonging to host-virus interaction, transcription and DNA replication. Although proteins associated with hostvirus interaction and transcription were also abundant among CPXV proteins with conserved ubiquitination sites, only few correlations between viral proteins degraded by the proteasome and conserved ubiquitination sites were observed (Supplementary Table S7 ). Out of 54 viral proteins degraded by the proteasome, 45 are part of the CPXV mature virion proteome 17 but only 11 were identified with conserved ubiquitination site.",

Surprisingly, we observed the opposite. Major core proteins A11 and A4 were unchanged or even less ubiquitinated when the proteasome was inhibited, disproving their direct proteasomal degradation. The outer core protein A5 was not identified in this experiment, which is consistent with the fact that no ubiquitination sites in A5 were identified in the ubiquitinome analysis in the CPXV BR strain used in this experiment. Besides structural core proteins, proteins that showed a downregulation upon MG-132 addition were primarily host proteins. Generally, the downregulation of ubiquitination upon proteasome inhibition may be catalyzed by deubiquitinating enzymes. It is not known how ubiquitination of proteins is altered during CPXV infection. However, since no deubiquitinating enzyme in CPXV has been described, host deubiquitinating enzymes may be involved.",

            "text": "Subsequently, we focused on the identification of CPXV proteins other than core proteins that could explain the inhibition of viral replication as a result of proteasome inhibition, and another class of viral proteins attracted our attention. Using siRNA screening, Kilcher and colleagues identified 15 viral candidate genes that impaired intermediate but not early VACV gene expression 23 . Out of these 15 candidate genes, four reduced the number of pre-replication sites, meaning precursor sites of viral DNA replication, by more than 40%. Strikingly, all of these four proteins were found to be stabilized by proteasome inhibition in our study. These proteins include the serine/threonine-protein kinase B1 (CPXV B1), the putative nuclease G5 (CPXV H5), the ssDNA-binding phosphoprotein I3 (CPXV L3) as well as the primase D5 (CPXV E5). Kilcher and colleagues identified the VACV D5 protein as the genome uncoating factor the depletion of which leads to accumulation of intact cores in the cytoplasm 23 . D5 has been shown to possess N-terminal primase as well as C-terminal NTPase activity in vitro [45] [46] [47] [48] . While both activities are essential for viral DNA replication, only the latter is essential for uncoating 23 . D5 is expressed early during infection and recruited to VACV cores in cells with inhibited proteasome but not in cells with non-inhibited proteasome, indicating a temporary localization which is reversed by the proteasome 23 . CPXV E5 and VACV D5 share about 98.5% amino acid identity. In this study we provide evidence that the CPXV D5 homologue is ubiquitinated at two conserved lysine residues and degraded by the proteasome early in infection, supporting the hypothesis of a proteasomally regulated D5-core interaction. It has been proposed that D5 may assist uncoating by actively contributing to global core degradation or by acting at defined core channels 23 . Our data do not exclude the proteasome-dependent degradation of CPXV core proteins at a later stage of infection but indicate that the proteasomal degradation of other viral proteins, probably the uncoating factor D5 homologue, is a prerequisite. Other viral proteins that were identified to be proteasomally degraded early in infection are discussed in the supplements.",
