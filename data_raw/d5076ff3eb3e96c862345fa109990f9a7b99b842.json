Development of effective vaccines against TGEV and PEDV is one of important prevention measures. The spike (S) protein is the surface glycoprotein of TGEV and PEDV, which can induce specific neutralization antibodies and is a candidate antigen for vaccination attempts. In this study, the open reading frames of the TGEV S1 protein and in addition of the S or S1 proteins of PEDV were inserted into the eukaryotic expression vector, pIRES, resulting in recombinant plasmids, pIRES-(TGEV-S1-PEDV-S1) and pIRES-(TGEV-S1-PEDV-S). Subsequently, 6-8 weeks old Kunming mice were inoculated with both DNA plasmids. Lymphocyte proliferation assay, virus neutralization assay, IFN-c assay and CTL activity assay were performed. TGEV/PEDV specific antibody responses as well as kinetic changes of T lymphocyte subgroups of the immunized mice were analyzed. The results showed that the recombinant DNA plasmids increased the proliferation of T lymphocytes and the number of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocyte subgroups. In addition, the DNA vaccines induced a high level of IFN-c in the immunized mice. The specific CTL activity in the pIRES-(TGEV-S1-PEDV-S) group became significant at 42 days postimmunization. At 35 days post-immunization, the recombinant DNA plasmids bearing full-length S genes of TGEV and PEDV stimulated higher levels of specific antibodies and neutralizing antibodies in immunized mice.",

            "text": "Transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) and porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) are both severe enteric diseases in newborn piglets which are characterized by extremely high mortality, as well as by devastating economic consequences for swine industry [3, 32, 35] . The etiologic agents responsible for these diseases are coronaviruses, TGEV and PEDV, respectively. TGEV was isolated for the first time in 1946 [8] . Japan and England reported the disease in 1956 and 1957 [12, 31] . The virus replicates in the cytoplasm of mature absorptive epithelial cells present on the tips of the villi in the small intestine. The functions of the coronavirus spike (S) protein are both attachment to the cell surface and fusion of the viral membrane with the cellular membrane [7, 36] . The S protein is the major inducer of TGEV-neutralizing antibodies [11, 15, 19] . Therefore, it is an excellent target protein candidate for vaccine development. The relevant epitopes for neutralization were mapped to the N-terminal domain of S protein, and four antigenic sites (A to D) were identified within the first 543 of the 1447 residues of the S protein [13, 20] . The first 37% of the polypeptide chain of the S protein appear to be more immunogenic than the rest of the sequence. This region would be located in the globular part of the peplomer, which is more exposed than the fibrillar, Cterminal portion of the S protein [13] . Previous reports show that the immunogenicity of the DNA vaccine comprising the main antigenic sites is superior to a vaccine containing the total length S gene [29] .",

The disease is characterized by severe diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration, and death, and has a mortality rate of up to 90% [35] . Since 1978, the disease has frequently broken out in many swine-raising countries and has resulted in severe economic losses in Asia, notably in China, Japan and Korea [6, 14, 18] . In 1996, PED outbreaks have been reported to be responsible for the death of more than 39,000 piglets in Japan [42] . PED caused not only the death of neonatal piglets, but also the weight loss in fattening pigs due to PEDV-induced diarrhea. Therefore, it is important to develop an effective vaccine preventing PEDV infection.",

The S protein is not cleaved into S1 and S2 subunits by furin-like proteases, due to the lack of appropriate cleavage sites. The S1 domain (residues 1-789) and the S2 domain are artificially defined on the S protein (residues 790-1.383) [10, 34] . Previous reports have shown that the main neutralizing epitopes are located on the S1 domain that is thought to form the globular part of S protein [34, 39] . Sun et al. (2007) reported that the epitope region designated S1D (aa 636,789) on the S1 domain of PEDV S protein is highly conserved across PEDV isolates and that this region has the capacity to induce the production of virus neutralization antibodies. Moreover, the immune serum against S1D showed the binding ability to the native S protein of PEDV. The S1D5 (aa 744-759) and S1D6 (aa 756-771) are two linear epitope domains. Furthermore, the SS2 (-748 YSNIGVCK 755-) and SS6 (-764 LQDGQVKI 771-) are two core epitope domains on S1D5 and S1D6, respectively, located on the S protein of PEDV [40] . According to the sequence information for the neutralizing epitope of the transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), the neutralizing epitope domain COE (aa 499-638) that is responsible for inducing virus neutralizing antibodies on the S1 domain of PEDV S protein was identified. It is highly conserved in PEDV strains [17, 41] . A novel antigenic domain -1368GPRLQPY1347-motif has excellent immunogenicity has been identified on the C-terminal portion of the S protein, which elicited a strong antibody response and induced neutralizing antibodies [5] .",

Although, there are many commercial vaccines, the traditional inactivated vaccines have many deficiencies. Therefore, the two diseases are still major problems in the swine industry [3, 16, 27] . The S protein is considered to be a primary target antigen for developing an effective vaccine against coronaviruses. There are no reports comparing the efficiency of S and S1-based vaccines against PEDV; therefore, we evaluated a combined vaccination approach based on the plasmid-driven expression of two proteins, the TGEV S protein and the PEDV S or S1 proteins using a mouse model. This investigation is a first step for development of bivalent vaccines against TGE and PED.",

By contrast, the proliferation levels of lymphocytes from animals immunized with pIRES-(TGEV-S1-PEDV-S) or pIRES-(PEDV-S) were highest at 42 dpi (p,0.01); no significant differences (p.0.05) were observed between the groups of pIRES-(TGEV-S1-PEDV-S) and pIRES-(PEDV-S). The proliferation values upon stimulation by TGEV-S1 protein are shown in Figure 4B . By 28 dpi the proliferation levels of spleen T lymphocytes from animals injected with pIRES-(TGEV-S1-PEDV-S1), pIRES-(TGEV-S1-PEDV-S) or pIRES-(TGEV-S1) were all significantly increased (p,0.01) relative to the PBS or pIRES controls. Furthermore, the values of the pIRES-(TGEV-S1-PEDV-S1) group were somewhat higher than those of the pIRES-(TGEV-S1-PEDV-S) group (p,0.05). By 42 dpi, the changes in the proliferation levels relative to controls remained highly significant (p,0.01) irrespective of the plasmid used for vaccination, pIRES-(TGEV-S1-PEDV-S1) or pIRES-(TGEV-S1-PEDV-S). No significant differences (p.0.05) were observed between the 28 dpi and 42 dpi values. Assays using PBMC to determine the proliferation of peripheral blood lymphocytes upon stimulation by PEDV-S1 protein were performed. At 14 dpi the proliferation of blood lymphocytes from mice immunized with pIRES-(TGEV-S1-PEDV-S1) or pIRES-(TGEV-S1-PEDV-S) was significantly increased (p,0.05) relative to the PBS and pIRES controls ( Figure 4C ) and this difference remained significant (p,0.01) when cells were analyzed at 42 dpi. The values of the two time points were similar in the case of the mice immunized with pIRES-(TGEV-S1-PEDV-S). In the pIRES-(TGEV-S1-PEDV-S1) group, the proliferation values at 42 dpi were slightly but significantly lower (p,0.05). As shown in Figure 4D , when stimulated with TGEV-S1 protein, the proliferation of PBMC was increased at 28 and 42 dpi in mice immunized with pIRES-(TGEV-S1-PEDV-S1) and pIRES-(TGEV-S1-PEDV-S) (p,0.01) relative to PBS and pIRES controls. In the group pIRES-(TGEV-S1-PEDV-S), the proliferation significantly increased from 28 to 42 dpi whereas the proliferation of PBMC from mice immunized with pIRES-(TGEV-S1-PEDV-S1) was similar at both time points.",

DNA vaccines can induce complete immune responses, provide heterologous cross protection and can be easily prepared as polyvalent vaccines [23] . It is documented that the S1domain of TGEV/PEDV contains the main neutralizing epitopes [13, 20, 34, 39] . One report indicated that the immunogenicity of DNA plasmid bearing TGEV S1 gene is superior to another version containing the full-length S gene [29] . In contrast, there are no reports regarding comparative analysis on the efficiency of S and S1-based DNA plasmids. Therefore, this study aimed at evaluating immune response induced by DNA plasmids encoding the TGEV S protein and the PEDV S or S1 proteins using a mouse model. In pIRES vector, there is an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES), which is derived from the encephalomyocarditis virus (ECMV); two multiple cloning sites (MCS) A and B, allow each product of transcription to be translated independently with the participation of ribosome at the same time. In addition, pIRES vector has a CMV promoter for high expression of foreign genes and a SV40 enhancer/promoter that allows the enhancement of gene expression in many hosts [33] . Therefore, the genes of interest in this Figure 7 . Antibody levels in mice treated with pIRES-(TGEV-S1-PEDV-S1) and pIRES-(TGEV-S1-PEDV-S). Anti-PEDV serum antibodies (A) and anti-TGEV serum antibodies (B) in pIRES-(TGEV-S1-PEDV-S1) and pIRES-(TGEV-S1-PEDV-S) immunized mice were detected by indirect ELISA at different time points following the injection of the plasmid DNAs. The OD 490 was monitored as a function of time over a period of 42 days. w: p,0.01 (highly significant), compared with PBS, pIRES treatment groups. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0057468.g007 study were cloned into the pIRES vector. Both immunufluorescence assays and Western blot indicated that the in vitro expression of TGEV S, PEDV S or PEDV S1 proteins were successful. It is clear that the level of neutralizing antibodies is an important indicator to evaluate the effect of the vaccine. In this study, IgG levels of PEDV antibodies in pIRES-(TGEV-S1-PEDV-S1) and pIRES-(TGEV-S1-PEDV-S) groups increased between 21-42 dpi, and the differences between both groups were not significant. In addition, the values of the pIRES-(TGEV-S1-PEDV-S1) and pIRES-(TGEV-S1-PEDV-S) groups peaked at 35 dpi and decreased thereafter, but the differences between these two groups were also not significant. The IgG antibody levels against TGEV of these two groups began to increase at 28 dpi and reached the peak at 35 dpi. Between 35-42 dpi, the antibody levels decreased dramatically (p,0.01) in pIRES-(TGEV-S1-PEDV-S1) group, whereas no significant changes was observed (p.0.05) in the pIRES-(TGEV-S1-PEDV-S) group. This result showed that the recombinant plasmid pIRES-(TGEV-S1-PEDV-S) containing the full-length S protein of PDEV was better in eliciting immune responses to PEDV than is pIRES-(TGEV-S1-PEDV-S1) encoding only the S1 portion of the S protein. The IgG antibody levels and virus neutralizing assays showed that both pIRES-(TGEV-S1-PEDV-S1) and pIRES-(TGEV-S1-PEDV-S) groups could elicit humoral immune responses against PEDV and TGEV S proteins, respectively. Plasmid pIRES-(TGEV-S1-PEDV-S) was more efficient in inducing neutralizing antibodies than pIRES-(TGEV-S1-PEDV-S1).",

When stimulated with purified recombinant PEDV-S1 protein, there was Figure 8 . Levels of neutralizing antibodies in mice treated with pIRES-(TGEV-S1-PEDV-S1) and pIRES-(TGEV-S1-PEDV-S).

            "text": "Most exogenous proteins and even inactivated pathogens are internalized and processed via the endolysosomal pathway; the resulting degradation of proteins yields peptides that are associated with MHC-II molecules. They not only may stimulate antibody responses but also the production of helper T cells, which are necessary for the specificity of antibodies and CTLs production. Activated CD 4 + T cells can be classified into at least two subgroups, Th1 and Th2. The Th1-like phenotype is predominantly associated with interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interferon-c (IFN-c) [30, [43] [44] [45] [46] ; The Th2-like phenotype, characterized by increased levels of interleukin-4 (IL-4), interleukin-5 (IL-5), and interleukin-6 (IL-6), is associated with improving humoral response and mucosal immune response [21, 38] . In this study, the number of CD 4 + T lymphocytes in peripheral blood and spleen reached the peak at 42 dpi and the number of CD 4 + T cells from mice immunized with pIRES-(TGEV-S1-PEDV-S) was higher (p,0.05) than pIRES-(TGEV-S1-PEDV-S1) group. Changes in serum IFN-c and IL-4 levels in immunized mice were analyzed. The results showed that the levels of IFN-c in mice treated with DNA vaccine were significantly higher. In addition, the levels of IFN-c induced by pIRES-(TGEV-S1-PEDV-S) were higher than other groups (p,0.05). However, the levels of IL-4 in all treatment groups were fluctuant, especially, in pIRES-(TGEV-S1-PEDV-S1) and pIRES-(PEDV-S1) group the IL-4 level even much lower (P,0.05) than PBS and pIRES control. This result may be explained by the high level of IFN-c promoting the Th1 cell differentiation, at the same time, restraining the Th2 cell differentiation by down-regulating IL-4 and humoral immune response. This tendency is consistent with the IgG antibody changes in 42 dpi. Several reports also suggested that the level of antigen presentation can affect Th1/ Th2 profiles [4] .",

The reasons for seeking to specifically generate CTLs include not just their activity of directly killing infected cells (versus directly killing the virus or bacteria) but also the fact that CTLs can focus on antigens that are not Figure 9 . Activity of CTLs in spleen and peripheral blood. Cytotoxicity was analyzed using the LDH release assay. The release of LDH which is directly proportional to CTL activity was monitored as a function of time over a period of 42 days. w: p,0.01 (highly significant) compared with PBS, pIRES treatment groups. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0057468.g009 accessible to antibodies [25] . To elicit CTL responses, the antigen needs to be present in the cytoplasm of antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Then some of the newly synthesized proteins are processed in proteosomes with certain of the resultant peptides then binding to nascent MHC-I molecules for export via the Golgi to the cell surface [25] . Therefore, specific CTL activity could reflect the activity of the CD8+ T lymphocytes. In this study, the number of CD8+ T lymphocytes in peripheral blood and spleen reached the peak at 42 dpi and the number of CD8+ T cells from mice immunized with pIRES-(TGEV-S1-PEDV-S) was higher (p,0.05) than in the pIRES-(TGEV-S1-PEDV-S1) group, similar to the CD4+ T lymphocytes changes. The activity determined by the CTL assay showed that CTL function in the peripheral blood of the mice treated with pIRES-(TGEV-S1-PEDV-S1) was higher (P,0.05) than that of the PBS control, but significantly lower than in the pIRES-(TGEV-S1-PEDV-S) group (p,0.01). As with other studies, CTL functions in spleen cells were mirrored by a higher efficiency of the pIRES-(TGEV-S1-PEDV-S) group compared to the pIRES-(TGEV-S1-PEDV-S1) group.",

It has been reported that an antigenic domain in the S gene that could elicit a strong antibody response and induce neutralizing antibodies has excellent immunogenicity on the C-terminal portion of the S protein [5] .
