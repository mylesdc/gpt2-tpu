Furthermore, we examined how OspA-expressing L. plantarum breaks the oral tolerance of the gut by stimulating human intestinal epithelial cells, peripheral blood mononuclear cells and monocyte derived dendritic cells and measuring cytokine production. We show that the leader peptide of OspA targets the protein to the cell envelope of L. plantarum, and it is responsible for protein export across the membrane. Mutation of the lipidation site in OspA redirects protein localization within the cell envelope. Further, we show that lipidated-OspA-expressing L. plantarum does not induce secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-8 by intestinal epithelial cells. In addition, it breaks oral tolerance of the gut via Th1/Th2 cell mediated immunity, as shown by the production of pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines by human dendritic cells, and by the production of IgG2a and IgG1 antibodies, respectively.",

Immunological tolerance can be exploited to develop immunotherapies for autoimmune and inflammatory diseases but it is also the obstacle to the development of oral vaccines [23] . As a result of our observation that an oral vaccine based in L. plantarum expressing the OspA lipoprotein induced a protective, IgG-based, immune response in mice [12] we set out to further understand the processes that determine the immunological consequences of oral administration of antigen. We investigated the role of L. plantarum expressing OspA lipoprotein in breaking the oral tolerance of the gut and if this immune response was dependent on the lipid modification of OspA.",

To generate a vector expressing the OspA mutant, we designed primers in which we replaced the codon corresponding to Cys 17 with Asp 17 . Expression vectors were then transformed into L. plantarum strain 256 to obtain the clones LpA and LpA D17 , respectively. Protein expression was checked by immunoblot as follows. Recombinant L. plantarum cells were disrupted with a FrenchH press (Thermo Electron Corporation, Milford, MA), supernatants were analyzed on a 12% denaturing polyacrilamide gels and electrotransferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (PVDF, Millipore, Billerica, MA) for analysis with an OspAspecific monoclonal antibody (mAb 184.1). To evaluate export and lipidation of OspA and its mutant expressed by recombinant Lactobacillus, we performed Triton X-114 phase partitioning [24] . L. plantarum cultures were grown overnight at 30uC, harvested and resuspended to an OD 600 of 1.0 in PBS. Bacteria were disrupted with a FrenchH press and the insoluble material (membrane and cell wall) was separated from the cytosol fraction by centrifugation. This cell envelope fraction was suspended in 1 ml of ice-cold 2% Triton-X114 (v/v) in PBS. The fractions were rotated end over end at 4uC for 1 h and were phase-separated by warming the solution for 30 min in a water bath at 37uC followed by centrifugation for 15 min at 25uC. The separated detergent and aqueous phases were each washed three times. The solutions were then rewarmed and recentrifuged as described and the detergent and aqueous phases were collected. Ten (10) ml of each phase was analyzed on 15% denaturing polyacrylamide gels, electrotransferred to PVDF filters, and used for immunoblot analysis. OspAspecific monoclonal antibody LA2.2 (1:100) was used as primary antibody, goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (1:1000; Pierce Rockford, IL) was used as secondary antibody and the immunoblot was developed by BCIP/NBT TM (KPL, Washington, DC). The protein bands corresponding to each OspA antigen were quantified by densitometry using a Multi Image TM Light Cabinet and the AlphaEase TM software (Alpha Innotech Corporation, San Leandro, CA). The results were plotted as a percentage of the total OspA content for each recombinant Lactobacillus.",

OspA D17 in the detergent phase of LpA D17 ), then the difference (i. e. ,30% additional wildtype OspA in the detergent phase of LpA) should be protein that is associated with the cell envelope via the lipid anchor, or the lipidated form of OspA.

            "text": "Next, we performed serial fractionation experiments in order to determine where the recombinant proteins are localized within the cell envelope of L. plantarum (Fig. 3A) . We treated recombinant L. plantarum with Lysozyme (Lyz) for 45 min and separated the cell wall fraction from the protoplast by centrifugation. We then disrupted the cells and separated the membrane from the cytosol fractions by ultracentifugation. The three fractions were then analyzed on denaturing polyacrylamide gels and OspA was identified by Immunoblot with anti-OspA monoclonal antibody (mAb LA2.2). Lipidated OspA expressed in L. plantarum is exported through the membrane and accumulates in the cell wall, while unlipidated OspA D17 remains mostly attached to the membrane (Fig. 3A) . Next, we wanted to analyze the localization of the recombinant proteins on the surface of L. plantarum. We incubated live recombinant L. plantarum with and without Lyz and we performed both live-cell ELISA (lcELISA) and immunofluorescence (IFA) assays. For lcELISA, we incubated the recombinant L. plantarum with Lyz for 5 and 45 min, the cells were washed and incubated with mAb LA2.2 (Fig. 3B) . For immunofluorescence, we performed a 30 min incubation with Lyz after which the cells were washed, incubated with mAb LA2.2 followed by Fluor 488-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (1:250). Staining was visualized using a Zeiss inverted Axiovert 200 microscope (Fig. 3C) . In both assays, IFA and lcELISA, reactions without lyz (No Lyz) detect protein that is exposed on the surface of the cell. The epitope used to detect OspA and OspA D17 is located in the carboxyl terminal of the protein and is not surface exposed ( Fig. 3B and 3C) . Reactions with Lyz digest the peptidoglycan that releases the OspA that is trapped within the cell wall and expose OspA that is attached to the membrane (Lyz 5 min, 45 min or 30 min, Fig. 3B and 3C ). Our results indicate that lipidated OspA (LpA) is trapped within the cell wall. That is, a 5 min digestion with Lyz exposes a high amount of OspA that is associated with the peptidoglycan layer (Fig. 3B ) and a 45 min or 30 min digestion exposes a lower amount of OspA that is associated with the peptidoglycan layer ( Fig. 3B and 3C) , suggesting that OspA might not be attached to the membrane. In contrast, unlipidated OspA D17 (LpA D17 ) is trapped within the peptidoglycan layer of the cell wall, maybe attached to the membrane. That is, a 5 min digestion with Lyz exposes a low amount of OspA that is associated with the peptidoglycan layer (Fig. 3B ) and a 45 min or 30 min digestion exposes a high amount of OspA that is associated with the peptidoglycan layer and the membrane (Fig. 3B and 3C) . In order to analyze the potential inflammatory response to the oral administration of L. plantarum expressing OspA lipoprotein, we performed an assay using monolayer cultures of intestinal epithelial cells (T84), a human colon carcinoma cell line, stimulated with UV-killed LpA and LpA D17 and determined the production of IL-8 (Fig. 4) . The co-culture of T84 cells with UVkilled LpA or LpA D17 did not induce significant production of the pro-inflammatory chemokine IL-8 in comparison to the positive control (TNFa).",

We co-cultured MDDCs with 2.5 mg/ml of purified wt OspA or mut OspA during 48 h and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNFa, IL-12, IFNc, and antiinflammatory cytokine IL-10 was quantified by ELISA (Fig. 5A , 5B, 5C and 5D, respectively). wt OspA induced TNFa and IL-10 production (Fig 5A and 5D ) but it did not induce neither IL-12 nor IFNc ( Fig. 5B and 5C ). Compared to wt OspA, the OspA mutant lacking the leader peptide, mut OspA, showed a 10 fold-decrease in the TNFa production (Fig. 5A ) and a 2 fold-decrease in the IL-10 production (Fig. 5D ). Similarly to wt OspA, mut OspA did not induce neither IL-12 nor IFNc cytokine production ( Fig. 5B and 5C ). Differences between wt OspA and mut OspA are statistically significant (*p,0.001 and **p,0.05).",

The amount of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNFa, IL-12, IFNc and IL-6, and anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was quantified by ELISA (Fig. 6) . As compared to the control, LpA induced TNFa by 9 fold, IL-12 by 3 fold, IFNc by 4 fold and IL-6 by 10 fold (Fig. 6A, 6B, 6C and 6D) . Additionally, anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was 7 fold upregulated by stimulation with recombinant L. plantarum expressing lipidated (LpA) as compared to the control (Lp) (Fig. 6E) . Compared to LpA, the mutant L. plantarum expressing the unlipidated OspA (LpA D17 ) induced significantly less TNFa, IL-12, IFNc, IL-6 and IL-10 ( Fig. 6A, 6B, 6C, 6D and 6E ). Differences between LpA and LpA D17 are statistically significant (*p,0.001 and **p,0.02). Further, compared to the control (Lp), LpA D17 induced TNFa, IL-6 and IL-10 (p,0.001). LPS was used as a positive control and upregulated secretion of all cytokines tested (data not shown). In order to dissect these results, we further purified monocytes by MACS to derive MDDC and analyzed cytokine production after stimulation (Fig. 7) . As expected, we determined that LpA induced higher production of proinflammatory cytokines TNFa (17 fold upregulated), IL-12 (,4 fold upregulated) and IL-6 (1-2 fold upregulated) as compared to the control (Lp) (Fig. 7A, 7B and 7D, respectively). There was no production of IFNc by monocyte derived dendritic cells (Fig. 7C) . Compared to LpA, the mutant L. plantarum expressing the unlipidated OspA (LpA D17 ) abrogated this response as seen by the decreased production of TNFa, IL-12 and IL-6 ( Fig. 7A, 7B and 7D) . Additionally, IL-10 was ,2-3 fold upregulated after stimulation with recombinant L. plantarum expressing lipidated (LpA) and the mutant appeared to impair this response (Fig. 7E) .

We have recently found that L. plantarum expressing B. burgdorferi OspA lipoprotein induced the production of OspA-specific IgA and IgG antibodies as a result of oral administration [12] . In the present study, we investigated the effect of the lipid modification of OspA in the localization of the antigen in our mucosal delivery vehicle, L. plantarum. Furthermore, we investigated how recombinant L. plantarum expressing OspA lipoprotein breaks the oral tolerance of the gut. We show that the leader peptide of OspA targets the protein to the cell envelope of the delivery vehicle L. plantarum, and that the Cys 17 is the substract for OspA lipidation. Further, we show that our recombinant L. plantarum based mucosal delivery system does not induce secretion of IL-8 by intestinal epithelial cells and that it breaks oral tolerance of the gut via Th1/Th2 cell mediated immunity.",

            "text": "Expression of the full-length B. burgdorferi OspA gene in E. coli, a Gram-negative bacteria, produces a protein that is processed posttranslationally by signal peptidase II and contains an attached lipid moiety. In E. coli this lipoprotein partitions mostly into the detergent phase following extraction with Triton X-114 [35] . As seen in E. coli, we show that in Gram-positive L. plantarum, the leader peptide also marks OspA for translocation or export across the cytoplasmic membrane given that wildtype OspA partitions to the detergent phase following extraction with Triton X-114, suggesting that it is lipidated. In contrast, the mutant OspA D17 , which lacks the cystein that is needed for the lipid moiety attachment, partitions mostly to the aqueous phase. This shift on the solubility of the mutant OspA D17 appears to be due to the lack of the lipid attachment, that makes the antigen more hydrophilic than the native lipidated OspA, and therefore the mutant appears to be unlipidated. It appears that OspA is indeed lipidated and localizes mostly at the membrane-cell wall interface. This observation is consistent with a previous study of Gram-positive Lactococcus spp. lipoprotein processing that found that lipid modification is predominantly required to retain proteins at the membrane cell-wall interface [36] . The intestinal immune system is the largest and the most complex part of the immune system [23] . Crosstalk occurs between the luminal microorganisms and the mucosal tissue, with intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) mediating this dialogue. Microbial invasion of the gut epithelium stimulates IECs to produce CXCchemokine ligand 8 (IL-8) and activate other pro-inflammatory pathways that in turn coordinate the innate immune response [37] . The absence of IL-8 secretion by IECs in the presence of recombinant L. plantarum is consistent with previous findings [38] , [39] , [40] and suggests that an oral vaccine based in L. plantarum expressing the OspA lipoprotein would not induce the local adverse inflammatory effects attributed to pathogenic bacteria.",

Together with IECs, dendritic cells (DCs) interact with luminal bacteria [37] either through receiving M-cell delivered bacterial cargo or through extension of their own pseudopods across the IEC monolayer [42] , [43] , [43] . When we stimulated human PBMC-derived-dendriticcells (PBMC/DCs) with recombinant L. plantarum expressing the OspA lipoprotein, but not the unlipidated mutant, we observed that pro-inflammatory cytokines TNFa, IFNc and IL-6 were markedly upregulated. In addition, we observed an increase of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. When we stimulated monocyte derived dendritic cells (MDDC) with L. plantarum expressing lipidated OspA, but not unlipidated OspA, we observed that proinflammatory cytokines TNFa and IL-12 were markedly upregulated. Here too, we observed an increase of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Differences in detection of cytokines in both assays can be explained by the fact that in the former (PBMC/DC) assay we expect to have a mixed population of monocyte derived dendritic cells, T cells, B cells and NK cells, and in the later (MDDC), we expect to have a relatively pure population of dendritic cells. These data indicate that recombinant OspA- expressing-L. plantarum stimulates the immune response via Th1/ Th2 cell mediated immunity and that, lipidation of the antigen in the delivery agent plays an active role in this response.",

            "text": "The lipid attachment in OspA seems to be a critical determinant of the mature protein immunogenicity [35] . Furthermore, the OspA leader peptide has been fused to different proteins to generate potent lipo-antigens that induce strong B (IgG) and T-cell (helper CD4 + and cytotoxic CD8+) responses [44] , [45] . Because lipoproteins and OspA are known to trigger TLR2-based receptors [46] , [47] , we stimulated monocyte derived dendritic cells with purified proteins in order to access the effect of the naked protein on cytokine induction. We observed that wildtype OspA ( wt OspA) induced TNFa and IL-10 but it did not induce IL-12 or IFNc. In the absence of the leader peptide, as in mut OspA, the TNFa response was abrogated and IL-10 was reduced in half. In contrast, if OspA is delivered in Lactobacillus we also observe an effect on the production of IL-12. This effect appears to be related to the delivery vehicle in which OspA is presented. Furthermore, our results show that mutation of the Cys 17 on the leader peptide of OspA decreases significantly the production of pro-and antiinflammatory cytokines, and that this effect is related to the lipidation of OspA. In addition, we observed that lipidation of protein is not essential to induce a specific humoral immune response to OspA (systemic IgG and mucosal IgA) when the antigen is orally delivered by Lactobacillus. The adjuvant effect of Lactobacillus as oral carrier, exerts a synergized effect along with the intrinsic antigenicity of unlipidated OspA. This result differs with others, where the lipid modification of OspA seems to be essential to induce a humoral immune response, when the soluble unlipidated antigen is delivered subcutaneously without a cellular carrier [35] . In addition, we have found that the mutation of OspA Cys 17 skewed the systemic IgG production towards IgG2a, probably as result of a shift from a Th2 to a Th1 response. Over all, our data suggest that the lipidation of OspA has a clear role on the mixed Th1/Th2 cellular and humoral immune response to orally administered Lactobacillus expressing OspA.",

It is possible that mucosal tolerance may have been broken by two different mechanisms. In the first scenario, M cells might transport whole recombinant L. plantarum or OspA lipoprotein as it is released from lysed recombinant L. plantarum across the epithelium where they can induce primary immune responses [1] . In a second scenario, as dendritic cells uptake recombinant LAB and recognized it as the pathogen, the bacteria are no longer retained at the mesenteric lymphnode, as it happens when DCs are loaded with commensal bacteria, but instead migrate to secondary lymphoid tissue and present antigen to T-cells in a systemic environment that is not tolerigenic [49] .",
