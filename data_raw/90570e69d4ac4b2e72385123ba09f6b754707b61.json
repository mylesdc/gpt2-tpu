After systematically searching the National Library of Medicine (PubMed), Cochrane Library, Elsevier, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), VIP databases, and WANFANG databases, 9 randomized placebo-controlled trials were included in our meta-analysis in RevMan 5.3 software, all of which were in English. Results. In the evaluation of vitamin C, administration of extra therapeutic doses at the onset of cold despite routine supplementation was found to help reduce its duration (mean difference (MD) = -0.56, 95% confidence interval (CI) [-1.03, -0.10], and P = 0.02), shorten the time of confinement indoors (MD = -0.41, 95% CI [-0.62, -0.19], and P = 0.0002), and relieve the symptoms associated with it, including chest pain (MD = -0.40, 95% CI [-0.77, -0.03], and P = 0.03), fever (MD = -0.45, 95% CI [-0.78, -0.11], and P = 0.009), and chills (MD = -0.36, 95% CI [-0.65, -0.07], and P = 0.01). Conclusions. Extra doses of vitamin C could benefit some patients who contract the common cold despite taking daily vitamin C supplements.",

About 70-80% of URTIs are caused by viruses, like rhinovirus, coronavirus, adenovirus, influenza and parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza A virus, and Coxsackie virus, and the other 20-30% are caused by bacteria [2, 4, 5] . Influenza is caused by the influenza virus, three subtypes of which affect humans (influenza viruses A, B, and C [6] ); 30-80% of the cases of common cold have been attributed to over 200 strains of rhinoviruses [7, 8] . Influenza is highly contagious, with serious systemic symptoms and mild respiratory symptoms; its peak prevalence is in winter and spring; there are also global outbreaks and epidemics periodically [9] [10] [11] [12] .",

The onset of the common cold is more acute, usually with nasal catarrh in the early stage. The common cold occurs in patients with low immunity, and the onset is seen year-round but more often 2 BioMed Research International in autumn, winter, and spring. The reason for the seasonality has not been conclusively determined. Further, people under great psychological stress [14] or undergoing intense training have a higher tendency to develop common colds [15, 16] . There are some reports stating that adults contract approximately 2 to 5 infections per year [17] ; meanwhile, children develop common colds 6-10 times annually (up to 12 times among school children) [18] . The common cold does little harm on its own; however, it can be a serious complication when other diseases like pneumonia or meningitis develop comorbidly [19] . Despite rapid developments in science and medical technology, the common cold continues to pose a heavy burden worldwide, whether on human health or on economic losses. Fendrick AM et al. [20] reported that the economic burden attributed to the common cold in the US alone is US $40 billion annually (95% confidence interval (CI), $31.2-$48.0 billion). According to the data of the World Health Organization (WHO) from 2013, in America, the common cold accounted for 75-100 million physician visits per year at a conservative cost of US $7.7 billion per year, of which US $2.9 billion were for over-the-counter drugs and US $400 million were for prescription medicines. Additionally, an estimated 22 to 189 million school days were missed because of common colds, leading to 126 million missed workdays to look after children at home [21] .",

Current conventional symptomatic therapies are as follows: nasal decongestants; antihistamines (common cold may lead to a transient bronchial hypersensitivity; thus antihistamines are used); cough suppressants; nonsteroidal antipyretic analgesics, like aspirin; and expectorants. Additionally, identified in the early 1900s, in the search for the etiology of scurvy [22] , vitamin C has been widely utilized in the prevention and treatment of the common cold or URTIs, with conflicting results with respect to its prophylactic effect. Some evidence has indicated that vitamin C could decrease the incidence of common cold and the duration of symptoms if taken regularly. Pitt et al. [23] found a reduction in the incidence of the common cold or associated morbidity among US Marines who were restricted to 2 g/day of vitamin C. In Constantini's study [24] , vitamin C halved the duration of URTI episodes in male swimmers. More than 1 g/day of vitamin C shortened the duration of colds in adults by 8% and in children by 18% [25] [26] [27] [28] .",

Comparing with that, we could not come to the same conclusion (MD = 0.10, 95% CI [-0.64, 0.84], and P = 0.80), due to a strong heterogeneity like the differences of sex and dosage. Studies, respectively, conducted by Elwood PC [33] and Tyrrell DA [34] indicated that mere therapeutic doses of vitamin C were effective in males rather than females. It shortened the main duration (MD = -1.73/MD = -1.10), reduced the nasal congestion or running nose (MD = -0.69), and relieved the limb and muscle pain (MD = -0.11) in men. Given the sex differences in the effectiveness of the therapeutic doses of vitamin C, it is crucial to involve more intervention studies and to perform analysis based on gender or even age and intervention dosage.",

Immediately, this view spread globally. This concept is disputable and controversial, and there is a lack of sufficient evidence to support the use of vitamin C in the prevention and treatment of the common cold in the general population [42, 43] . Despite this, vitamin C is still widely administered during the common colds, and some evidence showed that it may reduce the duration of illness [27, 44] . The Swiss scientist Wintergerst E.S. [45] insists that because of its immune-enhancing effects vitamin C makes the body more capable of fighting off the virus, lessening the duration of the symptoms of the common cold. Vitamin C is concentrated in leukocytes, and its concentration rapidly declines during infections and stress. Vitamin C supplementation improves the ability to resist infection by improving the activities of the immune system, such as antimicrobial and natural killer cell activities, lymphocyte proliferation, chemotaxis, and delayed-type hypersensitivity [45] . Vitamin C also contributes to hormone regulation, including activation of the sympathetic nervous system and secretion of epinephrine during abnormal stress [46] . Additionally, vitamin C works at maintaining the redox integrity of cells and thereby protects them against the reactive oxygen species generated during respiratory burst and the inflammatory response [45] .

First, in some cases the data has to be calculated and transformed rather than being available directly. In some cases, the data were not suitable for a meta-analysis but were more suitable for a descriptive analysis because the 9 trials comparing vitamin C with placebo were relatively early trials. As a result, we eliminated several trials from our metaanalysis, weakening the exactness and representativeness of our data. Second, we were unable to recommend how many doses of vitamin C should be administered regularly and at the onset of a cold because there were no appropriate data (an obvious heterogeneity of the dosage before illness) to explore the dose-response relationship.
