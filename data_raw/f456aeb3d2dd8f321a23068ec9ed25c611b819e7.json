Vaccinations and therapies are only available for relatively few virus infections and not always where they are needed. However, knowledge of transmission routes can prevent virus infection. In the context of this study, we measured the effects of a secondary school education module, named Viruskenner, on knowledge, attitude, and risk behavior as these relate to virus infections. A nonrandomized intervention study was conducted between April and August 2015 to assess the effect of this 2-month education module on knowledge, attitude, and behavior of 684 secondary school students in the Netherlands, Suriname, and Indonesia. For the Netherlands, a control group of a further 184 students was added. Factor analysis was performed on questions pertaining to attitude and behavior. Comparative analyses between pre-and posttest per country were done using multiple linear regression, independent sample T-tests, and one-way analysis of variance. These showed a significant increase in knowledge about virus infections and the prevention of infectious diseases among the Dutch and Surinamese groups, whereas a trend of increased knowledge was evident among the Indonesian participants. The Dutch control group showed an overall decrease in knowledge. Regression analyses showed that there was a significant interaction effect between participation and time on knowledge, attitude, and awareness and behavior and risk infection. Attitudes improved significantly in the intervention group. Pearson correlation coefficients between knowledge, attitude, and behavior were found to be positive.",

            "text": "Viruses are responsible for almost half of all emerging infections worldwide and are among the most emerging pathogens. [1] [2] [3] Most virus infections are not treatable with antivirals and neither are they preventable with vaccines. Therefore, education plays a key role in raising awareness for infectious diseases and preventing the spread of virus infections. 4 A population that is aware of the different ways a virus can be transmitted and does know how to embed effective preventive methods in daily life can protect themselves against virus infections. This principle is based on the knowledge, attitude, behavior (KAB) model, showing that increased knowledge can change people's attitudes and lead to behavioral change. [5] [6] [7] A foundation for health-related attitudes and behavior is laid in early stages of life. Following many theories, the likelihood of changing attitude is high in adolescence. 8 Also, the World Health Organization (WHO) states with their Health Promoting School Framework that schools are a good environment to start promoting health. 9 Five years ago, a consortium of scientists and teachers developed a school-based education module named Viruskenner, regarding virus infections. This module aimed to teach students how to prevent virus infections. The module started with one secondary school in the Netherlands and evolved to a project with eight different secondary schools in the Netherlands. In 2014, the first Surinamese school joined and in 2015 the first Indonesian school. These two countries were already involved with the organizing institute by an international collaboration on emerging infectious disease population studies, facilitating easy communication and logistics. The Viruskenner module was extensively evaluated by independent researchers in the early years of the project. The conclusions of these evaluations led to improvement of the module and the questionnaires used. For example, in 2012, the concept of students being coached by an infectious disease expert was introduced. When becoming an international education module, it was interesting to see the impact of Viruskenner in different countries on knowledge, attitudes, and behavior as they relate to virus infections, and find out which educational factors play a role in these changes.",

            "text": "Educational programs that address infectious diseases are quite common, although most education is focused on a specific infection or a group of infections, particularly human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and other sexually transmitted infections. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated 64 school-based sex education programs in middleand low-income countries. Most of these programs (55 of 64) focused on comprehensive sex education, with the remaining nine focusing on sexual abstinence. About half of the studies (33) were included in the meta-analysis and showed an overall positive effect on HIV-related knowledge, condom use, the initiation of sexual intercourse, the number of sexual partners, and self-efficacy. 10 Although HIV is among the virus infections that place the highest burden on society, it is not the only virus that significantly impacts global health. Besides HIV, lower respiratory tract infections (e.g., influenza), and diarrheal diseases (like norovirus) also belong to the 10 leading contributors to the global burden of disease. 11 Furthermore, arthropodborne diseases (like dengue) have a very high incidence. 12 Remarkably, virus infections other than HIV are less frequently addressed in education modules. For example, only a few trials were carried out to measure the impact of an educational intervention for viral hepatitis, human papillomavirus (HPV), dengue, and influenza. [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] Most of the educational interventions that were analyzed showed positive results in improving knowledge and attitude pertaining to the subject of the intervention. Given the success of education programs about HIV, education modules about other virus infections that have global impact might also work. We developed an education module that focuses on multiple viruses with different transmission routes and all with global impact: HIV, dengue, hantavirus, chikungunya, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus, HPV, norovirus, viral hepatitis, measles, and influenza. We studied the efficacy and success of the education module in three countries, Netherlands, Suriname, and Indonesia, each differing in culture, circulating viruses, and infection pressure. The education module aims to effectively increase knowledge, attitudes, and behavior regarding several virus infections in each of these different circumstances.",

A control group for the Dutch intervention group was selected at one of the participating Dutch schools. Thus, although they had not opted for the Technasium curriculum, they do have a similar background and social environment. School curricula are defined differently in each country. In the Netherlands, students choose a profile and we defined \"nature and science\" and \"nature and health\" as scientific profiles. In Suriname, students can choose biology, and we defined this as a scientific profile. Indonesian students can choose between a social profile (Ilmu Pengetahuan Sosial [IPS]) and a science profile (Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam [IPA]). We defined IPA as a scientific profile. In both Suriname and Indonesia, schools that matched most closely, in terms of grade and education level, with the Dutch intervention group were invited to participate in the study.

Students are challenged to create a prevention tool for a specific virus infection. By involving students in real-life science-based problems and stimulating active learning (searching for information, test possible solutions and present their idea) a high impact can be achieved. [22] [23] [24] In each country, the 2-month module started with a national opening day, during which all participants of that country were introduced to the field of infectious diseases and viruses by means of four short lectures from experts in the field of virology, public health, and infectious diseases. An optimal learning effect can be reached by bringing students in contact with experts. 25 So, in all countries one or two Dutch experts from the department of Viroscience in the Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam were assigned to a class to coach them during the project. The students were supposed to work in groups of four to six students in competition with the other groups. 22, 26 Each group worked on one of the viruses of the subject list including HIV, dengue, hantavirus, chikungunya, MERS coronavirus, HPV, norovirus, viral hepatitis, measles, and influenza. Students developed a prevention tool to disseminate this knowledge among their peers and, in doing so, help prevent virus infections that impact local or global health. During the three national final days (one in each country), the best groups per class, selected by the teachers and coach during a school final, presented their results and final product to their peer students and a jury. This independent jury was selected per country and based on proven expertise in virology, communication strategy, and/or overall creativity.",

Given that there was no validated instrument to assess knowledge, attitude, and behavior regarding several viral infections, we used a self-designed questionnaire (Supplemental Table 1 ). The questionnaire was based on 5 years' experience with the education module. A team comprising two senior virologists, a communication scientist, and an education expert developed the questionnaire, which was refined after a pilot with a group of 60 students from a school similar to the participating schools.

This is the most popular type of rotation because it makes the interpretation of the data more reliable and easier. 31 One of the behavior items (\"I do not use a condom when I have sexual intercourse\") was excluded because of more than 10% missing values. The remaining missing values were randomly spread over the sample population. The sample size was big enough to delete these cases list wise. The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) value is a statistic that measures how much two random variables correlate. A KMO value greater than 0.8 represents a small partial correlation which makes a factor analysis more useful. In this study, the KMO value was 0.849, which means there were relatively compact patterns of correlations and the factor analysis would provide reliable components. 32 The number of extracted factors was based on the objective and interpretability criteria mentioned in Sch\u00f6nrock-Adema and others: 1) the screen test, 2) eigenvalues > 1.5, 3) > 5% of the variance explained by all factors, and 4) interpretability. However, the criterion of eigenvalue > 1.5 led to only two components, which was not interpretable. Therefore, we set the norm of an eigenvalue back to greater than one (Kaiser's criterion). 33, 34 The PCA with varimax rotation finally resulted in four components. The reliability per component was calculated by Cronbach's alpha (Table 1 ). Internal consistency for the components \"attitude and awareness\" and \"behavior and life science\" was above 0.7 and therefore acceptable. The components \"attitude and risk infections\" and \"behavior and risk infection\" should be interpreted with caution, because of the diversity of the constructs. 35 An additional instrument to measure knowledge was a live multiple-choice quiz, which was implemented at the end of the final day. In the Netherlands and Suriname, portable electronic devices (keypad and software from Interactive Voting System \u00ae ) were used by the students to answer 40 knowledge questions. In Indonesia, these portable electronic devices were not available, so the knowledge quiz was done by voting with colored papers; therefore, recording these results was not possible.",

Although the teacher interviews were carried out in the Netherlands only, the module was evaluated in each country. In Suriname and Indonesia, the project was evaluated with the local organizing teams but not per individual teacher. In the Indonesian and Surinamese culture, hierarchy is strong and extensive evaluation uncommon. Therefore, the teachers preferred a general evaluation with the head of the school.

The Dutch teacher interviews were semistructured and took about 30 minutes each.

Another striking fact in Indonesia was the relatively high scores for attitude and awareness and behavior, in both pre-and posttests.

Multiple participating schools per country would have added value as it would have enabled us to perform a proper multilevel analysis, instead of a multiple linear regression analysis. Furthermore, it might be good to measure any balancing measure, for example, the mean grades, to determine whether there are any unanticipated harms to scores on other subjects in school, due to the time the students spent on the project. Although the project is embedded in the curriculum, the harms to other subject would be minimized. The questionnaires were composed with accuracy in Dutch (the national language in the Netherlands as well as in Suriname).

In self-reported questionnaires these outcomes improved significantly in some studies, which is promising. However, other studies did not find a significant improvement. 10, 41, 45, 47, 52 We found two studies, both conducted in Africa, that tested behavioral change based on the prevalence of virus infections. In them, participants' blood samples were tested for HIV and herpes simplex virus antibodies, before and 3-8 years after an education module or compared with a control group. However, no significant differences were evident in infection rates. 53, 54 So what factors play a role in making an educational intervention effective in changing behavior? We found some studies that based their intervention on the Health Promoting School Framework of the WHO proved to be successful in changing health-related behavior. 55 Important elements of this framework which were applied in these studies were implementation of the intervention in the school curriculum, involvement of the school environment in the project, and involvement of family and society in the intervention. 55, 56 The Viruskenner education module was implemented in the Technasium curriculum in the Netherlands, but was not part of the curriculum in Suriname and Indonesia. The family and society were involved in the project, particularly in the Netherlands and Suriname. However, stronger involvement of the school environment and ethos in prevention of infectious diseases might increase the impact of the intervention on attitude and behavior in all countries. This might be reached by additional interventions like handwashing posters in the sanitary facilities or selling machines for mosquito nets in the schoolyard, for example. Knowledge that is not translated into behavior change would not make a difference in numbers of virus infections. So adjustments to the Viruskenner module are needed to have a greater impact on attitude and behavior. Active learning has the best chance of being successful if every individual student participates. Students' families have to be closer involved and a sharper focus on infection prevention in school environments is needed. Increasing knowledge is a great first step, because it correlates with attitude and behavior. However, significant improvements in attitude and behavior must be reached to have a possible impact on infection rates. Therefore, further exploration of contributing elements of education modules that reached behavioral changes would be very useful.",
