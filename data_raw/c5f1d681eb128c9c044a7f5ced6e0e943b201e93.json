Schiff base-metal compounds have been reported to have promising antibacterial and antitumor activities [6, 7] , while the Schiff base coordinated with copper compounds shows the most prominent in the class of molecules [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . Schiff base copper(II) compounds effectively bind to DNA via the DNA grooves, and the binding between the copper ion and DNA is much stronger compared to other essential elements [14] . The potential anticancer effects of Schiff base copper compounds are well reported in various cancer cell lines, including oxidative DNA cleavage to kill cancer stem cell-enriched cells (HMLER-shEcad) and bulk cancer cells (HMLER) [15] , inducing apoptosis in lung (A-549) and breast (MDA-MB-231) human cancer cell lines [16] , and inducing necrotic cell death and autophagy in breast Xia et al. Cancer Cell Int (2019) 19:81 cancer cells (MCF-7) [17] . The anticancer effects of Schiff base copper compounds are also investigated in in vivo studies. In a diethylnitrosamine-induced liver carcinoma study, Schiff base heterodinuclear copper(II)Mn(II) complex is significantly decreased the incidence and the number of hepatic nodules in a dose-dependent manner via regulating inflammation response and apoptotic pathway [18] . A nephrotoxicity study shows that, whereas cisplatin increases serum urea nitrogen and creatinine levels, no increase in serum biochemical parameters is detected in the animals treated with Schiff base heterodinuclear copper(II)Mn(II) complex [18] . While a major obstacle to widespread use of cisplatin is the persistence of toxic side effects and drug-resistance, Schiff base coordinated copper compounds may be a novel chemotherapeutic strategy for antitumor therapy, with the potential to overcome cisplatin's shortcoming.",

Dual AO/EB, Hoechst 33258 and DAPI staining were performed in both SGC-7901 and BGC-823 cells treated with SBCCC. AO, a cell-permeant dye, emitted green fluorescence when bounded to dsDNA but emitted red fluorescence when bounded to ssDNA. This unique characteristic of AO staining allowed us to b Right, flow cytometry analysis for cell growth cycle (*P < 0.05 for G1 phase; # P < 0.05 for S phase) evaluate the cell-DNA structure affected by SBCCC. EB only entered cells with damaged membranes and emitting orange-red fluorescence when bound to concentrated DNA fragments. Therefore, dual AO/EB staining allowed us to detect early apoptotic cells, late apoptotic cells, and dead cells. The result indicated that gastric cancer cells with 1 \u03bcM SBCCC treatment showed gradually orange color for 12 h. The numbers of orangestained cells were increased at 24 h, and a portion of the SBCCC treated cells turned to red and orange-red at 36 h (Fig. 3a) .

However, the cell colony formation number in the cells with PDTC treatment was not as less as that in the cells with SBCCC treatment (Fig. 4c) , indicating that other pathways might contribute to the cell death by SBCCC, in addition to its NF-\u03baB inhibitory effect.

            "text": "NF-\u03baB was reported as a pleiotropic transcription factor activated by low levels of ROS but inhibited by antioxidants [25] . Further experiment was performed to determine if the SBCCC induced apoptosis could be ROS-dependent in addition to NF-\u03baB signaling. Interestingly, the ROS inhibitor (NAC) alone or in combination with SBCCC did not significantly affect NF-\u03baB signaling (Fig. 5a) . Although ROS could act as upstream signaling of the NF-\u03baB pathway, our results indicated that the cellkilling effect of SBCCC were from both ROS-dependent DNA cleavage and inhibition of NF-\u03baB signaling. As that SBCCC induced increases of autophagic vacuoles (MDC staining), the important molecular targets of autophagy were further evaluated. The protein expressions of Beclin-1 and LC-3II were significantly increased in SGC-7901 and BGC-823 cells with SBCCC treatment compared to the control cells (Fig. 5b) . To further elucidate the autophagy signal linking to NF-\u03baB or ROS pathways, NAC and PDTC were used in combination with the SBCCC to treat SGC-7901 and BGC-823 cells. PDTC did not affect SBCCC induced increases of Beclin-1 and LC-3II (Fig. 5c ), but NAC significantly attenuated the SBCCC induced protein expressions of Beclin-1 and LC-3II (Fig. 5d) . These results suggested that SBCCC associated autophagy was ROS-dependent but not via the NF-\u03baB signaling.",

            "text": "Metal-based compounds were widely used in the treatment of diseases [26] . The discovery of cisplatin in 1960 was a milestone in the history of metal-based compounds used in the treatment of cancers [27] . Cisplatin is highly reactive and covalently binds to DNA to form DNA-cisplatin adducts, which in turn induce DNA damage, inhibit cell replication, and induce apoptosis. Unfortunately, the side-effects such as peripheral neuropathy and nephropathy were concerned for clinical use, and the tumor cells could develop resistance mechanisms to those platinum drugs by repairing the DNA damage [28] . In past decade, there was a shift in the research focus of metal-based antitumor drugs towards copper [29] , an essential element of the human body showing less toxicity during tumor treatment [30] . Copper coordinated compounds were different from platinum in many aspects, including physiological distribution in the body, intracellular aggregation properties, inhibiting cell proliferation, rendering the potential of copper-based with less toxicity and avoiding resistance [31] . In this study, a new synthesized SBCCC was investigated in regards of its antitumor properties in two gastric cancer cell lines as well as a xenograft mouse model of gastric cancer. The IC50 of SBCCC for the two gastric cancer cells was 1 \u00b5M, which was much less than cisplatin IC50 which ranged from 2.5 to 50 \u00b5M in multiple human cancer cell lines [32] . The lower IC50 could render SBCCC with the potential of less side-effect for clinical application. The SBCCC induced cell death was demonstrated by multiple techniques, including flow cytometry, dual AO/EB staining, Hoechst 33258 staining, and DAPI staining. The SBCCC-treated cells showed cytoplasmic shrinkage, membrane blebbing, and DNA fragmentation, which were the signature features of apoptosis reported by previous studies [33, 34] .",

Our results agreed with previous reports in which inhibition of NF-\u03baB transactivation by Schiff basederived metal complex [35, 36] . It was reported that ROS induced apoptosis via destruction of mitochondrial membranes, release of cytochrome C from mitochondria, the downstream activation of the caspase system ensues [37] [38] [39] . In our study, ROS was produced in the gastric cancer cells with SBCCC treatment, indicating that ROS production was a significant mechanism contributing to cell death. Using inhibitors to block both ROS and NF-\u03baB, we demonstrated that the cell-killing effect of SBCCC was attributed to not only mitochondrial apoptosis directly triggered by ROS-dependent DNA cleavage, but also amplified apoptotic signaling via inhibition of NF-\u03baB transactivation. ROS-dependent autophagy was reported as a novel strategy to kill multidrug-resistant cancer cells [40, 41] . A previous study showed that copper(II) complex induced cell death via ROS-mediated autophagy [42] . The ROS-dependent autophagy by SBCCC was demonstrated in this study. When treated with ROS inhibitor NAC, the SBCCC induced activation of autophagy was totally abolished. ROS acted as upstream signaling for the autophagy pathway activation with SBCCC treatment to induce the autophagy associated cell death. The potential anti-tumor mechanisms of SBCCC were addressed in this study including (1) inhibition of NF-\u03baB signaling; (2) ROS production; and (3) autophagy. Our data suggested that SBCCC could be a novel agent to overcome the multidrug-resistance of cancer cells, through various cell-killing mechanisms.",
