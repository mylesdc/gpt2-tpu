            "text": "Recruitment into the military and congregation of recruits in training camps brings together many people from geographically diverse areas into close living conditions. Similar to other settings, such as college dormitories, sports teams, and cruise ships, the close physical proximity of individuals in military barracks enhances the risk of the transmission of respiratory and enteric pathogens. The congregation of diverse individuals can lead to the introduction of one or more pathogens into a confined population, leading to an outbreak of infections. Institutions that permit frequent, longer term, and intimate contacts among individuals generally can be expected to have higher attack rates. 1 Other factors such as physical exertion and the prevalence of immunologically na\u20ac \u0131ve individuals can contribute to the unique vulnerability of military recruits. 2 Militaries are a unique subset of institutions that potentially have higher attack rates than other societal groupings. Military personnel and children may be at greater risk of infection than other groups. 1 The effect of school closures during epidemics have demonstrated that environments with high people density can function as amplifying arenas for influenza and other respiratory diseases. 3 The large-scale mobilization of military forces during World War I was a contributing factor to the global influenza pandemic of 1918-1919. 4, 5 In the years since then, much research has been done to study respiratory illness among U.S. military recruits. The Commission on Acute Respiratory Diseases conducted studies at United States recruiting camps documenting that rates of respiratory disease among recruits were higher than other 'seasoned' military groups. 6 Miller et al. noted a direct correlation between changes in rates of pneumonia and respiratory illness with the number of recruits in training. The number of recruits proved to be an even stronger determinant of infection rates than seasonal factors. 7 In a more recent study examining influenza vaccine, rates of influenza-like illness (ILI) among recruits were found to be 2-16 times higher than non-recruit service members. 8 In spite of widespread immunization among U.S. military personnel, influenza outbreaks continue to occur in crowded military settings. 9,10 More recently, human adenovirus (H-AdV) has been a predominant cause of febrile respiratory illness in the U.S. military. 11 While more is known about the respiratory illness experience of U.S. military personnel, little is known about the experience of military populations of other countries in the tropics and Asia, an area that is very important in the global ecology of influenza. 12 Vaccination uptake in developing nations is considerably less than it is in developed countries and is not mandatory in the militaries of many countries including Thailand. Furthermore, the prevailing circulating viruses are unknown. Influenza which has well defined seasonality in temperate climates is far more difficult to characterize in the middle latitudes of the tropics. 13 We report the results of a respiratory illness study among new military recruits at a Royal Thai Army (RTA) barracks in Bangkok, Thailand. These results were complemented by laboratory testing to confirm infection including multiplex PCR.",

A larger study involving thousands of individuals, particularly after the beginning of the rainy season, would be more likely to capture such outbreaks.

In the U.S. military, the evidence suggests that most cases arise from internal transmission in which recruits infect one another rather than repeatedly being infected from outside the barracks. 21 In one study in a U.S. barracks, the incidence of acute respiratory illness rose rapidly in the first few weeks, peaked in week 5, then declined by week 7 to below week 1 levels toward the end of training. 22 The trend in our study of decreasing rates of infection over the course of basic training in three of the four classes supports the notion of initial seeding by new recruits infected from the outside with subsequent internal transmission leading to high initial rates followed by a decline due to depletion of susceptibles. Further support comes from the pattern of infections relative to bed location in the barracks. Though not significant, the likelihood of having a respiratory infection tended to increase with proximity to the bed of someone with URI/ILI. It should also be noted that recruits from each class were effectively sequestered from the outside during basic training. Though it is possible that the training instructors were allowed to come and go from the camp and, therefore, may have offered an opportunity for pathogens to be introduced from the outside, the instructors also slept in the barracks.

For logistical reasons, we were unable to begin illness surveillance until 2-3 weeks had elapsed after initiation of basic training. Therefore, the first generations of infectious transmission were not observed to effectively characterize the possible initial increase in infection rates as may be expected under the conditions of internal transmission alone. We relied instead on the evidence provided by the tendency for decreasing transmission toward the end of training. The clustering statistic for distance between beds may be diluted due to other recruit activities done in close proximity such as eating, common toilets and instruction. Another limitation was that our study relied on syndromic surveillance. Thus, we had little opportunity to observe asymptomatic cases. Also, we could not be certain that pathogen exposure from the outside did not occur over the course of training. Furthermore, while a corpsman did routinely remind soldiers that they were to report any illnesses, some illnesses may have been missed. When illnesses were reported, they occurred in temporal clusters, suggesting that other, perhaps social factors, may have precipitated reporting.

The conditions for enhanced disease transmission in the RTA barracks may also have been different from barracks in more temperate climates such as the United States. For example, the RTA barracks were very well ventilated with wide open windows in the sleeping quarters. Also, other activities such as classroom training and eating occurred in the open air or under a roof only. It is possible that these factors could have potentially dampened intense internal transmission. Other simple interventions could also potentially be considered to mitigate transmission such as arranging sleeping cots foot to foot instead of head to head or organizing training activities and sleeping arrangements into discrete clusters. Our findings are consistent with the dynamic of infections harbored by a few individuals upon entry into a military barracks and spreading over successive generations of transmission until susceptible individuals are depleted. Our study is effectively a random selection of an event that frequently takes place both in and out of the military. In this instance, the pathogens that caused infections produced mild disease. What is significant is that such congregations of people await the chance introduction of more virulent and/ or communicable infections such as measles, mumps, norovirus, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, influenza, or emerging infections with significant potential for more debilitating disease or mortality.",
