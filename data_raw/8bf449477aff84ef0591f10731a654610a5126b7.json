Lentivirus-mediated TACE shRNA was injected into the abdominal aortic plaques of rabbits which effectively down-regulated TACE expression and activities from week 8 to week 16. TACE gene silencing reduced remodeling index and plaque burden, and diminished the content of macrophages and lipids while increased that of smooth muscle cells and collagen in the aortic plaques. In addition, TACE gene silencing attenuated the local expression of P65, iNOS, ICAM-1, VEGF and Flt-1 and activities of MMP9 and MMP2 while increased the local expression of TGF-\u03b21 together with reduced number of neovessels in the aorta. TACE shRNA treatment resulted in down-regulated expression of TACE in macrophages and blunted ERK-P38 phosphorylation and tube formation of co-cultured mouse vascular smooth muscle cells or human umbilical vein endothelial cells. In conclusion, gene silencing of TACE enhanced plaque stability and improved vascular positive remodeling. The mechanisms may involve attenuated local inflammation, neovascularization and MMP activation, as well as enhanced collagen production probably via down-regulated ERK-NF-\u03baB and upregulated TGF-\u03b21 signaling pathways.",

            "text": "Tumor necrosis factor alpha converting enzyme (TACE), also known as ADAM17 (A disintegrin and A metalloproteinase 17), was initially discovered as a protease that cleaves the 26-kDa precursor of TNF-\u03b1 and sheds transmembrane TNF-\u03b1 to generate a soluble form of TNF-\u03b1 that can bind to TNF-\u03b1 receptors to induce inflammatory response 1 . Recently it has been recognized that TACE is a type I transmembrane protein and a member of a superfamily of Zn dependent metalloproteases. The major physiological role of TACE is to regulate the proteolytic release of a number of growth factors, cytokines, adhesion molecules and cleavage enzymes from cellular membrane 2,3 . The major pro-inflammatory cytokine processed by TACE is TNF-\u03b1 which is produced by macrophages, monocytes and T-cells, and acts as a major player in the pathogenesis of inflammation. It has been increasingly recognized that TACE-mediated shedding is involved in a variety of diseases such as ischemia, heart failure, arthritis, atherosclerosis, diabetes, cancer, neurological and immune diseases 3-5 . Ashley EA et al. provided functional evidence for TACE as a candidate gene of atherosclerosis susceptibility and found that polymorphisms of the TACE genes had relation to cardiovascular mortality in humans 6 . Canault M et al. found that TACE expression was associated with lesion formation in atherosclerosis-prone sites of apolipoprotein E-knockout (ApoE -/-) mice 7 . Oksala N demonstrated that TACE was upregulated in advanced human atherosclerotic lesions in samples from carotid, aortic, and femoral arteries compared to samples from internal thoracic artery free of atherosclerotic plaques 8 . In addition, Stoehr R et al. showed that loss of TIMP3, an endogenous inhibitor of TACE, exacerbated atherosclerosis 1",

            "text": "Pathological studies have demonstrated that in the majority of patients with acute coronary syndromes, the culprit lesions are caused by intraluminal thrombosis secondary to rupture of vulnerable plaques, which are characterized by thinning of the fibrous cap, scarcity of collagen and smooth muscle cells, abundance of macrophages and activated T cells, and intraplaque neovascularization 10, 11 . Although a variety of mechanisms have been proposed, overwhelming evidence suggests that local inflammation plays a major role in initiating the cascade of plaque instability 12 . Macrophages abundant in vulnerable plaque excrete a variety of cytokines and matrix-metalloproteinases (MMPs), which may impede the synthesis or accelerate the degradation of collagen in the fibrous cap, leading to so called thin-cap fibroatheroma. Our previous study in vitro demonstrated that TNF-\u03b1 suppresses collagen production by specifically inhibiting P4H\u03b1 1, a rate-limiting enzyme for collagen synthesis, via a novel ASK1-JNK-NonO pathway 13 . However, the effect of TACE on collagen production and degradation in atherosclerotic plaques is still unknown. In the present study, we hypothesized that TACE may promote plaque instability by enhancing inflammatory response in atherosclerotic lesions and gene silencing of TACE may attenuate lesion inflammation and positive vascular remodeling and thus enhance plaque stability. A series of in vivo and in vitro experiments were designed and performed to test this hypothesis and the possible mechanisms underlying these effects were investigated.",

The intra-plaque injection method has proven an effective approach to transferring gene into atherosclerotic plaques 14, 15 . To examine the efficacy of lentivirus-mediated gene silencing in vivo, the levels of mRNA and protein expression of TACE in the abdominal aortic plaques was detected by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. Compared with the control group, the TACE protein expression levels in the TACE shRNA group were lowered by 53.5%, 70.4% and 65.1% at 1 week, 2 weeks and 8 weeks after lentivirus transfection, respectively (all P < 0.05, Supplementary Fig. 2A , 2C) and the TACE mRNA expression level in the TACE shRNA group was reduced by 61.3%, 76.9% and 70.1% at 1 week, 2 weeks and 8 weeks after transfection, respectively (all P < 0.05, Supplementary Fig. 2B ).

However, the causative role of TACE in plaque stability remains obscure. In the current study, we firstly reported that endogenous TACE was highly expressed in unstable plaques and gene silencing of TACE enhanced plaque stability and improved vascular positive remodeling. The mechanisms mediating these salutary effects may involve attenuated macrophage infiltration, inflammatory cytokine expression, neovascularization and MMP2 and MMP9 activation, as well as enhanced collagen production in atherosclerotic plaques probably via down-regulated ERK-NF-\u03ba B signaling pathway and up-regulated TGF-\u03b2 1 signaling.",

            "text": "In the majority of patients with acute coronary syndromes, the adverse cardiovascular events are caused by rupture of vulnerable plaques 16 . Pathologically, vulnerable plaques are characterized by a large necrotic core, a thin fibrous cap, abundant macrophages and scarce collagen and SMCs 17 . Although an ideal animal model of unstable plaques has yet to be established, rupture-prone plaques in NZW rabbits receiving aortic balloon injury and a high cholesterol diet exhibited many human pathological features of unstable plaques as shown by our previous studies 14, 18 . In several previously published reports, a fibrous cap thickness less than 100 \u03bc m has been identified as a marker of unstable plaques 19, 20 . Thus, we used this cut-off value to differentiate unstable from stable plaques in the present study. As expected, TACE expression was found to be significantly higher in unstable than stable plaques, and positive TACE staining was located mainly in macrophages and intimal SMCs. Moreover, TACE expression in aortic plaques correlated significantly with macrophage content and neovessel number in plaques. These results suggest that endogenous TACE may play an important role in the progression and instability of atherosclerotic plaques. On the other hand, gene silencing of TACE in our rabbit model significantly reduced macrophages and lipid content while increased collagen content and SMCs in atherosclerotic plaques. As a consequence, plaque vulnerability index, a pathological parameter reflective of the likelihood of a given plaque to develop rupture, was greatly diminished by TACE gene silencing. These results demonstrated for the first time that TACE has a causative role in the pathogenesis of plaque instability. Moreover, the remodeling index and plaque burden in the aortic plaques were also substantially decreased in the TACE shRNA group, suggesting that TACE gene silencing is capable of not only stabilizing but also attenuating atherosclerotic plaques. An important feature of vulnerable plaques is a lack of sufficient collagen fibers in the fibrous cap to endure the mechanical stress imposed by pulsatile blood flow, which have been attributed to decreased collagen synthesis and increased collagen degradation in plaques. Our previous study found that TNF-\u03b1 directly inhibited P4H\u03b1 1, a rate-limiting enzyme for collagen synthesis, via ASK1-JNK-NonO pathway 13 , which may partially explain why gene silencing of TACE remarkably increased collagen production in the aortic plaques. In addition, increased MMP activity in plaques appears to be the most important risk factor of plaque rupture. Both MMP9 and MMP2 localized in human vulnerable plaques are capable of active collagenolysis and have been reported to contribute to plaque expansion and rupture 21, 22 . In the present study, we found that gene silencing of TACE substantially down-regulated the activities of MMP2 and MMP9, which was in accordance with a previous report that TACE may promote the transcription of MMP2 23 . Moreover, activated TACE may drive macrophage homing by generating soluble TNF-\u03b1 , while gene silencing of TACE may decrease macrophages infiltration, which may also contribute to the attenuation of MMP activities 2 . Furthermore, recent studies showed that inhibition of TACE resulted in an increased expression of TGF-\u03b2 1 signaling 24 , while TGF-\u03b2 1 signaling played a crucial role in collagen production. In this study, we found that protein expression of TGF-\u03b2 1 was significantly up-regulated in the TACE shRNA group. These results suggest that decreased activities of MMP2 and MMP9 and increased expression of TGF-\u03b2 1 are probably the two major mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of TACE gene silencing on collagen production in the aortic plaques observed in this study.",

            "text": "A wealth of evidence indicates that an intensified inflammatory response is the major mechanism responsible for plaque instability. TACE reportedly triggers the release of a large variety of substrates, including cytokines, adhesion molecules and growth factors 5 . Recently, it has been reported that angiotensin II may activate TACE which induces shedding of ACE2, a negative regulator of angiotensin II, thus leaving the pro-inflammatory effects of angiotensin II unopposed 25 . More recently, we found that C-reactive protein may activate TACE that releases soluble lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor-1 from macrophages into circulation 15 . These results suggest that inflammatory factors may activate TACE which in turn leads to increased release of soluble inflammatory factors, forming a vicious cycle of \"inflammation begetting inflammation\". The release of adhesion molecules by TACE may stimulate adhesive leukocytes to migrate and infiltrate into the inflamed tissue 26 . In this study, we found that gene silencing of TACE markedly decreased the serum levels of sTNF-\u03b1 , sICAM-1, sVCAM-1 and sMCP-1 with the most significant reduction of sTNF-\u03b1 , suggesting that TNF-\u03b1 is likely the most important substrate of TACE. Previous studies found that the deficiency of TNF-\u03b1 in ApoE -/mice reduced the lesion size of atheroma 27 , and a recent elegant study by Federici M's group clearly demonstrated that patients with a higher ADAM 17 score including sICAM-1 and sVCAM-1 exhibited increased cardiovascular events 28 . The present study revealed the independent role of sTNF-\u03b1 and sICAM-1 in plaque vulnerability in our animal model, which lent support to Federici M's study. In addition, we found TACE activity correlated more closely than sTNF-\u03b1 with plaque vulnerability index, suggesting that the salutary effects of TACE gene silencing observed in this study were probably due to inhibition of multiple substrates of TACE.",

            "text": "NF-\u03baB is known to regulate inflammatory responses by interacting with the inflammatory signaling pathways at several levels and promoting inflammatory factor expression, including iNOS and MCP-1 29,30 , whereas down-regulation of ERK signaling may inactivate NF-\u03baB as demonstrated by our previous study 31 . In the present study, we found that gene silencing of TACE substantially decreased ERK and P38 phosphorylation, and P65 and iNOS expression, suggesting that the ERK-NF-\u03ba B signaling pathway was suppressed by TACE shRNA treatment. Thus, the powerful inhibition of local inflammation may be a major contributor to the therapeutic effect of TACE gene silencing in our rabbit model. In addition, recent studies reported that neovascularization in the adventitia plays an important role in creating a conduit for lipids and inflammatory cells to be transported into plaques to enlarge the necrotic core and enhance plaque instability 32, 33 . Analysis of the atherosclerotic plaques has demonstrated that areas of tissue injury are spatially associated with infiltrating macrophages, in association with neovascularization of the media and adventitia 34 . Moreover, VEGF/Flt-1 pathway is known to enhance the production of pro-inflammatory, chemotactic mediators and adhesion molecules 35 , and potentiate their functions in an autocrine or paracrine manner 36 . Our experiment in vivo demonstrated that the increased protein expression of VEGF and its receptor Flt-1 as well as neovascularization in atherosclerotic plaques were reduced by TACE gene silencing, which lent support to a recent study that pathological neovascularization was attenuated by inactivation of TACE in endothelial cells 36, 37 . Our experiment in vitro also revealed that after HUVECs co-cultured with TACE downregulated THP-1 cells, neovessel tubes derived from HUVECs were dramatically decreased. These findings suggest that activated TACE and neovascularization contributed synergistically to the development of vulnerable plaques by increasing chemotaxis and transportation of inflammatory cells. Thus, attenuated neovascularization by TACE gene silencing also contributed considerably to the stabilization of atherosclerotic plaques. It has been claimed that TACE is unlikely involved in normal developmental angiogenesis, and thus TACE may offer a promising target for the treatment of pathological neovascularization 23 .",
