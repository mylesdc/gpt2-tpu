Syndromic surveillance is defined as \"an investigational approach where health department staff, assisted by automated data acquisition and generation of statistical alerts, monitor disease indicators in real-time or near real-time to detect outbreaks of disease earlier than would otherwise be possible with traditional public health methods\" [1] . To achieve this goal, the places to observe and the databases to analyze must meet certain prerequisites: observations must be made where patients first seek immediate care, i.e., at general practitioners (GPs), hospital emergency departments (HED) or pharmacies. Data must be accessible in real time and collected on a routine basis. Good examples of such data are over-the-counter drug sales, visits to emergency care units, which, in most hospitals, are recorded in real time, or consultations with GPs in private practice, when a system of real-time data collection is available, as is the case for the French Sentinel Network [2, 3] .",

This distinction is particularly relevant in the context of outbreak detection: supervised methods are used when the pattern to recognize has been defined previously, e.g., the detection of seasonal influenza outbreaks. In this situation, data collection must rely on a well-defined set of symptoms. Then, a statistical algorithm is used to qualify when an excess of observed cases indicates an outbreak. Numerous statistical techniques belonging to this class of supervised methods are routinely used in surveillance (e.g., periodic regression models, which are now available on the Web [5] ), as long as the patterns to recognize have been defined a priori. For example, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defined 11 classes of syndromes associated with bioterrorism [6] , and several syndromic surveillance algorithms were devised to optimally assign each new case to one of those classes [2, [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] .",

We examined the ICPCviews corresponding, as above, to: the week just before the outbreak (week 3/2006), the week at the outbreak peak (week 6/2006), the week after the outbreak (week 14/ 2006), and the rest of the year taken as a control period.

This pattern combines general symptoms (fever) and digestive symptoms (abdominal pain and vomiting), Figure 1 A. Graphic reference frame of ICPCview. Each green cell corresponds to an ICPC-2 code.

The limb-like structures group the ICPC-2 codes respectively corresponding to localized pathologies of the musculoskeletal system. See Additional file 1. B.

However, some pathologies inside these sets are neither inflammatory-infectious nor tumors (for example \"other respiratory trauma\"). The ordinal criterion of arrangement of codes may be fuzzy: for example asthma, which is far from the medial line, has various manifestations, some severe or others not.

Indeed, our primary goal is to help recognize, as early as possible, totally unexpected epidemiological patterns.

Pertinently, in this case, a regression method with a threshold would have performed better only under the very restrictive condition that this code would have been identified in advance.

Similarly, for the HED, the choice of weekly resolution was only illustrative and was imposed by the numbers of data available per day, keeping in mind that several hundred cases are needed to create an informative image. In a real-world application, the choice of the temporal resolution would depend on the nature of the class of events to be identified: hourly resolution or, at worst, daily resolution would be desirable to recognize a terrorist attack-associated disease.

At the time of the event, the only public health warnings came from newspapers and funeral parlors, not from the health information systems, which were therefore far from the ideal real-time systems we described above.

Flu-like symptoms are observed at the onset of many diseases, during bioterrorist attacks (e.g., smallpox, plague, anthrax), and for emerging diseases (e.g., severe acute respiratory syndrome, Chikungunya, flu pandemic,...). Numerous supervised techniques proved successful at recognizing seasonal influenza outbreaks, and the goal of our technique is not to compete with those methods in this situation. Now, imagine an outbreak of influenza-like syndromes occurring in August, or the onset of a new disease heralded by symptoms, like epistaxis or purpura; the supervised methods would be, by definition, unsuited to detect them, while an unsupervised technique, like the one we proposed here, could work. Finally, the method is designed to have the highest sensitivity possible, in order to detect rare, unusual and unexpected signals. To achieve good positive-predictive value would require, in addition, a \"back room\", where human experts would validate the signals based on appropriate field epidemiological investigations. One caveat of the method is that it relies, by definition, on human observers. Hence, its effectiveness will depend upon the quality of these observers and their training. The system's quality and that of the epidemiology watcher could be measured with a research protocol based on simulated datasets. This approach has been successfully used in epidemiological surveillance to test new algorithms [28] . Simulated data sets could be generated by adding a given number of codes of interest (e.g., those compatible with an anthrax attack) to an existing database (e.g., the present HED database). Epidemiology watchers would then be shown the successive monitors displaying the evolution of the images within the graphic reference frame, and asked to indicate whether and when they could identify an outbreak. Such a design would allow easy computation the sensitivity and specificity of the system (as a function of the number of simulated codes added to the database). Standard statistical techniques would also allow assessment of intra-and interobserver variabilities.",
