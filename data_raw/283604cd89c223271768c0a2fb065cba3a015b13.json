It was eventually proved to be caused by parvovirus after pathogen isolation and identification. As the genomic sequence analysis showed, this pathogen shared 90.8-94.6% of nucleotide identity with goose parvovirus (GPV), and it was called duck-origin novel goose parvovirus (N-GPV). In this study, a quantitative loop-mediated isothermal amplification (qLAMP) assay was developed for the rapid diagnosis of N-GPV. A set of four specific primers, two inner and two outer, were designed targeting at VP3 gene, which could be completed within 60 min at 65 \u2022 C in water bath or on a real-time PCR instrument for quantitative analysis. Specificity test of LAMP assay showed that there was no cross-reactivity between N-GPV and other duck pathogens, and the detection limit of qLAMP assay was 1.0 \u00d7 10 2 copies/\u00b5L. The repeatability of this method was confirmed by interassay and intra-assay tests with variability ranging from 0.74 to 2.25%. The results have indicated that the qLAMP assay was a simple, rapid, accurate, sensitive, and specific method for detecting N-GPV, especially on field detection.",

These diseases can lead to enteric symptoms, watery diarrhea, prostration, and growth retardation, thus resulting in serious economic losses to waterfowl industry (Gl\u00e1vits et al., 2005) . In 2015, a disease, which emerged in France and Poland in the early 1970s in mule and Muscovy ducks was first reported in Chinese mainland (Chen et al., 2015) . It mainly caused short beak, protruding tongues, fragile tibia and pteroid, and growth retardation to commercial ducks. The morbidity rate ranges from 10 to 30%, and even up to 50%, thereby resulting in enormous economic losses to duck industry of China. In order to identify the exact pathogen that caused this disease, pathogen isolation and identification and genomic sequence analysis were carried out. Isolated pathogen was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay, and the result showed that only GPV was positive; Genomic sequence analysis showed that this new pathogen shared 90.8-94.6% of nucleotide identity with goose parvovirus (GPV). These two studies above indicated that this new pathogen shared higher homology with other GPV strains. Therefore, it was called duck-origin novel goose parvovirus (N-GPV) . In common with other waterfowl parvovirus, N-GPV was also a member of the Parvoviridae family with a single-stranded DNA genome, and has a small, nonenveloped, icosahedral capsid packaging a singlestranded DNA genome of approximately 5,100 nucleotides.",

In addition, LAMP has been considered as a time-saving, lowcost, highly specific and sensitive method (Chotiwan et al., 2017) , which can be completed within 60 min under condition of constant temperature, and it has been established to detect GPV, Muscovy duck parvovirus (MDPV), porcine parvovirus (PPV), canine parvovirus (CPV), and others targeting at VP gene (Cho et al., 2006; Chen et al., 2009; Ji et al., 2010; JinLong et al., 2010) .

Amplification curves and good linear relationship have been obtained. Specificity of this method was determined by GPV and other duckorigin viruses, such as duck plague virus, duck tembusu virus, duck hepatitis virus, duck reovirus, Muscovy duck parvovirus, and H9N2-AIV. In addition, sensitivity of qLAMP was carried out with plasmid substances after tenfold series dilutions. These test results above demonstrated that this method has advantages with strong specificity, high sensitivity, easy operated, and low cost so that is valuable and suitable for clinical application in basic level production.",

However, not only does it require expensive equipments and much time, but also it has a high requirement for experiment conditions.

Although traditional SYBR Green I-based LAMP assay is a good method with high sensitivity and specificity, adding fluorescence dye after reaction would cause aerosol pollution, thus resulting in a false positive. However, SYBR Green I would inhibit PCR amplification if added before LAMP reaction (Eischeid, 2011) . So, the novel EvaGreen-based quantitative LAMP assay has overcome these disadvantages and is more suitable for further application. This method could also be carried out in a water bath or on a real-time PCR instrument for quantitative analysis, and results can be easily observed by turbidity, fluorescence in the UV by naked eyes and agarose gel electrophoresis.",

            "text": "Novel goose parvovirus is newly discovered in recent years, which mainly causes ducks growth retardation and high infection rate to meat ducks, while GPV mainly causes serious death to goslings. According to the view of homology, the N-GPV strain is closer to European GPV and vaccine isolates, while separated from Asian isolates. Therefore, it is clear that N-GPV is a member of GPV-related parvovirus. N-GPV and GPV are almost indistinguishable using this method due to higher nucleotide homology, but it's also a great method for the detection of N-GPV, because these two pathogens are from different poultry.",
