However, epidemiological surveys of MERS in Korea indicated that some secondary patients were infected without close contact. Therefore, the possibility of other transmission routes must be identified. In this study, the possibility of MERS spreading through airflow was investigated on the eighth floor of Pyeongtaek St Mary's Hospital. Computational fluid dynamics was used to analyse the indoor airflow and passive tracer diffusion during the index patient's stay. Six cases were simulated for different outdoor wind directions and indoor mechanical ventilation operations. When a passive tracer was released in ward 8104, where the index patient was hospitalized, the passive tracer spread through the indoor airflow, which was created by the outdoor airflow. Ward 8109, which had the largest number of infected cases and was far distant from ward 8104, showed passive tracer concentration in all cases. This result indicates that MERS may have spread through airflow. The study results do not imply that the infection pathway of MERS is airborne. However, the results show the possibility of MERS spreading through airflow in specific environments such as poor ventilation environments.",

The reported cases of MERS infection increased in the Middle East in May 2014, and since then, there has been a growing concern about MERS infection [3] . In May 2015, the first case of MERS infection was reported in Korea; the patient had contracted the disease while visiting the Arabian Peninsula and had returned to Korea, thereby spreading MERS in Korea [4] . According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the region with the highest number of infected cases outside the Arabian Peninsula is Korea [5] . MERS spread in Korea from May 2015 to July 2015; in less than two months, 186 people were infected and 38 people died. The Korea CDC reported that MERS rapidly spread over a short period because of hospital infection. According to epidemiological findings, 87.6% of the infected patients were infected in the hospital [6] . Similarly, in the MERS cases reported in Jeddah in 2014, infection was found to spread in the hospital through super-spreading events [7] . The MERS events in Korea and Jeddah indicate that MERS infection can gradually increase when a dense population is confined to relatively small spaces such as hospitals.",

In addition to the index patient, 30 people (15 inpatients, 13 family members and 2 nurses) were infected on the eighth floor of the hospital [9] . To confirm the cause of the infection of secondary patients at the hospital, an epidemiological investigation of the infection transmission route was conducted. The investigation results showed that 23% of the infected patients did not come in close contact with other infected patients [10] . Similar to SARS, MERS is known to be an infection caused by close contact [11] . However, the infection of a secondary patient with no close contact with the index patient does not support the claim that MERS is spread only through close contact. Therefore, the possibility of other infection transmission routes of MERS, such as air transmission, is being studied [12, 13] . In the case of SARS, the airflow in the Prince of Wales Hospital was analysed, where the first SARS-infected patient was hospitalized. The results showed that the pattern of the infection of the secondary patient was similar to the indoor airflow pattern [14] . When SARS was reported in Toronto, Canada, a field experiment was performed to determine the infection transmission route, and the results indicated that SARS could possibly be an opportunistic airborne infection [15] . A new risk calculation method was applied to confirm the spatial risk distribution of SARS, and the results showed that SARS was more likely to be transmitted through the air [16] .",

However, the index patient was admitted to a ward with no supply and exhaust vent. The ward was originally a seven-person ward and was separated into two two-person wards. In the process of separating the wards, vents were installed in only one of the wards. Because of this construction lapse, the index patient's ward was not mechanically ventilated, and only natural ventilation was provided through the window. It is possible that the droplets produced by coughing and sneezing by the index patient accumulated in the ward at a high concentration due to lack of ventilation. MERS bacteria are known to survive for up to 72 h on plastic or steel surfaces at a room temperature of 208C and a humidity of 40% [18] , and droplets are known to shrink their size during the evaporation process [19, 20] . A person who infects more than five people is called a super-spreader, and the index patient was also surveyed as a superspreader [21] . The results of previous studies indicate that the droplets from the index patient, who was a super-spreader, can partially evaporate and become small particles such as droplet nuclei and then spread to the adjacent wards through airflow [14, 22, 23] .",

The ventilation of the ward is controlled by a sensible heat exchanger installed in groups of two to six wards; air handling unit was not installed. Awning windows are present in each ward and can be opened or closed by the patient. In the corridor, ventilation is not provided and only a ceiling-type air conditioner is installed. The air conditioner and ventilation system of each ward can be controlled individually, so the occupant can freely manipulate them. According to interviews with patients who were present during the index patient's hospitalization, they used the air conditioner according to their needs; however, most of them did not recognize the ventilation devices, making it difficult to determine whether the air conditioner and ventilation system were in operation. In the case of ward 8104, the index patient stated that the air conditioner was not in use except for approximately half a day and that the window was kept open for ventilation.",

The size of the domain used in the analysis was modelled to be 420 \u00c2 525 \u00c2 180 m (figure 4). There was sufficient space between the building and analysis domain to allow the airflow to fully develop and hence obtain reliable analysis results [27] . The analytical mesh was a trimmer mesh, and the prism layer mesh was applied to the wall. Mesh independence test was performed and compared with coarse (3 million), medium (6 million) and fine mesh size (9 million) for prediction accuracy of the CFD simulation results [28] . Outdoor velocity data were extracted at the front of the hospital (figure 4a) at constant height of 1 m and indoor velocity data were extracted from window height (figure 4b). Realizable k-1 turbulence model [29, 30] was used as the turbulence model. As a boundary condition, the airflow was set in the windward direction according to the wind speed profile and it was set to escape to the leeward direction due to pressure formation [31] . The side and top parts of the domain were set to be symmetrical. Figure 5 shows the wind speed and direction when the index patient was hospitalized, i.e. from noon on 15 May 2015 to the morning of 17 May 2015. Wind data at the height of 10 m were obtained from the nearest weather observatory located 3.6 km away from the hospital. The CFD cases were selected according to the dominant wind directions, i.e. west, west-southwest winds. Wind blowing from outside the building is affected by the terrain of the surface and blockage of the building; the wind speed is lower at low height, and the wind speed increases with the distance from the surface. To employ these conditions in the CFD analysis, the wind speed at the height of 0-180 m was calculated using the exponential law [32] based on the average wind speed at the height of 10 m blowing from each direction. To determine the roughness of the earth's surface, the roughness value a should be selected. This value was chosen to be 0.22 (for regions where houses with a height of 3.5 m are concentrated or regions where middle-class buildings are scattered) according to the Korea Building Code [33] .",

According to the interviews with patients and medical staffs, most of the windows were open for ventilation in the daytime during the outbreak because outdoor temperature was moderate. Therefore, awning windows were opened at the angle of 308. As shown in figure 6 , the air supply and exhaust vents of each room were modelled by reflecting the shapes of the actual air supply and exhaust vents installed in the hospital. The bathroom was not modelled, and only the door undercut (exhaust) was modelled for analysis efficiency. The design airflow rate was used for the supply and exhaust air vents and bathroom exhaust. The passive tracer was released from the mouth of a lying patient model. The model was set to exhale 5 l of passive tracer per minute, which is considered to be the average respiration rate of a person.

In addition, due to the characteristics of the hospital building, where family members visit wards from time to time, medical staff frequently shift duties and the heat generation value of rooms change with time, specifying accurate heat generation value was impossible.

However, maximum difference of indoor velocity of the three meshes showed a difference. Coarse mesh and fine showed a maximum velocity difference of 0.1 m s 21 and medium mesh and fine mesh showed 0.06 m s 21 difference. Therefore, medium mesh with 6 million cell was considered independent and was selected for the simulation. Figure 8 shows the pressure distribution at the height of the patient's mouth on the eighth floor. In the case of the wind blowing from the west, when the wind direction was more perpendicular to the surface of the building, a positive pressure (greater than 3 Pa) was formed that was higher than that formed when the wind direction was less perpendicular to the building surface. Positive pressure was also formed on the west-southwest outer surface of the building, and a relatively high positive pressure (greater than 4 Pa) was observed in the angular part of the centre of the west side of the building. When the wind was blowing from the west-southwest direction, high positive pressure (greater than 3 Pa) was created on the west-southwest outer surface of the building, and the highest positive pressure (greater than 4 Pa) was formed in the west angular part of the building, which is similar to the case in which the wind was blowing from the west. In all the cases, in the side part of the building, a negative pressure was formed and a vortex was generated making the airflow separate and reattach to the side of the building. In the case of the west wind, air mainly flowed through front (a) window to rear (a) windows. In the case of the west-southwest wind, compared to the west wind, the airflow through the front (a) window decreased and the airflow through the front (b) window increased. The air mainly flowed in through front (b) and flowed out through the side windows and rear (a) windows. Figure 9 shows the results of the indoor passive tracer distribution. The analysis results for the west wind airflow indicated that the outdoor air mainly flowed in through the west-facing windows and flowed out through the rear windows. The passive tracer from the lying patient's mouth in ward 8104 mainly spread to wards 8111 and 8112. In the case of the west-southwest wind, compared to the west wind, the air mainly flowed in through west-southwest windows and flowed out through the side and rear windows. The passive tracer spread to ward 8109, 8110 and some portion spread to adjacent ward 8105. Figure 10 shows the volume-averaged concentration of the passive tracer in residential area which is 0-1.8 m in each room. In all the cases, no contaminants were detected in the maternity ward department, where no MERS infection cases were reported. Among all the wards, index patient ward (8104) had the highest concentration of the passive tracer in all the cases. It is difficult to directly relate the reported infected cases with the concentration of the passive tracer in wards because the wind does not continuously blow in one direction. However, in case WSW-1, which represents the actual situation when the index patient was hospitalized and the wind was blowing from the west-southwest, ward 8109, where the highest infected cases were reported, showed the highest concentration. In the case of ward 8107, where four infected cases were reported, the highest passive tracer concentration was only 0.02% compared to ward 8014 (100%). However, in a situation where the west or west-southwest wind was blowing and the east wind was blown after the passive tracer was spread, the passive tracer could re-spread to the west-facing wards. The concentration in each ward is shown in table 2, and the highest concentration in ward 8104 (case W-2) is considered to be 100%. In case W-1, where the wind was blowing from the west, relatively high concentration was observed in ward 8111 (10.7%) and 8112 (11.4%); both wards had three infected cases. Comparing with case W-1T, which is non-isothermal simulation, concentration difference of ward 8014 was not significant. However, wards 8111 and 8112 showed 3.64 and 2.47% lower concentration. This is due to buoyancy effect which forms upper air movement; the concentration is extracted at the occupied zone (0-1.8 m). In case WSW-1, the highest concentration was observed in ward 8109; 3.69% where most of infected cases were reported. In cases W-2 and WSW-2, where all ventilation system was not in operation, higher passive tracer concentration was observed in every contaminant-detected ward compared with other cases. In cases W-3 and WSW-3, which represented the full operation of mechanical ventilation conditions, the concentrations in ward 8104 were 4.90%, 45.4% lower than those of cases W-1 and WSW-1, respectively. In case W-3, the reduction rate of the concentration in ward 8104 was relatively low compared to case WSW-3. This is because the direct airflow from the west-facing window to the corridor was disturbed by the air supplied from the supply vent, which was located near the window and the patient. It is known that the supply of fresh air dilutes pollutants, but in the case of typical conditions, where the window is near the source, mechanical ventilation can counterbalance the reduction in pollutants.",

In case W, air mostly flowed through the under part of the awning window and less air volume of air was passing through the window due to window shape and disturbed air flow from the supply vent.",

            "text": "The In this study, cases were simulated with steady state which cannot implement change of wind direction and speed time to time. However, one transient simulation was conducted with case W-1 to observe passive tracer spreading time. To employ realistic emission characteristics, passive tracer was royalsocietypublishing.org/journal/rsos R. Soc. open sci. 6: 181164 set to exhale for 0.5 s with amount of 1.2 l from patient's mouth, which is considered to be one coughing time and air mass [39 -41] . The passive tracer was first observed in nurse station with time of 100 s and had peak concentration at 330 s. In ward 8111 which had the highest concentration in steady simulation, passive tracer was observed in 230 s and the peak concentration was at 580 s. In ward 8110 which is the most distant ward from 8104, passive tracer was observed at 520 s and has peak concentration at 880 s. The transient simulation result tells us that in a situation when all the windows and doors are opened, the passive tracer can reach 30 m distant ward in 520 s just with one coughing scenario. SARS is known to spread by close contact; however, Li et al. [14] suggested that it could possibly be an airborne infection. Li et al. confirmed the diffusion of contaminants through mechanical ventilation systems in the ward using CFD. In Li et al.'s study, the contaminant concentration was higher than that in the present study. This is attributed to the different indoor environment parameters such as air recirculation in the mechanical ventilation systems and the simulation domain size. The passive tracer concentration shown in this study might be low. However, this does not mean that the risk of infection is also low.",

However, virus can be attached to various particle sizes and tracking of all size of particles using CFD needs extremely time-consuming process. Small size particles are more likely to travel with airflow. In the case of previous studies on SARS [14, 23] , indoor and outdoor airflow was analysed using passive contaminant to identify the dispersion of SARS virus based on the assumption that the droplets exhaled from the infected patient are evaporated very quickly and get small enough to flow like airflow. In this study, we adopted the concept of using passive contaminant for computing efficiency.",

            "text": "purpose of this study was to investigate the possibility of distant propagation of droplets through airflow using CFD analysis on the eighth floor of Pyeongtaek St Mary's Hospital, where the index patient was admitted. The wind speed profile was obtained and analysed based on the average wind speed values of the west, west-southwest and east winds, which were the dominant wind directions during the period in which the index patient was hospitalized. On the first day of hospitalization of the index patient (15 May 2015), the wind was mainly blowing from the west-southwest as shown in figure 11a, except from 22.00 to 22.30. In the first day, the wind was relatively weak, with a maximum wind speed of 3.4 m s 21 and an average wind speed of 1.7 m s 21 . As shown in figure 11b, on 16 May, east winds were blowing from 5.00 to 7.30, and there was a possibility that the passive tracer that spread because of the west-southwest wind might re-spread to the west-facing wards because of the east wind. As shown in figure 11a 0 , winds were continually blowing from the west southwest and west until 20.00; maximum wind speed was 5.5 m s 21 , and the average wind speed was 2.2 m s 21 . As shown in figure 11b 0 , on the following day (16 May), the west and east winds randomly blew from 21.00 to 3.00. East wind blew with an average wind speed of 1.2 m s 21 and a maximum wind speed of 2.1 m s 21 . The passive tracer that spread because of the west-southwest wind on the previous day could have re-spread to the other wards before the patient was discharged.The passive tracer concentration in each room was analysed in terms of the door-to-door distance between wards. The passive tracer was detected in wards 8109 and 8112, which were 17.8 m apart from ward 8104, and in ward 8110, which was approximately 30 m away from ward 8104. The passive tracer concentration in ward 8109 showed the highest concentration when the west-southwest wind was blowing, indicating that MERS would have infected other patients through the airflow.",
