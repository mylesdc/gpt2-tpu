            "text": "Leather tanning has been used for centuries, even millennia, by immersing skins in water where special barks or woods containing tannin have been added. Up to a full year was necessary for leather to be produced in such a manner. However, the current tannin extraction industry is relatively newer. The more modern history of tannins began in the 17th century when Giovannetti, an Italian chemist, studied the interactions between iron solutions and substances called \"astringents\". In 1772, various researchers identified the presence of an acid in these compounds. This acid was then isolated by Scheele and turned out to be gallic acid. Based on the experiments of Deyeux and Bartholdi, continued by Proust in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, tannins have been officially recognized as a discrete group of different molecules based on gallic acid content. The great growth of the tannin extraction industry began in the years around 1850 in Lyon, where tannin was used as iron tannate for the black coloring of silk for women's blouses [1] . After 10 years, fashion changed and thus after many bankruptcies and groupings of factories, tannin manufacturers were able to convince the leather industry to use tannin in place of oak chips with considerable savings in tanning time (from 12 months with the old system based on wood chips rich in tannin to 28 days using tannin extract) [1] . The benefits of tannin extracts in the manufacture of leather, and even the time savings still allowed by their use, were such that the industry expanded rapidly and thrived. Tannin being in short supply in Europe, factories were opened in distant countries to satisfy the growing demand and promoting the use of alternative tannin types. Early in the 20th century, South American and southern and central African tannins began to be industrially extracted to supply major markets in Europe and North America. Among these, the main ones were quebracho wood and mimosa bark tannins. Leather processing was thus the second major boom period for the tannin industry. After World War II the substitution of leather with synthetic materials for shoes again caused a number of tannin extraction plants to close [2] . The third period of use of tannin therefore began, first with their development as bio-based adhesives and later with an increasing number of applications in new bio-based materials, this latter period being still in full development.",

Their general appearance varies, ranging from white amorphous powders to off-white amorphous powders, to glossy, almost colorless pasty substances, to reddish-brown powders when produced by spray drying. They have an astringent taste. Tannins are natural products found in most higher plants. They are produced in almost all parts of the plant, namely seeds, roots, bark, wood, and leaves, because of their fundamental role in the defense of the plant against insects, food infections, fungi, or bacteria. The defense mechanism is based on the ability of tannins to complex proteins irreversibly. They are also considered as one of the effective components contributing to the fact that the risk of suffering from cardiovascular diseases and some forms of cancer can be reduced by choosing diets rich in fruits and vegetables. In addition to their documented effects on human health, tannins are also important for the welfare of ruminants; high protein feeds such as alfalfa trigger the production in the rumen of methane trapped as proteinaceous foam, resulting in a potentially mortal fermentation that can be reduced by adding tannin in the diet. Two wide classes of tannins exist: hydrolysable tannins such as gallo-tannins and ellagi-tannins, and condensed polyflavonoid tannins, these latter being stable and rarely subject to hydrolysis [2] .",

The first step is an oxidation of 1,2,3,4,6-pentagalloylglucose to form the monomeric ellagi-tannin. The second step consists essentially of dimerization after a second enzyme-mediated specific oxidation of hexahydroxydiphenoyl group of the ellagi-tannin with the galloyl group of another tannin to form a valoneyl group-containing dimer and these reactions continue to form higher oligomers. An example of ellagi-tannin is the tannin of chestnut wood ( Figure 2 ). ",

On the contrary, oligomers derived from hydrolysed hemicelluloses are often present in sufficient quantities. Equally, carbohydrate chains of various lengths [4, 5] are also sometime linked to the flavonoid unit in the tannin. The basic structure of these tannins is based on the flavonoid unit ( Figure 3 ).

Leather has traditionally been made in ground pits in which alternating layers of animal skins and wood chips containing tannins, such as oak chips, have been placed and soaked for considerable periods of time. The skins were passed through a number of consecutive pits, generally 28, so as to be slowly enriched and \"tanned\" by the tannin in solution. The tannins exfiltrated the wood chips and slowly impregnated increasingly more of each skin. Such a manufacturing system was practiced for many centuries and produced good quality leather but it took several months, often a whole year, for the leather to be ready. The first change came when the tannin extraction industry, which had grown considerably in the 1850s to supply black iron tannate dyes to color silk, was in a desperate position because of the change in fashion. Some tannin extraction plants were able to demonstrate that by directly adding tannin extract to traditional tanning pits, the same quality of leather could be produced in just 28 days (28 pits, one per day). Leather tanned in this way began to prevail and this use led to a boom which lasted mainly until the end of the Second World War. In particular, the war years were good simply because armies were walking in leather boots.",

Secondly, the demobilization of armies, which sharply reduced the need for leather shoes, and the third, the strong penetration of the market by chromium salt tanning for the manufacture of soft leathers, in particular the upper part of shoes. With all these changes, while vegetable leather has now begun to gain a reputation as a luxury product, there are still some important niches for which it is used such as equestrian equipment, heavy bags and luggage, and other heavy applications as well as the real high price luxury markets. Although the traditional 28 pits tanning method still exists for a number of special leathers as well as in the case of artisanal leather (as in Morocco for example), the tanning processes has also evolved for vegetable tanning where rotary drums, a technique borrowed from chrome tanning, allows vegetable tanning to be finalized in about 24 h. Today, research on vegetable tanned leather has been able to produce much more supple leather through the inclusion of oils and other techniques, so that some rebirth of the use of plant tannins for other application areas appears to take place.",

First of all, the relative scarcity of tannins produced in the world, compared to the tonnage of synthetic adhesives used in the panel industry, has led to a great deal of research on the extension of the tannin resource in order to have larger tonnage. As the potential material for tannin extraction shows that millions of tons of this material can be extracted each year worldwide, some companies have started to build additional extraction plants. This movement is still relatively small, but it is ongoing. The second approach, to extend the tannin with another abundant and natural material, has led to the preparation of adhesives based on in situ copolymers of tannins and lignin [37] or copolymers of tannin and protein or soy flour [38] , and the use of tannin-furfuryl alcohol adhesive formulations, furfuryl alcohol being also a bio-based material [39] .",

This quest has taken two approaches: (1) total elimination of formaldehyde by substituting it with aldehydes, which are less or non-toxic, and non-volatile [28, 40] , such as glyoxal, glutaraldehyde, or vanillin, the latter giving a fully bio-based tannin adhesive, and even aldehydes generated by the action of sodium periodate on glucose, sucrose and even oligomeric carbohydrates, (2) the use of non-aldehyde hardeners such as trishydroxymethylnitromethane [41] and trishydroxymethylaminomethane [42] or even by combination with furfuryl alcohol, the latter functioning both as a hardener and a contributor to a tannin/furan copolymer [39, 43] . (3) The use of hexamine with the formation of -CH 2 -NH-CH 2 -bridges between the tannin molecules, where the secondary amine is capable of absorbing any emission of formaldehyde from the heating of the wood itself or any other emission of formaldehyde to produce truly zero-formaldehyde emission panels [36, [44] [45] [46] . (4) Lastly, the hardening of the tannins by autocondensation without the addition of a hardener, autocondensation catalysed by the wood substrate itself in the case of fast-acting procyanidin tannins, such as pine bark tannins, and for slower tannins by addition of silica or silicate or other accelerators [10, [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] allowing the preparation of wood particleboard of indoor quality.",

Their antiviral effectiveness is also well documented by in vitro screening for a variety of 12 different hydrolysable and condensed tannins [51] . The tannin's minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) needed for reducing by 50% the cytopathogenicity induced by a number of viruses was used as an evaluation of their effectiveness. The lower MIC values yielded the best antiviral behavior. The different tannin's minimum cytotoxic concentration (MCC) needed to detect microscopic alteration of normal cell morphology was also determined. Less toxic is the tannin tested in the patient's cells, thus the higher is its MCC value, the more acceptable it is as an antiviral compound. The ideal antiviral compound is then the one presenting a combination of the lowest MIC and the highest MCC. The effectiveness of different tannins due to their polyphenolic nature can be very high against a number of different viruses. This is due to their irreversible reaction and combination with the viruses capsid proteins. It is the same reaction used in leather tannins and in their association with carbohydrates.",

In short, the level of tannin in any of these products must be within a definite interval/concentration range for the beverage to be organoleptically pleasing. Too low an amount of tannin and the beverage will be insipid and with no taste. Too high the proportion of tannins in the beverage and it is too unpleasant, too \"tanning\" for the consumer's mouth. Many wines, some beers, and several fruit juices however contain too low a concentration of tannin and thus may need to be \"doctored\". Initially, addition of tannin or tannin-rich wood chips directly to wine to enhance its taste and give the impression of a wine of greater age was strictly forbidden in most European countries. With the determined and successful push for wine markets by southern hemisphere producers where limitations on adding oak particles to the wine to accelerate its aging was not forbidden, producers of more established countries tried to defend their market in a different way. Some producers the wines of which were particularly low in tannin content started to add tannin directly to some of their wines. Although addition of additives for aging was legally forbidden the perfectly legal gap existed permitting the use of tannins to precipitate proteic matter in the wine to render it \"clearer\". All what was needed then was to add more tannins than what would be required to render the wine \"clear\". This was kept fairly confidential, to not incur potential problems. The situation changed dramatically once the so-called \"French paradox\" came to be known. Namely, notwithstanding that traditional French diet is very rich in fats that should lead to grave cardiovascular diseases this is not the case, and this type of disease was far less frequent in France. This was ascribed to the regular use of red wine which decreased to extremely low level the risks and the occurrence of cardiovascular diseases. Now not only is tannin added to the wine, but it is considered particularly beneficial to do it. It must be pointed out that it is particularly purified tannin, from which carbohydrates and other components have been eliminated. It is the antioxidant property of the polyphenolic groups of the tannin which gives to it the powerful anticardiovascular effect and positive properties. Both addition of tannin as well as addition of tannin-rich oak wood chips to wine is now completely legal in Europe.",

            "text": "There are a number of different developments in rigid foam insulation. For imitating synthetic polyurethanes, by reaction with isocyanates, two approaches have been tried. First, foams have been developed based on the reaction of a modified tannin either by benzoylation or by oxypropylation to make it more susceptible as polyol to the reaction with polymeric isocyanates [62] [63] [64] [65] . This first approach follows the same approach that was made with another natural polyphenol, namely lignin [66] . This is a traditional approach where tannin only functions as a polyol. The second approach of this type uses a very different strategy based on the reaction of a tannin with an aldehyde and the subsequent reaction of the methylol (-CH 2 OH) groups so formed with the isocyanate. This approach is now used for both tannin wood adhesives [25, 67] and other formaldehyde adhesives such as urea-formaldehyde (UF), melamine-urea-formaldehyde (MUF) and phenol-formaldehyde (PF) [25, 26] . Incidentally it is the only system that allows the formation of urethanes in an aqueous medium.",

            "text": "Thus, according to this second approach, mixed rigid foams of phenolic-polyurethane type have been developed by reacting natural tannin/furanic mixtures with polymeric isocyanate in the proportions suitable for continuous polyurethane foam lines [68] . Urethane linkages formed at both the alcoholic C3 and phenolic hydroxyls. Other species in the mix were involved in urethane linkages formation: (1) glyoxal after or before its reaction with the tannin, (2) the phenolsulfonic acid catalyst, and (3) furfural. Furfural instead preferred to form methylene bridges with the flavonoids A ring than to form urethane linkages by reacting with the isocyanate. Thus, methylene and urethane bridges were formed between all the main materials in the mix. Thus, a number of mixed species bound by both types of linkages were formed. Species formed by mixed co-reaction of two, three, and four different reagents in the mix were identified. Examples of mixed species are shown in Figure 5 : Testing on a continuous production line has yielded positive results. This system was tried in plant trials in Switzerland on a continuous production line for polyurethane foam mats where addition of a small amount of isocyanate was necessary as without it the equipment of the factory could not function [68] .",

            "text": "Chemically self-expanding rigid foam formulations based on tannin extracts have been developed since 1994 [69] . These foams, composed of 95% natural materials, have mechanical and physical properties comparable to synthetic PF foams. Originally, the fluid phase before foaming is composed of a tannin, with formaldehyde as a hardener, both mixed with furfuryl alcohol used as a exothermic reaction agent by its self-polymerization reaction and its reaction with the tannin [69] under acid conditions. Expansion to a foam of the fluid phase is caused by a low-boiling physical blowing agent, while simultaneous cross-linking of the resinous mixture provides dimensional stabilization at the desired low density [69] . These foams have been tested and are totally fire resistant, this being their major interest. Their appearance is shown in Figure 6 . During the last ten years a great deal of research has been carried out to improve these foams, by formulating them without formaldehyde [70, 71] , without aldehydes, without an organic solvent as blowing agent [72] , without furfuryl alcohol, in an alkaline medium [73] and not only acid, with open cells and closed cells, by copolymerizing them with synthetic resins such as phenolic resins [74] and isocyanates [75] , by copolymerizing them with proteins [76] , by introducing variations into their systems of preparation [77, 78] , by improving their resistance to water by grafting on a small proportion of the tannin of long hydrorepellent chains [79] , and also foaming them by heat alone without self-blowing, or even simply foamed by mechanical agitation for use as projected foams [80, 81] . In addition to rigid foams, flexible foams have been developed [82] [83] [84] . Foams with the most reactive tannins of the procyanidin type, such as pine tannin, were also developed [85, 86] and the carbonization line of research of these foams has also been continued and improved [87] . The varieties of these foams are really considerable [88] and the literature on this subject is really quite large, too vast to be summarized in this article.",

Among others, open-cell foams have been used for very good acoustic insulation [89] , carbonized foams for a large number of different applications [87, 90] , and also more recently for bone repair by osteogenesis with stem cells [91] . Taking the latter case as an example, for this application, as the treatment options are limited, bone tissue engineering opens the possibility of growing an unlimited amount of tissue products with increased therapeutic potential for the management of clinical cases characterized by severe bone loss. Bone engineering relies on the use of conformal biomaterial scaffolds, osteocompetent cells, and biologically active agents. Among other things, porous tannin spray dried powder (PTSDP) has been approved for human use. Thus the powder derived by grinding tannin-furanic foams has been used as a low-cost reconstruction material, due to its biocompatibility and potential ability to be replaced by bone in vivo. In this study, macro-PTSDP scaffolds with defined geometry, porosity, and mechanical properties were made by combining casting technology and pore leaching by mixing PTSDP and hydroxyapatite (Ca 10 (PO 4 ) 6 (OH) 2 . This has shown that the scaffolds developed in this work support the attachment, long-term viability, and osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal progenitors derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells. The combination of some macroporous PTSDP scaffolds with patient-specific osteocompetent cells offers therefore new opportunities to develop bone grafts with increased clinical potential for complex skeletal reconstructions.",

This improves the quality of tannins to the same level of traditional anticorrosive primers. Such primers are applied by brushing or other suitable methods.

Ship hulls are traditionally coated with metal-containing anti-fouling paints. These provide protection by releasing a toxic compound. Tannins and copper can be used as antifouling for ship parts in seawater and reduce foulings. In addition, such formulations were able to reduce copper consumption by 40-fold compared to copper-based paints. It is this same type of complexation that has given the ferrous tannate-based inks still used in school in the first half of the 20th century and the use of which had its peak in the middle ages (cf. inks).",

Among those are (1) cooling and lubricating the drilling strings while it is circulating, (2) transporting the cuttings that are created at the bottom of the hole and release them at the surface, (3) controlling the formation pressure while maintaining the wellbore stability, (4) sealing the permeable formations across the wellbore, and (5) assisting the logging operations. In drilling operations, the basic properties of drilling fluids are usually defined by the well program and monitored including rheology, density, fluid loss, solid content, and chemical properties. To avoid any drilling problems such as a blowout, stuck pipe, and other problems, engineers are always searching for a good performance of a drilling fluid system that is fit for the purpose. Dealing with standard temperature and pressure conditions, the properties of drilling fluids are much easier to handle. While in hostile drilling conditions like high temperature environments, the selection of a drilling fluid is more crucial, alongside the lithology that is one of the factors to be considered. The high temperature environment is often said to be at a temperature more than 150 \u2022 C. In geothermal drilling, the down hole temperature can reach up to 250-350 \u2022 C at the depth of 1000 to 2000 m. At this temperature, the selection of a drilling fluid becomes more stringent due to the needs of thermal stability of the drilling fluid system as well as materials used in the system. High temperatures can cause chemical alterations of various drilling fluid components, thus affecting the filtration and viscosity as well as increasing the tendency for gelation. In addition to this, clay activities greatly affect the system, with high tendencies to flocculate and gel.",

The mixture is frequently stirred for 10 min and sodium hydroxide is then added to adjust the pH of the solution to between 3 and 4. Then, the calcium sulfate is removed from the solution by filtration to obtain lignosulfonic acid.

The wattle tannin-urea-formaldehyde copolymer formed in situ, and any free formaldehyde left in the glue line was absorbed by the wattle tannin extract. The wattle extract powder should be added at level of 4 to 5% of the total starch content of the mix (i.e., carrier plus slurry). Successful results can be achieved in the range of 2 to 12% of the total starch content, but 4% is the recommended starting level. The final level is determined by the degree of water hardness and desired bond quality.

Several condensed tannin extracts were used for this purpose, namely: the bark tannins of maritime pine (Pinus pinaster), of mimosa (Acacia mearnsii), and radiata pine (Pinus radiata), and the wood tannins of quebracho (Schinopsis lorentzii and balansae). These were initially reacted with dimethyl carbonate followed by hexamethylenediamine forming urethane bonds [119] . Wood surface finishes based on these poly(hydroxyl)urethanes yielded encouraging performances (Figure 11 ) with high sessile drop contact angles on the treated wood surface (Figure 9 ). Furthermore, to increase considerably the proportion of bio-sourced material in these isocyanate-free polyurethanes, pre-aminated mimosa tannin extract (as a substitute of the synthetic hexamethylene diamine) was reacted with a mimosa tannin extract pre-reacted with dimethyl carbonate [120] (Figure 12 ). This reaction proceeded easily at room temperature. Cured above 100 \u2022 C, the polyurethanes formed yielded a hard film [120] . In addition, not only the polyphenolic fraction of the tannin extract, but also the carbohydrates oligomers in it generated isocyanate-free polyurethane linkages with the aminated tannin [118, 120] , indicating that non-isocyanate polyurethanes can be synthesized just from carbohydrates. The compounds formed were identified by several instrumental analytical techniques. Species as shown in Figure 12 were identified. The reactivity of the carbohydrates present either in the condensed tannins or in the hydrolysable tannin and the isolation of polyurethanes without isocyanates (NIPU) formed with the carbohydrates or carbohydrate-tannin mixtures led to the evolution of simple monosaccharides and disaccharides as a base of NIPU [121] . Thus, predominantly bio-sourced isocyanate-free polyurethanes (NIPUs) were developed from glucose and sucrose by reaction with dimethyl carbonate and hexamethylenediamine [121] . Oligomers obtained were detected by several spectrometry techniques, showing linear and branched structures such as those shown in Figure 13 . Glucose-based NIPUs cured at a noticeably lower temperature and were more easily spread than sucrose-based NIPUs. Wood and steel surface coatings were prepared using these NIPUs. The sessile drop test (contact angle, on wood) and the cutting grid test (on steel) of these NIPUs yielded very encouraging results [121] . Glucose NIPUs gave good results as a surface coating curing at 103 \u2022 C, whereas sucrose NIPUs performed well only at a much higher curing temperature. NIPU resins derived from saccharides have also been used as wood panel adhesives. The glucose-based NIPU gave very encouraging results for this application [121] while the sucrose-based NIPU gave very encouraging result for the preparation of polyurethane foams.",

A much more recent second approach was based on the reaction of a tannin modified either by benzoylation (Figure 14) or by oxypropylation to introduce hydroxygroups on the tannin that are more easily approachable for reaction and more likely to react as a polyol with polymeric isocyanates [63] [64] [65] . This first approach follows the same approach that was made with another natural polyphenol, lignin [66] . This is a traditional approach where the tannin only functions as a polyol. Nevertheless, while tannin-based polyurethanes are indeed obtained by this route, other natural polyols do exist that are much more adapted to the formation of polyurethanes by reaction with isocyanates, and moreover, without needing to add an additional reaction such as oxypropylation or others.",

This new material is synthesized by the reaction of tannin and furfuryl alcohol, two inexpensive vegetable chemicals. The co-polymerization processes of both were investigated by 13 C NMR and matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. The tannin/furan thermosetting resin with 100% renewable organic material has a glass transition temperature of up to 211 \u2022 C and a 95% weight loss temperature of 244 \u2022 C and 240 \u2022 C in a nitrogen atmosphere and in the air, respectively [122] . The yield of carbonization achieved is 52%. In addition, this new thermoset material has excellent mechanical properties: the Brinell hardness is superior to commercial acrylic plastics, polyvinyl chloride, and slightly lower than solid polystyrene. Compression strength was found to be as high as 194.4 MPa, thus higher than that of filled phenolic resins, and much higher than that of solid polystyrene and acetal resins [122] .",

The mechanical strength of these grinder disks was comparable to their commercial equivalents using synthetic phenol-formaldehyde resins.

Steel bar cutting times with these green experimental disks compared well to those of commercial synthetic resin-bonded disks. Automotive brake pads bonded with a bio-sourced thermoset tannin-furanic matrix were developed and tested [124] using similar matrix resins. Their preparation is also quite easy. The braking and characteristics of such green brake pads tested under real-world large scale test conditions were excellent as well as their wear resistance [124, 125] . Their performance compared well with that of synthetic phenolic resin-bonded commercial automotive brake pads.

These composites were tested for different characteristics, such as surface hardness, water contact angles, influence of fiber morphology, and others, always yielding good results. The matrices based on mixed tannin and lignin gave composites with a thermoplastic behavior after just the first hotpressing. They were thus thermoformable as they could be shaped in their final form by a second hotpressing. The hardening cycle, press temperature, press time, pressure, moisture content, and the number of fiber mats influenced the composite characteristics. Furthermore, first drying the resin-impregnated fiber mats for storing them and then rehydrating them before hotpressing allowed the mats to be maintained ready for use even after long storage times. This approach still yielded composites of 50% matrix resin/50% natural fibers presenting good tensile strength, water swelling, and Young's modulus. The best results were achieved at a slow curing low temperature (130 \u2022 C, 35 min) at a 20% moisture content.",

The particularity of this ink lies in its absence of pigment or dye; it is the action of metal salts (iron or copper sulfate) which, added to the tannic material (the gall nut), gives the black hue, most often dark violet before aging. Its defect is its corrosivity, for the paper as well as for the metal quill.

The base ink (tannin) is then redissolved and a reagent is prepared, with iron sulfate dissolved in warm water, to which gum arabic is added. The tannin solution is boiled separately and gum arabic is also added. The mixture is allowed to cool and the two solutions are mixed. The ink so prepared is then ready for writing.
