Host inosine-5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) involved in the synthesis of guanine nucleotides, is known to be a potential target to inhibit the replication of viruses. Herein, we evaluated antiviral activity of a benzo-heterocyclic amine derivative N30, which was designed to inhibit IMPDH. Results: The results demonstrated that N30 inhibited the replication of H1N1, H3N2, influenza B viruses, including oseltamivir and amantadine resistant strains in vitro. Mechanistically, neuraminidase inhibition assay and hemagglutination inhibition assay suggested that N30 did not directly target the two envelope glycoproteins required for viral adsorption or release. Instead, the compound could depress the activity of IMPDH type II. Based on these findings, we further confirmed that N30 provided a strong inhibition on the replication of respiratory syncytial virus, coronavirus, enterovirus 71 and a diverse strains of coxsackie B virus. Conclusions: We identified the small molecule N30, as an inhibitor of IMPDH, might be a potential candidate to inhibit the replication of various viruses.",

However, influenza vaccines must be reformulated each year due to the constant antigenic evolution of influenza. Additionally, NA inhibitors and M2 ion-channel inhibitors have limited efficacies as drug resistance occurrence [7, 8] , and they only worked at the early phase of virus infection.

Recent studies were pioneered in host purine metabolic pathway, a conserved process responsible for providing host cells with a ready supply of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) for critical cellular processes [9] . Host cells could produce GTP either in de novo pathway or salvage pathway. While in the de novo synthesis of GTP, IMPDH catalyzes the oxidation of inosine monophosphate (IMP) to xanthosine monophosphate (XMP) which is the rate-limiting step. Growing evidences support that inhibition of IMPDH decreases intracellular levels of guanosine nucleotides in DNA or RNA synthesis, thereby indirectly inhibits virus replication which requires host guanine nucleotides as raw materials [10, 11] . As IMPDH inhibitors targeted on host cells, it would be less susceptible for selection of drugresistant strains.",

In addition, we examined the inhibitory rate of the compound against two IAV envelope glycoproteins, hemagglutinin and neuraminidase, and investigated its effect on expression and the enzyme activity of IMPDH type II.

Accumulating evidence showed that depression of IMPDH inhibits replication of diverse species of viruses. N30 was synthesized targeting on IMPDH, so we further studied the effect of N30 on the enzyme. The results showed that IMPDH expressions have not been lessened after N30 treatment, even RBV had no inhibition either. On the other hand, the enzymatic reaction rate of IMPDH could be reduced by 38.18% after N30 treatment. Hence, the anti-influenza activity of N30 might be related to the inhibition the IMPDH-driven enzymatic reaction (Fig. 3) .",

Influenza viruses display considerable antigenic diversity, and new strains arising from antigenic mutation always cause pandemics over the world. Therefore, a key challenge is searching for novel drug targets with broad antiviral spectrum and difficult to generate viral resistance. As we know, viruses always use a host protein or signaling pathway to complete its replication, therefore host factors are attractive therapeutic targets to treat virus infections. The experiments were performed in triplicate, and the data represents mean \u00b1 SD. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001 versus Con IMPDH controls the conversion of IMP to XMP, which is the rate-limiting step in de novo synthesis of guanine nucleotides [25] . Since guanine, as the raw material in replication of virus, needs to be synthesized by host cells, inhibition of IMPDH could restrain virus replication eventually. Even if an organism or tissue can produce guanine nucleotides in salvage pathways through several phosphoribosyl transferases [26] , the amount of guanine nucleotides can not meet the need for rapidly growing cells or viruses. So, the replication of influenza virus could be inhibited through downregulating guanine nucleotides synthesis by inhibiting the activity of IMPDH. IMPDH activity is determined by two highly conserved isoforms type I and type II in human and mammalian cells [27] , which show different biological functions [28] . The comparation of N30 on the two subtypes of IMPDH is worth doing in the future.",
