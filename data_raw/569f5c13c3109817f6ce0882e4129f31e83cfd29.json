            "text": "A genogroup 2b (G2b) porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) Taiwan Pintung 52 (PEDVPT) strain was isolated in 2014. The pathogenicity and host antibody responses elicited by low-passage (passage 5; PEDVPT-P5) and high-passage (passage 96; PEDVPT-P96) PEDVPT strains were compared in post-weaning PEDV-seronegative pigs by oral inoculation. PEDVPT-P5-inoculation induced typical diarrhea during 1-9 days post inoculation with fecal viral shedding persisting for 26 days. Compared to PEDVPT-P5, PEDVPT-P96 inoculation induced none-to-mild diarrhea and lower, delayed fecal viral shedding. Although PEDVPT-P96 elicited slightly lower neutralizing antibodies and PEDV-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin A (IgA) titers, a reduction in pathogenicity and viral shedding of the subsequent challenge with PEDVPT-P5 were noted in both PEDVPT-P5-and PEDVPT-P96-inoculated pigs. Alignment and comparison of full-length sequences of PEDVPT-P5 and PEDVPT-P96 revealed 23 nucleotide changes and resultant 19 amino acid substitutions in non-structure proteins 2, 3, 4, 9, 14, 15 , spike, open reading frame 3 (ORF3), and membrane proteins with no detectable deletion or insertion. The present study confirmed the pathogenicity of the PEDVPT isolate in conventional post-weaning pigs. Moreover, data regarding viral attenuation and potency of induced antibodies against PEDVPT-P5 identified PEDVPT-P96 as a potential live-attenuated vaccine candidate.",

            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) is caused by the PED virus (PEDV), which belongs to the Alphacoronavirus genus of the family Coronaviridae. PEDV contains a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome of approximately 28 kb in size, which encodes four structural proteins, namely, spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins as well as three non-structural proteins (NSP), namely, replicases 1a and 1b and open reading frame 3 (ORF3). The first outbreak of PED was recognized in England in 1971. During the 1980s and 1990s, PED caused severe economic losses in the swine industry in Europe and Asia, but it later turned into a sporadic disease [1] . However, since late 2010, devastating outbreaks of PED that affect all pigs, regardless of their age, with a mortality rate of up to 95% among suckling pigs, regardless of their vaccination status, have been reported in China [2] . The disease has rapidly spread to Asia and, subsequently, to North America, and has resulted in the death of millions of pigs, and has severely affected the swine industry [3, 4] . Compared to traditional and CV777-based vaccine strains, the high genetic diversity of the genogroup 2b (G2b) PEDV suggests that PEDV CV777-or DR13-based attenuated vaccines may not completely protect pigs against the infection or control the disease progression [2, 5] . Therefore, a new generation of PEDV vaccine against G2b PEDV is urgently required. In the past, successful attenuation of traditional PEDV strains such as SM98 [6] , 83P-5 [3] , KPED-9 [7] , and DR13 [8] by in vitro serial passages in Vero cells has been achieved [9] . It has been demonstrated that conventional 11-day-old pigs orally inoculated with 2.55 \u00d7 10 5 fluorescent focus forming units of the highly-passaged cell culture strain CV777 presents transient or no fecal viral shedding without clinical symptoms [10] . In addition, sows intramuscularly immunized with 10 7 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID 50 )/mL of the highly cell culture-adapted CV777 strain twice every two weeks induces serum and colostrum antibody titers and reduces the mortality rate from 100 to 20% in neonatal piglets born to these vaccinated sows challenged with 10 50% lethal dose (LD 50 ) of wild PEDV compared with those born to unvaccinated sows [7] . By using the cell culture passage strategy, evident attenuations of a high-passage PEDV YN Chinese strain (passage 144; YN-144) in 10-day-old conventional pigs [11] or highly-passaged PC21A-derived strains (passage 120 and passage 160) in 4-day-old, caesarian-derived, colostrum-deprived (CD/CD) or conventional suckling piglets [12] have been established. However, the detailed immune responses or the efficacy of cross-protection induced by these attenuated G2b PEDV strains against the parental virus or heterologous viruses are either unknown or only partially effective [12] .",

Viral infection and propagation were confirmed by daily observation of cytopathic effects (CPE), real-time reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), immunofluorescence assay (IFA), and immunocytochemistry (ICC) staining. In brief, Vero C1008 cells (American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) No. CRL-1586) were cultured overnight (O/N) to 80% confluence and were washed twice with modified post-inoculation medium (PI medium) containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA) supplemented with tryptose phosphate broth (0.3%), yeast extract (0.02%), and 10 \u00b5g/mL of trypsin. After two blind passages, PEDV-inoculated Vero cells showing CPE, characterized by cell fusion, syncytial cell formation, and cell detachment, were subjected to three rounds of plaque purification. PEDV-infected Vero cells showing more than 90% CPE were subjected to one freeze-and-thaw cycle, and the supernatants were harvested. Viral stocks of the low-passage PEDV (passage 5; PEDVPT-P5) strain and the high-passage PEDV (passage 96; PEDVPT-P96) strain were prepared by serial passaging of the culture supernatants in Vero cells.

By serial passaging of PEDVPT in Vero cells, a PEDVPT-P96 viral stock was also prepared. Compared to PEDVPT-P5-inoculated pigs, PEDVPT-P96-inoculated pigs showed a delayed, mild, and transient diarrhea, or in some cases undetectable, providing evidence of viral attenuation. Of importance, inoculation of both PEDVPT-P5 and PEDVPT-P96 induced PEDV-specific plasma IgG, mucosal IgA, and neutralizing antibodies and elicited protection against a subsequent challenge with the low passage PEDVPT-P5 strain. This study provides valuable information regarding the viral shedding period, immunogenicity, and pathogenicity of different passaged PEDV in conventional post-weaning pigs.

These live-attenuated vaccines are derived from cell culture-adapted PEDV strains and have proven to be effective in controlling PED by reducing the severity and duration of diarrhea, shortening the period of viral shedding, stimulating the immune response of sows, and protecting the delivered piglets through elevated maternal antibodies [7, 23, 24] . Unfortunately, the exposure to traditional PEDV strains or the above-mentioned live-attenuated vaccine strains provide limited cross-protection against the epidemics of the novel virulent PEDV strains [15] . Therefore, a novel vaccine against these new strains is urgently needed. In the present study, we have developed a high passage PEDVPT-P96 viral stock by serial passaging in Vero cells and have provided evidence of its viral attenuation.

            "text": "By comparing the sequences of the parental virulent PEDVPT-P5 and attenuated PEDVPT-P96 strains to identify potential genetic determinants for viral attenuation, we demonstrated that most non-silent mutations are located in the S gene. On comparing the result of sequence analysis with other previous studies, two mutations (S887R and C1354F) identified in the attenuated late passages of YN1 strain were also identified in our PEDVPT-P96 strain. However, the deletion at the position of aa 144 of the S gene, suggested by the same study as a potential attenuation marker for PEDV [10] was not found in PEDVPT-P96; alternatively, an aa substitution (T144I) occurred in this particular region. The clinical significance of these mutations requires further elucidation. Of note, one unique aa substitution (F554S) was observed in the COE neutralizing domain in PEDVPT-P96, but the mechanism of how it interferes with antibody recognition remains to be elucidated. However, the results of in vivo animal challenge performed in this study suggest that this mutation does not result in the loss of the cross-protection against the parental PEDVPT-P5 strain. In the present study, aa substitutions of F669S in the NSP3 gene and M252I in the NSP15 gene were identified in PEDVPT-P96. The NSP of coronaviruses are well known to be responsible for viral replication, and many of them are reported to be interferon (IFN) antagonists. In PEDV, NSP1, NSP3, NSP7, NSP14, NSP15, and NSP16 have been demonstrated to suppress the IFN-\u03b2 and IRF3 promoter activities [23] . The effects of mutations in NSP3 and NSP15 genes of PEDVPT-P96 on immune modulation need further investigation. Unlike other reports wherein the NSP3 and ORF3 genes tend to comprise more mutations through PEDV attenuation, only one non-silent mutation was observed in each gene in the present study. To date, many studies have been conducted aiming to map attenuating mutation(s) [10, 11, 24] ; however, there is little consistency among different studies, indicating that different strains may harbor different mutation patterns, thereby suggesting that the attenuation may be multifactorial and introduction of attenuating mutation(s) may have implications in generating a safe live attenuated vaccine. This information is invaluable for further quick and rational development of effective and genetically stable vaccines via reverse genetics.",

For PEDV vaccine development, it is crucial for neonatal piglets to receive sufficient maternal antibodies against PEDV via colostrum or milk from previously immunized sows [8, 25] . Furthermore, the amount and the duration of maternal antibodies is closely related to the antibody titers of the immunized sows [9] . Immune protection against PEDV infection, including pathogenicity, immunogenicity, and fecal viral shedding, in nursing pigs born to PEDVPT-P96-inoculated sows as well as the potential for reversal of virulence of the PEDVPT-P96 strain by serial animal passages will be further evaluated.",

The present study provides insights into the pathogenicity, length of viral shedding, and immunogenicity of different passages of cell-adapted PEDV in conventional pigs.",
