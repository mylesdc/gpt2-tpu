            "text": "The rate of change in selective pressures is one of the main factors that determines the likelihood that populations can adapt to stress conditions. Generally, the reduction in the population size that accompanies abrupt environmental changes makes it difficult to generate and select adaptive mutations. However, in systems with high genetic diversity, as happens in RNA viruses, mutations with beneficial effects under new conditions can already be present in the population, facilitating adaptation. In this work, we have propagated an RNA bacteriophage (Q\u03b2) at temperatures higher than the optimum, following different patterns of change. We have determined the fitness values and the consensus sequences of all lineages throughout the evolutionary process in order to establish correspondences between fitness variations and adaptive pathways. Our results show that populations subjected to a sudden temperature change gain fitness and fix mutations faster than those subjected to gradual changes, differing also in the particular selected mutations. The life-history of populations prior to the environmental change has great importance in the dynamics of adaptation. The conclusion is that in the bacteriophage Q\u03b2, the standing genetic diversity together with the rate of temperature change determine both the rapidity of adaptation and the followed evolutionary pathways.",

            "text": "Evolution in gradually changing environments has been modeled as a process of adaptation to a moving optimum [17] [18] [19] [20] . The lower the rate of change, the smaller the drop in fitness the population experiences in each of the environments to which it is exposed. This means that the selective pressure under change has a low intensity at any point of the process and adaptation will occur through the selection of beneficial mutations that provide small effects on fitness [17] [18] [19] [20] . Since these mutations are relatively abundant [21] [22] [23] , there could be a diversity of accessible pathways for adaptation to gradual changes. In contrast to this, rapid environmental changes usually produce strong fitness drops that severely decrease the population size and, thus, the associated genetic diversity [24] [25] [26] [27] , making it difficult to find the scarce, large effect mutations that would make adaptation possible, unless those mutants already exist in the population, in which case the population bottleneck might help them to fix. The situation is even harsher when a particular combination of mutations is required for optimal adaptation. Due to the generally lower number of adaptive solutions to rapid changes, evolution would be more constrained under this condition than when changes take place at a slower rate [28] . Additionally, because epistatic interactions among mutations of small effect are weaker [29, 30] , it has also been suggested that gradual regimes would allow for populations to reach higher fitness values.",

This kind of historical contingency can occur when certain mutations that permit survival at high intensity of the selective pressure are deleterious in the absence of other mutations that can only be selected at a lower intensity of the selective pressure [12, 34] . There are also examples showing that populations evolving under gradual changes reached higher fitness values [9, 13, 25] and/or displayed more genetic diversity among replicate lineages than those evolving under more abrupt changes [9, 12] . In contrast to this, the results obtained in other studies manifested some discrepancy with the prediction of the models, showing that phenotypes obtained under rapid environmental change were fitter [31, 32, 35] or contained a greater diversity of mutations than those evolving at a slower pace [13] . Finally, other studies did not find differences either in the fitness or in the genetic diversity contained in populations that could be attributed to the rate of environmental change [14, 16, 36] . Altogether, those results suggest that the differences in evolutionary outcomes due to the rate of change in the selective pressures depend on both the biological system-with its particular mutation and replication rates, relevance of epistatic interactions, and underlying distribution of mutational effects-and on the assayed environmental condition.",

Specifically, we used as a model the bacteriophage Q\u03b2, of the family Leviviridae, which infects Escherichia coli strains expressing the F pilus that acts as the virus receptor [37] . Bacteriophage Q\u03b2 has an RNA genome of positive polarity (such as poliovirus, foot-and-mouth disease virus, or the coronavirus causing the severe acute respiratory syndrome) of 4217 nucleotides that encodes four proteins: the A2 protein for bacterial lysis and entry, the coat protein, the A1 protein, which is present in low amounts in the capsid and expressed through incorrect reading of the stop codon of the coat protein, and the replicase that copies the RNA genome [37] . As in other RNA viruses, replication in Q\u03b2 proceeds at a high error rate [38] , giving rise to highly heterogeneous populations that adapt fast. The optimal temperature for replication of this virus is 37 \u2022 C (the host temperature).",

The rate of change of selective pressures may have profound consequences for the likelihood of adaptation or extinction of a population, for the followed mutational pathways, and for the maximum degree of adaptation achieved in the process [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . adaptability of RNA viruses to changes in environmental variables. Therefore, to find effective control therapies, it is necessary to improve our knowledge of their evolutionary possibilities, for which RNA bacteriophages can be an appropriate, and easy to handle, model. In this study, the temperature for Q\u03b2 replication was increased from 37 \u2022 C to 43 \u2022 C either suddenly or following two patterns of gradual change. Due to the importance of the standing genetic diversity prior to adaptation [42] , we also compared the evolutionary pathways followed by the virus when populations that differed in their degree of diversification from a clonal origin were propagated at 43 \u2022 C upon a sudden exposure to this temperature.",

In some of them [43] [44] [45] , the used virus variant, which could be directly propagated at 43 \u2022 C, was obtained upon expression of an infectious clone (pBRT7Q\u03b2) containing a cDNA of the virus genome cloned in pBR322 [46, 47] . In another work [34] carried out with a different virus variant (obtained upon expression of the infectious clone pACYCQ\u03b2 [48] ), the temperature had to be gradually increased (in three steps) from 37 \u2022 C to 43.6 \u2022 C degrees to avoid virus extinction. Alignment of the virus genomes cloned in pACYCQ\u03b2 and pBRT7Q\u03b2 showed the presence of two silent substitutions in the latter (C1257U and C2249U). These substitutions, together with G4A, U192C, and C2201U (also silent), were a necessary requirement for the virus obtained upon expression of pACYCQ\u03b2 to adapt to a high temperature [34] . Since a variant that could replicate at 43 \u2022 C was needed to analyze the adaptive process of Q\u03b2 as a function of the rate of temperature change, the virus populations used in this work were all generated from the infectious clone pBRT7Q\u03b2.",

The sudden pattern (S) entailed an abrupt exposure to 43 \u2022 C, after which the temperature was kept constant. The remaining two patterns involved a progressive temperature change: a gradual increase of 1 \u2022 C every 10 transfers (pattern G) or a two-step increase consisting of 30 transfers at 40 \u2022 C and 30 transfers at 43 \u2022 C (pattern TS). Population Q\u03b2-t25 was propagated through the three patterns of change, giving rise to the evolutionary lineages S-t25, TS-t25, and G-t25. Population Q\u03b2-t2 was only subjected to the sudden treatment, giving rise to the evolutionary lineages S-t2. All propagations were carried out in triplicate for a total of 60 transfers at a higher-than-optimal temperature (see Materials and Methods). Note that the number of transfers experienced at 43 \u2022 C was different for different populations: 60, 30, and 10 transfers in populations evolved through patterns S, TS, and G, respectively. The intensity of the selective pressure caused by the increase of temperature was analyzed in an assay in which we determined the virus yield for population Q\u03b2-t2 at different values of this parameter ( Figure 2 ).

After incubation for 2 hours at the temperatures indicated in the figure, virus supernatants were collected as described in Materials and Methods, and titrated to estimate the virus yield, which was expressed as the total number of pfu per mL of culture.

Q\u03b2-t2 did not show any mutation relative to the Q\u03b2 genome cloned in pBRT7Q\u03b2, and Q\u03b2-t25 presented only two polymorphic substitutions: A2187C (S281R in the A1 protein) and C3065U (synonymous). Both populations presented a uracil at positions 1257 and 2249, which is a characteristic of pBRT7Q\u03b2 that facilitates adaptation to a high temperature (see Introduction). In the evolved populations, we found a total of 130 mutations (including fixed and polymorphic), which were located in 35 nucleotide positions ( Figure 4 and Table 2 ). There were no statistically significant differences in the number of mutations per genome ( Figure 4 ) that could be attributed to the pattern of temperature increase (p > 0.05 for all possible pair-wise comparisons between different sets of lineages, Student's t-test). Mutation C3065U, which was present in the ancestor Q\u03b2-t25, was lost in all lineages founded by this population. However, since the mutation was polymorphic in Q\u03b2-t25, we cannot know whether the loss was due to a reversion or to negative selection, though we believe the latter is more plausible. Substitution A2187C, also in Q\u03b2-t25, presented a non-uniform behavior. It was lost in some lineages, whereas in others was fixed or remained polymorphic. From the set of 130 mutations, 105 (located in 23 nucleotide positions) were non synonymous, which is a clear excess over the number of synonymous mutations ( Table 2 ).

            "text": "Previous studies carried out with Q\u03b2 showed a discrepancy in the capacity of this virus to withstand high temperatures. Whereas the virus obtained upon expression of the infectious clone pACYCQ\u03b2 [48] was unable to produce an infectious progeny at 43.6 \u2022 C [34] , the virus obtained upon expression of pBRT7Q\u03b2 [46, 47] could replicate at 43 \u2022 C, although rendering much lower titers than at 37 \u2022 C [44] . The ability of pBRT7Q\u03b2 to generate viruses able to replicate at 43 \u2022 C was probably due to the presence of two silent substitutions (C1257U and C2249U) that, together with G4A, U192C, and C2201U (also silent), allowed for adaptation to a high temperature of the virus obtained upon expression of pACYCQ\u03b2 [34] . Optimal adaptation also needed the fixation of substitutions A1088G, A2748C, and U2776C, whose beneficial effects were dependent on the presence of the aforementioned set of five silent substitutions. As we have shown in this work, Q\u03b2 obtained upon expression of pBRT7Q\u03b2 could efficiently adapt to replication at 43 \u2022 C both when the temperature increased sharply and when it did in a more gradual manner. Thus, the presence of only C1257U and C2249U sufficed to permit virus replication at 43 \u2022 C, keeping population sizes compatible with optimal adaptation. Substitutions A1088G, U2776C, and C2201U were also detected in the evolutionary lineages analyzed in this work, all with origin in pBRT7Q\u03b2. Altogether, the results obtained with both Q\u03b2 variants show the relevance of the genetic background to determine the fitness effects of mutations [3, 4, [50] [51] [52] [53] , in this case of those with beneficial effects at a high temperature. Since some of the mutations that facilitate adaptation of Q\u03b2 to increased temperature were already present in the virus prior to high-temperature exposure, it would be expected that they could exert similar effects under other unrelated selective pressures.",

However, neither the fitness gains reached when the evolution experiment was stopped nor the fitness trajectories along the transfer series were similar. The lower the rate of temperature increase, the larger the number of transfers needed to duplicate the fitness of the ancestor, which agrees with the selection of mutations of smaller effect at lower intensities of the selective pressure, as predicted by theoretical models [17] [18] [19] [20] . By transfer number 60, sudden exposure to 43 \u2022 C also led to fitness values higher than those reached under progressive temperature changes, as observed elsewhere [31, 32, 35] .

The fast selection of these mutations in lineages S-t25 suggests that their ancestor population probably contained some genomes that either had beneficial effects at 43 \u2022 C or could facilitate the acquisition of adaptive mutations at this temperature. The first fixed mutations were not the same in the different treatments, which could indicate that the magnitude of their effects, or even the sign of some of them, depended on the intensity of the selective pressure, something that has also been demonstrated in previous studies [12, 34] . The lower fitness values reached at transfer 60 by populations evolved through the progressive treatments could also be explained if the mutations acquired during transfers carried out at lower temperatures entailed fitness costs at higher temperatures or imposed restrictions on the mutations acquired at later transfers. In line with this argument, some of the first fixed mutations in lineages S-t25, probably responsible for their large fitness increases at early transfers, were not present in the lineages evolved at a progressively increased temperature. The clearest example of a mutation with a probable fitness cost at a high temperature was A1930G, which was only present in lineages G-t25 and TS-t25 at early transfers-to disappear later as the temperature rose-and was always absent in lineages S-t25.",

There was a negative linear relationship between those values and the fitness gains upon the subsequent 10 transfers at 43 \u2022 C, confirming the general observation in micro-organisms that fitter populations adapt more slowly than less fit populations [54] [55] [56] [57] . This decrease in the rate of adaptation indicates that either better-adapted populations have already used most of the beneficial mutations available or that beneficial mutations have weaker effects on fitter genotypes. The latter is a form of epistasis known as diminishing returns epistasis [58, 59] , identified in previous studies, that seems to represent a generic negative coupling among beneficial mutations. Diminishing returns epistasis could explain why some of the mutations responsible for the largest fitness increases in poorly adapted populations (population Q\u03b2-t25 before propagation through the sudden treatment) were not selected when better-adapted populations were also exposed to 43 \u2022 C (lineages TS-25 at transfer number 30 and lineages G-t25 at transfer number 50).",

Due to differences in their life histories, both ancestors Q\u03b2-t2 and Q\u03b2-t25 probably contain different genetic diversity, arguably lower in population Q\u03b2-t2 than in Q\u03b2-t25. The rapidity of adaptation in lineages S-t25 suggests the presence in their ancestor populations of some genomes containing mutations that facilitate adaptation to 43 \u2022 C. These genomes should be present in low frequencies, since population Q\u03b2-t25 does not have higher fitness than Q\u03b2-t2 at 43 \u2022 C. In contrast to this, adaptive mutations were probably absent from population Q\u03b2-t2 and had to be generated de novo, which causes the lower rate of adaptation in lineages S-t2.

The main differences in the consensus sequences of lineages St-25 and S-t2 at transfer number 60 were due to mutations represented in only one evolutionary lineage. Those mutations could not have selective value and may have been fixed through hitchhiking.

Kashiwagi et al. [60] prepared several site-directed mutants containing different sets of mutations among those selected at a high temperature, and determined some of the parameters that characterize the Q\u03b2 infective cycle. All the combinations of assayed mutations increased the phage adsorption rate and decreased the latent period at 43.6 \u2022 C, which agrees with adaptation to this temperature. However, surprisingly, the same site-directed mutants displayed decreased thermal stability at 43.8 \u2022 C, which was attributed to the presence of substitution A1088G (D342G) in the A2 protein. Nucleotide D342 is placed near the surface of the capsid and has been suggested to interact with the coat protein. Thus, mutations at this position can alter the stability of the capsid [61] . Further experiments showed that stability could be restored, at least partially, through silent mutations that affect the structure of the RNA. Other substitutions that may have an effect on virus stability are C1649U (synonymous, in the coat protein), A1930G (Q195R in the A1 protein), U2016C (F224L in the A1 protein), and G3945A (G531S in the replicase). All of them were identified in an experiment designed to select an increased virus multiplication rate at 37 \u2022 C, which was associated with decreased stability at the same temperature [62] . Altogether, these results illustrate how the optimization of some fitness traits entails a cost in others, requiring the presence of additional mutations to generate an optimized genotype. Currently, the crystal structure of all the Q\u03b2 proteins has been determined [61, [63] [64] [65] [66] , opening the door to computational studies able to assess whether a particular mutation (or combination of mutations) influences the stability of the protein. Similar studies could be carried out with the genomic RNA.",

The analysis of the mutational dynamics at the molecular level would need to track the changes in the frequency of particular substitutions through time by means of high-throughput sequencing techniques. Determination of the consensus sequences of sets of biological clones at different points of the process would be very useful to determine which associations of mutations are favored (such as U2016C, U3311G, and C3903U, which appear always together in the same lineages, suggesting that their positive effect could be dependent on their joint presence), and to determine the intra-population dynamics of adaptation. These studies are currently under progress and will help to better elucidate the relationships between the pattern of change in the environmental variables, the internal structure of populations, and the availability of adaptive pathways.",

The supernatant of an overnight culture obtained from a transformed colony was used to infect E. coli Hfr (Hayes) in semisolid agar at a multiplicity of infection (moi) that allowed for the generation of well-separated lytic plaques. Under these conditions, there is a high probability that each lytic plaque results from the replication of a single virus for a limited number of generations, and, thus, they can be considered biological clones. The virus progeny contained in a randomly chosen lytic plaque was the origin of all the populations used in this study.",

Populations obtained at transfer number 2 (Q\u03b2-t2) or 25 (Q\u03b2-t25) were propagated for 60 additional transfers but, instead of at 37 \u2022 C, the replication temperature was increased according to the different patterns shown in Figure 1 .

Absolute fitness was expressed as the number of doublings per two hours, and was calculated as log 2 [(N f -N 0 )/N 0 ], where N 0 is the initial input of virus and N f is the number of progeny pfu.

RNA samples were resuspended in RNase-free water and stored at \u221280 \u2022 C. RNAs were used for cDNA synthesis with the avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega), followed by PCR amplification using Expand high-fidelity DNA polymerase (Roche). The oligonucleotide primers used for PCR have been described previously [67, 68] . PCR products were column-purified (Qiagen) and subjected to standard Sanger sequencing using Big Dye Chemistry with an automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems; Perkin Elmer). Sequences were assembled with SeqMan Pro (DNASTAR Lasergene 12 Core Suite) and aligned to the sequence of the cDNA of bacteriophage Q\u03b2 cloned in the plasmid pBR322 using the program Clustal X2.1 (Multiple Alignment Mode and default parameters). Mutations relative to this sequence were identified using BioEdit Sequence Alignment Editor. To make a more thorough analysis, the mutations, either fixed or polymorphic, that were detected in each evolutionary lineage were visually inspected in the chromatograms of the other lineages to evaluate their possible presence as polymorphisms not recognized by the sequence analysis programs.
