Innate immunity is the first line of defense against invading pathogens, but relatively little is understood regarding host intrinsic mechanisms that guard against ZIKV. Here, we show that host tripartite motif-containing protein 56 (TRIM56) poses a barrier to ZIKV infection in cells of neural, epithelial and fibroblast origins. Overexpression of TRIM56, but not an E3 ligase-dead mutant or one lacking a short C-terminal portion, inhibited ZIKV RNA replication. Conversely, depletion of TRIM56 increased viral RNA levels. Although the C-terminal region of TRIM56 bears sequence homology to NHL repeat of TRIM-NHL proteins that regulate miRNA activity, knockout of Dicer, which abolishes production of miRNAs, had no demonstrable effect on ZIKV restriction imposed by TRIM56. Rather, we found that TRIM56 is an RNA-binding protein that associates with ZIKV RNA in infected cells. Moreover, a recombinant TRIM56 fragment comprising the C-terminal 392 residues captured ZIKV RNA in cell-free reactions, indicative of direct interaction. Remarkably, deletion of a short C-terminal tail portion abrogated the TRIM56-ZIKV RNA interaction, concomitant with a loss in antiviral activity. Altogether, our study reveals TRIM56 is an RNA binding protein that acts as a ZIKV restriction factor and provides new insights into the antiviral mechanism by which this E3 ligase tackles flavivirus infections.",

Nonetheless, the antiviral mechanism remains unclear and whether TRIM56 restricts other flaviviruses remains to be determined. In this study we demonstrated that TRIM56 inhibits ZIKVs of Asian and African lineages and a dengue virus serotype 1 replicon. We additionally uncovered that TRIM56 is an RNAbinding protein and that a portion of the C-terminal NHL-like domain mediates the association of TRIM56 with ZIKV RNAs in infected cells. Importantly, the RNA-binding activity of TRIM56 was found to be required for its antiviral function, although it alone is insufficient. In contrast, TRIM56 restricted ZIKV in Dicer-deficient cells, indicating an antiviral mechanism independent of miRNA regulation, a function known to be associated with NHL-containing proteins. In aggregate, our work identifies TRIM56 as a novel restriction factor of ZIKV and sheds new lights on the antiviral mechanism of TRIM56 against flaviviruses.",

As with other flaviviruses, ZIKV possesses a~11-kb long, singlestranded RNA genome of positive polarity. After infecting susceptible cells, the viral genomic RNA is released into the cytoplasm and subsequently translated to a large polyprotein that is cleaved into three structural proteins (C, prM/M, and E) and seven non-structural (NS) proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5) by a combination of viral and host proteases [2] . While the structural proteins make up the virions, viral NS proteins along with the genomic RNA template assemble into replicase complexes on cytoplasmic membrane structures, synthesizing nascent viral RNAs that are packaged into progeny viruses and released from infected cells to go on infecting na\u00efve cells [2] . The replication and pathogenesis of ZIKV depend upon its intricate interplay with host factors, much of which, however, remains to be elucidated.",

            "text": "Based on the phylogeny of viral sequences, ZIKV is classified into two major lineages, African and Asian [3] . First isolated in 1947 in Uganda [4] , ZIKVs of African lineage have rarely been associated with human cases, which typically exhibit an acute febrile illness. However, the outbreaks in the past decade of viruses of Asian lineage, not only greatly outnumbered the human infections known to be caused by the African virus but are notorious for their serious complications. Mounting evidence suggests that infection by ZIKV of Asian lineage is linked to congenital defects including microcephaly and spontaneous abortion [5] [6] [7] and to Guillain-Barre syndrome and thrombocytopenia in adults [8, 9] . Precisely how ZIKV causes these congenital and neurological disorders is unclear, but both viral and host factors have been suggested to play a role [10] . Of note, ZIKV replicates in neural progenitor cells, causing cell cycle arrest and/or death of neurons [10, 11] . Although mosquito bite is the most common route of ZIKV infection, ZIKV can also spread from person to person via sexual contact or vertically from pregnant woman to fetus [12] [13] [14] [15] . Consistent with these epidemiological findings, previous studies have revealed that ZIKV infects human skin cells, placental cells, endometrial stromal cells, etc. . . [11, [16] [17] [18] . Further studies on tissue tropism of the virus and factors regulating viral replication in and host responses of susceptible cell types are warranted, as they will yield novel insights into mechanisms of ZIKV pathogenesis and may identify therapeutic targets.",

The mammalian innate immune system constitutes the first line of defense against invading microorganisms including viral pathogens. A hallmark of the intrinsic antiviral responses is the rapid induction of interferons (IFNs). Once produced, IFNs act in a paracrine and/or autocrine fashion, signaling through cell surface IFN receptors and downstream Jak-Stat pathway, culminating in the upregulation of hundreds of IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) products that collectively establish an antiviral state, reining in viral replication and spread [19] . Flaviviruses are known to subject to innate immune control and ZIKV is no exception [20] . It has been recently reported that mice lacking Ifnar1 or triply deficient for Irf3/Irf5/Irf7 supported heightened ZIKV replication, concomitant with developing neurological diseases [21] . Of the~300 known ISGs, IFITM1, IFITM3 and Viperin have been shown to inhibit ZIKV [22, 23] . However, much remains to be learned regarding ZIKV restriction factors-inhibitory host factors against ZIKV, particularly those that are constitutively expressed and whose expression is not or only moderately induced by IFNs.",

Although the inhibitory effects on these viruses invariably rely upon the E3 ligase activity as well as the Cterminal integrity of TRIM56 [24, 25] , the underlying mechanism remains elusive. In addition, whether the antiviral spectrum of TRIM56 can be extended to other viruses within the flavivirus genus, especially ZIKV, is an intriguing and important question to answer.",

Although the C-terminal region of TRIM56 bears sequence homology with the NHL repeat motif of several other TRIM proteins [26] that bind miRNAs and/or mRNAs [27] [28] [29] , we found that the inhibition on ZIKV replication by TRIM56 was not undercut in Dicer-deficient cells, indicative of a miRNA-independent antiviral mechanism. Interestingly, we revealed that TRIM56 was associated with ZIKV RNA in infected cells via its C-terminal portion and such capability was required for its antiviral function. Altogether, our work illustrates that TRIM56 is an intrinsic host restriction factor of ZIKV and shed new lights on the mechanism of action by which this E3 ligase curbs flavivirus replication.",

N-terminally Flag-and HA-tandem tagged human TRIM56 (FH-T56) was inserted into the pCX4pur retroviral vector backbone, to yield pCX4pur-FH-T56. To express a recombinant TRIM56 protein fragment in E. coli for polyclonal antibody production and protein-RNA interaction assay, we inserted a cDNA fragment encoding the C-terminal 392 aa of human TRIM56 (T56-C392) into pMAL-c4x (New England Biolabs). The resultant plasmid vector, designated pMAL-c4x-T56-C392, allowed expression and subsequent purification of an MBP-T56-C392 fusion protein in E. coli. The plasmid encoding serotype 1 DENV replicon, pACYC-DENV1-Rluc2A-Rep [30] , was obtained from Ju-Tao Guo and Jinhong Chang (Baruch S. Blumberg Institute) with permission of Pei-Yong Shi (University of Texas Medical Branch). The NS4B coding sequence of ZIKV (MR766 strain) was amplified by PCR from the cDNA of virally infected Vero cells and ligated into pEF6/V5-His-TOPO (Invitrogen) to yield the pEF6-ZIKV-NS4B-V5His6 construct, from which NS4B would be expressed as a protein fused to C-terminal V5-His6 epitope tags.

HEK293-T3Y cells that stably express very low levels of C-terminally YFP-tagged TLR3 were kindly provided by Kate Fitzgerald (University of Massachusetts Medical School). To stably express Flag-and HA-tandem tagged TRIM56 (FH-T56), we transduced HEK293-T3Y cells with a replication-incompetent retrovirus packaged from pCX4pur-FH-TRIM56. Following selection with puromycin, surviving cells were pooled, designated as HEK293-T3Y-FH-T56 cells, and used for subsequent analyses. The blasticidin-resistant, HEK293 cells with stable, constitutive expression of Flag-tagged WT TRIM56 or the E3 ligase-dead CC21/24AA mutant have been described [24] . To create HEK293 cells with constitutive expression of the TRIM56-Flag mutant lacking C-terminal 693-750 residues, cells were transduced with a pCX4bsr-derived retroviral vector carrying the mutant TRIM56 cDNA, followed by stable selection with blasticidin. Similar strategy was adopted to establish SK-N-SH-, HEK293T-and No-Dice (4-25)-derived cell populations with constitutive expression of TRIM56-Flag or the empty pCX4bsr vector, as controls.",

Specifically, to generate neural progenitor cells (NPCs), tissue was suspended in Dissociation Solution (DS) consisting of Hibernate E-Ca without B27 and Papain (2 mg/ml) (BrainBits, LLC) for 10 min at 30\u02daC, allow the tissue to settle and replace DS with Hibernate EB (HEB) medium (Invitrogen) and triturate with pasture pipette for 1 min and allow undispersed pieces to settle. Supernatant was transferred, centrifuged at 200 x g for 1 min, aspirated and the pellet cells resuspended in NpGrow (BrainBits, LLC). Cells were counted and diluted with NpGrow at 2 ml/10 cm 2 and plated on ultra-low attachment plates at 2.5 x 10 4 cells/10 cm 2 and incubated at 37\u02daC, 5% CO 2 , 95% humidity. Half of the media were exchanged with fresh 37\u02daC CO 2 equilibrated NpGrow every 3-4 days; neurospheres are present at 4-7 days. To differentiate NPCs into primary neuronal cultures, neurospheres from day 7 cultures were dissociated in DS for 10 min at 30\u02daC, centrifuged at 200 x g, and DS was replaced with NbActiv4 neuron culture medium (BrainBits). Cells were counted and seeded into 24-well plates at 2 x 10 5 cells/well and incubated at 37\u02daC, 5% CO 2 , 95% humidity.

            "text": "To study host factors that impact ZIKV replication, we first surveyed a number of human and animal cell lines of various tissue origins for ZIKV susceptibility. Cells were infected by MR766, a prototype African strain of ZIKV, followed by immunofluorescence staining of viral E protein expression at 72 h.p.i. Three human hepatocyte cell lines, including Huh7, PH5CH8, and HLCZ01, were all susceptible to ZIKV infection, albeit to different degrees (S1 Fig). The hepatoma Huh7 cells were previously reported to support ZIKV infection [44] . We found Huh7 cells supported the highest efficiency of ZIKV infection, with 100% of cells infected and exhibiting significant cytopathic effect (CPE) at 72 h.p.i. HLCZ01, a recently established human hepatoma line, was also highly susceptible, with >90% cells infected by ZIKV. In comparison, PH5CH8, a non-neoplastic hepatocyte line that harbors intact innate immune responses resembling primary human hepatocytes [38, 40, 45] , was permissive for ZIKV but less susceptible than Huh7 and HLCZ01. HeLa-FitA2 cells, which were derived from the human cervical epithelial carcinoma cell line HeLa and stably express the Tet repressor and harbors a single integrated Flp recombination target site allowing for rapid generation of Tetinducible stable cell lines, also supported robust ZIKV infection (S2 Fig). The human embryonic kidney HEK293 cells had been reported to support low efficiency of ZIKV infection [11] . We examined three different HEK293-derivatives, HEK293-FIT, HEK293-T3Y and 293T cells, and found they supported varying degrees of ZIKV replication (see below). A notable feature of ZIKV infection in humans is its neurotropism [46] [47] [48] . We thus examined two human cell lines of neural origin, i.e., the neuroblastoma line SK-N-SH and SVGA, a fetal glial cell line, and found both to be permissive for ZIKV infection (S3 Fig). Apart from the human cell lines, we found the African green monkey kidney cell line BSC1 and the Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell line both to be susceptible to ZIKV infection (S4 Fig). We also examined the susceptibility of three commonly used mouse cell lines, Hepa1-6, L929 and MEF, to ZIKV infection and compare these lines with Huh7 and HEK293, which represent human cell lines with relatively high and low permissiveness for ZIKV infection, respectively. Cells were infected with ZIKV-MR766 for different time periods, followed by quantification of intracellular viral RNA abundance by qPCR that sensitively detects viral RNA replication. As shown in S5 Fig, Huh7 cells were highly permissive, harboring 10 8 copies of ZIKV RNA per microgram of total RNA already at 24 h.p.i. There was a further,~4-fold increase in viral RNA levels at 48 h.p.i., which reached sub-10 9 copies/\u03bcg total RNA range. In contrast, HEK293 cells were much less permissive, harboring mid-10 6 copies/\u03bcg total RNA range of viral RNAs at 24 h.p.i. ZIKV RNA replication increased by~18-fold in HEK293 cells at 48 h.p.i, approaching that of Huh7 cells at 24 h.p.i. However, all three murine cell lines examined (hepa1-6, L929 and MEF) exhibited limited permissiveness, if any, for ZIKV, harboring mid-10 5 to~10 6 copies/\u03bcg total RNA range viral RNA at 24 h.p.i. Moreover, viral RNA levels did not increase in hepa1-6 and MEFs, while had a mere~2-fold uptick in L929 cells, at 48 h.p.i. Collectively, these data demonstrate that ZIKV infects and replicates in a broad range of human and animal cell lines, although the susceptibility of different cell lines vary considerably.",

To determine whether TRIM56 impacts ZIKV fitness, we conducted infection experiments in HeLa-FitA2-T56 cells with Tet-inducible expression of HA-tagged TRIM56 we developed previously [34] . In these cells robust expression of HA-TRIM56 protein could be turned on upon addition of doxycycline (Dox) to culture medium (Fig 1A, compare lanes 2 vs l). When infected with ZIKV-MR766, cells without HA-TRIM56 expression harbored abundant viral E protein at 72 h.p.i. (Fig 1A, lanes 3 and 5) . In contrast, the level of ZIKV E protein was profoundly reduced in cells with Dox-induced HA-TRIM56 expression (Fig 1A, lanes 4  and 6) . Consistent with the viral protein data, progeny virus titers in culture supernatants were significantly lower in cells induced for HA-TRIM56 expression than those cultured in the absence of Dox (Fig 1B, compare bars 4 vs 3, a 11.7-fold decrease at MOI 0.5). Immunofluorescence staining revealed that the percentage of cells positive for ZIKV E antigen was substantially lower in cells with Dox treatment than those without (Fig 1C) . To ensure this is not a cell-type-specific phenomenon, we assessed the anti-ZIKV activity of TRIM56 in HEK293--FIT-T56 cells that express HA-TRIM56 in a Tet/Dox-inducible manner [24] . As shown in Fig  1D, the results mirrored those obtained in HeLa-FitA2-T56 cells. In addition to the Tet-inducible expression system, a constitutive overexpression strategy was also utilized to examine the impact of TRIM56 on ZIKV infection. Retrovirus-mediated ectopic expression of Flag-HAtagged TRIM56 (FH-T56) curtailed viral E protein expression in HEK293-T3Y cells infected by ZIKV (Fig 1E, compare lanes 4 vs 3, and lanes 6 vs 5). Taken together, these results reveal that ectopic expression of TRIM56 inhibits the propagation of an African strain of ZIKV.",

The AA and Cterminal aa 693-750 deletion mutants also lost their abilities to limit progeny ZIKV production, as compared with WT TRIM56 (Fig 4D, compare bars 3 and 4 vs 2, increases of~12-19-fold). In aggregate, these results suggest that the E3 Ub ligase activity and the C-terminal 693-750aa portion are both indispensable for TRIM56-mediated restriction of ZIKV.",

            "text": "TRIM56 targets certain RNA viruses for inhibition at different steps of viral life cycle. It inhibits influenza viruses, YFV and DENV2 by impeding viral RNA synthesis [24, 26] but curbs TRIM56 is an RNA-binding protein that restricts Zika virus human coronavirus (HCoV)-OC43 by acting at the stage of viral packaging/release [24] . To pinpoint where TRIM56 exerts its antiviral action during ZIKV life cycle, we compared the kinetics of intracellular viral RNA accumulation at different times following infection between control and TRIM56-overexpressing cells. At 2 h.p.i., a time point immediately after viral entry and prior to initiation of viral RNA replication, intracellular viral RNA levels were comparable between control HEK293-T3Y cells and cells expressing FH-T56, suggesting that TRIM56 does not affect cellular entry of ZIKV (Fig 5A) . Intracellular viral RNA abundance began to climb at 24 h.p.i. in both cells but did so much more quickly and robustly in cells without FH-T56 expression. For all three time points examined at/after 24 h.p.i., ZIKV RNA replicated to significantly lower levels in FH-T56 cells than in control HEK293-T3Y cells ( Fig  5A) . Confirming the effect was not virus strain-specific, we obtained similar results from experiments using ZIKV-PRVABC59 in lieu of ZIKV-MR766 (Fig 5B) . Importantly, the inhibitory effect of TRIM56 on viral RNA replication was lost upon mutations that abolish the E3 ligase activity or delete its C-terminal portion (Fig 5C) . Furthermore, ZIKV RNAs replicated to significantly higher levels in HeLa-shT56 cells with stable TRIM56 knockdown than in HeLa-shCtrl cells (Fig 5D) , suggesting that endogenous TRIM56 shares the effect with overexpressed TRIM56. We conclude from these data that TRIM56 restricts ZIKV infection by inhibiting viral RNA replication, and that such capacity depends on both its E3 ligase activity and TRIM56 is an RNA-binding protein that restricts Zika virus the integrity of C-terminal portion. Of note, these observations are reminiscent of the effects of TRIM56 on BVDV, YFV, and DENV2 [24, 25] , suggesting a shared antiviral mechanism against flaviviruses. To determine whether this can be said with another flavivirus, we electroporated a luciferase-encoding DENV1 replicon into HEK293-FIT-T56 cells that were repressed (-Dox) or induced (+Dox) for HA-TRIM56 expression and followed up the viral RNA replication kinetics (S6 Fig). Similar to the effects of TRIM56 on BVDV and DENV2 replicons [24, 25] , the result showed that while translation of the input DENV1 replicon RNA (at 3 h post electroporation) was not affected by TRIM56, viral RNA replication at later time points was always significantly lower in cells with HA-TRIM56 induction than those not induced.",

While TRIM56 is classified within the subgroup C-V that consists of TRIM proteins without known functional domains in their C-terminal regions, the C-terminal portion of TRIM56 exhibits sequence homology with the NHL repeat of several TRIM-NHL proteins including TRIM2, TRIM3, TRIM32 and TRIM71 [26] . Of these, TRIM71 and TRIM32 were reported to bind to miRNAs and/or mRNAs and regulate their function or metabolism [27] [28] [29] .

It should be noted that total small RNA deep sequencing analysis had shown these two Dicer-knockout 293T cell lines were deficient in miRNA expression globally, as opposed to 293T-WT cells, in a previous study [33] . Our miRNA qPCR data thus confirmed the reported phenotype of these cells. Next, we wondered if Dicer deficiency affected ZIKV fitness in these 293T-derived cells. Although No-Dice (2-20) cells were slightly impaired for supporting intracellular ZIKV RNA replication ( Fig 6B) and progeny virus production (Fig 6C) , No-Dice (4-25) cells permitted ZIKV propagation at efficiencies comparable to 293T-WT cells (Fig 6B and 6C) . These data suggest that host miRNAs are not essential for ZIKV replication. In subsequent experiments, we utilized No-Dice (4-25) and 293T-WT cells for comparison to dissect the possible role of host miRNAs in the anti-ZIKV action of TRIM56.",

HEK293 cells expressing control vector (Bsr), WT TRIM56, the E3-ligase-dead AA mutant, or Mut N (deltaaa 693-750) lacking a portion of the C-terminal NHL-like repeat sequence were infected by ZIKV, followed by RNP-IP of TRIM56-RNA complexes and qPCR quantifying the viral RNAs associated with TRIM56. The ectopically expressed, Flag-tagged WT and mutant TRIM56 proteins were all efficiently immunoprecipitated by the anti-Flag antibody (Fig 7A, lanes 2-4) , and no background was detected in negative control (Bsr) cells (lane 1). Immunoblotting detection of ZIKV NS5 protein in input cell lysates confirmed the successful infection of ZIKV (lanes 6-9) and the antiviral effect imposed by WT TRIM56 (lane 7). Immunoblotting of the IP-enriched protein complexes showed no association of TRIM56 with viral NS5 protein or cellular actin (Fig 7A, lanes 1-4) , demonstrating the specificity of the RNP-IP assay. Next, we quantified the ZIKV RNA levels co-immunoprecipitated with TRIM56 or the two TRIM56 mutants. Strikingly, significant enrichment of ZIKV RNAs was observed with WT TRIM56 or the AA mutant, but not Mut N lacking C-terminal aa 693-750 (Fig 7B, compare bars 2 and 4  vs 1, increases of~6-8-fold) . These data suggest that TRIM56 binds to viral RNA in ZIKVinfected cells via its C-terminal portion. Because the AA mutant was as efficient as WT TRIM56 in co-precipitating ZIKV RNAs (Fig 7B) , we conclude that the E3 ligase activity, although indispensable for the antiviral function against ZIKV, is not required for the ability of TRIM56 to associate with viral RNAs.",

Their quality and purity were verified by Coomassie blue staining (Fig 7C, left panel) and immunoblotting (right panel) following SDS-PAGE. The recombinant proteins were incubated separately with ZIKV RNA, and thereafter the protein-RNA complexes were recovered by the MBP-tag-binding amylose resin, whereby the associated protein and RNA were isolated. Immunoblotting analysis indicated successful pull-down of the bait proteins, MBP-polylinker and MBP-T56-C392, with comparable efficiency (Fig 7D) . qPCR analysis revealed that, compared with amylose resin alone or the MBP-polylinker control protein pull down groups, there was significant enrichment of ZIKV RNA by recombinant MBP-T56-C392 protein, regardless of viral RNA origin (be it MR766 or PRVABC59) (Fig 7E) . These data demonstrate that TRIM56 can directly associate with ZIKV RNA via its C-terminal portion.

At 72 h.p.i, cells infected with increasing doses of ZIKV-MR766 all exhibited \u00e3 3-fold increase in TRIM56 protein, compared with mock-infected cells (compare lanes 2-6 vs lane 1). This was not secondary to an overt IFN response, as minimal induction of IFIT3, a well-characterized ISG and sensitive marker of IFN production, was merely observed at high MOIs (lanes 5 and 6), and high concentration IFN treatment (lane 7) did not give rise to more robust uptick of TRIM56 expression than ZIKV, despite being a much stronger inducer of IFIT3 expression. Subsequently, qPCR of TRIM56 and ISG56 mRNA expression confirmed the protein data and indicated that the ZIKV upregulation of TRIM56 occurred at mRNA level (Fig 9B and 9C) . To determine whether this is the case in primary cells of neural origin, we examined Trim56 expression in primary mouse cortical neurons. Because it was challenging to obtain large number of neurons for immunoblotting, we utilized qPCR assay to quantify the mRNA levels of Trim56 prior to and at 24 and 48 h.p.i., respectively, of ZIKV-PRVABC59 (MOI = 1). As shown in Fig 9D, these cells were found to have basal expression of Trim56. In line with the expression pattern of TRIM56 transcript in SVGA cells, Trim56 mRNA abundance was upregulated by~2-fold at 48 h.p.i. In aggregate, the experiments show that TRIM56 is expressed in human and mouse neural cell types, which moderately upregulate the expression of this antiviral protein in response to ZIKV infection.",

Ectopic expression of TRIM56 inhibited ZIKV propagation, while depletion of endogenous TRIM56 had the opposite effect. Importantly, this was demonstrated in cells of fibroblast, epithelial and neural origins, representative cell types targeted by ZIKV in vivo. No less important, we confirmed that TRIM56 restricts both African and Asian lineages of ZIKVs. To our knowledge, this is the first study that identifies a host restriction factor of ZIKV in the TRIM protein family. Taken into account the neurotropism of ZIKV infection in vivo, our revelations that TRIM56 was basally expressed in human brain [25] , human astrocytes SVGA and primary mouse neurons (this study) and that its expression was elevated following ZIKV infection in neural cell types support the biological relevance of TRIM56 as a host restriction factor of ZIKV. In agreement with our previous observation [25] , TRIM56 abundance was only moderately upregulated by coli were separated on SDS-PAGE, followed by Coomassie blue staining (left) and immunoblotting (right), respectively. Results were representative of three independent experiments. Solid circles denote degradation products of MBP-TRIM56-C392. (D and E) Two micrograms of MBP-polylinker or MBP-T56-C392 protein was incubated with 0.5 \u03bcg of ZIKV RNA at room temperature for 30 min, followed by pull-down of MBP-tagged proteins using amylose resin. After washing procedure, specifically bound proteins (D) and viral RNA (E) in pull-down complex were analyzed by immunoblotting (D) and qPCR (E), respectively.

It should be noted that mouse is not a natural host of ZIKV and not susceptible to the virus unless with deficiencies in IFN induction and/or signaling [20, 21] . Consistent with this, our in vitro infection experiments demonstrated that three murine cell lines, MEFs, L929 and hepa1-6, all had limited permissiveness for ZIKV infection, as compared with human cell lines.

            "text": "A subset of TRIM proteins has been shown to modulate innate immune signaling during viral infections [51] . Flavivirus replication generates dsRNAs, a major pathogen-associated molecular pattern that are sensed by two classes of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), i.e., the RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs, RIG-I and MDA5) and TLR3 [52] . While TRIM56 is dispensable for RLR signaling and its overexpression per se does not trigger IFN production, it promotes TLR3-dependent innate immune response via interacting with the adaptor protein TRIF, independent of its E3 ligase activity [34] . It should be noted, however, that several lines of evidence suggest that the antiviral effect of TRIM56 against ZIKV revealed in this study is direct and not secondary to a regulation of IFN antiviral responses. First, ZIKV, like other flaviviruses, is not a strong inducer of IFN responses. Flaviviruses replicate their RNAs within re- TRIM56 is an RNA-binding protein that restricts Zika virus arranged membrane structures that shield and delay viral dsRNAs from innate immune recognition [53] . ZIKV encodes multiple IFN antagonists including NS1, NS4A, NS5, among others, that inhibit IFN production and/or signaling [54] [55] [56] . Consistent with this, we found almost no induction of IFN-\u03b2, IFN-\u03bb1 and ISGs by ZIKV in cell culture within 48 h.p.i (S7 Fig). Second, TRIM56 did not augment, but rather decreased, the minimal induction of IFNs and ISG56 late post ZIKV infection (S7 Fig) , which may be explained by TRIM56-mediated reduction in ZIKV RNA (i.e., the immune stimulus) levels. Third, although ZIKV may elicit TLR3 signaling, as suggested by a recent study showing that ZIKV could disrupt neurogenesis through TLR3 activation [57] , and TRIM56 promotes TLR3 signaling [34] , the E3 ligase-deficient TRIM56 mutant (AA) with intact function in augmenting TLR3/TRIF signaling [34] was incapable of suppressing ZIKV propagation. Furthermore, we demonstrated that efficient knockdown of TLR3 by siRNA ( S8A Fig) had no impact on the anti-ZIKV activity of TRIM56 in HEK293 cells (S8B Fig). Altogether, the anti-ZIKV action of TRIM56 is not attributed to its effect on TLR3 signaling. At present, we cannot fully exclude the possibility that in certain cell types such as immune cell subsets, TRIM56 may promote innate immune activation and finetune host responses, thereby adding to its direct antiviral effect. Whether this mechanism operates will require future studies.",

However, the underlying mechanisms are unclear. It should be noted that TRIM56 is not a universally antiviral host factor against RNA viruses, as it had no inhibitory effects on several negative-stranded RNA viruses, including Sendai virus, vesicular stomatitis virus, and human metapneumovirus [25, 26] . In addition, TRIM56 was not found to impact replication of hepatitis C virus, a hepatotropic RNA virus classified in the family Flaviviridae, in permissive hepatoma Huh7 cells [25] . The present study expands the antiviral spectrum of TRIM56 to two more classical flaviviruses, ZIKV and DENV1. Mirroring the molecular determinants required for TRIM56-mediated restriction of BVDV, YFV and DENV2 [24, 25] , the E3 ligase activity and the integrity of C-terminal portion were found to be both essential for the anti-ZIKV action of TRIM56. Interestingly, the very C-terminal region is also a prerequisite for TRIM56's antiviral action against influenza viruses, although it alone was found to be sufficient in this case [26] . Notably, intracellular viral RNA replication is the molecular stage in the life cycle of all five flaviviruses at which TRIM56 targets for inhibition ( [24, 25] , and this study), arguing strongly a shared mechanism underlying the broad anti-flavivirus activity. As proposed previously [24, 25] , TRIM56 may act on shared proviral host factor(s) for post-translational modifications such as attachment of ubiquitin or ubiquitin-like modifier linkages via its E3 ligase activity, in ways that alter their turn-over rates, trafficking to and/or incorporating into viral replicase complexes. The possibility that TRIM56 binds to viral RNAs via its C-terminal region to hinder viral RNA replication was also raised [25] . As discussed below, we favor the hypothesis that these two scenarios are not mutually exclusive and they operate concurrently and/or in concert to implement viral restriction.",

            "text": "In line with this model, TRIM71 associates with miRNA and Argonaute2 via its NHL domain, thereby regulating miRNA function and gene expression [60] . The NHL domain also targets TRIM71 to cellular mRNAs, leading to repression of gene expression [28] . Additionally, NHL repeats confer binding affinity of other TRIM-NHL proteins to cellular miRNAs and mRNAs [27] [28] [29] . Altogether, these prompted us to determine if miRNA regulation and/or RNA-binding play a part in the anti-ZIKV action of TRIM56. To assess the potential connection of TRIM56 with miRNA, we investigated the impact of TRIM56 on ZIKV infection in Dicer knockout cells that lack the biogenesis of mature miRNAs. We did not observe any influence of host miRNA deficiency on TRIM56-imposed suppression of ZIKV RNA replication, viral protein expression, or progeny virus production, suggesting a miRNA-independent antiviral mechanism. We subsequently tested if TRIM56 could bind to viral RNA in infected cells. Indeed, a specific association between TRIM56 and ZIKV RNA was detected in RNP-IP analysis. In contrast, a TRIM56 mutant lacking aa 693-750, the very C-terminal end portion of the NHL-like domain, was no longer able to capture viral RNA, concomitant with a loss in antiviral activity. Importantly, we have demonstrated that a recombinant TRIM56 fragment composed of the C-terminal 392 aa was able to efficiently capture ZIKV RNA in cell-free reactions, suggesting the TRIM56-viral RNA interaction is direct and does not depend on cellular factors, although we cannot exclude the possibility that certain cellular proteins may fine-tune this interaction in infected cells. Interestingly, the E3 ligase activity, another key anti-ZIKV determinant, was found to be dispensable for TRIM56-ZIKV RNA association. Taken together, these observations imply that the full anti-ZIKV action of TRIM56 necessitates not only the C-terminal RNA-binding region to recognize ZIKV RNA, but also the activity of E3 ligase that catalyzes post-translational modification(s) of pro-viral host (or viral) factors to impede their involvement/function in viral RNA replication (S9 Fig). Given previous reports that TRIM5, TRIM25, and TRIM6, can synthesize unanchored polyubiquitin chains via their E3 ligase activities [61] [62] [63] and that unanchored polyubiquitin chains play a role in the life cycle of an RNA virus (influenza A virus) [64] , there is a possibility that TRIM56 may catalyze the synthesis of unanchored polyubiquitin chains to regulate the flaviviral RNA replication process. We also cannot rule out the possibility that TRIM56 promotes ubiquitin-like modifications, such as sumoylation and ISGylation that were reported with TRIM28 and TRIM25 [65, 66] , respectively, to execute its antiviral function.",
