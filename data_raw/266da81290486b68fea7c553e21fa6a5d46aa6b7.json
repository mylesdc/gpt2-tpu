In practice, however, the data of population density over a study area is often provided in a discrete form, mostly on the grid level. This results in a piecewise constant density of the angle \u03b8, with the precise location of change-points in this density depending on how the 'grids' and the 'circle' intersect (see Fig. ? ?). To derive this density, it is necessary to compute the probability masses of the arcs (which is proportional to the density of the corresponding angles) that comprise the whole circumference, where population density is homogeneous/constant on each arc (and in the grid it belongs). Here we describe an algorithm for computing \u03c3(l|r,\u015d) given the grid-level population density. First of all, using basic plane and line geometry, we solve for the coordinates of the intersection points between the grid lines and the circle (Fig. ??) . Then, for each intersection point (x i , y i ) we solve for the angle \u03b8 i measured from the first quadrant by",

For the sake of computational efficiency, we consider an initially susceptible population with population size N = 10000. The geographical locations of these N individuals were randomly assigned accordingly to a normalized population density across the study area similar to the Ebola dataset. An epidemic was assumed to be initiated by an index case and progressed according to the conventional spatial-temporal SEIR epidemic model [2] . In contrast to our proposed framework, the conventional SEIR model requires an explicit specification of the infectious challenge presented to each susceptible individual. Specifically, a susceptible individual j becomes exposed during [t, t + dt) with probability",

The term K(d ij , \u03ba ) characterises the dependence of the infectious challenge from infective i to j as a function of distance d ij and is known as the spatial kernel function. We assume that K(d ij , \u03ba ) = exp(\u2212\u03ba d ij ). It is noted that K(d ij , \u03ba ) does not have to be a proper density function. Similar to our proposed model, an infected individual is assumed to spend random times in class E and I, modelled by Gamma(\u03b3, \u03bb) and Exponential(1/\u03d5) distributions respectively. We focus on simulations that give rise to epidemics in which around 5% of a study population becomes infected (in 50 days). Specifically, we set \u03b1 = 2.5 \u00d7 10 \u22125 , \u03b2 = 1.8 \u00d7 10 \u22124 , \u03ba = 0.3, \u03b3 = 3, \u03bb = 1 and \u03d5 = 7.

As the purpose here is to compare the computational efficiency, we only record and compare the run-time for 1000 MCMC iterations both in performing the full individual-based SEIR model inference and performing inference of our model. A comparison, in which both model fittings were conducted using similar C++ codes and data structures, shows a significant speed gain in fitting our model (3 vs 2340 seconds).",
