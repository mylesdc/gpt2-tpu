The professional focus of the majority of respondents was critical care (106/249 (43 %)), pediatrics (59/249, (24 %)) or internal medicine (52/249 (21 %)) but none was blood banking. Nearly all respondents (251/263 (95 %)) reported to have access to ICU facilities within their institutions. Most respondents (219/270 (81 %)) reported that intensivists were the most physician group responsible for treatment decisions about critically ill SARI patients. While 125/165 respondents (76 %) reported that they conduct research in ICUs, and 80/161 (49.7 %) had been involved in the conduct of RCTs, including using a placebo comparison (60/161 (37 %)), only 49/226 (21 %) of respondents regularly participated in research networks. Conclusions: Our survey indicated that in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), ICUs are the most likely clinical locations for conducting a clinical trial of convalescent plasma therapy for MERS-CoV, and that most ICUs have experience with such research designs.",

Such a study will require laboratory ability to diagnose MERS-CoV infection and identify antibody titers among previously infected but recovered patients, research infrastructure and ability to lead or participate in an RCT, and the presence of personal and community equipoise among healthcare workers and patients to enroll in such a trial. Therefore, as part of a collaborative effort among colleagues from the Gulf States and Eastern Mediterranean and with the support of the World Health Organization and International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium, we undertook a survey to assess feasibility of conducting a clinical trial of convalescent plasma therapy for patients with MERS-CoV infection in KSA.",

Omitting questions that were deemed not relevant to this study, and modifying or adding questions that were more appropriate to the current objectives led to a questionnaire of 26 items, divided into three main domains of interest. First, four questions aimed to evaluate the ability and capacity of caring for critically ill patients within the KSA health system (e.g., \"How many beds are capable of caring for mechanically ventilated patients in the ICU where patients with severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) would usually be treated?\"). Second, the study sought to explore laboratory capacity to diagnose MERS-CoV infection and Blood Bank ability to prepare convalescent plasma through seven questions (e.g., \"Do you have a mechanism to send specific blood donors (e.g., survivors of MERS-CoV infection) to the blood bank to make donations?\" and \"What methodologies are available in the laboratories associated with your site for MERS-coV testing?\"). The third domain aimed to evaluate research capacity needed to conduct clinical trials and whether or not necessary infrastructure to conduct RCTs existed in KSA, through 10 questions specifically related to research (e.g., \"Do you believe that patients at your hospital would participate in randomized studies in which patients are randomly assigned to one of two or more treatments?\"). The questionnaire was populated using Survey Monkey, was emailed through the snowball methodology, to physicians who are possibly involved in the care of MERS-CoV patients. Snowball sampling is a chain referral sampling where the initial participants are asked to assist in recruiting more subjects by passing on the questionnaire. We initiated contact with 250 participants from 48 hospitals in Saudi Arabia; those in turn invited others, with a total subjects approached being approximately 582. There were three reminders, 2 weeks apart by email to non-respondents, and the data was collected between March and May 2014. A complete list of the survey questions is included in the online supplement (Additional file 1). The Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Ministry of National Guard Health Affairs (RC14/003/R-29 April 2015) approved this study. The first question of the survey was a question about whether the participant consents to the survey.",

            "text": "Our survey results indicate that the research infrastructure at many acute care facilities in Saudi Arabia is likely generally sufficient to conduct a RCT to investigate the efficacy of convalescent plasma treatment for severely ill patients with MERS-CoV. Next steps in such a research program will need to include an observational study of actual clinical and diagnostic practice in the care of patients with MERS-CoV in KSA. This would help to inform design of a pilot clinical trial with a goal to demonstrate feasibility and safety of convalescent plasma evaluation, and would need to occur before a true evaluation of efficacy could take place.",
