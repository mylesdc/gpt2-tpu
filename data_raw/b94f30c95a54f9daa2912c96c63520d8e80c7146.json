One of GHSA's primary areas of focus, known as an 'action package', is an emphasis on strengthening national laboratory systems (Action Package: Detect 1). 9 Through this action package, GHSA enables countries to enhance real-time bio-surveillance and ensure that laboratories are capable of safe, accurate detection and characterisation of epidemic-prone pathogens, including both known and novel threats. 9 In order for public health laboratories to prepare for outbreaks and emerging pandemic threats, they should demonstrate ongoing capacities for routine diagnostics.",

As a WHO collaborating center, CDC provides technical assistance for influenza testing in a network of global laboratories, known as National Influenza Centers (NICs), which have functional links to their assigned WHO reference laboratory and access to quality assured reagents from the CDC Influenza Division through the International Reagent Resource (IRR) (https://www.internationalreagentresource.org). The NICs often have standardised, stateof-the-art equipment, in addition to well-trained molecular biologists. Specimens for routine testing at NICs are received from influenza surveillance sites that include regional hospitals and clinics using the severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) or influenza-like illness case definitions. Frequently, SARI and influenza-like illness sentinel systems are models of successful surveillance in resource-limited countries where epidemiologic data are linked to specimen collection and laboratory testing. 10 An opportunity exists to expand the existing surveillance systems at NICs in GHSA countries by expanding testing capacity for other priority agents.",

All CDC in-house assays utilise Taqman \u00ae probes (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California, United States) with a 5' FAM fluorophore and either an internally linked BHQ-1 \u00ae (Biosearch Technologies, Novato, California, United States) or 3' terminal BHQ-1 \u00ae (Biosearch Technologies, Novato, California, United States) quencher. The RNP control allows laboratory scientists to know if the quality of nucleic acid has been compromised, potentially confounding any rRT-PCR results. These assays have been previously validated to work with several commercial one-step rRT-PCR enzyme kits such as the AgPath-ID TM One-Step RT-PCR kit (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, Massachusetts, United States) and the qScript \u00ae One-Step qRT-PCR kit, low ROX (Quantabio, Beverly, Massachusetts, United States). Real-time PCR instruments evaluated by CDC to be compatible with this reagent panel include the 7500 Fast Dx TM (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California, United States), Mx3000P \u00ae and Mx3005P \u00ae (Agilent, Santa Clara, California, United States), CFX96 TM and CFX96 TM Touch (Bio-Rad, Hercules, California, United States), and the Viia TM 7 in both TaqMan TM Array Card and 96-well PCR plate formats (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, Massachusetts, United States). 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 When encountering an outbreak of unknown etiology, a multiplex platform may enable laboratories to rapidly identify the potential pathogen causing illness; therefore, CDC provided countries access to a multiplex assay kit known as FTD33 Respiratory Pathogens \u00ae (Fast-track Diagnostics, Esch-sur-Alzette, Luxembourg), a commercially available multiplex assay that can detect up to 33 common respiratory viruses and bacteria. The FTD33 comes with its own proprietary primers, probes, PCR buffer, enzyme mix and controls needed to perform the tests. A previous version of the FTD33 kit, the FTD21 Respiratory Pathogens Kit, was validated against the CDC respiratory virus singleplex assay panel. 17 Table 2 compares the pathogens targeted with the CDC sevenpathogen non-influenza respiratory virus panel and the FTD33.",

Preliminary data from two of these laboratories indicated that a total of 362 respiratory specimens were tested, 158 by CDC singleplex respiratory virus assays and 204 by the FTD33 multiplex assay. It is hoped that in the future, the public health laboratory workforce in GHSA countries will collaborate with their epidemiology counterparts and utilise these reagents for the purposes of understanding the diversity of circulating respiratory viral pathogens, calculating the burden of disease for priority pathogens, and using multiplex platforms for outbreak detection.",

The training and materials provided through CDC's engagement in GHSA laboratory strengthening has provided tools and building blocks to more than one-third of all GHSA countries to more readily achieve their goals in laboratory capacity. Data generated from expanded testing will allow for a more complete understanding of the burden of disease in their country. A routine system of collection, transportation, testing and results sharing in a quality assured environment will enable the public health system to respond to outbreaks when they occur.",

Introducing new laboratory testing reagents through the IRR is a way of supporting countries that do not normally perform routine surveillance testing beyond influenza virus detection, and enables them to generate baseline data for additional pathogens. Centralising the distribution of custom CDC testing reagents along with commercial products through the IRR ensured that laboratories had a streamlined, single-stop source for vital, quality-assured laboratory reagents. This eliminates the need to get separate quotes for the same products specific to all the different laboratories. Additionally, by using the IRR as a reagent distribution mechanism, it is easy and fast to deploy new reagents for emergency situations, such as outbreaks of newly emergent disease.",
