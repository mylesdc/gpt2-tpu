Mycobacteria spp., however, are well known for their numerous immune evasion mechanisms that limit the true potential of their therapeutic use. One such major mechanism is the induction of programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1), which mitigates adaptive immune responses. Here, we sought to unravel the molecular pathways behind PD-L1 up-regulation on antigen-presenting cells (APCs) by BCG. We found that infection of APCs with BCG induced PD-L1 up-regulation, but that this did not depend on direct infection, suggesting a soluble mediator for this effect. BCG induced potent quantities of IL-6 and IL-10, and the downstream transcription factor STAT3 was hyper-phosphorylated. Intracellular analyses revealed that levels of PD-L1 molecules were associated with the STAT3 phosphorylation state, suggesting a causal link. Neutralisation of the IL-6 or IL-10 cytokine receptors dampened STAT3 phosphorylation and BCG-mediated up-regulation of PD-L1 on APCs. Pharmacological inhibition of STAT3 achieved the same effect, confirming an autocrine-paracrine cytokine loop as a mechanism for BCG-mediated up-regulation of PD-L1. Finally, an in vivo immunisation model showed that BCG vaccination under PD-L1 blockade could enhance antigen-specific memory CD4 T-cell responses. These novel findings could lead to refinement of BCG as both a vaccine for infectious disease and as a cancer immunotherapy.",

            "text": "An important limitation of this study is that IL-6 and IL-10 are unlikely to constitute the only two cytokines driving the STAT3-PD-L1 pathway, and we expect that there is redundancy in which cytokine drives PD-L1, as long as STAT3 is adequately activated. STAT3 can also be activated by nearly 20 members of the IL-6 and IL-10 cytokine families. However, IL-6 and IL-10 are two of the most abundant cytokines secreted by myeloid cells upon activation, and while dual blockade of the receptors led to a ~45% reduction in PD-L1, this could reflect the fact that blocking antibodies do not completely neutralise all biological activity 33 . STAT3 can also be weakly activated by TLR signalling and Src-family kinases 34,35 , and we cannot exclude the possibility of such contributions to its phosphorylation state. Furthermore, there are undoubtedly other transcriptional co-factors recruited to the Cd274 promoter alongside STAT3. Regardless, we have conclusively shown that STAT3 is biologically essential for its activity by BCG, and linked this to biological targets that are amenable to intervention in clinical settings (e.g. tocilizumab, an \u03b1-IL-6R mAb). Indeed, this study provides four such points of intervention when using BCG: (i)",

            "text": "The correct balance of immune effector and regulatory responses depends on a number of molecular interactions between the antigen-presenting cell (APC) and T-cell. A key interaction for immunological tolerance is between the receptors programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and programmed death-1 (PD-1). APC expression of PD-L1 leads to binding of this molecule to PD-1 on T-cells, resulting in activation of the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 and dephosphorylation of critical kinases involved in T-cell receptor (TCR) signalling. Blockade of this interaction diminishes Treg frequencies 1 , enhances Th1 and Th17 effector cell frequencies 2 and increases cytokine production both in vitro and in vivo 3 . The PD-L1:PD-1 interaction has thus been targeted in immunological situations that feature restricted antigen presentation, T-cell anergy and immune tolerance as detrimental characteristicsnamely chronic infectious diseases and malignancies. In the latter scenario, clinical trials have demonstrated the remarkable efficacy of drugs developed to target these receptors, with up to 87% clinical response rates in some refractory cancers 4 .",

STAT3 can be activated weakly by IL-2 and IL-12, www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ but strongly by prototypical myeloid-type cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-10.

It was found that BCG was able to up-regulate PD-L1 in MHC Class II high CD11c + DCs, but unable to do the same in T-cells, confirming a specific effect in APCs. Next, mice were treated with 1 mg of the PD-L1 blocking antibody MIH5 via the intraperitoneal route, followed by immunisation with subcutaneous BCG. Mice were then given follow-up booster immunisations to maintain the PD-L1 blockade. An isotype control was used at the same concentration to control for non-specific effects. On day 21, splenocytes from immunised mice were then pulsed with either immunodominant and latency-associated antigens (Ag85B and Acr, respectively) or a mixture of protein antigens (PPD). As shown in Fig. 6B , there was a general trend for an increase in antigen-specific cytokine production in CD4 T-cells. Under PD-L1 blockade, BCG induced significantly more IFN-\u03b3 in response to Ag85B/Acr and PPD (IFN-\u03b3: p < 0.0001), compared to the isotype control. TNF-\u03b1 production was also increased in response to Ag85B/Acr (p < 0.01). Regarding IL-2 and IL-17A, there were non-significant increases caused by PD-L1 blockade under both antigen recall conditions. Turning our attention to the CD8 T-cell compartment (Fig. 6C) , we found that BCG was much poorer at inducing antigen-specific cytokine responses, as has been observed previously by others 22 . With the exception of IL-2 after Ag85B/Acr pulsing (p < 0.05), splenocytes from mice that received BCG + isotype control were unable to produce more cytokines than splenocytes from mock-immunised mice. Only two cytokines were found to be increased by PD-L1 blockade beyond the PBS control group in response to Ag85B/Acr but not PPD: IFN-\u03b3 (p < 0.01) and TNF-\u03b1 (p < 0.01), however these effects were marginal. Thus we concluded that PD-L1 blockade can effectively boost CD4-dependent T-cell immunity, with only marginal effects on boosting CD8 T-cell responses.",

Mycobacteria represent an example of immune evasion par excellence due to their ancient history of co-evolution with mammalian immune systems 24 ; indeed, virtually all pathogenic mycobacteria are obligate parasites, requiring intracellular www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ resources in order to thrive and propagate. It is therefore not surprising that they are biologically equipped to effectively counter adaptive immune responses that would lead to their own clearance.",

Furthermore, PD-L1 blockade is able to rescue these cells from functional exhaustion, as demonstrated by the reversal of T-cell apoptosis 28 . For bladder cancer, the tumour surface is reportedly decorated with high levels of PD-L1 molecules, and the tumour-infiltrating B-and T-cells express high levels of both PD-L1 and PD-1 29, 30 . The utilisation of BCG as a prophylactic (TB) or therapeutic (malignancy) treatment for these diseases, combined with a strategy to mitigate the effects of PD-L1, could provide a strong advantage for the efficacy of BCG.",

It has been known for some time that BCG is a strong inducer of these cytokines via rudimentary TLR signalling, however it was not known that they were driving PD-L1 expression in a biphasic response. The observation that inhibition of STAT3 did not lead to a decrease in PD-L1 expression in resting cells-indeed, there was instead a non-significant increase in expression-is consistent with the notion that the PD-L1 gene promoter requires distinct transcriptional apparatus during the steady-state and during active infection. This is in accord with the fact that DCs and macrophages displayed moderate levels of constitutive PD-L1 expression in the absence of any appreciable cytokine levels 31 . Physiologically, this is undoubtedly to prevent spontaneous activation of the adaptive immune system.",

It is interesting to note that PD-L1 blockade in vivo did not greatly boost the antigen-specific CD8 T-cell responses beyond that of the mock-immunised control group. BCG is widely known to only minimally induce cytotoxic T-cell responses, with a strong bias towards CD4 responses 22 . This may be due to so-called CD8 'decoy antigens' , such as TB10.4, that serve to divert responses away from immunogenic epitopes for cytotoxic T-cells 32 . Whether the enhancement of CD4 T-cell immunogenicity in the absence of strong CD8 T-cell immunogenicity leads to better vaccine (i.e. in the case of TB) or immunotherapeutic (i.e. in the case of a carcinoma) outcomes warrants testing in disease-specific animal models. www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ STAT3-activating cytokines, (ii) IL-6/IL-10 cytokine receptors, (iii) the STAT3 transcription factor and (iv) the PD-L1 receptor itself. STAT3 presents a highly appealing therapeutic target other than its role in PD-L1 expression due to the fact that is a pleiotropic master controller of general tolerance in APCs. STAT3 can suppress autophagy 36 , nitric oxide production 37 , IL-12 production 38 , and co-stimulatory molecule expression 39 . Given our new findings, targeting this pathway during vaccination with BCG (for TB or malignancy) could reap multiple therapeutic benefits.",
