However, not all patients who receive long-term, high-dose steroids develop osteonecrosis, indicating that there are individual differences in occurrence. We explored the relationship between polymorphisms and steroid-induced osteonecrosis of the femoral head (SONFH) incidence with variables. We used a multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression model, which is an expansion of logistic regression, for each type of steroid, primary disease, drug dose, applied duration, and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). We also conducted a dose-response meta-analysis to analyze the cumulative dosage and SONFH risk in mutation carriers. There were significant correlations between the ABCB1 rs1045642 mutant and SONFH in the prednisone-use and methylprednisolone/prednisone-use populations. The ABCB1 rs2032582 mutant homozygote had a protective effect in the methylprednisolone/prednisolone renal transplant population. For ApoB rs693, mutation increased the incidence of SONFH in prednisone-use and methylprednisolone/prednisolone-use populations and renal transplant patients. For ApoB rs1042031, mutation increased the risk of SONFH in the prednisone-use population. The PAI-1 rs1799768 mutation had a protective effect on the SONFH risk prednisone-use and renal transplant populations. ABCB1 rs1045642 mutations have a protective effect against SONFH, and ApoB rs693 and rs1042031 increase the SONFH risk. Cumulative dosage and treatment duration had little effect on the results. In addition, there was a dose-effect correlation in ABCB1 rs1045642 and rs2032582 mutation carriers.",

            "text": "Steroid-induced osteonecrosis of the femoral head (SONFH), which leads to collapse of the femoral head and articular dysfunction, has an incidence of 9-40% amongst patients receiving steroid treatment [1] . The exact pathology of SONFH is still unclear and might be related to lipid metabolism disorders, abnormal microcirculation, insufficient blood supply, inflammation, and bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell osteogenesis differentiation dysfunction. The abnormal blood supply leads to the apoptosis of osteocytes and osteoblasts, followed by bone loss and reduced bone mineral density [2] . Lipid metabolism dysfunction is also an important pathology, and steroid application may lead to an increase in blood lipid levels and then to the development of intravascular lipid embolism in the microvasculature [3] . Embolism accumulation might affect microcirculation and increase the pressure of the intramedullary cavity, eventually leading to the death of bone cells. Long-term or mass steroid application is the critical pathogenesis of SONFH [4] .",

However, the results of the ABCB1 G2677T/A polymorphism are still disputed [5] [6] [7] . Our previous research reported only the single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that appeared in more than three studies and indicated that ABCB1 rs1045642 has a protective effect on SONFH in an allelic model and that the ApoB rs693 and rs1042031 mutations promote the pathogenesis of SONFH. ABCB1 rs2032582, MTHFR rs1801133, and PAI-1 rs1799768 were not correlated with SONFH incidence. However, heterogeneity still exists in the previous results, and further analysis of the characteristics of the included studies is needed. Therefore, this research further analyzes the effects of primary disease, type of steroids, cumulative steroid dosage, and treatment duration on the results.",

If the average or median value of the cumulative steroid dosage in each group was not reported, it was estimated. The cumulative dose was generally calculated by multiplying the daily average dose and the treatment duration. For studies with a fixed treatment strategy, the cumulative dosage was calculated by multiplying the dosage of each treatment cycle by the total number of cycles. In the present study, we defined the average body surface area as 1.6 m 2 and the average body weight as 60 kg. For closed-interval categories, the value assigned to each dosage or duration, such as the average or median, was the midpoint. For open-interval categories, the value was estimated as the limit value multiplied by 1.2 [10] . Because of the different types of steroids used in the included studies, it was necessary to convert the doses of different types of steroids to the equivalent dose of prednisone. The conversion standard is 5 mg prednisone = 5 mg prednisolone = 4 mg methylprednisolone = 0.75 mg dexamethasone [11] . The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS), a validated tool for evaluating the quality of observation studies, was used to evaluate the methodological quality of the included studies; the scale includes the following three subscales: selection, comparability, and exposure [12] .

Generally, a significance level of P<0.1 suggests the existence of significant heterogeneity to expand a test's sensitivity [13] .

The results were not obviously changed after considering cumulative dose and treatment duration. In the categorical analysis, mutation increased the risk of SONFH in the prednisone-use population (OR: 5 (Figure 8 ). These results differed from previous results because in previous research a random-effect model was used due to large heterogeneity, and a mixed-effect model was adopted in this research. The results did not change after considering cumulative dose and treatment duration. In the categorical analysis, the protective effect existed in the prednisone-use and renal transplant population. However, there was no significant correlation in the methylprednisolone/prednisolone-use population (4G5G vs 5G5G: OR: 0.44; 95% CI: 0. 18 Furthermore, we sought to analyze the cumulative dosage and SONFH risk in mutation carriers by a dose-response meta-analysis. SONFN/ONFH incidence in mutation carriers cannot be obtained when steroids are not used. Therefore, the minimum dose must be used as a reference, and whether increasing the dose affects SONFH incidence must be assessed. Two dose assessment methods were used: an absolute dose and multiple doses. For ABCB1 rs1045642, there was a correlation between the cumulative dose and the occurrence of SONFH in the mutation carriers. As the dose increased, the risk of SONFH decreased (absolute dose: P=0.008; multiple dose: P=0.0064) ( Figure 9A,B) . This negative correction also persists in homozygous mutation (TT genotype, absolute dose: P=0.0368; multiple dose: P=0.0435) and heterozygous mutation patients (CT genotype, absolute dose: P<0.001; multiple dose: P<0.001) (Supplementary Figure S1A-D) . In wild-type populations, there was no correlation between the dose and the risk of SONFH (absolute dose: P=0.098; multiple dose: P=0.098). Although there was no significant correlation between the ABCB1 rs2032582 mutation and the risk of SONFH, the cumulative dose in the mutant population was correlated with the occurrence of SONFH. As the dose increased, the risk of SONFH decreased (absolute dose: P=0.0231; multiple dose: P=0.0258) ( Figure 9C These findings may suggest that mutation carriers still have a risk of SONFH when using steroids, similar to the wild-type population. If SONFH does not occur after small-dose steroid application, increasing the steroid dose in mutation carriers will not increase but rather decrease the risk of SONFH.",

However, our study included more reports and found that rs2032582 had no correlation with SONFH. Our result is the same as that from another meta-analysis that analyzed the correlation between gene polymorphism and SONFH occurrence with the GRADE method to assess the level of evidence. The results showed that ABCB1 rs1045642 could reduce the occurrence of SONFH but had a very low level of evidence. ApoB rs693 and rs1042031 mutations increased the risk of SONFH and had a moderate level of evidence [46] . The results of our study are essentially the same as those of the above two studies, except for rs2032582. However, our work further analyzed the associations between SNP and SONFH based on steroid type, primary disease, drug dose, and applied duration using a mixed-effects logistic regression model. We also conducted a dose-response meta-analysis to analyze the cumulative dosage and SONFH risk in mutation carriers. Our work expanded the research results and found that cumulative steroid dosage and treatment duration had little effect on the results. There was a dose-effect correlation in ABCB1 rs1045642 and rs2032582 mutation carriers. Another study analyzed the associations between ONFH and genetic polymorphisms of vascular endothelial growth factor rs2010963, endothelial nitric oxide synthase rs2070744, and ABCB1 rs1045642. However, the included studies contained SONFH-and ONFH-related studies. The results showed that the mutations of rs2010963 and rs1045642 increased the risk of ONFH, and the mutation of rs2070744 increased the risk of ONFH in an allelic model. There were errors in the present study, as the authors proposed that the mutation of ABCB1 rs1045642 increased the risk of ONFH, but the data showed that it reduced the risk [47] . Our study analyzed SONFH risk, but not ONFH, which is different from the above study.",

A meta-analysis of the avascular necrosis risk in SLE patients also showed, that in addition to hormonotherapy, arthritic, cushingoid, hypertension, cytotoxic drugs, etc., also affect the occurrence of SONFH [50] .

A dose-response meta-analysis showed that the incidence of osteonecrosis is correlated with both the cumulative dose and treatment duration [51] . However, there is still no related research on specific mutant carriers. First, the present study found that the ABCB1 rs1045642 mutation has a protective effect on SONFH, and the risk will be further reduced with increasing cumulative steroid dosage. It can also be concluded that some mutant carriers will have SONFH when the cumulative dosage is low; however, if SONFH does not occur, the risk of SONFH will not increase when the cumulative dose of steroids is increased. Therefore, for mutant carriers, the critical time period for prevention and diagnosis of SONFH is during the early stage of steroid application, not the late stage. A negative correlation was also found in ABCB1 rs2032582 mutation carriers, even though the mutations were not significantly associated with SONFH in general.",

Second, in stratified analyses, with the increase in variable factors, the results become more dependent on the results of single studies, which will reduce the stability of the results. Third, in dose-response analyses, SONFN/ONFH incidence in mutation carriers without steroid application cannot be calculated; therefore, the minimum dose must be used as a reference. Fourth, our study only analyzed SNPs that were examined in more than three studies, but with emerging research and evidence, more SNPs may be studied in the future.
