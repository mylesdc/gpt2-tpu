(2007) [8] performed a systematic review of the role of the built environment in the transmission of airborne infectious agents. Specifically, they examined whether there was sufficiently strong evidence in the current literature to substantiate a contributory role of ventilation rates and airflow patterns in the airborne transmission of infectious agents in different indoor settings. They concluded that there is strong evidence substantiating the association between ventilation, air movements in buildings and the transmission/spread of infectious diseases such as measles, tuberculosis, chickenpox, influenza, smallpox and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). information on both ventilation rates and health effects. Multiple health endpoints showed similar relationships with ventilation rate and were biologically plausible, although the literature did not provide clear evidence on particular agents. Higher ventilation rates in offices, up to about 25 l/s per person,were shown in the reviewed literature to be associated with reduced prevalence of SBS symptoms. Limited data suggested that inflammation, respiratory infections, asthma symptoms and short-term sick leave increase with lower ventilation rates.Home ventilation rates above 0.5 air changes per hour (h -1 ) were shown in the reviewed papers to be associated with reduced risk of allergic manifestations among children in a Nordic climate.",

Besides the estimated health benefits and policy implementation costs, the suggested prioritization of the policies depends also on the uncertainties of the estimates. Model uncertainties are causing the largest concerns here. They include the selection of pollutants and health end-points associated with them. It is clear that in the current -17 -context a substantial uncertainty is raised from here: it is not clear how much the burden of disease estimates are underestimated due to the dozens of ignored exposures or missing health endpoints for the included exposures. At best the model uncertainties can and should be qualitatively judged by experts before the general implementation of results. Parameter uncertainties are easiest to estimate and evaluate. Quantification of the exposure-response relationships and mass-balance model for exposures belong also to the parameter uncertainties. Variable degree of uncertainty exists in the exposureresponse response relationships based on epidemiological studies. For some of the included pollutants, like PM 2.5 originating from outdoor air, this data is based on a large number of studies, representing very large populations in different climatological regions. The exposure-response relationship of ambient particles has also been used for indoor generated particles. The indoor generated particles have partly similar composition, originating from combustion processes or being resuspended particles originating from soil, for which it is reasonable to assume similar toxicity as for the ambient particles. Some particle fractions, especially the particles from cooking of food, from the occupants, and from textiles, have a different chemical composition with limited direct evidence on their toxicity. Scenario uncertainties are inherent for any future forecasts; we may not know all changes in the systems under investigation and therefore must rely on assumptions. When selecting policies for implementation, the implementation timeframe should also be considered. Most significant element in the scenario uncertainties is related to the development of future building stocks. The current ventilation guidelines are intentionally formulated so that the focus is on the key parameters in terms of health, the exposures, and there are as little as possible elements that require specific -18 -technical solutions. An example of such an issue is the filtration of outdoor air pollution, especially PM 2.5 , but also pollen, other biological particles, ozone, ultrafine traffic particles and so on. Infiltration of ambient particles depends on air exchange rates, size distribution of the outdoor particles, and filtration of the intake air. At lower air exchange rates the prolonged residence time of air indoors and corresponding deposition of particles on indoor surfaces reduces indoor exposures even when the outdoor air is not filtrated. Using window frames and other sedimentation chambers allows for filtrating particles even in natural ventilation systems. Nevertheless, active filtration becomes efficient only in mechanical systems using high quality (above FP7) filters. The used ventilation rate estimates per occupant (lps pp) are calculated using average residence sizes and average numbers of occupants in each country. Population weighted average outdoor concentrations have also been used in estimating the indoor exposures. It is clear that the air filtration needs for a specific building have to be defined using the ambient air quality at the selected building location. In all countries considered there are locations where the outdoor levels exceed the WHO guidelines much more than the national averages used here indicate. When the current methods proposed for determining the potential filtration needs, they have to be applied with worst case estimates for the actual building site, accounting for the whole service life cycle.",
