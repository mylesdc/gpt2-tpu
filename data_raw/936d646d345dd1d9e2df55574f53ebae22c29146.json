The timeline of their publication date and a brief summary of each report are shown in the Figure. Each figure associated with an arrow in the Figure corresponds to a report. The principal information in each report was the following: 1 14/03/2003 (publication date): WHO announced the outbreaks of a severe form of pneumonia in Guangdong, Hong Kong and Vietnam and describes the associated outbreak situation in these regions [1]. 2 21/03/2003: a) update on the number of SARS cases -worldwide; b) case definition criteria; c) preliminary description of the epidemiology, the clinical presentation, the treatment and the laboratory findings of SARS [2]. 3 21/03/2003: CDC described the scope of the outbreak, preliminary case definition, and interim infection control guidance for the United States [3]. 4 28/03/2003: a) WHO's Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network coordinated an international multicentre research project to expedite identification of the causative agent, and to improve in Weekly Epidemiological Record (WER) (n = 12) Reports published in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) (n =5 a ) Reports published in Canada Communicable Disease Report (CCDR) ; b) the first global \"grand rounds\" on clinical features and treatment of SARS were held by WHO on March 26 ; c) update on the number of SARS cases -worldwide [4]. 5 28/03/2003: a) description of an unusual cluster of cases associated with a hotel in Hong Kong (contact tracing and chain of the transmission in the cluster); b) identification of the potential etiologic agent of SARS [5]. 6 28/03/2003, 15/04/2003: summaries of the clinical description of patients with SARS based on information collected since mid-February 2003 in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Bangkok, Singapore, the United Kingdom, Slovenia, Canada, and the United States [6,7]. 7 04/04/2003: WHO issued recommendations for the screening of air passengers leaving affected areas and for the traveler safety to Hong Kong and Guangdong province of China [8]. 8 04/04/2003: a) revision of the SARS case definitions; b) information for case reporting [9]. 9 11/04/2003: description of the collaborative work of SARS diagnosis and the current available diagnostic tests [10]. 10 15/04/2003: summary of the epidemiology, the clinical presentation and the laboratory findings based on the first 11 cases of SARS identified in Canada [11]. 11 18/04/2003: a) description of the outbreak situation in China and of the scientific and clinical knowledge on SARS; b) update on the number of cases and on affected countries [12]. 12 25/04/2003: WHO extended its SARS-related travel advice to Beijing and Shanxi province of China and to Toronto, Canada [13]. 13 01/05/2003: a) summary of the current epidemiology of SARS in Canada; b) description of the actions that have taken place to date to manage the emerging situation in Canada [14]. 14 02/05/2003: WHO lifted its SARS-related travel advice to Toronto, Canada [15]. 15 16/05/2003: a) WHO removed Toronto from the list of areas with recent local transmission and from the list of travel advice areas; b) description of the current situation in Singapore and Hong Kong; c) WHO issued recommendations for the measures of infection control to break the chain of transmission from infected to healthy persons [16].",
