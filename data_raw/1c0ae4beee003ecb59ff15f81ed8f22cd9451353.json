Prevention and control depend on awareness and protective behaviours of the general population as well as high risk-groups. This study aims to explore the knowledge, attitudes and practices related to avian influenza among poultry workers in Nepal. Methods: The study was based on a cross-sectional study design, using a structured questionnaire administered in face-to-face interviews with 96 poultry workers age 15 and above from the Rupandehi district in Nepal. Results: The majority of respondents were male (80%), mean age was 35 (SD = 11.6). Nearly everybody was aware that AI cases had been detected in Nepal and that poultry workers were at risk for infection. The major sources of AI information were radio, TV and newspapers. Knowledge about preventive measures was high with regard to some behaviours (hand washing), but medium to low with regard to others (using cleaning and disinfecting procedures or protective clothing). Poultry workers who got their information from TV and newspapers and those who were more afraid of contracting AI had higher knowledge than those who did not. Being employed as compared to being an owner of a poultry farm as well as having a high level of knowledge was associated with practising more preventive behaviours. While on one hand many specific government control measures found a high degree of acceptance, a majority of study participants also thought that government control and compensation measures as a whole were insufficient.",

After obtaining ethical approval from Research Ethics Committee of Institute of Medicine at Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu, Nepal, face-to-face interviews with the help of a standardized questionnaire were conducted with 96 poultry workers age 15 and above from the Rupandehi district, Nepal. This district was chosen because it is one of those with the highest number of poultry farms in the country (N = 186) and was therefore considered of critical importance, but no actual cases of H5N1 had appeared in this area at the time of the study. To prepare the sampling frame a list of poultry farms in Rupandehi was obtained from the District Livestock Services Office (DLSO), which runs a registry of all farms which habitually house more than 50 chickens. From this overall district list the three village development committees (VDCs) with the highest density of poultry farms (75% of all farms in the region) were chosen. At the second stage 10 farms were randomly selected from each of the three VDCs. From each of these farms, proportional to their size, between 1 and 5 poultry workers were interviewed based on a snowballing principle. Prior to the interviews verbal informed consent was obtained from participants. Sample size estimation for the proportion estimates was based on the following assumption: For a desired width of a 95% confidence interval of w = .20, an alpha-level of p = .05, an intra-cluster correlation of r = .02 and a number of m = 30 clusters, the required number in each cluster was n = 3.5 which corresponds to an estimated sample size of 107. The actual sample size obtained from the field was slightly below the estimation i.e. N = 96.",

Awareness about avian influenza was assessed by asking whether cases of avian influenza among poultry had appeared in Nepal (yes/no). Perceptions of professional risk were measured by a question asking about whether particular professional groups such as poultry workers, butchers or health workers were at risk for contracting avian influenza (yes/no). Further, participants were asked from which sources they had obtained information about avian influenza, among them radio, TV, and newspapers. Also, they indicated how afraid they felt that they could contract avian influenza (five-pointanswering scale from \"not at all\" to \"very much\"). Knowledge about protective behaviours was assessed by an open-format question without pre-formulated answering options. Respondents were asked to name all protective measures they knew against the danger of being infected due to work with poultry, and the interviewers recorded the answers on the interview sheet. For each behaviour correctly identified one point was assigned. Afterwards study participants were asked to indicate how often they were using the following preventive measures when dealing with poultry: washing hands with soap and water, donning gloves, face masks, boots/boots covers, putting on protective body garments, and washing and disinfecting utensils and surfaces (five-step-answering format from \"always\" to \"never\"). Attitudes towards government actions were assessed by first describing current government policies and then asking whether respondents agreed with, disagreed with or felt uncertain about these approaches.",

For the model explaining knowledge age, gender, school education (primary level and lower versus higher than primary education) and occupational status (owner of poultry farm versus paid employee), use of visual mass media for health information (receiving versus not receiving health information from TV and newspapers) and degree of fear experience (scale from 1 \"not at all\" to 5 \"very much\") were entered into the equation. Knowledge was dichotomized as low level (knowing 0 to 2 protective behaviours) versus high level (knowing more than 2 behaviours). The same variables were entered into the regression for the second model testing associations with protective behaviours, which additionally included the variable \"knowledge about behaviours\" (continuous, 1-6). The maximal number of correct behaviours named was actually seven. However, as only extremely few respondents fell into this category the variable was recoded so that the last category included those who knew six and more behaviours. The number of protective behaviours used on a habitual basis (always and often) was dichotomized into low level of behaviours (maximally two behaviours practiced) versus high (more than two behaviours practiced). P-values smaller or equal to 0.05 were considered statistically significant. The analysis was performed with SPSS IBM Statistics 19.0 for Windows.",

These findings are unsurprising given that the study was conducted shortly after the first AI outbreak in Nepal but might also to some extent reflect increased governmental campaign efforts at promoting awareness after the outbreak had occurred. Also, almost everyone knew about the importance of washing hands with soap and water, which had been the main message in the campaign. This finding is in line with studies on poultry workers in other countries which similarly found hand washing to be by far the best known practice [25, 26] . Assessment of knowledge in other areas, however, unveiled distinct gaps and deficits. While still almost 70% knew about the protective capacity of gloves, only half of the sample mentioned face masks as an option and only few knew about special boots or boot covers and body suits. Also, only about one fourth named a basic procedure such as washing and disinfecting surfaces and utensils. Another study, on poultry workers in Nigeria, also reported \"low\" levels of knowledge about preventive behaviours [25] , others, however, found distinctly higher rates for knowledge about face masks, boots covers and cleaning procedures [26] than the present study did. One reason for this discrepancy might be that open-format questions like those used in the present study generate lower knowledge scores than identification tasks. Also, the finding about low knowledge about cleaning/disinfecting could be interpreted as a tendency to perceive such behaviours as routine everyday practices instead of as extraordinary precautionary measures against AI. Yet, these gaps in knowledge raise concern and suggest that future campaigns should make additional efforts to specifically target poultry workers and -beyond hand washing -focus also on the more specific behaviours which are relevant for prevention and containment of the virus at the source, i.e. on the poultry farms. Analysis of the factors which were associated with knowledge about protection showed that TV and newspapers, which carried a substantial part of the campaign messages in Nepal, played an important role. Those who received information about AI via TV and newspapers were able to name more preventive behaviours than those without that kind of exposure -an effect also reported by other studies [26, 27] . This finding certainly suggests a beneficial effect of the Nepali mass media campaign but at the same time highlights deficits in reaching groups without access to these types of media -something to be considered for future health education efforts. Another relevant factor, which was negatively associated with level of knowledge, was fear. At first glance, this seems to suggest that a higher degree of fear leads to less knowledge due to defensive processes such as not wanting to deal with the threat and therefore searching for less information. While such an explanation cannot be excluded, another mechanism is more plausible. The focus in this case was specifically on knowledge about protective behaviours, not on knowledge about AI in general, its danger potential, transmission pathways etc. While the latter type of knowledge is likely to make people aware of risks and therefore also more concerned, knowledge about effective protective behaviours might rather reduce fear by creating expectancies about successful control.",

Knowledge about effective behaviours, which was the focus of the present study, is particularly likely to enable perceptions about efficacy of behaviours which have consistently been linked to precautionary practices [12] . Nevertheless, knowledge about a threat and potential countermeasures alone will most often be insufficient to achieve behaviour change, as other factors such as economic concerns or social norms are essential for enabling or disabling such change. Yet, the findings emphasize the role of awareness-building about the availability of preventive options as a first step in generating preventive habits.",

Similar findings have been published by other studies [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] . Anticipated financial losses due to culling without sufficient compensation, lack of knowledge about how to proceed in notifying authorities, but also social considerations, such as stigma and shame might play a role and need dealing with to overcome avoidance of timely reporting [35] [36] [37] . If early notification is a key component of prevention and rapid response, trust in government actions, including compensation measures, is crucial in order to enable pervasive compliance with drastic and economically threatening actions like mass culling in an outbreak situation [34] .",

Another clear weakness is the cross-sectional study design which prohibits drawing causal conclusions about the relationships between some of the variables, such as fear and knowledge or knowledge and practices. Finally, self-report on practices are generally vulnerable to recall bias and social desirability tendencies. The face-to-face-interview situation, while enabling full response-rates on all variables as well as participation of poultry workers who lack reading or writing abilities, might have additionally heightened this type of bias in assessing attitudes and behaviours. As for attitudes, however, the very low percentage of respondents reporting compliance with notification procedures indicates that such tendencies were not pervasive.",

While it corroborates the relevance of cognitive factors, such as providing knowledge about effective protection measures, it also particularly highlights the important role of material resources which enable poultry workers in a low-resource country such as Nepal to put knowledge into practice. Beyond large-scale mass education campaigns, future efforts should focus more strongly on target-group-specific information and practical trainings with regard to protective behaviours, but might also consider subsidized social marketing of protective equipment.",
