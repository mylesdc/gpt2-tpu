            "text": "The pathogenesis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is likely mediated by disproportional immune responses and the ability of the virus to circumvent innate immunity. Using functional genomics, we analyzed early host responses to SARS-CoV infection in the lungs of adolescent cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) that show lung pathology similar to that observed in human adults with SARS. Analysis of gene signatures revealed induction of a strong innate immune response characterized by the stimulation of various cytokine and chemokine genes, including interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and IP-10, which corresponds to the host response seen in acute respiratory distress syndrome. As opposed to many in vitro experiments, SARS-CoV induced a wide range of type I interferons (IFNs) and nuclear translocation of phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 in the lungs of macaques. Using immunohistochemistry, we revealed that these antiviral signaling pathways were differentially regulated in distinctive subsets of cells. Our studies emphasize that the induction of early IFN signaling may be critical to confer protection against SARS-CoV infection and highlight the strength of combining functional genomics with immunohistochemistry to further unravel the pathogenesis of SARS.

            "text": "Infection with SARS-CoV causes lower respiratory tract disease with clinical symptoms that include fever, malaise, and lymphopenia [1] . Approximately 20%-30% of SARS patients require management in intensive care units, and the overall fatality rate has approached 10%. Interestingly, children seem to be relatively resistant to SARS, but the reason for this restriction is not known [2] [3] [4] . The clinical course of SARS follows three phases [5, 6] . In the first phase, there is active viral replication and patients experience systemic symptoms. In the second phase, virus levels start to decrease while antibodies, which are effective in controlling infection, increase. However, pneumonia and immunopathological injury also develop in this phase. Ultimately, in the third phase, fatal cases of SARS progress to severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), characterized by the presence of diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) [1, 7] . It has been hypothesized that the pathological changes are caused by a disproportional immune response, illustrated by elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, such as CXCL10 (IP-10), CCL2 (MCP-1), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-12, IL-1b, and interferon (IFN)-c [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . These in vivo data have been confirmed with in vitro experiments, demonstrating that SARS-CoV infection induces a range of cytokines and chemokines in diverse cell types [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] .",

Moreover, no IFN-a or IFN-b has been detected in the sera of SARS patients or in lungs of SARS-CoV-infected mice [23] [24] [25] . Recent in vitro studies demonstrated that type I IFN inhibition or delay may be orchestrated by SARS-CoV proteins ORF 3B, ORF 6, and N [26] . The inhibition of IFN production would benefit SARS-CoV replication, since pretreatment of cells with IFN before SARS-CoV infection efficiently prevents replication in these cells [21, [27] [28] [29] [30] . Furthermore, prophylactic treatment of macaques with pegylated IFN-a reduces SARS-CoV replication in the lungs [31] .",

In addition, most if not all virus-host response information is from clinical blood/sera samples that were taken relatively late during infection-little is known about what happens early during infection. Animal studies are of great value to decipher the host's initial innate immune response, without confounding clinical treatment (steroid and mechanical ventilation) or underlying co-morbidity. In order to elucidate early host responses during the acute phase of SARS-CoV infection, we infected cynomolgus macaques with SARS-CoV and used macaque-specific microarrays and real-time (RT)-PCR techniques to study host gene expression profiles. Adolescent cynomolgus macaques infected with SARS-CoV develop DAD similar to SARS patients, but clear most of the virus in the lungs by day 6 [7] . Because SARS-CoV replicates predominantly in the lower respiratory tract of macaques, the virus infects a range of cells, including type 1 and type 2 pneumocytes, that are different from those analyzed in vitro. The ability to simultaneously examine virus replication and host response gene expression profiles in the lungs of these animals during the acute phase of SARS offers the opportunity to further unravel the pathogenesis of SARS.",

No lesions or clinical symptoms were detected on day 1 after SARS-CoV infection, whereas on day 4, three out of four monkeys were lethargic, with one of these animals showing mildly labored breathing. Pathological changes at day 4 post infection included DAD, characterized by flooding of the alveoli with edema fluid, infiltration of neutrophils, damage to the alveolar and bronchial epithelia, and occasional type 2 pneumocyte hyperplasia, as described earlier [31] . Four mock-infected animals were included in the study to serve as a reference for host response without viral challenge and to examine outbred inter-animal variation. Our previous experience with A/ Texas/36/91 influenza virus demonstrated that viral mRNA was detected in representative samples of the lung rather than throughout the whole lung [32] . Based on this experience, the level of infection in separate lung samples was evaluated using RT-PCR. SARS-CoV mRNA was detected in all animals, and 13 pieces out of the total of 16 lung pieces from infected animals contained high levels of virus, while the three remaining pieces of lung contained very low levels of virus (;3-4 logs lower, Figure 1A) . No viral RNA could be detected in the samples from the mock-infected animals. For gene expression experiments, lung samples from SARS-CoV-infected animals were compared to a reference lung sample from mockinfected animals. The three samples with lower virus levels (1A-low, 4A-low, and 4D-low) were analyzed individually so as not to dilute the gene expression of pooled pulmonary samples with higher SARS-CoV levels and also to potentially further define pulmonary infection. Samples from animals with high viral mRNA levels showed greater gene expression changes (;2,000 genes day 1, ;800 genes day 4) compared to samples from animals with low levels of viral mRNA (;400 genes), indicating a response of lung tissue to the virus ( Figure 1B) . Additionally, the two day 1 animals showed higher numbers of differentially expressed genes than the day 4 animals. In contrast, gene expression analysis of the separate mock samples revealed limited differentially expressed genes.",

            "text": "In order to examine how gene expression would be influenced by presence of virus, timing after inoculation, and individual animal variation, global expression profiling was performed. Hierarchical clustering methods were used to order rows (genes) and columns (samples) to identify groups of genes or samples with similar expression patterns [33, 34] . These data were plotted as a heat map in which each matrix entry represents a gene expression value (Figure 2A ). Red corresponds to higher gene expression than that of the controls; green corresponds to lower gene expression. This analysis yielded 2,050 genes with day 1 samples on one side of the heat map and day 4 samples on the other side of the heat map, indicating an influence of timing after inoculation. There are two major roots to the hierarchical dendrogram, with the larger root composed of all the day 1 samples and the three day 4 samples with the highest virus levels. The smaller root is composed of the remaining day 4 samples with the lowest SARS-CoV levels. Although transcriptional profiling shows some variation when comparing samples from the same animal, the underlying gene expression is similar with a reduction in fold change in the ''low'' samples. These comparisons suggest that both individual animal variation and the ''asynchronous'' nature of the infection in the animals' lungs are factors involved in determining transcription of cellular genes. To validate that the host response from infected animals comprises a stronger transcriptional profile than individual variation from mock-infected animals, differential gene expression patterns in the separate mock samples were investigated, but only 38 genes were differentially expressed ( Figure 2B ). These results suggest that underlying basal levels of gene transcription do not confound expression levels after infection. Even in a basal state, some low-level lung-to-lung variations were identified within the same animal but not enough to disrupt segregation of lung pieces based on mock-infected animals. ",

In typical cases, largely confined to adult and elderly individuals, acute respiratory distress syndrome develops, and admission to an intensive care unit is required. Although these complications can be fatal, most SARS patients recover, suggesting that protective immune responses are operational. In this study, we simultaneously examined virus replication and host-response gene expression profiles in macaque lungs during the acute phase of SARS to gain more insight into the early events that take place after SARS-CoV infection. We show that a strong host response is induced in the lungs of SARS-CoV-infected macaques, illustrated by the induction of several pathogenic cytokines and chemokines. Interestingly, antiviral pathways are activated as well, demonstrated by the presence of phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) transcription factors throughout the lung, but not in SARS-CoV-infected cells. A subset of cells was shown to produce interferon-b, a cytokine involved in the resistance to many viral infections and able to activate STAT1. Activation of this antiviral pathway upon SARS-CoV infection may be an important escape route of the host to withstand the devastating effects of SARS-CoV. different time points after inoculation, a Venn diagram was generated with each set (circle) holding to the parameters of an absolute fold change . 2 and p , 0.0001 in at least two animals ( Figure 3A ). The day 1 set contained 1,278 genes and the day 4 set contained 950 genes. When examining host responses that were similar throughout the course of the infection, the intersection of the day 1 and day 4 sets indicates that 597 genes show shared responses. The heat map of these 597 genes is shown in Figure 3B . If more stringent criteria were used to find common responses in all six animals, using the 1,278 genes from the day 1 set and the 129 genes that are differentially expressed in all day 4 animals, a subset of 97 genes was identified. This subset included IFNstimulated genes (ISGs), like IFITs, MX1, GBP1, and G1P2, and also various chemokines and cytokines, such as CXCL10 (IP-10), CCL2 (MCP-1), IL-6, and IL-8 ( Figure S1 ). These same cytokines and chemokines have been reported to be upregulated in human SARS cases [9] [10] [11] [12] . This set also included cathepsin L (CTSL), which has been shown to be required for SARS-CoV entry into a cell [35] . Even though only 97 genes were commonly regulated in all animals, indicated with blue bars in Figure 3B , the heat map highlights that the other 500 genes show similar expression trends. Both sets of commonresponse genes showed similar functionality: cellular growth and proliferation, cell death, cellular movement, immune response, and cell-to-cell signaling.",

Many cell cycle and matrix genes indicative of tissue repair processes were also highly differentially expressed at day 4 (e.g., ANLN, AREG, CDC2, CDKN3, CKS2, FOSL1, and KIF2C). Likewise, tissue factor pathway inhibitor 2 (TFPI2), an anticoagulant, was strongly up-regulated during infection in all animals (averaging ;20-fold), as well as PLSCR1, SER-PINE1 (PAI1), and THBS1, all genes involved in procoagulation and platelet activation, were induced. Concomitant expression of TFPI2 with these pro-coagulation genes might function as an inhibitory response to restrain the activation of the coagulation pathway during acute inflammation.",

Not only IFNs, but also several IFN-responsive genes (e.g., G1P2, GBP1/2, IFI/IFITs, MX1/2, ISG20, and OAS1/2/L) were highly transcribed, showing a persistent activation of the innate immune response. Furthermore, suppressor of cytokine signaling 1(SOCS1) is induced at the onset of infection, presumably to establish negative feedback to attenuate cytokine signaling.

In the samples with low SARS-CoV mRNA levels, the induction of chemokines is less evident, suggesting that the presence of these molecules is restricted to areas in the lung where virus is present. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-infected macaques showed a stronger induction of IFNs (14 unique genes) and ISGs (20 unique genes) on day 1 than day 4 and when virus was present at high levels. Note that besides IFN-a, IFN-b, and IFN-c, the IFN-ks (IL-29, IL-28A, IL-28B), which are type I IFNs, were induced in samples with high SARS-CoV levels.

During the acute phase of human ARDS, activated neutrophils and macrophages enter the alveoli and produce a number of cytokines and chemokines such as IL-6, IL-8, and CXCL10 (IP-10) [36] , as were found in the lungs of our SARS-CoV-infected macaques.

Not only IFN-a, IFN-b, and IFNk (all type I IFNs), but also IFN-c, a type II IFN, were all highly up-regulated, especially on day 1 after infection. The expression of IFN-b, which strongly correlated to the amount of virus present, continued throughout day 4 and was confirmed using immunohistochemistry; IFN-b-positive cells could be detected in the lungs of the SARS-CoV-infected macaques. The induction of IFN-b in these SARS-CoVinfected macaques is surprising, because several reports have shown that SARS-CoV inhibits or delays type I IFN production in a number of cell types [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] 20, 22] . For example, SARS-CoV blocks a step in the activation of IRF-3, a transcription factor that is required for IFN-b induction [21] . In addition, the SARS-CoV proteins ORF3B, ORF6, and nucleocapsid have been shown to function as IFN antagonists, as has the SARS-CoV nsp1 gene that prevents the production of Sendai virus-induced IFN-b in 293 cells [26, 40] . Interestingly, it was recently shown that plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) are able to produce IFN-a and IFN-b after SARS-CoV infection, while conventional DCs did not produce these type I IFNs [41] . pDCs are known for their ability to produce very high amounts of IFN-a and IFN-b and are considered firstline sentinels in immune surveillance in the lung [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] . We speculate that the IFN-b-producing cells detected in the lungs of SARS-CoV-infected macaques are pDCs. Future studies may address the nature of these IFN-producing cells once technical difficulties in detecting pDCs in macaque tissues have been tackled. These studies may also shed light on whether decreasing numbers of pDCs observed in clinical blood samples from human SARS patients are caused by sequestering of pDCs by the lungs, destruction of pDCs by SARS-CoV, or destruction or suppression of pDCs by steroid treatment [47] .",

In vitro, SARS-CoV inhibited translocation of STAT1 to the nucleus, and phosphorylation of STAT1 was strongly reduced. However, the inhibition of STAT1 phosphorylation was not absolute because cells with low levels of phosphorylated STAT1 in their cytoplasm were also detected. In accordance with our data, Kopecky-Bromberg et al. recently showed that the SARS-CoV protein ORF6 is able to inhibit STAT1 translocation [26] . This strategy is not unique to SARS. Other viruses have been shown to be able to block signaling of IFNs by affecting phosphorylation and/or translocation of the STAT proteins. For example, measles virus V protein inhibits translocation of STAT1, but does not affect phosphorylation, whereas measles virus P protein blocks both of these processes [48] . Other paramyxoviruses, like Rinderpest virus, Nipah virus, Hendra virus, and mumps virus, as well as flaviviruses like West Nile virus and Japanese encephalitis virus, are able to block activation of STAT1 and STAT2 [49] [50] [51] [52] . Inhibition of STAT1 phosphorylation is not always complete. For example, Sendai virus suppresses tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 during the early stages of infection, but this block becomes leaky after a couple of hours with phosphorylated STAT1 accumulating in the cytoplasm [53] .",

Mice clear SARS-CoV in the absence of NK cells, T cells, or B cells, suggesting that innate immune responses are sufficient to limit SARS-CoV infection in these animals [23] . Indeed, STAT1 knock out mice, which are resistant to the effects of IFNs, to some extent show a worsening of pulmonary disease and an increase in viral replication in the lungs compared to normal mice after infection with SARS-CoV [54] . Although IFN treatment was not conducted in SARS-CoV infection mouse studies, prophylactic treatment of macaques with pegylated IFN-a protects type 1 pneumocytes from infection with SARS-CoV [31] . In addition, potent antiviral activity is observed in vitro when cells are treated with IFNs before they are infected with SARS-CoV [27, 29, 30] . Although we cannot determine the effect of neutralizing IFN-b in SARS-CoVinfected animals, based on the experiments utilizing recombinant IFNs in these animals, we postulate that type I IFNs are partly responsible for the relatively mild clinical symptoms that are seen in SARS-CoV-infected macaques. In addition, a recent study again demonstrated the importance of IFNs in viral infections, as macaques infected with the highly pathogenic and fatal 1918 influenza virus showed limited induction of type I IFNs (only IFNA4 reached fold changes . 5) and delayed induction of ISGs, while macaques infected with the low-pathogenic K173 influenza virus showed a strong induction of these antiviral molecules early during infection [55] . Notably, IFN-b was not up-regulated (absolute fold change , 2) in any of the influenza virusinfected animals, even in those animals that recovered, unlike SARS-CoV-infected macaques that showed a very strong presence of IFN-b.",

Furthermore, we show that infection of cynomolgus macaques with SARS-CoV leads to a strong immune response, including the induction of various cytokines and chemokines, resembling the host response seen in human SARS patients. Strikingly, despite the fact that SARS-CoV infection blocks the production of IFNs in vitro, type I IFNs are strongly induced in the lungs of SARS-CoV- infected macaques. The production of IFN early during infection leads to widespread activation of STAT1 and the production of ISGs. This suggests that, although SARS-CoV blocks IFN signaling in infected cells, locally produced IFNs are capable of activating non-infected cells and possibly can prevent infection of these cells. Thus, SARS-CoV infection in macaques leads to the differential activation of both pathogenic and antiviral signaling pathways in vivo, and the outcome may be determined by the relative contribution of these signaling pathways.",

Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded lung samples from SARS-CoV-infected and mock-infected macaques were stained for SARS-CoV, phosphorylated STAT1, and IFN-b using mouse-anti-SARS-nucleocapsid (Clone Ncap4, mouse IgG2b; Imgenex, http://www.imgenex.com/), mouse-anti-phospho-STAT1 (Clone ST1P-11A5, mouse IgG2a-j; Zymed Laboratories, http://www. invitrogen.com/), and rabbit-anti -IFN-b (Chemicon, http://www. chemicon.com/), respectively. After deparaffinization, antigen retrieval was performed using a citrate buffer for the SARS-CoV and STAT1 staining. No antigen retrieval was performed when staining for IFN-b. Goat-anti-mouse IgG2a HRP, goat-anti-mouse IgG2b AP (Southern Biotech, http://www.southernbiotech.com/), and anti-rabbit IgG-HRP (DAKO, http://www.dako.com/) were used as secondary antibodies.

Cells were seeded in 96-well plates and infected with SARS-CoV (MOI 0.5), and 24 h after infection, selected wells were treated with universal type I IFN (5,000 U/ml, Sigma) for 30 min at 37 8C. Subsequently, cells were fixed with 10% neutral-buffered formalin and treated with 70% ethanol. SARS-CoV-infected cells were visualized using purified human IgG from a convalescent SARS patient (CSL), followed by staining with an antibody to human IgG, linked to Alexa Fluor 594 (Invitrogen). Phosphorylated STAT1 was visualized using mouse-anti-phospho-STAT1 (Zymed), followed by staining with a FITC-linked antibody to mouse IgG. ",

Samples from SARS-CoV-infected animals that were pooled for microarray studies are indicated with circles. The three samples with lower levels of virus were hybridized separately. The 12 samples from mock-infected animals (i.e., PBS) were pooled and served as a reference sample. The number after PBS refers to the animal (i.e., PBS 1), while the number after the dash refers to the lung piece (i.e., PBS 1-1). (B) Using microarrays, gene expression in SARS-CoV-infected animals was compared to gene expression in mock-infected animals. The bar graph shows the total number of genes considered to be differentially expressed, defined as an absolute fold change . 2 with p , 0.0001. Samples 1A and 1B (day 1) and 4A-4D (day 4) are composed of the pooled individual pulmonary samples shown in (A). Samples 1A low, 4A low, and 4B low are the outliers from (A).
