In the human immunodeficiency lentivirus 1 (HIV-1), dynamic G4s are located in the unique viral LTR promoter. Folding of HIV-1 LTR G4s inhibits viral transcription; stabilization by G4 ligands intensifies this effect. Cellular proteins modulate viral transcription by inducing/unfolding LTR G4s. We here expanded our investigation on the presence of LTR G4s to all lentiviruses. G4s in the 5\u2032-LTR U3 region were completely conserved in primate lentiviruses. A G4 was also present in a cattleinfecting lentivirus. All other non-primate lentiviruses displayed hints of less stable G4s. In primate lentiviruses, the possibility to fold into G4s was highly conserved among strains. LTR G4 sequences were very similar among phylogenetically related primate viruses, while they increasingly differed in viruses that diverged early from a common ancestor. A strong correlation between primate lentivirus LTR G4s and Sp1/NF\u03baB binding sites was found. All LTR G4s folded: their complexity was assessed by polymerase stop assay. Our data support a role of the lentiviruses 5\u2032-LTR G4 region as control centre of viral transcription, where folding/unfolding of G4s and multiple recruitment of factors based on both sequence and structure may take place.",

G4s are nucleic acids secondary structures that may form in single-stranded G-rich sequences under physiological conditions [11] [12] [13] . Four Gs bind via Hoogsteen-type hydrogen bonds base-pairing to yield G-quartets, which stack to form the G4. The presence of K + cations specifically supports G4 formation and stability [14] [15] [16] . In eukaryotes G4s have been shown to be involved in key regulatory roles, including transcriptional regulation of gene promoters and enhancers, translation, chromatin epigenetic regulation, DNA recombination 9, 13, [17] [18] [19] . Expansion of G4-forming motifs has been associated with relevant human neurological disorders [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] . Formation of G4s in vivo has been consolidated by the discovery of cellular proteins that specifically recognize G4s 27, 28 and the development of G4-specific antibodies 29, 30 .",

Our data indicate the 5\u2032-LTR G4 region as a crucial control centre for viral transcription that was maintained during evolution of lentiviruses.",

To check if the G4 forming region observed in the 5\u2032-LTR of the HIV-1 provirus was a conserved feature of lentiviruses, we investigated the presence of putative G4 forming sequences (PQS) in the LTRs of all known lentiviruses. The viruses belonging to the lentivirus genus can be grouped according to their 5 host types. The primate group, which our reference HIV-1 group M belongs to, comprises viruses that naturally infect both human (HIV-1 and HIV-2) and non-human primates (Simian Immunodeficiency Virus, SIV) mainly belonging to the Cercopithecidae family 44 . The SIV sub-group is the most abundant and composed of viruses isolated from 41 different primate species. Among these, 29 SIV genomes that include the entire LTR region are available: these were considered in our analysis ( Fig. 1 and Supporting Table S1 ). The ovine-caprine group includes 3 viruses: Visna/Maedi virus, Caprine Arthritis Encephalitis Virus (CAEV) and Ovine Lentivirus (OL); the bovine group consists of Bovine Immunodeficiency Virus (BIV) and Jembrana Disease Virus (JDV); the equine group is represented by Equine Infectious Anemia Virus (EIAV); the feline group comprises Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV) that naturally infects members of the Felidae family (Supporting Table S1 ).",

In fact, the LTR PQSs of these viruses were all characterized by 4-6 tracts of 3 or more Gs, with additional GG tracts and interspersed Gs.

The JDV PQS also partially overlapped with a NF\u03baB binding site at its 3\u2032 end (Table 1 ).

Since Sp1 binding sites for only a very few viruses are available in the literature, the establishment of a straightforward correlation between LTR G4s and Sp1 was not possible. We thus used the online software PhysBinder 48 to predict Sp1 binding regions in the LTR of all lentiviruses with relevant PQSs. In the primate lentiviruses, 30 out of 32 subgroups displayed Sp1 binding sites that overlapped with the PQS (Table 1) . HIV-1 N and SIVwrc were two exceptions: the former was the only genome that displayed three NF\u03baB binding sites overlapping with the PQS and no Sp1 binding site; the latter was the only genome that lacked both NF\u03baB and Sp1 binding sites.

Because the identified PQGs were quite diverse among viruses infecting different hosts, with the few exceptions highlighted above, we checked the level of sequence identity/variation among lentiviruses that occurred during evolution. To this end, we built a phylogenetic tree based on the alignment of the pol gene sequence of lentiviruses. The pol sequence-based tree was chosen because it displayed higher bootstrap support than the LTR-based tree: it showed some minor differences in the branching order with the LTR-based tree, but it correctly grouped the non-primate lentiviruses outside the primate group 52 and resulted consistent with previously reported phylogenetic analysis 53 . This phylogenetic analysis confirmed that the host-based groups ( Fig. 1 and Supporting Table S1) were correctly assigned since phylogenetically divergent. . GGG tracts are shown in red and bold; bulged tracts (e.g. GXGG that do not overlap with adjacent GGG tracts) are shown in red, bold and italics. Lower case letters that specify the SIV strain refer to the simian type they were first identified from (e.g. SIVcpz from chimpanzee or Pan troglodytes troglodytes, SIVsm from sooty mangabey monkey or Cercocebus atys). A complete list of PQS in all lentiviruses along with references and host species is provided in Supporting Table S1 . The primate group, comprising our reference virus HIV-1 group M (symbol * in Fig. 3 ), included viruses that naturally infect both human (HIV-1 and HIV-2) and non-human primates (SIVs). An interesting feature here was the crossover of HIV and SIV lineages that indicates multiple cross-species transmission from simian to humans: in particular, SIVcpz from chimpanzee or Pan troglodytes troglodytes was the most closely related to HIV-1 group M, whereas SIVsm from sooty mangabey monkey or Cercocebus atys was closer to HIV-2 54 . HIV-1 groups M and N originated from independent jumps from chimpanzee 55 and HIV-1 group O from the western gorilla subspecies Gorilla gorilla 56 , resulting in HIV-1 strains with very different pathogenic potential: HIV-1 group M causes the well-known AIDS pandemic, groups N and O cause a milder disease and have been limited to a few individuals mostly in Cameroon 57, 58 . This phylogenetic analysis on one hand further supports the central role of G4 formation in the LTR, since this feature was maintained in multiple and unrelated cross-species transmission from a simian ancestor strain, and it explains why all primate lentiviruses display PQSs in the same LTR U3 region; on the other it gives reason of the substantial differences in PQS among strains.",

The chosen sequences were investigated in the absence/presence of K + to establish G4 formation, and in the presence of the G4 ligand BRACO-19 (200 nM) to assess ligand-induced G4 formation, which has been reported in the case of HIV-1 group M 9 . In the presence of K + and BRACO-19, premature stop sites appeared in most of the selected PQSs (Fig. 4a) and corresponded to the most 3\u2032-G-tract involved in G4 formation (Fig. 4b) . In all cases, G4-specific stops were more pronounced in the presence of the G4 ligand (compare lanes + with lanes B in Fig. 4a ) indicating that these G4s can be stabilized and in some cases induced by specific G4 ligands, consistently with previously reported data 9 . Sequences where no G4-related stops were obtained during the Taq polymerase elongation step at 47 \u00b0C, i.e. HIV N and SIVwrc (Fig. 4a) , were further analysed at elongation at 37 \u00b0C to solve thermodynamically less stable secondary structures. In these conditions, these two sequences folded in G4s as well, as indicated by specific stops at the main G-tracts (Fig. 4a,b) . Only SIVlhoest PQS folded in a unique G4 species, while all other tested sequences folded in 2 or 3 different G4s (Fig. 4a,b) . Interestingly, PQSs of HIV-1 group M and SIVcpz not only were similar in terms of number of G-runs (Fig. 1 , Table 1 and Supporting Table S1 ), conserved (Fig. 2 ) and phylogenetically related (Fig. 3 ), but were both also able to fold in 3 very similar and mutually exclusive G4 structures (Fig. 4a) . Indeed, the predicted G4 species of SIVcpz fully coincided with those of HIV-1 group M 9, 43 (Fig. 4b) . PQSs in the 5\u2032-LTR of HIV-1 group O and group N were also able to fold in G4 even if HIV-1 group N G4s were probably less stable because they could be visualized only at the lower Taq polymerase elongation temperature. Unfortunately, it was not possible to investigate SIVgor G4s by Taq Polymerase Stop assay because an extremely stable premature stop that did not correspond to a G4 structure was present (Fig. 4a,b) . This stop was probably due to a hairpin-like secondary structure with 10 base pairs, as predicted by a web-based DNA tool (https://www.idtdna.com/calc/analyzer). As for viruses in the SIVsm/HIV-2 lineage, the behaviour of HIV-2, SIVmac and SIVsm G4s were extremely similar and in accordance to their relatedness in terms of sequence (Fig. 1) and evolutionary history (Fig. 3) : they could effectively fold in at least two different G4s, the major one of which was located at the 3\u2032-end of the sequence (Fig. 4b) and mainly induced by the addition of BRACO-19 (Fig. 4a ).",

The LTR G4s are also evolutionary related: on one hand the most similar LTR G4 regions (i.e. HIV-1 group M and SIVcpz, HIV-2 and SIVmac/SIVsm) belong to viruses that are phylogenetically the closest; on the other, LTR G4s in primate lentiviruses, while sharing the possibility to form G4, are diverse in sequence, possibly because of the early divergence of the different lineages from a common ancestor (Fig. 3) .",

In general, however, these latter G-rich regions form low complexity G4s, in contrast to primate G4s that are multiple, overlapping and thus mutually exclusive 9 . We have suggested that the HIV-1 group M LTR G4 complexity is necessary for the tuning of G4 modulation: in particular, initial evidence indicated that the least stable HIV-1 G4, LTR-IV, may be required to release the inhibitory activity of the most stable HIV-1 G4, LTR-III 43 . It is thus possible that the primate LTR G4s are more evolutionary progressed and control viral transcription in a G4-based high-complexity mechanism.",

Sp1 is a ubiquitous transcription factor that has been shown to be the main driver of HIV-1 basal transcription through binding to the three sites in the U3 region of the 5\u2032-LTR 60 . Beside the duplex, Sp1 is able to bind DNA in its G4 conformation, both in eukaryotic cells 61 and HIV-1 8 . Our data are in line with the previously reported association between G4s and Sp1 binding sites in human genes 62 . The reported suppression of viral gene expression when Sp1 binding to the HIV-1 5\u2032-LTR is disrupted by cellular proteins or gene editing 63, 64 may further support a key role played by G4s as regulatory elements of viral transcription.",

In HIV-1 group M, we have previously shown that the sequence comprising NF\u03baB, which could in principle fold into an additional overlapping G4, does not fold in vitro in the presence of K + or G4 ligands 9 . Considering the degree of conservation of this sequence just upstream of the Sp1 binding sites and the G4 folding region, we suggest two possibilities: i) the recruitment of NF\u03baB is necessary for processes that occur at the downstream G4 region; ii) there are additional cellular factors that induce G4 folding at this region. The former hypothesis is supported by the reported interaction of NF\u03baB and Sp1 in an orientation and position-dependent manner 65 , which, based on our present observations, may rely on G4 folding/unfolding equilibria. The latter hypothesis is supported by the observation that nucleolin, the major reported LTR G4 binding protein 27 , preferentially binds regions that form low stability G4s 66 . The effect of G4-inducing proteins is expected to be more pronounced in less intrinsically stable G4s regions, such as the NF\u03baB binding site, and thus biologically more significant.",

KCl-treated samples were further incubated with the G4 ligand BRACO-19 (B). Oligonucleotides were used as templates in a Taq polymerase reaction at 47 \u00b0C or 37 \u00b0C as indicated. Symbols * indicate premature stop site at G bases in gel images (a) and in the corresponding G4 sequences (b). Symbols ^ indicate stop sites independent of G4 folding. G-bases are shown in bold.
