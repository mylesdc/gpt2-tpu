However, few membrane autoantigens have been linked with Beh\u00e7et's disease. Here, a cell-chip was performed to identify autoantibody target cells, and the suspected autoantigens were detected using immunoblotting. The amino acid sequences of the detected proteins were determined using LC-MALDI-TOF/TOF. Putative proteins were recombinantly expressed and purified, and a corresponding ELISA was developed and clinically validated using real clinical samples. It was found that a 36-kDa membrane protein -annexin A2 -was detected in approximately one-third of the patients' blood circulation. The immunohistochemistry results showed that annexin A2 was highly expressed in vascular endothelial cells. Moreover, vascular involvement was significantly higher in the anti-annexin A2 antibody-positive group versus the anti-annexin A2 antibody-negative group among all the clinical samples analyzed, indicating that annexin A2 is a novel endothelial cell membrane antigen involved in Beh\u00e7et's disease.

Similar to other classical autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Sjogren syndrome (SS) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA), BD also exhibits a diversity of clinical manifestations, indicating the co-existence of a large number of autoantigens 4, 5 . In fact, efforts by other groups have led to the successful identification of some autoantigens, including the retinal S-antigen, IRBP, HSP70, a-tropomyosin, SBP, Mtch1, and annexin V [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] .",

Thus, scientists have emphasized the importance of endothelial cells and AECAs in the pathogenesis of BD. In the past decade, a-enolase and hnRNP-A2/B1 were successively identified in human dermal microvascular endothelial cells as self-antigens of BD 14, 15 . Sip-1 and RLIP-76 were identified in human microvascular endothelial cells 16, 17 , and kinectin was identified as a candidate autoantigen of BD in a bovine aortic endothelial cell line 18 . Prohibitin was also identified as a new endothelial cell autoantigen in our laboratory very recently using different systems biotechnology methods 19 . We believe that the combinatorial use of multiple high-throughput technologies might reveal new insight into the basic biology of autoimmune diseases, as multiplexed assay technologies at the molecular and cellular levels have enabled the identification of new biomarkers 20, 21 .",

It is involved in several important biological processes, such as exocytosis and endocytosis, cell cycle regulation and immunoglobulin transport 27 . Annexin A2 overexpression has been described in many cancers, including liver, lung and kidney cancers 28 . This protein might play an important role in tumor cell proliferation and in the regulation of migration 29 , and it was identified as a vascular endothelial cell plasminogen receptor and plasminogen activator 30 on the cell surface. Annexin A2 also plays a pivotal role in the process of thrombosis for antiphospholipid syndrome through mediating endothelial cell activation by anti-b2 glycoprotein antibodies 31 . Furthermore, deregulation of annexin A2 expression in acute promyelocytic leukemia is an important mechanism for bleeding diathesis 32 . Recent studies have indicated that annexin A2 may be a target for autoantibodies in SLE, SS, RA, and systemic vasculitis, and it has been hypothesized that anti-annexin A2 antibodies can induce thrombosis by activating endothelial cells and inhibiting plasmin generation [32] [33] [34] . Furthermore, another member of annexins has already been described, the serum anti-annexin V antibodies were significantly higher in neuro-BD patients compared to those without 11 . The homology analysis indicated that amino acid sequence of human annexin A2 protein had about 43% identity with annexin V. Our results related to the reactivity of anti-annexin A2 In this study, annexin A2 was suggested to be a novel membrane autoantigen for BD and may be involved in the process of capillary injury during BD process. When comparing the clinical information between the anti-annexin A2 antibody-positive andnegative groups, vascular involvement was four times higher in the anti-annexin A2 antibody-positive group, indicating that annexin A2 may have a close relationship with vascular inflammation and damage.",

            "text": "A number of studies have shown that annexin A2 plays a role as a pathogenic receptor [35] [36] [37] , and most researchers believe that BD is related to infection by microorganisms. Sometimes, HSV (herpes simplex virus) considered being involved with the disease and the anti-HSV antibodies can be detected in the circulation serum of BD patients 38 . Streptococcus sanguis (S. sanguis) mainly inhabits the mucous membrane of the colon, mouth and throat, and the role of these organisms in BD immunopathogenesis has been reported [39] [40] [41] . The HSP65 of S. sanguis that is detected in the sera of BD patients is highly homologous with human HSP60 41 . Additionally, it was demonstrated that there is cross-reactivity between the antibodies from BD patient sera and S. sanguis or recombinant peptides of HSP65 from S. sanguis 42, 43 . HSP60 can also elicit an immune response in humans, a response that although directed primarily against the microbial molecule 44 , providing a link between infection and pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, as suggested for arthritis [45] [46] [47] and multiple sclerosis 48, 49 . Moreover, the expression of certain cytokines is up-or down-regulated after infection in BD patients. For example, some inflammatory factors, including IL-8 and TNF-a were up-regulated and IL-12 are down-regulated in patients with BD 50 , an increased level of IFN-c was also observed in our patients with BD (data not shown).",
