At designated periods, leukocyte antigen positive platelets, platelet antigen positive leukocytes and cell-derived MV were quantified by flow cytometry. Numbers of platelet-or leukocyte-derived MV did not increase within one hour following in vitro exposure of blood to LPS. However, with LPS stimulation numbers of platelets staining positive for both platelet-and leukocyte-specific antigens increased in blood derived from WT but not dTLR4 mice. This effect was blocked by inhibition of TLR4 signaling mediated by My88 and TRIF. Seven days after a single intravenous injection of LPS (500 ng/mouse or 20 ng/gm body wt) to WT mice, none of the platelets stained for leukocyte antigen. However, granulocytes, monocytes and apoptotic bodies stained positive for platelet antigens.",

            "text": "Acute and chronic infection, especially that induced by Gramnegative bacteria is associated with increased risk of thrombosis and atherosclerotic disease [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] . Little is known about the underlying cellular mechanisms responsible for these risks. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a component of the cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria, is an antigen which initiates inflammation and innate immune responses by interacting with Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). TLR4 is expressed on the surface of cells, including leukocytes and platelets [6, 7, 8] . Under physiological conditions, platelets and leukocytes circulate in quiescent state and do not interact with each other. However, once activated under pathophysiological conditions such as those associated with infection, platelets change shape, secrete prothrombogenic inflammatory and cellular adhesion molecules from alpha-and densegranules which cause the platelets to adhere to each other or to leukocytes and/or vascular endothelium [9, 10, 11, 12] . The physiological consequences of stimuli associated with infection, like LPS stimulation, are acute but can be sustained. For example, half-life of platelets was shortened and the activation state of newly formed platelets from bone marrow megakaryocytes increased within seven days following a single acute intravenous injection of LPS in mice [13, 14] . However, cellular events, specifically those occurring among blood elements, contributing to the shortened half-life and increased activation state of platelets remains to be clarified.",

However, this explanation does not address how the production of inflammatory cytokines might proceed nor does it identity the cell types which are targets for the LPS stimulation. Platelets may represent one of the first blood borne elements to react to LPS stimulation as changes in platelet reactivity via TLR4 seems to occur prior to sustained changes in circulating levels of cytokines [14] . Alternatively, comparable activation of leukocyte as well as platelet result in formation of cell-derived microvesicles (MV) which may contribute to increased thrombogenic propensity of the blood, pro-inflammatory immune processes and thus cardiovascular risk [15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22] . Clarifying the interactions of these blood elements (platelets and leukocytes) in the setting of TLR4 activation might provide insight into how infection initiates or facilitates progression of cardiovascular disease.",

These cell-derived vesicles are an interface of activation between cellular components of the blood with the vascular wall and between soluble components of the blood associated with immunity including response to infection [24, 28, 29] . For example, phosphatidylserine (PS) on the surface of MV provides catalytic sites for prothrombinase complex to generate thrombin needed for the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin in formation of clots [25, 30, 31] . Furthermore, exposure of diluted blood to LPS in vitro increased production of platelet-derived as well as tissue factor positive MV within 3 to 6 hours [32, 33, 34] . While those experiments provide evidence that LPS modulates platelet activation, they do not provide any insight about the interactions of platelet with other blood elements within the earliest stages of activation especially at time points prior to the period when measurable changes in circulating cytokines are observed in vivo [14] . Therefore, the present study was designed to test the hypothesis that acute exposure to a sentinel dose of LPS would induce MV production and exchange of specific proteins/ receptors between platelets and leukocytes via TLR4 activation. MV transport of biologically active cell contents including cell surface receptors among cells were identified using antibodies specific for cell antigens (i.e. CD41 or CD45, which is platelet-or leukocyte-specific antigens respectively) [24] ; MV derived from platelets and/or leukocytes were distinguished by cell specific fluorescein conjugated antigen staining using calibrated flow cytometry.",

Each gate was verified using cell specific antibodies (CD11b for granulocytes, CD14 for monocytes and CD3 for T-lymphocytes and CD19 for B-lymphocytes.

This study demonstrates the acute, immediate interaction of platelets and leukocytes after incubation of whole blood with a sentinel dose of LPS through TLR4 signaling. Exchange of antigens and associations of specific cell-derived MV among cells is a mechanism for the transfers signaling molecules to specific cells. For example, MV derived from neutrophils induced platelet activation by binding to platelets GP1ba (Glycoprotein 1b a) via activated a M b 2 on MV [38] , while platelet-derived MV mediate leukocyte-leukocyte aggregation, activate leukocyte phagocytic properties and amplify leukocyte-mediated tissue injury in thrombotic and inflammatory disorders [39] . Results from the present study demonstrate that the number of platelets positive for leukocyte antigen increased within 60 min of exposure to LPS. This increase was not accompanied by increased expression of PS on cell or MV surface. Because expression of the leukocyte antigen on platelets was defined using the platelet size gate and platelet specific marker CD41 on the flow cytometry, larger leukocytes would be excluded. Therefore, these leukocyte antigens may represent a membrane exchange during platelet-leukocyte adhesion or adhesion of leukocyte-derived MV to the platelets. The half-life of whole platelet-leukocyte aggregates may be shorter and therefore, we did not determine whole platelet-leukocyte aggregates in this study.",

Prior to LPS application, platelet aggregates (of more than 5 platelets) were absent, and most platelets were discoid shaped (Left panels). At 30 and 60 minutes incubation with saline, platelet morphology did not change (Top panels); whereas, large aggregates of irregularly-shaped platelets were observed in those incubated with LPS (bottom panels, inset shows platelets with pseudopodia).

LPS activates both MyD88 and TRIF pathways, which are important in the TLR4 mediated intracellular signaling [42] . The acute effects of LPS on platelet and leukocyte activation were most likely mediated through activation of TLR4 as platelet positive leukocyte antigen was not observed in blood from dTLR4 mice. Furthermore, leukocyte antigen expression on platelet was reduced by inhibition of MyD88-and TRIF-dependent pathways alone or in combination. These signaling pathways may be potential molecular targets to inhibit infection/inflammation induced interactions among formed elements in the blood.",

Although in vivo interaction of plateletand leukocyte-aggregates with the vascular wall could stimulate or exacerbate proinflammatory immune responses [43, 44] , the half-life of these cell aggregates is not known. A significant finding of the present in vivo study is that leukocytes sustain or retain platelet antigen seven days after an in vivo injection of LPS. This time point corresponds to turnover of the platelet pool and is consistent with observations that changes in platelet half-life and increases in platelet turnover are dependent on the concentration of agonist, i.e. LPS, activation [13, 14] . Quantification of dual-positive events is usually not considered in studies of cellular or MV quantification with LPS stimulation. Results from the present study, therefore, suggest that platelet-leukocyte antigen could be used as an additional biomarker of cellular activation for diagnostic or prognostic purposes in settings of sub-clinical or asymptomatic exposures to infective agents.",

Furthermore, peptide inhibitors of TLR4 signaling molecules blocked the interaction. These events occur within 1 hour after the initial exposure to LPS.
