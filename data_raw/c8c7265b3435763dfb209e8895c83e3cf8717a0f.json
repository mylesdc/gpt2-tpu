            "text": "Background: Emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases are a significant public health concern, and early detection and immediate response is crucial for disease control. These challenges have led to the need for new approaches and technologies to reinforce the capacity of traditional surveillance systems for detecting emerging infectious diseases. In the last few years, the availability of novel web-based data sources has contributed substantially to infectious disease surveillance. This study explores the burgeoning field of web-based infectious disease surveillance systems by examining their current status, importance, and potential challenges. Methods: A systematic review framework was applied to the search, screening, and analysis of web-based infectious disease surveillance systems. We searched PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase databases to extensively review the English literature published between 2000 and 2015. Eleven surveillance systems were chosen for evaluation according to their high frequency of application. Relevant terms, including newly coined terms, development and classification of the surveillance systems, and various characteristics associated with the systems were studied. Results: Based on a detailed and informative review of the 11 web-based infectious disease surveillance systems, it was evident that these systems exhibited clear strengths, as compared to traditional surveillance systems, but with some limitations yet to be overcome. The major strengths of the newly emerging surveillance systems are that they are intuitive, adaptable, low-cost, and operated in real-time, all of which are necessary features of an effective public health tool. The most apparent potential challenges of the web-based systems are those of inaccurate interpretation and prediction of health status, and privacy issues, based on an individual's internet activity. Conclusion: Despite being in a nascent stage with further modification needed, web-based surveillance systems have evolved to complement traditional national surveillance systems. This review highlights ways in which the strengths of existing systems can be maintained and weaknesses alleviated to implement optimal web surveillance systems.",

            "text": "Despite medical advances and increased vaccine availability, emerging and re-emerging epidemics continue to pose tremendous threats, based on reported cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome, influenza A (H1N1), avian flu, Ebola virus, and the recent Middle East respiratory syndrome [1] . To avoid the repercussions of an epidemic, early detection and immediate response are emphasized to manage infectious diseases. Many online surveillance systems that function based on real-time data have been developed involving a wide range of technologies and data sources to prevent the occurrence of infectious diseases; these systems are continually being added to and evaluated [2] . Traditional passive surveillance systems typically rely on data submitted to the relevant public health authority by various healthcare providers [3] . This process is often expensive and inefficient, as substantial delays between an event and notifications are common, resulting in an incomplete account of disease emergence. Such limitations of traditional surveillance systems are a shared concern worldwide. The Internet has revolutionized efficient health-related communication and epidemic intelligence [4] . The increased frequency of Internet use for acquiring health information has contributed to the rise of web-based early detection systems for infectious diseases through various methodologies [5] . The principal concept is that diseaserelated information is retrieved from a wide range of available real-time electronic data sources, which play critical roles in the identification of early events and situational preparedness by offering current, highly local information about outbreaks, even from remote areas that have been unapproachable by traditional global public health efforts [6] . These systems not only monitor and predict disease outbreaks but also provide a user interface, and aid in visualization for an easier understanding and maneuvering of the operation. These new systems for early detection of epidemics are still in the nascent stage, but the concept and relevant promising mechanisms have been adopted and tested by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) with positive indications for efficiency and feasibility [7] . In fact, several web-based surveillance systems are affiliated with the CDC from which they are granted funding and technical assistance [8] .",

It is of great importance to discuss the possible directions in which these new surveillance systems are headed in the context of public health by thoroughly examining areas of improvement for such systems. In addition, the absence of a system for predicting and monitoring epidemics in some countries with strong information communications technology (ICT) capability should command the attention of their national public health sectors, as there is an imminent need to implement such a mechanism. The objective of this systematic review was to investigate well-established web-based infectious disease surveillance systems that focus on infectious disease occurrence and the early detection of outbreaks. Our investigation can serve as an overview and starting point for readers interested in the topic and as a useful reference for the design of prospective infectious disease surveillance systems in countries that lack such tools.",

However, it has been operated by the International Society for Infectious Diseases since 1999 [21] . Subsequently, the World Health Organization (WHO) established an effectively organized infrastructure called the Global Outbreak Alert Response Network (GOARN) for the very first time, which served as a \"network of technical partners and other networks with the capacity and expertise to contribute to an international coordinated response to outbreaks of epidemic-prone and novel infectious diseases\" [22] .",

Moreover, some Internet-based surveillance systems have been selected to be part of a national security system and are managed at the national level. Such a phenomenon is most often apparent in developed countries, as in the United States and Sweden. CDC funds feasible and effective surveillance systems to enhance the technical aspect, and the Generating Epidemiological Trends from Web Logs, Like (GET WELL) system has been officially accepted by the Swedish government and is in regular use at the Swedish Institute for Infectious Disease Control, providing a complementary aid to the daily surveillance performed by epidemiologists [24] .

Figure 3 shows the classification of standard disease surveillance systems. Event-based surveillance systems are based on the organized, rapid capture, and reporting of information about outbreaks or events that can be a risk to public health [25] [26] [27] . However, rather than relying on official reports, this information is retrieved directly from witnesses of real-time events or indirectly from reports transmitted through various communication channels, such as social media, and information channels including news media and public health networks [28] . A great deal of attention from the public, and media interest, are associated with an epidemic [29, 30] . Health information monitored via the Internet and social media is a pivotal part of event-based surveillance and is most often the source emphasized by many existing surveillance systems [18] . Event-based disease surveillance systems can be classified into three main categories of news aggregators, automatic systems, and moderated systems. Moderated systems function so that information is processed by human analysts or is processed automatically before being analyzed by human analysts [31, 32] . These systems screen for epidemiological relevance of the data extracted within the information prior to being presented to the user [26] . Examples of this system include ProMED-Mail, GPHIN, GOARN, and Bio-Caster. The process by which automatic systems collect data is complex; it adds a series of steps for analysis, but differs in the levels of analysis performed as well as in the scope of information sources, language coverage, speed of delivery, and visualization methods. EpiSPIDER, Health-Map, EpiSimS, MedISys, and GETWELL are examples of automatic systems [33] [34] [35] . Finally, news aggregators include Google Flu Trends, which collect reports and articles from sources screened by language or country; by such means users can easily access many sources via a common portal but they are required to view each article individually [26] .",

These changes were sufficient to spark integration between the ICT and public health issues, leading to the rise of web-based disease surveillance systems. The first systems were regarded as pilot trials at the exploratory level, and were often based at, or in cooperation with, universities or institutions (BioCaster, HealthMap, and GETWELL), non-governmental organizations (GOARN, MedISys, and ProMED-Mail) and a few governmental agencies (EpiSPIDER and GPHIN). Since the initiation of these web-based surveillance systems as trial programs, many have evolved and become renowned over the past few years. Several general trends are observed among the characteristics of the 11 web-based surveillance systems. Most of the web-based surveillance systems were first developed in North America, particularly the United States, with abundant infrastructure and technological resources, when integration of ICT and syndromic surveillance for early detection and response to diseases was at a preliminary phase. As time progressed, other regions, such as Asia and Europe, have caught up by launching similar but distinct web-based surveillance systems, spreading the notion of early detection of disease outbreaks by real-time scanning and collecting, and analyzing unstructured information from diverse internet sources [62] . English was the only language in service in the earlier systems but, subsequently, the collection and analysis of data began to be published in different languages based on the service area. The scope of data sources has also expanded as newer surveillance systems extract information not just from secondary news reports but also from social media, web search queries, and various organizations such as the CDC, Central Intelligence Agency, and the WHO.",

            "text": "However, the new Internet-based surveillance systems are not without limitations, thereby provoking skepticism. First, due to the unstructured nature of the data sources, interpreting the information may require highly complex techniques to effectively implement the system initially [69] . The recent closure of Google Flu Trend was partially due to its failure to provide a swift and accurate account of flu outbreaks [70] . Although the quantity of information was thought to be reliable for monitoring and predicting the occurrence of a flu outbreak, the lack of methodological transparency for data extraction, processing, and analysis led to inaccurate prediction in detecting an influenza outbreak [71] . Second, Internet use and health-seeking behavior vary among individuals, and between different sectors of the community and environment. Thus, the limited environments in which these tools are useful must be considered along with the demographics of the population [72] . Large discrepancies occur between availability of the Internet and active seeking of healthcare information that account for unequal use and access [73, 74] . Third, data sharing permits more and better quality data to be used to monitor public health and potential outbreaks [75] . However, use of data with precise information connected to individuals could be a privacy concern. Careful and appropriate decisions need to be made to avoid any further privacy intrusion on personal information. Last, forecasting health and disease-related phenomena is very likely to provoke accuracy issues because health fluctuates in every individual, and how people perceive their health status is very subjective. Although monitoring trends in disease outbreaks and health outcomes is possible, forecasting them is subject to false predictions. Thus, data sources must be evaluated extensively, particularly to identify gaps in coverage and false decisions [76] . The expectation now is that the accuracy of these systems will be enhanced through iterative procedures and that the scope of search-term surveillance will be more inclusive to other diseases [69] . The precedent of the Google Flu Trend failure illustrates the importance of a balance between traditional data and big data to maintain these systems. It is probable that future challenges will remain with regard to data integration, compatibility issues, and evaluating surveillance systems, all of which are underdeveloped and lacking in the current research. More research addressing these issues will be necessary.",

Repercussions of the language barrier issue will likely affect the accuracy of detecting an outbreak. Several language-related intricacies, including cultural tone, language shifts, and the use of colloquialisms [3] are factors that cannot be easily recognized by technical aspects of web-based surveillance systems as opposed to traditional, conventional surveillance systems maneuvered by human analysts. This is another reason why data accuracy might be heavily affected and constitutes an area for improvement.",
