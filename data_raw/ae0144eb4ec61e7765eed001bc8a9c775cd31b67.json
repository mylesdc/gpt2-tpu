            "text": "Taiwan had been free of indigenous human and animal rabies case since canine rabies was eliminated in 1961. In July 2013, rabies was confirmed among three wild ferret-badgers, prompting public health response to prevent human rabies cases. This descriptive study reports the immediate response to the reemergence of rabies in Taiwan. Response included enhanced surveillance for human rabies cases by testing stored cerebrospinal fluids (CSF) from patients with encephalitides of unknown cause by RT-PCR, prioritizing vaccine use for postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) during periods of vaccine shortage and subsequent expansion of PEP, surveillance of animal bites using information obtained from vaccine application, roll out of preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with vaccine stock restoration, surveillance for adverse events following immunization (AEFI), and ensuring surge capacity to respond to general public inquiries by phone and training for healthcare professionals. Enhanced surveillance for human rabies found no cases after testing 205 stored CSF specimens collected during rabies PEP application; 6,634 (80.5%) were consistent with recommendations. Among the 6,501persons who received at least one dose of rabies vaccine postexposure, 4,953 (76.2%) persons who were bitten by dogs; only 59 (0.9%) persons were bitten by ferret-badgers. During the study period, 6,247 persons received preexposure prophylaxis. There were 23 reports of AEFI; but no anaphylaxis, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, or acute disseminated encephalomyelitis were found. During the study period, there were 40,312 calls to the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control hotline, of which, 8,692 (22%) were related to rabies. Recent identification of rabies among ferret-badgers in a previously rabies-free country prompted rapid response. To date, no human rabies has been identified. Continued multifaceted surveillance and interministerial collaboration are crucial to achieve the goal of rabies-free status in Taiwan.",

Three dead ferret-badgers with unexplained encephalitides found in central Taiwan during May to December 2012 underwent a series of diagnostic tests, eventually tested positive for rabies virus by RT-PCR on June 24, 2013. The specimens were submitted to COA on June 26 for confirmatory testing. On July 16, COA confirmed rabies in these three ferret-badgers based on positive RT-PCR, DFA, and IHC results [1] . Of the 827 dead or behaviorally abnormal ferret-badgers collected during July 16 to December 27, 2013, rabies was confirmed by DFA in 273 animals found in central, southern and eastern Taiwan (Fig 1) [10] . In addition, COA confirmed rabies in a house shrew on July 30 and in a dog bitten by a rabid ferret-badger on September 10 [11] . Furthermore, three laboratory-confirmed rabies cases were found after testing 11 stored ferret-badger brain specimens collected during July 2010 to August 2012 [12] .",

Rabies surveillance mandates physicians to notify clinically suspected cases to the health authority within 24 hours of diagnosis and submit clinical specimens including saliva, serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to Taiwan Rabies Reemergence Public Health Response TCDC laboratories. Rabies is confirmed if any of the specimens tested positive for rabies virus by diagnostic RT-PCR targeting both L and N genes of Rabies virus [16] . PCR products were sequenced in both directions to characterize the rabies amplicon. In addition, specific antirabies antibody testing by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [17] was performed in unvaccinated individuals. In addition, TCDC has conducted sentinel surveillance of human encephalitis of undetermined etiology since 2010. Physicians from 46 sentinel hospitals were requested to submit serum, throat swabs and CSF from patients with either encephalopathy or ataxia of unknown etiologies, plus any one of the following: fever, seizure, focal neurological signs, abnormal CSF profile, abnormal electroencephalography (EEG) and brain images. Submitted specimens were tested for viruses using a multiplex PCR panel containing probes targeting viruses causing encephalitis. Retrospective testing to detect rabies virus was conducted on stored CSF taken during January 1, 2010 to July 15, 2013, by rabies RT-PCR. The multiplex real-time PCR detected the following pathogens using primers designed based on previously published sequences: Herpes simplex virus 1 and 2 [18] , VZV [18] , CMV [18] , Human Herpesvirus 6 and 7 [18] , Hendra virus [19] , Nipah virus [20] , Dengue virus [21] , chikungunya virus [22] , Japanese encephalitis virus [23] , West Nile virus [23] , adenovirus [24] , bocavirus [24] , coronavirus (229E, HKU1, OC43 and NL63) [25] , enterovirus [24] , human metapneumovirus [26] , human parechovirus [27] , influenza virus (types A [28] and B [29] ), parainfluenza virus (types 1-3, 4A and 4B) [24] [25], parvovirus B19 [30] , polyomavirus (JC and BK) [31] , respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [29] and rhinovirus [24] .",

Because of possible human RIG shortage, 2000 vials of 5 ml equine RIG (RabAvert [Novartis]) was also imported in August. PrEP programs began on July 27, targeting high risk groups, which included dog catchers, game wardens, animal shelter workers and veterinarians conducting rabies surveillance. Characteristics of all rabies immunization recipients, including demographics of the recipients, animal types and classification of animal-bite wound, were registered in a web-based system.",

Prior to confirming Taiwan as a rabies endemic country, few vaccines and RIGs were required countrywide. Therefore, all vaccines and RIGs were procured by TCDC, and then distributed to hospitals as needed. Having the experience of centralized procurement and supply of rabies PEP meant that the emergent procurement process could be pushed forward without having to seek new pharmaceutical firm collaboration, and that TCDC and hospitals already have set standard operating procedure for the distribution of these supplies. Through rapid mobilization of government fund and prompt procurement, TCDC guaranteed the availability of PEP to all who requires vaccines and RIG following animal bites. However, rabies prevention through PEP is costly. A course of vaccination and RIG costs more than USD800, and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that it costs USD10,000 to 100 million for each life saved [37] . Intradermal vaccination protocol has been endorsed by WHO to reduce vaccine use. This protocol has not been endorsed by the national health authorities because intradermal administration of vaccines requires additional training of healthcare personnel, and is not available in all vaccine administration sites. In addition, the vaccine, once opened, must be used up within a few hours, and Taiwan does not have the volume of patients that make intradermal administration cost-saving. Therefore, intradermal PEP protocols were not adopted in Taiwan. The governmentfunded PEP program has become a financial burden on public funding and sustainability should be taken into account in long-term preparedness plans. As of January 1, 2014, rabies PEP is being offered free of charge through Taiwan's National Health Insurance scheme, ensuring the sustainable medical care to bite patients, ending the role played by TCDC during the first six month of the animal rabies epidemic.",

The subsequent panic-driven vaccine-seeking behavior from the public was expected. Because physicians in Taiwan had not been educated about the use of rabies PEP, blanket ACIP recommendation to cover all rodent and shrew bites were unavoidable, even though this is contrary to WHO recommendation. In the ensuing months, physicians treating animal bites must be educated to evaluate bites more thoroughly, and provide vaccines to those who truly require vaccination and RIG. Increased postexposure vaccine-seeking behavior and increased physician delivery of vaccines have been shown to be associated with episodic importation of rabies by Lardon, et al [39] . Media alerts regarding the presence of rabies in the community is shown to be associated with enhanced sense of risk. Following the peak of vaccineseeking behavior in the wake of the media attention on rabies in Taiwan, PEP use decreased. The reason for the decrease of PEP use in the last two months of our surveillance period is currently unknown. This may have been the result of increased physician awareness of the rabies transmission risk among different animals, decreased medical seeking behavior among patients with animal bites without media stimulation, decreased risky behavior leading to animal bites through public education, or a combination of these causes. High risk personnel receiving PrEP has been advised before rabies was identified in animal population, but uptake of vaccine was low, with approximately 250 doses administered annually. The low uptake is suspected to be because PrEP must be paid by individual patient, while PEP was provided free of charge. With animal rabies reemergence in Taiwan, there is increased perceived risk of illness, thus increased PrEP uptake.",

The true incidence of animal bites is likely to be much higher than currently reported. In addition, PCR testing of CSF is not sensitive for detecting rabies infection [46] . Current strategy in reporting patients with encephalitis of unknown etiologies may also not be sensitive in selecting patients with furious rabies. A more sensitive strategy may be needed to increase the sensitivity of identifying unrecognized human rabies. Because sentinel hospitals submitting specimens for encephalitis of unknown etiology are not geographically representative of Taiwan, human rabies cases may also not have been detected as a result. To ameliorate geographic misrepresentation, on October 28, 2013, TCDC has requested that all hospitals to submit CSF and saliva specimens for rabies testing, if patients have encephalitides of unidentified etiology requiring intensive care or resulting in death. Starting November 2013, rabies virus has been added to the multiplex PCR panel to identify encephalitides of unknown cause.",

There are still much to be done for the control of animal rabies and prevent human rabies, including studies to characterize interactions between humans and ferret-badgers, establishing improved animal rabies reporting for human disease control, and control of rabies among ferret-badgers. Continued sharing of surveillance, epidemiologic and virologic data between public health and agricultural authorities may facilitate rabies control in both humans and animals. In the long run, continued multifaceted surveillance of animal bites and clinical encephalitides, encompassing both animal and human surveillance, and interministerial collaboration are crucial to achieve the goal of rabies-free status in Taiwan. Continued surveillance is required for countries with and without rabies, to ensure early identification of disease in both humans and animals.",
