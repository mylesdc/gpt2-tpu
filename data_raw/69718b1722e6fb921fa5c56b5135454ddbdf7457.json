            "text": "Recently, we found that the cytidine deaminase APOBEC3G (A3G) inhibits measles (MV) replication. Using a microarray, we identified differential regulation of several host genes upon ectopic expression of A3G. One of the up-regulated genes, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein retention receptor KDELR2, reduced MV replication~5 fold when it was over-expressed individually in Vero and CEM-SS T cells. Silencing of KDELR2 in A3G-expressing Vero cells abrogated the antiviral activity induced by A3G, confirming its role as an A3G-regulated antiviral host factor. Recognition of the KDEL (Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu) motif by KDEL receptors initiates the retrograde transport of soluble proteins that have escaped the ER and play an important role in ER quality control. Although KDELR2 over-expression reduced MV titers in cell cultures, we observed no interaction between KDELR2 and the MV hemagglutinin (H) protein. Instead, KDELR2 retained chaperones in the ER, which are required for the correct folding and transport of the MV envelope glycoproteins H and fusion protein (F) to the cell surface. Our data indicate that KDELR2 competes with MV envelope proteins for binding to calnexin and GRP78/Bip, and that this interaction limits the availability of the chaperones for MV proteins, causing the reduction of virus spread and titers.",

            "text": "Measles virus (MV) replication is reduced by more than 90% in ectopically A3G expressing Vero cells [1] . We recently described that one of the A3G regulated host cell factors, REDD1 (regulated in development and DNA damage response-1), affects MV replication via regulation of mTORC1 [2] . Another host cell factor, KDELR2, was significantly increased upon the ectopic expression of A3G [2] , requiring closer investigation. The KDELR family of receptors plays an important role in the retrieval of ER resident chaperones containing the C-terminal tetra peptide sequence KDEL (Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu) [3] . Activation of the seven-transmembrane KDEL receptors results in the activation of src family kinases coordinating the secretory pathway [4] . By this mechanism, chaperones regulate the maturation and fate of proteins to prevent excessive aggregation in the ER-Golgi network. KDELR receptors are primarily localized in the Golgi where they sort escaped chaperones to COPI vesicles and initiate their retrograde transport. Ligand binding or over-expression results in the redistribution of KDEL receptors to the ER [5, 6] . Binding of ligands to KDELR2 is a pH dependent process, which is efficient at acidic pH and weaker at basic pH [7] . Therefore, the binding of chaperones to KDELR2 in the acidic Golgi environment is strong, and after transport to the neutral ER, the cargo is released in the ER [8] . Although already identified in 1990, the complete functions of KDELR family proteins are poorly understood. Recent findings have suggested that KDELR-ligand binding can induce signaling cascades regulating cellular secretory traffic [9] , growth, differentiation, and immune responses [10] . These findings have shown that KDEL receptors exert their effects at multiple levels serving additional unidentified novel roles.",

KDELR mediated pH dependent transport across these compartments is exploited by various viruses. For example, the dengue virus 1 (DENV1) prM protein interacts directly with KDELR1 and KDELR2, which supports transport of the viral envelope proteins to the plasma membrane [12] . JEV (Japanese encephalitis virus), another member of the Flavivirus family, is also dependent on KDELR1 mediated viral particle transport to the plasma membrane [13] . In the case of the vaccinia virus, host cellular membranes are delivered to virions by KDELRs and coatomer proteins [14] . Interestingly, FIPV (feline infectious peritonitis coronavirus) glycoproteins possess the ER retention signal KTEL to delay their release from the ER, which ensures the correct maturation of these proteins [15] . Various other viruses such as HCV (hepatitis C virus) are known to extensively use ER membrane webs for particle assembly [16] .",

Accordingly, the protein expression of KDELR2 was increased in Vero-A3G cells 1.3-fold [2] ( Figure 1B, lane 2) . To investigate the potential role of KDELR2 in the inhibition of MV replication, Vero cells were transduced with a KDELR2 expressing lentiviral vector. The KDELR2 protein expression in these Vero-KDELR2 cells was confirmed by Western blotting ( Figure 1B, lane 3) . Vero-KDELR2 cells, Vero-A3G, and Vero 023 cells were infected with rMV-eGFP and the titers of newly synthesized MV were determined after 1, 2, and 3 days ( Figure 1C ). Ectopic expression of KDELR2 reduced the MV titer by approximately 88% ( Figure 1C , lanes 3) in comparison to 97.7% in the case of A3G ( Figure 1C, lanes 2) . To confirm the role of KDELR2 in the A3G mediated inhibition of MV, KDELR2 levels were depleted in Vero-A3G cells using KDELR2-shRNA ( Figure 1B, lane 4) . As the antiviral effect in Vero-A3G cells is not only due to KDELR2, but other effectors are also involved such as REDD1 [2] , we expected a partial abrogation of the antiviral effect by KDELR2-specific shRNA. Interestingly, the silencing of KDELR2 in Vero A3G cells significantly increased the viral titer to a level comparable to that found in Vero-023 control cells ( Figure 1C ). This is probably due to the fact that shRNA treated cells express less KDELR2 than Vero-023 cells, thus the antiviral effect exerted by KDELR2 in Vero-A3G cells was over-compensated. The syncytium formation observed in these various cell lines reflected the findings with the viral titers ( Figure 1D ). role of KDELR2 in the A3G mediated inhibition of MV, KDELR2 levels were depleted in Vero-A3G cells using KDELR2-shRNA ( Figure 1B, lane 4) .

In contrast to our findings with MV, KDEL receptors have been described to support the replication of dengue [12] , Japanese encephalitis [13] , and vaccinia virus [14] . In the case of dengue virus, this is probably due to the fact that the viral prM protein is a direct target of KDELR and that nascent dengue viruses bud into the lumen of the ER and are translocated to the Golgi [12] . In the trans-Golgi network, prM is cleaved by cellular proteases and infectious dengue viruses are formed there. For the Japanese encephalitis virus, similar mechanisms may occur. In the case of the vaccinia virus, the interaction of KDELR with COPI and coatomer was shown to support the formation of infectious viral particles [14] .",

            "text": "Interestingly, KDEL receptors as well as the chaperones GRP78, calreticulin, and calnexin are up-regulated by cells under stress conditions and viral infections as part of the stress response [17, 18, 26] . GRP78 binds the ER stress sensors PERK, IRE1, and ATF6 in their inactive forms, from which it is released upon ER stress, resulting in the activation of the associated signaling pathways influencing cell survival and apoptosis [27] . Thus, GRP78 is a key regulator of the unfolded protein response, which is induced in tumorigenesis, but also upon the viral infection of cells [28] . Our data indicated that the over-expression of KDELR2 reduced the surface expression, but did not or only slightly reduced the total expression of the chaperons calnexin and GRP78 ( Figure 5A,B) . This also suggests that a higher concentration of KDELR2 leads to the retention of an increased fraction of calnexin and GRP78 in the ER. Thus, fewer chaperones are available to interact with MV-H, which consequently reduces the transport of MV-H to the cell surface. This view is supported by the clearly separated localization of MV-H and KDELR2 in infected cells ( Figure 4A ), suggesting that KDELR and MV-H compete to bind to chaperones and are sequestered from each other. In addition to the lack of surface transportation, MV-H in the absence of chaperones may be un-or misfolded and eventually be directed to a degradative pathway.",

The finding that KDELR2-specific shRNA leads to a complete compensation of the restrictive effect may be due to the fact that the silencing very efficiently reduces the expression of KDELR2 below the level of endogenous basic expression, which may enable an even better replication of MV than found in parental Vero cells. In summary, our data indicated that ectopic expression of A3G in Vero cells exerted its antiviral effect against MV by the induction of two host factors, REDD1 [2] and KDELR2.",

            "text": "In this paper, the role of KDELR2 was defined in the immortalized cell lines Vero and CEM-SS T, which provokes the question if this might be similar in primary cells. In primary cells, A3G is induced by cytokines such as interferons, interleukin-2, and interleukin-15, depending on the cell type [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] . Induction of A3G in primary human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) by phytohemagglutinin (PHA), IL-2, and type I interferon also leads to increased KDELR2 expression (own observation, not shown). Due to the plethora of cytokine effects, the investigation of A3G-dependent consequences for host factor expression such as KDELR2 requires the ectopic expression of A3G and/or specific inhibition by interfering RNA. An attempt in primary human PBL recently revealed that A3G has the inherent capacity to regulate genes coding for STAT3, NF-\u03baB, CCL5, IL-6, IL-4, IFN-\u03b3, IL-10, and IL-17 as well as the ability to program T cell plasticity [35] . In addition, KDELR2 silencing may generally impair the homeostasis and functions of primary lymphocytes, as described recently for KDELR1 [23] . Further unbiased approaches in various primary cell types may be performed to capture all involved genes and to elucidate the role of KDELR2 for the replication of viruses. ",
