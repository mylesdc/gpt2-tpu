In addition to smallpox, several other members of the genus are capable of causing human infection, including monkeypox, cowpox, and other zoonotic rodent-borne poxviruses. Therefore, a single assay that can accurately identify all orthopoxviruses could provide a valuable tool for rapid broad orthopovirus identification. We have developed a pan-Orthopoxvirus assay for identification of all members of the genus based on four PCR reactions targeting Orthopoxvirus DNA and RNA helicase and polymerase genes. The amplicons are detected using electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (PCR/ESI-MS) on the Ibis T5000 system. We demonstrate that the assay can detect and identify a diverse collection of orthopoxviruses, provide sub-species information and characterize viruses from the blood of rabbitpox infected rabbits. The assay is sensitive at the stochastic limit of PCR and detected virus in blood containing approximately six plaque-forming units per milliliter from a rabbitpox virus-infected rabbit.",

            "text": "The orthopoxviruses (family Poxviridae, genus Orthopoxvirus) are a diverse group of large, enveloped viruses that contain a covalently closed, double-stranded DNA genome of approximately 200 kbp [1] . The genus is comprised of at least 10 recognized species. Several viruses within this group are significant human pathogens, including Variola virus (the causative agent of smallpox), monkeypox virus, cowpox virus, and Vaccinia virus. Other members, including raccoonpox, camelpox, ectromelia (mousepox), taterapox, and volepox viruses have only been isolated from their respective mammalian hosts. Although many orthopoxviruses specifically infect certain animal hosts, others (e.g., monkeypox and cowpox viruses) can also infect humans and are considered zoonotic pathogens. In humans, symptoms of orthopoxvirus infections range from mild skin lesions to fatal systemic disease. For example, smallpox produced a generalized rash that progressed from the papular to vesicular to pustular stages and resulted in a greater than 30% mortality rate in unvaccinated persons [2] . Although naturally-occurring smallpox was eradicated nearly three decades ago [3] , official stocks of the virus still remain in two locations, one at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, GA and the other at the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology, Novosibirsk, Russia. This, in addition to waning immunity against smallpox within the human population, has led to concerns that Variola virus might be used as a bioweapon [4] .",

It was also the first animal virus to be purified and chemically analyzed and was the first to be genetically engineered [7] . Despite its notoriety, however, its origin and natural history remain obscure. Recent evidence suggests that Vaccinia virus and horsepox virus are very similar phylogenetically and share a relatively recent common ancestor [8] . Vaccinia virus is often confused with cowpox virus; although it is now well established that they are distinct virus species [9] . In fact, cowpox virus is considered a zoonotic pathogen and is seen in a broad range of host species, most notable wild rodents, but rarely in cattle, as its name would imply. Interestingly, wild and domestic cats and elephants appear to be highly susceptible to infection with cowpox virus [9] . Numerous recent studies have uncovered several novel vaccinia-like viruses that have caused zoonotic outbreaks in Brazil [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16] . It is likely that as various ecological niches are examined further, even more species of Orthopoxvirus will be identified.",

Here, we describe a rapid, high-throughput, multi-locus method for identifying orthopoxviruses based on PCR amplification followed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (PCR/ ESI-MS) performed on the Ibis T5000 instrument [22, 23, 24, 25] .

Four primer pairs were chosen for use in the final assay format ( Table 1) . Several of the primers have non-homologous nucleotides at their 59 ends to raise the temperature of melting (Tm) of the primers after the first round of amplification as orthopoxviruses have a low GC genome. Primer Pair VIR982 exhibited the greatest analytical sensitivity of the four primers in the assay. Figure 1 shows the alignment of this primer pair against the known sequences of several diverse orthopoxviruses.

Blood extract from rabbitpox-infected rabbits was taken six days after exposure to aerosolized rabbitpox virus. The first blood sample evaluated (sample ID: 3E-day 6) was found to have 4610 3 plaque forming units (PFU) per mL of blood as determined by a plaque assay on Vero cells. DNA extract from this sample was analyzed by real-time PCR and found to contain 4610 6 genomes/mL of blood, assuming 100% extraction efficiency. Blood taken on the 6 th day post infection from a second infected rabbit (sample ID: 3D-day6) had 3.3610 2 PFU/ mL blood and 2.5610 5 genomes/mL blood. The most sensitive primer pair, VIR985, detected eight genomic copies of rabbitpox genome isolated from infected rabbit blood with 100% efficiency in 10 out 10 PCR replicates, which is near or at the stochastic limits of PCR detection. The viral PFU in this blood samples was determined prior to DNA extraction and the diluted DNA extract would equate to less than 2 PFU/mL of blood. The three additional primer pairs are sensitive to 30 genomes per PCR reaction, which corresponds to a detection of 6.3 PFU/mL of blood, with 100% detection in 10 out 10 PCR replicates and provide added sub-species information and redundancy to the assay ( Figure 3 ).",

Though Variola virus has been eradicated there is still the potential for its reintroduction into the human population through an act of bioterrorism. It is also possible that a zoonotic orthopoxvirus could emerge as a variola-like virus of humans or be used as a bioterrorist agent. A single assay that can detect and identify all orthopoxviruses is critical for effective surveillance. Though several methods exist for the detection and surveillance of orthopoxvirus, these assays are limited in their coverage or require large numbers of reactions to identify all Orthopoxvirus species. In this study, we describe an assay using four PCR primer pairs that can identify and distinguish all orthopox species and can provide subspecies level of identification of several important orthopoxviruses. Our primers target the highly conserved core viral DNA and RNA polymerase and helicase genes and thus it is very likely that novel orthopox viruses will also be detected using this strategy.",

Using the described assay, a single 96 well PCR plate can be used to analyze 24 samples and the system can process 16 plates in a 24 hour period for a total throughput of 384 samples per day on a single instrument.
