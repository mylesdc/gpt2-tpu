The use of agarose-inflated lung slices for respiratory virus pathogenesis studies has been described previously [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . Here, we describe a protocol in which agarose-inflated lung slices can be kept viable in culture for at least seven days post-necropsy of an experimental animal. The combination of these viable lung slices with recombinant viruses expressing fluorescent reporter proteins [7] [8] [9] allows for accurate, sensitive and reproducible assessment of respiratory virus infection and dissemination over time. Furthermore, use of these recombinant viruses allows for real time monitoring of infection processes, using multiple methods for measurement of fluorescence (e.g., flow cytometry and confocal laser scanning microscopy). Lung slices are also suitable for analysis by immunohistochemistry, thereby visualizing virus cell tropism and spatial localization of infected cells within the tissue. We have validated this technique by infecting lung slices of multiple host species (cotton rats, ferrets, dogs and macaques) with various paramyxoviruses expressing fluorescent reporter proteins (measles virus (MV), canine distemper virus (CDV), human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) and human metapneumovirus (HMPV)) [10] . This technique, however, is directly transferable to different host species and different viruses [11] .",

Lungs should be taken from the experimental animal during necropsy, keeping the material as intact as possible and attached to the primary bronchus and trachea. Using a (blunt-end) needle or flexible catheter, the fresh lungs are inflated through the trachea (or primary bronchus, if inflation of a half lung or single lobe is desired) with low-melting point agarose mixed with culture medium. After solidification on ice, slices can be prepared by hand using microtome blades and cultured in 6-or 24-well plates with culture medium, dependent on the size of the slices. These lung slices are subsequently inoculated with infectious virus (or could be used for any other experimental purpose) and can be followed in time by phase-contrast inverted light microscopy or fluorescence, when reporter viruses expressing fluorescent proteins are used (see Figure 1 ). In addition, emigrant cells in the culture medium can be harvested in time and analyzed by flow cytometry. Although these emigrant cells could be present due to tissue degradation, they can be detected at early time-points after refreshing the culture medium, suggesting they are mobile emigrant cells. We have detected cells from lymphoid, myeloid and epithelial origin using this method. At the end of the experiment, slices can be used as desired; potential applications include fixation followed by paraffin embedding and immunohistochemistry, or generation of single cell suspensions to be analyzed via flow cytometry. . After solidification on ice, thin slices of approximately 1-mm thick can be cut by hand (C) and are transferred to 6-or 24-well plates pre-filled with culture medium (D). Slices can subsequently be inoculated with the desired virus (E) and infection of the slices is followed in time (F). In this example in panel F, a macaque lung slice infected with recombinant measles virus is shown.",

We have observed viability of these slices for up to seven days post resection; however, this could be dependent on the species and culture conditions. Infections with respiratory viruses of lung slices are normally relatively successful: Figures 2 and 3 show examples of ex vivo paramyxovirus-infected lung slices. In these experiments, macaque lungs were inflated and infected with MV, which is clearly able to infect the macaque lung slices. Of course, viruses corresponding to the target species should be chosen to obtain positive results. In the family of Paramyxoviridae for example, viruses exclusively infecting primates or carnivores exist. Measles virus, a virus of primates, successfully infected non-human primate but not dog lungs, whereas CDV, a virus of carnivores, behaved vice versa. Using viruses expressing fluorescent reporter proteins allows for sensitive detection of virus-infected cells in these experiments; however, these experiments can also be performed with non-fluorescent viruses. Staining should still make infected cells visible in immunohistochemistry, confocal laser scanning microscopy or flow cytometry.",
