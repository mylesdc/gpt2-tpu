Proteolytic processing of one of the precursors, AtPSK4, was demonstrated by cleavage of a preproAtPSK4myc transgene product to AtPSK4-myc. Cleavage of proAtPSK4 was induced by placing root explants in tissue culture. The processing of proAtPSK4 was dependent on AtSBT1.1, a subtilisin-like serine protease, encoded by one of 56 subtilase genes in Arabidopsis. The gene encoding AtSBT1.1 was up-regulated following the transfer of root explants to tissue culture, suggesting that activation of the proteolytic machinery that cleaves proAtPSK4 is dependent on AtSBT1.1 expression. We also demonstrated that a fluorogenic peptide representing the putative subtilase recognition site in proAtPSK4 is cleaved in vitro by affinity-purified AtSBT1.1. An alanine scan through the recognition site peptide indicated that AtSBT1.1 is fairly specific for the AtPSK4 precursor. Thus, this peptide growth factor, which promotes callus formation in culture, is proteolytically cleaved from its precursor by a specific plant subtilase encoded by a gene that is up-regulated during the process of transfering root explants to tissue culture.",

However, they observed little difference in overall plant growth between wild-type, pskr1-1 and AtPSKR1ox, an over-expression line. The most prominent characteristic of pskr1-1 was that vegetative tissues in mature plants lost their ability to form callus. Unlike wild-type plants, leaf discs from the fully expanded leaves of pskr1-1 plants were less capable of producing callus, while unexpanded leaves retained callus-forming capacity. AtPSKR1 over-expressing plants (AtPSKR1ox) showed delayed senescence, and, as a result, leaves continued to expand, resulting in larger leaves than the wild-type.",

In doing so, we identified a subtilase, AtSBT1.1, that is required for cleavage of the fusion protein AtPSK4-myc.

Most subtilases are predicted to be secreted proteins (Rautengarten et al., 2005) , so we reasoned that AtSBT1.1 could be involved in processing of an extracellular growth factor or receptor related to shoot regeneration. Growth factors that might require the action of AtSBT1.1 include peptide hormones, such as AtPSKs.

PreproAtPSK4 will be referred to as ppAtPSK4 and proAtPSK4 as pAtPSK4. AtPSK4 was chosen for study because it is the most abundantly expressed PSK precursor . The predicted size of pAtPSK4 with the myc tag is 12.8 kDa, but we observed a band at approximately 19 kDa on Western blots, larger than the predicted size ( Figure 1a , wt, 0 time). To demonstrate, nonetheless, that this band is pAtPSK4myc, we analyzed the partially purified myc-tagged protein and identified three peptides derived from the fusion protein by MS/MS analysis ( Figure S1 ). Thus, the larger apparent size of pAtPSK4-myc may be due to anomalous gel migration behavior or post-translational modification of part of the precursor protein. (a) Root segments from wild-type transgenic seedlings expressing the construct 35S:ppAtPSK4-myc were explanted and incubated on callus induction medium (CIM) for 1-4 days and then transferred onto shoot induction medium (SIM).

We suspected that failure to detect processing may have been due to seedling growth or culture conditions. We had chosen to study AtSBT1.1 in the first place due to observations that we had made about shoot regeneration from root explants (Lall et al., 2004) . Therefore, we subjected root explants from 35S:ppAtPSK4-myc seedlings to tissue culture conditions for regenerating shoots. This involves pre-incubating root segments on an auxin-rich callus induction medium (CIM), and then transferring them after 4 days to a cytokinin-rich shoot induction medium (SIM). Under these conditions, a band appeared at approximately 7 kDa in Western blots (Figure 1a , wt, lanes 1d and 4d CIM or SIM), representing the myc-tagged cleaved peptide, AtPSK4-myc. The size of the processed protein was consistent with a cut at or near the cleavage site as determined by the in vitro experiments described below.

To do so, we examined cleavage of pAtPSK4-myc in T-DNA mutants with insertions in AtSBT1.1. The gene encoding AtSBT1.1 (At1g01900) has a single intron, and sbt1.1-1 (SALK_111561) and sbt1.1-2 (SALK_108704) have T-DNA insertions in the first exon. The T-DNA lines were judged to be null mutants because AtSBT1.1 transcripts were not found in seedlings from either line ( Figure S2 ). The 35S:ppAtPSK4-myc construct was introduced into the two T-DNA mutant lines, and root explants were subjected to regeneration conditions (4 days incubation on CIM). The pAtPSK4-myc precursor was produced in these lines, but the cleavage product AtPSK4-myc peptide was not detected (Figure 1a , lanes sbt1.1-1 and sbt1.1-2). To demonstrate that the transgenic product in these lines was still cleavable, we out-crossed sbt1.1-1 bearing the 35S:ppAtPSK4-myc construct to wildtype, and demonstrated that processing was restored in root explants of the F 1 seedlings ( Figure S3 ). We concluded from these results that AtSBT1.1 is required for pAtPSK4-myc cleavage under these conditions. This finding is quite significant given that there are 56 different subtilases encoded by the Arabidopsis genome (Rautengarten et al., 2005) .",

The site was chosen because di-basic amino acid residues (in this case, RR) are characteristic signatures of subtilase recognition sites (Barr, 1991) . When bead-bound protein from transgenic plants expressing AtSBT1.1-myc was incubated with fluorescence-quenched fpAtPSK4, a time-dependent increase in fluorescence was observed (Figure 4a ). Because the enzyme was produced in a homologous system, we were mindful of potential contamination by endogenous Arabidopsis subtilases in our preparations. To preclude that possibility, we thoroughly washed the beads and routinely ran controls in which the same pull-down procedure was conducted with extracts from non-transgenic seedlings and from transgenic seedlings expressing a tagged subtilase (S552A) that was mutated at the active site ( Figure 4a ). The kinetics of the reaction with the fluorogenic peptide substrate followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics, and the K m for the reaction was determined to be approximately 18 lM (Figure 4b ). The K m value lies within the range of affinity constants for fluorogenic peptide substrates with comparable subtilases, such as mammalian prohormone convertases (Basak et al., 2004 (Basak et al., , 2007 .

            "text": "Although there are six genes encoding PSKs in Arabidopsis, the mature peptides (YIYTQ) encoded by each gene are identical (with the exception of AtPSK6, YIYTH). Presumably, the peptides encoded by each gene should be able to bind and activate the single known receptor, AtPSKR1 . Each of the AtPSK precursors has the typical subtilase recognition site signature (di-basic amino acids) 8-10 residues upstream from the mature peptide (Barr, 1991) . However, the residues that are critical for AtSBT1.1 recognition (the four or five residues just downstream from the di-basic site) differ somewhat between AtPSK genes, and therefore AtSBT1.1 appears to be most specific for cleavage of PSK4. That suggests that other subtilases might be involved in the processing of other PSKs.",

We found that higher expression levels of the gene encoding AtSBT1.1 (At1g01900) correlated with the presence of the superior allele at the major QTL conditioning shoot regeneration in Arabidopsis tissue culture (Lall et al., 2004) . Higher levels of AtSBT1.1 expression may not have anything to do directly with shoot regeneration. However, higher levels of AtSBT1.1 expression might promote the proliferation of callus from which shoots are derived. Similar reasoning was used by Hanai et al. (2000) to explain the stimulatory effects of PSKs on somatic embryo formation in carrot. They concluded that PSKs might promote the proliferation of cells giving rise to somatic embryos, rather than influencing the formation of somatic embryos.",
