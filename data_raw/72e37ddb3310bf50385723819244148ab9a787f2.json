However, some contrasting evidence exists in the literature with regard to commonly reported risk factors. In this study, we investigated whether the known risk factors for FIV and FeLV infections have a stronger effect for either infection. This retrospective study included samples from 696 cats seropositive for FIV and 593 cats seropositive for FeLV from the United States and Canada. Data were collected during two cross sectional studies, where cats were tested using IDEXX FIV/FeLV ELISA kits. To compare the effect of known risk factors for FIV infection compared to FeLV, using a case-case study design, random intercept logistic regression models were fit including cats' age, sex, neuter status, outdoor exposure, health status and type of testing facility as independent variables. A random intercept for testing facility was included to account for clustering expected in testing practices at the individual clinics and shelters.",

            "text": "Infections with feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and feline leukemia virus (FeLV) are two of the most common and important infectious diseases of cats [1, 2] . The most common mode of transmission of FIV is through bites [3, 4] . FeLV infection is also commonly acquired via the oro-nasal route through mutual grooming, nursing or sharing of dishes apart from bites [3] . The known risk factors for acquiring these infections are male sex, adulthood and exposure to outdoors, whereas being neutered and indoor lifestyle are known protective factors [5] . However, the relative importance attributed to age, outdoor exposure and sex among infected cats is variable in the literature. Some studies indicate that FeLV infections are age-dependent [6] and primarily acquired by \"friendly\" cats through prolonged close contact between virus shedders and susceptible cats through mutual grooming, sharing of food and water dishes, and use of common litter areas [3] . However, other studies have indicated adulthood [1, 7] , outdoor lifestyle [1, 7] , being not neutered [8] , and fighting [8, 9] , factors commonly associated with FIV, to also be associated with FeLV infection. Thus, further research is necessary to investigate the relative importance of these factors to help in management and prevention of these infections.",

Case-case studies are a variant of case-control studies when the disease of interest can be sub-classified in two or several groups that may have distinct risk factors [11] . A case-case study differs from a case-control study in that the comparison group (or controls) are also selected among the cases, typically with same disease but a different strain or serotype, from the same surveillance system [11] . The case-case study approach has been used increasingly in epidemiology e.g. to compare risk factors for two subtypes of the same disease with the goal of ascertaining relative importance of risk factors for either subtype [11] . The main advantage of the case-case design is its ability to limit selection and information biases: control cases have similar clinical features, are identified through the same system and are subject to the same biases as cases [11, 12] . The goal of this study was to assess the relative importance of known risk factors between the two common feline retroviral infections, FIV and FeLV, using the case-case study approach.",

The cats included in these studies were conveniently sampled from veterinary clinics and animal shelters across 40 contiguous states of the US and 9 Canadian provinces encompassing 641 US zip codes and Canadian forward sortation areas in 346 US counties and Canadian Census Divisions. The first study investigated cats in the US and Canada while the second study was restricted to the Canadian cat population. Data collection has been described elsewhere [1, 7] . Briefly, potential veterinary clinic participants in the US were identified from the membership roster of the American Association of Feline Practitioners (AAFP) as well as from the list of all individuals who had purchased test kits for FIV and FeLV. Potential animal shelter participants (including cat rescue organisations, and groups participating in Trap-Neuter-Release (TNR) programs) were derived from various Internet directories [1] . In Canada, potential veterinary clinic and animal shelter (including cat rescue programs and feral cat programs in Canada) participants were identified as all those who had purchased test kits for FIV or FeLV or submitted samples to a diagnostic laboratory [7] . Potential study participants were sent an invitation letter to participate in the study. Enrolled participants submitted the diagnostic results for FIV and FeLV along with information on age, sex, neuter status, outdoor exposure, health status and test date using a standard reporting form. The testing and reporting was performed from August to November 2004 for the American and Canadian participants in the first study and from August to November 2007 for the Canadian participants in the second study.",

A confounder was a non-intervening covariate whose removal from the model resulted in greater than 20% change in coefficients on the log-odds scale for any of the remaining variables in the model. Two-way interaction terms among type of testing facility, health status, outdoor exposure, age and sex were also assessed for statistical significance. However, interaction terms were dropped when these led to sparse cells and unrealistic estimates. Multicollinearity was tested among screened variables in the multivariable logistic regression model by estimating the variance inflation factor (VIF). All variables with a VIF value of 10 or above were considered to indicate multicollinearity, assuming that this was not due to variable construction (e.g. interaction terms) [10] . Non-nested multivariable models were compared using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), and the model with lowest AIC value was considered to be better fitting.",

            "text": "This study found a higher likelihood of FIV (compared to FeLV) seropositivity in adults. In contrast to FIV, FeLV is reported to be age dependent with older cats becoming increasingly resistant to infection [23, 24] . Of note, however, is the fact that while age at acquisition is similar for both infections, FeLV can cause serious, often fatal, disease. As a result, FeLV-infected cats have shorter survival rates [25, 26] and not many live to adulthood, while most FIV infected cats do. Higher probability of infection can be expected in males compared to females for FIV [9, [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] . But for FeLV, most studies did not find an association between sex and seropositivity [28, 38] except for a single report [9] . The association between male sex and FIV infection has been primarily related to increased risk of infection transmission due to greater predisposition of males to exhibit territorial behaviour involving fighting. In this study, regression models included contrasts to compare the likelihood of seropositivity of FIV between intact and neutered male cats as well as between intact and spayed female cats. Although, compared to females, males were found to be more likely to test seropositive for FIV compared to FeLV, no significant differences were evident between intact and neutered cats for the same sex (Table 3 and 4 ). Various studies have reported an association between neutering and lower risk of infection of FIV and FeLV among domestic cats [8] . However, there are reports suggesting that neutering and spaying have no significant effect on the prevalence of FIV [27, 39, 40] and that such cats still retain territorial aggressiveness [39, 40] . It should be noted that when a predictor is common to both FIV and FeLV, due to its inherent design, a case-case study might not detect a difference between the two case groups. In other words, if neutering were significantly associated with both FIV and FeLV seropositivity, this study design would not detect it. Since a higher likelihood of seropositivity was found in intact compared to neutered cats when non-infected cats were included [1, 7] , it is possible that sterilization characteristics are not different between FIV and FeLV infected cats.",

For a detailed account of pros and cons of case-case studies in general the reader is referred to McCarthy and Giesecke [11] . This study entailed comparison of FIV seropositive cats to FeLV seropositive cats with regard to known risk factors and explored the strength of their effects between the two infections. Therefore, care should be taken before extrapolating results of this study to the general population with non-infected cats. The risk factors that are common to both comparison groups tend to be underestimated or unidentified in a case-case study [11, 12] . Since the study does not include a disease-free population, the odds ratios can only be interpreted as the odds of exposure to one disease group (FIV) in reference to the other (FeLV), and do not provide the estimate of the association between a risk factor and disease in the general population [42, 43] .",
