            "text": "The global experience with recent public health emergencies such as outbreaks of Ebola Virus Disease and differential impacts of climate change has public health workers and the general public asking: Are we prepared? The burden of morbidity and mortality from emergencies and disasters can be severe, resulting in public health systems investing substantial time and resources toward preparedness [1] . The public health system is the lead in responding to outbreaks and in minimizing the impact of diverse emergencies on health [2, 3] . Public health sector activities in infectious disease emergencies include leading other emergency management organizations during outbreaks, conducting surveillance and investigation, implementing control measures, developing guidance for health-care practitioners, and communicating risks [3] . In addition, public health is the lead sector in preparing for the population health effects of non-infectious events incited by natural or anthropogenic hazards. Emergency preparedness levels have been a concern globally in past emergencies; for example, Canada's response to the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome outbreak raised a number of issues: lack of surge capacity in the clinical and public health systems, difficulties with timely access to laboratory testing and results, and weak links between public health and the health care system were clear gaps in preparedness [3] . Recognizing complex and system-level challenges that affect emergency preparedness efforts globally, the World Health Organization (WHO) has called for all countries to create resilient integrated systems that can be responsive and proactive to any future threat, although this remains a knowledge gap [4, 5] . While risks vary for different communities, disaster and emergency preparedness is recognized as essential for all nation-states [4, 6] . Local and regional public health agencies aim to mitigate risks and protect population health; however, they face challenges to ensure readiness for potential emergencies ranging widely in likelihood and impact. Further, investments change over time with economic and policy priorities, which can influence the resources available for this purpose. Thus, the ability to define and measure essential elements of public health emergency preparedness (PHEP) is important for local and/or regional public health agencies.",

In Canada, the Canadian Institutes for Health Information and Statistics Canada report indicators of health status and health care system performance [8] ; in addition, performance measurement has been used in Canada to inform health system decision-making [9] . The precise ways measurement and reporting influence health systems, however, remains unclear [10] . In recent years, increasing attention has been paid to performance measurement for the public health system [11, 12] . While preparedness metrics are few in the literature [13] [14] [15] , the pressure for public health agencies to articulate their degree of preparedness is increasing. Globally, countries are asked to meet targets aimed at reducing disaster risks in their communities, which includes health impacts [6] , and the International Health Regulations (IHR) require that all nations report on indicators aligned with the IHR [16, 17] . As nation-states examine their own readiness, indicators for relevant jurisdictional levels have been developed by some countries. For example, the United States (US) has examined aspects of preparedness in the context of national health security and emergency planning [18, 19] , including the concept of resilience [20, 21] , but measurement considering resilience relevant to and actionable for practice in local/regional public health is lacking.",

The all-hazards approach is viewed as essential for public health systemlevel readiness, enabling effective and efficient preparedness that accounts for the difficulty in predicting the type and severity of events [14, 22, 23] . The conventional cycle of emergency management includes four phases which are (1) prevention/mitigation, (2) preparedness, (3) response and (4) recovery; public health agency activities relate to all four phases [24] . In this study, we focus on preparedness as upstream activities and actions that promote enhanced public health system capacity and resilience throughout all four phases. It is important to note that in Canada, PHEP addresses population-level preparedness, distinct from clinical care and health care facility preparedness. Communication and integration of preparedness activities between sectors like health care, government and the community is, however, often a responsibility of public health agencies. Relevant levels of the public health system in Canada are local or regional (varies by province/territory), provincial/territorial, and federal. We consider all three as the public health system, and we identify local/regional public health agencies as the primary locus of public health service delivery in Canada [3, 25] .",

Conceptual frameworks or maps serve as a starting point for performance measurement and QI [7] . \"Indicators only indicate\" and will never entirely capture the complexity of a system, making clarity and conceptualization about what the system is aiming to do essential [7] . To address the important task of ensuring readiness and creating resilient systems, our previous work developed a framework which identifies the essential elements of PHEP relevant to Canada, and considers the complexity of the public health system and emergency context [26] . The framework for resilience includes eleven essential elements and constitutes an evidence-based approach to defining PHEP for local/regional public health agencies and supporting practice for community health protection from disaster risks. In developing the framework, we noted that promoting resilience for public health systems requires consideration of complex aspects of preparedness such as social infrastructure [26, 27] ; for example, assessment of workforce capacity is influenced by individual workers' willingness to respond [28] . In addition, addressing challenges across these systems may require measuring dimensions such as network strength or \"connectivity\" of relevant stakeholders [29] . The framework for resilience thus conceptualizes the essential elements to consider in measuring PHEP. The objective of this study is to identify and define a set of PHEP indicators aligned with the framework to advance performance measurement for local/regional public health agencies.",

Leaders involved in PHEP in Canada include local public health officials, provincial public health and health emergency management partners, and federal public health and health system partners. Purposive sampling augmented by snowball recruitment was employed to deliberately select PHEP experts for a national sample of public health leaders and decision-makers [34] . Rationale for the sample definition is to ensure that key indicators in PHEP were identified by individuals with knowledge and experience specifically in PHEP, and who hold leadership roles and/or have clear responsibility for PHEP within their health unit, agency or jurisdiction, and for whom indicators would be relevant [31] . Medical Officers of Health (MOHs), Associate MOHs, Environmental Health Officers, and other leaders or decision-makers with experience and/or expertise in PHEP from the federal, provincial and municipal levels were recruited. We aimed to identify 20-30 PHEP experts across Canada and establish a heterogeneous composition of the panel [31, 35] . In the performance measurement indicator literature, selection of expert participants is described through a process of nomination, which we employed to recruit established experts in PHEP [36] . A nomination process by email was thus used to identify experts in the field of PHEP based on experience, scholarship or reputation in their organization or jurisdiction [31, 36] .",

Importance and actionability were defined respectively as: (1) this indicator is a key priority in public health preparedness for emergencies; and (2) this indicator is under the control of the local or regional public health agency. The survey asked participants to rate each indicator on both criteria on a seven-point Likert scale. Open-ended questions augmented the round one survey to elicit suggestions for additional indicators and obtain feedback on indicator clarity. The round 1 survey was input to the web-based platform Acuity4. The survey was piloted with experts who were not panel members but met criteria as a PHEP expert. Piloting aimed to assess clarity of the data collection instrument, functionality of the online format, and relevance of companion documents.

Indicators that achieved 70% consensus as both important and actionable were retained as PHEP indicators after round 1. Indicators that reached consensus as both not important and not actionable (disagreement consensus of 70%) were discarded. Finally, indicators that achieved 70% consensus on importance or actionable but not both were deemed as unclear and were retained for revision according to panel feedback. Sensitivity analyses were carried out to examine the thresholds for consensus [31, 36] . New indicators suggested by the panel during round 1 were extracted and analyzed using thematic analysis as there may be multiple descriptors of the same indicator [39] . First, multiple reviews of the raw data were conducted. Second, manual coding was completed and a set of unique themes (i.e. indicators) produced. Based on the resultant themes, a group of new indicators were developed for rating in round two.",

A total of 67 indicators were developed and categorized according to an empiricallyderived PHEP framework. This development of indicators by a locally-based, nationally representative expert panel represents a potentially valuable contribution to evidenceinformed public health practice with particular relevance to local/regional public health. PHEP indicator sets have previously been developed for various jurisdictions. Generally these have been oriented around accountability for funding and resource allocation for preparedness [18] . However, recent research on resilient health systems indicates that funding accountability-focused metrics may not capture a meaningful conceptualization of PHEP to answer the question 'Are we prepared?', when it comes to protecting community health [20, 21] . Further, while improved preparedness has been demonstrated in organizations with experience managing a disaster [40] , indicators and greater and more consistent measurement can enhance learning and improvement after real or simulated events. Continuous QI is an important part of public health practice and an emphasis on learning is a cornerstone for resilience-oriented approaches [4, 6] . This study advances the PHEP measurement literature in that it aligns with existing targets and regulations, but furthers it through the lens of tools to support monitoring, learning and improvement.",

Indeed, new knowledge emerged as our study was in progress. Specifically, the European Centers for Disease Control (ECDC) released a report describing PHEP core competencies for European Union member states in 2017 [41] . While a new approach for the ECDC, this work was an adaptation of a US-based model published previously [15, 26, 41] , and the indicators corresponding with the model were derived from similar documents [17, 27] . Our indicator development process used a breadth of sources and aligned with an empirically-developed conceptual framework.

The public health agency has protocols and/or processes for information-sharing with network partners for purposes of surveillance of relevant risks; for example, with agricultural, veterinary or environmental surveillance systems.58. The public health agency uses a syndromic surveillance and/or other early warning systems to detect potential public health emergencies in a timely manner.59. The public health agency has the capability to conduct rapid health risks and/or needs assessments for communities recently impacted by emergencies.60. The public health agency applies a self-assessment process to emergency management. This process may be applied to tests, exercises, simulations and/or emergency plan activations and agency responses.61. The public health agency self-assessment process is used to identify capabilities, strengths and/or assets to describe successes relevant to emergency management.62. The public health agency self-assessment process is used to inform improvement actions; for example, identifying responsible groups for corrective actions and establishing timelines for change.Practice and Experience (5 indicators)63. The public health agency practices its plans and/or protocols that are relevant to emergency management; for example, the agency emergency response plan, the business continuity plan. Practice may include table tops, exercises, simulations, or activations for emergencies.64. The public health agency conducts regular needs assessments to determine the needs for organizational practice of emergency plans and/or protocols; for example, the emergency response plan, the business continuity plan. The assessment may consider recent table tops, exercises, simulations, or activations in response to emergencies. 65. Public health agency management and staff have demonstrated the ability to adjust plans and/or protocols for emergencies in the context of new knowledge, uncertain science, and/or differences in professional opinions. This ability may be demonstrated during real or simulated emergencies.66. The public health agency has sufficient resources to practice plans and/or protocols relevant to emergency management; for example, the emergency response plan, the business continuity plan. Practice may include table tops, exercises, or simulations. 67. Public health agency practice of emergency management activities (e.g., table tops, exercises, simulations) includes the regular attendance of both management and staff.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0226489.t003",

The indicator set was derived by employing a three-round modified Delphi survey using a national expert panel in Canada. The rigour and transparency of our process is a novel contribution to the PHEP literature and may assist other countries in considering how to transfer the findings to their context. The 67 indicators represent important and actionable dimensions of PHEP practice that can be used and validated by local/regional public health agencies to assess readiness and measure improvement in their critical role of protecting community health.Supporting information S1 ",
