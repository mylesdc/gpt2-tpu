More generally, it has the potential to elucidate the complete human virome, including viruses that cause no overt symptoms of disease, but may have unrecognized immunological or developmental consequences. We have used NGS to identify RNA viruses in the blood of 195 patients with UAFI and compared them with those found in 328 apparently healthy (i.e., no overt signs of illness) control individuals, all from communities in southeastern Nigeria. Among UAFI patients, we identified the presence of nucleic acids from several well-characterized pathogenic viruses, such as HIV-1, hepatitis, and Lassa virus. In our cohort of healthy individuals, however, we detected the nucleic acids of two novel rhabdoviruses. These viruses, which we call Ekpoma virus-1 (EKV-1) and Ekpoma virus-2 (EKV-2), are highly divergent, with little identity to each other or other known viruses. The most closely related rhabdoviruses are members of the genus Tibrovirus and Bas-Congo virus (BASV), which was recently identified in an individual with symptoms resembling hemorrhagic fever. Furthermore, by conducting a serosurvey of our study cohort, we find evidence for PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | Next-generation sequencing, a high-throughput method for sequencing DNA and RNA, has the potential to transform virus discovery because it does not depend on culturing the pathogen or a priori knowledge of the pathogen's nucleic acid sequence. We used nextgeneration sequencing to identify RNA viruses present in the blood of patients with unexplained fever, as well as apparently healthy individuals in a peri-urban community in Nigeria. We found several well-characterized viruses in the blood of the febrile patients, including HIV-1, hepatitis B and C, as well as Lassa virus. We also discovered two novel rhabdoviruses in the blood of two apparently healthy (afebrile) females, which we named Ekpoma virus-1 and Ekpoma virus-2. Rhabdoviruses are distributed globally and include several human pathogens from the genera lyssavirus and vesiculovirus (e.g., rabies, Chandipura and vesicular stomatitis virus). The novel rhabdoviruses identified in this study are most similar to Bas-Congo virus, which was recently identified in an individual with an acute febrile illness. Furthermore, we demonstrate evidence of high levels of previous exposure to the two rhabdoviruses among our larger study population. Our results suggest that such rhabdovirus infections could be common, and may not necessarily cause overt disease. The identification of viral nucleic acid sequences in apparently healthy individuals highlights the need for a broader understanding of all viruses infecting humans as we increase efforts to identify viruses causing human disease.",

Examples of these discoveries include novel arenaviruses [5] , phleboviruses [4] , and coronaviruses [8] . Recently a novel rhabdovirus, now referred to as Bas-Congo virus (BASV), was identified in the blood of a patient from central Africa who was suspected of suffering from viral hemorrhagic fever [9] . However, a better understanding of the spectrum of viruses infecting humans is needed to fully realize the potential of NGS and differentiate between pathogenic and non-pathogenic viruses. This global problem is particularly acute in tropical regions throughout the world, where the burden of infectious disease remains high and the bloodstream virome of large numbers of apparently healthy individuals has not been characterized. Most studies of UAFI lack comparisons with apparently healthy individuals and rely on small-scale associations (in some cases even a single patient sample) without any statistical support or the ability to determine causality [7, 9] .",

We also created trees using MrBayes v3.2 [20] . We first built trees using 46 rhabdovirus sequences and included parainfluenza virus-1 as an outgroup, to find the novirhabdoviruses as the likely root of the rhabdovirus tree, which has been previously described [21] . We then excluded parainfluenza virus-1 and built a tree using the 46 rhabdovirus sequences (S6A Fig) , which allowed us to select VSV as a likely outgroup for the tibroviruses and ephemeroviruses. Subsequent alignments and trees were then created using only the tibroviruses and ephemeroviruses, including EKV-1, EKV-2, and BASV, as well as VSV. We found that using parainfluenza virus-1 or the novirhabdoviruses as the root, gave the same tree topology. Relevant accession numbers can be found in S4 Table. Serosurvey for EKV-1 and EKV-2",

Though these viruses were discovered in geographically distant locations, phylogenetic analyses suggest the presence of a distinct group of viruses in the Tibrovirus genus capable of human infection. Based on phylogenetic relationships, host range and genomic architecture, we propose that BASV, EKV-1 and EKV-2 should all be included within the genus Tibrovirus.",

We performed a serosurvey for EKV-1 and EKV-2 on 457 samples and found that significantly more Nigerian individuals (n = 320) had EKV-1-and EKV-2-specific antibodies than apparently healthy US controls (n = 137; Fig. 3C ; P-value < 0.0001, Mann-Whitney test). Using conservative positivity cut-off values, we found that~10% of Nigerian individuals show evidence of previous exposure to EKV-1 (Table 1 and Fig. 3C) . The seropositivity to EKV-2 was much higher, with~50% of Nigerians showing evidence of previous exposure (Table 1 and Fig. 3C ). We did not observe any significant difference in the sex or age-range of the individuals with antibody titers to EKV-1 or EKV-2 (S7 Fig). We cannot rule out that our assays do not cross-react with other similar rhabdoviruses, which could inflate the overall seroprevalence observed for the Ekpoma viruses; however, it should be noted that limited cross-reactivity was observed between EKV-1 and EKV-2 (S8A Fig). While we found strong cross-reactivity between our assays for EKV-1 and rabies virus (S8B Fig), the correlation between EKV-2 and rabies virus was much less pronounced (S8C Fig). Importantly, when testing general cross-reactivity in our assays by comparing the ELISA results from the rhabdoviruses to that of LASV, we did not find any correlations (S8D-F Fig) .",

NGS has the advantage of being able to identify pathogens without culturing or a priori knowledge of the pathogen's nucleic acid sequence. Despite the advantages of NGS, there are certain biases in our approach. First, the selection of blood limited our investigation to a single anatomical compartment. Many viruses cannot be detected in the blood (e.g., rabies virus which is strictly neurotropic). A complete understanding of a febrile or healthy person's virome necessitates sequencing of all tissues in the body, which for practical reasons, is not possible. The ability to identify novel viruses is also limited to sequences that have some homology existing sequences in a public database. Highly divergent and truly novel pathogens may be missed by conventional BLAST searches. In our study, 25% of filtered reads returned no BLAST hit or were unable to be unequivocally assigned to the eukaryotya, prokaryota or viral kingdoms. Despite these limitations however, we were able to identify EKV-1 and EKV-2, both of which have only about 35% amino acid similarity to already known viruses.",

Many factors determine whether a particular virus will produce disease in the infected host, including genetic variation in the virus and the host, nutritional and immune status, and the presence of co-infections that may increase susceptibility to otherwise benign agents. Identifying the cause of disease becomes even more challenging since multiple microbes are present in a sample, including commensal bacteria and viruses. Proving disease causality is a centuries-old problem and identifying a potential pathogen is merely the first step in a long process. Researchers have recently proposed revisions to Koch's postulates-the first framework for assessing causality-in light of advancing modern molecular techniques [30, 31] to add rigor to the pursuit. Yet there are still a number of limitations to current studies. For many studies, investigators were only able to study a single patient sample [9] . Without sufficient numbers of samples from infected patients and matched apparently healthy individuals, it is impossible to interpret the clinical significance of a single virus detection. It remains possible that BASV produced an asymptomatic infection, like the control subjects infected with EKV-1 and -2 in our study, while the acute illness was actually due to another agent, like the rotavirus (which the authors propose was a laboratory contaminant), or one of the many bacteria also present in the sample [9] . Of course, the true source of the infection could have been none of the microbes identified in the blood. Sampling of other tissues would be needed to rule out localized infections as the cause of disease.",

The most obvious approach involves finding a statistical association with the microbe in disease and non-disease states, similarly to what we show for LASV in this study (S3 Fig) . This requires collecting matched controls from either the patient or members of the community who do not have the disease. This approach faces its own challenges. If viral or host factors play a substantial role in disease outcome, it might necessitate large sample collections. Isolation of the pathogen and propagation in an animal model or tissue culture can provide valuable insights into its pathogenicity and effect on the host's response to infection.",

But in the process, it will be important to be cautious. As the vast majority of viruses studied over the past century have been those that cause disease, the large-scale sequencing of samples from vertebrates and insects will likely be biased towards identifying novel benign viruses rather than pathogenic ones. Although many newly discovered viruses may not cause overt symptoms of disease, they may have immunological and developmental consequences-perhaps by increasing susceptibility to other pathogens or affecting other aspects of human development.",

Developing systems to assess causality, especially through the thorough sampling of non-disease-affected controls, will be critical to realizing the potential of NGS as a routine diagnostic tool. We determined viral copy number using RNA extracted from plasma, primers that target the polymerase (L) gene and serial dilutions of a synthetic amplicon corresponding to the amplified target. We repeated each PCR experiment three times independently. Total human RNA purified from K562 from leukocytes and RNA purified from 244M, the plasma of an afebrile control, were used as a controls. (PDF) S10 Fig. PCR for EKV-1 and EKV-2 on original and follow-up samples. We performed reverse transcription followed by PCR on RNA extracted from the original plasma samples and follow up plasma samples and electrophoresed on a 2.2% agarose gel with ethidium bromide. Primer sets were specific for either EKV-1 or EKV-2. (PDF) Table. Sample processing and RNA-seq library construction methods. For extraction method, 'direct' refers to RNA extracted directly from plasma using the QIAamp Viral RNA Extraction Kit and 'ultracentrifugation' refers to plasma that is pooled and subjected to ultracentrifugation before RNA is extracted from the resulting pellet. RT method refers to cDNA synthesis and carrier RNA removal: (1) 'random' refers to samples without carrier RNA in which RNA was primed with random hexamers; (2) 'mod-hex' refers to samples with carrier RNA in which RNA was primed with a modified-hexamer as described in Materials and Methods; (3) 'random-PP' refers to samples with carrier RNA that in which the RNA was primed using random hexamers and then carrier RNA removed (after cDNA synthesis) using Pippin Prep size selection.
