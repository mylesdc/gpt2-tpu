A respiratory specimen and clinical information were obtained from each participant. Viral isolation and identification with immunofluorescent antibodies and molecular methods were employed to detect respiratory viruses such as adenovirus, influenza A and B, parainfluenza, and respiratory sincytial virus, among others. There were 916 participants in the study (median age: 17 years; range: 1 month -86 years). Viruses were identified in 143 (15.6%) subjects, and one participant was found to have a co-infection with more than one virus. Influenza viruses, including pandemic H1N1 2009, were the most frequently detected pathogens, accounting for 67.4% (97/144) of the viruses detected. Adenovirus (15/144), parainfluenza virus (13/144), and respiratory syncytial virus (11/144) were also important causes of ILI in this study. Pandemic H1N1 2009 virus became the most commonly isolated influenza virus during its initial appearance in 2009. Two waves of the pandemic were observed: the first which peaked in August 2009 and the second -higher than the preceding -that peaked in October 2009. In 2010, influenza A/H3N2 reemerged as the most predominant respiratory virus detected.",

A prerequisite of public health planning to reduce global disease burden from ARI is to examine data on its epidemiology in order to better define environmental factors as well as target populations for preventive interventions [4] . Respiratory viruses are predominant causes of ARIs, and the epidemiology of acute viral respiratory illnesses in developed countries with temperate climates has been well-characterized [5] [6] [7] . In countries such as the United States, children have been shown to carry a large burden of viral respiratory diseases [5] . Recent prospective studies, which utilized more sensitive methods for detecting respiratory viruses such as multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR), have similarly demonstrated that the highest rates of viral respiratory infection occur among children and the frequency of infection tends to decrease with age due to increasing acquired immunity [8] . Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, and rhinovirus have long been identified as common causes of ARI [9] . Recent improvements in molecular detection techniques have allowed the identification of multiple new respiratory viruses such as human metapneumovirus (hMPV), human bocavirus (HBoV) and human coronavirus NL63 [8] . While the body of literature describing the epidemiology of acute viral respiratory diseases in developed countries has rapidly expanded, knowledge of the distribution of these diseases in regions such as tropical South America remains limited.",

Despite developed public health intervention programs, the estimated annual average number of influenza-related hospitalizations in the United States exceeds 200,000, and 36,000 deaths are attributable to influenza infections yearly [10, 11] . Information on the contribution of influenza viruses to the global burden of disease due to acute respiratory illness is incomplete. Data on the epidemiology of influenza viruses in developed countries are derived from multiple sources to include laboratory-based surveillance, sentinel surveillance, as well as hospitalization and outpatient records. In developing countries, where resources are sparse, sentinel surveillance methods may be more readily accessible and more cost-effective than laboratory-based or population-based surveillance for determining the viral etiology of influenza-like illness (ILI) in these regions. Better identification of the viral causes of ILI will enable clinicians in resource-limited settings to appropriately treat and manage patients; more importantly, it will allow public health officials to formulate more effective prevention and control strategies, including monitoring of influenza vaccine efficacy in their communities [12] .",

A prospective study of adults with ILI in Sao Paulo, Brazil, revealed that while influenza viruses were the predominant cause of ILI, rhinoviruses and other respiratory viruses were detected in 19.6% and 13.7% of subjects, respectively [14] . This observation illustrated that a significant proportion of patients who are clinically diagnosed with influenza virus infection may have symptoms indistinguishable from other respiratory viruses. In a prospective study of ILI in Ecuador, the regional distribution of influenza virus infections varied; a higher detection rate of influenza A occurred in Quito, located in the highlands where the level of absolute humidity is lower, whereas influenza A detection rate was lower in the coastal city of Guayaquil, which has a more humid tropical climate [15] . Additionally, an expanded sentinel surveillance of ILI conducted at 31 health centers and hospitals located in 13 Peruvian cities showed that the distribution of ILI-causing viruses varied by region [13] . These studies illustrate the importance of conducting baseline and continuing ILI surveillance in other countries of Central and South America because ILI can be caused by pathogens other than influenza viruses. The distribution of respiratory infections may vary within the region or within a particular country, depending on climate and topography.",

During the ILI peaks from 2006-2010, the percentage of ILI cases attributable to influenza viruses ranged from 10% to 44%. The first cases of pH1N1 in this surveillance system were detected in July 2009, three months after the swine origin influenza outbreak began in Mexico [24] . During the first wave in July 2009, the monthly virus detection rate rose to 33%, and 57% (4/7) of all the viruses detected were of the pandemic strain. The first wave simulated a typical ILI peak activity similar to those observed in other years. However, during the larger second wave in October 2009, the virus positivity rate exceeded 40%, and the pandemic strain was identified in greater than 73% (11/15) of the viruses detected. Figure 3 demonstrates that pH1N1 did not completely replace seasonal influenza A viruses. The peak pandemic activity in October 2009 was followed by a rapid decline in the rate of pandemic strain detection one month later. Meanwhile, seasonal influenza A viruses remained in circulation throughout the pandemic period comprising 27% of all the influenza A viruses detected in October 2009. In 2010, 20% of influenza A specimens obtained via oropharyngeal swabs were randomly selected and tested for the pandemic strain via RT-PCR, and no cases of pH1N1 were detected ( Figure 3 ). However, seasonal influenza A/H3N2 continued to be detected by our surveillance system with monthly positivity rates ranging from 16% to 30%.",

Nevertheless, the rate of confirmed influenza virus infections found in our surveillance (10.6%, 97/916; Tables 2 and 3) during the study period was lower than the one (27.7%) reported by the NESS for the same period [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . These differences in detection rates may be attributable to different strategies for capturing ARI patients, especially those with influenza, used by the NESS and by this study protocol (Flores E, Director of Epidemiology, Corposalud 2011, personal communication). The NESS randomly selected a sample of ARI cases (including those with influenza) with emphasis on severe hospitalized cases, whereas in our protocol we recruited ILI subjects in an outpatient setting where the majority had symptoms that were not severe. On the other hand, the percentage of influenza viruses (not including pH1N1) detected in our study during a similar period of time, but in different years accounted for the significant differences found in both studies: a) the collection, preservation and further processing of respiratory samples, and b) the type of cells and IFA reagents used for virus isolation and identification. The proportion of influenza cases was significantly different when comparing non-pandemic and pandemic periods. Before the H1N1 2009 pandemic, the NESS [21] detected influenza virus in 64.7% of subjects in whom a virus was isolated; a similar proportion to the 55% (data not shown) found in our study. During the height of the pandemic (from July through Dec 2009), the NESS confirmed 97% of all ARI cases with a virus as having either influenza A or B virus compared with 87% observed in our study.",

While the overall virus detection rate (143/ 916, 15.6%; Table 2 ) was lower compared with other studies, the positive rates for influenza A (8.5%) and influenza B (2.1%) in this surveillance were comparable to those observed in a similar study in El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua [16] . Our findings were also consistent with a study in Indonesia, which identified influenza A or B in 11% of all respiratory samples using viral isolation and RT-PCR [25] . Our findings were consistent with those from a prospective study of outpatient children in northern Taiwan, in which influenza A or B were isolated in 12.2% of subjects with ILI, using Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell cultures and hemagglutinin inhibition assay for antigen detection [26] . However, our detection rate for all respiratory viruses, as well as influenza A and B viruses, was generally lower compared to other studies conducted in South America. In an expanded sentinel surveillance study in Peru, which utilized a similar methodology for viral detection as our study, the virus positivity rate was 42.1%, and influenza A and B rates were 25.1% and 9.7%, respectively [13] . In a prospective surveillance study of ILI in two Ecuadorian cities using similar methods, at least one virus was detected in 35% of the participants; influenza A was detected by PCR in 21.6% while 6.4% tested positive for influenza B [15] . The lower virus detection rates found in our study is unclear because we used the same operative protocol described in the mentioned studies [13, 15] . Nevertheless, the different skills to collect respiratory tract specimens from ILI patients, by the health personnel employed in their studies and ours may have accounted for the lower virus detection rates found in our study.",

On the other hand, our findings are consistent with observations in the Tecumseh Study, a community-based surveillance in Michigan, in which children were shown to have the highest rate of viral respiratory diseases [5, 6] . The Tecumseh study further illustrated the variable impact of influenza viruses among the different age groups depending on the influenza virus subtype. For example, influenza A/H3N2 affected a wide range of age groups while influenza A/H1N1 and influenza B virus infections occurred more frequently among older children and young adults [5, 6] . Our findings were similar being seasonal influenza A/H1N1 viruses and influenza B detected primarily in children and young adults, and seasonal influenza A/H3N2 found in all age groups.",

Nevertheless, this finding was similarly demonstrated in respiratory illness surveillance networks in other tropical and temperate South American countries such as Guatemala [27] , Peru [28] , Argentina [29] , and Brazil [30] . In 2010, non-pandemic influenza viruses continued to circulate in Venezuela, and pH1N1 was not detected in our surveillance study, suggesting that pH1N1 did not displace seasonal influenza A viruses. During the same year, 1.6% of the ARI cases reported to Venezuela's NESS were due to pH1N1 [21] . Infection with pH1N1 may have stimulated immunity among the residents of this community during its initial arrival in 2009. This observation suggests that the circulating pH1N1 in 2010 may not have significantly mutated relative to the strain in 2009, so that antibodies stimulated by the natural infection during its initial arrival may have still been highly efficient in protecting the Influenza-Like Illness in Maracay, Venezuela PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org community from another wave of pH1N1 outbreak.

Although rhinoviruses are typically associated with milder illness, they can contribute to the misdiagnosis of influenza based on clinical case definition alone. A cohort study of Vietnamese children hospitalized for acute febrile respiratory illness, which applied multiplex-PCR assays on respiratory samples, revealed slightly higher prevalence rates of HBoV (2%) and hMPV (5%) infections [31] . It is important to note that our method of identification (culture on three cell lines), compared to molecular diagnostic methods, substantially lacked sensitivity for detecting rhinoviruses, hMPVs, and HBoVs.",

The low virus detection rates may be attributable to variations in the skills of the health staff employed to collect the respiratory specimens. The sampling method may have a significant effect on the proportion of respiratory viruses identified, and nasopharyngeal washes may yield higher sensitivity over nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs [32] . Study participants were exclusively seen in the outpatient setting, thus limiting our ability to examine the impact of respiratory viruses in hospitalized cases. A large proportion of ILI cases were not associated with any pathogen, and the impact of bacteria on this clinical syndrome cannot be determined from this study, since the respiratory samples were not cultured for bacteria. Two methods of detection were used for identification of influenza (PCR and culture) whereas only one method of detection was used for the other viruses (culture). Twenty-two percent (9/40) of the respiratory samples which were positive for influenza viruses by RT-PCR were negative by viral isolation illustrating that viral detection by culture underestimated the true prevalence. Viral culture may not be the ideal way of isolating organisms such as RSV, hMPV, HBoV and rhinoviruses leading to significant underestimation of their detection rates [33] . Despite these limitations, our study contributes information on the distribution and etiology of ILI at two hospitals in Maracay, Venezuela. This knowledge can serve as a baseline for future, more expansive population-based surveillance studies of influenza and other respiratory viruses in this region. ",

Upon the appearance of cytopathic effect or after ten days of culture (or thirteen days in the case of Vero cells), the cells were spotted onto microscope slides. Cell suspensions were dried and fixed in chilled acetone for 15 minutes. Virus isolates were identified using direct fluorescence antibody (DFA) assays. The Respiratory Virus Screening and Identification Kit (D3 DFA Respiratory Virus Diagnostic Hybrids; Athens, OH) was utilized for the identification of adenoviruses, influenza A virus, influenza B virus, parainfluenza viruses (types 1, 2, and 3), and RSV. The D3 DFA Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) identification kit and the D3 IFA Enterovirus ID kit (Diagnostic Hybrids; Athens, OH) were utilized for the identification of HSV (both HSV-1 and HSV-2) and enteroviruses, respectively. For isolation of hMPV, we used Vero E6 and LLC-MK2 cell lines. For detection of hMPV antigens by direct fluorescence assay, we used an anti-hMPV mouse monoclonal antibody from Diagnostic Hybrid (Athens, OH). All assays were performed following the manufacturers' instructions. HBoV was identified using the methods described by Salmon-Mulanovich, et al [34] . Since duplicate swab samples were analyzed in different laboratories (LARDIDEV/BIOMED-UC and NAMRU-6) with the same diagnostic kit and standard operating procedures, a virus isolation result was considered positive if the specific virus was isolated and identified at either site.",
