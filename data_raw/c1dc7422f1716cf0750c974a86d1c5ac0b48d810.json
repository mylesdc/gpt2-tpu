            "text": "Bats and rodents are widely distributed worldwide and can be native or intermediate reservoirs of many important zoonotic viruses. Pestiviruses are a group of virus species of the genus Pestivirus under the family Flaviviridae that can infect a wide variety of artiodactylous hosts, including swine and ruminants. Two classic types of pestiviruses, bovine viral diarrhea virus and classical swine fever virus, are important causative agents of mild-to-severe disease in bovine and swine hosts, respectively, and cause tremendous economic losses in these industries. Recent reports revealed that bats and rodents could also act as natural hosts of pestiviruses and an atypical porcine pestivirus, which cause disease in piglets, showed a close genetic relationship with a specific bat pestivirus, RaPestV-1. This study aimed to describe the detection and characterization of novel pestiviruses from bats and rodents in different locations by analyzing the available bat and rodent virome data from throughout China. Two bat pestivirus species and four rodent pestivirus species that are distinct from other known viruses were identified and sequenced. These viruses were identified from two bat species and four rodent species in different Chinese provinces. There were two distinct lineages present in these viruses, that differ from artiodactylous pestivirus. These findings expand our understanding of the genetic diversity of pestiviruses in bats and rodents and suggest the presence of a diverse set of pestiviruses in non-artiodactylous hosts. This study may provide new insight for the prevention of future viral disease outbreaks originating from bats and rodents.",

The polyprotein is translated from genomic RNA and translation is initiated by a cap-independent mechanism through a type IV internal ribosomal entry site within the 5 -UTR. The single polyprotein is then cleaved into four structural and eight non-structural proteins by cellular and viral proteases. Pestiviruses were previously divided into four species, including bovine viral diarrhea viruses 1 and 2 (BVDV-1 and BVDV-2), classical swine fever virus (CSFV), and border disease virus (BDV) of sheep or goats (Becher et al., 2003; Simmonds et al., 2017) . More recently, the original four species were re-classified as Pestivirus A, Pestivirus B, Pestivirus C, and Pestivirus D.",

Diseases associated with pestiviruses include hemorrhagic symptoms, abortion, respiratory disease, and fatal mucosal disease. BVDV and CSFV are severely pathogenic in cattle and swine, respectively, and are endemic in many countries (Liu et al., 2012; Chander et al., 2014) . Recently, the divergent pestiviruses, Bungowannah virus and APPV, began to be considered a threat to pig health (Kirkland et al., 2007; Hause et al., 2015) . In previous work from our lab, we found partial RaPestV-1 genome sequence in Rhinolophus bats from Hainan province in China. As such, we were the first to describe the identification of pestivirus in species outside the order Artiodactyla ). An RaPestV-1 related pestivirus, APPV, was recently discovered in North America and Europe, and was highly suspected to be the causative agent of a type A-II congenital tremor (CT A-II) in piglets (Hause et al., 2015; de Groof et al., 2016; Postel et al., 2016; Beer et al., 2017; Lamp et al., 2017) . Recently, the identification of a divergent pestivirus (Norway rat pestivirus, NRPV) in New York City suggested that Norwegian rats (Rattus norvegicus) can also serve as natural hosts for pestivirus (Firth et al., 2014) . These findings suggested a wider pestivirus host range than previously known and highlighted the need for an improved understanding of the biodiversity and evolution of pestivirus in bats and rodents.",

Each of these are consistent with the lengths of other pestivirus 5and 3 -UTR's.

RtAd-PV/SAX2015 in A. draco from Shaanxi had a partially sequenced genome, of 11,551 nt, which encoded a 3,850 aa polyprotein, denoted as a partial polyprotein. RtNe-PV/SC2014 in N. excelsior from Sichuan had an 11,644 nt partially sequenced genome, encoding a 3,759 aa partial polyprotein, and lastly, we identified RtNc-PV/SAX2015 in N. confucianus from Shaanxi with an 11,435 nt partially sequenced genome with a 3,811 aa partial polyprotein. We propose the name Rodent pestivirus (RPV) for these five pestivirus strains. The five RPVs shared similar genome sizes with one other and were each larger than all known PVs from artiodactylous hosts (Figure 3) . The polyproteins encoded by three of the five RPVs (RtAp-PV/JL2014, RtAd-PV/SAX2015, and RtNe-PV/SC2014) had 68, 69, and 77% aa identities to each other, respectively, while they had only 59% aa identity to that of NRPV, and <39% aa identity to those of BPVs and other pestiviruses.

They often live in close contact with human populations and their domestic animals, and act as a bridge between humans, domestic animals, and other wildlife, thus exposing humans to some zoonoses in these natural ecosystems (Meerburg et al., 2009; Smith and Wang, 2013; Chen et al., 2014 Chen et al., , 2017 Han et al., 2015; Olival et al., 2017) . Many viral causative agents of human and domestic animal diseases, including severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus, henipaviruses, hantaviruses, and arenaviruses, are widely recognized as having originated or been transmitted from wild bat or rodent hosts (Wang et al., 2006; Guo et al., 2013; Wu et al., 2014; Li et al., 2015b; Blasdell et al., 2016) . Recently, a novel causative agent of fatal disease in pigs known as swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus, was confirmed as being an HKU2-related alphacoronavirus that originated in horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus spp.) (Zhou et al., 2018) . Furthermore, an atypical porcine pestivirus, APPV, which caused piglet CT A-II in Europe and North America showed close resemblance to a horseshoe bat pestivirus, RaPestV-1 (Hause et al., 2015; de Groof et al., 2016; Postel et al., 2016; Beer et al., 2017) . The identification of diverse rodent arteriviruses in our recent report also revealed a much closer common ancestor of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus in the rodents pestiviruses (Wu et al., 2018b) . These new findings further emphasize the importance of bats and rodents as natural reservoirs of viruses that threaten the health of pigs and by extension, cause tremendous economic losses to the swine industry. Though a large volume of wildlife virome data has been obtained in the past decade, a predictive analysis revealed that the viral richness in wildlife is somewhat limited, and there is still a large number of \"missing potentially zoonotic viruses.\" This missing data merits further systematic global surveillance, especially in bats, rodents, and primates (Olival et al., 2017) .",

Though the virome analyses were conducted on highly diverse samples of bat and rodent species throughout the country, only two bat species in two provinces and four rodent species from four provinces were found to be FIGURE 4 | Phylogenetic analysis. Phylogenetic trees based on pestivirus (A) partial polyprotein, (B) Erns, and (C) NS3 were constructed (left). All BPVs and RPVs are labeled in red font. The evolutionary lineages of involved artiodactylous hosts (right) were drawn from genus to family according to previous reports (Jansa and Weksler, 2004; Meredith et al., 2011) , viruses of different hosts are labeled in different colors. pestivirus positive. This suggested that RPVs and BPVs are not as broadly distributed across hosts and geographical distance as other bat-or rodent-borne RNA viruses such as coronaviruses, picornaviruses, and hantaviruses (Guo et al., 2013; Du et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2016) . The hosts for BPVs can only be found in south China, while RPVs showed much broader host and geographical distributions then RPVs, with rodents in north, central, and west China serving as natural hosts of RPVs.",

Considering their divergent phylogenetic positions, different genome sizes and structures, and the minimal sequence similarities of BPVs and RPVs when compared to other pestiviruses, we propose classifying members of the genus Pestivirus into three main lineages; bat-swine, rodent, and artiodactylous lineages, based on the order level of their hosts. BPV species 1 and 2, and APPV represent the preliminary species under the bat-swine lineage, and RPV species 1-4 represent the preliminary species under the rodent lineage. Furthermore, the close relationship between APPV and BPVs indicates the presence of a much closer common ancestor of APPV in bats than in other swine pestiviruses. These viruses may have evolved independently in pigs and bats, eventually forming at least three sub-lineages under bat-swine lineage. Given that pestiviruses can cross species barriers to infect a wide range of artiodactylous animals (Becher et al., 1997) , further work should be conducted to investigate the prevalence of BPVs and RPVs worldwide and to evaluate their virulence in animal experiments.",
