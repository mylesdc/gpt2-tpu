            "text": "Collagen-induced arthritis is a B cell-mediated autoimmune disease. Recently published studies have demonstrated that in some rare cases pathogens can confer protection from autoimmunity. Trypanosoma brucei parasites are tsetse fly transmitted extracellular protozoans causing sleeping sickness disease in humans and Nagana in livestock in sub-Saharan endemic areas. In the past, we demonstrated that trypanosome infections impair B cell homeostasis and abolish vaccine-induced protection against unrelated antigens. Hence, here we hypothesized that trypanosome infection can affect the onset of CIA by specifically dampening specific B-cell responses and type II collagen antibody titers in DBA/1 prone mice. We observed a substantial delay in the onset of collagen-induced arthritis in T. brucei-infected DBA/1 mice that correlates with a drastic decrease of type II collagen titers of the different IgG isotypes in the serum. Treatment of infected mice with Berenil, a trypanocidal drug, restored the development of CIA-associated clinical symptoms. Interestingly, these data were confirmed by the challenge of immunized DBA/1 prone mice with T. brucei-infected tsetse flies. Together, these results demonstrate that T. brucei infection is impairing the maintenance of the antigen specific plasma B cell pool driving the development of CIA in DBA/1 prone mice.",

The reason is due to the fact that the developed world has managed to eradicate most infectious diseases, but has concomitantly witnessed a rise in autoimmune diseases, while the developing countries have still to battle with a number of infectious diseases with a very small percentage of autoimmune diseases [1] . These observations have led to the hygiene hypothesis, which states that the absence of early childhood exposure to infectious pathogens may give rise to an increased susceptibility to the natural development of autoimmune diseases and allergy [2] . In other words, infectious agents are constantly reshaping the immune system via the modulation of its different protagonists as well as the way they act.",

At the same time, the presence of alphabeta T cells is necessary for the induction of CIA and the IgG responses towards CII [9] . CIA is inducible in DBA/1 prone mice through immunization with heterologous CII emulsified in adjuvant and major clinical symptoms are paw swelling, cartilage damage and bone erosion [10] .

In order to avoid any interference between the parasite and the priming of the anti-CII immune response, mice were infected with T. brucei two weeks post-immunization with CII emulsified in CFA. The results demonstrated a significant delay in CIA development in the infected group, which is characterized by a significant lower mean of arthritic lesion score at day 42 ( Fig 1A) . Inflamed limb pictures taken at the same time points clearly confirmed the protective effect of T. brucei infection on the development of CIA (Fig 1B) . A delay in the incidence of arthritis defined by the number of arthritic limbs per mouse is also observed (Fig 1C) . Trypanosome infected DBA/1 prone mice started to succumb from uncontrolled parasitemia from 25 days post-infection (approximately 40 days post-immunization) onwards (Fig 1D and 1E ).

            "text": "As mentioned previously, CIA is a B cell dependent autoimmune disease as B cell deficient mice do not develop type II collagen-induced arthritis [7] . As T. brucei infection has been shown to impact B cell homeostasis in other mouse strains, we decided to follow the levels of circulating specific anti-CII Abs of various isotypes before infection, namely day 14 post CII/CFA immunization, and before the mice start dying from the infection, round day 35 post-immunization (day 20 post-infection). As expected, before T. brucei infection, the titers of specific anti-CII IgM, IgG1, IgG2a and IgG2b Ab level are similar in both CIA-induced groups (Fig 2A, 2B and 2C ). However, 35 days post-CIA in CFA priming (day 21 post-trypanosome infection), we observed a significant decrease (between 80-and 240-fold) in all anti-CII IgG isotypes titers between the infected group compared to the uninfected group (Fig 2A, 2B and 2C ), but not for anti-CII specific IgM levels ( Fig 2D) . Hence, specific IgM level was the only isotype that seems to decrease during CIA development, which is in contrast to IgG1, IgG2a and IgG2b specific Ab titers. Collectively, the data suggested that the reduced onset of CIA in T. brucei-infected mice correlates with decreased levels of circulating anti-CII specific antibodies. Treatment of T. brucei-infected mice with the anti-trypanosomal drug, Berenil, restores the development of CIA As all T. brucei-infected DBA/1 mice die within approximately 45 days post-CIA induction (30 days post-infection), we decided to treat infected mice with the anti-trypanosomal drug, Berenil, before the onset of death round day 35 post-immunization (day 21 post-infection, see arrow) and assess the development of CIA. It is important to note that the uninfected group also received the Berenil treatment in order to avoid any unspecific effects of this drug. Interestingly, T. brucei clearance from the blood circulation induces the restoration of CIA clinical symptoms. Indeed, starting one week after Berenil treatment, a gradual but drastic enhancement of the mean arthritic score per mouse was observed in the group of mice that were infected (Fig 3A) . In agreement with these results, a significant increase in the titers of anti-CII Abs belonging to the IgG2a isotype, one the main isotypes implicated in CIA development [11] , was observed between day 38 and 56 post-CIA induction in the CIA-primed and infected group of mice (Fig 3B) .",

In order to avoid any biases and to strengthen the physiological impact of our results, we decided to monitor the outcome of CIA in mice following infection using T. brucei-infected tsetse flies. It is important to note that the Berenil treatment was administered two weeks postinfection instead of three as the fly infection is more virulent (personal observation). Like the i. p. infection, the natural route of infection is also able to dampen the development of CIA (Fig  3C) , as characterized by a slower development of CIA in these mice. The more rapid increase of the CIA score following the natural route of infection might be due to the fact that Berenil treatment was administered two weeks post-infection (day 28 post-immunization, see arrow) instead of three. By day 47 post-CII priming, the mean arthritic score per mouse of the infected group tended to catch up with the one of the uninfected group as the average of both scores are well above 10. As shown previously, we observed that a physiological infection also mediates a drastic decrease in anti-CII specific IgG2a and IgG2b antibodies (Fig 3D) by day 28 postimmunization (14 days post-infection), which coincided with a delay in the onset of CIA. Following tsetse fly infection, the drug treatment restored anti-CII specific IgG2a and, to some extent, IgG2b antibody titers, which correlates with the drastic increase of the mean arthritic score per mouse.",

            "text": "One of the most studied case scenario is the inverted correlation between the distribution of auto-immune disorders and the incidence of the helminth infection worldwide [19] . This observation has even lead researchers to the helminthic therapy concept, which is based on the deliberate infestation of a helminth or the helminth eggs in order to treat auto-immune and other inflammatory disorders. Briefly, the immune response developed against the parasitic worm infection, mainly a Th2-skewed response, could counteract the immuno-pathological reactions, usually referred as Th1-polarised response, driving autoimmune diseases. For example, the CIA model we used in this study is induced in mice or rats after immunization of CII emulsified in CFA, which is known to polarize the cellular and humoral responses towards Th1 and the production of CII-specific IgG2a and IgG2b Abs. However, in this case, the T. brucei parasitic infection also drives a Th1-mediated response in mice [20] . Therefore the substantial impact of T. brucei infection on the onset of CIA cannot be attributed to the occurrence of a counter-neutralizing Th immune response as it is the case in helminth infection. However, in C57BL/6 mice, the \"early\" presence of interferon-gamma protects against the development of CIA through the suppression of Interleukin(IL)-17 [21] . Previous results by our group have put forward the impact of different African trypanosome strains on various immature and mature B cells subsets [14, 17] . In addition, we demonstrated that a T. brucei infection was able to abolish the memory or ongoing responses against unrelated antigens, such as the acellular pertussis vaccines [14, 22] . The major detrimental actors in the CIA model are the arthritogenic anti-CII specific Abs. Interestingly, we observed that the absence of RA symptoms positively correlates with a drastic decrease of CII specific Ab titers of the IgG2a and IgG2b isotypes, the main isotypes implicated in the disease [11] . In 2000, a study by Mattsson et al. showed that rats infected with T. brucei on the same day they were vaccinated with CII antigen in adjuvant, significantly exhibited a delayed onset associated with decreased titers of anti-CII IgG but without affecting T cell-mediated DTH response to CII [23] . However, postponing the infection by only a week abolishes this onset difference. These results contrast with our observation revealing a conserved shift in the appearance of the clinical symptoms of CIA even when the mice are infected two weeks post-vaccination. As T. brucei-infected DBA/1 mice succumbed from the infection within thirty days post-infection, we were not able to assess the evolution of the clinical scores beyond forty-five days post-vaccination. However, using a trypanocidal drug Berenil, we could follow the evolution of the clinical symptoms. Interestingly, we found that Berenil treatment restored the clinical signs of RA in mice that were previously vaccinated and infected. This re-emergence correlated with an increase of CII specific Ab titers of the IgG2a and IgG2b isotypes.",

The decrease incidence of RA signs starting after day 45, which is associated to the reemergence of T. brucei parasites in the blood, suggest that Trypanosomes could alleviate the clinical outcome most likely via its impact on B cells. These observations again contrast with previous results done in rats showing only a clear improvement of CIA onset when T. brucei is administered the day of immunization with CII in complete Freund's adjuvant. Other uninfectious procedures, e.g. the administration soluble CII within the eye's anterior chamber of a mouse prior the immunization with CII emulsified in adjuvant, were shown to dampen, not the B cell response, but the T cell-mediated DTH response to CII via the induction of regulatory macrophages and CD8+ T cells [24, 25] .",

DBA/1 mice were immunized primarily with CII in CFA on day 0 and secondarily with CII in IFA on day 21. One group of mice out of two was infected with T. brucei(filled and open triangle) on day 14 either i.p. or using tsetse flies and the other was left untreated (filled and open square). Both groups were treated with the trypanocidal drug, Berenil, at (A,B) day 38 (i.p.) or (C,D) day 28 (tsetse). (A) The average clinical per mouse score was followed from day 0.
