Among these, paired sera showing a fourfold increase in IgG antibody titer has been considered as a more reliable method for the diagnosis of current M. pneumoniae infection [6] [7] [8] . However, because of difficulty in obtaining convalescent serum and time constraints, IgG antibody titer tests of paired sera are an epidemiological rather than a diagnostic tool. Culture of this organism is slow [9] , and the correlation between culture and infection is tenuous because of the asymptomatic infection caused by M. pneumoniae [10, 11] . The detection of IgM antibody titer in acute stage serum and fluorescence quantitative PCR (FQ-PCR) of throat swabs are faster techniques, but until now, a direct comparison between paired sera results and the above three assays, especially the FQ-PCR kit approved by State Food and Drug Administration of China, has not been made.",

M. pneumoniae positive rates evaluated by IgM antibody testing in acute stage serum (5.6%), FQ-PCR (17.6%) and culture (16%) were lower than the result of paired sera (21.6%). Among the 27 patients positive for M. pneumoniae, only two (7.4%) were found to be positive by IgM antibody testing, 11 by FQ-PCR (40.7%) and 15 by culture (55.6%). For all of the 103 non-M. pneumoniae infections tested by FQ-PCR, hRNP gene had been successfully amplified (data not shown). Among the discordant results, eight patients showed a fourfold or greater increase in IgG titers, but had negative results in all three methods. Fifteen patients were negative by paired sera, while positive by other methods. Among them, four were positive by both FQ-PCR and culture, one was positive by FQ-PCR and IgM test, one was positive by culture and IgM test, six were positive by FQ-PCR, and three were positive by IgM test. When evaluated by the Japanese Respiratory Society (JRS) scoring system [14] , 17 patients positive by paired sera and 40 patients negative by paired sera scored \u2265 4. By using paired sera showing a fourfold or greater increase in IgG antibody titer as the \"gold standard\", diagnostic parameters of the three methods have been evaluated (see Table 3 ), including sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV respectively) and positive likelihood ratio (PLR). Specificity and NPV of all three methods were high, around 90% in specificity and around 80% in NPV. A similarly increasing trend of sensitivity, PPV and PLR was lowest in IgM antibody testing (7.4%, 28.6% and 1.45, respectively), intermediate in FQ-PCR (40.7%, 50% and 3.63, respectively), and highest in culture (55.6%, 75% and 10.9, respectively).",

            "text": "When compared with PCR, the sensitivity of culture from respiratory specimens has turned out to be as low as 61.5% [19] . Similarly, She et al. reported that culture was unacceptably insensitive for diagnosing M. pneumoniae infection [7] . In our study, however, there was no difference between the positive rates of the two methods, just as Waris et al. found in children [20] . Furthermore, the values of diagnostic parameters, including specificity, sensitivity, positive and negative predictive values and positive likelihood ratio, are the highest among the three methods evaluated here. In particular, a PLR of 10.9 means that there is a reasonable correlation between culture results and true infection. However, the prolonged turnaround time limits the clinical application of culture. Compared with serology and culture, PCR (especially real-time PCR) is more rapid, practicable and sensitive, and has been suggested to be more suitable for early diagnosis of acute M. pneumoniae infection [21, 22] . Touati et al. have evaluated five commercial kits based on PCR, and found that the sensitivities of the kits were 62-98% [23] . Similarly, Mart\u00ednez et al. observed the sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of the PCR to be 66.7%, 98.5%, 78.3% and 97.3%, respectively [16] . In the present study, however, the sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of the FQ-PCR kit targeted to 16 S rRNA gene were 40.7%, 88.9%, 50% and 84.6%, respectively. The low sensitivity of PCR testing may be due to the low bacterial load resulting from previous antimicrobial treatment or dilution of the sample in the throat swabs below the limit of detection. The detection limit of our FQ-PCR kit is stated as 10 copies per \u03bcl in the manual, which is lower than 0.1-1 copies per \u03bcl that other commercial kits reported [23, 24] . In addition, it was found that the efficiency of the PCR assay could be influenced by sample type, and sputum could be superior to other respiratory samples including throat swab [25] .",

Five patients (three positive by FQ-PCR and culture, and two positive by FQ-PCR or culture and IgM test) showed 2.5-3.8 fold increase of IgG response, which could be explained by an inadequate time interval (mean interval was 17 days). The remaining three patients (only positive by FQ-PCR) were 69, 73 and 74 years old. They failed to develop IgG antibody response in paired sera, which could be interpreted as a deterioration of the immune response due to ageing [26] .
