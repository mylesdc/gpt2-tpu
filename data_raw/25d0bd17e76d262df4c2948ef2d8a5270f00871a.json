Research findings indicate that PDCoV has evolved strategies to escape innate immune response in host cells, but mechanism of PDCoV in innate immune modulation is not well understood. In this study, we report our findings on identifying the alterations of host cell innate immune response affected by PDCoV infection and exploring the gene expression profiles of PK-15 cells at 0, 24, and 36 h PDCoV post infection by RNA sequencing. A total of 3,762 and 560 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened by comparison of uninfected PK-15 cells and infected PK-15 cells at 24 h post infection (hpi) (INF_24h versus NC), and also comparison of infected PK-15 cells between 24 and 36 hpi (INF_36h versus INF_24h), which included 156 and 23 porcine innate immune-related genes in the DEGs of INF_24h versus NC and INF_36h versus INF_24h, respectively. Gene Ontology function classification and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes signaling pathway enrichment analysis were performed based on the DEGs that exhibited the same expression tendencies with most of the innate immune-associated genes among these PK-15 cell samples described above. The enrichment results indicated that extensive gene functions and signaling pathways including innate immuneassociated functions and pathways were affected by PDCoV infection. Particularly, 4 of 5 innate immune signaling pathways, which were primarily affected by PDCoV, played important roles in I-IFN's antiviral function in innate immune response. Additionally, 16 of the host cell endogenous miRNAs were predicted as potential contributors to the modulation of innate immune response affected by PDCoV. Our research findings indicated that the innate immune-associated genes and signaling pathways in PK-15 cells could be modified by the infection of PDCoV, which provides a fundamental foundation for further studies to better understand the mechanism of PDCoV infections, so as to effectively control and prevent PDCoV-induced swine diarrheal disease outbreaks.",

In 2014, it appeared in the state of Ohio in the United States, resulted in outbreaks of diarrheal disease of piglets and sows accompanied by 30~40% mortality rates in piglets, and later rapidly spreading to several other states adjacent to Ohio [4, 5] . At present, PDCoV has been identified in multiple countries including Canada, South Korea, Thailand, and China [6] [7] [8] [9] . Although a variety of PDCoV detection approaches have been established and effectively used for diagnostic tests, such as one-step quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) assays and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) [10, 11] . However, there are still no effective treatments and control measures for swine PDCoV infections due to its mechanism of PDCoV infections is mostly remained unknown.",

When a virus invades a host cell, viral pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) are recognized by host cell pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), primarily consisting of toll-like receptors (TLRs), retinoic acid-inducible gene (RIG)-I-like receptors (RLRs), nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors (NLRs), and cytoplasmic DNA sensors. Subsequently, PRRs stimulate signaling that triggers an innate immune response inducing the production of type I interferons (I-IFNs), mainly consisting of several IFN-\u03b1 subtypes and IFN-\u03b2. I-IFNs are the major antiviral cytokines of innate immune response that mediate related responses resulting in the production of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) in order to control virus replication [12, 13, 14] .",

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) can induce the formation of acute respiratory distress in human beings and has a mortality rate close to 10%. SARS-CoV has gained widespread attention since it first emerged as a huge threat to humans in 2002. In order to explore the pathogenic mechanism of SARS-CoV, various studies have focused on cellular mechanisms, including innate immune response evasion. Kopecky-Bromberg SA et al. found that the nucleocapsid (N) protein which encoded by SARS-CoV againsts IFN-\u03b2 production by inhibiting IRF-3, the key protein necessary for the expression of IFN-\u03b2 [15] . Furtherly, Hu Y et al. found that N protein of SARS-CoV interfers with RIG-I activation and ubiquitination which mediated by tripartite motif protein 25 (TRIM25), resulting in the inhibition of IFN-\u03b2 production which achieve higher SARS-CoV replication in host cells [16] . In addition to SARS-CoV, the N protein of other coronaviruses, such as mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), has also been identified as an innate immunity antagonist. RIG-I and melanoma differentiation gene 5 (MDA5) are both PRRs that can recognize PAMPs and then activate signaling to promote I-IFN production. MHV N protein inhibits the synthesis of IFN-\u03b2 by interacting with the protein activator of protein kinase R (PACT), which can bind to RIG-I and MDA5, promoting the production of IFN-\u03b2 [17] . As an avian coronavirus, infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) escapes innate immune response by cleaving the mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS), which disrupts downstream of RIG-I and MDA5, antagonizing IFN-\u03b2 synthesis [18] .",

PDCoV acts against the innate immune response by impeding the activation of transcription factors IRF3 and NF-\u03baB, both of which are involved in the RIG-I signaling pathway disrupting IFN-\u03b2 production [19] . Nonstructural protein 5 (NSP5), which is encoded by PDCoV, antagonizes I-IFN signaling through modulation of the Jak/STAT signaling pathway by cleaving STAT2, resulting in the disruption of ISGs production [20] . The NF-\u03baB essential modulator (NEMO) is a critical constituent of the IKK complex (IKK-\u03b1, IKK-\u03b2, and IKK\u03b3) involved in downstream of RIG-I and MDA5 signaling, which is necessary for I-IFN production. The cleavage of NEMO caused by NSP5 impedes the synthesis of I-IFN [21] . In addition to nonstructural proteins, accessory proteins such as NS6 encoded by PDCoV also play an important role in the inhibition of IFN-\u03b2 production by interfering with the binding of RIG-I/ MDA5 and PDCoV [22] . However, the alteration of host cell innate immune response affected by PDCoV infection still needs to be explored. In particular, the main innate immune-associated genes and signaling pathways of host cell modulated by PDCoV have not yet been uncovered, which can hinder further discoveries regarding the mechanism of PDCoV infection.",

            "text": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a group of short noncoding RNAs known as gene regulators that can modulate extensive bioprocesses by repressing the expression of their target genes at the translation level and/or mRNA level. It has been reported that the expression of miRNAs in host cells can be changed by multiple coronaviruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) [23, 24, 25, 26] . Some of the host cell endogenous miRNAs have been found to play important roles in the modulation of innate immune response affected by coronavirus. On one hand, host cell-derived miRNAs can enhance the innate immune response to inhibit the replication of coronaviruses. For excample, miRNA-221-5p (miR-221-5p) activates NF-\u03baB signaling pathway which leads to the upregulation of I-IFN and the downstream ISGs as well as the suppression of PEDV replication [27] . On the other hand, cell endogenous miRNAs also can inhibit innate immune repsonse resulting in coronaviruses innate immune evasion. For example, inositol-requiring enzyme 1 \u03b1 (IRE1\u03b1) modulates the decreasing of miR-30a-5p which involved in the signaling pathway of miR-30a-5p/SOCS1/3, resulting in the promotion of TGEV's replication by escaping innate immune response [28] . Interferon stimulatory gene (IFITM1) is a target of miR-130a. Knockdown of miR-130a can increase the expression of IFITM1 resulting in the inhibition of HCV replication, which indicate that miR-130a directly involves in innate immune evasion of HCV [29] . As of yet, however, there has been no research into the host cell endogenous miRNAs which may involve in innate immune response modulation affected by PDCoV infection.",

Up to date, porcine innate immune genes have not been collected into a database which can be conveniently updated frequently. In addition, the anatomy, organization, and response of pig immune system are very similar to humans' [34] . Thus, the porcine innate immune genes that included in the DEGs were screened by referring to the innate immune genes list of the Inna-teDB (http://www.innatedb.ca/redirect.do?go=aboutIDB) which provides a total of 1,040 curated human genes related to the innate immune response. There were 156 and 23 swine innate immune genes that were differentially expressed in INF_24h versus NC and INF_36h versus INF_24h, respectively. In INF_24h versus NC, innate immune DEGs with 120 upregulated and 36 downregulated tendencies were identified in INF_24h compared to NC (Fig 4A) . In INF_36h versus INF_24h, 19 genes were downregulated in INF_36h while 4 genes were upregulated (Fig 4B) . Of note, most of the differential expressed innate immune genes including I-IFNs such as IFN-\u03b11 and IFN-\u03b21 (also known as IFN-\u03b2) were upregulated in cells at 24 hpi comparing to uninfected cells, and downregulated in cells at 36 hpi comparing to cells at 24 hpi, which indicated that innate immune response was initially enhanced and then inhibited in cells at 24 hpi and 36 hpi, respectively. In addition, these 2 comparison groups shared 400 DEGs (Fig 5A) . A total of 17 DEGs including IFN-\u03b11 and IFN-\u03b21 belonged to porcine innate immune-associated genes (Fig 5B) . Five of the 17 genes were randomly selected for validation via qRT-PCR, and the results showed that the relative expressions of these genes were coincident with our RNA sequencing results (Fig 6) .",

However, even in the absence of TGEV and PEDV, PDCoV has high pathogenicity, making it worthy of significant concern.

Nevertheless, we still need further research studies to completely understand the complex molecular mechanism of the alteration of innate immune response affected by PDCoV. Given this, our study focused primarily on discovering innate immune-associated genes and signaling pathways that altered by PDCoV infection in PK-15 cells. Reported studies indicated that multiple cell lines including ST, LLC-PK and IPI-2I were permissive to PDCoV [36, 37] . We found the PK-15 cell line was permissive to PDCoV in this study. However, although the degree of CPE in PK-15 cells from 24 hpi to 36 hpi showed an increasing tendency, cells at 12 h different post infection (pi) time yielded a similar virus titer. The irrelevance between the number of infected cells and virus titer at each pi time point could result from susceptibility of PK-15 to PDCoV, which was different from other cell lines of permissive to PDCoV.",
