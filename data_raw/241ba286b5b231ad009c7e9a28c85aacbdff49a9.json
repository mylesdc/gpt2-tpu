Transcription factors c-Myc, SP1, estrogen receptor, E2F-1, WT-1, NF\u03baB and MZF-2 are involved in regulation of hTERT gene expression [4] . Telomerase activity (TA), an indicator of cellular immortalization, is considered to at least partly responsible for the unlimited replication seen in immortalized cells [1, 5] . Previous studies have shown that malignant skin neoplasias, including melanoma, exhibit high levels of TA compared to benign skin conditions [6] . High levels of TA in such malignant cells may act to maintain stable telomere lengths [7] .",

In contrast, CA occasionally occurs as pigmented nodules or papules in the anogenital area, resulting sometimes in its misdiagnosis as BP [8] . Overall, high and low risk HPV types were sometimes found in BP [9, 10] . Recently, E6 oncoproteins belonging to high risk HPV types were shown to increased TA in epithelial cells, predominantly by inducing transcription of the hTERT gene [11] .

The Akt activates many downstream factors, including mTOR, which in turn activates 4EBP1 and p70S6K1. The 4EBP1 and p70S6K1 play a critical role in controlling ribosomal protein synthesis during cell proliferation [15, 16] through the phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 4E and S6, respectively.

There is a large body of data demonstrating elevated expression of IAP proteins in many human cancers [17] [18] [19] . Among them, cervical cancer cells with high risk HPV types have been investigated for the expression of IAPs family [20, 21] , however, there are no reports about the expression of those genes of HPV associated anogenital tumors. The majority of HPV associated tumor cells possess active TA, and a combination of active TA and high risk HPV oncogene proteins E6 and E7 contributes to the immortalization of primary epithelial cells. The E6 of HPV directly interacts with c-Myc, and the complex activates hTERT expression [11] . Recently, the transcription of c-IAP2, a member of the IAP protein family, was shown to be significantly upregulated by E6 and E7 oncoproteins in cells infected with high risk type HPV 16, but not in cells infected with low risk type HPV 6. Among IAPs family members, c-IAP2 is related to hTERT protein and promotes hTERT as well as c-Myc activity in E6 of HPV 16 [22] . To evaluate molecules relevant to cellular proliferation and immortalization, we examined the expression of the IAPs family members and c-Myc in CA and BP by real time RT-PCR. In addition, we present the TA level and correlate a positive TA with the frequency of p-Akt, p-S6 and p-4EBP1 expression in these tumors.",

However, BP may transform into squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the genitalia but the mechanism for the development of SCC from BP has not been defined [8] . In contrast, CA is also infected with HPV which is low risk HPV types 6 or 11. Overall, giant CA is occationally considered a low grade of SCC [8] .

Positive TA was detected in 41.7% (5 of 12) BP samples and 22.7% (5 of 22) CA samples (p = 0.025). These results suggest that higher telomerase activity is correlated with high risk HPV associated BP compared to low risk HPV associated CA. There was no evidence of increased TA in normal skin (NS) from non-sun-exposed areas. Initially, we hypothesised that increased TA could be an important tumor marker for malignant potential. As expected, this study showed a higher frequency of increased TA in BP compared with CA. Importantly, increased TA was also found in 22.7% (5 out of 22) CA samples that were associated with low-risk HPV. In general, low levels of TA are present in non-malignant skin conditions [6] . Hiyama et al. demonstrated that leukocytes constitutively express low levels of TA [31] . Therefore, this study suggested that CA with TA may be an intermittent phenomenon and that the presence of low risk HPVs was not associated with increased TA. Overall, current study suggested that only the high risk HPV E6 and E7 genes increased TA in anogenital tumors.",

The c-Myc gene acts directly or indirectly through its interaction with p53 and E6 oncoproteins, and plays an important role for the induction of hTERT protein [9] . In contrast, IAPs family (XIAP, c-IAP1 and c-IAP2) can suppress apoptosis induced by a variety of apoptotic triggers. The IAPs family can inhibit the downstream components of caspase activation pathways that regulate apoptosis. Some studies have established a circumstantial association between the IAPs family and cancer. The overexpression of several family members has been detected in several classes of human cancers [32, 33] . Among IAPs family, c-IAP2 is related to the hTERT protein and pro- Figure 3 Western blot analysis and immunohistochemical analysis for P-Akt thr308 (A), P-4EBP1 (B) and P-S6 (C) in Bowenoid papulosis and condyloma acuminatum. Western blot validation of immunohistochemical stainings showed a good correlation. Cases b and c which exhibited more than 30% expressions of p-Akt thr308 and p-S6, showed the intensity bands using frozen samples. In contrast, more than 30% expression of p-4EBP1 was detected, with double bands at 15 and 20 kDa in Cases b and c. The expression score indicates 0, >30%; 1, 30% to 60%; 2, >60%. Scale bars = 100 \u03bcm. A C B motes hTERT expression [22] . According to one study, overexpression of E6/E7 was found in high risk types HPV 16 and 18, but not in low risk type HPV 6, and an activated c-IAP2 promoter was found in E6/E7-immortalized human keratinocytes [22] . We quantitated the expression of IAPs family and c-Myc mRNA using real time RT-PCR assay in 10 BP and 15 CA samples. The levels of IAPs family members (c-IAP1, c-IAP2 and XIAP) and c-Myc mRNA expression in BP samples were higher than those in CA and normal skin samples ( Figure 2 ). The mRNA expression levels were carefully determined by performing triplicate assays. Of interest, 30% (Cases 6, 7 and 10) of BP showed significantly high expression of c-IAP1, c-IAP2 and XIAP genes compared to the other samples. Increased c-Myc expression was also found in 30% (Cases 6, 7, and 10) of BP, and was not observed in CA samples. These results supported that some BP with high risk HPV types have high levels of antiapoptosis, while CA does not have such characteristics. In Cases 6, 7 and 10, it would be necessary to remove the lesional skin, because BP may undergo transformation into SCC. In contrast, the low expression of mRNA IAPs family members in other BP and CA samples suggested limited cell proliferation and a possible tendency toward spontaneous remission.",

In general, Akt promotes protein synthesis and cell growth by alleviating TSC1/2 suppression of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), allowing the latter to act as part of the mTOR-raptor complex on 4E-binding protein 1 (4EBP1) and ribosomal protein S6 (S6) [34] . Both S6 and p70S6 kinase1 are present downstream in the Akt signaling pathway, which is not linearly associ-ated with 4EBP1 phosphorylation [35] . To date, alterations of the Akt/mTOR pathway have been observed in numerous types of carcinomas, but little has been reported about Akt/mTOR signaling in skin tumors. In the current study, although p-4EBP1 expression did not differ between CA and BP with or without positive TA, p-Akt and p-S6 were expressed significantly more often in BP and CA with increased TA than in CA and BP without TA. This result suggested that positive TA is associated with activated p-Akt and p-S6 expression but not with p-4EBP1 expression. Overall, we speculated that HPV associated anogenital tumor cells with increased TA could be correlated with activation of Akt/mTOR/p70S6K1/S6 signaling pathway but not with 4EBP1 signaling pathway. In fact, S6 and 4EBP1 are located in the downstream of Akt but they are different signal pathways [34, 35] .",

To estimate the mRNA expression of the IAPs family, each BP sample was carefully examined in triplicate. Three of 10 BP cases (Cases 6, 7 and 10) showed a higher expression level of the IAP family members compared to other samples (vs. other BP (n = 7); c-IAP1, p < 0.001; c-IAP2, p < 0.001; XIAP, p < 0.001; and vs. CA (n = 15); c-IAP1, p < 0.001; c-IAP2, p < 0.001; XIAP; p < 0.001).Although more than 27.3% of CA samples demonstrated positive TA, c-IAP1, c-IAP2, and XIAP expression levels were not significantly up-regulated when compared to the high expression levels observed in BP. This results suggested that the oncogenic proteins expressed by lowrisk HPV types did not activate c-IAP1, c-IAP2 or XIAP. The expression levels of c-IAP1, c-IAP2 and XIAP in CA were similar to the levels seen in NS (c-IAP1, p = 0.052; c-IAP2, p = 0.876; XIAP, p = 0.098). Two of 15 CA samples (Cases 12 and 13) demonstrated an increased expression of only XIAP compared to NS samples, but this expression was a rare event in other CA samples.",
