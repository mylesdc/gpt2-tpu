We previously reported that adenovirus vectored vaccines are potent in priming Ab responses, but uncertainty remains regarding the optimal approach for induction of humoral immune responses. In this study, using OVA as a model Ag, we assessed the magnitude of the primary and anamnestic Ag-specific IgG responses of mice to four clinically relevant vaccine formulations: replication-deficient adenovirus; modified vaccinia Ankara (a poxvirus); protein with alum; and protein in the squalene oil-inwater adjuvant Addavax. We then used flow cytometric assays capable of measuring total and Ag-specific germinal center (GC) B cell and follicular Th cell responses to compare the induction of these responses by the different formulations. We report that adenovirus vectored vaccines induce Ag insert-specific GC B cell and Ab responses of a magnitude comparable to those induced by a potent protein/squalene oil-in-water formulation whereas-despite a robust overall GC response-the insert-specific GC B cell and Ab responses induced by modified vaccinia Ankara were extremely weak. Ag-specific follicular Th cell responses to adenovirus vectored vaccines exceeded those induced by other platforms at day 7 after immunization. We found little evidence that innate immune activation by adenovirus may act as an adjuvant in such a manner that the humoral response to a recombinant protein may be enhanced by coadministering with an adenovirus lacking a transgene of interest. Overall, these studies provide further support for the use of replication-deficient adenoviruses to induce humoral responses.",

F or many infections-notably malaria and HIV but also numerous further diseases of humans and livestock-the induction of Ab responses by recombinant subunit vaccines is the leading approach to the development of an efficacious vaccine. Advantages of subunit vaccine approaches over liveattenuated and killed vaccines include the ability to focus im-mune responses upon a tailor-made immunogen, for example, designed to elicit responses to neutralizing or conserved epitopes. There is therefore intense interest in the development of subunit vaccine approaches with optimal humoral immunogenicity, with areas of particular interest including the optimization of peak Ab titers, recall responses to Ag, somatic hypermutation, and longterm maintenance of Ab responses.",

A considerable array of immunostimulating adjuvant approaches suitable for formulation with recombinant protein Ags have reached various stages of clinical and preclinical development (1, 2) . In parallel, extensive efforts have been made to develop replication-deficient viral vector vaccine platforms that are capable of delivering an Ag encoded as a transgene. Although originally developed primarily for their capacity to induce strong cellular immune responses-particularly CTL responses-there has more recently been considerable interest in the capacity of some viral vector vaccines to induce potent humoral responses (3) (4) (5) (6) .",

In such regimes, the use of the adenoviral prime appeared to overcome the need to formulate the boosting immunogen with a potent adjuvant to reach very high postboost Ab titers; in other words, regimes using an adenovirus prime followed by a boost using recombinant protein in an adjuvant conventionally regarded as relatively weak were capable of inducing Ab titers which matched those induced by the most potent protein/adjuvant regimes (8, 11) .

Elegant studies have delineated a number of pathways of innate immune activation that contribute to the immunogenicity of adenovirus vectors, with roles for TLR9-mediated plasmacytoid dendritic cell activation, TLR2-driven NF-kB activation, and TLR-independent activation of type I IFN driving signaling to both B and CD4 + T cells (14) (15) (16) (17) .",

There is, to our knowledge, little data comparing viral vector vaccines versus protein/adjuvant vaccines for their ability to induce GC B cell and Tfh responses (20) . Such comparisons are hindered by the fact that, in contrast to protein-only immunization, a proportion of the total immune response to viral vector vaccination is directed against structural components of the vector rather than toward the desired target (the Ag expressed from the inserted transgene). In this study, we made use of flow cytometric assays designed to identify Ag-specific GC B cells and Tfh cells to compare the induction of these cell populations by a variety of viral vector and protein/adjuvant vaccine platforms.",

This substitution has previously been reported to prevent N-linked glycosylation at this residue, resulting in expression from mammalian cells of protein with a pattern of glycosylation matching that of hen egg OVA (38) . In the AdHu5-OVA vector, the transgene was driven by an intron-containing CMV immediate-early promoter; this promoter (or closely related variants) has been used in the majority of adenoviruses, which have entered clinical trials (39) . The empty AdHu5 included the transgene promoter and polyA tail but no Ag-coding sequence. Adenoviral vaccines were grown in HEK293 T-REx cells (Life Technologies), purified by CsCl centrifugation, and titered both by UV spectrophotometry to measure viral particles (per milliliter) and by hexon immunostaining to assess infectious units (per milliliter). Particle:infectious unit ratios were 43 for AdHu5-OVA and 36 for AdHu5-empty. In the MVA-OVA vector, the transgene was driven by the p7.5 promoter inserted at the thymidine kinase locus; this is the most widely used promoter for recombinant poxvirus vaccine vectors (40, 41) . MVA vaccines were grown in chicken embryo fibroblasts, purified by centrifugation through a sucrose cushion and titered by fluorescence plaque assay using the GFP marker to measure PFUs (per milliliter).

Consistent with our previous data (8) , Ag-specific Ab responses primed by AdHu5-OVA were closely comparable to those primed by OVA protein in the potent adjuvant, Addavax, with no significant difference either before or after boost vaccination with OVA in alum. Again consistent with previous experience, responses primed by AdHu5-OVA trended to be slightly higher than those induced by OVA in alum after priming and reached significantly higher levels after boosting. There was also a small but nonetheless statistically significant difference between the responses elicited by priming with OVA in Addavax versus OVA in alum, with the former eliciting higher responses both before and after boost vaccination.

Our current data provide further support for the notion that adenovirus vectors are potent inducers of B cell responses, inducing not only IgG responses but also GC B cell and Tfh cell responses, which compare favorably to those induced by leading clinically relevant protein/adjuvant formulations. Our observation of potent Ag-specific GC B cell responses to adenoviruses goes some way toward explaining our previous data, suggesting that priming immunization with a recombinant adenovirus can overcome the requirement for the inclusion of a potent adjuvant with a protein boost to reach optimal postboost Ab titers: the robust GC responses to adenovirus-delivered transgene are likely to result in a substantially expanded Ag-specific memory B cell pool. The magnitude of adenovirus-induced memory B cell responses and the extent of somatic hypermutation-both of which are largely GCdependent processes-will clearly be worthwhile topics for future investigation.",

Unsurprisingly, both adenovirus and MVA (at doses of 10 8 infectious units and 10 7 PFU, respectively) induced larger populations of non-insert-specific GC B cells than protein/adjuvant vaccination. In the case of MVA, the non-insert-specific response was dominant to the extent that only a marginal GC B cell response was detectable to the inserted vaccine Ag: possible explanations for this might include a high ratio of viral:transgene protein expression, the transience of Ag expression after MVA immunization, and the induction of dendritic cell apoptosis by MVA (12, 48) . Although it has been observed that the ability of vaccinia to achieve Ab-mediated protection against smallpox is encouraging for the use of poxvirus vectored vaccines for Ab induction (6), caution is clearly required regarding their ability to induce responses to soluble secreted inserted Ags in Ag-naive animals. The situation in Agexperienced animals, in which the available Ag-specific B cell pool will be larger, is likely to be different: in this context, the Ag-specific B cell response to poxvirus vaccination may well constitute a considerably greater proportion of the total response. Viral vectors are better known for their ability to induce T cell responses than their induction of Ab. We and others have previously speculated that induction of Tfh cells by viral vectors could be superior to that by protein/adjuvant formulations, and that this could partly explain the robust ability of adenoviruses to prime humoral responses.",

It seems likely that, under these conditions, once a certain level of GC B and Tfh response is reached, some additional unmeasured factor becomes limiting upon the IgG response.",

Spatiotemporal association of adjuvant-induced innate immune signaling and Ag availability has been shown to be critical for the immunogenicity of other vaccine platforms (49) . Although our results do not prove that the Ag needs to be expressed from the same cell which is infected by the adenovirus vector, they suggest that the spatiotemporal linkage between coadministered protein and adenovirus is insufficiently tight to achieve adjuvanticity.",

Ultimately, the most appropriate choice of vaccine platform for a given disease target is becoming increasingly nuanced. For diseases which require the induction of Ab responses in Ag-naive subjects against proteins, which are difficult to produce with conformational accuracy in vitro-notably many viral glycoproteins and some eukaryotic parasite Ags-adenoviruses are an increasingly attractive choice.",
