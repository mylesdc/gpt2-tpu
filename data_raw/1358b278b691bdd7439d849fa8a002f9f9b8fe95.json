            "text": "A worldwide infectious disease, infectious bronchitis causes huge economic losses in poultry production systems [1] . Its etiological agent is the infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), a Coronaviridae-family gammacoronavirus whose genome is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA that is 27.6 kb in length [2] . IBV has four structural proteins, membrane (M), nucleocapsid (N), envelope (E) and spike (S). The latter is cleaved into two subunits, where S1-the principal antigen generating neutralizing antibodies-recognizes host cellular receptors and, therefore, determines the virus tropism, and S2 attaches the entire protein to the virus [2] . The non-structural protein 14 of Coronaviruses has a 3 to 5 exonuclease activity, which keeps under control the error rates in the replication process, although allowing the generation of diversity for their evolution and adaptation, thus contributing to emergence of new strains [3] . Identification of three hypervariable regions (HVR) along S1 [4, 5] is a reasonable way to evaluate structural changes in S1 and thereby determination of the homology between different strains. Understanding the changes in the primary sequence of these regions is an approach to the conformational changes observed in the tertiary one, which finally is responsible for evolution and immune escape of the virus.",

When IBV was first described in Chile [12] , the Massachusetts (Mass) strain was the only vaccine authorized by the Ministry of Agriculture. In 2009, several outbreaks were reported in flocks that had received the Mass vaccine, latter characterized as Q1 strains [13] and classified in G1-16 lineage [14] . Hence, the Ministry of Agriculture approved the introduction of the 4/91 vaccine even though the serotype was not present in Chile.",

These authors included in this lineage strains previously known as Q1, which have been previously described in South America [13, 31, 32] . However, the isolates 13885R-17, 13861R-17, 13691TR-17 and 13698SP-17 were grouped separately in the GI-13 lineage ( Figure 1 ), with strains described as 793/B, CR/88 or 4/91 [14] .

Marked differences are observed in the described hypervariable regions in S1 [4, 5, 33] [26] based on complete S1 region of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). Red lines indicate Chilean sequences. The tree is rooted in GII and GIV because they showed higher amino-acid distance from other genotypes.

Only four amino-acid differences-residues 55, 95, 181 and 303 ( Figure 2 )-could be verified along the whole S1 amino-acid sequence. Similarly, [34] found three amino-acid differences between a vaccine-like virus and the 4/91 vaccine.

Despite de Wit [36] having reviewed field viruses or vaccines recovery up to 28 weeks, this long period is mainly from feces, and the viral recovery from tracheas and kidneys is significantly lower [37, 38] . Cavanagh et al. [39] showed that passages in chicks produce a change in position 95, from alanine to serine, as observed here. Furthermore, these isolates were obtained from an outbreak in a commercial flock exhibiting clinical signs, they were not fortuitous isolations. Finally, the flock was negative for most common respiratory pathogens. Thus, the 13885R-17 and 13861R-17 isolates appear to be wild viruses derived of the 4/91 vaccine, emerging after an unquantified number of passages within the flock.",

All the samples reached S/P values over the cut-off point provided by the kit manufacturer (Table 1 ). Thus, it was possible to prove that the production of hyperimmune serum had been successful and that there was not a significant difference in the levels of optical density achieved (p-value = 0.25) in the different groups. Brooksby's criterion [30] was used to classify the antigenic relationships, unveiled with the Archetti-Horsfall method [29] , between the field strains and the Mass and 4/91 vaccines. Minor changes in the subtype were detected between virus 12101SP-09 and the Mass and 4/91 vaccines ( Table 2 ). The outbreaks between 2008 and 2010 occurred in flocks that had previously been vaccinated with the Mass strain. Nonetheless, previous assays had shown that the efficiency of the Mass-4/91 protectotype justified introduction of this scarcely related vaccination. The antigenic relationship observed between the 12101SP-09 strain and the two vaccines was also low. Finally, among the field strains, minor changes in subtype were shown for all the reactions. On the other hand, the high antigenic relationship observed between virus 13885R-17 and the 4/91 vaccination is noteworthy. Using Brooksby's criterion [30] , only minor changes were found between the two. These results align with those presented by Moore et al. [41] , which showed that at least the amino acid 304 residue would be related to the neutralizing serotype-specific epitope. In this study, the 4/91 vaccine and 13885R-17 virus showed a high antigenic relationship and were also shown to share an aspartic acid in position 304-as well the other viruses isolated in 2017-rather than the serine found in the other field viruses ( Figure 2 ). As such, the results presented here support the findings published by Moore et al. [41] , where the authors show that changes in just one or two specific residues are enough to neutralize or not neutralize a specific strain.",

These values are in accordance with the results presented by Fellahi et al. [42] in a validation for an RT-qPCR targeting 130 bp of N gene. The Ct values showed a normal distribution (Shapiro-Wilk test p-values of 0.5624). There was no difference in the Ct values of the RT-qPCR performed from the groups of birds challenged with strains 12101SP-09 and 13347SP-15 (p-value = 0.9252) (Figure 3 ).

This data are in alignment with the clinical signs and lesions observed. Thus, the higher Ct of the RT-qPCR performed from birds challenged with the virus 13885R-17 shows that the samples had a lower initial viral amount, which is because of a more efficient inhibition of viral replication by the 4/91 vaccine.

More recently, de Wit et al. [44] have shown that better levels of protection can be achieved by applying an inactivated IB vaccine after prior stimulation with attenuated Mass and 4/91 vaccines. Along these lines, Chilean poultry producers have adopted the strategy of vaccinating chicks with attenuated Mass and 4/91 vaccines during the rearing period. At the end of that period, they use an inactive Mass vaccine, which has been shown to be effective, given that the clinical outbreaks have mainly been controlled.",

Moreover, the replication of the 13885R-17 virus was more inhibited by the 4/91 vaccine compared to the viral replication obtained with the 12101SP-09 and 13347SP-15 viruses (Figure 3 ). The results presented here are consistent with those of Liu et al. [45] , who showed that birds vaccinated against IB and then challenged with homologous strains were well protected. On the other hand, if the challenge was with a heterologous strain, protection was generally variable and lower. As expected, it was possible to verify that the recently introduced 4/91 vaccine provides better protection against the strain isolated in 2017, to which it is more genetically and antigenically related. Immune response would be mainly responsible for this different protection level, however, it will be measured to elucidate the specific role of the avian immune system [46] [47] [48] . Although there is no discussion of whether the introduction of the 4/91 vaccine was appropriate for controlling the clinical problems observed in the field, the appearance of the GI-13 lineage re-opens the question regarding the anthropomorphic role in disseminating different strains in locations where they have not been described naturally.",

[16] proposed a new strategy for addressing the constant emergence of new strains-using two heterologous vaccines to develop protectotypes in order to stimulate immune response and neutralize different pathogenic strains. While the first combination described was using Mass and 4/91 vaccine strains, other combinations could also be effective. As such, studying the protectiveness of the vaccines through the concept of protectotype rather than evaluating serotypes or genotypes presents as a reasonable solution. However, constant, objective elucidation of the relationship between genotype, serotype and protectotype is vital as, in some cases, minimal changes in one of these characteristics can produce significant changes in another [49] .",

[50] found that the embryonated egg attenuation process can generate different genomic patterns in different attenuated viral populations and verified a low level of consensus among them. As such, the reversal of virulence can be achieved in different and unpredictable ways facilitated by the high rates of mutation described for IBV [31, 51, 52] . These data support growing concern about introduction of an attenuated vaccine where its pathogenic variant has not been previously described.",

However, the previous statement implies to develop new approaches for vaccines elaboration instead the use of current vaccines, reminding to keep our poultries health now, but without forgetting that it must be in a long-term way too. For more comprehensive understanding, a whole-genome approach must be taken to clarify whether the proximity to the field strains from 2017 is due to vaccine reversion by mutation and/or one or more recombination processes is involved, where the vaccinal strain has been proven to have escaped and contributed with genetic material to field viruses [32, 53, 54] . A deep epidemiological approach will also be required to evaluate the current status of viral populations so as to determine how many strains are co-circulating and any possible dominance hierarchies established among them.
