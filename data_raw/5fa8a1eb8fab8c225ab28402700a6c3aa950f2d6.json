Furthermore, >1200 bat species provide an unparalleled exhibition of variations on the mammalian theme and a broad lesson in biology (4, 5) . In recent years, bats have gained significant notoriety after being implicated in numerous emerging infectious disease events, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak 10 years ago and the current Middle East respiratory syndrome endemic (6) (7) (8) . Moreover, bats have been suggested to be important reservoir hosts of many highly lethal zoonotic viruses that can cross species barriers to infect humans and other domestic or wild mammals, including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Marburg virus, Hendra virus and Nipah virus (9) (10) (11) . Their ability to fly and social life history enable efficient virus maintenance, evolution and spread. Therefore, it is essential to enhance our knowledge and understanding of the genetic diversity of batassociated viruses to prevent future outbreaks.",

To retrieve all known sequences of bat-associated animal viruses from the public domain, we performed exhaustive searches in both the PubMed and Nucleotide databases of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) using the keyword '(bat OR bats) AND (virus OR viruses)'. The related GenBank records were then downloaded and parsed using in-house BioPerl scripts to generate readable profiles for further expert review (24) . Sequences of phages, insect and plant viruses, as well as samples derived from animals other than bats, were manually excluded. The associated metadata of each sequence, such as the sampling time, location, bat species, specimen type (e.g. feces, blood or tissues) and viral detection method (e.g. polymerase chain reaction or metagenomics), were further extracted from the related literature (if available) or the original GenBank records. Taxonomic information of all viruses and bats were retrieved from the Taxonomy database of NCBI. Additional information concerning the viruses, such as genome organization, average size and virion illustrations, and the bats, including common names, diet type and geographic distribution, were further collected from the ViralZone database (25) and the ICUN Red List (www.iucnredlist.org), respectively. The detailed phylogenetic relationships between the different bats, which were available from a previous study (26) , were also carefully integrated into the database.",

The menu panel includes several submenus for users to browse the data by categories of viruses, bats or regions (see below). The content panel can handle multiple independent pages as different tabs in the panel, which behaves like an Excel workbook that contains multiple sheets ( Figure 1D ). Any new information requested by the users is presented in an individual tab in the content panel to avoid the unnecessary refresh of entire main page. In addition, the previously viewed content pages are hidden as inactive tabs rather than closed; thus, users can easily return to any previous content by clicking on the respective tab title to reactive it instantly without any redundant data reload.",

We built a highly responsive and intuitive user interface by advanced JavaScript programming to provide users with the look and feel of a desktop application rather than a traditional web page. For example, all information tables are fully sortable and filterable with a single click on the column title, and each column is also movable and scalable (or hidden) by dragging and dropping it on the title. In addition, with a single click on the column title, a statistical pie chart of the selected information is available for easy online analyses ( Figure 2 ).

Each line of the table is expandable with a double click to show additional information, such as virus detection method, detailed sampling location, GenBank accessions and length of related sequences. Furthermore, a clickable linear map is offered for each complete viral sequence to highlight the genomic organization of the virus ( Figure 1A) . Handy buttons are provided on the bottom toolbar to export the grid as local Excel tables or to download the related sequences in FASTA format for further offline analyses. Browsing the data by virus and bat taxonomic categories is valuable to understand the host range of viruses and virome diversity of bats. For instance, from current data, the most widely distributed virus among bats is coronavirus, which has been detected from all the 10 bat families studied to date ( Table 1) . The bat family Vespertilionidae has been involved in 20 of the 23 virus families detected in bats so far (Table 1) . It is reasonable given the fact that Vespertilionidae is the biggest family of bats containing >40 genera.",

Each country/continent name offers a direct link to the respective tab in the content panel showing detailed information of the batassociated viruses detected in corresponding region. It is particularly helpful to investigate the potential distribution bias of bat-associated viruses in different regions. For example, to date, 570 and 553 bat-associated viruses were detected from 19 counties of Africa and 17 countries of Europe, respectively. Though the general data are similar between the two continents, 18 virus families are found in bats from Africa, with Paramyxoviridae as the most predominant family (36%), whereas only 10 virus families are reported in bats from Europe and the principal family is Rhabdoviridae (56%) (Figure 2 ).",

Thus, the text search utility is not only useful to quickly extract required information but also valuable to make specialized analyses on any customized subset of the data from the database. For example, both feces and swabs are widely investigated samples of bats, and >500 viruses were detected from either type of samples worldwide. However, the viruses detected from swabs involve 17 virus families, whereas those from feces are limited to 11 families. It is noteworthy that swabs are a generic sample type that include fecal swabs, rectal swabs, oral swabs, nasal swabs and others. But many studies mixed different kinds of swabs (or even different types of samples) for easy virus detection.
