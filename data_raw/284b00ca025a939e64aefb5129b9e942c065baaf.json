Beef and dairy cattle are considered the most important animal reservoirs for this pathogen. One of the important virulence characteristics of E. coli O157:H7 is the eaeA gene encoding the 97 kDa surface protein intimin. Intimin is required for attachment and effacement during the interaction of enterohemorrhagic E. coli with human and bovine neonatal enterocytes. The present study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that an adaptive mucosal immune response directed against intimin will reduce or prevent enteric colonization and fecal shedding of E. coli O157:H7 in cattle.",

Intimin is required for E. coli O157:H7 colonization, the development of attaching and effacing epithelial lesions, and disease in neonatal calves, pigs, and mice [18] . Intimin-specific antiserum can block adherence of E. coli O157:H7 to HEp-2 cells in tissue culture [19] . Calves challenged with intimin-deficient mutant bacteria do not develop diarrhea or attaching/ effacing lesions, nor are colonized to the same extent as animals infected with wild type or complemented mutant strains [20] . Earlier studies have proposed that mucosal IgA directed against intimin might serve an analogous function in vivo [21] . However, experimental challenge of cattle previously infected with E. coli O157:H7 has failed to demonstrate protective immune responses [22] , perhaps because E. coli O157:H7 generate very low titers of specific mucosal IgA responses directed against intimin or other E. coli O157:H7 antigens [23] . E. coli O157:H7 colonization of mice can be reduced when the animals are fed recombinant tobacco expressing intimin [24] . It is suggested that intimin on the surface of EHEC would bind to nucleolin [25] . The present study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that a specific adaptive mucosal immune response directed against the surface antigen intimin might prevent or reduce the colonization of E. coli O157:H7 in cattle.",

Vaccination of cattle has significant potential as a pre-harvest intervention strategy to reduce E. coli O157:H7 shedding. However, the ability of intimin to elicit protective immune responses in the bovine intestinal tract has not previously been demonstrated.

Dublin shedders in both vaccinated groups at the end of experiment were similar as observed in other studies in which vaccine strains administered to cattle were shed for a considerable period of time [31] . From 35-70 days post-inoculation, the S. Dublin vector control strain was detectable in a significantly higher proportion of calves than the intimin-expressing S. Dublin vaccine strain. Levels of intimin-specific IgA in serum and feces were not significantly higher in calves receiving intimin-expressing S. Dublin.

Intimin interacts not only with Tir, but also with host cell intimin receptor(s) on the luminal surface of intestinal epithelia, including integrin and nucleolin [43, 44] . These receptors are potentially accessible as binding sites for intimin during vaccination with recombinant S. Dublin. While antibodies directed against either Tir or intimin might impede intimin-Tir interactions, antibodies to intimin might be anticipated to inhibit EHEC binding to alternative host receptors as well. Recently, it has been shown that vaccination with a combination of antigens associated with type III secretion system-mediated adherence; the translocon filament protein, EspA, the extracellular region of the outer membrane adhesin, intimin, and Tir significantly reduced shedding of EHEC O157 from experimentally infected animals [45] .",

            "text": "In our study, initial shedding of E. coli O157:H7 after challenge was comparable in the groups receiving either vector or intimin-expressing S. Dublin, and significantly lower than in the control group. Earlier studies have indicated that E. coli persists (a challenge dose of 10 9 ) for days to weeks in the bovine intestinal tract before being cleared [46] . Similar results were observed in this study; however, it is important to note that the challenge dose in the present study was higher (10 10 ). The polynomial trendline revealed that E. coli O157:H7 was cleared more rapidly from vaccinated calves than from control or vector-vaccinated animals. This provides evidence in support of the principle that potentiation of immune responses to intimin at the mucosal surface can reduce shedding of the pathogenic E. coli O157:H7 strain. Also, the possibility of interaction of various components of adaptive immunity due to initial Salmonella (vector) infection could not be ruled out [47] . We originally hypothesized that the protective responses would be related to fecal concentrations of intimin-specific IgA. However, the mechanism of vaccine protection is clearly more complex, as anti-intimin fecal IgA levels did not correlate with fecal shedding. Enteric mucosal IgA responses against intimin and type III secreted proteins were identified in rectal mucus and in the rectal tissue respectively [48, 49] . These studies definitely indicate the importance of other clinical samples (tissue and rectal mucus) for studying the mucosal immune response. Moreover, protection against enteric pathogens by immunization does not essentially require secretory IgA [45] , and intestinal clearance of intimin-expressing Citrobacter rodentium has been shown to require B cells and IgG antibodies, but not secretory IgA [45] . Importantly, intimin-specific antibody titers in colostrum and serum of dams were found to be increased after parenteral vaccination with intimin [50] . In another study, immunization of calves with the cell-binding domain of intimin subtypes beta or gamma via the intramuscular route induced antigen-specific serum IgG1 and, in some cases salivary IgA responses, but did not reduce the magnitude or duration of faecal excretion of EHEC upon subsequent experimental challenge [51] . The role of IgG in intiminexpressing vaccine induced protection of calves is worthy of further investigation.",

However, oral vaccines can significantly boost mucosal immune responses when primed by parenteral vaccine administration [52, 53] . Parenteral priming of the immune system facilitates the gut associated lymphoid tissue to react more rapidly to antigens delivered by oral immunization, and may decrease the likelihood of inducing oral immune tolerance [24] . Another possible explanation for the modest degree of reduction in colonization and shedding of E. coli O157:H7 may be that intimin-specific mucosal IgA was already present prior to immunization. Thus, this anti-body may have interfered with ability of the intiminexpressing S. Dublin vaccine strain to effectively reach gut-associated lymphoid tissue and augment local immune responses. One limitation to the present study is the need for replication in outbred populations of cattle having a more defined immune status.",
