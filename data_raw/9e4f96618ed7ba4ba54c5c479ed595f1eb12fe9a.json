The aim of this study was to construct an RNA-positive control based on armored (AR) RNA technology, using HIV-1 RNA as a model. Methods: The MS2 maturase, a coat protein gene (at positions 1765 to 1787) and HIV-1 pol gene were cloned into pET-32a plasmid. The prepared plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL2 (DE3), and the expression of the construct was induced by 1 mM of isopropyl-L-thio-D-galactopyranoside (IPTG) at 37 \u00b0C for 16 h to obtain the fabricated AR RNA. The AR RNA was precipitated and purified using polyethylene glycol and Sephacryl S-200 chromatography. Results: The stability of AR RNA was evaluated by treatment with DNase I and RNase A and confirmed by transmission electron microscopy and gel agarose electrophoresis. Tenfold serial dilution of AR RNA from 10 1 to 10 5 was prepared. Real-time PCR assays had a range of detection between 10 1 and 10 5 . In addition, R 2 value was 0.998, and the slope of the standard curve was -3.33. Conclusion: Prepared AR RNA, as a positive control, could be used as a basis for launching an in-house HIV-1 virus assay and other infectious agents. It can be readily available to laboratories and HIV research centers. The AR RNA is non-infectious and highly resistant to ribonuclease enzyme and can reduce the risk of infection in the clinical laboratory.",

The MS2 is a single-stranded RNA (+ssRNA) virus with positive-H sense strand and icosahedral capsid, which belongs to the Leviviridae family. Its genomic size is nearly 3.6 kb, which encodes four proteins, including coat protein, maturase protein (A-protein), lysis protein, and replicase protein [6] . The MS2 attaches to the fertility factor (F) on the E. coli and enters the bacteria using maturase protein. After entering the bacteria, the viral RNA acts as messenger RNA and translates into structural proteins. In the MS2 assembling stage, one molecule of viral +ssRNA, one copy of the maturase protein (A-protein), and 180 copies of coat (14 kDa) protein are required [7] .",

The RT reaction lasted for 35 min at 50 \u00b0C, followed by a denaturation step for 15 min at 95 \u00b0C and 12 cycles of 15 s at 95 \u00b0C, 35 s at 62 \u00b0C, and 35 s at 72 \u00b0C without fluorescent collection, followed by 40 cycles of 10 s at 94 \u00b0C, and annealing and extension for 40 s at 60 \u00b0C. The fluorescent signal was acquired at the annealing-extension step at 60 \u00b0C. Figures 1 and 2 illustrate the MS2 maturase, coat protein gene, and HIV-1 pol gene (336 bp), which were obtained by RT-PCR from MS2 RNA (Roche, Germany) using Superscript\u00ae III One-Step RT-PCR System with Platinum\u00ae Taq High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase kit (Invitrogen, USA).",

            "text": "Polymerase chain assays are commonly used, both quantitatively and qualitatively, for the diagnosis and evaluation of viral load in HIV-infected patients [15, 16] . There are a number of methods, such as in vitro transcription, for producing positive RNA as an internal or external control in PCR assay [17] . RNA molecules are unstable in hard conditions such as high pH and high temperatures. In addition, RNA is easily degraded in the presence of divalent cations. Moreover, RNase is abundant in the environment; even minor contamination makes the RNA molecule extremely vulnerable [18] . Therefore, the synthesis of RNA and improvement of its stability are very important for the nucleic-acid-based assays. In the past decade, AR RNA technology has been developed to improve the stability of RNAs, used as standard or control in clinical diagnostic assays. Based on the use of AR RNA technology, target RNA was synthesized in E. coli by transformed plasmid and assembled along with the phage genome in the MS2 capsid; these PLPs contain the target sequence and are resistant to ribonuclease enzyme. The aim of current study is the constructing the positive-control RNA based on AR RNA technology, using HIV-1 RNA as a model. To construct the positive-control AR RNA, 1751 bp of MS2 genome containing maturase, coat, and packaging sequence was cloned into pET32a plasmid. Moreover, 336 bp of pol conserved region of the HIV-1 genome was ligated downstream of MS2 gens in pET32a. The recombinant plasmid was transferred into E. coli strain BL2 (DE3), and the AR RNA was assembled following to IPTG induction. We also have shown the durability of AR RNA in the presence of ribonuclease enzyme. The sequence of coat gene that has an overlap region with lysis gene of the phage was mplified with PCR to prepare the plasmid that could produce large numbers of PLPs without bacterial lysis. Therefore, the produced PLPs were not infectious in accordance to biosafety concerns. Comparison between the stability of armored (AR) RNA and naked RNA at -4 \u00b0C. The concentration of naked and AR RNA was estimated by measuring the OD absorbance at 260 nm (Thermo Scientific\u2122 NanoDrop\u2122). AR RNA was stable, but the naked RNA rapidly degraded.",

In the present study, RNA sequence (336 bp of HIV-1 CRF-AD35) was encapsulated into the MS2 PLP using pET32a expression vector in E. coli DE3 (BL-21) strain. 1 2 pM 3 The current PLP purification method involves the combined use of gradient ultracentrifugation, column chromatography, CO 2 affinity chromatography, RNAprotein complex, and electroelution from an agarose gel with a GeBAflex-tube [22, 23] . In the present study, PLPs were precipitated with PEG 6000 and further purified with Sephacryl S-200. The AR RNA was stable after treatment with DNase I and RNase A; this result is similar to other previous studies [14, 24] . In another study, a part of the HIV-1 virus genome was packed in the MS2 phage capsid, and the PLPs were assembled based on AR RNA technology. Moreover, in a study by Burchard et al. [25] , the cyber green dye was used to perform PCR reaction, but in the present study, we used the TaqMan method that is more specific than dsDNA-binding dye. Furthermore, in other studies [26] , MS2 phage was used as an internal control for monitoring the cDNA synthesis steps in clinical specimen and nucleic acid preparation process, including lysis of the pathogen. In addition, the AR RNA was challenged by ribounuclease enzyme, and the stability of AR RNA was compared with naked RNA. The results of current study indicated that the stability of AR RNA in the presence of ribonuclease enzyme and durability of AR RNA and naked RNA was similar to previous studies [27, 28] . In the current study, PLP standard was prepared and used as a positive control in real-time RT-PCR. The duplicate of real-time RT-PCR assay had high sensitivity, and the LoD of the channel (FAM) was 10 1 copies/\u00b5l of AR RNA, indicating a constantly high amplification efficiency (>99%).",
