            "text": "Background: Few longitudinal studies examine inflammation and lung function in asthma. We sought to determine the cytokines that reduce airflow, and the influence of respiratory viral infections on these relationships. Methods: Children underwent home collections of nasal lavage during scheduled surveillance periods and selfreported respiratory illnesses. We studied 53 children for one year, analyzing 392 surveillance samples and 203 samples from 85 respiratory illnesses. Generalized estimated equations were used to evaluate associations between nasal lavage biomarkers (7 mRNAs, 10 proteins), lung function and viral infection. Results: As anticipated, viral infection was associated with increased cytokines and reduced FVC and FEV 1 . However, we found frequent and strong interactions between biomarkers and virus on lung function. For example, in the absence of viral infection, CXCL10 mRNA, MDA5 mRNA, CXCL10, IL-4, IL-13, CCL4, CCL5, CCL20 and CCL24 were negatively associated with FVC. In contrast, during infection, the opposite relationship was frequently found, with IL-4, IL-13, CCL5, CCL20 and CCL24 levels associated with less severe reductions in both FVC and FEV 1 . Conclusions: In asthmatic children, airflow obstruction is driven by specific pro-inflammatory cytokines. In the absence of viral infection, higher cytokine levels are associated with decreasing lung function. However, with infection, there is a reversal in this relationship, with cytokine abundance associated with reduced lung function decline. While nasal samples may not reflect lower airway responses, these data suggest that some aspects of the inflammatory response may be protective against viral infection. This study may have ramifications for the treatment of viral-induced asthma exacerbations.",

We [8] and others [9] [10] [11] [12] have examined the innate immune response of children with asthma to natural colds. We found that nasal aspirate cytokine levels significantly increased in children with asthma. In addition, we found that a subset of cytokines (IFN-\u03b3, CXCL8, CCL2, CCL4, CCL5, and CCL20) correlated with self-reported respiratory tract symptoms. However, we did not examine the influences of viral infection or nasal cytokines on airway function. Further, by limiting comparisons to samples taken during virus-negative well periods and viral-induced exacerbations, we ignored the potential effects of subacute viral infection. Finally, our cross-sectional study did not allow us to examine patterns of variables over time, which could provide more consistent information about the cytokines that drive lung function changes in chronic asthma.",

In addition to collecting measures of asthma health, we collected nasal lavage for detection of viral infection and measurement of respiratory tract cytokines and other biomarkers, and performed spirometry to assess lung function. We sought to determine the cytokines that drive reduced airflow, together with the influence of viral infections on these relationships. We hypothesized that children with greater respiratory tract inflammation would demonstrate worse airway function, and that viral infections would increase inflammation and negatively impact asthma symptoms and airway function.

The questionnaire included demographic information, eight symptom questions, and if their child had ever been diagnosed by a medical care provider with any of the following conditions: asthma, bronchitis, bronchiolitis, reactive airways disease, pneumonia, or asthmatic bronchitis. In addition, parents were asked whether their child had taken prescription medication for any of these conditions in the last 12 months and, if so, whether they were taking these medications on a daily basis. Classification of asthma severity was based on symptom frequency and reported inhaled steroid use (Additional file 1: Table  S1 ). This study was approved by the University of Michigan Medical School Institutional Review Board (IRBMED) (ID# HUM00018442) and conducted according to CBPR principles under the auspices of the CAAA Steering Committee.",

Staff would tally the symptom score over the phone and when symptoms reached the appropriate threshold, would begin a \"sick period\" assessment within 48 h of the phone call (median time to first sample was 72 h after the development of symptoms). Staff also conducted weekly telephone calls to identify illnesses in progress that families may not have called in to report, and would initiate a \"sick period\" collection if family reported that the child had current symptoms.",

We anticipated that, in the absence of virus, children with greater airway inflammation would demonstrate worse airway function. Consistent with this, in the absence of viral infection, several nasal lavage biomarkers correlated negatively with lung function. For example, CXCL10 mRNA, MDA5 mRNA, CXCL10, IL-4, IL-13, CCL4, CCL5, CCL20 and CCL24 were each negatively associated with FVC. We also expected that viral infections would increase inflammation and negatively impact airway function. Accordingly, we found that viral infection had independent positive associations with nearly all nasal lavage biomarkers and, in subjects with moderate-to-severe persistent asthma, negative influences on FVC and FEV 1 . However, we found many cases in which there was a significant interactive effect between viral infection and lung function, in that the simultaneous presence of viral infection and high cytokine levels was associated with less severe reductions in lung function. Among other associations, in the presence of a virus, IL-4, IL-13, CCL5, CCL20 and CCL24 each positively correlated with both FVC and FEV 1 . Thus, whereas airway inflammation is associated with reduced lung function in the absence of viral infection, cytokine expression is associated with a diminution of lung function deficits caused by viral infection.",

On the other hand, an exuberant response to RV, a virus that infects relatively few airway cells [23, 24] and possesses minimal cytotoxic effects compared to influenza or adenovirus [25] , could be maladaptive. In a mouse model of RV infection, CXCR2 [26] and TLR2 [27] null mice both show reduced airway inflammation and responsiveness but no change in viral load, suggesting that cytokines mediate RV-induced tissue injury. However, in the present study, we show that, in the context of respiratory viral infection, higher expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines is associated with less severe reductions in lung function. This study may have ramifications for the treatment of viral-induced asthma exacerbations. For example, treatments aimed at reducing the expression of specific pro-inflammatory cytokines may reduce symptoms but also attenuate the potential protective effects of these cytokines on lung function. Indeed, a recent multicenter study of children admitted to the emergency department for asthma exacerabtions showed that viral detection was associated with failure of management with oral corticosteroids and inhaled bronchodilators [28] .",

While there were significant overlapping ranges between the asthma severity groups, these data, obtained from asthmatic subjects experiencing natural colds, do not support the concept that patients with severe asthma have deficient antiviral responses [50] [51] [52] . On the other hand, our data are consistent with a recent study showing that, following experimental RV infection, subjects with allergic asthma show greater levels of nasal and bronchial cytokines, chemokines and IFNs compared to control subjects [53] . In addition, the absence of a reduction in viral-induced mRNA or protein expression in children with moderateto-severe persistent asthma demonstrates that the positive associations we found between nasal lavage cytokine level and lung function are not due to increased cytokine production in subjects with better lung function.",

            "text": "There are several limitations to our study. First, we used nasal lavage to sample the respiratory tract of children with asthma. This method allowed repeated collection of samples from children as young as 5 years-old in a relatively non-invasive manner. While previous studies have shown that gene expression among asthmatic children is altered similarly in nasal and bronchial airways [53, 54] , measurements of nasal lavage cannot actually represent the airway biology, and we did not validate our method by comparing our results with lower respiratory tract specimens such as sputum, breath condensate or bronchoalveolar lavage. Second, we studied a relatively small number of children (n = 53). Third, we found that 26.1% of surveillance samples were positive for virus, compared to 33.7% of self-reported respiratory illnesses. Thus, subjects were only slightly more likely to have a virus during self-reported sick periods than during surveillance sample collection. We believe the low viral detection rate during symptomatic episodes can be explained by the fact that samples from symptomatic illnesses were not collected in the fall and instead were only collected from January to August, when rhinovirus infections are less prevalent. Cold-like illnesses were unlikely to represent false-negative viral infections, as they were unaccompanied by increases in nasal aspirate MDA5, a doublestranded RNA pattern recognition receptor which was increased in virus-positive samples and has been shown to be induced following RV infection [55] . Nor were cold-like illnesses associated with reduced pulmonary function. Also, the symptom threshold for \"sick\" sample collection was quite low (2 or more). The reasoning behind this was to increase the likelihood of capturing viral illnesses for study. We also offered a $50 financial reimbursement for each sick period assessment which served to offset the family time and effort needed to participate in sick assessment/nasal secretion collection. These design elements contributed to a low viral detection rate. For example, a symptom score of two could be achieved simply with a runny and stuffy nose, which could easily represent allergic rhinitis rather than a cold. Fourth, despite extensive training and coaching in spirometry, many expiratory maneuvers were excluded due to inadequate data quality. We have evaluated the impact of our data cleaning procedures and found no systematic exclusion of children compared to the overall study population, and thus feel these procedures are unlikely to introduce selection bias. Fifth, the current analysis evaluates associations between biomarker levels, viral detection, and spirometry obtained on the same day, and does not evaluate for the possibility of lagged effects. Sixth, some of our assessments, such as medication use, asthma severity, and atopy, were based on self-report and were not independently validated, leaving open the possibility of measurement error. Seventh, our data from urban children with asthma may not be generalizable to other groups of asthmatic children. As we have shown previously [14] , these children tend to be undertreated, as reflected by the number of subjects who were not taking medication (and therefore labeled as \"intermittent asthmatics\"). Urban children with asthma who are not treated with inhaled steroids may be more susceptible to viral-induced reductions in airway function than suburban children [56, 57] . Eighth, we did not take into account bacterial colonization in our study. Bacterial colonization could alter the response to rhinovirus infection [58] .",

Detroit has a history of elevated air pollution and nonattainment of the ozone and particulate matter standards [59] . We previously examined relationships between lung function and ambient levels of ozone and particulate matter in a longitudinal cohort study of school-age children with asthma in Detroit [7] . In a two-pollutant model including PM 10 and O 3 , there was an association between O 3 exposure and diurnal variation of FEV 1 1 day after exposure in children without self-reported cold symptoms and a larger odds ratio for children with cold symptoms. It is therefore conceivable that specific pollutants could have intensified the effects of viral infection on lung function.",

These data firmly establish the link between airway inflammation and asthma severity in a longitudinal cohort of children with stable asthma. However, in the presence of viral infection, there is a reversal in the relationship between nasal cytokines and clinical outcome, with higher levels correlating with less severe reductions in lung function. While nasal samples may not reflect lower airway responses, these data suggest that some aspects of the inflammatory response may be protective against viral infection. This study provides new insight into the host response to respiratory viral infections, and may have ramifications for the treatment of viral-induced asthma exacerbations.",
