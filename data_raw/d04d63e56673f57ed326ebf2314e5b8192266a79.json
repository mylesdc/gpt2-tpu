            "text": "During summer 2007 Italy has experienced an epidemic caused by Chikungunya virus -the first large outbreak documented in a temperate climate country -with approximately 161 laboratory confirmed cases concentrated in two bordering villages in North-Eastern Italy comprising 3,968 inhabitants. The seroprevalence was recently estimated to be 10.2%. In this work we provide estimates of the transmission potential of the virus and we assess the efficacy of the measures undertaken by public health authorities to control the epidemic spread. To such aim, we developed a model describing the temporal dynamics of the competent vector, known as Aedes albopictus, explicitly depending on climatic factors, coupled to an epidemic transmission model describing the spread of the epidemic in both humans and mosquitoes. The cumulative number of notified cases predicted by the model was 185 on average (95% CI 117-278), in good agreement with observed data. The probability of observing a major outbreak after the introduction of an infective human case was estimated to be in the range of 32%-76%. We found that the basic reproduction number was in the range of 1.8-6 but it could have been even larger, depending on the density of mosquitoes, which in turn depends on seasonal meteorological effects, besides other local abiotic factors. These results confirm the increasing risk of tropical vector-borne diseases in temperate climate countries, as a consequence of globalization. However, our results show that an epidemic can be controlled by performing a timely intervention, even if the transmission potential of Chikungunya virus is sensibly high.",

CHIKV is an arthropod-borne virus which can be transmitted to humans by Aedes mosquitoes [2] , widespread in some tropical regions [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . Aedes albopictus is highly competent for CHIKV [9, 10] . In Italy, the presence of this mosquito was first documented in Genoa and Padua (Northern Italy) in the earliest 1990's [11, 12] . Over the following years, Aedes albopictus expanded its distribution and is now well established in Northern and Central Italy [13, 14] . Having the potential to colonize the Mediterranean basin [15] , the species has been reported from most Mediterranean European countries [16] . Samples of Aedes albopictus from the two villages were found to be positive for CHIKV sequences [1] .",

The square error Err between predicted and observed length of the egg hatching period is defined as Err~P T[T ? (e T {l E (T; P)) 2 . ParametersP P were estimated by minimizing Err. The variances s 2 was computed as the average of the estimated residuals of the model (i.e., the average of the quadratic differences of (e T {l E (T;P P)) 2 between the observed data and the best model fit l E (T;P P)). The uncertainty of the parameters was estimated by using a technique similar to that used in [33] .

The mean egg density for the region of interest was found to be in the interval \u00bd46:6{63:2 per ovitrap per week. Firstly, we estimated the carrying capacity of a single breeding site as the value K b giving rise (through simulation of model (1), where all other parameters are known) to an estimated weekly incidence of eggs in the observed range (\u00bd46:6{63:2) at temperatures observed in June and July. We estimated K b to be 19 in average (95% CI [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] . The carrying capacity of the study region can be computed as K E~B K b H, where B is the density of breeding sites (number per ha) and H~70 ha is the surface of the study area. The exact number of breeding sites (public and private catch basins, stagnant pools of water, etc.) in the area at the time of the epidemic is unknown. Hence, in this study we considered different values of B, namely 50, 100, 150 and 200 ha {1 , in order to describe different (high) densities of mosquitoes, as those observed in the study area [1] . These different scenarios are thus characterized by average values of of the carrying capacity K E in the range \u00bd66500{266000.",

Since 2008 a monitoring activity has been carried out in order to estimate the water temperature (a key parameter in the developmental stages) of breeding sites. In fact, most of Aedes albopictus life stages develop in aquatic micro-environment. Specifically, a linear regression model was used to estimate the daily mean water temperature as a function of daily mean, maximum and minimum air temperature and daily mean air relative humidity (see Fig. 2a ). This allowed us to get estimates of the water temperature for the 2007 season in order to get a more truthful calculation of developmental rates for eggs hatching and immature stages (larvae and pupae), impossible to obtain otherwise.",

Besides parameters more strictly related to the infectious process, R 0 is an increasing function of the square of k, as the biting rate controls transmission from humans to mosquitoes and from mosquitoes to humans, and the ratio of vectors to humans N v =N h (see Fig. S5 ). However, it should be considered that Eq. (8) depends on the number of vectors N v which substantially varies over time as a results of seasonal meteorological factors. Thus, as for models explicitly considering seasonal variations in transmission, it is difficult to precisely define R 0 . Therefore, we computed R 0 by considering the average value of N v from June 21 to July 26 2007 (i.e. the initial phase of the epidemic), as predicted by the vector dynamics model. We estimated R 0 to be 3.3 on average (95% CI 1.8-6, see Fig. 4e ). Fig. 4d shows that R VH 0 is below the critical threshold for all vales of B and thus the epidemic is mainly determined by R HV 0 , i.e. by transmission from humans to vectors. As for the effective reproduction number R e (i.e., the average number of secondary cases generated per primary case at a given time), which accounts for both depletion of susceptible individuals and mosquito dynamics, its value over time is shown in Fig. 4c and Fig. 4f (by considering or not interventions) . It emerges that R e , which does not change much by varying the number of breeding sites, can vary substantially over time as an effect of mosquito dynamics. This suggests that R 0 could have been even larger, depending on the time of epidemic seeding.",

This could explain why cities like Cesena (96,000 inhabitants), Rimini (141,000 inhabitants) and Bologna (377,000 inhabitants) and Ravenna (157,000 inhabitants) located in the same region of the two most affected villages did not experience any epidemic outbreak, though sporadic CHIKV cases were recorded in the same period [1, [42] [43] [44] .

Results are similar for other choices of B (for instance, for B = 50 ha {1 the figure becomes 8:5%, 95% CI 5.3%-13%; see also Fig. S6 ). To keep track of the number of symptomatic cases identified by the active surveillance system, we assume that human symptomatic cases are identified with probability p n and this allows fitting notification data in model simulations. According to model estimates, the number of notified cases would have been about 185 on average (95% CI 117-278), in good agreement with the number as reported to the surveillance system, namely 161 cases [1] . The number of cases drastically decreased in late August while the effective reproduction number, in the absence of interventions, would have fallen below the epidemic threshold in late September (see Fig. 4c and Fig. 4f) . This proves that a combined strategy resulted in a drastic reduction of the epidemic impact, despite the relatively large value of R 0 .",

Quite the contrary, adulticides were used for a very limited period of time (3 days) and thus their effect is limited due to the rapid increase of adults suddenly after the intervention. Overall, these results suggest that only a combined intervention, as the one performed during the outbreak, can result in a drastic decrease of the number of cases.",

The two affected villages account for the 2.1% of the population of the municipalities of Cervia (27,000 inhabitants) and Ravenna (157,000 inhabitants). By analyzing commuting data of the Emilia-Romagna region [47] , we found that the number of individuals traveling daily to Cervia and Ravenna for work or study is 8,787 (from 249 different municipalities), and the number Figure 6 .

The exact number of commuters for Castiglione di Cervia and Castiglione di Ravenna is unknown but it should not exceed 2.1% of the overall number of commuters. However, the probability of traveling from/to a certain municipality should be similar to that observed for the two municipalities as a whole and we found that clusters of local transmission were recorded in municipalities well connected with the municipalities of Ravenna and Cervia (see Table 4 ). For at least four of the five clusters, population movement (i.e., persons who visited the area that was primarily affected or persons from the primarily affected area who visited one of the four towns) can be reasonably assumed to have been the main determinant of local transmission. Another possible explanation is passive vector mobility (e.g. infected mosquitoes transported by car from the initial cluster), since the flight range (active mobility) is usually considered to be less than 1 km [35, 48, 49] .",

            "text": "Our results suggest that the transmission potential of CHIKV in Italy was similar to the one observed in tropical regions where Chikungunya fever is widespread (e.g., Reunion Island, where the best estimate for the initial R 0 was 3.7 [3] ). Specifically, we estimated R 0 to be in the range of 1.8-6. However, being the reproduction number strongly dependent on the density of mosquitoes, which in turn varies a lot over time as a consequence of seasonal meteorological effects, different (even larger) values of R 0 could be observed in future outbreaks, depending on the time of epidemic seeding. In [3] , by adapting a method originally introduced in [50] for human-to-human infections, R 0 was estimated from the generation interval probability distribution function and the number of gonotrophic cycles of the mosquito. This method can not be applied in our study, as the undertaken control measures have contributed to alter the gonotrophic cycles of the mosquito in a indeterminable manner. We found that the probability of observing a major outbreak after the introduction of an index case depends on the ratio of mosquitoes to humans and was estimated to be in the range of 32%-76%. These results confirm the high risk to Europe of tropical vector-borne diseases as a consequence of globalization, which has been modifying the mobility of humans and vectors. Climate changes could have been playing a role, as the geographical limits of mosquito-borne diseases can be influenced by climate [51, 52] , but this is still debated [53] [54] [55] .",

Therefore, even if the transmission potential of Chikungunya virus could be sensibly high also in temperate climate countries, the epidemic can be controlled by performing timely interventions.",

We assume exponential distribution for all parameters of model M related to the length of the different periods (e.g. latency, infectiousness, etc.), though it would be preferable to use multiple classes within each group to give more realistic gamma distributed lifetimes (see for instance [56] ). We assume density-dependent growth only in eggs, though other density-dependent regulating processes should be considered for other lifestages of the mosquitoes, e.g. larvae and pupae [25] . These modeling choices are due to the lack of data for parametrizing the model. The lack of information on the actual number of breeding sites -it could be assessed only by performing a field study -prevent us to give precise estimates on the density of mosquitoes over time in the study area. However, we would note that our estimates of R 0 , attack rates and probability of major outbreak are robust with respect to assumptions on the number of breeding sites. Moreover, the temporal dynamics of the vector is qualitatively well captured by model M (though not in terms of absolute abundance) and this allowed us to clarify whether or not the sharp decrease in the number of cases observed after the intervention was due to the intervention itself or to the spontaneous reduction of adults due to decrease of temperature. Definitely, a key lesson learnt from the analysis of the Chikungunya outbreak in Italy is the necessity to improve tools for obtaining reliable, though costly, estimates of the vector density (see for instance [57] ) -thus bypassing the necessity of developing ad-hoc models. The proposed model, describing the temporal dynamics of Aedes albopictus, provides a valid alternative in the absence of reliable field data.",
