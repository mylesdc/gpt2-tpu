To fabricate the nanolayer on the PET substrate, Au is sputter coated on the flexible PET substrate and MoS 2 NPs are spin coated on Au, which is sputter coated once again with Au. The gp120 antibody is then immobilized on this flexible electrode through cysteamine (Cys) modified on the surface of the Au/MoS 2 /Au nanolayer. Fabrication of the biosensor is verified by atomic force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and cyclic voltammetry. A flexibility test is done using a micro-fatigue tester. Detection of the gp120 is measured by square wave voltammetry. The results indicate that the prepared biosensor detects 0.1 pg/mL of gp120, which is comparable with previously reported gp120 biosensors prepared even without flexibility. Therefore, the proposed biosensor supports the development of a nanomaterial-based flexible sensing platform for highly sensitive biosensors with flexibility for wearable device application.",

Figure 3a -c shows AFM images of the PET substrate, Au sputter coated PET substrate, and Au/MoS2 on the PET substrate, respectively. In Figure 3a , the AFM results of the PET substrate indicated a height of 1.296 nm. When Au was sputter coated on the PET substrate, the height of the substrate increased to 7.856 nm due to the deposited Au as shown in Figure 3b . The MoS2 NPs immobilized on the Au coated PET substrate by spin coating was shown in Figure 3c , the height of the immobilized MoS2 NPs was about 155.81 nm. In addition, Figure 3d -f shows FE-SEM images of the fabricated Au/MoS2/Au nanolayer on the PET substrate. Compared to the results in Figure 3e , the existence of the sputter coated Au particles on MoS2 NPs was confirmed in Figure 3f . EDS analysis of all the acquired SEM images is shown in Figure S2 . The amount of sputter coated gold in the Au/MoS2/Au nanolayer on the PET substrate was doubled to the Au/MoS2 on the PET substrate due to the twice gold deposition. In addition, the EDS mapping result of the Au/MoS2/Au nanolayer on the PET substrate is shown in Figure S3 . Also, the CV result is shown in Figure 4a for confirmation of the fabrication of the Au/MoS2/Au nanolayer on the PET substrate. In Figure 4a , the CV results of the PET substrate showed no electrochemical signals, but signals were observed after Au sputter coating on the PET substrate. Also, the fabricated Au/MoS2/Au nanolayer on the PET substrate had higher electrochemical signals than the conventional bare gold electrode composed of gold (50 nm)/Cr (2 nm)/SiO2 (Silicon dioxide). The current increase of the Au/MoS2/Au nanolayer on the PET substrate compared to conventional bare gold electrode was due to the large surface area and the efficient electron transfer by MoS2 NPs.

To confirm its detection, the gp120 antigen dissolved in PBS solution was immobilized on the prepared Ab/Cys/Au/MoS2/Au nanolayer on the PET substrate for 1 h at room temperature. The detection of the gp120 antigen at a concentration of 0.1 pg/mL to 10 ng/mL was confirmed by SWV. As shown in Figure 5a , the electron transfer reaction between the redox probe and the biosensor surface was blocked by the antigen-antibody binding on the surface of the fabricated biosensor, and the current value was decreased when the concentration of the gp120 antibody was increased. In addition, the linearity of the current value for the gp120 antigen concentration was confirmed through the results obtained from SWV. As shown in Figure 5b , the gp120 antigen ranged from 0.1 pg/mL to 10 ng/mL and showed excellent linearity with 0.973 of the coefficient of determination value (R 2 ). In general, the concentration of gp120 in HIV-infected patients is approximately 200 pg/mL to 2000 pg/mL, therefore the fabricated biosensor showed the possibility for gp120 detection in practice. The mean value and the error bars were plotted with the standard deviation (SD) from four different measurements. The detection limit of an electrochemical biosensor composed of the Au/MoS2/Au nanolayer on the PET substrate for HIV detection was 0.066 pg/mL based on the 3 \u00d7 (S/m) method, where S is the standard deviation of the blank signal and m is slope of the linear fitting curve, and this value was compared with other electrodes shown in Table 1 . To confirm the detection ability for the gp120 antigen prepared from a real sample, human serum was mixed with the gp120 antigen, and the detection of the gp120 antigen was confirmed by SWV.

            "text": "The SWV technique was performed to investigate the electrochemical detection performance and selectivity of the fabricated biosensor. To confirm its detection, the gp120 antigen dissolved in PBS solution was immobilized on the prepared Ab/Cys/Au/MoS 2 /Au nanolayer on the PET substrate for 1 h at room temperature. The detection of the gp120 antigen at a concentration of 0.1 pg/mL to 10 ng/mL was confirmed by SWV. As shown in Figure 5a , the electron transfer reaction between the redox probe and the biosensor surface was blocked by the antigen-antibody binding on the surface of the fabricated biosensor, and the current value was decreased when the concentration of the gp120 antibody was increased. In addition, the linearity of the current value for the gp120 antigen concentration was confirmed through the results obtained from SWV. As shown in Figure 5b , the gp120 antigen ranged from 0.1 pg/mL to 10 ng/mL and showed excellent linearity with 0.973 of the coefficient of determination value (R 2 ). In general, the concentration of gp120 in HIV-infected patients is approximately 200 pg/mL to 2000 pg/mL, therefore the fabricated biosensor showed the possibility for gp120 detection in practice. The mean value and the error bars were plotted with the standard deviation (SD) from four different measurements. The detection limit of an electrochemical biosensor composed of the Au/MoS 2 /Au nanolayer on the PET substrate for HIV detection was 0.066 pg/mL based on the 3 \u00d7 (S/m) method, where S is the standard deviation of the blank signal and m is slope of the linear fitting curve, and this value was compared with other electrodes shown in Table 1 . To confirm the detection ability for the gp120 antigen prepared from a real sample, human serum was mixed with the gp120 antigen, and the detection of the gp120 antigen was confirmed by SWV. For real sample analysis, the gp120 with different concentrations from 1 pg/mL to 10 ng/mL was mixed with serum. As shown in Figure 5c , in the case of the gp120 antigen prepared in serum, the current value decreased with increase in concentration, the same as the gp120 antigen dissolved in PBS. The selectivity of the Ab/Cys/Au/MoS 2 /Au nanolayer on the PET substrate-based biosensor was measured by the addition of various types of antigens and proteins including Hb, Mb, PSA, and Trx prepared in PBS solution. The concentrations of the gp120 antigen, Hb, Mb, PSA, and Trx were fixed at 100 ng/mL. As shown in Figure 5d , the gp120 antigen had a low current value of 0.925 mA, while Hb, Mb, PSA, and Trx had high current values of 1.26 mA, 1.24 mA, 1.30 mA, and 1.26 mA, respectively. In addition, the rate of change of current value of gp120 antigen, Hb, Mb, PSA, and Trx were indicated 29.9%, 4.42%, 6.43%, 1.45%, and 4.60%. The mean value and the error bars were obtained as the standard deviation (SD) of five measurements. As shown in the results of the selectivity test, the measurement of gp120 was confirmed since the current value of the gp120 antigen, a surface protein of HIV was smaller than that of other antigens and proteins, and the electrochemical signal decreased due to selective immobilization of the gp120. value decreased with increase in concentration, the same as the gp120 antigen dissolved in PBS. The selectivity of the Ab/Cys/Au/MoS2/Au nanolayer on the PET substrate-based biosensor was measured by the addition of various types of antigens and proteins including Hb, Mb, PSA, and Trx prepared in PBS solution. The concentrations of the gp120 antigen, Hb, Mb, PSA, and Trx were fixed at 100 ng/mL. As shown in Figure 5d , the gp120 antigen had a low current value of 0.925 mA, while Hb, Mb, PSA, and Trx had high current values of 1.26 mA, 1.24 mA, 1.30 mA, and 1.26 mA, respectively.

The mean value and the error bars were obtained as the standard deviation (SD) of five measurements. As shown in the results of the selectivity test, the measurement of gp120 was confirmed since the current value of the gp120 antigen, a surface protein of HIV was smaller than that of other antigens and proteins, and the electrochemical signal decreased due to selective immobilization of the gp120. The flexibility of the fabricated biosensor was confirmed by a micro-fatigue tester. Figure 6a ,b show flexibility results of a conventional bare gold electrode, Au sputter coated PET substrate, and the Au/MoS 2 /Au nanolayer on the PET substrate. In Figure 6a , the flexure extension results of the conventional bare gold electrode were 0.076 mm due to the hardness of the electrode. SiO 2 -based rigid substrates were hard to bend using applied forces due to their lack of flexibility. However, Au sputter coated PET and the Au/MoS 2 /Au nanolayer on the PET substrate showed excellent flexibility and flexure extension with 1.60 mm and 1.54 mm, respectively. These results were significantly higher than those of the conventional electrode because these electrodes were easily bent by the applied force due to their excellent flexibility. In addition, the Au sputter coated PET and Au/MoS 2 /Au nanolayer on the PET substrate had flexure strength of 92.9 MPa and 99.2 MPa, respectively, which were lower than that of the conventional gold electrode due to the excellent flexibility. As shown in Figure 6b , the conventional gold electrode was found to be rapidly damaged by strong forces due to the hardness of the electrode. However, the fabricated biosensor had a high flexure extension compared with the conventional gold electrode because of the small force applied to the substrate due to the characteristics of the flexible substrate. In addition, SWV was performed to investigate electrochemical detection performance of the bent biosensor. To confirm the detection performance, 10 ng/mL of gp120 antigen was immobilized on the Ab/Cys/Au/MoS 2 /Au nanolayer on the PET substrate. As shown in Figure S5 , the current value of fabricated biosensor before bent was indicated 1.06 mA, and after the fabricated biosensor was bent, the current value was maintained to 1.03 mA. ",

            "text": "In this study, the flexible biosensor based on a Au/MoS 2 /Au nanolayer on a PET substrate was developed to detect gp120 with high sensitivity. To develop the flexible biosensor, the Au/MoS 2 /Au nanolayer was fabricated by Au sputter coating and MoS 2 NPs spin coating onto a flexible PET substrate. The fabricated Au/MoS 2 /Au nanolayer on the PET substrate showed the well-oriented NPs and uniform nanolayer formation on the PET substrate. The reduction and oxidation peak currents of the Au/MoS 2 /Au nanolayer on the PET substrate derived from the redox generator were 1.13 mA and \u22121.17 mA, respectively, which were much higher than those peaks of the bare gold electrodes with 0.96 mA and \u22121.01 mA due to the large surface area and effective electron transfer of the synthesized MoS 2 NPs. The fabricated biosensor showed highly sensitive detection of gp120 with a detection limit of 0.066 pg/mL, which was more sensitive than previously reported electrochemical HIV biosensors. This biosensor showed a selective detection of gp120 added with various antigens and proteins such as Hb, Mb, PSA, and Trx. In addition, this biosensor showed excellent flexibility with flexure extension of 1.54 mm compared to SiO 2 -based conventional gold electrodes, and the fabricated biosensor maintained the detection performance after bending. In conclusion, the proposed flexible biosensor based on a Au/MoS 2 /Au nanolayer on a PET substrate can suggest the milestone for nanomaterial-based flexible sensing platform to develop the highly sensitive biosensors with flexibility for a wearable device application. In addition, because the gp120 concentration range of the HIV infected patient can be measured, it can be used in the commercial field.",
