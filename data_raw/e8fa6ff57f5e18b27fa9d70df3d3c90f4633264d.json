In addition, mutations within the GP1 region were introduced to prevent RNA editing 11 without affecting the amino acid sequence (Fig. 3a,b) . The resultant vaccine BC-PIV/EBOV-GP incorporated a large amount of GP protein on the viral particles, as shown in the Western blot analysis (Fig. 1c) .",

The ability of the EBOV vaccine to induce efficient humoral immunity (IgG 1 and IgG 2a ) in mice was revealed by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay measuring the specific antibody titer of the sera (>100,000 \u00d7 dilution, data not shown) and a pseudotype virus-based inhibition assay 15 measuring the neutralizing antibody titer of the sera (Fig. 5a,b) . These titers were comparable to those induced by Ebola VLPs in mice 16 , or by chimeric hPIV3 bearing the EBOV GP in guinea pigs 8 . Antibodies elicited by BC-PIV/EBOV-GP also induced antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) 17 of pseudotyped EBOV infection (Fig. 5c ). The ADE activities induced by BC-PIV/EBOV GP were also comparable to those induced by Ebola VLPs in mice 16 and those of the sera from monkeys that survived challenge with EBOV 16 . A sufficient neutralizing activity of the sera indicates that the ADE effects were overcome by the inhibitory effects of the sera in virus infection. Replication-competent vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)/EBOV-GP was previously reported to protect against lethal EBOV challenge in nonhuman primates 7, 18 , thereby CD4+ T cell-depleted animals succumbed to EBOV infection due to a lack of induction of specific antibodies while the CD8+ T cell-depleted ones survived 19 . These findings suggested that antibodies play an important role in VSV/EBOV-GP-mediated protection against EBOV challenge. Although BC-PIV/EBOV-GP would not propagate in vivo in contrast to VSV/EBOV-GP, toxicity and protection studies in primates will still be required in the future. www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Generation of BC-PIVs carrying antigenic peptides. We also generated vaccines against antigenic peptide via another strategy (Fig. 1b) . We made three types of recombinant vaccines against the ectodomain of matrix protein 2 (M2e) peptide of influenza A virus, designated as BC-PIV/M2e. In these vaccines, the M2e peptide 2-25 (SLLTEVETPIRNEWGCRCNDSSDP) was loaded either inside, outside, or at both sides of the viral envelope of BC-PIV by fusing the M2e peptide gene with the C-terminus of hPIV2 F gene or with that of the HN gene. For the construction of the inside version, the M2e peptide gene was fused with the F gene and stably transfected into Vero cells as packaging cells to produce the recombinant vectors. For the outside version, the M2e peptide gene was fused with the HN gene in the hPIV2 genome and used to produce the recombinant vectors in the Vero/ BC-F cells or genetically modified Vero cells expressing M2e-fused F protein. Since F and HN proteins are oppositely oriented across the viral membrane, these strategies work (Fig. 1b,d) . The M2e peptide was detected by a Western blot analysis in each case (Fig. 1d) . The bands of the inside peptide are more abundant than those of the outside peptide. This may have resulted from differences in the expression of these peptides: the inside peptide was derived from its abundant and stable expression in the packaging cells, while the outside peptide was derived from transcripts from the vector. However, the possibility of better incorporation or enhanced stability of the inside-peptide, compared with the outside peptide, cannot be excluded.",

In contrast to virosome technology, the system in the present study does not require complex processes of antigen incorporation into the vector. Our system utilizes self-assembly of viral components such as VLP by reverse genetics, which allows us to create a stable steric structure of the antigen.
