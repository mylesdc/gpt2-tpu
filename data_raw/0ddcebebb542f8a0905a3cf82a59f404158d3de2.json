The treatment for the various DNA organisms is very specific and would be possible only if the causative organisms were promptly identified. All of the described RNA viruses except for dengue are highly infectious by aerosol transmission and no specific treatment has been demonstrated as safe and effective for the hemorrhagic fevers [7] . The rapid screening of suspected samples would help control the spread and ensure accurate treatment of the diseases. Current available diagnostic tests for CDC category \"A\" bioterrorism agents (e.g., cell culture, serology) are time consuming, have less than optimal sensitivity and specificity or cannot test for multiple agents simultaneously [9] [10] [11] [12] . Newer molecular methods are either singleplex real-time PCR assays that are not available outside the CDCs LRN network or small commercial multiplex PCR assays that are linked to expensive machines (and also not easily available) [13, 14] . There is a need for precise, rapid, simple and robust diagnostic assays to detect a large number of these agents for both clinical treatment and to prevent panic among the public and authorities.",

The 110-MDa plasmid pX01 is required for synthesis of the three anthrax toxin proteins, edema factor (EF), lethal factor (LF), and protective antigen (PA). These proteins act in binary combinations to produce the two anthrax toxins: edema toxin (PA and EF) and lethal toxin (PA and LF) [26] . Isolates lacking either the pX01 or pX02 plasmid are considered either avirulent or significantly attenuated [27, 28] . In the present study, 2 sets of primers and probes were designed from the conserved regions of the PA and Cap gene located respectively on the plasmids pX01 and pX02 for B. anthracis. Only clinical samples that give positive signals for both primers and probe sets will be considered \"positive\" for BA.

Real-time PCR and micro-array are currently two of the most commonly reported molecular diagnostic methods. MGB probe-based real-time PCR assays were developed for detecting Y. pestis, F. tularensis and B. anthracis simultaneously [29] . For this test the sample must be tested simultaneously with a seperate singleplex assay for each of these three targets. Two commercial triplex (multiplex) real time PCR kits and machines were developed by Cepheid [13] and Idaho Technology, Inc. [14] to detect B. anthracis, Y. pestis and F tularensis, however, their assays can only be used on their machines. Therefore, laboratories with standard thermocyclers or real-time machines cannot run these assays. We were unable to purchase reagents for comparison testing. For viral hemorrhagic fever agents, several TaqMan or SYBR green real-time one-step RT-PCR assays have been developed for detecting and serotyping dengue [30] [31] [32] . A single-tube multiplex PCR was developed to identify the serotype of dengue virus which had been previously screened by real-time PCR [33] . The detection for Ebola virus, RVF and Lassa is still dependent on serology testing in most laboratories but additional RT-PCR methods have been recently developed. A German group established 6 one-step, real-time RT-PCR assays for Ebola virus, Marburg virus, Lassa virus, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), dengue virus (DENV), and yellow fever virus (YFV) [34] . These assays cannot distinguish all the targets simultaneously.",

In addition, our assay utilizes a standard PCR thermocycler and ELISA plate reader which cost tens of thousands of dollars less than real-time PCR machines and the reagent costs for our multiplex PCR-EHA format are less than real-time reagents.

Recently there has been increased use of automated sample preparation using systems such as Roche's MagnaPure Compact [35, 36] , the Qiagen BioRobot M48 [37, 38] and Biomerieux's NucliSens Extractor [39] . These robotic systems can dramatically increase throughput and decrease hands-on time. We recently demonstrated dramatic decreases in technician time (by half) using automated extraction and both EHA detection and automated microarray detection [40] . However, automation can have hidden variables that effect costs, sensitivity and reproducibility. The chemistry of each assay, including buffers and enzymes used, and especially the target (RNA vs. DNA and size) and clinical matrix can affect the results you obtain with some of the automated systems. We demonstrated with the BioT DNA assay that the sensitivity using Roche's High Pure Viral Nucleic Acid Kit for extraction was one log better than using the Roche MagNAPure Compact system which also had less consistent reproducibility (data not shown). Ultimately, the goal of our laboratory is to develop fully contained, automated, hands-off devices that can extract nucleic acid, amplify a target, and detect it while being fast, accurate and inexpensive. This technology must be robust and flexible to different targets and matrix material (transport medium and clinical material). Medium to large multiplex assays as described in this paper are steps in this direction.",

For the RNA assay, 549 clinical samples (417 NP swabs, 95 skin swabs, 21 blood, 12 sputum, 3 tracheal, 1 nasal swabs) were tested. The samples were collected from 418 subjects as described above. Of these samples, 302 were from the subjects with respiratory symptoms and 247 were from subjects that had no respiratory symptoms. Two hundred and thirty nine of the samples were from children age 0-6 years old, 106 were from children age 6-19 years old, 182 were from subjects age 19-65 years old and 22 were from subjects older than 66. Of the 549 clinical samples tested, 258 were from females and 291 were from males. Any sample with OD value lower than 0.300 was considered negative. Any sample with OD value between 0.300-0.399 was considered indeterminant and was reprobed to confirm the results. Any sample with OD value over 0.400 was considered positive and was retested.",

            "text": "The presented data demonstrates that the multiplex BioT DNA assay and BioT RNA assay are highly sensitive, specific and reproducible in testing genomic DNA, recombinant plasmid positive control, RNA transcription, whole organism and spiked clinical specimens utilizing a standard thermocycler. The assays are also rapid (~5 hrs ), utilizes relatively inexpensive reagents (~$50 for 1 sample which was tested for all target analytes, ~$10/analyte) and requires little technician time per sample (~3 hrs). Compared to other currently available assays for laboratory diagnosis of bioterrorism agents, the BioT assays represents useful new tools for clinicians and public health officials who need to detect these important pathogens in people either from natural infection or man-made exposure (bioterrorism).",
