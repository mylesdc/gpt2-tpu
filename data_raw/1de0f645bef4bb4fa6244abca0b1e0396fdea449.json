It is estimated that there were over 120 million episodes of pneumonia among children younger than five years during 2010-11; of which over 10% were severe episodes [1] . A recent systematic review estimated 0.22 pneumonia episodes per child-year in developing countries alone [2] , with nearly one in eight cases progressing to severe disease. Yet another systematic review estimated nearly 12 million hospitalizations in 2010 due to severe pneumonia and 3 million due to very severe disease [3] . Pneumonia is also estimated to be responsible for almost 1 million deaths among children under 5 years old [4] , with maximum burden in Africa and South Asia [3] . India has a high burden of childhood pneumonia and the disease accounts for about a quarter of the under-five mortality in the country [5] . Recognizing this burden, the World Health Organization (WHO) developed and disseminated a simple case definition for identification and treatment of pneumonia, which could be used by field-workers in resourcepoor settings [6] [7] [8] [9] . It relies on the physiological principle that parenchymal lung disease results in compensatory tachypnea; therefore any tachypnea indirectly indicates parenchymal disease including pneumonia. This case definition is highly sensitive, and does not require chest radiography.",

A systematic review from India suggested that about 15-24% of bacterial pneumonia in South Asian countries can be attributed to S. pneumoniae [13] . Similarly data from the Invasive Bacterial Infection Surveillance (IBIS) network in India suggests that invasive Pneumococcal disease could be a significant public health problem in the country, contributing to significant morbidity and mortality [14] .

If symptoms were reported and tachypnea confirmed, the child was presented to a Medical Officer for confirmation and inclusion. Children with duration of illness >7 days; those who had received antibiotics for >24 hours at presentation or those with previous hospitalization within the preceding 30 days, were excluded.

After CMV, RSV was most frequently identified as previously reported also [2] while Influenza A and B were less frequent.

However, the pattern of PCR findings did not differ with disease severity which is in concordance with initial data from the PERCH project also [16] .

In contrast, it is the most frequently recovered pathogen in parapneumonic effusions/empyema complicating pneumonia [37] [38] [39] and also commonly isolated in blood cultures from infants with bacteraemia [40] .

In an individual child, even the presence of organisms commonly associated with pneumonia may be of limited value for predicting pneumonia severity/ outcome.
