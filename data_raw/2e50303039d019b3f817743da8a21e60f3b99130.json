            "text": "Nosocomial infections caused by Acinetobacter spp. resistant to carbapenems are increasingly reported worldwide. Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter (CRA) is becoming a serious concern with increasing patient morbidity, mortality, and lengths of hospital stay. Therefore, the rapid detection of CRA is essential for epidemiological surveillance. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been extensively used for the rapid identification of most pathogens. In this study, we have developed two multiplex real-time PCR assays to detect and differentiate A. baumannii and non-A. baumannii Acinetobacter spp, and common carbapenemase genes, including bla NDM , bla OXA-23-like , bla OXA-40-like , bla OXA-51-like , and bla OXA-58-like . We demonstrate the potential utility of these assays for the direct detection of bla NDM -, bla OXA-23-like -, bla OXA-40-like -, bla OXA-51-like -, and bla OXA-58-like -positive CRA in clinical specimens. Primers were specifically designed, and two multiplex real-time PCR assays were developed: multiplex real-time PCR assay1 for the detection of Acinetobacter baumannii 16S-23S rRNA internal transcribed spacer sequence, the Acinetobacter recA gene, and class-B-metalloenzyme-encoding gene bla NDM ; and multiplex real-time PCR assay2 to detect class-D-oxacillinase-encoding genes (bla OXA-23-like , bla OXA-40-like , bla OXA-51-like ,and bla OXA-58-like ). The assays were performed on an ABI Prism 7500 FAST Real-Time PCR System. CRA isolates were used to compare the assays with conventional PCR and sequencing. Known amounts of CRA cells were added to sputum and fecal specimens and used to test the multiplex real-time PCR assays. The results for target and nontarget amplification showed that the multiplex real-time PCR assays were specific, the limit of detection for each target was 10 copies per 20 \u03bcL reaction volume, the assays were linear over six log dilutions of the target genes (r 2 > 0.99), and the Ct values of the coefficients of variation for intra-and interassay reproducibility were less than 5%. The multiplex real-time PCR assays showed 100% concordance with conventional PCR when tested against 400 CRA isolates PLOS ONE | Citation: Yang Q, Rui Y (2016) Two Multiplex Real-Time PCR Assays to Detect and Differentiate Acinetobacter baumannii and Non-baumannii Acinetobacter spp. Carrying bla NDM , bla OXA-23-Like , bla OXA-40-Like , bla OXA-51-Like , and bla OXA-58-Like Genes.

Thirty-four species have been identified within this genus [2] . Acinetobacter spp. can colonize patients or the equipment used in medical care and survive on environmental surfaces for prolonged times [3] . Most clinical isolates are reported to be strains of Acinetobacter baumannii [4] . However, clinical infections caused by non-baumannii Acinetobacter spp. have increased [5] . In the last decade, carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter (CRA) has become worldwide public-health issue with a widespread distribution, broad range of activities against \u03b2-lactams, increased patient morbidity, mortality, and lengths of hospital stay [6] , particularly among elderly patients, infants and patients with severe underlying disease. Therefore, there is growing concern about the increasing prevalence of CRA [7] , and it is difficult for clinicians to choose the initially appropriate antibiotic therapy [8] .",

A. baumannii and class D oxacillinase genes have been detected simultaneously with multiplex conventional PCR [14, 15] ,however, conventional PCR required openning the tubes for procedures post detection during the reaction which might cause contamination and lead to false-positive results [16] . Therefore,the use of real-time PCR and LAMP is attractive, because they are highly sensitive and specific, time efficient, and generate fewer false-positive results. As we known,the LAMP method is difficult to apply in a multiplex assay because six primers are used to detect one target sequence [17] , while probe-based and dye-based multiplex realtime PCR assays have been used to detect several targets simultaneously. Fluorescently labeled target-specific probes can add significant costs to an assay,however,intercalating dyes such as SYBR Green I have been reported suitable for multiplex real-time PCR systems, it detect all double stranded DNA, and PCR products can be distinguished by their melt curves [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] .",

In recent decades, Acinetobacter spp. have become a public-health issue because they play important roles in nosocomial infections [30] . The serious concern associated with these bacteria is the growing prevalence of carbapenem-resistant isolates. Therefore, surveillance and early detection are required to control these infections and prevent their further spread, so a sensitive and specific detection system for CRA is required. Although the multiplex real-time PCR technology has been extensively used for the rapid detection of pathogens, the SYBR--Green-I-based multiplex real-time PCR assays developed in this study are less expensive than probe-based multiplex real-time PCR assays [31] . Here, we have described the development and validation of two multiplex real-time PCR assays for CRA, and demonstrated their potential utility in the direct detection of tracheal and gastrointestinal colonization by A. baumannii and non-baumannii Acinetobacter spp. carrying the bla NDM , bla OXA-23-like , bla OXA-40-like , bla OXA-51-like , and bla OXA-58-like genes in sputum and fecal specimens.
