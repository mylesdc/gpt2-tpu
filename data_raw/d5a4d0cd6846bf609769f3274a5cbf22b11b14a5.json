Recent studies have reported that EF has anti-metastatic, anti-angiogenic, anti-bacterial, and anti-oxidant activities, as well as activities against malignant metastatic human cancers. The effect of EF and its components on viruses has not been reported. In the present study, the antiviral activity and mechanism of action of an aqueous extract of EF (WEF) and its components were evaluated in vitro. We found that pretreatment with WEF markedly reduced viral replication, as evaluated using a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged virus (influenza A virus, Newcastle disease virus, and vesicular stomatitis virus) in murine RAW 264.7 macrophage cells. We demonstrated that WEF induces the production of type I IFN including pro-inflammatory cytokines. Additionally, we identified the active antiviral components of WEF as quercetin, psoralen, and quercitrin. Thus, WEF and its active components are immunomodulators of the innate immune response in murine macrophages, a finding that is potentially useful to developing prophylactic or therapeutic treatments against a range of viruses.",

The method of taking traditional medicine typically involves oral administration as water extracts. In addition, traditional medicine has relieved the symptoms of various diseases including cancer and infectious diseases, and has been used for thousands of years and is still being used. Several herbal medicines have been used to prevent and treat virus infections and immune enhance immunity (Cha et al., 2007) . Currently, research is being conducted worldwide to search for antiviral materials using traditional medicinal plants. In addition, the emergence of tolerance to existing antiviral agents calls for the development of new candidates, and there is an increasing interest in the development of antiviral agents using traditional medicinal plants. Expensive antiviral agents are still a burden on developing countries, and effective and cheap antiviral agents are one of the world's top priorities for drug development. In addition, natural products derived from medicinal plants play a role as one of the most important raw materials of lead compounds in pharmaceuticals. Therefore, the search for antiviral active substances using traditional medicinal plants offers great potential for the development of potentially effective new antiviral agents (Lin et al., 2014; Talactac et al., 2015) .",

We investigated the effect of WEF on the secretion of TNF\u03b1, IL-6, and IFN-\u03b2 using ELISA.

The optimal dosage of WEF for practical application and the duration of the effects within the host should be examined to obtain the best possible protection against viral infections. In addition, this study investigated the anti-viral activity of WEF and its components only in vitro. Therefore, further extensive studies are needed to assess the potential of WEF and its components for use as in vivo antiviral therapies.

The separation was carried out on an Acclaim RSLC 120 C18 column (150 \u00d7 2.1 mm, 2.2 \u00b5m, Dionex Corp.). The mobile phase comprised acetonitrile (A) and 0.1% formic acid in water (B, v/v). Gradient elution was carried out as follows: 5% A, 0.0-1.0 min; 5.0-15.0% A, 1.0-5.0 min; 15.0-30.0% A, 5.0-12.0 min; 30-50% A, 12.0-15.0 min; 50-65% A, 15.0-17.0 min; 5-5% A, 17.0-22.0 min. The flow rate was 0.25 mL/min. The operation conditions in the MS/MS analysis were set as follows: ionization mode, positive; spray voltage, 4.0 kV;capillary temperature, 320 \u2022 C; sheath gas pressure, 40 arbitrary units; auxiliary gas pressure, 10 arbitrary units; ion scans, 100-1,500 m/z; resolution of MS scans, 70,000; resolution of MS/MS scans, 17,500; and normalized collision energy, 10-70 eV.
