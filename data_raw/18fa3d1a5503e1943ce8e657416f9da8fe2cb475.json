Information remains limited about the comparative protein expression profiles of chicken embryonic tissues in response to IBV infection in ovo. In this study, we analyzed the changes of protein expression in trachea and kidney tissues from chicken embryos, following IBV infection in ovo, using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) coupled with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ ionization time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-TOF MS). Results: 17 differentially expressed proteins from tracheal tissues and 19 differentially expressed proteins from kidney tissues were identified. These proteins mostly related to the cytoskeleton, binding of calcium ions, the stress response, anti-oxidative, and macromolecular metabolism. Some of these altered proteins were confirmed further at the mRNA level using real-time RT-PCR. Moreover, western blotting analysis further confirmed the changes of annexin A5 and HSPB1 during IBV infection. Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, we have performed the first analysis of the proteomic changes in chicken embryonic trachea and kidney tissues during IBV infection in ovo. The data obtained should facilitate a better understanding of the pathogenesis of IBV infection.",

On the one hand, the virus usurps the biological processes of the host to evade the innate immune response of the host; on the other hand, the host mounts a variety of defensive responses against the viral infection. These virus-host interactions can cause changes in the level of expression of host genes. Alteration of gene expression in the host after infection with coronavirus (CoV) has been investigated mainly with regard to infection with mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [4] . Limited studies have been performed to analyze host gene expression in response to IBV infection at the transcriptional level using microarray technology [5, 6] . However, the altered levels of transcription do not reflect the proteomic changes that follow viral infection completely. Therefore, information about proteome changes in the host following IBV infection may be crucial in order to understand the host response to the virus and viral pathogenesis.",

Proteomic approaches have been utilized to investigate the proteome changes in cells infected in vitro with classical swine fever virus [7] , infectious bursal disease virus [8] , porcine circovirus [9] , and SARS-CoV [10] . Moreover, proteomic approaches have been used widely to study the mechanisms of viral infection through the comparative analysis of proteome changes in host tissue in response to infection in vivo by Marek's disease virus [11] and yellow head virus [12] . More recently, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) was used to compare the potential effect of several different enveloped RNA virus such as Influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza (PIV) and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) on the host cell proteome [13] [14] [15] [16] . In addition, Edward Emmott revealed changes in the cytoplasmic, nuclear and nucleolar proteomes in Vero cells and DF-1 cells infected with IBV using Stable Isotope Labeling by Amino acids in Cell culture (SILAC) technique [17, 18] . Study on identification of the incorporated host proteins in purified IBV particles has also been reported [19] . Whereas, no studies have been reported to date of the comparative protein expression profiles of chicken embryonic tissues in response to IBV infection either in vitro or in vivo.",

Figure  6 shows normalized fold changes of the mRNA of these A B genes in chicken embryos of the IBV-infected group and in mock-infected chicken embryos. In tracheal tissues, the mRNA level of ANXA1, HSPB1, and MYLPF was decreased in IBV-infected chicken embryos by 0.32, 0.39, 0.31 fold, respectively, compared with mockinfected chicken embryos. The mRNA level of TRIM27.2 and EXFABP was increased by 1.28 and 1.52 fold, respectively, and the trends of the changes in their mRNA levels were similar to the patterns of change in their corresponding proteins on 2-DE gels. For kidney tissues, the trends of change in the mRNA levels of ANXA5, PRDX1, TPM1, and ENO1 were consistent with the 2-DE results.

Their alterations were also confirmed at the mRNA level by real-time RT-PCR. Tropomyosin belongs to the family of actin-binding proteins that serves important functions in microfilament stabilization, regulation of microfilament branching, actin polymerization, and intracellular transport [21] . Myosins are a large superfamily of motor proteins that are involved in movement along actin filaments, the development of myriad cells, targeted organelle transport, endocytosis, chemotaxis, cytokinesis, and signal transduction [22] . Similar result was observed in the IBV-infected cells by using SILAC technique [17, 18] . Changes in cytoskeleton proteins have been reported in other virus infection in vitro, including infectious bursal virus [8] , H9N2 avian influenza virus [23] , respiratory syncytial virus [16] , and SARS-associated CoV [10] . During the process of virus infection, particularly in the stages of virus entry and virus budding, the cytoskeletal network of the host cell is involved in the transport of viral components within the cell. Moreover, some viral proteins can interact with the cytoskeletal transport machinery, such as actin-binding proteins or actin, and induce rearrangements of cytoskeletal filaments so that they can utilize them as tracks or push them aside when they represent barriers [24] . In the present study, several actin-binding proteins, including TPM1 and MYLPF, their abundance were found to be decreased in the IBV-infected group, which suggests that IBV may also manipulate the host cytoskeletal network for its own infectious processes and replication.",

Viruses can utilize host cellular Ca 2+ and Ca 2+ -binding proteins to create a tailored cellular environment that meets their own demands for the replication cycle [25] . In this study, the level of expression of some calcium ion-binding proteins, including Calbindin-D 28 k , annexin A1, annexin A2, annexin A5, and annexin A6 were altered after IBV infection in ovo.

In this study, its abundance was remarkably increased in the IBV-infected group, which suggests that IBV might specially utilize calbindin-D 28 k to perturb the cellular Ca 2+ homeostasis and Ca 2+ -signaling network for its own benefit. Annexins are a family of structurally related proteins that bind phospholipids and cellular membranes in a calcium-dependent manner [28] . Annexin A2 has been shown to take part in the initiation of membrane fusion in exocytosis, membrane trafficking, regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis, and stabilization of membrane-associated protein complexes with the actin cytoskeleton [29, 30] . In addition, Annexin A2 can promote the entry of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) into monocyte-derived macrophages [29] , and it was also identified to be a potential receptor for respiratory syncytial virus on human epithelial cells [31] . Annexin A2 on the lung epithelial cell surface was recognized by SARS-associated CoV spike domain 2 antibodies and identified as an autoantigen [32] . Annexin A5 was found to be involved in cytomegalovirus infection [33] and influenza virus infection [34] . Annexin A1 plays a critical role in a variety of cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis [35] . Its abundance was shown to be increased in HepaRG cells infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) in vitro [36] , and fish cells infected in vitro with infectious pancreatic necrosis virus [37] . Changes in the abundance of some annexins family proteins also were identified in IBV-infected DF-1 cells by Edward Emmott and coworkers [18] . In current study, the abundance of annexin A1, annexin A5, and annexin A6 were all decreased in the IBV-infected group. For annexin A2, two spots were identified in kidney tissue, the abundance of one spot was increased, and another spot was decreased. Of these, the decrease of annexin A5 was confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and western blotting analysis. These data suggested that they may play special roles during IBV infection or replication.",

Proteome Science 2011, 9:11 http://www.proteomesci.com/content/9/1/11 oxidant stress, regulation of translational initiation, and modulation of inflammation, inhibition of apoptosis, and cell differentiation and proliferation [38, 39] . Enhanced levels of HSPB1 and/or phosphoHSPB1 can promote nuclear transport of adenovirus in MK2-deficient cells [40] . The abundance of HSPB1 has found to be increased in cells infected in vitro with H9N2 avian influenza virus [23] , African swine fever virus [41] , and infectious bursal disease virus [8] . In contrast, its abundance was found to be decreased in cells infected in vitro with mumps virus [42] and porcine circovirus type 2 [9] , which suggests that HSPB1 may play different roles in different virus infections or different stages of infection. PRDX1 is the most ubiquitously expressed member of the peroxiredoxin family, which is involved in anti-oxidative processes, cell differentiation and proliferation, immune responses, regulation of apoptosis, and as a molecular chaperone [43] . PRDX1 participates in the apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1)mediated signaling pathway, and plays an inhibitory role in ASK1-induced apoptosis [44] . Its abundance was shown to be decreased in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) following CSFV infection in vivo [45] . In our study, the abundance of HSPB1 and PRDX1 were shown to be decreased after IBV infection in ovo by 2-DE and real-time RT-PCR methods. Furthermore, the change of HSPB1 expression was confirmed by western blotting. This alteration may allow the infected cells to be eliminated by apoptosis, or serve as a form of host defense against IBV infection. Viral replication requires energy and macromolecular precursors derived from the metabolic network of the host. In the present results obtained using 2-DE, the abundance of some proteins which are associated with carbohydrate, amino acid, and lipid metabolic processes were found to be differentially changed. Enolase-1 is a key enzyme of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis that catalyzes the dehydration of 2-phosphoglycerate to phosphoenolpyruvate [46] . Its abundance was found to be changed in many virus infections, such as white spot syndrome virus [47] , and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus [48] . Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase is another gluconeogenic enzyme; it catalyzes the GTP-driven conversion of oxaloacetate to phosphoenolpyruvate [49] . Increased expression of proteins related to energy metabolism was also found in HIV-infected peripheral blood mononuclear cells [50] , chicken spleen tissue infected with Marek's disease virus Table 1 or Table 2 .",

Up-regulation of proteins related to energy metabolism may meet the requirement for a large burst of oxygen and energy during rapid virus replication, and also may result from an attempt by the host to keep up with the energy demand during viral infection. Ex-FABP is 21 kDa lipocalin that is involved in fatty acid transport and lipid metabolism. It may play an important role in the protection of cells against the toxic effects of the accumulation of fatty acids. The expression of Ex-FABP is enhanced greatly in response to inflammatory stimuli and other stress conditions [52, 53] . In this study, its abundance was significantly increased in tracheal tissue of IBV-infected chicken embryos, suggesting may serve as a response to the inflammation induced by IBV infection in ovo.",

TRIM protein is a member of a protein family that is based on a conserved domain architecture characterized by a RING finger domain, one or two B-box domains, a coiled-coil domain and a variable C-terminus. TRIM proteins are involved in a variety of cellular processes that include signal transduction, transcriptional regulation, cell proliferation, apoptosis, and immunity [54] . Many TRIM proteins, such as TRIM5\u03b1, TRIM11, TRIM22, TRIM28, TRIM31, and TRIM62, have been found to display antiviral activity or to be involved in processes associated with innate immunity [55] [56] [57] . An extended gene map revealed that TRIM27.2 lies within a sub-region of the chicken MHC-B that affects infectious disease [58] . The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) plays an important role in regulation of the immune response and antigen presentation. The transcription levels of the MHC class II-associated invariant chain and MHC class II \u03b2 chain were observed to be increased in tracheal epithelial layers of chickens three days after infection with an attenuated IBV-Massachusetts strain [6] . In current study, the abundance of TRIM27.2 and MHC class I antigen were increased remarkably following IBV infection in ovo.

            "text": "Eighteen 13-day-old SPF chicken embryos (Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, China) were divided randomly into two groups, the IBV-infected group and the mock-infected group (nine chicken embryos in each group). Each chicken embryo in the IBV-infected group was inoculated with 100 \u03bcl chorioallantoic fluid containing IBV H 120 strain (10 5 -10 6 EID 50 ). As a control, each chicken embryo in the mock-infected group was inoculated in parallel with 100 \u03bcl sterile chorioallantoic fluid. The inoculated chicken embryos were incubated at 37\u00b0C and candled daily to check for embryonic viability. Seventy-two hours after inoculation, the inoculated embryos were examined for characteristics of IBV infection. All the allantoic fluid was harvested from the IBVinfected and mock-infected chicken embryos to test for the presence of IBV using electron microscopy (EM), and for reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) amplification of the majority of the N gene and parts of the 3'-UTR, as described previously [3, 59] . Trachea and kidney tissues were removed quickly from the chicken embryos. Tissue samples from three randomly selected chicken embryos per group were pooled, and the pooled tissue samples were stored immediately at -80\u00b0C for 2-DE and real-time RT-PCR analysis. ",

For tracheal tissue samples, pH 4-7 and linear pH 3-10 IPG strips were used. For kidney tissue samples, only linear pH 3-10 IPG strips were used. Briefly, 400 \u03bcg protein (for pH 3-10 strips) or 550 \u03bcg (for pH 4-7 strips) were added to the rehydration solution (7 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 40 mM DTT, 2% CHAPS, 0.5% pH 3-10 or pH 4-7 IPG buffer, and 0.002% bromophenol blue) to make the final volume up to 250 \u03bcl, then loaded onto 13 cm, pH 4-7 or linear pH 3-10 IPG strips (GE Healthcare). Isoelectric focusing (IEF) was performed on an Ettan IPGphor 3 (GE Healthcare) using the following procedure: 12 h at 30 V, 30 min at 200 V, 2 h at 500 V, 1 h at 1000 V, 2 h of a linear gradient from 1000 V to 7000 V, and 7000 V to 55000 Vh.

Protein spot intensity was defined as the normalized spot volume (vol %), then the normalized volume values (vol %) of individual protein spots were subjected to Student's t test using SPSS statistical software package version 16.0. The criterion used to define differential expression of spots was that the ratio of the vol % in the IBV-infected group vs. the mock-infected group was more than 1.5 (p < 0.05) or less than 0.67 (p < 0.05).

The trypsin autodigestion ion picks (842.51, 1045.56, 2211.10, and 2225.12 Da) were used as internal standards to validate the external calibration procedure. Matrix and/or autoproteolytic trypsin fragments, and known contaminants (e.g., keratins) were removed. The resulting peptide mass lists were used first to search the NCBInr database (release 16/01/2010, 10343571 sequences, 3528215794 residues) for Gallus sequences with MASCOT (v2.3) in the automated mode; the following parameters were used as criteria in the search: significant protein MOWSE score at 83 (p < 0.05), minimum mass accuracy at 100 ppm, trypsin as enzyme, one missed cleavage site allowed, cysteine carbamidomethylation, acrylamide modified cysteine, methionine oxidation, and the minimum sequence coverage at 15%. The samples identified by PMF were automatically submitted to MS/MS analysis. Three of the strongest peaks of the TOF spectra per sample were chosen for MS/MS analysis. For MS/MS spectra searching, the spectra were used to search the NCBInr database (release 16/01/2010, 10343571 sequences, 3528215794 residues) for Gallus sequences using MASCOT (v2.3). The search parameters for MS/ MS data included 100 ppm for the precursor ion and 0.4 Da for the fragment ions. Cleavage specificity and covalent modifications were considered as described above, and the score was higher than the minimal significant (p < 0.05) individual ion score. All significant MS/ MS identifications by MASCOT were verified manually for spectral quality and matching of the y and b ion series.",
