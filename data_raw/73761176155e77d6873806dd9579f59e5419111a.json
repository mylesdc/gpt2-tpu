Therefore, a rapid and cost-effective pathogen screening method with broad coverage is required for prevention and control of infectious diseases. The availability of a large number of microbial genome sequences generated by conventional Sanger sequencing and next generation sequencing has enabled the development of a high-throughput high-density microarray platform for rapid large-scale screening of vertebrate pathogens. Methods: An easy operating pathogen microarray (EOPM) was designed to detect almost all known pathogens and related species based on their genomic sequences. For effective identification of pathogens from EOPM data, a statistical enrichment algorithm has been proposed, and further implemented in a user-friendly web-based interface.",

In recent years, mutant or new forms of some existing pathogens have been identified as the causative agents of a number of outbreaks that have endangered public health in China [1] . Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), caused by a coronavirus, spread throughout Guangdong Province in 2003, followed by a worldwide epidemic. During the epidemic, 66% of the SARS cases were reported in China, resulting in 349 human deaths [2] . In 2007, an outbreak of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) infected 1149 persons and caused the death of three children in Linyi City, Shandong Province, China [3] . The 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic affected more than 154,000 human patients, leading to 842 deaths in China alone [4] . Because of its large and highly mobile population, the emergence of infectious diseases in China is relatively more frequent. Therefore, a system implemented by the medical community and government for the monitoring of pathogens that could have a significantly negative impact on public health is urgently required in China.",

All clinical and hospital reports of both suspected and confirmed cases of notifiable infectious disease must be sent to local Centers for Disease Control (CDC). The information is then sent to the China CDC headquarters in Beijing through the National Infectious Diseases Monitoring Information System Database, which was established in 2004. The hierarchical administrative organization of the surveillance system ensures a rapid and efficient upward flow of epidemic information [5] . Based on this system, development of effective diagnostic platforms can greatly enhance the prevention and control of infectious diseases in China. The predominant techniques for identification of microbial pathogens depend on conventional clinical microbiology monitoring approaches. Although well established, these approaches usually require culture of the pathogens, followed by susceptibility tests, which are time-consuming and laborious. In addition, many microbes are difficult to culture, and may be undetectable by culture-based approaches.",

Currently, molecular approaches include traditional Sanger DNA sequencing, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), oligonucleotide microarrays, and next generation sequencing (NGS). Among these four technologies, the former two can identify a few known pathogens that must then be confirmed individually, and thus cannot cover a wide range of pathogens. The latter two methods cover a broad range of pathogens, and are therefore suitable for identifying unknown or even novel pathogens in infectious outbreaks. Although NGS produces the most in-depth, unbiased information, and can reveal completely novel organisms, it is time-consuming and expensive, especially for the analysis of complex samples [6] . DeRisi and colleagues developed the first generation of microarray platform, called ViroChip, to detect a wide range of viruses [7] . In 2003, the ViroChip helped to characterize SARS as a novel Coronavirus [8] . Since then, ViroChip has also been used to detected a human metapneumovirus [9] , a novel influenza virus [10] , and a novel adenovirus [11] . More recently, GreeneChip and MDA microarrays have been developed, which are broader spectrum approaches that can detect several thousand pathogenic viruses, bacteria, fungi, and protozoa [12, 13] . The aforementioned three platforms all used long oligonucleotide probes and random amplification of nucleic acids.",

The terms at the family level that describe the host as a vertebrate animal were extracted from the \"Virus Taxonomy List 2012\" (http://ictvonline.org/virusTaxonomy.asp? version=2012), compiled by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTVdB). We only considered viruses under these taxonomy nodes. We also downloaded the sequences of fungi and parasites from EMBL. 18S rRNA sequences were extracted using the CDS tag. Finally, we obtained bacterial 16S rRNA sequences from the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP 10.28, http://rdp.cme.msu. edu). The final integrated dataset included 1,358,528 viral sequences representing complete and partial viral genomes, 2,110,258 bacterial 16S rRNA sequences, 621,351 fungal 18S rRNA sequences, and 1,735,744 18S rRNA sequences from parasites. The EOPM Chip distinguishes all 2,554 known vertebrate virus species (involving 151 genera, 36 families), 124 bacterial genera (involving 53 families), 38 fungal genera (involving 17 families), and 47 genera of parasites (involving 24 families). Considering that bacterial 16S rRNA genes show a relatively high level of homology, and that bacteria require the presence of active virulence genes for pathogenesis, 58 virulence genes were selected, including rfbE, slt-1, ipaA, and katG, and probes were designed against these gene sequences.",

First, probes were targeted to conserved regions in areas encoding the structural proteins. The protein families database (Pfam, http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk/) of multiple sequence alignments was used to cluster the functionally related sequences [14] . The regions tagged as 5\u2032 UTR, 3\u2032 UTR, and LTR were also extracted and used as candidate sequences for the following probe design. Second, candidate probes were screened according to the following criteria: probes with a length of 60 nt, no repeats exceeding a length of 8 nt, no hairpins with stem lengths exceeding 10 nt, GC content between 30-70%, and Tm from 60-80\u00b0C. Third, we used BLAST analysis to select the conserved viral probes at the genus level from all of the candidate probes. The extent of conservation was evaluated for each probe, and all were found to detect the majority of species in each genus. A target species was considered to be represented if a probe matched it with at least 75% sequence identity. Probes conserved at the genus level were selected based on a flexible threshold because the sequence conservation between species belonging to different genera is quite variable. Finally, we aligned the sequences of all the candidate probes against the nt database, which was downloaded from NCBI FTP in August 2012. Probes with high sequence similarity to non-target genomes were eliminated. Both species-specific and genus-conserved probes were included in the final probe set.",

The kit can be used to extract the nucleic acid from both RNA and DNA viruses (like adenovirus), as well as bacteria, fungi, and parasites. A previously described random PCR amplification strategy [7] with minor modification was applied to amplify extracted nucleic acids and label amplified products with fluorescent dye. In brief, the first cDNA strand was reverse transcribed with a random decamer heeled with a PCR primer (5\u2032-GTTTCCCAGTCACGATCNNNNNNNNN-3\u2032).

The probes were ranked by the signal of the Cy5 fluorescent dye that was used to label the patient sample. In the user-interface of the EOPM software, the proportion of probes can be chosen by the user according to the sample types. A small p-value indicates that there is a very low likelihood that a mistake has occurred in the multi-probe analysis, and correspondingly, that there is a high probability of the existence of the target microbe. Finally, the p-value is adjusted using Benjamini and Hochberg's FDR correction [15] . Because the probes were designed to both the species and genus levels, results will be given accordingly. In EOPM analysis, when there were at least three positive probes for a specific species of pathogen and an enrichment p-value < 0.01, the given species could be considered positive for further investigation, including the clinical symptom coincidence analysis.",

            "text": "Since the first application of a high-throughput, rapid, and unbiased microarray for detecting viral pathogens in 2002 [7] , several pan-microbial microarray platforms with different degrees of coverage of various pathogens have been established. These microarray platforms use long oligonucleotide probes (60-70-mer) and random PCR amplification, and have successfully identified unexpected pathogens in infectious disease outbreaks, even discovering novel viruses with homology to known species [8, 11] . In this study, we constructed a high-density EOPM array for screening all known viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites that could become vertebrate pathogens. Based on the sequence data available for vertebrate pathogens, we have designed 60,000 60-mer oligonucleotide probes targeting 2,554 vertebrate virus species (involving 151 genera, 36 families), 124 bacterial genera (involving 53 families), 38 fungal genera (involving 17 families), and 47 parasite genera (involving 24 families). The 60-mer oligonucleotide probes can cross-hybridize with similar but non-identical sequences, allowing the detection of novel pathogens that are related to known species. The EOPM probes designed to detect bacteria, fungi, and parasites were targeted to 16S rRNA or 18S rRNA sequences. Whereas rRNA sequences are relatively conserved in the same genus or family, EOPM can distinguish bacteria, fungi, and parasites at either the genus or family level, which has already been successfully applied in a clinical setting for confirmation and treatment. In the sensitivity study of EOPM, we designed experiments to compare the sensitivity of random amplification and specific amplification, while not considering the effect of other issues, such as clinical sample collection and nucleic acid extraction, on the sensitivity of EOPM. EOPM showed 10 3 -fold lower sensitivity than specific target PCR amplification, which was consistent with a previous report [20] . The lower sensitivity was due to the random PCR amplification adopted in the EOPM sample preparation, which was not as efficient as specific PCR for amplification of a particular species. Despite having lower sensitivity than target-specific PCR, the EOPM platform is sufficiently sensitive to identify the pathogens causing clinical symptoms in infectious outbreaks, in which symptom-causing pathogens should be highly enriched. The sensitivity can be further improved in practice if acellular samples with minimal host nucleic acid contamination, such as serum and throat swabs, are used for pathogen screening. For example, Greninger and colleagues had used ViroChip microarray to identify influenza A/H1N1 in nasal swab samples showing a comparable sensitivity with RT-PCR [10] . In the sample preparation for the EOPM method, all RNA and DNA extracted from samples are firstly reverse transcribed. RNA viruses are converted into cDNA, and DNA viruses keep its DNA status in the reverse transcription reaction, then the DNA, including the reverse-transcribed cDNA and original DNA viruses, were transformed to double strand DNA for the subsequent random amplification procedure. Therefore, EOPM can detect both RNA viruses and DNA viruses in the same standard protocol. For bacteria, fungi, and parasites, EOPM detects 16S rRNA or 18S rRNA copies encoded by rRNA genes located in the genomic DNA. Because rRNA genes are highly transcribed, detecting rRNA molecules instead of rRNA genes should achieve higher sensitivity. With the dual color strategy used by the EOPM method, one normal sample without infectious symptoms was always analyzed in parallel. Despite this, the \"normal\" sample may possess its own clinical characteristics. For example, we have found Torque teno virus and human endogenous retroviruses in some normal blood samples. These viruses do not cause obvious clinical symptoms, and should not interfere with the aim of EOPM analysis, which is to determine the possible pathogens causing the symptoms in the test patients. EOPM data analysis consists of two steps. First, we screened for significantly enriched microbes in the target sample compared with the normal sample using the dual color chip. Second, the predicted microbes identified in the first step were compared with a database compiled from the normal population mentioned above, to eliminate the background microbes that also exist in normal samples without infectious symptoms.",

Moreover, diagnostic low-density microarrays usually use short oligonucleotides of about 20-nucleotides as specific probes, similar to TaqMan probes in qPCR technology [21, 22] . The very limited number of short probes/primers targeting a pathogen could fail to detect sequences with mutations located in the regions targeted by the probes/primers. However, over a dozen long oligonucleotide probes were designed for each pathogen in the EOPM method, allowing reliable identification of a pathogen based on a statistical enrichment analysis of the probe group, instead of one individual probe. Moreover, EOPM can effectively narrow down the potential pathogens and even identify novel pathogens in complex clinical infection situations.",

Although NGS can provide the most in-depth, unbiased information, and can reveal completely novel pathogens, it is timeconsuming when the sample contains hundreds of microbial species that require comprehensive data processing. Therefore, NGS cannot meet the short time requirement for infectious disease control. However, the most complicated step in EOPM technology is probe design, which can be undertaken by a core bioinformatics team in the development phase. Once probe design is complete, and the whole microarray procedure is optimized as a standard procedure, pathogen screening results can be interpreted in less than 28 hours. Therefore, EOPM is more suitable for applications requiring detection of unknown pathogens during infectious outbreaks.",
