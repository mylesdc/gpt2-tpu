            "text": "Solubility is the prime criterion for determining the quality of recombinant proteins, yet it often fails to represent functional activity due to the involvement of non-functional, misfolded, soluble aggregates, which compromise the quality of recombinant proteins. However, guidelines for the quality assessment of soluble proteins have neither been proposed nor rigorously validated experimentally. Using the aggregation-prone enhanced green-fluorescent protein (EGFP) folding reporter system, we evaluated the folding status of recombinant proteins by employing the commonly used sonication and mild lysis of recombinant host cells. We showed that the differential screening of solubility and folding competence is crucial for improving the quality of recombinant proteins without sacrificing their yield. These results highlight the importance of screening out incorrectly folded soluble aggregates at the initial purification step to ensure the functional quality of recombinant proteins.",

Nevertheless, the production of properly folded heterologous proteins in E. coli is still difficult, necessitating optimal conditions for the expression and purification of the protein of interest. The cytoplasm of E. coli often fails to provide the optimal environment for the folding of recombinant proteins; therefore, various approaches have been used to overcome this inherent problem [1] . These approaches include: (1) co-expression with molecular chaperones or specific binding partners that may help to fold target proteins [2] [3] [4] [5] , and (2) fusion with highly soluble proteins, such as Glutathione S-transferase(GST), Maltose-binding protein(MBP), N utilization substance protein A(NusA) [6] , DnaK [7, 8] , Small ubiquitin-like modifier(SUMO) [9] , or Lysyl tRNA synthetase(LysRS) [10] , to enhance the solubility of target proteins [11] . Alternatively, approaches based on the chaperone function of RNAs (chaperna; chaperone + RNA) [12] , co-expression with a specific RNA ligand [4, 5] , or fusion with an RNA-interaction domain (RID) [13] [14] [15] greatly enhances the solubility and the overall yield of soluble proteins.",

Soluble aggregates are soluble oligomers that form micelle-like structures, which are usually biologically inert. Although fusion with highly soluble partners or co-expression with molecular chaperones may greatly enhance their overall solubility, it has long been observed that these proteins often remain biologically inactive. Further examination of their physico-chemical properties frequently reveals that these proteins are present predominantly as aggregates rather than in their mono-dispersed forms [18] . Such negative results are regularly observed by researchers, but are not usually shared in the public domain.",

This is particularly important to ensure the quality of purified proteins for detailed analyses of the biological function of proteins. Even though screening out soluble-but-inactive proteins remains a challenge, soluble aggregates can be separated based on their physical characteristics. In particular, dynamic light scattering (DLS) can be used to identify soluble aggregates; however, it requires highly purified protein samples without other cellular components. Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) is used to separate soluble aggregates from mono-dispersed proteins in the void volume, but again this procedure requires prior purification steps. Moreover, SEC is unsuitable for large-scale industrial production due to the limited capacity of columns. Thus, a simple and practical procedure to screen out soluble aggregates is required prior to downstream purification steps.",

Here, we fused hRID(2m) to the N-terminal of EGFP to induce the formation of soluble aggregates.

            "text": "We compared two different methods of cell disruption: sonication (a physical method) and mild lysis (B-PER; a chemical method). Since EGFP is expressed predominantly in its insoluble form in E. coli under harsh conditions (overexpression at 37 \u2022 C), hRID(2m)-fusion was used to regulate the formation of soluble aggregates. Previously, hRID (N-terminal appended domain of human lysyl tRNA synthetase) was shown to increase the solubility and folding of fused proteins, while hRID(2m) was shown to increase the abundance of soluble aggregates [13] [14] [15] . The solubility of hRID(2m)-EGFP was analyzed using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) after dividing the samples into total (T), soluble (S), and pellet (P) fractions by centrifugation ( Figure 1A ). The solubility of the protein obtained was >95% after sonication and <50% after B-PER treatment. This result was unexpected, considering that local temperature increase and free radical formation by sonication are known to promote protein aggregation [19, 20] . Interestingly, there was no significant difference in the relative fluorescence units (RFUs) despite there being a higher amount of soluble protein in the sonicated sample ( Figure 1B) . We, therefore, suspected that the folding quality of EGFP in the soluble fraction after sonication was poorer than after mild lysis, as suggested by SDS-PAGE analysis ( Figure 1C) . A chromophore is formed when EGFP is properly folded [21] . This chromophore-mature conformation has been reported to be quite stable, retaining its 3D structure even in the presence of low concentrations of detergents such as SDS; however, the fluorescence disappears after boiling [22, 23] . Without boiling, the migration velocity of EGFP in SDS-PAGE is dependent on the formation of a mature chromophore [23] . As shown in Figure 1C , sonication resulted in two different bands, one with retarded migration (~39 kDa), which was reproducibly observed in normal SDS-PAGE with heat treatment prior to gel loading ( Figure 1A) , and the other with faster migration (~32 kDa). Notably, the fast migrating lower band was fluorescent, confirming the formation of a mature chromophore, whereas the other band was not fluorescent ( Figure 1C ). A remarkable difference was observed between the two different EGFP preparations; while the lower band remained the same, the upper band was greatly enriched after sonication. After mild lysis, the pellet fraction appeared to become soluble after further sonication, as >95% of the proteins in the pellet fraction were transferred to the soluble fraction after sonication ( Figure 1D ). These results suggest that: (1) the EGFP fraction that successfully folded via chromophore formation is stably released into the soluble fraction after mild lysis, (2) incorrectly folded EGFPs are still associated with bacterial cell components that resist elution by mild lysis, and (3) the physical disruption of recombinant cells by sonication is strong enough to dissociate the incompletely folded oligomer complex into smaller sized oligomers that survive precipitation by centrifugation.

The folding behavior of EGFP was analyzed during subsequent chromatographic purification steps. The cell extract from a 500 mL E. coli culture was loaded onto a Ni-NTA column (GE The folding behavior of EGFP was analyzed during subsequent chromatographic purification steps. The cell extract from a 500 mL E. coli culture was loaded onto a Ni-NTA column (GE healthcare). EGFP was eluted in two distinctive peaks, where sonication resulted in two peaks with a slight enrichment of the later fraction (blue box) and mild lysis enriched the earlier fraction (red box) ( Figure 2A ). The purified proteins from both fractions were a similar size to those observed by SDS-PAGE, but again only the earlier fraction was fluorescent ( Figure 2B ,C). These results confirm and further extend the observations shown in Figure 1 that mild lysis, but not sonication, was able to enrich the levels of properly folded EGFP protein. These results also highlight the importance of screening properly folded proteins prior to downstream chromatographic purification steps. healthcare).

As solubility is an initial criterion for determining the quality of recombinant proteins, various approaches have been used to increase their solubility [2, 6, 10, 11] . However, guidelines for the quality assessment of soluble proteins have neither been proposed nor critically validated experimentally. Here, we employed the popular cell-lysis methods of sonication and mild lysis to examine the folding status of soluble proteins. EGFP was used as the folding reporter, owing to its distinct functional (with chromophores) and non-functional (without chromophores) forms, which can be identified by fluorescence and physico-chemical behavior in well-adapted gel electrophoresis ( Figure 1C,3C) [23] . Here, soluble aggregates of EGFP were intentionally formed using an RNA-binding defective solubility enhancer [14, 26] .",

Here, we employed the popular cell-lysis methods of sonication and mild lysis to examine the folding status of soluble proteins. EGFP was used as the folding reporter, owing to its distinct functional (with chromophores) and non-functional (without chromophores) forms, which can be identified by fluorescence and physico-chemical behavior in well-adapted gel electrophoresis ( Figures 1C and 3C ) [23] .

Despite a higher soluble fraction yield after sonication, the level of functional proteins (as quantified by fluorescence and gel mobility) was similar to that obtained after mild lysis (Figure 1 ). Purification analysis showed that the functional form of EGFP was enriched in the soluble fractions from mild lysis ( Figure 2) . Therefore, the physical disruption of bacterial cells by sonication lowered the ratio of functional proteins by increasing the proportion of non-functional aggregates within the soluble fraction. It is likely that the physical energy of sonication is strong enough to fragment non-functional aggregates into smaller aggregates, which resist precipitation by centrifugation (Figures 3 and 4) . In contrast, despite initially having a lower soluble fraction yield, mild lysis led to the enrichment of properly folded proteins. Parallel experiments using SPARC, the biochemical function of which is still uncharacterized, supported these observations; sonication resulted in the enrichment of oligomeric proteins that failed to bind the affinity resin ( Figures 5 and 6) .",

Mild lysis is much simpler than other methods, such as DLS or SEC, which are typically used in subsequent purification steps and require highly purified protein samples. With respect to volume requirement, DLS usually requires a few milliliters of purified samples for analysis. SEC has an upper limit in loading volume, so SEC is not recommended for large-scale purification. The physical limitations of these biophysical analyses highlight the need for the quality control of soluble proteins prior to downstream purification steps. The chemical refolding of inclusion bodies could be considered an alternative to soluble expression; however, this process is labor-intensive and requires high capital costs. Therefore, soluble expression has always been favored, further emphasizing the importance of soluble protein quality control. Contrary to the commonly held belief that protein aggregation is an irreversible process, we demonstrated here that initial protein precipitates can be 'solubilized' by sonication using commonly accepted laboratory practices. The high molecular weight precipitates of oligomeric complexes were solubilized by physical splitting into small soluble aggregates (Figure 4) .",

One possibility is that for multi-domain proteins, one domain is properly folded and thus highly soluble, whereas one or more remain unfolded or partially folded in an aggregation-prone state, causing the whole protein to form soluble aggregates like micelles [16] . Multi-domain proteins usually fold in a co-translational manner [27] , where the folding of the N-terminal domain significantly affects the subsequent folding of downstream C-terminal domains [28] . The induction of recombinant protein expression is typically accelerated by over-expression; thus, the continual translation of a protein in high amount may exceed the folding capacity of the recombinant host, with any imbalance between translation and folding speeds resulting in incorrectly folded aggregates [1] . These problems associated with aggregation-prone proteins can be circumvented by fusion with a highly soluble carrier protein or co-expression with a chaperone [6, 8] . These approaches often successfully increase the overall solubility of target proteins, but do not guarantee their functional quality, resulting in soluble, non-functional aggregates [16, 18] .",

The results of this study also highlight the importance of the folding environment in recombinant hosts on both the solubility and functional activity of proteins. Further progress and technical innovation is necessary to harness molecular chaperones [2, 30] or chaperna [10, [12] [13] [14] for improving the folding status of recombinant proteins. However, we believe that this study provides a rigorous evaluation of the folding quality of recombinant proteins, which may be conducive to the functional characterization of recombinant proteins for therapeutic, diagnostic, or prophylactic applications.",
