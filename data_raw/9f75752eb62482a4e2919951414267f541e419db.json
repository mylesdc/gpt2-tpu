            "text": "Although the original US porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) was confirmed as highly virulent by multiple studies, the virulence of spike-insertion deletion (S-INDEL) PEDV strains is undefined. In this study, 3-4 day-old conventional suckling piglets were inoculated with S-INDEL PEDV Iowa106 (4 pig litters) to study its virulence. Two litters of agematched piglets were inoculated with either the original US PEDV PC21A or mock as positive and negative controls, respectively. Subsequently, all pigs were challenged with the original US PEDV PC21A on 21-29 days post-inoculation (dpi) to assess cross-protection. All S-INDEL Iowa106-and the original US PC21A-inoculated piglets developed diarrhea. However, the severity of clinical signs, mortality (0-75%) and fecal PEDV RNA shedding titers varied among the four S-INDEL Iowa106-inoculated litters. Compared with the original PC21A, piglets euthanized/died acutely from S-INDEL Iowa106 infection had relatively milder villous atrophy, lower antigen scores and more limited intestinal infection. Two of four S-INDEL Iowa106-infected sows and the original PC21A-infected sow showed anorexia and watery diarrhea for 1-4 days. After the original PC21A challenge, a subset (13/16) of S-INDEL Iowa106-inoculated piglets developed diarrhea, whereas all (5/5) and no (0/4) pigs in the mock and original PC21A-inoculated pigs had diarrhea, respectively. Our results suggest that the virulence of S-INDEL PEDV Iowa106 was less than the original US PEDV PC21A in suckling pigs, with 100% morbidity and 18% (6/33) overall (0-75%) mortality in suckling pigs depending on factors such as the sow's health and lactation and the piglets' birth weight. Prior infection by S-INDEL Iowa106 provided partial cross-protection to piglets against the original PC21A challenge at 21-29 dpi. \u00a9 2015 Lin et al.

            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) is a highly contagious swine enteric disease resembling transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE). It was first recognized among English feeder and fattening pigs in 1971 [1] . Experimental inoculation with the Belgian isolate, the PED virus (PEDV) prototype CV777 strain, revealed that PEDV is enteropathogenic for both nursing and fattening pigs [2] . Subsequently, the etiological agent of PED was identified as PEDV, belonging to the Alphacoronavirus genus within the Coronaviridae family. Before the end of 2010, endemic PED had been reported in many European and Asian countries, but with low impact. The subsequent PED pandemic outbreaks started in China [3] and spread to other Asian counties, inducing high piglet mortality [4] . In April 2013, PED outbreaks occurred suddenly in US swine [5] . Piglets younger than 7 days old developed vomiting and diarrhea that led to dehydration, rapid weight loss, and death in 2-4 days, with mortality reaching 100% in suckling piglets [6] . PEDV infection also impaired the performance of surviving pigs [7] , resulting in significant economic losses to the US pork industry.",

            "text": "Sequence analysis of complete PEDV genomes revealed that the original US PEDV strains were closest to one recent Chinese strain AH2012 [8] . The high virulence of the original US PEDV strains was experimentally confirmed in gnotobiotic (Gn) piglets [9] , cesarean-derived and colostrum-deprived (CDCD) piglets [10, 11] and conventional piglets [12, 13] . Also, compared with neonatal piglets, conventional 3-4 weeks old pigs were less susceptible to the original US PEDV infection [12] [13] [14] . Concurrently, several US variant PEDV strains, characterized by insertions and deletions (INDELs) in the spike (S) gene and designated as S-INDEL PEDV, were found to be circulating in US swine farms [8, 15] . When compared with three other original US PEDV strains (USA/IN/2013/19338P7, USA/NC/2013/35140P7, and USA/NC/2013/49469P7), 5-day-old non-suckling piglets inoculated with an S-INDEL PEDV strain (USA/ IL/2014/20697) developed no clinical signs and mild histopathologic lesions [16] . The virulence of the S-INDEL PEDV in pigs in the field varied. In one report, S-INDEL PEDV OH851 strain infected pigs showed minimal to no clinical signs in pigs in the field [15] . However, recent reports described that European S-INDEL PEDV strains caused high mortality in suckling piglets in southern Germany [17] and southern Portugal [18] . Sequence analysis of partial S1 gene revealed that the Portugal PEDV strain shared 99 and 100% nucleotide identities with US S-INDEL PEDV OH851 strain and the German strains (GER/L00719/2014 and GER/L00721/2014), respectively [18] . Factors contributing to the contradictory clinical signs have not yet been clarified [19] .",

These in vivo and in vitro antigenicity and cross-protection studies suggest that S-INDEL PEDV strains may serve as vaccine candidates to protect pigs from highly virulent original US PEDV strains [20, 21] , if the S-INDEL PEDV strains are confirmed as naturally attenuated strains. Our aims were to evaluate the pathogenicity of S-INDEL PEDV Iowa106 strain in conventional suckling piglets and to examine whether infection of the piglets with this S-INDEL PEDV strain induces cross protection against diarrhea caused by a subsequent (3-4 weeks later) challenge with the original US PEDV PC21A strain.",

The intestinal contents collected from one piglet at 3 dpi were stored in aliquots at \u221280 \u00b0C and used to prepare inocula for the following 3 litters (litters B, C and D). The intestinal contents were suspended in cell culture grade phosphate buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.4; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) followed by vortexing and centrifugation at 2095 \u00d7 g for 30 min. The supernatant was collected and diluted further or filtered through 0.22 \u03bcm-pore size filters before using as inocula. The original US PEDV PC21A was collected from the intestinal contents of a 1-day-old diarrheic field pig and passaged twice in Gn piglets [9] . Based on prior experience [9, 10, 23] , the viral infectious titers in PFU were about 6 log 10 -lower than the RNA titers and PEDV infectious titer decreased about 1 log 10 after one freeze-thaw cycle or ultrafiltration (unpublished data). Therefore, the doses of each inoculum (approximately 3-4 log 10 PFU/ pig) were adjusted to the comparable titers of the 10 log 10 genomic equivalents (GE) (frozen and thawed once, without filtration) according to the inoculum preparation process ( Table 1) . The PBS was used as a mock control (litter F). In addition, no cross-contamination between original US PEDV PC21A and S-INDEL PEDV Iowa106 in each inoculum was confirmed by conventional differential RT-PCR with PEDV strain-specific primers, which amplified different sizes for the original US and S-INDEL PEDV strains (Liu and Wang, unpublished data).",

Wild type or cell culture-adapted virus, doses of inoculum [10] , environmental/animal conditions [19] and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) among US S-INDEL strains [8] could contribute to the variations observed among studies. The S-INDEL PEDV strains that emerged in southern Germany showed high nucleotide identity (99.54%) in full-length genomes with US PEDV S-INDEL strains [17] . These German S-INDEL PEDV strains resulted in large variations in mortality (67.7% and 5.5% in 3-weeks-old and less than 1 week-old suckling piglets, respectively) in two farms [17] . Most recently, outbreaks of S-INDEL PEDV in Portugal were reported, causing severe diarrhea and high mortality [18] . Similarly, litter variations on the severity of PEDV infection were observed in our study, despite the similar background of sows and environmental factors. Among the S-INDEL PEDV Iowa106-inoculated piglets, the body weight of piglets measured on the day of inoculation (0 dpi) correlated negatively with the duration of diarrhea. In the original US PEDV PC21Ainoculated litter, five surviving piglets had significantly higher body weight at 0 dpi than their non-surviving littermates. In an large scale swine farm surveillance, lower piglet birth weight and higher within-litter variability of birth weight were the factors associated with higher losses from birth to weaning [26] . During PEDV infection, it is likely that the stronger piglets obtained more milk than their smaller littermates and were more likely to survive until intestinal villi regenerated and immunity developed. In a gnotobiotic mouse model, neonatal mice with better nutritional condition and higher body weight had higher enterocyte proliferation activity, more intensive response to probiotics and shorter duration of rotavirus-induced diarrhea [27] . In the present study, milk of sows provided the only food source for the piglets. Two of four sows of S-INDEL PEDV Iowa106-inoculation group showed diarrhea and anorexia, whereas the other two were asymptomatic. Since the sows' health condition has a direct impact on the amount and quality of colostrum/milk [19] , and it is critical to the infection outcome of their piglets. Based on our results, the severity of PED was associated with virus strain, piglet birth weight and sow health/lactation status. The impact of other factors, such as genetic background and gut microflora, requires further investigation.",

Previous histopathology studies demonstrated that a high percentage of villous epithelial cells in the small intestine was infected and destroyed by virulent PEDV strains shortly after clinical signs appeared [2, 5, 9, 28] . In both prototype PEDV CV777-and the original US PEDV US/Iowa/18984/2013A-inoculated CDCD piglets, PEDV antigen-positive enterocytes decreased from 1 to 2 dpi and then increased at 3-4 dpi [2, 11] . In the present study, we assessed the kinetics of virus growth in the intestine via quantitatively testing the daily rectal swab samples by RT-qPCR. In agreement with the above results, the first and also the highest peak of PEDV RNA fecal shedding titer was detected on the day of onset of clinical signs in both PEDV S-INDEL Iowa106-and the original US PC21A-inoculated litters. Afterward the titers of fecal PEDV RNA shedding decreased rapidly and then rebounded ( Figure 1) . Interestingly, the intervals (3-6 days) between fecal PEDV RNA shedding peaks were compatible with the reported typical replacement time of small intestinal villous epithelium in suckling piglets [29] . Since the replication of PEDV is sustained in enterocytes, this observation provided indirect evidence that both S-INDEL PEDV Iowa106 and the original US PEDV PC21A severely damaged the infected enterocytes and may spread to infect regenerating new enterocytes.",

Although piglet infection by S-INDEL PEDV Iowa106 also caused severe clinical signs in two litters (litter B and C), generally, the virulence of S-INDEL PEDV Iowa106 was lower than that of the original US PEDV strains as evident by: (1) a longer incubation time (delayed onset of clinical signs and the peak of viral RNA shedding); (2) a shorter duration of diarrhea; (3) relatively higher VH:CD ratios; (4) a lower percentage of PEDVpositive enterocytes; (5) more limited regions of virus infection (crypt not involved); and (6) overall lower piglet mortality (18 vs 55%) ( Table 2 ). In addition, the profiles of fecal viral RNA shedding differed between the two PEDV strains. Typically, a biphasic curve with 3-6 day intervals between the two peaks ( Figure 1C ) was observed in S-INDEL Iowa106-inoculated piglets. On the other hand, a time-dependent and gradual downward-sloping curve ( Figure 1D ) was observed in the original US PEDV PC21A-inoculated piglets. These findings suggest that the replication kinetics of S-INDEL PEDV Iowa106 in piglets may be slower than that of the original US PEDV. The infection of S-INDEL is less severe than original US PEDV strains but varies, depending upon whether the sow also becomes ill with reduced milk production. Presumably, decreased pathogenicity of S-INDEL PEDV Iowa106 allowed time for the damaged intestinal villi to be re-populated with new enterocytes, leading to the survival of infected piglets.",

            "text": "It is clearly established that the severity of PEDV infection is highly dependent on the age of pigs [12, 13, 25] . In the present study, one litter of mock-inoculated piglets was challenged with the original US PEDV PC21A (10 and 12 log 10 GE/pig) at 29-and 32-days of age, respectively. However, only the repeated challenge with a 2 log 10 -higher dose induced mild clinical signs. In contrast, in the 3-day-old piglets (litter E), a lower dose (10 log 10 GE/pig) of the original US PEDV PC21A could cause severe clinical signs. In one recent study, the minimal PEDV infectious dose in 5-day-old piglets was determined to be approximately 2 log 10 lower than that in 21-day-old pigs [13] . The age-dependent resistance to PEDV infection [12, 13, 25] was again confirmed in this study. A longer time for replacement of villous epithelial cells [12, 29] , a higher abundance of viral receptor expression [30] and the immature innate immune system in piglets less than 1-week of age have been proposed to explain the fatal TGEV or PEDV infection in young piglets. On the other hand, the sows were continuously exposed to high titers (>11 log 10 GE/mL) of PEDV shed from their infected piglets. It is possible that lactating sows are more susceptible to enteric infection due to physiological changes associated with farrowing and lactation. In the present study, the sows had watery diarrhea. It is compatible to the previous field observations of sows during the original US PEDV [5] and Germany S-INDEL PEDV [17] outbreaks.",

However, vaccines based on European and historic PEDV strains failed to control the more recent virulent PEDV outbreaks in Asia [19, 31] , suggesting the possibility of antigenic variation among different PEDV strains [19, 20] . In the present study, a high dose (12 log 10 GE/pig) of the original US PEDV challenge induced clinical signs in two S-INDEL PEDV Iowa106-inoculated pig litters (litter C and D), but not in the homologous strain-inoculated pig litter (litter E). An S-INDEL PEDV Iowa106-inoculated litter (litter A) challenged with 2 log 10 lower dose of the original US PEDV PC21A (litter A) was excluded and no clinical signs were detected in these pigs. Our results suggest that the immunity induced by S-INDEL PEDV Iowa106 infection only partially protected pigs from the original US PEDV disease, which may result from antigenic variation between the original US and S-INDEL PEDV strains [19, 20] . However, other factors also need to be considered: (1) All piglets in litters C and D survived from S-INDEL PEDV Iowa106 infection and, subsequently, were challenged with the original US PEDV PC21A at 27-days of age. However, only 45% of piglets in litter E survived from the original US PEDV PC21A inoculation. These piglets had higher birth weights and may have been less affected by PEDV infection than their non-surviving littermates; (2) The effect of material antibodies may be affected by the titer of protective antibody in milk and the amount of milk, which sows provide to their piglets;",

These PEDV IHC positive-stained mononuclear cells in lymph nodes were interpreted to be macrophages in recent studies [10, 11] . It is reported that piglets developed adaptive immunity around 7 dpi [14] . Our previous study showed that PEDV infection impaired the tight junctions of the villous epithelium [33] . PEDV-induced enteritis could attract macrophages to the gut. Development of mucosal immunity and increased permeability of the intestinal barrier could facilitate uptake of PEDV by macrophages and/or dendritic cells from the intestinal lumen.",

The severity of clinical signs induced by PEDV is associated with multiple factors, such as the birth weight of the piglets and the sow's health/lactation status. In addition, a minority (19%, 3/16) of the piglets recovered from S-INDEL PEDV Iowa106 infection were fully protected from disease after a high challenge dose of the original US PEDV PC21A. Considering the safety and effectiveness, S-INDEL PEDV Iowa106 is not currently a suitable live vaccine to protect piglets from the highly virulent original US PEDV strains. Several original US PEDV strains, including PC21A, and S-INDEL PEDV Iowa106 strain have been successfully isolated from cell culture in our laboratory [23] . Evaluating the relatedness",
