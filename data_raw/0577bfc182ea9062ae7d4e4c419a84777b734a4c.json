Our study is aimed to investigate the current application, efficacy and safety of ECMO in for severe H7N9 pneumonia-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in the Chinese population. Methods: A multicentre retrospective cohort study was conducted at 20 hospitals that admitted patients with avian influenza A (H7N9) viral pneumonia patients' admission from 9 provinces in China between October 1, 2016, and March 1, 2017. Data from the National Health and Family Planning Commission of China, including general conditions, outcomes and ECMO management, were analysed. Then, successfully weaned and unsuccessfully weaned groups were compared. Results: A total of 35 patients, aged 57 \u00b1 1 years, were analysed; 65.7% of patients were male with 63% mortality. All patients underwent invasive positive pressure ventilation (IPPV), and rescue ventilation strategies were implemented for 23 cases (65.7%) with an average IPPV duration of 5 \u00b1 1 d, PaO 2 /FiO 2 of 78 \u00b1 23 mmHg, tidal volume (VT) of 439 \u00b1 61 ml and plateau pressure (P plat ) of 29 \u00b1 8 cmH 2 O pre-ECMO. After 48 h on ECMO, PaO 2 improved from 56 \u00b1 21 mmHg to 90 \u00b1 24 mmHg and PaCO 2 declined from 52 \u00b1 24 mmHg to 38 \u00b1 24 mmHg. Haemorrhage, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and barotrauma occurred in 45.7%, 60% and 8.6% of patients, respectively. Compared with successfully weaned patients (n = 14), the 21 unsuccessfully weaned patients had a longer duration of IPPV pre-ECMO (6 \u00b1 4 d vs. 2 \u00b1 1 d, P < 0.01) as well as a higher P plat (25 \u00b1 5 cmH 2 O vs. 21 \u00b1 3 cmH 2 O, P < 0.05) and VT (343 \u00b1 96 ml vs. 246 \u00b1 93 ml, P < 0.05) after 48 h on ECMO support. Furthermore, the unsuccessfully weaned group had a higher mortality (100% vs. 7.1%, P < 0.01) with more haemorrhage (77.3% vs. 28.6%, P < 0.01).",

However, severe ARDS induced by avian influenza A (H7N9) pneumonia might manifest as refractory hypoxaemia even with appropriate invasive positive pressure ventilation (IPPV) support. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is the ultimate respiratory support method and directly improves the oxygenation and ventilation of patients as well as enables implementation of the \"lung protective ventilation strategy\" [3] . ECMO was the breakthrough treatment for the severe avian influenza A (H1N1) outbreak of 2009 and reduced mortality from this outbreak [4] [5] [6] . Therefore, we believe that ECMO could also be effective for other types of severe viral pneumonia.",

A few studies [17, 20, 21, 22] have shown that the mortality of pH1N1-induced ARDS was reduced to 21-61% following ECMO treatment. Presently, no studies with large samples have investigated the mortality of H7N9-induced ARDS, while the in-hospital mortality was as high as 63% in our study. Late initiation of ECMO, inappropriate IPPV settings during ECMO, and more ECMO complications might explain the relatively high mortality. Moreover, as a multicentre collaboration study, the experiences of ECMO varied among the centres (Additional file 4), which might be another reason for the high mortality. According to the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (ELSO) data [23, 24] , ECMO is indicated when death risk exceeds 80%, i.e., when PaO 2 /FiO 2 < 80 mmHg on FiO 2 > 90% and the Murray score is 3-4. Our patients met the indications for ECMO support. The duration of MV for more than 7 days pre-ECMO is an important prognostic factor for death [25] . For patients in the successfully weaned group, the duration of IPPV pre-ECMO was 5 \u00b1 1 d; however, the duration was even longer among patients in the unsuccessfully weaned group (6 \u00b1 4 d). Moreover, rescue ventilation strategies were implemented for most patients before ECMO, which partially delayed the timing of ECMO. In comparison, ECMO was initiated at 2 h (1-5 h) after IPPV among patients with pH1N1 in Australia and New Zealand in 2009 [5] , which was significantly shorter than that in our cases. Therefore, we emphasized early implementation of ECMO in our patients.",

            "text": "The principle of IPPV during ECMO is the \"lung rest strategy\" [26] . The REVA registry study examined 123 patients with pH1N1-induced ARDS [6] and showed that the high P plat (29 cmH 2 O) on day 1 of ECMO was related to high mortality. In our study, the pre-ECMO P plat level was high (29 \u00b1 8 cmH 2 O). High P plat can lead to overdistension of the alveoli and cause lung volutrauma. The shear force between the overdistended and collapsed alveoli further aggregates VILI [27] , which ultimately increases mortality. Although the P plat values [28] showed that a high PEEP level within 3 d of being on ECMO was related to decreased mortality. Although no difference was observed in the PEEP levels between the two groups, we speculated that the down-regulation of PEEP during ECMO might have further aggravated the occurrence of collapse-induced injury, which led to atelectasis and sputum discharge obstacles. Therefore, the IPPV parameters, including high P plat and VT levels and low PEEP settings, might have been unreasonable in our study; lung rest or the maintenance of open alveoli was not achieved. The incidence of an ECMO oxygenator thrombus, haemorrhage, and organ failure in our study was high, which suggests that some problems existed in the anticoagulation management and organ supportive treatment of ECMO. We found that the unsuccessfully weaned group had larger fluctuations in ACT (the difference between ACT max and ACT min were larger) during the early stage of anticoagulation. This effect might suggest relatively unstable anticoagulation and a higher risk of haemorrhage. Moreover, the incidence rate of VAP during ECMO was as high as 60% and was partially attributed to the long course of H7N9 pneumonia and the prolonged duration of IPPV. Therefore, intensification of airway management was extremely necessary.",

Early initiation of ECMO with appropriate IPPV settings and anticoagulation strategies are necessary to reduce complications. Fig. 2 Comparison of IPPV parameters and ABGs between two groups of patients on ECMO. For the successfully weaned group compared to the unsuccessfully weaned group, FiO 2 was 46 \u00b1 13% vs. 74 \u00b1 25%, respectively, at 48 h (P < 0.01) and 45 \u00b1 11% vs. 78 \u00b1 24%, respectively, at 72 h (P < 0.01). The monitored P plat was 21 \u00b1 3 cmH 2 O vs. 25 \u00b1 5 cmH 2 O, respectively, at 48 h (P < 0.05) and 19 \u00b1 4 cmH 2 O vs. 29 \u00b1 6 cmH 2 O, respectively, at 72 h (P < 0.01).

However, there were no differences in PEEP during ECMO between the two groups. Patients who were in the unsuccessfully weaned group compared to patients in the successfully weaned group had severe acidosis (pH: 7.29 \u00b1 0.14 vs. 7.40 \u00b1 0.05, respectively, (P < 0.01), a higher PaCO 2 (57.0 \u00b1 16.7 mmHg vs. 43.6 \u00b1 13.0 mmHg, respectively, (P < 0.05), and a higher lactate concentration (3.6 \u00b1 2.1 mmol/L vs. 1.7 \u00b1 0.8 mmol/L, respectively (P < 0.05), pre-ECMO. The pH and PaCO 2 did not significantly differ between the two groups during ECMO therapy, while patients who eventually weaned successfully from ECMO had a gradual ascending tendency in PaO 2 at 48 and 72 h on ECMO and a sustained low level of lactate after ECMO therapy",
