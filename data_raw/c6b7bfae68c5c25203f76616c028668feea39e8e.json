            "text": "poorly understood. In this study, we used ex vivo invasion assays and population genetic analyses to investigate the involvement of complement receptor 1 (CR1) in P. vivax invasion. First, we observed that P. vivax invasion of reticulocytes was consistently reduced when CR1 surface expression was reduced through enzymatic cleavage, in the presence of naturally low-CR1-expressing cells compared with high-CR1-expressing cells, and with the addition of soluble CR1, a known inhibitor of P. falciparum invasion. Immuno-precipitation experiments with P. vivax Reticulocyte Binding Proteins showed no evidence of complex formation. In addition, analysis of CR1 genetic data for worldwide human populations with different exposure to malaria parasites show significantly higher frequency of CR1 alleles associated with low receptor expression on the surface of RBCs and higher linkage disequilibrium in human populations exposed to P. vivax malaria compared with unexposed populations. These results are consistent with a positive selection of low-CR1-expressing alleles in vivax-endemic areas. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that CR1 availability on the surface of RBCs modulates P. vivax",

            "text": "Plasmodium vivax is the most widespread human malaria parasite outside sub-Saharan Africa, with 2.5 billion people at risk of infection and tens of millions of cases every year 1 . During the asexual cycle, parasites in the human blood invade, grow, and multiply inside young red blood cells (RBCs), bursting at the schizont stage and releasing merozoites into the blood circulation to invade new reticulocytes. RBC invasion is a complex, multi-step process that involves merozoite attachment, apical reorientation, tight junction formation, and host cell invagination and penetration. In addition, it requires the orchestration of multiple ligand-receptor interactions throughout the different steps of the process 2 . While many of the parasite-host interactions engaged in invasion have been characterized through well-established culture techniques and advanced genetic technologies for Plasmodium falciparum 2,3 , research on P. vivax invasion mechanisms continues to lag behind owing to the lack of a reliable long-term in vitro culture system dependent on a continuous source of reticulocytes 4,5 . A deeper understanding of the mechanisms involved in the process of P. vivax invasion is essential for designing meaningful strategies to prevent P. vivax infections. However, the only well-characterized, essential ligand-receptor interaction that has been identified to date is that between the Duffy antigen receptor for chemokines (DARC) on RBCs and P. vivax Duffy binding protein (PvDBP) 6 . P. vivax infections are rare in sub-Saharan African populations, where a silencing mutation in the Duffy blood group is present at near fixation levels 7 . However, recent reports of P. vivax infections in Duffy-negative individuals 8 , together with recently described receptor-ligand interactions 9-11 and potential parasite ligands to unknown receptors 12 , paint a much more complex scenario with multiple host-parasite interactions yet to be well characterized.",

            "text": "During reticulocyte maturation, the RBC membrane goes through intense remodeling of its surface in a process that results in a significant reduction and loss of receptors such as complement receptor 1 (CR1, CD35). CR1 is a type 1 transmembrane protein whose expression is reduced 3.5-fold during reticulocyte maturation 13 . It has an immune-regulatory role in complement activation and removes C3b-and C4b-containing immune complexes from the blood circulation 14 . It is also a known receptor for P. falciparum invasion through binding with the PfRh4 parasite ligand 15,16 and for rosetting through interaction with the parasite's erythrocyte membrane protein-1 (PfEMP-1) 17 . CR1 protein levels on the surface of RBCs are genetically determined by low (L) and high (H) expression alleles that result in the production of high (HH), medium (HL), or low (LL) levels of CR1. Two CR1 SNPs SNPs are under linkage disequilibrium (LD) in both Caucasians and Africans 23 . An association between low CR1 expression and protection against severe P. falciparum malaria has been reported in some epidemiological studies 19,24-26 but not in others 21,27 , illustrating a complex relationship between CR1 and susceptibility to P. falciparum infection and disease. To the best of our knowledge, the involvement of CR1 in P. vivax invasion has not yet been investigated.",

To explore this hypothesis, we performed ex vivo invasion assays under different experimental conditions and investigated signals of positive selection in the CR1 gene using SNP data from worldwide populations.",

            "text": "cleavage of red blood cell receptors has been extensively used to investigate invasion pathways in P. falciparum parasites [28] [29] [30] . To investigate the profile of P. vivax invasion, high-CR1-expressing (H-CR1) reticulocyte-enriched RBCs (reRBCs) ( Figure S1 ) were treated with neuraminidase (removes sialic acid residues), trypsin (cleaves several unknown receptors in addition to CR1) and chymotrypsin (cleaves several unknown receptors in addition to CR1 and DARC). Efficient cleavage of CR1 was confirmed by flow cytometry following antibody labeling with anti-CR1 antibody (Fig. 1a) . The capacity of the treated cells for invasion was confirmed with the P. falciparum 3D7 strain (Fig. 1b) , which results are in agreement with previous findings [31] [32] [33] . P. vivax invasion was reduced by 18.9% (SD 28.74%, N = 5 isolates, signed rank p = 0.13) with neuraminidase treatment, 45.69% (SD 18.26%, N = 5 isolates, signed rank p = 0.043, range 33-78%) with trypsin treatment, and 96% (SD 7%, N = 5 isolates, signed rank p = 0.043) with chymotrypsin treatment (Fig. 1c , Table S1 ). The results demonstrate that P. vivax invasion is sensitive to treatment with chymotrypsin and trypsin. The latest reduced P. vivax invasion efficiency by half in the presence of an intact DARC, suggesting that one or more trypsin-sensitive receptors (e.g., CR1) are involved in the process of P. vivax invasion.",

In our case, incubation of neuraminidase-treated H-CR1 reRBCs (Table 1) with sCR1 reduced P. falciparum 3D7 invasion by 90%, confirming previous results (Fig. 3 ). In the case of P. vivax, incubation of H-CR1 reRBCs with sCR1 (50 \u03bcg/ml) significantly reduced invasion by 42.5% (SD 14.6%, N = 9 isolates, signed rank, p = 0.007) (Fig. 3) . These results indicate that sCR1 directly binds to an unrecognized P. vivax ligand and that this interaction reduces binding between P. vivax parasites and native CR1 on reticulocytes. The observed reduction in invasion capacity is comparable to that observed for L-CR1 reRBCs compared with H-CR1-reRBCs. www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Lack of binding between sCR1 and recombinant P. vivax PvRBP parasite ligands. PvRBPs are homologues of the PfRh family in P. falciparum 34 . It is known that PfRh4 binds to CR1 to mediate glycophorin independent parasite invasion 16 . As our previous results indicate that CR1 has a role in P. vivax invasion, we questioned if a member of the PvRBP family might be the corresponding P. vivax parasite ligand for CR1. To test this hypothesis, we performed immuno-precipitation experiments using sCR1, PfRH4 (88 kDa) and five recombinant PvRBP fragments, PvRBP1a, PvRBP1b, PvRBP2a, PvRBP2b, and PvRBP2c, which migrate at 118, 133, 114, 152 and 94 kDa respectively under reducing conditions (Fig. 4) . While anti-CR1 monoclonal HB8592 successfully immuno-precipitated sCR1, we saw no evidence of complex formation with any of the PvRBP fragments tested, www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ suggesting that PvRBPs are not direct ligands for CR1. On the other hand, as expected, we observed that anti-CR1 monoclonal HB8592 successfully immuno-precipitated sCR1 in complex with PfRh4.",

We observed that reduced CR1 availability on reRBCs decreased the efficiency of P. vivax invasion, even in the presence of an intact DARC. We therefore hypothesized that CR1 genotypes associated with reduced CR1 expression on the surface of reticulocytes may confer protection against P. vivax infection, possibly reflecting positive selection on L alleles in areas exposed to or with a history of exposure to vivax malaria. Positive selection on one allele can be detected by an unusually fast increase in allele frequency in one population relative to another 35 and extended LD surrounding the allele of interest 36 . To explore our hypothesis, we investigated the frequency of CR1 alleles associated with the L-CR1 phenotype through a meta-analysis of peer-reviewed articles and publicly available data. We first confirmed a LD R 2 \u2265 0.8 for the CR1 exon 22 (rs2274567) and intron 27 (rs11118133) alleles in populations sampled within the 1000 Genomes Project (Table S2) 23 . Using data mining of publicly available databases we identified a SNP in intron 26 (rs11118131), which was in LD (R 2 \u2265 0.8) with exon 22 in non-African populations (Table 2 ). LD between exon 22 and intron 26 was further confirmed by genotyping samples from Vietnam, Thailand, Greece, Belgium, Peru, and Brazil. We included intron 26 in the analysis of CR1 allele frequencies to target additional genotyping data from populations in which exon 22 and intron 27 data were not available. We then analyzed the worldwide distribution of CR1 alleles for intron 27 (rs11118133), exon 22 (rs2274567), and intron 26 (rs11118131), hereafter referred to as L-CR1 alleles. In total, data mining and in-house genotyping retrieved L-CR1 allele data for 34,625 individuals from 177 locations across 61 countries (Fig. 5a, Table S3 ).",

In brief, several limitations have to be taken into account when performing P. vivax invasion assays: (1) the low parasite densities (0.5%-0.01%) in most field/clinical isolates of P. vivax, while >0.1% parasite density is needed to ensure a successful invasion, (2) high proportion of rings (\u226580%) are necessary for a successful invasion, (3) ex vivo adaptation is extremely variable between parasite isolates and this may be partially explained by inherent characteristics of the parasite 41 , (4) several samples produce a high proportion of gametocyte during the maturation process and are thus discarded, and (5) cryopreserved parasites show lower invasion efficiency than fresh isolates 42 . The limitations in the number of P. vivax isolates with the correct criteria to perform ex-vivo invasion assays and the number of samples that maturate successfully and present an optimal invasion rate (untreated control well), together with the need to reduce assay variability greatly limit the number of conditions that can be tested with one parasite isolate. Nevertheless, the recent increase in the number of publications using P. vivax ex vivo assays 43, 44 demonstrates the usefulness of this tool to investigate molecular mechanisms related to parasite invasion.",

In this regard, CD71 availability on reRBCs was confirmed by flow cytometry and by demonstrating the ability of P. vivax isolates to invade heterogeneous CD71 +ve populations (with variable levels of CD71) 44 . In addition, the invasion rates observed are comparable to rates previously reported for different reticulocyte sou rces 5, 40, 42, [45] [46] [47] . Finally, we observed consistently significant invasion inhibition in different experiments using both natural CR1 expression variations of the reRBCs and biochemical approaches to modify CR1 presence at the reRBC surface. In this regard, our findings of a decrease in P. vivax invasion in trypsin-treated cells contradicts previous www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ observations 48, 49 , although a trypsin-sensitive in vitro binding between TfR1-PvRBP2b has been demonstrated to be critical for the recognition of reticulocytes during P. vivax invasion 43 . Discrepancies with previous studies can be at least partially explained by differences in the experimental conditions. In Barnwell et al. 48 the source and enriched proportion of used reticulocytes is unknown, the authors use a single P. vivax Belem strain maintained in squirrel monkey, invasion is monitored after 8-10 hours of incubation, while information on invasion rates is lacking. In comparison with Malleret et al., who used 0.5 mg of trypsin for the digestion treatment 49 , here we used a higher concentration that proved (by flow cytometer) to remove CR1 from the surface of reticulocytes.",

The discontinuous black line represents a significant increase in frequency (L \u2265 0.29, p \u2264 0.048) compared with the malaria free group, whereas the discontinuous red line indicates a significant increase in frequency (L \u2265 0.33, p \u2264 0.040) compared with the African group. (b) The map shows a significant increase in the frequency of the L allele in global populations where P. vivax transmission is or was stable. Gray shaded areas indicate P. vivax transmission boundaries between the mid-17 th century and the early 20 th century and light pink areas indicate transmission boundaries in the late 20 th century. P. vivax approximate boundaries were derived from a previously published figure with permission 79 . Red dots show populations with a significant increase in L allele frequency compared with malaria-free areas (L \u2265 0.29, p < 0.05), whereas blue dots are indicative of a non-significant increase. The sources of the L allele frequencies are described in S3",

A 200-Kb region on chromosome 1 spanning the CR1 gene (1000 Genomes Project Phase 3 data) was scanned using the LDlink tool to estimate the number of proxy SNPs for exon 22 (rs2274567). A higher number of proxy SNPs for a given SNP is indicative of stronger LD. The number of proxy SNPs for exon 22 was significantly lower in African than non-African populations (1000 Genomes Project Phase 3). (b) Physical distance under LD with exon 22 SNP (rs2274567) was analyzed using global population data from the 1000 Genomes Project. Proxy SNPs present in all selected populations were plotted to show the physical distance of each SNP and its R 2 with respect to exon 22 (rs2274567) (a maximum of one SNPs every 500 bp for better visualization of the LD effect). Data from the 1000 Genomes Project were analyzed by pooling human populations from Africa (ASW, YRI, ESN, LWK, MAG, MSL, ACB), Europe (CEU, TSI, FIN, GBR, IBS), East Asia (JPT, KHV, CHB, CHS, CDX), South Asia (PJL, GIH, ITU, STU, BEB) and America (MXL, PUR, CLM, PEL). Position zero on the X axis indicates the location of exon 22 SNP (rs2274567), while CR1 gene spanned from \u221285000 to 75000 bp. The Y axis shows R 2 values. Different shapes indicate SNPs R 2 values in populations from Europe (green triangle), East Asia (white square), South Asia (blue circle), Africa (black circle) and America (pink rhombus). The dotted black line crossing the Y axis indicates the LD threshold (R 2 \u22650.8). The physical distance of the CR1 gene under LD in African pooled-populations (dotted line: ~18 Kb; \u22124,400 bp to 13,500 bp) was significantly lower (p \u2264 0.001) compared to pooled populations from Europe, East Asia, South Asia and America (continuous black line: ~130 kb, \u221275,000 bp to 54,000 bp).",
