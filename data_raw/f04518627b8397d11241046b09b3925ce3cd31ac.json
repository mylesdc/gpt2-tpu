Among cargoes, recombinant proteins offer therapeutic promise but the lack of effective delivery methods limits their development. Here, we achieve protein and SpCas9 or AsCas12a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) delivery to cultured human well-differentiated airway epithelial cells and mouse lungs with engineered amphiphilic peptides. These shuttle peptides, non-covalently combined with GFP protein or CRISPR-associated nuclease (Cas) RNP, allow rapid entry into cultured human ciliated and non-ciliated epithelial cells and mouse airway epithelia. Instillation of shuttle peptides combined with SpCas9 or AsCas12a RNP achieves editing of loxP sites in airway epithelia of ROSA mT/mG mice. We observe no evidence of short-term toxicity with a widespread distribution restricted to the respiratory tract. This peptide-based technology advances potential therapeutic avenues for protein and Cas RNP delivery to refractory airway epithelial cells.",

Modifying airway epithelia with therapeutic proteins, gene expression cassettes, or genome-editing reagents offers great promise, but efficacious delivery is a common challenge. This is because the respiratory epithelium presents barriers through its specialized cell types, secreted host defense factors, and mucociliary transport 1 . While in vivo delivery with vector systems has advanced 2-7 , airway epithelia remain poorly transduced by many viral and non-viral approaches [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] .",

The first-generation shuttles were designed by fusing the endosomolytic peptide CM18 and the CPP PTD4 with six-histidine tags, at one or both ends of the peptide (CM18-PTD4) 35 . The activity of CM18-PTD4 constructs was demonstrated by delivering different protein cargoes to multiple cell types. We then further modified peptide sequences to increase their delivery efficacy 37 . Here, we present a subset of three rationally designed peptides termed Shuttle10 (S10), Shuttle18 (S18), and Shuttle85 (S85). Figure 1a shows peptide sequences aligned with CM18-PTD4. While the peptides share features, including an improved hydrophobic cluster derived from the CM18 domain and an optimized hydrophilic/cationic tail derived from the cell-penetrating PTD4 peptide, they diverge in others. In addition to their variable length (25-34 amino acids), S10 contains five highly hydrophobic residues in the CM18-derived domain, while S18 and S85 have eight, the S85 linker was reduced to a single glycine, and the PTD4-derived domain of S18 contains six cationic residues compared to four in S10 and S85. Using these three rationally designed peptides, we demonstrate improved editing of NK cells when co-incubated with Cas12a RNP for 90 s. Figure 1b presents the editing measured at the NKG2A locus following Cas12a RNP delivery to NK cells. RNP delivery by S10, S18, or S85 improved editing, achieving indels of 25%, 23%, and 26%, respectively, compared to the previously reported CM18-PTD4 that enabled 10% editing 35 .",

As shuttle peptides enabled Cas12a RNP delivery to NK cells, we hypothesized that they could deliver proteins and Cas RNPs to hard-to-transduce well-differentiated primary cultures of human airway epithelial (HAE) cells (Fig. 1c ). As differences in peptide length, hydrophobicity, linker, and charge may influence delivery efficiency when applied to new cell types, we first test the feasibility of peptide-mediated delivery in HAE with CM18-PTD4, S10, S18, and S85 using GFP protein. Shuttle peptides were combined with recombinant nuclear-targeted GFP protein and applied to the apical surface for 15 min, and then the GFP signal was quantified by fluorescence imaging (Fig. 1d, left panel) . At a 20 \u00b5M concentration, S10 achieved the greatest GFP delivery. En face images demonstrated GFP signal throughout the epithelium (Fig. 1d, right panel) . Similar results were obtained when the same four shuttle peptides were used to transfer GFP protein to primary cultures of porcine tracheal epithelia, a large animal model of CF 38, 39 (Supplementary Fig. 1) . To identify the cell types transduced in human airway epithelia, we co-localized GFP and specific cell type markers. Fifteen minutes after applying S10 and GFP, we observed GFP-positive (GFP + ) nuclei in cells positive for acetylated \u03b1-tubulin, a ciliated cell marker (Fig. 1e , left panel, white arrows). GFP also co-localized with non-ciliated cells (Fig. 1e , left panel, white arrowheads) and Muc5AC, a marker of goblet (secretory) cells (Fig. 1e , right panel, white arrowhead). By morphometric analysis, the S10 transduction efficiency ranged from 27 to 35% for all cell types of the surface epithelium (32 \u00b1 2.0, mean \u00b1 SE, n = 3). We also applied the S10 peptide and GFP to the apical surface of freshly excised human tracheal tissue explants. One hour later, GFP + nuclei co-localized with ciliated and non-ciliated surface epithelia (Fig. 1f) .",

As a proof of principle, we delivered Cas12a RNP targeting CFTR intron 22-23 to HAE from non-CF donors with the four shuttle peptides used to deliver GFP.

We assessed Cas12a RNP-induced indels using the Surveyor assay and quantified by Sanger sequencing 3 days after delivery (Fig. 2b) . We observed an indel frequency of 9-26%, with S10 conferring the most efficient Cas12a RNP delivery. Figure 2c , d shows the effects of S10 dose and duration of incubation on editing efficiency. While increasing the peptide concentration improved editing, the duration of incubation did not. To investigate the editing efficiency of Cas12a RNPs for another target, we selected the HPRT1 locus (Fig. 2e ). S10 and S85 achieved the greatest indel% (Fig. 2e) . We also tested a Cas9 RNPs designed to CFTR exon 11 in non-CF epithelia (Fig. 2f) . CFTR exon 11 is the site of the common F508del mutation.

We observed no significant differences in BAL cell counts and neutrophil or macrophage abundance between PBS-treated animals and those receiving S10 alone or S10 and Cas9 RNP (Fig. 5a) . Histopathologic scoring demonstrated no evidence of increased pulmonary inflammation or injury in any group (Fig. 5b) . Transient increases in chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 5, interleukin-15, and interleukin-10 mRNA were observed in the peptide-Cas9 RNP treatment group 1 day after delivery (Supplementary Fig. 4 ). These findings resolved by day 7.",

Several viral vectors 3,6,46 , non-viral liposomes 21, 47, 48 , and other nanoparticle formulations are in development to address delivery challenges 49, 50 , but none have advanced to widespread clinical utility. While some viral vectors overcome delivery barriers 4,5,51 , they are complex biologics and genetic payloads may exceed the capacity of some vectors. Non-viral DNA delivery approaches were also used in airway epithelia but remain inefficient, may elicit inflammatory responses following aerosol delivery 47,52-54 , or lead to endosomal or lysosomal entrapment 8, 11 . The use of Cas RNP rather than coding mRNA or DNA offers advantages in a therapeutic context by limiting genome exposure to editing machinery and decreasing off-target events 16 . With relatively good agreement, these studies suggest that engineered peptides confer effective and non-toxic protein and Cas9 or Cas12a RNP transfer into airway epithelia in vitro and in vivo.

This finding encouraged further testing in well-differentiated epithelial cells. Following the application of shuttle peptides with GFP protein or Cas RNPs to the apical surface of HAE, rapid and widespread entry was observed in ciliated, non-ciliated, and goblet cells. Remarkably, protein delivery was also confirmed in human tracheal tissue explants. Achieving robust delivery in hard-to-transduce NK cells, a primary immune cell cultured in suspension, and airway cells, a well-differentiated epithelium, suggest that this peptide technology represents an advance for targeting other difficult-totransduce human cells.",

This delivery strategy offers promise for gene editing and may allow modification of accessible progenitor cell types of the airway and alveolar regions 55 extensions that reach the airway lumen 58 . Additionally, repeat administration appears feasible. The shuttle peptides also address some of the inefficiencies and toxicities of non-viral systems. The peptides are quickly degraded 35 and delivery was confined to epithelia of the respiratory tract. The simplicity of the peptide design offers an alternative to small molecules and viral vectors, as the peptides provide both rapid protein delivery and rapid onset of effect. The demonstrated RNP-mediated gene editing may offer therapeutic opportunities for removing aberrant splice sites. One example is CF, where studies examined the relationship between the percentage of cells expressing CFTR and transepithelial Cl \u2212 secretion [59] [60] [61] [62] [63] . With relatively good agreement, they suggest that correcting CFTR in 5-15% of cells should restore Cl \u2212 secretion to near wild-type levels, editing activity within the range achieved in this study. Additional challenges remain to attain a therapeutic end, including the methods for codelivery of homologous recombination templates, the identification of alternate CRISPR nucleases or base editors 64, 65 , and evaluation in larger animal models 38 .",

Direct comparisons of nuclease activities are challenging as multiple factors may influence the observed editing efficiency. Indeed, the intrinsic activity of each nuclease may differ, but the delivery efficiencies also greatly influence efficacy. While sharing similar sizes (SpCas9, 170 kDa and AsCas12a, 156 kDa), a major characteristic likely influencing delivery is the net negative charge density contributed by their respective gRNAs. AsCas12a, a type V CRISPR protein, uses a simple crRNA (CRISPR RNA) (42 nucleotides (nts)), and SpCas9, a type II CRISPR protein, requires a crRNA and a tracrRNA (trans-activating crRNA) (~100 nts). While the Cas9/crRNA/tracrRNA complex can be delivered using lipids or electroporation in cells responsive to these transfection methods 16, 35 , the shorter crRNA appears to reduce the Cas12a efficiency using DNA delivery methods. For example, including a DNA carrier in electroporation solutions or increasing the crRNA length both improve Cas12a delivery by some methods 66 . In contrast, we observed that adding the longer cRNA/tracrRNA or Cas9 RNP to a protein cargo reduced shuttle peptide-mediated protein delivery (Supplementary Fig. 6 ).",

Finally, as the Cas9 and Cas12a PAMs differ in the design of their gRNA, it is not possible to compare nuclease activities using the same gRNA or the same targeted sequence. Interestingly, to cleave the loxP sequence with Cas12a, a CTTC PAM in the loxP was used, opening the possibility to target any Cre-lox-based reporter.
