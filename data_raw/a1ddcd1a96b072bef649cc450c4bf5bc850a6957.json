Thiazolidine and thiazolidinone-related compounds belong to the widely studied heterocycles from a medicinal chemistry perspective. From the chemical point of view, they are perfect heterodienes to undergo hetero-Diels-Alder reaction with a variety of dienophiles, yielding regio-and diastereoselectively thiopyranothiazole scaffolds. The annealing of thiazole and thiopyran cycles in condensed heterosystem is a precondition for the \"centers conservative\" creation of the ligand-target binding complex and can promote a potential selectivity to biotargets. The review covers possible therapeutic applications of thiopyrano[2,3-d]thiazoles, such as anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, anticancer as well as aniparasitic activities. Thus, thiopyrano[2,3-d]thiazoles may be used as powerful tools in the development of biologically active agents and drug-like molecules.",

However, recently, such a rich pharmacological profile of thiazolidinones is considered by some medicinal chemists not as an advantage, but as a drawback. For example, 5-ene-4-thiazolidinones, being the most active subgroup, is classified as PAINS (pan assay interference compounds) that are defined by their ability to show activity across a range of assays and towards a range of proteins [10, 11] . This is argued by a variety of inherent biological activity, low selectivity and the ability of 5-ylidene-4-thiazolidinones to be Michael acceptors. Despite this, rigorous selection based on SAR analysis and proved selectivity leave such compounds a \u00abright to life\u00bb in medicinal chemistry [12] [13] [14] .

Mentioned approach has been described for the first time by I.D. Komaritsa [18] , N.A. Kassab et al. [19, 20] who had successfully used 5-arylidene-4-thioxo-2-thiazolidinones (5arylideneisorhodanines) and 5-arylidene-2,4-thiazolidinedithiones (5-arylidenethiorhodanines) as heterodienes. Mentioned reagents contain in their structure \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated thiocarbonyl fragment similar to the 1-thio-1,3-butadiene which leads to their high reactivity in the [4+2]-\u0441ycloaddition reactions ( Figure 2 ). According to the molecular orbital theory, Diels-Alder reaction is based on the overlay of the diene's \"HOMO\" and dienophile's \"LUMO\". The important condition for this reaction is the presence of strong dienophile with electron acceptor properties to decrease energy difference between diene's \"HOMO\" and \"LUMO\" or \"HOMO\" of the dienophile. For these reasons reactions are highly regioselective and form products according to the molecular orbital theory. ",

It is important to note that thionation of 5-arylidene-3-phenylrhodanines with the Lawesson's reagent in the xylene medium can result in the formation of thione's dimers 3, due to the spontaneous [4+2]-cycloaddition reaction of the intermediate 5-arylidene-2,4-thiazolidinedithiones 2 (Scheme 2). The mentioned synthesis leads to the formation of thiorhodanine spiro-substituted thiopyrano [2,3-d] thiazoles 3 with high yields and the absence of by-products [24] . It is important to note that thionation of 5-arylidene-3-phenylrhodanines with the Lawesson's reagent in the xylene medium can result in the formation of thione's dimers 3, due to the spontaneous [4+2]-cycloaddition reaction of the intermediate 5-arylidene-2,4-thiazolidinedithiones 2 (Scheme 2).

In pioneering works on chemistry of thiopyrano [2,3-d] thiazoles dienophile component was represented by maleic acid and its derivatives (maleic anhydride, maleinimides) and acrylic acid and its derivatives (methyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate, acrylonitrile), therefore allowing to obtain compounds 4-7 (Scheme 3) [18] [19] [20] . \u0421urrently, the list of dienophiles for the synthesis of thiopyrano [2,3-d] thiazole derivatives has significantly expanded. Thus, the use of cynnamic acids [26] and their amides [27] , aroylacrylic [28] and arylidene pyruvic [29] acids as well as dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate [30] , propiolic acid and its ethyl ester [26] , acroleine [31] , 2-norbornene [15] and 5-norbornene-2,3-dicarboxylic acid imides [16] as dienophiles allowed to obtain new thiopyrano[2,3-d]thiazoles 8-15 as promising biologically active compounds based on the \"thiazolidinone\" matrix (Scheme 4). It should be noted that the presence of chiral centers in the structure of thiopyrano [2,3-d] thiazole cycle causes certain features of stereochemistry in the hetero-Diels-Alder reaction. The given issue became the subject of an intense study considering the current trends in organic and medicinal chemistry. It was found that the abovementioned [4+2]-cycloadditions are regio-and diastereoselective.",

It is important to note that thionation of 5-arylidene-3-phenylrhodanines with the Lawesson's reagent in the xylene medium can result in the formation of thione's dimers 3, due to the spontaneous [4+2]-cycloaddition reaction of the intermediate 5-arylidene-2,4-thiazolidinedithiones 2 (Scheme 2). The mentioned synthesis leads to the formation of thiorhodanine spiro-substituted thiopyrano [2,3d] thiazoles 3 with high yields and the absence of by-products [24] .

N.H. Metwally and colleagues [38] had chosen terephthalic aldehyde, thio-and isorhodanines as starting reagents in order to investigate the peculiarities of the hetero-Diels-Alder reaction. On the basis of these starting reagents monoarylidene thiorhodanine 31 and bicyclic arylidene isorhodanine derivatives 32 were prepared in the Knoevenagel condensation and than used as heterodienes. Phenyl maleinimide, ethyl acrylate and \u03c9-nitrostyrene were used as dienophiles that enabled syntheses of the compounds 33-35 (Scheme 11). ",

Among the tandem hetero-Diels-Alder reactions, two types of processes can be distinguished: acylation-and hemiacetal-based reactions (Scheme 21). The first approach requires the usage of 12 of 24 derivatives of \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated carboxylic acids as dienophiles, and the second-\u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated oxo compounds (aldehydes and ketones).",

Thus, when studying hetero-Diels-Alder-acylation tandem reactions of 5-(2hydroxyphenylmethylidene)isorhodanines 64 with unsaturated carboxylic acids and their derivatives more precisely, a number of stereochemical peculiarities of these processes were established (Scheme 22). For example, in the reaction of crotonic acid, its amides or anhydride a mixture of rel-5R,5aR,11bS and rel-5S,5aR,11bS diastereomers (65) were formed; the isomers' ratio depends on the nature of dienophile and the reaction temperature [26] . The reaction of heterodiene 64 with maleic and fumaric acids and their derivatives (maleic anhydride, esters) passed diastereoselectively [46, 47] . Moreover, independently of the stereoisomerism of the dienophile a racemic mixture of rel-(5R,5aR,11bS)-2,6-dioxo-3,5a,6,11b-tetrahydro-2\u041d,5H-chromeno[4\u2032,3\u2032:4,5] thiopyrano[2,3-d]thiazole-5-carboxylic acids derivatives 66 with a cis-Hydrogen in positions 5, 5\u03b1, and 11\u03b2 of heterocyclic systems was formed. Itaconic acid and its anhydride [48, 49] as well as transaconitic acid [33] reacted in a similar manner forming derivative 67.

The reaction of 67 with primary amines in acetic acid passed through the amidation stage, followed by spontaneous recycling in spiroimides 68.

            "text": "One of the most popular and promising directions of the fused 4-thiazolidinone derivatives investigation is the search for anticancer agents. However, unlike monocyclic 4-thiazolidinones, the mechanism of their antitumor activity is not well understood yet. Moreover, quite often, biophore fragments of the active 4-thiazolidinone derivatives save their pharmacological effect in the new polycyclic scaffold. The latter may be considered as an argument in favour of the given class of compounds as a source of \u00absmall drug-like molecules\u00bb, in particular anticancer agents. Thus, among fused polycyclic thiazolothiopyranes a large number of compounds characterized by the high inhibition rates and/or cytostatic activity towards cell lines of leukemia, non-small cell lung cancer, renal cancer, melanoma, ovarian cancer, breast cancer, prostate and CNS cancer were identified. A series of N-substituted chromeno[4\u2032,3\u2032:4,5]thiopyrano [2,3-d] thiazoles revealed sufficiently high level of growth inhibition of different cancer cells with the avarage logGI50 values from \u22124.49 to \u22126.22 in the in vitro studies ( Figure 6 ). The most active were compounds with the ester-106, Ntrifluoromethylphenyl-and 3,4-dichlorophenyl-acetamide fragments (107,108) in the molecules that were characterized by the cytostatic effects against a panel of cancer cell lines. On the other hand, 4methylphenylacetamide substituent in the N3 position of tetracycle increased its selective activity against leukemia cell lines, which was observed at submicromolar concentrations (logGI50 = \u22126.93 for CCRF-CEM and < \u22128.00 for HL-60(TB)), whilst its inhibition activity against other cancer cells turned out to be relatively low [55] . Interestingly that structurally related fused system of isothiochromeno [3,4-d] thiazole ( Figure 6 ) with 3-trifluoromethylphenylacetamide 109 and 3methylphenylacetamide 110 substituents in the N3 position had also showed high antitumor effects along with low acute cytotoxicity levels [54, 56] . One of the chemical modification directions of thiopyranothiazoles is the introduction of norbornane fragment in the molecules (Figure 7) . Thus, thopyranothiazole systems of type 111 with 4-benzyloxy-3-methoxyphenyl-and 5-(2,5-dichlorophenyl)-furan-2-yl substituents in the 9th position of the main core inhibited cancer cell growth at submicromolar concentrations [15] . Structurally related N-substituted 9-aryl(heteryl)-3,7-dithia-5-azatetracyclo[9.2.1.0 2,10 .0 4,8 ] tetradecen-4(8)-one-6 112 being moderately active towards a panel of cancer cell lines, showed rather good growth inhibition against leukemia cell lines [63] . Further modification of the main thiopyranothiazole scaffold allowed synthesis of the derivatives with naphthoquinone fragment 113. The latter showed high level of anticancer activity with moderate selectivity towards melanoma cells. It is worth mentioning that 11-substituted benzo [6, 7] thiochromeno[2,3-d]thiazole-2,5,10-triones had also One of the chemical modification directions of thiopyranothiazoles is the introduction of norbornane fragment in the molecules (Figure 7) . Thus, thopyranothiazole systems of type 111 with 4-benzyloxy-3-methoxyphenyl-and 5-(2,5-dichlorophenyl)-furan-2-yl substituents in the 9th position of the main core inhibited cancer cell growth at submicromolar concentrations [15] . Structurally related N-substituted 9-aryl(heteryl)-3,7-dithia-5-azatetracyclo[9.2.1.0 2,10 .0 4,8 ] tetradecen-4(8)-one-6 112 being moderately active towards a panel of cancer cell lines, showed rather good growth inhibition against leukemia cell lines [63] . Further modification of the main thiopyranothiazole scaffold allowed synthesis of the derivatives with naphthoquinone fragment 113. The latter showed high level of anticancer activity with moderate selectivity towards melanoma cells. It is worth mentioning that 11-substituted benzo [6, 7] thiochromeno[2,3-d]thiazole-2,5,10-triones had also antituberculosis activity (compound 98, Figure 5 ) and low acute toxicity [17] . High anticancer activity was identified in the row of 3,7-dithia-5,14-diazapenthacyclo[9.5.1.0 2,10 .0 4,8. 0 12, 16 ] heptadecenes. The most active were the hit-compounds 114 and 115, herewith 114 selectively inhibited growth of leukemia cell lines CCRF-CEM (Log GI 50 = \u22126.40) and SR (Log GI 50 = \u22126.06) [16] . 7-Phenyl-2-oxo-7-phenyl-3,5,6,7-tetrahydro-2H-thiopyrano[2,3-d]thiazole-6-carbaldehyde 116 showed high level of antimitotic activity against leukemia with mean GI 50 /TGI values 1.26/25.22 \u00b5M [31] .",

These results correlate with established anticancer profiles of the thiopyranothiazoles. Moreover, such fused heterocycles can be investigated as potent non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents.

            "text": "The efficient approaches to the thiopyranothiazoles scaffolds synthesis are outlined in this review. One of the most studied synthetic protocol for thiopyranothiazoles is the hetero-Diels-Alder [4+2]-cycloaddition being rather fast and efficient method that yields good outcomes and stereoselectivity of the products. The tandem processes based on hetero-Diels-Alder and Michael reactions used for the thiopirano[2,3-d]thiazoles synthesis have also been discussed. In contrast to the well discribed various synthetic routes of thiopyranothiazoles synthesis, biological activity of these derivatives have not been studied that much. Nevertheless, they are considered as 5-ene-4-thiazolidinone synthetic biomimetics that save pharmacological profile without revealing Michael acceptors properties. Among established biological activities of the thiopyrano[2,3-d]thiazole derivatives, the anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, anticancer as well as aniparasitic activities are the most prominent and need further in-depth studies. Considering all the above, the directed search for new drug-like molecules and possible chemotherapeutic agents among thiopyrano[2,3-d]thiazole derivatives is justified and promising direction in the medicinal chemistry. Moreover, the way of annealing of thiazolidine core into thiopyranothiazole analogs is used as one of the molecular optimization directions to decrease the toxicity and/or avoid the Michael acceptor properties as well.",
