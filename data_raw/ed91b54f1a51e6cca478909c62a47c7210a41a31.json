            "text": "An outbreak of gastrointestinal illness occurred among a cohort of 56 veterinary technology and 100 veterinary science students at Massey University over an eight-week period in 2013. This coincided with calving in New Zealand's seasonal dairy farming system and a time when calves with diarrhoea are commonly seen by veterinarians. Laboratory and epidemiological investigations were instigated by MidCentral Public Health Service (MCPHS) in conjunction with the Institute of Veterinary, Animal and Biomedical Sciences (IVABS) at Massey University. Eighty students responded to a questionnaire of which 19 met the case definition, a 24% attack rate. Faecal specimens from seven students contained Cryptosporidium oocysts and Cryptosporidium parvum IIa A18G3R1 was identified from one of the specimens. The inferred median incubation period was five days (range 1-12 days). All of the cases were self-limiting, characterized by diarrhoea, abdominal cramps, and in some cases vomiting, headache, and fever. Having contact with calves with diarrhoea was significantly associated with increased adjusted odds of being a case (OR 10.61, 95% CI 1.87-108.29 for one week of contact; OR 55.05, 95% CI 3.80-1931.18 for two weeks of contact). Outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis had occurred previously among veterinary students at Massey University, but the extremely high infectivity of C. parvum resulted in student illness despite enhanced hygiene precautions.",

Symptoms usually resolve in one to two weeks, with oocysts being excreted for an additional one to four weeks. Chronic infections may occur due to the oocysts' ability to excyst in the intestinal tract, and cause autoinfection [9] . Infection can lead to prolonged or life-threatening illness in immunocompromised patients [11] .

Zoonotic transmission is considered the most common route of infection of C. parvum for humans and is an important occupational risk for people working with livestock. Outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis have previously been reported among veterinary students as a result of direct or indirect contact with farm animals and through anthroponotic transmission [10, 11, [14] [15] [16] . These outbreak events highlight the need for stringent prevention and control procedures. An outbreak of cryptosporidiosis occurred at Massey University in 2006 with 25/80 (31%) respondents developing clinical signs from a cohort of 96 veterinary science students. Investigation at the time suggested that contact with apparently healthy calves during a practical class was the most likely exposure [17] . This paper describes the investigation of an outbreak of cryptosporidiosis among veterinary science and veterinary technology students at Massey University over an eight-week period during the spring-calving period in 2013.",

Anecdotally, the attitude of veterinary students at Massey University towards zoonotic infections is changing. Previously, being affected by enteritis was seen almost as a rite of passage, whereas now students are more concerned with preventing infection. A variety of strategies have been implemented to reduce human cases of cryptosporidiosis including: demonstrations in class on the correct use of personal protective equipment (PPE), provision of case studies and personal stories of students who have experienced cryptosporidiosis which emphasise how unpleasant the symptoms can be, increased signage in the large animal hospital about the risks of zoonotic disease, more hand and boot-washing stations provided in the large animal hospital, and more hand sanitisers mounted within the veterinary teaching hospital. Most recently, gates have been installed in the farm animal corridor of the large animal hospital to further limit access to the patients, and sets of boots and waterproof bib-over-trousers that stay within the large animal hospital have been provided rather than students using their own PPE and attempting to disinfect it. All of these strategies can be implemented to minimise zoonotic transmission throughout veterinary education but are particularly important in the control of cryptosporidiosis due to the low infectious dose, the resistance of oocysts in the environment, and the risk of indirect contact with infectious material. The provision of keyboard covers in student computer laboratories has also been considered as a means of limiting transmission, but these would need to be regularly wiped down, as would door handles and other surfaces, so most effort has gone into preventing the movement of infectious material from the large animal hospital. Another approach to safeguard student health would be to limit the involvement that veterinary students have with sick calves, however, this approach must be balanced with the value of clinical experience in producing practice-ready new graduates.",

The use of two separate Vet. Sci. 2017, 4, 29 9 of 11 case definitions, one for laboratory-confirmed cases, and one for clinically-confirmed cases, allowed the inclusion of students who may have had symptoms caused by other pathogens or non-infectious causes, such as the student who tested positive for Campylobacter. This overestimates the contribution of C. parvum to the burden of student disease but was worthwhile to capture possible cases, given that many of the students did not seek medical attention for their condition.",

            "text": "The identified relationship between class and the incidence of cryptosporidiosis showed a significant increased incidence of disease among the second year Bachelor of Veterinary Technology students (Table 5) . A plausible explanation for this is that these students would not previously have had contact with sick animals from within the veterinary programme and therefore these students may be less experienced with barrier nursing skills and handling of patients with zoonotic disease. This finding suggests that instruction to this group of students could be more intensive and practical which would allow them the opportunity to acquire more skills by the time they have contact with possibly infected animals. Another factor which could have led to the increased incidence within this group would be that the population is likely to be na\u00efve to Cryptosporidium infection due to the lack of prior exposure.",
