Four isolates from Houston, Texas, and one isolate from Java, Indonesia, were identified as variants of the species Alphamesonivirus-1 which also includes Nam Dinh virus (NDiV) from Vietnam and Cavally virus (CavV) from C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. The eight other isolates were identified as variants of three new mesoniviruses, based on genome organization and pairwise evolutionary distances: Karang Sari virus (KSaV) from Java, Bontag Baru virus (BBaV) from Java and Kalimantan, and Kamphaeng Phet virus (KPhV) from Thailand. In comparison with NDiV, the three new mesoniviruses each contained a long insertion (180 -588 nt) of unknown function in the 5' region of ORF1a, which accounted for much of the difference in genome size. The insertions contained various short imperfect repeats and may have arisen by recombination or sequence duplication.",

To date, the six described mesoniviruses, Cavally (CavV), DakNong (DKNG), Hana (HanaV), Meno (MenoV), Nam Dinh (NDiV) and Nse (NseV) have all been isolated from naturally infected mosquitoes collected in just two countries: C\u00f4te d'Ivoire (West Africa) and Vietnam (Southeast Asia) [2] [3] [4] [5] . Although these mosquito-associated viruses do not appear to infect vertebrates or to cause illness in humans or livestock, they are nonetheless of interest because of the structural and genetic similarities to other members of the order Nidovirales, namely viruses in the families Coronaviridae, Arteriviridae, and Roniviridae. Furthermore, the basal phylogenetic position of the mesoniviruses in relation to the Coronaviridae has led some authors to suggest that the coronaviruses, and possibly other viruses in the order Nidovirales, may have evolved in arthropods [3] [4] [5] . Indeed, members of the Roniviridae naturally infect marine shrimp and can cause severe pathology in these economically important arthropods [6] .",

These 13 viruses appear to represent four distinct species in the family Mesoniviridae, three of which are novel. Based on their wide geographic distribution, the limited sampling that has been done to date for these mosquito-specific viruses, and their broad species host range in mosquitoes, it seems likely that mesoniviruses are common in mosquito populations worldwide. The potential biological significance and effect of mesoniviruses on mosquito vector competence is also discussed.",

Mature virions 50 nm in diameter were located at the surface of infected C6/36 cells, either as individual particles or in groups ( Figure 1B,D) , similar to what has been reported recently [7] . They displayed a dense nucleocapsid core~40 nm in diameter and surrounding envelope ( Figure 1A ,B). Mature virions of the same size could also be found inside intracytoplasmic vacuoles ( Figure 1A ,B,D,E,F,H). Some infected cells had paracrystalline arrays consisting of empty and full virus particles but with less electron-density than mature virions ( Figure 1C ). At the periphery of these arrays, mature virions could be observed either free in the cytosol or inside vacuoles ( Figure 1C ). Moreover a recent report [8] , suggests that the mesonivirus virion diameter of~40-50 nm observed by us and others [7] may be significantly lower than its actual size, a discrepancy attributed to the method of preparation for alternative imaging technologies. Employing cryoelectron tomography, Warrilow et al. [8] demonstrated on the surface of some virions the presence of spikelike projections displaying a globular head attached to the virion surface through a low density stalk, similar to what has been observed in other members of the order Nidovirales [9] .",

The organization of each genome was similar to that described previously for the mesoniviruses (NDiV, CavV, HanaV, NseV and MenoV), featuring a long 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) of 359 to 370 nt, six major long open reading frames (ORFs), and a long terminal region of 1780 to 1804 nt preceding the poly[A] tail ( Figure 2 ). An alignment that also included the five previously described mesoniviruses revealed block insertions in three groups of isolates: i) KP84-0156, KP84-0192 and KP84-0344 had a 180 nt insertion, ii) JKT-9853, JKT-9876, JKT-9891 and JKT-7774 had a 573 nt insertion, and iii) JKT-10701 had a 588 nt insertion. These insertions accounted for most of the observed difference in genome size in the mesoniviruses ( Figure 2 ). Excluding this region, which commenced~1300 nt from the 5'terminus, the mesoniviruses shared global nucleotide sequence identity of~43.7%.

By this method, each of the other previously described mesoniviruses -HanaV MenoV, and NseVwould also be considered unique species, as the PED between these viruses and all other mesoniviruses were considerably greater than 0.032. These viruses could be assigned to the species Alphamesonivirus-2, Alphamesonivirus-3 and Alphamesonivirus-4, respectively.

A MUSCLE alignment of all available mesonivirus ORF2a polyprotein sequences (Additional file 3: Figure S3 ) indicated that the signalase cleavage site is relatively variable conforming only to the sequence motif [C/S]|[L/A/S] TRIDL and that the S1-S2 cleavage site (R|WDSSYV) is highly conserved. The S protein, a class I transmembrane glycoprotein with a C-terminal transmembrane domain, features a set of 12 conserved cysteine residues which are likely to form 6 disulphide bridges, and 7 to 11 potential N-glycosylation sites, only 4 of which are conserved across all mesoniviruses. Surprisingly, an Nterminal signal peptide is strongly predicted for the MenoV S protein (between amino acids A 20 and S 21 ) but not for those of any of the other mesoniviruses (http:// www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP). There is a relatively high level of amino acid sequence conservation in the S1 and S2 proteins (47.2% and 51.7% global identify, respectively).

However, a previous analysis of the NDiV sequence failed to identify a predicted pseudoknot structure, suggesting that a stem-loop structure (predicted using pknotsRG; http://bibiserv.techfak.uni-bielefeld.de/pknotsrg/) in the same region of the genome may facilitate the frame-shift [3] .

Indeed, an alignment of the corresponding region of the genome of all mesoniviruses (Additional file 5: Figure S5 ) indicated that there was poor conservation of this sequence and few compensatory mutations that would preserve the stem-loop structure ( Figure 5a ). As functional pseudoknot structures are usually conserved, an alignment of all mesonivirus sequences extending 150 nt from the start of the 'slippery sequence' was analyzed using the IPknot server (http:// rna.naist.jp/ipknot) which predicts the consensus secondary structure from a multiple sequence alignment (by using integer programming to select the maximum expected accuracy (MEA) structure) [10] .

Our NDiV isolate from Java, Indonesia (Ngewontan strain) was also obtained from a pool of Cx. vishnui mosquitoes in 1981. The four NDiV isolates from Houston, Texas (Houston strain) were made from Cx. quinquefasciatus and Aedes albopictus collected outdoors within the Houston metropolitan area during West Nile virus (WNV) surveillance in 2004 and 2010, respectively. Interestingly, all of these isolates were from mosquitoes captured in or near human dwellings and from species that feed on humans. The close similarity of isolates from Houston and Vietnam may suggest a recent translocation, possibly during the Vietnam conflict when Houston hosted a major air base for embarkation/disembarkation.

Firstly, the presence of block insertions of up to 588 nt in the 5' terminal quadrant of ORF1a of several mesoniviruses has not been reported previously. The function of this region is presently unknown in mesoniviruses and other nidoviruses and so the structural and functional consequences of these insertions, which contain various imperfect repeats is unclear. Although sharing similar genome architecture, nidoviruses vary greatly in genome size. A previous analysis of the evolution of nidovirus genomes concluded that genome expansion has occurred in a wave-like fashion in which the three major coding regions (ORF1b, ORF1a and the 3'ORFs) expanded consecutively in a hierarchy that reflects the roles of their encoded proteins in the virus replication cycle [15] . This implies that nidoviruses have an inherent capacity for genome expansion, most likely associated with the transitional retention of sequences that serve as a resource for the evolution of new functions. The block insertions detected in ORF1a appear to be functionally redundant and their potential role in such evolutionary processes is presently unclear.",

However, the predicted structure featured only four relatively short regions of complementarity and no estimations of minimum free energy for the represented structures are available through this algorithm. A possible 'slippery' sequence (CACUUUU) was also detected in the ORF3a/ ORF3b overlap region but no conserved stem-loop or pseudoknot structure was predicted by IPknot in the downstream sequence. It is, therefore, unclear whether ORF3b is expressed by internal initiation or as a read-through extension of ORF3a, which would generate a double-membrane spanning protein.

Paired end 50 base sequencing by synthesis was performed using TruSeq SBS kit v3 (Illumina) on an Illumina HiSeq 1000 using protocols defined by the manufacturer. Cluster density per lane was 645-980 k/mm 2 and post filter reads ranged from 148-178 million per lane. Base call conversion to sequence reads wasperformed using CASAVA-1.8.2. Virus sequences were edited and assembled using the SeqMan and NextGen modules of the DNAStar Lasergene 7 program (Bioinformatics Pioneer DNAStar, Inc., Madison, WI). In certain cases, prefiltering of reads to remove host sequence enhanced the assembly process. Assembly was carried out using a fasta file of Aedes albopictus sequences to remove host DNA from the assembly thus reducing the number of contigs present.",

            "text": "A region corresponding to the full-length product encoded by ORF2a (unprocessed S proteins) was used to determine the relationships within the family Mesoniviridae along with a concatenated region of the highly conserved domains within ORF1ab (3CL pro , RdRp and ZnHel1). ORF2ab alignments were determined using the MUSCLE algorithm [19] as amino acids before being toggled back to the nucleotides while maintaining the alignment. Concatenated ORF1ab alignments were performed at the protein level. A maximum likelihood (ML) tree for ORF2a was constructed in MEGA 5.2 using the Jones-Taylor-Thornton substitution model of nucleotide substitution, uniform substitution rates among sites and the Nearest Neighbor-Interchange heuristic method and a very strong branch swap filter. An optimal ML tree was then estimated using the appropriate model and a heuristic search with tree-bisection-reconstruction branch swapping and 10 replicates, estimating variable parameters from the data, where necessary. A maximum likelihood phylogeny of the conserved domains of ORF1ab was constructed using PhyML 3.0 [20] , the WAG + Gamma model of amino acid substitution, and the NNI + SPR method of branch swapping. One thousand bootstrap replicates were calculated for each dataset under the same models and expressed as a percentage. Calculation of the PED between the highly conserved protein domains of ORF1ab (3CL pro , RdRp and ZnHel1) of the thirteen new isolates described in this study and those of five previously described mesoniviruses (CavV, HanaV, NDiV, NseV and MenoV) was performed using the ML method in the program TreePuzzle [21] and the WAG model of amino acid substitution. Sliding window analysis was used to calculate the mean amino acid divergences within and between the seven mesonivirus species described in this study. Percent divergences were calculated for each of the three largest ORFs in the genome (ORF 1ab, ORF2a, ORF2b) using the program SSE [22] .",
