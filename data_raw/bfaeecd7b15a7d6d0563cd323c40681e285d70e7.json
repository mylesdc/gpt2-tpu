Unlike the mammalian basal mRNA decay enzymes, which largely target mRNA from the 5 and 3 end, viruses instead use endonucleases that cleave their targets internally. This is hypothesized to more rapidly inactivate mRNA while maintaining selective power, potentially though the use of a targeting motif(s). Yet, how mRNA endonuclease specificity is achieved in mammalian cells remains largely unresolved. Here, we reveal key features underlying the biochemical mechanism of target recognition and cleavage by the SOX endonuclease encoded by Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV). Using purified KSHV SOX protein, we reconstituted the cleavage reaction in vitro and reveal that SOX displays robust, sequence-specific RNA binding to residues proximal to the cleavage site, which must be presented in a particular structural context. The strength of SOX binding dictates cleavage efficiency, providing an explanation for the breadth of mRNA susceptibility observed in cells. Importantly, we establish that cleavage site specificity does not require additional cellular cofactors, as had been previously proposed. Thus, viral endonucleases may use a combination of RNA sequence and structure to capture a broad set of mRNA targets while still preserving selectivity.",

By changing overall messenger RNA (mRNA) abundance or translation, viruses can redirect host machinery towards viral gene expression while si-multaneously dampening immune stimulatory signals (1) (2) (3) . Suppression of host gene expression, termed host shutoff, can occur via a variety of mechanisms, but one common strategy is to accelerate degradation of mRNA (1) (2) (3) . This occurs during infection with DNA viruses such as alphaherpesviruses, gammaherpesvirues, and vaccinia virus, as well as with RNA viruses such as influenza A virus and SARS and MERS coronaviruses (1, 4, 5) .

In this context, it is unclear how sequence features surrounding the RNA cleavage site might impact SOX targeting, for example by changing its affinity for a given RNA or the efficiency with which cleavage occurs. To address these questions, we sought to reconstitute the SOX cleavage reaction in vitro using purified components. Using an RNA substrate that is efficiently cleaved by SOX in cells, we revealed that specific RNA sequences within and outside of the cleavage site significantly contribute to SOX binding efficiency and target processing. In particular, we found that the polyadenosine stretch adjacent to the cleavage site is critical for SOX binding, and we experimentally verified the importance of an open loop structure surrounding the cleavage site. Finally, we demonstrated that this in vitro system faithfully recapitulates the initial endonucleolytic cleavage event that is an essential component of mRNA target specificity in vivo. Collectively, our data reveal that specific sequence features potently impact SOX binding, and thus provide key insight into the breadth of SOX targeting efficiency observed across the transcriptome. More broadly, this information provides a framework for better understanding the target specificity of endonucleases, which play central roles in mammalian quality control processes and viral infection outcomes.",

            "text": "Our prior analysis of SOX targets in cells identified the human LIMD1 mRNA, which codes for a protein essential for P body formation and integrity, as being highly susceptible to cleavage by SOX (20) . The minimum sequence required to directly cut the putative cleavage site in LIMD1 in cells was mapped to a 54-nucleotide segment (LIMD1-54), and we therefore chose this as our model substrate to study SOX targeting in vitro (20) . We first expressed and purified KSHV SOX to greater then 95% purity from Sf9 insect cells (Supplementary Figure S1A ). Using the LIMD1-54 substrate, we plotted the observed rate constant (k obs ) as a function of SOX concentration, yielding a Hill coefficient of n = 1.11 ( Figure 1A ). Thus, in agreement with previous observations (9,10), SOX appears to function predominantly as a monomer. Under conditions of half maximal activity (2 M; Figure 1A ), SOX displayed a strong preference for the 'hard' divalent metal Mg 2+ and a weaker preference for the 'softer' and larger metals Mn 2+ , Co 2+ and Zn 2+ ( Figure 1B ). This is again consistent with other characterized members of the P/DExK family of enzymes (9, 26) . Notably, SOX activity in the presence of Mg 2+ was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner upon competitive addition of Ca 2+ ( Figure 1C and Supplementary Figure S1D ). This is likely the result of increased coordination partners engaged by Ca 2+ , which decreases the ability of catalytic residues to promote proper base hydrolysis (27) (28) (29) . Finally, increasing the NaCl concentration above 100 mM led to substantially decreased SOX activity ( Figure 1D ), in accordance with the observation that high salt concentrations frequently inhibit nuclease activity by disrupting protein-protein or proteinsubstrate interactions (29) . Given that recombinant SOX displays robust 5 -3 exonuclease activity (9,10), we sought to confirm that LIMD1-54 was subject to endonucleolytic SOX cleavage, as this is the predominant event that directs mRNA turnover in SOX expressing cells (3, 16) . Both the 5 and 3 ends LIMD1-54 were blocked by capping the 5 end with a Cy5 fluorophore and the 3 end with an Iowa Black quencher (LIMD1-54 Flo). We confirmed this RNA was resistant to degradation by the 5 -phosphate dependent exonuclease terminator ( Figure 1E, lane 3) . However, in the presence of SOX, a cleavage product was observed that correlated with an endonucleolytic cut ( Figure 1E, lane 2) .",

The cleavage sites for LIMD1-54 and GFP-51 are predicted to occur in an open loop region (Figure 2A, red arrow) . Upon direct comparison of these two RNAs, we observed a \u223c6-fold increase in the catalytic efficiency of SOX for the LIMD1-54 substrate compared to GFP-51 ( Figure 2B ). This difference was not exclusively due to the fact that the GFP substrate was slightly shorter than LIMD1-54, as SOX also displayed a 5fold reduction of catalytic efficiency on a longer, 100 nt GFP substrate (GFP-100; Figure 2B ). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) further revealed a 10-fold increase in SOX binding to LIMD1-54 compared to GFP-51 ( Figure  2C ). Given that both substrates contain the requisite unpaired bulge at the predicted cleavage site (see Figure 2A and Supplementary Figure S2 ), these observations suggest that additional sequence or structural features impact SOX targeting efficiency on individual RNAs.",

Structural data indicate that residue F179 forms a stacking interaction with an adenine base in the RNA, likely stabilizing the protein-RNA interaction, while P176 is hypothesized to contribute to structural rearrangements required for F179 engagement (21) . We purified both mutants to evaluate their relative RNA processing and RNA binding activity against the optimal LIMD1-54 substrate. Both mutants displayed purity and elution profiles similar to wild type (WT) SOX (see Supplementary Figure S1A-C) . However, the catalytic efficiency of each mutant was >10-fold less than WT SOX ( Figure  2D ). Furthermore, RNA binding was severely perturbed; the binding kinetics of WT SOX for LIMD1-54 are in the single digit nanomolar range (K d = 7 nM), while P176S and F179A display >2 log defects (K d = 702 nM and 831 nM, respectively) ( Figure 2E and Supplementary Figure S4A C). Thus, the large defect in RNA binding likely explains the decreased efficiency of RNA processing. Notably, while there was a dramatic decrease in the relative affinities of the two mutants for LIMD1-54, there was not a complete loss of binding or RNA processing. This could be a result of secondary nonspecific interactions and/or nonspecific exonucleolytic degradation by SOX from the 5 monophosphorylated end of the probe.",

In this structure, the only observed contacts between SOX and K2-31 occurred between the four active site residues of SOX (Y373, R248, C247, F179) and the UGAAG motif surrounding the cleavage site of the RNA (21) . It was therefore hypothesized that no other residues beyond this unpaired UGAAG motif were involved in transcript recognition (21) . However, the binding affinity we observed for LIMD1-54 was 200-fold stronger that what was previously reported for K2-31 (21) , suggesting that a more extended interaction surface might distinguish optimal from sub-optimal RNA substrates. We therefore used RNA footprinting to map the SOX binding sites on LIMD1-54. Indeed, SOX protected a region of LIMD1-54 that included the three adenosine stretch (positions 20-24) from RNase T1 digestion in a dose dependent manner ( Figure 4) . Notably, this mapped binding region is the same region predicted from in vivo PARE-seq data to be important for SOX targeting, although the reason for its importance remained unknown (20) . We also observed a modest protection of base 27 (G) located directly adjacent to the predicted cleavage site of SOX, which represents the region detected in the crystal structure of K2-31 bound to SOX. Collectively, these findings suggest that while SOX may interact with residues directly adjacent to the cut site, a more extensive interaction interface exists for its preferred in vivo targets.",

Third, we mutated the residue located at the predicted SOX cut site that was also protected in the footprinting assay (LIMD1-54 A-G). This mutant has been previously identified to block SOX cleavage in vivo (20) . tary Figure S6 ). Real-time binding kinetics for SOX with WT LIMD1-54 and each of the three mutant substrates were then measured using bio-layer interferometry (BLI). All RNA probes were 3 biotinylated and immobilized to a streptavidin-coated BLI probe, whereupon the binding and dissociation of SOX was measured. To prevent degradation of the probe, excess calcium ion was used in place of magnesium (Supplementary Figure S1E) . SOX retained similar binding affinity to the cut site mutant Table S2 ). To rule out the possibility that the effect on binding affinity to the LIMD1-54 zipper mutant was a result of altered residues within the binding site, we also engineered an additional zipper mutant (LIMD1-54 zipper 2) that did not disrupt the polyadenosine sequence. In agreement with the loop structure playing a critical role in target recognition, this LIMD1-54 zipper 2 mutant also displayed a substantial defect in binding (K d = 2.09 M; Supplementary Figure S7A , B, Supplementary  Table S2 ). Finally, we measured SOX binding to the KSHV pre-miRNA sequence used to obtain the SOX-RNA cocrystal structure (K2-31) (21) . Notably, the affinity of SOX for K2-31 was within the range of the LIMD1-54 structural mutants (K d = 1.08 M), suggesting that despite having an UGAAG motif upstream of a predicted bulge, this is unlikely to be a SOX target ( Figure 5B , Supplementary Figure  S5E and Supplementary Table S2) . We next quantitatively measured the catalytic efficiency of SOX towards each of the above RNA substrates. Despite SOX having WT binding affinity for the predicted cleavage site mutant LIMD1-54 A-G, there was a 7-fold defect in",

By combining Ca 2+ and Mg 2+ in our reaction buffer, we were able to sufficiently slow SOX processing to visualize cleavage products derived from 5 32 P labeled substrates. Indeed, we observed a predominant 27 nt band, which is the size of the product released upon LIMD1-54 cleavage at the predicted cut site ( Figure 6A , lane 3). Additional bands also appeared, likely representing subsequent processing events. Importantly, when we incubate SOX with the cut site mutant LIMD1-54 A-G, there is a complete loss of this 27 nt product, as well as the additionally processed intermediates ( Figure 6A, lane 4) . Production of these cleavage intermediates required SOX, as no decay was observed in the RNA-only controls ( Figure 6A , lanes 1-2). Finally, we sought to verify that the predominant 27 nt cleavage product we observed was a result of an endonucleolytic cleavage and not 5 end processing. To this end, we generated a LIMD1-54 substrate containing a 3 32 P pCp label and a free 5 OH to block 5 end processing. Again, in the presence of SOX, WT LIMD1-54 but not the A-G mutant produced a cleavage product whose size corresponded to cleavage at the predicted site ( Figure 6B ). Taken together, these data confirm that our in vitro assay faithfully recapitulates SOX cleavage site specificity on a true substrate.",

Here, through the development of the first biochemical system to faithfully recapitulate the internal cleavage specificity observed for SOX in cells, we revealed how both RNA sequence and structure contribute to targeting. These findings resolve a central feature of the current model of SOX activity ( Figure  7 ). Previous observations established that sequences flanking the cut site were required to direct cleavage by SOX (16, 20) . However, it was unresolved whether they played a strictly structural role in presenting an exposed loop for cleavage, served as a platform for SOX binding, or created a binding site for one or more cellular factors that then indirectly recruited SOX to its targets. Through a combination of mutational analyses, RNA structure probing, and RNA footprinting assays, we showed that efficient SOX targeting requires both an exposed loop structure and upstream sequences that serve as a SOX binding platform. This combination of sequence and structural features within the targeting motif helps explain why some mRNAs are efficiently cleaved by SOX, whereas others are weaker substrates.",

            "text": "A key open question related to SOX function is how it can target the majority of mRNAs in cells, yet with significant site specificity. Our observations suggest that there must be specific mRNA features that influence targeting. Indeed, PARE-seq analyses of cleavage intermediates in SOX expressing cells revealed that cleavage sites were associated with a degenerate sequence motif (20) . Sequences proximal to the cleavage site were predicted to be un-base paired and frequently contained a polyadenosine stretch followed by a purine (20) . The requirement for these sequence features for SOX targeting was validated for the LIMD1 transcript in cells (20) . Because LIMD1 has been established as a particularly robust SOX target in cells (20) , we reasoned that it must contain features optimal for SOX processing and therefore would be an ideal substrate to dissect biochemically why these features are important. Indeed, SOX binding to LIMD1-54 was 10-fold better than to the commonly used reporter substrate GFP, and \u223c100-fold better than to the K2-31 pre-miRNA, which has not been demonstrated to be processed by SOX in cells. Importantly, these binding differences correlated with the efficiency of SOX cleavage in vitro, arguing that the ability to bind the targeting motif is a key step in target recognition. Through RNA footprinting assays, we were able to show that SOX binds to a bulge structure proximal to the cleavage site containing the polyadenosine stretch previously predicted to be important for mRNA cleavage by SOX in cells (20) . Mutating either just the bulge structure (LIMD1-54 zipper 2) or maintaining the bulge but mutating the polyadenosine stretch (LIMD1-54 3xA-G) resulted in a \u223c100-fold reduction in binding affinity, correlating with a dramatic decrease in cleavage efficiency. Collectively, these data demonstrate that variability in the efficiency of SOX targeting observed in cells is likely due to differences in RNA sequences that mediate SOX binding.",

However, the structure did not reveal additional interactions between SOX and the RNA beyond the three residues surrounding the cut site. Our data suggest that this is likely because the K2-31 RNA lacks the additional residues necessary for SOX binding site found in both LIMD1 and GFP. While the K2-31 RNA does contain adenosines upstream of the cleavage site, structural predictions indicate these residues are within a stem region (21) , rather than in an exposed loop as is the case for LIMD1 and GFP. Together, these observations indicate that while upstream adenosines are important for binding, they must be present in an unpaired state to promote SOX binding. It is notable that prior studies reported much weaker interactions between SOX and RNA (K d = 75 M) compared to its DNA substrates (K d = 1 m) (9, 10, 21) . However, in these cases binding assays were conducted with scrambled RNA sequences. We found that SOX binding affinities to RNA substrates vary over several orders of magnitude, in a manner that correlates with cleavage efficiency. Interestingly, the crystal structure of SOX bound to DNA showed more dynamic interactions along the length of the protein (\u223c480\u00c5 2 interaction surface), when compared to the K2-31 RNA bound structure (\u223c240\u00c5 2 interaction surface). It is therefore possible that more interaction along the length of SOX protein might occur with optimal substrates such as LIMD1 that are more tightly bound.",

SOX is able to distinguish mRNA from other types of RNA in cells by an as yet unknown mechanism. Subsequently, it endonucleolytically cleaves its targets at specific sites, whereupon the fragments are degraded by host exonucleases such as XRN1 and DIS3L2. Here, we revealed that in addition to the requirement for an unpaired loop at the cleavage site, additional upstream RNA sequences increase the affinity of SOX for individual targets, thereby controlling cleavage efficiency.",

We hypothesize that cellular co-factors, perhaps though interactions with SOX, enable this distinction. More broadly, endonucleases are instrumental in RNA processing and degradation. Nuclease processing defects lead to several human pathologies ranging from cancer to neurodegeneration (30) (31) (32) (33) (34) , and our study provides a framework for better understanding the mechanistic features governing endonuclease targeting.",

(A) An in-line reaction (Rxn) was performed at room temperature for 24 h (lane 2) or 48 h (lane 3) at pH 8.3 to identify structured regions of the LIMD1-54 RNA. Ladders were generated by subjecting the RNA to cleavage by RNase T1 (lane 8) or alkaline hydrolysis (-OH, lane 4-7). Products were separated by 8% urea PAGE, whereupon structured regions protected from cleavage were identified (green bars). No reaction (NR, lane1) refers to the input RNA.
