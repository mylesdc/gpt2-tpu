Torovirus infections are generally asymptomatic, however, their presence may worsen disease consequences in concurrent infections with other enteric pathogens. Methods: A total of 872 diarrheic fecal samples from pigs of different ages were collected from 12 districts of Sichuan Province in the southwest of China. RT-PCR was done with PToV S gene specific primers to detect the presence of PToV positive samples. M gene specific primers were used with the PToV positive samples and the genes were sequenced. A phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the M gene nucleotide sequences from the 19 selected novel Sichuan strains and 21 PToV and BToV M gene sequences from GenBank. Results: A total of 331 (37.96%, 331/872) samples were found to be positive for PToV and the highest prevalence was observed in piglets aged from 1 to 3 weeks old. Through phylogenetic inference the 40 PToV M gene containing sequences were placed into two genotypes (I & II). The 19 novel Sichuan strains of genotype I showed strong correlations to two Korean gene sequences . Amino-acid sequence analysis of the 40 PToV M gene strains revealed that the M gene protein was highly conserved.",

This RT-PCR methodology had been previously proved to be sensitive and specific for PToV [25] . RT-PCR displayed that PToV infections were widespread in large-scale breeding bases and on rural farms in Sichuan. The overall positive rate was 37.96%, and six districts, Suining, Deyang, Yibin, Chengdu, Mianyang and Meishan, had higher infection rates than this. These results may be due to the increased urban agglomeration and greater levels of prosperity within these districts leading to greater movement of, and poorer storage and feeding of livestock with in these areas. According to the PToV infection rates at different growth stages, piglets of 1 to 3 weeks of age were more vulnerable to PToV than the others. Nonetheless, the result is likely to be an incomplete reflection the total number of infections in Sichuan province. The reason for this is that the highest prevalence and greatest anti-PToV Ig G titers were observed in adults [17] . In contrast, the lowest prevalence and lowest anti-PToV Ig G levels were found among 3-week-old piglets [17] . Both ELISA reactivity values and rates of seroprevalence rose markedly in piglets from 3 to 11 weeks [17] . These results suggested that RT-PCR cannot reflect the infections completely due to swine developing their own immune response to the virus resulting in an effective cure in some infected adults.",
