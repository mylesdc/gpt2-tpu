Viral nucleic acid was extracted by three automated extraction systems: QIAcube (Qiagen, Germany), EZ1 Advanced XL (Qiagen), and MICROLAB Nimbus IVD (Hamilton, USA). Fourteen RNA viruses and two DNA viruses were detected using the Anyplex II RV16 Detection kit (Seegene, Republic of Korea). The EZ1 Advanced XL system demonstrated the best analytical sensitivity for all the three viral strains. The nucleic acids extracted by EZ1 Advanced XL showed higher positive rates for virus detection than the others. Meanwhile, the MICROLAB Nimbus IVD system was comprised of fully automated steps from nucleic extraction to PCR setup function that could reduce human errors. For the nucleic acids recovered from nasopharyngeal swab specimens, the QIAcube system showed the fewest false negative results and the best concordance rate, and it may be more suitable for detecting various viruses including RNA and DNA virus strains. Each system showed different sensitivity and specificity for detection of certain viral pathogens and demonstrated different characteristics such as turnaround time and sample capacity. Therefore, these factors should be considered when new nucleic acid extraction systems are introduced to the laboratory.",

They frequently cause pneumonia in children, especially those younger than 2 years (up to approximately 80%) [1, 2] . For adult patients in the ICU, these pathogens account for 28% of pneumonia cases, with mortality rates comparable to those of bacterial pneumonia [3] . The mean annual incidence of respiratory tract infections in the United States was reported to be 4.2 and 1.2 for the first and the second years of a child's life, respectively. Furthermore, 27% of respiratory tract infections resulted from coinfection with two or more viruses, including rhinovirus, human coronavirus, and adenovirus [4] . Since the year 2000, many new respiratory viruses have been identified including H5N1 avian influenza, SARS-coronavirus, human coronavirus NL63, human coronavirus HKU1, human metapneumovirus, human bocavirus, and human rhinovirus type C [5, 6] . Therefore, simultaneous identification of multiple viruses is needed for timely patient management.",

However, these automated nucleic acid extraction systems were evaluated using multiplex PCR or multiples real-time PCR assays which are capable of detecting only up to 5 viruses simultaneously in a single patient sample. Only recently, multiple real-time PCR assay which is capable detecting more than 14 viruses simultaneously was developed and widely used [19, 20] . But a comprehensive comparison of the automated extraction systems for these multiplex RT-PCR using nasopharyngeal aspirate samples has never been carried out. The EZ1 Advanced XL and the QIAcube systems have been popularly used in medical laboratories for DNA/RNA extraction, whereas the MICROLAB Nimbus IVD system is newly introduced.

The EZ1 Advanced XL system showed relatively high number of the discrepant results ( = 12) and false positives ( = 7), especially for ADV (3 false positives). However, it showed the best analytical sensitivity for ADV-3, FluA, and RSV-A (Table 4 ) and as well as the highest sensitivity for ADV in clinical specimens (Table 3) . As the analytical sensitivity of BioMed Research International 5 When all three automated nucleic acid extraction systems yielded the same results, they were considered \"true positive\" or \"true negative. \" If only 1 system yielded negative result, it was considered \"false negative. \" When the pathogen was detected from only 1 system, multiplex PCR and sequencing analysis were performed to confirm the result. b < 0.0001 for all values. c includes lysis step but not the hands-on time. the confirming test including the Seeplex RV15 ACE Detection kit (Seegene) and sequencing analysis could be lower than Anyplex II RV16 Detection kit (Seegene) [22] , some of these false positive results could include true positive results. Therefore, we discerned that the EZ1 Advanced XL system is more suitable for ADV virus detection. The MICROLAB Nimbus IVD system showed the highest specificity (94.6%, only two false positives), but it demonstrated the lowest sensitivity (87.2%) with 6 false negatives ( Table 3) .

The relative concentration ratios of sample volume to elution volume were 2.5 for the QIAcube system, 6.7 for the EZ1 Advanced XL system, and 6.0 for the MICROLAB Nimbus IVD system, respectively. We used QIAcube system with sample volume 150 L and elution volume 60 L routinely in our laboratory. Therefore, we adjusted the sample volume and elution volume in the MICROLAB Nimbus IVD system and the EZ1 Advanced XL system similarly, but we could not do this in QIAcube system.

In their study, these three different methods were evaluated with different sample volumes and elution volumes. The relative concentration ratios of the sample volume to elution volume were 4.5 for the NucliSens easyMAG, 2.5 for the BioRot 9604, and 1.0-2.3 for the manual QIAamp, respectively. However, the nucleic acids obtained by all three methods gave comparable sensitivities in PCR tests, and the three methods gave comparable viral loads [16] Therefore, we thought that the relative concentrative effect of the eluted nucleic acid may have little effect on the results of RT-PCR based methods. In a previous study, the MagNA Pure Compact machine with the MagNAPure Compact Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit I (Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA) demonstrated more than 4-fold higher DNA recovery from the S. pyogenes than the other automated extraction systems including KingFisher-ML (ThermoFisher Scientific Inc., Worcester, MA, USA), Biorobot EZ1 (Qiagen), easyMAG (bioMerieux), and Biorobot MDX (Qiagen); however, it was less efficient in RNA purification from RSV and influenza A virus viruses. This may be due to RNA degradation or inefficient RNA binding to the magnetic beads [17] . Actually, the MagNAPure Compact Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit I was preferred for DNA extraction, although it did not include carried RNA. Inclusion of carried RNA could enhance the yield of a very few target molecules and reduce the chances of viral RNA degradation. In our study, all three extraction kits included carried RNA, and all three systems showed comparable efficiencies of RNA and DNA extraction (Table 4) .",

Therefore, the systems using the magnetic particle may be more preferred for more rapid identification of the viral pathogens. The longer hands-on time of the MICROLAB Nimbus IVD systems was drawback, but it has the capability to run 3-4 fold more samples than other comparison systems at the same time and this system integrates fully automated steps from nucleic extraction to PCR setup function, allowing human errors to be minimized and providing more reliable results.
