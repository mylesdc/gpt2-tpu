Their expression stability was calculated using four algorithms: geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper and the deltaCt method. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) were the most stable genes, while \u03b2-tubulin and 7s-globulin were the less stable. Expression analysis of three target genes, chosen for RGs validation, encoding the reactive oxygen species scavenging enzymes ascorbate peroxidase (APX), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) indicated that a combination of stable RGs, such as GAPDH and PP2A, can lead to an accurate quantification of the expression levels of such target genes. The APX level varied during the experiment time course and according to the inoculum doses, whereas both SOD and CAT resulted down-regulated during the first four days, and up-regulated afterwards, irrespective of inoculum dose. These results can be useful for better elucidating the molecular interaction in the A. deliciosa/P. s. pv. actinidiae pathosystem and for RGs selection in bacteria-plant pathosystems.",

            "text": "Gene expression analysis is an important tool that is employed to elucidate the complex regulatory networks of the genetic, signalling and metabolic pathway mechanisms that underlie plant-pathogen interactions 1 . Although gene expression microarrays are an ideal tool to provide a snapshot of the global gene transcriptional activity, reverse transcription quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assays are normally used to verify results on a smaller scale due to its high sensitivity, high specificity and good reproducibility 2 . RT-qPCR is used to determine the fold change of the expression of genes of interest (GOIs) or as a technique to confirm the results of differential protein studies obtained by proteomic analyses 3 . However, to improve RT-qPCR accuracy and reliability, a strategy aimed at normalizing gene expression data is required. Normalization can correct the variation associated with variability occurring in the experimental procedures (i.e., sample quantification errors, variation between samples) 4,5 . Generally, the use of reference genes (RGs) as internal controls is the most common method Consiglio per la ricerca in agricoltura e l'analisi dell'economia agraria (for normalizing data in gene expression experiments, so each RGs should be validated for particular tissue, cell and experimental conditions. RGs are internal controls that are exposed to assay conditions similar to the gene of interest. Ideally, the expression profile of the RGs should not be influenced by the conditions of the experiment. Usually, the main candidate RGs are involved in general cell metabolism pathways and are widely used in plant, animal and fungal systems 6-10 . In some plant pathosystems, transcriptomic technologies, such as microarray, qPCR and RT-qPCR, have identified the molecular mechanisms that are activated upon infection and maintained during pathogenesis that are responsible for disease symptom development, resistance and basal defence 1,11,12 . Moreover, several studies have analysed the stability of candidate RGs in some pathosystems, demonstrating that some RGs show a certain degree of variability. In fact, plant pathogens, such as viruses, bacteria and fungi, can induce metabolic alterations and gene expression reprogramming in different organs of the host plant, thus modifying the expression of RGs [13] [14] [15] [16] . There are few studies aimed at identifying putative RGs that can be used in transcriptomic analyses for plant pathogenic bacteria, including Citrus spp., such as Xanthomonas citri 17 , Xylella fastidiosa and Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus 18 , and potato, such as Pectobacterium atrosepticum 19 . Regarding phytopathogenic pseudomonads, a study has been performed with the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana and virulent and avirulent strains of Pseudomonas syringae 6 . P. s. pv. actinidiae (PSA) is the causal agent for bacterial canker of both the yellow-fleshed (Actinidia chinensis) and green-fleshed (A. deliciosa) kiwifruit, and it is currently causing severe economic losses worldwide 20 . This pathogen, most probably, originated in China 21-23 and shows a diverse population structure 24 . Proteomic studies revealed the involvement of multiple classes of proteins that are differentially expressed by the plant and the pathogen occurring over a period of weeks after inoculation, as demonstrated by its necrotic or hemibiotrophic phase 25, 26 . So far, detailed transcriptomic analyses performed during the early stages of plant colonization have not be released, and a selection of RGs for the normalization of qPCR and RT-qPCR gene expression would be useful to standardize and compare the data. In this study, several algorithms such as geNorm 27 , NormFinder 28 , BestKeeper 29 and the deltaCt method 30 were employed to assess the expression stability of nine RGs belong to different functional and abundance classes to significantly reduce the chance that they are co-regulated. Four of these genes were used in previous studies as RGs for kiwifruit: actin (ACT) 31,32 , eukaryotic elongation factor 1\u03b1 (eEF-1a) 33 , protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) 33 and ubiquitin conjugating enzyme 9 (UBC9) 34 . Other genes were described as RGs, either to pathosystems or biotic stress: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) 35 , SAND family protein (SAND) 13,16,36 , \u03b2 -tubulin (TUB) 14,36 , 7s-globulin (GLO7A) 37 and cyclophilin (CYP) 38,39 .",

A single peak in the obtained melting curve confirmed the specificity of the amplicon, and no signal was detected in the negative controls for all of the tested RGs (see Supplementary Fig. S2 online) . In addition, a single band with the expected size was detected in a single PCR product (see Supplementary Fig. S3 online) . The standard curve method using a pool of all of the cDNA samples was performed to calculate the PCR efficiency (E) and the correlation coefficient (R2) of each primer pair.

In each comparison group, the nine RGs were ranked from the most stable to the least stable. The data obtained from biological replicates were analysed separately to verify that the variation was not due to the treatment, but was intrinsic to the gene itself 40,41 . Genorm Analysis. Nine RGs were ranked in three comparison groups based on their average expression stability (M-value), as shown in Tables 2, 3 and 4. All of the tested RGs showed an overall limited variance, with M-values lower than 1.5, which was the default limit (M\u2264 1.5), indicating a high stability level of the analysed genes in our experimental conditions. GAPDH, PP2A and UBC were the three most stable genes in this pathosystem, with slight differences in ranking for three comparison groups. In A. deliciosa leaves inoculated with a low dose of bacterial inoculum, GAPDH was the most stable gene (Table 2) , while in leaves inoculated with a high dose of bacterial inoculum and when all of the sample sets were analysed together, PP2A was the most stable gene (Tables 3 and 4 ). TUB was the least stable gene in three comparison groups (Tables 2, 3 and 4). In this study we used the geNorm algorithm to find the optimal number of suitable RGs required for proper normalization. In three comparison groups, geNorm analysis revealed that by step wise calculation the pairwise variation value V2/3 was lower than the threshold value (0.15), suggesting that two RGs could be used for normalization under these conditions (Fig. 2 ). This suggested that the optimal number of RGs for normalization was two and that the addition of the third RGs showed no significant effect on the normalization of gene expression. Finally, GAPDH and PP2A were identified as the best RGs and selected for normalization by geNorm.",

            "text": "In research of plant molecular pathology, studies on gene expression patterns are important for understanding the biological process involved in host-plant interactions. Presently, several methods can be applied to study gene expression levels, but RT-qPCR has become the primary quantitative method for the high-throughput and accurate expressing profiling of target genes. For RT-qPCR analysis, the requirement of a normalization method against RGs is important to achieve reliable results. As suggesting by the \"Minimum Information for publication of Quantitative real-time PCR Experiments\" (MIQE) guidelines 4 , the use of RGs as internal controls is the most appropriate normalization strategy 7 . Ideal RGs should be stably expressed in all cells or tissues and remain stable under different experimental conditions 42 . Several studies highlighted that there is neither a universal RG nor a defined number of genes to use, but the choice and an optimal number of RGs should be experimentally determined 4, 27 . Many reliable RGs have been determined in plant cells and across different plant species, developmental stages, and biotic and abiotic stresses 43 . However, to the best of our knowledge, few studies have been carried out to assess RGs in bacteria-plant pathosystems 6 . Here, we assessed nine RGs for their use as internal controls in gene expression studies of the A. deliciosa response to infection by PSA upon leaf infiltration using two different doses of bacterial inoculum. To identify the best RGs, four different statistical algorithms were used. Combined use of geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper and the deltaCt method to select and validate the best RGs generated substantial discrepancies in the final ranking due to different mathematical models associated with each algorithm, as confirmed by other studies 18, 44, 45 . As reported in other studies, the most discrepant results in gene stability ranking were obtained with BestKeeper 46 . In the total dataset, PP2A, GAPDH and UBC were identified as the top three RGs using geNorm, while GAPDH, PP2A and ACT were suggested as the most stable RGs by NormFinder and the deltaCt method. According to BestKeeper, ACT, GAPDH, PP2A and UBC were ranked fifth to eighth, respectively. Among all of the tested RGs, TUB was ranked as the least stable gene in the four statistical algorithms, and its use as a RG should be avoided in RT-qPCR experiments in this pathosystem. To overcome differences in the ranking of RGs, we adopted the geometric mean of all four algorithms to obtain a final ranking 47 .",

The optimal number of candidate RGs for normalization of RT-qPCR data has been evaluated by geNorm software. Our results showed a pairwise variation V2/3 value below 0.15, which indicates that combination of two-RGs was sufficient for optimal normalization in the three comparison groups. The final ranking showed that the two top RGs for the total dataset were GAPDH and PP2A and can be used as RGs for RT-qPCR normalization in this pathosystem. GAPDH was indicated to be a stable RG in a tomato-virus interaction 15 , in virus-infected mammalian cells 48 and in wheat infected with barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV) 14 , but was the least stable RG in Coffea spp. hypocotyls inoculated with Colletrichum kahawae 13 . PP2A was a stable RG in virus-infected leaf tissues of Nicotiana benthiamiana 48 and in virus-infected Arabidopsis thaliana 43 . In our study, UBC was among the four most stable RGs, as demonstrated in Coffea arabica leaves inoculated with Hemileia vastarix 49 , but was considered to be the least stable RG in common bean inoculated with Colletotrichum lindemuthianum 50 . TUB was not confirmed as a stable normalization factor in our conditions, confirming our previous proteomic study that showed the variability of this protein in A. chinensis shoot during systemic infection with PSA 25 ; however, in other pathosystems, such as Puccinia graminis f sp. tritici-infected wheat, TUB was one of the most stable RGs 51 . Furthermore, this RG showed highly variable expression levels in closely related cereals, such as wheat, barley and oat infected with BYDV; TUB was unstable in wheat and reasonably stable in two other species 14 . The SAND transcript was ranked lower among RGs in our pathosystem than was identified in Nicotiana benthiamiana and Lycopersicum esculentum plants inoculated with viruses 52, 53 . These variations in the expression profiles of RGs in different pathosystems confirm the need for validation for RGs under each specific condition. Some RGs can be involved in different metabolic pathways 13 and influenced in a plant tissue-dependent manner during plant-pathogen interactions 15 .",

SOD catalyses the dismutation of O 2 to H 2 O 2 , CAT dismutates H 2 O 2 to oxygen and water, and APX reduces H 2 O 2 to water by utilizing ascorbate as a specific electron donor 55 . The balance between SOD and APX or CAT activities in cells is crucial for determining the steady-state level of O 2 and H 2 O 2 . In our study, the accumulation of APX, CAT and SOD gene transcripts was strongly influenced by the dose of bacterial inoculum used. Indeed, these genes involved in ROS detoxification and the oxidative-stress response have a key role for bacteria survival and pathogenesis 55 . The APX up-regulation during a relatively long time course of infection (i.e., 10 days) was observed upon the twig inoculation with the same high dose of PSA CRA-FRU 8.43 also in the case of A. chinensis \"Soreli\" 25 . In the same study, however, neither CAT nor SOD were found differentially expressed 10 days after the twig inoculation. Irrespective of the inoculum doses, both CAT and SOD resulted up-regulated during the first four days of infection, and, subsequently, their level in the leaf tissues declined. Interestingly, a similar trend was observed for SOD in the Phaseolus vulgaris/P. s. pv. phaseolicola pathosystem after the inoculation of bean leaves with the same high dose of bacterial inoculum used in the present study (i.e., 1 \u00d7 10 7 cfu/ml) 56 . In this study, however, the SOD level in the bean primary leaves and into the apoplastic fluid starts to decrease 48 and 24 hours after the artificial inoculation.",

This is the first study in which a set of candidate RGs was analysed in terms of their expression stability in A. deliciosa leaves infected with PSA.

Two-yearold, self-rooted, pot-cultivated A. deliciosa \"Hayward\" plants and the pandemic PSA strain CRA-FRU 8.43 were used in this study 21 . This bacterial strain was originally isolated from A. chinensis leaf spot and further characterized 57, 58 . Plants were maintained in an aseptic room with 95% relative humidity with natural light and no further fertilization after their transfer from the nursery. They were watered regularly. Inoculation took place in spring (i.e., May). The strain was grown for 48 h on nutrient agar (Oxoid) with 3% sucrose added (NSA) at 25 \u00b1 1 \u00b0C. Subsequently, a low (1-2 \u00d7 10 3 cfu/ml) and high (1-2 \u00d7 10 7 cfu/ ml) dose of bacterial inoculum, determined using spectrophotometry, were prepared in sterile, distilled water. To avoid wounding, the inoculation occurred by gently spraying the suspensions on the abaxial surface of fully expanded, healthy, young leaves, until the appearance of homogenous water-soaked areas on the whole leaf lamina. Twenty plants per dose were inoculated. Artificial inoculations were performed separately, according to the dose. Control plants were treated in the same way with sterile, distilled water. After inoculation, plants were maintained separately and were kept for 24 h in a moist chamber (100% humidity), which was required for optimal infection. During the experiment, the multiplication and growth of the pathogen was assessed as previously described 21 . Leaves were collected after one day post-inoculation and at intervals of three days for 13 days, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u2212 80 \u00b0C until RNA isolation. In the same treatment group (inoculated and mock inoculated), each biological replicate was obtained by pooling three leaves from different plants harvested at random. Three independent biological replicates were performed for each sample with three technical replicates each.",

These genes belong to different functional and abundance classes to significantly reduce the chance that they are co-regulated. APX, CAT and SOD were selected as genes of interest. Gene-specific primers, such as SAND, TUB, GLO7A, CYP, GAPDH, APX, CAT and SOD, were designed in our laboratory using Primer Expression software version 3 ( Table 1 ). The amplification efficiency of each candidate/target gene was determined using a pool representing all of the cDNA samples. First, all of the primers were examined by end-point PCR, all of the chosen candidates/target were expressed, and specific amplification was confirmed by a single band of appropriate size in a 2% agarose gel after electrophoresis (see Supplementary Fig. S3 online) . In a second step, the pool was used to generate a five-point standard curve based on a ten-fold dilution series.
