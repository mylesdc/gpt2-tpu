Kozak sequence was added each time the gene was found in N-ter in the final plasmid. For the insertion into pCR8/GW/TOPO plasmid, genes were first amplified by PCR using Phusion enzyme (Finnzymes, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Illkirch, France) and the following BRET primers: Hsp27: Forward=5'-ATG ACC GAG CGC CGC GTC CC-3', Forward kozak = 5'-GCC ACC ATG ACC GAG CGC CGC GTC CC-3', Reverse=5'-CTT GGC GGC AGT CTC ATC GG-3', eIF4E: Forward=5'-ATG GCG ACT GTC GAA CCG GAA AC-3', Forward kozak =5'-GCC ACC ATG GCG ACT GTC GAA CCG GAA AC-3', Reverse=5'-AAC AAC AAA CCT ATT TTT AGT GGT GG-3'. Then, dATP with Go Taq enzyme (Promega, Charbonnieres, France) were added at the ends of the gene (PCR product) to allow matching between gene and plasmid. Genes were then purified from the PCR product with the Wizard SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up System kit (Promega). The insertions into plasmids were realized by TOPO reaction according to manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Competent bacteria \"MACH 1\" (Invitrogen) were transformed using TOPO reaction products and the clones we obtained were analysed by PCR with Go Taq enzyme (Promega). Positives clones were amplified by mini-culture and DNA was extracted with Wizard Plus SV Minipreps DNA Purification System kit (Promega), and sent for sequencing (M13 Forward primer) (GATC, Mulhouse, France). The second step was gene transfer from pCR8/GW/TOPO intermediate plasmids to destination plasmids containing luciferase and YFP by LR Gateway recombination reaction using LR clonase according to manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). The destination plasmids pRLuc-C, pRLuc-N, pEYFP-N and pEYFP-C were received from Nelson Dusetti (UMR 1068, Centre Recherche Canc\u00e9rologie Marseille, France). Competent bacteria \"MACH 1\" (Invitrogen) were transformed using LR reaction products. The clones obtained were amplified by mini-culture and DNA was extracted with the Wizard Plus SV Minipreps DNA Purification System kit (Promega). Enzymatic digestion by BsrGI (Promega) was performed in order to identify positives clones that were then amplified by maxi-culture and DNA was extracted using the PureYield Plasmid Midiprep System kit (Promega), and sent for sequencing (BRET primers) (GATC). For each gene (Hsp27, eIF4E) four plasmids with luciferase or YFP in N-terminal or C-terminal part were constructed. Constructs were checked by western blot, fluorescence visualization, and luminescence reading.",

We measured the fluorescence of DNA/Ethidium Bromide (BET) complex with and without our compound. We used Docetaxel and Gemzar as negative controls and Doxorubicin as a positive control, respectively. As represented in Supplementary Figure 1 , we observed that phenazine compound 14 did not show any inhibition of the fluorescence of DNA/BET complex at all tested concentrations. In the contrary, Doxorubicin removed BET from DNA, thereby decreasing fluorescence. In parallel, the auto-fluorescence of the compound was tested at the highest dose, and no interference with the assay was detected. Our results allowed us to conclude that compound 14 was not a DNA intercalating agent. .

The resulting protein/protein docked conformations were clustered and visualized; then, in the absence of any relevant crystallographic information, the structure of each complex characterized by the lowest interaction energy in the prevailing cluster was selected for further modeling [7] . The selected Hsp27/eIF4E complexes were then solvated in a TIP3P [11] water box and, then, the required amount of Na + and Clions were added to neutralize the system and to mimic physiological salt conditions (150 mM), removing eventual overlapping water molecules. The solvated systems were subjected to a combination of steepest descent/conjugate gradient minimization of the potential energy, during which all bad contacts were relieved. The relaxed systems were then gradually heated to 300 K in three intervals by running constant volume-constant temperature (NVT) MD simulation, allowing a 0.5 ns interval per 100 K. Subsequently, 40 ns MD simulations under isobaricisothermal (NPT) conditions were conducted to fully equilibrate each solvated compound. The SHAKE algorithm with a geometric tolerance of 5x10 -4 \u00c5 was imposed on all covalent bonds involving hydrogen atoms. Temperature control was achieved using the Langevin temperature equilibration scheme and an integration time step of 2 fs. The particle mesh Ewald (PME) method [12] was used to treat the long-range electrostatics. At this point, these MD runs were followed by other 200 ns of NVT MD simulation. eIF4E purification eIF4E was cloned into pT7, the proteins were expressed in Bl21 STAR strain in LB in the presence of 100\u03bcg/mL ampicillin.

To further estimate the relative contribution of the residues involved in the protein/ protein binding interface to the overall binding event, the enthalpic term of the \u0394G bind was deconvoluted into its main components for each individual residues (\u0394H bind,res ) of the proteins in the corresponding systems. This analysis was carried out using the MM/GBSA approach, [13, 14] and was based on the same snapshots considered for binding free energy calculation.",

(a) 5\u03bcg of DNA and 1\u03bcg of Ethidium Bromide at 0.1mg/ml were mixed together in water and incubated for 15 min at RT to allow the formation of the DNA/EtBr complex. Compound 14 and control compounds were diluted in milliQ water at different concentrations (25, 50, 100, 200\u03bcM) and added to the mix to achieve the desired concentration and. After 1hour incubation at RT, the DNA/EtBr complex was excited at 560nm and the fluorescence emission was recorded at 590 nm by using an OD reader. The fluorescence values were normalized to wells containing only DNA and EtBr. (b) Fluorescence of each compound alone, measured by optic density (OD), has also been tested at 200\u03bcM to test the presence of a background noise that can disturb the analysis.",
