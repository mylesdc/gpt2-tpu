            "text": "Background: Deep sequencing makes it possible to observe low-frequency viral variants and sub-populations with greater accuracy and sensitivity than ever before. Existing platforms can be used to multiplex a large number of samples; however, analysis of the resulting data is complex and involves separating barcoded samples and various read manipulation processes ending in final assembly. Many assembly tools were designed with larger genomes and higher fidelity polymerases in mind and do not perform well with reads derived from highly variable viral genomes. Reference-based assemblers may leave gaps in viral assemblies while de novo assemblers may struggle to assemble unique genomes. Results: The IRMA (iterative refinement meta-assembler) pipeline solves the problem of viral variation by the iterative optimization of read gathering and assembly. As with all reference-based assembly, reads are included in assembly when they match consensus template sets; however, IRMA provides for on-the-fly reference editing, correction, and optional elongation without the need for additional reference selection. This increases both read depth and breadth. IRMA also focuses on quality control, error correction, indel reporting, variant calling and variant phasing. In fact, IRMA's ability to detect and phase minor variants is one of its most distinguishing features. We have built modules for influenza and ebolavirus. We demonstrate usage and provide calibration data from mixture experiments. Methods for variant calling, phasing, and error estimation/correction have been redesigned to meet the needs of viral genomic sequencing. Conclusion: IRMA provides a robust next-generation sequencing assembly solution that is adapted to the needs and characteristics of viral genomes. The software solves issues related to the genetic diversity of viruses while providing customized variant calling, phasing, and quality control. IRMA is freely available for non-commercial use on Linux and Mac OS X and has been parallelized for high-throughput computing.",

            "text": "Influenza viruses cause a significant disease burden as a result of seasonal activity and outbreaks. During the 2012-2013 influenza season in the United States, influenza virus caused an estimated 633,001 hospitalizations including 27,810 deaths [1] . Due to the potential severity of this disease and the fast mutation rate of the virus, a large global surveillance network is required to monitor circulating strains in order to characterize variants and select regional vaccines. In 2014, over 300,000 influenza samples were collected in 124 countries [2] and global surveillance efforts deposited over 80,000 gene segments in GenBank and GISAID. At the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, Georgia, USA, over 6500 influenza gene segments were sequenced in 2014. About 1 out of every 4 of these segments was generated using next generation sequencing (NGS) technology. In 2015, almost all gene segments were sequenced using NGS (93 % of 23,000 generated). Next generation sequencing of influenza viruses, compared to traditional methods (such as Sanger sequencing), increases sample multiplexing by up to 48 fold and coverage depths by up to 1000 fold. These benefits allow for greater overall throughput and increased accuracy in studying sub-populations within viral samples; however, keeping up with the NGS data deluge is challenging, particularly for influenza viruses.",

These genes segments code for hemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA), matrix protein (M1), ion-channel protein (M2), nucleoprotein (NP), non-structural protein (NS) and three polymerase proteins (P1, PB1, and PB2). The polymerase complex typically generates one spontaneous mutation during each replication cycle [3] , thereby accounting for a mean substitution rate of 10 \u22123 substitutions per site per year [3] . Moreover, a single host that has been simultaneously infected with two or more different virus strains can serve as a mixing vessel in which novel virions are formed. This process, known as virus reassortment, can cause outbreaks of infection, with potentially dire consequences, if the new virus is both pathogenic and readily transmitted.",

Antigenic drift and shift events create virus strains that may not be efficiently captured in host immune responses generated by current vaccines and it is therefore important to track changes in all gene segments during surveillance of circulating influenza virus strains. Until recently, only HA, NA and M gene segment changes of circulating human seasonal influenza virus strains were routinely tracked, but the emergence and detection of highly pathogenic avian influenza strains caused a rapid expansion in surveillance efforts for zoonotic viruses to the extent that sequencing of all gene segments of avian and swine viruses is now typical and routine. Likewise, using NGS technologies, it is now not only feasible but also routine to sequence all gene segments of the comparatively large number of sampled seasonal human influenza viruses.",

Typical reference-based NGS assembly programs were written for eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms with non-segmented genomes [5] [6] [7] [8] that undergo slower mutation rates than RNA viruses. These programs discard read sequences from assembly that have too many mismatches or insertions/deletions (indels) versus a defined reference sequence within some configurable scoring threshold. Read sequences containing variants are more frequently discarded from reference-based assemblies due to an overall mismatch to the reference and it is possible, therefore, for thousands of acceptable reads to be excluded, thereby minimizing overall coverage and preventing complete assembly. Because RNA viruses may contain phased minor variants at almost any frequency or position, a unique approach is required to efficiently assemble NGS virus reads while maximizing overall coverage, even when high coverage depths are achieved.",

IRMA automates quality control, such as the removal of short, low quality, and chimeric reads, and gives options for reference elongation to discover novel untranslated regions (UTRs). In order to handle the ever growing demand for high volume sequence assembly and analysis, IRMA parallelizes tasks at almost every stage-by single multi-core computer or by grid-and integrates different tools and options to let the user determine the appropriate burden of compute time versus accuracy. Named configuration files are used to adapt assembly options to the strengths of particular deep sequencing platforms while ensuring ease of use and consistency.

Any unmatched reads go back into the pool for additional rounds of matching after the references are refined. It is this step that ensures unmatched reads are not unnecessarily discarded because of the use of genetically distant reference sequences. The second phase (steps 6-9) of the IRMA pipeline finalizes the assemblies by iteratively editing references in order to find an optimal assembly score, after which read-pairs may be merged, statistics tabulated, variants called, and figures drawn.

            "text": "Such genetic diversity can overwhelm standard match & align approaches, as can be seen by comparing the results of several different alignment strategies on short sequence samples from our full influenza reference dataset (section Influenza alignment dataset) versus a set of consensus references. We selected BLAT, Bow-tie2, and MOSAIK as representatives of local alignment strategies, used YARA and Bowtie2 (end-to-end mode) as an example of semi-global alignment, and LABEL for machine learning and statistical approaches (see section Random subsequence datasets ( Fig. 3 & Additional file 1)). Figure 3a illustrates that a 10 % difference from the assembly reference (15/150nts) is enough to start losing sensitivity for local aligners, and by design, for semi-global aligners. LABEL (used to sort reads into segment bins in the IRMA pipeline) uses profile hidden Markov models along with a support vector machine for classification of reads instead of capturing them based on overall match to a reference set [11] . Capturing reads using a statistical model is expected to be more sensitive to actual influenza diversity. On the other hand, using a reference sequence is much more computationally expedient. Figure 3b shows how read misclassification (matching to influenza, but the wrong subtype or gene segment) can also occur for more sensitive approaches. This is consistent with the wellknown [14] trade-off between sensitivity and specificity that can hamper the accuracy of more permissive classifiers. For example, our attempts to increase BLAT's sensitivity by relaxing read matching criteria ( Fig. 3c ) provided diminishing returns (0.12 % more matches from 80 to 60 % minimum identity) while increasing the rate of flu read misclassification. Mutations introduced during the sequencing process are difficult to distinguish from real, genetic variability. One can attempt to do so using accurate estimates of sequencer error, as discussed in later sections. However, the disconcerting issue is that genetic variability is compounded with the variability introduced by sequencing error, making the capture of distant reads even more difficult for RNA virus assembly. Given the reality of sequencing error and LABEL's use of genetic diversity to train its algorithm, we reassessed the four best method's sensitivity and classification accuracy on influenza data with artificially mutated sample subsequences from a set of references at various fixed distances (see section Influenza A(H3N2) genetic diversity, (Fig. 2) ). Additional file 1 shows that sensitivity begins to drop after a 7 to 17 % difference from the reference set (depending on method). LABEL sensitivity is lower for artificial variation than for genetic variation (Fig. 3) , due to its reliance on a training set of actual influenza sequences. Misclassification appears at 25 nucleotide differences (of 150nts) for most methods, except for YARA, which has a maximum edit distance. As an alternative LABEL strategy, the LABEL \"trio\" set of modules succeeds in reducing misclassification by focusing on classifying HA, NA and the internal gene segments separately (see section Influenza A(H3N2) genetic diversity, (Fig. 2 ) as well as Additional file 2). We therefore have chosen to use the LABEL \"trio\" module set in IRMA's sorting step (Fig. 1b, step 4 ) to balance sensitivity & accuracy.",

Figure 6 further shows the differences between the known baseline sequences and the final assembled Cell data were omitted when counts were zero. The null hypothesis was that variants were produced by sequencer error. All tests were with respect to second-order corrected, one-sided 99.9 % binomial confidence intervals. The percentages of minor variant alleles not distinguishable from sequencer error is marked \"fails\" for failing to reject the null hypothesis. The percentage of variants rejecting the null hypothesis is marked \"sig.\" for significant and are candidates for calling single nucleotide variants consensuses. Phylogenetic trees are given to show the relationship between the starting references and the known baselines for each gene segment. We observe that, given enough rounds of gathering reads, IRMA can converge to the correct consensus sequence regardless of the starting reference used while running a standard assembly program non-iteratively (such as Bowtie2) yields a reference dependent result. We believe IRMA is successful in assembling reads to more distant references because viral gene segments have varying levels of conservation across their length that allow for the capture of a portion of the reads. Furthermore, the first reads gathered will not, on average, solely overlap the more conserved regions but will span some of the less conserved regions as well. Combined with a slower but more sensitive statistical alignment strategy (SAM), reads can be accurately placed. Editing the reference set to the consensus of the data actually found moves the references closer to the read pool and allows for gathering even more distant reads.",

A big advantage of deep sequencing is that it provides for the detection of very low frequency minority alleles. Therefore, it is important to objectively assess whether allele frequencies are accurately estimated for any new NGS methodology. In order to calibrate IRMA's frequency calculations, we artificially mixed two closely related influenza A(H3N2) viruses in twn ratios, including two unmixed controls, in triplicate (see Sequencing and mixture protocol). The material was normalized and mixed post PCR amplification in order to correctly control for the amount of each virus added to the mixture.

Importantly, the relatively high variability (~2 % error) in the absolute error for the non-iterative approach (Bowtie2) means one cannot accurately characterize low frequency minority variants without finding a better reference first.

On the other hand, we based our statistical tests solely on multiple estimates of sequencer error-both assembly-specific and allele-specific measures. Such estimates of error must be shown to be reliable in the first place in order to be useful in variant calling. We therefore evaluated how accurate significance testing variants and non-variants would be on 99.9 % confidence intervals (see section Variant calling (Fig. 1b, step  8) ).

Heat maps were generated in R from pairwise distance matrices over all called SNVs and for each distance measure. Distances were in the unit interval with total co-occurrence at zero and the greatest lack of linkage at one. Linked minor variant form clusters in the heat map while unlinked minor variants only appear on the diagonal. Transitive relationships (A co-occurs with B and B with C, therefore A with C) may be inferred but not with certitude unless phasing is at maximum (Additional file 8). Given short read assembly, sensitivity to phased variants will be more difficult as the distance between them increases. Inference of linkage using transitive properties and heat maps may provide additional insights suitable for testing.",

However, for insertions, the average quality score was the average of mean quality for each insert over its length. The total depth was calculated only where reads contained flanking nucleotides. Insert positions were relative to the upstream base. The same statistical confidence intervals (Additional file 10) were used but with error estimates for paired-end insertion error rate (Additional file 9) and the average insert quality score. Minimum insertion variant frequency thresholds (default 0.5 %) are customizable and distinct from deletion and single nucleotide variants frequency thresholds.",

Deletions, by their nature, could not be called using quality score information but deletion observation count, total depth, and a minimum deletion variant (default 0.5 %) frequency could be used. Likewise, only a paired-end deletion error rate could be used for confidence interval tests.",
