Control of IBV in commercial broiler chickens is attempted with attenuated live vaccines. Historically, live vaccines, attenuated by a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 many passages in embryonated eggs, have been used to generate a protective immune response in the upper-respiratory tract. But, some live vaccines can cause a clinical reaction, which often leads producers to give less than a full dose of vaccine, particularly to one-day old chicks. When applied at a full dose per the manufacturer's instructions, effective vaccines reduce virus replication thereby decreasing the opportunities for mutations and recombination, which can lead to the emergence of new IBV types. However, improper vaccine application or vaccines that do not provide adequate protection due to serotype differences can lead to persistence of viruses in the field and the emergence of new IBV types.",

However, the emergence of new strains and the reemergence of one or more previously circulating IBV types is unpredictable, which confounds decisions on which combination of vaccines should be used. If the vaccines selected are not effective, outbreaks can occur. Typically, diagnosis and identification of IBV involves reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) amplification and sequencing of the S1 subunit of the spike gene or only the hypervariable region of the S1 subunit. The sequence data is then used to report a percent similarity to previously identified isolates. That information is useful to determine the presence of circulating strains in the area, but that data does not provide information on the genetic profile and spread of specific genetic types. Complicating the picture is the persistence of live IBV vaccines in chickens resulting in many of the viruses identified in commercial poultry being closely related or identical to the vaccines being used in the flocks. And, there are no clear and consistent sequence markers in S1 that can be used to definitively distinguish between pathogenic and attenuated viruses.",

We conducted a phylogenetic and network analysis on the full-length S1 sequence to determine the genetic relationship, diversity and distribution of three different IBV types (DMV/1639, Ark-DPI and Mass). Network analysis is useful for examining many different nucleic acid sequence data sets, but our work focused on identifying the relationships between genetic subtypes within a strain of IBV circulating in commercial poultry and comparing those subtypes to live IBV vaccines currently being used in those birds. Constructing median-joining networks for individual strains of IBV is important for our understanding of what appears to be unpredictable reemergence and movement of specific IBV types in commercial poultry as well as determining the role attenuated live vaccines play in the genetic makeup of viruses in the field. In addition, we examined the viruses for recombination sequences, single nucleotide polymorphisms and gene-and site-specific selection pressures.",

Clinical cases were obtained from 3 different diagnostic laboratories so we could compare virus types circulating in the two-major broiler chicken producing areas on the east coast namely the Delaware/Maryland/Virginia (DELMARVA) peninsula and Georgia. The DELMARVA peninsula was also selected because that is the only area that the recently emerged DMV/1639 variant type of IBV has been found to circulate. The DMV/1639 type of IBV was selected because there was no vaccine available at the time of sample collection. The Mass type of IBV was examined because an effective attenuated live vaccine was being used in those areas, and the Ark type of IBV was selected because it is an example where the attenuated live vaccine being used in those areas does not provide adequate protection against homologous challenge. Previously it has been shown that the Ark-DPI vaccine when given by eye-drop is efficacious; but chicks vaccinated using a hatchery spray cabinet, which is has become standard practice in the industry are not adequately protected against homologous challenge [8] . This appears to be unique to the Ark-DPI vaccine types since other IBV vaccine types given by hatchery spray cabinet are efficacious [8] . Despite this lack of adequate protection, producers refuse to stop using the Ark-DPI vaccine because of the presumed threat of Ark type challenge viruses in the field and because there are no other vaccines commercially available against Ark.",

The S1 gene of the PA/171/99 virus was used as a reference because it has 95.8% identity with DMV/1639 and is thought to be the progenitor of that virus (Jackwood, unpublished data). Consistent with ML analysis, the phylogenetic network analysis of DMV/1639 (Fig 7) has a more widely distributed network appearance with no clear groupings. It should be noted that all of the DMV/1639 isolates came from the Salisbury Animal Health Laboratory since that strain of IBV is currently only circulating on the DEL-MARVA peninsula. The earliest isolate of DMV/1639 obtained in 2015 was 1098 and the most recent isolate was 6985. Examining the pathogenicity of the isolates in relationship to the network shows that early isolates (1186, 1187 and 3890) are associated with cases of nephropathogenicity (rectangles in Fig 7) , whereas later isolates (3078, 4081, 5220, 5573, 6273, 6636, and 6985) are from cases with only respiratory signs (ovals in Fig 7) .",

Consensus sequences obtained directly from the vaccine bottle are observed in the network analysis as satellite populations with no field viruses included. The number of individual viruses or small groups of virus types around each of the two predominant clusters suggests that these satellite groups are the result of mutations occurring in Ark-DPI vaccine viruses persisting in the flocks.

There was no vaccine available for the DMV/1639 type viruses at the time our samples were taken, which may have played a role in the dispersed network pattern observed. Examining the pathogenicity associated with isolates of DMV/1639 showed that early isolates were associated with nephropathogenicity whereas later isolates were primarily associated with respiratory only clinical signs. This is consistent with observations in the field showing that the pathogenicity of DMV/1639 has progressed from nephropathogenic to primarily respiratory in nature (Personnel Communication Dr. Erin Brannick, University of Delaware, Newark DE). Adaptation from a highly virulent virus Table 2 . Selection profiles of the S1 spike protein. Evolutionary trajectories of avian infectious bronchitis viruses in commercial poultry causing lesions in the kidney that can result in significant mortality to a virus causing only mild respiratory signs and little or no mortality in the host is consistent with our observation that DMV/1639 is evolving under negative pressure. The viruses in this study that were obtained from diagnostic laboratory submissions all came from samples collected from birds experiencing disease. When live attenuated vaccines are used in commercial poultry flocks, the virus type isolated, even from diseased birds is often the same type as the vaccine. The question then remains if the isolated virus is attenuated vaccine masking the real problem virus, vaccine virus that has been circulating in the field and has reverted to pathogenicity, or a truly pathogenic field virus that has broken through the immune response of the bird. Examining our network analysis data for Mass, we found that the Mass viruses isolated were indeed grouped with attenuated vaccine viruses. Since IBV vaccines are adapted to grow well in embryonated eggs, the vaccine strain will often outgrow a pathogenic field virus when they are in the same sample, leading to identification of only the vaccine virus. However, network analysis of the Ark viruses shows them to be vaccine origin viruses that have undergone selection and mutations indicating that they have been circulating for some time in the field. Passage from bird to bird can serve to \"heat up\" the vaccine virus resulting in reversion to pathogenicity, thus potentially explaining the clinical signs observed in the flock. This observation is significant because it shows for the first time that the clinical signs of disease associated with the Ark type of IBV in commercial poultry are resulting from usage of the vaccine.",
