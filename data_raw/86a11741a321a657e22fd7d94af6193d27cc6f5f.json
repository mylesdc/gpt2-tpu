A phylogenetic analysis of hemagglutinin (HA) sequences showed that the circulating A(H1N1)pdm09 virus belonged to clades 1, 2, and 8 in 2009/2010; clades 3, 4, 5, and 7 in 2010/2011; clades 7 and 6C in 2012/2013; clades 6B in 2013/2014; and 6B/6B.), those infected in 6B/6B.1/6B.2 seasons (2013/2014 and 2015/2016) were at higher risk for influenza-related complications (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 1.6, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.0-2.8), pneumonia (aOR: 1.78, 95% CI: 1.04-3.04), mechanical ventilation (aOR: 2.6, 95% CI: 1.2-5.6), and acute respiratory distress syndrome (aOR: 5.5, 95% CI: 1.9-15.9). For the increased severity of infection during the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 clade 6B/6B.1/6B.2 seasons, aspects related to the antigenic change of A(H1N1)pdm09 virus, immune response of the host, and environmental factors required further investigation.",

Since 1999, the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has established a nationwide surveillance system requiring contract virologic laboratories to perform continuous virologic surveillance for respiratory viruses, particularly influenza and enteroviruses; this system was established after an epidemic of enterovirus 71 in 1998 7 . The long-term National Influenza Surveillance Network described the epidemiologic pattern of circulating viruses, and it has successfully identified the outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated coronavirus and adenovirus 8, 9 . Moreover, it also identified the novel H7N9 and H6N1 influenza viruses 10 were significantly different between each season (Table 1) . A phylogenetic analysis of hemagglutinin (HA) sequences recovered in these epidemics, along with geographically diverse global influenza A(H1N1) pdm09 viral sequences, has revealed that the sequences are members of clades 1, seasons versus non-clades 6B/6B.1/6B.2 seasons, the patients were classified into two groups. The median (interquartile range, IQR) age of patients in the 6B/6B.1/6B.2 season was older than that in the non 6B/6B.1/6B.2 seasons ( Table 2 ). The number of infected individuals aged 50-64 years was higher in 6B/6B.1/6B.2 seasons than that in the non-clade 6B/6B.1/6B.2 seasons ( Table 2 ). The rate of underlying conditions; complications, including pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); ICU admission; respiratory failure with mechanical ventilation; 30-day mortality; and in-hospital mortality in 6B/6B.1/6B.2 seasons were significantly higher than that in non-clade 6B/6B.1/6B.2 seasons ( Table 3 ).

In the cohort of individuals born between 1965 and 1979, HA-specific antibodies with activity against A(H1N1)pdm09 must have been produced and shaped by exposure to prior-season H1N1 viruses (the so called \"original antigenic sin\") 19 . Nonetheless, the HA-specific antibodies in this cohort failed to recognize the 2013/2014 A(H1N1) 25 . Compared to the A/California/7/2009 vaccine virus, viruses of clade 6B harbor D97N, K163Q, S185T, K283E, and A256T substitutions in HA1. Viruses of subclade 6B.1 harbor further amino acid substitutions S84N, S162N, and I216T and 6B.2 and carry amino acid substitutions V152T and V173I 20 . More extensive studies must be conducted to identify the potential antigenic differences between clade 6B and subclade 6B.1/6B.2; such studies are expected to improve our understanding of how A(H1N1)pdm09 evolved (and continues to evolve) and how it affects and interacts with the human immune system. In the 2017/2018 season, the WHO has selected a new vaccine virus, which is the A/Michigan/45/2015 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus (a member of the 6B.1 subclade), as the influenza vaccine virus component for the northern hemisphere.",

A potential bias may exist due to the exclusion of all cases with A(H1N1)pdm09 infection for 7 years. Nonetheless, no change was observed in terms of admission or management procedures during these outbreaks. The surveillance and reporting system in Taiwan has long been established. Taken together, the increased frequency of complications in 2013/2014 and 2015/2016 is unlikely due to detection bias. In addition, the major drawback of this study was the lack of documentation about the history of influenza vaccination in the records used to generate this study. However, a study by Taiwan CDC has reported that 95% of patients with complications in the 2015/2016 season had not received the influenza vaccine 26 . The vaccine coverage rate in non-elderly adults and elderly individuals would have been low during each of the outbreaks, particularly during the first wave, given that no A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine was available in 2009/2010. Thus, the increased severity of influenza during the 2013/2014 and 2015/2016 seasons is unlikely to reflect a decreased rate of vaccination. The study has shown that Taiwan experienced the greatest burden of influenza-related complications due to A(H1N1)pdm09 clades 6B/6B.1/6B.2 in the sixth year of its circulation. The reasons for the increased impact of influenza-related complications remain uncertain. Aspects related to the antigenic change of A(H1N1)pdm09 virus, immune response of the host, and environmental factors required further investigation. This report shows the importance of influenza disease surveillance and requires that the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus should always be considered.",

The network consists of eight regional commissioned laboratories located in the northern (n = 3), central (n = 2), southern (n = 2), and eastern (n = 1) parts of Taiwan. These laboratories have steadily collected more than 8000 respiratory specimens for surveillance per year, including more than 1000 influenza virus specimens annually, all of which are sent to the Taiwan CDC for the monitoring of influenza viral activity. The Taiwan Influenza Express, a weekly online influenza surveillance report, has been published by the Taiwan CDC from July to May of each year since 2005 (http://www.cdc.gov.tw/english/ submenu.aspx?treeid = 00ED75D6C887BB27&nowtreeid = 8F1E239D0FD8877A) 10, 27 . This report includes the total number of respiratory specimens; isolate number of influenza A(H1N1), influenza A(H3N2), and influenza B; and case number of laboratory-confirmed influenza cases in intensive care units (ICUs), a class of events that is considered a category 4 nationally notifiable disease. However, data on weeks 19-37 are not available annually. A confirmed case involved a patient who had acute influenza-like illness (temperature \u2265 38 \u00b0C with either cough or sore throat) and nasopharyngeal/throat or bronchoalveolar lavage samples harboring influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus as detected using real-time (RT) reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay or via viral culture 11, 28 . For the purposes of the present study, each season was defined as extending from July of the same year to May of the following year. The annual population figures provided by the Department of Household Registration Affairs of the Interior Ministry were used for the calculation of the incidence of laboratory-confirmed influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 cases in the ICU. , a 4000-bed, university-affiliated teaching hospital that is located in northern Taiwan and provides both primary and tertiary care. In addition, CGMH is one of the 8 regional commissioned laboratories of the Taiwan CDC. Patients who had acute influenza-like illness (temperature \u2265 38 \u00b0C with either cough or sore throat) and had influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus as detected using RT-PCR assay or via viral culture using respiratory specimens were included in the study. Patients whose data are not available were excluded. The institutional review board of CGMHT approved the study, and it was carried out in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations. Informed consent was waived due to the study's retrospective nature. All medical records of the enrolled patients were reviewed. Demographic characteristics, underlying medical conditions, clinical course, antiviral treatment (oseltamivir or zanamivir), mechanical ventilation, admission to an ICU, and death were recorded using a structured questionnaire. Body mass index (BMI), a measure of obesity, was calculated for patients whose height and weight data were available. Obesity was defined as follows: 1) body weight \u2265 95th percentile in children < 2 years of age; 2) BMI \u2265 25 kg/m 2 in patients aged between 2 and 18 years; and 3) BMI > 28 kg/m 2 (Chinese criteria) in patients > 18 years 29 . Medical conditions associated with a high risk for influenza complications were defined based on those listed by the United States Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices 30 . Patients with confirmed pneumonia on radiography, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute onset of cardiovascular, neurologic condition, respiratory failure with mechanical ventilation; those who were admitted in the ICU; and those who died were considered to have influenza-related complications. Pneumonia on radiography was diagnosed based on the presence of a consolidation, infiltrate, or opacity 31 . ARDS was defined according to the standard criteria 32 . The primary study outcome was the occurrence of (any) influenza-related complications. The secondary study outcomes were pneumonia, mechanical ventilation, ARDS, 30-day mortality, and in-hospital mortality.",

Sanger sequencing of the viral HA and NA genes was performed to establish clade designation and to detect differences in amino acid 33 . The obtained amplicons were assembled into a full-length 1,701-bp span for HA and 1410-bp for NA using DNASTAR Lasergene (DNAStar, Madison, WI). Newly reported sequences in this study were deposited at the GenBank database under the accession numbers shown in Fig. S1 for HA and NA genes. The evolution history was inferred by the maximum likelihood method based on the Hasegawa-Kishino-Yano model 34 .

            "text": ". Following the large magnitude of A(H1N1)pdm09 activity from July 2009 to January 2010, a second A(H1N1)pdm09 epidemic, evidenced by a sharp increase in the number of hospitalized patients and fatal cases, occurred in the winter of 2010 11 . Subsequently, A(H1N1)pdm09 has persisted at varying levels in the 2015/2016 season, when another A(H1N1)pdm09 epidemic occurred. The 2015/2016 outbreak included a sudden increase in the number of clinical cases with severe complications in adults aged 50-64 years. Thus, the present study aimed to describe the A(H1N1)pdm09 epidemiological and virological data obtained from the National Influenza Surveillance Network that reported laboratory-confirmed influenza cases in intensive care units (a category 4 nationally notifiable disease) during a 7-year period extending from the 2009/2010 season to the 2015/2016 season. Independently, we conducted a retrospective cohort study at Chang-Gung Memorial Hospital to analyze the clinical characteristics and complications of patients with A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection in the five A(H1N1)pdm09-predominant seasons (2009/2010, 2010/2011, 2012/2013, 2013/2014, and 2014/2015) as identified by the National Influenza Surveillance Network. When these are considered, the results of these two approaches provided a better understanding of the impact of the new influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 variant during predominant seasons on influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus-associated complications. Results National Influenza Surveillance Network data on influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus during the 2009/2010 to 2015/2016 seasons. Based on the Taiwan Influenza Express between July 2009 and May 2016, A(H1N1)pdm09 caused the highest community attack rate (the number of individuals who were infected divided by the number of individuals at risk) in the 2009/2010 season (Fig. 1) compared to other seasons. In addition to 2009/2010, the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 also predominated in 2010/2011, 2012/2013, 2013/2014, and 2015/2016 (Fig. 1). However, the incidence of laboratory-confirmed influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 cases in intensive care units (ICUs) was highest in 2015/2016 (6.47 cases per 100,000 population), followed by the 2010/2011 season (4.5 cases per 100,000 population); both values were significantly higher than the incidence of 4.0 cases per 100,000 population in 2009/2010 (2015/2016 vs 2009/2010: incidence rate ratio (IRR): 1.6; 95% CI: 1.5-1.8; P = 0.001 by Poisson; 2010/2011 vs 2009/2010: IRR: 1.1; 95% CI: 1.03-1.2; P = 0.009) (Fig. 2). The incidence of laboratory-confirmed influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 cases in the ICU was 1.1 cases in 2012/2013 and 3.5 cases in 2013/2014 per 100,000 population, a value that was lower than that in 2009/2010 (2012/2013 vs 2009/2010: IRR: 0.27; 95% CI: 0.2-0.3; P < 0.001; 2013/2014 vs 2009/2010: IRR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.79-0.96; P = 0.004). Phylogenetic analysis of the HA gene. We identified 639 patients with laboratory-confirmed influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection from the outpatient, inpatient, and emergency departments of Chang Gung Memorial Hosptial (CGMH) in the 2009/2010, 2010/2011, 2012/2013, 2013/2014, and 2015/2016 seasons. This group comprised 248 patients in 2009/2010, 152 patients in 2010/2011, 32 patients in 2012/2013, 81 patients in 2013/2014, and 126 patients in 2015/2016 (Table 1).

Case numbers with available BMI. c WBC data were available in 476 patients. antiviral treatment that reduces influenza-related complications, including lower respiratory tract infection, was evaluated14 . In the present study, the association between antiviral treatment and the occurrence of complications should be attributed to the antiviral treatment frequently used in patients with influenza-related complications. Furthermore, we observed that the severity of influenza differed significantly, especially in individuals aged \u22656 years, during the 6B/6B.1/6B.2-predominant and 6B/6B.1/6B.2-non-predominant seasons.After the 2009 pandemic, when the 2009 H1N1 virus became a regularly circulating seasonal influenza strain, the WHO recommended the use of the A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus as a vaccine strain. In the face of a cumulatively established population immunity, the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus would need to exhibit antigenic changes to avoid suppression by the host immune system.
