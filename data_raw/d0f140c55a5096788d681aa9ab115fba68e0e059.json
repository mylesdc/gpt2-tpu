            "text": "The U.S. is home to one of the largest swine industries worldwide; although the country is one of the largest pork exporters globally, the domestic market is still the most important for the industry, with 112 million hogs processed in national slaughterhouses in 2013 and with an average breeding stock of 6 million sows in the last 10 years (1) (2) (3) . Approximately 50% of the hog production is concentrated in three states, namely, Iowa, North Carolina, and Minnesota (4) . The concentration of such a large population in a relatively small area resulted in high density, and consequently, relatively high vulnerability of the industry to the introduction and spread of infectious diseases. The industry has tried to mitigate this vulnerability by increasing biosecurity and other prevention strategies, including air filtration and quarantine of incoming pigs (5, 6) . Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is, arguably, one of the most economically devastating diseases affecting the U.S. swine industry, causing annual losses estimated to be between $550 and $664 million (7, 8) . The disease, caused by the infection of an Arterivirus, referred to as PRRS virus (PRRSv), emerged in the U.S. in the late 1980s and, since then, has remained prevalent in the country (9, 10) . PRRSv is an RNA virus, which has led to the appearance of a wide array of emerging or reemerging strains with a large variety of phenotypic and genotypic features (11) . Commercial vaccines do not prevent infection although they are reported to reduce virus shedding and decrease clinical impact. Protection is reported to be more profound after infection with homologous than heterologous strains (12, 13) . Modified live vaccines are more effective than those formulated with inactivated virus (14) . Many alternative mechanisms of transmission have been described for PRRSv, including direct transmission through the movement of pigs and indirect through fomites, insects, semen, or airborne spread (6, (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) . The American Association of Swine Veterinarians (AASV) developed a classification system with four categories based on infection status in sow herds. A herd was defined as \"unstable\" if field virus could be detected within the herd. These categories are referred to as positive unstable (Category I), positive stable (Category II), provisional negative (Category III), and negative (Category IV) (21) . In the absence of a regulatory framework, data on farm-level infection incidence can only be collected on a voluntary basis in the U.S.",

Initially, participants shared weekly PRRS status data for sow farms, following and adapting AASV guidelines (21) . As the program progressed, the MSHMP expanded, and some participants are also sharing data for porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) and porcine delta corona virus. The MSHMP is quite unique because, despite its voluntary nature, it currently receives weekly data from sow farms corresponding to approximately 45% (n = 2,854,000) of the sows in the country according to the U.S. Census (3) , and for that reason, it is, arguably, one of the largest datasets of voluntarily shared information by producers on swine health in the world. The MSHMP, therefore, demonstrates how epidemiological knowledge on one of the most pressing diseases for a large industry may be gained through the analysis of routinely collected data, as part of a private-academic partnership and in the absence of a regulatory framework.",

Chi-square test and logistic regression models were also used to compare PRRS incidence between 2009-2012 and 2013, the year that PED was first detected in the U.S., and used to explain how its emergence might have affected the temporal dynamics, and overall incidence of PRRS (24) . b. A general linear mixed-effects logistic regression model was used to investigate the association between factors hypothesized to influence PRRS risk (i.e., month, farm type, county density, active participation in a voluntary control program, and proportion of farms stable) and PRRS incidence (25) . c. A mixed-effect Poisson regression model was built to evaluate the effects of land coverage (e.g., cultivated fields and shrubs or trees) and geographical features (including terrain slope and altitude) on the incidence of PRRS outbreaks considering the years of 2009-2016. The model included a random effect at the production system level and also included explanatory variables that were known to affect the risk of PRRS outbreaks such as pig density, farm size, and geographical region (26) . d. Species distribution models, such as presence-only maximum entropy machine learning algorithm, were used to build risk maps through predicting the spatial distribution of PRRSv outbreaks using a set of environmental variables. 1 That algorithm can extract associations to characterize the demographic and climatic requirements for PRRSv, and subsequently deploying those associations to predict suitable geographical locations in non-sampled areas, where most likely PRRSv outbreaks will be detected (see text footnote 1).",

Furthermore, PRRS incidence was significantly lower, and the beginning of the PRRS season was delayed, compared to previous years (23, 24) . Analysis of data collected on a regional project in Minnesota, referred to as RCP-N212, suggested an increased interest of producers in participating in regional control programs during the study period, from July 2012 to June 2014. That analysis also showed, however, that participation on a regional project is not necessarily highly correlated with probability of data sharing. Time within the analyzed period (24 months) and the probability of sharing PRRS status to the voluntary regional control program were negatively associated with disease outbreaks, while density (as number of farms per square mile) was positively associated with PRRS outbreaks. Findings in this study showed that despite a statistical decreasing trend of the disease, spatiotemporal clustering of PRRS was observed along the whole study period. In turn, farm type (i.e., farms with and without breeding herds) did not show a specific association with PRRS, although farms with sows were more prone to report PRRS status in the RCP-N212 (25) .",

However, collection of data by itself has no value unless it is analyzed to bring knowledge and wisdom to improve speed and quality of decisions (30) . Here, the value of sharing, aggregating data, and creating knowledge has been demonstrated with the use of multidisciplinary analytic tools that helped to maintain producer's interest in a voluntary data sharing project. In the absence of a regulatory framework, data sharing is a prerequisite for increasing disease awareness and, ultimately, supporting its control. Lessons learnt from the systematic analysis of the MSHMP relate to the repetitive time and time-space patterns associated with PRRS incidence in the U.S. and the regional variation, and the influence that changes on epidemiological conditions, may have in those patterns. In addition, quantitative evidence was collected on how phylogenetic analysis may support investigations on the most likely mechanisms of spread of the virus, and how collaboration and data sharing may contribute to the control of the disease at the regional level in the absence of a regulatory framework. A negative association between sharing PRRS status and incidence was found. It is unknown if this relationship is because negative farms are more inclined to share the data or if the increase in awareness has an effect on the incidence of the disease. However, in that specific study, the participation of farms, as well as PRRS status sharing, increased in the time frame studied suggesting that farmers and veterinarians may perceive collaboration as an advantage (25) .",

            "text": "Noteworthy, even though a substantial amount of effort has been devoted to describing PRRSv transmission routes (15) (16) (17) (18) , many aspects of the disease epidemiology are yet-to-be-elucidated. For example, the proportional importance of transmission routes (air, pig movement, or fomites) in the spread of the disease and whether that pattern is mostly influenced by system or region remain unknown. The application of different analytical tools to the rich dataset assessed here has helped producers and practitioners to better understand the epidemiological dynamics of PRRS. For example, we learned that the onset of the disease had a repetitive pattern and a similar starting point from the first 4 years of data of the project, from 2009 to 2012 (23) . However, data from 2013 and 2014, when PED emerged in the country, failed to signal the epidemics at the same date as predicted by previous years, showing a delay of 3 weeks (24) . Also during that same season (2013 and 2014), the same cohort of farms showed a 50% decrease in the number of PRRS outbreaks between October and March when compared with the average observed in the same season in the previous four previous years. Many factors may have impacted the change in disease pattern observed that year, including an increase of biosecurity practices associated with PED emergence, an increase of PRRS vaccination, secular cycles, or difficulty performing the routine PRRSv diagnostics following high PED mortality rates. Furthermore, no changes in the centroid of the epidemic clusters were observed between 2009 and 2014, suggesting that although incidence decreased that year, the spatial dependence of the disease prevailed. Preliminary results of disaggregating national data and aggregating cases from different states (not published) seem to point to a different temporal incidence trend between geographical regions and/or systems, and those could be caused by different factors as management, density or different climate conditions as pointed by the ecological niche modeling (see text footnote 1).",

The TD-R showed to be a valuable method to signal PRRS epidemics on those areas where outbreaks are relatively rare. For areas in which PRRSv is endemic, TD-R did not show any fluctuation and revolved around 1, which is expected for an endemic disease such as PRRS.",

To the best of our knowledge, there is no information on how vegetative buffers could prevent the spread of the diseases or protect the herd from PRRS infection. Similar conclusions were extracted using an ecological niche modeling approach in which land cover accounted for much of the variation in PRRS risk, after hog density and precipitation (see text footnote 1).

The amount of available data from Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratories, and the use of new molecular epidemiology tools may help elucidate the relative importance of different transmission routes during outbreak investigations. For example, using ORF5 sequences from five different companies and Bayesian phylodynamic methods that could integrate time, space, and phylogenetic analysis allowed for a better estimate on the history of the virus, helping us to understand the underlying connections in the disease spread process (27) .",

At this stage, the epidemiological tools included: descriptive epidemiology (incidence and prevalence over time), phylogenetic analysis, risk maps, and network analysis. Further extensions are possible. Having all the updated information in a real-time fashion can help people involved in health management to make better-informed decisions. It might also be used to replace labor-intensive scheduled reporting resulting in greater system efficiency and improve stakeholder engagement as previously demonstrated (31) .",

When evaluating PRRS incidence data at a national scale, there is a predictable incidence pattern, with winter offering environmental conditions most favorable for virus spread at long (transport and fomites) and short (airborne) distances, and hog density and system being the most relevant factors associated with the spatial distribution of disease. However, when incidence data are explored at low levels of aggregation (state or county), factors such as presence of trees, being located in a hilly area, or fine-scale weather conditions are most influential on the risk for PRRS spread. Finally, this review demonstrates the level of contribution that the use of novel multidisciplinary analysis tools applied to routine collection of large surveillance data may provide to prevention and control of livestock diseases in the U.S. and at a global scale.",
