Because the real-time PCR method was more sensitive than regular qualitative PCR methods [26] , we could first detect GPV at 4-h PI in the liver and other tissues, which was less than 40 h compared to the time required by regular qualitative PCR methods. This finding is important because the prevention and early detection are presently the most logical strategies for virus control [27] . [28] . Similarly, our study showed that GPV was distributed in the blood, heart, liver, spleen, kidney, BF, thymus, and Harder's glands at 4-h PI. Subsequently, GPV was consistently distributed in all the segments of the organs at 8-h PI. The copy numbers of GPV in the liver, spleen, thymus, Harder's glands, and BF was significantly higher than that in the other regions.

Autoclaved nanopure water was added to make the final volume to 25 \u03bcL. Each run comprised an initial activation step of 30 s at 95\u00b0C, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 10 s and annealing at 60\u00b0C for 30 s; the fluorescence was measured at the end of the annealing/extension step. The tests were performed using 0. 2 An internal positive control was introduced into the FQ-PCR assay to verify that DNA was not lost during the extraction step and PCR inhibitors were absent in the DNA templates as described by Guo et al.

The assay was conducted by assessing the agreement between the replicates in five replicates (within-run precision) and in five separate experiments (between-run precision) of the serially diluted pVP3 plasmid samples through transforming the raw data to their common logarithms and performing analysis of the mean coefficient of variation (CV) values of each pVP3 standard dilution [27] .",

The detection limit of the FQ-PCR was determined based on the highest dilution that resulted in the presence of Ct value in real-time PCR detection.DNA from pVP3, GPV-CHv and several other pathogens, including ADV, CPV, PPV, NDV, Pasteurella multocida (5: A), Salmonella enteritidis (No. 50338), and Escherichia coli (O78) (kindly provided by Key Laboratory of Animal Diseases and Human Health of Sichuan Province) were used as templates in the triplicate analyses to confirm the specificity of the technique.",
