Two ZH501-derived viruses, rZH501-M847-G and rZH501-M847-A, carried identical genomic sequences, except that the former and the latter had G and A, respectively, at M847 were recovered by using a reverse genetics system. Intraperitoneal inoculation of rZH501-M847-A into mice caused a rapid and efficient viral accumulation in the sera, livers, spleens, kidneys and brains, and killed most of the mice within 8 days, whereas rZH501-M847-G caused low viremia titers, did not replicate as efficiently as did rZH501-M847-A in these organs, and had attenuated virulence to mice. Remarkably, as early as 2 days postinfection with rZH501-M847-G, the viruses carrying A at M847 emerged and became the major virus population thereafter, while replicating viruses retained the input A residue at M847 in rZH501-M847-A-infected mice.",

RVFV infection results in high mortality and abortion rates in domestic ruminants with severe hepatic diseases. It also causes an acute febrile myalgic syndrome, a hemorrhagic syndrome, ocular disease, and encephalitis in humans [2, 3] . Transmission of RVFV to humans is primarily mosquito-borne or due to direct contact with infected animal blood, tissues or products of abortion. Since the late 1970s, several major outbreaks of Rift Valley fever have occurred outside of sub-Saharan Africa, e.g., in Egypt [4] , Madagascar [5] , Saudi Arabia, and Yemen [2, 6] . The most recent outbreak was reported in Kenya and resulted in a high reported case-fatality ratio in infected humans [7] .",

            "text": "RVFV has a single-stranded, tripartite RNA genome composed of the L, M, and S segments. The L segment is of negative polarity encoding the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L). The anti-viralsense M segment encodes two envelope glycoproteins, Gn and Gc, and two accessory proteins,14-kDa NSm that suppresses virusinduced apoptosis [8] and the 78-kDa protein. The S segment uses an ambisense strategy for gene expression; a nonstructural protein, NSs, is translated from viral-sense mRNA, while N protein is expressed from anti-viral-sense mRNA [1] . N protein and L protein are essential for viral RNA synthesis [1] and NSs protein suppresses host innate immune functions by suppressing host gene expression [9] , including interferon-b [10] , and promoting PKR degradation [11, 12] . Experiments using reassortant viruses between an attenuated MP-12 strain of RVFV and wild-type (wt) RVFV suggested that RVFV virulence characteristics in the mouse are under polygenic control [13] . Further studies using reassortant viruses between the wt ZH548 strain of RVFV and an attenuated RVFV isolate clone 13, a plaque clone variant of the wt 74HB59 strain carrying a deletion of 69% of the NSs gene [14] , suggested that RVFV mouse virulence is controlled by the S segment [15] . The importance of NSs on viral virulence was confirmed by using a wt RVFV lacking the entire NSs gene [16, 17] . Studies using the wt RVFV lacking the NSm gene showed that NSm also affected virus virulence in rats [18] . In contrast, how Gn and Gc envelope proteins and L protein contribute to viral virulence is unknown.",

Of 35 independent, cloned RT-PCR products of a region including M847, 18 clones and 17 clones had A and G, respectively, at M847, which suggested to us that the ZH501 virus stock consisted of roughly a 1-to-1 mixture of two major viral subpopulations, one carrying A and the other carrying G at M847. The virus carrying A residue at M847 encodes glutamic acid at amino acid 277 (Glu277) of the Gn envelope protein, while that carrying the G residue encodes glycine (Gly277). Sequence analysis of the cloned PCR products also showed other sequence heterogeneities, including silent mutations and those that altered amino acid sequences, within the M segment (data not shown), revealing a quasispecies nature of the ZH501 virus stock.

Anti-rZH501-M847-G serum demonstrating an 80% neutralizing antibody titer (PRNT 80 titer) of 1:640 to ZH501 and anti-rZH501-M847-A serum demonstrating a PRNT 80 titer of 1:80 to ZH501 were obtained from rZH501-M847-G-infected mice and rZH501-M847-A-infected mice, respectively. We used as controls, diluent, normal mouse serum and convalescent goat anti-ZH501 serum showing a PRNT 80 titer of 1:5,120 to ZH501. In this assay, virus titers were determined after overnight incubation of 100 ml of approximately 5.0 log 10 PFU/ml of rZH501-M847-G, rZH501-M847-A, and ZH501 with the same volume of undiluted antiserum or diluent at 4uC (Table 1) . Goat anti-ZH501 serum efficiently neutralized all viruses, while incubation of rZH501-M847-A and rZH501-M847-G with the normal mouse serum resulted in small reductions of the virus titers. Anti-rZH501-M847-G serum and anti-rZH501-M847-G serum neutralized the three viruses at different efficiencies. The differences between the virus titers (in log 10 PFU/ml) after incubation with each antiserum and those after incubation with normal serum are shown within parentheses in Table 1 . The anti-rZH501-M847-G serum reduced the titer of rZH501-M847-G by 1.63 log 10 PFU/ml, while it reduced the titer of rZH501-M847-A and ZH501 by 0.82 and 0.52 log 10 PFU/ml, respectively. The anti-rZH501-M847-A serum reduced the titers of rZH501-M847-A, rZH501-M847-G and ZH501 by 1.60, 0.7, and 1.0 log 10 PFU/ml, respectively. These data demonstrated that mouse antiserum neutralized the homologous virus to a similar extent, regardless of the PRNT 80 titers, that antiserum neutralized the heterologous virus equally but to a lesser degree than the homologous virus, and that anti-rZH501-M847-A serum was able to neutralize the titer of ZH501 to a slightly greater degree than anti-rZH501-M847-G serum; however, neither serum neutralized ZH501 equal to the neutralization of their homologous viruses.",

To this end, we took advantage of the presence of a naturally occurring Sac I site (GAGCTC), which includes the A residue (underlined) at M847 of rZH501-M847-A. Due to single nucleotide substitution, the corresponding region of rZH501-M847-G lacked this restriction enzyme site. Mice were infected i.p. with 10 5 PFU of rZH501-M847-G or rZH501-M847-A (n = 9 for each group). Organs were isolated at various times p.i., and RT-PCR products that included M847 were subjected to Sac I digestion. For each virus group, we collected 3 livers at 4 day p.i., 3 spleens, 3 kidneys and 3 brains at day 6 p.i., and 3 brains at day 7 p.i. RT-PCR products of the expected size were obtained from all samples of rZH501-M847-A-infected mice, and all were fully susceptible to Sac I digestion (Fig. 7) , demonstrating that replicating rZH501-M847-A retained A residue at M847 in the infected mice. We were unable to obtain RT-PCR products from one spleen sample at day 6 p.i., one kidney sample at day 6 p.i., one brain sample at day 6 p.i., and one brain sample at day 7 p.i. from rZH501-M847-G-infected mice (data not shown), probably due to low virus titers in these samples. Two liver samples at day 4 p.i., were resistant to Sac I digestion (Fig. 7) . Unexpectedly, the RT-PCR products of one liver sample were a mixture of Sac Isusceptible PCR product and Sac I-resistant products (Fig. 7) and all other RT-PCR products, including two spleen samples at day 6 p.i., two brain samples at day 6 p.i., and two brains at day 7 p.i.

To eliminate the possible contamination by rZH501-M847-A in the samples, rZH501-M847-A was not used in the BSL-4 laboratory during the experiments. For each sample, the virus titers, production of RT-PCR products and susceptibilities of the RT-PCR products to Sac I digestion are summarized in Fig. 8A and the representative data concerning the Sac I digestion of the RT-PCR products are shown in Fig. 8B . Most samples carrying detectable levels of infectious viruses and many samples in which virus titers were below the detection limit yielded the RT-PCR products. Accumulation of rZH501-M847-A-type virus was detected in the liver of a single mouse as early as 2 days p.i. and rZH501-M847-A-type virus became the major virus population in livers, spleens and brains from day 5 to 8 p.i. We performed sequence analysis of some of the cloned RT-PCR products to firmly establish the accumulation of rZH501-M847-A-type virus in rZH501-M847-G-infected mice; the numbers of the clones used for sequence analysis and the samples were: 20 clones from mouse 8b brain, 10 clones from mouse 6c spleen, 10 clones from mouse 7c brain, and 10 clones from mouse 7c spleen (see Fig. 8A ). Consistent with the data of Sac I digestion of the RT-PCR products of these samples, all clones had A at M847. These data unambiguously demonstrated that rZH501-M847-Atype virus became the major virus population in rZH501-M847-G-infected mice. To know whether the phenomenon of emergence of a major population of rZH501-M847-A-type virus after infection with rZH501-M847-G-type virus also occurred in cell culture, rZH501-M847-G was independently passaged five times at a multiplicity of infection (moi) of 0.01 and 1 in both VeroE6 cells and MRC-5 cells. RT-PCR products, including M847, were generated from intracellular RNAs, extracted from cells infected with viruses at passage levels 1 and 5, and subjected to Sac I digestion. We did not observe the accumulation of rZH501-M847A-type virus after 5 passages of rZH501-M847-G in both cell types (data not shown), demonstrating that the rZH501-M847-A-type virus did not emerge after passages of rZH501-M847-G in cultured cells but it became the major virus population in mice that were infected with rZH501-M847-G.",

Because the original ZH501 sample from a patient in the 1977 RVFV outbreak was not available, it is unclear whether high titers of both rZH501-M847-G-type virus and rZH501-M847-A-type virus replicated in the patient. We found that the rZH501-M847-A-type virus became a major viral population in mice inoculated with rZH501-M847-G, while viruses accumulated in mice inoculated with rZH501-M847-A were the rZH501-M847-A-type virus. Additionally, 38 of 39 isolates from wt RVFV thus far reported were found to have A at M847 and carry Glu277 [19] , which is also encoded by rZH501-M847-A. These data suggest that the rZH501-M847-A-type virus probably represented the major virus population in the patient. However, it is possible that rZH501-M847-G-type virus existed as an RVFV quasispecies in the patient and affected the severity of the disease; quasispecies have cooperative interactions to control viral pathogenesis [20] . Consistent with this notion, we found a lesser virulence in a virus sample consisting of a major population of rZH501-M847-A-type virus and a minor population of rZH501-M847-G (Fig. 8A ) and obtained from a rZH501-M847-G-infected mouse brain at 8 days p.i., than did rZH501-M847-A or ZH501 (Figs. 3 and 9) . Although the accumulation of rZH501-M847A-type virus did not occur even after 5 passages of rZH501-M847-G in VeroE6 cells and MRC-5 cells, we observed that rZH501-M847-G replicated to higher titers than rZH501-M847-A in cultured cells (Figs. 2 and S1). This trend in virus replication in vitro pointed to the possibility that the rZH501-M847-G-type virus that was present as a minor virus population in the patient could have amplified in cell culture to become a major viral subpopulation in the ZH501 virus stock that was generated in vitro.",

The virus titers in the liver of rZH501-M847-G-infected mice at 2 days p.i. were roughly ten times lower than those in the liver of rZH501-M847-A-infected mice (Fig. 4) .

The present data imply that the level of virus titers in the initial target organ, e.g., the liver, at 2 to 3 days p.i. may determine the severity and ultimate outcome of RVFV infection in mice.",

            "text": "Although we have demonstrated the importance of single nucleotide substitution at M847 of Gn protein for wt RVFV mouse virulence, further studies are required to determine how this single nucleotide substitution affected RVFV's virulence. Past studies showed that the gain-of-positive-charge mutations in the flavivirus E protein [21, 22, 23] and the alphavirus E2 protein [24] can enhance binding to negatively charged glycosaminoglycans (GAG) and increase the efficiency of virus uptake into cultured cells. However, the virulence of the variant viruses in mice is reduced, as these variant viruses are rapidly cleared from the circulatory system [22, 24, 25, 26] . Probably, the gain-of-positivecharge mutations in the envelope protein facilitates viral adherence to GAGs present in blood cells and subsequent reticuloendothelial system-mediated virus elimination from the circulation. Likewise, rZH501-M847-A, which had a negatively charged Glu277 of the Gn envelope protein, was highly virulent for mice, while rZH501-M847-G carrying an uncharged Gly277 was substantially less virulent (Fig. 3) . Furthermore, rZH501-M847-A-infected mice showed higher viremia titers than rZH501-M847-G-infected mice at 1-3 days p.i. (Fig. 4) , but rZH501-M847-G replicated at a higher titer than did rZH501-M847-A in MRC-5 cells (Fig. 2) . Accordingly, it is possible that rZH501-M847-G binds efficiently to GAGs in the circulation, resulting in low levels of systemic infection, whereas rZH501-M847-A carrying Glu277 binds to GAGs less efficiently, resulting in high titers of viremia, efficiently establishes a systemic infection that involves the CNS, and kills the infected mice. The attenuated virus, MP-12, developed by serial passage of the wt RVFV ZH548 strain in the presence of 5-fluorouracil [27] , carries A at M847 and encodes Glu277, suggesting that the presence of Glu277 in Gn does not always make RVFV virulent. The amino acid sequence of the M segment of MP-12 differed from that of rZH501-M847-A by 5 amino acids. We suspect that a combination of some or all of these mutated amino acids in the M segment contributed to the attenuation of MP-12.",

            "text": "The present study showed the importance of the A nucleotide at M847 of wt RVFV in mouse virulence, whereas it is unclear whether this nucleotide also affects viral virulence in other animals. Like rZH501-M847-G, one wt RVFV isolate 763/70, which was obtained from an aborted bovine fetus in Zimbabwe in 1970 [28] , has G at M847 and carries Gly 277 [19] , while all the rest of the wt RVFV isolates thus far sequenced carry A at M847 and encode Glu277 [19] . No information is available as to the titers of 763/70 in different tissues of the aborted fetus and the viremia status of its mother. Although we reported that pregnant cows inoculated with ZH501 become febrile, have 2.3 to 4.0 log 10 PFU/ml of viremia, and undergo abortion [29] , the relationship between level of viremia and abortion in cattle has not been carefully examined yet. We observed that very low viremia can result in abortion in experimentally infected sheep with ZH501 (J. Morrill, unpublished data), and, hence, we speculate that placental tissue in sheep and probably cattle may be exquisitely sensitive to infection, and low titers of viremia can infect the placenta at very low levels and gain access to the fetus. Virulence of 763/70 in the bovine has not been experimentally tested and 763/70 differs from ZH501 at other genome regions. Accordingly, the role of G at M847 of 763/70 in virus virulence for bovine is unclear. Experimental infection of rZH501-M847-A and rZH501-M847-G into domestic animals will show whether the importance of the A nucleotide at M847 in viral virulence is limited to the mouse model.

In the past, an experimental infection using swine influenza virus resulted in a similarly rapid emergence of a variant virus in infected hosts during single infections [30] . There are other examples of this type of quasispecies emergence and fixation in vivo [31, 32, 33] . Although rZH501-M847-G was rescued from cDNAs and direct sequencing of the M segment of rZH501-M847-G did not show the presence of rZH501-M847-Atype in the inoculum (data not shown), rZH501-M847-A-type viruses might have been generated during T7 polymerasemediated primary transcription from the plasmid or during M segment RNA replication and existed as one of a minor virus population of ZH501-M847-G quasispecies in the inoculum. Alternatively, rZH501-M847-A-type virus was generated by a point mutation at M847 of the M segment in the rZH501-M847-G-infected mice and became a major virus population as early as 2 days p.i. As discussed above, we speculate that rZH501-M847-A may bind to GAGs less efficiently than does rZH501-M847-G. This putative phenotype of rZH501-M847-A-type virus might have prevented the efficient elimination of the virus from reticuloendothelial systems, and facilitated continuous replication and systemic infection.",

(Fig. 5) , during which time most of the viruses retained the genotype of rZH501-M847-G (Fig. 8) . Because the importance of neutralizing antibodies for the protection of animals from RVFV infection is well documented [34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42] , a rapid and efficient generation of neutralizing antibodies probably contributed to low titers of viremia and prevention of systemic infection in rZH501-M847-G-infected mice. It is interesting to note that the antiserum neutralized the heterologous virus equally but to a lesser degree than the homologous virus in the cross neutralization assay (Table 1) . These results were consistent with a report that the region including Glu277 or Gly277 of Gn protein is a major neutralizing epitope site [43] . It is likely that in the rZH501-M847-G-infected mice, rZH501-M847-A-type virus emerged partly because this virus was less susceptible to rapidly generated neutralizing antibodies directed against rZH501-M847-G. We further suspect that in the rZH501-M847-G-infected mice, newly emerged rZH501-M847-A-type virus failed to continuously replicate efficiently after 5 days p.i. in various organs primarily due to an increase in the titers of neutralizing antibodies, resulting in the survival of the mice. The virus titers in rZH501-M847-Ainoculated mice were higher than those inoculated with rZH501-M847-G in many organs during the first 4-5 days p.i., while the neutralizing antibody titers tend to be higher in rZH501-M847-Ginoculated mice than in rZH501-M847-A-inoculated mice (Fig. 5) . These data suggest that rZH501-M847-A replication might have induced immunosuppression. This possibility was consistent with the data that lymphocytes were depleted in the white pulp of mice inoculated with rZH501-M847-A, but not those inoculated with rZH501-M847-G, a finding probably due to apoptosis (Fig. 6 ).",
