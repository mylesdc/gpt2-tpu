The relationships between 26 infectious diseases and each surveillance system were analysed using Pearson's correlation analysis and linear regression. There was an overall increase in R/C ratio from 2010-2017 (0.37 to 0.78). In 22 infectious diseases, there was a correlation between NIDS and NHICS. Moreover, claim-based surveillance showed less fluctuating disease incidence rates than report-based surveillance for specific infectious diseases, such as varicella, mumps, and scarlet fever. However, for infectious diseases with episodic outbreaks or low incidence, it was difficult to assess NHICS usefulness. Claim-based surveillance is less affected by limitations of conventional report-based surveillance systems, such as reporting rate. Given delays in claim systems, a claim-based surveillance is expected to be complementary to conventional systems for the detection of various infectious diseases with the advancement of bio-information technology.",

While evaluating reporting rates requires effort and time, the ratio of reporting cases to claim cases can be considered as a convenient indicator of the reporting rate 21 . We used R/C ratio as an indicator of reporting rate. Additionally, we used the R/C ratio to compare the performance of two surveillance systems, demonstrating that various factors may affect performance. We found that the overall ratio increased in most infectious diseases after the MERS-CoV outbreak, which may have promoted disease reporting from health service providers and the general awareness of public on notifiable diseases 22 . This may have strengthened the performance of the national disease surveillance system. However, an increase in the R/C ratio may be affected by unexpected factors. For example, patients suspected of having scarlet fever were included in the reporting standard since September 2012. Moreover, private complementary health insurance schemes have become very popular in the ROK; patients have asked doctors to issue certificates that clinicians have reported to NIDS as a requirement for reimbursement from private insurance 23 . This might have led to an increase in the reporting rate and R/C ratio. Such phenomenon may cause the misinterpretation of other infectious diseases (e.g., varicella) if only report-based surveillance is used 24, 25 . Furthermore, the R/C ratio for legionellosis and EHEC far exceeded 1. This means that some patients were notified without proper diagnosis codes. These diseases were often confirmed after the patient was discharged in the past; however, after MERS, the reporting system reform led to a report even if the patient was discharged. Moreover, temporary active surveillance for social concern can influence the reported cases of carriers. The above-mentioned points can be considered as the reasons for the abnormal R/C ratio (exceeding 1) of EHEC and legionella 26 In cases where it was impossible to calculate the monthly R/C ratio due to the absence of claimed case, it was assumed that 0.9 cases were claimed. www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ in R/C ratios should be interpreted carefully; if the R/C ratio has changed significantly, it is essential to evaluate factors that may result in changes in the reporting rate.",

In the post-MERS-CoV outbreak period, varicella showed a good concordance between the two systems, which may be due to its typical symptoms. The presence of typical symptoms may reduce the chance of misdiagnosis or unspecified diagnoses. With the same reason, a relatively high Pearson's R was observed for the infectious diseases that have robust and easily accessible confirmatory examination for differential diagnosis, such as HAV, HFRS, leptospirosis, and malaria. In the case of scarlet fever and mumps, that have to be differentially diagnosed from certain infectious diseases, the incidence rates may not be accurate as per both NIDS-and NHICS, as it is not usual to perform a confirmatory examination for those diseases in Korea. However, this study demonstrated a good concordance, due to decreased hesitation in diagnosing and reporting relatively unique symptoms, even without a confirmed diagnosis. An increase in the population covered by the private health insurance is suspected to be a contributing factor. For infectious diseases complying with the above-mentioned conditions, the concordance between the two surveillance systems is high. Rather, NHICS can complement the low reporting rate of NIDS and its results can be more stable because it is not affected by the change in NIDS-associated reporting rate (due to MERS, temporary active surveillance, and www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ newly implemented notifiable disease). Furthermore, considering the recent concern over the accuracy of NIDS due to an increased burden in data collection (e.g., the different diseases that need to be reported and the number of patients who need to be reported have increased), the applicability of NHICS data should be considered by public health officials.",

Considering the local epidemiology of mosquito-borne or tick-borne diseases in the ROK, it is evident that SFTS or Japanese encephalitis reported in January-March are not actual incidences but can be recognised as noise. In the observational period, the noise of claimed cases seems to be evident in the non-prevalent period of the respective diseases as the denominator of the R/C ratio increases.

The selection and concentration can be necessary with the assumption that the government has limited resources. For this, considering the aforementioned factors, NHICS can be considered as an alternative tool for reporting some infectious diseases.",

A study explained that medical providers may intentionally change diagnosis codes to prescribe certain type of drugs, such as antibiotics or other drugs that are covered by national health insurance for preventing further development of diseases. Secondly, claims and reviews are time-consuming processes that can be difficult to timely monitor for infectious diseases, as claims for the national health insurance are done monthly. Thirdly, NHICS does not obtain information to distinguish imported and domestic cases since the information is not necessary information required for health insurance.",

For example, if a test result or drug use record is reported together, the accuracy of the monitoring system can be improved by preventing up-coding 12 . A system using medical records with available syndromic surveillance can also be established to supplement low timeliness, which is a disadvantage of claim-based surveillance 30 . The surveillance system should also be designed to identify the source of infections, whether it was acquired from abroad or domestic, through separate diagnosis codes. This claim-based surveillance may not be limited to infectious diseases. For example, an increase in certain diseases due to extensive exposure to novel chemicals can be better found in a claim-based surveillance. In addition, a traditional surveillance system could be supplemented to demonstrate the effectiveness of interventions, such as the national immunization program in the time series. We expect that countries that implement a new infectious disease surveillance system or NHIS can build a better surveillance system with the efforts mentioned above.",

In the United States, claims data were used to respond to the persistent underreporting of Lyme disease and confirmed that claims data showed patterns similar to the national report-based surveillance and could solve the issue of under-reporting 31 . In Taiwan, claim-based surveillance was applied to varicella, and was less affected by the reporting rate 21 . In the case of major public health issues such as influenza, there have been attempts to use claims data more actively. In the United States, claims data have been used to monitor local and regional influenza activities 32 and suggested that spatiotemporal relationships could be identified 33 . Claims data can also verify vaccination coverage. In Germany, claims data were used to identify the vaccination rate of major vaccines, which can be used as a basis for infectious diseases surveillance 34 .",

However, this limitation emphasises the need for NHICS as a complementary tool, paradoxically. In addition, studies to complement the inaccuracies of the two surveillance systems, such as using the \"capture-recapture method\", are needed. Second, this study was conducted in single country. Third, each disease has different immune status or epidemics in each country. Therefore, the appropriate interpretation and application are necessary. Claim-based surveillance can be a good candidate for the surveillance of diseases that have a high incidence and are easily diagnosed by physicians (due to typical symptoms or highly accessible laboratory tests). Another problem to be solved for the application of claim-based surveillance is 'information for action' , which requires timeliness. However, claims-based surveillance systems in Korea lack timeliness because of the billing behaviour of medical institutions, as most hospitals charge within one week of their patients discharge or visit, while some hospitals charge 1-2 months later. Therefore, no matter how fast the data processing is done, an inherent time delay will occur.",
