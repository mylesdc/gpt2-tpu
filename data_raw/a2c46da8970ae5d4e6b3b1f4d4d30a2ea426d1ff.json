The swabs were tested for viral respiratory infections using SeeplexH RV12 multiplex PCR detection kit. Seventy six pairs of simultaneous NP and MT swabs were collected from 38 symptomatic subjects. Twenty nine (38%) of these pairs were positive by either NP or MT swabs or both. Sixty nine (91%) of the pair results were concordant. Two samples (3%) for hCV OC43/HKU1 and 1 sample (1%) for rhinovirus A/B were positive by NP but negative by MT. One sample each for hCV 229E/NL63, hCV OC43/HKU1, respiratory syncytial virus A, and influenza B were positive by MT but negative by NP.",

Our findings are similar to those reported by a study comparing parent and pediatrician collected mid-turbinate swabs in children (in which children much preferred the parent collected swab) [9] and to a number of other studies demonstrating only small differences between the yield of nasal swabs and NP aspirates in children when PCR was used for viral detection [7, [10] [11] [12] . However, NP aspirates have been shown, in other studies, to have a somewhat improved sensitivity compared to NP swabs in children, especially for RSV [13] , and the power of our study is limited, particularly at the individual virus level. Our findings are somewhat limited in their generalizability in that our sample size was small and our participants were working-age adults, many of whom were healthcare providers. About 75% of the NP/MT swab pairs were collected from the same subjects but at subsequent illness episodes. If the subjects became more adept at selfcollection of MT swabs, it may have affected the results. However, no pattern was noted for discrepant results for subjects with repeated collections. Given the results and limitations of this study, further research is needed to be confident that self-collected midturbinate swabs are adequate for all respiratory virus detection by PCR in adults.",
