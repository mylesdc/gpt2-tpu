To identify therapeutic agents for SMA, we established a versatile SMN2-GFP reporter line by targeting the human SMN2 gene. We then screened a compound library and identified Z-FA-FMK as a potent candidate. Z-FA-FMK, a cysteine protease inhibitor, increased functional SMN through inhibiting the protease-mediated degradation of both full-length and exon 7-deleted forms of SMN. Further studies reveal that CAPN1, CAPN7, CTSB, and CTSL mediate the degradation of SMN proteins, providing novel targets for SMA. Notably, Z-FA-FMK mitigated mitochondriopathy and neuropathy in SMA patient-derived motor neurons and showed protective effects in SMA animal model after intracerebroventricular injection. E64d, another cysteine protease inhibitor which can pass through the blood-brain barrier, showed even more potent therapeutic effects after subcutaneous delivery to SMA mice. Taken together, we have successfully established a human SMN2 reporter for future drug discovery and identified the potential therapeutic value of cysteine protease inhibitors in treating SMA via stabilizing SMN proteins.",

            "text": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), the leading genetic cause of infant mortality, is characterized by the specific degeneration of spinal motor neurons caused by the mutation in the SMN1 gene (Pearn et al, 1978; Pearn, 1980; Burglen et al, 1995; Lefebvre et al, 1995) . Humans are unique in that they have two SMN genes, SMN1 and SMN2 Monani et al, 1999; Rochette et al, 2001) . The SMN1 gene generates full-length transcripts (SMN-FL) and functional survival motor neuron (SMN) protein. Although the sequence of the SMN2 gene is very similar to that of SMN1, a difference in 5 bp in the SMN2 gene results in disrupted splicing of exon 7, where both SMN-FL transcripts (10%) and transcripts lacking exon 7 (SMN-\u03947) (90%) are generated Monani et al, 1999) . In SMA patients, more than 95% of cases have homozygous deletion of the SMN1 gene; even if patients have SMN2, the majority of the gene products are SMN-\u03947 which is non-stable and degrades quickly, and thus could not compensate for the loss of SMN1 (Pearn, 1980; Lefebvre et al, 1997) . There is an inverse correlation between the number of SMN2 copies and disease severity, suggesting a dose-dependent effect of functional SMN produced by the SMN2 gene (Lefebvre et al, 1997) . Therefore, increasing the functional SMN by targeting the alternative SMN2 gene in SMA patients has been a promising therapeutic strategy for SMA (Wirth et al, 2006; Zhou et al, 2012; Singh et al, 2013; Cherry et al, 2014; Howell et al, 2014; d'Ydewalle et al, 2017) . Although human SMN2 gene reporters have been generated to screen for candidate drugs, most of these studies used mini-genes that do not have the full expression, splicing, or regulatory elements (Andreassi et al, 2001; Zhang et al, 2001; Lunn et al, 2004; Morse et al, 2012) . Building human SMN2 reporters that contain all the elements of the human SMN2 gene would be essential to identify therapeutic agents that can effectively rescue motor neuron degeneration in SMA patients.",

It has been shown that in the presence of low levels of SMN-FL, the oligomerizations of SMN-FL/SMN-FL and SMN-FL/SMN-\u03947 are significantly reduced ). The reduced levels of SMN have a profound effect on spinal motor neurons, leading to axonal defects and neuronal degeneration. In addition to impaired axonal outgrowth and transport, a recent study reported the dysfunction of mitochondria in mouse NSC-34 cells with SMN knockdown, suggesting that SMN is also important for mitochondrial function (Acsadi et al, 2009) . Impaired mitochondrial function (Berger et al, 2003; Ripolone et al, 2015) and increased oxidative stress (Hayashi et al, 2002) have also been reported in SMA patients. We have successfully established human pluripotent stem cell-based models of SMA (Wang et al, 2013b; Xu et al, 2016) , which recapitulate disease-specific axonal phenotypes and selective motor neuron degeneration. Interestingly, we also observed mitochondrial defects in SMA spinal motor neurons (Wang et al, 2013b; Xu et al, 2016) . These data suggest that axonal defects and mitochondrial dysfunction are important pathological changes in SMA, which serve as unique counter assays to validate candidate compounds.",

Upon the successful establishment of the SMN2-GFP reporter in HEK293 cells, we then screened a small compound library (980 compounds) and identified a novel small molecule that can increase the functional SMN. The compound selected from this small library can significantly increase the expression of SMN protein more than 70% in patient cells, emphasizing the usefulness of this human SMN2reporter-based strategy for drug screening. To dissect the mechanism of action of this compound, we further examined the effects of this compound on transcription, protein stability, and ubiquitin proteasome and cysteine protease pathway. Finally, to determine the role of candidate compounds on motor neuron degeneration in SMA, we examined the effects of the compound on axonal and mitochondrial defects, as well as motor neuron loss using both SMA induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and SMA mouse models.",

A gRNA that specifically targets the SMN2 gene was designed ( Fig 1A) . We then verified the targeting efficiency of this gRNA in HEK293 cells (Fig 1B) . Using this gRNA together with the donor plasmid and Cas9, we next transfected HEK293 cells through the calcium phosphate precipitation method. As shown in Fig 1C, gRNA/Cas9 induced double-strand break (DSB) and promoted HR-based DNA repair in the presence of the recombination donor. After HR, GFP was specifically integrated into the SMN2 gene to generate the SMN2-GFP reporter ( Fig 1C) . Please note that GFP with TAA stop codon is specifically integrated and replaced the stop codon within exon 8. During pre-mRNA splicing, open reading frame will include the GFP cassette if exon 7 is excluded. In contrast, the TAA stop codon in exon 7 will make the open reading frame lack GFP if exon 7 is included. If a compound could increase SMN-FL splicing efficiency of SMN2, the GFP signal will decrease. However, if a compound potentiates SMN2 transcription, Figure 1 . Building an SMN2-GFP reporter line for drug screening. (A) Schematic representation of gRNA design targeting SMN2. (B) gRNA targeting efficiency was verified in HEK293 cells.

(C) Schematic strategy for SMN2-GFP reporter line establishment and small molecule screening. gRNA/Cas9 induced DSB promotes HR-based DNA repair in the presence of recombination donor. GFP is specifically integrated into the exon 8 and replaces the stop codon of exon 8.

The SMN2 reporter cells were treated with these compounds or vehicle for 2 d, and the fluorescence intensities were examined. As expected, protirelin, MG132, and bortezomib significantly increased GFP intensity. In contrast, RG7800, which can down-regulate the proportion of SMN-\u03947 splicing, significantly decreased GFP intensity in SMN2-GFP reporter cells (Fig S1) . The Z9-factor for this assay, an evaluation parameter of the quality of assays, is 0.68, suggesting that this reporter system is suitable for drug screening (Zhang et al, 1999) . We then examined a small pool library of 980 compounds. SMN2-GFP reporter cells were dissociated and plated onto 96-well plates (10,000 per well). 12 h after plating, each compound was added for 2 d. The fluorescence intensities from each well were then compared between compound-treated and vehicle (DMSO)-treated groups. This resulted in the identification of 14 hits, which brightened GFP fluorescence in the SMN2-GFP reporter line ( Fig 2G) . Candidate compounds were tested again to validate the repeatability, which showed great repeatability ( Fig 2H) . Interestingly, there were four candidate compounds belonging to protease inhibitors. Western blot analysis further confirmed that several compounds could (E) Sequencing of the DNA sequences flanking the GFP cassette confirmed SMN2 gene rather than SMN1 gene integration.

Similarly, as described in the Coriell Web site, these patient fibroblast cells possess the SMN2 gene but do not have the SMN1 gene using TaqMan qRT-PCR assay (Gomez-Curet et al, 2007) ( Fig  S3) . The protein expression levels of SMN in fibroblast cells derived from the SMA patient is much lower than those from the normal individual (WT) (Fig 3E) . After treatment with different concentrations of Z-FA-FMK (1, 5, 10, 50, and 100 \u03bcM) for 2 d, the expression levels of SMN proteins were increased by Z-FA-FMK in a dosedependent manner (Figs 3F and S4 ). Statistical analysis of biological triplicate samples indicated that Z-FA-FMK can significantly increase the expression of SMN proteins starting from 10 \u03bcM (Fig S4) . Similar results were obtained from a second SMA patient's fibroblast cells (Fig S5) , confirming that Z-FA-FMK can restore SMN protein levels in patients' cells. Notably, Z-FA-FMK could increase the SMN protein expression over onefold, which is comparable with a highly potent agent recently reported .

We first examined the effect of Z-FA-FMK on the expression of SMN proteins in iPSCs ( Fig 4A) . SMA iPSCs were treated with Z-FA-FMK at different concentrations (1, 10, and 100 \u03bcM) for 48 h and subsequently harvested for Western blot analysis ( Fig 4B) . The protein expression of SMN was significantly increased after treatment with Z-FA-FMK at 10 and 100 \u03bcM, revealing a dose-dependent effect (Fig 4B and C) . Quantification analyses revealed that the protein level of SMN was significantly increased to~170% in Z-FA-FMK (10 \u03bcM)-treated SMA iPSCs as compared with the DMSO-treated control ( Fig 4C) . Given that spinal motor neurons specifically degenerate in SMA patients, we then examined the effect of Z-FA-FMK on the expression of SMN in SMA patient-derived spinal motor neurons. SMA iPSCs were differentiated into spinal motor neurons used a modified monolayer differentiation system in the presence of retinoic acid (for caudalization) and purmorphamine (for ventralization) (Fig 4A) . Similarly, as we previously described , iPSCs first differentiated into neuroepithelial cells (NE, 1-wk) with characteristic rosette structures ( Fig 4A) . These neural precursors then differentiated into spinal motor neuron progenitors (2-wk) and subsequent post-mitotic spinal motor neurons (3-wk) ( Fig 4A) . Z-FA-FMK was applied to cultures at 10 \u03bcM starting from the NE stage (day 7). In day-24 spinal motor neuron cultures, the expression of the functional SMN protein was dramatically increased in Z-FA-FMK-treated group compared with that in DMSO-treated SMA spinal motor neurons ( Fig 4D) . After further culture, SMA spinal motor neurons degenerated; similarly, as we reported before, there was a significant increase in the caspase 3/7 activity, revealing increased apoptosis caused by the deficiency of functional SMN in long-term cultures. Interestingly, after treatment with Z-FA-FMK, the increased caspase 3/7 activity was significantly ameliorated in SMA motor neuron cultures ( Fig 4E) . Together, these data suggest that the candidate compound, Z-FA-FMK, is effective in increasing the functional SMN and rescuing motor neuron degeneration in human iPSC-based model of SMA. Western blot analysis revealed an increased expression of SMN proteins after Z-FA-FMK treatment at day-24 motor neuron stage. (E) The activity of caspase 3/7 was significantly increased in motor neuron long-term cultures (6-wk) derived from SMA iPSCs, and this increase was significantly inhibited by the application of Z-FA-FMK. Mean \u00b1 SEM, n = 5. **P < 0.01 as compared with the WT group, ## P < 0.01 as compared with the SMA+ DMSO group by two-tailed t test.

Indeed, MG132 led to dramatic increases in both SMN-FL and SMN-\u03947 proteins (Fig 5B-E) . To dissect the role of Z-FA-FMK, we performed co-immunoprecipitation and examined the ubiquitination of SMN proteins after applying Z-FA-FMK. Our data showed that Z-FA-FMK, unlike MG132, did not cause the accumulation of ubiquitinated SMN proteins ( Fig 5F) .

SMN proteins form a complex with Geminis 2-8 and are often localized in Cajal bodies in nuclei, which play an important role in pre-mRNA splicing and gene transcription (Liu & Dreyfuss, 1996; Meister et al, 2002) . Using Myc-SMN2a (generating SMN-\u03947 proteins) and Myc-SMN2d (generating SMN-FL proteins)-inducible lines, we compared the formation of SMN gems in Cajal bodies after the withdrawal of doxycycline between DMSO-and Z-FA-FMKtreated groups (Fig 6A-D) . As expected, Z-FA-FMK significantly increased the amount of nuclear SMN gems in Cajal bodies after doxycycline withdrawal in Myc-SMN2d line (Fig 6B and D) . Notably, the number of gems also significantly increased in Myc-SMN2a cells after the treatment of Z-FA-FMK (Fig 6A and C) .

Notably, two families of cysteine proteases, calpains (CAPN) and cathepsins (CTS), are reported to be associated with the initiation of protein degradations and neurodegeneration (Yamashima, 2004; Siklos et al, 2015) . Calpains are Ca 2+ ion-activated non-lysosomal cysteine proteases, and cathepsins are lysosomal protease enzymes (Yamashima, 2004; Siklos et al, 2015) . Using mRNA sequencing, we first examined the expression of hCalpains and of hCathepsins in 7-wk-old forebrain neurons and spinal motor neurons derived from iPSCs. As shown in Fig 7A, several CAPNs and CTSs, including CAPN1, CAPN2, CAPN7, CTSB, and CTSL are highly expressed (fragments per kilo base per million mapped reads value > 10) in human iPSC-derived motor neurons, implying their role in regulating the degradation of SMN proteins in human motor neurons.",

We found through FACS analysis that knockdown of CAPN1, CAPN7, and CTSL could increase SMN\u03947-GFP intensity (Fig 7B and C) . Similar results were observed from two different shRNAs that showed effective knockdown of the gene expression (Figs 7C and S6), excluding the off-target effects. We next overexpressed these proteases and found that CAPN1, CAPN7, and CTSB significantly degraded both SMN-FL and SMN-\u03947 proteins (Fig 7D and E) . Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation analyses showed that there was a physical binding between cysteine proteases CAPN1/7 and SMN proteins ( Fig 7F) . Finally, to investigate the effects of Z-FA-FMK on inhibiting protease-mediated SMN protein degradation, we treated cells that were transfected by combination of proteases (CAPN1+ CAPN7, CTSB+CTSL, and CAPN1+CAPN7+CTSB+CTSL) with Z-FA-FMK for 24 h. These combinations were used to achieve optimal inhibition of SMN proteins for better examining the effect of Z-FA-FMK on both non-lysosomal and lysosomal pathways. Western blot analyses showed that the expression of SMN proteins, especially SMN-\u03947, was significantly reduced after the transfection of these proteases; and this reduction was mitigated, at least partially, by the treatment of Z-FA-FMK ( Fig S7) . Together, these data demonstrate the novel role of both non-lysosomal (CAPN1 and CAPN7) and lysosomal cysteine proteases (CTSB and CTSL) in mediating SMN protein degradation, and Z-FA-FMK can partially mitigate the degradation. Moreover, these proteases can degrade SMN proteins through either direct binding (e.g., calpain 1/7) or other mechanisms, including lysosomal-mediated pathway (e.g., CTSL/CTSB), providing novel targets for therapeutic interventions for SMA.",

Next, we examined if Z-FA-FMK can mitigate the motor neuron loss in longterm cultures (6-wk). Although decreased SMN does not alter the initial specification of motor neurons from human pluripotent stem cells (Wang et al, 2013b; Xu et al, 2016) , these neurons degenerate in long-term cultures ( Fig 4E) . As shown in Fig 9, the proportion of Isl1 + spinal motor neurons significantly decreased in SMA cultures compared with that in the control group (Fig 9A and B) . Notably, the treatment of Z-FA-FMK significantly increased the proportion of spinal motor neurons to a level comparable with control neurons. Moreover, in long-term cultures, axonal degeneration as indicated by axonal swelling and breakdown were observed in SMA motor neuron cultures, which was also mitigated by the treatment of Z-FA-FMK ( Fig 9C) . Thus, our results reveal that Z-FA-FMK effectively rescues the motor neuron loss in long-term culture in human SMA models, suggesting that Z-FA-FMK or compounds targeting similar pathways serve as potent therapeutic candidates for SMA.

After we injected SMN\u03947 mice with Z-FA-FMK or vehicle (DMSO) in the lateral cerebral ventricles for only 3 d starting from postnatal day 1 (PND1 to PND3, daily), we found that Z-FA-FMK significantly elevated SMN protein levels in spinal cord at PND4 (Fig 10A) and increased the number of motor neurons in the lumbar spinal cord (Fig 10B) , suggesting the protective property of Z-FA-FMK on motor neurons loss through stabilizing SMN proteins in SMA mice. We then investigated the effect of Z-FA-FMK on the life span of SMN\u03947 mice.

Next, to improve the in vivo efficacy, we replaced Z-FA-FMK with (2S, 3S)-trans-epoxysuccinyl-L-leucylamido-3-methylbutane ethyl ester (E64d), another cysteine protease inhibitor which can cross the BBB. Cysteine protease inhibitor E64d is reported to have protective effects for brain injury and Alzheimer's disease (Kuwako et al, 2002; Tsubokawa et al, 2006a Tsubokawa et al, , 2006b Hook et al, 2014 ) and proved to be safe for use in humans. We first examined the effects of E64d in vitro. We found that E64d, similarly as Z-FA-FMK, also has a trend in inhibiting the degradation of SMN-\u03947 mediated by overexpression of CAPN1, CAPN7, CTSB, and CTSL in HEK293 cells ( Fig  S7) . In the long-term cultures of spinal motor neurons derived from SMA iPSCs, the treatment of E64d significantly increased the proportion of Isl1 + motor neurons, confirming the protective effect of E64d in human SMA motor neuron cultures (Fig 10E and F) . These data suggest that E64d is also a potential treatment agent for SMA.",

            "text": "SMA is the leading genetic cause of death among infants, and around 50% of SMA patients die before the age of two (Pearn et al, 1978; Prior, 2010; Kolb & Kissel, 2015) . Because SMA is caused by reduced levels of functional SMN, to increase the functional SMN by targeting the alternative SMN2 gene has been a promising therapeutic strategy for SMA (Wirth et al, 2006; Zhou et al, 2012; Singh et al, 2013; Cherry et al, 2014; Howell et al, 2014) . A challenge for this approach is to build robust and effective gene reporters that contain all the elements of the human SMN2 gene. In this study, we Data were presented as mean \u00b1 SEM. **P < 0.01 as compared with the WT mice. # P < 0.05, ## P < 0.01, ### P < 0.001, as compared with the SMA+DMSO group by two-tailed t test. successfully established a versatile human SMN2-GFP reporter line in HEK293 cells using CRISPR-Cas9-mediated HR. Because we specifically targeted the SMN2 gene in human cells in situ, an important advantage of this approach is that the SMN2 reporter has all the regulatory elements and thus will be effective in screening for therapeutic agents. As shown in our study, using the SMN2-GFP reporter, the drug screening of a small pool library effectively identified candidate small molecules that can significantly increase the functional SMN, leading to the rescue of motor neuron degeneration in both the iPSC-based model of SMA and the SMN\u03947 mouse model. Our study also demonstrates that SMN proteins can be degraded by both non-lysosomal and lysosomal cysteine proteases, and inhibitors of cysteine proteases can increase functional SMN through the stabilization of both SMN-FL and SMN-\u03947 proteins, providing novel targets and therapeutic approaches for SMA. Degeneration of motor neurons in SMA is caused by decreased levels of SMN proteins, and the level of functional SMN in SMA patients is critical for the disease severity and prognosis. Type I will die before the age of two, whereas type II patients who have more copies of SMN2 could live well into adulthood (Lefebvre et al, 1997) . Considering that the functional SMN level in SMA type II patients is~50% higher than that in type I, more than 50% increase of the functional SMN may have dramatic effects on SMA patients. The increase of functional SMN can be achieved through increasing the transcription, switching the splicing, or stabilizing the SMN proteins. By examining the alterations in the GFP fluorescence intensity in our SMN2-GFP reporter lines, compounds increasing SMN will be able to be identified and will be further validated using patient fibroblast cells and motor neurons. The small molecule (Z-FA-FMK) identified from the present study can increase the expression of SMN proteins, not the mRNA, in SMA patient fibroblast cells and iPSCs in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that this compound affects the protein stability. Moreover, Z-FA-FMK increased the expression of functional SMN proteins more than 70% in SMA motor neurons, which is comparable with the most potent SMN2 modifiers . In addition, cysteine protease inhibitors increase functional SMN through a different mechanism compared with the approved SMA drug (Hache et al, 2016; Bishop et al, 2018) , which will allow future combination therapy. Considering the identification of a novel candidate from a small library and the high Z9-factor (>0.5) of the assay, our data suggest the effectiveness of the SMN2-GFP reporter line in identifying potential compounds that can increase functional SMN.",

SMN-\u03947 is unstable and degrades much quicker than SMN-FL. The half-life of SMN-\u03947 is around half compared with that of SMN-FL . Similarly, in our Myc-SMN2a-and Myc-SMN2d-inducible cell lines, the half-life of Myc-SMN2a is around half to that of Myc-SMN2d. Although SMN-\u03947 degrades quickly, a study using severe SMA mice showed that expression of SMN-\u03947 extended the life span of these mice, suggesting that SMN-\u03947 is beneficial in SMA models (Le et al, 2005) . One possible mechanism underlying this protective effect is that SMN-\u03947 can form a complex with SMN-FL (Le et al, 2005; Burnett et al, 2009 ), which is more stable and, thus, enhance the SMN-FL proteins. Our study demonstrates that the candidate compound Z-FA-FMK can stabilize both SMN-FL and SMN-\u03947 proteins, which contributes to its potent effect in increasing functional SMN proteins. Importantly, both SMN-FL and SMN-\u03947 proteins have the ability to form gems in Cajal bodies in nuclei, suggesting that these stabilized proteins are functional. Furthermore, unlike MG-132, Z-FA-FMK did not cause the accumulation of ubiquitinated SMN proteins, suggesting that Z-FA-FMK increases the SMN stability through a different mechanism other than ubiquitination/proteasome pathway.",

            "text": "Z-FA-FMK is an irreversible inhibitor of cysteine proteases, and a recent study also showed that SMN may be cleaved by calpain 1, a calcium-dependent cysteine protease (Fuentes et al, 2010) . However, it is not known whether other cysteine proteases are involved in the degradation of SMN and whether inhibiting cysteine proteases have beneficial effects in SMA models. Using knockdown and overexpression experiments, we identified critical proteases (CAPN1, CAPN7, CTSB, and CTSL) that mediate the degradation of SMN proteins, which serve as novel therapeutic targets for SMA. Interestingly, we observed differential effects after knocking down and overexpressing cysteine proteases. For example, overexpression of CTSL has no effects, whereas knockdown of CTSL increases SMN levels. This may be because that CTSL is important for the initiation of protein degradation, which awaits further investigation. In the knockdown experiments, although the increase of SMN\u03947-GFP by shRNAs that target individual cysteine protease is only 5-20%, the total increase of SMN (both SMN-FL and SMN-\u03947) through inhibiting the activity of multiple proteases would be higher. Similarly, overexpressing the combination of cysteine proteases significantly reduces the SMN protein levels, which can be partially restored by Z-FA-FMK and E64d, suggesting that these compounds can stabilize SMN proteins through inhibiting cysteine proteases. Moreover, compounds that increase SMN stability can be combined with drugs targeting other mechanisms (e.g., increasing SMN expression) in the future for combination therapy. During the review of our article, a study revealed that calpain 1 can degrade SMN proteins, and inhibition of calpain is beneficial for SMA (de la Fuente et al, 2018) . This study is coinciding with our findings, and more importantly, our data demonstrate that both non-lysosomal (e.g., calpain 1/2) and lysosomal cysteine proteases (e.g., CTSL/ CTSB) are involved in degrading SMN proteins. Lysosomal dysfunction is a critical pathological change in neurodegenerative diseases, and, thus these lysosomal cysteine proteases could have important roles in SMA. The detailed alterations of both nonlysosomal and lysosomal cysteine proteases, as well as their roles in the pathogenesis of SMA, will be investigated in the future.",

            "text": "In SMA iPSC-derived spinal motor neurons, axonal and mitochondrial defects were observed followed by specific degeneration of spinal motor neurons, recapitulating the disease-specific phenotypes. To test the efficacy of candidate compounds, we examined their effects on these phenotypes using both iPSC and animal models. The reduced axonal mitochondrial transport and abnormal mitochondrial morphology, as well as late motor neuron degeneration, can be mitigated by Z-FA-FMK. Notably, application of Z-FA-FMK for only 3 d (PND1 to PND3) was able to increase the life span of SMN\u03947 mice, confirming the efficacy of Z-FA-FMK in vivo. Because Z-FA-FMK could not pass the BBB, this drug was administrated intracerebroventricularly for only 3 d. To increase the time window of drug administration, we tested E64d, a protease inhibitor, which can pass the BBB. Despite the potential pleiotropic effects by inhibiting proteases, E64d has been shown to be safe to patients during clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease and traumatic brain injury (from Medtrack). Our data reveal that E64d significantly increases functional SMN and mitigates motor neuron degeneration in SMA cell models in vitro. The neuronal activity of these SMA motor neurons could be further examined using electrophysiology analysis in the future. Notably, using SMA mice, we found that injection of E64d significantly elevates SMN protein levels, increases the number of spinal motor neurons, and extends the life span of SMA model mice, confirming its efficacy in vivo. Taken together, our study identifies the novel role of Z-FA-FMK and E64d in rescuing motor neuron degeneration in SMA and highlights a potential therapeutic approach through inhibiting protease-mediated degeneration pathway for the treatment of SMA.",

SMN\u03947 heterozygous mice (SMN\u03947 +/+ , SMN2 +/+ , Smn1 +/\u2212 ) were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (005025). Carrier mice were used for breeding, and the offspring were marked and divided into two groups for either compound or vehicle (DMSO) treatment. All mice were genotyped after death or weaning by PCR protocols according to The Jackson Laboratory. 60 ng Z-FA-FMK (dissolved in 5% DMSO) or 5% DMSO diluted by 1 \u03bcl artificial cerebrospinal fluid (Hara et al, 1997) was injected to the lateral cerebral ventricle of mice once daily starting at PND1 until PND3 following the established protocol (Hammond et al, 2017) . Neonatal pups were placed on ice for hypothermic anesthesia till their cessation of movement. Lateral ventricles were identified by 2/5 distance from \u03bb suture to eye and 3 mm ventral from skin. A 1-\u03bcl micro syringe with an OD 0.5-mm needle was used. After injection on the right hemisphere, pups were held for warming till recovery of movement and then placed back to the dam cage. E64d (5 mg/kg, dissolved in 1% DMSO diluted by corn oil) or vehicle (1% DMSO in corn oil) were subcutaneously injected once per day after birth. Each mouse was weighed daily from PND1.",
