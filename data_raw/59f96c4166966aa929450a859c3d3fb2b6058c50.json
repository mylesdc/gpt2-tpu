We recruited 147 adult inpatients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and 291 adult outpatients with upper ARTIs (URTIs). Respiratory pathogens were screened via PCR assays. HRV was detected in 42 patients, with 35 species A, five B and two C. Seventeen genotypes were identified, and HRV-A21 ranked the highest (9/42, 21.4%). The HRV-A21-positive infections were detected in four patients with CAP and in five with URTIs, all without co-infections. The HRV-A21 genome sequenced in this study contained 12 novel coding polymorphisms in viral protein (VP) 1, VP2 EF loop, VP3 knob and 3D regions. The infections of HRV-A21 virus obtained in this study could not be neutralized by antiserum of HRV-A21 prototype strain (VR-1131), indicating remarkable antigenic variation. Metagenomic analysis showed the HRV-A21 reads were dominant in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of the three HRV-A21positive patients with severe CAP, in which two dead. Our results highlight an unexpected infection of genotype HRV-A21 in the clinic, indicating the necessity of precise genotyping and surveillance of HRVs to improve the clinical management of ARTIs.",

For this purpose, we used only lower, not upper, respiratory samples to avoid the interference of mass microbial species, which can be carried in the upper respiratory tract. The data demonstrated that HRV-A21 reads were predominantly present in the BALF or tracheal aspirate samples collected from three patients with severe CAP. Although other agents, including Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenza, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, were identified by deep sequencing, they only accounted for a minor part of the microbial reads in early samples, indicating that colonization or possible secondary infections occurred but that they were not the primary causative agents. The HSV-1 reads were identified in the respiratory samples from two patients. However, when compared to those of HRV-A21, they were not the dominant species. It may accounts for the activation of latent viral infections during severe infections. Reads of hepatitis B virus detected in RMH001 in the second respiratory samples might result from the alveolar hemorrhagic effusion. However, the role of these infections in the severity of pneumonia should be intensively investigated in future studies. Taken together, these data suggest that there is an association between HRV-A21 and CAP. In the past, HRV infections were thought to cause changes in the airway microbiome and increase lung inflammation in COPD patients 12 . Whether HRV infection contributes to secondary bacterial infections, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, and whether HRV is a co-pathogen with these agents during the disease process (as is influenza virus) warrants further investigation 13 . Viral factors and the host immune status are responsible for disease severity during viral infections 13, 14 . The HRV-A21-positive patients in this study were not immunocompromised, but two of the three severe cases had underlying diseases; thus, the factors that contribute to disease severity require further investigation. Although the number of HRV-A21-positive cases was small, senior age may be a risk factor for the degree of CAP severity in this cohort. Similar to the infections with A/H1N1 2009pdm, H7N9 avian influenza virus, and MERS-CoV, different medical settings are also risk factors for disease severity [15] [16] [17] . Genomic variation may also be a determinant of viral adaption and pathogenesis. In the Enterovirus genus, variation can lead to the emergence of new strains or genotypes in epidemics 4, 18 . For example, the emergent EV-D68 that circulated in the USA in 2014 (http://www.cdc.gov/non-polio-enterovirus/outbreaks/EV-D68-outbreaks. html) contained mutant genomic sequences, which could have been responsible for the outbreak and increased disease severity 4, 19 . The VP1 BC and DE loops, the VP2 EF loop, and the VP3 knob regions are known to form the major neutralization sites in picornaviruses and the aa mutations in these regions might change the ability to neutralize the virus 20 . The fact that infections of the new HRV A21 isolate could not be neutralized by the antiserum against the prototype strain indicates that the new HRV-A21 strains are antigenic distinct to the prototype strain. Previous studies have also demonstrated that the single aa site mutation in VP1, the VP2 EF loop, and the VP3 knob enhance the virulence of CVB2, B3, and EV71, and the mutation site in the 3D gene, which encodes the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of EVs, decreased the virulence of EV71 in mice [20] [21] [22] . In this study, specific mutations in the VP1, VP2 EF loop, VP3 knob, and 3D regions of HRV-A21 strains were identified by deep sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. However, no specific site mutations were found in sequences obtained from HRV-A21-positive dead cases. The A389 mutation in the VP3 knob of HRV-A21 identified in this study, corresponding to the site in CVB3 has been demonstrated relating to the virulence in CVB3 21 . Whether the others HRV-A21 mutations facilitate host adaption and replication, especially in the lower respiratory tract tropism, and result in clinical disease phenotypes remains unclear and warrants further investigation. We also found the switches between minor and major alleles in serially collected HRV strains of RMH123, a dead case, which indicates the occurrence of viral quasispecies during infections. The fact that several HRV variants co-circulate in the population and that we do not have waves of one unique virus indicates a need for precise genotyping of HRV infections. Our findings highlight that HRV should not be underestimated in severe respiratory illness.",
