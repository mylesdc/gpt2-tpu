PCV2 is the primary causative agent of porcine circovirus-associated disease (PCVAD) [2] , a globally emerging disease, currently causing great economic losses in the global swine industry today [3] . The most significant pathological conditions considered to be PCVADs are post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome, porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome, and PCV2-reproductive disease [4, 5] . PCV2-infected piglets are readily contract concomitant infections, including porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus, porcine parvovirus and Haemophilus parasuis, suggesting that PCVAD is actually an immunosuppressive disease [6] . Besides piglets, mice and calves are also found to be able to infect this virus [7, 8] . The control of PCVD is based on management strategies, control of coinfections, and vaccination [9] . Vaccination is traditionally considered the most effective method for preventing viral diseases, but the period of protection afforded by a vaccine is limited and the virus cannot be eradicated by vaccination [10] . Furthermore, no effective vaccines are available for preventing multifactorial diseases such as PCVAD [11] . Therefore, alternative effective measures to control the disease are urgently required.",

When monolayers reached about 80% in each well of 24-well cell culture plates, the cells were incubated with 125 \u03bcM GSNO or 125 \u03bcM GSNO plus Hb (5, 10, 20 \u03bcM) for 6 h, with four wells for each treatment, then the cells were infected with PCV2 (1 MOI) in the presence of various drugs for another 72 h. Non-treated cells served as the mock, and the infected cells without drug treatment were considered as the PCV2-infected control. PCV2-positive cells were detected by IFA (a), and the appearance of infected cells was judged by FITC staining intensity. The culture supernatant from each well was collected for determination of NO production (b), in addition, the cells in each sample were also gathered for assay of the percentage of infected cells (c), virus titers (d), and viral DNA copies (e). Relative infected cells (%) = number of PCV2-positive cells from experimental samples / number of PCV2-positive cells from PCV2-infected control \u00d7 100. Data were presented as means \u00b1 SD from three independent experiments. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 vs PCV2-infected control NO donor GSNO exerts significant antiviral activity against PCV2 replication in PK-15 cells. Similarly, in previous studies, the NO donor SNAP has been shown to block the replication of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS coronavirus) [16] , porcine parvovirus [25] and porcine respiratory coronavirus [26] . Although the inhibition of PCV2 by NO was clearly demonstrated here, it is unclear whether the antiviral effect of the NO donor GSNO was actually attributable to other factors. To address this question, convincing evidence has been presented in this study. First, the data from a MTT assay clearly excluded the possibility that antiviral effects of the NO donor GSNO on PCV2 replication might have resulted from its toxicity to the cells. Second, GSNO generated NO in the culture supernatant of PK-15 cells and NO dose-dependently suppressed PCV2 replication. Finally, the inhibitory effect of GSNO on PCV2 replication was reversed by the NO scavenger, Hb. Overall, these results strongly suggest that NO, generated from the donor GSNO, inhibits the replication of PCV2 in PK-15 cells.",

Depending on its concentration, NO exerts its antimicrobial effects in two ways: At low concentrations, NO acts as a signaling molecule that promotes the growth and activity of immune cells, whereas at high concentrations, NO covalently binds DNA, proteins and lipids, thereby inhibiting or killing the target Fig. 4 NO production in serum from the experimental mice. At 6 DPI, serum samples were obtained from six mice in each group for NO detection by Griess reaction. Data were presented as means \u00b1 SD. **P < 0.01 vs infected control Fig. 5 Kinetics of ADWG, SI and TI from the experimental mice. Four samples were obtained from each group at the time of necropsy. a ADWG (g/day) = (final weightinitial weight) / days; b SI =spleen weight (g) / the weight of mice (g) \u00d7 1000. c TI =thymus weight (g) / the weight of mice (g) \u00d7 1000. Kinetics of ADWG, SI and TI demonstrated that, to some extent, GSNO improved growth performance and protected the immune organs (spleens and thymuses) of the mice during PCV2 infection. Data were presented as means \u00b1 SD. * P < 0.05, ** P < 0.01 vs PV2-inoculated control; # P < 0.05, ## P < 0.05 vs NC pathogen [28] . The antiviral activity of NO against PCV2 was demonstrated in vitro by its reduction of the numbers of virus-infected cells, viral titers and DNA copy numbers. The decline in the number of virally infected cells is probably attributable to the blockage of viral penetration to the cytoplasm or to the suppression of transcriptional steps mediated by NO [29] , whereas the reduced viral titers and viral DNA copy numbers are probably attributable to the inhibition of viral protein and nucleic acid synthesis by NO [12] . However, the binding, cell entry and transcription characteristics of PCV2 that are influenced by NO were not investigated in this study. Therefore, the mechanisms underlying the inhibition of PCV2 replication by NO remain to be evaluated in future studies.",

            "text": "Although the antiviral activity of GSNO was clearly demonstrated in vitro, in vivo studies are also essential to confirm the effects of GSNO on PCV2 infection under clinical conditions. Mice, including BALB/c, C57BL/6, C3H/HeJ and Kunming mice, are susceptible to PCV2, although susceptibility to PCV2 is limited among the above-mentioned mouse lines [30] [31] [32] . Therefore, the mouse is important in the epidemiology of PCV2 and can be used as an experimental model of PCV2. In this study, BALB/c mice were artificially inoculated with PCV2 and treated with or without GSNO. Our data showed that GSNO treatment released a large amount of NO, which contributed to the effective inhibition of PCV2 replication in the mice. The poor growth performance and immune organ (spleen and thymus) dysfunction induced by PCV2 infection were also improved to some extent by GSNO. Previous reports have demonstrated that dietary L-arginine supplementation induces significant increase in serum NO production and suppresses PCV2 infection in mice [33, 34] , suggesting that the antiviral effects of L-arginine are predominantly mediated by NO because L-arginine is the sole substrate for NO synthesis [35] . This hypothesis was confirmed in our in vivo study, because GSNO was the exogenous NO donor and released NO in mice. Although no weight loss or wasting was observed in the PCV2-inoculated mice, as has been described previously, the ADWG of the mice infected with PCV2 decreased to some extent in the present study, which might be be attributable to the different mouse line used there. Since Kiupel et al. (2005) demonstrated that PCV2 induces apoptosis by activating caspases 8 and 3 in the spleens of infected mice [36] . Therefore, the impaired immune organs detected in the PCV2-inoculated control mice in our study might be attributable to the apoptosis induced by PCV2. Interestingly, the GSNO treatment improved growth performance and protected the immune organs (spleen and thymus) of the PCV2-inoculated mice. As we know, NO acts as a key molecule in inflammation and the immune response [37, 38] , so the NO-generating compound GSNO may play a critical role in the regulation of inflammation and immunity during PCV2 infection, as well as inhibiting PCV2 replication, in mice. More research is required to confirm this hypothesis.",
