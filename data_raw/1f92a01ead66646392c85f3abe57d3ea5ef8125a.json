As of October 2016, the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database contained >2 million viral genome sequences and a reference set of ~4000 viral genome sequences that cover a wide range of known viral families. Whole-genome sequences can be used to improve viral classification and provide insight into the viral \"tree of life\". However, due to the lack of evolutionary conservation amongst diverse viruses, it is not feasible to build a viral tree of life using traditional phylogenetic methods based on conserved proteins. In this study, we used an alignment-free method that uses k-mers as genomic features for a large-scale comparison of complete viral genomes available in RefSeq. To determine the optimal feature length, k (an essential step in constructing a meaningful dendrogram), we designed a comprehensive strategy that combines three approaches: (1) cumulative relative entropy, (2) average number of common features among genomes, and (3) the Shannon diversity index. This strategy was used to determine k for all 3,905 complete viral genomes in RefSeq. The resulting dendrogram shows consistency with the viral taxonomy of the ICTV and the Baltimore classification of viruses.",

This incongruence can have many causes, including tree-building errors, incomplete lineage sorting, hidden paralogy, and horizontal gene transfer. As early as 1996, inconsistent phylogenetic trees were obtained for viruses when using different numbers of isolates, or when different lengths of aligned sequences were used (as in a study of hepatitis C viruses 18 ).

For large-scale comparisons of genome-scale sequences, especially highly diverse ones, alignment-free methods of phylogeny construction have been increasingly used in the past few years 23-26 . There are two categories of alignment-free methods for phylogenomic analysis: one based on the statistics of word frequency, the other on Kolmogorov complexity and chaos theory 27 . The primary advantage of these methods is that they enable quick genome-scale comparisons with linear time complexity (O(n)) 28 more efficiently than minimum likelihood or Bayesian alignment methods with subquadratic time complexity (o(n 2 )). Another advantage of alignment-free methods is that they can be used to compare sequences from draft genomes, with information loss proportional to the number of discontinuities in a genome. However, alignment-free methods do not capture the nuances of evolutionary models that incorporate site-dependent substitution patterns. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret branch lengths of alignment-free based trees in terms of mutation rates, even though alignment-free trees constructed from whole-genome sequences capture taxonomic classification (which reflects the evolutionary history of organisms) better than 16 S rRNA alignment-based trees for prokaryotes 28 .",

In previous studies of dsDNA eukaryotic viruses 15,16,21 , the optimal feature length was based on cumulative relative entropy (CRE) and relative sequence divergence (RSD). For each individual genome and a value of k, the CRE (determined by a comparison of the observed FFP and the expected FFP from a second-order Markov model) captures how much information from the whole-genome sequence is encoded in the FFP. In other words, CRE indicates the power of the FFP to reconstruct the whole-genome sequence. Smaller CRE values, which result from longer k-mers, are indicative of the ability to better identify individual genomes. For a whole genome, the RSD for a value of k is a measure of the relatedness of the genome sequence (in terms of FFP) to a random sequence of the same length. According to Wu et al. 32 , the optimal value of k is the value when both CRE and RSD decrease to < 10% of their maximum values as k is increased.",

We show that CRE is significantly influenced by the genome size, as well as k-mer composition. Genomes of different sizes show different trend CRE curves. For small viral genomes (~3 kb), CRE values drop to zero around a k value of 6; for large viral genomes (1 Mb or more), the drop increases to a k value of 10. Consequently, CRE values for genomes of greatly varied sizes cannot simultaneously be decreased to < 10% of maximum values at the fixed-feature length as suggested by Wu et al. 32 . Therefore, we first grouped viral genomes by genomic size. For each group, we proposed the optimal k-mer length by considering several genomic features, including the CRE value, the number of k-mers shared by genomes, and the total number of k-mers observed, and then we constructed a dendrogram at its optimal k-mer length. Finally, we derived a procedure to decide the optimal feature length to compare all 3,905 complete viral genomes.

The distribution of genome sizes is depicted in the density plot in Fig. 1 . The long tail on the right shows some large genome sizes as outliers, such as Pandoraviruses, Megaviruses, Mimiviruses, and other giant viruses. It is worth mentioning that, after determining the CRE values as shown in Fig. 2 , we noted that the recommended range for k-mer length varies greatly depending on genome size, and therefore divided the dataset into four arbitrary subgroups (Q1-Q4) using the 25%, 50%, and 75% quartiles cutoff of 6,407; 12,141; and 45,242 bp; respectively. Assessment of the optimal feature length (k). Because the criteria used by Wu et al. 32 were not directly applicable to our large-scale virus dataset, due to the dependence of CRE on genome size, we determined the Scientific RepoRts | 7:40712 | DOI: 10 .1038/srep40712 optimal feature length based on three criteria: (1) from an individual genome perspective, using CRE to find the minimum feature length: where the genome curves reach zero CRE or fall to < 10% of their CRE maximum values; this CRE value was the original criterion for optimal feature lengths in previously published papers 31,32,39 ; (2) from a pairwise-comparison perspective, the average number of common features (ACF) among genomes was applied to determine the maximum feature length: the length prior to ACF dropping to a lower value; this ACF criterion is defined as the average number of common features when comparing pairwise to each of the other genomes at a specific feature length; (3) from an \"all-genomes comparison\" perspective, we measured commonness of k-mers among all genomes in our dataset in terms of the diversity index to narrow down the range of optimal feature length. The Shannon diversity index was used to quantify the diversity of commonness of k-mers using the fraction of k-mers shared by genomes. The preferred length is the one with a higher Shannon diversity index value (which represents more diversity in the commonness of k-mers) in the range suggested from criteria 1 and 2. When the three steps suggest multiple optimal lengths in the range, then the tree stability (based on Robinson-Foulds distance) is also considered supporting information (see Materials and Methods for more details).",

CRE curves did not simultaneously drop to < 10% of the maximum CRE value for all genomes, which is the selection criterion that Wu et al. 32 recommended. When curves for the smaller genomes achieve that goal, some curves for larger genomes are still at a plateau. At k = 9, the curves of small genomes start to fall < 10% of the maximum CRE, and ~50% of all CREs drop to < 20% of their maxima. At larger values of k (k = 10, 11, and 12), more genome CREs satisfy the < 10% of the maximum criterion. When k = 13, the CRE values of most genomes fall to < 10% of the maximum CREs. However, k = 13 cannot simply be chosen as the optimal feature length, because it might be too large (no information left) for small genomes.

Therefore, the optimal range for k is reduced to 9-11. These curves were also coloured by different genome sizes, as in subgroups Q1-Q4. As seen in the Fig. 3 , the ACFs are increased with an increased genome size. As we estimated, when k = 13, many of the features of small genomes (Q1 subgroup) are shared, which implies that we cannot consider only the CRE criterion to choose the optimal k.",

For this purpose, the Shannon diversity index was applied and plotted with different feature lengths (Fig. 6 ).

For the dendrogram of the 3,905 viral genomes, either 9 or 11 can be chosen as the optimal feature length. k = 10 has a lower ACF and Shannon diversity index, indicating a non-linear relationship in the dataset. When k = 9, CRE values have not yet dropped to < 10% of their maximum, and the other two criteria perform well. When k = 11, most of the CRE values have droped to < 10% of their maximum, although the ACF is not good for small viral genomes. In this case, it is hard to choose between 9 and 11, because neither can perfectly satisfy our three criteria. Therefore, it makes sense to check the tree stability and use it as supporting information for this study. To evaluate the tree stability, we calculated Robinson-Foulds distances between k (5, 6, 7\u2026 ) and k + 1 at different feature lengths. When the Robinson-Foulds distances drop to a low value, it means that the tree stability starts at this k point and the tree topology does not change much as feature lengths increase. As shown in Fig. 8 , the trees start to converge at k = 9; therefore, we will choose k = 9 as the optimal feature length for this dendrogram. Furthermore, because we want to obtain a global view of the relationship among RefSeq viral genomes, the \"pairwise comparison perspective\" and \"all genome comparison perspective\" are considered more important in this research than the exact estimation of individual genomes, especially when all sequences are RefSeq whole genomes (not as similar and sensitive). For dendrograms of the four subgroups Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4, the optimal feature lengths have been identified as k = 9, 10, 11, and 12, respectively.",

The alignment-free method with k-mers is useful for comparing genomes with low homology and has been applied to various microbial studies. However, it is still not clear how to find the optimal feature length of k-mers in alignment-free phylogenomic analysis, especially for large-scale comparison of viral genomes. CRE and RSD values have been used as criteria in previous studies 29, 31, 32, 39 , however, these studies used, at most, hundreds of genomes and their lengths did not change greatly. However, thousands of viral genomes in the NCBI RefSeq showed a great difference in size, which ranged from the smallest (Anguilla anguilla circovirus) at 1,378 nucleotides to the largest (Pandoravirus salinus) at 2,473,870 nucleotides. As a result, their CRE curves cannot simultaneously drop to < 10% of maximum as required in previous studies. Furthermore, CRE reflects the ability to identify individual whole genomes at various lengths of k. More details should be taken into consideration when dealing with such highly-diverse data, such as pairwise-comparison information and shared k-mers among all genomes. Hence, we divided our dataset into four subgroups by 25%, 50%, and 75% quantiles cut-off of genomic size.",

Detailed results of the statistical analysis are provided in Supplementary Table S2.Subgroup dendrograms. The dendrogram (k = 9) for the 976 RefSeq viral genomes in subgroup Q1 (genome size < 25%) is shown in SupplementaryFigure S5. ssDNA viruses comprise a majority of this dendrogram and most of them are clustered together to form a large clade (blue branches). This clade is separated by two main viral hosts: plants and animals. The other large clade of animal viruses is formed by two independent clusters of ssDNA and dsDNA. ssRNA(+ ), dsRNA, and RT viruses can also be observed. These three classes form independent small clades and then cluster with each other, likewise with grouping resulted by the host information. The orders of most viruses in subgroup Q1 are unclassified, except for some Tymovirales.SupplementaryFigure S7shows a dendrogram (k = 11) for the 977 RefSeq viral genomes in subgroup Q3 (genome size 50-75%). More than 60% are dsDNA viruses. They are clustered together in this dendrogram, and most of them are in the Caudovirales family and bacterial viruses, although some special cases are either archaea viruses in the Ligamenvirales family or unclassified animal viruses.
