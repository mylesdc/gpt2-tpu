            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is an enteric coronavirus causing high morbidity and mortality in porcine herds worldwide. Although both inactivated and live attenuated vaccines have been extensively used, the emergence of highly virulent strains and the recurrent outbreaks even in vaccinated farms highlight the need of effective vaccines. Engineering of genetically defined live attenuated vaccines is a rational approach for novel vaccine development. In this line, we engineered an attenuated virus based on the transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) genome, expressing a chimeric spike protein from a virulent United States (US) PEDV strain. This virus (rTGEV-RS-SPEDV) was attenuated in highly-sensitive five-day-old piglets, as infected animals did not lose weight and none of them died. In addition, the virus caused very minor tissue damage compared with a virulent virus. The rTGEV-RS-SPEDV vaccine candidate was also attenuated in three-week-old animals that were used to evaluate the protection conferred by this virus, compared with the protection induced by infection with a virulent PEDV US strain (PEDV-NVSL). The rTGEV-RS-SPEDV virus protected against challenge with a virulent PEDV strain, reducing challenge virus titers in jejunum and leading to undetectable challenge virus RNA levels in feces. The rTGEV-RS-SPEDV virus induced a humoral immune response specific for PEDV, including neutralizing antibodies. Altogether, the data indicated that rTGEV-RS-SPEDV is a promising vaccine candidate against virulent PEDV infection.",

            "text": "Acute infectious diarrhea is a major cause of high morbidity and mortality in piglets worldwide. Enteric infections in animals are frequently associated with viruses, including rotaviruses and coronaviruses (CoVs) [1] . A metagenomics analysis of diarrheic and healthy samples from China in 2012 found porcine CoVs in 77% of the diarrheic samples, and only in around 7% of the healthy samples, highlighting the potential relevance of CoVs as enteric porcine pathogens [2] . Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) was found in more than 50% of the diarrheic samples [2] , in agreement with the importance that this virus has for the porcine industry worldwide. PEDV was first described in Europe in the 1970s and the virus has, since then, remained endemic in the European porcine herds [3] . In Asian countries, PEDV was detected in the 1980s, with highly virulent outbreaks observed since Viruses 2019, 11, 682 3 of 18 in piglets. Subsequently, an attenuated chimeric vaccine candidate was developed by introducing duplication of transcription regulating sequences (TRSs), as previously described by our group [46] . This attenuated vaccine candidate conferred partial protection to pigs from a challenge with a virulent PEDV. ",

The C-terminus of the protein was that from the enteropathogenic TGEV SC11 virus [36] , including the transmembrane domain and C-terminus (aa 1389 to 1448). The chimeric protein was cloned in the TGEV infectious cDNA [30] , replacing TGEV S protein (rTGEV-SPEDV, Figure 1B ). In addition, chimeric SPEDV-TGEV protein was cloned in an infectious cDNA from an attenuated TGEV, which contained duplications of transcription regulating sequences (TRSs) and engineered unique restrictions sites (RS) to avoid the overlapping of consecutive genes [46] (rTGEV-RS-SPEDV, Figure 1C ). Recombinant viruses rTGEV-SPEDV and rTGEV-RS-SPEDV were recovered after transfection of Vero cells with the wild-type and attenuated cDNAs, respectively. These viruses required trypsin to efficiently infect Vero cells, and form syncytia, similarly to PEDV virus.

After 15 passages in cell culture, viral genome region comprising from 3b gene to 3 UTR (nucleotides 25856 to 28544) was sequenced.

No modifications were found in the parental rTGEV-SPEDV virus. In the rTGEV-RS-SPEDV virus, modifications were only detected in the engineered TRS duplicated sequences ( Figure 5 ). Small deletions and point mutations were found between E and M genes, eliminating the engineered FseI restriction site, but maintaining duplicated sequence ( Figure 5 ). Extensive deletion was observed between M and N genes, reverting the sequence to that of the wild-type virus ( Figure 5 ).

This data strongly suggests that the rTGEV-RS-SPEDV genome recovered from piglets may represent the in vivo evolution of the engineered virus. It is worth noting that TGEV attenuation was similar with the three TRSs duplications and with just the duplication between N and 7 genes [46] , suggesting that in vivo evolved rTGEV-RS-SPEDV virus may still be attenuated.

This data strongly suggests that the rTGEV-RS-SPEDV genome recovered from piglets may represent the in vivo evolution of the engineered virus. It is worth noting that TGEV attenuation was similar with the three TRSs duplications and with just the duplication between N and 7 genes [46] , suggesting that in vivo evolved rTGEV-RS-SPEDV virus may still be attenuated.

Pregnant sows are the most suitable models to evaluate the effect of PEDV vaccine candidates, as the target animals are neonatal piglets, and lactogenic immunity has an important role in protection [26] . Nevertheless, availability, cost, and housing resources limited its use in preliminary vaccine candidate trials [16, 18] , and a young pig model has been proposed for preliminary vaccine efficacy trials [13, 16] . Therefore, to evaluate the protection conferred by rTGEV-RS-SPEDV virus, 21-day-old pigs were used.

Twenty-one days after vaccination, animals from G1, G2, and G3 were challenged with a virulent recombinant PEDV strain (rPEDV) ( Table 1) . As expected, due to the animal age, no clinical sings of enteric disease such as diarrhea, vomiting, or dehydration were observed after vaccination or challenge (data not shown). Nevertheless, animals vaccinated with the virulent PEDV-NVSL strain showed a delay in weight gain the first week after vaccination, compared with non-infected animals or those vaccinated with rTGEV-RS-SPEDV virus ( Figure 6 ).

After challenge at 28 and 31 dpv, PEDV total antibodies increased in all challenged groups, as expected. Interestingly, the increase was slower in the vaccinated pigs, in agreement with a decreased challenge virus replication in these animals. Total anti-TGEV antibodies were also evaluated by ELISA. All animals were seronegative at the time of vaccination. When challenge was performed, the level of TGEV antibodies was not significant in any group, and the all the animals remained seronegative after PEDV challenge. This result was expected, as S protein is the main inducer of antibodies against TGEV and it was not present in any of the viruses used for vaccination or challenge. In addition, it has been shown that there is no cross-reactivity between TGEV and PEDV [58] . To further analyze the humoral response specific for PEDV, the levels of PEDV-specific IgGs ( Figure 8B ) and IgAs ( Figure 8C ) were evaluated. The data were similar to those obtained for total anti-PEDV antibodies. It has been demonstrated that protection against PEDV infection correlates with IgA levels [21, 44, 59, 60] . It is worth noting that IgA levels in the sera of vaccinated animals, after challenge, were significantly reduced compared with non-vaccinated animals ( Figure 8C ), strongly suggesting that challenge virus did not elicit a potent IgA response in the gut of vaccinated animals, most likely due to reduced replication in the enteric tract, correlating with protection.",

            "text": "Recently, a swine enteric coronavirus (SeCoV) that is a recombinant between TGEV and PEDV has been described in Europe [67] [68] [69] . The SeCoV contains a genome background identical to TGEV, but expresses the S protein from PEDV. In addition, recombination led to extensive deletions in the coding sequence and in TRS of TGEV gene 3a, and, as a consequence, protein 3a may not be expressed by SeCoV. It is worth noting that SeCoV was isolated from diarrheic samples in all cases, suggesting that it is virulent. The engineered parental rTGEV-SPEDV virus resembles the recombinant SeCoV and, as shown by our data, is virulent in suckling piglets. In contrast, the engineered virus (rTGEV-RS-SPEDV) used as a vaccine candidate was attenuated. There are some genetic differences that may eventually allow the discrimination between SeCoV and the rTGEV-RS-SPEDV vaccine candidate as (i) rTGEV-RS-SPEDV virus did not contain the full PEDV S gene sequence, (ii) it expressed TGEV protein 3a, and (iii) because of the TGEV strain used to engineer the infectious cDNA, it did not express TGEV protein 3b [70] .",
