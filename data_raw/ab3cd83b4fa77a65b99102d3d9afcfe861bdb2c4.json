Effective prediction of specificity and inclusivity from multiplexed primers and TaqMan\u00ae/ Luminex\u00ae probes is a critical step in PCR design. Results: Code is described to identify all primer and probe combinations from a list of unpaired, unordered candidates that should produce a product. It predicts and extracts all amplicon sequences in a large sequence database from a list of primers and probes, allowing degenerate bases and user-specified levels of primer-target mismatch tolerance. Amplicons hit by TaqMan\u00ae/Luminex\u00ae probes are indicated, and products may be annotated with gene information from NCBI. Fragment length distributions are calculated to predict electrophoretic gel banding patterns.",

To predict desired reactions with target and undesired cross reactions, simulate_PCR software is described to calculate the possible primer pairings and products of PCR (primer only) or primer + probe triplet reactions (as in TaqMan\u00ae or Luminex\u00ae) in either single-plex or complex multiplex reactions, as compared to a large sequence database. We use it daily for applications in molecular diagnostic signature development and erosion analysis (i.e. checking robustness of PCR-based signatures in the face of new sequence data), and have used it in the process of developing primer panels with more than 1000 primers for target enrichment prior to sequencing.",

            "text": "Other tools to simulate PCR exist, like NCBI Primer-BLAST [6] , FastPCR [7] , and csPCR [8] . They are excellent for low throughput analyses where manual inspection and a graphical user interface (GUI) is desired, and they offer a number of very useful features not offered by simula-te_PCR, such as primer design, and primer T m , secondary structure and primer-dimer prediction. However, when the goal is prediction of target and off-target amplification and probe binding as part of an automated pipeline, with optional amplicon sequence extraction and gene annotation, simulate_PCR provides a unique capability. For example, if a long list of primer candidates has been designed with desired thermodynamic or taxonomically specific characteristics, it can be a chore to identify the best pairings if one has to check all possible pairwise combinations using a tool that considers only one single-plex primer pair at a time to predict products, as with the web tool Primer-BLAST. Another tool, FastPCR claims multiplex capabilities, but unfortunately this capability only applies to primer design (e.g. avoiding primer dimers) but not to amplicon prediction from mixtures of more than 2 primers in the same reaction. Moreover, it is not freely available except as a trial version for Windows and it must be run from a GUI, making it unfeasible for large scale unix/linux applications. The csPCR program does predict amplicons from multiplexed primers, but it must be run from a GUI, suitable for one-off analyses by nonprogrammers, but presenting a problem for high throughput automated pipelines. MFEprimer2.0 has a command line version and can take a batch of primers with unspecified pairings, but requires a large amount of memory so that most users will not have sufficient RAM to compare to the NCBI nt database. When we tried several examples on the MFEprimer2.0 website, which simulate_PCR ran in a few seconds, they never finished after several hours, although this could also have been a web server issue on the days we tried. In summary, none of the currently available PCR target prediction tools have the capability to consider primer + probe triplet reactions, none extract entire amplicon sequences, instead reporting only the positions of primer matches, none annotate gene information that overlaps the amplicons, none handle large numbers of unpaired, multiplex, degenerate primers compared to large sequence databases, and most cannot be run as part of an automated pipeline without a GUI or web interface. Thus, simulate_PCR addresses an unmet need to aid in the design and assessment of PCR-based molecular diagnostic signatures.",

This should be as least twice as high as the expected number of sequences targeted, and can be much higher if signature components are highly conserved.

            "text": "A simple script called simulate_PCR is described to identify combinations of primer pairs and primer/probe triplets that detect database sequences, rank the pairs and triplets by the number of sequences they detect, extract amplicon sequences and gene annotations, and predict fragment length distributions from the multiplex. Degenerate bases are allowed, as are a user-specified number of mismatches between triplet components and database sequences. The tool allows a user to specify desired primer pairings, or with the \"mux\" setting it checks all combinations of primers and probes. This enables a user to input an unordered, unpaired list of candidate forward and reverse primers and probes and let the results guide which pairings achieve the desired specificity. Simulate_PCR is a command line script, so can be run as part of a pipeline where a GUI is not suitable. Our group has used this tool to predict products from multiplexed sets with thousands of primers compared against large sequence databases of all available whole finished and draft microbial genomes (75 GB) and against nt. Extracting a FASTA file of the amplicon sequences is convenient when analyzing high throughput sequencing data that has undergone target enrichment. For example, running simulate_PCR on an AmpliSeq\u2122 primer pool with thousands of primers provides an ideal FASTA database for read mapping the resulting sequence data. Some changes to alter the sensitivity/speed tradeoff of simulate_PCR could include swapping out blastn with a short read mapper to improve speed, or with more sensitive alignment such as FASTA [13] or Smith-Waterman, at the cost of slower speed. Using a k-mer index algorithm to find primer binding sites could improve speed and sensitivity, but requires large amounts of RAM for large sequence databases. This is the technique used by MFEprimer, which requires 12 GB RAM for a 3 GB human genome database [14] , implying that larger databases like nt or a 75 GB microbial genome database would not be feasible with the RAM available to most users. However, we have tuned the default blastn parameters in simulate_PCR to maximize sensitivity, and found that with the threaded option it performs very fast for situations with up to several thousand primers and probes. Command line options can be adjusted to balance tradeoffs of sensitivity versus speed. BLAST heuristics may fail to report all matches to short oligos if degenerate bases break matches below the word length of 4, which is only a problem with large numbers of degenerate or mismatching bases. In this case, one could replace degenerate primers with the expanded variant combinations to improve sensitivity at the expense of speed.",

The advantage of blastdbcmd is that it allows one to extract amplicon sequences from a precompiled blast database (e.g. nt) without the extremely large FASTA input file from which the BLAST database was created. The original FASTA data may not even be available if only the precompiled nt blast database was downloaded from NCBI.",
