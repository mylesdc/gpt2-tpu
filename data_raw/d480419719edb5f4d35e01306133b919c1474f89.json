            "text": "It is an emerging orthopoxvirus zoonosis in the tropical rain forest of Africa and is endemic in the Congo-basin and sporadic in West Africa; it remains a tropical neglected disease of persons in impoverished rural areas. Interaction of the human population with wildlife increases human infection with MPX virus (MPXV), and infection from human to human is possible. Smallpox vaccination provides good cross-protection against MPX; however, the vaccination campaign ended in Africa in 1980, meaning that a large proportion of the population is currently unprotected against MPXV infection. Disease control hinges on deterring zoonotic exposure to the virus and, barring that, interrupting person-to-person spread. However, there are no FDA-approved therapies against MPX, and current vaccines are limited due to safety concerns. For this reason, new studies on pathogenesis, prophylaxis and therapeutics are still of great interest, not only for the scientific community but also for the governments concerned that MPXV could be used as a bioterror agent. In the present study, a new vaccination strategy approach based on three recombinant bovine herpesvirus 4 (BoHV-4) vectors, each expressing different MPXV glycoproteins, A29L, M1R and B6R were investigated in terms of protection from a lethal MPXV challenge in STAT1 knockout mice. BoHV-4-A-CMV-A29LgD 106 \u0394TK, BoHV-4-A-EF1\u03b1-M1RgD 106 \u0394TK and BoHV-4-A-EF1\u03b1-B6RgD 106 \u0394TK were successfully constructed by recombineering, and their capacity to express their transgene was demonstrated. A small challenge study was performed, and all three recombinant BoHV-4 appeared safe (no weightloss or obvious adverse events) following intraperitoneal administration. Further, BoHV-4-A-EF1\u03b1-M1RgD 106 \u0394TK alone or in combination with BoHV-4-A-CMV-A29LgD 106 \u0394TK and BoHV-4-A-EF1\u03b1-B6RgD 106 \u0394TK, was shown to be able to protect, 100% alone and 80% in combination, STAT1 (-/-) mice against mortality and morbidity. This work demonstrated the efficacy of BoHV-4 based vectors and the use of BoHV-4 as a vaccine-vector platform.",

            "text": "Monkeypox virus (MPXV) is an orthopoxvirus with a broad-host range capable of infecting many animal species [1] . In humans, MPXV causes a disease very similar to the closely related variola virus, the etiological agent of smallpox: a rash (a 2-4 week period where macules develop and form papules, vesicles and pustules) which is preceded by a 10-14 day incubation, followed by a 1-3 day interval characterized by a prodromal fever, malaise and severe lymphadenopathy of the neck, inguinal and axillary regions [2] [3] [4] . The more virulent strains of MPXV (from the Congo Basin region) can induce mortality rates of~10% [5] [6] [7] [8] . The main clinical difference between human MPX and smallpox is the presentation of lymphadenopathy in the former [9, 10] . MPXV is endemic to Central and West Africa with increasing numbers of human infections being reported. In 2003, the transmissibility of MPXV became acutely obvious when an outbreak occurred in the United States and MPXV was transmitted to humans from prairie dogs [11, 12] . The global vaccination campaign that eradicated smallpox utilized vaccines that are also efficacious against MPXV and was successful because there is no animal reservoir for variola [13] . Indeed, prior to the eradication of smallpox, the existence of MPXV was unknown and it is likely that many cases of human MPX were reported as smallpox. Cases of human MPX are increasing in Africa, this may be due to several factors: 1) increasing interactions between humans and infected animals through environmental degradation; 2) the cessation of routine vaccination against smallpox; 3) an increase in human susceptibility to the virus; 4) an increase in animal-human and human-human transmissibility of the virus; and 5) adaption of the virus to new host species that co-exist in, or close to, human geographical regions [2, [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . The high mortality rate and morbidity rate of MPXV in humans makes it an important emerging disease for study. To date, no antiviral has been FDA-approved for the treatment of human MPX. Vaccines against smallpox have demonstrated good protection against MPXV in animal models and anecdotally in humans [1] ; however, most first-and second-generation smallpox vaccines are associated with at least some level of morbidity and a large proportion of the population are contraindicated to vaccination [19] . Third-generation vaccines, such as MVA, have been shown to be safer in non-human primates but require 2",

The TK BoHV-4-A genome locus was utilized as the integration site for the CMV-A29LgD 106 , EF1\u03b1-M1RgD 106 and EF1\u03b1-B6RgD 106 expression cassettes. The BoHV-4 TK genomic region is strongly conserved among BoHV-4 isolates [47] , ensuring the stability of the genomic locus from potential recombination when foreign DNA sequences are inserted in. Indeed, the BoHV-4 TK genomic locus has been interrupted by the insertion of foreign DNA sequences of different size, without interfering with viral replication in vitro and loss of heterologous protein expression [25,27-29,31,32,34]. CMV-A29LgD 106 , EF1\u03b1-M1RgD 106 and EF1\u03b1-B6RgD 106 expression cassettes were first sub-cloned into pINT2, a shuttle vector plasmid containing 2 BoHV-4 TK sequences [25] , to generate pTK-CMV-A29LgD 106 -TK, pTK-EF1\u03b1-M1RgD 106 -TK and pTK-EF1\u03b1-B6RgD 106 -TK targeting vectors.

The only difference was that the recombinant viruses reconstituted from electroporated BEKcre resulted in depletion of the BAC plasmid backbone containing the GFP expression cassette, as shown by the loss of GFP expression (Fig 3A, 3E and 3H ). Because the time necessary to reconstitute the viable recombinant BoHV-4s was different among them, it was of interest to know if the foreign antigens, encoded by the expression cassette integrated into the viral genome, could have a detrimental effect on the viral replication. Therefore, the growth characteristics of BoHV-4-A-CMV-A29LgD 106 \u0394TK, BoHV-4-A-EF1\u03b1-M1RgD 106 \u0394TK and BoHV-4-A-EF1\u03b1-B6RgD 106 \u0394TK were compared with that of the parental virus, BoHV-4-A.

Several murine strains have been developed as models of MPXV, in this study we utilized the 129 stat1 -/strain. Thirteen cages were prepared with 5 mice/cage ( Table 2) . Cages 1 and 2 were un-vaccinated. Cage 3 was vaccinated with vehicle (DMEM without FBS). Cages 4 and 5 were vaccinated with MVA where cage 4 received a primary injection of vaccine at T = 0 days and a vehicle booster at T = 23 days, and cage 5 Cages 12 and 13 were also vaccinated following the above regimen; however, these mice received a combination (combo) of the 3 BoHV-4 vectors. BoHV-4 vectors were injected IP in a total volume of 0.3 ml. There was no apparent morbidity-as measured visually-or weightloss recorded in any of the mice (S2 Fig). At T = 50 days, mice in cages 2-13 were challenged with 2x10 5 PFU/mouse of MPXV. Mortality rates are shown in Fig 4. As expected, the MVA vaccinated mice in cages 4 (MVA/ Veh) and 5 (MVA/MVA) were 100% protected against challenge. Mice in cage 9 (M1R/M1R) were also 100% protected (P = 0.004); and although mice in cage 13 (Combo/Combo) experienced 1 death, they were still 80% protected against the MPXV challenge (P = 0.02). When comparing weight-change (Fig 5) , we found that mice in cage 5 (MVA/MVA) did not lose weight compared to the PBS control (cage 1) and that mice in cage 4 (MVA/Veh) only lost weight (5%) on days 6, 7 and 8 post challenge. We also found that mice in cages 10 (B6R/ Veh), 11 (B6R/B6R), 12 (Combo/Veh), and 13 (Combo/Combo) had significantly reduced weight-loss from day 8 post challenge (15%, 15%, 11%, and 15% on day 8, respectively), even though mice in cage 13 were 80% protected against the challenge. Some protection from weight-loss was also afforded to mice in cages 8 (M1R/veh) and 9 (M1R/M1R) on days 13, 14 and 15 post challenge (15%).",

This study demonstrated protection in the STAT1 -/model and consideration should be given to also evaluating the vectors in CAST/EiJ mice which have also been established as a murine model of monkeypox [49, 50] . Ultimately, this study could pave the way for further studies in other animal models such as prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus) [51] [52] [53] , the 13-lined ground squirrel (Spermophilus tridecemlineatus) [54, 55] and non-human primates (reviewed in [1] )-all of which have been extensively used as models of human monkeypox-and ultimately in human protection studies. In fact, since MPXV also infects humans and causes clinical-signs very similar to smallpox, it is classified as a category A select agent [56] . Primarily for ethical but also for cost reasons, C57BL/6 STAT1 knockout mice (STAT1 (-/-) ) were chosen as an in vivo model before progressing to gene delivery and immunogenicity studies in non-human primates. STAT1 (-/-) miceare highly sensitive to MPXV and the disease course in MPXV infected STAT1 (-/-) mice, characterized by weight loss and death by day 10 post infection-is similar to that observed in wild-type mice infected with mousepox/ectromelia virus (ECTV), the etiology agent of mousepox-and probably the best small animal model of smallpox [35, 57] . Moreover it was revealed that antiviral therapy could protect mice to a degree similar to that of vaccination with Dryvax or MVA, supporting the use of STAT1 (-/-) mice as a reliable model to evaluate orthopoxvirus prophylactics and therapeutics [35] . STAT1 (-/-) mice were found to be sensitive to a wide number of pathogens due to the loss of STAT1, a key factor responsible for type 1 and 2 interferon (IFN) signaling [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] [63] . BoHV-4-based vectors in wild type and immunocompromised mice behave as replicating incompetent viral vectors, showing absence of pathogenicity [31,32, [64] [65] [66] and BoHV-4 replication is strongly impaired in vitro after the treatment of BoHV-4 infected cells with IFN\u03b3 [67] . Considering that IFN-\u03b3 is an activator of STAT1, the potential pathogenicity of BoHV-4-based vectors in STAT1 (-/-) mice was a concern. However, intra peritoneal BoHV-4 inoculated STAT1 (-/-) mice did not show any overt clinical sign, detrimental effect or pathology correlated to challenge.",

A27L is a 14 kDa protein thought to be involved in VV entry events [68] . L1R is a 23-29 kDa myristoylated surface protein involved in a yet-to-be-identified post viral attachment and pre-fusion events [69] . Whereas B5R is a 42 kDa glycoprotein found on the surface of the virus [70, 71] and is involved in cell surface glycosaminoglycan-mediated disruption of the viral outer membrane [72] . Further, they were shown to be able to elicit a protective immune response in mice and non-human primates when formulated in combination as a subunit vaccine consisted of purified proteins, plasmid DNA vaccines, recombinant adenovirus and alphavirus replicons [73] [74] [75] [76] [77] [78] [79] . Since the purpose of this study was to determine the capability of BoHV-4-based viral vectors to protect STAT1 (-/-) mice against a lethal MPXV infection, the first concern was the generation of optimized expression cassettes to be integrated into the BAC-BoHV-4-A genome that were able to efficiently express A29L, M1R and B6R antigens. Because no antibodies are available for A29L, M1R and B6R proteins, a short in-frame sequence coding for a tag peptide (gD 106 ) was provided at the 3 0 end of their ORFs and this allowed their expression to be monitored by western immunoblotting. Initially A29L, M1R and B6R tagged ORFs were customized under the transcriptional control of the CMV promoter; however, the only ORF to be efficiently expressed was A29L. For this reason, the CMV promoter of the M1R and B6R expression cassette was substituted with the human EF1\u03b1 promoter which induced expression. The reason why the CMV promoter did not work with the ORFs of M1R and B6R has not been determined. Another interesting observation was the presence of A29L protein into the supernatant of the transfected cells despite the absence of a canonical signal peptide within the primary sequence of the protein as deduced by different signal peptide prediction software (http://www.csbio.sjtu.edu.cn/bioinf/Signal-3L/; http:// www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/; http://phobius.sbc.su.se/) [80, 81] . In fact, the A29L protein analysis by SecretomeP (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SecretomeP), a sequence based method for the prediction of mammalian secretory proteins targeted to the non-classical secretory pathway, included A29L within the group of non-classical secreted proteins like fibroblast growth factors, some interleukins and galectins.",

Bovine herpesvirus 4 (BoHV-4) has been most consistently associated with uterine disease in postpartum cattle and BoHV-4 infection is often identified concurrently with bacteria that cause uterine diseases [82, 83] . The association between BoHV-4 infection and uterine disease has been difficult to establish. It was suggested that there may be an association with bacterial endometritis which leads to secretion of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and then stimulation of viral replication by PGE2, TNF-\u03b1 and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-which causes further endometrial tissue damage and inflammation [84] [85] [86] . For this reason, a putative non-pathogenic strain of BoHV-4 (BoHV-4-A) isolated from the cell milk fraction of a healthy cow whose genome was cloned as a bacterial artificial chromosome (pBAC-BoHV-4-A) [28] was used. CMV-A29LgD 106 , EF1\u03b1-M1RgD 106 and EF1\u03b1-B6RgD 106 were integrated into the TK locus of pBAC-BoHV-4-A, and proved to be stable through passages in E. coli SW102 and recombinant viable BoHV-4-A-CMV-A29LgD 106 \u0394TK, BoHV-4-A-EF1\u03b1-M1RgD 106 \u0394TK, BoHV-4-A-EF1\u03b1-B6RgD 106 \u0394TK were successfully reconstituted in BEKcre cells. When BoHV-4-A-CMV-A29LgD 106 \u0394TK, BoHV-4-A-EF1\u03b1-M1RgD 106 \u0394TK and BoHV-4-A-EF1\u03b1-B6RgD 106 \u0394TK were characterized in terms of replication kinetics, a reduction of replication was observed for BoHV-4-A-EF1\u03b1-B6RgD 106 \u0394TK and this was attributed to a partial toxic effect induced by the abundant expression of B6RgD 106 -which was also observed in transfections of cells with EF1\u03b1-B6RgD 106 expression cassette. This latter observation excluded a potential detrimental effect induced by the topological location of the foreign DNA in the BoHV-4 genome. Despite their replication characteristics, all three recombinant BoHV-4s abundantly expressed their transgene in infected cells.",

One hundred % protection was achieved when the vectors were administered twice (prime followed by booster), although the M1R expression vector was not superior to vaccination with MVA as measured by weight-loss. Protection was also afforded to mice when the vectors were administered in combination (combo) as a prime and booster. These mice experienced less weight-loss than mice vaccinated with M1R alone. This finding is surprising as the other vectors included in the combo were not protective when administered individually, although we did find protection against weight-loss when mice were treated with B6R alone. Nevertheless, our studies reveal that protection can be afforded even when a small number of mice are used. Further studies should be considered that increase the dose of vector administered to the mice. Also, since the combination of all 3 vectors gave 80% protection against mortality and morbidity, various vector permutations should be considered to elucidate the most efficacious combination and ratio of vectors.",

Although second generation live vaccines, such as ACAM2000, provide the most robust immune response, they are quite reactogenic and induce some level of morbidity in all vaccines. Furthermore, a significant portion of the human population are contraindicated to vaccination with first-and second-generation vaccines [19] . MVA is a non-replicating vaccine that has demonstrated efficacy in many animal trials. The main draw-back to MVA is its relatively low immunogenicity, meaning that booster administrations are usually required for 100% protection against morbidity and mortality [87, 88] . Future studies could reveal that vectors' studied here could be used as alternatives to MVA.",

Our studies utilized STAT1 (-/-) mice; however, other strains have demonstrated sensitivity to MPXV, namely the CASTE/EiJ strain [49, 50, 89] . Future studies should consider evaluating the protection of these vectors in this strain also. This work provides a \"proof-of-concept\" for the BoHV-4-based vector as a potential vaccine for category A agents. Future and ongoing studies are focused on the design of BoHV-4-based vectors expressing antigens from other category A pathogens, as well as an assessment of protection in non-human primate. ",
