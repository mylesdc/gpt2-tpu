Proper treatment, however, depends on correct identification of the pathogen involved as antibiotics provide little or no benefit with viral infections. Here we describe a rapid and sensitive genotyping assay and microarray for URI identification using standard amplification and hybridization techniques, with electrochemical detection (ECD) on a semiconductor-based oligonucleotide microarray. The assay was developed to detect four bacterial pathogens (Bordetella pertussis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae) and 9 viral pathogens (adenovirus 4, coronavirus OC43, 229E and HK, influenza A and B, parainfluinza types 1, 2, and 3 and respiratory syncytial virus. This new platform forms the basis for a fully automated diagnostics system that is very flexible and can be customized to suit different or additional pathogens. Multiple probes on a flexible platform allow one to test probes empirically and then select highly reactive probes for further iterative evaluation. Because ECD uses an enzymatic reaction to create electrical signals that can be read directly from the array, there is no need for image analysis or for expensive and delicate optical scanning equipment. We show assay sensitivity and specificity that are excellent for a multiplexed format.",

Clinical symptoms of URI are highly variable and cannot be used to identify the etiologic agent or agents. Although the majority of URI are caused by viruses (69%; [3] ), antibiotics are widely prescribed to treat symptoms. Antibiotics, which are of little or no benefit for viral infections, can contribute to the emergence and spread of resistant bacteria and to higher costs for health care [4, 5, 6] .",

Many rapid serological tests are not sensitive or specific enough to detect all infections. Enzyme immunoassays (EIA) generally show sensitivities of 85% and direct immunofluorescence (DIF) assays show sensitivities of approximately 60 to 80% [7] . Although viral culture is generally accepted as the gold standard for diagnosis, PCR can be more sensitive [8] . In one study, rhinovirus culture detected infection in 40% of patients while rhinovirus PCR detected infection in 51.5% of patients [3] . Similarly, an influenza virus surveillance study showed that 18% of samples were positive by culture and 28% were positive by TaqMan-PCR [9] .",

Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is widely used for identifying virus and bacteria; however, a positive amplification is often verified by subsequent procedures that provide sequence information [8, 23, 24] . By using multiple probes against a single pathogen coupled with the proper amplification scheme, microarrays can serve as valuable tools for viral discovery, detection, genotyping and sequencing [13, 14, 21, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33] .",

The majority of these approaches do not provide sequence information, utilize expensive equipment that cannot be easily transported, require a high level of expertise to operate equipment, require extended periods of time, or are not easily modified. Here we describe a rapid and sensitive genotyping assay and array for upper respiratory pathogen identification using standard amplification and hybridization techniques and electrochemical detection (ECD) on a semiconductor-based oligonucleotide microarray. This platform was particularly suitable for developing this assay because it supports custom probe synthesis, which permits oligonucleotides of interest to be tested empirically. Multiple, highly reactive probes that are specific for a particular organism can then be put on the array for further iterative evaluation. Content of the final assay can also be customized to suit diagnostic needs in different geographic areas. Finally, the ability to use electrochemical detection with semiconductor microchips eliminates the need for expensive and delicate optical scanning equipment [34, 35, 36] . Scanning of microarrays is typically labor intensive and a significant source of system noise that complicates the use of microarrays significantly; and has hampered the transition of these technologies into high throughput clinical scenarios by adding undue instrumentation cost and complexity. The ECD method of deriving signal from a microarray is extremely simple and provides a clear path to making microarray processing truly hands off throughout the entire process.",

The assumption for this methodology is that enough unique probes will produce specific signal in the presence of the labeled PCR products to result in a positive call.

Microarray technologies can provide a significant amount of information at disparate loci in a highly redundant fashion that is helpful when discriminating between similar or different organisms or compensate for cases where genomic variation can result in false negative signals. In this array design, probes were developed to be species and sub-species-specific and then crosschecked against databases to minimize the possibility of cross-hybridization of target with other probes or with contaminating host NA. Multiple probes per pathogen (approximately 30 to 100) were used to overcome potential variability in pathogen genomes and also to provide sequence information at disparate loci. PCR primers were designed to flank the conserved regions that contained multiple complementary probe sequences. They also were designed such that the one-tube RT-PCR reaction produced biotin-labeled, single-strand target for hybridization to arrays. Decreasing the number of primer pairs per multiplex RT-PCR also increased assay sensitivity. Greatest sensitivity was achieved with one primer pair per genome of interest.",

In addition, this type of microarray can easily be subdivided into multiple sub-arrays; e.g., 4 sectors of 2240 electrode features per array, which allows multiple assays on one array and provides significant cost savings. Also, because of the platform's flexibility, the array content and primer pools can easily be changed to reflect the needs of clinicians in different localities and different seasons. The high manufacturability of semiconductors and their adaptability to inexpensive electrochemical microarray readers, which are small and field deployable, make these assays much more powerful than simple Real Time-PCR systems. In essence, the array provides a much higher level of confidence in a result akin to DNA sequencing; and, in addition, upfront bioinformatics and judicious choice of probes and loci allow a greatly simplified and speedier analysis of complex organisms or mixtures thereof. Ghindilis et al. [35] have described electrochemical detection and the application of this technology on the CombiMatrix array platform. This platform is able to provide very similar sensitivity and reproducibility to state of the art fluorescent detection. Their analysis of data correlation between the electrochemical detection and standard fluorescent detection techniques demonstrated that the array-to-array correlation for both detection techniques is very high with an average correlation coefficient of 0.94 [35] .",

            "text": "Disadvantages to using PCR for amplification are the possibility of contaminating reactions with amplicons from previous assays and amplifying genetic material from potential pathogens that are part of the normal flora. We are addressing amplicon contamination by developing a cartridge format for amplification, labeling, and hybridization of target. This cartridge contains the amplicons and is disposed of after analysis [36] . With respect to amplifying genetic material from pathogens that are part of the normal flora, PCR amplification is highly sensitive and is only qualitative at best. Therefore, the assay may (as with any standard bacteriological test) report the presence of pathogens in the absence of establishing a direct correlation with disease. As reported by Konno et al. [42] , the flora of a healthy individual can contain pathogenic species (e.g., S. pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis). They detected these organisms in a group of healthy 0 to 6 year olds at approximately the same rate as in patients with acute upper respiratory infections. These organisms were also found in older Table 2 .

Clinicians must therefore verify the results of highly sensitive assays with patient symptoms that would suggest a bacterial infection. The inclusion of bacterial genetic markers for antibiotic resistance or virulence in microarray assays would also help guide the clinician in establishing an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment regimen. Rapid identification of upper respiratory pathogens will significantly decrease the time and cost for the identification of potential lethal virus and bacterial strains and lead to better treatment and management of infections. Microarray and biosensor technologies show great promise for virus and bacteria detection and genotyping and are needed for rapid effective treatment, environmental monitoring and the detection of bioterrorism agents [22, 29] . Advances in microarray processing and simpler detection described here provide a path to migration of microarray technologies to clinical applications. ",

Dr. Wanda Lyon provided nucleic acid (NA) for additional samples, including Influenza A, Bordetella pertussis, and Streptococcus pyogenes. Viral RNA was extracted from clinical samples and archived cultures with an RNAeasy kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) or from active cultures (ATCC, Manassas, VA) with Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) following the manufacturer's protocol and precipitated with ethanol and sodium acetate (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) in the presence of yeast tRNA (Invitrogen) and glycogen (Ambion, Foster City, CA). Genomic DNA from bacterial cultures was isolated with Qiagen DNeasy columns. Chlamydia pneumoniae DNA was isolated by resuspending the culture pellet in 475 ml Tris-EDTA, adding 25 ml 10% SDS (Sigma) and 2 ml or 20 mg/ml proteinase K (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) and incubating over night at 37uC. After heat inactivation at 70uC for 20 min, DNA was extracted once with phenyl/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1; Sigma), twice with chloroform (Sigma), and precipitated with 3M sodium acetate and ethanol. Concentrations of RNA and DNA were measured with a NanoDrop ND-1000 Spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE). Positive control Arabidopsis DNA (RCA at 1 ng/ml) and RNA (CAP at 1 ng/ml) for RT-PCR reaction verification was obtained from Invitrogen (SpotReport-3 Array Validation System). Positive control RNA and DNA were diluted (1:20) in a solution of 20 ml yeast tRNA (1 mg/ml; Invitrogen) and 4.8 ml BSA (10 mg/ml; New England Biolabs) in 475.2 ml 10 mM Tris pH 7.4 (dilution buffer) (Sigma).",
