Performance measures may detect changes in physical function that self-report measures do not. Using the WOMAC physical function subscale, SF-36 physical function and role-physical subscales, stair ascent cycle duration, gait speed over 10 meters and the six-minute walk test, Parent and Moffet [7] assessed patients after TKA, preoperatively and at 2 and 4 months postoperatively. At 2 months, the WOMAC physical function subscale and SF-36 physical function domain demonstrated significant improvement compared to patients' preoperative values whereas the locomotor tests were comparable to their preoperative values or significantly less (sixminute walk distance). Previous studies by the authors have similarly noted that the physical function subscale of the WOMAC has failed to detect changes in physical function that were evident with performance assessment [13, 14] . The results of these studies suggest that self-report measures comment more on a patient's experience of moving around whereas performance specific measures may better represent the ability to move around.",

Because of the paucity of longitudinal studies evaluating the early time course of physical functional change at frequent intervals, the purpose of the current study was to characterize early recovery using a combination of selfreport and physical performance measures in patients following THA and TKA. The analytic approach of hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) was chosen as it provides a flexible technique for dealing with longitudinal data [17, 18] . Using HLM, the specific purposes of the study were to model recovery curves for the Lower Extremity Function Scale (LEFS), the physical function subscale of the WOMAC (WOMAC PF), the 6-minute walk test (6 MWT), the timed up and go test (TUG) and a timed stair test (ST) and to compare differences in their patterns of recovery. The models provide the scores and rate of change of the scores for the outcome measure of interest. Clinicians, researchers, and perhaps even health policy makers, can apply this information to make decisions concerning the optimal assessment intervals and to predict recovery post arthroplasty.",

In terms of SARS, on March 26 th , 2003 SARS was declared a provincial (Ontario) emergency. At the height of the outbreak, thousands of people, mostly in the Toronto area were quarantined for 10 day periods and there were significant restrictions on patient related activities in hospitals.

In each of these models, site of arthroplasty was a significant predictor of the one week scores with the patients post TKA initially demonstrating higher function. However, a significant interaction (in Figures 1, 2, 3 , demonstrated at the point at which the lines cross) was observed between the rate of change, weeks after surgery and site of arthroplasty with the patients post THA surpassing the function of the patients post TKA between 9 to 11 weeks. Figure 2 also demonstrates a ceiling effect (lower scores are better) for the TUG measure around nine to ten weeks. Unlike the performance measures, similar patterns of recovery are observed for the participants post THA and TKA with respect to the recovery figures for the WOMAC physical function scores ( Figure 4 ) and the LEFS ( Figure 5) . Table 3 provides a summary of the significant fixed effects and random effects for the models with specific model Tables 4 and 5 . A more detailed examination of the findings with respect to the predictor variables is published elsewhere [39] . In most models, the only significant random effect was the intercept indicating that individuals varied in their starting points one week after surgery; however, their slopes and quadratic component of time were similar. The LEFS model was the exception with both the intercept and slope significant. To understand how the standard deviations of the intercepts give an indication of between-patient differences in functioning, consider the results for the 6 MWT reported in To further clarify the interpretation of the interaction terms as estimates of the effects of the predictors on the amount of change over time, one can refer to the estimates in Table 4 . The estimate for the interaction of weeks after surgery with baseline 6 MWT score is .036 indicating that each increase of 1 meter in baseline score, predicts more positive recovery of .036 meters per week. Therefore, if an individual had a baseline score which exceeded another by 100 meters, this would translate into 36 more meters at 10 weeks postoperatively. In the five models, slowing in the recovery trajectory occurred over time and in all models, a second-degree polynomial growth term (quadraticweeks squared) provided a reasonable fit for the data over the study interval.",

            "text": "Using hierarchical linear modeling, this study has contributed evidence that different and important information can be learned from administering physical performance measures to assess physical function. In each of the performance measure models, site of arthroplasty was a predictor of one week scores indicating that patients post TKA began with higher function. A significant interaction with site of arthroplasty and weeks after surgery was also apparent in each of the 6 MWT, TUG and ST models. Although patients undergoing THA started postoperatively with worse function, their rate of recovery was faster than their Predicted Recovery Curves for the Stair Test According to Site of Arthroplasty knee counterparts with respect to each of the performance measures. In contrast, the growth curves for the LEFS and physical function subscale of the WOMAC were not significantly different following THA and TKA. In the graphs (Figures 1, 2, 3) , the patients post THA catch and surpass those following TKA around 9 to 10 weeks. This is likely a reflection of the cessation of the early postoperative hip restrictions beginning at 6 weeks. Another contributing factor would have been the postoperative weight bearing status of the patients following THA with a significant proportion of the patients progressing from restricted to full weight bearing at the 6 week mark. A striking difference between the self-report measures of physical function and performance measure graphs concerns the point at which preoperative scores are predicted to be met. The predicted scores for the WOMAC physical function subscale met the preoperative scores at one to two weeks ( Figure 4 ) and the preoperative LEFS scores were met around 3 weeks ( Figure 5 ). In contrast the preoperative 6 MWT distances were met between 7 -8 weeks, the TUG between 6 -8 weeks and the ST around 8 to 10 weeks. It would appear that the WOMAC physical function subscale is not reflecting the early deterioration that occurs in physical function. Consistent with findings from Predicted Recovery Curves for the WOMAC Physical Function Subscale According to Site of Arthroplasty an earlier study [14] , the LEFS did reflect some of the early deterioration. Walker et al [41] reported a similar finding when comparing measured ambulatory activity to selfreported data in patients post TKR. Their results indicated that self-reported mobility improved before the subjects were actually doing more. Other authors have noted similar findings [7, 24, 26] . It has been suggested that physical performance measures of functioning may confer advantages over self-report measures in the evaluation of change [42, 43] .",

At this time, both the THR and TKR groups having passed the benchmark of 10 seconds which has been documented to be the level at which patients are functionally independent [36] . Reference TUG scores for community-dwelling elderly people Predicted Recovery Curves for the Lower Extremity Function Scale According to Site of Arthroplasty with independent functioning further confirm this finding [44] . The mean TUG score has been reported to be 8 seconds for the age group 60 to 69 and 9 seconds for 70 to 79 year olds [44] . Mizner et al [24] similarly found no change in TUG scores between 3 and 6 months in a group of patients who underwent TKA followed by rehabilitation. As noted in the results, the TUG is a measure that most patients can complete at discharge from hospital and can be of benefit to clinicians administering treatment in the early postoperative period. In contrast, the 6 MWT and ST would not be the best measures for the early postoperative period as in this study between 26-33% of patients could not complete them at discharge. With the exception of the TUG measure, further study will be required to examine the recovery curves of the 6 MWT and ST to determine how much further improvement in function is obtained and to determine when patients have reached the stage of most benefit from surgery.",

It was planned that patients would have a minimum of 2 visits but pref-erably 3 in the first 4 months, although the scheduled times were not to be standardized. The fact that more than 50% of the subjects had only two measurements could have impacted the modeling of the quadratic time component as three time points are required. An important advantage of hierarchical linear modeling, however, is that the number and timing of observations need not be the same across all subjects [17, 47] . In the case of the patients who had limited data, the mixed effects models would stabilize their estimates by anchoring them to the group average. However, bias will still result if the cause of the missingness is related to the outcome that would have been observed. For example, this could have been a problem in the case of the 26% of patients who were unable to complete the ST at their discharge from the hospital. As noted in the results, this group of patients was slower than their counterparts preoperatively and they may have deferred testing due to their postoperative acuity. As a result, had they been tested they might have contributed slower ST times and the absence of their scores could have led to overestimation of the growth curves at the one-two week mark. This may have also been the case with the 6 MWT predicted scores corresponding to the discharge assessment.",

Having fewer data points restricts the complexity of the random effects possible. With the exception of the LEFS model, the only significant random effect was the intercept, indicating that individuals varied in their starting point one week after surgery. In the case of the LEFS, there was a random effect for the growth parameter weeks after surgery, meaning that individuals varied in their rate of recovery. ",

Depending on the time period of administration, the recovery curves also provide information about the choice of measure with the TUG useful only in the early postoperative period. The study has contributed further evidence to highlight the benefit of using physical performance measures to assess recovery of physical function post arthroplasty as important information is gained about the patient's actual level of disability.",
