Additionally, much of the population, such as the aged or immunocompromised, are unable to mount an effective immunologic response for existing vaccines. Vectored Immunoprophylaxis (VIP) is a novel approach designed to address these challenges. Rather than utilizing an antigen to trigger a response from the host's immune system as is normally done with traditional vaccines, VIP genetically engineers the production of tailored antibodies from non-hematopoietic cells, bypassing the humoral immune system. Direct administration of genes encoding for neutralizing antibodies has proven to be effective in both preventing and treating several infectious diseases in animal models. While, a significant amount of work has focused on HIV, including an ongoing clinical trial, the approach has also been shown to be effective for malaria, dengue, hepatitis C, influenza, and more. In addition to presenting itself as a potentially efficient approach to solving long-standing vaccine challenges, the approach may be the best, if not only, method to vaccinate immunocompromised individuals. Many issues still need to be addressed, including which tissue(s) makes the most suitable platform, which vector(s) are most efficient at transducing the platform tissue used to secrete the antibodies, and what are the long-term effects of such a treatment. Here we provide a brief overview of this approach, and its potential application in treating some of the world's most intractable infectious diseases.",

Modern vaccines typically protect by eliciting immunity following exposure to an inactivated or attenuated whole pathogen or recombinant components of a pathogen [1] . This approach works well for diseases in which natural infection leads to immunity and protection against re-infection and has resulted in the eradication of smallpox and dramatic declines in such diseases as diphtheria, measles, and polio [2] . However, it has been more challenging to develop effective vaccines against diseases for which prior infection does not offer full future protection, such as HIV, malaria, hepatitis C virus, and influenza A [1] .",

Passive immunization achieved through the infusion of serum has played a significant historical role in the treatment and prevention of infection [4, 5] . The recent development of hybridoma technology and humanized monoclonal antibodies have resulted in a new class of antibody-based drugs with demonstrated and potential efficacy in cancer, inflammatory diseases, addiction, and infectious diseases [6] . Within this context, there has been an increased interest in passive immunization utilizing monoclonal antibodies produced in plants or transgenic animals for infections such as Ebola virus and MERS-CoV [7, 8] . However, logistical requirements including the need for high antibody concentrations requiring repeated injections due to the short half-life of antibodies, a cold-chain for delivery, and trained medical personnel for delivery create potential limitations to the use of this therapy, especially in low resource areas [1, 9] . The development of passive immunization by gene therapy could be a solution to some of those logistical issues and holds potential promise as either an adjunct to standard vaccination in populations who do not generate a sufficient immune response or for pathogens able to evade current vaccination strategies due to antigenic variability.",

Rather than passively transfering pre-formed antibodies, VIP is a process in which genes encoding previously characterized neutralizing antibodies are vectored into non-hematopoietic cells which then secrete the monoclonal antibodes encoded by those genes [1] (See Fig. 1 .) This vectored delivery and production of specified antibodies allows for protection without generating a standard immune response and results in endogenous antibody production that has the potential to be sustained [9] . The approach has several benefits, including: 1) it does not require the host have the ability to respond immunologically, 2) the antibody can naturally be selected for a specific pathogen targets, as well as specific epitopes, 3) the antibody can be genetically modified to further enhance its activity, and, 4) vectors can be selected or engineered to have tropic characteristics targeting specific tissues and cells, potentially allowing either systemic or enhanced localized antibody production [9] .",

The rAAV was injected into the quadricep muscles of immunodeficient mice and biologically active antibody was found in sera for over 6 months [10] . This study provided the first evidence that rAAV vectors could transfer antibody genes to muscle, and muscle tissue was a suitable platform to produce and distribute the antibodies throughout the circulation [11] . Follow-on studies used a native macaque SIV gp120-specific Fab molecule as an immunoadhesin, a chimeric, antibody-like molecules that combine the functional domain of a binding protein with immunoglobulin constant domains, which were considered to be superior to single chain (scFv) or whole antibody (IgG) molecules with respect to achievable steady-state serum concentrations [22] . Six of nine rhesus macaques were completely protected against intravenous challenge with virulent SIV and still had stable immunoadhesin levels 6 years after injection [11] . The three subjects not protected were found to have developed an immune response to the immunoadhesin by 3 weeks after injection [11] .",

The BNA produced by the vector and secreted by the tissue confers the host subject with broad and lasting protection from the targeted pathogen protection from an intravenous challenge with HIV, they achieved concentrations as high as 100 \u03bcg/mL for at least 12 months [12] . They followed-up that study by optimizing the broadly neutralizing antibody, and although muscle was chosen as a platform for expression and secretion of the IgG1 isotype, antibodies were found to effectively reach the vaginal mucosa. Animals receiving VIP that expressed a modified VRC07 antibody (concentration of nearly 100 \u03bcg/ml in the serum and 1 \u03bcg/ml in vaginal wash fluid) were completely resistant to repetitive intravaginal challenge by a heterosexually transmitted founder HIV strain [23] .",

The life cycle of a virus consists of attachment, penetration, uncoating, replication, gene expression, assembly and budding. Replication and gene expression typically take place in the nucleus where viral genomes persist episomally or integrate into the host genome (i.e., a provirus). Vectors that persist episomally can provide sustained transgene expression in post-mitotic tissue, but since they do not alter the host genome, they may be lost if and when the cells divide. Vectors that integrate into to the host genome may provide life-long transgene expression in dividing cells but could also lead to insertional mutagenesis resulting in apoptosis or malignant transformation [30] . Adenoviral vectors produce rapid, but transient, gene expression that could be ideal for responding to a disease outbreak, but would have limitations for long term protection [1] . Adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5) has successfully transduced protective antibodies for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza A virus (IAV), and Bacillus anthracis [14, 17, 18] . The Ad5 genome is easy to engineer and remains episomal, but there is significant pre-existing immunity to Ad5, estimated at 50% of the adult population worldwide and even higher in sub-Saharan Arica, which decreases the ability to transfer the transgene. Additionally, it can result in systemic cytokine release creating a sepsis presentation and there is significant tissue tropism for the liver when delivered intravenously. Alternative adenoviral vectors are being researched [31] .",

The most benign of these is MGUS, but it has been increasingly recognized to have pathologic associations including is nephropathy secondary to monoclonal gammopathy of renal significance (MGRS), neuropathy, oculopathy, and dermopathy as well as possible associations with autoimmunity and coagulopathy and an epidemiologic association with early mortality from a variety of apparently unrelated causes [40] [41] [42] . Any of these conditions could result from a monoclonal gammopathy produced by VIP. However, it should be noted that MGUS is very common, occurring in 3% of the population older than 50 years old, and most of these associations remain either unclear or uncommon [40] . However, the potential for autoimmunity should be of particular concern. It is possible that the monoclonal antibody could interact with self-antigen and either stimulate an autoimmune antibody that interacts with self-antigen [40] or neutralizes the intended effect of the monoclonal antibody.",

            "text": "Vectored Immunoprophylaxis has demonstrated great promise in a variety of pre-clinical studies as a potential adjunct to vaccination in patients not able to respond effectively to immunization or as an alternative to vaccination for infectious diseases not effectively covered by current vaccines. The rapid identification of specific neutralizing antibodies is likely to increase the potential for this method. One could imagine uses for VIP such as an adjunct to vaccination for influenza in the elderly and immunocompromised, for HIV protection in high risk populations, or as part of a ring vaccination strategy in an outbreak of a disease such as Ebola. Many important questions remain, including the ability to produce equally effective clinical results in human trials, the duration of response, and the potential for side-effects. Mutagenesis at the site of transfection is a common concern, but the development of an immune response to the transgene product or the off-target binding of the antibodies are more likely scenarios, either of which could result in decreased efficacy of the procedure or a significant auto-immune reaction. Questions also remain concerning the best vector and the optimal tissue site for transfection. Despite these questions and concerns, the advantages offered in settings ranging from chronic protection of the aged or immunocompromised to rapid protection for early responders in the event of a bioterror or emerging infection event are significant and intriguing. Further preclinical and clinical studies are certainly warranted. ",
