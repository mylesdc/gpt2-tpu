Only the co-administration of adenoviral vectors encoding IFN\u03b12, IFN\u03b14, IFN\u03b16 and IFN\u03b19 resulted in strongly improved immune protection of vaccinated mice from subsequent FV challenge infection with high control over FV-induced splenomegaly and reduced viral loads. The level of protection correlated with augmented virus-specific CD4 + T cell responses and enhanced antibody titers. Similar results were obtained when mice were vaccinated against HIV with adenoviral vectors encoding HIV Env and Gag-Pol in combination with various type I IFN encoding vectors. Here mainly CD4 + T cell responses were enhanced by IFN\u03b1 subtypes. Conclusions: Our results indicate that certain IFN\u03b1 subtypes have the potential to improve the protective effect of adenovirus-based vaccines against retroviruses. This correlated with augmented virus-specific CD4 + T cell and antibody responses. Thus, co-expression of select type I IFNs may be a valuable tool for the development of antiretroviral vaccines.",

The murine genome comprises 14 type I IFN genes that encode structurally similar proteins of 161-167 amino acids in length. Type I IFN stimulation of a cell results in the expression of hundreds of IFN-regulated genes that mediate an anti-viral state of the cell [1] . In addition, type I IFNs also modulate adaptive immune responses by activating antigen-presenting cells, promoting natural killer cell cytotoxicity and enhancing the proliferation of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells [1] . All type I IFNs bind to and signal through the same receptor IFNAR (IFN\u03b1 receptor) that consists of the two subunits IFNAR1 and IFNAR2; yet the anti-viral and immunomodulatory effects mediated by individual type I IFN subtypes vary considerably [2, 3] . Distinct anti-viral effects of IFN subtypes were demonstrated in several infection models including murine cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, influenza virus and Friend retrovirus infection [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] .",

Up to now, innumerable vaccine candidates have been developed and evaluated in preclinical models, but only three vaccines have been advanced into efficacy testing in large phase IIB or phase III clinical trials. The vaccination with a protein-based vaccine or adenoviral vectors, aiming exclusively at the induction of antibody responses or cytotoxic T cell responses, respectively, did not result in any protective effect [12, 13] . Recently, the vaccination of a communityrisk group with a prime-boost combination of proteinand canarypox vector-based vaccines conferred moderate protection and instilled new hope in the field [14] . This data, together with results from animal models [15, 16] , indicate that for the prevention of HIV infection, both cellular and humoral responses are necessary, and show that it is mandatory to develop means to selectively enhance these responses.",

FV is an immunosuppressive retrovirus complex of the non-pathogenic Friend murine leukemia virus (F-MuLV) and the pathogenic, replicationdefective spleen focus forming virus (SFFV). FV infection of susceptible adult mice induces splenomegaly and erythroleukemia and takes a lethal course within a few weeks [17] . The FV infection is regarded as a very useful model for the analysis of immune responses to retroviral infections and for the identification of mechanisms of protection. It was shown that complete immune protection from FV infection requires complex immune responses involving antibodies and CD4 + as well as CD8 + T cells [15] . Previously, we demonstrated that the FV model is very suitable for the development and assessment of novel vectors and strategies for anti-retroviral vaccination. In this model, we showed the benefit of heterologous adenovirus-based prime-boost immunization, which resulted in better protection from FV challenge and enhanced neutralizing antibody responses than the repeated administration of one vector type [18] . Furthermore, we developed a new type of adenovirus-based expression-display vector that not only encodes a transgene, but also presents it on the adenovirus capsid and conferred strong protection from FV challenge infection, correlating with augmented CD4 + T cell and anamnestic neutralizing antibody responses [19] .",

In contrast to our previous work in which we immunized with 5 \u00d7 10 9 VP of each vector (1 \u00d7 10 10 VP total dose) [18, 19] , this reduced-dose immunization was chosen because it induces only moderate protection on its own, enabling us to analyze the beneficial effect of vectored type I IFN co-administration on vaccine protection. Mice received the adenovirus-vectored F-MuLV antigens co-administered with vectors encoding the selected type I IFN subtypes described above; as a control, one group of mice received the adenoviral vectors encoding F-MuLV Env and Gag and were coadministered vectors encoding luciferase as an irrelevant transgene in order to administer equal amounts of adenoviral particles to all mice. Three weeks after the boost immunization the mice were challenged with FV and the spleen size as a surrogate marker for disease progression was monitored by abdominal palpation. While the immunization of mice with the reduced dose of F-MuLV Env-and Gag-encoding vectors alone did not result in significant protection against initial splenomegaly, coadministration of adenoviral vectors encoding IFN\u03b12, IFN\u03b14, IFN\u03b16 or IFN\u03b19, but not IFN\u03b11, IFN\u03b15 or IFN\u03b2, resulted in significant reduction of FV-induced splenomegaly (P < 0.05; shown in Figure 1A and 1B for days 14 and 17 post-challenge (p.c.)). Improved protection after co-administration of the four IFN subtype vectors was confirmed when animals were sacrificed and spleen weights were measured on day 21 p.c. (Figure 1C ). At this time point, the spleen weights of all vaccinated mice were significantly lower than of unvaccinated control mice demonstrating a moderate protective effect of the low-dose vaccination with F-MuLV Env-and Gag-encoding Ad5 and fiber-chimeric Ad5F35 vectors. However, protection against splenomegaly was significantly improved when mice had been co-administered vectors encoding IFN\u03b12, IFN\u03b14, IFN\u03b16 or IFN\u03b19 (P < 0.05). To ascertain that the observed effects of type I IFN coadministration were due to a modulation of the immune response to the vaccination and not to a direct antiviral effect of residual IFN expression, mice were administered type I IFN encoding vectors alone and challenged afterwards with FV according to the same scheme. Here, no differences in the control of FV-induced disease were observed ( Figure 1D ).",

For FV, only one H2-D b -restricted CD8 + T cell epitope, the GagL epitope [21] , has been identified so far. However, this epitope is not processed in cells infected with the F-MuLV Gag-encoding adenoviral vector used in this study (data not shown). Therefore, it was not surprising that no FV-specific CD8 + T cells were detected with class I tetramers in any of the vaccinated mice (data not shown). In contrast, shortly after FV challenge F-MuLV Env-specific CD4 + T cells could be quantified using MHC II tetramers presenting an F-MuLV gp70 epitope [22] . No tetramer + CD4 + T cells were detectable in unvaccinated mice and in mice vaccinated with Env and Gag alone ( Figure 3 ). In contrast, virus-specific CD4 + T cells were found in all mice that were co-administered vectors encoding IFN\u03b12, IFN\u03b14, IFN\u03b16 or IFN\u03b19 (with only one exception in the IFN\u03b19 group; P < 0.05; Figure 3A ).

However, only FV-specific CD4 + T cell responses were detected in the current vaccine study. To elucidate the impact of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells on vaccinemediated protection after co-administration of IFN subtypes, T cell depletion experiments were performed (see Additional file 1, Figure S1 for a schematic outline of the experiment). IFN\u03b14 co-administration was selected to perform these experiments because it was the subtype Figure 1 FV-induced splenomegaly in adenoviral vector immunized mice. CB6F1 mice were immunized with Ad5 and Ad5F35 based vectors encoding F-MuLV Env and Gag with or without co-administration of a specific vectored type I IFN subtype, as indicated. Ad5-based vectors were used for the prime immunization and Ad5F35 vectors for the boost immunization. Mice of the group \"env+gag\" received an equal amount of luciferase encoding adenoviral vectors instead of IFN encoding vectors to ensure that the total amount of particles used for immunization was the same in all groups. Three weeks after the boost immunization mice were challenged with FV. Disease progression was monitored by palpation of the spleen twice a week. The categorized spleens of six mice per group on day 14 p.c. (A) and day 17 p.c. (B) are shown (means + standard error of the means). On day 21 p.c. spleens were removed and weighed (C). Statistically significant differences (P < 0.05) compared to unvaccinated control mice (*) or mice vaccinated with Env-plus Gag-encoding vectors (#) are indicated. Data are representative of two independent experiments. (D) CB6F1 mice were immunized twice with Ad5 and Ad5F35 based vectors encoding the indicated type I interferons alone and infected with FV three weeks after the second application of IFN vectors. The disease progression was monitored by twice-weekly palpations of the spleen, the graph shows the categorized spleen sizes (mean + standard error of the means) at the indicated time points after FV infection. that mediated the strongest reduction in viral loads in vaccinated mice ( Figure 2 ). Depletion of CD8 + T cells during the time of vaccination did not result in reduced protection in mice inoculated with vectors encoding Envand Gag and IFN\u03b14 ( Figure 4 ). This indicates that in the absence of CD8 + T cells reactive to the immunodominant GagL epitope, also no CD8 + T cells of other, unknown specificity played a major role in vaccinemediated protection. However, depletion of CD4 + T cells had a profound effect on protection. The depletion abolished the protective effect of the Env/Gag/IFN\u03b14 vaccine completely as indicated by severe splenomegaly ( Figure  4A ) and high plasma ( Figure 4B ) and spleen ( Figure 4C ) viral loads in these mice. Thus, the CD4 + T cell response in Env and Gag vaccinated mice, which was augmented by co-administration of IFN\u03b14 ( Figure 3 ) was absolutely critical for vaccine protection.",

            "text": "To determine whether the adjuvant effect of type I IFN subtypes also applied to vaccination against HIV, we analyzed immune responses to an HIV vaccine in mice using adenoviral vectors expressing HIV Env and Gag-Pol alone or in combination with vectors encoding IFN\u03b12, IFN\u03b14, IFN\u03b16 or IFN\u03b19. For the analysis of cellular immune responses, BALB/c mice were immunized once with Ad5-based vectors and spleens were removed two weeks later (see Additional file 1, Figure S1 for a schematic outline of the experiment) to determine cytokine production by CD4 + and CD8 + T cells after in vitro restimulation with HIV Gag derived peptides that have been described before to be relevant T cell epitopes in BALB/c mice [24, 25] . A significant induction of CD4 + T cells producing IFN\u03b3, TNF\u03b1 or IL-2 by the HIV antigen encoding adenovirusbased vaccine was observed in all mice (P < 0.05; Figure 6 A-C). Compared to Env-and Gag-Pol-immunization alone, significantly higher mean percentages of HIV Gagspecific CD4 + T cells producing IL-2 (only for IFN\u03b12) or TNF\u03b1 after restimulation were found in mice that had been co-administered vectors encoding IFN\u03b12, IFN\u03b14 or IFN\u03b19 (P < 0.05). In contrast, IFN\u03b16 had no effect on Vaccine-induced F-MuLV Env-specific CD4 + T cell responses. CB6F1 mice were prime-and boost-immunized with Ad5 and Ad5F35 based vectors, respectively, encoding F-MuLV Env and Gag with or without co-administration of a specific vectored type I IFN subtype, as indicated. Three weeks after the boost immunization mice were challenged with FV and the F-MuLV Env-specific CD4 + T cell response was analyzed 3 days p.c. by staining with MHC II tetramers presenting an F-MuLV Env gp70-derived epitope. HIV Gag-specific CD4 + T cell responses. In addition, the IFN\u03b3 expression by CD4 + T cells was not changed by any of the four type I IFN subtypes. Similar results were also obtained when mice were immunized twice with a prime boost immunization protocol using Ad5-based vectors for priming and Ad5F35-based vectors for boosting, resembling the FV experiments. Again IFN\u03b12, IFN\u03b14 or IFN\u03b19 enhanced CD4 + T cells responses but in these experiments the differences between the groups were not as pronounced as after only one vaccination (data not shown). Similar to the CD4 + T cell response, the HIV Env-and Gag-Pol-immunization induced cytokine producing CD8 + T cells, which responded specifically to restimulation with Gag-derived peptides ( Figure 6 D-E) . The mean percentages of cytokine producing CD8 + T cells were higher than those for CD4 + T cells. However, after co-delivery of IFN\u03b12, IFN\u03b14 or IFN\u03b16 only slightly enhanced mean percentages of IL-2 producing HIV Gag-specific CD8 + T cells were detected than in Env-and Gag-Pol-immunized mice and the difference did not reach statistical significance. Expression levels of TNF\u03b1 and IFN\u03b3 were comparable in all immunized mice irrespective of IFN co-administration, with very high percentages of IFN\u03b3-producing CD8 + T cells in all groups. Similar results were obtained when CD8 + T cells were restimulated with an Env-derived epitope peptide (data not shown).",

Type I IFNs have also been used to improve the efficacy of experimental vaccines including protein [26] , DNA [8, [27] [28] [29] [30] and viral vector vaccines [31] [32] [33] , but a systematic approach to study the adjuvant efficacy of different IFN subtypes has not been undertaken so far. In this study, we analyzed seven adenovirus-vectored type I IFN subtypes for their effect on an adenoviral vectorbased anti-retroviral vaccination. As expected, the effect on vaccine efficacy of the IFN subtypes differed greatly. While the co-administration of adenoviral vectors encoding IFN\u03b12, IFN\u03b14, IFN\u03b16 and IFN\u03b19 led to improved control over FV-induced disease and strongly reduced viral loads, no or only slight effects were observed after co-administration of the subtypes IFN\u03b11, IFN\u03b15 and IFN\u03b2. All four IFN subtypes that improved vaccine protection enhanced virusspecific CD4 + T cell and antibody responses. The importance of the FV-specific CD4 + T cell response for vaccine protection was emphasized by a depletion experiment, in which vaccine-mediated protection was completely abolished when CD4 + T cells were depleted around the time point of vaccination. The kinetic analysis of the early activation of B cells and CD4 + T cells after vaccination suggests that co-administration of IFN\u03b14 might influence the CD4 + memory T cell formation, whereas no differences in overall activation of CD4 + or CD8 + T cells with effector phenotype or B cells was found (data not shown). An improved central memory CD4 + T cell response might be critical for enhanced virus-specific cellular and humoral recall responses after virus challenge, as similar findings have been reported for FV infected mice [34] .",

However, the vaccination with adenoviral vectors very likely induced CD8 + T cell responses of up to now unknown specificity as activated CD8 + T cells with effector phenotype were detected after immunization (data not shown). This is in line with previous reports that after vaccination with vaccinia viruses encoding different F-MuLV Gag constructs also regions other than the leader can induce protective CD8 + T cell immune responses [45] . However, our CD8 + T cell depletion experiment did not result in reduced protection, suggesting that CD8 + T cell responses against other epitopes did not play a critical role for the improved protection after co-administration of type I IFNs. Our data from vaccination of mice against HIV proteins also showed only minor effects of type I IFNs on CD8 + T cell responses, suggesting that these cytokines may not be very efficient to enhance adenovirus-based vaccine induced CD8 + T cell responses.",

The data imply that the adjuvant potential of IFN subtypes may vary depending on the type of vaccine. For DNA and protein-based vaccines against model antigens or virus infections, most efforts to improve vaccine efficacy by co-administration of type I IFNs resulted in improved antibody and CD8 + T cell responses that mediated enhanced protection [8, [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] . The effect of type I IFN co-expression in virusvector based vaccines, however, seems to depend on the vector-type. Immune responses, but not protection, induced by a rabies virus based vaccine against HIV could be improved by co-expression of IFN\u03b2 [32] . The protective effect of a vaccinia virus-vectored vaccine against influenza, on the other hand, was not improved by IFN\u03b2 or IFN\u03b14 co-administration [31] . Interestingly, none of the above cited publications reports an enhanced induction of CD4 + T cells, while we found strongly augmented CD4 + T cell responses that correlated well with the observed improved protection against systemic FV challenge infection conferred by codaministration of specific type I IFN subtypes with the vaccine.",

In our current vaccination study, the finding that only IFN\u03b12, IFN\u03b14, IFN\u03b16 and IFN\u03b19, but not IFN\u03b11, IFN\u03b15 and IFN\u03b2, had an adjuvant effect on the adenovirus-based vaccine may also be related to the immunogenicity of the vector itself. In fact, the ineffective IFN subtypes were those that were expressed at the highest levels in Ad-infected DCs (see Additional file 2, Figure S2 ), which is in accordance with an earlier report showing that the adenovirus-induced type I IFN response was predominantly comprised of IFN\u03b11, IFN\u03b15 and IFN\u03b2 [46] . While additional expression of these IFN subtypes from the vaccine vectors did not enhance immunogenicity, broadening the IFN profile by expressing other IFN subtypes seems to be more effective. It has been established that, while all type I IFNs signal through the same receptor, the IFN subtypes bind this receptor with different affinities [47, 48] . These differences in receptor binding can result in different downstream signaling events and distinct induction of interferon stimulated genes. Thus, the tested IFN subtypes may have induced different activation pattern in vaccine-primed immune cells, which might be an underlying mechanism for their distinct adjuvant effects.",
