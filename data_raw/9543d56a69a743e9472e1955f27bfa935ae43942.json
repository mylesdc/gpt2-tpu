            "text": "In April 2009, the pandemic influenza A (A(H1N1)pdm09) spreads rapidly across the globe. 1,2 As of July 9, 2010, worldwide more than 214 countries have confirmed A (H1N1)pdm09 cases including over 18 311 deaths. 3 However, there were notable differences in disease severity between in America and in Asia. 4 In the United States, the number of deaths due to A(H1N1)pdm09 among children was nearly four times greater than the previous seasonal influenza seasons. 5 The hospitalization and death rates for A (H1N1)pdm09 among Argentina children less than 1 year of age increased twice and 10 times, respectively, compared with the previous seasonal influenza. 6 On the other hand, in Japan, even though large outbreaks of pandemic influenza caused a high rate of hospitalization especially among children aged 5-9 year (59%), a very low number of deaths were reported. 7 Similarly, a study from South India also reported that A(H1N1)pdm09 was associated with a low risk of hospitalization and ICU admission. 8 Influenza outbreak during the immediate post-pandemic period has been known to cause severe morbidity and mortality. 9 However, systematic analysis showed that the impact of A(H1N1)pdm09 in the post-pandemic period also varied across regions. Most of countries reported a lower influenza activity 10, 11 , and some countries such as Spain, England, and Taiwan reported a shift in age distribution and severity. [12] [13] [14] There were several published studies evaluating the impact of A(H1N1)pdm09; however, only few of them were population-based multiyear surveillance. 15 , 16 We have established a community-based, prospective surveillance for childhood acute respiratory infections (ARI) in Nha Trang city, Khanh Hoa province, central Vietnam since February 2007. Because the area was surrounded by the sea and mountains and there was only a single hospital providing primary, secondary, and tertiary care for residents, we were able to determine the incidence rates of hospitalized ARI. 17 This ARI surveillance has observed the A(H1N1)pdm09 outbreak and the post-pandemic period.",

Details of the surveillance methods were described previously. 18 Mild influenza cases with fever and sore throat were treated at outpatient department of KHGH and polyclinics in the community. Antibacterial agents could be prescribed but antivirals were not available. In brief, all hospitalized children who presented with cough and/or difficulty breathing, aged less than 15 year and residing in the catchment area, were enrolled. This covered all pediatric influenza cases that required hospitalization. Demographic and clinical information were collected by trained research nurses using a standardized form. Blood and nasopharyngeal swab (NSP) specimens were obtained from the participants after admission and completion of informed consent. Flexible Sterile FLOQ Swab, COPAN, Italy (#503CS01) was used for the nasopharyngeal sample collection. Chest X-rays were taken within 48 hours on admission and read in accordance with the WHO radiological reading guideline, radiologically confirmed pneumonia indicated end point consolidation.",

The A(H1N1)pdm09 cases were older (40\u00c18 versus 27\u00c15 months, P = 0\u00c10009), and the duration for onset to hospitalization was shorter (1\u00c16 versus 3\u00c11 days, P = 0\u00c10015) compared with seasonal influenza A cases. However, the A(H1N1)pdm09 cases had lower body temperature (38\u00c14 versus 39\u00c17\u00b0C, P = 0\u00c10003), slower pulse rate (98\u00c16 versus 114\u00c12/minute, P = <0\u00c10001), and less wheeze (P = <0\u00c10001) compared with seasonal influenza cases.

There was no difference in terms of hospitalization periods between the two groups. No influenza-positive ARI cases in this study were severe enough to received intensive care or required mechanical ventilation. Among a total of 354 influ-A cases, coinfection with other respiratory viruses was identified in 84 cases (24%). Respiratory syncytial virus was the commonest followed by HRV.

Similarly, in England, the incidence of A (H1N1)pdm09 hospitalization increased two times from 2\u00c16 to 5\u00c13 per 100 000 during the post-pandemic periods. 13 In contrast, in Argentina where the A(H1N1)pdm09 hospitalization rate among children increased 2 times during 2009 pandemic, no pediatric hospitalization due to A(H1N1) pdm09 was identified in the post-pandemic season. 30 Similar reduction in influenza cases in the post-pandemic period was also reported in the United Sates from 79\u00c18 during the pandemic to 36\u00c15 in the next influenza season. 31 In this study setting, the influenza A hospitalization incidence for both seasonal and pandemic was highest among 12-23 month age group. This may be due to the waning of the protective effect of maternal transferred antibody to the child and the changing social contact behavior in this age group. Several factors may be responsible for the difference of influenza incidence in different countries. First, influenza surveillance and detection system might be different between during and after the A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic in some countries. As many countries expanded the surveillance system and switched from rapid antigen test to PCR-based detection which is more sensitive, it is expected to have increased detection rates. Second, each country adopted various management programs to control the outbreak during the pandemic, including school closure, antiviral treatment, and behavior change due to pandemic awareness. They will also have effect on the outcome. Lastly, influenza seasonality is naturally different between temperate and tropical regions. In connection with that, influenza virus survival and transmissibility, host physiology, social behavior, or their combination can contribute to different epidemiological patterns.",

In Vietnam, the health care for all children under 6 years of age is free of charge and their access to medical facilities in our study site is relatively good. However, to receive free treatment, they need to go to designated commune health center or polyclinic first to receive clinical treatment. If illness is severe, they will be referred to KHGH. On June 11, 2009 , the WHO declared globally the A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic influenza outbreak. In Vietnam, the government informed all medical institution and the public about the situation and introduced guidelines for management. The first case of A(H1N1)pdm09 was detected in Nha Trang on July 30, 2009 . At that time, the community was already aware of the situation, so this might led the parents to bring their children to the health facilities earlier. This changing behavior may be one of the reasons for seeing less severe cases among A(H1N1)pdm09 cases compared with seasonal influenza cases in Vietnam.
