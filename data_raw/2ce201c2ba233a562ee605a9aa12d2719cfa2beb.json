Infections of HAdV can cause a variety of clinical diseases, ranging from asymptomatic and self-limited conditions to pneumonia and even death. 1 As of now, at least 68 HAdV genotypes have been identified and are classified into seven species (A-G). 2 Furthermore, viruses in species B, C, and E are more commonly associated with symptomatic respiratory infections. 1, [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] Human adenovirus type 55 (HAdV55), a member of HAdV-B family, was first identified from a military outbreak in Spain in 1969. 8 This virus used to be recognized as HAdV-B11a by partial characterization of its hexon and fiber epitopes. [9] [10] [11] In 2006, Michael et al. revealed that HAdV55 was an emergent respiratory pathogen. 12 It had evolved from a homologous recombination between HAdV-B14 and HAdV-B11 in its hexon gene, which conferred changes in viral serotype and immune activity. In recent decades, HAdV55 has been associated with several respiratory infections outbreaks. 9, 11, 13, 14 Crowed communities, military training camps, and schools are common settings for HAdV infections.",

The staff had basically followed the standard infection control procedures when they cared for the patients. In the nurse stations and the resting rooms, the nurses preferred not to wear any protective equipment. They shared most office supplies, such as computers, medical records, and examination records. More often, it was the nurses who visited the doctors' offices for daily work communication, while the doctors rarely visited the nurse stations and their resting rooms, except for the acupuncturist, who was responsible for the entire department and was used to drinking water in nurse station A.",

The phylogenies showed the outbreak strains belonged to the [P14H11F14] genotype, with hexon genes clustered together with HAdV-B11, and the fiber and penton genes clustered with HAdV-B14 (Figure 2). This genotype is a recently emerged recombination between HAdV-B11 and HAdV-B14 viruses named HAdV55. To confirm the type of HAdV, four randomly selected HAdV strains from two cases with upper respiratory infections and two cases with pneumonia were sequenced for the whole genome (accession number KY070248, KY780931-KY780933). No variations were observed. The phylogeny of the whole genome sequence confirmed that the outbreak strains fell into the HAdV55 [P14H11F14] clade (Figure 2D). Strains from this outbreak were segregated together and could be separated from other isolates. The most closely related strains were HAdV55 strains that previously circulated in China between 2006 and 2013.",

One of the first two cases had been reported a 2-day leave 6 days before she was infected. She may have been infected from her community and then introduced the virus to the hospital. The party offered a good chance for viral transmission among the nurses. Transmission from hospital staff to inpatients may have occurred during this outbreak. The interval between the two peaks of the outbreak was about 6 days, approximately equal to the incubation period of the HAdV infection.19 The later peak mainly consisted of inpatients, which may represent secondary cases. Molecular analysis revealed 100% identities of the fiber, hexon, and penton genes from HAdVs isolated in this outbreak. All fell into HAdV55 [P14H11F14] cluster, indicating that HAdV55 was the single viral strain for the outbreak.HAdV55 is a newly identified re-emerged acute respiratory disease pathogen. When and where this new lineage arises is still unknown due to the lack of surveillance. Current sequences data indicate the oldest strain of HAdV55 [P14H11F14] was identified in Egypt in 2001. In recent years, this virus has been reported to have caused several outbreaks, the majority of which arose in military training facilities. In China, HAdV55 was first identified in 2006 from an outbreak in a senior high school in the Shaanxi province. 9 Since then, sporadic cases of HAdV55 infections have been increasingly reported, especially in northern China. 14,20 This first identification of HAdV55 outbreak in southern China suggests this recombinant adenovirus has been widely disseminated in China. The limited data suggest the outbreak strains of HAdV55 in Guangdong were more likely introduced from other regions of China rather than from recombination in local places, as nearly identical strains were identified from Beijing and Chongqing cities for these three genes. Comparative studies conducted between HAdV55 and other types (HAdV-7, HAdV-3, HAdV-14, HAdV-50, and HAdV-C)show a higher tendency of more severe illness in HAdV55-infected patients.20 In this outbreak, 11 of 15 infected inpatients developed pneumonia. In contrast, only one staff member was diagnosed with pneumonia, and other staff developed mild and self-limited symptoms.",

However, we have little knowledge on HAdV-55 distributions and their molecular evolution in southern China at present. The first HAdV-55 identified in Guangzhou was in 2013. A more comprehensive investigation combined with sequential surveillance and monitoring of this agent would be helpful to trace the transmission origin and provide more molecular epidemiology baseline data in China.",

Recent studies have shown that the immune system plays a crucial role in the clearance of HAdV viremia and survival of the host.21,22 Owing to underlying conditions, it is more likely for the infected inpatients to develop severe diseases.23,24 Given the possible association of severe disease with HAdV-55, this virus should be considered sooner in such hospital settings to allow appropriate medical care.Healthcare-associated infection has been a constant issue since the early days of medicine. To our knowledge, this is the first report on an HAdV55-associated hospital outbreak. HAdV is an ideal agent for nosocomial transmission due to its prolonged shedding and its resilient nature. It can spread rapidly through close contact with infected patients or by exposure to fomites. During this outbreak, standard infection control procedures, such as hand washing, wearing surgical masks, and hair caps, were implemented as routine policy in the hospital. However, some staff may have adopted these infection control precautions improperly due to negligence or weak control awareness.Furthermore, consistent compliance with contact and droplet precautions only occurred in working areas, but not in the nurse stations and resting rooms during the beginning of the outbreak. The fact that the infected cases remained infectious during the incubation period has generated challenges to infection control. It was not possible to assess the degree of contact between the first two cases and the other infected staff and inpatients. The acupuncturist and some infected nurses in other units had reported visiting histories to unit A before their illness. Restriction for staff to perform patient care was implemented on June 27. It is possible that this measure helped prevent further transmissions from nurses to patients, as no additional inpatients were infected after July 5, about one incubation period past its implementation. To combat nosocomial outbreaks, healthcare settings should ensure that universal precautions and healthcare guidelines are consistently followed.",
