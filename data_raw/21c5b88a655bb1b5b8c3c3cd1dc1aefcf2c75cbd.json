            "text": "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome is an infectious disease that causes serious economic losses to the swine industry worldwide. To better understand the pathogenesis of the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), three PRRSV strains with different molecular markers and virulence were used to infect MARC-145 cells. A total of 1804 proteins were identified, and 233 altered proteins and 72 signaling pathways involved in the proteomic profiling of virus-infected MARC-145 cells increased with the virulence of the PRRSV strain. The three types of viral strains shared a common pathway-the electron transport reaction in mitochondria-in the infected-MARC-145 cells. Moreover, the antisense pathway was the most variable of all significant signaling pathways for the highly virulent SX-1 strain, indicating that this unique pathway may be connected to the high virulence of the SX-1 strain. Our study is the first attempt to provide a proteome profile of MARC-145 cells infected with PRRSV strains with different virulence, and these findings will facilitate a deep understanding of the interactions between this virus and its host.",

As a member of the Arteriviridae family, PRRSV is an enveloped, linear, single positive-stranded RNA virus, and it is similar to the equine arteritis virus, lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus, and simian hemorrhagic fever virus 2 . PRRSV can be classified into two distinct genotypes: type 1 (European type) and type 2 (North American type) 3,4 . In vivo, this virus mainly infects pulmonary alveolar macrophages (PAMs) 5-7 , whereas in vitro, MARC-145 cells are a good platform to study viral replication, pathogenesis, and host response [8] [9] [10] [11] .",

Signals regarding antisense RNA transcription and regulation were named the antisense pathway, in which PSF (Polypyrimidine tract-binding protein-associated-splicing factor), P54 (Non-POU domain-containing octamer-binding protein) and MATR3 (matrin-3) are major proteins 15-17 . PSF is a DNA-and RNA-binding protein, involved in regulation of signal-induced alternative splicing and homologous DNA pairing 18 . The PSF-P54 heterodimer associated with MATR3 may play a role in nuclear retention of defective RNAs 19 .

After digestion, quantification and labeling were performed according to the iTRAQ protocol (Applied Biosystems) 33 , and the 4-plex iTRAQ experiments were conducted. Gene Ontology and Pathway and Protein Signal Network Analyses. Functional annotation of the 1804 identified proteins was initially performed using the Protein Center software. A P-value of <0.05 and an FDR of <0.05 in a two-sided Fisher's exact test were selected as significant criteria. Three main types of annotations were obtained from the gene ontology consortium website: cellular components, molecular function, and biological distribution (Fig. 1) . A number of the identified proteins were involved in cellular and metabolic processes and biological regulation. Moreover, the molecular function of the identified proteins was associated Continued with binding and catalytic activity. A total of 233 differentially expressed proteins were discovered in this study. Furthermore, 105 proteins were identified as differentially expressed in Group I (SX-1 vs. MARC-145), including 46 upregulated proteins and 59 downregulated proteins ( Table 2) ; 84 proteins were identified as differentially expressed in Group II (ZCYZ vs. MARC-145), including 59 upregulated proteins and 25 downregulated proteins (Table 3) ; and 44 proteins were identified as differentially expressed in Group III (SD1 vs. MARC-145), including 25 upregulated proteins and 19 downregulated proteins (Table 4 ).

To clarify the function of PSF in the viral replication cycle, the effect of decreasing the amount of intracellular PSF on the replication of PRRSV was further examined using target-specific RNA interference. Therefore, MARC-145 cells were transfected with PSF siRNA duplexes designed to specifically silence the expression of the PSF gene. As shown in Fig. 5A , MARC-145 cells transfected with PSF siRNA exhibited an approximately 82% decreased level of endogenous PSF protein compared with the cells transfected with scrambled, noneffective siRNAs (Fig. 5B) . The reduction in PSF protein concentration resulted in a significant decrease in viral yield through the TCID 50 quantitative method; particularly, a 12.7-fold decrease at 60 hpi was observed in SiPSF-transfected groups compared with scramble-transfected groups (Fig. 5C ). However, no significant effect on the viral yield of the ZCYZ or SD1 strains was noted, indicating that PSF has a different effect on the various virulent strains of PRRSV. Taken together, these results revealed that PSF has a unique upregulated expression and is required for the effective infection of the highly virulent PRRSV SX-1 strain.",

            "text": "In Group I (SX-1 vs. MARC-145), the differentially expressed proteins were mostly involved in morphogenesis, protein synthesis, metabolism, stress response, the receptor complex, and endocytosis. FLNB, FLNA, LMNA, and LMNB1 were supposed to involve an alteration of cytoskeletal networks and cellular communication. HSPD1, HSPA8, HSP90AA1, and HSPE1 were related to stress response 37 . In addition, they acted as molecular chaperones facilitating the assembly of multiprotein complexes, participating in the translocation of polypeptides across cell membranes and to the nucleus, and aiding in the proper folding of nascent polypeptide chains. HSPA8, also known as HSP70, is mainly found in both the cytosol and nucleus of mammalian cells, playing key roles in the cytosolic endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondrial import machinery 38 . The upregulated expression of HSP70 can protect PRRSV-infected MARC-145 cells against apoptosis and be conducive to the replication and spread of the virus, indicating that HSP70 is associated with the pathogenesis of this virus. As a member of the annexin family, ANXA2 is highly expressed in eukaryotic cells and localizes in the cytosol 39 have implicated ANXA2 in the replication of certain viruses [39] [40] [41] . Regarding PRRSV, ANXA2 can interact with the PRRSV Nsp9 protein and be incorporated into virions 42 . Importantly, ANXA2 is beneficial for PRRSV replication in vitro 43 . The cytoskeleton protein of vimentin (VIM) acts as the receptor complex of PRRSV and forms a complex with Nsp2 by using the viral N protein as an intermediate 44, 45 . CLTC (clathrin) is a major protein component of the cytoplasmic face of intracellular organelles, the so-called coated vesicles and coated pits. It has been reported that the entry of PRRSV into cells occurs by specific binding to the outer cell membrane, followed by clathrin-dependent endocytosis. First, the PRRS virions bind to cell-surface receptors; then, they are delivered intact into the endosome through clathrin-coated pits and vesicles. The entire process was demonstrated and proven using confocal microscopy 46-48 . In Group II (ZCYZ vs. MARC-145), an interesting discovery that differed from other groups was that the expressed proteins, including PSMA1, PSMA2, PSMA7, PSMB4, and PSMD1, were involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (UPP). This pathway is the major nonlysosomal process responsible for the breakdown of most short-lived and long-lived proteins in mammalian cells. In addition, this pathway controls various major biological events-avoidance of host immune surveillance, viral maturation and viral progeny release, oncogenesis, transcriptional control, signal transduction, receptor downregulation, and antigen processing-via the breakdown of specific proteins 49 . Many viruses have been reported to evolve different strategies to utilize this pathway for their own benefits. For example, the ubiquitin-proteasome system has been suggested to be required for p53 inactivation, apoptosis suppression, viral transcription, and regulation of the human T-cell leukemia virus 1 50, 51 . Adenovirus and coronavirus can also make use of the UPP for ubiquitination 52, 53 . Recently, the ovarian tumor domain of PRRSV Nsp2 was reported to possess ubiquitin-deconjugating activity, which inhibits NF-\u03baB activation through the prevention of i\u03baB\u03b1 degradation by interfering with its polyubiquitination process 54 . Nsp11 protein, which has a unique and conserved endoribonuclease, inhibits NF-\u03baB activation by specifically removing lysine 48 (K48)-linked polyubiquitin chains 55 .",

These differentially expressed proteins were mainly related to cell morphology, protein synthesis and metabolism, heat stress response, etc. The central proteins included NCL, DDX3X, FASN, FLNA, HSPA8, and ANXA2. NCL (also called nucleolin) is a type of cellular skeleton protein with the primary function of binding with proteins and nucleic acids. DDX3X is an ATP-dependent RNA helicase that has ATP-binding activity, nucleic acid-and protein-binding activity, and helicase activity. It is mainly involved in species interactions. FASN is mainly related to fatty acid and energy metabolism. FLNA (filament protein A), a skeleton protein in cells, not only has the ability to bind with proteins, nucleic acids, and transcription factors but also possesses the function of signal transduction.",

Signals regarding antisense RNA transcription and regulation were named the antisense pathway, in which PSF and P54 are major proteins [15] [16] [17] . After infection with the PRRSV SX-1 strain, PSF and P54 protein expression was upregulated ( Fig. 2A) , and the antisense pathway was the most variable of all the significant signaling pathways for the highly virulent SX-1 strain; however, this finding was not observed in the signaling pathways for the moderately virulent ZCYZ strain or the mildly virulent SD1 strain ( Fig. 2A) . Hence, target-specific RNA interference was used to decrease endogenous PSF protein levels to verify its function in PRRSV infection. After decreasing PSF protein concentration, the viral yield of SX-1 significantly decreased, whereas the viral yield of the ZCYZ and SD1 strains were not significantly affected (Fig. 5) , indicating that PSF protein has different functions in various virulent PRRSV strains. As a major protein of the antisense pathway, the silencing of PSF expression is expected to affect antisense pathway function. Accordingly, the molecular mechanism of PSF and antisense pathway function in the infection of different virulent PRRSV strains will be assessed in further research. ",
