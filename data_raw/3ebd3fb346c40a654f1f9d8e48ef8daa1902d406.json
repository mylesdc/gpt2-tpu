Ascitic fluids and/or biopsy samples were subjected to a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) targeted for a conserved region of 3'untranslated region (3'UTR) of the FCoV genome. Eighty nine percent of the sampled animals were positive for the presence of FCoV. Among the FCoV positive cats, 80% of cats were males and 64% were below 2 years of age. The FCoV positive cases included 56% domestic short hair (DSH), 40% Persian, and 4% Siamese cats. The nucleotide sequences of 10 selected amplified products from FIP cases were determined. The sequence comparison revealed that the field isolates had 96% homology with a few point mutations. The extent of homology decreased to 93% when compared with reference strains. The overall branching pattern of phylogenetic tree showed two distinct clusters, where all Malaysian isolates fall into one main genetic cluster. These findings provided the first genetic information of FCoV in Malaysia.",

FCoVs belong to subgroup 1a of Coronaviruses in the family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales. Other members of this subgroup include porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus, canine coronavirus, raccoon/dog coronavirus and Chinese ferret badger coronavirus [1, 2] . FCoVs are enveloped, positive-strand RNA viruses with a large, capped and polyadenylated RNA genome of about 29 kb. The cap structure at the 5' end of genome is followed by an untranslated region (UTR). At the 3' end of the genome is another UTR of 275 nucleotides, followed by the poly (A) tail. The sequences of the both 3'-and 5'-UTR are important for RNA replication and transcription [3] .",

Infection with FECV is usually unapparent or manifested by a transient gastroenteritis. In contrast, FIPV infection causes a fatal immune-mediated disease with a wide spectrum of clinical signs. FIP refers to the more common effusive (wet) form of the disease characterized by peritonitis and/or pleuritis. The effusive form is caused by complement-mediated vasculitis and results in inflammatory exudation into body cavities. In some FIP cases, partial cell-mediated immunity cause non-effusive (dry) form which is characterized by granulomatous involvement of various organs particularly central nervous system and eyes. However, the FIP forms can transform to each other [4] [5] [6] . It has been suggested that virulent FIPV arises by mutation from parental FECV in the individual, persistently infected host [4, 7, 8] . It is not yet clear which alterations in the FCoV genome are responsible for the generation of FIPV from FECV [3, 6] .",

Although, the PCR results must be interpreted in conjunction with clinical or pathological findings, detection of the virus in FIP-suspected cats may be useful to confirm FIP. Since FCoVs are ubiquitous in cats with high seroprevalence [5, 6, 12] , PCR provides the obvious advantage over serology by directly detecting FCoV genome rather than documenting a previous immune system encounter with the coronavirus. The primers of this PCR assay were chosen from a highly conserved region of 3'UTR of the FCoV genome to detect most, if not all of the FCoV strains. The usefulness of these primers for a general screening test has been reported previously [14] [15] [16] .",

About 56% of FCoV-positive cases were DSH, 40% Persian, and 4% Siamese cats. In the present study, the majority of cats (96%) diagnosed with FIP were DSH or Persian. This finding is in accordance with a previous report on FIP in Malaysia showing that 69.7% and 27.3% of cats diagnosed with FIP were DSH and Persian cats, respectively [11] . However, these studies did not conclude that these two breeds were more susceptible to FIP because of limited variation in cat breeds presented at UVH-UPM and lack of clinical cases of FIP in different breeds in Malaysia. Furthermore, in a study on the prevalence of FIP in specific cat breeds, DSH and Persian cats were at low risk compared to others [18] .
