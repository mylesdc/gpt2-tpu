Using daily reported cumulative case data up until 13 February 2020 from the National Health Commission of China, we report 5and 10-day ahead forecasts of cumulative case reports. Specifically, we generate forecasts using a generalized logistic growth model, the Richards growth model, and a sub-epidemic wave model, which have each been previously used to forecast outbreaks due to different infectious diseases. Forecasts from each of the models suggest the outbreaks may be nearing extinction in both Guangdong and Zhejiang; however, the sub-epidemic model predictions also include the potential for further sustained transmission, particularly in Zhejiang. Our 10-day forecasts across the three models predict an additional 65-81 cases (upper bounds: 169-507) in Guangdong and an additional 44-354 (upper bounds: 141-875) cases in Zhejiang by February 23, 2020. In the best-case scenario, current data suggest that transmission in both provinces is slowing down.",

As of 13 February 2020, there have been 59,907 cumulative cases, including 1368 deaths, reported globally with 48,206 cases reported in Hubei alone [1] . To control the epidemic, the Chinese government has enacted a range of social distancing strategies, such as city-wide lockdowns, screening measures at train stations and airports, active case finding, and isolation of suspected cases. The numbers of cases and deaths continue to accumulate every day. However, 2 of 9 the transmission appears to be slowing down outside Hubei due to strict lockdowns combined with isolation and quarantine measures [1] [2] [3] .",

For instance, the case definition has been revised over time, and, as of 12 February 2020, reported cases of the disease incorporate clinically suspected cases in addition to laboratory-confirmed cases, which led to a noticeable increase in cases in the province of Hubei on 13 February 2020. These additional cases are likely historical cases that occurred days or weeks earlier. In the absence of additional information, this change in reporting obscures the true underlying epidemic trajectory, especially in Hubei, and complicates the inference of epidemiological parameters, such as the effective reproduction number, and the calibration of mechanistic transmission models that rely on data after 12 February 2020.",

The fluctuating case definition may partially explain the slowing down observed in the data that result in the GLM and Richards model predicting extinction. The kink in the Zhejiang data may suggest a case definition change around 6 February 2020, which would partially explain a decrease in the new daily cases reported. The slowing in cases after 6 February is apparent in both Guangdong and Zhejiang. This pattern must be interpreted with caution; it is not entirely clear whether this is a true decline in transmission, or if it is an artificial decline due to the changing case definition. Therefore, the sub-epidemic model forecasts likely better capture both possibilities. Additionally, on 14 February 2020, China officially reported that 1716 healthcare workers have been infected with the disease, suggesting disease amplification in healthcare settings as has been previously documented for past SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreaks [15] . This analysis does not account for the greater potential for transmission in healthcare settings. Finally, we note that our forecasts are not sensitive to the last data point used to calibrate the models (13 February 2020), despite the most recent change in case reporting (Tables S2  and S3 ).",

Thus, we point readers to the sub-epidemic model predictions specifically, which suggest that another smaller wave of cases is in process. If the observed decline in case incidence is true, the predictions likely reflect the impact of the social distancing measures implemented by the Chinese government. In the best-case scenario, the model forecasts based on the current data suggest that transmission in both provinces is slowing down.",

For this approach, we assume that the observed curve is the aggregate of multiple overlapping sub-epidemics, where each sub-epidemic is modeled using the GLM [10] . An epidemic wave composed of n overlapping sub-epidemics is modeled asis the cumulative number of infections in sub-epidemic i (i = 1, . . . , n), K i is the size of the i th sub-epidemic, and the growth rate r and scaling parameter p are the same across sub-epidemics [10] . Further, when n = 1, the model returns to the single-equation GLM as presented above. The timing of onset for each consecutive sub-epidemic is modeled with a regular structure, such that the (i + 1)th sub-epidemic is triggered when the cumulative case count of sub-epidemic i, C i (t), exceeds the threshold C thr . The (i + 1)th sub-epidemic begins before the i th sub-epidemic reaches extinction. The size of consecutive sub-epidemics (K i ) is modeled such that the size declines exponentially for each subsequent sub-epidemic, whereJ. Clin. Med. 2020, 9, 596 8 of 9 K 0 is the size of the first sub-epidemic (K 1 = K 0 ), and q is the rate of decline, where q = 0 corresponds to no decline. The total final epidemic size iswhere n tot is the finite number of overlapping sub-epidemics, calculated as n tot = \u2212 1 q ln C thr K 0 + 1",
