            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), a member of Alphacoronavirus, has caused huge economic losses for the global pork industry recently. The spike (S) protein mediates PEDV entry into host cells. Herein, we investigated the interactions between the S protein and its receptor porcine aminopeptidase N (pAPN) or co-receptor sugars. The C-terminal domain (CTD) of the S1 domain is bound to pAPN. The prototype strain demonstrated similar receptor-binding activity compared with the variant field isolate. Three loops at the tips of the \u03b2-barrel domains did not play crucial roles in the PEDV S-pAPN association, indicating that PEDV conforms to a different receptor recognition model compared with transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine respiratory CoV (PRCV), and human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63). The N-terminal domain (NTD) of the PEDV S1 domain could bind sugar, a possible co-receptor for PEDV. The prototype strain exhibited weaker sugar-binding activity compared with the variant field isolate. Strategies targeting the receptor binding domain (RBD) may be helpful for developing vaccines or antiviral drugs for PEDV. Understanding the differences in receptor binding between the prototype and the variant strains may provide insight into PEDV pathogenesis. Viruses 2016, 8, 55 2 of 15",

ACE2 is also a receptor for human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63), in which three discontinuous fragments located within CTD of the S1 domain are responsible for receptor binding [4] . No structural homology has been found between the SARS and HCoV-NL63 RBDs, but they recognize the same receptor (ACE2). Meanwhile, their RBDs share the same receptor recognition hotspots [5] . The RBD of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) is located within CTD of the S1 domain. The RBD crystal structures of TGEV and HCoV-NL63 show similarities, but they use different receptors [2] . The RBDs of murine hepatitis virus (MHV) and bovine coronavirus (BCoV) in the same genus of Betacoronaviruses are located in the N-terminus of the S1 domain. However, carcinoembryonic antigen cell adhesion molecule (CEACAM) and sugar serve as the receptors for MHV and BCoV, respectively, despite their high sequence homology [6, 7] .",

Its clinical symptoms include watery diarrhea, severe enteritis, vomiting, and weight loss; the mortality rate can reach 50%-90% in suckling piglets [8] [9] [10] . In 1977, Pensaert isolated a new coronavirus-like particle associated with diarrhea from Belgian swine breeding farms. This virus was different from TGEV and was designated CV777 [11] . Subsequently, the disease was reported in the United . Since 2010, massive PED outbreaks have been reported in Asia. In April 2013, there was a sudden occurrence of PED disease that rapidly spread across the United States, causing high rates of death among piglets [8] . Currently, PED is considered a pandemic disease that causes substantial economic losses to pork producers all over the world.",

The PEDV S protein is a homotrimeric membrane glycoprotein that contains a signal peptide (residues 1-20); an S1 region (residues 21-793) that mediates the attachment of virus particles to the cell surface receptor; an S2 region (residues 794-1385) that mediates virus fusion to host cells; a transmembrane domain (residues 1335-1358) and a cytoplasmic tail (residues 1359-1385); the S1 region contains two subdomains, an NTD (residues 21-324) and a CTD (residues 253-638) [14, 15] ( Figure 1A ). Previous studies have confirmed that porcine aminopeptidase N (pAPN) acts as a receptor for PEDV entry into target cells [16] [17] [18] . All characterized coronavirus S1 domain contain an RBD that is responsible for interactions with the cellular receptors for viral attachment. Lee determined that the N-terminus of the PEDV S1 domain was necessary for receptor binding using a co-immunoprecipitation assay; the minimal binding region was confirmed to be located within residues 25-88 [14]. To date, there are no conclusive data concerning the exact location of the PEDV RBD and the key amino acids that participate in receptor binding.",

For example, a six-amino-acid insertion was identified in the variant strain (residues 56-60 and 141) [20, 21] . Amino acid deletions have also been identified within the S1 domain (residues 155, 156, 163, and 164) [13,22].

To compare the receptor-binding activity between the variant field isolate and the prototype strain, a plasmid expressing residues 249-634 of the S1 domain from the CV777 strain was constructed with a C-terminal IgG4 Fc tag. The protein was expressed in insect cells and purified with a Protein G column; a highly purified protein was obtained ( Figure 3B) . Then, the receptor-binding activities of the CHGD-01 S253-638 fragment and the CV777 S249-634 fragment were investigated using a flow cytometry assay, different concentrations of the CHGD-01 S253-638 or the CV777 S249-634 protein including 12.5, 25, and 50 \u03bcg/mL were used for detection. pAPN-transfected cells untreated with protein or treated with IgG4 Fc protein were used as controls.

All of the proteins were successfully expressed, with the exception of the S 1\u00b4252 truncation, which showed a very low level of expression. The highly expressed proteins were purified using a HisTrap HP column ( Figure 6B ). Then, ELISA was performed to detect their binding interactions with bovine mucin, a mixture of highly glycosylated proteins recognized by coronavirus S proteins and containing all of the sugar moieties including 5-N-acetyl-9-O-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5,9Ac2), 5-N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc), and 5-N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac). The results showed that the S 1\u00b4793 , S 1\u00b4324 , S 1\u00b4434 , and S 1\u00b4543 fragments bound to mucin with high affinity, while the S 253\u00b4631 fragment bound to mucin with a much lower affinity, and the S 477\u00b4629 fragment had little binding activity ( Figure 6C ). The results demonstrate that the N-terminal region of the PEDV S1 domain possesses sugar-binding activity.",

RBD sequences and structures vary considerably among different coronaviruses, and they use distinct receptors for virus entry [29] . The RBDs of most coronaviruses are located in the CTD of the S1 domain, especially for Alphacoronaviruses, including TGEV, PRCV, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-NL63. The RBDs from these viruses are all located near the C-terminal region of the S1 domain [29, 30] . Our results are in agreement with previous studies. Hence, we can conclude that the pAPN-binding domain of the PEDV S1 domain is located within its CTD. In Figure 2D ,E, the results of the S 19\u00b4638 and S 477\u00b4629 fragments were not consistent.

Single amino acid mutations in the three loops completely or significantly reduce PRCV RBD binding to pAPN, and the mutations outside the RBD have no effect on receptor recognition [2] . The crystal structure of the HCoV-NL63 RBD-ACE2 complex shows three protruding \u03b2-loops surrounding a shallow bowl-shaped cavity at the top of the RBD that are important for receptor binding. RBM3 (residues 585-590) is more compact than either RBM1 (residues 493-513) or RBM2 (residues 531-541) [4] .

A sugar moiety on cell-surface glycoproteins or glycolipids (i.e., Neu5,9Ac2) can be recognized by BCoV and HCoV-OC43 in the genus Betacoronavirus [6, 32] . Moreover, two other types of sugars (Neu5Gc and Neu5Ac) can serve as receptors or co-receptors for some \u03b1-and Gammacoronaviruses, such as TGEV and IBV [9, 33, 34] . The NTD of the TGEV S1 domain is responsible for its enteric tropism, and the related PRCV, which lacks this domain, does not show enteric tropism [35] . Thus, binding sugar as a co-receptor is linked with the enteric tropism of coronaviruses [36] . In the present study, a flow cytometry assay found that the S 1\u00b4434 and S 253\u00b4533 fragments could weakly bind to pAPN-expressing cells, and that the S 19\u00b4638 fragment revealed a much higher binding affinity, which indicates that except for pAPN recognized by the CTD of the PEDV S1 domain, other cellular molecules, such as sugars, can be recognized by the NTD of the S1 domain as receptors or co-receptors. Similar to TGEV, which uses Neu5Gc and Neu5Ac as co-receptors [33, 36, 37] , we confirmed that the NTD of the PEDV S1 domain can also interact with sugar. Thus, sugar may act as a co-receptor for PEDV.",

            "text": "The variations in coronaviruses are concentrated in the S1 domain [29] . Sequence analysis of PEDV prototype and variant strains revealed more than 100 amino acid mutations within the S protein, especially in the N-terminus, but very few changes are found within the C-terminus [20, 21] . When comparing the RBD sequences between the CHGD-01 and the CV777 strains, only several amino acid mutations were found, so it is reasonable that the pAPN-binding activities of the CHGD-01 and CV777 RBDs are similar. When the sugar-binding activity was compared between the CHGD-01 and the CV777 strains, the CHGD-01 strain showed stronger binding efficiency. This finding is not unreasonable due to the obvious difference in the N-terminal S1 gene sequences between the two strains. Most likely, the mutated amino acids participate in sugar binding. Furthermore, among the many factors that contribute to the infectivity and pathogenicity of PEDV, the enhanced receptor binding activity of the variant strain may play important roles. Prior to 2010, PEDV infection was relatively mild, with sporadic PED outbreaks; however, since late 2010, PED outbreaks have occurred in many countries in Asia and North America [13, 38] . Further studies are warranted to investigate whether the enhanced receptor binding activity of the new variant strain is responsible for the recent PED outbreaks.",

The N-terminal region of the PEDV S1 domain is responsible for binding to sugar, which may act as its co-receptor. The sugar-binding activities of the variant field isolate are stronger than those of the prototype strain. The first and crucial step of virus infection is virus-receptor interaction; thus, investigations on receptor recognition are important for understanding the mechanisms of virus invasion and pathogenesis and will provide rational strategies for developing antiviral drugs, vaccines, and monoclonal antibodies for the treatment and prevention of viral infections.",

(A) Diagram of the codon-optimized full-length S1 and the five truncated S1 variant constructs of the CHGD-01 strain, including the S19-638 fragment, which contains the S1 NTD and CTD; the S1-434 fragment, which contains the S1 NTD; the S253-533 fragment; the S477-629 fragment; and the S253-638 fragment, which is a CTD of S1; (B) Purified truncated S1 variants of CHGD-01 with a C-terminal IgG4 Fc tag, pAPN with a C-terminal His6 tag, and IgG4 Fc proteins were detected by SDS-PAGE; (C) The transfection efficiency was determined by performing an indirect immunofluorescence assay. HEK-293T cells transfected with a pAPN gene-containing plasmid (left) and cells transfected with an empty vector (right) were used for detection. Mouse anti-His monoclonal antibody and Alexa Fluor \u00ae 488 anti-mouse IgG (H + L) antibody were used before detection. The green fluorescence represents the expressed pAPN protein; (D) The binding between five truncated S1 variants and pAPN-expressing cells was investigated by performing flow cytometry. HEK-293T cells were transfected with a pAPN gene-containing plasmid. After 48 h, the cells were resuspended with the S19-638, S253-638, S1-434, S253-533, and S477-629 proteins (50 \u03bcg/mL), followed by treatment with FITC-labeled anti-human IgG4 Fc antibodies. Then FACS was performed. pAPN-transfected cells untreated with protein (grey shade) or treated with IgG4 Fc protein (green shade) were used as controls; (E) An ELISA was performed to detect the binding between five truncated S1 variants and pAPN, IgG4 Fc protein was used as a control. ELISA plates were coated with S19-638, S253-638, S1-434, S253-533, S477-629, or IgG4 Fc proteins and blocked with BSA. The plates were then incubated with the pAPN protein. The TMB substrate was added after incubation with mouse anti-His monoclonal antibody and HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody. The experiment was carried out three times, and the data from a representative experiment are shown. Error bars indicate the standard errors of the means.",
