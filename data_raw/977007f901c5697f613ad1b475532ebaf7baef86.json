However, some reports have suggested that similarity between host proteins and viral proteins (molecular mimicry) leads to immune mediated damage. However, this has not been proved conclusively. Therefore, this study was undertaken to identify if molecular mimicry exists between CHIKV and host components. Using various bioinformatics tools we identified common sequences and structural homology between glycoprotein of the virus and two human host tissue proteins-HLA-B27 molecule and a domain of complement C3. Two peptides having homology to these human tissue components were synthesized. These peptides were recognized by antibodies present in serum of CHIKV patients. Experiments were conducted to investigate if the peptides were capable of inducing pathology in an experimental C57BL/6J mouse model. Both the peptides on their own were able to induce significant inflammation in the muscles of C57BL/6J mice similar to that observed in animals that were injected with CHIKV alone. Additionally, animals that were injected initially with CHIKV followed by a subsequent injection of the two CHIKV peptides exhibited increased pathology as compared to animals that were injected with peptides or virus alone.

            "text": "Introduction Chikungunya fever is caused by a arbovirus belonging to Family Togaviridae and Genus Alphavirus. CHIKV is positive sense RNA virus with about 11.8 kb long genome. The prevalence of CHIKV has increased globally. It caused massive outbreaks when it re-emerged in 2005 in French Reunion islands where it affected about 33% of the total population. CHIKV outbreaks also occurred in India during the same period, southern states in India recorded a total of 1.3 million cases [1, 2] . Chikungunya fever is characterized by fever, headache, myalgia and arthralgia. Though Chikungunya is a self limiting illness [3] , a small proportion of 10-20% of affected individuals develop persistent arthralgia. The risk factors associated with the development of persistent arthralgia include older age of patients (>40 years) and pre existing rheumatic problems. However, the precise molecular mechanisms of pathogenesis that lead to the development of these complications are poorly understood. Experimental evidence of CHIKV persistence in macrophages of Macaca species has been demonstrated [4] and it has been suggested as one of the factors contributing to residual arthralgia. Although, molecular mimicry as the cause of prolonged joint manifestations had not been proved conclusively in Chikungunya infection, there are reports which suggest that such a phenomenon might be operational. Therefore, in this study we investigated the possible occurrence of molecular mimicry between CHIKV E1 and host components using a three pronged strategy: (i) identification of homologous regions between CHIKV proteins and host tissue components using bioinformatics tools, (ii) establishing cross reactivity between serum samples obtained from CHIKV infected patients and peptides exhibiting molecular mimicry and (iii) validating the ability of the cross reactive peptides in inducing joint and muscle pathology in a mouse model. We demonstrate the occurrence of molecular mimicry between CHIKV envelope glycoprotein (E1) and the host components.",

This sequence was uploaded into Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource (IEDB) server available at http://www.immuneepitope.org/. The server predicts the antigenic determinants using five different algorithms-Chou and Fasman beta turn prediction, Emini surface accessibility prediction, Karplus and Schulz flexibility prediction, Kolaskar and Tongoankar antigenicity prediction, Parker hydrophilicity prediction. The antigenic peptides from E1 region were deduced after considering hydrophilicity, surface probability, chain flexibility and secondary structure antigenic index both as text and graphs. The results obtained from the server were combined to construct a graph using MS-EXCEL, which in turn yielded putative epitopic regions of CHIKV E1 glycoprotein. The peaks with antigenic propensity, surface accessibility, flexibility, hydrophilicity and beta turns were considered. The results obtained through IEDB were further confirmed using additional server-European Molecular Biology Open Software Suite (EMBOSS) available at http://liv.bmc.uu.se/cgi-bin/emboss/antigenic. The results obtained using the Chou and Fasman criteria for beta turn prediction was also verified using COUDES server. The existence of sequence similarity between CHIKV E1 glycoprotein and Human HLA-B27 was investigated using BLAST. The existence of structural similarity between the CHIKV E1 glycoprotein and human host components were determined by using BioXGEM server and number of hits obtained in the non-redundant protein database (nrPDB) were limited to first 100 in the output.

For histopathological studies the tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, while for PCR the tissues were collected in EMEM. CHIKV infection was confirmed by two methods-presence of CHIKV specific IgG antibodies in the serum and detection of CHIKV nucleic acid in the serum and harvested tissues using TaqMan real-time PCR [5] . Eight day old pups in Group 3, 4 and 5 were injected with two doses (50\u03bcg /dose) of CHIKV Peptide A, CHIKV Peptide B and Non-specific peptide respectively on day 0 and day 5.

The results are depicted in Fig 1. The scores obtained for the five algorithms were uploaded into an MS Excel sheet to generate a combined graph which yielded the putative epitopic regions of E1 glycoprotein of CHIKV. Analysis of the peaks in the graph with respect to antigenic propensity, surface accessibility, flexibility, hydrophilicity and B turns enabled prediction of the following epitopic regions: These regions of CHIKV E1 glycoprotein satisfy all the criteria necessary for a given peptide to be considered immunogenic and capable of eliciting an immune response in the host system. Subsequently multiple sequence alignment of E1 glycoprotein of Alphaviruses-CHIKV, Onyong Onyong Virus (ONNV), Ross River Virus (RRV), Semiliki Forest Virus (SFV), and Eastern Equine Encephalitis Virus (EEEV) was done through CLUSTALW. The results of the alignment are depicted in Fig 2. As evident from the figure, the alignment revealed two motifs SKD and KCA present only in arthritogenic Alphaviruses (CHIKV,ONNV, RRV) and not in encephalitogenic Alphaviruses (SFV, EEEV). Furthermore, the amino acid sequences SKD and KCA were present in the immunodominant peptides 1 and 2 deduced from E1 glycoprotein respectively.

The inflammation was graded as minimal (1+), mild (2+), moderate (3+) and severe (4+). The salient histopathological features noted in CHIKV infected mice were as follows: (i) the soft tissue around the elbow and knee joints were relatively normal with no evidence of synovitis or arthritis, while tissues close to the shoulder and the hip joint revealed moderate degree of lymphohistiocytic infiltration virus, (ii) the major muscles of the hip and the shoulder had multifocal lymphocytic infiltrate in the endomysium with myonecrosis, (iii) random and occasion muscle fibres close to inflammation revealed cytoplasmic basophilia and central nucleation with prominent nucleolus indicative of regenerative activity, similar to polymyositis noted in human subjects (iv) the synovium and periarticular soft tissue had sparse inflammation while the articular cartilage and the articular cavity were free of inflammation, (v) the epimysium around the muscle and tendinous portion close to the insertion had variable lympho-histiocytic inflammation indicating tenosynovitis, (vi) the striking pathology was mineralization of the necrosed muscle belly especially the lateral group of muscles close to the hip and shoulder joints similar to some cases of chronic polymyositis in human subjects. Other than these features noted in the limbs and joints all the other organs did not reveal any significant pathological changes. Some of the salient features noted in CHIKV infected mice (Group 1) are depicted in Fig 7. The degree of pathological damage centred on the muscles in the various groups of mice was graded and a comparative chart was prepared ( Table 3) . As evident from the table, the group of mice that were mock infected (Group 2) and subsequently did not receive any peptides revealed sparse (1+) inflammation in the muscles probably related to the procedure. Similar findings were also noted in the mock infected animals that received a single dose of Freund's incomplete adjuvant (Group 6). In mice that received two doses of non-specific peptide but no virus (Group 5) hyperplasia of the bone marrow was noted with sparse inflammation (1+). On the other hand, mice that received two doses of CHIKV specific peptides but no virus (Groups 3 & 4) exhibited myositis, muscle necrosis, vasculitis and hyperplasia of the marrow (immune mediated inflammatory muscle and marrow reactive changes) and an overall inflammation score of 3+ (Fig 8) . In the three groups of mice that received an initial inoculum of virus followed by a single dose of either CHIKV specific peptides (Groups 7&8) or non-specific peptide (Group 9) the pathological features were more florid (Fig 9) . Amongst these three groups of animals, the mice that received virus followed by non-specific peptide exhibited features similar to those observed in mice that received virus alone (Group 1). The animals in Groups 7 and 8 had the highest overall inflammatory score (4+) and showed multiple features including myositis, muscle necrosis, focal regeneration, mineralization and calcification of the necrotic muscles, hyperplasia of marrow in the long bones.",

The arthritis attributed to CHIKV infection indeed mimics rheumatoid arthritis, as discussed by Bouquillard et al [14] wherein 21 patients infected with CHIKV in Reunion islands developed RA.

We investigated molecular mimicry in this study by using a combined approach of identifying homologous regions between CHIKV glycoprotein E1 protein and host tissue components using bioinformatics tools, the ability of these designed peptides to cross react with serum samples from CHIKV infected patients and inducing immune mediated joint and muscle pathology in a mouse model.",

The alignment revealed that two common motif(s) SKD and KCA were present only in arthritogenic alphaviruses such as CHIKV, RRV and ONNV but not in the 'encephalitogenic' alphaviruses such as SFV and VEEV (Fig 2) . The presence of these two motifs seen only in arthritogenic alphaviruses lead us to postulate that these two motifs may have a role in the development of arthralgia which is a hallmark in the disease produced by these group of viruses. Simultaneously, the immunodominant epitopes in the CHIKV E1 glycoprotein were deduced using IEDB and EMBOSS programs which use criteria like presence of beta turn, surface accessibility, flexibility, antigenicity and hydrophilicity of the regions to be studied. On combining the common results obtained with these two programs, four immunodominant regions were obtained in CHIKV E1 glycoprotein (Peptide A, B, C and D). Interestingly, it was observed that the \"arthritogenic\" motifs SKD and KCA were also present in the immunodominant Peptides A and B respectively.",

It is a well established that HLA B27 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of autoimmune arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis [16] . Interestingly this consecutive sequence of amino acids was also present in one of the immunodominant peptides (Peptide A) of CHIKV E1 glycoprotein ( Fig  3) . Having ascertained that there is amino acid homology between CHIKV E1 glycoprotein and HLA B27 molecule, the occurrence of structural homology was also explored using the BioXGEM program. This program searches for the longest common substructures existing between the query structure and every structure in the database. The output of the query while executing the program was however limited to the first 100 hits. Amongst these 100 proteins, further analysis was restricted only to human proteins present in the output. Amongst the 20 human proteins in the list (Table 2) , six proteins were shortlisted as they are known to contribute to either inflammation or arthritic pathology. The most prominent amongst them was complement components C3and C5. Indeed, C3 complement component has been implicated in inflammation and tissue injury in other related alphaviral infections [17] and therefore further analysis was confined to the homology between the CHIKV E1 glycoprotein and the C3 complement component. The analysis showed that the homology occurred between Von Willebrand Factor (VWF) domain of C3 and CHIKV E1 glycoprotein (Panel A, Fig 5) . Interestingly, the amino acid sequences in the region of CHIKV E1 glycoprotein exhibiting homology were also present in the immunodominant Peptides A and B (Panel B, Fig 5) . In summary, combining the data from the various bioinformatics approaches and employing a logical algorithm relevant to the pathogenesis of arthritis the choice narrowed down to two immunodominant peptides of CHIKV E protein (Peptides A & B) .Therefore all further experiments were carried out using only these two peptides.The Peptides A and B were used in an ELISA to assess the immunoreactivity of serum samples obtained from CHIKV confirmed patients as well as healthy control subjects. The serum samples obtained from CHIKV confirmed patients (n = 36) showed reactivity to both the peptides to varying degrees. Antibodies to Peptide A was noted in 24/36 (66.66%) of samples while 27/36 (75%) of serum samples showed reactivity to Peptide B (Fig 5) . These results indicate that the two peptides are indeed being recognized by the host immune system during CHIKV infection. As evident form Fig 5, it was interesting to note that the sera from three patients who had persistent arthralgia 12 weeks after the onset of initial symptoms indeed exhibited much higher OD values (0.9 to 1.3 for peptide A and 1.2 for peptide B) to the two peptides A & B as compared to other patients (OD values were close to cut off and between 0.4 and 0.6). Although, a quantitative ELISA would have delineated these differences better our ELISA was designed only as qualitative assay.",

            "text": "Further, experiments were conducted to investigate if peptide A and peptide B were capable of inducing pathology in an experimental mouse model. The results indicated that these two peptides on their own were able to induce significant inflammation in the muscles of C57BL/ 6J mice (Fig 8 and Table 3 ) similar to that observed in animals (3+) that were injected with CHIKV. Further, animals that were primed initially with CHIKV followed by a subsequent injection of the two CHIKV peptides exhibited enhanced inflammatory pathology (4+) as compared to animals that were injected with peptides or virus alone (Fig 9 and Table 3 ). On the contrary, animals that received an unrelated peptide (i.e. not containing the arthritogenic motifs or exhibiting homology to host proteins) either before or after priming with CHIKV exhibited minimal muscle inflammation (1+). Collectively these observations validate the hypothesis that molecular mimicry between CHIKV E1 protein and host proteins does contribute to pathology in CHIKV infection. Such observations have not been reported hitherto in CHIKV infection although molecular mimicry as a mechanism leading to autoimmune phenomena has been demonstrated in several microbial infections including viruses and bacteria [18] . Among the viruses, molecular mimicry has been noted in Theiler murine encephalitis virus (TMEV), Hepatitis B virus (HBV), and SFV and Coxsackie viral infections [11] . In SFV infection of C57BL/6J mice a similar approach using bioinformatic tools derived peptides and validation of these peptides invivo for their ability to induce autoimmune demyelination was undertaken [19] . An algorithmic approach was used to demonstrate amino acid homology between immunogenic epitopes of SFV and various myelin proteins. The criterion used for the occurrence of molecular mimicry was the presence of three similar consecutive amino acids. It was observed that myelin oligodendrocyte protein (MOG) shared homology with SFV E2 glycoprotein. The injection of a peptide containing the sequence of shared amino acids into mice caused demyelination with presence of multifocal vacuolation in the CNS white matter [19] . The phenomenon of molecular mimicry has also been studied in SARS infection [20] . Eleven peptides derived from SARS spike(S) protein which shared homology with various human proteins were synthesised and their reactivity was assessed using serum samples obtained from SARS patients. Serum samples recognised only 2/11 peptides and the authors concluded that these two peptides may contribute to viral pathogenesis through the phenomena of molecular mimicry.",

            "text": "The limitations of the present study are twofold. Firstly, HLA-B27 typing was not performed in the CHIKV confirmed patients and controls of this study. However, serum reactivity of Peptide A which shared homology with HLA B27 molecule suggests that this molecule may have an important role to play in persistent arthralgia as 3/36 patients exhibited high reactivity to it. The geographical and ethnic variation in the prevalence of HLA-B27 globally is well documented [21] and further its occurrence in CHIKV related complications is also reported to be very low [15, 22] . Therefore it may be argued that the observance of molecular mimicry between CHIV E1 glycoprotein and HLA-B27 may not be the major factor contributing to complications that ensue following acute infection. Secondly, the time interval between the injection of CHIKV and the peptides into animal the model (Groups 7& 8) is rather short rendering it difficult to conclude whether the inflammatory response noted was due to the immunopathologic process of molecular mimicry or a direct inflammatory effect of both the virus and the peptide. However, the muscle fibrosis and calcification in the muscles noted in the experimental animals recapitulates immune mediated polymyositis in humans during the evolution and progression. The other limitation with all studies conducted using animal models to demonstrate molecular mimicry as a mechanism of pathogenesis is that an adjuvant such as CFA/FICA is invariably required to elicit immune mediated damage. This suggests that in addition to having cross reacting disease inducing epitopes, sufficient activation of antigen presenting cells is required. Consequently, the most difficult part in the studies investigating molecular mimicry is to correlate/extrapolate the findings obtained in vitro and/or animal studies to the disease occurring in the natural host. Despite this limitation, the concept of molecular mimicry remains a viable hypothesis for framing questions and approaches to understanding the pathogenetic mechanisms involved during the disease process. Therefore, it would be definitely worthwhile to pursue future studies with the two CHIKV peptides described in this study using transgenic animal models and human T and B cell responses to the peptides.",
