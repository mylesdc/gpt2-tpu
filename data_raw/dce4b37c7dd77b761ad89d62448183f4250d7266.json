We extract and analyze data from 93 studies published between 2007-2013 to examine factors that increase success of viral discovery in bats, and specific trends and patterns of infection across host taxa and viral families. Over the study period, 248 novel viruses from 24 viral families have been described. Using generalized linear models, at a study level we show the number of host species and viral families tested best explained number of viruses detected. We demonstrate that prevalence varies significantly across viral family, specimen type, and host taxonomy, and calculate mean PCR prevalence by viral family and specimen type across all studies. Using a logistic model, we additionally identify factors most likely to increase viral detection at an individual level for the entire dataset and by viral families with sufficient sample sizes. Our analysis highlights major taxonomic gaps in recent bat viral discovery efforts and identifies ways to improve future viral pathogen detection through the design of more efficient and targeted sample collection and screening approaches.",

            "text": "Beyond the issue of whether bats are \"special\" in their ability to be reservoirs for zoonotic viruses, there has also been a dramatic increase in the number of general bat viral discovery studies published in the last decade. However, despite the importance of discovering and characterizing novel bat pathogens, at an individual study level most of these efforts have been opportunistic or ad hoc in the taxonomic groups and viruses examined. To date, there has been no concerted effort to collate and analyze the methods and findings from these disparate studies using a quantitative approach. Here, we synthesize and analyze patterns of viral discovery in bats from recently published data with the aim of creating a more systematic and efficient approach to identifying novel pathogens. We analyze data from 93 peer-reviewed papers from 2007-2013 using generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) and other approaches to assess the 'success' of viral discovery, as well as the probability of detecting a positive sample at an individual level. We identify the study-level variables and methodologies most important for efficient viral discovery, such as specimen type, number of bats sampled, assays used, and bat and viral taxonomy, and explore possible routes of viral shedding and prevalence levels by viral family. We explore several overarching questions, including: what are the overall trends in bat viral discovery over the time period; how many novel viruses were detected over the study period; is viral discovery biased by host or viral taxonomy; what specimen types are most likely to yield specific viruses; and does lethal vs. non-lethal sampling affect the probability of viral detection or the composition of the viral communities discovered?",

We compiled a separate database with individual data points, where each record in our database (2,565 rows) represented a unique interaction between a virus, host species, sample type, and assay used (S2 Dataset).

In three instances, the number of individual bats that tested positive for a virus was not reported, and multiple specimens were positive in multiple species [17] [18] [19] . In these cases, we assumed an equal distribution of positive individuals across species. When the total number of bats was not explicitly stated but organ tissue specimens were taken, the total number of bats was assumed to be the total number of specimens [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . When it was not explicitly stated whether the bats captured were lethally sampled, contextual clues were used to assume whether they were or were not sacrificed (e.g., if organ tissue was collected, it was assumed the animals were sacrificed unless explicitly stated that organ biopsies were non-lethal). To address the possibility of sharing of samples among research groups, comparisons were made of authors lists as well as descriptions of the data, including year(s) collected, location collected, and number of specimens collected. Where stated, it was noted whether samples were from archival tissues. Studies that used the same specimens or subsets of specimens were identified and removed. Finally, bats that were found already dead or dying were categorized as non-lethal sampling. This occurred in fifteen studies, with the majority of cases being samples taken from bats that had been found and taken to rehabilitation centers and subsequently died.",

After testing for collinearity among the response variables in the study-level data, the total number of individual bats in a study was excluded from the model due to its covariance with the number of bat species (r = 0.70, p<0.0001) and the number of specimens tested (r = 0.92, p<0.0001). Explanatory variables included in the full study-level model were: number of species tested, proportion of bats sacrificed, number of total specimens in the study, and number of viral families tested in the study ( Table 1) . Potential confounders such as seasonality were not addressed in our models, as our analysis was limited to raw data from published studies, and most studies did not include the date of collection of individual specimens in their analyses. Backward stepwise methods for variable selection were used along with ranking by Akaike information criterion (AIC) values to identify the best models [26] . We checked modelfitting assumptions using goodness of fit tests including: likelihood ratio \u03c7 2 tests to assess whether the restricted model fit the data as well as the full model; examination of residual versus fitted value and Q-Q plots; and assessing estimates and confidence intervals for odds ratios for each model (data not shown).",

We found that the number of bat viruses discovered over time has increased, and~250 putatively novel viruses were discovered over the study period. However, we identify significant surveillance biases over this period, and Optimizing Viral Discovery in Bats highlight these taxonomic gaps as opportunities for future research in the coming decade. While viruses from 24 viral families were identified in 17 bat families across all studies, only a small fraction of surveillance space (~25% of bat taxa-viral family dyads) was examined, and viral richness varied across host taxonomy at a bat family and bat genus level. This later observation is a likely driven by a combination of both differences in host species richness and host abundance and feasibility of capture (e.g. Vespertilionidae bats are the second largest mammalian family and geographically the most widespread bat family [8] ), but it may also reflect inherent differences in viral richness among bat species based on life history and ecological traits [9, 28, 29] . However, our models excluded host taxonomy as a significant predictor of whether or not a given specimen would be positive. We further showed that mean viral prevalence did not significantly differ across bat families even though some bat taxa were much more heavily sampled than others and had subsequently greater observed viral richness.",

For example, the output or response variables were not directly comparable (thousands of short sequence reads often grouped by viral family for NGS studies versus definitive positive or negatives for PCR screening and sequencing studies).

Existing platforms, e.g. Luminex and LIPS assays, should be expanded to include novel pathogens recently discovered in bats that are of high interest [31, 32] . However, serological testing to detect certain viruses in bats should be interpreted with caution, as there are several potential limitations to serological assays. Most notably, cross-reactivity of antibodies to multiple pathogens can lead to decreased assay specificity and confounding results for closely related viruses [33] .

Notably, both the proportion of bats sacrificed and the number of specimens examined both dropped out of the final fitted model when both the number of total and novel viruses were used as response variables. This suggests that viral discovery efforts will be maximized by including more species of bats, instead of (or in addition to) more specimens of individuals from the same bat species. While not an entirely novel finding, these data suggest that we have not yet saturated the bat viral discovery curve for most species. This was demonstrated by intensive sampling in a single species of bat (Pteropus giganteus) which produced the discovery of 55 viruses from seven viral families, and showed that nearly 7,000 specimens are required to fully saturate the viral discovery curve for that species [34] . While Anthony et al. collected over 2,000 specimens over four years; less than 20% of the studies in our analysis had sample sizes greater than 1,000. While the intensive approach of longitudinal sampling and collection of thousands of specimens might be ideal for quantifying the total diversity of viruses in a bat species, our findings suggests that for studies without extensive resources, including more species of bats and testing a broader number of viral families alone are efficient ways to discover more viruses.",

Recent data from experimental studies show that Marburg virus is shed in the saliva of Rousettus sp. bats [35] , which points to a non-lethal specimen type that may be productive for Filovirus detection and discovery in the future.

            "text": "We provide a synopsis and quantitative review of the burgeoning field of bat virology, with implications for how future viral discovery studies in bats are designed, including how specimens are collected and whether or not bats should be sacrificed to obtain specimens. Lethal sampling does not appear to increase success of obtaining a positive viral detection, and future studies may focus on developing improved non-lethal sampling methods, thereby helping to ensure conservation of bat populations. We show clear differences in viral prevalence and detection probability by specimen type and host taxonomy, and identified taxonomic gaps where viruses have not been screened and in those where viruses have been screened but not yet discovered. We hope these data will begin to streamline future viral discovery efforts through more targeted collection of specimens, obtaining statistically significant, adequately powered sample sizes, increased research for currently under-represented bat taxa, and in targeting laboratory assays to the species and specimens most likely to result in pathogen detection and discovery.",
