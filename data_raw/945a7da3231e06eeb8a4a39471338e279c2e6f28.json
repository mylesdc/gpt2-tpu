Only scarce information is available about the diversity of viruses present in the faeces of pigs. Here we describe a protocol, which was optimized for the purification of the total fraction of viral particles from pig faeces. The genomes of the purified DNA and RNA viruses were simultaneously amplified by PCR and subjected to deep sequencing followed by bioinformatic analyses. The efficiency of the method was monitored using a process control consisting of three bacteriophages (T4, M13 and MS2) with different morphology and genome types. Defined amounts of the bacteriophages were added to the sample and their abundance was assessed by quantitative PCR during the preparation procedure.",

All of the added bacteriophages were identified by sequence analysis of the reads. In total, 7.7% of the reads showed significant sequence identities with published viral sequences. They mainly originated from bacteriophages (73.9%) and mammalian viruses (23.9%); 0.8% of the sequences showed identities to plant viruses. The most abundant detected porcine viruses were kobuvirus, rotavirus C, astrovirus, enterovirus B, sapovirus and picobirnavirus. In addition, sequences with identities to the chimpanzee stool-associated circular ssDNA virus were identified. Whole genome analysis indicates that this virus, tentatively designated as pig stool-associated circular ssDNA virus (PigSCV), represents a novel pig virus.",

            "text": "About 191 million pigs are kept in Europe as farm animals [1] . As they provide a crucial source of food worldwide, viruses directly affecting the pig health have a great impact on food production in general. In addition, pigs are a natural habitat for zoonotic viruses, which can cause infectious diseases in humans, such as influenza virus [2] , rotavirus [3] and hepatitis E virus [4] . Other viruses present in pigs such as bacteriophages or viruses causing subclinical infections may affect the pig health indirectly, e.g. by modification of the bacterial population or by modulation of the immune system as also shown for other hosts [5, 6] . In order to understand the complex interaction between the different viruses, their host cells and the immune system, a simultaneous analysis of a broad range of virus species in a distinct compartment is desirable. For a long time, such an analysis was hampered by technical limitations [7] . Recently, this problem was solved by the development of novel molecular approaches utilizing deep sequencing techniques, e.g. 454 pyrosequencing [8] . This technique enables the simultaneous analysis of thousands of sequences present in a DNA sample. Deep sequencing techniques have been frequently used to study the composition of microbial communities in different kinds of environmental samples including faeces of humans and animals [9] [10] [11] . They have also been applied to the detection of single known and unknown viruses in various kinds of samples [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] .",

Despite this common backbone, the protocols differ from each other in several details. For example, different methods are used for purification and concentration of virus particles. As the virus particles are very heterogeneous in shape and size [23] , the applied filtration method will strongly influence the result of the analysis. Moreover, the genomes of viruses consist of either DNA or RNA, which additionally may appear in different topologies [23] . Most of the protocols analyse DNA and RNA separately [13, 17, 21, 22] , which makes the comparison between both groups of viruses difficult. In many of the protocols, various amplification steps, which may affect the distribution of the different genome types, are implemented. In addition, either primary sequence reads or contigs assembled from these sequence reads were used for analysis. All of these variations in the applied protocols may lead to different results. Indeed, the reported composition of the human viral gut community varies remarkably, which -beside other factors -may also be caused by application of different protocols for its analysis [17] [18] [19] 21] .",

M13 is a filamentous phage and contains a small genome of single-stranded DNA. MS2 has a small icosahedral capsid containing a genome of singlestranded RNA. Using these three bacteriophages, the most common genome types were covered by the process control. All phages were added to the pig faecal suspension at a defined concentration. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) protocols were established for these bacteriophages (Tab. 2), which enabled detection and quantification of the viruses at each step of purification. By comparison of the determined genome copy number at the end of the purification process with the number at the beginning, the efficacy of the purification protocol was calculated.",

For example, a prolonged centrifugation time for removal of larger debris resulted in a marked loss of bacteriophage T4, whereas bacteriophages M13 and MS2 were less affected. Figure 1 shows the original qRT-PCR plots of the three bacteriophages from this purification step before and after centrifugation at 17,0006 g for 5 hours. However, further processing of the sample by TFF without prior centrifugation was not practicable because of the appearance of filter occlusions. Therefore, a shorter centrifugation of three hours was used, although this might result in some loss of virus particles with high densities.",

While DNase I digestion had only little effects on the control bacteriophages, treatment with RNase A led to a significant decrease in the detectable genome number of bacteriophage MS2, which may be explained by the presence of residual RNase activity in the final nucleic acid preparation. Therefore, treatment with RNase was omitted in the final protocol. Tests with naked RNA prepared from bacteriophage MS2 that was added to pig faecal samples showed that the RNA was no longer detectable by qRT-PCR after 30 minutes of incubation at room temperature, suggesting that RNase treatment is not necessary at later steps. Although nucleic acid amplification should be omitted to avoid errors caused by PCR, the optimized method contains an amplification step at the end of the procedure. This step had to be introduced, because the yield of nucleic acids was too low for direct use in deep sequencing. In order to minimize the amplification steps, aliquots were taken from different PCR cycles to determine the minimum amplification needed. A general scheme of the working steps in the optimized protocol is presented in Fig. 2 . Applying this protocol, recovery rates of 4%, 125% and 105% were obtained for the genomes of T4, M13 and MS2, respectively, by comparing qRT-PCR results after addition of the phages with those from the final nucleic acid preparation.",

An assignment of the sequences to known viral families was performed by application three different calculations (Tab. 5). Using the primary reads only, the most abundant virus families were Siphoviridae (30.1%), Microviridae (21.7 %) and Myoviridae (11.3%), all of them representing bacteriophages. Using the contigs only, three bacteriophage families were again most prominent, but with different percentages: 33.1% Siphoviridae, 14.9% Myoviridae and 9.1% Podoviridae. The maximum identities between the deduced amino acid sequences of the contigs with the lowest tBLASTx E scores and that of known members of the respective virus families ranged from 35% to 100% (Tab. 5). The lengths of the viral genomes are remarkably different between different virus families [23] and it can be assumed that longer genomes are represented by more primary reads per genome than smaller ones. Therefore, a correction factor for the genome length was introduced to give estimation for the particle number. After this correction, the most abundant viral families were Microviridae (bacteriophages, 45.9%) followed by the Chimpanzee stool associated circular ssDNA virus (ChiSCV, see below, 12.0%) and Picornaviridae (mammalian viruses, 10.8%) (Fig. 3C ).

The genome of this virus has a length of 2,459 nucleotides and a circular topology (Fig. 4A) . A total of 6 ORFs encoding proteins consisting of more than 100 amino acids were identified. The protein encoded by ORF1 shows the highest amino acid sequence identity (27.0%) to the replicase protein (Rep) of ChiSCV (Gen-Bank Acc.-No. ABD24829.1).

            "text": "To overcome the problem of comparability, we here suggest the use of a process control for monitoring the efficiency of the protocol applied for the analysis. The process control consists of a set of previously characterized viruses, of which a defined number is added to the sample and then followed during the process. Similar process controls are well established in other analytical applications, such as PCR analysis of food and environmental samples [28] [29] [30] . For the application in analysis of viral communities, the process control should reflect the variety of viruses with different morphologies and genome types, which can be suspected to be present in the sample. The three selected bacteriophages used here are diverse in these aspects and represent a large proportion of known viruses. However, some morphologies, e.g. enveloped spherical viruses, as well as some genome types, e.g. double-stranded RNA, are not present so far and may be added in future in order to improve the process control. As a proof of principle, we could demonstrate that all of the bacteriophages added to the sample could be identified in the sequences generated by deep sequencing. This indicates that the bacteriophages could be monitored throughout the whole process until its end, which includes sequence analysis. Using the recovery rates or sequence read numbers of the control bacteriophages, a comparison of results from studies performed with different techniques should be possible in the future. Although in principle the three used bacteriophages seem to be appropriate for monitoring the efficiency of the process, the low recovery rate of bacteriophage T4 demand further developments for a robust dsDNA virus control. Since the majority of viral sequences identified in our analysis of the pig faecal sample originate from dsDNA viruses, the bacteriophage T4 control may not sufficiently reflect the behaviour of many dsDNA viruses. Therefore, changes in the preparation protocol for bacteriophage T4 (e.g. by adding steps preventing aggregation of virus particles) or a replacement by another virus should be considered in the future. The process control was also used as a read-out for optimization of the distinct steps of the method. By this, it could be confirmed that some of the techniques applied in former studies, e.g. tangential flow filtration [31, 32] , are more effective than others. Besides minor variations of parameters in order to assess the optimal conditions for each step, some more basic decisions had to be made during the optimization process. One of them refers to the use of an RNase digestion step to remove contaminating free RNA from the virus particle suspension. As high amounts of RNase are difficult to inactivate or to remove from the preparation, residual RNase activity can destroy the viral RNA in the final nucleic acid preparation [32] . We show that free bacteriophage RNA is rapidly degraded in the faecal suspension within the first 30 minutes of the applied protocol; therefore, RNase treatment seems not necessary at later steps. A second decision refers to the use of amplification steps after preparation of the nucleic acids. It is known that some techniques induce changes in the relative distribution of viral genome types, e.g. several isothermal amplification methods preferentially amplify small circular DNA molecules [33] . To avoid extensive amplification steps, a relatively high amount of starting material (100 g faeces) was used here. However, the yield of purified virus nucleic acid was too low for direct use in deep sequencing. Therefore, amplification was implemented in the protocol; however, the cycles were limited to the lowest possible number. The identification of all known viral genome types in the primary sequence reads of the pig faecal sample analyzed here indicate that the optimized protocol is suitable for simultaneous identification of DNA viruses and RNA viruses in pig faeces. By application of the optimized protocol to the pooled pig faecal sample, we detected 7.7% sequences with a high sequence identity to known virus genomes. This value is similar to that of recently published viral metagenome studies, which range from 2% [18] to 13% [22] . The slight difference between our study and that of Shan et al. [22] , which both analyzed pig faecal samples, may be explained by the use of different databases and different sequence identity cut-offs. In other aspects, the results of both studies are similar. For example, Shan et al. identified 99% of the mammalian viruses as RNA viruses, which is similar to the value of 96% obtained in our study. Kobuvirus, enterovirus, sapovirus, teschovirus, astrovirus and bocavirus were identified in both studies. The similarity of these results is quite surprising taking into consideration that the samples analyzed in both studies originated from pigs from different continents. However, some differences still exist as coronavirus was only found by Shan et al. [22] and rotavirus was only detected in our study. The detection of rotaviruses, which are known as causative agents of gastroenteritis in pigs [34, 35] , correlates with the fact that some of the pigs included in our study suffered from watery diarrhoea. In the study of Shan et al. [22] , a correlation was found between the detection of bocavirus or coronavirus and the appearance of diarrhoea. Additionally, we detected a higher number of different virus families, compared to the study of Shan et al. [22] , which may be explained by the use of a higher amount of faeces as starting material enabling detection of less represented viruses.",

            "text": "An additional factor with marked influence on the results of metagenomic analyses is the applied method for data analysis. First, a reliable cut-off for selection of sequences with significant sequence identities to known virus sequences has to be defined. Here, a tBLASTx E score , = 10 24 was used, according to other studies applying tBLASTx E scores between 10 23 [20, 21] and 10 25 [16, 18] . However, using this cut-off, many sequences with relative low deduced amino acid sequence identities were included in the analysis (Tab. 5). In addition, it has to be considered that the analysis of deduced amino acid sequences may not be appropriate in the case of sequences representing non-coding regions of viral genomes. Second, it should be decided, whether primary reads or contigs are used. In our study, the overall distribution of viral genome types or virus families was rather similar when using primary reads or contigs for analysis. However, analysis of the contigs only may lead to a reduction of detected virus diversity, as the rare sequences of less represented viruses cannot be assembled into contigs. Indeed, by using the primary reads we could identify 447 different virus species, compared to 121 viruses identified by the use of contigs. The Shannon index of diversity determined using the primary reads was 4.777 compared to 4.252 using contigs. As additionally contig assembly is strongly dependent on the used assembly algorithm [36, 37] , it may be generally advisable to use primary reads for metagenomic data analysis. A third factor influencing results of data analysis refers to the highly diverse viral genome length. As a larger genome type is likely to be represented by more primary reads per genome than a smaller one, correction factors should be developed and included. We could show that the use of such correction factors can dramatically change the calculated distribution of viral families leading to a much higher abundance of mammalian viruses (with small genomes) than calculated without consideration of genome length. By application of the optimized protocol and subsequent data analysis, sequences with similarities to a chimpanzee virus have been identified in the pig faeces. Subsequent amplification and analysis of the whole genome sequence indicate that this virus is closely related to the chimpanzee virus [38] . The two largest ORFs clearly show sequence similarities to the encoded replicase and capsid proteins of the chimpanzee virus, but their orientation in the genome is different and the percentages of the sequence identity are relatively low. As such virus sequences have not yet been described in pigs, it is concluded that it represents a novel pig virus. Analysis of samples from the pigs used in our experiment indicated that all of the piglets were infected with this virus, but the amounts and time-points of virus excretion in the faeces differed between the individuals. The different pattern of virus excretion in pigs receiving the same feed argues against an origin of the virus from infected plants that were ingested and excreted after intestinal passage, as originally suspected as one possibility for ChiSCV [38] , although the feed could not be directly tested. No PigSCV genome was detected in the serum of the pigs; however, only one time-point could be analyzed because of the limited availability of the sera. Further studies are necessary in order to assess the origin, dissemination, organ distribution and clinical significance of this novel virus in pigs. PigSCV belongs to the single-stranded circular DNA viruses, which are increasingly detected in animals, plants and environmental samples [39] [40] [41] . The reason for this increased detection is unknown so far; however, it may be explained by the increased use of specific amplification methods in the detection protocols, which are known to amplify circular DNA molecules more efficiently than others [33] . Shan et al. [22] also found several single-stranded circular DNA virus sequences in pig faeces, though, with identities to circoand cycloviruses. Although the detection of the novel virus indicates the suitability of the protocol for detection of so far unknown viruses, it has to be clearly stated, that only those viruses can be identified, for which sequence data of related viruses are present in the databases. For the identification of members of totally new virus families, novel analytical tools have to be developed using ''deep bioinformatics'', e.g. functional predictions of putative proteins.",

Briefly, approximately 100 g of pig faeces were resuspended in 1,000 ml SM-buffer by magnetic stirring. Thereafter, 1610 7 plaque-forming units of each bacteriophage were added to the suspension. Aliquots of the faecal suspension were taken before and after adding of phages and tested at a later date by qRT-PCR. The sample was centrifuged at 17,0006 g for 30 min to remove the large particulate debris and the supernatant was collected. The procedure was repeated by a three hour centrifugation to remove smaller particular structures. Afterwards, a first TFF was performed using a 0.22 mm filter (PALL Corporation, Middleton; MA, USA) to remove bacterial and eukaryotic cells and debris. The remaining filtrate was subjected to a second TFF with a 50 kDa filter (PALL Corporation, Middleton; MA, USA) to concentrate the virus particles. This viral preparation was further concentrated by centrifugation through Vivaspin 50,000 MWCO concentrators (Sartorius Stedim Biotech GmbH, Goetting, Germany) at 1,5006 g resulting in a final volume of 36 ml. Volumes of 18 ml each were loaded onto a stepwise CsCl density gradient with density layers of 1.7, 1.5, 1.35 and 1.2 g ml 21 (each 5 ml) and centrifuged at 65,0006 g for 14 hours at 10uC. The 1.35-1.5 g ml -1 layers were collected from the gradients using a syringe and pooled resulting in a final volume of 9 ml.",

Thereafter, DNA and RNA were simultaneously extracted from 200 ml using the RTP H Pathogen Kit (Invitek; Berlin, Germany). The extracted nucleic acids (75 ng per reaction) were randomly primed for cDNA synthesis using the TransPlex H Complete Whole Transcriptom Amplification Kit (WTA2, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) according to the protocol recommended by the supplier; however, the annealing temperature was decreased to 40uC (cycles 1 and 2) and 45uC (cycles 3 and 4) to enable the simultaneous amplification of DNA and RNA. Aliquots of 75 ml each were removed from the WTA reaction at different cycle numbers, and purified as well as size-selected using MobiSpin S-400 Columns (MoBiTec, Goetting, Germany). The DNA concentration of the preparations was measured using a nanodrop spectrometer (PEQLAB Biotechnologie GMBH; Erlangen Germany) and the preparation derived from a minimum of amplification cycles with a DNA concentration higher than 50 ng/ ml was used for deep sequencing.

This local database was created using EXCEL (2003) . It included the viral genome non-redundant reference sequence nucleotide database (RefSeq, NCBI, ftp://ftp. ncbi.nih.gov/refseq/release/viral/ 30.08.2011 download) and additional sequences from recently discovered viruses, which had been manually added. BLAST results with an E-value , = 10 24 were selected and used for further grouping analysis, which was performed using a script manually written with R 2.13 [46] . This analysis included counting of detected species and determination of their taxonomy, which was also used to determine the virus hosts. Correction of the different genome length of the virus families was done by using the formula: formal size factor = read number/ genome size (the genome size for the respective virus species was derived from the above mentioned local database, which included these data from the RefSeq database, NCBI). The Shannon index [47] was calculated to compare the diversity of the species identified by primary reads and by assembled contigs.",
