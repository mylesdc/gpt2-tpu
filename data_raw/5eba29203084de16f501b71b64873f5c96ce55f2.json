            "text": "Ovine rinderpest or goat plague is an economically important and contagious viral disease of sheep and goats, caused by the Peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV). Differences in susceptibility to goat plague among different breeds and water buffalo exist. The host innate immune system discriminates between pathogen associated molecular patterns and self antigens through surveillance receptors known as Toll like receptors (TLR). We investigated the role of TLR and cytokines in differential susceptibility of goat breeds and water buffalo to PPRV. We examined the replication of PPRV in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of Indian domestic goats and water buffalo and demonstrated that the levels of TLR3 and TLR7 and downstream signalling molecules correlation with susceptibility vs resistance. Naturally susceptible goat breeds, Barbari and Tellichery, had dampened innate immune responses to PPRV and increased viral loads with lower basal expression levels of TLR 3/7. Upon stimulation of PBMC with synthetic TLR3 and TLR7 agonists or PPRV, the levels of proinflammatory cytokines were found to be significantly higher while immunosuppressive interleukin (IL) 10 levels were lower in PPRV resistant Kanni and Salem Black breeds and water buffalo at transcriptional level, correlating with reduced viralloads in infected PBMC. Water buffalo produced higher levels of interferon (IFN) a in comparison with goats at transcriptional and translational levels. Pre-treatment of Vero cells with human IFNa resulted in reduction of PPRV replication, confirming the role of IFNa in limiting PPRV replication. Treatment with IRS66, a TLR7 antagonist, resulted in the reduction of IFNa levels, with increased PPRV replication confirming the role of TLR7. Single nucleotide polymorphism analysis of TLR7 of these goat breeds did not show any marked nucleotide differences that might account for susceptibility vs resistance to PPRV. Analyzing other host genetic factors might provide further insights on susceptibility to PPRV and genetic polymorphisms in the host.",

The disease is characterized by high fever, nasal and ocular discharges, pneumonia, necrotic and ulcerative lesions of the mucus membranes and inflammation of the gastro-intestinal tract [1] . PPRV infection results in great economic losses and affects productivity of sheep and goats subsequent to the global eradication of Rinderpest [2] . For example, in 2004, the economic cost of PPRV in India was estimated to be 1800 million Indian rupees (US$ 39 million) per year [2, 3] . PPRV replication and seroconversion has been demonstrated in large ruminants [4] . There is a solitary report on clinical PPRV occurring in water buffalo [5] , although it has not been confirmed in later studies. In September 2004, outbreaks of PPR in Sudan affected both sheep and camels [6] .",

Goats appear not to be affected in some outbreaks, while sheep suffer with high rates of mortality and morbidity [10] . Strain specific virulence of PPRV has been reported when the same breed of goats were experimentally infected [11] , and different breeds of goat have been shown to respond differently to infection with the same virus [12] . Speciesspecific disease occurrence has been observed with foot and mouth disease, where cattle were highly affected while sheep had less severe infection with the virus [13] . Epizootic haemorrhagic disease virus affects cattle but sheep do not suffer from this disease [14] . It is well recognised that ducks were generally resistant to avian influenza virus (AIV) whereas chickens suffer from severe disease with rapid death following infection with highly pathogenic AIV [15] . The reason for this species specificity is unclear at present.",

Imiquimod and poly I:C are standard agonists used to induce TLR7 and TLR3 respectively leading to the production of inflammatory cytokines including type I interferons (IFN) and immune cell maturation [20, 21] . TLR are differentially expressed in various tissues and immune cells of water buffalo and goats, and have been shown to induce differential immune responses [22, 23] . The cell specific location and basal expression levels of TLR mRNA could indicate the natural PAMP load of that tissue as well the innate host resistance to pathogens [24] .",

Poly I:C and imiquimod treated PBMC, similarly, showed higher production of TNFa and IFNa in Kanni and Salem black breeds than in Barbari suggesting TLR3 and TLR7 engagement by PPRV. To determine whether there are differences in the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines between water buffalo and goats, we examined the levels of these after infecting respective PBMC with PPRV. Increased mRNA levels of IL1b and IFNa in buffalo PBMC and IL10, IL12p40 and IFNc in goat PBMCs were observed. IFNa activation was greater in buffalo than in goats, 2360 vs 1498 fold, respectively ( Figure 4D ). To further confirm this observation, IFNa protein levels were assayed from culture To further define the association between differential PPRV replication and IFNa expression, the ability of IFNa in limiting the viral replication was confirmed in cells treated with human recombinant IFNa. The mean 40 -corrected Ct value of PPRV H gene expression in Vero cells without IFNa treatment was 12.1060.42. Upon pre-treatment of Vero cells with increasing concentrations of IFNa, PPRV H gene expression decreased.

The TLR7 gene was amplified and seven overlapping PCR amplicons were sequenced to obtain the full length TLR7 gene using the goat TLR7 sequence from GenBank as a template (Accession # GU289401). The sequences obtained for Barbari, Tellicherry and Kanni goat breeds were submitted to GenBank (Accession # KC127658, KC127659, KC127660, KC127661, KC127662, KC127663, KC127657). Nucleotide variations were detected across goat breeds. Sequence analysis revealed five nucleotide changes in the TLR7 coding region and two nucleotide changes in the 39 untranslated region (39UTR). Changes were observed at nucleotide positions 777 (C/T in Salem while C/C in other breeds), 2082 (A/A in Salem while A/G in other breeds), 2730 (C/T in Barbari while C/C in other breeds), 3006 (A/A in Tellicherry while A/G in other breeds) and 3069 (G/A in Barbari while G/G in other breeds) that corresponded to amino acid positions 259, 694, 910, 1002 and 1023. However, all of these changes were synonymous and no amino acid changes were observed between different goat breeds. In addition, two changes in the 39UTR, at nucleotide positions 151 (G/A in Barbari and Salem while G/G in other two breeds) and 161 (G/A in Barbari while G/G in other breeds) were also observed.",

Virus recognition can be influenced by genetic mutations in the interaction domains between virus and host receptors. In particular, non-MHC genetic variations in host TLR may cause reduced pathogen recognition and hamper innate immune activation [36] .

TLR3 is a key sensor of viral infection, as most viruses will produce dsRNA at some stage of its life cycle. TLR7 is highly expressed in immune cells like plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC), which produce substantial amounts of type I IFNs in response to viral RNA. In our study, the basal levels of TLR3 and TLR7 were significantly higher in the PBMCs of PPRV resistant goat breeds, Kanni and Salem Black. Engagement of both TLR3 and TLR7 with the synthetic ligands poly I:C and imiquimod respectively, led to the suppression of PPRV RNA and infectious virus yield in PBMC of goats. This indicates that TLR3 and 7 play a role in the recognition of PPRV RNA by goat PBMC, though the role of cytosolic RNA sensors like Retinoic acidinducible gene 1 (RIGI) and Melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) have not been analyzed in this study and cannot be ruled out. Almost complete abrogation of viral gene expression was observed after stimulation by poly I:C.

However, we did see virus replication in infected PBMC although at considerably reduced levels suggesting that the cells of water buffalo are permissive to PPRV infection. Therefore, we questioned whether these differences are reflected at the level of multi-cycle virus replication. PPRV replication in water buffalo PBMC was significantly lower than in goats, possibly because of enhanced type I IFN production in these species upon virus infection. PPRV replication in human IFNa pre-treated Vero cells or in PBMC pre-treated with CM from virus infected cells was significantly lower even at very low doses, confirming the role of type I IFN in limiting virus replication. Human IFNa has been shown to effectively suppress the replication of bovine viral diarrhea virus and bovine parainfluenza virus [40, 41] .",

TLR signaling events lead to the activation of nuclear factor kapp-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NFkB) and interferon regulatory factor (IRF), which switch on expression of a specific panel of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as TNFa, IL6, IL8 and Regulated on activation, Normal T cells (RANTES) [19] . Activation of TLR by viruses also results in the production and release of type I IFNs [39] . TLR3 and TLR7 engagement by synthetic ligands lead to cytokine expression profiles similar to PPRV infection except for a weak IL1b, IL6 and IL8 production in goat PBMC. A predominantly inflammatory cytokine repertoire, with expression of TNFa, IFNa and IFNc was observed at both mRNA and protein levels. Thus, it could be inferred that TLR engagement upon PPRV infection results in inflammatory cytokine production via the canonical NFkB pathway and type I IFN production via the activation of IRFs [42] . Stimulation of TLR7 with synthetic RNA oligonucleotides has earlier been shown to induce production of IL-12, TNFa and IFNc in PBMC of cattle [43] . Interestingly, in our study, IFNc levels were higher in PPRV infected PBMC, compared to the engagement of TLR3/7 by their respective agonists. IFNc production by NK cells can be induced by IL12 secreted by TLR stimulated DCs [44] . In buffalos, approximately 1.5 fold higher levels of IFNa at mRNA and protein levels were induced in PBMC compared to goats after infection with PPRV suggesting that type I IFN may play a role in limiting virus replication in buffalo. Further, we found that TLR7 mediated IFNa production is critical because TLR7 antagonist inhibited IFNa production both in Imiquimod or PPRV-treated goat and buffalo PBMC. This effect was more prominent in buffalo PBMC suggesting that TLR7 mediated IFNa production determines PPRV replication efficiency in this species.",

IL10 is a key regulatory cytokine with immunosuppressive properties that helps to regulate an uncontrolled inflammatory response [45] . In addition to preventing the maturation of antigen presenting cells, IL10 can also regulate the proliferation and differentiation of Th1 cells, which induces T cell-dependent suppression of antiviral responses [46, 47] . Dexamethasone, a well-known immunosuppressive drug, induces immunosuppression by altering the expression levels of IL10 and TNFa [48] . Experimental immunosuppression of goat with dexamethasone and challenge with virulent PPRV indicated that, immunosuppressed goats had a shorter viremia, more extensive and severe disease advancement, significant decrease in the number of leucocytes, high antigen load in various organs and higher mortality rate than the nonimmunosuppressed goats [49, 50] . Taken together, it appears that a higher basal expression of TLR3 and TLR7 in Kanni and Salem breeds may correlate with increased inflammatory cytokine expression with lower levels of immunomodulatory cytokines leading to an enhanced antiviral state thus affording reduced susceptibility to PPRV infection. Similarly, in buffalo, the TLR-7 mediated type I IFN response upon infection may afford resistance to PPRV.",

Nucleotide sequence homology studies have shown a close relationship with other ruminant species, particularly sheep TLR7 [51] . Earlier studies in 12 Indian goat breeds have shown a total of 22 polymorphic sites, out of which 19 were present within the coding region and three in the 39UTR [41] . The Toll/ interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain sequence is highly conserved between species, as it plays a crucial role in TLR downstream signaling [52] . In our study, sequence analysis revealed five nucleotide changes in the TLR7 coding region and two nucleotide changes in the 39UTR. All the changes were synonymous and it is difficult to establish a correlation with specific SNP and altered susceptibility to PPRV in the goat breeds examined. There were no differences in the leucine repeat regions of TLR7 between different breeds of goats. Though, we were unable to demonstrate a positive association between SNP and differential susceptibility to PPRV in the goat TLR7 gene, analyses of other immune genes including TLR3 and TLR4 may indicate the relationship between susceptibility to PPRV infection and genetic polymorphisms in the host. Earlier studies in buffalo TLR7 gene have also reported four different polymorphic positions (A/G-1400, A/G-1480 (D234N), C/T-2029 (L417F), A/G-2640), of which two were non synonymous SNP's in leucine rich repeats (LRR) [53] . Given the presence of SNP's in LRR of buffalo TLR7 gene, which is responsible for sensing the PAMP's, these SNP's could be associated with differential sensing of PPRV. Further studies are required to correlate the reported SNP's in buffalo TLR7 with observed differential response of buffalo PBMC to PPRV. by qRT-PCR assays using SYBR Green chemistry. Fold change in mRNA expression induced by Imiquimod or PPRV stimulation was calculated using mock induced cytokine mRNA expression levels as a calibrator. c) PPRV replication in goat and buffalo PBMC (at 24 h and 48 h) in the presence of conditioned medium (CM) from PPRV infected cells. The expression levels of viral hemagglutinin (H) mRNA levels expressed as a percentage inhibition in viral replication in the presence of CM when compared with the control (PBMC+PPRV We also found a role for basal and induced TLR3 expression levels in PPRV infection in our study. In addition to TLR, variations in downstream intracellular signaling molecules such as MyD88 and MD2 may also play a role. In conclusion, our studies suggest that higher basal levels of TLR3/7 and augmented innate antiviral immune responses upon infection may afford resistance to PPRV infection in Kanni and Salem breeds of goats compared to Barbari and Tellicherry breeds. Compared to goats, elevated type I IFN levels after PPRV infection in water buffaloes may afford reduced virus replication and possibly early virus clearance. LRR prediction revealed goat TLR7 has 21 LRRs and buffalo TLR7 has 15 LRRs. The difference in LRR numbers could be a critical factor in determining the signaling responses of goat and buffalo TLR7. Future studies may provide insights into understanding the immunogenetic mechanisms underlying variations in the immune response to PPRV.",

These animals were not vaccinated against PPRV and had no record of any other disease during the course of the study. PBMC from nine animals of each breed were used for TLR mRNA expression analysis, while PPRV infection and TLR stimulationstudies were carried out on PBMC from five animals of each breed. Live attenuated PPRV (strain AR-87) was obtained from the department of veterinary microbiology, Madras Veterinary College, India and has been described elsewhere [31] . Imiquimod R837 (2.5 mg/ml) and polyionosinic-polycytidylic acid, a synthetic analog of dsRNA (poly I:C) (25 mg/ml) (InVivoGen, San Diego, CA) were diluted in endotoxin-free water. Aliquots were tested by the E-toxate kit (Limulusam ebocyte lysate assay, Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and found to be free of endotoxins.",
