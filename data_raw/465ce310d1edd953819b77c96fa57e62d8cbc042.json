Silver nanoparticles have demonstrated strong antiviral activity, and graphene is a potential antimicrobial material due to its large surface area, high carrier mobility, and biocompatibility. No studies on the antiviral activity of nanomaterials on non-enveloped viruses have been reported. To investigate the antiviral activity of graphene oxide (GO) sheets and GO sheets with silver particles (GO-Ag) against enveloped and non-enveloped viruses, feline coronavirus (FCoV) with an envelope and infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) without an envelope were chosen. The morphology and sizes of GO and GO-Ag were characterized by transmission, scanning electron microscopy, and X-ray diffraction. A virus inhibition assay was used to identify the antiviral activity of GO and GO-Ag. Go-Ag inhibited 25% of infection by FCoV and 23% by IBDV, whereas GO only inhibited 16% of infection by FCoV but showed no antiviral activity against the infection by IBDV. Further application of GO and GO-Ag can be considered for personal protection equipment to decrease the transmission of viruses.",

            "text": "The major antiviral mechanism of Ag NPs has not been investigated extensively, but the most frequently observed method by which Ag NPs may inhibit viruses is the physical binding between the virus and Ag NPs to block the entry of the viruses into cells. Ag NPs could inhibit the in vitro production of HBV RNA and extracellular virions by interacting with the HBV viral particles, as revealed by transmission electronic microscopy (TEM) [7] . At an early stage of viral replication, Ag NPs are observed by TEM to bind to glycoprotein 120 and thus prevent the binding and fusion of HIV-1 and CD4 cells. In addition, Ag NPs can inhibit the post-entry stages of the HIV-1 life cycle [5] . Because Ag NPs have a natural tendency to bind the disulfide bonds in each monomer of hemagglutinin protein on the surface of an influenza virus and block its host receptor binding sites, Ag NPs can inhibit the absorption of influenza viruses to Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells and chicken red blood cells [12] . Numerous factors can determine the antiviral efficacy of Ag NPs, including size, shape, and capping agents. Previous studies have found that the most effective size of Ag NPs is <10 nm [14] and that a spherical shape is superior to a tubular shape or aggregation. Furthermore, previous studies have revealed that capping agents limiting the release of free Ag NPs would exhibit lower viral inhibition [5] . Therefore, novel material for the capping and support agents of Ag NPs is required for a superior application of Ag NPs.",

            "text": "Graphene, a single atomic plane of graphine with 2-dimensional extension, is promising as a next-generation nanomaterial due to its unique high carrier mobility, effective optical transparency, large surface area, and biocompatibility [15] . GO is employed in the production of graphene family nanomaterials for various applications. The antibacterial activity of well-dispersed GO sheets has been evaluated [16] [17] [18] , and a few studies have reported that graphene-based material can inhibit the entry and replication of enveloped DNA virus (herpesvirus) and RNA virus (coronavirus) in their target cells [19, 20] . The pertinent findings of previous studies on the nanocomposites formed by Ag NPs and GO sheets against bacteria can be applied to investigations of the antiviral activity of nanocomposites composed of GO sheets and Ag NPs (GO-Ag). The GO sheets can serve as a supporting and stabilizing agent in preventing the agglomeration of the Ag NPs and consequently in preventing a reduction of the antibacterial activity. The Ag NPs supported on GO sheets showed a spherical-like morphology and an average size of 7.5 nm [16] , which is suitable for antiviral activity [14] . The most significant advantage of GO-Ag nanocomposites over free Ag NPs is that the immobilization of Ag NPs on GO sheets prevents the movement of the nanoparticles, thus increasing the material's biocompatibility and reducing the toxicological effects and the environmental impact associated with metallic nanoparticles. In addition, the GO-Ag matrix is highly dispersible in water, contains a large specific surface area, shows excellent bactericidal activity at extremely low concentrations, and exhibits no corrosive characteristics.",

Feline CoV is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus with a lipid envelope and belongs to the family Coronaviridae. It usually causes feline infectious peritonitis-a progressive and fatal disease in cats-and is transmitted through direct contact with secretions [21] . IBDV is a double-stranded RNA virus without an envelope and belongs to the genus Avibirnavirus of the family Birnaviridae. It mainly infects chickens, leading to immunosuppression and significant economic loss [22] . If the GO-Ag shows promising antiviral activity, then we hope to apply this novel material to manufacturing personal protection equipment (PPE) to protect against viral infections.",

Then, the mixture was diluted with distilled water and kept at 95\u02ddC for another 2 h before the further dilution with warm water. After the mixture turned yellow with stirring, the mixture was centrifuged to obtain GO powders. The GO powders were re-dispersed in water, and the solution was sonicated for 2 h to facilitate the exfoliation of stacked GO into monolayer or multilayered GO sheets about several micrometers in lateral size. The GO was further reduced using beta-mercaptoethanol, and the black powders of the final product were recovered after centrifugation.",

Ag NPs have shown antiviral activity against enveloped viruses in previous studies, but no studies have discussed the antiviral activity of GO and GO-Ag. The antiviral mechanisms of Ag NPs are mainly based on the blocking of viral entry and the interference with viral membrane fusion [12, 14] . The antiviral activity of GO-Ag observed in the current study should be contributed to by Ag particles on GO sheets. The sizes of Ag particles on GO sheets shown by FE-SEM images ranged from 5 to 25 nm, and about 50% of Ag particles were 10 nm or fewer than 10 nm. Less inhibition ability (25%) of GO-Ag (1 mg/mL) against coronavirus (47,000 TCID 50 /mL) was observed, compared to 97% of inhibition against influenza virus (100 TCID 50 /mL) by Ag NPs (0.05 mg/mL) [14] . However, the virus inhibition ability of Ag NPs in Xiang's study [14] is not much better than that of GO-Ag in this study if we calculate the differences of virus and compound concentrations. Since GO sheets also showed antiviral ability against the coronavirus in this study, the synergistic effect from GO sheets and Ag particles on the inhibition against the infection of an enveloped virus should be considered.",

Exposure to GO and reduced GO can induce significant production of reactive oxygen species in Pseudomonas and lead to the fragmentation of bacterial DNA and death [17] . GO-Ag can disrupt the cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria and inhibit cell division of Gram-negative bacteria [26] . From de Faria's study, GO sheets showed no antibacterial activity, while GO-Ag had a 100% inhibition rate of the adhered cells, thus preventing the process of biofilm formation [16] . Because of the differences of antiviral activity against enveloped and non-enveloped viruses by GO sheets, it is reasonable to assume that there is a physical or chemical interaction between GO sheets and the envelope of coronavirus leading to decreased infectivity. Without an envelope, the antiviral activity would solely rely on Ag particles, but GO sheets can boost the antiviral effect of Ag particles by supporting the even dispersion of Ag particles and the formation of spherical particles without aggregations. Additionally, the immobilization of Ag NPs on GO sheets has reduced cytotoxicity, usually caused by free Ag NPs.",

For non-enveloped viruses, graphene oxide (GO) sheets act as supporting materials for antiviral Ag particles without any antiviral ability. For the enveloped virus, GO sheets not only can be used to assist the even dispersal of Ag particles but also have ability to inhibit the infection of viruses. GO sheets also show very low cytotoxicity to cells. In conclusion, this study discovered that GO and GO-Ag are novel materials for the further development of protective reagents and equipment against the transmission of infectious viruses.",
