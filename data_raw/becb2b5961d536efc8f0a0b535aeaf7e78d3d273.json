This current study investigated fever in 5729 children in Vietnam with 3 days or less of fever and identified 1692 dengue cases using advanced, gold standard methods. We systematically collected a range of medical and laboratory findings on each patient when they entered the study and used statistical tools to determine if these medical and laboratory findings could enable early diagnosis, independent of sophisticated, gold-standard laboratory tests. Our results, called the Early Dengue Classifier, had performance characteristics suggesting it could improve the diagnostic proficiency of health care professionals. However the performance of the Early Dengue Classifier is not perfect and likely will not change the practice of experienced doctors in dengue endemic settings. Our study highlights the need for 2 nd generation, easy-to-use rapid diagnostic tests that can accurately diagnose dengue in the first few days of fever.",

Improvements in case diagnosis and management will be central to achieving this aim. Significant loss of intravascular plasma volume leading to hypovolemic shock (dengue shock syndrome (DSS)), usually between the 4 th -6 th day of illness, is the commonest life-threatening complication of dengue [1, 4] . It's widely held that the case-incidence of DSS can be reduced via careful monitoring and the judicious use of parenteral fluids to maintain an adequate intravascular volume [1] . Ideally, this case management approach is enabled because the attending physician had made an early diagnosis and thus alerted clinicians, nurses and family caregivers to the signs and symptoms suggestive of clinical worsening. Additional benefits of an early diagnosis include support to community level public health interventions and improvements in the sensitivity of case surveillance systems and disease burden estimates. Furthermore, it is likely that the therapeutic window of opportunity for a dengue antiviral drug lies in the first 48-72 hours of illness [5] . Thus, programmatic use of therapeutic interventions in the future will likely go hand in hand with strategies for early diagnosis.",

Rapid lateral flow tests, based on the detection of the viral NS1 antigen, are available in some settings and can provide a confirmatory diagnosis [6] [7] [8] . The diagnostic performance of the WHO dengue case definition, which relies on nonspecific signs and symptoms that overlap with other infectious diseases, is unknown in the first few days of illness [1] . Potts et al concluded that more prospective studies were needed to construct a valid and generalizable algorithm to guide the differential diagnosis of dengue in endemic countries [9] . To this end, several prospective studies have described the creation of classifiers for the diagnosis of dengue [10] [11] [12] . However none of these studies have exclusively focused on pediatric fever cases presenting to primary care facilities with short illness histories, a very common scenario in dengue endemic settings. Against this backdrop, the purpose of the current study was to prospectively derive a dengue diagnostic algorithm from routinely collected clinical and laboratory findings in pediatric patients with <72 hours of illness history and compare this approach against the diagnostic performance of a leading NS1 rapid test (BioRad NS1 Ag STRIP) in the same patients. The results provide pragmatic methods to enhance the early diagnosis of dengue in primary care settings.",

Alternative statistical models such as classification and regression trees (CART) and random forests (RF) were also investigated in order to find an optimal diagnostic algorithm [15, 16] . The performance of the model was assessed with respect to discrimination (receiver operating characteristic curves (ROCs) and area under the ROC curve (AUC)), calibration (calibration plots and calibration intercepts and slopes), and standard accuracy criteria of binary diagnostic tests (sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive values). We selected the cut-off point to classify a patient as dengue positive at a predicted risk of dengue of !33.3%, corresponding to assuming that the \"cost\" of missing a true dengue patient is twice as large as the cost of a false-positive [17] . To avoid over-optimistic estimates of model accuracy and performance due to model derivation and evaluation on the same dataset, all accuracy measures were corrected for optimism by validation. Validation was performed for the whole model development process including variable selection. Two validation schemes were employed to mimic external validation: a. \"leave-one-site-out cross-validation\", i.e. repeatedly developing the algorithm on all but one site and validation on the left-out site b. Temporal validation with patients recruited before 15 June 2012 as the training set and patients recruited thereafter as the evaluation set [18] .",

The most parsimonious model, derived from stability selection, used the patient's age, white cell count and platelet count at the time of enrolment to classify dengue from non-dengue cases (Table 3) . Alternative approaches to feature selection yielded models with only slightly higher performance but relied on many more (more than ten) variables (S4 Table) . The most parsimonious model, herein called the Early Dengue Classifier (EDC), had a sensitivity of 74.8% (95%CI: 73.0-76.8%), specificity of 76.3% (95%CI: 75.2-77.6%), positive predictive value of 57.1% (95%CI: 56.2-59.0%), and negative predictive value of 87.8% (95%CI: 86.8-88.5%) for correctly classifying dengue cases in the entire dataset at the pre-defined cut-off of 33.3%. Of note, this pre-defined cut-off reflecting clinical priorities was very close to the cut-off corresponding to the point on the ROC curve closest to the upper left corner (perfect model), which was 34.2% (Fig 1A) . The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.829 ( Fig 1B) and the predicted risk of dengue agreed well with the observed risk ( Fig 1C) . Table. These results suggest that, in settings where NS1 rapid tests are not routinely available, the EDC could assist primary care physicians in dengue diagnosis. In settings where NS1 rapid tests are routinely used, the EDC can be combined with the NS1 rapid test as a composite test (classified as positive when either NS1 rapid test or EDC are positive, and classified as negative when both NS1 rapid test and EDC are negative). This composite test had sensitivity of 91.6% (95%CI: 90.4-92.9%) while the specificity was 75.7% (95%CI: 74.5-77.0%). Corresponding positive and negative predictive values were 61.7% (95%CI: 60.6-63.1%) and 95.5% (95%CI: 94.9-96.1%). If a higher specificity was desired, a higher cut-off value of the EDC could be used for the combined test instead, e.g. a cut-off of 50% would lead to a sensitivity of 86.0% (95%CI: 84.5-87.6%) and specificity of 89.6% (95%CI: 88.7-90.5%). These results imply that the EDC is useful in settings with and without NS1 rapid testing. The nomogram assigns points to all risk factors and translates the total point score to a predicted risk for dengue. For example, a 9-year-old patient with platelet count 100x10 3 /mm 3 , and white blood cell count 5x10 3 /mm 3 has a total points score of 15+32+84 = 131, and the corresponding risk of dengue is about 70%. The predicted risk of dengue is larger than 33.3% so the patient would be classified as dengue positive. Alternatively, the EDC could be implemented as a smartphone app. The exact formula for the estimated risk of dengue (p) is given by the following logistic equation: logit(p) = 1.236 + 0.139 \u00c3 age (in years)-0.254 \u00c3 white blood cell (in 10 3 /mm 3 )-0.006 \u00c3 platelet (in 10 3 /mm 3 ).

Physicians need better tools to assist in early diagnosis if the WHO ambition of a 50% reduction in global dengue mortality is to be achieved by 2020. This study characterized the performance of three diagnostic approaches; the NS1 rapid test, a standalone diagnostic classifier and the combination of NS1 rapid test and diagnostic classifier together. Our results highlight the utility of NS1 rapid tests for an early specific diagnosis, yet also remind that 2 nd generation tests are needed with improved sensitivity.

            "text": "There is a body of literature describing the performance of NS1 rapid tests for the diagnosis of dengue [6] [7] [8] [19] [20] [21] [22] . This current study extends that literature in several ways. First, by virtue of the large sample size we demonstrate with high precision the differential sensitivity of the NS1 Ag STRIP for different DENV serotypes. This test was sensitive (between 75-85%) for DENV-1, -3 and -4 infections, but poorly sensitive in DENV-2 infections (46.4%). Lower sensitivity was partially attributable to the great majority of DENV-2 infections being associated with secondary serological responses, although we note sensitivity was also low in primary Figure B displays the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Figure C is a calibration plot. It displays a scatterplot-smoother of predicted versus observed DENV-2 infections. This suggests that there are particular virological (e.g. lower viral burdens in vivo) or intrinsic aspects of the NS1 test, that limit DENV-2 NS1 detection. [23] [24] [25] [26] . Second, we make the novel observation that 5-10 fold enrichment of proteins with molecular weight >100kDa in plasma specimens (the NS1 hexamer has predicted molecular weight of 310kDa [27] ) did not lead to improved NS1 detection rates. These data suggest that dengue patients who return negative NS1 rapid test results in the first 3 days of illness have free plasma NS1 concentrations substantially below the limit of sensitivity of existing assays and that 2 nd generation tests might need to be at least an order of magnitude more sensitive. Nonetheless, better NS1 rapid diagnostic tests are needed if they are going to be widely adopted by clinical services in primary care settings. In malaria, HRP2 rapid diagnostic tests for Plasmodium falciparum infection are an example of how improvements to assay performance can lead to recognition as a diagnostic standard of care [28] . Finally, although serum NS1 concentrations have been proposed to have prognostic value in a small study, this is yet to be independently validated and is likely to be difficult given that blood NS1 concentrations vary widely according to the infecting DENV serotype, serological response and day of illness [8, 24, 29, 30] . Previous studies have described clinical and/or routine laboratory findings that distinguish patients with dengue from those with other febrile illnesses [12, [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] . What is striking in the literature is that only three prospective studies have considered dengue diagnostic algorithms exclusively in children and of these the largest contained 1227 patients, of who 614 had dengue [11, 38, 39] . More generally, most diagnostic studies failed to report positive and negative predictive values for their diagnostic algorithms, thus making it difficult to assess their utility in routine practice. Against this backdrop, a strength of the current study is the large sample size, the presence of all four DENV serotypes, robust statistical validation techniques and transparent performance characteristics. The clinical signs and symptoms that make up the WHO case definition for dengue were not used in the final, parsimonious diagnostic EDC classifier. Instead, we found that only three variables-patient age, white blood cell count and platelet count, provided similar discriminatory information as alternative models that relied upon a much larger set of clinical data.",

We concur with Potts et al in the belief that diagnostic rules for dengue are not a replacement for good clinical acumen and management [9] . Nonetheless, the EDC described here offers an evidencebased guide that can likely improve the prevailing diagnostic accuracy of most Vietnamese physicians working in primary care who do not possess extensive experience in dengue diagnosis and management. In particular, in settings where NS1 rapid tests are not routinely available or affordable, or where DENV-2 is the most prevalent virus in circulation, the EDC could help guide clinicians in making their differential diagnosis. An early diagnosis of dengue can assist in patient triage and management by directing clinical/caregiver attention to clinical warning signs and/or the appearance of capillary permeability, for which supportive oral and/or parenteral fluid therapy is recommended in order to prevent circulatory compromise.

The EDC relies on routine hematology findings that are commonly accessible in primary care settings in Vietnam but might not be available everywhere. By design, our study focused on patients with <72 hours of illness and hence our results might not be applicable to patients who present to medical care at later time-points. By using the age of the patient as a component of the EDC, it's likely that the EDC would not perform well in settings where the burden of dengue falls on age-groups different from that in southern Vietnam. Nonetheless, this study has delivered the largest population-based and quantitative framework to guide early diagnosis of pediatric dengue. Further prospective validation in Vietnam and other endemic countries with similar epidemiology will be needed to establish the clinical utility of the EDC. ",
