The objective of this study is to develop a visual reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay for the detection of hMPV and applied to the clinical samples. Results: In this study, visual RT-LAMP assay for hMPV was performed in one step with the addition of hydroxynaphthol blue (HNB), and were used to detect respiratory samples. Six primers, including two outer primers (F3 and B3), two inner primers (FIP, BIP) and two loop primers (LF and LB), were designed for hMPV N gene by the online software. Moreover, the RT-LAMP assay showed good specificity and no cross-reactivity was observed with human rhinovirus (HRV), human respiratory syncytial Virus (RSV), or influenza virus A/PR/8/34 (H1N1). The detection limit of the RT-LAMP assay was approximately ten viral RNA copies, lower than that of traditional reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) 100 RNA copies. In the 176 nasopharyngeal samples, 23 (13.1%) were conformed as hMPV positive by RT-LAMP, but 18 (10.2%) positive by RT-PCR.",

However, sensitive cell lines for hMPV are limited. The cell line LLC-MK2 can reach a 100% infection within 5 days of isolation [10] , but this is far from fulfilling the requirements in terms of time efficiency for positive identification during outbreaks. In comparison, hMPV antigen detection requires the preparation of monoclonal antibodies; this entails significant costs and can be time-consuming. Although RT-PCR, qRT-PCR, and microarrays are suitable for high-throughput analyses and can produce rapid, specific, and sensitive results, the expensive instruments required for such tests restrict their application.",

LAMP relies on autocycling strand-displacement DNA synthesis performed by Bst DNA polymerase. Additionally, RNA can be amplified by reverse transcription coupled with LAMP (RT-LAMP) in one step, making it suitable to detect RNA viruses such as hMPV. RT-LAMP employs a set of six specially designed primers that recognize eight distinct sequences of the target, and only when three pairs of specific primers match the target sequence exactly can the gene amplification start. The whole reaction can be completed in 1.5 h and the amplified product shows a ladderlike pattern by agarose gel electrophoresis. Moreover, this method produces a large amount of amplified product, resulting in easier detection by visual judgment according to the turbidity of the reaction mixture. Therefore, LAMP and RT-LAMP method have been used as a powerful gene amplification tool due to its high specificity and sensitivity under isothermal condition.",

Additionally, results from the LAMP can be readily observed by the white precipitate of magnesium pyrophosphate generated during the reaction. Just because no laboratory equipment is needed for the determination of results, RT-LAMP can easily be used in field-testing. Moreover, A real-time monitoring turbidimeter was developed to monitor LAMP reactions [14] . Through continuous exploration, LAMP has been combined with a fluorescent dye for quantification in real-time reactions [15, 16] . For example, a metal ion indicator, hydroxynaphthol blue (HNB), was added to LAMP assay [17] [18] [19] . The HNB dye-based assay has a remarkable advantage compared with other color-based assays in that HNB is mixed prior to amplification.

The epidemiological analysis indicated that children with HMPV varied from 20 days to 146 months of age, and the majority of patients (82.6%, 18/23) were aged at under \u22645 years. The main clinical diagnoses included bronchopneumonia (52.2%, 12/ 23), acute respiratory tract infection (26.1%, 6/23), acute asthmatic bronchopneumonia (17.4%, 4/23) and pneumonia (4.3%, 1/23). In short, RT-LAMP with HNB dye was shown to be a sensitive and easy assay for detection of hMPV. Given these benefits, RT-LAMP is considered a useful and promising technique for the less equipped primary sector. It can also play an important role in the early diagnosis and control of diseases during outbreaks in remote areas or under field conditions.",
