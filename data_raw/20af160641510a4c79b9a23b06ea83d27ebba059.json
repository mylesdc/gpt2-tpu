Viral infection induced translocation of GLTSCR2 from nucleus to cytoplasm that enabled GLTSCR2 to attenuate type I interferon IFN-\u03b2 and support viral replication. Cytoplasmic GLTSCR2 was able to interact with retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and the ubiquitin-specific protease 15 (USP15), and the triple interaction induced USP15 activity to remove K63-linked ubiquitination of RIG-I, leading to attenuation of RIG-I and IFN-\u03b2. Blocking cytoplasmic translocation of GLTSCR2, by deletion of its nuclear export sequence (NES), abrogated its ability to attenuate IFN-\u03b2 and support viral replication. GLTSCR2-mediated attenuation of RIG-I and IFN-\u03b2 led to alleviation of host cell innate immune response to viral infection. Our findings suggested that GLTSCR2 contributed to efficient viral replication, and GLTSCR2 should be considered as a potential target for therapeutic control of viral infection.",

Upon viral infection, host pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), such as the retinoic acid-induced gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs), are able to detect viral nucleic acids and initiate a series of cell signals, leading to induction of type I IFN and proinflammatory cytokines 2-5 . RIG-I, a family member of RLRs, interacts with viral RNA and recruits mitochondrial-associated virus stimulator (MAVS, also known as IPS-1, Cardif, and VISA) 6,7 . MAVS recruits tumor necrosis receptor-associated factor 3 (TRAF3) that results in TRAF3 lysine 63 (K63)-linked auto-ubiquitination to provide docking sites for TANK binding kinase 1/I kappa-B kinase epsilon (TBK1/IKK\u03b5 ) complex 8-10 . This complex undergoes auto-phosphorylation-mediated activation, resulting in phosphorylating and activating the type I IFN regulatory factor IRF3 or/and IRF7 to form homodimers or heterodimers that translocate into the nucleus for induction of type I IFN 10,11 . The complex also activates canonical IKK for NF-\u03ba B activation to induce proinflammatory cytokines 12 . Studies also showed that dephosphorylation (Thr170) of RIG-I by the phosphatase PP1 \u03b1 /\u03b3 13 and K63-linked ubiquitination (Lys172) of RIG-I by the ubiquitin E3 ligase tripartite motif proteins TRIM25 14 and TRIM4 15 lead to RIG-I activation and type I IFN production. Studies have shown that viral infection, including rhabdovirus, paramyxovirus, coronavirus, and herpesvirus, may counteract RIG-I-dependent IFN antiviral response 16 . Rabies virus is a member of the Rhabdoviridae family, and Rabies virus (Ni strain)-expressed N protein has a function to evade the activation of RIG-I and RIG-I-mediated innate immunity 17 . Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a member of the Paramyxoviridae family, and RSV-expressed nonstructural NS2 protein inhibits IFN transcription induced by binding RIG-I and inhibiting its interaction with the downstream component MAVS 18 . Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a member of the Coronaviridae family, and PEDV-expressed papain-like protease 2 (PLP2), which has deubiqutinase (DUB) activity, reduces both K48-linked and K63-linked polyubiquitin chains and inhibits RIG-I-activated IFN expression 19 . Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1)-expressed US11 protein antagonizes IFN-\u03b2 production by binding RIG-I 20 . Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV)-expressed ORF64, which is a tegument protein with DUB activity, suppresses type I IFN signaling by blocking the ubiquitination of RIG-I 21 . Cellular ubiquitin-specific proteases (USPs), a subfamily of DUB 22 , regulate ubiquitination of RIG-I 23 . USP21 and USP15 remove K63-linked polyubiquitin chains from RIG-I and block the ability of RIG-I to induce IFN-\u03b2 24,25 . USP15",

However, it was not clear whether GLTSCR2 might be involved in viral replication. In this work, we pursued the role of GLTSCR2 in viral replication. Translocation from nucleus to cytoplasm enabled GLTSCR2 to attenuate the ability of RIG-I to induce IFN-\u03b2 in cells responding to viral infection. We also investigated mechanisms for GLTSCR2-induced attenuation of RIG-I. Our studies revealed a previously unrecognized role of GLTSCR2 in attenuation of RIG-I and IFN-\u03b2 and, for the first time, our results provided insights into nucleolar proteins involved in innate immunity response to viral infection.",

To investigate whether GLTSCR2 might play any role in viral replication, we used small interfering RNA (siRNA) to knock down GLTSCR2 in cells, followed by infection with Rhabdoviridae vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), Paramyxoviridae Newcastle disease virus (NDV), and Coronaviridae infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). As shown in Fig. 1a , decreases of GLTSCR2 resulted in reduced production of viral particles of VSV, NDV, and IBV by ~60, ~120, and ~20 folds, respectively. GLTSCR2 reduction also resulted in decreased levels of viral proteins in cells, indicating an important role of GLTSCR2 for production of various viruses. To investigate if viral infection might modulate GLTSCR2 level in cells, we studied the timecourse of GLTSCR2 during VSV infection, and we detected that GLTSCR2 level was not significantly affected by viral infection (Fig. 1b) , indicating the endogenous level of GLTSCR2 was sufficient to support viral replication.",

The region of residues 342 to 386 is also responsible for homo-dimerization or even homo-oligomerization 38 . To understand if these putative domains might be important in GLTSCR2-involved viral replication, we constructed plasmid expression vectors to carry gene fragments encoding G3 (residues 330-432) and G4 (residues 241-478). We transfected HEp-2 cells with these expression vectors individually and infected cells with VSV. We detected that ectopic expression of the full length, wild-type (wt) GLTSCR2 enhanced viral replication, indexed by viral proteins VSV-G and NDV-P (Fig. 1c) . Expression of G3 or G4 appeared to enhance viral replication to a comparable level as enhanced by wt GLTSCR2 (Fig. 1c) . These preliminary results indicated that the integrity of C-terminal region G3 (residues 330-432) was important for GLTSCR2 in support of viral replication.",

It was reported that the translocation of GLTSCR2 from nucleus to cytoplasm was induced by infection with HSV-1 32 , however, it was not clear whether GLTSCR2 cytoplasmic translocation might be associated with viral replication. To verify the cytoplasmic translocation of GLTSCR2 in response to VSV replication, we ectopically expressed GFP-tagged GLTSCR2 in HeLa cells, followed by infection of cells with VSV. As shown in Fig. 2a , GFP-tagged GLTSCR2 was detectable in the nucleus (lane 1), and then was detected in the cytoplasm by 7 (lane 2) and 10 (lane 3) hours after viral infection. Cytoplasmic translocation of GFP-tagged GLTSCR2 was blocked by leptomycin B (LMB) (lane 4), which is able to inhibit broad range of nuclear protein export pathways mediated by CRM1/exportin 1 39 , indicating that the export of GLTSCR2 to cytoplasm was in a CRM1-dependent manner. In addition, GLTSCR2-\u2206 GLT variant, in which the nuclear export sequence (NES, residues 358 to 370) was deleted, failed to translocate into the cytoplasm after VSV infection (lane 5). Furthermore, the levels of viral production (Fig. 2b , left) and viral proteins (Fig. 2b , right) were greatly increased by ectopic expression of wt GLTSCR2. The ectopic expression of GLTSCR2-\u2206 GLT, however, resulted in slightly increased production of viral particles (Fig. 2b) . The results indicated that cytoplasmic translocation of GLTSCR2 played an important role in support of VSV replication.",

After viral infection, increases of ectopically expressed GLTSCR2 resulted in decreases of IFN-\u03b2 promoter activity in cells infected with either Sendai virus (SeV) or VSV (Fig. 3a) . We also detected that increases of ectopically expressed GLTSCR2 resulted in decreasing NF-\u03ba B-dependent promoter activity in cells infected with either SeV or VSV (Fig. 3b) . These results indicated that GLTSCR2 might be involved in downregulation of IFN-\u03b2 and NF-\u03ba B during viral infection of cells. In contrast, knockdown of endogenous GLTSCR2 resulted in significant increases of IFN-\u03b2 promoter activity (Fig. 3c) and IFN-\u03b2 secretion (Fig. 3d) In addition, the ability of recombinant IFN-\u03b2 to suppress VSV replication, indexed by viral particle production (Fig. 3e , left) and the viral protein VSV-G (Fig. 3e, right) , was significantly reversed by ectopically expressed wt GLTSCR2. The results further indicated that GLTSCR2 supported viral replications by not only downregulating IFN-\u03b2 expression but also suppressing IFN-\u03b2 activity. Phosphorylation of type I IFN regulatory factor IRF3 on serine 396 has been shown to play a pivotal role in IFN-\u03b2 induction 10, 11 . While investigating the involvement of IRF3 activation in GLTSCR2 suppression of type I IFN, we generated HEK293T cell line stably expressing specific short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting GLTSCR2 using a shRNA-based lentivector (GLTSCR2 knockdown cells). Our results showed that VSV replication was decreased in GLTSCR2 knockdown cells versus viral replication in HEK293T cells (Fig. 3f, left) . We also detected that a higher level of phosphorylated IRF3 (p-IRF3) in GLTSCR2 knockdown cells than it in HEK293T cells infected with VSV (Fig. 3f , right) 3, 6, 9, 12, 24 , and 36 h. Cell lysates were prepared, GLTSCR2 and VSV-G were measured by immunoblotting with specific antibodies, with actin as a control.

Cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting with specific antibodies to detect Flag, VSV-G, NDV-P, with actin as a control. (d,e) HEp-2 cells in T-25 flask were transfected with plasmid vector as control (Ctrl) and plasmids to express Flag-tagged wt GLTSCR2 or truncated G3 and G4 (5 \u03bc g each), followed by infection with NDV or IBV at 10 PFU per cell. Total RNAs were isolated; gene expression levels of NDV-N (d) and IBV-N (e) were quantified by qRT-PCR and normalized with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), the level set in control cells as 1. Values represent means of triplicates with SD. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01. for 24, 36, and 48 hours.

It was reported that viruses are able to utilize host cell's ubiquitin ligase and deubiqutinases to antagonize RIG-I-, MAVS-, TBK1-, and IRF3-mediated innate immune response in order to succeed viral replications [43] [44] [45] . Cellular proteins, such as PCBP2, Ndfip1, SOCS3, Siglec1, and FoxO1, are involved in recruiting ubiquitin ligases to down-regulate MAVS, TBK1, and IRF3 by K48-linked ubiquitination and degradation [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] . On the other hand, studies showed that influenza A virus infection induces nuclear accumulation of \u03b2 -catenin to suppress IFN-\u03b2 induction 51 , and nuclear translocation of TRIM26 promotes K48-linked ubiquitination and degradation of IRF3, thereby blocking IFN-\u03b2 induction 43 . In contrast, our studies showed that cytoplasmic translocation of nucleolar GLTSCR2 contributed to attenuation of IFN-\u03b2 induction and replication of viral particles. Abrogating the cytoplasm-translocating ability of GLTSCR2 diminished its ability to attenuate IFN-\u03b2 induction and support viral replication. Accordingly, were co-transfected with plasmids to express Flag-tagged GLTSCR2 (5 \u03bc g) and Myc-tagged USP15 (5 \u03bc g) for 36 h, then mock-infected or infected with VSV at a MOI of 0.1 for 12 h.

We detected that USP15, but not USP3 or USP21, involved in GLTSCR2-induced removal of K63-linked polyubiquitin chains from RIG-I, resulting in deactivation of RIG-I and blockage of IFN-\u03b2 induction. Interestingly, decreases of endogenous GLTSCR2 resulted in increasing the ability of USP15 to remove K48-linked ubiquitination of RIG-I. Possibly, K63-linked and K48-linked ubiquitination competed for the same residue K172 in RIG-I, and a threshold of GLTSCR2 level played the role of modulating USP15 activity to de-conjugate K63-linked or K48-linked ubiquitination. It is also possible that cytoplasmic translocation increased GLTSCR2 level to induce the ability of USP15 to de-conjugate K63-linked ubiquitination of RIG-I; in contrast, lack of cytoplasmic GLTSCR2 resulted in decreasing the ability of USP15 to de-conjugate K63-linked ubiquitination of RIG-I but increasing the USP15 ability to de-conjugate K48-linked ubiquitination of RIG-I. Decreases of K63-linked ubiquitination or increases of K48-linked ubiquitination of RIG-I resulted in attenuation of RIG-I, thereby blocking the RIG-I to IFN-\u03b2 pathway and supporting viral replication.",

Our findings advanced current knowledge of nucleolar modulators, translocated into the cytoplasm, for attenuation of type I IFN and support viral replication during viral infection. However, whether cytoplasmic translocation of GLTSCR2 and abrogation of RIG-I activity might induce additional pathways, bypassing attenuation of IFN-\u03b2 , to support viral replication remains to be clarified. What viral components or cellular modulators, in response to viral infection, induced GLTSCR2 translocation to the cytoplasm also needs to be studied.",

The amino-terminal caspase recruitment domains (CARDs) of RIG-I (RIG-N) undergo robust ubiquitination induced by TRIM25 14 and TRIM4 15 , which effectively deliver the Lys 63-linked polyubiquitin chains to the RIG-N, to increase the activity of RIG-I. However, an ubiquitin-specific proteases USP15 24 , USP21 41 , or USP3 42 , removes the 63-linked polyubiquitin chains from the RIG-N to attenuate the activity of RIG-I. K63-linked ubiquitination of RIG-I results in activation of RIG-I, leading to induction of type I IFN14 , whereas K48-linked ubiquitination results in inactivation of RIG-I 26 . GLTSCR2 was able to interact with RIG-I and abolish the ability of RIG-I to induce IFN-\u03b2 , via de-conjugation of K63-linked, but not K48-linked, polyubiquitin chains from RIG-I. Thus, RIG-I played an important role as an immediate downstream target of GLTSCR2 for inactivation in attenuation of type I IFN and facilitation of viral replication.",
