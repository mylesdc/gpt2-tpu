In all cases, the initiation of an infection requires the recognition of specific structures at the host cell plasma membrane. This is often achieved by lectins, which bind to glycosylated residues on proteins and/or lipids present on the cell surface, mediating the attachment of the bacterium to the cell. Multivalency is an important feature of most lectins. On one hand, multivalency increases the binding affinity and specificity of the lectin-glycan interaction (Dam & Brewer, 2010) . On the other hand, the binding of lectins to multiple cell surface receptors can induce receptor clustering and plasma membrane rearrangements, triggering their entry into the host (R\u00f6mer et al, 2007; Windschiegl et al, 2009; Pezeshkian et al, 2017) .",

            "text": "P. aeruginosa possesses two tetravalent lectins in its arsenal of virulence factors, LecA and LecB (also called PA-IL and PA-IIL, respectively). LecB is a tetramer, consisting of four monomers with high specificity for L-fucose and its derivatives (Garber et al, 1987; Gilboa-Garber et al, 2000) . LecB production is regulated by rhl and Pseudomonas quinolone signal, which are part of the quorum-sensing systems (Winzer et al, 2000; Diggle et al, 2003) . Once synthesised, LecB is exposed on the outer bacterial membrane, where it has been described to interact with the outer membrane porin OprF (Tielker et al, 2005; Funken et al, 2012) . 1 The current assumption is that LecB mainly functions by promoting the adhesion of P. aeruginosa to both the host cell and the exopolysaccharide matrix, which encases bacterial cells together. However, several in vitro and in vivo studies have shown LecB to act not only as an adhesin but also as an important virulence factor, capable of triggering additional host cell responses (Schneider et al, 2015; Wilhelm et al, 2019) . LecB has been reported to be a determinant of P. aeruginosa cytotoxicity in lung epithelial cells and to block ciliary beating in human airways (Adam et al, 1997; Chemani et al, 2009 ). LecBnegative mutant bacteria exhibit an impaired biofilm formation in comparison with wild-type strains and no type VI pili assembly (Tielker et al, 2005; Sonawane et al, 2006) . Furthermore, LecB induces alveolar capillary barrier injury in vivo, leading to a higher bacterial dissemination into the bloodstream (Chemani et al, 2009 ). Previous studies have reported additional effects of LecB in inhibiting cell migration and proliferation (Cott et al, 2016) . However, its precise mechanism of action has not yet been elucidated and none of the existing studies have addressed its role in skin infections.",

Moreover, we show that insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) coprecipitates with LecB and that LecB leads to IGF-1R internalisation and missorting towards intracellular LC3-positive compartments. Notably, IGF-1R is internalised without being activated. We further demonstrate that LecB blocks the cell cycle and induces cell death, which is preceded by a strong vacuolisation. These vacuoles, which possess peculiar morphological features, originate from ruffle-like structures at subdomains of the plasma membrane where LecB is enriched. Therefore, we propose that LecB, in addition to play a role as an adhesion factor, both misregulates growth factor receptor signalling and subverts the endocytic system, leading to an impairment of vital keratinocyte functions.",

            "text": "Although LecB is enriched in biofilms, which often characterise chronic wounds, no evidence had yet been provided showing its presence in wounds. Before we addressed the effects of LecB on human keratinocytes at a molecular level, we first verified the presence of LecB in infected human wounds. To this aim, we collected chronically wounded tissue from patients infected with P. aeruginosa, as shown by wound swabs. We stained the paraffinembedded tissue sections with an antibody against P. aeruginosa to confirm its presence in the wounds. As control, we used normal skin samples. Indeed, we could detect the presence of P. aeruginosa, either as biofilm or in the form of small colonies ( Fig 1A) . We subsequently specifically stained for LecB, and strikingly, we found that this lectin was distributed in the wound sections, both in the keratinocyte layers and in the dermis (Fig 1B) . In contrast, no LecB was detected in the normal skin control samples. This result provides the first evidence of LecB in chronic human wounds, with superinfection possibly playing a role in the wound chronicity. LecB coprecipitates with essential plasma membrane receptors in normal human keratinocytes (NHKs) Next, we moved to NHKs, the predominant cell type in the epidermis, to study the mechanism of action of LecB in molecular detail. LecB plays a crucial role in the adhesion of P. aeruginosa to host cells (Chemani et al, 2009) , implying the necessity for the lectin to target plasma membrane receptors via their glycosylated residues. Therefore, we screened for potential LecB-interacting proteins via a pull-down assay. Briefly, we cultured NHKs in the presence or absence of 5 \u03bcg/ml (106 nM) of biotinylated LecB, lysed them under conditions that preserve protein-protein interactions and incubated with streptavidin agarose beads to precipitate LecB in complex with interacting proteins. Subsequently, we performed on bead digestion and analysed the obtained peptides by protein mass spectrometry. This analysis revealed the presence of important cell growth factor receptors within the enriched proteins in the LecB pull-down fractions (Table S1 ). The protein mass spectrometry results were verified by Western blot and confirmed the presence of two of the major keratinocyte growth factor receptors implicated in epidermal keratinocytes proliferation and migration, IGF-1R, and the epidermal growth factor receptor 1 (EGFR) (Haase, 2003; Sadagurski et al, 2005) (Figs 2A, and S1A and B) . In addition to stimulating the cells with biotinylated LecB, an excess of L-fucose (30 mM) was added to clarify whether the interaction of LecB with IGF-1R or EGFR was carbohydrate dependent. As L-fucose saturates the carbohydrate-binding pockets of LecB, no binding to cell membranes could be detected when LecB and L-fucose were simultaneously applied to the cells, as neither IGF-1R nor EGFR could be coprecipitated (Fig S1A and B) . We further investigated in detail the effect of LecB on IGF-1R because of its higher fold enrichment. We hypothesised that LecB interaction with IGF-1R triggers receptor internalisation. Indeed, surface staining experiments showed that IGF-1R is depleted from the plasma membrane of keratinocytes in a time-dependent manner as a consequence of LecB incubation (Fig 2B and C) . Concurrently, we observed an intracellular redistribution of the receptor, which accumulates in regions positive for the lysosomal marker protein LAMP1 ( Fig S1C) . This observation correlated with the strong increase of lysosomes upon treatment ( Fig S1D) and suggests that the receptor is targeted for degradation upon LecB. However, lysosomal degradation inhibition with bafilomycin A1 only partially restored IGF-1R levels ( Fig S1E and F) , indicating that LecB can act on other degradative pathways.",

Whereas the former ultimately results in the phosphorylation and activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), the latter activates the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). To determine whether these two signalling cascades were affected by LecB, we monitored ERK1/2 and mTOR phosphorylation at Thr202/Tyr204 and Ser2448, respectively. The amounts of phosphorylated proteins were normalised to the respective pan-proteins. Indeed, LecB did not lead to the phosphorylation of both ERK1/2 and mTOR (Fig 3A-D) . ERK1/2 phosphorylation actually significantly decreased 1 h poststimulation (Fig 3A and C) . In contrast, LecB activated 59 adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a cellular energy and nutrient status sensor, which is activated in response to cellular energy depletion (Fig 3A and E) . AMPK phosphorylation significantly increased 3 h post-stimulation and was inhibited by addition of L-fucose, confirming that this posttranslational modification is LecB dependent (Fig S3A and B) .",

Untreated keratinocytes presented several light content vacuoles (Category 1), corresponding to endo-lysosomal compartments ( Fig  4A) . In contrast, LecB-treated cells displayed numerous degradative vesicles (Category 2) and an additional type of vacuoles (Category 3), with irregular shapes and variable sizes ( Fig 4B) . Surprisingly, these vacuoles contained a large number of clearly defined intraluminal vesicles ( Fig 4B) and they appeared to cluster together to form an intricate network (Fig 4B, zoom) . To get insights into the origin of these structures, we performed a time-course experiment by collecting cells at different time points, from 30 min to 12 h after exposure to LecB (Fig S4A-E9 ). The Category 3 vacuoles were detectable after 30 min of LecB incubation, but they were quite rare. However, they became more prominent 3 h post-LecB exposure ( Fig S4D) . Interestingly, specific regions of the plasma membrane of the LecBtreated keratinocytes were extremely irregular and characterised by the presence of ruffle-like structures (Fig S4A-E) . As the number of Category 3 vesicles located at these regions increased over time, we hypothesised that the intraluminal vesicle-containing vacuoles originate from subdomains of the plasma membrane upon LecB interaction with surface proteins. This hypothesis implies that LecB is Figure 2 . LecB depletes IGF-1R from the plasma membrane without inducing its activation. (A) Western blot of eluted samples from pull-down assay. NHKs were stimulated in the presence of 5 \u03bcg/ml biotinylated LecB (106 nM). The lysates were incubated with streptavidin beads and further eluted. Western blot was performed and IGF-1R and LecB were detected in the precipitated fractions. (B, C) Surface staining of keratinocytes treated with LecB (5 \u03bcg/ml) for the indicated time points. (B) Images show maximum intensity projections. After stimulation, the cells were stained for IGF-1R (red) and DAPI (blue). Scale bar: 10 \u03bcm. (C) Quantification of IGF-1R surface intensity from n = 4 independent experiments. Bars display the mean value \u00b1 SEM. ** denotes P < 0.01; **** denotes P < 0.0001; one-way ANOVA was used for statistical analysis. (D) Representative blots from lysates after LecB (5 \u03bcg/ml) and IGF-1 (100 ng/ml) stimulation for the indicated times. Antibodies against different phosphorylation sites of IGF-1R (Tyr1131 and Tyr1135/1136) present in the Category 3 vacuoles. To test this, we exposed keratinocytes to biotinylated LecB before performing immunoelectron microscopy (IEM) using anti-biotin antibodies (Fig 4C-F) . Notably, we specifically detected LecB on both the limiting membrane of the Category 3 vacuoles and to a minor extent on their intraluminal vesicles ( Fig 4D) . Moreover, we also identified biotinylated LecB at the plasma membrane, where it was especially enriched in the ruffle-like regions (Fig 4F) , supporting the notion that LecB drives the formation of a plethora of intracellular vesicles originating from the plasma membrane.",

We found a time-dependent colocalisation of LecB with microtubule-associated proteins 1A/B light chain 3B (LC3) and rasrelated protein Rab-9A (RAB9A), which are generally enriched on autophagosomes and late endosomes, respectively (Fig 5A and B) . Moreover, but to a minor extent, we also observed a time-dependent colocalisation between LecB and lysosomal-associated membrane glycoprotein 1 (LAMP1) (Fig S5A) . In contrast, no colocalisation with the recycling endosome marker protein ras-related protein Rab-11 (RAB11) was detected (Fig S5B) . Endocytosis and internalisation of LecB was also assessed biochemically by analysing the ubiquitination of the proteins associated with LecB, as a large number of growth factor receptors undergo ubiquitination upon endocytosis (Sehat et al, 2008; Haglund & Dikic, 2012) . In a time-course pull-down experiment, we detected a decrease of the coprecipitated levels of IGF-1R and an increase of the ubiquitin levels in the eluted fraction, indicating that LecB-interacting partners are ubiquitinated, thus very likely internalised (Fig 5C and D) .",

            "text": "As we saw a time-dependent increase in colocalisation between LC3 and LecB structures (Fig 5A) , we decided to investigate this further. LC3 is an ubiquitin-like protein that upon autophagy induction is converted from a cytoplasmic form (i.e., LC3-I) to one associated with the autophagosomal membranes (i.e., LC3-II) through conjugation to phosphatidylethanolamine (Kabeya et al, 2004) . LC3-II can also be generated on the limiting membrane of endosomes during processes such as LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP) (Sanjuan et al, 2007; Florey et al, 2011) . The fact that LecB was detected on single-membrane vacuoles (autophagosomes are double-membrane vesicles with cytoplasmic content) that are positive for RAB9 (Figs 4D and 5B) , inferred in an activation of LAPlike pathway. Although induction of both autophagy and LAP induces the formation of LC3-II, only autophagy leads to the degradation of this conjugate (Tanida et al, 2005) . Indeed, we observed a timedependent increase of LC3-II levels upon exposure of keratinocytes to LecB (Fig 6A and B) . However, this protein was not turned over because no difference in LC3-II levels could be observed when LecB-treated keratinocytes were incubated with either bafilomycin A1 or cycloheximide to assess LC3-II stability (Fig S6A-D) . To clarify the origin of LC3-II, we silenced ATG13 (Fig S6E and F) , an essential component of the ULK kinase complex, which is required for macroautophagy (Ganley et al, 2009 ) and dispensable for LAP (Florey et al, 2011; Martinez et al, 2011) . Our results revealed that LC3-II formation upon cell treatment with LecB is ATG13 independent (Fig S6E and G) . Furthermore, when we performed LecB treatment in combination with cytochalasin D, an inhibitor of actin polymerization, we found a decrease in LecB uptake (Fig S7A and B) , indicating that actin is important for LecB internalisation.",

Indeed, we found colocalisation between IGF-1R, LC3, and LecB ( Fig 6C) , but interestingly, we did not observe LC3 recruitment onto membranes when cells were treated exclusively with IGF-1 ( Fig S8) . Finally, we examined another receptor, the transferrin receptor (TfR), which was not pulled down by LecB ( Fig  S9) . Unlike IGF-1R and other growth factor receptors, which can be internalised via clathrin-independent mechanisms (Boucrot et al, 2015) , TfR enters the cells via clathrin-mediated endocytosis and it is recycled back to the plasma membrane upon iron delivery (Hopkins & Trowbridge, 1983) . Interestingly, whereas we observed colocalisation between IGF-1R and LC3 (Fig 6D) , we did not detect changes in TfR distribution nor LC3 colocalisation upon LecB treatment (Fig 6E) . This is supported by the absence of colocalisation between LecB and RAB11 compartments as well ( Fig S5B) and suggests that LecB preferentially commits receptors to degradation, thereby affecting their signalling.",

This study provides new insights into the role of P. aeruginosa lectin LecB as virulence factor that impairs growth factor receptor signalling and trafficking, thereby affecting keratinocyte fitness. Pull-down studies showed the co-isolation of LecB with several plasma membrane receptors in keratinocytes, among which IGF-1R and EGFR were two of the principal interactors. We further demonstrated that LecB depletes IGF-1R from the plasma and against total IGF-1R were used. Tubulin was used as loading control. (E, F, G) Blot quantification. Phosphorylated IGF-1R (E, F) and total IGF-1R levels (G) are represented as fold change compared with the loading control from n = 3 independent experiments. * denotes P < 0.05; *** denotes P < 0.001; two-way ANOVA was used for statistical analysis. membrane by inducing its internalisation. To modulate signalling, IGF-1R (as well as EGFR) needs to be activated by ligand binding and consequent autophosphorylation on three tyrosine residues (i.e., Tyr1135, Tyr1131, and Tyr1136) in its C-terminal tail (Favelyukis et al, 2001; Sousa et al, 2012) . Interestingly, unlike IGF-1, LecB triggers IGF-1R endocytic trafficking towards degradative compartments without receptor activation.",

            "text": "PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK signalling cascades have been intensively investigated for their role in promoting cell and organismal growth upon growth factor signals. This is mainly achieved by AKT-mediated activation of mTOR, which is a key regulator of anabolic processes necessary during cell growth (Nave et al, 1999; Dennis et al, 2001) and by the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, which results in cell proliferation (Rossomando et al, 1991; Meloche & Pouyss\u00e9gur, 2007) . We found that neither mTOR nor ERK1/2 is activated upon cell exposure to LecB. Specifically, we observed a decrease in the levels of phospho-ERK1/2 after 1 h of LecB treatment, which correlates with an increase of phospho-AMPK. Reciprocal feedback loops have been described to operate between the AMPK and the MAPK/ERK pathways and, whereas ERK1/2 activation was reported to be attenuated upon stimulation of WT MEFs with the AMPK activator A-769662, little effect on ERK1/2 phosphorylation was detected when AMPK-null MEFs were used (Zheng et al, 2009; Shen et al, 2013) . The suppression of cell survival signalling pathways can also clarify the arrest of the cell cycle in the G1/S transition observed upon LecB incubation. ERK1/2 activity is in fact required for both the cell cycle entry and the suppression of negative cell cycle regulators. Specifically, cyclin D1 expression is enhanced by the activation of the MAPK/ERK pathway (Lavoie et al, 1996; Weber et al, 1997) , via the transcription factors c-Fos (Burch et al, 2004) and Myc (Seth et al, 1991) . Cells, entering into the S phase show low levels of cyclin D1, which is again induced and reaches high levels to ensure the progression into the G2 phase (Yang et al, 2006) . LecB stimulation mediates a strong reduction of cyclin D1, whose levels are not restored over time, resulting in the arrest of the cell cycle and subsequential induction of cell death. Therefore, we speculate that LecB, despite devoid of catalytic activity, may contribute in promoting tissue damage to facilitate bacterial dissemination and extracellular multiplication during wound infections. Furthermore, it is possible that LecB induces a similar fate to other cell types, including immune cells, thus further promoting the infection. Future work will provide new insights on the impact of LecB on the immune response during chronic wound infections.",

            "text": "Interestingly, the cytotoxic effect of LecB was preceded by an extensive cytoplasmic vacuolation. Electron microscopy inspection of LecB-treated cells revealed the peculiar nature of these vacuoles that accumulate over time and display an increased number of intraluminal vesicles. We also show that these vacuoles probably originate from ruffle-like plasma membrane regions where LecB was also found to be enriched. In the case of other bacterial lectins, such as the B-subunit of Shiga toxin (StxB) from Shigella dysenteriae and LecA from P. aeruginosa, the sole interaction with the glycosphingolipid receptor globotriaosyl ceramide (Gb3) is sufficient to drive membrane shape changes leading to their subsequent uptake (R\u00f6mer et al, 2007; Eierhoff et al, 2014) . In the case of LecB, however, pull-down experiments point to the existence of several receptors, also attributable to the fact that fucosylation is a very common modification. LecB exists as a tetramer and each monomer possesses a binding pocket with the highest affinity to L-fucose and its derivatives (Garber et al, 1987; Sabin et al, 2006) . Although the L-fucose dissociation constant is in the micromolar range (2.9 \u03bcM), an increase in avidity can be achieved by a higher degree of interactions. This implies that LecB might crosslink several different surface receptors, thus inducing a higher degree of membrane rearrangements that could explain the extensive alterations at the plasma membrane. Moreover, multiple interactions could provide the bacterium with additional resources for the initiation of host tissue colonisation.",

Immunofluorescence experiments revealed a time-dependent increase of colocalisation between LecB and Rab-9, LC3, and LAMP-1. Therefore, our data indicate that LC3 is recruited on LecB containing late endosomes, which may further favour their lysosomal degradation through a process that may be similar or identical to LAP. LAP can be triggered by several receptors. In addition to toll-like receptors, whose signalling during phagocytosis rapidly recruits LC3 to phagosomes, the phosphatidylserine receptor TIM4, or the C-type lectin dectin-1 can also induce LAP to efficiently clear dead cells and to facilitate antigen presentation, respectively (Sanjuan et al, 2007; Martinez et al, 2011; Ma et al, 2012) . LC3 can associate with single-membrane phagosomes even in the absence of pathogens or dead cells, such in the case of phagocytosis and degradation of photoreceptor outer segments by retinal pigment epithelium or during the secretion of mucins in goblet cells (Kim et al, 2013; Patel et al, 2013) . Our data indicate that IGF-1R colocalises with LecB and LC3, suggesting that LAP or an LAP-like pathway is involved in IGF-1R sorting for degradation, after LecB-induced receptor internalisation.",

From here, they can either be sorted to lysosomal degradation via multivesicular bodies or they can be recycled back to the plasma membrane. The equilibrium between IGF-1R degradation and recycling is essential to modulate receptor signalling (Morrione et al, 1997; Monami et al, 2008) . Our data demonstrate that IGF-1R trafficking is subverted upon cell treatment with LecB, which induces the sorting of this receptor towards degradative routes, without activating it. We do not know yet whether there is a direct or indirect interaction between LecB and IGF-1R, despite being co-isolated as complex. However, because IGF-1R is not the sole protein interacting with LecB in keratinocytes, we speculate that this \"targeting for degradation\" strategy can be valid for other plasma membrane receptors as well (e.g., EGFR) and that it can be used by P. aeruginosa to silence host cell receptors to favour tissue colonisation in wounds. Wound infections represent a socioeconomic burden for the health care system and, given that P. aeruginosa is very hard to eliminate with the available antibiotics, there is urgent need for the development of alternative therapeutic strategies (Norberg et al, 2017; Sommer et al, 2018) . Our findings shed new light on the P. aeruginosa lectin LecB, showing that it is capable of inducing a succession of cellular events, despite being devoid of catalytic activity and by virtue of its sole capability to bind to sugar moieties on the plasma membrane. This knowledge paves the way for a better understanding of P. aeruginosa wound infections.",
