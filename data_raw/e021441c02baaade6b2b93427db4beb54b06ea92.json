To describe the main genotypes that caused infections in S\u00e3o Paulo (2013)(2014)(2015) and to analyze their clinical/epidemiological features. Methods. 94 infants (0-6 months) with bronchiolitis were studied. Clinical/epidemiological information was collected; a search for 16 viruses in nasopharyngeal secretion (PCR-real-time and conventional, sequencing, and phylogenetic analyses) was performed. Results. The mean age was 2.4 m; 48% were male. The mean length of hospital stay was 4.4 d (14% in the Intensive Care Unit). The positive rate of respiratory virus was 98.9%; 73 cases (77.6%) were HRSV (76,7% HRSVA). HRSVA formed three clusters: ON1 ( = 34), NA1 ( = 1), and NA2 ( = 4). All HRSVB were found to cluster in the BA genotype (BA9-= 10; BA10-= 3). Clinical analyses showed no significant differences between the genotype AON1 and other genotypes. Conclusion. This study showed a high rate of HRSV detection in bronchiolitis. HRSVA ON1, which has recently been described in other countries and has not been identified in previous studies in the southeast region of Brazil, was predominant. The clinical characteristics of the infants that were infected with AON1 were similar to infants with infections by other genotypes.",

The second hypervariable region of the G protein gene PCR was carried out with the primers Gr5_fwd (5 -CTGGCAATGATAATCTCAACTTC-3 ) and FV_rev (5 -GTTATGACACTGGTATACCAACC-3 ) in a 10 L mixture that contained 5 L of 10x PCR buffer, 25 mM of each dNTP, 25 pmol of each primer, and 1.5 U of Platinum Taq DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) for a final volume of 50 L. The amplification was performed in a GeneAmp PCR System 9700 thermocycler (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). A second step with Seminested PCR was carried out using the F1AB_rev (5 -CAACTCCATTGTTATTTGCC-3 ) primer corresponding to bases 3-22 of the F gene. The traditional PCR assays were performed with the following program: 95 \u2218 C for 5 minutes, followed by 35 cycles, each composed of 30 sec at 95 \u2218 C, 30 sec at 55 \u2218 C, and 45 sec at 72 \u2218 C, and finally 7 minutes of extension at 72 \u2218 C. The amplified products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized under UV light after staining with ethidium bromide. The amplified products of gene G were \u2248490 bp, were purified by ExoSap-IT (Affymetrix, Inc., USA), and were submitted to a cycle sequencing reaction (Sanger) using the Bigdye terminator kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) and GR5, FV or F1AB primers in a 3100 DNA Sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).

The Brazilian HRSV B isolates were most closely related to isolates from the United States, New Zealand, and Vietnam. Some authors suggest the occurrence of a greater number of cases during seasons in which new genotypes predominate. This could be a result of the absence of immunity acquired by the population against the new genotypes [4, 15] . Genotype A ON1 shows a duplication of 72 nucleotides in the Cterminal third of the G gene. The region of the G protein encoded by this gene sequence is targeted by specific genotype neutralizing antibodies, which may contribute to the escape of the virus from the population immunity induced by previous contact with other genotypes. However, according to the National Registry of Hospitalization Cases, there was no increase in the frequency of hospitalizations of infants diagnosed with bronchiolitis between 2013 and 2015 in Brazil and the State of S\u00e3o Paulo compared to the previous five years [16] . It is possible that, acting as a controller, the immunity of the population only contributes to the selection of genotypes that replace each other without necessarily increasing the number of cases when genotypes without recent incidences appear. The demographic and clinical characteristics of the infants that were infected with genotype AON1 were similar to the characteristics of the other genotypes. Exclusion of infants with viral codetection and those who received antimicrobials during hospitalization made it possible to avoid confounding factors in the comparative analysis of the severity between the genotypes.",

Additionally, the age group was a differential factor since children up to 5 years of age were included, including infants with bronchiolitis and also cases of posterior HRSV infections [19] . Other authors found fewer signs of severity in children infected by HRSV A ON1 compared to other HRSV genotypes, such as NA1 [7] , GA2, and BA [20] .
