Exposure to fugitive emissions generated during aerosol therapy increases the risk of the unnecessary inhalation of medication, as well as toxic side effects. Methods: This study examines fugitively-emitted aerosol emissions when nebulising albuterol sulphate, as a tracer aerosol, using two commercially available nebulisers in combination with an open or valved facemask or using a mouthpiece with and without a filter on the exhalation port. Each combination was connected to a breathing simulator during simulated adult breathing. The inhaled dose and residual mass were quantified using UV spectrophotometry. Time-varying fugitively-emitted aerosol concentrations and size distributions during nebulisation were recorded using aerodynamic particle sizers at two distances relative to the simulated patient. Different aerosol concentrations and size distributions were observed depending on the interface. Results: Within each nebuliser, the facemask combination had the highest time-averaged fugitively-emitted aerosol concentration, and values up to 0.072 \u00b1 0.001 mg m \u22123 were recorded. The placement of a filter on the exhalation port of the mouthpiece yielded the lowest recorded concentrations. The mass median aerodynamic diameter of the fugitively-emitted aerosol was recorded as 0.890 \u00b1 0.044 \u00b5m, lower the initially generated medical aerosol in the range of 2-5 \u00b5m. Conclusions: The results highlight the potential secondary inhalation of exhaled aerosols from commercially available nebuliser facemask/mouthpiece combinations. The results will aid in developing approaches to inform policy and best practices for risk mitigation from fugitive emissions.",

Additionally, it was concluded that greater than 45% of the nominal dose could become 'second-hand medical aerosol' [16] . High-definition video imaging studies used previously-inhaled saline aerosol and smoke particles to estimate the dispersion distance of exhaled air for various systems. Exhaled droplets were observed exiting the side vents of a facemask, and substantial exposure to exhaled air was reported to occur within 0.8 m [17] . Nebuliser airflow, lung function and interface type were all reported to impact upon dispersion distance [18] [19] [20] [21] . A limitation of the visualisation approach is that the visible boundaries of exhaled flows could only be used as a guide to the real behaviour of droplets in exhaled air [22] .",

These were a vibrating mesh (VMN) used in combination with an aerosol chamber (Aerogen Solo/Ultra, Aerogen, Galway, Ireland) and a jet (JN) (Cirrus 2, Intersurgical, Wokingham, United Kingdom), both in clinical use today. This study incorporated two non-invasive ventilation interfaces (facemask and mouthpiece) in combination with the commercially available aerosol generators. The VMN used a valved facemask, while the JN used an open facemask. For the mouthpiece scenarios, both an unfiltered mouthpiece and filtered mouthpiece were used with each setup. A filtered mouthpiece refers to a filter placed on the exhalation port, while an unfiltered mouthpiece refers to the case where no filter is placed on the exhalation port. To replicate the ideal conditions achieved when a patient uses an interface correctly, each mask was glued to a plastic sheet to avoid a leak, while the mouthpieces were attached using a custom fixture. A supplemental gas flow rate of 6 L/min was used with the VMN and the manufacturer-prescribed 8 L/min was used for the JN.",

Table 2 confirms that fugitive emissions were recorded during the nebulisation events for the facemask and unfiltered mouthpiece combinations. There was no recorded increase in aerosol concentration when using the VMN/filtered mouthpiece, while increased aerosol concentrations were recorded for the JN/filtered mouthpiece. It can be seen from Table 2 that the use of VMN/unfiltered mouthpiece and JN/unfiltered mouthpiece combinations resulted in reduced exhaled aerosol concentrations compared with the corresponding facemask. The temporal variations in the aerosol concentrations when using the jet nebuliser resulted in a larger difference between the two APS readings for the open facemask combination compared with the other configurations. The largest variations in aerosol concentrations between the two APSs occurred during the nebulisation period; in all cases, there was less than a 10% averaged difference between the two sets of measurements in the final 15 min after nebulisation, which indicates the diffusion of fugitive emissions throughout the room. Table 3 summarises the averaged MMAD over the 30-min period recorded by the APS 0.8 metres from the facemask/mouthpiece. There is a noticeable shift in the MMAD during the nebulisation event when using the facemask/mouthpiece compared with the initially-generated aerosol. Table 3 . Thirty-minute averaged aerosol concentration during each nebulisation event (using different facemasks and mouthpieces); mean and standard deviations over the three events.

However, the MMAD of the fugitive emissions ranged between 0.860-1.437 \u00b5m across all nebuliser combinations, indicating that a considerably smaller aerosol size fraction is released than originally generated by the nebuliser. This is a significant finding, as the lower size fractions remain airborne for extended periods of time [29] .",

In both cases, the unfiltered mouthpiece had reduced fugitive emissions compared with the facemask. Since there was no appreciable change in the residual drug analysis for the different facemask/mouthpiece combinations, it can be concluded that the mouthpieces' shape and size do not influence inertial impaction and deposition [36] . For the filtered mouthpiece combination, while there were some observed fugitive emissions from JN/filtered mouthpiece combination compared with the VMN, it is possible that the higher driving force required for the normal operation of the JN/mouthpiece caused additional system pressure, allowing aerosol to escape through the custom fixture; however, it is unclear if this would be replicated with a human patient. An earlier imaging study observed no emitted droplets when a respiratory filter was placed on the exhalation port [17] . Other research shows that attaching an exhalation filter to the nebuliser was 93% effective in capturing exhaled aerosol droplets [37] . Facemask design may also contribute to this. By necessity, compressor-driven jet nebulisers must be operated with an open facemask; i.e., one without valves. This, in combination with the continual positive pressure air flow, acts to force aerosol out of the device and into the environment throughout both the inhalation and exhalation cycles of the breath. This is not the case with the vibrating mesh nebulisers, where a driving air flow is not required for aerosol generation, and the valve system on the device described aids in building a reservoir of aerosol within the patient interface which is available for the next breath.",

An adult breathing pattern in combination with a facemask/mouthpiece was used to replicate a standard nebuliser treatment and monitor the consequent release of fugitive emissions. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study that quantifies time-series aerosol concentrations and the size distribution of fugitive emissions that result from standard nebuliser treatment. The findings confirm a potential exposure risk to caregivers and other bystanders to medical aerosols and highlight that variations in patient interfaces (facemask and mouthpiece) and aerosol generators (VMN and JN) influence fugitively-emitted aerosol concentrations. The purpose of this study is to aid in developing approaches for healthcare organisations to inform policy and best practices for risk mitigation from fugitive emissions. Future studies should focus on investigating these factors in a real-life clinical scenario. ",
