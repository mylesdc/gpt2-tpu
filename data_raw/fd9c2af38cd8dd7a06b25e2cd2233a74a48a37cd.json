A series of other viruses were tested by the RT-RPA.Thirty-two field samples were further tested by RT-RPA, and the resuts were compared with those obtained by the real-time RT-PCR. Results: The RT-RPA assay was performed successfully at 40\u00b0C, and the results were obtained within 3 min-12 min. The assay could detect CDV, but did not show cross-detection of canine parvovirus-2 (CPV-2), canine coronavirus (CCoV), canine parainfluenza virus (CPIV), pseudorabies virus (PRV) or Newcastle disease virus (NDV), demonstrating high specificity. The analytical sensitivity of RT-RPA was 31.8 copies in vitro transcribed CDV RNA, which is 10 times lower than the real-time RT-PCR. The assay performance was validated by testing 32 field samples and compared to real-time RT-PCR. The results indicated an excellent correlation between RT-RPA and a reference real-time RT-PCR method. Both assays provided the same results, and R 2 value of the positive results was 0.947.",

CDV is a nonsegmented, negative-stranded, enveloped RNA virus that belongs to the family Paramyxoviridae and the genus Morbillivirus, and is one of the most lethal infectious agents in both susceptible free-living and captive carnivores [2] . CDV-infected dogs may develop respiratory, gastrointestinal, dermatologic, ophthalmic or neurological disorders, that appear simultaneously or sequentially [3, 4] . The broad spectrum of clinical signs, not dissimilar from the signs observed in other respiratory and enteric diseases of dogs, hampers accurate and early clinical diagnosis of canine distemper [5] . Therefore, rapid and accurate diagnosis of CDV infection would enable veterinarians to implement appropriate strategies in time to improve disease management and prevent outbreaks, particularly within a shelter environment.",

As with PCR, the use of two opposing primers allows exponential amplification of the target sequence in RPA, but the latter is tolerant to 5-9 mismatches in primer and probe showing no influence on the performance of the assay [12] [13] [14] . It is thought that RPA possesses superiority in speed, portability and accessibility over PCR [15] . Indeed, RPA has recently been explored to replace PCR for the molecular detection of diverse pathogens with different detection strategies, e.g., bacteria, fungi, parasites and viruses [13, [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . In this study, the development of a real-time RT-RPA assay for simple, rapid, portable and POC detection of CDV was described. The fluorescence in the assay is produced by an exo probe which is detected with a portable, user-friendly tube scanner (Genie III, OptiGene Limited, West Sussex, United Kingdom). The Genie III used in the study weighs only 1.75 kg, measuring 25 cm \u00d7 16.5 cm \u00d7 8.5 cm, and incorporates a rechargeable battery that can support operation for a whole day, making it suitable for pointof-care testing.",

All reagents except for the viral template and magnesium acetate were prepared in a master mix, which was distributed into each 0.2 mL freeze-dried reaction tube containing a dried enzyme pellet. One \u03bcL of viral RNA was added to the tubes. Subsequently, magnesium acetate was pipetted into the tube lids, then the lids were closed carefully, the magnesium acetate was centrifuged into the rehydrated material using a minispin centrifuge. The sample was vortexed briefly and spun down once again, and the tubes were immediately placed in the Genie III scanner device to start the reaction at 40\u00b0C for 20 min. The fluorescence signal was collected in real-time and would increase markedly due to successful amplification.",

Specificity analysis revealed that the RT-RPA assay could only detect the CDV, but not other viruses (Fig. 1) . Other CDV genotypes were not included in the assay except for the genotype America-2, which is deficiency of the study. The RPA is tolerant to 5-9 mismatches in primer and probe showing no influence on the performance of the assay [12] [13] [14] , and there were only 2-4 mismatches in the primers and probe in this study with other CDV genotypes. It is assumed the assay would detect all genotypes of CDV, based on targeting a conserved region, but this was not confirmed by testing validated genotypes. The detection limit of the RT-RPA was 9.4 copies, which was 10 times lower than the real-time RT-PCR described previously [8] . We further evaluated this method using clinical samples, and the diagnosis agreement of the RT-RPA and real-time RT-PCR was 100%. Interpretations were limited by the small sample-size, but In recent years, a number of isothermal DNA amplification methods have been developed as a simple, rapid alternative to PCR-based amplification. In the RT-LAMP assay for CDV, four primers were needed and the optimal reaction condition was 60 min at 65\u00b0C [9] . The developed iiPCR could detect as low as 7.6 copies of CDV RNA in approximately 1 h [1] . For the RT-RPA assay developed in this paper, it could detect 9.4 copies of CDV RNA in 12 min, which was more rapid than the above assays. Compared to other isothermal amplification techniques, RPA requires no initial heating for DNA denaturation, and the results could be obtained in less than 20 min; RPA demonstrates a certain tolerance to common PCR inhibitors, and could tolerate a wide range of biological samples [11] ; RPA reagents in the lyophilized pellet form could be delivered and stored without cold chain, which could perform satisfactory at 25\u00b0C for up to 12 weeks and at 45\u00b0C for up to 3 weeks [24] . Thus, RPA may be the most applicable approach for the field and point-of-care diagnosis of infectious diseases [11] .

The reaction condition was set as follows: 50\u00b0C for 30 min; 94\u00b0C for 2 min; 32 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 30 s, 55\u00b0C for 30 s and 72\u00b0C for 60 s. The resulting fragment was purified with the Gel Extraction Kit (Tiangen, Beijing, China), ligated into a pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) and transformed into E.coli DH5\u03b1 chemically competent cells (Dingguo, Beijing, China) according to standard procedures. Positive clones were identified by sequencing analysis. The recombinant plasmid DNA was linearized by Nde I (Takara, Dalian, China), purified using the Wizard SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up System (Promega, Madison, USA) and transcribed in vitro with the RiboMAX Large Scale RNA Production System-T7 (Promega, Madison, USA). In vitro transcribed CDV RNA was digested with the supplied RQ1 RNase-free DNase and purified. It is 97 nucleotides from the T7 promoter region to the NdeI cut site of the pGEM-T Easy vector. All transcripts generated were about 1669 nucleotides in length and approximate size and RNA integrity were verified by agarose gel electrophoresis. The in vitro transcripts were quantified using a ND-2000c spectrophotometer (NanoDrop, Wilmington, USA), and the copy number of RNA molecules was calculated by the following formula[23]: Amount (copies/\u03bcL = [RNA concentration (g/\u03bcL) /(transcript length in nucleotides \u00d7 340) \u00d7 6.02 \u00d7 10 23 .",
