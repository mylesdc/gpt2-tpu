We examined the relationship between cold and/or dry air and daily influenza and pneumonia mortality in the cold season in the New York metropolitan area from 1975-2002. We conducted a retrospective study relating daily pneumonia and influenza mortality for New York City and surroundings from 1975-2002 to daily air temperature, dew point temperature (a measure of atmospheric humidity), and daily air mass type. We identified high mortality days and periods and employed temporal smoothers and lags to account for the latency period and the time between infection and death. Unpaired t-tests were used to compare high mortality events to non-events and nonparametric bootstrapped regression analysis was used to examine the characteristics of longer mortality episodes. We found a statistically significant (p = 0.003) association between periods of low dew point temperature and above normal pneumonia and influenza mortality 17 days later. The duration (r = 20.61) and severity (r = 20.56) of high mortality episodes was inversely correlated with morning dew point temperature prior to and during the episodes. Weeks in which moist polar air masses were common (air masses characterized by low dew point temperatures) were likewise followed by above normal mortality 17 days later (p = 0.019). This research supports the contention that cold, dry air may be related to influenza mortality and suggests that warning systems could provide enough lead time to be effective in mitigating the effects.",

            "text": "Recent research examining climatic influences on influenza transmission has galvanized interest in this topic. Airborne transmission of Influenza A/Panama virus between guinea pigs was more likely at low temperatures and relative humidities [4] . Because temperature is physically/mathematically linked to relative humidity and thus confounds interpretation, a mass-based humidity measure (such as specific humidity or vapor pressure) provides a stronger relationship to influenza transmission [5] . Given the cold-season decline in specific humidity in temperate climates, a retrospective study [6] showed an association between year-to-year humidity variations and the timing of the influenza seasonal onset in U.S. states. This differs from tropical locations which generally lack a seasonal influenza peak [7] . One theory is that tropical climates are dominated by direct contact transmission which, unlike airborne transmission, is not influenced by air temperature and humidity [7] .",

Correlations exist between the number of upper respiratory infections and cold-air outbreaks [13] . It is commonly assumed that winter indoor crowding enhances influenza virus transmission, though direct evidence is lacking [8] . Low humidity conditions, which are often but not always accompanied by low temperatures, enhance survival times of viral aerosols [14] , [15] , [16] .

Our study examines daily mortality, and statistical robustness is enhanced when the daily sample size is sufficiently large. Weather obviously has a high spatial variability, so it is important that the observed weather be representative of the environmental conditions likely experienced by the decedents. In addition, New York City's mid-latitude location provides a high degree of both interannual and intra-annual variability in weather and climate, so this variability provides a wider range of sample conditions. Thus, New York City has both a large enough population to provide a consistent daily mortality signal while the population density is high enough that the weather observed at a single station is sufficiently representative of conditions experienced throughout the metropolitan area.",

These diseases are commonly combined as an endpoint because of specific challenges associated with influenza. First, the number of deaths attributable to influenza is difficult to estimate directly because of a lack of virologically-confirmed infections. Second, many influenza-associated deaths occur from secondary complications when influenza viruses are no longer detectable by laboratory means [6] , [23] , [24] , [25] . Third, the use of P&I mortality in the study of influenza also reflects the problems associated with other measures of prevalence of influenza. Reporting of cases of influenza through routine channels is unsatisfactory because mild influenza may be under-diagnosed and the use of laboratory confirmation is skewed by the impact of variable testing patterns based on prevalence of disease [26] . Finally, multiple studies have shown that there exists a relationship between influenza morbidity and P&I mortality that can be mathematically described and used in epidemiological studies [3] , [27] , [28] , [29] , [30] , [31] .",

This procedure adjusts for temporal changes in age demographics over the period of record based on data for each county using U.S. Census archives, thereby allowing for consistent comparisons of mortality rates over time. After age standardization, the long-term mean for each day (within ICD period) was subtracted from that day's standardized P&I mortality to remove the inherent seasonal signal from the time series.

''Events'' are days with (smoothed) mortality at least one standard deviation above the long-term (smoothed) mean for that date. This z$1 criterion was chosen because the frequency distribution of smoothed mortality is positively skewed with the tail beginning at approximately one standard deviation. After smoothing, there is an obvious tendency for high mortality events to cluster into prolonged periods when the z$1 threshold is (Figure 2 ).

Although it may seem counter-intuitive that a ''moist'' air mass has a low dew point temperature, dew point must (physically) be less than or equal to air temperature, so cold air masses typically have low dew points, especially in winter. In general, Moist Polar air masses are relatively uncommon in the cold season in New York, occurring only 7.3% of the time (Table 4 ) and are associated with cold, overcast and often stormy conditions with moist air arriving from the Atlantic Ocean [33] . We also identified a significant relationship between low Moist Moderate air mass frequencies 3-4 weeks before mortality episodes. In an effort to understand this association, we calculated the correlation between Moist Moderate frequencies and the other air mass types during that period. Moist Moderate is negatively correlated with the two driest air masses-Dry Polar (r = 20.47) and Moist Polar (r = 20.31) (Table 4 ). Thus, the significant association between low Moist Moderate frequencies prior to P&I mortality events appears to be a proxy for the cool, low dew point conditions that are common when Moist Polar and Dry Polar air masses are present. On average, cold season dew points are 5.5uC higher in Moist Moderate air masses than in Moist Polar ( Table 4) .",

The time between infection and a resulting mortality event (i.e. ''latency'') varies between individuals depending on age, overall health, co-morbid conditions, and other factors. Thus, lags must be estimated to best fit the overall data structure. Similarly, the high frequency variability in the variables requires some smoothing to elucidate relationships, and the selection of appropriate smoothers is somewhat subjective. Nevertheless, our findings are consistent with several others. For example, there is evidence supporting a two-week lag between rising influenza virus and pneumonia mortality [28] . Other research showed fairly convincingly the existence of a 2-4 week lag between laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza and increased incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease [43] . The weather variables used in this study do not directly account for the ambient conditions experienced by the influenza victims while indoors, but cold and/or stormy weather could result in the decedents spending more time in heated indoor environs with low humidity, thereby enhancing infection opportunities [8] .",

These results should be confirmed using a similar methodology in other cities worldwide to determine if the humidity-influenza linkage is pervasive. It would be particularly interesting to determine how these relationships evolve in subtropical or tropical climates where the P&I mortality seasonality is more muted or nonexistent.",

            "text": "It is likely that the underlying causes of influenza seasonality are multi-factorial, and we suspect that weather is but one of those factors. A predictive model for P&I mortality based on weather alone would likely be unsuccessful in accounting for most of the short-term influenza variability. Nevertheless, our results confirm recent emerging hypotheses of a relationship between cold, dry air and influenza transmission or virulence [6] , [8] . Identifying periods of low dew point temperatures a few days or even weeks in advance is well within the skill of existing weather forecast models. Given the lag between infection and mortality, it seems reasonable to propose that, during the prime influenza season, skillful forecasts of high P&I mortality periods could be made weeks to months in advance. Figure S1 Sample of mortality data from December 1, 1998 through March 10, 1999 . Daily mortality (z-scores) (red dashed lines) shows evidence of the beginning of a prolonged peak starting around day 43. When these data are smoothed using a 17day centered moving average filter (solid red line), the mortality peak becomes more evident. In our analysis, we instead employ a leading 17-day smoother (blue line), which effectively shifts the red line forward by 8 days. High mortality episodes are classified when the z-scores exceeds 1, so the 1999 episodes begins on day 39 and ends on day 77. (TIF) The decline in dew point on day 10 preceded the start of the mortality increase by approximately 17 days. During the subsequent period of declining dew points, mortality continued to rise. When dew point reached its minimum for this period on day 31, 17-day lagged mortality was one standard deviation above the mean. Although there is no consistent 1:1 lagged relationship between dew point temperature and mortality, this example illustrates the procedure and shows a general linkage between a low dew point period in mid-late December, 1998 and a subsequent high pneumonia and influenza mortality anomaly several weeks later.
