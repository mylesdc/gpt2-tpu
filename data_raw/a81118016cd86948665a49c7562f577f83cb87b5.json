For each strain/material pair, an attempt was made to fit a first or second order model. All three independent predictor variables (temperature, relative humidity, and time) were significant in the models except that time was not significant for B. thuringiensis Al Hakam on nylon. Modeling was unsuccessful for wiring insulation and wet spores because there was complete spore inactivation in the majority of the experimental space. In cases where a predictive equation could be fit, response surface plots with time set to four days were generated. The survival of highly purified Bacillus spores can be predicted for most materials tested when given the settings for temperature, relative humidity, and time. These predictions were cross-checked with spore inactivation measurements.",

These issues increase decontamination costs and the cleanup time required after decontamination (Craig and Anderson 1995; Garverick 1994; Rutala et al. 2008; Koch et al. 2001; Herzberg 2012) . For example, decontamination and site remediation following the 2001 anthrax (B. anthracis) attacks cost in excess of 300 million US dollars and took 34 months to complete (Canter 2005; Buhr et al. 2012a) . Aircraft are of particular concern since they are a vehicle for global epidemic spread and are comprised of extremely sensitive equipment and materials (Moser et al. 1979; Olsen et al. 2003) . Because there are limited choices for aircraft interior decontamination, corrosive chemicals may be improperly selected and used in the event of potential international epidemics such as influenza or SARS. The use of corrosive chemicals may then undermine the integrity of the aircraft. Thus, there is a need to develop effective decontaminants with low corrosiveness and improved materials compatibility for various materials including, but not exclusive to those found on aircraft.",

Adjustment of these variables may be less damaging to materials compared to application of corrosive chemicals (Decker et al. 1954; Ehrlich et al. 1970; Holwitt et al. 2000) . Response surface methodology (RSM) (Beauregard et al. 1992; Myers et al. 2009 ) was coupled with the development of test methods to control time, temperature and relative humidity while safely containing spores (Buhr et al. 2012b ). Analogous to slow cooking, spore inactivation of spore-contaminated materials was tested using low temperatures and long times in order to explore the limits of sporicidal efficacy using hot, humid air. Six materials were chosen that were representative of materials found on aircraft: wiring insulation, polypropylene, aircraft performance coating on aluminum, nylon, InsulFab insulation and anti-skid tape on aluminum (Buhr et al. 2012b ). Decontamination of these materials using hot, humid air showed comparable spore kill kinetics among virulent B. anthracis Ames, attenuated B. anthracis \u0394Sterne and B. thuringiensis Al Hakam spores. In order to mitigate decontamination test costs and schedule associated with BSL3 testing of B. anthracis Ames in a large-scale design of experiments, B. anthracis \u0394Sterne and B. thuringiensis Al Hakam spores were selected for decontamination testing that measured decontamination on greater than 2,500 tests and controls with \u22657 logs of spores per test (Buhr et al. 2012b ). This manuscript focuses on describing the application of response surface methodology to experimental design and data analysis of the hot, humid air data. The objective is to mathematically describe the effectiveness of hot, humid air decontamination using first or second order polynomial surfaces and to determine the region of inactivating 6 logs of spores using the lower bound of a 90% confidence interval for the surface. This threshold was selected because it is a requirement for the Food and Drug Administration, Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Defense (Tomasino et al. 2008; Ryan et al. 2010; Buhr et al. 2012a) . The result of this research is a mathematical description that can help guide an end-user to find acceptable operating conditions depending on the material(s) to be decontaminated.

Envirotronics (Grand Rapids, MI) LH0010 environmental test chambers were used to control temperature and relative humidity during testing. Three test conditions were selected for each of the three test parameters of temperature, relative humidity and time. The highest (strongest) selected combination of conditions was expected to result in complete spore inactivation, the lowest (mildest) selected combination of conditions was expected to result in complete spore survival, and the midpoint selected was expected to result in partial spore inactivation. The test conditions were equally spaced in an attempt to generate a spore inactivation response curve for each strain/ substrate combination. The temperature limits considered took into account the goal of completely inactivating spores at the lowest temperature possible in order to meet materials temperature qualification limits. Based on preliminary decontamination test screening of virulent B. anthracis Ames, attenuated B. anthracis \u0394Sterne and B. thuringiensis Al Hakam spores, the upper limit for temperature and relative humidity was set at 77\u00b0C, 90% relative humidity because the data indicated that complete spore inactivation would be achieved within 7 days at this combination. For the lower limits, the temperature was set at 60\u00b0C, 60% relative humidity, conditions where spores were known to survive for multiple days. Initially, temperatures of 140, 155 and 170\u00b0F were selected, then converted to Celsius and rounded to 60, 68 and 77\u00b0C. The final test conditions for relative humidity were 60, 75, and 90%. The final conditions for time were 1, 4, and 7 days. Each temperature/relative humidity combination was above the dew point to prevent condensation.",

            "text": "In all modeled strain-material pairs but one, all three predictors (temperature, relative humidity, and time) were significant and each had an effect on spore inactivation. The exception was B. thuringiensis Al Hakam spores dried onto nylon webbing material, where time was not significant. Interestingly, for B. anthracis \u0394Sterne on two materials (InsulFab and polypropylene), relative humidity was the most significant second order pure quadratic term. The most difficult materials to model were nylon webbing and polypropylene (dried plastic tubes) where a piecewise modeling strategy was required to fit B. was least effective at inactivating spores on nylon. This may be due to the porous and/or hydrophobic properties of nylon. For wet spores and those dried onto wiring insulation, the majority of test runs showed complete inactivation. For wet spores of both strains, the cases without complete inactivation were at the lowest setting for temperature with only one exception. For spores of both strains on wiring insulation, the conditions without complete inactivation all had two or more predictors at the lowest settings.",

            "text": "The mathematical models were cross-checked with published spore survival results for high purity spores of B. anthracis \u0394Sterne and B. thuringiensis Al Hakam (Buhr et al. 2012b ). The published data set consisted of total of 210 combinations of strain/substrate/temperature/ relative humidity/time including the six substrates and the wet control (seven total). Data was compiled from 1,330 test samples and 1,330 room temperature controls over 19 independent test runs (Buhr et al. 2012b ). These published data were cross-checked with the contour graphs. Spore inactivation data of less than 6-log was below the 90% lower statistical confidence line (higher practical confidence), and spore inactivation data of greater than 6-log was above the 90% lower statistical confidence line. Thus each spore inactivation/decontamination datum was located at a logical position in the contour graphs. Both the published decontamination results and the mathematical models showed that B. anthracis \u0394Sterne and B. thuringiensis Al Hakam spores were similarly decontaminated, although B. thuringiensis Al Hakam spores survived slightly better on some substrates, such as polypropylene, under the mildest temperature/relative humidity/time conditions. This work demonstrates the use of statistical methods to design biological decontamination experiments at the limits of decontamination technology and to analyze the resultant data. The fitted equations specific to strain and material permit a broad range of end-users with varying requirements and constraints the ability to predict the success of hot, humid air treatments on specific materials based on achievable temperature and relative humidity conditions and permissible decontamination times.",
