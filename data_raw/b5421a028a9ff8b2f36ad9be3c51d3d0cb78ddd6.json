Here we investigate the mechanism of this effect for the first time, establishing that redistribution of Rev by Nullbasic is not due to direct interaction between the two proteins. Rather, Nullbasic affects subcellular localization of cellular proteins that regulate Rev trafficking. In particular, Nullbasic induced redistribution of exportin 1 (CRM1), nucleophosmin (B23) and nucleolin (C23) from the nucleolus to the nucleus when Rev was coexpressed, but never in its absence. Inhibition of the Rev:CRM1 interaction by leptomycin B or a non-interacting RevM10 mutant completely blocked redistribution of Rev by Nullbasic. Finally, Nullbasic did not inhibit importin bor transportin 1-mediated nuclear import, suggesting that cytoplasmic accumulation of Rev was due to increased export by CRM1. Overall, our data support the conclusion that CRM1dependent subcellular redistribution of Rev from the nucleolus by Nullbasic is not through general perturbation of either nuclear import or export. Rather, Nullbasic appears to interact with and disrupt specific components of a Rev trafficking complex required for its nucleocytoplasmic shuttling and, in particular, its nucleolar accumulation.",

Tat and Rev are similar in size; Tat is typically 101 amino acids long and Rev is typically 116 amino acids long, and both have RNA binding domains composed of arginine and, in the case of Tat, lysine residues which bind to different HIV-1 RNA stem loop structures. Tat binds to an RNA structure in the 59 untranslated region (UTR) of all viral transcripts called the Trans-Activation Response element (TAR), while Rev binds to an intronic region retained by incompletely spliced transcripts called the Rev Response Element (RRE). The RNA binding domains of both proteins also function as a nuclear/nucleolar localization signal (NLS/NoLS), although recent evidence implies that Tat may passively enter the nucleus by diffusing through nuclear pores [2] . Both proteins are localized primarily in the nucleus; Tat is observed throughout the nucleoplasm with nucleolar accumulation, whereas the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling Rev concentrates in the nucleolus in addition to localizing to the nucleoplasm and, to a lesser extent, to the cytoplasm.",

Many other cellular proteins can contribute to Rev nuclear export, including hRIP/Rab, eIF5A, DDX3, DDX1, RNA helicase A, and PIMT that act through Rev, and Matrin 3 and Sam68 that bind to viral mRNA [3, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12] . The Rev:mRNA complex disassembles in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1, step 3) allowing Rev to recycle back to the nucleus using the transportin 1 or importin b nuclear import pathways (Fig. 1, step 4) [3] . Once Rev enters the nucleus, nucleophosmin (B23) facilitates transport of Rev to the nucleolus (Fig. 1 , step 5) [13] . B23 is reported to be necessary for the nucleolar localization of both Rev and Tat through interaction with their respective basic domains [13, 14, 15, 16, 17] .",

Like similarly mutated one-exon Tat mutants, Nullbasic exhibits transdominant negative effects on Tat-dependent HIV-1 gene expression [18] . However, unlike previously reported mutants [19, 20, 21] , Nullbasic also effectively suppresses the steady state levels of unspliced and singly-spliced viral mRNA, an activity caused by the inhibition of HIV-1 Rev activity [18] . The inhibition by Nullbasic was attributed, in part, to a subcellular redistribution of Rev from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm and cytoplasm, but precisely how Nullbasic mediates this effect is unknown.",

The GFP 2 expression plasmid was obtained from Addgene, plasmid #20738. The construction of the Nullbasic-FLAG and Myc-Rev plasmids have been previously described [18] . The pGCH infectious molecular clone is a HIV proviral plasmid which expresses authentic HIV-1 RNA using the CMV immediate early promoter. The plasmid consists of a pGEM7z (-) (Promega) backbone containing the CMV promoter fused so that the transcription initiation site uses the correct HIV-1+1 position. With respect to the HIV-1 transcription start site, HIV-1 sequences +1 to +933 from the HIV-1 pNL4-3 proviral plasmid (obtained from the ADIS Research and Reference Reagent Program, plasmid #114) were inserted into the pGEM7z (-) via MluI and SphI restriction enzymes sites and +934 to +9251 from the HIV-1 pNL4-3 were inserted into the pGEM7z (-) via SphI and XbaI restriction enzymes sites. The HIV-eGFP expression plasmid was engineered by inserting an eGFP sequence from pcDNA3.1-eGFP into the HIV-1 nef gene in pGCH proviral expression vector through BamHI and XbaI restriction enzyme sites. The expression vector encoding Nullbasic-mCherry was generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of mCherry from pmCherry-LacRep (obtained from Addgene, plasmid #18985), which was then inserted into the Nullbasic-FLAG plasmid via BsrGI and XhoI restriction enzyme sites. The eluates were then separated by sodium dodecylsulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane (Pall) using a semi-dry transfer system (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Tat-FLAG and Nullbasic-FLAG proteins were detected with a rabbit anti-FLAG polyclonal antibody (Cell Signalling Technology).

To investigate whether Nullbasic is able to alter Rev's subcellular localization in the context of HIV-1, we visualized the subcellular distribution of Rev derived from HIV-1 provirus in the presence or absence of Nullbasic. To overcome transcriptional inhibition caused by Nullbasic [18] , we utilized a CMV-driven HIV-1 proviral plasmid, pGCH, which expresses viral factors independent of Tat. The plasmid also has the eGFP gene inserted into the nef reading frame (here called HIV-eGFP) to enable visualization of HIV expression in cells. HIV-eGFP was transfected into HeLa cells with or without FLAG-tagged Nullbasic fused to the mCherry fluorescent reporter protein (Nullbasic-mCherry). We noted strong nuclear accumulation of Nullbasic-mCherry compared to a previous study [18] , whereas one exon Tat proteins with basic domain mutation were also shown to predominantly localized in the cytoplasm [20, 23, 24] . Further comparison of Nullbasic localization in HeLa cells showed that Nullbasic fused to FLAG (Fig. S1 , rows 3 and 5) or mCherry ( Fig. 2A , row 2) had very similar patterns of distribution in the nucleus and cytoplasm. The localization of Rev was determined by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy using an anti-Rev antibody 24 h post-transfection. As expected, Myc epitope-tagged Rev (Myc-Rev) expressed alone was prominent in the nucleolus and the nucleoplasm but to a lesser extent ( Fig. 2A, row 1) . When Rev was expressed by HIV-eGFP, it was distributed throughout the nucleus (Fig. 2B, row 1 ). This nuclear distribution of Rev is consistent with its role in nucleocytoplasmic trafficking of viral mRNA [3, 25] . Coexpression of HIV-eGFP and Nullbasic-mCherry resulted in the distinct redistribution of Rev to the nucleoplasm and cytoplasm (Fig. 2B, row2) , comparable to the subcellular redistribution of Myc-Rev by Nullbasic-mCherry ( Fig. 2A, row2) . Although Nullbasic was shown to inhibit Revmediated viral mRNA transport leading to limited expression of viral proteins from unspliced or singly spliced viral mRNA [18] , these data indicate that Nullbasic-induced redistribution of Rev is independent of other HIV-1 factors under these experimental conditions.",

Immunoprecipitation of wild type Tat-FLAG with anti-FLAG beads did not co-immunoprecipitate Myc-Rev ( Fig. 2C ) but did, as expected, co-immunoprecipitate endogenous CDK9, a member of the pTEF-b protein complex that interacts with the Tat activation domain [29] . Similarly, Nullbasic-FLAG did not show evidence of co-immunoprecipitation of Myc-Rev but did with CDK9 (Fig. 2C ). The latter interaction is most likely similar to the interaction between wild type Tat and CDK9, through the activation domain preserved in Nullbasic-FLAG.

Expression of Nullbasic alone had no apparent effect on CRM1 distribution (Fig. 3, row 4) .

Interestingly, coexpression of Nullbasic-mCherry had no disruptive effect on the nucleolar localization of Myc-RevM10 since, unlike wild type Myc-Rev, no redistribution to the cytoplasm was observed (Fig. 4, row 2) .

Mutant Tat proteins lacking a basic domain, like Nullbasic, have been reported not to interact with B23 in vitro [14] . As previously observed, Myc-Rev colocalized with B23 in nucleolar structures (Fig. 5, row 1) . While expression of Nullbasic-mCherry alone had no apparent effect on B23 nuclear distribution (Fig. 5, row 2) , coexpression of Myc-Rev with Nullbasic-mCherry resulted in the strong redistribution of both Myc-Rev and B23 throughout the nucleus, and the observation of Myc-Rev in the cytoplasm (Fig. 5, row 3) . Since B23 is known to strongly bind to Rev [13] , it is likely that the redistribution of B23 by Nullbasic is Rev-dependent.",

While expression of Nullbasic-mCherry alone had no apparent effect on the nucleolar localization of either protein (Fig. 6 , rows 2 and 5), coexpression of Nullbasic-mCherry with Myc-Rev induced relocalization of C23 but not fibrillarin from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm, in a manner concomitant with the redistribution of Myc-Rev (Fig. 6, rows 3 and 6 , respectively).

In HeLa cells, for example, transportin 1 is the dominant Rev nuclear import pathway [22, 40] , while the importin b pathway is favored in HEK293T cells [40] . To eliminate the possibility that Nullbasic-mediated blockade of a nuclear import pathway leads to the observed cytoplasmic accumulation of Rev, two NLS-containing reporters, GFP 2 -cNLS and GFP 2 -M9core, which mimic cargo for nuclear import by importin b and transportin 1 respectively, were expressed individually or along with Nullbasic-mCherry in HeLa cells. As shown in figure 7 , there was no change in the nuclear accumulation of either reporter in the presence of Nullbasic-mCherry (Fig. 7, rows 2 and 4) compared to in its absence (Fig. 7,  rows 1 and 3) . Nullbasic-mCherry did not affect localization of GFP 2 lacking a nuclear import signal (Fig. 7, rows 5 and 6) . Similar experiments indicated that coexpression of Myc-Rev with Nullbasic-mCherry likewise had no effect on the nuclear localizations of the respective reporters (data not shown). While we cannot exclude interference of other pathways, we conclude that the accumulation of Rev in the cytoplasm induced by Nullbasic is not caused by a general inhibition of the importin b and transportin 1 nuclear import pathways.",

            "text": "This study aimed to elucidate a possible mechanism by which the two-exon anti-viral acting Tat mutant, Nullbasic, perturbs Rev subcellular localization through the active mislocalization of a set of cellular proteins that control Rev trafficking. Nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of Rev is critical for HIV-1 infectivity since viral protein synthesis, and subsequent virion assembly, require the coordinated transport of incompletely spliced viral mRNAs from the nucleus. Nullbasic's action in downregulating Rev's mRNA transport function by mechanisms that include the substantial mislocalization of Rev from nucleolus to nucleoplasm and cytoplasm (see Fig. 2 ) [18] is therefore of great importance. Immunoprecipitation of either Nullbasic-FLAG or Tat-FLAG from lysates of cells coexpressing Myc-Rev revealed no co-immunoprecipitation of Myc-Rev (Fig. 2C) , supporting the idea that Nullbasic does not interact with Rev. Furthermore, fluorescence resonance energy transfer analyses between a Tat-GFP fusion protein and a Rev-BFP fusion failed to detect any interaction in living cells [26, 27] , a result which we reason will likewise apply to Nullbasic and Rev. It is thus reasonable to conclude that Nullbasic interferes with Rev nucleolar localization by an indirect mechanism.",

            "text": "The fact that Nullbasic strongly disrupts the nucleolar localization of Rev in an indirect manner suggests that Nullbasic may interfere with a cellular factor important for Rev nucleolar accumulation. The nucleolus is a complex structure where several thousands of different cellular proteins have been identified [41] . Among these, CRM1 is a Rev binding protein that regulates Rev trafficking throughout the nucleus. CRM1 is a cellular receptor that recognizes and binds to the leucine-rich NES domain of Rev, an interaction which facilitates the egress of Rev/viral mRNA complexes through nuclear pores [3, 4, 42] and is readily visualized in cells as a colocalization in the nucleolus (Fig. 3, row 2 ). Our evidence strongly indicates that CRM1 is a mediator through which Nullbasic induces Rev redistribution, since disrupting the interaction between CRM1 and Rev mitigates the effect of Nullbasic. This was evident through the use of LMB (Fig. 3) , a specific inhibitor of CRM1, and the RevM10 mutant, whose altered NES is no longer recognized or bound by CRM1 (Fig. 4) . In both cases, Rev retained a nucleolar localization despite high levels of Nullbasic expression. As sole expression of Nullbasic does not appear to directly affect CRM1 localization (Fig. 3 , row 1 compared to row 4), the precise mechanism by which CRM1 mediates Nullbasic-induced redistribution remains to be elucidated.",

While primarily located in the nucleolus, B23 can display a nucleocytoplasmic distribution as a consequence of its shuttling function [46] . Nullbasic-mediated redistribution of Rev in this study was accompanied by the mislocalizations of B23 (Fig. 5) and C23 (Fig. 6 ), but not fibrillarin (Fig. 6) . It is likely that the mislocalization of B23 in the presence of redistributed Rev is a consequence of their strong interaction [13] rather than through an interaction between Nullbasic and B23 because, while Tat has been reported to interact with B23 through its basic domain [44] , the same domain in not present in Nullbasic [18] . Due to the lack of evidence of a direct interaction between C23 and Rev, the mislocalization of C23 may be a result of its interaction with mislocalized B23 [45] . The observed mislocalizations, however, were largely confined to the nucleoplasm even when Rev was substantially redistributed into the cytoplasm.",
