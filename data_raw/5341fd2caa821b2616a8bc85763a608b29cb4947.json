Since 2012, 2,040 cases and 712 deaths have been recorded (as of August 11, 2017), representing a strikingly high case fatality rate of 36%. Over the last several years, MERS-CoV research has progressed in several parallel and complementary directions. This review will focus on three particular areas: the origins and evolution of MERS-CoV, the challenges and achievements in the development of MERS-CoV animal models, and our understanding of how novel proteins unique to MERS-CoV counter the host immune response. The origins of MERS-CoV, likely in African bats, are increasingly clear, although important questions remain about the establishment of dromedary camels as a reservoir seeding human outbreaks. Likewise, there have been important advances in the development of animal models, and both non-human primate and mouse models that seem to recapitulate human disease are now available. How MERS-CoV evades and inhibits the host innate immune response remains less clear. Although several studies have identified MERS-CoV proteins as innate immune antagonists, little of this work has been conducted using live virus under conditions of actual infection, but rather with ectopically expressed proteins. Accordingly, considerable space remains for major contributions to understanding unique ways in which MERS-CoV interacts with and modulates the host response. Collectively, these areas have seen significant advances over the last several years but continue to offer exciting opportunities for discovery.",

Large-scale serosurveys suggest rare but widespread subclinical infection 5 , but it is unknown whether asymptomatically infected individuals can transmit the virus. Notably, seropositive rates among dromedary camels exceeding 90% have been detected in several sub-Saharan African countries in addition to the Middle East, but not a single active MERS-CoV infection has been identified in sub-Saharan Africa. In 2016, sampling of more than 1,000 individuals in Kenya identified two seropositive individuals 6 , although most of the individuals tested, including the two who tested positive, had little contact with camels. It is unclear whether the absence of cases reported in Africa is due to under-reporting or different ecology of the virus, but further, intensified sampling may fill these gaps.",

Almost immediately, suspicion fell on bats as a likely reservoir. MERS-CoV was classified genomically as a lineage C betacoronavirus, a relatively novel lineage typified by the bat coronaviruses HKU4 and HKU5, complete sequences of which had been recovered from bats of the species Tylonycteris pachypus and Pipistrellus abramus in China, respectively, in 2007 7 . Extensive global surveys since the discovery of MERS-CoV have revealed a remarkably wide distribution of lineage C betacoronaviruses in bats, and lineage C betacoronaviruses have since been identified in bats in Italy 8,9 , Mexico 10,11 , and Thailand 12 . Most recently, a 2017 global study by Anthony et al. 13 found that 91 of the 100 phylogenetic coronavirus lineages identified in diverse mammalian orders were found in bats, suggesting that bats are a source of not only lineage C betacoronaviruses but possibly the vast majority of global coronavirus diversity.",

Analysis of the complete genome sequence of this virus (NeoCoV) by Corman et al. 17 revealed that it shares 85% nt identity with MERS-CoV across the entire genome and more than 90% amino acid identity, placing the two viruses within the same species. Most recently, a second virus (PREDICT/PDF-2180) in this species was described by Anthony et al. 18 , further supporting the idea that MERS-CoV is descended from an ancestral virus of African bats. Despite the close similarity and conspecific classification of NeoCoV and PREDICT/PDF-2180 with MERS-CoV, the two bat viruses are highly divergent from MERS-CoV in the S1 subunit of the Spike glycoprotein (less than 45% nt amino acid identity), but highly similar to each other (91%), with evidence of recombination between the S1 and S2 subunits, and PREDICT/PDF-2180 was unable to infect human cells. This is consistent with the idea that MERS-CoV has a common ancestor with these viruses but itself arose through the acquisition of a new Spike S1 subunit conferring the ability to infect human cells through its receptor, DPP4 18 .",

Serological evidence of MERS-CoV infection in dromedary camels dates back to at least 1983. In 2014, M\u00fcller et al. 25 reported 81% seropositivity for MERS-CoV in banked dromedary serum samples obtained between 1983 and 1997 in Somalia, Sudan, and Egypt, the first two countries being major exporters of dromedary camels to the Arabian Peninsula. This supports extensive circulation of MERS-CoV in dromedary camels long predating known human cases. Corman et al. 26 reported similarly high seropositive rates in Kenyan camel serum banked in 1992, and contemporary serum collection shows that high percentages of dromedary camels are also seropositive for MERS-CoV in Nigeria, Tunisia, and Ethiopia 27 as well as Burkina Faso and Morocco 28 . Phylogenetic analysis of MERS-CoV sequences suggests an evolutionary history of MERS-CoV in camels. Sabir et al. 29 isolated complete MERS-CoV sequences representing five genetic lineages from Saudi Arabian camels. These lineages, including one recombinant lineage that spawned a human outbreak, appeared ancestral to human isolates.",

The first of these, described in 2015 by Pascal et al. 46 and further detailed in 2017 by Coleman et al. 47 , uses mice with the full-length mouse Dpp4 gene replaced by its human equivalent. hDPP4 tissue distribution and expression levels in this system were largely equivalent to that of mDPP4 in wild-type mice. These mice support robust MERS-CoV replication in the lungs with little or no dissemination of the virus to other organs. All mice infected with the highest dose tested-2.5 \u00d7 10 4 plaque-forming units (pfu)-developed severe lung pathology, lost 20% of body weight by day 7 post-infection, and were euthanized. Notably, and unlike in models described below, these mice succumb to infection with wild-type, rather than mouse-adapted, MERS-CoV. This may make it particularly useful for extension of in vitro studies of mutations found in clinical isolates such as a 48-nt deletion in ORF4a 48 or of mutations engineered into other viral proteins intended to disrupt their interactions with host immune responses.",

Cockrell et al. 40 made two amino acid substitutions in mDPP4 previously determined to enable its usage by MERS-CoV 39 , at positions 288 and 330. These mice support robust replication in the lungs following intranasal inoculation with 5 \u00d7 10 5 pfu of wild-type MERS-CoV or MERS-CoV adapted on mouse NIH-3T3 cells expressing the chimeric mDPP4 with substitutions of amino acids 288 and 330. However, these mice exhibited no clinical signs of disease and minimal lung pathology. Despite the robust replication, 15 serial passages of virus were required to achieve lethality, significant declines in respiratory function, and severe lung pathology. The mouse-adapted virus contained several mutations, as expected, as well as a large deletion in ORF4b. This deletion may suggest that this protein is non-essential in the mouse, or its loss may represent an adaptation to virulence possibly because loss of this putative interferon (IFN) antagonist results in enhanced immune-mediated pathology. Li et al. 49 developed a similar model in which they replaced exons 10-12 of mouse Dpp4 with their human equivalents, rendering mDPP4 a functional receptor for MERS-CoV. As with the model developed by Cockrell et al., wild-type MERS-CoV replicated robustly in the lungs of these mice but did not cause disease. Virus serially passaged 31 times was lethal to 80% of mice infected with 2 \u00d7 10 6 pfu. Notably, and supporting the emerging picture of immune-mediated pathology playing a significant role in disease, mouse-adapted MERS-CoV used in this model induced significantly more robust activation of innate immune and inflammatory genes than wild-type MERS-CoV and increased infiltration of the airway by innate immune cells.",

Conserved MERS-CoV proteins such as nsp1 55 , the nsp3 papain-like protease domain 56,57 , and the structural M protein 58,59 may also counteract the host immune response but likely do so by similar mechanisms as their closely related orthologs in other coronaviruses. The lineage-specific accessory proteins, in contrast, lack homology to known viral or host proteins, making them of particular interest as their mechanisms of action may be unique among coronaviruses. Notably, NS4a and NS4b have been demonstrated by multiple groups to have IFN antagonism capabilities, and NS5 may as well 58 . However, few of these studies have investigated the role of these proteins during infection.

NS4a antagonism of IFN gene expression has been demonstrated by three research groups using very similar luciferase reporter assays 58,60,61 but, like M, not during actual virus infection. Notably, Niemeyer et al. 61 showed that NS4a binds the dsRNA mimic polyI:C and co-localizes with dsRNA during MERS-CoV infection, whereas Siu et al. 60 demonstrated that IFN antagonism is dependent on dsRNA binding. More recently, in 2016, Rabouw et al. 53 reported that ectopically expressed NS4a inhibits activation of the antiviral dsRNA binding protein PKR, preventing translation arrest and stress granule formation. However, infection with recombinant MERS-CoV\u2206ORF4 did not induce stress granule formation, and whether this virus activated PKR was not reported, leaving open the question of whether NS4a functions as a PKR antagonist during MERS-CoV infection.",

Notably, Matthews et al. found that, although NS4b localizes primarily to the nucleus, deletion of the N-terminal nuclear localization sequence did not abrogate NS4b inhibition of IFN\u03b2 promoter-driven luciferase expression, a result confirmed by Yang et al. 63 in 2015. In that 2015 study, Yang et al. expanded on their earlier work, showing that ectopically expressed NS4b inhibited IFN\u03b2 promoter-driven luciferase expression as a consequence of overexpression of the IFN activators MDA5, RIG-I, MAVS, IKK\u03b5, TBK1, IRF3, and IRF7. MDA5 and RIG-I are cellular sensors of viral dsRNA, whereas MAVS transduces their recognition of dsRNA through the kinases IKK\u03b5 and TBK1 to phosphorylate IRF3/7 and induce IFN. They demonstrate that NS4b associates with several of these antiviral proteins, preventing the formation of an IKK\u03b5/MAVS complex required to induce IFN, yet the authors identify, but do not characterize, an IFN antagonist function mediated specifically in the nucleus. Finally, in 2016 64 , we identified NS4b as a 2\u2032,5\u2032 phosphodiesterase (PDE) with structural homology to the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) NS2 protein as well as a larger host protein family known as 2H-phosphoesterases. We previously characterized MHV NS2 as an RNase L antagonist 65 and showed that NS4b can functionally replace MHV NS2. Additionally, we used recombinant live MERS-CoV to demonstrate that a mutation in an NS4b catalytic residue (H182R) that abrogates its enzymatic activity results in RNase L activation in Calu-3 cells late during infection.",

Notably, the latter two models required mouse adaptation of the virus and still require 10-to 100-fold more virus to achieve severe disease. It is possible that full replacement of mDPP4 disrupts its non-MERS-CoV-related functions, including T-cell homeostasis, that could affect the course of disease, and the use of different MERS-CoV strains may also affect outcome. A side-by-side comparison of these models will help in elucidating and reconciling these differences. With respect to pathogenesis, all three models appear to recapitulate the pneumonia observed in humans, but the model using wild-type virus may offer certain advantages. Particularly, it will better allow studies of naturally occurring and engineered mutations in viral proteins, on the genetic background of human isolates, particularly the accessory proteins in the 3\u2032 end of the genome. Several of these proteins have been identified in vitro as putative innate immune antagonists, and the potential to extend these studies to characterizing the role of these proteins in pathogenesis offers exciting opportunities for the field.",

None of the MERS-CoV accessory proteins shares significant amino acid identity or similarity with known coronavirus proteins, suggesting that their interactions with the host may be unique to the lineage C betacoronaviruses. In contrast, replicase and structural genes that interfere with the immune response do remain of interest but, owing to their conservation among coronaviruses, are less likely to act in unique or newly recognized ways. Although NS4a, NS4b, and NS5 have been reported to interfere with the innate immune response, most of this work, including that related to IFN induction, has been done using ectopically expressed protein and reporter assays. Exclusive use of ectopically expressed protein raises concerns about whether results may be skewed by non-physiological expression levels, mislocalization, or loss of possible interactions with other viral proteins.
