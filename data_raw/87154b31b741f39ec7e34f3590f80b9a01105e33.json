The mean OABSS and mean age for females was 4.41\u00b13.10 and 73.74\u00b16.03years, respectively. Daily average temperature and daily temperature difference ranged from-3.4-28.3 o C and 2.2-16.9 o C, respectively. Age was a significantly risk factor for IPSS, OABSS, and QoL (P<0.001, <0.001, and 0.005, respectively). After multiple regression analysis, daily average temperatures did not show a statistically significant change in IPSS and OABSS. Only daily temperature differences were associated with male LUTS. Conclusions: While LUTS could be worsened in low temperatures generally, IPSS and OABSS were not affected by daily average temperature conditions. Daily temperature differences may be more influential than daily average temperatures.",

However, seasonal changes were not observed in the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), storage symptom score, voiding symptom score, and quality of life (QoL) (5, 6) . As well, changes in fluid temperature did not significantly change the threshold volume of bladder sensation or increase the incidence of idiopathic detrusor overactivity in urodynamic studies (7) . There is no general consensus about the effect of environmental temperature on LUTS associated with BPH and overactive bladder (OAB). Therefore, we focused on ambient temperature as an environmental factor affecting LUTS associated with BPH or OAB, and attempted to explain the temperature difference changes in BPH or OAB severity.",

Concerning urinary storage symptoms, patients without neurological diseases have a heightened perception of cold in the bladder during the ice water test than patients with neurological diseases (15) . Storage symptoms, frequency, urgency, and nocturia are considerably affected by seasonal changes (16) .

            "text": "There are several reasons for the varying results. First, several previous studies reported that cold stress induces detrusor overactivity in conscious rats, a finding that occurred with a high temperature change between the treatment group and the control group (\u25b324 o C=room temperature 28oC-low temperature 4\u00baC) (15, 17, 18) . However, in the present study, the maximum daily temperature difference was 16.9 o C, which was lower than in previous studies. Also, in general, elderly people have shorter exposure times and well-controlled body temperatures in the winter season due to their typically limited physical activity, which could lead to a smaller exposure to extreme temperature changes. Second, the same previous studies measured outcomes during a short exposure time (20-40 min) (15, (17) (18) (19) . However, in general, the human body's activity changes with the seasons and gradually adapts to the exposure temperature throughout the season. This phenomenon may account for our finding that the temperature effect on the risk of BPH/ OAB may not affect urinary symptoms in the general population. For instance, in a cold stress-induced detrusor overactivity model, when skin temperature stabilized after 20 min of low temperature (4\u00b12\u00baC) exposure and was maintained for the duration of exposure (19) , demonstrated that a momentary cold stimulus can act as a trigger for the urinary responses. Also, the results of this model were associated with a sudden decrease in skin temperature (19) . This present study also supports previous results that the time-dependent reductions of low temperature stimulated responses represent an adaptive response that is universal in normal healthy humans. Moreover, individual efforts to maintain warmth through the wearing of heavy clothes and heating the environment could diminish the trigger effect of low temperature on LUTS. It has generally been thought that more LUTS patients are associated with BPH/OAB-rela-ted need for hospital examination with regard to their urinary symptoms in low temperature circumstances. However, the present results indicate that this does not mean that the urinary severity of patients in low temperature environments is higher than high temperature exposure.",

            "text": "The guideline by the Japanese Urological Association recommends one of the conservative treatments that males with LUTS avoid exposing the lower body to cold temperature (20) . However, the American Urological Association and European Association of Urology have not provided high-quality and reliable evidence about the influence of ambient temperature on LUTS (21, 22) . Only the American Urological Association guideline on the management of BPH recommended future study of life style interventions (21) . The present data address this recommendation. There are several limitations to this study. In view of the imprecision of some geographical data, coupled with the fact that we used spatially-derived ambient temperature as a surrogate for personal temperature, the risk estimates presented here are clearly misclassified. Thus, our results may underestimate the true risk of LUTS associated with exposure to temperature in this population. However, as in most epidemiological surveys, there will be some errors in exposure classification. In this study, which was performed as a large-scale research project that covered seven major areas of South Korea, the collected data were judged to be sufficiently homogeneous. As a result, the misclassification of this study would most likely be non-differential with regard to temperature status. This would tend to bias the regression parameter toward null. Second, this study does not include the detailed biological data of each population, which means we could not determine clinical BPH or OAB. This is mainly due to the nature of this cross-sectional survey.",
