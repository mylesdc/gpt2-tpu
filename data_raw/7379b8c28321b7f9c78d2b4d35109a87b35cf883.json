            "text": "Coronavirus M protein is an essential component of virion and plays pivotal roles in virion assembly, budding and maturation. The M protein is integrated into the viral envelope with three transmembrane domains flanked by a short amino-terminal ectodomain and a large carboxy-terminal endodomain. In this study, we showed co-purification of the M protein from coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) with actin. To understand the cellular factors that may be involved in virion assembly, budding and maturation processes, IBV M was used as the bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen, resulting in the identification of b-actin as a potentially interacting partner. This interaction was subsequently confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence microscopy in mammalian cells, and mutation of amino acids A159 and K160 on the M protein abolished the interaction. Introduction of the A159-K160 mutation into an infectious IBV clone system blocks the infectivity of the clone, although viral RNA replication and subgenomic mRNA transcription were actively detected. Disruption of actin filaments with cell-permeable agent cytochalasin D at early stages of the infection cycle led to the detection of viral protein synthesis in infected cells but not release of virus particles to the cultured media. However, the same treatment at late stages of the infection cycle did not affect the release of virus particles to the media, suggesting that disruption of the actin filaments might block virion assembly and budding, but not release of the virus particles. This study reveals an essential function of actin in the replication cycle of coronavirus. Citation: Wang J, Fang S, Xiao H, Chen B, Tam JP, et al.

In this process, viral envelope proteins gather at a special membranous structure and cooperate with other viral components to induce budding [1] . For example, some viruses including human immunodeficiency virus bud from the plasma membrane and release the virion from host cells by pinching-off. Others are budding at intracellular membranes [2, 3] . In this way, virions are wrapped within intracellular membrane-bound compartments, such as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus, and the newly budded viruses exit the cell by using the cellular secretory pathway [2] . However, the detailed mechanisms of viral assembly and budding, especially the host factors that are involved in these processes, are yet to be revealed for many viruses. In this study, we report that interaction between coronavirus membrane protein (M) and actin with functional implication in facilitating virion assembly and budding.",

The avian coronavirus Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) belongs to the third group of coronaviruses genus. Like many other coronavriuses, IBV virion is built from four structural proteins, including the nucleocapsid (N) protein with which the genomic RNA is packed, the spike (S) protein that forms the prominent coronavirus spikes, the M protein which is the most abundant component of coronavirus, and the envelope (E) protein which is a minor but yet critical component in virion assembly [4] .

The M protein is a type III membrane protein and a key player in coronavirus assembly. It spans the membrane bilayer three times, leaving a short amino-terminal domain on the virion exterior surface (or exposed luminally in intracellular membranes) and a large carboxy-terminal tail in the virion interior (or in the plasma) [6] . Lateral interactions between M proteins are thought to mediate the formation of the virion envelope [7] . When expressed alone, M protein accumulates in the Golgi complex in the form of homomultimeric complexes [8, 9] . However, in combination with the E protein, M is retained in the budding compartment and incorporated into virus-like particles (VLPs) with similarity in size and shape to authentic virions, demonstrating that the M and E proteins are the minimal requirements for envelope formation for most coronaviruses, [10] . The M protein appears to interact with S and HE proteins, and the S-M-HE protein complexes can be detected in cells infected with the bovine coronavirus [6] . The M protein was also shown to interact with the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) nucleocapsid consisting of the genomic-size mRNA 1 and N protein in a pre-Golgi compartment, probably at the ER membrane. It may interact directly with the genomic RNA through the packaging signal, initiating the M-nucleocapsid interaction [11] . There is also a detectably direct interaction between M and N proteins in the nucleocapsid, which may further stabilize the M-genomic RNA interaction [11] .",

However, as no suitable antibodies against actin were readily available at the time, the identity of this protein was not established. This issue was revisited in this study. Confluent monolayers of Vero cells were infected with IBV at a multiplicity of infection of approximately 2 PFU/cell. The supernatants were collected at 18 hours post-infection and centrifuged at 4,000 rpm for 20 minutes to remove cell debris. The virus particles were spun down by ultracentrifugation through a 2 ml sucrose cushion (20%), and purified using a 10-50% sucrose gradient. Following ultracentrifugation, 11 fractions were collected from top to bottom, and the presence of viral proteins was checked by Western blot with anti-N antibodies, showing that the IBV N protein was detected in fractions 7-11 with majority of the protein located in fractions 8-10 ( Fig. 1, top panel) . Analysis of the same fractions by Western blot with anti-actin antibodies showed that actin appeared in the same fractions as N protein, with the majority of the protein detected in fractions 8-10 ( Fig. 1 , middle panel). Fractionation of total lysates from cells without IBV infection under the same conditions showed that actin was mainly detected in fractions 3-4 ( Fig. 1, bottom panel) . These results demonstrate that actin could indeed be co-purified with the virus particles. However, it is currently uncertain if actin could be incorporated into the virions.",

First, the A159-K160 deletion and mutation were introduced into a full-length IBV infectious clone, and the effect of this minimal deletion and mutation on the replication of viral RNA and the recovery of infectious IBV was analyzed. Introduction of full-length transcripts derived from wild type (wt), the A159-K160 deletion construct (MD5) and A159-P/K160-E mutation construct (Mm1) into Vero cells by electroporation showed efficient recovery of infectious IBV from cells transfected with wild type transcripts. However, it was consistently observed that no infectious virus could be recovered from cells transfected with either MD5 or Mm1 transcripts.",

However, with the help of E protein, VLPs may be formed at the IC membranes. As coronaviruses do not contain a matrix protein that underlines the membrane, the M protein may serve as a matrixlike protein. It is proposed that the formation of coronavirus envelope is dominated by lateral interaction between M molecules that form a two-dimensional lattice in intracellular membranes [20] . The M-M interaction is essential but not sufficient for coronavirus envelope assembly. Free energy is needed to generate and stabilize membrane curvature, suggesting that interaction of M protein with host proteins would be a must [21] . To support this speculation, the results present in this study demonstrate that interaction of the IBV M protein with b-actin is essential for virion assembly and budding. The interacting region in the M protein was pinpointed by deletion and mutation studies. As MD3 is able to interact with actin, but MD1 and MD2 could not, it was reasoned that the domain responsible for this interaction may be located in the region covering amino acids 159-160. This region was chosen for further deletion and mutational analysis, confirming that it is indeed involved in the interaction with actin. However, the two amino acids are not conserved in other coronavirus M proteins. At present, we do not know whether interaction between coronavirus M protein and actin is a general phenomenon for all coronaviruses, or is just IBV-specific.",

            "text": "Available evidence suggests that the host cytoskeleton, especially actin, is involved in the budding process of several animal viruses [22] . Actin has been identified in many enveloped viruses, such as Rous sarcoma virus, mouse mammary tumor virus, Sendai virus and measles virus. In the case of measles virus, actin was originally thought as a cellular contaminant, but was later demonstrated to be an internal component of the virus [23] [24] [25] . Actin was found in the purified paramyxovirus particles and actin filaments were seen in association with the budding virions by electron microscopy [24] [25] [26] . Polymerized actin was also found in HIV preparations [27, 28] . The functional implication for the incorporation of actin into these virus particles remains unclear. One possibility is that actin polymerization serves as an additional force for membrane bending during budding [1, 29] . As an illustrative example, actin was shown to control the movement of measles virus envelope proteins on the surface of infected cells [30] . Interaction of actin with viral components was also reported in several other viral systems. One example is the interaction of the nuclocapsids of murine mammary tumor virus with actin, which was required for extruding the virus particles from virus-infected cells [31] . The M protein of Newcastle disease virus could interact with actin in vitro [1, 32] . The SARS-CoV N protein could aggregate elongation factor 1a through direct interaction, leading to the inhibition of protein translation and cytokinesis by blocking F-actin bundling [33] . It was also reported that the SARS-CoV N protein could induce apoptosis and actin reorganization in mammalian cells under stress conditions [34] . The results shown in this study demonstrate that actin could be co-purified with IBV virions and that the IBV M protein is associated with actin, suggesting that actin is likely to be incorporated into IBV virions through its interaction with the M protein. However, more conclusive data, such as immunogold labeling of highly purified virions, are currently lacking. It is interesting that IBV replication cycle was disturbed in cells treated with cytochalasin D. Cytochalsin D could prevent actin from polymerization, leading to malfunction of actin. When actin was disrupted, much less IBV virions were released from the cells into the culture medium, demonstrating that actin plays a very important role in the IBV replication cycle. Two possible mechanisms were considered. First, actin may be involved in the formation of the M lattice that may promote and stabilize its curving, resulting in the enhancement of some late processes, such as virion budding and release. Second, the MHV M protein was shown to be recycled from the Golgi complex back to early compartments, such as the ER and IC, which are functionally important in coronavirus infected cells [21] . Therefore, interaction of actin with M protein may help the retrograde transport of M protein from Golgi apparatus to some early compartments and provide more M protein for virion assembly and budding.",

Firstly, the monomers of M could interact with each other particularly via the transmembrane domains [21] . Besides, the M-N interaction region was narrowed to the 16 residues adjacent to the carboxy terminus of TGEV M protein [40] . However, the specific amino acids on M protein responsible for M-S and M-E interactions are still enigmatic. In the present study, deletion or mutation of amino acids A159 and K160, which are essential for the interaction of M protein with actin, is detrimental to the recovery of IBV from an infectious IBV clone due to a defect in late stages of the IBV replication cycle. Although, the deletion or mutation of amino acids A159 and K160 could also interact with another structural protein E, we cannot exclude the possibility that this region is essential for maintaining the integrity of the M protein and involved in the interactions with other viral components. Nevertheless, it lends support to the conclusion that interaction of the IBV M protein with actin is essential for the completion of the IBV infection cycle.",

Similar amount of viral proteins were detected in the total cell lysates but were not detected in supernatants when cytochalasin D was added early in the viral replication cycle suggests that actin filaments are essential for some early events, such as virion assembly and budding, during the assembly and maturation processes of IBV. As IBV proteins can be efficiently detected in the supernatants when cytochalasin D was added at 12 and 16 hours post-infection, respectively, it suggests that actin filaments are unlikely involved in the release of the IBV particles. Instead, our data support that actin filaments may be involved in the virion assembly and budding process of the coronavirus replication cycles. As coronavirus M protein could bind to the viral genomic RNA through packaging signal [41] and RNA replication in the cytoplasm would rely on the support of actin [42] , the interaction of M protein with actin may serve as a platform to promote the binding of M protein to viral RNA as well as viral RNA replication. Alternatively, coronavirus M protein could bind to the N protein-RNA complex to stabilize the nucleocapsid [11] and extra energy would be needed in this process [21] . The interaction of M protein with actin may serve as a power station to provide energy for completion of the viral replication cycle.",
