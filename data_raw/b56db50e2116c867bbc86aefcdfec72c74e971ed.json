[7] [8] [9] It has since been shown that both small and large particles can exist at short distances from the patient, and that aerosolised transmission can occur at close proximity. 9 In our two published RCTs conducted in China, 3,4 we used the same outcomes, case definitions and measurement tools, and used the same testing methods for a range of different pathogens transmitted by different routes. This afforded an opportunity to pool the data from both trials for improved statistical power to examine the outcomes by pathogens and mode of transmission. The aim of this pooled analysis was to examine the efficacy of medical masks and respirators in HCWs against respiratory infection.",

These hospitals were purposefully selected as they indicated low levels of routine mask/respirator use during a pretrial assessment. Participants in the control arms continued their usual mask wearing practices and were followed using the same protocol as applied to the other arms. 3 The second trial (Trial 2) was conducted from 28 December 2009 to 7 February 2010, using the same design. 4 In Trial 2, participants were randomised to three arms: medical masks at all times on shift (n = 572), continuous N95 respirators at all times on shift (n = 516) and targeted/intermittent use of N95 respirators only while doing high-risk procedures or barrier nursing of a patient with known respiratory illness (n = 521). Fit testing was not performed in the second RCT. In both trials, participants were followed for 4 weeks of wearing the medical masks or respirators, and an extra week of non-wearing of masks for the development of symptoms. Demographic and clinical data were collected, including gender, age, smoking, vaccination status, pre-existing medical illnesses, hand hygiene and high-risk procedures. Pharyngeal swabs were collected from symptomatic participants, and samples were tested at the laboratories of the Beijing Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There was no major difference in the products used in both clinical trials. In the first trial, we used medical masks (3M, catalogue number 1820) and N95 fit/ non-fit-tested respirator (3M, catalogue number 9132). The following products were used in the second trial: medical masks (3M, catalogue number 1817) and respirator (3M, catalogue number 1860).",

Respirators are designed to provide respiratory protection through filtration and fit, and properly fitted respirators provide better protection compared to medical masks. 3, 4 We could not demonstrate efficacy of medical masks against any outcome, but the non-significant trend appeared to be towards protection. Medical masks may well have efficacy, 5 but if so, the degree of efficacy was too small to detect in this study, and larger studies are needed, given the widespread use of these devices in health care. a diagnosis of influenza requires the detection of virus from respiratory specimens, or a fourfold rise in serological titres, both of which are highly resource-intensive and depend on daily subject follow-up and on optimal timing of specimen collection. For all these reasons, the published studies to date have been unable to determine whether there is a difference in efficacy against influenza infection between medical masks and N95 respirators. This study can therefore usefully inform policies for prevention of influenza.",

Generally, medical masks are considered sufficient for droplet-transmitted infections such as influenza. 18 However, this study has demonstrated a clear benefit of using N95 respirators (both continuous and targeted) to protect HCWs against droplet infections and does not show significant protection of medical masks. In the light of these findings, it may be prudent to use respirators when the transmission mode of a disease is unknown or when HCWs exposed to droplet-transmitted infections with a high-case fatality rate. 6 This study has some limitations. Firstly, the reporting of the results included in Figure 1 is different from the IPD meta-analysis results. This is due to the uneven distribution of randomisation arms and differing seasonal attack rates between the trials. In Figure 1 , these between-trial differences were not taken into account. The IPD meta-analysis takes into account of these and gives an unbiased association. Secondly, the control arm in trial 1 was not randomised; however, the risk of bias is less due to similar study setting, outcome measures and participant characteristics. Moreover, whether infection was acquired in the community or the hospital cannot be determined, but the RCT design should result in community exposure being distributed equally across all arms. Finally, we categorised pathogens according to various transmission modes, while certain viruses are transmitted via multiple routes. The pooled data were suggestive of an effect of respirators against influenza, but probably did not have enough statistical power for this outcome. The major strength of this study is the use of the same endpoints, measurements and methods in the two trials, which allowed valid pooling of the data.",

The data collected during two similar clinical trials conducted in Beijing, China, which examined the same infection outcomes, were pooled 2. We showed that respirators provide superior protection against droplet-transmitted infections, for which most guidelines recommend masks. These findings challenge the paradigm of infection transmission being simplified to droplet, airborne or contact.",
