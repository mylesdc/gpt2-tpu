Together with amphisome formation, EV71 induced an autophagic flux, which could be blocked by NH 4 Cl (inhibitor of acidification) and vinblastine (inhibitor of fusion), as demonstrated by Western blotting. Suckling mice intracranially inoculated with EV71 showed EV71 VP1 protein expression (representing EV71 infection) in the cerebellum, medulla, and pons by immunohistochemical staining. Accompanied with these infected brain tissues, increased expression of LC3-II protein as well as formation of LC3 aggregates, autophagosomes and amphisomes were detected. Amphisome formation, which was confirmed by colocalization of EV71-VP1 protein or LC3 puncta and the endosome marker protein MPR. Thus, EV71-infected suckling mice (similar to EV71-infected SK-N-SH cells) also show an autophagic flux. The physiopathological parameters of EV71-MP4 infected mice, including body weight loss, disease symptoms, and mortality were increased compared to those of the uninfected mice. We further blocked EV71-induced autophagy with the inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA), which attenuated the disease symptoms and decreased the viral load in the brain tissues of the infected mice. Conclusions: In this study, we reveal that EV71 infection of suckling mice induces an amphisome formation accompanied with the autophagic flux in the brain tissues. Autophagy induced by EV71 promotes viral replication and EV71-related pathogenesis.",

During autophagic progression, the phagophore is initiated followed by nucleation and elongation, leading to the formation of a double-membrane vesicle, which is designated an autophagosome. After recruitment of aggregated proteins and damaged organelles, the autophagosome then fuses with the lysosome to form the autolysosome. Alternatively, the autophagosome may fuse with the endosome to form a vesicle known as an amphisome [22, 23] . Finally, the sequestered proteins or organelles are digested by proteases for recycling [21, 24] . This process prevents cell death under conditions of nutrient deprivation, growth factor depletion, and other stresses.",

Furthermore, certain viruses, such as HSV-1, Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, and murine \u03b3-herpesvirus 68, have evolved mechanisms to evade the host autophagic response [26] [27] [28] . In contrast, other viruses, such as poliovirus, rhinovirus, coronavirus, Epstein-Barr virus, dengue virus, hepatitis C virus, HIV, coxsackievirus B3, and EV71, induce autophagic activity [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] . Virus-mediated autophagy may enhance viral replication or evade immune surveillance [37] . We previously reported that EV71 infection can induce autophagic machinery to enhance viral replication in vitro [36] . Wang et al. developed a mouse model which mimics the natural route of EV71 infection in humans. Mice can be infected orally by mouse-adapted EV71 (MP4 strain), which infects CNS neurons [16] . Using Wang et al.'s adapted virus (EV71 MP4) and the mouse model, we further demonstrated that this virus can induce autophagy in the brain tissues of the infected mice [36] . We also reported that dengue virus (DV) serotype-2 infection of suckling mice induces autophagy, which plays a promoting role in DV replication and pathogenesis [38] . However, these previous reports did not clarify whether EV71 infection can induce an autophagic flux and did not show the effects of EV71induced autophagy on physiopathological responses and viral titers in the infected mice. Therefore, in the present study, the same mouse model was utilized to clarify the pathological effects of induced autophagy in vivo during EV71 infection.",

We also determined whether amphisome and autophagic flux are induced in EV71-infected cells. Our data showed that in EV71-infected cells, LC3 puncta (Green, a marker of autophagosome) abundantly colocalized with the EV71 structural protein VP1 and nonstructural protein 2C under confocal microscopy ( Figure 1A , arrow), suggesting that the EV71 VP1 and 2C proteins are distributed around autophagosomes. We further revealed that the EV71 VP1 and 2C proteins colocalized with the MPR protein (Mannose-6-phosphate receptor, a marker of late endosome) ( Figure 1B , arrow), which parallel with the increased colocalization of the LC3 and MPR proteins in EV71-infected cells ( Figure 1C , arrow). At the same time, we also detected colocalization of LC3 and LAMP1 (lysosome marker) in EV71-infected cells, indicating that EV71 infection induces autolysosome formation ( Figure 1C , arrow). Our data reveal that the endosome with EV71 fuses with the autophagosome to form the amphisome, which is consistent with the results of a study by Khakpoor et al. on DV infection [23] . In summary, EV71 infection can induce autophagosome, amphisome and autolysome formation, and the structural protein VP1 and nonstructural protein 2C of EV71 were distributed around the autophagosome and amphisome.",

Our data showed that the LC3-II expression level was gradually increased and reached the peak at 9 hr post-infection (p.i.). The expression of LC3-II was then decreased after 12 hr p.i. (Figure 2 , lane 5 and lane 8), indicating the progression of autophagy. To further confirm that EV71 can induce autophagic flux, the degradation of LC3-II expression was blocked by NH 4 Cl, which exerts its effect by neutralizing the acidic pH and blocking lysozyme degradation. Our data showed that in the presence of NH 4 Cl at 6 hr, 9 hr, and 12 hr p.i., the expression level of LC3-II was increased as compared to the levels in the EV71-infected group without NH 4 Cl treatment and the mock control groups ( Figure 2 , lane 3, lane 6, and lane 9). Autophagic flux was further confirmed using treatment with vinblastine, a microtubule depolymerizing agent that causes the accumulation of autophagic vacuoles by preventing their degradation (Additional file 1). The above data indicate that EV71 infection can induce an autophagic flux which can be blocked by autophagy blockers NH 4 Cl and vinblastine. Altogether, EV71 infection can induce an autophagic flux including autophagosome, amphisome and autolysome formation. The structural protein VP1 and nonstructural protein 2C of EV71 were distributed around the autophagosome and amphisome. However, the roles of these viral proteins in autophagy progression remain to be determined.",

Moreover, the clinical scores were significantly increased from day 3 in EV71-infected mice ( Figure 3B, middle panel) .

            "text": "The formation of autophagosome-like vesicles in the neurons of infected mice indicates that EV71 infection induces autophagy in vivo [36] . To further confirm that EV71 infection indeed induces the formation of autophagosome and amphisome as well as autophagic flux in mice, sections of brain tissues of the infected mice were collected and the ultrastructure of the vesicles in the infected brain tissues were investigated by immunofluorescence staining under confocal microscopy. The results showed that LC3 puncta, which represent autophagosomes, were colocalized with EV71 VP1 protein in the brain tissues of EV71-infected mice at 24 hr p.i., suggesting that EV71 infection can induce autophagosome formation (Additional file 3 and Figure 4A lower panel). This finding is consistent with the results of our previous TEM investigation that showed VP1 protein colocalized with autophagosome-like vesicles [36] . Moreover, EV71 infection-induced LC3 puncta were also colocalized with MPR protein (representing endosome) ( Figure 4A upper panels, arrow), indicating that endosome may fuse with the autophagosome to form amphisome in vivo during EV71 infection, which is consistent with the result of the in vitro study ( Figure 1C , lower panel arrow). We further investigated EV71 infection-induced LC3-II and VP1 expression in the brain tissues of the infected mice at 6 hr, 12 hr and 24 hr p.i. by Western blotting. Figure 4B showed that VP1 expression was detected and increased in the brains of the mice from 6 hr to 24 hr p.i. (Figure 4B , lanes 3, 4 and 5). Accordingly, increased LC3-II expression was also detected from 6 hr to 24 hr p.i. (Figure 4B , lanes 3, 4 and 5) compared to the uninfected sham control ( Figure 4B , lane 1). Autophagy inhibitor 3-MA was used to block autophagic activity during EV71 infection to further confirm the effect of EV71-induced autophagy on viral production. Figure 4B showed that LC3-II expression was suppressed 55% by 3-MA in Sham control mice without infection ( Figure 4B, lane 2) , and EV71-induced LC3-II expression was suppressed about 73% accompanied with VP1 level was suppressed about 24% at 24 hr p.i. in the presence of 3-MA compared with that of the EV71-infected group without 3-MA treatment ( Figure 4B , lane 8 vs. lane 5). Above results suggest that both endogenous as well as EV71-induced autophagy could be blocked by 3-MA, EV-71-induced autophagy affects viral production in the infected mice brains. In our previous report, manipulation of autophagy with 3-MA, rapamycin, tamoxifen and starvation can affect EV71 titer, suggesting that autophagy plays a supportive role in EV71 replication, and the inhibitor 3-MA showed no side effect both in vitro and in vivo [38] . The result that 3-MA only partially suppressed EV-71 VP1 expression compared to LC3-II expression at 24 h p.i. is consistent with our published reports of dengue virus [38] and EV71 [36] that EV71 and dengue virusinduced autophagy only plays a supportive role in viral replication. Therefore, suppressing autophagy virus can still replicate but to a less amount. In addition, the expression level of Beclin-1 (BECN1) showed no significant change, indicating that it is not involved in EV71induced autophagy. A similar result was seen in dengue virus-infected suckling mice [38] . In summary, EV71 infection of the suckling mice can induce an autophagic flux, which involves autophagosome and amphisome formation in the brain tissues.",

            "text": "We previously reported that the MP4 strain of EV71 can induce autophagy in suckling mice [36] . However, the effects of EV71-induced autophagy on disease symptoms, mortality, and viral replication in vivo remain undetermined. To evaluate the pathological effect of EV71-induced autophagy on the infected mice, autophagy activity was suppressed by 3-MA, and the physiopathological parameters, including the body weight and disease symptoms of the mice, were monitored daily after EV71 infection for 6 and 7 days, respectively. Our data showed that the body weight of the infected mice, both with and without 3-MA treatment, significantly dropped from day 3 to day 6 ( Figure 5A, left panel) , indicating that autophagy played no specific role in the loss of body weight of the infected mice. Furthermore, the disease symptoms were detected from day 1 to day 7 p.i. in the EV71-infected mice. The detection of disease symptoms was delayed to day 3 p.i. in the EV71-infected mice with 3-MA (EV71 + 3-MA), whereas the uninfected (sham) and 3-MA-only controls showed no disease symptoms at all ( Figure 5A, right panel) . To determine the viral titer, the brains of the infected mice shown in Figure 5A were collected and subjected to plaque assay. Our data showed that the titer of EV71 in the 3-MA treated group was significantly reduced compared with that of the PBS-treated group at 12 p.i. (Figure 5B and 5C), indicating that EV71-induced autophagy promotes viral replication in vivo, which was similar to the result of our in vitro investigation [36] . Figure 4 Autophagy accompanied by autophagosome and amphisome formation was induced in the brain tissues of EV71 MP4-infected suckling mice. Seven-day-old ICR suckling mice were inoculated intracranially with EV71 MP4 (5 \u00d7 10 5 pfu/mouse). Mice were sacrificed at 24 hr p.i.. (A) Autophagosome and amphisome formation was detected in the brain stem of the EV71 MP4-infected suckling mice. The tissue sections were treated with either mouse monoclonal or rabbit polyclonal anti-LC3 antibody and anti-MPR rabbit polyclonal antibody anti-EV71 VP1 mouse monoclonal antibody. Green: MPR; Red: EV71 VP1; Yellow: colocalization of MPR and EV71 VP1. Arrow indicates colocalization. (B) Seven-dayold ICR suckling mice (n = 3, each group) were pretreated with 3-MA (0.3 mg/mouse) 2 hr before inoculation of EV71 MP4 (5 \u00d7 10 5 pfu/mouse). Mice brain tissues were harvested and total protein lysate was collected after EV71 infection for 6 hr, 12 hr and 24 hr. The total protein lysate from each group was pooled together and the expression levels of EV71 VP1, LC3-II, and BECN1 were measured by Western blotting using specific antibodies. \u03b2-actin was used as the internal control. The numbers under each band are the quantification of the band intensity. For the comparison of VP1 protein expression levels, the intensity of EV71 infected cells without 3-MA treatment at 6 hr p.i. was set as 1 (normalized with the intensity of \u03b2-actin).",

            "text": "We have reported that EV71 infection of human rhabdomyosarcoma RD and neuronal SK-N-SH cells both induce autophagy, which is beneficial for viral replication. Our investigation of the signaling pathway revealed that the decreased expression of phosphorylated mTOR and phosphorylated p70S6K is involved in EV71-induced autophagy in a cell-specific manner. Other signaling pathway molecules, including extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk), PI3K/Akt, Bcl-2, BNIP3, and Beclin-1, are not involved. Electron microscopy showed colocalization of double-membrane autophagosome-like vesicles with EV71-VP1 and LC3 protein in the brain tissue of the ICR mice infected by EV71. These data indicate that EV71 infection triggered autophagic activity and induced autophagosome-like formation both in vitro and in vivo [36] . However, this report did not clarify whether EV71 infection can induce an autophagic flux and did not show the effect of EV71-induced autophagy on the physiopathological responses and viral titer of the infected mice. Here, we demonstrated that EV71-induced autophagy could indeed trigger the autophagic flux and amphisome formation in human neuronal SK-N-SH cells (Figures 1 and 2 and Additional file 1). Panyasrivanit et al. have shown that the DV2 titer is increased by blocking autophagic flux using fusion blocker L-asparagine, suggesting that the autophagic flux process decreases DV2 titer [22] . However, blocking autophagic flux by NH 4 Cl or vinblastine (Vin) decreased VP1 expression, indicating that autophagic flux is beneficial for EV71 replication. While these findings shed light on the role of the autophagic flux in EV71 replication, further clarification is needed.",

            "text": "Overexpression of the hepatitis B virus X gene enhances starvation-induced autophagy through the upregulation of Beclin 1 expression [40] . Poliovirus 2BC and 3A proteins regulate LC3 modification and membrane induction [29, 41] . DV2 NS4A protein induces LC3 cleavage and translocation in epithelial cells [42] . Furthermore, we compared viral structural protein VP1 and nonstructural protein 2C for their relationship with autophagosome and amphisome and found that these two proteins were abundantly colocalized with LC3 protein around the autophagosome ( Figure 1A ) in the infected cells. Tang et al. reported that the EV71 2C protein is associated with host membrane vesicles, which form viral replication complexes where viral RNA synthesis takes place [39] . Greninger et al. reported that enteroviruses utilize their 3A and 2BC proteins to reorganize cellular membranes associated with the Golgi apparatus [43] . It is possible that EV71 nonstructural 2C protein may form a replication complex with RNA on the autophagosome. A similar phenomenon has been reported with other viral infections [32, 34, [44] [45] [46] . Poliovirus and Coxsackieviruses B3 and B4 may induce the accumulation of membrane-like structures in the host cytoplasm early after infection [29, 34, 47] . In addition, The RNA replication complex of DV2, DV3, HIV-1, and influenza A virus, including viral RNA, structural, and nonstructural proteins, were colocalized with the autophagosomes or autolysosomes in the infected cells [22, 32, 48, 49] . Other reports showed that autophagic activation during virus infection, including influenza A virus, ectromelia virus, chikungunya virus, and flavivirus, can delay or block cell death to enhance viral replication [42, [50] [51] [52] . Xi et al. reported that EV71 infection of the rhabdomyosarcoma RD-A cells can induce both autophagy and apoptosis, and inhibition of autophagy may either inhibit or enhance apoptosis depending on the time of inhibition. Furthermore, inhibition of apoptosis induces autophagy [53] . Therefore, whether the autophagosome and amphisome complex are the sites for EV71 replication warrants further investigation. Additionally, further research is needed to establish whether EV71-induced autophagy enhances EV71 replication by suppressing apoptosis.",

Furthermore, the results revealed that the viral titer was significantly suppressed in the brain stem of the infected suckling mice after 3-MA treatment. This indicates that autophagy is involved in EV71-related pathogenesis and promotes viral replication in vivo. These results are similar to the findings of our previous report that showed DV2 infection of the suckling mice could also induce autophagy, which plays a promoting role in DV replication and pathogenesis [38] . Based on above results, we hypothesize that autophagy increases EV71 infection-related pathogenesis of the mice, at least partially, through the promotion of viral replication. However, blockage of autophagy by 3-MA showed no significant increase of the survival rate of EV71-infected mice (data not shown), which was similar to the result of the DV2-infected mice [38] . Wu et al. reported that 3-MA plays dual roles in autophagy. Under starvation conditions, 3-MA suppresses PI3K class III and inhibits autophagy; in contrast, under normal conditions, 3-MA promotes autophagic flux [56] . Therefore, the treatment conditions of 3-MA need to be further optimized to increase its inhibitory effect on autophagy. Further research using autophagy gene knockout mice is needed to obtain conclusive in vivo evidence of the involvement of autophagy in the EV71-related pathogenesis.",
