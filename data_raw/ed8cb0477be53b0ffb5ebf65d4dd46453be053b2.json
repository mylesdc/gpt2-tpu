Healthcare workers (HCWs) have elevated risk of contact with EBOV-infected patients, particularly if safety precautions are not rigorously practiced. We conducted a serosurvey to determine seroprevalence against multiple EBOV antigens among HCWs of Boende Health Zone, Democratic Republic of the Congo, the site of a 2014 EBOV outbreak. Interviews and specimens were collected from 565 consenting HCWs. Overall, 234 (41.4%) of enrolled HCWs were reactive to at least 1 EBOV protein: 159 (28.1%) were seroreactive for anti-glycoprotein immunoglobulin G (IgG), 89 (15.8%) were seroreactive for anti-nucleoprotein IgG, and 54 (9.5%) were VP40 positive. Additionally, sera from 16 (2.8%) HCWs demonstrated neutralization capacity. These data demonstrate that a significant proportion of HCWs have the ability to neutralize virus, despite never having developed Ebola virus disease symptoms, highlighting an important and poorly documented aspect of EBOV infection and progression.",

Since then, there have been >37 EVD outbreaks spanning 14 different countries in Africa, Europe, Asia, and North America, with the majority caused by EBOV, 8 of which (including an outbreak that is currently unfolding at the time of manuscript submission, May 2018) have occurred in the DRC [3] . During these outbreaks, there was increased infection and deaths among those healthcare workers (HCWs) charged with the responsibility of caring for those suffering with EVD, a contributing factor to outbreak progression [4] .",

Human-to-human transmission of ebolavirus occurs through direct contact with bodily fluids (vomit, diarrhea), secretions, or blood of infected people via broken skin or mucous membranes; it may also be transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces and materials (eg, bedding, clothing) [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . This risk is even greater in limited resource settings of sub-Saharan Africa and has been documented in several studies assessing the seroprevalence of bloodborne pathogens in these populations [10] [11] [12] [13] . Historically, HCWs have perpetuated the spread and amplification of EVD and serve as axes of viral transmission, often before ebolavirus is even recognized as the causative agent [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . The symptoms of EVD are frequently nonspecific, characterized by fever, headache, fatigue, muscle pain, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain [22] , and can easily be confused with other endemic diseases such as typhoid or malaria [23] . The difficulties associated with clinical recognition and diagnostic capabilities make prevention efforts for HCWs complex because infected workers may transmit disease before any symptoms are accurately diagnosed.",

Understanding serologic responses in high-risk populations, such as HCWs, and determining overall seroprevalence in areas with previous EVD outbreaks may provide more information on exposure. Current literature on HCWs and serological testing for ebolaviruses (for evidence of exposure) is restricted mainly to anti-glycoprotein (GP) antibody, the viral protein critical for attachment to and penetration of host cells. Because of its positioning on the virion surface, GP is a target of neutralizing antibodies and has been frequently studied as a target for vaccines and other therapeutics [22, [25] [26] [27] . Furthermore, Richardson et al suggest limiting the definition of EBOV seropositivity to anti-GP reactivity based on a comparison of anti-GP and anti-nucleoprotein (NP) antibody responses [28] . However, a separate experiment by Becquart and colleagues in 2014, comparing sera from asymptomatic seropositive individuals to symptomatic survivors of EVD, showed that immunoglobulin G (IgG) responses were qualitatively different in each group: The asymptomatic group displayed a larger response to EBOV matrix protein (VP40), whereas the survivors had greater IgG responses to GP [29] . These findings indicate that anti-GP alone may not be sufficient as a marker for demonstration of previous exposure, especially in asymptomatically infected or otherwise unrecognized EVD survivors.",

The study included a sociodemographic and epidemiologic questionnaire and sample collection. Blood specimens frozen, stored and tested were obtained from all consenting participants by venipuncture into red-top Vacutainer tubes (BD Biosciences).

The scatterplot presented in Figure 3 presents the distribution of test results by HCW contact type. Among HCWs considered in direct contact with patients, traditional healers, pastors, and midwives had the highest GP and NP seroprevalence (excluding physicians due to sample size, n = 2), whereas Red Cross workers had the highest VP40 seroprevalence and neutralizing capacity (22.2% and 5.6% respectively; P < .05).

A serological survey conducted during Kikwit EBOV outbreak found prevalence of 2.2% among health workers and 9.3% in surrounding villages [41] . A recent study in Watsa in the northeastern region of the DRC reported an EBOV seroprevalence of 18.7% in the local Efe population [42] . When exploring trends by patient contact, the highest GP seroprevalence was observed in the \"unlikely\" contact group. However, within each category there was significant heterogeneity. These differences may be explained by the fact that, in an outbreak situation, everyone, including guards and administrators, could be required to assist with potentially infected persons when regular hospital staff are not able to meet the demands of the patients, potentially leading to exposures to bodily fluids, sick patients, or community members. This group also likely reflects the general population and may indicate that there is endemic EBOV exposure in this area. However, overall these results most likely suggest that the GP ELISA as a standalone test is relatively nonspecific. This may be due to unrelated nonspecific binding, with the high degree of glycosylation in EBOV GP lending itself to such nonspecific recognition. Alternately, it may be that GP is more sensitive than other viral proteins to the presence of cross-reactive antibodies directed against related viruses. In contrast, the unique mechanism of ebolavirus entry lends itself to highly specific, but possibly insensitive, detection of prior ebolavirus infection [43] .",

This includes 3 individuals who were seroreactive on all tests and exhibited neutralizing capacity: a 52-year-old midwife, a 48-year-old administrator, and a 78-year-old volunteer. It is not known whether seroreactivity to assays is related to EBOV exposure during the 2014 outbreak-in particular because all HCWs included for this analysis participated in the outbreak response and reported varying levels of contact with EVD patients and biological specimens. It may also be possible that variation in antigenic response and neutralization levels may be related to asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic infection, which would not have been necessarily detected as illness due to EBOV [44] . It is possible that some seroreactive individuals could also have been exposed to a non-EBOV filovirus.",

We attempted to make our study population as diverse as possible by enrolling participants in both formal and informal settings, and those who may have been displaced from their normal facility to support the outbreak response. There may have been some misclassification of specific HCW occupations, and patient contact was categorized based on occupation type and not recall of contact exposures. In addition, HCWs may play multiple different roles depending on the need of the facility during the outbreak response. We attempted to classify them based on their primary position in the health facility. Furthermore, all results are based on serologic assays, so adjusting the cutoff value can affect the overall results. Thus, we explored the range of responses (Figure 3 ) from each assay and used a higher manufacturer cutoff based on the calibration curve provided, assuming a higher background rate of cross-reactivity.",

Providing adequate training of HCWs to infection control procedures and availability of personal protective equipment to reduce exposure to bodily fluids of patients they treat before an EVD outbreak occurs is ultimately one of the most important strategies to limit the spread of ebolavirus and other blood-borne pathogens of both high and low consequence. Furthermore, our findings raise additional questions about EBOV exposure, risk, and circulating virus in DRC. Currently, there is no serological gold standard for ebolavirus serology. Our results highlight the need for additional research to better understand the roles each protein plays in immune response. Better understanding of the significance of EVD seroreactivity and risk factors associated with these exposures will improve our ability to design and implement locally sustainable strategies to limit exposure of HCWs to ebolavirus and other pathogens.
