Therefore, novel antiretroviral drugs with different modes of actions are still a major focus for researchers. In particular, novel lead structures are being sought from natural sources. So far, a number of compounds from marine organisms have been identified as promising therapeutics for HIV infection. Therefore, in this paper, we provide an overview of marine natural products that were first identified in the period between 2013 and 2018 that could be potentially used, or further optimized, as novel antiretroviral agents. This pipeline includes the systematization of antiretroviral activities for several categories of marine structures including chitosan and its derivatives, sulfated polysaccharides, lectins, bromotyrosine derivatives, peptides, alkaloids, diterpenes, phlorotannins, and xanthones as well as adjuvants to the HAART therapy such as fish oil. We critically discuss the structures and activities of the most promising new marine anti-HIV compounds.",

HIV targets immune cells and impairs the human defense against pneumonia, tuberculosis, and shingles as well as certain types of cancer [1] . The most advanced stage of HIV infection is the Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS), which can take from two to 15 years to develop, depending on the individual [2] . HIV has two viral forms: HIV-1 (the most common form that accounts for around 95% of all infections worldwide) and HIV-2 (relatively uncommon and less infectious). HIV-1 consists of groups M, N, O, and P with at least nine genetically distinct subtypes of HIV-1 within group M (A, B, C, D, F, G, H, J, and K). Additionally, different subtypes can combine genetic material to form a hybrid virus known as the 'circulating recombinant form' (CRFs) (Figure 1 ). HIV-2 consists of eight known groups (A to H). Of these, only groups A and B are pandemic. The HIV-2 mechanism is not clearly defined and neither is its difference from HIV-1. However, the transmission rate is much lower in HIV-2 than in HIV-1. HIV-2 is estimated to be more than 55% genetically distinct from HIV-1.

            "text": "Chitosan (2, Figure 2 ), a natural marine byproduct, is a poly-cationic linear polysaccharide derived from chitin (1, Figure 2 ) after partial deacetylation. Chitin is a structural element in the exoskeleton of mainly shrimps and crabs and is mainly composed of the randomly distributed \u03b2-(1-4)-linked D-glucosamine and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine. It has been previously shown that this compound can exhibit a large scale of different bioactivities and can also be used as a carrier for anti-HIV drugs [31] . Chitosan is loaded with saquinavir, an anti-HIV drug with a protease inhibitory activity, which showed better cell targeting efficiency than saquinavir alone [32] . Furthermore, trimethyl chitosan has improved Atripla, an anti-HIV drug consisting of efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, anti-HIV 1 activity, and has allowed it to be used in lower concentrations [33] . The antiretroviral activity is manifested in the chitosan-specific cationic nature that allows the formation of electrostatic complexes or multilayer structures with other negatively charged polymers [34] . Karagozlu et al. reported about new QMW-COS and WMQ-COS oligomers with anti-HIV activities. These oligomers are conjugates of chitosan and the Gln-Met-Trp peptide, which were constructed as a continuation of the authors' previous research, in which a high potency of synthetically constructed chitosan oligomers was confirmed in anti-HIV therapy. More specifically, it was shown that these oligomers suppress syncytium formation, which occurs as a fusion of infected cells with neighboring cells, induced by HIV in a dose-dependent manner. However, the authors also noticed that after a certain period, the number of syncytia once again increased, suggesting that the cells should be re-treated with QMW-COS and WMQ-COS oligomers to maintain the primary therapeutically-relevant effect. The inhibition of the HIV-1 induced lytic effect, determined by the cell viability assay, showed that IC 50 for QMW-COS was 48.14 \u00b5g/mL and was almost identical for WMQ-COS, 48 .01 \u00b5g/mL. These oligomers effectively reduced the HIV load but showed no effects on HIV-1 RT and protease in vitro. Higher dosages were also required for the reduction in the HIV-1IIIB p24 antigen production assessed by the ELISA assay and the HIV-1 RTMDR p24 antigen production. The highest difference between the compounds was reflected in IC 50 values obtained from studies on the virus-induced luciferase activity in infected cells, where QMW-COS had a higher potency in comparison with WMQ-COS. Lastly, the authors determined the effects of oligomers on the interaction between gp41 and CD4 by using the CD4-gp41 ELISA assay, whereby both oligomers showed high potency. The effect of these oligomers was highest when they were applied immediately upon the HIV-1 infection of cells, indicating that they should be used as a potential treatment in the early stages of HIV infection, probably at the entry stage [31] .",

Many studies indicate that, in marine algae, sulfated polysaccharides facilitate water and ion retention in extracellular matrices, which is an important mechanism for coping with desiccation and osmotic stress in a highly salted environment [38] [39] [40] . The antiviral activity of this group of compounds is mainly connected to the degree of sulfation, constituent sugars, molecular weight, conformation, and dynamic stereochemistry [41, 42] . The effect of counter cation should also be considered as an important factor in observed biological activity.",

While the in vitro results of the fucosylated CS against HIV are promising, it is questionable whether the antiviral activity would be maintained in vivo. Other polyanionic HIV entry inhibitors, which advanced into clinical trials, failed to prove effective against the heterosexual HIV-1 transmission. This was related to factors not considered in previous development stages, such as the presence of seminal plasma and the concentration and retention of polyanionic inhibitors [62] . The complex chemical architecture and the sulfate patterning of marine polysaccharides depends on numerous factors (species, tidal cycles, environmental variations (e.g., salinity), harvesting season, plant age, geographical location etc.) [39, [63] [64] [65] [66] [67] [68] [69] , making isolation, purification, and comprehensive chemical characterization a highly challenging task [70] . The development of many polysaccharides into clinical application is hindered by the still limited view of their sophisticated and diverse nature. Despite having good antiviral effects, the use of carbohydrate drugs is still in its infancy, and intensive structure-activity and in vivo studies are needed in the future.",

Aeroplysinin 1 (15) and purealidin B (16), compounds found in V. rigida species inhibited the HIV-1 replication in a dose-dependent manner by more than 50%. Specifically, for aeroplysinin 1, HIV-a replication was inhibited by 74% at a concentration of 20 \u00b5M, whereas purealidin was less potent with inhibitory power of 57% at a concentration of 80 \u00b5M. These two compounds had been previously isolated; however, their anti-HIV activity was proven in this research. The same was with 3-bromo-5-hydroxy-O-methyltyrosine (18) that has a relatively high percentage of inhibition of HIV activity (47%) in a dose-dependent manner. However, the exact mechanism of action remains unclear. In the same study, additional tests with these compounds on the HIV RT inhibition (qPCR of the early and late transcripts), nuclear import (qPCR analysis of 2-LTR transcript), and HIV entry inhibition (viral infectivity assay) were performed.

Viral RT inhibition was not high for all compounds, whereby the highest results were around 50% of inhibition. For example, purealidin B had 58% of inhibition at 20 \u00b5M in the qPCR analysis of early transcripts. As for the HIV entry inhibition, all compounds were active in a dose-depended manner, with the highest results of inhibition obtained for 3,5-dibromo-N,N,N,O-tetramethyltyraminium (13) , from 14% to 30%.

Viral RT inhibition was not high for all compounds, whereby the highest results were around 50% of inhibition. For example, purealidin B had 58% of inhibition at 20 \u00b5M in the qPCR analysis of early transcripts. As for the HIV entry inhibition, all compounds were active in a dose-depended manner, with the highest results of inhibition obtained for 3,5-dibromo-N,N,N,O-tetramethyltyraminium (13) , from 14% to 30%.

This peptide is a Gly-Pro-Hyp-Gly-Pro-Hyp-Gly-Pro-Hyp-Gly peptide, and the authors showed that the most important part of a peptide for anti-HIV activity is the hydroxyl group at hydroxyproline, whereas a peptide with only prolines does not exhibit antiviral activity. Its anti-HIV 1 mode of action is manifested through the inhibition of the induced syncytia formation by the interference of an HIV fusion, inhibition of cell lysis, RT activity, and the production of the p24 antigen. It was shown that APHCP can decrease the HIV-1 induced cell lysis at a potency around EC 50 of 459 \u00b5M (EC 50 against anti-HIV-1 induced cell lysis-MTT assay). Additionally, through the inhibition of the viral RT at EC 50 at 374 \u00b5M, this peptide's crucial role in the inhibition of the conversion of viral RNA to DNA was also confirmed.

            "text": "Aspernigrin C (22, Figure 9 ) and malformin C (23, Figure 9 ) have been isolated from marine-derived black aspergili, Aspergillus niger SCSIO Jcw6F30, and their inhibitory activity against the chemokine receptor subtype 5 (CCR5) tropic HIV-1 SF162 has been evaluated. They show potent inhibition of infection with IC 50 values 4.7 \u00b1 0.4 \u00b5M and 1.4 \u00b1 0.06 \u00b5M, which is comparable to the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-abacavir (IC 50 = 0.8 \u00b1 0.1 \u00b5M) and the HIV-1 entry inhibitor ADS-J1 (IC 50 = 0.8 \u00b1 0.1 \u00b5M). In comparison to other aspernigrins, it has been suggested that the 2-methylsuccinic moiety is responsible for the potency of aspernigrin C [96] . Thiodiketopiperazine-type alkaloids, eutypellazines A-M, isolated from the EtOAc extract of the fermentation broth of deep-sea sediment fungus Eutypella sp. shows potent inhibitory effects against pNL4.3.Env-.Luc co-transfected 293T HIV model cells. Eutypellazine E (24, Figure 10 ) exerts activity in a low micromolar range (IC50 = 3.2 \u00b1 0.4 \u00b5M), while eutypellazine J (25, Figure 10 ) shows a reactivating effect toward latent HIV-1 in J-Lat A2 cells. This could be used as a promising strategy to expunge the HIV-1 infection by activating latent virus cellular reservoirs in combination with HAART [97] . The S. carteri Red Sea sponge extract yields three previously characterized compounds: debromohymenialdisine (DBH) (26, Figure 11 ), hymenialdisine (HD) (27, Figure 11 ), and oroidin (28, Figure 11 ). DBH and HD exhibited a 30-40% inhibition of HIV-1 at 3.1 \u00b5M and 13 \u00b5M but with associated cytotoxicity. Conversely, oroidin displayed a 50% inhibition of viral replication at 50 \u00b5M without observed cytotoxicity. Also, it showed inhibition of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase up to 90% at 25 \u00b5Mc [98] .

Additionally, they investigated the virucidal effect of these diterpenes and their potential use as microbicides. Dolastane-diterpenes 38 and 40 showed a potent effect on HIV-1 infectivity, whereas no virucidal effect was observed for secodolastane diterpene 39, demonstrating another mechanism of antiretroviral activity. Therefore, the authors suggested a potential use of marine dolastanes 38 and 40 as microbicides that could directly inhibit virus infectivity and possibly act before the virus penetrates the target cells [103] .

Figure 16 ) and secodolastane diterpenes (39, Figure 16 ) isolated from the brown alga Canistrocarpus cervicornis for anti-HIV-1 activity [103] . They observed that the marine diterpenes 38-40 inhibit the HIV-1 replication in a dose-dependent manner (EC50 values of 0.35, 3.67, and 0.794 \u00b5M) without a cytotoxic effect (CC50 values ranging from 935 to 1910 \u00b5M). Additionally, they investigated the virucidal effect of these diterpenes and their potential use as microbicides. Dolastane-diterpenes 38 and 40 showed a potent effect on HIV-1 infectivity, whereas no virucidal effect was observed for secodolastane diterpene 39, demonstrating another mechanism of antiretroviral activity. Therefore, the authors suggested a potential use of marine dolastanes 38 and 40 as microbicides that could directly inhibit virus infectivity and possibly act before the virus penetrates the target cells [103] . Figure 16 ) and secodolastane diterpenes (39, Figure 16 ) isolated from the brown alga Canistrocarpus cervicornis for anti-HIV-1 activity [103] . They observed that the marine diterpenes 38-40 inhibit the HIV-1 replication in a dose-dependent manner (EC 50 values of 0.35, 3.67, and 0.794 \u00b5M) without a cytotoxic effect (CC 50 values ranging from 935 to 1910 \u00b5M).

Therefore, the authors suggested a potential use of marine dolastanes 38 and 40 as microbicides that could directly inhibit virus infectivity and possibly act before the virus penetrates the target cells [103] . Dolabelladienetriol from brown alga Dictyota spp has also been evaluated as a potential microbicide against HIV-1 in tissue explants. Namely, Stephens et al. examined the 8,10,18trihydroxy-2,6-dolabelladiene (41, Figure 17 ) in pretreated peripheral blood cells (PBMC) and macrophages along with their protective effect in the ex vivo explant model of the uterine cervix [104] . Pre-treatment of peripheral PBMC and macrophages with dolabelladienotriol showed inhibitory effects on HIV-1 replication. Furthermore, in the explant model dolabelladienetriol inhibited viral replication in a dose-dependent manner from 20 to 99% in concentrations of 0.15 and 14.4 \u00b5M without a loss in the viability of the tissue. The authors concluded that this compound has great potential as a possible microbicide. The same compound was also theoretically analyzed as an inhibitor of the wild-type and mutants' HIV-1 reverse transcriptase [105] . Firstly, the structureactivity relationship studies revealed that a low dipole moment and high HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital)-LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) gap values are related to the antiviral activity. Secondly, molecular docking studies with RT wild-type and mutants showed a seahorse-like conformation of 8,10,18-trihydroxy-2,6-dolabelladiene, hydrophobic interactions, and hydrogen bonds with important residues of the binding pocket. Finally, the authors suggested a new derivative of the 8,10,18-trihydroxy-2,6-dolabelladiene with an aromatic moiety in the double bond to improve its biological activity. Although dolabellane diterpenes of brown alga Dictyota spp showed a strong anti-HIV-1 activity, this was not confirmed for dolabellane diterpenes isolated from octocorals. Therefore, some chemical transformations have been conducted to improve the anti-HIV-1 potency of the main dolabellane 13-keto-1(R),11(S)-dolabella-3(E),7(E),12(18)-triene from Caribbean octocoral Eunicea laciniata [106] . Oxygenated dolabellanes derivatives (42-44, Figure 18 ), obtained by epoxidation, epoxide opening, and allylic oxidation of ketodolbellatriene have shown significantly improved antiviral activities and a low cytotoxicity to MT-2 cells, which makes them promising antiviral compounds. Dolabelladienetriol from brown alga Dictyota spp has also been evaluated as a potential microbicide against HIV-1 in tissue explants.",

So far, a series of phlorotannins have been identified with potent anti-HIV activity. For example, 8,8 -bieckol and 6,6 -bieckol from marine brown alga Ecklonia cava has shown an enhanced HIV-1 inhibitory effect [112, 113] . Karadeniz et al. reported that 8,4 -dieckol (45, Figure 19 ) is another phlorotannin derivative isolated from the same brown alga that could be used as a drug candidate for the development of new generation anti-HIV therapeutic agents [107] . The compound showed HIV-1 inhibitory activity at noncytotoxic concentrations. More precisely, the results indicated that 8,4 -dieckol inhibited the cytopathic effects of HIV-1, including HIV-1 induced syncytia formation, lytic effects, and viral p24 antigen production. Furthermore, 8,4 -dieckol inhibited an HIV-1 entry and RT enzyme with the inhibition ratio of 91% at a concentration of 50 \u00b5M. ",

            "text": "Phlorotannins are tannin derivatives made from several phloroglucinol units linked to each other in different ways. Phlorotannins contain phenyl linkage (fucols), ether linkage (fuhalols and phlorethols), phenyl and ether linkage (fucophloroethols), and dibenzodioxin linkage (eckols) [86, 107] . So far, a series of phlorotannins have been identified with potent anti-HIV activity. For example, 8,8\u2032-bieckol and 6,6\u2032-bieckol from marine brown alga Ecklonia cava has shown an enhanced HIV-1 inhibitory effect [112, 113] . Karadeniz et al. reported that 8,4\u2032\u2032\u2032-dieckol (45, Figure 19 ) is another phlorotannin derivative isolated from the same brown alga that could be used as a drug candidate for the development of new generation anti-HIV therapeutic agents [107] . The compound showed HIV-1 inhibitory activity at noncytotoxic concentrations. More precisely, the results indicated that 8,4\u2032\u2032\u2032-dieckol inhibited the cytopathic effects of HIV-1, including HIV-1 induced syncytia formation, lytic effects, and viral p24 antigen production. Furthermore, 8,4\u2032\u2032\u2032-dieckol inhibited an HIV-1 entry and RT enzyme with the inhibition ratio of 91% at a concentration of 50 \u00b5M. Recently, for the first time, xanthone dimer was identified as a potential anti-HIV-1 agent [108] . Xanthones are secondary metabolites from higher plant families, fungi, and lichen [114, 115] . Although structurally related to flavonoids, xanthones are not as frequently encountered in nature [9] . Penicillixanthone A (PXA) (46, Figure 20) , a natural xanthone dimer, has been isolated from the jellyfish-derived fungus Aspergillus fumigates with fourteen other natural products [108] . However, only penicillixanthone A showed inhibitory activities in an HIV infection. Marine-derived PXA displayed potent anti-HIV-1 activity against CCR5-tropic HIV-1 SF162 and CXCR4-tropic HIV-1 NL4-3, with IC50 of 0.36 and 0.26 \u00b5M, respectively. A molecular docking study confirmed that PXA might bind to either CCR5 or CXCR4 to prevent HIV entry into target cells. Therefore, PXA, as a CCR5/CXCR4 dual-coreceptor antagonist, may be seen as a new potential lead product type for the development of anti-HIV therapeutics.

Therefore, finding an adequate diet and supplementation to lower the negative effects of the HAART combination therapy is desirable [116] . Fish oil contains omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), eicosapentaenoic (EPA, 20:5n-3) (47, Figure 21 ) and docosahexaenoic (DHA, 22:6n-3) (48, Figure 21 ) acids, which may have beneficial effects for HIVinfected patients. It has been shown that the addition of fish oil to the diet of HIV-infected individuals receiving usual antiretroviral therapy can significantly lower serum triglycerides levels [117] , which is highly relevant knowing that HIV dyslipidemia is a serious problem related to an increased frequency of cardiovascular disease. Recently, He et al. analyzed the influence of DHA on the locomotor activity in ethanol-treated HIV-1 transgenic rats [109] . The prevalence of alcohol use and alcohol abuse in infected individuals is much higher, and numerous ethanol and HIV-1 viral proteins have synergistic effects on inflammation in the central nervous system [118] [119] [120] . HIV remains in the body in its latent form after HAART therapy and, as such, can induce neuroinflammation. DHA depletion has been found to be associated with various neurological abnormalities, and its administration can have a neuroprotective effect. DHA taken daily could reverse the effects of the ethanol negative effect on the locomotor activity in the presence of HIV viral proteins. An in vivo study, using real-time quantitative PCR, showed that the addition of DHA can reduce elevated levels of IL-6, IL-18, and increase the expression of NF-\u03baB in the striatum. This proved the potential of this fish oil constituent as an adjuvant in HIV patients' treatment that can help in lowering the interactive effects of ethanol consumption during HIV infection.",

HIV remains in the body in its latent form after HAART therapy and, as such, can induce neuroinflammation. DHA depletion has been found to be associated with various neurological abnormalities, and its administration can have a neuroprotective effect. DHA taken daily could reverse the effects of the ethanol negative effect on the locomotor activity in the presence of HIV viral proteins. An in vivo study, using real-time quantitative PCR, showed that the addition of DHA can reduce elevated levels of IL-6, IL-18, and increase the expression of NF-\u03baB in the striatum. This proved the potential of this fish oil constituent as an adjuvant in HIV patients' treatment that can help in lowering the interactive effects of ethanol consumption during HIV infection.",

Additionally, there exist but few publications in which scientists have tried to modify known compounds of marine origin to improve their bioactivity. We are, however, continuously witnessing advancements in the deep-sea exploration technology, sampling strategies, genome sequencing, genome mining, genetic engineering, chemo-enzymatic synthesis, nanoscale NMR structure determination, and development and optimization of suitable fermentation strategies to ensure a continued supply of unique bioactive compounds from the oceans. Therefore, the grounds have been met for a broad, international effort based on scientific collaboration that would rely on well-equipped infrastructure and human resources as a prerequisite for a full advancement in the field and development of new drug candidates for the pharmaceutical market in the future.",
