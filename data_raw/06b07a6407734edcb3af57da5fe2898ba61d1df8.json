The critical importance of using PPE properly is highlighted by 2 potentially fatal viral infections: severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Ebola virus. The SARS-CoV epidemic in Asia and Toronto during 2002-2003 led to >8000 cases, with most transmission occurring in healthcare settings, and the more recent Ebola outbreak in West Africa during 2014-2016 resulted in >28 000 infected individuals with 11 000 fatalities [1] . In both epidemics, HCP became infected while caring for patients due to errors in the use of PPE, raising the question of how well PPE is designed to support HCP [2] .",

This position is implicit in the hazardbarrier-target model and the accident evolution and barrier function model and implies that PPE can be designed and evaluated in isolation. An alternative approach is to conceptualize safe and effective PPE use from a sociotechnical perspective. Factors to consider that may interact and influence PPE use include the equipment, user, task, and the environment. Equipment designed for HCP providing routine care may result in failures when HCP practice in emergency settings. For example, HCP who rush into a patient's room while distracted by an alarm may not don PPE properly. Cavazza and colleagues demonstrated that organizational and psychosocial factors influence risk behavior and attitudes of individuals toward PPE [3] . In addition, the organizational safety climate affects employees' shared perceptions of safety policies, procedures, and practices as well as potential for unsafe behaviors [4] .",

Issues or errors during any of these phases can lead to a risk of contamination to the HCP. Incorrect technique or sequence in donning can expose HCP during patient care, or sets HCP up for a doffing failure. Contamination of HCP can occur during patient care if PPE is damaged, has design flaws, or if HCP circumvent protection (ie, reaching under PPE). Risks of contamination during doffing can be due to an incorrect removal technique, improper handling and disposal of PPE, or by damaging PPE to expose HCP.",

Each of the 10 participants committed at least 1 PPE breach, and breaches occurred during all use phases. Donning issues included failures in properly tying the gown; touching unprotected body areas with contaminated PPE during care was common; and errors in removing PPE included doffing sequence deviations and improper mask removal. A qualitative study with 325 observations of isolation rooms in multiple hospitals was conducted to identify and characterize PPE use failures [6] . Two hundred eighty-three observed failures were categorized as violations (n = 102), process/procedural mistakes (n = 144), and slips (n = 37). Examples for these failures were entering the room without required PPE (violation), PPE doffing sequence errors (mistake), and wiping one's face with potentially contaminated gowned forearms (slip). The authors concluded that given the range of contributors to self-contamination events, no single strategy is sufficient to reduce transmission risk. Relatively little work has focused on redesigning PPE to make it more user friendly and to promote proper use. One example of a study that did use a human factors-based approach developed a standardized PPE storage cart with picture labels and PPE use instructions [7] . Baseline PPE compliance was only 47%, but increased to 81% after cart introduction.",

To summarize, 48 observations of randomly selected HCP were performed at a universitybased medical center with the hospital PPE guidelines based on Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations used as the expectation for proper gown use. Only 42% of HCP appropriately tied their gowns in the back, and subsequently removed the gowns by breaking the tie. Forty-eight percent potentially self-contaminated while doffing, and 42% did not follow the hospital-specified technique for gown disposal. The observations indicated that a large number of participants were at risk of contamination and suggested that there was a need to identify gown redesign opportunities. We determined that critical gaps in the standard gown included errors in closing the gown, potential for HCP exposure while providing care due to movement of the light gown material, difficulties with easily removing, and touching the external contaminated surfaces while doffing.",

Coding classified behaviors as adherent or nonadherent per hospital policy. Standardized instructional materials were used to train 3 coders to identify nonadherence in the recordings.

A closure mechanism using an asymmetrical closure approach was favored, with the gown secured by pulling a single strap from the back to front. An adhesive strip covered by red tape was placed at the end of the strap. Pulling the tape off the adhesive strip allowed for strap securement to the front of the gown. Another design change addressed the uniform color of the gown that prevented HCP from distinguishing between the clean inner and potentially contaminated outer surfaces. Initial designs ranged from a different-colored inside gown material, to applying tape to mark the clean surface. Pilot testing revealed that a combination of these approaches was most promising. As the lightweight and static-inducing gown material had a tendency to make contact with objects as well as expose the HCP lower body during movement, we determined the bottom edge of the gown needed to be heavier. To create this additional weight, the tape marking the inner surface was also attached along the bottom of the gown. Finally, we enhanced the perforated areas of the gown material to break more easily during the doffing process. Figure 1 shows the redesigned gown.",

Behavior and subjective measures provide a systematic and comprehensive approach in assessing PPE. The framework was used to test the impact of a redesigned gown prototype. While the behavior measures from observations of participants using the standard vs redesigned gown in the simulated clinical scenarios did not show differences, the assessment was biased in favor of the familiar, traditional gown over the unfamiliar prototype. However, differences were identified on the subjective measurements of the participants' perceptions of the standard and redesigned gowns. Participants experienced less time pressure, expressed higher usability, and rated overall the redesigned gown as superior on numerous attributes.

Nonetheless, some support for this perspective comes from work that examined the value of information technology investment in healthcare. This work suggests that the best predictor for changes in organizational performance is actual technology use, not technology investment [15] . Thus, it is plausible to assume that increased usability will affect use, with usability becoming a predictor for behavior and ultimately adherence. This relationship has been established by work demonstrating that perceived usability predicts use and behavior [16] . Thus, adherence could increase, but it will take longer observations to observe such change.",

Another potential limitation relates to the fact that this study limited the evaluation of the redesigned gown to nurses and nurses' aides. However, challenges and attitudes related to precaution practices and PPE use differ between different types of providers.
