The organic layer was separated and washed with 1N NaOH (2 x 30.0 ml), dried over Na 2 SO 4 , filtered and concentrated to give a white solid (5.1g, 74% yield) that was dried under vacuum and used without further purification. 1 To synthesize 2-(1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)thio-N-(2-chloro-4-methylphenyl) propanamide (substance (8) in supplement 1), a solution of 2-mercaptobenzimidazole (500.0 mg, 3.33 mmol) in tetrahydrofuran (30.0 ml) was treated with NaH (150.0 mg, 3.75 mmol) and the mixture stirred for 10 minutes. Substance (6) (supplement 1) (920.0 mg, 3.33 mmol) was added to the reaction and the mixture stirred for six hours. Water (15 ml) was added and the product extracted using ethylacetate, the organic layer then dried over Na 2 SO 4 , filtered and concentrated. The crude product was purified by silica column chromatography (hexanes/ethylacetate; 2:1) to give 740.0 mg of substance (8) in 64% yield. The product was used in consecutive steps without characterization. For synthesis of JMN5-165, a solution of substance (8) (supplement 1) (100.0 mg, 0.29 mmol) in CH 2 Cl 2 (3.0 ml) was mixed with benzenesulfonyl chloride (40.0 mL, 0.31 mmol) and i-Pr 2 NEt (80.0 mL, 0.46 mmol) and the reaction stirred for eight hours. NaHCO 3 (2.0 ml) was added to the reaction mixture, the organic layer separated and washed with brine (2.0 ml), then dried over Na 2 SO 4 and concentrated. The crude product was purified by silica column chromatrography (hexanes/ethylacetate) to give a white solid that was dried under vacuum. 1 H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl 3, \u03b4 = 7.24 ppm); ",
