One obstacle to controlling these epidemics is our poor understanding of the host range of filoviruses and their natural reservoirs. Here, we investigated the role of the intracellular filovirus receptor, Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) as a molecular determinant of Ebola virus (EBOV) host range at the cellular level. Whereas human cells can be infected by EBOV, a cell line derived from a Russell's viper (Daboia russellii) (VH-2) is resistant to infection in an NPC1-dependent manner. We found that VH-2 cells are resistant to EBOV infection because the Russell's viper NPC1 ortholog bound poorly to the EBOV spike glycoprotein (GP). Analysis of panels of viper-human NPC1 chimeras and point mutants allowed us to identify a single amino acid residue in NPC1, at position 503, that bidirectionally influenced both its binding to EBOV GP and its viral receptor activity in cells. Significantly, this single residue change perturbed neither NPC1's endosomal localization nor its housekeeping role in cellular cholesterol trafficking. Together with other recent work, these findings identify sequences in NPC1 that are important for viral receptor activity by virtue of their direct interaction with EBOV GP and suggest that they may influence filovirus host range in nature. Broader surveys of NPC1 orthologs from vertebrates may delineate additional sequence polymorphisms in this gene that control susceptibility to filovirus infection.",

We asked if the EBOV receptor Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) could explain why reptiles are resistant to EBOV infection. We demonstrate that cells derived from the Russell's viper are not susceptible to infection because EBOV cannot bind to viper NPC1. This resistance to infection can be mapped to a single amino acid residue in viper NPC1 that renders it unable to bind to EBOV GP. The newly solved structure of EBOV GP bound to NPC1 confirms our findings, revealing that this residue dips into the GP receptor-binding pocket and is therefore critical to the binding interface. Consequently, this otherwise well-conserved residue in vertebrate species influences the ability of reptilian NPC1 proteins to bind to EBOV GP, thereby affecting viral host range in reptilian cells.",

Bats are thought to be important reservoirs for filoviruses; however, conclusive evidence in favor of this hypothesis has been obtained only for Marburg virus (MARV) and Ravn virus (RAVV), which were recently found to circulate in Egyptian rousettes (Rousettus aegyptiacus) (4) (5) (6) (7) .",

These findings suggested the existence of one or more unknown determinants of filovirus host range. Although the determinants of filovirus infection and disease at the organismal level are likely to be complex, it is well established that interactions between viruses and cell-intrinsic host factors, such as entry receptors, can dictate host range. For example, ortholog-specific sequence variations in angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transferrin receptor (TfR1) influence the host range of viruses for which they serve as receptors (severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronaviruses [11, 12] and New World mammarenaviruses, canine parvoviruses, and murine mammary tumor virus [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] , respectively).

Here, we demonstrate that an adjacent residue, 503, highly conserved in domain C of NPC1, influences EBOV host range in reptilian cells by controlling its activity as a filovirus receptor. The recently solved structure of the EBOV entry glycoprotein (GP 1,2 ; hereafter referred to as GP) bound to domain C shows that these two residues are in a loop that dips into the exposed receptor-binding site (26) . Therefore, our findings identify a hot spot in NPC1 at the EBOV GP-binding interface that influences virusreceptor recognition and host cell susceptibility, suggesting evolutionary scenarios in which antagonism with filoviruses could sculpt host NPC1 genes selectively, without compromising their ancient, and essential, function in cellular cholesterol homeostasis.",

Accordingly, we assessed the capacity of DrNPC1 domain C to support NPC1's best-established cellular functionclearance of unesterified cholesterol from endo/lysosomal compartments ( Fig. 3A domains, A, C, and I. We therefore generated and tested an HsNPC1 chimera in which domain C (residues 373 to 620) was seamlessly replaced with its viper counterpart (HsNPC1-DrC)-we previously found that replacing domain C in NPC1 using restriction site cloning, which introduced two additional amino acid residues at each junction, resulted in proteins that were defective in localization and cholesterol clearance. The wild-type (WT) HsNPC1 and HsNPC1-DrC chimera constructs were then stably expressed in the NPC1-null Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) M12 cell line (24) . As expected, immunostaining of WT HsNPC1 transiently expressed in a U2OS NPC1 \u03ea/\u03ea cell line (27) showed colocalization with the endo/lysosomal marker LAMP1 (Fig. 3A) The behavior of HsNPC1-DrC resembled that of WT HsNPC1, indicating that it too localizes to endo/lysosomal compartments (Fig. 3A) . These results suggest that DrNPC1 domain C is correctly folded and does not interfere with the correct folding and trafficking of full-length HsNPC1.

These findings affirm that DrNPC1 domain C is biologically active and competent to perform a major housekeeping function of its human counterpart, despite its divergence from the latter at 48 out of 248 amino acid positions ( Fig. 1 ). Finally, we challenged M12 cell lines expressing WT HsNPC1 or HsNPC1-DrC with authentic EBOV (Fig. 3C ). Replacement of human domain C with its Russell's viper ortholog reduced EBOV infection by almost 3 orders of magnitude. Similar results were obtained in infections with rVSV-EBOV GP (Fig. 3D) , confirming that the DrNPC1 domain C-imposed infection block occurs at the viral entry step. Taken together, these observations afford two conclusions. First, the failure of DrNPC1 to support EBOV entry and infection arises at least in part because its domain C cannot bind to EBOV GP CL . Second, one or more differences between the domain C sequences of HsNPC1 and DrNPC1 render DrNPC1 bereft of viral receptor activity without perturbing its normal function in cellular cholesterol homeostasis.",

Conversely, HsNPC1 domain C proteins engineered to resemble DrNPC1 at each of these three positions remained fully competent to bind to EBOV GP CL .

Finally, we challenged cell lines expressing the 503(F\u2194Y) NPC1 mutants with authentic EBOV and rVSV-EBOV GP (Fig. 8C) . The capacities of both authentic and surrogate viruses to enter and infect these cells were fully congruent with the results of the GP-binding experiments.

Examination of these mutants by GP CL -binding ELISA revealed that binding avidity was generally correlated with amino acid size and polarity (Fig. 9A) . Specifically, residues with bulky, hydrophobic side chains (L and W) afforded GP CL -NPC1 binding at WT levels, whereas residues with polar side chains (D, H, and S) abrogated binding.

An alignment of available NPC1 domain C sequences from a panel of vertebrate species revealed that, although there exist a number of differences in amino acid sequence around residue 503, the F at this position is itself very well conserved among vertebrates, with only two NPC1 orthologs-those of the Russell's viper and king cobra (Ophiophagus hannah)-encoding a Y at this position (Fig. 10A) . Interestingly, the predicted NPC1 polypeptide sequences of two additional snakes, the Burmese python (Python bivittatus) and the common garter snake (Thamnophis sirtalis), show an F at position 503 (Fig. 10A) . To investigate the GP CL -binding capacities of the snake NPC1 orthologs, we expressed and purified soluble NPC1 domain C proteins for the king cobra and Burmese python and tested them for binding to EBOV GP CL . The capacity of these proteins to bind to EBOV GP CL was concordant with the identity of the residue at NPC1 codon 503. Thus, king cobra NPC1 domain C(Y503) resembled viper NPC1 domain C in its inability to bind to EBOV GP CL , whereas Burmese python NPC1 domain C(F503) readily bound to EBOV GP CL (Fig. 10B) . We tested two more reptilian NPC1 orthologs-from Chinese softshell turtle and Carolina anole (both carrying F503)-and found that they could all bind to EBOV GP CL (Fig. 10C) . These findings provide additional evidence that NPC1-encoded residue 503 influences the cellular host range of EBOV at the level of virus-receptor recognition and raise the possibility that sequence differences at this position influence the susceptibility of reptiles to filovirus infection in nature.",

            "text": "The essential entry receptor NPC1 is the first known molecular determinant of the cellular host range of EBOV and other filoviruses (25, 26) . In this study, we uncover one mechanism by which NPC1 imposes a species-specific barrier to EBOV infection. We show that reptilian cells derived from the Russell's viper, Daboia russellii, are largely resistant to EBOV entry and infection because of the presence of a Y residue at position 503 in NPC1, whereas the NPC1 orthologs of most other types of animals, include humans, carry a highly conserved F residue. Unexpectedly, toggling this residue between F and Y in either human or Russell's viper NPC1 backgrounds switched each protein's ability to act as an EBOV receptor. NPC1's crucial housekeeping functiondistribution of cholesterol from the endo/lysosomal compartment to other cellular membranes-remained unaffected by these changes. Thus, our work identifies a genetic determinant in NPC1 that controls its viral receptor function, and consequently host susceptibility to EBOV infection, in a manner that is selective and yet transferable between highly divergent NPC1 orthologs. The determinative F503\u00a1Y change is located in NPC1's second luminal domain (C), which directly binds to a cleaved form of the EBOV entry glycoprotein (GP CL ) during viral entry (22, 23, 26) . Here, we found that F503\u00a1Y renders cells nonpermissive to EBOV infection because it reduces the apparent binding affinity of GP CL for NPC1 domain C by more than 1,000-fold. What mechanism might account for this extraordinary effect of a single hydroxyl group on virus-receptor interaction?",

Experimental infections of wild-caught reptiles and amphibians by Swanepoel and colleagues (30) showed a general refractoriness to EBOV infection or replication, but minimal titers were recovered on a few occasions from the brown house snake (Lamprophis fuliginosus). Following outbreaks of the Ebola virus relative Marburg virus (MARV) at the mine in Kitaka Cave, the nearby \"Python Cave\" in Queen Elizabeth National Park in Uganda (32, 33) , and the Goroumbwa Mine in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (31), a number of Egyptian fruit bats were found to be infected with MARV (5, 6, 24, 34) . Unfortunately, though the African rock python (Python sebae) and forest cobra (Naja Melanoleuca) are part of the fauna in these locations, there were no reports on investigations of snakes from these caves for filovirus infection (6, 22, 31) . Nevertheless, our finding that two snake NPC1 orthologs are nonpermissive to filovirus entry and infection due to a single amino acid change leads us to speculate that this change was an adaptation to reduce infection by a filovirus, thereby increasing host survivability. More-extensive wildlife sampling coupled with genetic and functional analysis of host-virus interactions associated with filovirus infection may uncover additional evidence for evolutionary arms races between filoviruses and multiple types of animals (bats, reptiles, and rodents).",

(A) Chimeras were engineered by replacing DrNPC1 domain C sequences with human sequence 373 to 475 (chimera 1), 476 to 536 (chimera 2), or 537 to 620 (chimera 3). The chimeras were expressed in HEK 293T cells and tested for EBOV GP CL binding by ELISA. (B) Further dissection of chimera 2 was done by replacing smaller subsets of DrNPC1 with human residues 494 to 502 (chimera 4), 502 to 511 (chimera 5), and 527 to 531 (chimera 6). Chimeric NPC1 domain C proteins were tested as in panel A. \u03f73 nM [Russell's viper] versus 0.5 nM [human]). Conversely, no detectable GP CL binding was obtained with the HsNPC1(F503Y) domain C protein (EC 50 , \u03fe1 M).To examine the consequences of the 503(F\u2194Y) sequence change for the cellular and viral receptor functions of NPC1, we introduced the F503Y and Y503F mutations into full-length WT HsNPC1 and the HsNPC1-DrC chimera, respectively, and expressed them transiently in U2OS NPC1 \u03ea/\u03ea cell lines. Immunostaining of NPC1 in these cell lines revealed colocalization with LAMP1 for both WT HsNPC1 and HsNPC1-DrC(Fig. 8A and 3A). Furthermore, filipin staining showed little or no cholesterol accumulation in A single amino acid change renders DrNPC1 domain C fully competent to bind EBOV GP CL . Chimera 5 contains 6 amino acid differences between DrNPC1 and HsNPC1 domain C. The following point mutations were made in the DrNPC1 domain C by switching the viper amino acid residue at each of these positions to the corresponding human residue: E502D, Y503F, I505V, H506Y, F509Y, and S511T. The point mutants were expressed in HEK 293T cells and tested for EBOV GP CL binding by ELISA. NPC1 residue 503 bidirectionally alters domain C's capacity to bind EBOV GP CL . (A) HsNPC1 and DrNPC1 domain C proteins bearing point mutations at residue 503 (HsNPC1, F503Y; DrNPC1, Y503F) were expressed and purified. (B) Serial dilutions of equivalent amounts of purified NPC1 domain C proteins were tested for EBOV GP CL binding by ELISA. Residue 503 influences the capacity of full-length NPC1 to support EBOV entry and infection. (A) Point mutations at residue 503 were introduced into HsNPC1 and the chimera HsNPC1-DrC (F503Y and Y503F, respectively), and these constructs were transiently expressed in U2OS NPC1 \u060a/\u060a cells. NPC1 (red) and a lysosomal marker, LAMP1 (green), were visualized by immunofluorescence microscopy.
