We link a deterministic zonal ventilation model for the airborne distribution of infectious material in a hospital ward, with a Markovian multicompartment SIS model for the infection of individuals within this ward, in order to conduct a parametric study on ventilation rates and their effect on the epidemic dynamics. Our stochastic model includes arrival and discharge of patients, as well as the detection of the outbreak by screening events or due to symptoms being shown by infective patients. For each ventilation setting, we measure the infectious potential of a nosocomial outbreak in the hospital ward by means of a summary statistic: the number of infections occurred within the hospital ward until end or declaration of the outbreak. We analytically compute the distribution of this summary statistic, and carry out local and global sensitivity analysis in order to identify the particular characteristics of each ventilation regime with the largest impact on the epidemic spread. Our results show that ward ventilation can have a significant impact on the infection spread, especially under slow detection scenarios or in overoccupied wards, and that decreasing the infection risk for the whole hospital ward might increase the risk in specific areas of the health-care facility. Moreover, the location of the initial infective individual and the protocol in place for outbreak declaration both form an interplay with ventilation of the ward.",

While the transmission routes for some diseases are well documented, the precise mode of transmission is uncertain for many infections, particularly for those pathogens that cause health-care-acquired infections (HCAIs). Although it is probable that the majority of transmission occurs via contact routes (Sax et al., 2009) , there is increasing recognition that the air plays an important role in disease spread (Li et al., 2007) . Understanding the role that ventilation airflow plays in the dispersion of infectious microorganisms is tantamount to assessing exposure to pathogens and hence infection risk. This study aims to provide an analytical link between airborne hospital infection spread, ventilation design, and outbreak management.",

Liao, Chang, and Liang (2005) presented a probabilistic transmission dynamic model to assess indoor airborne infection risks and Ko, Burge, Nardell, and Thompson (2001) and Ko, Thompson, and Nardell (2004) developed models for tuberculosis spread incorporating a zonal ventilation model. A number of authors have also looked at control strategies, including Wein and Atkinson (2009) , who modeled infection control measures for pandemic influenza; Brienen, Timen, Wallinga, Van Steenbergen, and Teunis (2010) , who analyzed the effect of mask use on the spread of influenza; and King, Noakes, and Sleigh (2015) , who developed a stochastic model to link airborne and contact transmission. It is also worth mentioning the recent work by Carruthers et al. (2018) , where a zonal ventilation model similar to the one considered in this article is linked to a dose-response approach to estimate the risk of infection after an accidental release of bacteria Francisella tularensis in a microbiology laboratory.",

This can be expressed in terms of a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) {S(t) : t \u2265 0}, where the random variable S(t) represents the number of susceptible individuals at time t, and the aim is to compute transient probabilities p S (t) = P(S(t) = S) for any S \u2208 = {0, 1, . . . , N}, where N is the number of individuals in the population. These probabilities satisfy the Kolmogorov differential equations:",

By assuming steady-state conditions for airflow, and taking into account Equation (2), Noakes and Sleigh (2009) propose to link infection rates \u03bb j , j \u2208 {1, . . . , M} with the ventilation matrix V as follows: \u239b (3)) that takes into account the ventilation distribution through matrix V. Once this procedure for computing infection rates is proposed, stochastic simulations for the SI epidemic dynamics are carried out in Noakes and Sleigh (2009) by following steps (i)-(iv) (Noakes & Sleigh, 2009 ), which assume exponentially distributed interevent times and make use of the property depicted in Equation (1). We note here that Equation (3) means considering per capita infection rates at each zone 1 \u2264 j \u2264 M as functions \u03bb j (i 1 , . . . , i M ) of the number of infectives (i 1 , . . . , i M ) within each ventilation zone at the hospital ward. In Section 2.2, we now go on to exploit this, to link the zonal ventilation model with a multicompartment SI S model with detection, to evaluate the infection spread dynamics within the hospital ward until detection of the outbreak. Instead of carrying out stochastic simulations, we present an exact approach for analyzing a summary statistic of the outbreak: the total number of infections occurring until the outbreak ends or is detected and declared. This exact approach does not only allow us to compute this quantity of interest, but it also allows one to carry out a sensitivity analysis on the model parameters, so that the impact that different characteristics of the ventilation setting has on this summary statistic can be evaluated.",

On the other hand, ventilation setting D represents a well-mixed ward (\u03b2 Qi k = 0 for all i and k) with no extract ventilation at zone 1b (Q o,1b = 0), which might favor the spread of pathogens from 1a toward other zones within the ward, leading to more infections occurring until outbreak detection.

It is also clear that the average individual detection time \u03b4 \u22121 has a higher impact on the infection spread than the specific ventilation setting in the ward, so that outbreak detection seems to dominate ventilation regarding infection spread.",

Corresponding mean values E[R] are reported in Table IV . We note that zones 3a and 3b are equivalent to zones 1a and 1b, for all ventilation settings in Fig. 2 , and thus we do not test them. For zones near the corridor (i.e., 1b and 2b), ventilation setting B is identified as the best one, while D is identified as the worst one. We note that ventilation setting B has no extract ventilation in zones 1b and 2b (Q o,1b = Q o,2b = 0), but it directs the airflow instead toward corridor areas. In this setting B, corridor areas have no patients and significant ventilation, with airflow unbalance from bays to corridor areas acting in practice as an infection control measure. Thus, our results suggest that the spread control ability of a given ventilation setting depends on the location of the patient starting the outbreak as well as the airflow direction. However, from results in Fig. 4 and Table IV , ventilation setting D seems to perform poorly regardless of the initial infective location, suggesting that some ventilation settings might be inadvisable regardless of this location (i.e., if this location is unknown).

For zone 1a, values of E[R] are larger in Table X than in Table III ; if the nosocomial outbreak is initiated by an infective patient in zone 1a, more infections during this outbreak should be expected under ward overoccupancy. This might not be only related to having more patients in the ward under overoccupancy (21 instead of 18), but also to the potential of patients in the corridor to act as infection links between bays. For example, under overoccupancy, an infective individual in zone 1a might infect individuals in bay 2 by, as a first step, infecting individuals in the corridor areas. These people then might more easily infect individuals in bay 2, before being discharged, due to being in closer proximity and depending on the particular ventilation setting in place in the ward. Infection dynamics related to the scenario above highly depend on the particular ventilation setting under study, which can be noticed by inspecting rows corresponding to zones {c1, c2, c3} in Table X . While an individual in zone 1a has a larger infectious potential (in terms of E[R]) than individuals located in the corridor when ventilation settings B and E are in place, this is not the case for ventilation settings C, D, and F, and these infectious potentials are comparable under ventilation setting A, which represents a well-mixed scenario. Our results then indicate that overoccupancy leads in general to higher airborne spread risks, and that this increase can be especially significant depending on the specific ventilation in place.",

We perform a parametric analysis by varying q to assess the sensitivity of our conclusions, and report expected infections E[R] until the end of the outbreak in Table XI . In particular, we are interested in the mean number E[R] of infections if the outbreak is detected on the first patient showing symptoms, each patient showing symptoms after an average time \u03b4 \u22121 = 12 h, and where we consider \u03b2 0 = 9 m 3 /min. We note that, as expected, increasing values of q lead to increasing mean number E[R] of infections. However, this does not seem to affect the relative infectiousness of ventilation setting C, which is identified as the best scenario regardless of the value of q. On the other hand, less advantageous ventilation schemes are dependent on the value of q. For example, ventilation setting A and E can be identified as the worst for q = 0.1 quanta/min, while setting D can be seen as the worst one for q = 50.0 quanta/min.",

The interplay between ventilation of the hospital ward and location of the initially infective patient starting the outbreak implies that recommendations on where to locate potentially infected (e.g., newly admitted) patients in a given hospital ward could be issued depending on the ventilation in place in the ward.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that this link is carried out by defining in detail the CTMC for the infection spread, where infection rates at each ventilation zone are in fact functions \u03bb j (i 1 , . . . , i M ) of the number of infectives in each zone at any given time, and where (i 1 , . . . , i M ) represents in fact a state of the CTMC under study.

The model is applied to a hypothetical hospital ward, which, while it is representative of multibed ward environments in many hospitals, is a very simplified model of reality. The results demonstrate that the ventilation flow settings may influence the dispersion of airborne pathogens and hence the risk of transmission; however, these should be interpreted with caution. We assume a steady-state ventilation scenario with the flow pattern replicated exactly between neighboring bays 1, 2, and 3. In reality, the flows will not be exactly identical for every bay, and other factors such as heat sources and movement of people will alter the mixing with and between zones. In particular, corridor ventilation often has a directional flow due to wider spacing of ventilation supply/extract grilles, which may hinder or improve the control of infection. However, the analysis we have carried out gives some clear insight into why particular directional flows influence risk, and the relative importance of detection strategies, ventilation control, and occupancy.",

This is similar to the model recently proposed by L\u00f3pez-Garc\u00eda and Kypraios (2018), as a unified framework for modeling the spread of nosocomial infections. We note that this epidemic model structure would be especially relevant for pathogens with no or short (i.e., negligible compared to the average patient's LOS) noninfectious or latent periods, and where the infectious period is long enough so that recovery of patients does not occur before discharge (or detection). Depending on the hospital ward under analysis and the average LOS of patients in this ward, this could be the case for influenza or norovirus. Pathogens with nonnegligible incubation periods (e.g., 7-21 days for measles) might require more complex stochastic epidemic model structures such as the SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infective-recovered). On the other hand, when analyzing hospital wards with longer average patient LOS, so that individuals may become infected and recover during their stay, SIRS-type epidemic models would be required to represent the recovery of patients (I \u2192 R) before discharge (R \u2192 S) occurs. We note here that in principle, the methodology outlined in Section 3 can be extended to any of these compartmental-based epidemic models for the disease spread dynamics, where the link between the deterministic zonal ventilation model for the airflow dynamics and the stochastic epidemic model for disease spread dynamics would still be as in Section 2. In a similar way, more complex epidemic model structures could allow one to study the infection spread dynamics after outbreak detection and declaration occurs. In this article, we have focused instead on the impact of ventilation on disease spread until the end or declaration of the outbreak. Considering these alternative compartmental-based epidemic model structures could be the aim of future work.",

These equations are obtained by following a first-step argument, and applying the total probability law regarding the following event occurring in the stochastic process. In particular, let us denote by (i 1 , i 2 , . . . , i j , . . . , i M ) \u2192 (i 1 , i 2 , . . . , i j + 1, . . . , i M ) the event representing that, if the process is initially at state (i 1 , i 2 , . . . , i j , . . . , i M ), it moves to state (i 1 , i 2 , . . . , i j + 1, . . . , i M ) in the next jump (i.e., that we have (i 1 , i 2 , . . . , i j , . . . , i M ) infectives within the hospital ward at current time, and the next event that occurs is an infection in zone j). From the theory of CTMCs, it is well known that the probability of this event occurring is: ; that is, it is equal to the ratio between the rate corresponding to this event and the sum of all the rates corresponding to all the possible events that can actually occur (infection in any zone, discharge in any zone, or detection of an infective individual in any zone). The same argument applies to any other possible event, so that P((i 1 , i 2 , . . . , i j , . . . , i M ) \u2192 (i 1 , i 2 , . . . , i j \u2212 1, . . . , i M )) is given by",
