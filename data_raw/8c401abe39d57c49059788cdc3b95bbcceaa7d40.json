Clostridium perfringens type A was identified via fecal culture and toxin genotyping. Hemorrhagic bowel syndrome (HBS) was diagnosed based on microbiological results along with abdominal ultrasonography, complete blood count, and serum biochemistry. Aggressive multi-modal therapy was employed including intravenously administered fluid therapy, potassium penicillin, lidocaine, flunixin, and pantoprazole among other supportive care. e bull was discharged a er 15 days of hospitalization and recovered uneventfully to full function by the next breeding season. Currently all case reports with regard to HBS in beef cattle describe mortality. While the dairy cattle literature demonstrates that HBS has a high mortality rate, and suggests that surgical intervention has a higher prognosis when compared to medical therapy in dairy cattle. Our case would provide support to aggressive medical treatment for HBS in beef cattle.",

A recent report cited improved survival of surgical cases that utilized manual clot dissolution (4/4) compared to enterotomy (2/6) or resection and anastomosis (1/3) [2] . Several reports note that early surgical intervention can be effective, and factors associated with poor prognosis include puncture of the bowel during manipulation and the involvement of multiple sites within the jejunum and ileum [3] . While descriptions of HBS in the literature are predominantly dairy cattle, there are several cases in beef cattle reported in the literature. ese cases range from acute presentation of sudden death [4] to unsuccessful treatment via medical management and surgical clot manipulation [2] .",

Pantoprazole functions as a proton pump inhibitor which increases gastric pH via bonding with the hydrogen-potassium ATP-ase pump on the secretory surface of gastric parietal cells. It is routinely used in canine and feline practice, and its use has been described for foals [15] . In alpacas [16] , pantoprazole has been shown to increase third compartment pH when given at a dose of 1 mg/kg intravenously or 2 mg/kg subcutaneously. Among other ruminant species there are cases reporting the use of pantoprazole in a goat and a yak [6, 17] . Reported complications associated with pantoprazole in people include hyponatremia in hospitalized patients as well as neutropenia and thrombocytopenia with long-term use [18, 19] . e bull in this case did not display neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, or hyponatremia a er commencement of pantoprazole therapy. Based on this case and other ruminant cases, pantoprazole may be a safe short-term therapy for protection of the gastrointestinal tract. e safe treatment duration of pantoprazole in cattle is unknown at this time, as increasing the abomasal pH for extended periods of time may lead to the growth of enteropathogenic bacteria. Multiple drugs in this case report, including pantoprazole, were used in an extralabel fashion. Practitioners should be aware that due to regulatory differences, extralabel use of pantoprazole may not be permissible in all countries.",

Our findings suggest that aggressive multimodal medical therapy may be key to successful medical treatment of this condition in beef cattle. e current use of intravenous lidocaine by constant rate infusion in large animal medicine is primarily an equine treatment modality for postoperative ileus. In an equine model of ischemia and reperfusion, lidocaine was found to increase the frequency of contraction of jejunal segments in the control and experimental group both in vivo and in vitro [7, 8] . It is debated whether intravenous lidocaine improves intestinal motility by anti-inflammatory or prokinetic effects [9] . In a study of 126 horses undergoing colic surgery, there was a reduction in the development of postoperative ileus in horses that received lidocaine, and this group was 3.3 times more IM) [1, 3] , ce iofur sodium (2.2 mg/kg, IM or IV) [1] , cefazolin (dose unknown, IV) [20] , oxytetracycline (10 mg/kg, IV) [1, 2] , or trimethoprim sulfadoxine (16 mg/kg, IV) [2] . e bull in this case report was initially treated with IV penicillin G potassium, and then transitioned to IM ampicillin when clinical signs improved and the IV catheter was removed. At the time of this publication, this is the first report to use penicillin G potassium (22,000 IU/kg IV every 6 hours) for the treatment of HBS, potentially indicating that aggressive multimodal therapy combined with intravenous antimicrobial therapy may be beneficial for HBS. e present report describes a novel medical management plan for the treatment of HBS in a beef bull, including the use of intravenous fluids, penicillin G potassium, lidocaine, and pantoprazole. Further, this report provides evidence that pantoprazole may be safely tolerated by beef bulls. Future research is necessary to establish safe protocols for the use of lidocaine and pantoprazole in cattle, as well as to determine withdraw recommendations for the use of these drugs in cattle.",
