            "text": "Despite the recent emergence of enterovirus D68 (EV-D68), its clinical impact on adult population is less well defined. To better define the epidemiology of EV-D68, 6,800 nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) from 2010-2014 were subject to EV-D68 detection by RT-PCR and sequencing of 5\u2032UTR and partial VP1. EV-D68 was detected in 30 (0.44%) NPAs from 22 children and 8 adults/elderlies. Sixteen patients (including five elderly) (53%) had pneumonia and 13 (43%) patients were complicated by small airway disease exacerbation. Phylogenetic analysis of VP1, 2C and 3D regions showed four distinct lineages of EV-D68, clade A1, A2, B1 and B3, with adults/elderlies exclusively infected by clade A2. The potentially new clade, B3, has emerged in 2014, while strains closely related to recently emerged B1 strains in the United States were also detected as early as 2011 in Hong Kong. The four lineages possessed distinct aa sequence patterns in BC and DE loops. Amino acid residues 97 and 140, within BC and DE-surface loops of VP1 respectively, were under potential positive selection. EV-D68 infections in Hong Kong usually peak in spring/summer, though with a delayed autumn/winter peak in 2011. This report suggests that EV-D68 may cause severe respiratory illness in adults/elderlies with underlying co-morbidities.",

EV-D68 mainly affects infants, children and adolescents, while infections in adults were less commonly reported. Clinical manifestations of EV-D68 infections mainly resemble influenza-like illness, but life-threatening infections were also reported 16, [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] . Neurological involvement, ranging from encephalomyelitis to acute flaccid paralysis, was rare, although a recent report highlighted possible association with acute flaccid myelitis 16, 32, 33 . Based on sequences of the viral capsid gene VP1, EV-D68 strains are often categorized into 3 distinct genetic groups, clade A to C, in addition to the original Fermon lineage 29, 33 .",

In US, only 26 cases of EV-D68 infections were detected by passive EV surveillance from 1970 to 2005 34 . However, increasing reports of EV-D68 infections have recently been noted in various countries from Africa, America, Asia and Europe [27] [28] [29] 31, [35] [36] [37] . Since August 2014, more than 1000 cases of EV-D68 have been reported in the United States (US), with at least 14 potentially fatal cases 31 . In Hong Kong, unlike EV-A71 infection which is a notifiable disease, the prevalence of EV-D68 was largely unknown. However, a fatal case of EV-D68 was recently reported in a 10-year-old boy who presented with respiratory symptoms and complicated by encephalitis (http://www. chp.gov.hk/en/view_content/36405.html). To better define the disease impact and clinical spectrum of EV-D68, we examined the clinical and molecular epidemiology of EV-D68 among hospitalized patients with suspected respiratory virus infections in Hong Kong. The partial VP1, 2C and 3D genes of EV-D68 strains were sequenced to study the genetic diversity and evolutionary dynamics.",

Exacerbations of small airway diseases were common, including asthmatic attacks (n = 13), febrile wheeze (n = 2) and exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (n = 2). Five patients (17%) presented with upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), including a 63-year-old elderly (patient 21) who was complicated by acute coronary syndrome and shock. Another 2-year-old girl (patient 2) with acute bronchiolitis was complicated by intestinal obstruction. All patients recovered. Except for a 6-year-old girl (patient 29) with influenza C virus co-infection, no respiratory viruses or bacteria were identified from other patients.",

Phylogenetic analysis of partial VP1, 2C and 3D regions showed that the 30 EV-D68 strains fell into two major clades, clades A and B, corresponding to the two of the three EV-D68 clades described previously ( Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 1) 33, 35 . Previous studies have also revealed further subgroups, such as clade B1 and B2 among strains recently emerged in US 30, 33, 38 . Upon VP1 analysis, 15 strains belonged to clade B, some of which being closely related to recent B1 strains from US. Five strains detected in 2014 form a potentially new clade, B3, together with strains from Taiwan and mainland China. The other 15 strains belonged to clade A, which can be further divided into two subclades, A1 (n = 2) and A2 (n = 13). Analysis of 2C and 3D sequences showed similar clustering ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ). The four circulating lineages, clade A1, A2, B1 and B3, shared \u2265 91.8% aa identities to each other in partial VP1 and displayed distinct amino acid polymorphisms in VP1, 2C and 3D (Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Fig. 2) .",

In contrast to paediatric population, the role of EV-D68 in adult infections was less clear with only scarce reports. In the Netherlands, EV-D68-related respiratory illness has been described in adults but without clinical details 27, 29 . Two reports from China have identified 13 and two adults respectively with URTIs due to EV-D68 28, 39 . A recent report from Denmark identified EV-D68 infections in two adults with URTIs and one adult co-infected by RV with fever, cough and breathing difficulties 30 . In this study, only one elderly presented with URTI alone, while another elderly with URTI was complicated by acute coronary syndrome. The other five elderlies presented with pneumonia, with two having respiratory or cardiac complications. Another 37-year-old adult also presented with pneumonia. Our findings suggested that EV-D68 can cause severe infections in adults or elderlies with underlying diseases. The EV-D68 infections in adults or elderlies may be underdiagnosed. The conserved 5\u2032 UTR is a common target for initial RT-PCR detection of EVs, while specific diagnosis of EV-D68 usually relies on specific RT-PCR assays or VP1 sequencing. In particular, a number of EV-D68 specific diagnostic tools based on real-time PCR assays have been developed recently [40] [41] [42] . Although commercially available multiplex PCR assays may include EV-D68, they may lack sensitivity and specificity, and may not differentiate EV-D68 from RVs 42 . Moreover, EV-D68 is seldom included in diagnostic panels for respiratory viruses, while most surveillance programs for EVs focus on stool samples. Inclusion of EV-D68 in routine respiratory virus panels may also help better assess its clinical and public health significance.",

The steady annual incidence observed suggested that EV-D68 has been circulating for at least several years. Unlike EV-A71 with seasonal peaks during summer/fall, as many as 50% of EV-D68 infections may fall outside usual EV peak seasons 34, 43, 44 . EV-D68 appears to peak during spring/summer in our population, while a delayed autumn/winter peak was observed in 2011. Therefore, factors other than temperature may also play a role in the seasonality of EV-D68 infection. Lower respiratory illness was common among both elderlies and children, with pneumonia being the most common diagnosis. Many patients were also complicated by exacerbation of small airway disease, in line with the disproportionate presence of asthma among cases in US 45 . Interestingly, a 2-year-old girl (patient 1) had hand-foot-mouth disease which has not been previously reported for EV-D68, although the possibility of co-infection by other EVs cannot be excluded. However, given the limited number of positive samples in this study, further epidemiology studies with inclusion of more cases are required to assess the seasonality, epidemiology and disease impact of EV-D68 in our population. Our results revealed four lineages of EV-D68, A1, A2, B1 and B3, having circulated in our population and the potential emergence of a new subclade B3 in 2014. Moreover, adults/elderlies were infected exclusively by clade A2, suggesting that this lineage may be emerging in our elderly population. The recent emergence of EV-D68 in different countries may be due to viral evolution of strains/lineages with different antigenicity, with major bifurcation of currently circulating EV-D68 strains dated back to around 1945 33, 35, 39 . The aa sequence patterns in BC and DE-surface loops, which determine the antigenic epitopes, may correlate with lineage classification 35 . The four lineages in this study also possessed distinct aa sequence patterns in BC and DE loops ( Supplementary  Fig. 2a) . Moreover, most B strains circulating in 2014 formed a new separate subclade, B3, only distantly related to recent B1 sand B2 trains from US. Other potential B3 strains were also detected in Beijing and Taiwan in 2014 (Fig. 2) . On the other hand, some of our B strains detected as early as 2011 were closely related to B1 strains from US. Our findings suggested that the recent epidemic in US may have originated from strains circulating in Asia several years ago, while a new lineage, B3, has only recently emerged in Hong Kong and neighbouring regions. More sequence data are needed to understand the genetic changes that may have driven the emergence of new lineages of EV-D68.",

In contrast to most EVs with enteric tropism, EV-D68 is seldom detected from stool of infected patients. Although EV-D68 possessed some properties of RVs, it does not utilize the receptors of RVs, namely intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) or low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R) 46, 47 . Instead, it shares the same receptor, decay accelerating factor (DAF), with EV-D70 and several echovirus serotypes 25, 48, 49 . Interestingly, both EV-D68 and EV-D70 belong to the species EV-D, although EV-D70 is mainly associated with acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis 19 . In addition, EV-D68 may use sialic acids as receptor, with preferential binding \u03b1 2-6-linked sialic acids (\u03b1 2-6 SAs) than to \u03b1 2-3 SAs, which may suggest higher affinity for upper respiratory epithelium 47, 50 .

The number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site, d S , and non-synonymous substitutions per non-synonymous site, d N , in VP1 were calculated using Nei-Gojobori method (Jukes-Cantor) in MEGA5. Sites under positive selection were inferred using single-likelihood ancestor counting (SLAC) and fixed effects likelihood (FEL) methods as implemented in DataMonkey server (http://www.datamonkey.org). The overall \u03c9 (d N /d S ) value was calculated according to NJ trees under the TrN93 substitution model. Positive selection for a site was considered to be statistically significant if P-value was < 0.1. A mixed-effects model of evolution (MEME) was further used to identify positively selected sites under episodic diversifying selection in particular positions among different clades within a phylogenetic tree even when positive selection is not evident across the entire tree. The relative residue abundance within BC and DE-surface exposed loops were depicted using WebLogo.",
