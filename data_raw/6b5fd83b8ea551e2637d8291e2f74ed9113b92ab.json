These blood ions that are normally dissolved in the real human blood stream are essential for cell metabolisms and homeostasis in the human body. Abnormal concentration of blood ions causes many serious disorders. The optimized microfluidic device working without any external power source can directly and effectively separate human blood components, and subsequently detect a specific blood ion with minimized interference. The measured sensitivity to Cl \u2212 , K + , Na + , and Ca 2+ are \u221247.71, 45.97, 51.06, and 19.46 in mV decade \u22121 , respectively. Potentiometric responses of the microfluidic devices to blood serum samples are in the normal ranges of each cation, and comparable with responses from the commercial blood ion analyzer Abbott i-Stat.",

Optimization and characterization of the wax patterns are conducted in terms of potentiometric sensitivity and response time. The major human blood ions, including Cl \u2212 , K + , Na + , and Ca 2+ , are physiological indices as indicators of human body disorders. Thus, an accurate determination of blood ions is of great importance to assess whether numerous metabolisms and homeostasis in the human body are working correctly.",

Additionally, potassium ionophore I (Sigma-Aldrich, Milwaukee, WI, USA) for K + , 4-tert-butylcalix [4] arenetetraacetic acid tetraethyl ester (Sigma-Aldrich, Milwaukee, WI, USA) for Na + , and N,N,N ,N -tetracyclohexyl-3-oxapentan ediamide (Sigma-Aldrich, Milwaukee, WI, USA) for Ca 2+ are employed as additives, which enable the selective detection of blood ions. Some representative ion-selective electrode materials have been reported [13] . Each solution mixture to prepare the functional film is dried for 24 h under atmospheric condition at room temperature, after adding volatile tetrahydrofuran (Sigma-Aldrich, Milwaukee, WI, USA) for better homogeneity of the products. Table S1 lists the actual compositions of the solution mixtures. Figure 2a -c show the wax-patterned paper sheets employed in this work. One is to prepare paper channels, another one for reference and sensing electrode wells, and the other one for salt bridges connecting each reference and corresponding sensing electrode pairs, respectively. Note that waxed areas are shown in black. Four reference electrode areas that are supposed to be soaked with different composition of solutions are isolated from each other and from the sensing electrodes area. Sample solution for sensing electrodes may be dropped down right above the center circle and flowing through the assigned paper-based microchannels. To create the paper channels, the solid wax-patterned Whatman filter paper (grade 1, 180 \u00b5m, GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA) is treated at 130 \u2022 C for 45 s, allowing the melted wax to penetrate deep inside the porous cellulose paper by capillary action. Biocompatible solid wax patterning of the paper is performed with a laser printer (Fuji Xerox, Tokyo, Japan). Each electrode well has the same size (4.5 \u00d7 4.5 mm), except the sensing electrode well (2 \u00d7 2 mm) for the detection of chloride ion, which does not need any ion permeable membrane. The reduced well size slows down the fluid flowing speed in the chloride ion sensing channel to be similar with the flowing speeds in the other channels. Note that detection of K + , Na + , and Ca 2+ ions requires specific ion-permeable membranes, which commonly hinder the free movement of solutions in the channel. The hydrophobic wall-mounted paper electrode substrate by wax printing is combined with one-sided or double-sided adhesive poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET, Copierland, Seoul, Korea) films. Figure 2d ,e show the top and the second top PET cover films. The top layer has five round shaped holes: one for loading a sample solution (~150 \u00b5L); the others for loading reference solutions (~50 \u00b5L each). Four rectangularly shaped holes are prepared for electrical connection to external circuits. The second layer is engraved with the same patterns of the underneath wax-patterned paper and superimposed on the paper layer. By combining with the top layer, the second layer provides a small volume of empty space right above the paper channel, which enables faster transfer rates of reference and sensing solutions. Note that punching of the PET film is performed with a laser cutter (Silhouette, Orem, UT, USA). Figure 3 shows the configuration of a multi-layered paper microfluidic electrochemical device composed of three paper and three PET layers, and the real photo image. Ion selective membranes are embedded between paper layers. Ag/AgCl electrode probes that should be positioned on each reference and sensing electrode wells are prepared by screen-printing Ag/AgCl ink (Ag:AgCl = 50:50 in weight, Gwent, Pontypool, UK) and subsequently heat-cured at 90 \u2022 C for 6 min to dry. Paper channels are then oxygen plasma treated to enhance the surface hydrophilicity. Zero current potentials for each reference and sensing electrode pairs are measured using a digital voltmeter (Keithley, Solon, OH, USA).

This means that the pressure force of a sample solution loaded through the triangle inlet acting on unit surface area is larger than the others, assuming a constant sample volume. Therefore, it is possible to obtain a higher fluid flow rate with the triangle inlet and a higher Reynolds number (Re), which is defined as Re = (D H \u03c1v)/\u00b5, where v is the fluid velocity (m s \u22121 ), and \u03c1 and \u00b5 are the density (kg m \u22123 ) and viscosity (kg m \u22121 s \u22121 ) of the fluid, respectively. However, a turbulent flow in a microchannel is unobtainable, because typically the flow within such a small channel restricts Reynolds numbers to between 10 \u22125 and 10 \u22123 , so a laminar flow may govern the entire fluid flow [14] .

In this work, the salt bridge area acts not only as the electrical connector but also as an actual mixing area for loaded solutions coming from both solution inlets. This means that a thick diffusion layer will be formed in the mixing channel, and the steeper concentration gradient commonly observed with a wider mixing area will show higher zero current potential.

According to the Washburn equation (L 2 = (\u03b3Dt)/(4\u03bd), where L, \u03b3, D, t, and \u03bd represent the penetration length, surface tension, mean pore diameter, penetration time, and dynamic viscosity, respectively), L = 0.83 mm would be returned if human blood serum were flowed through a porous paper medium at 130 \u2022 C for 6 min [15] . However, a much longer diffusion length of 1.09 mm can be observed in a circular diffusion because of the concentration gradient that is steeper than that in a planar diffusion.

Excessive diffusion, either by over heating or by allowing a long duration, can affect the zero current potential output from the device.

In this work, the zero current voltage output is recorded with an oscilloscope for 10 min, and the maximum voltage during that period of time is selected to be representative of the concentration of a target ion. Commonly, response times to all target ions are within 30 s. Figure 4a shows calibration curves of the paper microfluidic device to chloride, potassium, sodium, and calcium ions, where the zero current potentials are recorded as a function of ion concentrations. While the reference solution for Cl \u2212 detection is 1 M KCl, the concentration of KCl in the sensing solution varies from 0.01 to 1 M. The sensitivity of chloride anion is \u221247.71 mV decade \u22121 (R 2 = 0.9968), 21.6% less than the theoretical 59.2 mV decade \u22121 that is probably due to the distorted electrochemical behavior of the screen-printed Ag/AgCl electrode. The Ag/AgCl electrode is prepared by heat curing of the screen-printed silver ink and low purity of the screen-printed silver causes the sensitivities to be lower than that expected by the Nernst equation. The deviation becomes smaller as the ion concentrations near the two Ag/AgCl electrodes come closer [12] . The available detection range of chloride anion is relatively small as compared with previous data [19] . However, the calibration curve shows a short response time and a linear response in the range. For the calibration of potassium, 10 \u22123 M KCl is used as the reference solution, and the linear concentration range of KCl in the sensing solution is between 10 \u22123 and 1 M. The measured potentiometric sensitivity to K + is 45.97 mV decade \u22121 (R 2 = 0.9973), 22.3% less than the theoretical value. In the case of sodium, the reference solution is 1 M NaCl, and the linear concentration range of NaCl in the sensing solution is between 10 \u22123 and 1 M. The measured response to sodium ion is 51.06 mV decade \u22121 (R 2 = 0.9912), 13.7% less than the theoretical value. The sensitivity of the device to calcium cation is 19.46 mV decade \u22121 (R 2 = 0.9916) in a linear range between 10 \u22123 and 10 \u22121 M of CaCl 2 , which is 34.1% smaller than the theoretical value. Note that the calcium ion is a doubly charged cation, and the theoretical zero current potential increases 29.6 mV per decade concentration increase of Ca 2+ . The paper device presented in this work shows a wide linear detection range available for the direct analysis of physiologic human blood ions, because the normal concentration ranges of Cl \u2212 , K + , Na + , and Ca 2+ in human serum samples are 98~109 mM, 3.5~4.9 mM, 138~146 mM, and 1.12~1.32 mM, respectively [20] . The small fitting deviation (Figure 4b) indicates that the device presented in this work is carefully optimized and reproducible to analyze blood ions. Figure 5 shows a practical application of the paper device to unknown serum samples. Normal serum samples from human blood were supported by the Seegene Medical Foundation (Seoul, Korea). Each blood ion concentration was determined 10 times by 10 different devices, and with the exception of the maximum and minimum numbers, and the resulting eight numbers were averaged. The reference solutions for Cl \u2212 , K + , Na + , and Ca 2+ were 1 M KCl, 10 \u22123 M KCl, 10 \u22121 M NaCl, and 10 \u22122 M CaCl 2 , respectively. The results show that the output data from the paper devices are in the normal ranges of each cation and even comparable to the commercially available clinical data that are obtained from i-Stat (Abbott, Lake Bluff, IL, USA). However, the potentiometric signal output of the device for human serum ions is not exactly the same as that determined by commercial clinical equipment. This means that a correlation curve is needed for connecting the two measurement systems. The discrepancy shown in these two systems is basically due to insufficient filtration of blood samples prior to use of the paper device. Real blood requires complicated routine filtration or prefiltration steps to eliminate numerous biomacromolecules and blood cells to minimize interfering effects. potential difference between two different electrolyte solutions with different ionic strength. In this work, the zero current voltage output is recorded with an oscilloscope for 10 min, and the maximum voltage during that period of time is selected to be representative of the concentration of a target ion. Commonly, response times to all target ions are within 30 s. Figure 4a shows calibration curves of the paper microfluidic device to chloride, potassium, sodium, and calcium ions, where the zero current potentials are recorded as a function of ion concentrations. While the reference solution for Cl \u2212 detection is 1 M KCl, the concentration of KCl in the sensing solution varies from 0.01 to 1 M. The sensitivity of chloride anion is \u221247.71 mV decade \u22121 (R 2 = 0.9968), 21.6% less than the theoretical 59.2 mV decade \u22121 that is probably due to the distorted electrochemical behavior of the screen-printed Ag/AgCl electrode. The Ag/AgCl electrode is prepared by heat curing of the screen-printed silver ink and low purity of the screen-printed silver causes the sensitivities to be lower than that expected by the Nernst equation. The deviation becomes smaller as the ion concentrations near the two Ag/AgCl electrodes come closer [12] . The available detection range of chloride anion is relatively small as compared with previous data [19] . However, the calibration curve shows a short response time and a linear response in the range. For the calibration of potassium, 10 \u22123 M KCl is used as the reference solution, and the linear concentration range of KCl in the sensing solution is between 10 \u22123 and 1 M. The measured potentiometric sensitivity to K + is 45.97 mV decade \u22121 (R 2 = 0.9973), 22.3% less than the theoretical value. In the case of sodium, the reference solution is 1 M NaCl, and the linear concentration range of NaCl in the sensing solution is between 10 \u22123 and 1 M. The measured response to sodium ion is 51.06 mV decade \u22121 (R 2 = 0.9912), 13.7% less than the theoretical value. The sensitivity of the device to calcium cation is 19.46 mV decade \u22121 (R 2 = 0.9916) in a linear range between 10 \u22123 and 10 \u22121 M of CaCl2, which is 34.1% smaller than the theoretical value. Note that the calcium ion is a doubly charged cation, and the theoretical zero current potential increases 29.6 mV per decade concentration increase of Ca 2+ . The paper device presented in this work shows a wide linear detection range available for the direct analysis of physiologic human blood ions, because the normal concentration ranges of Cl \u2212 , K + , Na + , and Ca 2+ in human serum samples are 98~109 mM, 3.5~4.9 mM, 138~146 mM, and 1.12~1.32 mM, respectively [20] . The small fitting deviation (Figure 4b) indicates that the device presented in this work is carefully optimized and reproducible to analyze blood ions. Note that five different paper devices were used to obtain a point in calibration curves (one device can be used only one time), and the error bars were omitted for simplicity. Note that the theoretical slope for single charged ions (Cl \u2212 (black), K + (red), and Na + (blue)) is 59.2 mV decade \u22121 , while that for doubly charged ion (Ca 2+ (green)) is 29.6 mV decade \u22121 .

Each blood ion concentration was determined 10 times by 10 different devices, and with the exception of the maximum and minimum numbers, and the resulting eight numbers were averaged. The reference solutions for Cl \u2212 , K + , Na + , and Ca 2+ were 1 M KCl, 10 \u22123 M KCl, 10 \u22121 M NaCl, and 10 \u22122 M CaCl2, respectively.

The preparation of a hydrophobic channel barrier and hydrophilic treatment of the inner surface of the barrier with oxygen plasma enable volume control of a serum sample. The simple fabrication and the lack of need for an external power source for the paper device are compatible with ubiquitous point-of-care systems and availability for low budget mass production. Excellent reproducibility, the relatively precise determination of blood ion concentration via correlation curves, and the short response time of electrochemical potentiometric measurement indicate that the paper microfluidic electrochemical device has a promising future as a high-accuracy single-use biosensor for end users at any time and at any location, even though a fully working mechanism and variables including selectivity coefficients and the permeability of the membrane components in the paper device are not yet completely understood. We also believe that, because no biodegradable materials are employed for the device, the paper device will be available for many years if the paper device presented herein is offered in a lidded plastic bottle containing a water-content-controlling agent. Further works may include the preparation of a wider lineup of low-cost cation permeable films for analyzing numerous blood ions, and the correlation curve-free calibration for faster operation, which would allow for greater sensitivity and selectivity of human blood ions.",
