Higher assortativity in the contact pattern greatly increases the probability of spatial containment of the epidemic, this effect being contrasted by an increase in the social activity of adults vs. children. Heterogeneous features of the mobility network characterizing its topology and traffic flows strongly favor the invasion of the pathogen at the spatial level, as also a larger fraction of children traveling. Variations in the demographic profile and mixing habits across countries lead to heterogeneous outbreak situations. Model results are compatible with the H1N1 spatial transmission dynamics observed.",

Two aspects emerging from surveillance and serological data during the initial phase of the outbreak became strikingly clear: (i) international movements of passengers by air travel drove the spatial dissemination of the pathogen at the global level [1] [2] [3] , and (ii) initial local epidemics mainly occurred in schools [2, [4] [5] [6] [7] . Country surveillance data from summer 2009 [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] show a dramatic difference in the age distributions of imported cases and indigenous cases, with imported cases on average older than the ones generated by local transmission (see Figure 1A ). This result strengthens the previous observations and highlights the presence of an age shift between the seeding events established by travelers from affected areasmainly adultsand the local outbreaks mainly occurring among school-aged children. Travel statistics indeed confirm that the vast majority of passengers flying are aged \u226518 years (see Figure 1B) .",

Here we aim at fully addressing the interplay between the two factors emerged as empirical evidence during the initial outbreak of H1N1 pandemicnamely, age-specific seeding events and age-specific epidemic dynamicsby considering a spatially explicit model that integrates the mobility patterns of flights connecting different populated areas, as well as age-dependent travel behavior in addition to age-specific mixing. We introduce a multi-host stochastic metapopulation model that includes heterogeneous features in: the spatial structure of the population; the travel behavior of individuals depending on their age; the corresponding mixing patterns. We assume a simple two age-groups classification as this allows the analytical treatment of the model to obtain the expression of the conditions for a major epidemic in terms of the age-specific contacts and travel features. By exploring theoretical contact matrices with varying assortativity levels (i.e. within-group mixing), we assess the role of assortativity on the risk of a major epidemic and compare it to scenarios informed with estimates from the H1N1 pandemic. We find that the assortativity observed in real data tends to drive the system to extinction, and is counterbalanced by the heterogeneity of the air mobility network structure, by the travel behavior of adults and by the relative proportion of contacts established by adults, all aspects that favor the virus spread. Through a systematic exploration of the role of the various ingredients considered in the system, the presented results allow the risk assessment analysis of a specific epidemic scenario and can be extended to other infectious diseases where the population partition may play a relevant role.",

(A) Fraction of indigenous cases and of imported cases during the initial phase of the H1N1 pandemic outbreak in the [0-19] years age class, calculated from surveillance data for the following countries: The Netherlands [8] , Belgium [9] , UK [10] , France [11] , Japan [13] , Italy [12] . (B) Percentage of air-travel passengers in the younger age classes for a set of airports around the world. The age classification used by the demographic statistics vary across countries (Helsinki 1 , Finland; Teheran 3 , Iran; Los Angeles 2 , USA; Amsterdam 5 30] . Sources of the data are reported in the Additional file 1. The statistics found for Italy and Germany correspond to larger age brackets. If we rescale the data as indicated in the Demographic and travel data subsection, we obtain the following estimates for the percentage of travelers in the [0-18] years old class: 1.05% (Venice), 0.49% (Hannover), 2.31% (Frankfurt), 2.31% (Hamburg), and 2.86% (Munich). These estimated values are consistent with the data. heterogeneous, and examples range from transportation infrastructures to mobility patterns of various type [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . In the case of air travel the coupling is given by the direct flights connecting different airports and the number of passengers flying on those connections. Analyses of air transportation data have shown the presence of large variability in the number of connections per airport, and of broad fluctuations in the traffic handled by each airport or flowing on a given connection between origin and destination [15, 16] . In the Additional File we report the example of the European air transportation network [20] , showing the probability distributions of the number of connections k per airport (i.e. the subpopulation's degree) and of the flows of passengers w ij travelling between any pair of linked airports i and j. These flows can also be expressed in terms of the number of connections of the origin/destination airports, where the average weight w ij along the link connecting airports i and j is a function of their degrees k i and k j , \u2329 w ij \u232a \u221d (k i k j ) \u03b8 , with \u03b8 \u2245 0.5 in the worldwide air-transportation network [15] .

Figure 1B shows the percentage of travelers in the younger age class for a variety of sources and for different airports in various countries. If we consider a classification of the younger age group that includes individuals up to 18-21 years old (where the upper value of the range depends on the specific limits imposed by the age classification adopted by each survey), the fraction of children traveling by air is on average equal to 7%, with a maximum variation between 0.7% (observed for Teheran airport, Iran) and 9.2% (Luton airport, UK). Other statistical sources have larger age brackets, with no breakdown below 25 or 30 years old, as shown in the Figure. In these cases, we can still estimate the fraction of traveling individuals in the age class [0-18] years old, by rescaling the statistics assuming a constant ratio across countries between the percentages of travelers in the [0-18] years old and those of travelers in the [0-24] or [0-29] years old classes, as obtained from sources with a finer age classification.",

A variety of different assumptions can be done to describe the social mixing pattern, as the variables of the contact matrix of the above expression are not uniquely defined and need to be parameterized through available demographic and serologic data [23] . Here we focus our attention on assortative mixing, indicating the tendency of individuals in a given class to preferably interact with other individuals of the same class. This is indeed observed in real data where contacts patterns are found to be highly assortative with age [22, 24, 25] , with a remarkable similarity across different European countries [22] . By indicating with \u03b5 c (\u03b5 a ) the average fraction of contacts that a child (adult) establishes with an adult (child), i.e. across age groups, we can simply express p c (p a ) in terms of \u03b5 c (\u03b5 a ) as p c = 1 -\u03b5 c (p a = 1 -\u03b5 a ), thus the contact matrix can be rewritten as",

The metapopulation structure is characterized by a random connectivity pattern described by an arbitrary degree distribution P(k).

The disease dynamics is encoded in the next generation matrix R = {R ij } i.e. the average number of secondary infections in age group j generated by a single primary case in age group i in a fully susceptible population, with i, j \u2208 {c, a}. We assume that the infectious period is exponentially distributed (with average value \u03bc \u2212 1 ) and that both transmission rate and recovery rate are independent of the age group, thus neglecting agespecific susceptibility or infectiousness, as in [14] . We consider a fully susceptible population, and also the case of an age-specific prior immunity, as detailed in the next subsection. If we assume that disease transmission may only occur along the contacts captured by the matrix C = {C ij } [24, 31] , we can express the generic entry of the next generation matrix as 32, 33] with i \u2208 {a, c} and C ij the contact matrix defined in Eq. (1). In the application of the contact matrix of Eq. (3) to the metapopulation model, we assume that all parameters used to define the partition of the population into age classes are independent of spatial features, being therefore constant across subpopulations (e.g. the children population fraction of a subpopulation with degree k is given by N k,c = \u03b1N k ). Similarly, we assume that the age-specific travel behavior does not change with the subpopulation of the system. The travel behavior is thus modeled by rescaling the per-capita diffusion rates d kk ' with the corresponding age-specific probability of travel and the population sizes of the age classes. If we indicate with r the fraction of children traveling (see Table 1 ), the percapita diffusion rate for children traveling from a subpopulation with degree k to a subpopulation with degree k ', d kk 0 ;c , is expressed as",

Indeed, contact data in the UK collected during school term and school holiday periods for 2009 showed that changing mixing patterns resulted in a decrease of approximately 25% to 35% in the reproductive number of influenza during the holidays, considering physical or conversational contacts, respectively [36] . With an estimated R 0 [36] . A second reason for considering the value R 0 = 1.05, is also for testing scenarios where a higher value of R 0 may have been reduced following the application of intervention strategies that do not alter the interaction or travel behaviors of individuals, such as e.g. through vaccination or antiviral treatment. For each value of R 0 considered, the transmission rate \u03b2 is calculated from the dominant eigenvalue of the next generation matrix [38] , where we set the infectious period \u03bc \u2212 1 to 2.5 days [3] .",

Even in the occurrence of a local outbreak, given R 0 > 1, the epidemic may indeed fail to spread spatially if the mobility rate is not large enough to ensure the travel of infected individuals to other subpopulations before the end of the local outbreak, or if the amount of seeding cases is not large enough to ensure the start of an outbreak in the reached subpopulation due to local extinction events. All these processes have a clear stochastic nature and they are captured by the definition of an additional predictor of the disease dynamics, R * > 1, regulating the number of subpopulations that become infected from a single initially infected subpopulation [28, [43] [44] [45] [46] , analogously to the reproductive number R 0 at the individual level. An expression for R * has been found in the case of metapopulation epidemic models with different types of mobility processes, including homogeneous, traffic-driven, and population-driven diffusion rates [28, 46] , commuting-like processes [47, 48] and origin-destination processes with adaptive behavior [49] or heterogeneous length of stay at destination [50] . In all those cases the population is assumed to mix homogeneously and to travel according to rates that are uniform across individuals. Here we go beyond those assumptions and examine the relationship between the occurrence of a global outbreak and the agedependent transmission dynamics coupled with the age-specific travel behavior, through the calculation of the global invasion threshold R * .",

Otherwise, the system has solutions (\u03c0 c , \u03c0 a ) in the range [0,1], as shown in Figure 3B . All countries (except Belgium) display a larger probability of extinction related to the introduction of a single adult case in the population, with respect to the introduction of a single infectious child. Given the mixing patterns, children are therefore more likely to start an outbreak than adults. \u03c0 a ranges between 96.5% in the case of Italy and 99% in the case of Poland for R 0 = 1.05, and between 83.5% and 88% for R 0 = 1.2, showing that there were small chances for the H1N1 pandemic outbreak to start in the summer in those countries, in agreement with the observed unfolding [53] . In general, a large dependence of the probability of extinction on the reproductive number is observed. Analogously to the behavior discussed for the epidemic size, also for the probability of extinction Belgium represents a special case for which \u03c0 c is slightly larger than \u03c0 a , again induced by the larger average number of contacts in the adult class, differently from all other countries for which the data is available. Finally, in the case of homogeneous mixing in a nonpartitioned population, we recover the probability of extinction to be equal to R 0 \u22121 (dashed line in the figure) . The quantities reported in panels A,B of Figure 3 represent the ingredients to assess the risk of a global epidemic as driven by the partition of the population into age classes and the non-homogeneous mixing pattern considered, as also discussed in Ref. [14] . The additional role of the non-homogeneous travel behavior is considered explicitly by modeling the invasion process through Eq. (5). To solve the system analytically, we simplify the recursive relation of Eq. (5) in the assumption of mild epidemics (i.e. in the limit of R 0 close to 1), introduced or emerged in the system through a localized seeding event (so that the number of infected subpopulations can be neglected at the early stage of the spatial invasion), and considering the case of a mobility network lacking topological correlations (in this approximation the conditional probability P (k|k ' ) can be simplified, see the Additional file 1). By manipulating the Equation (see the Additional file 1 for the full details of the calculation), we obtain a condition allowing the increase of the number of infected subpopulations and a global epidemic in the metapopulation system only if",

Equation (7) defines the threshold condition for the global invasion: if R \u00c3 assumes values larger than 1, the epidemic starting from a given subpopulation will reach global proportion affecting a finite fraction of the subpopulations of the system; if instead R \u00c3 < 1, the epidemic will be contained at its source and will not spread further to other locations. The global invasion threshold is a complex function of the disease history parameters, and of the parameters describing the agespecific mixing patterns and travel behavior through \u03c0 c , \u03c0 a , r, z c , z a . Its dependence on the population spatial structure is embodied by travel fluxes and the topology of the mobility network, through w 0 , \u03b8, and the degree moments hk a i. However it is important to note that this indicator does not depend on the number of subpopulations V of the system, therefore it may be applicable to a variety of countries for which data is available, independently of their size. In the following we explore the dependence of R \u00c3 on these multiple factors, examine their role in driving the pandemic extinction or invasion, and provide possible applications examples for a set of countries considering the 2009 H1N1 pandemic.",

The large degree fluctuations found in real transportation systems and mobility patterns [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] constitute one of the mechanisms responsible for driving R \u00c3 to considerable high values, even when small values of the reproductive number are considered. Figure 3C shows the dependence of R \u00c3 on the reproductive number accounting for changes in the topological heterogeneity of the mobility network (\u03b3 = 2 and \u03b3 = 3) and in the traffic heterogeneity along the air connections (\u03b8 = 0.5 and \u03b8 = 0, the latter being the homogeneous traffic case). The larger degree fluctuations obtained in the case \u03b3 = 2 strongly increase the ratio (k 2 + 2 \u03b8 \u2212 k 1 + 2 \u03b8 )/k, leading to values of R \u00c3 ranging from~10 for R 0 = 1.05 up to approximately 10 3 for R 0 = 2, a value of the reproductive number consistent with the estimate for the 1918-1919 pandemic [54] . It is important to note that, besides the threshold condition R \u00c3 > 1, the absolute value of the estimator R \u00c3 provides a quantitative indication of the effective reduction that needs to be reached through public health interventions in order to bring R * below its threshold value, i.e. the difference R \u00c3 \u2212 1. The R \u00c3 values for \u03b3 = 2 are roughly one order of magnitude greater than the values recovered in the case \u03b3 = 3, and in addition the condition for the epidemic invasion is more sensitive to variations in R 0 in the case of larger heterogeneities in the air mobility patterns (\u03b3 = 2 vs. \u03b3 = 3). For both network topologies considered, the epidemic is above the threshold value of 1, and the outbreak is predicted to spread globally in the system for all diseases considered (R 0 \u2265 1.05), consistently with the H1N1 influenza virus invasion at the global level. The partition into classes, though lowering the epidemic sizes and increasing the probability of extinction [35, 55, 56] , is not able to drive the system below the threshold of the global invasion for the range of values explored. In addition, the contribution of the topological heterogeneity of the mobility network (k 2 + 2 \u03b8 \u2212 k 1 + 2 \u03b8 )/k in increasing the value of R \u00c3 is so large that it cannot be easily counterbalanced by reductions of the mobility scale w 0 corresponding to interventions through air travel restrictions. This was already observed in numerical results obtained from data-driven modeling approaches and in analytical predictions based on simple homogeneous mixing among individuals within the subpopulation of the system [28, 46, 50, [57] [58] [59] [60] . We will see in the following subsections how differences across countries may impact the conditions for invasion, and will quantitatively assess within this framework the role of travel reductions consistent with the traffic drop observed in the traffic to/from Mexico.",

During school holiday period (panel A), European countries are found to be close to the critical level, with a portion of the parameter space for Europe in the extinction region, thus confirming the results presented before regarding variations in the country-specific risks of major epidemics. These findings are compatible with the heterogeneous transmission of H1N1 influenza virus in summer 2009 that was not sustained across continental Europe [53] and identify the main mechanisms responsible of these effects in the interplay between demographic/mixing features and the seeding during school holidays (due to similar school calendars, with the exception of the UK). If instead we consider that the influenza pandemic arrived in the UK during school term, our predictions indicate that the risk of a major epidemic with community and spatial transmission was expected to be very high even during summer period ( Figure 5B ), as observed in the country. Other factors undoubtedly played a role in producing the different transmission across countries, and they include humidity conditions [53] , and the timing and magnitude of the coupling of the European continent to Mexico and the United States through international travel [3] , both factors being country-specific and not considered here.",

Such a small change in r may also be enough to drive the system from the extinction phase to the major epidemic phase, for certain values of the other parameters. For example, an epidemic starting in a subpopulation in Italy, where the across-groups mixing is equal to \u03b5 = 0.08, would reach pandemic proportion if a small fraction of children would travel by air, with respect to the case in which such fraction is neglected (see the vertical line in Figure 6A ). Given the specific seeding role of children vs. adults, age-targeted entry screening of travelers at airports may be envisaged in an attempt to prevent spatial transmission. The mild and self-limiting nature of most influenza infections, in addition to the presence of asymptomatic infections, is however likely to prevent a perfect identification and notification of cases at entry ports. Given that even a small percentage of children traveling would considerably increase the risk of spatial transmission, leading only to small delays in the invasion process [63] , such interventions should be evaluated with respect to their actual efficacy in specific epidemic emergencies and balanced against the resources required for their implementation.",

The country seed of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, Mexico, has for instance a larger fraction of the population in the younger age class compared to the population of Europe, \u03b1 = 0.32 vs. \u03b1 = 0.20 (where the age classification used for Mexico is up to 15 years old instead of up to 18 years old as adopted in Europe, due to data availability) and is characterized by a larger number of contacts established by children with respect to adults (\u03b7 = 0.32 vs. \u03b7 = 0.79). Our predictions indicate that, for the same assortativity values, there exists a range of values of the epidemic transmission potential that is compatible with epidemic containment in Mexico, whereas Europe may experience spatial propagation of the disease (see Figure 6B for R 0 = 1.05). Remarkably, the increase of the fraction of children and the change in the contact ratio, with no change in the across-groups mixing pattern (i.e. same \u03b5), is able to drive the system in the Mexican scenario to the extinction phase, reducing of 94% the global invasion threshold obtained for Europe if we consider a pathogen with a transmission potential compatible with the seasonal estimates of the H1N1 pandemic in Europe during summer 2009 [3] . Such results would be particularly important when considering the country where a new epidemic may emerge, as predictions obtained from previous works considering hypothetical seeding countries would be hardly applicable if demographic features are different. National preparedness plans may be informed by country-specific recommendations through the present approach, and an extensive exploration of the model's results in terms of classes of demographic and contact pattern features would help in providing more general insights on classes of seeding scenarios.",

Figure 7 addresses the comparison between the two cases, immunity and no-immunity, by showing the two corresponding critical curves R \u00c3 = 1 in the \u03b1, \u03b5 plane for Europe and Mexico (panels A and B, respectively). The effect of pre-existing immunity in reducing the probability of a global epidemic spread is shown by the increase in the value of \u03b5 corresponding to the invasion condition R \u00c3 = 1; a larger mixing across age classes is therefore needed for the pathogen to spatially propagate in case a fraction of the older age class is immune, whereas a more assortative population is predicted to be able to contain the emerging epidemic. The effect is very small for the case of Mexico, while for Europe it is more visible given that the considered European population is, on average, older than the Mexican one, and thus a larger fraction of the adult population is assumed to be immune in Europe with respect to Mexico (9.6% in Europe vs. 4.4% in Mexico). The points (\u03b1, \u03b5) parameterized with the average European data and with Mexican data (corresponding dots in the Figure 7) both lie in the spatial invasion phase when we consider R 0 \u2265 1.2 in Europe and R 0 \u2265 1.4 in Mexico.",

However, in all our predictions we assume the same population structure (\u03b1), contacts and mixing profiles (\u03b5, \u03b7), and travel behavior (r) across all subpopulations of the metapopulation system, as informed by the data for a given country. We consider this approximation a reasonable one for regions characterized by population features that are quite uniform across space, for instance if we consider the subpopulations within a given country; already at the European level we noticed how small variations in demographic features and mixing patterns may be responsible for diverse outcomes regarding extinction or invasion, and additional layers of heterogeneities need to be considered when variations among populations within the system are larger (e.g. regarding travel behavior per age class, as shown in Figure 1B ). This could be achieved by considering subpopulation-dependent variables {\u03b1 i , \u03b5 i , \u03b7 i , r i } (with i indicating the subpopulation), however preventing an analytical treatment to solve the system due to the additional complications considered, thus requiring the use of numerical approaches.",

Differently from these numerical approaches that can describe the geotemporal propagation of the infectious disease in the population, our model does not provide any temporal information on the epidemic unfolding in that all dynamical aspects are synthetically summarized in a branching process leading to the condition for global invasion. On the other hand, given the relevance of demographic profiles, mixing patterns and age-specific travel resulting from the present study, it would be important to further extend large-scale spatial transmission computational models to include such features. While computationally feasible, the main limitation nowadays is represented by the availability of mixing data and travel behavior for a large set of countries, given a global level objective. This further supports the need to have multiple modeling frameworks that can complement each other in providing important information to characterize an emerging epidemic and its associated risks and impact.",

These may refer for example to changes in the contact patterns due to self-awareness or changes at the community level due to the implementation of intervention strategies to control the epidemic [49, [69] [70] [71] [72] [73] . On the other hand, these scenarios can be separately studied with the model, assuming each of these features to be constant in time, in order to assess the effect of such changes on the corresponding risk of a major epidemic. As possible application examples we provided model predictions for different mixing patterns related to school terms and school holidays during H1N1 pandemic, as well as uniform travel restrictions that may result from selfimpositions, national guidelines or travel bans. Future studies will focus on other historical epidemics, like e.g. the case of the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak, in order to explore which mechanisms, among the ones included in this approach and related to the applied interventions or to individual's self-adaptation, hindered a fully global transmission of the disease.",

We introduced and solved a multi-host stochastic metapopulation model to quantify these aspects and characterize the conditions of the population partition and heterogeneous travel behavior that lead to the pandemic global invasion. Notwithstanding the high level of assortativity observed in contact patterns data by age, that increase the probability of pandemic extinction, the model explains the spread at the global level observed in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic as induced by the interplay between the heterogeneity of the air mobility network structure, favoring the spread, and the population partition. A major epidemic is always achieved for R 0 \u2265 1.2 even in the case children are assumed not to travel, when the model is parameterized with European countries data and statistics. Results are also consistent with the occurrence of sporadic outbreaks in continental Europe during summer 2009 and widespread transmission in the UK, once the model is informed with the substantial reduction in transmission associated to school holidays.",

Such findings calls for the need to develop further studies in order to identify the social factors that affect this parameter and design targeted interventions, such as work-related measures, that may lower it, thus reducing the risk of an outbreak.",

The approach represents a general framework that can be applicable to other case studies and host population partitions that do not depend on age, such as for instance mixing patterns and travel behaviors depending on socioeconomic aspects, or contact profiles and mobility within specific settings where classes correspond to professional roles or conditions of individuals (e.g. healthcare workers and patients in hospitals).",
