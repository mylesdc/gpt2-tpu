Complete genomic sequences of the human-and mosquito-derived viruses were established, genetically compared and phylogenetically analyzed. The viruses were not identical, but closely related to each other and to recent Czech and Italian isolates, indicating co-circulation of related WNV strains within a confined geographic area. The detection of WNV in a blood donation originating from an area with low WNV prevalence in humans (only three serologically diagnosed cases between 2008 and 2014) is surprising and emphasizes the importance of WNV nucleic acid testing of blood donations even in such areas, along with active mosquito surveillance programs.",

Up to 9 different genetic lineages have been described so far [1] ; medically most important are lineages 1 and 2. WNV is maintained in a mosquito-bird transmission cycle, humans and horses are considered dead-end hosts. Most human infections are asymptomatic, however approximately 20% of cases develop a febrile illness with flu-like symptoms (West Nile fever, WNF) and less than 1% West Nile neuroinvasive disease (WNND), the latter associated with a mortality rate of about 10% [2] . The vast majority of patients acquire WNV infection through the bite of an infected mosquito, mainly of the genus Culex [3] . Other routes of transmission include blood transfusion, solid organ transplantation, congenital infection, and laboratory accidents [2] . Ticks may play an alternative role as vectors, especially in the introduction of WNV to new areas when attached to birds [4] .",

Interestingly, the highly conserved N-glycosylation site N-154 of the E gene, which has been associated with significant human outbreaks including the North American epidemic [13] and which was initially identified in both the Austrian human plasma and mosquito pool, mutated to lysine (K-154) during the virus isolation process of the plasma sample in suckling and adult mice. Despite (or because) of lack of glycosylation of this site, the WNV plasma isolate turned out to be highly neuroinvasive for adult mice. Such a mutation was also observed among the Russian WNV strains isolated in Volgograd 1999 from human brains indicating their high neuroinvasivness and pathogenicity (GenBank acc. nos. AY277252 and AF317203) [21] . Studies in mice revealed that-while both non-and E-glycosylated WNV strains were equally neurovirulent-the latter were more neuroinvasive [13] . The WNV strain investigated in our study had fortunately caused only mild febrile illness in the Viennese patient, possibly related to the comparatively young age of the patient. In addition, we do not expect that the neuroinvasive properties of the plasma isolate were due to the presence of lysine at position E-154 or due to the lack of the N-154 glycan, however this exceptional point mutation observed in the present study requires further analysis.",

Compared to recent Czech and Hungarian studies, in which WNV-positive mosquitoes were found in four of 650 pools [11] and in three of 645 pools [34] , respectively, the MIR in our mosquito collection seems to be relatively high. A possible explanation for this phenomenon could be the fact that more than 90% of mosquitoes collected in Vienna represented non-adult individuals, including egg rafts, pupae and larvae, which may be progenies of a few infected adult mosquitoes. Most published WNV detections in mosquitoes were in adult individuals only, and reports of detections in different developmental stages of mosquitoes are scarce [35] .",

Although Cx. pipiens are essentially ornithophilic mosquitoes, their blood meal may be taken from mammals, including humans [36] . Hence, infected females may contribute to avian and human infections by horizontal transmission of the virus during their blood feedings, but also to vertical virus transmission [37] . Vertically infected Cx. pipiens that entered diapause in late autumn are able to initiate infection in the following spring [37] . Thus, detection of WNV-RNA in egg rafts and pupae deposited by infected females during late summer or fall may provide evidence for the vertical passage of WNV to overwintering cohorts.",
