These can cause explosive global outbreaks resulting in substantial economic and public health burden [1] . Moreover, zoonotic pathogens may spill over to human hosts and in some cases result in a considerable endemic health burden. This is especially true in low resourced and rural settings, where livestock play a central role in daily life and people interact closely with their animals through shared housing and during routine husbandry practices including herding, milking, helping with birthing process and deworming. In addition, various cultural norms in some communities promote consumption of unprocessed livestock products such as unpasteurized milk and uninspected meat. As a result, this expanded and close human-animal interface in countries such as Kenya presents a threat for increased transmission of zoonotic pathogens between animals and humans along the livestock value chain, increasing the likelihood of novel zoonotic pathogens establishing themselves in human populations, the overall endemic burden of common zoonoses, and the threat of infectious disease outbreaks which can threaten global health security.",

Globally, the recognition of the threat of emerging and re-emerging zoonoses led to advocacy for the adoption of a One Health approach at country level aimed at strengthening monitoring and response to zoonotic disease risks via a multisectoral, transdisciplinary collaboration [3, 4] . In practice, different countries have approached implementation the principle of One Health variously with varying successes and challenges [5] . In Kenya, creation of a coordination framework between public health and animal (domestic and wildlife) health sector to understand, prevent and control re-emerging and endemic zoonotic diseases has played a central role in the adoption and implementation of the One Health approach.",

Within the GDDD, zoonotic diseases research and a One Health approach were identified as key focus areas with dedicated funding and personnel to lead this effort within the One Health Program formally set up in 2010. The GDDD's One Health program focused on enhancing collaboration between human and animal health sectors, improving surveillance and diagnostic capacity for the animal health sector and conducting research at the human-animal interface.",

This framework was quickly tested by an outbreak of RVF in the Eastern Africa Region during 2006-2007. Previously, despite the endemicity of RVF and the relative predictability of epidemics, the 1996-1997 RVF outbreak in Kenya caught public health authorities unprepared. Delays in detection and response combined with the lack of local capacity for diagnostic testing (specimens were tested late in the outbreak's course at the National Institute of Communicable Diseases in South Africa) likely contributed to the large 1996/7 outbreak resulting in 27,500 human infections and 170 deaths in Garissa in North Eastern Kenya. The outbreak was associated with large, but mostly undocumented socio-economic impacts resulting from animal deaths [8, 9] . In contrast, the 2006/07 RVF outbreak in Kenya that was more geographically widespread was characterized by a more timely diagnosis and better coordinated response and resulted in 700 suspected human cases and 90 deaths. This enhanced response could in part be credited to the efforts to build capacity for coordinated outbreak response and communication pathways within the Ministry of Health (MoH) and Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, and Fisheries (MALF), through increased human capacity, the presence of a multisectoral coordination structure arising from the HPAI preparedness effort and enhanced diagnostic capacity in local government, and improved research infrastructure including a BSL-3 laboratory at KEMRI supported by CDC Kenya [10] [11] [12] . The 2006/07 RVF outbreak played a key role in galvanizing collaboration in One Health approaches among government departments, researchers and international organizations to mitigate impacts of future outbreaks and catalyzed the need for clearer understanding and adoption of One Health approach with a focus on supporting animal health surveillance activities [10] . This success with RVF, demonstrated the need to expand and improve the approach for all potentially zoonotic outbreaks, but also to understand, prevent and control endemic zoonotic disease. In Particular a lack of a formal framework for systematic collaboration between government Ministries and among key stakeholders on management of zoonotic disease outbreaks was a critical gap.",

This provided an opportunity and need to expand the One Health approach to the subnational (county) level. To cascade the benefits of One Health approach to the county level, the ZDU and its partners have embarked in training and setting up county One Health units supported mainly through CDC Kenya's Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA) implementing partners. County One Health units focus on initiating or enhancing communication platforms between the health and livestock sectors to improve surveillance and reporting of zoonotic diseases, ensuring rapid joint investigation and response to zoonotic disease outbreaks to mitigate disease impact. As of April 2017, there were 31 of 47 Kenya counties with established county One Health units. Through collaborations with other international partners, there will be county One Health units in all 47 counties by 2019. Sharing of disease outbreak information across sectors and rapid joint outbreak response at county level should help reduce the burden of spillover to humans that acquire zoonotic disease infections as illustrated by an example of an anthrax outbreak in Nakuru County (Table 1) .",

From a list of 35 zoonotic diseases, the top five were anthrax, trypanosomiasis, rabies, brucellosis and Rift Valley Fever. Based on these findings, development and implementation of disease prevention and control plans for these priority zoonoses with greatest public health impact is being undertaken while promoting collaborative research and surveillance for all the diseases to generate national data and for evaluating control strategies. . This program provides training in applied epidemiology, resulting in a Master's of Science (MSc), initially offered to medical doctors and laboratory scientists working within government ministries [16] . Since 2006, with increased recognition of the value of One Health, veterinarians have been admitted to the training [16] . By 2017, the Kenya FELTP had 169 medical and 19 veterinary epidemiologists complete the two-year training program. Of these trained veterinarians, all initially returned to government positions, and the majority stayed at national or country level, strengthening collaboration between the human and animal health sector with fellow FELTP graduates participating in joint outbreak response and other activities during their training (Fig. 2) .",

In response to the alert, CDC Kenya, in collaboration with Kenya MALF (through GHSA funding), set up a mobile phone-based enhanced active surveillance system between November 2015 and February 2016 in 22 (of 47) RVF high-risk counties. The surveillance system collected environmental and livestock monitoring data from resident veterinary officers at county and sub-county level on weekly basis and provided for toll free telephone contact to headquarters in order to report any suspected RVF cases. The veterinary surveillance officers contacted a network of farmers spread out through the sub counties. Over 10,000 reports were submitted with 66 of the syndromic reports meeting the suspect case definition for RVF [19] , however none was confirmed, and the conclusion was that no RVF in livestock had actually occurred. Although an outbreak had not occurred, the potential of one provided an opportunity to test a coordinated, rapid and enhanced surveillance response, highlighting possibility of a more robust and real-time reporting tool in place of a variety of manual and electronic tools that have been used with varied success.",

The mobile application has adapted manual disease reporting forms currently in use for reporting. Nine syndromes are targeted for reporting: abortion, sudden death, hemorrhagic, neurologic, respiratory, animal bites and oral/foot lesions. Since this mobile phone based application can be downloaded onto any android-based mobile phone device, this reporting tool promises to greatly enhance real-time surveillance within Kenya's animal health sector. This surveillance is part of institutional capacity building funded by GHSA and targeted to reach up to 10 counties by 2019. Anthrax is endemic in Nakuru County, where outbreaks in animals are reported annually. In June 2016, a farmer from one village sent samples from his animal that had died suddenly to the Nakuru Regional Veterinary Investigations Laboratory. These samples tested positive for anthrax. Officers at the regional laboratory notified officers at the subcounty veterinary department, who in turn immediately notified the sub-county department of health in Nakuru County. The sub-county officers of health visited the village to trace the affected farmers' household, sensitize the community, and health workers and offered prophylaxis treatment to those who had been exposed (eaten meat from the animals or slaughtered/skinned) to dead animals. The veterinary department carried out anthrax ring vaccination of livestock as an outbreak control measure. Upon further records review at the veterinary department, the team identified that a total of 10 cows had died between May and June 2016 of suspected anthrax infection.",

Brucellosis CDC Kenya and the ZDU implemented a study in three counties among humans and their livestock and found a varying (2.4-46.4%) seroprevalence in humans and 1.2-13.5% in livestock among the counties, largely associated with cultural practices around livestock and their products particularly unpasteurized milk and low knowledge levels on brucellosis.

Rickettsia were detected by PCR in 7.2% of febrile patients, which was 2-fold higher than in the afebrile patients suggesting that Rickettsial pathogens are an important differential diagnosis among patients with undifferentiated fever in this region [37] . Subsequently cross-sectional studies in PBIDS platforms found previous exposure to spotted fever group rickettsia in goats (43%), sheep (23%) and cattle (1%) and in majority (> 90%) of Amblyomma variegatum tick pools and in 66% of flea pools [38] . Further these studies identified, isolated and sequenced a novel (to the world) rickettsial pathogen, Rickettsia asemboensis in cat and dog fleas in western Kenya.",

Further work looking at the linkage of human health and owning livestock through the nutritional pathway as well as assessing the level of microbiome development among children at household level has yielded insights into the impact of animal ownership and animal source foods on growth and development of children under 5 years old as well as the factors associated with level of microbiome sharing [45, 46] .

In addition, setting up surveillance programs is resource intensive with few partners providing support. Convincing policy makers of the benefit of planning and investing in animal surveillance for public health gain is often challenged where data on burden of zoonoses are scanty and when the threat is not immediately apparent zoonotic and/or not an existing emerging disease threat. On a positive note, in 2013 DGHP Kenya funded the development of a rabies elimination plan for Kenya [14] that has since attracted funding from various MALF and MOH development partners for rabies elimination activities including mass dog vaccination, enhanced rabies surveillance in humans and animals, enhanced management of dog bite cases and operational research. Finally, the Kenya ZDU has not fully incorporated the environment health sector to be fully compliant with the scope of One Health approach. This has in part been due to lack of clearly designated government ministry that represents the environment sector. Currently efforts have been made to include an ecologist as a core personnel to the ZDU to provide environmental health expertise. In addition, the strategic plan for the implementation of One Health is being reviewed to reflect the progress made and identify strategies for institutionalizing One Health at sub-national level.",

The extent of adoption of the One Health approach has been remarkable at the national level. However, at the sub-national (County and sub-county levels) where most disease management decisions are made, more progress is needed. With GHSA support, the ZDU has made concerted efforts to establish functional One Health units at county levels to enhance coordination and communication of key ministries and stakeholders for surveillance and disease outbreak response; however the benefits of these efforts are currently being evaluated. Finally, sustainability of the current progress and efforts are not guaranteed due to the reliance on donor funding to implement these One Health activities. This is a challenge that goes beyond One Health implementation and is largely appreciated for many donor-initiated efforts. Most governments have a host of competing interests including constant outbreaks of epidemic prone diseases such as cholera, other infectious diseases and non-communicable diseases within the health sector and focusing on promotion of international trade in animals and animal products that often make the importance of zoonotic diseases pale in comparison. Commendably, ZDU has initiated advocacy plans to lobby for government support through the line ministries to maintain One Health activities beyond the current GHSA initiative.",

The adoption of the One Health program and approach in Kenya has led to rapid detection and control of zoonotic disease outbreaks at their source and thereby enhanced global health security.
