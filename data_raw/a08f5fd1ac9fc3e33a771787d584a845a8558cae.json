This study investigated the effects of architectural features on airborne pathogen dispersion in emergency departments by using a CFD (computational fluid dynamics) simulation tool. The study included three architectural features as the major variables: increased ventilation rate, inlet and outlet diffuser positions, and partitions between beds. The most effective method for preventing pathogen dispersion and reducing the pathogen concentration was found to be increasing the ventilation rate. Installing partitions between the beds and changing the ventilation system's inlet and outlet diffuser positions contributed only minimally to reducing the concentration of airborne pathogens.",

In particular, if the hospital does not have isolation rooms [4] [5] [6] for the treatment of patients carrying airborne pathogens or has more respiratory patients visit the hospital than the number of beds available in the isolation rooms, it is possible that patients with respiratory problems will be assigned to normal beds in the ED. In this situation, it is anticipated that the possibility of airborne pathogen dispersion in the ED increases. Airborne pathogens are particles that are 5 \u00b5m or smaller (aerosol) [7] . As they travel in the air, their dispersion to nearby areas is possible, depending on the indoor air conditions. Controlling the indoor air patterns, installing partitions between units to prevent airborne pathogen dispersion, and installing UV lamps to sterilize the pathogens can be considered as alternatives to prevent the dispersion of airborne pathogens inside EDs. Partitions are used in target ED in hospitals as a means to control the dispersion of airborne pathogens [8] .",

The impermeable partitions that have benefits such as easy installation and cheap price are thought to be useful to prevent the air pathogen transfer from a bed to another. However, airflow pattern and ventilation rate can influence the effects of the partition regarding airborne pathogen dispersion. This study investigates the combined effects of ventilation rate, inlet/outlet location and existence of partition in ED on airborne pathogen dispersion and consequent infection risk.

Based on this, the baseline ventilation condition without airborne pathogen control was set at 3 ACH in this study. The entire air supply was assumed to come from the outside [9] . The ventilation condition for pathogen control was set at 6 ACH. This is the minimum value in the range of 6 ACH-12 ACH, which is the required ventilation rate inside negative pressure units suggested by the \"Plan for extended installation of negative pressure units at nationally designated isolation hospitals\" The numbers of inlets and outlets, as shown in Figures 2 and 3 , were slightly different in the base model and the Type 1 model. This was because the diffusers were placed in the spaces between the beds in the base model so that the ventilation would not occur directly in the face of the patient. The Type 1 model applied walls between each bed, and the ventilator supply was placed at every bed. The inlet condition for the Star-CCM+ simulation model was set to the velocity inlet, and the outlet condition was set as a split ratio outlet. The buoyancy effect was considered, and the detailed thermal conditions of the simulation models are shown in Table 1 . Assuming that the patient breathed 18 times/min, had a breathing capacity of 500 mL (about 9 L/min), and their mouth measured 0.04 m \u00d7 0.02 m, the average air velocity of exhalation was calculated to be approximately 0.19 m/s. Based on this, therefore, the average exhalation velocity was set in the model to be 0.2 m/s (red arrow in Figure 3 .). Patients were assumed to be lying in the center of their beds. The exhalation was emitted from one patient, and the analysis was conducted accordingly. A passive scalar was selected to represent the pathogen included in the exhalation, and the concentration was 1.0. According to previous study [11] , the passive scalar method is also a good approach of small particles bioaerosols. The airborne pathogen dispersion pattern resulting from the exhalation, mixing of airflows, and turbulence patterns was visualized for analysis. Figure 4 shows the data measuring points for the analysis of pathogen concentration. The points were set at a height of 1.0 m, in consideration of the location of the respiratory system of a patient lying in a bed. The meshing conditions of the base (2,405,265 cells) and Type 1 (2,691,618 cells) models are provided in Table 2 . The black boxes above the beds are inlets and outlets of the ventilator. The bulge of the bed is 2.0 m \u00d7 0.9 m \u00d7 0.5 m. Human body is expressed in Figure 2 and mouth is modeled top of the human body(0.04m \u00d7 0.02 m, 0.7 m height). ",

When the ventilation system inlets were installed over the patients' respiratory systems (Region A), the airflow into the inlet acted like an air-curtain and prevented the airborne pathogen dispersion from the emitting source to other places, and the outlet at the hallway provided a secondary barrier (Case 5). Interestingly, in Case 6, with a 3 ACH ventilation rate, the airborne pathogens were not sufficiently exhausted at the outlet above the patients' respiratory organs. The rest of the airborne pathogen moved to the hallway, and the airflow from the inlet installed in the hallway accelerated the dispersion of the airborne pathogen to the adjacent beds. As a result of these dispersion patterns, installing partitions caused airborne pathogen concentration to increase at X2 and X4. However, installing partitions contributed to a decrease in the airborne pathogen concentrations at X1 and X5. In Case 6, the pathogen concentration in the pathogen source bed greatly increased compared to the other cases, which could increase the infection risk for medical staff working in the source bed area.

In Case 5, the air was supplied over the patient's respiratory system (Region A), and the air supply pattern in sectional view was as shown in Figure 10b . The pathogen concentration for Case 5 in plan view is shown in Figure 10a . In Case 6, the air was supplied from the hallway side (Region B), resulting in concentrations in sectional view as shown in Figure 10d , and plan view as shown in Figure 10c .",

            "text": "Considering Figure 10 , it is evident that the partition delayed the airborne pathogen dispersion to the adjacent beds. When the ventilation system inlets were installed over the patients' respiratory systems (Region A), the airflow into the inlet acted like an air-curtain and prevented the airborne pathogen dispersion from the emitting source to other places, and the outlet at the hallway provided a secondary barrier (Case 5). Interestingly, in Case 6, with a 3 ACH ventilation rate, the airborne pathogens were not sufficiently exhausted at the outlet above the patients' respiratory organs. The rest of the airborne pathogen moved to the hallway, and the airflow from the inlet installed in the hallway accelerated the dispersion of the airborne pathogen to the adjacent beds. As a result of these dispersion patterns, installing partitions caused airborne pathogen concentration to increase at X2 and X4. However, installing partitions contributed to a decrease in the airborne pathogen concentrations at X1 and X5. In Case 6, the pathogen concentration in the pathogen source bed greatly increased compared to the other cases, which could increase the infection risk for medical staff working in the source bed area. Figure 11 shows the analysis result of the cases considering the conditions of installing partitions between the beds, changing the ventilation system inlet/outlet locations, and increasing the ventilation rate to 6 ACH. The simulated results of Cases 7 and 8 demonstrate that the increase in airborne pathogen concentration occurred mainly at X3. The increased ventilation ensures a solution for airborne infection prevention. The effects of installing partitions at a ventilation rate of 6 ACH varied depending on the ventilation system's inlet and outlet locations. Locating the inlets above the patients' respiratory organs still generated turbulence and increased the airborne pathogen concentration at the adjacent beds. The simulation results of Case 8 clearly show that the increased ventilation rate of 6 ACH and partition installation effectively reduced the airborne pathogen Figure 11 shows the analysis result of the cases considering the conditions of installing partitions between the beds, changing the ventilation system inlet/outlet locations, and increasing the ventilation rate to 6 ACH.

Changing the ventilation inlet and outlet locations in conditions of low ventilation rate and partition installation could cause the undesirable dispersion of the airborne pathogen (Case 6). Installing the outlet of the ventilation system over the patients' respiratory systems was found to greatly increase the pathogen concentrations around the airborne pathogen source. Yang et al. (2017) analyzed by CFD, it was said that setting the parallel bed layout and the exhaust port near the patient's head will lower the probability of air infection in the isolating room [20] . Hospital managers should be considered the placement of beds and the direction of airflow to reduce airborne infections. Ordinary breathing generates lots of bio-aerosol (1 \u00b5m or smaller) that can be transferred via air [21] [22] [23] . Thus, it is concluded that switching the ventilation inlet/outlet locations presents a high risk of increasing the probability of infection for medical staff providing medical treatments, such as endotracheal intubation [24, 25] and nebulizing [26] , to patients.",

However, it also had the shortcoming of increasing the pathogen concentration at the beds opposite and adjacent to the pathogen-source bed. These results suggest that patients who are at high risk of airborne infections may be able to provide appropriate patient placement in the ED. Physical blocks primarily prevent the spread of airborne pathogen between the emergency beds [9] . According to the CFD analysis, hospital curtains were presented in a simple and effective way for the spread of infection [27] . Thus, the airborne pathogens tend to accumulate around the source. Increased ventilation should, therefore, accompany partition installation in the ED. It should be 6 ACH recommended by WHO rather than Korean ventilation's criteria. Increasing ventilation rate requires additional HVAC system installation and surplus energy consumption. Natural ventilation or hybrid ventilation method may be implemented to reduce energy consumption. However, natural ventilation has limitation or disadvantage regarding airflow control, heat recovery, outdoor contaminants incoming [28] , difficulty in securing sufficient and consistent ventilation rate by season changing [29, 30] . To reduce energy consumption, partial fan assisted natural ventilation with appropriate filtering system, dedicated outdoor air system (intermediate season) and heat recovery system (heating season) in HVAC system can be good solutions.",
