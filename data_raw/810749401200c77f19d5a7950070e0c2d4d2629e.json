            "text": "Ubiquitination and deubiquitination have emerged as critical regulatory processes in the virus-triggered type I interferon (IFN) induction pathway. In this study, we carried out a targeted siRNA screen of 54 ubiquitin-specific proteases (USPs) and identified USP25 as a negative regulator of the virus-triggered type I IFN signaling pathway. Overexpression of USP25 inhibited virus-induced activation of IFN-\u03b2, interferon regulation factor 3 (IRF3) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB), as well as the phosphorylation of IRF3 and NF-\u03baB subunit p65. Furthermore, Knockdown of USP25 potentiated virus-induced induction of the IFN-\u03b2. In addition, detailed analysis demonstrated that USP25 cleaved lysine 48-and lysine 63-linked polyubiquitin chains in vitro and in vivo, and its deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) activity, were dependent on a cysteine residue (Cys178) and a histidine residue (His607). USP25 mutants lacking DUB activity lost the ability to block virus-induced type I IFN to some degree. Mechanistically, USP25 deubiquitinated retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I), tumornecrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2), and TRAF6 to inhibit RIG-I-like receptor-mediated IFN signaling. Our findings suggest that USP25 is a novel DUB negatively regulating virus-induced type I IFN production.",

            "text": "Innate immune responses are activated through host pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which recognize molecular structures called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) that are structurally conserved within large groups of pathogens. Upon engagement of PAMPs, PRRs initiate signaling pathways, ultimately triggering the production of type I interferons (IFNs) [1] . The type I IFN signal is then transducted by the activation of Janus kinase (JAK) family protein kinases and the signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) family of proteins [2] , resulting in the generation of the transcriptional activator, IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3). ISGF3 bind to their specific DNA sequences containing each common motif; namely, the IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE), and participates in IFN responses. IFN stimulation of promoters containing ISRE results in the transcriptional induction of a large number of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) to evoke antiviral activity [3] .",

Recognition of virus-derived double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and 5'triphosphorylated single-stranded RNA (5'pppssRNA) by retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) in the cytoplasm lead to the production of type I IFN and inflammatory cytokines [4] [5] [6] . RIG-I/MDA5 is indispensable for type I IFN responses to many RNA viruses, including influenza A virus, mumps virus, measles virus and Sendai virus (SEV) [7, 8] . After sensing cytoplasmic viral RNAs, RIG-I and/or MDA5 interacts with the caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD)-containing protein IFN-beta promoter stimulator 1 (IPS-1, also known as MAVS/VISA/Cardif) via CARD-like domains on both the RNA sensors and IPS-1 [9] [10] [11] [12] . In turn, the IPS-1 complex recruits the downstream adaptor proteins tumornecrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2), TRAF3 and TRAF6, and TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and I kappaB kinse (IKK) \u03b1/\u03b2, leading to activation of the critical transcription factors interferon regulation factor 3 (IRF3) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB) [9] [10] [11] . Phosphorylated IRF3 and NF-\u03baB translocate into the nucleus and directly induces type I IFNs, an array of cytokines and other mediators required for host defense [13, 14] .",

Multiple ubiquitin ligases and ubiquitin-binding scaffold proteins contribute to positive regulation of the antiviral innate immune response, such as RIG-I, TRAF2, TRAF6 and TBK1. Post-translational modification of proteins by the covalent ligation of ubiquitin is a crucial regulatory mechanism, and the enzymes that catalyze these modifications have been the focus of many studies [23] . Deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), which mediate the removal and processing of ubiquitin to recycle proteins, have a wide range of biological activity [24] . In recent years, the functions of DUBs in various pathways and signaling networks have been well reviewed. Accumulating evidence has revealed critical roles of deubiquitination in RIG-I-like receptor-mediated IFN signaling [25] . For example, deubiquitinating enzyme A (DUBA) selectively cleaves the lysine-63-linked polyubiquitin chains on TRAF3, resulting in its dissociation from the downstream signaling complex containing TANK-binding kinase 1 (TAK1) [20] ; the tumor suppressor cylindromatosis (CYLD) removes lysine-63-linked polyubiquitin chains from RIG-I, which inhibits the IRF3 signaling pathway [26] ; A20 removes lysine-63-linked polyubiquitin chains from receptor interacting protein (RIP) [27] .",

By siRNA screening, we identified a cellular deubiquitinase, USP25, which regulates the virus-induced ISRE promoter. We found that USP25 processes K48-linked and K63-linked polyubiquitin in vitro and in vivo. Through its DUB activity, USP25 cleaves ubiquitin moieties from critical signaling proteins of the type I IFN signaling pathway, RIG-I, TRAF2, and TRAF6.

Therefore, we investigated the effect of overexpression of USP25 on virus-induced type I IFN signaling. We used an IFN-\u03b2-dependent luciferase reporter assay to assess its abilities to modulate SEV-induced IFN-\u03b2 promoter in HEK-293T cells. The results showed that USP25 significantly reduced SEV-induced IFN-\u03b2 luciferase reporter activity (Figure 2A) . Consistent with these observations, quantitative reverse transcription (RT)-PCR showed that overexpression of USP25 inhibited SEV-induced expression of IFN-\u03b2 ( Figure 2B ). In addition, poly (I:C)-induced production of IFN-\u03b2 was significantly attenuated by the expression of USP25 ( Figure 2C ). We further investigated the effect of USP25 knockdown on virus-triggered IFN signaling. And we first tested the effect of individual siRNAs targeting USP25 by quantitative reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and immunoblotting. The results showed that expression of cell-endogenous USP25 were reduced both at the level of mRNA and protein ( Figure 2D and E). Reporter assays then indicated that knockdown of USP25 markedly potentiated SEV-induced activation of the IFN-\u03b2 promoter ( Figure 2F ). Collectively, these findings suggest that USP25 inhibits RIG-I/MDA5-dependent type I IFN signaling.",

We observed that overexpression of USP25 significantly inhibited SEV-induced activation of IRF3 and NF-\u03baB ( Figure 3A and B). Previous study indicated that porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) NSP1\u03b2 could inhibited both IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3)-and NF-\u03baB-dependent gene induction by dsRNA and Sendai virus [35] . Therefore, we used NSP1\u03b2 as a positive control in Figure 3A and B. We further examined whether USP25 affects virus-induced phosphorylation of IRF3 and p65. The results showed that overexpression of USP25 downregulated SEV-induced phosphorylation of IRF3 and p65 ( Figure 3C and D) . Taken together, our results suggest that USP25 negatively regulates IFN-\u03b2 expression by inhibiting SEV-induced activation of IRF3 and NF-\u03baB.",

We chose six USPs whose DUB activity had been reported [34, [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] . Sequence alignment showed that Cys178 and His607 of USP25 are highly conserved among all seven ubiquitin-specific peptidase (USPs) ( Figure 5D ). Replacement of the putative catalytic cysteine residue (Cys178) and histidine residue (His 607) of USP25 by an alanine residue resulted in nearly total loss of its catalytic activity in contrast to USP25 wild-type ( Figure 5E ).

Previous studies have demonstrated a critical role for the members of DUBs in antiviral innate immune responses. For example, several deubiquitinating enzymes, including A20, Cezanne, CYLD, USP15, and USP31, have been suggested to be involved in the downregulation of TNF-\u03b1 induced NF-\u03baB activation [27, [42] [43] [44] [45] . In recent years, the USPs subclass of DUBs has been deemed to represent the bulk of the deubiquitinating enzymes encoded in the human genome, and their distribution and functional diversity in eukaryotic tissues and organs have received extensive attention. However, the roles of USPs in the regulation of type I IFN production have not been studied in great detail.

However, DUB activity had been demonstrated for many USPs. For example, Junichiro et al. demonstrated that USP21 constitutively deubiquitinates RIP1 in vitro and in vivo [40] ; and a previous study has reported that USP20 deubiquitinates TRAF6 and Tax in vivo [40] . Here, we found that USP25 contains conserved Cys178 and His607 residues, which are important for the catalytic activity of USPs, suggesting that USP25 may have deubiquitinating activity. In subsequent experiments, we observed that USP25 did indeed appear to have DUB activity both in vitro and in vivo. We also revealed that USP25 could act on both K48-and K63-linked Ub polymers.

Thus, these USPs (USP11, USP20, USP15, and USP31) are very likely to inhibit virus-induced ISRE reporter activity. Consistent with this supposition, we found that knockdowns of these USPs strengthened SEV-induced ISRE reporter activity. In this study we focus on USP25, whose knockdown significantly potentiated SEV-induced activation of the ISRE promoter in the siRNA screen. However, this screening serves only as an initial step to identify the genes. We further found that overexpression of USP25 efficiently reduced SEV-induced IFN\u03b2 induction.",

Several ubiquitin ligase enzymes have been found to regulate these processes [47, 48] . For example, ubiquitination of RIG-I by the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM25, which contains a RING finger domain, is necessary and sufficient to activate IPS-1, which triggers the downstream signaling cascade to produce type I IFN [49] . Virus-triggered ubiquitination of TRAF2/6 by cIAP1/2 is essential for induction of IFN-\u03b2 and the cellular antiviral response [50, 51] . However, certain cellular USPs are known to modulate the antiviral innate immune response. For example, USP17 and USP20 were found to target RIG-I and TRAF6 respectively, thereby functioning as novel regulators of antiviral innate immune responses [39, 40] . In the present study, we are the first to expound that USP25 inhibited RIG-I-, IPS-1-, TRAF2-, and TRAF6-mediated activation of the IFN-\u03b2 promoter. In addition, wild-type USP25 significantly inhibits ubiquitination of RIG-I, TRAF2, and TRAF6, which is essential for activation of type I IFN signaling. However, both catalytically inactive mutants that are defective for DUB activity lost the capability of reducing ubiquitinated RIG-I, TRAF2, and TRAF6. In addition, the catalytic USP25 mutants (C178A and H607A) devoid of DUB activity significantly lost the ability of USP25 WT-mediated IFN inhibition. Taken together, these results indicate that the DUB activity of USP25 is involved in the inhibition of type I IFN induction.",

We hypothesize that mutation of the catalytic residues does not abolish the ability to combine with ubiquitin of target proteins; and that it is this kind of combination that may reduce the ability of proteins to transmit signals without cleaving the ubiquitin chains. Indeed, co-immunoprecipitation investigation showed that USP25 interacted with RIG-I and TRAF6 (see Figure S1 ). Therefore, we hypothesize that USP25 may affect RIG-Imediated signal transmission by interacting with RIG-I and TRAF6 to reduce type I interferon induction. Further investigation will be required to identify USP25 mutants that disrupt the interaction of USP25 and RIG-I/TRAF6 but do not affect DUB activity; and to test whether these domains of USP25 interacting with RIG-I and TRAF6 also contribute to the inhibition of IFN induction by USP25.",

Previous studies have shown that the DUB activity of USP25m, a muscle isoform of USP25, did not strictly depend on the ubiquitinbinding domains (UBDs), but required a coiled-coil stretch between amino acids 679 to 769 [52] . Future investigation will be required to test whether these domains of USP25 are also involved in USP25-mediated IFN inhibition. In addition, USP25 interacts with the ubiquitin ligase HRD1 and rescues several endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) substrates from degradation by the proteasome [53] . Also, USP25 can be a functional deubiquitinase of TRAF5 and TRAF6 in the regulation of IL-17-mediated signaling and inflammation [54] . Recently Zhong et al. reported that USP25 was a critical modulator of TLR4-mediated, but not TLR3mediated, signaling. They mainly focus on the regulation of USP25 deubiquitination in TLR4 signaling in terms of the production of proinflammatory cytokines and type I IFNs [55] . However, our studies explain that USP25 negatively modulates RIG-I/MDA5-dependent type I IFN signaling. These have showed that USP25 has a wide range of biological activity and differentially regulates innate response.",
