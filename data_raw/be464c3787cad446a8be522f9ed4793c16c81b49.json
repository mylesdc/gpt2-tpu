In eukaryotes, intracellular vesicle transport is mediated by vesicle transport proteins that are needed to move cargo between organelles and across the plasma membrane [1, 2] . The best studied examples of vesicle-forming proteins appear to initiate membrane curvature by inserting amphipathic protein domains into one side of the membrane, displacing lipid molecules and effectively stretching one membrane face more than the other [3] [4] [5] . While there is considerable evidence for this mechanism, it has proved difficult to directly demonstrate that lipid molecules are displaced when proteins are inserted, as stipulated by the model.",

Virus-sized unilamellar vesicles in these micrographs were generally spherical as expected [7] , with an average ratio of 1.0560.10 for the largest to the smallest visible diameter. Three of the eleven viruses studied showed a statistically significant correlation between virus size and shape, ranging from small round viruses to large sausage-shaped particles with maximum diameters up to seven times as long as the shortest diameter ( Fig. 2A) , demonstrating that membrane shape is altered when virus proteins are present. The viruses selected here are all relatively simple, in that matrix proteins and the transmembrane anchors of the surface glycorproteins are the only virus components in direct contact with the membrane. The correlation between size and shape was absent or reduced for GP vesicles (Fig. 2B) , demonstrating that the matrix proteins of these viruses are necessary for membrane bending, as reported previously [8] .",

We looked for differences in the apparent brightness of the membrane in electron micrographs as a way to detect changes in the amount protein in each side of the membrane. This method works on the principle that electrons passing through a sample are scattered approximately in proportion to the square of the atomic number of the constituent atoms [9] . Therefore, when a substance made of small atoms such as protein is integrated into the membrane, membrane lipids are displaced, making that membrane face appear correspondingly dimmer compared to cellderived vesicle controls of similar size in the same image. Matrix proteins from different viruses are believed to use different methods to interact with the membrane. Our dataset included representatives of the three common membrane anchor types, including viruses with transmembrane matrix proteins (Coronaviridae M, Arteriviridae M and GP5), acylated matrix proteins (Retroviridae Gag, Arenaviridae Z) and non-acylated proteins (Orthomyxoviridae M1). The three-dimensional structures of these proteins, where known, appear to be unrelated [10] [11] [12] .",

We tested for this effect by examining the intensity of internal, membrane and external features of 216 Tacaribe virus particles, which ranged from 40 nm to 260 nm in diameter (Fig. 4) .

Contrast in electron microscopy images has two main sources, called amplitude and phase contrast. Amplitude contrast occurs when electrons collide with atoms in the sample and are scattered, and changes with the atomic mass of the sample [13] . Phase contrast is caused by electron interference, and changes with defocus [13] . To examine the effects of phase contrast, TCRV images were grouped according to defocus and analysed as before. Matrix-dependent phosphate displacement was observed across the defocus range (Fig. 5) , though the effect was strongest in images where both phosphate rings were distinctly visible. We concluded that matrix-dependent displacement was not likely caused by electron interference.",

However, neither provides a convenient way to measure membrane curvature where the protein contacts the membrane, and both analyze the entire sample at once, making it difficult to interpret heterogeneous samples such as native enveloped viruses. Electron spin resonance also requires spin-labeling, which can be difficult to perform without perturbing fragile membrane interactions. Phosphate displacement analysis can be used on native samples, and it provides complementary data on the location and footprint of single protein-membrane interactions from within the visual context of a cryo-electron micrograph.",
