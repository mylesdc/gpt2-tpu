Bats, remarkably, are the natural reservoirs of many of the most pathogenic viruses in humans. There are two bat genome projects currently underway, a circumstance that promises to speed the discovery host factors important in the coevolution of bats with their viruses. These genomes, however, are not yet assembled and one of them will provide only low coverage, making the inference of most genes of immunological interest error-prone. Many more wildlife genome projects are underway and intend to provide only shallow coverage. Results: We have developed a statistical method for the assembly of gene families from partial genomes. The method takes full advantage of the quality scores generated by base-calling software, incorporating them into a complete probabilistic error model, to overcome the limitation inherent in the inference of gene family members from partial sequence information. We validated the method by inferring the human IFNA genes from the genome trace archives, and used it to infer 61 type-I interferon genes, and single type-II interferon genes in the bats Pteropus vampyrus and Myotis lucifugus. We confirmed our inferences by direct cloning and sequencing of IFNA, IFNB, IFND, and IFNK in P. vampyrus, and by demonstrating transcription of some of the inferred genes by known interferon-inducing stimuli.",

Among wildlife sources, bats, mammals of the order Chiroptera, are perhaps the most striking, serving as the primary natural reservoirs for many human pathogens [2] [3] [4] [5] , including several viruses of notorious lethality in humans: Nipah virus [6] , Hendra virus [7] , Ebola and Marburg Viruses [8, 9] , and Rabies virus. Rabies virus is regarded as the most lethal of all human pathogens, and has been found in bats for over a century [10] . Rabies and other Lyssaviruses are now found in many other animals, but phylogenetic studies indicate that these viruses first evolved in bats and transferred to animals of the order Carnivora more recently [11] . SARS-like Coronaviruses have also been found in bats [12, 13] and so far provide the closest link to the agent of human SARS.",

In the first, the differences between the two traces are attributable to sequencing error only, and must be consistent with the reported position-specific quality scores. In the latter, the divergence of the underlying genes from their common ancestor provides an additional source of differences. The difference in description lengths under these two models provides a criterion for choosing between the models. In fact, the criterion we will use for determining the final set of assemblies is the minimization of the total description length of S under the model in figure  1 . Briefly, the description length is the information required to encode the data and the values of the model parameters. (See [30] for a complete treatment of description length techniques for inference.) For any sub-model for pairs of traces that involves mutations from the common ancestor, the description length must account for the information required to encode the mutation rate.

The size of this family suggests that it may still be involved in host defense in bats even if it has lost that function in pigs.

Stimulants were diluted such that the addition of 250 \u03bcl stimulant would give a final concentration of 10 \u03bcg/ml poly I:C, 1 \u03bcg/ml LPS, or an MOI of 5 for VSV. 500 \u03bcl of complete medium was added to the unstimulated control wells.

Quantitative real-time PCR was performed in an Eppendorf Mastercycler ep realplex thermal cycler using SYBRGreenER qPCR Supermix and primers designed from the inferred gene sequences (additional file 3). Independent biological replicates were prepared for each treatment and time point.

Maximum likelihood phylogenies were inferred with proml found in the PHYLIP 3.68 package [38] . Minimum evolution phylogenies were inferred using fastme [39] based on the distance matrix calculated with protdist found in PHYLIP.

We are grateful to Brian Pope and Tasha King at the Lubee Bat Conservancy for their expert assistance. Dr. Ramsburg's work was supported by NIH grants UC6 AI058607 and AI51445. Dr. Kepler's work was supported by discretionary funds provided by Duke University. No additional external funding was used. No funding source had any influence on the study design, on the collection, analysis, or interpretation of data, on the writing of the manuscript, or on the decision to submit the manuscript for publication. Authors' contributions ER and TBK conceived the project and designed the experiments. TBK developed, implemented, and applied the statistical methods. CS, KH, and AH performed the experiments. JR and TBK performed the phylogenetic analysis. AW contributed critical reagents and assisted in interpretation of results. TBK, CS, and ER wrote the manuscript. All authors read and approved the final manuscript.",
