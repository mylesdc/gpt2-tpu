The most suitable reference genes in sheep have been identified for a restricted range of tissues, but no specific data on whole blood are available. The aim of this study was to identify a set of reference genes for normalizing qRT-PCR from ovine whole blood. We designed 11 PCR assays for commonly employed reference genes belonging to various functional classes and then determined their expression stability in whole blood samples from control and disease-stressed sheep. SDHA and YWHAZ were considered the most suitable internal controls as they were stably expressed regardless of disease status according to both geNorm and NormFinder software; furthermore, geNorm indicated SDHA/HPRT, YWHAZ/GAPDH and SDHA/YWHAZ as the best reference gene combinations in control, disease-stressed and combined sheep groups, respectively.

            "text": "To date, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) is the most reliable and easy to perform technique to measure the expression level of a selected gene of interest (GOI) by quantifying mRNA transcripts. qRT-PCR is fast and the sensitivity of the method allows precise quantification of minimal differences in expression across a wide dynamic range even when working with limited amounts of starting material. However, several variables associated with the different steps of qRT-PCR experimental procedures can lead to considerable inter-sample variation and possibly to erroneous results: the different amount and quality of starting material; RNA integrity; efficiency in cDNA synthesis and PCR amplification; and differences between tissues or cells in overall transcriptional activity [1] . Among the strategies proposed to control for technical and sample variation in qRT-PCR experiments [2] , the use of reference genes is commonly accepted as the most reliable approach to normalize qRT-PCR and to reduce possible errors generated in the quantification of gene expression. In this normalization strategy, reference genes are used as internal controls and are submitted to the same experimental protocol of the GOI. The expression level measured for the target gene is then normalized according to the values of the internal controls. It is clear, therefore, that an ideal reference gene should be stably expressed within the samples to be compared irrespective of experimental conditions or external factors, otherwise the detection of small changes become unfeasible and unreliable. A number of studies have well assessed that genes classically thought to be stable for their ubiquitous expression and involvement in cell homeostasis (e.g., GAPDH, ACTB, 18S rRNA) are not always the best reference genes, as they show different behaviour across various cell types and tissues [3, 4] . Accordingly, a proper evaluation of several candidate genes should be performed before any gene expression study [2] .",

However, no specific information on whole blood is currently available. A reference gene for use in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was selected [9] , but this study was based on the analysis of the standard deviation of cycle threshold (C t ) and not on specifically designed algorithms. Nevertheless, blood is a readily accessible source of material for analysis and some attempts to identify gene expression markers by qRT-PCR in order to develop blood tests in sheep have been reported for prion diseases. For example, in 2001, Miele et al. discovered a novel erythroid-associated factor (ERAF) and demonstrated a dramatic decrease in expression of the specific transcript within rodent models of prion diseases, providing the first easily detectable molecular marker in a readily accessible tissue [10] . More recently, analysis of blood by qRT-PCR from sheep experimentally infected with scrapie revealed that the extent of differential expression of ERAF in peripheral ovine blood may be insufficient to provide a discriminatory diagnostic test [11] . However, the lack of a set of validated reference genes for sheep whole blood did not allow for the proper normalization of gene expression data and, in this study, glycophorin C (GYPC) was arbitrarily chosen as normalizer based on its higher expression in the human erythroid lineage. Moreover, the use of a single gene to normalise expression is no longer considered sufficient [12] [13] [14] [15] . Vandesompele et al. (2002) demonstrated that errors of up to 20-fold in expression data can be generated by the use of only a single reference gene [1] .",

The M values are used to rank genes on the basis of their stability: high M values indicate increased gene expression variability, whereas the most stable genes should exhibit M values <1.5 [1] . All studied genes reached acceptable stable expression with low M values, less than 1.5. Based on M value ranking, SDHA appeared to be the most stably expressed gene in control sheep with an average M value of 0.316, followed by YWHAZ and HPRT.

A cut-off value of 0.15 is usually considered acceptable; it indicates that the control gene combination ensures satisfactory stability and that an additional gene need not be included.

            "text": "To investigate the influence of the animal health status on the stability of the candidate reference genes, the analyses were performed in whole blood of control sheep and of sheep showing disease symptoms after clinical evaluation. Moreover, disease-stressed animals were sampled and analysed twice in order to monitor gene stability in disease-stressed sheep not only at different time points, but also under heat stress conditions, which, in association to disease status, really represent an extreme situation (see the Experimental Section for details on animal selection and sampling procedure). In all sheep groups, the results obtained with geNorm and Normfinder were consistent although not identical, as similarly reported elsewhere [19] [20] [21] [22] . SDHA and YWHAZ can be considered the most stably expressed genes in ovine whole blood ranking at the top positions in the control and disease-stressed sheep, both when they were analysed separately and when they were combined. SDHA and YWHAZ stability appears to be reliable as it was affected neither by disease status alone nor in association with heat stress. Moreover, geNorm indicated SDHA/YWHAZ as the best reference gene combination in the control and disease-stressed sheep joined datasets, a situation likely to fit most experimental contexts involving case and control animals; however, the SDHA/YWHAZ combination would be suitable for normalization of gene expression data also in studies carried out under physiological conditions, as these two genes demonstrated high stability in the control sheep group as well. Although data in sheep are still limited, SDHA appears to have good stability in this species as it was included in the reference genes required for reliable normalisation in several tissues (cerebrum, spleen, mesenteric lymph node and ileum). Similarly, YWHAZ was included in the optimal panel of reference genes to be used in the cerebellum, obex and ileum [5] . HPRT expression stability was evaluated only in the lung and pulmonary artery of brainstem death and control sheep, but it performed poorly as reference in both tissues on separate and combined analyses [7] . Actually, HPRT ranked as the third most stable gene of the control group in sheep whole blood, but its stability strongly decreased under disease conditions, emphasizing that proper validation of reference genes in a cell type or tissue of interest and under different experimental settings is mandatory before reporting qRT-PCR results. B2M showed stable expression in one study on human leukocytes from 13 healthy donors [1] . B2M also had stable expression in a large study in which 526 human whole blood samples represented healthy individuals and six disease groups [23] . In sheep, however, B2M is outperformed by other genes and demonstrates suboptimal suitability as reference gene in whole blood. In humans, GYPC expression is considerably higher in erythroid lineage cells than in non-erythroid cells [24] . GYPC was therefore used by Brown et al. (2007) to normalize qRT-PCR analyses of erythroid markers in sheep whole blood [11] . In our study, however, both geNorm and NormFinder classified GYPC in the bottom half of the stability ranking under both control and disease conditions, showing that ubiquitously expressed genes would provide a more relevant comparison for measuring erythroid gene expression. In control sheep, GAPDH resulted in being the gene with the highest degree of individual variation in expression level. This finding was not surprising, as GAPDH can be regulated under a large number of physiological states and is generally not considered a good reference gene [25, 26] . Nevertheless, GAPDH ranked as the second most stable gene in the disease-stressed and the combined sheep groups. Taylor et al. (2008) found that the levels of GAPDH transcription were the most stable of the genes tested in ovine peripheral blood mononuclear cells during infection with Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis [9] . This finding is consistent with our results indicating stability of GAPDH in whole blood under disease condition. However, it must be taken into account that Taylor's results could also be attributable to a characteristic of the specific cell type or to the fact that the study based its observations on analysis of the standard deviation of C t values and not on specifically designed algorithms.",

This aspect has been neglected in the previous works on reference gene validation in sheep, probably because of the lack of ovine genomic DNA sequences available in the public databases. Indeed, we were able to retrieve intron-spanning primers from previous publications for only three genes (PGK1, SDHA and G6PD) among those included in our study. Nevertheless, this approach is highly recommended in combination with DNAse I treatment to avoid/recognize co-amplification of contaminating genomic DNA [1] , since spurious PCR signals could affect the selection of reliable references by mimicking individual variation with lower stability scores. Also, when searching RTPrimerDB, a reference database for qRT-PCR primers [27] [28] [29] [30] , we noted that among 8329 real-time PCR primer sets for 5758 genes of 26 organisms available at the time of writing, only 16 SYBR Green assays were deposited under Ovis aries. Importantly, therefore, an additional outcome of our study is a set of validated primer sequences suitable for gene expression experiments based on SYBR Green chemistry to be carried out with other ovine tissues and cells.",

Specifically, they had chronic diarrhoea (n = 5), lameness (n = 2), abscesses (n = 2) and respiratory syndrome (n = 1). The blood samples from disease-stressed sheep were collected twice: the first sampling was carried out in August, when the environmental temperature was of 35 \u00b0C, and the second in September with an environmental temperature of 26 \u00b0C. Every sampling was preceded by clinical evaluation of sheep to confirm disease status. The blood samples were immediately transferred to the lab and submitted to nucleic acid isolation.",

PCR amplification was run on a Mx 3005P QPCR System (Stratagene) using 96-well optical plates under the following conditions: 10 min at 95 \u00b0C for polymerase activation, and 40 cycles of 3-segment amplification with 30 s at 95 \u00b0C (for denaturation), 30 s at 56-60 \u00b0C, and 40 s at 72 \u00b0C for elongation. Primer concentration and annealing temperatures were optimised to individual genes; specifications are available from the Authors upon request. A dissociation step was added after elongation to ensure that the desired amplicon was detected. The dissociation step eliminates non-specific fluorescence signal and ensures accurate quantification of the desired product. Finally, a melting curve was produced to confirm single gene-specific peaks and to detect primer/dimer formation by heating samples from 60 to 95 \u00b0C. PCR efficiencies were calculated using a relative standard curve derived from a pooled cDNA mixture (a 10-fold dilution series with five measuring points). All experiments were replicated twice for each gene with triplicate sample runs within each replication and a no-template control was included using water instead of cDNA.",

In sheep, analyses of expression stability of candidate reference genes are limited to a restricted range of tissues [5] [6] [7] [8] and data on ovine whole blood were still lacking. However, peripheral whole blood is attractive because of its accessibility and usefulness in monitoring several physiological and pathological conditions. As regards disease status, blood certainly represents the best tissue for in vivo test development since collection is non-invasive and easy to perform. For example, the identification of differentially expressed genes acting as indirect in vivo markers in blood would represent a major breakthrough for the diagnostics of non-conventional agents (like prions) which currently cannot be detected by standard methods as the diagnosis still rely on post mortem investigations. This study provides a panel of optimal control genes for use in qRT-PCR studies in sheep whole blood. The two softwares tested, based on different algorithms and analytical procedures, produced highly comparable results. SDHA and YWHAZ represent good reference genes for gene expression studies in sheep peripheral whole blood, unaffected by disease status and heat stress conditions, and the geometric mean of these two stable genes is an accurate normalization factor [1] . Our results may be useful for the identification of genes differentially expressed in a readily accessible tissue, with the potential of discovering new physiological and disease markers and as a tool to improve production traits (e.g., by identifying expression Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTLs) [39, 40] .",
