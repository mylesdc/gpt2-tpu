Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of MERS survivors who required hospitalization in Saudi Arabia during 2016-2017, approximately 1 year after diagnosis. The Short-Form General Health Survey 36 (SF-36) was administered by telephone interview to assess 8 quality of life domains for MERS survivors and a sample of survivors of severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) without MERS. We compared mean SF-36 scores of MERS and non-MERS SARI survivors using independent t-test, and compared categorical variables using chi-square test. Adjusted analyses were performed using multiple linear regression. Results: Of 355 MERS survivors, 83 were eligible and 78 agreed to participate. MERS survivors were younger than non-MERS SARI survivors (mean \u00b1 SD): (44.9 years \u00b112.9) vs (50.0 years \u00b113.6), p = 0.031. Intensive care unit (ICU) admissions were similar for MERS and non-MERS SARI survivors (46.2% vs. 57.1%), p = 0.20. After adjusting for potential confounders, there were no significant differences between MERS and non-MERS SARI survivors in physical component or mental component summary scores. MERS ICU survivors scored lower than MERS survivors not admitted to an ICU for physical function (p = 0.05), general health (p = 0.01), vitality (p = 0.03), emotional role (p = 0.03) and physical component summary (p < 0.02). Conclusions: Functional scores were similar for MERS and non-MERS SARI survivors. However, MERS survivors of critical illness reported lower quality of life than survivors of less severe illness. Efforts are needed to address the long-term medical and psychological needs of MERS survivors.",

As of March 31, 2019, 2399 laboratory-confirmed MERS cases, including 827 deaths (34.5%) worldwide have been reported to the World Health Organization (WHO [4] . The clinical presentation of MERS is variable, ranging from asymptomatic infection to critical illness and multiorgan failure requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission for mechanical ventilation, renal replacement therapy, and vasopressor support for refractory shock [5] [6] [7] [8] . A recent post-mortem study reported detection of MERS-CoV by transmission electron microscopy in the lungs, kidney, and muscle of a fatal case [9] . Lung pathology of a previous fatal case of MERS demonstrated diffuse alveolar damage without evidence of extrapulmonary spread [10] . MERS-CoV infection triggers specific CD4 and CD8 T-cell responses that may last up to 18-34 months following the primary infection [11, 12] . MERS severity and recovery has been correlated with CD4 T-cell response, levels of antibody and longevity, but not CD8 T-cell responses [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] .",

The SF-36 consists of 36 question that evaluates eight health domains: physical functioning (PF), social functioning (SF), role limitation due to physical problems (RP), role limitation due to emotional problems (RE), mental health (MH), bodily pain (BP), vitality (VT), and general health (GH) [23, 24] . These domains can be further represented as physical (PSC) and mental (MCS) component summary scales. Scores for each domain can range from 0 (worst) to 100 (best) with higher scores indicating better HRQoL [24] . The Arabic version of SF-36 has been validated in the Saudi Arabian population, and no significant mean differences between Arabic and English SF-36 questionnaires were observed [25] . Patients were interviewed using the English or Arabic version as needed of the Short-Form 36-item survey (SF-36) to assess the HRQoL.",

Due to the descriptive cross-sectional study design, any temporal relationship may be undetected; MERS could have a transient effect on survivors at discharge, and it is possible we were unable to detect these dynamic changes. Corticosteroid-induced myopathy, muscle wasting and weakness have been reported in survivors of ARDS at one-year follow up [30] . Since many MERS ICU patients have been treated with high-dose corticosteroids, sequelae from such therapy could contribute to reduced quality of life in survivors.

First, selection bias may be present; as the small study population may not be representative of all eligible Saudi MERS survivors -since the majority of survivors were unreachableand our non-MERS SARI controls were enrolled from only two hospitals in Saudi Arabia. Additionally, the number of non-MERS SARI controls was lower than MERS survivors. Second, we had limited medical information on potential predictors that may alter the reported quality of life scores. Specifically, we did not have information regarding the severity of illness such as APACHE II score, number of ventilator days, length of hospital stay, or use of sedatives or neuromuscular blocking agents which have been shown to affect long term outcomes. Third, there is a potential for recall bias since there was a significant difference in time from illness onset to interview time between MERS cases and non-MERS SARI controls; to reduce bias, we performed a multiple linear regression model to adjust for confounders. Lastly, we administered the SF-36 questionnaire by telephone and not in-person. However, telephone administration has been validated in previous studies and shown to be a reliable method when compared to a selfadministered survey [32, 33] . This cross-sectional observational study has provided preliminary information about the quality of life of MERS survivors. Assessment of functional limitation and exercise capacity is needed in MERS survivors to estimate the long-term burden of this illness. Prospective longitudinal studies measuring objective parameters such as; pulmonary function testing, 6-min walk test and detection of depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder with correlation with health status, will provide more informative data to understanding of the overall long term outcomes of MERS-CoV infection.",
