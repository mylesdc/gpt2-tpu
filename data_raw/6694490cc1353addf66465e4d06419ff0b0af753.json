Identification of the immune effectors responsible for injuring the brain during acute infection is necessary for the development of therapeutic strategies that reduce neuropathology but maintain immune control of the virus.

Flow cytometry of brain-infiltrating leukocytes collected from LysM: GFP reporter mice confirmed the identification of neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes in the brain. Microscopy of sections from infected LysM:GFP mice showed that infiltrating cells were concentrated in the hippocampal formation. Immunostaining confirmed that neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes were localized to the hippocampal formation at 12 h after infection. Immunodepletion of inflammatory monocytes and neutrophils but not of neutrophils only resulted in preservation of hippocampal neurons. Immunodepletion of inflammatory monocytes also preserved cognitive function as assessed by the Morris water maze. Conclusions: Neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes rapidly and robustly responded to Theiler's virus infection by infiltrating the brain. Inflammatory monocytes preceded neutrophils, but both cell types were present in the hippocampal formation at a timepoint that is consistent with a role in triggering hippocampal pathology. Depletion of inflammatory monocytes and neutrophils with the Gr1 antibody resulted in hippocampal neuroprotection and preservation of cognitive function. Specific depletion of neutrophils with the 1A8 antibody failed to preserve neurons, suggesting that inflammatory monocytes are the key effectors of brain injury during acute picornavirus infection of the brain. These effector cells may be important therapeutic targets for immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive therapies aimed at reducing or preventing central nervous system pathology associated with acute viral infection.",

            "text": "Viral infection of the central nervous system (CNS) may induce clinically relevant outcomes that range from coma, paralysis, and death to persistent cognitive impairment, seizures, and epilepsy [1] . Many viral infections of the CNS are acute, with viral clearance mediated by the adaptive arm of the immune system. However, the relationship between the delayed adaptive antigen-specific T and B cell-mediated response that eventually controls and eliminates the viral pathogen and the rapid but largely non-specific innate immune system response is poorly understood. Indeed, different viruses and different hosts exhibit disparate relationships between the innate and adaptive response to infection. For example, McGavern and colleagues have shown in mice infected with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus that pathogenic neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes are recruited to the brain by antiviral CD8 + T cells. Depletion of the CD8 + T cell response reduced the neutrophil and inflammatory monocyte burden in the CNS and delayed pathogenesis [2] . In contrast, Bergmann and colleagues observed that neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes were the first leukocytes to infiltrate the brain in mice infected with the non-lethal neurotropic JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus (JHMV) [3] , and depletion or blockade of monocytes impaired subsequent T cell infiltration into the brain parenchyma [4] . Lane and colleagues also observed a very early neutrophil response to CNS infection with JHMV, and in contrast to the Bergmann et al. findings implicating monocytes, they found that blocking neutrophil entry into the CNS resulted in impairment of the subsequent T cell response [5] . Finally, Lokensgard and colleagues observed an early neutrophil and inflammatory monocyte response in the brain following infection with herpes simplex virus 1 and this response preceded lymphocyte infiltration by a week [6] . Overall, the common denominator in all of these studies was the ensuing neuropathology triggered by infiltrating neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes.",

Indeed, hippocampal pyramidal neurons were clearly injured at 1 day after infection [8] . We have hypothesized that neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes, as part of an early wave of first responders to infection, are responsible for hippocampal injury and loss of memory function observed in TMEV-infected mice, but the relative contribution of each population to this injury was unclear. In the present study we phenotyped the brain-infiltrating leukocyte population at several acute time points after infection with TMEV. We found that neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes were present in the brain within 12 h of infection, indicating that in this model system infiltration of such innate effectors is a hyperacute response. Furthermore, we found that the absence of an inflammatory monocyte response but not the absence of a neutrophil response resulted in neuroprotection and cognitive preservation.",

Using our established protocol for isolating a highly enriched population of leukocytes from the brain [9] , we observed a robust population of CD45 hi cells in TMEV-infected mice at 18 hpi ( Figure 2B ) that are not present in the brain of sham-infected ( Figure 2A ) or uninfected mice (data not shown). Further phenotyping revealed that most of the CD45 hi cells in the brain-infiltrating leukocytes (BILs) were CD11b positive, albeit at two different intensity levels. We routinely distinguished CD11b ++ and CD11b + ++ populations ( Figure 2C , D). Critically, these populations could also be distinguished by levels of surface staining with the Gr1 antibody ( Figure 2C ) and the 1A8 antibody ( Figure 2D ), such that CD11b ++ cells were positive for Gr1 but negative for 1A8 and CD11b +++ cells were positive for both markers ( Figure 2C , D). Likewise, the population of CD45 hi cells could be distinguished by surface F4/80 expression, with some F4/80 + Figure 1 Histological evidence of rapid immune cell infiltration into the hippocampus of mice acutely infected with Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV).

In contrast, the 1A8 antigen is explicitly Ly6G and is only observed on neutrophils and granulocytes but not on monocytes or macrophages [15, 16] . On the basis of our findings, we have established the following definitions, which are also elaborated below: CD45 hi CD11b ++ F4/80 + Gr1 + 1A8cells are inflammatory monocytes; CD45 hi CD11b +++ F4/ 80 -Gr1 + 1A8 + cells are neutrophils.

Historically, Gr1 staining of the Ly6C/G heteroantigen was used to define neutrophils. More recently, it has become clear that Gr1 marks both neutrophils and a population of inflammatory monocytes. The availability of the 1A8 marker, which only recognizes Ly6G and only labels neutrophils, now allows for better resolution of these populations [15, 19] . In order to further validate our phenotype definitions, we also examined the Ly6 series in blood at 18 hpi and compared the profile to BILs from the same animal ( Figure 4 ). In general, the staining for Gr1 (Ly6C/G) ( Figure 4A -D) and 1A8 (Ly6G) ( Figure 4E -H) was higher on the brain-infiltrating cells as compared to the same populations in the blood. Of note, brain-infiltrating inflammatory monocytes exhibited elevated Gr1 staining compared to brain-infiltrating neutrophils ( Figure 4B ). We were unable to identify a population of inflammatory monocytes in the blood in the infected mice, suggesting either that these cells are not circulating at this time or that so many have been recruited to the brain that the Figure 2 Flow cytometric assessment of the infiltrate present in the brain of mice acutely infected with Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV). TMEV-infected (B-G) or shaminfected (A) mice were killed at 18 h post infection (hpi). Brain was collected fresh and processed for the isolation of brain-infiltrating leukocytes (BILs). BILs were stained with antibodies against CD45, CD11b, F4/80, Gr1 (Ly6C/G) and 1A8 (Ly6G) and analyzed by flow cytometry. No CD45 hi cells were observed in sham-infected mice (A). In contrast, TMEV-infected mice exhibited a large population of CD45 hi cells at 18 hpi. Analysis of the CD45 hi cells in BILs from infected mice revealed the presence of CD11b ++ cells that were also strongly positive for the Gr1 antigen (C) and CD11b +++ cells that were positive for both the Gr1 antigen (C) and the 1A8 antigen (D). In addition, a population of the Gr1 + cells was also positive for F4/80 (E); no 1A8 + cells were F4/80 + (F). Combined gating revealed that CD45 hi CD11b ++ Gr1 + cells were also F4/80 + while CD45 hi CD11b +++ Gr1 + cells were F4/80 -. Quantitation of neutrophils (CD45 hi 1A8 + Gr1 + CD11b +++ F4/80 -) and inflammatory monocytes (CD45 hi 1A8 -Gr1 + CD11b ++ F4/80 + ) in BILs from 10 individual mice revealed that about 80% of the CD45 hi cells belonged to one of these populations (G). Error bars in (G) represent 95% confidence intervals; black circles represent individual animals; 10 mice per group were analyzed and the flow plots in (A-F) are representative.",

Surface 1A8 labeling was increased on neutrophils that had entered the brain ( Figure 4F ) as compared to circulating neutrophils ( Figure 4E ), suggesting that this molecule may be upregulated as neutrophils home to target tissues. Finally, inflammatory monocytes exhibited higher surface levels of 7/4 (Ly6B-specific) and AL-21 (Ly6C-specific) staining as compared to neutrophils in the brain ( Figure 4J , L, N, P). Based on these observations, in addition to differential surface CD11b, Gr1, and 1A8 staining, we can further distinguish brain-infiltrating monocytes from brain-infiltrating neutrophils on the basis of surface expression of the 7/4 and AL-21 antigens. Brain-resident microglia/macrophages were consistently negative for all Ly6 antigens (not shown).",

The GFP neg population in the 18 hpi BILs exhibited a CD11b + Gr1 -1A8immunophenotype consistent with microglia (resident macrophages) (Figure 5F , I). The clear distinction between GFP + and GFPcells in the BILs population was further exploited by assessing the physical location of infiltrating GFP + cells in vibratome sections of brain from 18 hpi mice ( Figure 6 ). We found that the majority of GFP + cells were located in proximity to the hippocampal formation ( Figure 6A) , with high concentrations of labeled cells just superior and lateral to the hippocampus proper. Higher magnification also showed dense clusters of GFP + cells in the corpus callosum and alveus ( Figure 6B , C, E) and in the hippocampal fissure (Figure 6D , E). This suggests that the white matter tracts overlying the hippocampus and the vasculature-rich hippocampal fissure are primary sites for infiltration of neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes. These observations are consistent with the histological analyses shown in Figure 1 and further support a model in which neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes are rapid responders to brain infection. Of note, the robust localization of these cells to the hippocampal formation is consistent with our previously published observations that the hippocampus is the primary site of pathology following TMEV infection and that this damage is not a direct result of the virus but is rather a bystander phenomenon [8] .",

Analysis of BILs at 6 hpi showed a small but inconsistent population of inflammatory monocytes (data not shown), indicating that infiltration began in earnest between 6 and 12 hpi. A small population of neutrophils was present in the BILs by 12 hpi (Figure 7E , F). By 18 hpi the density of both neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes had increased ( Figure 7H , I). By 24 hpi the number of neutrophils continued to increase while the number of inflammatory monocytes decreased relative to 18 hpi ( Figure 7K , L). Cell counts and relative percent of each cell population are provided in Table 1 . Immunostaining brain sections at these time points revealed a growing population of CD45 + cells in the hippocampal fissure and in the superior white matter tracts ( Figure 8A , B, F, G, K, L, P, Q). Many of these cells were CD11b + ( Figure 8C , H, M, R) and a strong population of Gr1 + cells was observed at 24 hpi ( Figure 8N ) but was greatly decreased by 48 hpi ( Figure 8S ).",

            "text": "We have previously hypothesized that the innate immune response to acute TMEV infection mediates subsequent hippocampal injury that leads to cognitive deficits [8] . In order to distinguish the role of inflammatory monocytes from neutrophils in this injury, we immunodepleted these populations and assessed hippocampal pathology ( Figure 9 ) and cognitive performance ( Figure 10 ). Neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes were simultaneously depleted by daily treatment from -2 dpi to +2 dpi with intraperitoneal injection of purified RB6-8C5 (500 \u03bcg/day; rat anti-Gr1). Neutrophils but not inflammatory monocytes were depleted by daily injection from -2 dpi to +2 dpi of purified 1A8 (500 \u03bcg/ day; mouse anti-Ly6G). Controls received daily injections of PBS. BILs prepared at 18 hpi from control mice showed 4,898 \u00b1 191 inflammatory monocytes and 1,515 \u00b1 192 neutrophils ( Figure 9A, D) ; 22.9% \u00b1 1.0% of the BILs were CD45 hi . Control mice showed robust hippocampal pathology at 7 dpi as assessed by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) histology ( Figure 9G ) and immunostaining for the neuronal marker NeuN ( Figure 9J ). Regions of no or weak NeuN staining in the CA1 layer in Figure 9J represent neuronal dropout or pyknotic neurons. In contrast, RB6-treated mice had only 106 \u00b1 34 inflammatory monocytes and 11 \u00b1 3 neutrophils in the 18 hpi BILs (Figure 9B , E) and only 6.7% \u00b1 0.4% of the BILs were CD45 hi . Moreover, the hippocampus was completely preserved in these mice at 7 dpi ( Figure 9H , K). The thick, multi-cell-layered NeuN staining in the CA1 layer in Figure 9K is indistinguishable from Figure 5 Assessment of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) + brain infiltrate in Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV)infected LysM:eGFP mice. Flow cytometric analysis of brain-infiltrating leukocytes (BILs) collected at 18 hpi from LysM:eGFP reporter mice (Lys: GFP) and from wild-type littermates (wt) (C) revealed the presence of distinct GFP hi and GFP mid populations in the reporter mice (B). Further characterization of CD11b, Gr1, and 1A8 staining showed that the GFP hi population was composed of CD11b +++ Gr1 + 1A8 + neutrophils, the GFP mid population was composed of CD11b ++ Gr1 + 1A8inflammatory monocytes, and the GFP neg population contained CD11b + Gr1 -1A8microglia (resident macrophages). (D-I) are derived from the gated populations in (B). These findings confirm our other observations and indicate the presence of both neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes in the brain at 18 hpi. Results are representative of more than 10 mice. Essentially no Gr1 + (B) or 1A8 + cells (C) were observed in uninfected mice and the forward scatter (FSC) vs side scatter (SSC) plot showed a clear absence of the larger, more granular cells present at later time points (A). In contrast, TMEV-infected mice exhibited both CD11b ++ Gr1 + inflammatory monocytes and CD11b +++ 1A8 + neutrophils as early as 12 hpi (D-E), with inflammatory monocytes outnumbering neutrophils (E, F). Both of these populations increased in number by 18 hpi (G-I). Neutrophils continued to increase in the infiltrate by 24 hpi (K, L) while inflammatory monocytes began to decrease at this time point (K, L). The granular profile of neutrophils was also clearly present by FSC and SSC at 24 hpi (J). Results are representative of more than 20 mice at each timepoint. Table 1 Quantitation of brain infiltrating inflammatory monocytes and neutrophils (brain-infiltrating leukocytes (BILs)) at 12, 18, and 24 h post infection (hpi) RB6: q(28,3) = 19.923, P < 0.001). However, while treatment with 1A8 almost completely abrogated the neutrophil response in the 18 hpi BILs (66 \u00b1 24 neutrophils; control vs 1A8: q(28,2) = 17.917, P < 0.001) ( Figure 9F ) there was an actual increase in the number of inflammatory monocytes (6,251 \u00b1 237 inflammatory monocytes; control vs 1A8: q(28,2) = 19.194, P < 0.001) ( Figure 9C ). The percentage of CD45 hi cells in the BILs following 1A8 treatment was 23.4% \u00b1 1.3% (control vs 1A8: q (28,2) = 1.064, P = 0.458; RB6 vs 1A8: q(28,3) = 34.188, P < 0.001). Critically, the hippocampus was robustly injured in the 1A8-treated mice ( Figure 9I, L) . Finally, the absence of hippocampal injury in the RB6-treated mice led to the preservation of cognitive function as assessed by Morris water maze ( Figure 10 ). Infected, RB6-treated mice showed the same ability to learn in the maze as uninfected mice (F(2,28) = 15.508, P < 0.001; uninfected vs RB6-treated: q(28,2) = 1.089, P = 0.441) while infected, control-treated mice were completely unable to learn to navigate the maze (uninfected vs infected, control-treated: q(28,2) = 14.826, P < 0.001; RB6-treated vs control-treated: q(28,3) = 15.519, P < 0.001) [1, 8] . We interpret these findings as strong support for our hypothesis that neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes are first responders to TMEV infection in the brain and that inflammatory monocytes are primarily responsible for hippocampal damage and loss of cognitive function.",

            "text": "In contrast to other viral models in which neutrophils apparently do not infiltrate the CNS until recruited by other immune populations such as lymphocytes [2] , our findings suggest that neutrophils are one of the earliest responders in the TMEV model. As in other viral model systems [4] [5] [6] , we predict that these cells will serve to prime the way for the adaptive response. In addition, our time course findings suggest that inflammatory monocytes precede neutrophils into the brain and the 1A8 depletion experiments show that inflammatory monocytes are competent to enter the CNS in the absence of neutrophils. Indeed, in the absence of neutrophils there was a significant increase in the number of inflammatory monocytes in the brain at 18 hpi, suggesting that neutrophils may exert a regulatory effect that slows or reverses inflammatory monocyte accumulation in the brain. The depletion experiments also show that inflammatory monocytes are required for the loss of CA1 pyramidal neurons that occurs in the first few days of infection [8] while neutrophils appear to be dispensable for this injury and the downstream consequences. Ongoing experiments will assess the impact of inflammatory monocytes versus neutrophils in the recruitment of the adaptive immune system and eventual control of the virus. Likewise, ongoing experiments in chemokine receptor knockout hosts will determine the relative impact of different chemotactic pathways in the separate and integrated neutrophil and inflammatory monocyte responses.",

We hypothesize that these effector cells, and inflammatory monocytes in particular, may be important therapeutic targets for immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive therapies aimed at reducing or preventing CNS pathology associated with acute viral infection. Figure 10 Immunodepletion of inflammatory monocytes preserves cognitive function in the Morris water maze. Uninfected mice, untreated Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV)-infected mice (No Tx), and infected mice treated with RB6-8C5 to deplete inflammatory monocytes and neutrophils (RB6 Tx) were assessed in the Morris water maze starting at 14 dpi. Following 3 days of training on a visible platform, latency to hidden platform acquisition was measured over six trials each day for 6 days. Pretesting latency to the hidden platform is shown (PRE) and compared to the latency to acquisition during the sixth and final trial of each day (DAY1 to DAY6). The uninfected mice readily learned the maze and navigated to the escape platform in less than 10 s by day 5. RB6-8C5 immunodepleted mice performed as well as uninfected controls. In contrast, the infected mice that were not depleted were unable to learn the maze at any point during the testing phase. These observations are consistent with the hippocampal pathology findings in Figure 9 . Results are from 10 mice in each group.",
