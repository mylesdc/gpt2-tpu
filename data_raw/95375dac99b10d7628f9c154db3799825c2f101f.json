            "text": "CD13 is a membrane glycoprotein with aminopeptidase activity, expressed on several cell types, including myeloid cells (dendritic cells, monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, etc.). CD13 participates in several functions such as proteolytic regulation of bioactive peptides, viral receptor, angiogenesis, and tumor metastasis. CD13 has also been proposed to participate in cell adhesion, as crosslinking of CD13 by certain CD13-specific antibodies induces homotypic aggregation of monocytes and heterotypic adhesion of monocytes to endothelial cells. We generated two monoclonal antibodies (mAbs C and E) that block homotypic aggregation of U-937 monocytic cells induced by CD13-specific mAb 452. Moreover, the mAbs cause detachment of cells whose aggregation was induced by CD13 crosslinking. Both mAbs also inhibit heterotypic adhesion of U-937 monocytes to endothelial cells. mAbs C and E recognize membrane CD13 but bind to epitopes different from that recognized by mAb 452. Crosslinking of CD13 by mAb C or E is required to inhibit adhesion, as monovalent Fab fragments are not sufficient. Thus, C and E antibodies recognize a distinct epitope on CD13, and binding to this epitope interferes with both CD13-mediated cell adhesion and enzymatic activity. These antibodies may represent important tools to study cell-cell interactions mediated by CD13 in physiological and pathological conditions.",

APN preferentially removes N-terminal neutral amino acids from unsubstituted oligopeptides, amides, or arylamides. Through its peptidase activity, it is known to participate in regulation of the activity of various neuropeptides, as well as vasoactive and chemotactic peptides. APN has been also shown to participate in several other processes, like differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, motility, chemotaxis, antigen presentation, and tumor cell invasion, among others [3] . Participation of APN in these processes not always depends on its peptidase activity. In 1989, Look et al. established the identity of APN with the myeloid marker CD13 [4] .",

            "text": "2 BioMed Research International CD13 is considered a moonlighting protein, because it has multiple functions that are apparently not related mechanistically. Along with its enzymatic activity, CD13 also participates in angiogenesis [13, 14] , as a receptor for some group 1 coronaviruses [15] , and in cholesterol uptake [16] . Also, we have previously reported that CD13 is involved in adhesion of monocytes [17] and that CD13 is a phagocytic receptor [18] . Participation of CD13 in adhesion processes of monocytes was demonstrated by showing that crosslinking of CD13 with a monoclonal antibody (mAb) (clone 452) resulted in the homotypic aggregation (HA) of U-937 human monocytic cells through a signal transduction dependent process, which required metabolic energy [17] . Later, it was shown that CD13 crosslinking by mAb 452 also induces monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells [19] . In the later study, it was suggested that CD13 directly mediates cell-cell interactions, as adhesion can be blocked by soluble CD13, and activated monocytes can adhere to immobilized purified recombinant CD13 [19] . Demonstration of the involvement of CD13 in mediating monocyte adhesion in vivo was given by Ghosh et al. [20] , who reported that peritoneal monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells were significantly decreased in inflammatory exudates from CD13-KO mice compared to wild-type mice. They also showed, using a model of adoptive transfer of myeloid cells from wild-type and CD13-KO mice into either wild-type or CD13-deficient mice, that thioglycollate-induced migration to the peritoneal cavity was significantly reduced in the absence of CD13 expression in either monocytes or endothelial cells. Subramani et al. [21] found that, in U-937 monocytic cells, CD13 clustering induces adhesion through a mechanism that involves activation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), Src, and ERK protein kinases and phosphorylation of a tyrosine in the short cytoplasmic tail of CD13. Mutation of this tyrosine, or the use of chemical inhibitors of tyrosine kinases, abrogates cell adhesion to endothelial cells in vitro and impairs monocyte trafficking to the inflamed peritoneum in vivo [21] .",

Immunizations were given every two weeks during 2 months. Two additional intraperitoneal immunizations with aggregated cells were applied 3 and 4 days before the fusion. Animal handling and sacrifice were conducted under the guidelines established by the Committee on the Care and Use of Experimental Animals of the Instituto de Investigaciones Biom\u00e9dicas, Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico (UNAM). Hybridomas were selected based on the ability of the secreted mAb to inhibit homotypic aggregation (HA) of U-937 cells induced by mAb 452 [17] . For these assays, U-937 cells (1 \u00d7 10 5 cells in 50 l RPMI 1640) were placed in flat-bottom wells of a 96-well culture plate, an equal volume of medium or supernatant from the hybridomas was added to each well, and cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 \u2218 C. Activating mAb 452 was then added (at a final concentration of 1 g/ml) and cells were incubated for two additional hours. Inhibition of aggregation by supernatants was detected visually in an Axiovert 25 inverted microscope (Zeiss, Germany). Hybridomas secreting antibodies able to inhibit HA were selected for cloning by limiting dilution, expanded, and characterized. Isotype of the monoclonal antibodies was determined using the mouse immunoglobulin isotyping kit (Invitrogen, CA, USA). MAb C is an IgG1 and mAb E an IgG2b.

Lysates of U-937 cells were immunoprecipitated with mAbs C, E, and 452, or a control IgG. Immunoprecipitates were resolved in SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Each blot was probed with the corresponding mAb and a secondary antibody. The most prominent of the specific bands in the immunoprecipitates of mAbs C, E, and 452 was a band of 160 kDa. These 160 kDa bands immunoprecipitated by each of the three mAbs (C, E, and 452) were recognized by mAb 452 and also by mAbs C and E (Figure 2 (a) shows recognition by mAb C of 160 kDa bands immunoprecipitated by the each of three mAbs). This suggested that mAbs C and E recognize the same protein as mAb 452, that is, APN/CD13. To corroborate the identity of the 160 kDa band precipitated by the three mAbs, we extracted the 160 kDa protein immunoprecipitated by mAbs C, E, or 452, directly from slices of the polyacrylamide gel. The extracted proteins were digested with trypsin and analyzed by MALDI TOF/TOF spectrometry. The results were analyzed with the MASCOT software. This analysis identified APN/CD13 as the immunoprecipitated protein, with scores of 175 for the band precipitated by mAb 452, 274 for the band precipitated by mAb C, and 504 for the one precipitated by mAb E. The minimal score for a positive identification using this strategy is a score of 35.",

The finding that, in contrast to mAb 452 which has a very small effect on APN enzymatic activity, both mAbs C and E inhibited the enzymatic activity considerably might suggest that mAbs C and E bind to a different epitope than 452. In order to determine if the different mAbs bind to different epitopes, we performed competition experiments. First, we verified that purified unlabeled mAbs C and E bind to U-937 cells at similar levels as mAbs 452 and WM15 (Figure 3(a) ). Then, we tested the ability of unlabeled mAbs WM-15, C, E, and 452 or a control IgG to inhibit the binding of FITC-labeled mAbs 452, C, and E (Figures 3(b) , 3(c), and 3(d)). As expected, binding of mAb 452-FITC was inhibited by mAb 452. However, none of the mAbs WM-15, C, or E, or a control IgG, modified the binding of mAb 452 to the cells (Figure 3(b) ). Correspondingly, mAb 452 did not affect binding of FITC-labeled mAb C (Figure 3(c) ) or FITC-labeled mAb E (Figure 3(d) ) to the cells. These results demonstrate that mAb C and mAb E bind to epitopes on CD13 that are different from the epitope recognized by mAb 452. Interestingly, mAb C and mAb E inhibit each other's binding as efficiently as the corresponding unlabeled mAb, suggesting that these two antibodies bind to the same or to very closely located epitopes on CD13.",

As shown in Figures 4(a) and 4(b) (and supplementary Figure 1 ), binding of mAbs C or E to CD13 did not induce changes in CD13 expression on the cell membrane. We conducted the opposite experiments, incubating the cells with mAb 452 at 4 or at 37 \u2218 C, fixing immediately, and evaluating binding of anti-CD13 mAb C-FITC. When cells were incubated with mAb 452 at 37 \u2218 C, we found a decrease of 25% in the binding of mAb C-FITC (Figure 4 (d) and supplementary Figure 1 ) or E-FITC (not shown). This decrease, however, is not statistically significant. Since the decrease is not evident when incubation with mAb 452 is carried out at 4 \u2218 C (Figure 4(c) ), it is possible that it reflects a certain amount of CD13 internalization induced by CD13 crosslinking by mAb 452. However, further experiments are required to clarify this issue. CD13 [17] . Therefore, we sought to determine if binding of mAb C or mAb E to their specific epitope on CD13 is sufficient for inhibition of HA, or if crosslinking of CD13 by these mAbs is required. We performed experiments to evaluate the inhibition of HA by Fab fragments of the inhibitory mAbs, alone or after crosslinking with F(ab) 2 fragments of goat anti-mouse Ig ( Figure 5 ). The results indicated that incubation of U-937 monocytes with Fab fragments of mAbs C and E clustered with F(ab) 2 fragments of goat anti-mouse Ig is able to inhibit HA as efficiently as the intact mAbs ( Figure 1 ), but monovalent Fab fragments do not inhibit HA at any of the concentrations tested ( Figure 5 ). 2+ and Tyrosine Phosphorylation of CD13. CD13 crosslinking by specific monoclonal antibodies is able to induce signal transduction events, including a rise in intracellular Ca 2+ ions and tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins [21, 23] . In order to compare the ability to induce signal transduction of HA-inhibitory mAbs C and E with that of HA-inducing mAb 452, we evaluated changes in intracellular Ca 2+ ions induced by each of the mAbs. We loaded U-937 cells with the Ca 2+ -sensitive dyes Fluo-3 and Fura Red and monitored changes in intracellular Ca 2+ after stimulation with intact anti-CD13 mAb 452, mAb C, or mAb E (2 g/ml) followed by crosslinking of the bound mAbs by addition of F(ab) 2 fragments of goat antimouse Ig (12 g/ml), to induce further crosslinking of CD13 ( Figure 6 ). Bivalent mAb 452 induces a very rapid increase in intracellular Ca 2+ (reaching a maximum in less than 15 sec followed by a gradual decrease) even without further crosslinking by a secondary goat anti-mouse Ig. Addition of a secondary antibody does not affect the gradual decline of intracellular Ca 2+ . Both mAb C and mAb E are also able to induce a fast rise in the intracellular concentration of Ca 2+ , which after an initial peak declines to a plateau higher than the basal levels. Addition of goat anti-mouse Ig secondary antibodies induced a further increase in the concentration of Ca 2+ ions. As positive control we determined the effect of the anti-Fc RI mAb 32.2, which by itself was not able to induce a significant increase in intracellular Ca 2+ , but efficiently induced an increase after crosslinking with secondary F(ab) 2 fragments of goat anti-mouse Ig, as has been previously reported [24] . Treatment of U-937 with secondary antibody only, or with a control IgG and secondary antibody, did not result in a calcium signal.",

Stimulation of U-937 cells with mAb 452 induced a fivefold increase in the attachment of monocytes to endothelial cells, whereas treatment with mAbs C and E did not induce monocyte adhesion (Figure 8(a) ).

These later functions include endocytic processes such as cholesterol uptake and entry of certain group 1 coronavirus into cells, as well as participation in cell adhesion and transendothelial migration of monocytes [14, 19, 20] . The ability of CD13 to mediate phagocytosis is also independent of its peptidase activity [18] . The mechanisms by which CD13 participates in processes that are independent of its enzymatic activity are not clearly defined. However, it is known that crosslinking of CD13 by specific monoclonal antibodies initiates signal transduction events, such as a rise in the intracytoplasmic concentration of Ca 2+ ions, activation of intracellular protein kinases, and phosphorylation of Tyr 6 in the cytoplasmic portion of CD13 [21, 26] . Thus, it is likely that at least some of these functions depend on CD13 mediating transmembrane signals, as has been shown for CD13-mediated cell adhesion and phagocytosis, which are inhibited by pharmacological inhibitors of tyrosine kinases [17, 18, 21] .",

MAbs C and E recognize a 160 kDa protein that was identified as Aminopeptidase N/CD13 by mass spectrometry. The conclusion that both mAbs bind to CD13 is supported by the observations that both C and E immunoprecipitate the same protein as mAb 452, and their pattern of binding to cells is similar to that of mAb 452: they bind specifically to cells expressing CD13 (U-937, THP-1, HMEC-1, human monocytes from healthy donors) but showed a reduced binding to THP-1 L2 cells (THP-1 cells with reduced expression of CD13). Neither mAb 452 nor mAbs C and E bind to HEK-293 cells, but the three of them bind very efficiently to HEK-293 cells transfected to express human CD13 (HEK-ANPEP cells). Competition experiments showed that the epitope recognized by mAbs C and E on CD13 is different than the one recognized by mAb 452. Interestingly, mAbs C and E seem to bind to the same or to very closely located epitopes, as they inhibit each other's binding, and this could be related to their almost identical biological effects.

Since crosslinking of CD13 by mAb 452 induces monocyte adhesion to CD13-expressing cells very efficiently, we evaluated if it could also promote cell binding to fibronectin. However, in our assay conditions, neither U-937 nor THP-1 monocytic cells showed significant binding to fibronectincoated wells, and crosslinking of CD13 by mAb 452 was unable to induce adhesion of these cells to fibronectin (not shown).

In our assays, parental HEK-293 cells showed insignificant binding to fibronectin-coated plates, but transfection of HEK-293 cells for expression of human CD13/APN resulted in a significant increase in binding. In this system, crosslinking of CD13 by mAb 452 did not result in increased cell binding. In contrast, both mAbs C and E, and to a lesser extent mAbs 452 and WM-15, were able to significantly inhibit cell binding to fibronectin. These results suggest that CD13 mediated cell-cell adhesion (which is induced by mAb 452) involves a different mechanism than the one responsible for CD13 binding to fibronectin (which can be inhibited by mAb 452).",

            "text": "Although mAbs C and E bind to CD13 at epitopes different from that recognized by mAb 452, CD13 crosslinking by all three mAbs induces signal transduction, as demonstrated by the sharp and significant increase in the intracellular concentration of Ca 2+ ions and the induction of CD13 phosphorylation induced by the three mAbs. Since mAbs C and E do not induce CD13 internalization, and they do not impede binding of mAb 452, this opens the question of the mechanism by which crosslinking of CD13 by mAb 452 induces HA of monocytes and heterotypic adhesion of monocytes to endothelial cells, whereas crosslinking by mAbs C and E does not induce but, on the contrary, inhibit these adhesion phenomena. We suggest that all our observations could be explained by proposing that the region of CD13 involved in cell adhesion is different from the one involved in binding to NGR motifs. This is consistent with the finding of Ghosh et al. [20] , who demonstrated that cell-cell adhesion is mediated by the C terminus of the CD13 molecule (corresponding to 50% of domain VI and domain VII), while the NGR motif binds at the catalytically active site, which is known to be located in a cavity limited by the four extracellular domains (domains IV-VII). We further propose that crosslinking of CD13 by mAb 452 induces a conformation in which the sites on the C terminal half of the molecule that are involved in cell-cell adhesion are exposed and able to mediate interaction with other CD13 molecules on a neighboring cell. Of note, this conformation of CD13 is not the basal one, as cell adhesion is only induced after CD13 crosslinking by certain mAbs (and presumably by a putative CD13 ligand in vivo). On the other hand, CD13 crosslinking by mAbs C and E induces dimers with a conformation in which the sites involved in cell-cell adhesion are not exposed. Further support for the hypothesis that the sites involved in cell-cell adhesion are not the same as those involved in binding to fibronectin and NGR motifs comes from the fact that binding of CD13 to fibronectin and NGR motifs is not favored, but rather slightly inhibited, after crosslinking by mAb 452. The conformation imposed by mAbs C and E more strongly inhibits interactions of CD13 with fibronectin, NGR motifs, or substrates, and thus these mAbs are good inhibitors of the enzymatic activity. Distinct conformations of membrane receptors aggregates imposed by different monoclonal antibodies that result in distinct cellular responses have been observed for monoclonal antibodies specific for the Fc RI on mast cells [27] .",

            "text": "The observation that all three mAbs are equally able to induce signal transduction after crosslinking CD13 suggests that aggregation of CD13, and not a specific conformational change, is the critical event necessary to initiate signal transduction. Resolution of the crystallographic structure of CD13/APN [5] revealed that CD13 monomers could exist in either an open or a closed conformation. It was proposed that changes in the distance between the intracellular portions of CD13 when dimers are formed by monomers in an open/open or in a closed/closed conformation (102 versus 54\u00c5) could be a mechanism used by CD13 to transmit signals across the membrane. Although it is possible that, in aggregates formed by the three mAbs, the intracellular portions of different CD13 molecules are at distances suitable for signal initiation, it is also possible that formation of stable CD13 aggregates is a sufficient signal for initiating transmembrane signaling, as is the case for several receptors of the immune system, in which conformational changes in the extracellular domains of the receptor are not reflected in conformational changes in the cytoplasmic domains, and it is just the aggregation of the intracellular portions which initiates signaling. Resolution of the structure of signaling-competent CD13 aggregates would be necessary to resolve this issue. In summary, although we propose that the conformation of the large extracellular portion of CD13 is different depending on the specific epitope recognized by the different mAbs, aggregation of transmembrane and cytoplasmic segments of CD13 is sufficient to initiate signal transduction.",
