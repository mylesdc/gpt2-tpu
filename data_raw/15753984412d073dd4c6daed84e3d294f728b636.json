            "text": "Coxsackieviruses are enteric viruses that frequently infect humans. To examine coxsackievirus pathogenesis, we orally inoculated mice with the coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) Nancy strain. Using HeLa cell plaque assays with agar overlays, we noticed that some fecal viruses generated plaques >100 times as large as inoculum viruses. These large-plaque variants emerged following viral replication in several different tissues. We identified a single amino acid change, N63Y, in the VP3 capsid protein that was sufficient to confer the large-plaque phenotype. Wild-type CVB3 and N63Y mutant CVB3 had similar plaque sizes when agarose was used in the overlay instead of agar. We determined that sulfated glycans in agar inhibited plaque formation by wildtype CVB3 but not by N63Y mutant CVB3. Furthermore, N63Y mutant CVB3 bound heparin, a sulfated glycan, less efficiently than wild-type CVB3 did. While N63Y mutant CVB3 had a growth defect in cultured cells and reduced attachment, it had enhanced replication and pathogenesis in mice. Infection with N63Y mutant CVB3 induced more severe hepatic damage than infection with wild-type CVB3, likely because N63Y mutant CVB3 disseminates more efficiently to the liver. Our data reinforce the idea that culture-adapted laboratory virus strains can have reduced fitness in vivo. N63Y mutant CVB3 may be useful as a platform to understand viral adaptation and pathogenesis in animal studies. IMPORTANCE Coxsackieviruses frequently infect humans, and although many infections are mild or asymptomatic, there can be severe outcomes, including heart inflammation. Most studies with coxsackieviruses and other viruses use laboratory-adapted viral strains because of their efficient replication in cell culture. We used a cell culture-adapted strain of CVB3, Nancy, to examine viral replication and pathogenesis in orally inoculated mice. We found that mice shed viruses distinct from input viruses because they formed extremely large plaques in cell culture. We identified a single mutation, VP3 N63Y, that was sufficient for large-plaque formation. N63Y mutant viruses have reduced glycan binding and replication in cell culture; however, they have enhanced replication and virulence in mice. We are now using N63Y mutant CVB3 as an improved system for viral pathogenesis studies.",

Because mice shed unreplicated inoculum virus in their feces, it is difficult to quantify viral replication in the intestine in the first few days after oral inoculation. To avoid this problem, we examined viral replication by using light-sensitive, neutral-red-labeled virus. Virus propagated in the presence of neutral red dye is sensitive to light-induced inactivation by RNA cross-linking but loses light sensitivity upon replication in the dark inside mice, facilitating the assessment of replication and differentiating the inoculum virus from replicated virus in feces. Fecal samples were collected at 24, 48, and 72 h postinfection (hpi), and virus titers were determined by plaque assay using agar overlays (Fig. 1A) . At 24 hpi, only two mice shed replicated virus while most of the mice shed replicated virus at 72 hpi (Fig. 1B) . Surprisingly, plaques with morphology different from that of inoculum CVB3 were observed on 72-hpi fecal sample titer plates ( Fig. 1C and D) , suggesting that a variant emerged following viral replication in mice. Indeed, 0.67% of the fecal virus plaques were large at 48 hpi, while 11% were large at 72 hpi. We then examined the frequency of large-plaque viruses in our inoculum to determine whether the large-plaque variant was present prior to the inoculation of mice. We found that 0.26% of the inoculum CVB3 plaques had the large-plaque phenotype, suggesting that the large-plaque variant existed at a low level in the inoculum and was enriched following replication in the gut.",

IFNAR \u03ea/\u03ea mice and immunocompetent IFNAR \u03e9/\u03e9 mice were orally, intraperitoneally (i.p.), or intramuscularly (i.m.) inoculated with 5 \u03eb 10 7 , 5 \u03eb 10 7 , or 2 \u03eb 10 6 PFU of CVB3, respectively. Fecal samples were collected from orally inoculated mice at 72 hpi; livers, hearts, and spleens were harvested from i.p. inoculated mice at 48 hpi; and muscles and livers were harvested from i.m. inoculated mice at 48 hpi. We measured the virus plaque sizes and quantified the percentages of large plaques in different tissues (Fig. 2) . First, we found that there were more large-plaque variants in IFNAR \u03e9/\u03e9 mice than in IFNAR \u03ea/\u03ea mice. The increased emergence of the large-plaque virus in immunocompetent mice correlates with re-FIG 1 Emergence of a CVB3 large-plaque variant following oral inoculation. Four-to 6-week-old male IFNAR \u03ea/\u03ea mice were orally inoculated with 5 \u03eb 10 7 PFU of light-sensitive, neutral-red-labeled WT CVB3 in the dark, and fecal samples were collected at 24, 48, and 72 hpi in the dark. (A) Total viral titers determined by HeLa cell plaque assays with agar overlays. (B) Percentages of replicated (noninoculum) virus in fecal samples. Flowthrough inoculum viruses are light sensitive, whereas viruses that replicated in mice are light insensitive. Aliquots of each processed fecal sample were exposed to light or dark, and replication status was determined by dividing the number of PFU/ml of light-exposed samples by the number of PFU/ml of dark-exposed samples and multiplying by 100%. Each symbol represents one mouse. (C) Representative plaque morphologies of inoculum and 48-and 72-hpi fecal samples. (D) Plaque size quantification. Each symbol represents a plaque.

For panels A and B, n \u03ed 5 to 10. duced viral replication, indicating that increased selective pressure may drive the emergence of the large-plaque variant. Second, large-plaque variants were present in feces from orally inoculated mice and visceral tissues from i.p. or i.m. inoculated mice but not in muscle from i.m. inoculated IFNAR \u03ea/\u03ea mice. We hypothesize that increased selective pressure in the intestine and peritoneal cavity facilitated the emergence of large-plaque variants and/or the large-plaque variant has a fitness advantage in selected tissues. Overall, these results suggest that the large-plaque variant existed at a low level in our inoculum but was enriched following viral replication in several tissues of infected mice.",

            "text": "A single amino acid change, VP3 N63Y, is sufficient to confer the large-plaque phenotype. To identify the mutation(s) responsible for the large-plaque phenotype, we isolated six individual large-plaque viruses from mouse feces, performed plaque purification to generate large-plaque \"fecal isolate\" samples, extracted RNA, performed reverse transcription (RT)-PCR, and sequenced products by consensus sequencing. We sequenced the capsidcoding region with the rationale that major changes in plaque size frequently map to capsid proteins (35, 36) . Sequence alignment revealed several silent point mutations and two amino acid changes in the capsid-coding region of large plaques: T151S in VP2 and N63Y in VP3. Sequence alignment revealed that amino acid 151 of VP2 is a variable position, with T or S present in many GenBank samples. However, N63 is highly conserved among coxsackieviruses and echoviruses (Fig. 3A) and is located on the virion surface near the DAF binding site (Fig. 3B) (37) . Using reverse genetics, we cloned N63Y into the CVB3 infectious clone and found that N63Y is sufficient for the large-plaque phenotype (Fig. 3C) . Recently, Border\u00eda et al. identified polymorphisms at position 63 of VP3, including N63Y, N63D, and N63H, that emerged following viral passage in A549 human lung cells (38) . Therefore, VP3-63 may affect viral replication in different cell types. Because N63Y was sufficient for the large-plaque phenotype, we examined the properties of N63Y-containing viruses.",

While N63Y mutant CVB3 showed significantly less attachment to CHO-K1 cells than WT CVB3 did, it showed attachment comparable to that of WT CVB3 in the other three cell lines (Fig. 4D) . These data indicate that N63Y mutant CVB3 may have altered binding to GAGs. Second, we treated Huh7 cells with heparinase to remove GAGs and examined viral attachment. Heparinase treatment reduced the attachment of WT CVB3 to cells, with little effect on N63Y mutant CVB3 attachment (Fig. 4E ). Third, we quantified CVB3 binding to GAGs by a direct method, heparin-agarose pulldown assays. 35 S-labeled CVB3 was incubated with heparin-agarose resin or control streptavidin-agarose resin at 37\u00b0C for 3 h.

Conversely, we hypothesized that N63Y mutant CVB3 plaque formation would not be inhibited by sulfated glycans in agar. To test this, we examined the plaque sizes of WT and N63Y mutant CVB3 by using agar versus agarose overlays in the presence of added HS or heparin. Agarose contains low levels of sulfated glycans, and WT and N63Y mutant CVB3 generated similar-size large plaques under an agarose overlay. Addition of HS or heparin to the overlay reduced the WT plaque size but not the N63Y mutant plaque size (see Fig. S3 in the supplemental material). Taken together, these data suggest that the N63Y mutant has reduced binding to sulfated glycans, which facilitates the formation of large plaques in the presence of sulfated glycans but reduces its attachment to cell surface GAGs and growth in cell culture.",

N63Y mutant CVB3 had higher viral titers in feces than WT CVB3 did, especially at early time points (Fig. 5A) . Since it was shown previously that WT CVB3 has limited replication in immunocompetent mice, we wondered whether N63Y mutant CVB3 would have enhanced replication in IFNAR \u03e9/\u03e9 mice. To test this, we orally inoculated IFNAR \u03e9/\u03e9 mice and observed that the N63Y mutant replicated more efficiently than WT CVB3 (Fig. 5B) . We also examined viral titers in various tissues from orally inoculated IFNAR \u03e9/\u03e9 or IFNAR \u03ea/\u03ea mice at 72 hpi. N63Y mutant CVB3 titers were significantly higher than WT CVB3 titers in all of the IFNAR \u03ea/\u03ea mouse tissues examined (Fig. 5C) . While viral titers were low in most IFNAR \u03e9/\u03e9 mouse tissues, N63Y mutant CVB3 titers were significantly higher than WT CVB3 titers in leg muscle, indicating that the N63Y mutant was more capable of dissemination to body sites distant from the gut in immunocompetent animals (Fig. 5D) . These results indicate that N63Y mutant CVB3 has enhanced replication and systemic dissemination in orally inoculated mice, including immunocompetent mice.",

First, we measured the levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), a marker of liver damage, in serum. ALT levels were low at 24 hpi in all of the mice (Fig. 6A) . However, ALT levels were significantly elevated at 72 hpi in mice infected with N63Y mutant CVB3 compared with uninfected controls. While 33% of the mice infected with WT CVB3 had higher ALT levels than uninfected mice, 66% of the mice infected with N63Y mutant CVB3 had higher ALT levels than uninfected mice.

Moderate polymorphonuclear cell infiltration was observed in WT CVB3-infected mice.

In fact, on average, half of the injected N63Y mutant CVB3 was found in the liver. These effects were observed in livers harvested at 1 hpi, hours before a single cycle of viral replication can occur. The elevated amount of N63Y mutant CVB3 found in the liver could be due to increased binding to liver tissue and/or increased dissemination to the liver. To distinguish between these possibilities, we quantified the binding of 35 S-labeled WT versus N63Y mutant CVB3 to liver tissue homogenates from IFNAR \u03ea/\u03ea mice ex vivo.

A cell culture-adapted vaccine strain of chikungunya virus is attenuated because of increased GAG binding (37) .

Similarly, laboratory Sindbis virus strains bind HS (28) ; however, HS-binding Sindbis virus strains are attenuated in mice. Interestingly, Byrnes et al. isolated a large-plaque variant of Sindbis virus from mice inoculated with an HS-binding strain. The large-plaque variant bound HS less efficiently and was more virulent in mice (48) . The non-HS-binding variant had increased viremia and decreased clearance from serum, perhaps because of reduced clearance by heparin-binding proteins in the host. These Sindbis virus results are very reminiscent of our CVB3 results.",

Importantly, if we had used agarose rather than agar for plaque assay overlays, we would not have observed the emergence of N63Y mutant CVB3 in mice. Perhaps this explains why other groups have not yet reported the emergence of N63Y variants in animal studies. We only identified the emergence of this mutant because of a very obvious phenotypic change in plaque size. It is possible, and even likely, that the emergence of variants occurs frequently in animals but may be missed because of a lack of observable phenotypes.",

We do not know whether the GAG-binding deficiency of N63Y mutant CVB3 is sufficient for its enhanced replication and pathogenesis or if other effects contribute. In agreement with a previous study, we found that IFNAR \u03ea/\u03ea mice developed liver pathology upon CVB3 infection. Liver pathology was more severe in mice infected with N63Y mutant CVB3, potentially because N63Y mutant CVB3 had increased dissemination to the liver (Fig. 6) . Whether the increased viral shedding in mice inoculated orally with N63Y mutant CVB3 is due to altered viral dissemination to the liver or other tissues is unknown. It is possible that the enhanced replication and pathogenesis of N63Y mutant CVB3 are specific to mice, since this variant is not observed in human clinical isolates. However, because N63Y mutant CVB3 is more pathogenic than WT CVB3 in orally inoculated immunodeficient mice and N63Y mutant CVB3 replicates well in orally inoculated immunocompetent mice and even disseminates to muscle tissue, it may be useful as a new model system for examining CVB3 replication and pathogenesis by using the natural route of infection.",

Because position 151 of VP2 is highly variable in CVB3 sequences, we focused our efforts on VP3 N63Y.

The new plasmid was then sequenced, and N63Y was confirmed as the only mutation in the PCR-generated region. The large-plaque phenotype of this new clone was confirmed by plaque assay. The structure in Fig. 3 was modified from a previously determined crystal structure (Protein Data Bank code 1cov) (51) .

In the experiments shown in Fig. 6C , fresh tissues were homogenized with a Bullet Blender homogenizer (Next Advanced Inc., Averill Park, NY) (55) prior to incubation with 3 \u03eb 10 6 PFU/3,000 cpm of 35 S-labeled WT or N63Y mutant CVB3. After a 1-h incubation at 37\u00b0C, tissues were washed with PBS\u03e9 and tissue-associated radioactivity was quantified by scintillation counting.",
