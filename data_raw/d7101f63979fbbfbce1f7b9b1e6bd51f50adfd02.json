Transfer of these antibodies via colostrum caused Bovine neonatal pancytopenia (BNP) in calves, with a lethality rate of 90%. The exact immunological mechanisms behind the onset of BNP are not fully understood to date. To gain further insight into these mechanisms, we analyzed the immune proteome from alloreactive antibody producers (BNP cows) and non-responders. After in vitro stimulation of peripheral blood derived lymphocytes (PBL), we detected distinctly deviant expression levels of several master regulators of immune responses in BNP cells, pointing to a changed immune phenotype with severe dysregulation of immune response in BNP cows. Interestingly, we also found this response pattern in 22% of non-BVD-vaccinated cows, indicating a genetic predisposition of this immune deviant (ID) phenotype in cattle. We additionally analyzed the functional correlation of the ID phenotype with 10 health parameters and 6 diseases in a retrospective study over 38 months. The significantly increased prevalence of mastitis among ID cows emphasizes the clinical relevance of this deviant immune response and its potential impact on the ability to fight infections.",

            "text": "Vaccines are the most effective and also affordable disease-prevention tools (1) and maternal antibodies protect the offspring from infections in man (2) and animals (3) . In cattle, pre-partum vaccination with various virulence factors of bacterial or viral infectious diseases is a standard procedure which effectively stimulates the production of specific antibodies (4, 5) . A novel production technology using an allogeneic cell line (6) and the addition of a highly potent adjuvant to PregSure BVD, a new vaccine against bovine viral diarrhea (BVD), induced fatal immune reactions with production of alloreactive antibodies in 5-10% of vaccinated cows (7) (8) (9) . These alloantibodies were transmitted to calves, regardless of kin, via the colostrum of these dams (8, 10) and caused bovine neonatal pancytopenia (BNP) (7, (11) (12) (13) , even years after the vaccine has been taken off the market (14) . BNP calves suffered from hemorrhagic diathesis, thrombo and leukocytopenia and bone marrow depletion, which resulted in a deadly bleeding disorder (10, 15, 16) . Several authors hypothesized alloimmune reactions against the major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I) as causal for BNP (17) (18) (19) (20) . This hypothesis is still controversial since MHC I alloantibodies would be expected to bind all nucleated cells, not only to blood-derived and hematopoietic progenitor cells (12, 16) . Also transcriptome analyses provided evidence that MHC I can be excluded as single causal agent for BNP-associated alloantibodies (21) . As other authors claimed the possibility of a genetic predisposition of BNP dams for production of BNP inducing alloantibodies (22) (23) (24) , our studies focused on investigating a general difference in immune responses between PregSure BVD vaccinated control cows and BNP donors. We wanted to analyze if there is evidence for differential expression of master transcription factors of cellular immune response in lymphocyte proteome of controls and BNP dams. Interestingly, we found a markedly different immune phenotype in BNP dams, characterized by significant hyperproliferation of lymphocytes and a deviant immune signaling pathway compared to controls. We were next interested to see if we could find evidence for this immune phenotype in cows that were never vaccinated with PregSure BVD. Further testing showed that this altered immune phenotype was also detectable in 22% of cows from a PregSure BVD unvaccinated cohort. This confirmed its natural, not vaccineinduced, appearance in cattle and gave more evidence for immune deviant (ID) phenotype as a genetic predisposition. In further in-depth experiments we found that Interleukin-2 (IL-2) plays an important role in diverging immune response of ID lymphocytes. In addition to these immune response studies, we analyzed the functional correlation of the ID phenotype with overall 10 health parameters and 6 diseases in a retrospective study over 38 months. Here, a significantly increased mastitis incidence in cows with an ID phenotype became apparent, highlighting the clinical impact of altered immune response.",

Since we wanted to know if this newly discovered immune deviant phenotype related to impaired health parameters in respective cows, we retrospectively analyzed milk production, health parameters and different diseases of control and ID cows from the same farm never vaccinated with PregSure BVD. From a total of 16 parameters tested, there was no difference in 15 parameters. However, mastitis incidence was significantly different between both cow groups. We detected that ID cows suffered from mastitis twice as often as control cows (Figure 7B , * p < 0.05). At the moment of blood sampling, all cows were clinically healthy and showed no signs of mastitis which could potentially influence adverse effects to immune stimulation. Thus, this clearly indicates that the hyperproliferative phenotype of ID cows has clinical relevance apart from the response to the BVD vaccine. The hyperproliferative phenotype of BNP cows (black) and ID cows (gray) as well as the low proliferation of control cows (white) were consistently detectable over the entire observation period (38 months). Three representative control cows and ID cows are shown and two BNP cows, white symbols = controls, gray symbols = ID, black symbols = BNP.

            "text": "BNP was the unwanted result of a fatal immune response to vaccination with PregSure BVD (8, 9) . Five to ten percentage of vaccinated cattle produced disease inducing antibodies which were transferred via colostrum, killing 90% of receiving calves, regardless of kin (15, 31) . It is still unclear, why a certain subgroup of cows responded differently to the vaccination. We hypothesize that the origin of this altered immune response lies in the existence of a naturally occurring deviant immune phenotype. In this study, we could effectively confirm a quantitative difference in immune cell activation of BNP PBL through hyperproliferative responses in vitro (Figures 1A,B) . A shift in lymphocyte subpopulations (CD4 + , CD8 + , B cells) as a potential reason for these differential responses toward polyclonal immune stimulation could be excluded (Figure 2) . The hierarchical clustering of identified lymphocyte proteins from our shotgun proteomics experiment substantiated a general quantitative difference in constitutive expression of proteins in PBL of controls and BNP dams (cE, Figures 3A,B) . After immune stimulation, these differences increased even further (PWM/ ConA, Figures 3A,B) . In order to perform more indepth investigations of potential functional differences, we subsequently focused on the analysis of master transcription factors of immune cell regulation from our dataset. As a result, we detected several differentially expressed STATs. STATs initiate the differentiation of various Th cell subsets (24) as firstresponse master regulators and provide lineage specificity by promoting the differentiation of a given Th cell subset while opposing the differentiation to alternative Th cell subsets (32) . This makes them especially interesting to us, since expression of different STATs in controls and BNP specimen indicates divergent immune response pathways in these groups. In control lymphocytes we identified STAT1 with increased expression ( Figure 3D ) and significantly higher activation (Figures 4A,B) after T cell stimulation with ConA. In mice and man, STAT1 is important for the differentiation of naive CD4 + T cells to Th1 cells (33) or to type 1 regulatory (Tr) T cells (34) . From these findings, we conclude that after immune stimulation, bovine control lymphocytes use the STAT1 pathway and we hypothesize that control cows react with a Th1 or Tr immune response in polyclonal stimulation assays. The effect of STAT1 inhibition could not be tested, since we found no STAT1 specific inhibitor that was commercially available. In contrast to controls, PBL proteome of BNP dams showed higher expression levels of STAT3 ( Figure 3D) , with increased phosphorylation (Figures 4C,D) in BNP lymphocytes after immune stimulation. STAT3 could therefore be a possible master regulator for the deviant immune response in BNP dams. In mouse and man, STAT3 induces the development of follicular Th (Tfh), Th17, and Th22 cells (32, 35, 36) . Our findings proved a STAT3 pathway dependent immune response of BNP lymphocytes after polyclonal stimulation, but so far it is unknown which Th subsets exactly are regulated by STAT3 in cows. The dependence of the hyperproliferative phenotype of immune deviant PBL on STAT3 was shown by inhibition of respective factor using WP 1,066, a cell permeable tyrphostin analog which blocks the STAT3 pathway through inhibition of Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) protein tyrosine kinase (37) . As a result, we observed a significantly reduced proliferation to 37% in BNP PBL, but no effect in control PBL (Figure 5 ). Our findings therefore show, that the deviant immune response of BNP donors is associated with STAT3/JAK2 pathway. Further studies will be needed to clarify whether immune cells from control cows differentiate to Th1 or Tr subsets and if BNP donor cows develop Tfh, Th17, or Th22 cells after immune stimulation. Hyper-reactivity of BNP PBL and the STAT3 driven differentiation of Tfh cells after immune stimulation are supported by findings of other research groups, describing higher alloantibody levels in BNP cows compared to PregSure BVD vaccinated control dams (22) . This group also hypothesized, that differences between BNP and control dams are likely due to genes controlling the quantitative alloantibody response after vaccination (22) . To find evidence for a genetic predisposition of this immune deviant BNP phenotype in cows (22, 23) , we additionally analyzed the immune phenotypes of 121 non-PregSure BVD vaccinated cows. In our study, 22% of cows (ID cows) showed a BNP-like hyperproliferative response to T cell stimulation in vitro (ID, Figures 6A,B) . This percentage fits to the findings of Benedictus et al., who hypothesized a heritability of 19% in dams for the development of BNP in the calf (22) . This proves the existence of an immune deviant phenotype among a certain subpopulation of cattle, which is not triggered by vaccination with PregSure BVD but occurs naturally. The immune deviant response described here in these ID cows clearly depends on IL-2 ( Figure 6C) , which we could prove through hyperproliferative response of BNP and ID lymphocytes to stimulation with BanLec ( Figure 6B) , a mitogen that activates human T cells (28, 30) via the IL-2 pathway (29). For bovine T cells, the specific impact of IL-2 itself was not described so far. In man and mice, however, IL-2 has pleiotropic autocrine or paracrine functions that regulate proliferation of T cells (38) . It also plays a key role in promoting development, homeostasis and function of regulatory T cells though IL-2/STAT5 signals (39) and balances expression of different STATs in Th cells of mice (40) . Therefore, the association of IL-2 with the immune deviant response in cows is a very interesting finding which merits further in-depth investigations in future studies. To determine whether the newly detected deviant immune phenotype is of clinical relevance, we analyzed 10 clinical parameters and 6 diseases in 100 cows from the sampled dairy farm and compared incidence between controls (n = 73) and ID animals (n = 27). Interestingly, we found a significantly increased mastitis incidence in ID cows compared to controls ( Figure 7B ). This highly important correlation points to an altered immune reaction of ID cows to classical mastitis pathogens, facilitating mastitis onset in these animals.",

The ID phenotype shows altered reactions to immune stimulation identical to BNP dams, such as hyperproliferation of lymphocytes, STAT3/JAK2 regulated pathway and association with IL-2. These features potentially triggered alloantigenproduction after maternal PregSure BVD vaccination, causing BNP. The correlation of the ID phenotype with high mastitis incidence ( Figure 7B ) underlines its clinical relevance. ",

After density gradient centrifugation (room temperature, 290 \u00d7 g, 25 min, brake off), PBL were obtained from intermediate phase. Cells were washed twice in PBS (4 \u2022 C) and either used immediately or stored at \u221220 \u2022 C (lysate) for western blot analyses. PBL were seeded in 96-well plates (1 \u00d7 10 5 cells/well) and stimulated for 48 h with either PWM (Pokeweed mitogen), ConA (Concanavalin A) or BanLec (Banana lectin) (Sigma-Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany, 5 \u00b5g/ml), bovine IL-2 (Bio-Techne, Wiesbaden, Germany, 1 ng/ml), bovine IL-4 or bovine Interferon gamma (IFN\u03b3) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany, 3 ng/ml). For the inhibition assays, cells were incubated with STAT3 inhibitor (WP 1,066, Santa Cruz, Heidelberg, Germany, 50 ng/ml) 12 h before stimulation. After 34 h of stimulation, cells were pulsed for 14 h with 0,05 mCi/well [methyl-3 H]-thymidine (Perkin Elmer, Hamburg, Germany), harvested and counts per minute were measured. Proliferation rate after stimulation was expressed as factor of [ 3 H]-thymidine incorporation with respect to the unstimulated cells or after inhibition as percentage to ConA stimulated cells.",
