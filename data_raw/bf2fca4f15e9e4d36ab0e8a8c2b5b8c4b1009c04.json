Using coordinated proteomics and metagenomics analysis we simultaneously analysed the microbiota and proteomes of the upper airway and determined direct antibacterial activity in airway secretions of RSV-infected children. Here, we report that the airway abundance of Streptococcus was higher in samples collected at the time of RSV infection compared with samples collected one month later. RSV infection is associated with neutrophil influx into the airway and degranulation and is marked by overexpression of proteins with known antibacterial activity including BPI, EPX, MPO and AZU1. Airway secretions of children infected with RSV, have significantly greater antibacterial activity compared to RSV-negative controls. This RSVassociated, neutrophil-mediated antibacterial response in the airway appears to act as a regulatory mechanism that modulates bacterial growth in the airways of RSV-infected children.",

In 2015, acute lower respiratory infections (ALRI) due to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) resulted in an estimated 33.1 million disease episodes, 3.2 million hospitalisations and 118,200 deaths in children younger than the age of 5 years 3 . A common complication of respiratory virus infection is secondary bacterial infection; viruses such as influenza, RSV and parainfluenza often predispose the host to secondary respiratory disease caused by pathobionts, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Staphylococcus aureus [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] , leading to serious, potentially life-threatening sequelae 9 . Secondary bacterial complications are thought to have been the major cause of the fatalities that occurred in the wake of the major influenza pandemics of the 20th and early 21st century 8, 10, 11 . In the case of RSV, there is a strong link between virus infection and secondary bacterial infections, particularly otitis media caused by S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae [12] [13] [14] .",

These observations are supported by results from clinical studies which show that the upper airway microbiota of children with RSV infection is significantly enriched for H. influenzae and Streptococcus 19, 20 . The host response to RSV infection is characterised by the recruitment of innate immune cells 21 and the release of inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-17A and other soluble mediators 22 . To date, no studies have examined whether the immune response triggered by replication of RSV in the airway has simultaneous antibacterial activity, aimed at controlling increased bacterial colonisation resulting from viral infection. Here we report the simultaneous analysis of the upper airway proteomes and microbiota of infants and children with and without RSV infection to determine whether elements of the innate immune response to RSV infection in the human airway has incidental antibacterial activity. Using shotgun proteomics, we find that the local airway response that followed RSV infection is characterised by a strong neutrophil response, which has direct antibacterial properties.",

The top 10 taxa in the airway microbiome by median proportional abundance were Streptococcus, Veillonella, Haemophilus, Prevotella, Neisseria, Escherichia, Staphylococcus, Corynebacterium, Moraxella, and Leptotrichia (Fig. 1a) . Streptococcus was the most abundant taxon with a median proportional abundance of~40% ( Supplementary  Fig. 1 ). Simultaneous bacterial metaproteome analysis using mass spectrometry showed a similar profile of microbial diversity and was equally dominated by Streptococcal proteins (Fig. 1b) . Most of the bacterial proteins in the metaproteome were ribosomal proteins, including 50S and 30S proteins as well proteins involved in energy metabolism, such as pyruvate oxidase and enolase. Further analysis of the genomic microbiota data was undertaken to determine whether the airway replication of RSV had an effect on the most abundant bacterial taxon (Streptococcus). Changes in Streptococcus abundance during and after RSV infection were calculated in a subset of RSV-infected children (n = 10) for whom nasal samples were collected at admission (acute samples) and 1 month later (convalescent samples). For 70% of these children (7/10), the airway abundance of Streptococcus during acute infection was higher than that at convalescence, while for three children (3/10) , Streptococcus abundance at convalescence was either not different or had increased, relative to the acute infection time point (Fig. 1c) .",

In order to characterise biological pathways that are upregulated in the local airway following RSV infection, the mean expression levels of airway proteins were compared between children with and without RSV infection. Of the 1875 host proteins that were quantified in the upper airway, the mean expression levels of 123 proteins were significantly different between the two groups of children (Supplementary data 2). Among these, 73 proteins were expressed at significantly higher levels in children with RSV infection while the remainder were higher among those without RSV infection (Fig. 2a) . Gene ontology biological process (GOBP)-based enrichment analysis of these differentially expressed proteins showed that the neutrophil degranulation pathway (GOBP ID: 0043312, combined enrichment score = 401.9) was the most significantly enriched biological process among RSV-infected children (adjusted Fishers exact test P = 9.5 \u00d7 10 \u221231 , Fig. 2b ). Other pathways such as proteolysis were also significantly enriched in the airways of RSV-infected children but their respective enrichment scores were much lower than the neutrophil degranulation pathway (combined enrichment scores of \u2264 35.1) (Fig. 2b) . The neutrophil degranulation pathway comprised 33 proteins-including bactericidal proteins that are typically localised within neutrophil granules, such as MPO, AZU1, BPI, LCN2, and others (Fig. 2d ). In addition to neutrophil granule proteins, we also observed elevated expression of other potent antibacterial proteins in RSV-infected children; the mean expression levels of eosinophil peroxidase (EPX) and Ras-related protein (RAP1B) were significantly higher in RSV-infected children than in RSV-negative controls (Fig. 2d) . Among children without RSV infection, SRP-dependent co-translational protein targeting to membrane, signal sequence recognition (GOBP ID: 0006617, adjusted Fishers exact test P = 1.02 \u00d7 10 \u22128 , Fig. 2c ) was the most significantly enriched pathway.",

Due to the significant overexpression of antibacterial proteins in the airway secretions of RSV-infected children, we reasoned that these children would have substantially greater antibacterial activity compared with children without RSV infection. To test this hypothesis, we developed an in vitro assay to measure the bacterial inhibition activity against a common nasopharyngeal pathobiont, S. pneumoniae. Anti-pneumococcal activity was tested in nasal samples from children with and without RSV infection and data presented as a bacterial inhibition index (BII), whose values ranged from 0 (no inhibition) to 40,960 (complete inhibition) (Fig. 3a) . Children were binned into five BII strata (BII: \u226420, 40, 80, 160 and \u2265320) and the relative proportions of different OTUs was determined within each group. The proportional abundance of Streptococcus decreased with increasing BII, with children who had the lowest anti-pneumococcal activity (BII: \u226420) having the highest mean airway abundance of Streptococcus (45%) while those with the highest anti-pneumococcal activity (BII \u2265 320) had the lowest Streptococcus abundance (25%) ( Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 4 ).",

In order to identify a potential role for airway neutrophil granule proteins in the pathogenesis of RSV, we examined the effect of different protein expression levels on clinical parameters associated with RSV disease severity. Since one of the central features of severe RSV pneumonia is reduced blood oxygen saturation resulting from occlusion of small airways with necrotic, virusinfected cells as well as infiltrating immune cells. We therefore examined the effect of the increased expression of neutrophil granule proteins on blood oxygen saturation. Children were dichotomised into two groups (high and low neutrophil granule expressers) based on the median expression level of different proteins. Children whose protein expression level was above the median expression (of the full study population) were classified as high expressers while those who were below the median were classified as low expressers (Fig. 5) . We then compared oxygen saturation levels between these two groups. For all neutrophil granule proteins that were analysed (ITGAM, BPI, LCN2, MGAM, ITGB2, AZU1, ANPEP, MMP9 and MPO), children with low levels of airway neutrophil granule expression had significantly higher blood oxygen saturation levels compared to children in the high-expression group (Fig. 5a) .

We therefore hypothesised that the host response to RSV is partly directed at controlling increased levels of Streptococcus. We undertook comprehensive analysis of the airway microbiota and proteomes of children with RSV as well as RSV-negative controls, in order to identify features of the post-infection innate immune response that have incidental antibacterial effects. We found that the upper airways of children in the study was dominated by a highly diverse population of commensal bacteria for which a wide range of bacterial proteins could be detected in the airway metaproteome. We also found evidence that infection with RSV is associated with increased Streptococcal colonisation. In a subset analysis of children who were sampled both during acute disease and at convalescence, approximately one month later, we found that the airway abundance of Streptococcus was greater at the time of RSV infection compared with the convalescent time point when children had cleared the infection. These results agree with previous clinical studies that have shown that children with RSV infections have a higher abundance of Streptococci in their airway secretions 19 , and supports the idea that RSV-infection in the human airway, enhances Streptococcal colonisation. Our results showed that following an RSV infection there was a significant increase in the expression levels of a large number of proteins related to innate immunity. Due to the fact that RSV replication and the RSV-mediated increase in bacterial colonisation occur simultaneously, it was not possible to establish which elements of this response were directly attributable to the virus and which ones were triggered by the increased bacterial load. Association between airway neutrophil granule expression and disease severity. In order to characterise the clinical implications of the increased expression of neutrophil-associated proteins on disease pathology, we assessed the association between the level of expression of these proteins and a cardinal feature of RSV pathology, blood oxygen saturation. a Using proteome data obtained from all admitted children (n = 84), we stratified the expression levels of nine neutrophil granule proteins (ITGAM, BPI, LCN2, MGAM, ITGB2, AZU1, ANPEP, MMP9 and MPO) that were significantly overexpressed in RSV-infected children by the median. Children whose protein expression level was above the population median were classified as highexpressers while those below it were classified as low expressers (see legend for graphical illustration of the stratification strategy). For all proteins analysed, children in the high expression group had significantly lower blood oxygen saturation levels (measured using fingertip pulse oximetry) compared to children in the low expression group. b For comparison, we used the same median stratification strategy to dichotomise children into high and low expression groups for two housekeeping control proteins, beta-actin (ACTB) and beta-2-microglobulin (B2M). For both proteins there was no statistically significant difference in blood oxygen saturation levels between high and low expressers. The dashed horizontal line indicates an oxygen saturation threshold of 90%, below which children would typically be characterised as functionally hypoxic. Statistical comparison between high and low strata was done using a two-sided Student t-test. The elements of the box and whisker plots are defined in Fig. 1 .

In RSV-infected children, we found a significant enrichment of the neutrophil degranulation pathway, characterised by the increased expression of neutrophil effector proteins, such as MPO, AZU1 and ELANE which have been shown in previous work to be associated with RSV infection [23] [24] [25] . In agreement with previous studies 26, 27 , we found that neutrophils could be detected at relatively high frequencies in the upper airway samples of children with respiratory infections, thereby suggesting that the local innate response to RSV infection in the airway is associated with an influx of neutrophils and their subsequent degranulation. Neutrophils are specialised innate phagocytic cells that are densely packed with granules containing hundreds of proteins with broad antibacterial action 28 . These granules can be broadly classified into three subsets 29 : primary (or azurophil) granules (characterised by expression of MPO, BPI and ELANE), secondary (or specific) granules (characterised by LCN2 expression) and tertiary (or gelatinase) granules (identified by expression of MMP9). In this study, we identified proteins belonging to all three subsets in the upper airway secretions of study participants and all were expressed at significantly higher levels in RSVinfected children compared to RSV-negative controls. Previous studies have provided compelling evidence of the direct antibacterial action of neutrophil granule proteins and have highlighted their central role in innate immune defence against bacteria. For example, MPO is a potent bactericidal protein, which in the presence of a hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) sourcesuch as S. pneumoniae 30 -selectively binds to bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, S. aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes, causing their rapid killing 31 . BPI on the other hand exhibits independent antibacterial activity against Gramnegative bacteria such as E. coli 32, 33 and is also capable of neutralising bacterial endotoxin 34 , while ELANE mediates cleavage of virulence factors from bacteria such as Salmonella and Shigella 35 . In addition to neutrophil granule proteins, we found increased expression of bactericidal proteins from other innate immune cell populations, such as the eosinophilic peroxidase EPX, which rapidly kills bacteria such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis 36 . These observations suggested that the neutrophil response that follows an RSV airway infection might have significant antibacterial activity due to the incidental overexpression of these bactericidal proteins. To test this hypothesis, we compared the relative bacterial inhibition activity in airway samples obtained from RSVpositive and RSV-negative children, as well as a subset of RSVinfected infants from whom acute and convalescent samples were available. We found that the airway secretions from children infected with RSV had significantly higher bacterial inhibition activity compared with those from RSV-negative children.",

Comparative analysis of the relative levels of anti-pneumococcus IgG in RSV-positive and RSV-negative children showed that the difference in bacterial inhibition activity could not be explained by a differential abundance of these antibodies, since antibody levels against two different pneumococcal antigens were not significantly different. Taken together these observations suggest that the recruitment and degranulation of airway neutrophils in following an RSV infection is associated with the increased expression of bactericidal proteins whose antibacterial action contributes to the regulation of commensal bacteria in the upper respiratory tract. Due to the fact that the virus-mediated increase in bacterial load occurs concurrently with the airway replication of RSV, it was not possible to conclusively establish whether the antibacterial activity that we observed in RSV-infected children was as a result of virus infection, increased bacterial load or both. Despite the fact that nasal secretions from RSV-infected children had significantly greater antibacterial activity compared to RSV-negative controls, these children had a higher airway abundance of Streptococcus. A possible explanation for this observation is the contemporaneous nature of RSV replication and increased bacterial colonisation in the airway. Previous studies in in vitro cell culture models have shown that S. pneumoniae adheres at significantly greater levels to RSV-infected cells, compared to uninfected cells and that this increased adherence is mediated by a direct interaction between bacterial adhesins and the RSV attachment protein that is expressed on the surface of RSVinfected cells 15, 16, 18 . This suggests that the conditions in the airway at the time of acute RSV infection-when virus replication is at peak-favour increased bacterial colonisation and that these conditions persist for as long as the viral infection remains unresolved.",

Lung tissue obtained from these infants was characterised by a neutrophil influx that was distributed predominantly between arterioles and airways 37 . Using modern systems biology tools, our results of our study align with these previous findings and highlight a potential central role of neutrophils in RSV disease pathology. It is likely that these infiltrating neutrophils occlude the small airways of young infants, leading to impaired gas exchange and manifesting clinically in reduced blood oxygen saturation and hypoxia.",

We also found that a greater proportion of neutrophils from RSVinfected children exhibited phagocytic activity against bacteria, although the difference was also not significant. A potential explanation of these results is the relatively small sample size used in the cellular analysis.",

The study population was recruited from local healthcare facilities including the Kilifi County Hospital and the Pingilikani dispensary. Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were collected and used for multiplex PCR diagnosis of 15 respiratory pathogens: RSV (A and B), rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus (1, 2, 3 and 4) adenovirus, influenza (A, B and C), coronavirus (OC43 and e229), human metapneumovirus and M. pneumoniae. Results from RSV-positive samples were confirmed using a direct fluorescent antibody test kit (Light Diagnostics, Merc) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. A standardised set of clinical and anthropometric measures were collected for all study participants including: age, respiratory rate, axillary temperature, oxygen saturation, and history of upper respiratory tract symptoms (coughing, sneezing, runny nose). To establish associations between RSV infection and the resident airway microbiota, children were stratified into two groups, RSV-positive and RSV-negative: in the RSV-positive group, only children who were positive for RSV (real-time cycle threshold values \u2264 27) and negative for all other targets on the multiplex panel were included. In the RSVnegative group, only children who were negative for all pathogens in the real-time PCR panel were included. Children with positive blood culture results were excluded from the study. Written informed consent was sought from the parents and legal guardians of all children who were sampled in this study. Ethical approval for the conduct of this study was granted by the Kenya Medical Research Institute's Scientific and ethical research unit (SERU). All study procedures were conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Laboratory Practise (GCLP) standards. All measurements reported in this paper were obtained from individual children sampled once, with the exception of a subset of 10 children who were sampled during acute disease and at convalescence in order to examine the effect of RSV infection on Streptococcal colonisation.",

The data arising from the mass-spectrometry analysis are deposited in the ProteomeXchange Consortium database 44 (Accession number: PXD009403). Analysis of the airway metaproteome was undertaken by searching the Raw mass spectrometer files (using MaxQuant software version 1.6.0.131) against a bacterial FASTA database, which was constructed by assembling Uniprot FASTA files of individual bacteria species that had been identified by genomic microbiota analysis into a single FASTA search file. Searches for bacterial proteins were done using the Andromeda search engine 45 . To test whether the mean expression levels of different host airway proteins were significantly different between RSV-positive and RSV-negative children, two-sided t-tests were conducted and adjustment for multiple testing done using the false discovery rate (fdr) method. Proteins were significantly differentially expressed if their mean expression level in one group was at least 1.5-fold greater than in the alternative group. GO biological pathway enrichment analysis was done on the enrichR bioinformatic pipeline 46, 47 . The output of this analysis was used to determine whether certain biological pathways were statistically overrepresented in the airway secretions of RSV-positive or RSV-negative children.

The taxonomic identities of these low-abundance operational taxonomic units are presented in Supplementary Data 1. b The proteome of the upper airway microbiota (metaproteome) was characterised by mass spectrometric analysis using airway samples from 84 children and the results are presented in a circular bar chart. Each bar represents the mean expression level of one bacterial protein. Values on the y-axis correspond to MS protein expression levels (log 10 reporter corrected intensity). Most of the bacterial operational taxonomic units that were identified in metagenomic analyses of the airway microbiota were also identified in the proteome. The highest number of protein identifications belonged to the genus Streptococcus and comprised mainly of ribosomal proteins and proteins involved in energy metabolism pathways. c The abundance of Streptococcus in the airway was compared between RSVpositive and RSV-negative children. RSV-infected children had a higher abundance of airway Streptococcus compared to RSV-negative children. d The effect of RSV infection on Streptococcal colonisation of the upper airway was characterised using a subset of 10 children from whom nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were obtained during acute RSV infection and at convalescence, approximately one month later. Seven out of 10 children (70%) exhibited declines in the airway abundance of Streptococcus upon recovery from RSV, while for three children, convalescent-stage Streptococcus abundance was either unchanged from the acute time point or was higher.

In order to characterise the clinical implications of the increased expression of neutrophil-associated proteins on disease pathology, we assessed the association between the level of expression of these proteins and a cardinal feature of RSV pathology, blood oxygen saturation. a Using proteome data obtained from all admitted children (n = 84), we stratified the expression levels of nine neutrophil granule proteins (ITGAM, BPI, LCN2, MGAM, ITGB2, AZU1, ANPEP, MMP9 and MPO) that were significantly overexpressed in RSV-infected children by the median. Children whose protein expression level was above the population median were classified as highexpressers while those below it were classified as low expressers (see legend for graphical illustration of the stratification strategy). For all proteins analysed, children in the high expression group had significantly lower blood oxygen saturation levels (measured using fingertip pulse oximetry) compared to children in the low expression group. b For comparison, we used the same median stratification strategy to dichotomise children into high and low expression groups for two housekeeping control proteins, beta-actin (ACTB) and beta-2-microglobulin (B2M). For both proteins there was no statistically significant difference in blood oxygen saturation levels between high and low expressers. The dashed horizontal line indicates an oxygen saturation threshold of 90%, below which children would typically be characterised as functionally hypoxic. Statistical comparison between high and low strata was done using a two-sided Student t-test. The elements of the box and whisker plots are defined in Fig. 1.
