He immediately had difficulty walking and 3 hours later consulted an on-call GP. Posterior ankle swelling with a tender depression 3 cm proximal to the calcaneum was found. Active plantar flexion against resistance was weak and Simmonds-Thompson test was 'partially positive' on applying a strong calf-squeeze. Based on these findings, calf muscle rupture was diagnosed as the Achilles tendon was thought to be intact. The patient was advised to elevate the foot and wait 2 weeks for improvement. Two days later a second GP, who was aware of a history of an audible snap, considered complete tendon rupture and reexamined the patient. Findings included an absent right heel raise due to weakness, minimal active plantar flexion against gravity and lying prone, significant right ankle swelling without bruising, and an altered angle of declination. Palpation elicited no ankle bony tenderness, yet a painful gap was identified 6 cm proximal from the calcaneal attachment, along the line of the Achilles tendon. Simmonds-Thompson's test was clearly positive. The positive Simmond's triad indicated a clinical diagnosis of complete rupture of the Achilles tendon. A 3.4-8 MHz linear array probe PSUD (VScan\u00d4 dual probe, GE Healthcare), set at a depth of 3.5 cm, was used under the supervision of a rheumatologist experienced in ultrasound. The tendon was enlarged from 1 cm to 6 cm above the calcaneal insertion, where a clear gap was seen ( Figure 1) . Two hours later a radiologist-performed ultrasound (LOGIQ E9\u00d4, GE Healthcare) and reported an enlarged distal tendon and a complete rupture at 5-6 cm from the calcaneal attachment, creating a 2.7 cm blood-filled gap ( Figure 2 ).

The pilgrimage lasts 5 days, although pilgrims usually travel for longer. The Hajj occurs 10 days earlier each year (adhering to the lunar calendar), and in 2018 it is estimated to start around the 19 August. The word 'Hajj' means to travel to the holy city of Mecca with the intention of performing certain rituals and visiting certain places at a specific time of the year. The actions of Hajj are specified and detailed in the books of jurisprudence. During Hajj days, millions of pilgrims move and worship within a small area of around 12 kilometers, in a display of dedication, universal brotherhood, and gratitude. An accepted Hajj brings reward no less than Paradise, as related from the Prophet Muhammad himself. 4 The rites of Hajj are physically demanding, involving travelling in heat and among large crowds, in addition to engaging in demanding and draining physical rituals, which are lengthened by the masses of pilgrims, and occur in confined spaces (Hajj tents at Mina can hold up to 100 pilgrims each). Hajj is the largest annual gathering of people globally (1.86 million in 2016), and thus one can appreciate the challenge of performing individual rites among such a mass gathering. 5",
