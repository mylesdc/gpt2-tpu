            "text": "There is now an overwhelming body of evidence that implicates bats in the dissemination of a long list of emerging and reemerging viral agents, often causing illnesses or death in both animals and humans. Despite this, there is a paucity of information regarding the immunological mechanisms by which bats coexist with highly pathogenic viruses. Immunoglobulins are major components of the adaptive immune system. Early studies found bats may have quantitatively lower antibody responses to model antigens compared to conventional laboratory animals. To further understand the antibody response of bats, the present study purified and characterised the major immunoglobulin classes from healthy black flying foxes, Pteropus alecto. We employed a novel strategy, where IgG was initially purified and used to generate anti-Fab specific antibodies. Immobilised anti-Fab specific antibodies were then used to capture other immunoglobulins from IgG depleted serum. While high quantities of IgM were successfully isolated from serum, IgA was not. Only trace quantities of IgA were detected in the serum by mass spectrometry. Immobilised ligands specific to IgA (Jacalin, Peptide M and staphylococcal superantigen-like protein) also failed to capture P. alecto IgA from serum. IgM was the second most abundant serum antibody after IgG. A survey of mucosal secretions found IgG was the dominant antibody class rather than IgA. Our study demonstrates healthy P. alecto bats have markedly less serum IgA than expected. Higher quantities of IgG in mucosal secretions may be compensation for this low abundance or lack of IgA. Knowledge and reagents developed within this study can be used in the future to examine class-specific antibody response within this important viral host.",

Frugivorous and nectivorous pteropid bats (family Pteropodidae, suborder Megachiroptera) constitute approximately 170 species and are known colloquially as fruit bats or flying foxes. Their capacity for long-distance dispersal through flight has undoubtedly contributed to their widespread distribution throughout tropical and sub-tropical Asia and Australia, and on islands of the Indian and western Pacific Oceans. The black flying fox, Pteropus alecto, is distributed mainly across the northern and eastern coasts of Australia [1] . Since 1994, this species has gained particular attention after it was identified as the natural host of Hendra virus (HeV) [2, 3] .",

            "text": "A body of evidence exists implicating bats as a major source of zoonotic viruses [4] [5] [6] . Bats have been shown to harbour and disseminate highly pathogenic viruses including Ebola, SARS-like coronavirus and the henipaviruses (HeV and Nipah) [4] . Spillover events from bats to other species -including humans -have increased. In 1998, a spillover event of Nipah virus from pteropid bats to farmed pigs caused a major disease outbreak in Malaysia. More than 1 million pigs were culled, and of the 265 reported human cases, 105 were fatal [7, 8] . While the incidence of HeV in Australia has been more sporadic, an increase in spillover events from pteropid bats to horses has occurred. Between 1994 and 2010, 14 HeV outbreaks occurred in Australia involving 48 confirmed equine cases (75% fatality rate) and seven human cases (60% fatality rate). In contrast, between June 2011 and January 2012, 19 HeV outbreaks occurred [9] . The increasing incidence of HeV, combined with its high fatality rate, means HeV has the potential to cause further significant disease outbreaks in Australia and abroad. Recently, a novel paramyxovirus that is closely related to the henipaviruses, named Cedar virus, was isolated from fruit bats in Australia [10] . However unlike HeV, Cedar virus caused no clinical disease in experimentally infected ferrets and guinea pigs [10] . Evidence of henipavirus infection in multiple bat species has also been identified in continental Africa [11] .",

            "text": "Immunoglobulins, namely IgG, IgA and IgM, are important and diverse secretory components of the mammalian immune system. Antibodies of the IgG class are the most abundant immunoglobulins in mammalian serum and consequently provide the majority of immunity against blood-borne infectious agents [19] . In contrast, IgA is most abundant in mucosal secretions including milk, tears, and secretions of the upper respiratory tract and digestive tract. The abundance of IgA in normal human serum is approximately one fifth of the IgG level and accounts for about 15-20% of total immunoglobulins in serum [20] . In humans, serum IgA is predominantly monomeric whereas IgA within mucosal secretions is found as a dimer complex. Polymerisation of the IgA (and IgM) is facilitated by the joining (J) chain which is expressed by immunocytes of various secretory tissues [21] . Polymeric IgA is secreted into the mucosa through its interaction with the polymeric Ig receptor (pIgR) which is expressed at the basolateral surface of secretory epithelial cells. The IgA/pIgR complex is transported via transcytosis to the cell surface where it is ultimately secreted in to the lumen [22] . Mammalian IgA plays a crucial role in mucosal immunity while in serum it interacts with the IgA Fc receptor (FcaR) to control the inflammatory response [20] . Indeed, in the absence of antigen, IgA down-regulates IgG mediated phagocytosis, chemotaxis, cytokine release and oxidative burst activity [23] [24] [25] [26] . IgM is the first antibody produced following microbial invasion and exists predominantly as either a monomeric antigen receptor on B cells or as a soluble pentamer. IgM can also exist as tetramer and dimers, however these forms are significantly less abundant. In healthy humans serum IgM is slightly less abundant compared to serum IgA. Variation in the nature of N-linked glycosylation provides further diversity to immunoglobulins. These glycans play a vital role in maintaining structural integrity and in some cases act as ligands for immunologically important serum lectins such as mannan-binding lectin [27] .",

Transcripts resembling IgE have also been indentified in different bat species, while IgD appears specific to only insectivorous bats [29] . Wild-caught bats are certainly capable of generating neutralising antibodies to viruses such as Hendra, Ebola and SARS-like coronavirus [2, 30, 31] , but early studies have demonstrated pronounced differences in both the magnitude and duration of antibody responses in bats compared to other mammals [32] [33] [34] . The large frugivorous bat, P. giganteus, demonstrated a delayed primary antibody response following immunization with sheep red blood cells [32] . Similarly, the magnitude and duration of the neutralising antibody response of the Big Brown Bat (Eptesicus fuscus) to the model antigen PhiX174 bacteriophage was lower than that of rabbits and guinea pigs [33] . The likelihood that bats have an atypical immunoglobulin response compared to other animals requires further attention. Specifically, the abundance, tissue distribution and post-translational modification of the different immunoglobulin classes must be examined.",

Considering that in other mammalian species, immunoglobulins IgG, IgM and IgA are present in relatively high abundance in serum and tissues, we anticipated that bats would possess a similar immunoglobulin profile. However, while IgG and IgM appeared abundant in P. alecto serum, IgA was not. IgA was detected in the mucosal secretions of the small and large intestine lavages, milk and tears.

Washing removed significantly more IgG from the immobilised Protein A column compared to Protein G. IgG binding to Protein L was negligible (data not shown). IgG H was approximately 50-52 kDa. A light chain immunoglobulin of approximately 25 kDa was also visible in Protein G purified fractions ( Fig. 2A) .

IGHA mRNA was highly transcribed in the small intestine, lung and salivary gland. IGHM was highly expressed in lymph node and spleen, and moderately transcribed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), small intestine and lung.

Trace quantities of serum IgA were detected only by LC-MS/MS. Parallel experiments with anti-human Fab antibody successfully enriched IgA from human serum,. Furthermore, affinity chromatography with ligands known to be specific to IgA [39] [40] [41] failed to enrich this immunoglobulin from P. alecto serum. It must be kept in mind the approaches utilised in this study to isolate IgA are based on the assumption that P. alecto IgA would have similar characteristics to mammalian IgA and the variable heavy chain regions would be shared between the major immunoglobulin classes. Previous mRNA sequencing studies of the P. alecto immunoglobulin repertoire would suggest this assumption is sound [28] . However, if P. alecto contains additional atypical IgA-like molecules, our approaches may have failed to detect such variants. Various IgA-like equivalents have been identified across a range of species including teleost fish, amphibians and reptile [48] [49] [50] , highlighting the divergent evolutionary pathways that contribute to mucosal immunity.",

The IgA H sequence previously obtained for P. alecto is also missing this cysteine [28] . In humans, IgA2 is the dominant IgA subclass in mucosal secretions, whereas IgA1 is more common in serum.

Real-time PCR revealed both the IGJ and PIGR transcripts co-localised with IGHA across most tissues.

Interestingly, while IGHG mRNA was not highly expressed in the mucosal tissues, LC-MS/MS revealed IgG was the dominant immunoglobulin in these tissues and secretions. This result suggests the majority of IgG protein within the mucosal tissues and secretions is not locally produced and is more likely transported to these sites. In humans, the transportation and regulation of IgG across the mucosal epithelium is driven by the neonatal Fc receptor [51] . The importance of mucosal IgG in the defence against epithelium associated pathogens has been demonstrated previously and is now recognised as playing a key role in mucosal immunity along with IgA [52] . The relative abundance of IgG over IgA within the milk of P. alecto may have implications for the transfer of material immunity. In humans the majority of IgG is transferred to the fetus via the placenta and only trace quantities of IgG are found in lacteal secretions [53, 54] . Other species, such as cows, sheep and horses do not transfer IgG across the placenta and the majority of IgG, and a smaller proportion of IgA, is provided to the newborn through the colostrum and milk [53, 54] . The data presented herein would suggest P. alecto, unlike humans and rabbits, transfers the majority of IgG through the lacteal secretions rather than through the placenta.",

However, severe allergies, autoimmune and gastrointestinal disorders have been reported in some patients [55] . Studies in IgA knockout mice Samples were run on separate gels and bands were excised from the region predicted to comprise the immunoglobulin heavy chains . Gel images are presented in Figure S2 . [56] . Interestingly, however, the IgA deficient mice produced higher quantities of systemic IgG. Similar findings have also been reported in humans [57, 58] . Indeed, significantly higher levels of IgM and IgG were found in the saliva of IgA deficient individuals compared to normal healthy controls [58] . In light of these studies, we hypothesise that the dominance of IgG in the mucosal secretions of P. alecto may be an evolutionary compensation for an inherent lack of IgA. Further research is required to determine what functional relevance this would have on the immune response. 2-DE resolution of P. alecto serum demonstrated the existence of multiple IgG H isoforms. The immunoblot reactive spot train spanned a wide pI range of 5 to 9. This range is in agreement with the predicted pI range of 15 separate IGHG mRNA previously sequenced (range of 6.3 to 8.3) [28] . A doublet of slightly different molecular weights for the IgG H chain was also observed after 1-DE immunoblotting. Most mammalian species contain multiple IgG subclasses and therefore it is not surprising that P. alecto contained multiple subclasses of IgG. Indeed, Butler et al. [29] reported the presence of multiple IGHG subclass transcripts in a number of bat species including Myotis lucifugus, Eptiscus fuscus and Cynopterus sphinx. In contrast to IgG H , a much smaller number of reactive IgM H isoforms were detected in serum following 2-DE western blotting. However, following deglycosylation with PNGa-seF, two bands of IgM H were observed in P. alecto. This result was not observed in human IgM. This finding suggests the possible existence of a subclass of IgM H in P. alecto that is absent from humans. To our knowledge the existence of multiple IgM subclasses has not been previously described in bats. Considering that IgM provides a first line of defence against microbial invasion, diversification of this immunoglobulin class may confer a distinct immunological advantage to the species. Indeed, different IgM subclasses may confer an enhanced and diverse classical complement pathway which, to some extent, may compensate for the lack of serum IgA in P. alecto. Further studies are required to elucidate the functional significance of putative IgM subclasses within P. alecto.",

Protein G recognises most IgG subclasses in many species [59] whilst Protein A binds only certain IgG subclasses and in some species does not bind IgG (e.g. rat and goat). This finding may reflect the presence of different P. alecto IgG subclasses with different binding affinity to Protein A. P. alecto IgG H antiserum cross reacted strongly against two other bats (P. conspiculatus and R. megaphylus) and horse IgG H . A close evolutionary relationship between chiroptera bats and horse has been reported on a number of occasions and may have contributed to this cross reactivity [60, 61] . The fact that P. alecto IgM H antiserum did not cross react with horse suggests this immunoglobulin class has diverged more rapidly since the separation of horse and bats compared to IgG. Divergence of IgM may have contributed to the rise of different IgM subclasses as described above. Given that serum IgA is drastically reduced in P. alecto, diversification of IgM may have functional significance for the early antibody response.",

            "text": "The novel method involving the use of immobilised anti-Fabspecific antibody described herein allows for the simultaneous purification of immunoglobulin classes from serum and production of class-specific antiserum without prior knowledge of the species' immunoglobulin repertoire. IgG and IgM were purified from P. alecto serum, and rabbit antiserum specific to both molecules were produced. While IgG and IgM were successfully isolated from serum, no visible enrichment of serum IgA was achieved. Trace quantities of IgA were detected only by mass spectrometry in serum. IgA was also detected in the mucosal secretions of the small and large intestine lavages, milk and tears. The glycosylation pattern of P. alecto IgG and IgM appears typical of that described for other mammalian immunoglobulins. Furthermore deglycosylation of IgM H and 2-DE immunoblotting of IgG H revealed the possible existence of multiple IgM H and IgG H subclasses in P. alecto. Taken together, this study suggests healthy P. alecto bats have considerably less serum IgA than expected. Diversification of IgM and IgG subclasses may be an evolutionary compensation for this lack of IgA. Further research is now required to investigate the functional relevance of this unique antibody repertoire, particularly in response to viral infection. The knowledge and tools developed here will facilitate this research. (Table S2 ) (TIF) Table S1 Protein identification by LC-MS/MS analysis of IgM affinity purified fractions.
