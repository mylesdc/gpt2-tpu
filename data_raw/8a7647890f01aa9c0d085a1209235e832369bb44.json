Current methods often require bacterial or viral isolation, or testing only a limited number of known species using quantitative PCR analysis. Herein, faeces from two 25-day-old piglets with diarrhoea from Texas, USA, were analysed by metagenomic next-generation sequencing to rapidly identify possible pathogens. Our analysis included a bioinformatics pipeline of rapid short-read classification and de novo genome assembly which resulted in the identification of a porcine enterovirus G (EV-G), a complete genome with substantial nucleotide differences (>30 %) among current sequences, and a novel non-structural protein similar in sequence to the Torovirus papain-like cysteine protease (PL pro ). This discovery led to the identification and circulation of an EV-G with a novel PL pro in the USA that has not been previously reported.",

Rapid detection of common viral pathogens by quantitative PCR (qPCR) can be effective, yet these methods often fail to differentiate viral subtypes and cannot identify unknown viruses causing clinical disease [1] . Next-generation sequencing (NGS) of clinical samples has greatly enhanced our ability to identify or discover unknown pathogens in a variety of sample types [2, 3] . However, current methods are slow to identify unknown species in clinical samples, which can often require multiple laboratory and bioinformatics steps, such as: viral isolation, de novo assembly of all NGS reads and classification of contigs using BLAST. Herein, we have developed a metagenomics workflow to rapidly identify reads from NGS reads using Kraken, ultra-fast classification software comprising individual reads, and a custom database of known sequences [4] . This workflow identified and assembled an enterovirus G complete genome that contained a novel 669 nucleotide insertion from two diarrhoeic 25-day-old piglets at weaning from Texas, USA. This insertion encodes a protein similar to a Torovirus papain-like cysteine protease (PL pro ), which resembles the picornavirus leader protease (L pro ) [5] .",

Picornaviruses encode a single polyprotein that is proteolytically processed into three precursor protein products that are further processed into four structural proteins (VP1-4) and seven non-structural proteins (2A pro , 2B, 2C, 3A, 3B, 3C pro and 3D-RdRp).

A recent analysis found no difference in the prevalence of EV-G infection in pigs from Vietnam, with or without diarrhoea [8] . Indeed, EV-G has not been widely associated with pathogenic diseases in swine, except for single reports of skin lesions [11] , flaccid paralysis [12] and the case (Porcine/USA/Texas1/2014, Porcine/USA/ Texas2/2014) of diarrhoeic pigs described in this study. The substantially high prevalence and large number of current genotypes may suggest that EV-G-mediated pathogenesis requires confounding factors (e.g. co-infections), or that only certain genotypes trigger clinical manifestation. Finally, porcine EV-G circulation among the USA swine population has rarely been observed, except in one case from Minnesota [13] .",

Two faecal samples (Porcine/USA/Texas1/2014, Porcine/USA/Texas2/2014) were collected on 3 December 2014 and tested for common viral pathogens by qPCR or bacterial culturing, which did not reveal any potential sources of pathogens associated with the clinical outbreak. The samples were processed for NGS on the Illumina Miseq, using previously described methods [14, 15] . NGS generated an average of 680 000 reads per sample. The raw data were analysed using a custom pipeline of bioinformatics tools. Sequencing quality was assessed with FastQC v0.11.2 [16] and reads with highly repetitive sequences were removed using PRINSEQ-lite 0.20.4 [17] . Reads were trimmed (phred quality <20) and adapter/index sequences were removed using Trimmomatic v0.33 [18] . An average of 628 000 reads survived processing and each surviving read was taxonomically classified by Kraken software [4] using a custom Kraken database. The database was built using in-house and GenBank/RefSeq sequences (release 215, downloaded 23 November 2016). It included all GenBank viral and phage sequences, and the latest RefSeq archaea, fungi, protozoa, plasmid, plastid, mitochondrion and bacteria (complete, chromosome and scaffold) sequences. The RefSeq pig, human, corn and soybean (pig's common food source) genomes were also included. All sequences were masked at low-complexity regions using DUST v1.0.0 (NCBI BLAST +v2.2.28) [19] , and the Kraken database was built with a k-mer size of 24 bp. This metagenomics bioinformatics pipeline identified the vast majority of eukaryotic and prokaryotic species in each sample, where only 8-10 % of reads in each sample were unidentified. These reads did not have any matches in the Kraken database and were subsequently investigated by de novo assembly and BLAST methods. The unknown contigs aligned to bacteria, bacteriophage, or pig sequences that were different from the genomes available from GenBank, and no other viral sequences were discovered. The Kraken-based classification revealed that a majority of reads in each sample were either host (2-37 %) or bacterial (49-58 %), and only 2.1-3.5 % of the reads were classified as viral. The majority of host or bacterial reads were derived from rRNA sequences, ranging from 6 to 62 %. The distribution of viral reads was explored for each sample and EV-G was the only virus detected, excluding bacteriophages. In each sample, 2743 (0.83 %) and 3856 (0.41 %) reads were classified as EV-G. Viral co-infection was nearly undetected in both samples, except that Porcine/USA/Texas1/2014 contained a small percentage of Sapporo virus (200 reads, 0.06 %).",

Using an assembly pipeline for analysis, the taxon-specific reads (EV-G) were isolated and de novo assembled with the Iterative Virus Assembler (IVA) v1.0.6 [20] , and the genomes were manually verified by remapping all sample reads using Bowtie2 v2.2.4 [21] .

The insertion sequence belongs to the Peptidase_C28 (pfam05408) and Peptidase_C19 (cd02257) superfamilies. The Peptidase_C28 conserved protein domain family corresponds to the FMDv leader proteinase located at the N-terminus of FMDv polyprotein 1a, which cleaves the host translation initiation factor 4GI (eIF4G), preventing efficient 5\u00a2-cap-dependent translation and shifting host translation to the viral (cap-independent) translation [22] . The Peptidase_C19 domain family also has peptidase activity and is found in de-ubiquitination enzymes. Indeed, the PL pro of other coronaviruses (e.g. SARS-CoV) are known to hydrolyse poly-ubiquitin chains, which may prevent degradation of viral proteins by the host proteasome [23] . However, the function of the PL pro insertion in the Texas strains, and its contribution to viral replication, transmission and pathogenesis are still unknown.",

To investigate the insertion of the PL pro in the Texas EV-G stains, a cleavage site analysis was performed by submitting the full-length ORF of the Texas EV-G strains to the NetPicoRNA 1.0 server [24] , which predicted two highly probable cleavage sites (0.958/1.0 cleavage scores) flanking the insertion region (Fig. 1a) . Thus, this analysis suggests that the PL pro insertion sequence does not impact on the 2C and 3A proteins, is most likely proteolytically cleaved by 3C pro from the precursor polyprotein and can function independently from the other prototypical EV-G proteins. Full-length ORFs from all current EV-G strains were analysed similarly (Fig. 1b) . The nucleotide sequences in this cleavage site were substantially diverse, possibly to prevent spurious recombination events while total conservation sites were present at four aa positions (1411, 1413, 1414 and 1416), including the most critical residues, Q*G.",

A BLASTN search was run using the Texas strains as the query sequence, which identified only six Torovirus-related sequences with high significance (e-value <1e\u00c016, query coverage >50 %). The BLASTN hits were translated and aligned with MUSCLE v3.8.31 [25] , revealing a core set of 173 aa conserved across all samples (Fig. 1c) . This alignment showed multiple regions of perfect conservation, suggesting that the protease active sites are retained. Phylogenetic tree generation with nucleotide sequences was conducted with RAxML v8.2.8 [26] using maximum likelihood and a general time-reversible (GTR) substitution matrix with BFGS optimization and a gamma model with 1000 bootstraps (Fig. 1d) . According to this tree, the PL pro sequences from both Texas strains share a common ancestor with two porcine-derived Torovirus sequences, whereas the bovine and equine sequences were more distantly related. A closer phylogenetic relationship between the Texas EV-G insertion and the porcine Torovirus PL pro sequences may suggest a common viral functionality of the PL pro -(like) protease in porcine. The phylogenetic tree distance (i.e. mean number of nucleotide substitutions per site) between the Texas insertion sequences (highlighted in blue) and the other two porcine strains (from China and the USA) was substantial, suggesting that if a recombination event occurred between the porcine (or other host-derived) Torovirus strains, these viruses have been evolving independently for some time after that event. Alternatively, the Texas EV-G strains may have acquired the PL pro 'insertion' sequence through convergent evolutionary pressures that selected for a similar protease found among substantially different viruses within the families Picornaviridae and Nidovirales (e.g. FMDv and Torovirus).",

Currently, EV-G genotypes are classified solely by the VP1. Phylogenetic analysis with all currently available EV-G VP1 sequences revealed that the Texas strains clustered in the middle of the large set of G1 genotypes (Fig. 2a) , which suggests that the Texas strains may have evolved from a common G1 ancestor before acquiring the PL pro insertion. Next, the phylogenetic relationships between all complete genomes were explored by aligning the nucleotide sequences and creating phylogenetic trees (as described above) (Fig. 2b) . The two EV-G strains from Texas (highlighted in orange) share a common ancestor with the large clade containing EV-G genotypes G2, 8 and 9, but appear to be phylogenetically distant from the EV-G genotypes G1, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 10. The EV-G genotype 5 (derived from ovine) is most distantly related to the EV-G genomes from swine, suggesting that whole-genome reclassification may be needed after additional full-length genomes become available. Phylogenetic analysis, excluding the insertion sequence in the Texas strains, resulted in the same tree topology. Based on the complete-genome phylogenetic tree, the Texas strains appear to be distantly related to the other porcine EV-G sequences, whereas the VP1 tree suggests that the Texas strains are closely related to G1. Thus, this finding may indicate that the insertion sequence is more likely to have occurred through viral recombination (between a recent EV-G1 and a Torovirus), rather than it having been acquired through convergent evolution. However, additional complete genome sequences are needed to answer this question. Therefore, based on the relative differences in nucleotide identities between all current full-length EV-G genomes (>30 % different), and the discovery of a novel viral insertion, we propose listing the Texas strains as a EV-G genotype: G1-PL pro . The presence of only 14 full-length EV-G genomes makes the prevalence of the EV-G insertion sequence unknown, and it may also be present in other EV-G genotypes. A larger sampling of full-length EV-G genomes will reveal the global prevalence and provide evolutionary insights for this novel sequence.",

            "text": "Genomic organization of the Texas EV-G stains and phylogenetic analysis of the insertion region. (a) The Texas EV-G viral ssRNA genomes contain a single ORF. These two strains contain a large 669 nt (233 aa) insertion (blue) with cleavage sites (EALFQ*GPPT) located at both ends of the insertion. The nucleotide (nt) and amino acid (aa) indices are shown, marking the boundaries of the insertion sequence. (b) The 3Cpro cleavage site between the 2C and 3A genes was analysed for nucleotide and amino acid conservation across all EV-G strains with complete genomes. The vertical black lines indicate where peptide cleavage occurs. The two Texas strains are highlighted in blue, and dots represent identical positions. Sequence positions correspond to the Texas1 strain. (c) Multiple sequence alignment of 223 aa Texas insertion and Torovirus strains revealing a core 173 aa region of considerable conservation, including multiple regions with 100 % aa identity. Sequence positions correspond to the Texas1 strain. GenBank accession",

The tree was rooted at the midpoint and the coloured dots represent taxa that were previously classified using the genotype/serotype nomenclature (www.picornaviridae.com). The branch lengths between taxa are based on the mean number of nucleotide substitutions per site. The VP1 sequences from both Texas strains (orange) fall within the G1 (red) genotype clade. (b) Phylogenetic analysis of full-length EV-G nucleotide sequences. The tree was rooted at the midpoint and the genomes are coloured according to previously published genotypes (i.e. genotypes based on VP1 sequence trees). The strain names are followed by GenBank accession numbers and genotypes. The branch lengths between taxa are based on the mean number of nucleotide substitutions per site and bipartitions are labelled with bootstrapping support values (%). The two Texas strains are highlighted in orange.",
