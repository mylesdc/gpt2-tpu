Although norovirus transmission mainly occurs via the fecal-oral and vomit-oral routes, airborne transmission has been proposed in recent decades. This paper re-examines a previously described norovirus outbreak in a hotel restaurant wherein airborne transmission was originally inferred. Specifically, the original evidence that suggested airborne transmission was re-analyzed by exploring an alternative hypothesis: could this outbreak instead have occurred via fomite transmission? This re-analysis was based on whether fomite transmission could have yielded similar attack rate distribution patterns. Seven representative serving pathways used by waiters were considered, and the infection risk distributions of the alternative fomite transmission routes were predicted using a multi-agent model. These distributions were compared to the reported attack rate distribution in the original study using a least square methods approach. The results show that with some reasonable assumptions of human behavior patterns and parameter values, the attack rate distribution corresponded well with that of the infection risk via the fomite route. This finding offers an alternative interpretation of the transmission routes that underlay this particular norovirus outbreak and an important consideration in the development of infection control guidelines and the investigation of similar norovirus outbreaks in future.",

Specifically, we applied a multi-agent model to simulate the transmission of noroviruses from the index patient to susceptible hosts via surface contact and calculated the exposure doses and infection risks. Seven representative serving pathways of waiters were considered under different scenarios, using various values for two important parameters: the dose-response parameter on the mucous membranes of gastrointestinal tracts, \u03b7 m , and the viral load, L 0 .

The index patient was a woman who vomited onto the floor at 8:30 p.m. The vomiting was not projectile, and the vomitus was rapidly cleaned by a waiter. Since handwashing of the lady and the waiter might not be effective enough [29, 30] , we assumed that very small amounts of norovirus were initially carried by the index patient's and the waiter's hands at the beginning of the outbreak (Table S5) . Because the meal was not disturbed by the vomiting episode, the following 90 min were assumed to be the potential exposure period. To explore in greater detail the possibility of fomite versus airborne transmission of noroviruses, we reassessed the evidence in support of airborne transmission in a norovirus outbreak at a hotel restaurant in the UK in 1998 [21] by testing whether the alternative fomite transmission route could have led to a similar pattern of secondary cases. The original investigation concluded that the outbreak was due to airborne transmission because the authors assumed that only the airborne route could have resulted in an attack rate that exhibited an inverse relationship with the distance from the index patient [21] . Here, we demonstrate that with some waiters' serving pathways and parameter values, a fomite transmission route could produce a similar pattern of secondary cases.",

Specifically, we applied a multi-agent model to simulate the transmission of noroviruses from the index patient to susceptible hosts via surface contact and calculated the exposure doses and infection risks. Seven representative serving pathways of waiters were considered under different scenarios, using various values for two important parameters: the dose-response parameter on the mucous membranes of gastrointestinal tracts, , and the viral load, .

            "text": "As suggested by references [27, 28] , the dose-response parameter on the mucous membranes, \u03b7 m , and the viral load, L 0 , strongly influence the infection risk distributions but might vary considerably among cases. According to the dose-response relationship model, we combined these two parameters as the product \u03b7 m L 0 to reduce the number of variables and defined the product as the dose effect of introducing 1 g of norovirus-containing particles with a viral load of L 0 to the mucous membranes. Based on the literature, we set a baseline scenario with a \u03b7 m of 0.1415/genome copy [35] and a L 0 of 3 \u00d7 10 8 genome copies/g [4] and investigated different scenarios as the value of \u03b7 m L 0 varied from 10 5 to 10 9 /g. In this outbreak, the fomite transmission of norovirus between people occurred mainly via interactive behaviors such as hand shaking and waiters serving guests. Because it was assumed that the guests did not shake hands with those from other parties, hand shaking behavior merely influenced the regional distribution of the infection risk at each table. In contrast, the waiters' serving behavior was not limited to single tables, which resulted in virus transmission between different tables. The waiter who initially carried the virus acted as a mobile virus source by which clean surfaces were contaminated, whereas other waiters acted as mobile media by which viruses were transmitted between surfaces. Thus, the overall infection risk distributions varied among the various serving pathway patterns (Figure 2 and Figure S1 ). Table 2 , where the index patient was seated, had very high average infection risks for all serving pathways because the other diners at that table had the opportunity to shake hands with the index patient, during which large amounts of noroviruses were transmitted. The infection risk distribution patterns at other tables were consistent with the waiters' pathways. In Pathways 1 and 2 ( Figure 2A and Figure S1A , respectively), wherein the waiters served guests at one table after another, the average infection risks of diners at each table (except Table 2 ) decreased according to the pathway direction ( Figure 2B and Figure S1B , respectively). In Pathways 3 and 4 ( Figure 2C and Figure S1C , respectively), the waiters served guests at half of a table after another half, resulting in a considerable diversity of infection risks among diners at the same table of Tables 3-5 . Therefore, the average infection risks at Tables 3-5 were similar to that of Table 6 . Because the diners at Table 1 were visited by waiters either very early (Pathway 3) or very late (Pathway 4), the average infection risk at that table was accordingly either very high ( Figure 2D ) or very low ( Figure S1D ). In Pathways 5 and 6 ( Figure 2E and Figure S1E , respectively), wherein each waiter served the guests of one group, the infection risk decreased in the direction of the pathway in each group ( Figure 2F and Figure S1F , respectively). In Pathway 7 ( Figure 2G ), the waiters served guests randomly, resulting in similar average infection risks at each table, except Table 2 ( Figure 2H ). Figure 3 presents the fitness between the reported attack rates and predicted infection risks in different scenarios, while Table 1 lists the scenarios with the best fitness (the minimum RSS) for the seven types of serving pathways. According to the dose-response relationship model [26] [27] [28] 32] , the infection risk increased with the viral load, L 0 , and the dose-response parameter of the mucous membranes, \u03b7 m . Excessively small or large values of these two parameters yielded correspondingly too low or high infection risks that deviated considerably from the attack rates. Therefore, the best fitness was reached with moderate values of \u03b7 m L 0 , as shown in Figure 3 and Table 1 .",

The dispersion of airborne virus-containing aerosols is mainly determined by the airflow pattern in an indoor environment. The high level of complexity of these airflow patterns can be attributed to many factors, such as differences in mechanical ventilation settings.",

However, in some other outbreaks, such as the first nosocomial MERS outbreak in South Korea [28] , fluid dynamics analyses predicted a higher average aerosol concentration in distant wards (i.e., downstream wards) than in adjacent wards. Since the distributions of infections transmitted via airborne routes are mainly decided by the dispersion of airborne aerosols [25, 26] , it do not necessarily present an inverse relationship with the distance from the source. Thus, to determine the infection patterns attributable to the airborne route, airflow-dynamic studies that model virus-laden aerosols generated by an index patient should be performed where possible [25] [26] [27] [28] .",

First, detailed information about the ventilation systems and size of the restaurant are not available [21] , so fluid dynamics analyses could not be performed. Therefore, the possibility of a long-range airborne route was not evaluated, and its relative importance versus the fomite route could not be accurately determined [27, 28] . Second, due to the limited understanding of some of the parameters of norovirus transmission, some parameters in the model, such as the rate of transfer from hands to porous surfaces (Table S2) , were estimated from those of other viruses or even bacteria. This might have reduced the accuracy of the results. Third, given the lack of real-time observation data, the model included many assumptions about the common surfaces and the actual behaviors and movements of the guests and waiters (Table S4) , which might have affected the infection risk distributions shown in Figure 2 and Figure S1 . In general, more detailed outbreak information, laboratory measurements and human behavioral observations would be required to provide a more accurate analysis of norovirus transmission in this outbreak.",

With reasonable assumptions regarding the serving pathways of waiters and parameter values, the findings suggest that the observed spatial attack rate pattern could have resulted from the fomite transmission of norovirus (e.g., Pathway 1). This finding offers an alternative interpretation to the hypothesized airborne transmission route proposed by the original investigators of the outbreak. Furthermore, this study illustrates the need for a careful fluid dynamics analysis when evaluating the possibility of airborne transmission in an outbreak investigation. The results of this alternative transmission route analysis may assist the development of evidence-based infection control measures for norovirus outbreaks.",
