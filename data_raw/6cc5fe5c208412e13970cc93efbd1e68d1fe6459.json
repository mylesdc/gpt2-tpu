Methods: We used real-time TaqMan-based PCR to detect MWPyV in the feces (n = 174) of children with diarrhea, nasopharyngeal aspirates (n = 887) from children with respiratory infections, and sera (n = 200) from healthy adults, and analyzed its clinical characteristics statistically. All the MWPyV-positive specimens were also screened for other common respiratory viruses.",

The samples were all co-infected with other respiratory viruses, most commonly with influenza viruses (69.2%) and human coronaviruses (30.7%). The MWPyV-positive children were diagnosed with bronchopneumonia or viral diarrhea. They ranged in age from 12 days to 9 years, and the most frequent symptoms were cough and fever. Conclusions: Real-time PCR is an effective tool for the detection of MWPyV in different types of samples. MWPyV infection mainly occurs in young children, and fecal-oral transmission is a possible route of its transmission.",

            "text": "The family Polyomaviridae contains small encapsidated DNA viruses with a closed circular DNA genome of 5 kb, packaged within an icosahedral capsid structure. The regulatory proteins, large T and small T antigens, are encoded in the early region of the genome, and structural proteins VP1, VP2, and VP3 are encoded in the late region [1] . Human polyomaviruses (HPyVs) usually cause asymptomatic primary infections, and persist in the body throughout life [2] . Thirteen HPyVs have been identified and successively isolated from urine (BKPyV), brain tissue (JCPyV), respiratory secretions (KIPyV and WUPyV), skin (MCPyV, HPyV6, HPyV7, and TSPyV), serum (HPyV9), stool samples (HPyV10 and isolates MW and MX, STLPyV), liver tissue (HPyV12), and vascular endothelial cells (NJPyV). The detection of HPyVs in these tissues suggests there exists an unrecognized tropism for HPyV [3] . HPyV10 is the type species of the genus Deltapolyomavirus in the family Polyomaviridae. In 2012, human polyomavirus 10 (HPyV10), MW polyomavirus (MWPyV), and MX polyomavirus (MXPyV) were isolated from condylomas on the buttocks of patients, fecal specimens from healthy children, and stool samples from children suffering diarrhea, respectively [4] [5] [6] . The whole-genome sequences of MXPyV, MWPyV, and HPyV10 are nearly identical, indicating that they are variants of the same species, which suggests that HPyV10 is a fecal contaminant rather than a wart-causing skin virus [7] . HPyV10 has not yet been definitively linked to a particular human disease [8] . Very little is known about MWPyV, so it is important to investigate its prevalence, basic epidemiology, genomic variability, and possible pathogenicity.",

Serial 10-fold dilutions of pMD18-VP1 were prepared, with the standard plasmid serially diluted from 10 10 to 10 0 copies/\u03bcl. The dilutions were added to the real-time qPCR reactions, and analyzed in triplicate. The results were used to construct a standard curve. The specificity of the qPCR was assessed by also testing WUPyV, KIPyV, JCPyV, BKPyV, and HPyV7. Reproducibility was evaluated by adding 10 5 -10 8 copies/\u03bcl pMD18-T/ VP1 to each reaction, and performing all the reactions four times, with the housekeeping gene glyceraldehyd-3phosphate dehydrogenase as the internal control.",

The two infected male children were 11 and 20 months old, and the female was 4 months old, so all three MWPyV-positive patients were <2 years.

Thirteen (1.47%) of the samples from children with ARIs and three (1.72%) from children with diarrhea were positive for MWPyV, whereas no serum (n = 200) was positive for MWPyV. In brief, the analysis of 1261 clinical samples only detected MWPyV in respiratory and fecal specimens from children, suggesting that the establishment of the primary infection occurs at an early age, and that the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts are sites of viral persistence.

It is noteworthy that all the 72-bp PCR products from positive samples shared 100% identity with the corresponding genomic regions of MWPyV, HPyV10, and MXPyV, accessed from GenBank. The sequences of the complete VP1 genes confirmed that NPA samples BJ289, BJ531, BJ538, and BJ541 contained MWPyV, and revealed that the viruses in the last three samples contained 5-10 single-base mutations. In total, 16 MWPyV-positive samples were detected in this study, and the cycle threshold (Ct) values for most of these were high (average Ct = 36.62, range 31.42-38.61), suggesting that the viral load was low.

These findings are supported by other studies that frequently detected MWPyV in respiratory samples from acutely ill patients and babies with upper respiratory symptoms [13, 17] .

These contrasting data may be attributable to the relatively small number of blood samples we analyzed (n = 200) or a different MWPyV may have been isolated from the human samples, to which have affected the antibody binding during serological analysis. Moreover, MWPyV DNA is more likely to be detected in blood during the primary infection than during viral reactivation [25] .

The primers and probes used in this study are listed in Additional file 1: Table S1 [28] [29] [30] . Influenza A virus and HCoV were the respiratory viruses most frequently detected in the MWPyV-positive patients, which is consistent with their frequent detection with WUPyV and KIPyV in respiratory samples [31] . The detection rate of Influenza A virus was 69.2%, followed by HCo-OC43, and then PIV3, the predominant subtype among PIVs. A comparison of the clinical symptoms experienced by the patients with and without co-infections indicated that co-infection with MWPyV did not affect the severity of the illness. 11 MWPyV-positive children with ARIs were diagnosed with bronchopneumonia, and their commonest symptoms were fever and cough. The symptoms of the three MWPyV-positive children with diarrhea who were co-infected with Rotavirus included diarrhea and fever. Our data suggest that primary MWPyV infections occur in childhood, predominantly sporadically. However, it is possible that MWPyV is shed within both the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts. Understanding these factors will help us prevent the transmission of MWPyV infections. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the epidemiological and clinical profiles of MWPyV in children hospitalized with ARIs or diarrhea in China, based on a real-time qPCR specific for MWPyV.",
