            "text": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized by a progressive upper and lower motor neuron degeneration. One of the peculiar clinical characteristics of ALS is the wide distribution in age of onset, which is probably caused by different combinations of intrinsic and exogenous factors. We investigated whether these modifying factors are converging into common pathogenic pathways leading either to an early or a late disease onset. This would imply the identification of phenotypic biomarkers, that can distinguish the two populations of ALS patients, and of relevant pathways to consider in a therapeutic intervention. Toward this aim a differential proteomic analysis was performed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from a group of 16 ALS patients with an age of onset \u226455 years and a group of 16 ALS patients with an age of onset \u226575 years, and matched healthy controls. We identified 43 differentially expressed proteins in the two groups of patients. Gene ontology analysis revealed that there was a significant enrichment in annotations associated with protein folding and response to stress. We next validated a selected number of proteins belonging to this functional group in 85 patients and 83 age-and sex-matched healthy controls using immunoassays. The results of the validation study confirmed that there was a decreased level of peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase A (also known as cyclophilin A), heat shock protein HSP 90-alpha, 78 kDa glucose-regulated protein (also known as BiP) and protein deglycase DJ-1 in PBMC of ALS patients with an early onset. Similar results were obtained in PBMC and spinal cord from two SOD1 G93A mouse models with an early and late disease onset. This study suggests that a different ability to upregulate proteins involved in proteostasis, such as foldase and chaperone proteins, may be at the basis of a different susceptibility to ALS, putting forward the development of therapeutic approaches aiming at boosting the protein quality control system.",

ALS is a highly heterogeneous disorder, with phenotypic variability involving a number of clinical aspects such as site of onset, age of onset, rate of progression, nonmotor involvement and response to therapy (Beghi et al., 2011) . This makes it difficult to decipher pathogenesis and to develop therapeutic strategies, also because biomarkers that reflect heterogeneity and may be useful for stratification are missing. A combination of genetic and environmental/exogenous modifying factors are believed to underlie this variability. The identification of the pathways affected by the modifying factors is of great interest, as they may be targets of therapeutic intervention.",

The majority of ALS patients have disease onset between 55 and 75 years of age, however patients with an age of onset <55 years and >75 years do exist and represent, respectively, the 22% and the 16% of all patients, as recently reported in a large multicenter Italian study (Calvo et al., 2016) . Several factors, both genetic and environmental/exogenous, have been reported to modify age of onset in patients and animal models of ALS. FUS mutations have been frequently associated with early-onset disease in familial and sporadic cases (Chi\u00f2 et al., 2009; H\u00fcbers et al., 2015) . Earlier onset of ALS has been also observed in soldiers and professional soccer players (Haley, 2003; Chi\u00f2 et al., 2005; Pupillo et al., 2012) . In these patients, an anticipated onset might be linked to heavy physical exercise, repeated trauma, and/or exposure to as yet unknown toxic agents in genetically predisposed individuals (Beghi and Morrison, 2005; Pupillo et al., 2012; Beghi, 2013) . A mutant SOD1 G93A mouse model of ALS on a 129Sv genetic background has an earlier age of onset than a SOD1 G93A mouse model on a C57BL6 genetic background despite an equal expression of the mutant protein (Marino et al., 2015) . These mice have also faster disease progression and an intrinsic marked down-regulation of specific pathways involved in mitochondrial function and protein quality control (Nardo et al., 2013 (Nardo et al., , 2016 Marino et al., 2015) . Conversely, ApoE2 polymorphism and lower EPHA4 expression have been correlated with delayed age of onset in ALS patients (Li et al., 2004; Van Hoecke et al., 2012) . Moreover, in mutant SOD1 mice female showed a later onset than male and this delay further increased with exercise (Veldink et al., 2003) .",

            "text": "Summarizing, different combinations of intrinsic and exogenous factors, that can be hardly discerned, may lead to an anticipated or a delayed onset of the disease. We wanted to test whether or not modifying factors are converging into common pathogenic pathways leading either to an early or a late disease onset. This would imply the identification of phenotypic biomarkers, that can distinguish the two populations of ALS patients, and of relevant pathways to consider in a therapeutic intervention. Toward this aim a significant cohort of incident ALS patients with either early (<55 years of age) or late (>75 years of age) disease onset was recruited from population-based Italian registries, and several analyses were performed. We found that an epigenetic rearrangement such as whole-blood DNA methylation could not distinguish the two groups of ALS patients (Tremolizzo et al., 2014) . However, difference in plasma amino acid levels were observed in relation to the age of onset . In this work, we identified protein phenotypic biomarkers in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of the same cohort of patients indicating that protein levels in PBMC could be good biological correlates of the age of onset in ALS. The same phenotypic biomarkers were also analyzed in the two mutant SOD1 mouse models of ALS with early and late disease onset indicating common changes between the sporadic and SOD1-linked forms. These biomarkers are proteins involved in the maintenance of protein homeostasis, or proteostasis. Proteostasis is attained through several quality-control systems that assist protein folding, clear misfolded proteins and respond to protein aggregation, whose major players are molecular chaperones. Interestingly, impaired proteostasis has emerged as a key contributor to the pathogenesis of ALS (Ruegsegger and Saxena, 2016) .",

Moreover, PPIA, HSP90, GRP78, and DJ-1 were similarly regulated, with a decreased level in early ALS compared to early controls and an opposite tendency in late ALS (Supplementary Figures S2A-C,E) , suggesting that early ALS patients have some defects in the response to stress pathways. In the same validation analysis, we measured another chaperone protein, HSC70, and TDP-43, both not differential in the 2D-DIGE analysis, but up-regulated in PBMC of a cohort of ALS patients with a mean age of onset of 62 \u00b1 10 years, previously reported in a work by our laboratory (Nardo et al., 2011) . We found that HSC70 could not distinguish early from late ALS ( Figure 2F ), but it was up-regulated in late ALS compared to controls (Supplementary Figure S2F) . We confirmed that total TDP-43 protein levels in PBMC underscores disease (Figure 2G ), in fact it was higher in both early and late ALS compared to controls, but could not discriminate early ALS from late ALS ( Figure 2H ). It has to be noted that in our assay the total TDP-43 protein level comprise the 43-kDa full-length and fragmented forms (Supplementary Figure S1A) .",

            "text": "The molecular determinants of ALS heterogeneity are still poorly understood. An anticipated or a delayed onset of the disease may be caused by various combinations of intrinsic and exogenous factors converging into common pathogenic pathways that underlie different susceptibility to ALS and eventually lead to a different prognosis. Here we report the identification of protein biomarkers in PBMC that can discriminate ALS patients with an early disease onset from those with a late disease onset. The identified phenotypic biomarkers have in common a high expression in CNS where they have an important role in protein folding, as foldases and/or classical molecular chaperones, and are upregulated by a variety of stressors. They participate at different levels and in different ways in the maintenance of proteostasis, whose deficit has shown to generate protein misfolding and aggregation and facilitate the development of several neurodegenerative diseases, including ALS (Ruegsegger and Saxena, 2016) . These phenotypic biomarkers are: PPIA, HSP90, GRP78, and DJ-1. Polyclonal anti-peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase A is ubiquitously expressed, with the highest expression in neurons and motor neurons (Lauranzano et al., 2015) . It is a peptidylprolyl cis/trans isomerase and, as a foldase, it accelerates the ratelimiting steps along the folding pathway, but it also acts as a classical molecular chaperone (Fischer et al., 1989; Freskgard et al., 1992) . We originally identified it as a candidate protein biomarker in PBMC of ALS patients with classical disease onset, where it is upregulated also in association with disease progression (Nardo et al., 2011) . We next found that mutant SOD1 and TDP-43 are substrates of PPIA (Lauranzano et al., 2015) . In fact, in absence of PPIA increased levels of mutant SOD1 and TDP-43 were recovered in the aggregates isolated from the spinal cord of SOD1 G93A mice that had also an anticipation of the onset and an acceleration of the disease progression.",

            "text": "These data suggest that a failure in the response to stress and a reduced ability to upregulate protective proteins may increase susceptibility to ALS. This is in agreement with the fact that vulnerable motor neurons have a high threshold for induction of the protective heat shock response and a higher sensitivity to ER stress (Batulan et al., 2003; Saxena et al., 2009) . A protein signature comprising a panel of proteins involved in proteostasis may underline a subset of patients more susceptible to the disease and may help to stratify patients for more targeted ALS clinical trials. These observations further strengthen the notion that proteostasis maintenance by the ubiquitin-proteasome system, autophagy and ER, is a central issue in ALS, and therapeutic approaches aiming at boosting the protein quality control system might be a promising therapeutic strategy. Arimoclomol, a small molecule that acts as a co-inducer of the heat shock response by prolonging HSF1 activation and upregulating a number of proteins such as HSP60, HSP70, HSP90, and GRP94, has shown to be effective in several experimental models of motor neuron degeneration including the SOD1 G93A mouse (Kalmar et al., 2014) . A Phase II clinical trial in ALS patients has shown that the drug is safe and well tolerated (Cudkowicz et al., 2008) and is now under investigation in a PhaseII/III clinical trial in SOD1 positive familial ALS patients (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00706147). Colchicine, a FDA-approved drug that was identified by a high-throughput screening as enhancer of the expression of HSPB8, a key player of the protein quality control system, has demonstrated to facilitate the removal of TDP-43 aggregates by autophagy (Crippa et al., 2016) .",

Proteins were then dissolved in 30 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.5, 7 M urea, 2 M thiourea, CHAPS 4% (w/v) and Cydye-labeled according to the manufacturer's instructions (GE Healthcare) with minor modifications. Briefly, 20 \u00b5g of each pool was labeled with 200 pmol of Cy3 or Cy5 dye for 30 min in ice in the dark. To exclude preferential labeling of the dyes, each sample was also reverse labeled. As an internal standard, aliquots of each pool were mixed and labeled with Cy2 dye. Labeled samples were then resuspended in Destreak SolutionTM (GE Healthcare) with IPG buffer pH 3-11 NL 1% v/v (GE Healthcare) and loaded into 11 cm-IPG strips pI range 3-11NL (GE Healthcare). Isoelectrofocusing was done on an IPGphor apparatus (GE Healthcare) with the following protocol: 300 Vhrs at 30 V, 50 Vhrs at 200 V, 1500 Vhrs at 2000 V, 2800 Vhrs of a linear gradient up to 3500 V, 4800 Vhrs at 3500 V, 8500 Vhr of a linear gradient up to 8000 V, and 30000 Vhr at 8000 V. SDS-PAGE was done using Precast Tris-HCl 10% polyacrylamide SDS gel (Biorad). Eight 2D gels were run with the four experimental groups. Each gel contained two experimental groups, one Cy3-labeled, the other Cy5-labeled plus the Cy2labeled internal standard. Gel images were captured by the laser scanner Molecular Imager FX (Bio-Rad). Image analysis was done with Progenesis Same Spot software (Nonlinear Dynamics). For each spot the normalized volume was standardized against internal standard spot normal volume. The values for each spot in each group were expressed as the mean of the Cy3and Cy5-labeled analyses. Values for early and late ALS were further normalized to the means values of early and late controls, respectively.
