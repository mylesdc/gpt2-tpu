Because ILT and IB have high incidence and infectivity in chickens at different ages (in days), they have caused huge economic losses to the poultry industry. Both diseases have similar clinical symptoms and pathological changes, leading to significant difficulties in clinical differential diagnosis, especially in cases of mixed infection [1, 2] . In addition, the use of vaccines is the main approach to control of the economically important poultry viral respiratory diseases, such as infectious laryngotracheitis and infectious bronchitis [3] . Therefore, it is important to establish a method to simultaneously detect ILTV and IBV antibodies for the differential diagnosis and immune response evaluation after vaccination.",

Despite its unique, sensitive, simple features and rapidity, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is unable to meet the requirements for high-flux quarantine and is not favorable for the urgent screening of bulk samples.

            "text": "IB, an acute infectious disease characterized by acute watery diarrhea, kidney necrosis, and high mortality, is caused by IBV. Thus far, IB has resulted in economic losses to the poultry industry in various countries [8, 11] . IBV infects chickens at different ages. Chicks infected with IBV are characterized by noisy breathing, panting, sneezing, nasal fluid, and other symptoms; furthermore, laying hens exhibit significantly reduced egg production, broilers exhibits low growth and bad meat quality, and breeding hens exhibit significantly reduced breeding efficiency [12] . ILT is an acute, contact respiratory infectious disease in chickens. Chickens infected with ILT are characterized by nasal fluid, conjunctivitis, panting, coughing, and the production of bloody mucus, as well as swelling, erosion, necrosis, and extensive bleeding in the throat after analysis; laying hens exhibit reduced egg production or even no production, as well as poor egg quality [13] . The disease spreads rapidly and has a wide distribution. The high mortality rate (> 70%) results in huge economic losses to the poultry industry [4] . Given the similar clinical symptoms between ILT and IB, the development of diagnoses for both diseases is significant. This is the first case report of differential diagnosis of ILTV and IBV with xMAP assay. Luminex xMAP assay is an emerging technology that uses small carboxylated polystyrene microspheres that are internally dyed with both a red and an infrared fluorophore [14] . By changing the ratio of the two fluorophores, it is possible to distinguish up to 100 different color-coded microsphere sets, and each microsphere set may be coupled with a different biological probe. The microspheres are detected and characterized by a dedicated flow cytometer [15] . The Luminex xMAP technology is useful for many different applications. One review describes the use of this technology for the multiplex detection of viral, bacterial, parasitic, and fungal agents using the microsphere-based multiplex nucleic acid assay (MBMNA) and the microsphere-based multiplex immunoassay (MBMI) [16] . MBMIs are typically biochemical tests that allow the detection or measurement of the concentration of a protein in a solution via an antibody or immunoglobulin [17] . MBMIs are often used in the diagnosis of various pathogens, such as human papillomavirus and human cytomegalovirus, to detect antibodies in serum samples [18] [19] [20] . The advantages of this technology are its simple operation, high accuracy, and reduction in the number This study describes the establishment and validation of single xMAP and duplex xMAP assays. First, to achieve effective and rapid clinical diagnosis of ILT and IBV, single xMAPs were established for the separate diagnosis of these two diseases after screening to identify the best concentrations of microsphere antigens for ILTV gD and IBV N (2.5 \u03bcg/5 \u00d7 10 5 magbeads and and 12 \u03bcg/5 \u00d7 10 5 magbeads, respectively), with an optimal serum dilution of 1:100. However, it is not ideal to diagnose only one type of pathogen antibody because more than one disease often affects the respiratory tract in poultry. Given the similar clinical symptoms of ILT and IBV, the differential diagnosis of these two pathogens with two single xMAP assays using one sample wastes time and energy. To achieve the rapid differential diagnosis of clinical samples, it is necessary to establish a duplex xMAP. In addition to ILTV and IBV, AIV and NDV are also common respiratory viruses for poultry. These four diseases have high incidences, and it is difficult to make a differential diagnosis based on clinical symptoms, which are all similar. Figures 2 and 3 showed that our xMAP methods was able to simultaneously detect the antibodies to ILTV or IBV in the sera and had the high specificity. A duplex xMAP can quickly identify ILTV and IBV infection, but it does not indicate possible infection by AIV and NDV. Therefore, based on this study, we propose that quadruplex xMAP should be established in the future for the detection of ILTV, IBV, AIV and NDV as a fast and effective differentiation tool for these four viruses.",

            "text": "Since ELISA was established to detect ILTV antibodies in 1982 [21] , it has demonstrated strong advantages, as well as higher sensitivity than virus neutralization tests (VNT), making it widely applicable. ELISA antibody detection of IBV is also feasible at earlier time points [22, 23] and is currently broadly applied in the poultry industry. Single-analyte ELISA does not support the detection of multiple specific antibody responses simultaneously for a single serum sample [24] and possesses other disadvantages, such as the requirement for a relatively large amount of sample, negligible nonspecific binding, and increased background. However, with the development of the poultry industry, requirements dictate that many samples must be detected simultaneously; thus, a new detection method for diagnosis with ILTV and IBV is significant. Luminex xMAP assay represents an alternative for commonly employed indirect tests such as ELISA. The conversion of an ELISA to the xMAP format is uncomplicated, efficient and cost-saving, producing an assay with superior dynamic range and sensitivity [25] . MBMI represents increased sensitivity and the potential to quantify antibodies, antigens, and other substances (e.g., hormones, cytokines, and tumor markers), unlike conventional ELISA tests [26] . Luminex xMAP has also been compared with a western blot assay for antibody detection [27] . The results obtained from both methods showed that the sensitivity of xMAP was 82.7%, while the western blot assay sensitivity was 74.7%. Therefore, xMAP may be more efficient and precise than western blots for the diagnosis of diseases. Although ELISA provides relatively accurate results and has been used for many years, this study demonstrates that xMAP is much more sensitive than ELISA for the diagnosis of ILT, as indicated by the results presented in Table 6 . In addition, xMAP may be used for the rapid diagnosis of many samples, saving time and effort. The results presented in Table 7 , demonstrate that xMAP is highly accurate, with similar detection results to those obtained by ELISA in positive clinical samples; thus, xMAP is able to be widely applicable.",
