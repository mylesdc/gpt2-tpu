Variation in colostrum management of beef and dairy calves is thought to affect early immune development. Therefore, the objective of this study was to examine changes in gene expression and investigate molecular pathways involved in the immune-competence development of neonatal Holstein dairy calves and naturally suckled beef calves using next generation RNA-sequencing during the first week of life. Jugular whole blood samples were collected from Holstein (H) dairy calves (n = 8) artificially fed 5% B.W. colostrum, and from beef calves which were the progenies of Charolais-Limousin (CL; n = 7) and Limousin-Friesian beef suckler cows (LF; n = 7), for subsequent RNA isolation. In dairy calves, there was a surge in pro-inflammatory cytokine gene expression possibly due to the stress of separation from the dam. LF calves exhibited early signs of humoral immune development with observed increases in the expression genes coding for Ig receptors, which was not evident in the other breeds by 7 days of age. Immune and health related DEGs identified as upregulated in beef calves are prospective contender genes for the classification of biomarkers for immune-competence development, and will contribute towards a greater understanding of the development of an immune response in neonatal calves.",

The protection of the womb environment during the pre-partum period, coupled with syndesmochorial placentation, results in a lack of experience to pathogens, meaning that calves are born with an essentially non-functional immune response 1 . Development of immunocompetence in calves relies on successful absorption of maternal colostrum derived immunoglobulins, which in turn is dependent upon successful colostrum management. The importance of colostrum-derived passive immunity, through intestinal absorption of colostral immunoglobulins, to the mortality, morbidity, and subsequent growth and welfare of a newborn calf is recognised internationally 2-5 . Consequently, colostrum feeding management is of critical importance to the health and vitality of the calf, in order to confer protection from the various septicemic and enteric diseases that they are susceptible to in early life 2 . Failure of passive transfer of colostrum derived IgGs (FPT, serum IgG < 10 mg/mL) markedly increases morbidity and mortality in calves 3-5 . There is tremendous variation in the passive immune status of dairy calves 3,6-8 and, generally passive immunity of dairy calves is much lower than beef calves 7 . This difference is primarily attributed to differences in colostrum Ig levels, whereby dairy cows produce relatively large volumes of colostrum with relatively low concentrations of Ig while beef cows produce the opposite 3, 9, 10 . In the suckled beef calf, there are also large differences in passive immunity between cow breed types 3,8 .",

Networks of interest included 'Cell signalling, Molecular transport, Vitamin and mineral transport' (Network 3), and 'Cellular development, Cellular growth and Proliferation' (Network 4). On investigation of any upstream effects of DEG enriched in the comparison of 168 h and 72 h dairy calves, we identified inhibition of a growth factor at 168 h, TGF\u03b21. Additionally, inhibition of a transmembrane receptor, EPOR, was identified as \u22125.487 times lower in the 168 h calves, with 22 out of the proposed 366 genes involved in its upstream regulation present in the DEG list. Table 2 . Firstly, biologically interesting pathways were investigated within the CL crossbred calves. Comparison of 48 h to 0 h CL calves resulted in 2095 DEG, 1766 of which were successfully mapped in IPA. Biologically interesting enriched molecular, cellular and physiological networks included cellular movement, immune cell trafficking, and lymphoid tissue structure and development. Top enriched canonical pathways included cholesterol biosynthesis, which was upregulated in the 48 h old calves, the complements system, also upregulated at 48 h, and two interleukin signalling pathways, 1l-9 and Il-12 in which the majority of genes were present at higher levels after 48 h. Investigating upstream analysis effector genes identified a number of significantly altered upstream regulators including a number of growth factors (Areg, Hgf, VEGFA), cytokines (c5f2, PRL, IFNa2), and also the Fc gamma receptor upstream pathway activated in the CL calves at 48 h. Supplementary  Fig. 10 shows activation of transmigration of cells with many immunologically important receptors highlighted as included cellular movement, immune cell trafficking and also cellular function and maintenance. There were no canonical pathways identified as significantly enriched in the comparison. Overall a major stabilization of the immune response was evident through the inhibition of a number of immune related regulators ( Supplementary  Fig. 11 ). The LF calves were also compared across the four time points (0 h, 48 h, 72 h and 168 h) to investigate the development of immunocompetence during the first week of life. Similarly high levels of DEG were evident at the early timepoint comparison of 48 h versus 0 h, with 2021 DEG identified in total, with 1640 of these being successfully mapped in IPA. Top enriched molecular and cellular networks included cellular movement, cellular function and maintenance; immune cell trafficking, and lymphoid tissue structure and development. A number of upstream regulators including a large number of cytokines (TNF\u03b1, Il1\u03b2, IFN), transmembrane receptors (TLR3, TLR4, TLR7, TLR9) exhibited activation in the 48 h calves compared to 0 h. LF calves were then compared at 168 h versus 72 h to identify observable alterations to key genes and pathways involved in the development of immunocompetence. Overall there were 1897 DEG identified, with 1562 being successfully mapped using IPA for functional analysis. The vast majority of total DEG, 1362 out of 1897, were present at lower levels in the 168 h calves, highlighting the stabilization on the initial surge in immune gene expression. A number of biologically interesting networks were enriched in pathway analysis of the 168 h and 72 h calves, including network 14 mapping enrichment of immune cell trafficking and the inflammatory response, of which the majority of genes are present at lower levels of expression by 168 h (Supplementary Fig. 12 ). Network 23 however, humoral immune response, showed upregulation of a number of genes in the 168 h calves (See Fig. 2) .

To date, no research has characterized, using a functional genomics approach, the immune transcriptome of breeds of calves, namely, dairy and beef, over the first 7 days of life under varying management systems. The contrast between dairy and beef breeds is also important as in some countries replacement breeding heifers for the beef cow herd are often sourced from the dairy herd i.e. beef \u00d7 dairy cows. Below, we discuss alterations in the whole blood transcriptome over time from birth in a side by side comparison of dairy calves and in two beef crossbreeds. The whole blood transcriptome of the two beef crossbreed calves were also compared to each other across the three critical time points, to determine any differences in the transcriptomic profile that may indicate differences in development of immunocompetence in beef breeds.",

            "text": "Colostrum management on both beef suckler and dairy farms is of critical importance to the prevention of calf morbidity and mortality. It is generally perceived that the passive immune status of suckler-bred calves is superior to dairy-bred calves. This is evident under controlled research farm conditions, where it is ensured that calves suckle the dam and/or are fed sufficient colostrum in a timely manner post-parturition 5, 7 . However, as the majority of dairy calves are removed from the dam at birth or shortly after, and artificially fed colostrum, management practices are of particular importance. First milking colostrum, fed within two hours of birth is widely recommended, but of equal importance is the volume of colostrum fed. Research suggests that 10% of total body weight should provide sufficient volumes of colostrum for dairy calves, but management practices under artificial feeding systems means that this may not always be the case [14] [15] [16] . For the purpose of this study, 5% total body weight of colostrum was artificially fed to dairy calves, with both beef breeds ingesting colostrum from the dam under observation, in order to identify alterations to critical genes during the first week of life.",

            "text": "Firstly, the transcriptomic profile of dairy calves over the first week of life was examined. Networks identified as over-represented in the comparison of 48 h and 0 h dairy calves included haematological system development and immune cell trafficking, although the genes involved in these networks did not display a consistent pattern of expression. Comparison of 48 h to 0 h dairy calves resulted in top canonical pathways including the role of pattern recognition receptors, G protein coupled receptor signalling and Il-17a signalling. The expression of the genes involved in pattern recognition at 48 h in the dairy calves however, was lower than at 0 h. The role of PRRs in the innate immune response is well documented and the decreased expression of genes involved in such a pathway in the dairy calves could potentially result in immune impairment 17, 18 . Complement system however, was upregulated at 48 h in the dairy calves. CF1, which encodes complement factor 1 was present at increased levels of almost 3 fold higher at 48 h post birth. The complement system is a vital component of the innate immune response compromised of a large group of proteins that work together to opsonize microbes for clearance 19 . A significant number of cytokines and chemokines were present in altered levels of abundance in the dairy calves at 48 h post birth compared to o h. CXCL10 was upregulated at 6.78 RFC in dairy calves at 48 hr, which is thought to play a role in T cell chemotaxis. T cells are regarded as a crucial link between the innate and adaptive immune responses 20, 21 . Analysis of upstream regulating genes in the 48 h dairy calves compared to the 0 h calves identified a number of cytokines as being inhibited in this period at the later time point including Il4 and Il1\u03b2, two immunologically important regulatory genes 22 . Chemokine expression was also reduced overall in the 48 h dairy caves when compared to the 0 h calves. Chemokines are involved in immune cell activation and chemotaxis and a reduced level of transcriptional abundance by 48 h could lead to immune impairment 23 . A significant number of solute carrier genes were down regulated at 48 h in the dairy calves compared to 0 h. Solute carrier proteins are responsible for the transport of sodium and bicarbonate ions across the cell membrane. The significant reduction in such a large number of these genes is not completely clear but could be due to the fact that colostrum has a much higher sodium content than transition milk and mature milk 24 . The high sodium content may result in a necessary upregulation in ion transporters, which are then present at lower levels of expression by 48 h.",

There was no clear indication of a major immunological change in the dairy calves through observation of the transcriptomic profile at 168 h. Chemokine expression however, was upregulated in the 168 h compared to the earlier time points. Top upstream regulators included CSF2 which encoded granulocyte stimulating factor; a cytokine that stimulates the differentiation of hematopoietic precursor cells such as granulocytes and macrophages 25 . Overall, there is an observed downregulation of members of the interleukin superfamily at 168 h post birth in the dairy calves expression however, was down regulated at 168 h in the dairy calves, including IL11RA and IL1F10.

In beef LF calves, comparison at 48 h versus 0 h highlighted the role of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) as being over-represented, with the majority of genes upregulated at 48 h. The most noticeable increase to the expression of cytokines was observed in the LF crossbreed calves, with a large number of cytokines present at increased levels of abundance by 48 h. CXCL10 was present at 4 RFC and 28 RFC in the beef CL and LF calves respectively, at 48 h compared to 0 h. CXCL10 encodes a small IFN\u03b3 inducible pro-inflammatory cytokine linked to having significant function within the immune response, involved in T cell chemotaxis and in monocyte migration among many proposed functions 26 . CF1, an important component of the complement defence system was also present at higher levels in both the LF and CL beef crossbreeds, at 5 fold and 7.2 fold higher respectively at the 48 h time point, similar to the increase seen in the dairy calves over the first 48 h post birth. Significant alterations to the molecular transport system are evident across both beef breeds at 48 h following birth and colostrum ingestion. Interestingly, the three most down regulated genes across beef CL and beef LF were the same; SLC26A8, IL1R2, and PTX3. SLC26A8 is a solute carrier protein as previously discussed, and is also the most down regulated gene in the dairy calves at 48 h. IL12, is a decoy non-signalling receptor found on B cells, neutrophils, monocytes and macrophages, and is responsible for immune regulation through the capturing of Il-1 27, 28 .",

Only the 48 h time point gave significant levels of DEG for functional analysis, which in itself is of interest, as this time point is the most critical in the observation of possible immune alterations, following colostrum consumption. There is evidence to suggest that LF dams produce higher quality colostrum 3 . Overall, the majority of immunologically important pathways contained genes that were present at lower levels in the CL calves, including interferon signalling, an infectious disease network, and an overall antimicrobial response network. A number of upstream regulators were also present at decreased levels of expression in the CL calves at 48 h compared with LF calves, including LPS, IRF7, and IFN\u03b1. The decreased levels of expression across these key immune gene regulators is suggestive of a lower immune capability in CL calves at 48 h compared with LF. The expression of a group of chemokines were also downregulated in the CL calves at 48 h compared to LF. Almost all of the genes present at the lowest levels of abundance in the CL calves when compared to LF at 48 h were immune related genes, such as CD274, which encodes an immune inhibitory receptor ligand that is expressed by hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cells, such as T cells and B cells. The gene present at the lowest level of mRNA abundance in CL calves at 48 h was MAL, which encoded a T cell differentiation protein 31 .

Calves were fed 12.5% of their BW of colostrum from their own dam for the first 4 days of life. Calves were weighed at birth and 70 d using a calibrated weigh scale (Tru-Test Eziweigh 5, Auckland, New Zealand). Calves were individually penned for the first 4 days of life, and on day 5 were placed in a group pen where they were fed a skim based calf milk replacer (protein and oil content of 23% Table 1 ) and offered ad libitum concentrate and clean water from an automatic milk feeder (Forster Technik vario, Germany). Once calves were introduced to the automatic feeder on d 5, their weights were recorded on a daily basis using an automated weigh scale until d 63 (Forster Technique, body scale, Germany). Two beef cow breeds were included: Limousin \u00d7 Friesian (LF) (n = 7) and Charolais \u00d7 Limousin (CL) (n = 7). Mean parity (SD) for LF and CL beef suckler cows was 5.5 (0.94) and 5.3 (1.03), respectively. The mean calving date was 28 th February 2015 (26 th January to 27 th April). All calves involved in the study were single birth calves and had a mean calving difficulty score of 2.1, ranging from 1 (unobserved/ unassisted) to 3 (assisted with calving aid). Births were supervised by farm personnel to ensure that calves did not suckle the cow prior to implementing the experimental protocol for collection of the first blood sample from the calf. All calves were closely observed to ensure suckling of the dam and any calf not suckling within 1 h of birth or showing signs of weakness was assisted to suckle the cow. After parturition, beef calves remained with their dams and had free access to their dams for suckling until weaning after 7 months of age. Calf live weights were recorded at birth, and every four weeks thereafter throughout the experimental period. Mean (SD) calf birth weight was similar (P > 0.05) for the progeny of CL (46.4 (4.74) kg) and LF (46.6 (6.27) kg) cows.

IgG concentration was then determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit for bovine IgG from Bio-X Diagnostics (Jemelle, Belgium) 32, 33 . All components of the kit were brought to room temperature (21 \u00b0C) before use. The wash buffer was diluted 20 fold with distilled water. A calibration curve was constructed and all samples were diluted at 1:225 in phosphate buffer saline (PBS), as per manufacturer's instructions. All samples (100 \u00b5l) were added to the test plate and tested in duplicate, along with standards using a 96-well dilution plate. Equal volumes of horse radish peroxidase (HRP) conjugate was added to each well of the dilution plate and then 100 \u00b5L of this was transferred to the test plate. Each test plate was incubated at room temperature (21 \u00b0C) for 1 hour. The plate was washed three times using wash solution. Chromogen solution (tetramethylbenzidine) was added to each well (100 \u00b5l/well) and the plate was protected from light and incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature. Stop solution was added to each well (50 \u00b5l/well) and the absorbance (optical densities) of the samples was read at a wavelength of 450 nm using a microplate spectrophotometer (Tecan Magellan, M\u00e4nnedorf, Switzerland). Negative controls were included on the test plate. An inter-assay CV of <0.15 was observed. These concentrations of IgG in the samples were averaged and then subtracted from the known concentrations of IgG in the reference standard absorbance values provided in the test kit. A standard curve was produced using the average values from duplicate standard wells. This curve illustrated the relationship between absorbance and IgG concentration. The coefficient of determination value for each assay had to exceed 0.9 on the standard curve for inclusion within these results [32] [33] [34] . RNA Isolation and Purification. RNA was isolated from whole blood collected from dairy and beef calves using the tempus spin RNA isolation reagent kit following manufacturer's guidelines (Applied Biosystems, USA). The quantity of the RNA isolated was determined by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer ND-1000 (Nanodrop Technologies, DE, USA). RNA quality was assessed on the Agilent Bioanalyser 2100 using the RNA 6000 Nano Lab Chip kit (Agilent Technologies Ireland Ltd., Dublin, Ireland). RNA samples with 28S/18S ratios ranging from 1.8 to 2.0 and RNA integrity number (RIN) values of between 8 and 10 were deemed to be of high quality. RNA was stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until subsequent cDNA library preparation. cDNA library preparation and sequencing. cDNA libraries were prepared using the Illumina TruSeq RNA sample prep kit following the manufacturer's instructions (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). For each sample, 0.7 \u03bcg of RNA was used for cDNA library preparation. Briefly, mRNA was purified from total RNA and then fragmented. First strand cDNA synthesis was performed using SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase (Applied Biosystems Ltd., Life Technologies) subsequently synthesising the second strand using components of the Illumina TruSeq RNA sample prep kit. Adaptors were ligated to the cDNA which was then enriched by PCR. Final individual cDNA libraries were validated on the Agilent Bioanalyser 2100 using the DNA 1000 Nano Lab Chip kit (Agilent Technologies Ireland Ltd., Dublin, Ireland), ensuring that library fragment size was ~100 base pairs (bp) and library concentration was >30 ng/\u03bcl. Subsequently, individual RNAseq libraries were pooled based on their respective sample-specific-6 bp adaptors and sequenced at 100 bp/sequence single-end read using an Illumina HiSeq2000 sequencer (Macrogen Europe, The Netherlands). Approximately 38.4 million sequences per sample (Mean \u00b1 SD = 38,432,764 \u00b1 7,169,473) were generated, with each calf representing an individual sample.",

Quality assessment of the filtered data was performed by FastQC. Both cutadapt and FastQC were called using the wrapper script TrimGalore! Using this information, samples with fewer than 10 7 reads were rejected from further analysis. Reads were mapped against the UMD3.1 Bos taurus genome from Ensembl 87. Read alignment was performed using STAR. Gene level read-counts were quantified using STAR's '-quantMode GeneCounts' parameter. Analysis of the count data was performed using R's Bioconductor package DESeq2. Raw count data was supplied to DESeq2, with no prior normalisation/transformation steps applied, as per DESeq2 guidelines. A DESeq2 internal analysis pipeline (DESeq) was then applied to the raw data, which estimates size factors, dispersion, performs negative binomial GLM fitting and calculates Wald statistics. Separately, read counts were transformed using DESeq2's varianceStabilizingTransformation function for visualisation purposes. Hierarchical Clustering (HC) and Principal Components Analysis (PCA) were used in initial, unsupervised analysis of the transformed data to provide information regarding trends and potential outliers. HC analysis was applied using average linkage and Pearson correlation as a distance metric. DESeq2 was used to perform differential expression analysis on the output of the DESeq pipeline. The Benjamini and Hochberg adjusted p-value threshold to denote statistical significance of changes in a given gene's expression levels was set to 0.05, with a fold change \u00b11.5 considered as a significantly altered level of transcript abundance.

Network eligible genes derived from these datasets were overlaid onto a global molecular network developed from information contained in the Ingenuity Knowledge Base. Networks of these genes were then generated algorithmically based on their connectivity (Ingenuity Systems, 2005). The network score is based on the hypergeometric distribution and is calculated with the right-tailed Fisher's Exact Test. Canonical pathway analysis identified the pathways from the IPA library of canonical pathways that were most significant to the dataset in terms of the ratio of the number of genes that mapped to the pathway from the dataset and a right-tailed Fisher's exact t-test to determine the probability that the genes mapped to the pathway by chance alone.",

The corresponding least squares means (Lsmeans) and SEM of the non-transformed data are presented in the results for clarity. The serum IgG data were analysed using repeated measures mixed model ANOVA (PROC MIXED, SAS v 9.4) with animal ID, breed (cow breed), sampling time and their interactions included as a fixed effect. REML linear mixed models, was performed to detect significant differences between experimental breeds. The statistical model consisted of the individual animal as the experimental unit in all analyses. Breed was the fixed effect within the model. Animal was included in each model as a random effect. For repeated measures, sampling time was included as the repeated measure. Non-statistically significant interactions were removed from all the models. The type of variance-covariance structure used was chosen depending on the magnitude of the Akaike information criterion (AIC) for models run under compound symmetry, unstructured, autoregressive, heterogeneous 1st order autoregressive, or Toeplitz variance-covariance structures. The model with the least AIC value was selected. The differences between mean values were determined by F-tests using Type III sums of squares. The PDIFF was applied as appropriate to evaluate pairwise comparisons between means. A probability of P < 0.05 was selected as the level of significance and statistically tendencies were reported when P < 0.10. Differences between the means were examined using the PDIFF (difftype) option within the MIXED procedure of SAS. Means were considered statistically significant at a probability level of P < 0.05.",
